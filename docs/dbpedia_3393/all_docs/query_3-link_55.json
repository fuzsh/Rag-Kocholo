Eakin traces how mestiçagem moved from a conversation among a small group of intellectuals to become the dominant feature of Brazilian national identity, demonstrating how diverse Brazilians embraced mestiçagem, via popular music, ﬁlm and television, literature, soccer, and protest movements. The Freyrean vision of the unity of Brazilians built on mestiçagem begins a gradual decline in the 1980s with the emergence of an identity politics stressing racial differences and multiculturalism. The book combines intellectual history, sociological and anthropological ﬁeld work, political science, and cultural studies for a wide-ranging analysis of how Brazilians – across social classes – became Brazilians. Marshall C. Eakin is Professor of History at Vanderbilt University. A specialist in modern Brazilian history, he is the author of four books including The History of Latin America: Collision of Cultures.

The ﬁrst book I ever read about Brazil was Gilberto Freyre’s The Masters and the Slaves. I vividly remember reading Freyre one scorching summer (1972) in a tiny one-room apartment (without airconditioning) in Lawrence, Kansas, in between my freshman and sophomore years in college. Little did I realize that summer in the middle of North America that this thick volume was one of the most important books about Brazil, and that it would become one of the most important in my life. Enthralled, during those torrid Kansas summer days I slowly sweated my way through this brilliant, eccentric essay. Looking back, I realize that I barely had begun to understand what Freyre was saying. My lack of comprehension was countered by the enthusiasm the book generated in me for this “new world in the tropics.” Although I would take a very indirect path (through Central America), over the next decade I gradually became a historian of Brazil. Although my ﬁrst writing and publications were on race and identity in early twentiethcentury Brazil, for more than twenty years – from the 1970s to the 1990s – I studied and wrote primarily about the economic history of Brazil. Periodically, I would come back to my ruminations about Freyre and Brazilian culture, but it was not until recently that I ﬁnally returned to where I began. Over the years, as I researched, taught, and lectured about Brazil, I became intrigued at how the ideas and work of Gilberto Freyre became the central mythology that propelled the formation of Brazilian national identity in the twentieth century.\n\nxiii\n\nxiv\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nLong ago and far away in Kansas, Betsy Kuznesof helped get me started as a historian of Brazil. In Los Angeles, Brad Burns taught me to see the big picture and to try to speak beyond the narrow conﬁnes of academia. Many years in Belo Horizonte and my good friends in Minas Gerais persuaded me to see Brazil from inside out and not from the coast inward. In 1983, at a time when my academic career appeared to be stillborn, the History Department at Vanderbilt University took a chance on me, changing the trajectory of my life. I will be forever grateful to my colleagues in the department, then and now. I have beneﬁted enormously by working at an outstanding university with even more outstanding programs in Brazilian and Latin American studies. I am very fortunate to have received generous funding from a FulbrightHays Faculty Research Abroad Award (2009–2010) and a National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship (2015) to spend long periods writing intensely while living in Brazil. Sabbaticals are one of the great privileges and luxuries of the life of a professor at a major research university. Longstanding and ongoing ﬁnancial support from Vanderbilt University has been crucial throughout my career and especially in the work on this project over the past eight years. I am particularly grateful to former provost Richard McCarty for his support. Eight years ago he asked me to become the faculty director of the Ingram Scholarship Program. I began writing the ﬁrst pages of this book at the same moment I joined the program, and I am writing the closing lines as I ﬁnish my time as director. In many ways unrelated to Brazil and Gilberto Freyre, the socially and civically engaged students in the program have pushed me to think deeply about my own worldview, beliefs, and assumptions. They have taught me a great deal, and this book and the Ingram Scholars have been equally important focal points in my life for the past eight years. I am especially indebted to my two exceptional program coordinators, Anne Gordon and Bryn Sierra, for all their support and for helping me balance my teaching, research, and administrative work. I have been very fortunate to have worked at Vanderbilt University for more than three decades with a wonderful group of colleagues. The Center for Latin American Studies and the History Department are vibrant intellectual communities that have shaped my life as a scholar and teacher. The strength of the Brazilian studies program has constantly enriched my life and made it possible for me to grow. The late Alex Severino, Margo Milleret, Earl Fitz, Emanuelle Oliveira-Monte, Ben Legg, and Marcio Bahia all in their own ways helped me think and rethink cultura brasileira. Our program in Latin American history\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nxv\n\nincludes a truly wonderful and collegial group, including more than thirty graduate students over the last two decades. Jane Landers, Eddie Wright-Rios, Celso Castilho, Frank Robinson, and the late Simon Collier have been exceptional colleagues and friends. A special thanks to Joel Harrington for his support over the years, at home and abroad. While I mentored Courtney Campbell, Max Pendergraph, Tiago Maranhão, and David LaFevor in their graduate training they also pushed me to think harder about my notions of nationalism, regionalism, and identity. Graduate and undergraduate students from various departments and programs took my classes on Latin America and seminars on race, nationalism, and nation-building, and they made me think more about the comparative picture, and even read and critiqued parts of my manuscript. Yoshi Igarashi, Gary Gerstle, Paul Kramer, Michael Bess, and Helmut Smith shared their own writing and research on nationalism and national identity with the seminars on nationalism. The graduate students in the interdisciplinary Brazilian Studies Reading Group also gave me valuable criticisms of the manuscript. From 2001 to 2015, Jane Landers, Celso Castilho, and I codirected a series of FIPSECAPSE student exchange grants on race and inequalities in Brazil and the United States in collaboration with the Universidade de São Paulo, the Universidade Federal da Bahia, the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Howard University, Fisk University, and the University of Florida. The three dozen students from Vanderbilt who attended our Brazilian partner institutions and the three dozen undergraduate students from Brazil who spent a semester at Vanderbilt, in many different ways, made me reﬂect often on the complexities of race and national identity. A special thanks to Paula Covington, the incredible Latin American bibliographer at Vanderbilt. Due to Paula’s work and that of her predecessors we have one of the great collections on Brazil in our library. For many years Paula has helped me with my research and taught me to be a better researcher. Mona Frederick has made enormous contributions to the intellectual life of Vanderbilt as the executive director of the Robert Penn Warren Center for the Humanities. I spent much of my last sabbatical at the Warren Center in a year-long seminar on public scholarship with a great group of fellow faculty and had the enormous luxury of a beautiful ofﬁce where I could hide, read, write, and move this book closer to completion. Thank you, Mona. As will be evident in the text, but especially in the endnotes, I could not have written this book without the vast and excellent scholarship across\n\nxvi\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nmany disciplines, especially among those who study Brazil. For seven years (2004–2011) I served as the executive director of the Brazilian Studies Association and organized three international congresses for BRASA during that period. I cannot imagine what this book would look like, if it would even exist, had I not spent so much time collaborating in so many ways with Brazilians and Brazilianists during my time with BRASA. Um obrigado muito especial for my hardworking colleagues in leadership and support roles during those years, especially Jim Green, Tim Power, Jan French, Ken Serbin, Susan Quinlan, Peggy Sharpe, Jon Tolman, Cecilia Grespan, and Carolina Castellanos. A special thanks to Paulo Roberto de Almeida for asking me to coedit a survey of Brazilian studies in the United States that educated me extensively and resulted in two books. Talks at a number of institutions helped me formulate, reformulate, and sharpen my arguments.

Chris Dunn, Bryan McCann, and Celso Castilho read the entire manuscript and provided me with very valuable feedback, helping make this a better book than it was in manuscript form. Over the past two years I have beneﬁted from working with Liz Zechmeister, Tim Sterling, Fred Pereira, Heather Ewing, and Guilherme Russo on a healthcare study in Rio de Janeiro funded by Vanderbilt University. My colleagues in Brazil and at Vanderbilt in the project on “Building a Multi-disciplinary Approach to the Assessment of the Quality of Healthcare in Brazil” have provided me entirely new angles on race and national identity in Brazil.

This book reconstructs the story of how one myth of national identity became history. Brazilian national identity, like many other national identities, was constructed from local society up as well as from the State down. The combined and often conﬂicting efforts of the powerful and the less powerful forge peoples and nations over decades and centuries. Elites who wish to construct nations consciously seek to create a cohesive sense of national identity, solidarity, and allegiance to an articulated set of myths, rituals, and symbols. They pursue progress through order, and that order and progress hinge on the success of their attempts to impose homogeneity and uniformity. Despite their best efforts – and their power – often the plans of the nation-builders fail, either in part or in whole. The less powerful – especially the so-called masses (o povo) – quite often without setting out to do so create and shape their own myths, rituals, and symbols that sometimes reach a wide audience resonating with hundreds of thousands – even millions – of persons they have never met nor seen. This complex and dialectical process of the conscious and unconscious construction of peoples and nations through the emergence and evolution of a shared set of myths, 1\n\n2\n\nBecoming Brazilians\n\nrituals, and symbols is the focus of this book. A generation ago, Benedict Anderson brilliantly described this process as the creation of “imagined communities.”2 Becoming Brazilians charts the emergence of an “imagined community” – what Brazilian intellectuals would call an imaginário nacional (national imaginary/collective imagination) – the creation of a people, and a nation, in twentieth-century Brazil.3 Since the 1930s, the most important national myth that has bound people together in Brazil is what the anthropologist Roberto DaMatta has called the “fábula das três raças.” This fable of the three races – what I call the myth of mestiçagem (miscegenation) – asserts that Brazilians share a common history of racial and cultural mixing of Native Americans, Africans, and Europeans.4 Although he did not invent this myth, Gilberto Freyre’s exuberant and optimistic vision of mestiçagem has been its most potent and inﬂuential version. As Peter Fry has concisely noted, Freyre declared that all Brazilians “whatever their genealogical afﬁliation, were culturally Africans, Amerindians and Europeans.”5 Even those Brazilians who are not biologically mestiços are cultural hybrids. In Freyre’s own oft-quoted words, “Every Brazilian, even the light-skinned fair-haired one, carries with him in his soul, when not in body and soul . . . the shadow, or at least the birthmark, of the Indian or the Negro.”6 All Brazilians, regardless of the color of their skin, carry with them shadows in their souls, traces of Europe, Africa, and the Americas in their cultural, if not their biological, DNA.7 This is the essence of the Freyrean vision of Brazil, brasilidade (Brazilianness), and Brazilian national identity in the twentieth century. This book is a sort of cultural history of the Freyrean myth of mestiçagem. Before the publication of Freyre’s monumental The Masters and the Slaves (Casa-grande e senzala in the Portuguese original) in 1933, many Brazilian and foreign intellectuals had recognized this mixing, but very few viewed this mestiçagem favorably.8 By the 1970s and 1980s, nearly all Brazilians, at some level, shared this belief – it had become something of a “master narrative of Brazilian culture.”9 When queried about race or ancestry for surveys, most Brazilians tell the questioners they are “Brazilian.”10 Today, when 200 million Brazilians enjoy the music of Ivete Sangalo or participate in carnaval, or experience the exhilaration of their national team (seleção) winning (or losing) a World Cup, they resonate with some of the fundamental markers of Brazilian national identity – ones that are all profoundly shaped by the Freyrean vision of mestiçagem.\n\nIntroduction: Creating a People and a Nation\n\n3\n\nfigure i.1 Gilberto Freyre, 1967 Source: Photo By Jack Riddle/The Denver Post via Getty Images\n\ngilberto freyre and casa-grande e senzala Sophisticated social science research has shown that this cultural mixing in Brazil has been widespread and deep.11 People of all skin colors take part in cultural practices and activities that emerged out of European, Native American, and African societies. Perhaps most visible are the\n\n4\n\nBecoming Brazilians\n\nprofound African inﬂuences that permeate the cultural lives of Brazilians of all hues – from candomblé to capoeira and carnaval. In the words of one writer, “some Euro-Brazilians are more culturally Afro-Brazilian than some Afro-Brazilians.” African inﬂuences pervade all facets of Brazilian culture and society, leading one scholar to observe that the dominant narrative in Brazil is that no one is really white!12 As Edward Telles has shown with sophisticated statistical and analytical rigor, miscegenation is not “mere ideology” in Brazil. Race mixture has been taking place for centuries, and continues, and represents a signiﬁcant reality in the daily lives of Brazilians.13 The inﬂuence of Freyre permeates nearly every nook and corner of contemporary Brazilian culture. Even those who vehemently reject Freyre’s ideas must grapple with ways to contend with their power and inﬂuence. This book traces the emergence, maturation, and then (partial) decline of this Freyrean vision of mestiço nationalism, this imagined community of mestiçagem, of racial mixture and cultural convergence, from the 1930s to the 1990s. This book is a brief history of the most powerful narrative of Brazilian identity in the twentieth century. Decades of sustained and devastating critiques of Freyre’s notion of “racial democracy” offer paradoxical testimony to his continuing power and inﬂuence on Brazilian identity.14 The vast literature attacking racial democracy has rarely been accompanied by a rejection of Freyre’s most important assertion – that the essence of Brazil and Brazilians is this mixture of races and cultures.15 In the decades following the publication of Casa-grande e senzala, Freyre gradually made stronger and more sweeping claims that the widespread mixing of races and cultures had provided Brazil with a form of racial democracy, a society without the racial prejudice and discrimination sanctioned by law and custom in the United States and South Africa (for example).16 Ironically, Freyre did not create the term “racial democracy,” and it apparently does not even come into use until the late 1940s and the 1950s.17 Since the 1950s, this Freyrean view of racial democracy has been repeatedly attacked by scholars in multiple ﬁelds of study. While many have argued that racial democracy is some sort of false consciousness or a smoke screen fabricated by the elite to hide the racism in Brazilian society, I agree with those who have shown that few Brazilians (especially those who are darker and poorer) believe that Brazil is a racial democracy. They are fully aware of the racism they confront in their own lives, but cling to racial democracy as an ideal to aspire to – for all Brazilians.18 At the same time, the most sophisticated sociological surveys demonstrate that\n\nIntroduction: Creating a People and a Nation\n\n5\n\na majority of Brazilians cling to the Freyrean vision of mestiçagem.19 While Freyre’s vision of mestiçagem and racial democracy are interconnected, the former does not inevitably lead to the latter (although many, many writers conﬂate the two in their critiques of Freyre). One may fully embrace the notion of mixing without believing it produces racial democracy.20 I agree with Hermano Vianna’s observation: “I never believed that to value mestiçagem was synonymous with defending the idea that we live in a racial democracy.”21 This book is not about what I see as Freyre’s naïve and untenable claims about racial democracy in Brazil, but rather about how the “fable of three races” becomes so deeply embedded in popular culture and the imaginário nacional.22 The myth of mestiçagem has been more powerful, widespread, and enduring than the myth of racial democracy. Mestiçagem, however, is a protean concept.23 It allows those who wish to emphasize the cultural and racial diversity of Brazilian identity to highlight the contributions of the African and Indian to Brazilian culture. Brazilian music, cuisine, arts, language, and even sports offer for them daily evidence of the importance of non-European peoples and cultures to the formation of Brazilian society. At the same time, mestiçagem can also provide a means for those who wish to de-emphasize the African and Indian heritage of Brazilians by highlighting the waves of European immigrants as an even more powerful contributor to the cultural and racial mix that is Brazil today. In this version, mixing becomes the means for whitening (embranquecimento) Brazilian culture and biology. This vision of mestiçagem, combined with racial democracy, has been a powerful alternative to the blatant expressions of white supremacist ideology that became so potent in other societies such as the United States.24 In a sense, these two very different visions are two sides of the same coin of mestiçagem. As the following chapters show, these two very different visions, both accepting mestiçagem as central to the national narrative, are reshaped by different regions of Brazil for their own purposes. In effect, one sees mestiçagem as whitening while the other sees it as darkening Brazil. In the following chapters, I analyze how and why the tens of millions living within the political boundaries of Brazil (and many more residing beyond those borders) in the twentieth century gradually come to see themselves not only as brasileiros, but brasileiros a la Freyre.25 I argue that only in recent decades has Brazil ﬁnally become a nation, that is, a people within a deﬁned set of political borders bound together by their attachment to a common set of myths, rituals, and symbols.26 For much of\n\n6\n\nBecoming Brazilians\n\nthe twentieth century, Brazilians forged “a culture in search of nation.”27 The rise of the new technologies of radio, ﬁlm, and television – the emergence of new visual and aural cultures – made possible the creation of this “imagined community” in twentieth-century Brazil (and in other nations as well). The following chapters dissect the ongoing and constantly evolving process of “becoming Brazilians” in the twentieth century. At the heart of this analysis is the very notion of what it means to be “Brazilian” and how that identity evolves and shifts across most of the twentieth century – and continues to shift in the twenty-ﬁrst. Gilberto Freyre’s work provides the framework for the conceptualization of the Brazilians as a singular people who compose their own nation. I do not pretend to demonstrate deﬁnitively the many ways in which the technologies of mass communication have fostered the enormous reach and power of the myth of mestiçagem. In this long, interpretive essay, I lay out what I believe are the key features and processes in the creation, diffusion, success, and eventual decline of this vision of Brazilian identity. The principal goals of this essay are to offer an interpretation of twentieth-century Brazil and stimulate others to discuss, debate, challenge, and engage in much more detailed studies of the many facets of the historical trajectory I describe in this book. I am certainly not the ﬁrst to notice the importance of the new technologies for the emergence of popular culture in twentieth-century societies. Latin Americans, especially Brazilians, have not only created dynamic music, art, literature, ﬁlm, and television, but they also generated a very stimulating and innovative body of work about popular culture. Scholars in many countries over the past thirty years have produced a large literature on nationalism and national identity, and a seemingly endless number of books and articles have discussed Brazilian identity in the twentieth century. In more recent decades, a vibrant group of writers have shown how central citizenship, in its many facets, is to contemporary societies and to efforts to cultivate democratic politics – in Brazil, or elsewhere in the world. In this book, I bring these diverse stories together to show how the consolidation of a vibrant cultural nationalism constructed around the myth of mestiçagem from the 1930s to the 1980s set the stage for the rise of a dynamic civic nationalism that has fostered among tens of millions of Brazilians a vital conversation about their origins, who they are today, what they would like to become, and where they will go in the twenty-ﬁrst century.\n\nIntroduction: Creating a People and a Nation\n\n7\n\nconstructing myths, rituals, and symbols Brazilians built an extraordinary narrative unity around an exceptionally ﬂexible sense of identity. The construction of this narrative took place over many decades across two centuries. In 1822, Pedro I’s famous “Cry of Ipiranga” announced the creation of an independent Brazil free of Portuguese colonial rule. Much of the story of Brazilian history – and the Brazilian people – in the nearly two centuries after Pedro’s cry (grito) is the long (and never-ending) struggle to create a people and a nation out of an idea – to make real the newly proclaimed nation in that cry for independence.28 The great challenge for the State in constructing the Brazilian nation from the early nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century was in many ways geographical and technological – how to reach all those peoples living within the enormous, ﬂuid, and ill-deﬁned political boundaries of Brazil.29 Before becoming Brazilian, one must ﬁrst become aware of the very notion of something called Brazil. The challenge for all Brazilian nationalists was not only to create myths, rituals, and symbols, but also to make the millions of peoples of African, Native American, and European descent – and their descendants – aware of those myths, rituals, and symbols. In the terminology of Ernest Gellner, the State had to foster the nationalism that precedes the creation of the nation. Even more so than most nations, Brazil faced the daunting challenge of scale in a country of truly continental dimensions.30 I believe that the process of the creation of this set of shared myths, rituals, and symbols does not reach full fruition until the second half of the twentieth century after the emergence and expansion of the technologies of mass communication – radio, ﬁlm, and television. As Eric Hobsbawm once observed, “The common culture of any late twentieth-century urbanized country was based on the mass entertainment industry – cinema, radio, television, pop music.”31 The 1930s have long been seen as a critical turning point in modern Brazilian history with the rise of Getúlio Vargas and the increasing ability of the Brazilian State to extend its power into the vast interior of the country. At the same time, the central government begins systematically to create school curricula, museums, holidays, and national symbols to overcome the long history of regionalism and fragmentation that had characterized Brazilian society, culture, and politics since (at least) independence.32 The rise of radio in the 1930s, and then ﬁlm in the 1940s and 1950s, produces a powerful shift with the emergence of popular culture, especially popular music (samba, in particular), carnaval,\n\n8\n\nBecoming Brazilians\n\nand soccer (futebol) as shared national experiences.33 Post-1930 Brazil is a fascinating mix of the efforts of the State to impose an increasingly uniﬁed vision of “Brazilianness” (brasilidade) as a diverse set of regional symbols, music, dance, and popular culture is eventually broadcast and spread across more than 8.5 million square kilometers of national territory. The expanding mass media bring the local and the regional into the national arena – and into regular contact with each other. New technologies produced (and continue to produce) an accelerating interactive intensity of people, places, and symbols from 1920s to the present. An expanding scholarship over the past twenty years has persuasively argued that region and nation are mutually constitutive, and Brazil is an excellent example of these processes of interaction and mutual construction.34 A history of nation-building is more than the story of centralizing authority and the State; it involves a complex process of constant integration and differentiation among regions and nation. Instability and contingency characterize an ongoing and never-ending process, a constant shape shifting if you will. The imaginings of the people who at some point in time see themselves as part of a community – regional or national – are never completely ﬁxed or static. Region and nation, in these terms, are “cognitive arenas of struggle.” Rather than just ﬁxed spaces, they are “landscapes of action, of meaning, and of experience.”35 Rather than antagonistic and exclusive, the region-nationbuilding process in Brazil has largely been mutually reinforcing and interdependent. The emergence of regions in Brazil “was not just parallel with the new nationalist sentiment, but a reaction to it and another face of it.”36 Eventually, a relatively select set of myths, symbols, and rituals comes to be seen and experienced as deﬁning features not of particular regions, but of Brazil as a whole. In many ways, the regional narratives that emerged in the early twentieth century offered competing visions of Brazil, visions that made claims to authenticity, power, and hierarchy.37 As new technologies (telegraphy, telephony, radio, cinema, television) draw more and more locales into an ever larger community, the interplay among the local, regional, national, and international intensify. Earlier generations of writers often portrayed this process as largely unidirectional – the top-down imposition (beginning with Vargas) of the State dominated by elites who sought to force the Freyrean vision of Brazil on the masses. The inﬂuence and agency of the majority of Brazilians disappear in many of these accounts.38 I argue that this process of nationbuilding was not entirely State directed, nor driven simply by the desires and choices of individuals or groups.39 The result, as with all complex\n\nIntroduction: Creating a People and a Nation\n\n9\n\ncultures, is a constantly evolving mix of cultural traits that are always “hybrid,” to use the terminology of cultural studies.40 The focus of this book is on how a select group of deﬁning features that became emblematic of national identity in the twentieth century emerged, ﬂourished, and then were powerfully questioned and challenged. Their emergence was not foreordained or completely imposed from above, but arose out of a complex, protracted, highly contingent, and constant process of exchanges and conﬂicts among constituencies from all sectors of Brazilian society (and beyond).41 As Prasenjit Duara has observed, nationalism “marks the site where different representations of the nation contest and negotiate with each other.” He goes on to assert that “we ﬁnd a polyphony of voices, contradictory and ambiguous, opposing, afﬁrming, and negotiating their views of the nation.”42 State power and voices “from below” are constantly in a conﬂictual and evolving relationship that continually reﬁnes and reshapes notions of identity – local, regional, and national.43 As in many countries, this polyphony of voices created an ongoing and unending conversation about the nature of Brazilian identity. Gilberto Freyre’s portrayal of mestiçagem gradually became the dominant narrative (the dominant voice) among the contending narratives in this conversation. Intellectuals, like Freyre, frequently played the role of cultural mediators in this process.44 The emergence of radio and samba from the 1930s to the 1950s initiated the creation of what has been called a “culture industry” in Brazil creating for the ﬁrst time a shared national popular culture. The Modernists in the 1920s and 1930s played a central role in this technological and cultural shift. The so-called folkloric, popular culture of pre-twentieth-century Brazil and the supposed erudite, cosmopolitan culture of the elites had never been separate, yet they blended and reconﬁgured in increasingly creative and powerful ways with the rise of mass media technologies. “The symbioses between radio and literature, cinema and theater, and theater and television,” as Renato Ortiz has argued, “were constants.” As he has also written, the idea of traditional cultures that deﬁned the “popular classes” gave way to products, images, and festivities associated with cultural industries and the “masses.”45 The intervention of the State into the cultural arena in the same decades stimulated the creation of a “mass culture” (cultura de massas) in Brazil, but it was not until the 1960s and 1970s that a truly national community became possible. The conversation and debate about Brazilian national identity has been a long struggle over the very nature of what is deemed Brazilian culture.46 First with ﬁlm and then, more importantly, with the\n\n10\n\nBecoming Brazilians\n\nemergence of television after 1970, the technology was in place that truly stitched together the pieces of the national territory and Brazilian society to create the quilted mosaic that is Brazil today in the midst of this ongoing and never-ending conversation.47 Brian Owensby has argued that in a society that largely excluded Brazilians from civic citizenship and full political participation, popular culture offered sites of “unofﬁcial citizenship” where “people could avoid entanglements with a politics that so often excluded them.” Through samba, carnaval, and futebol (among other sites), to “be Brazilian . . . is to rise to a moral plane above the pettiness, corruptions, and exclusions of politics.”48 Brazilians, in this sense, confront the negatives of politics and its ﬂaws with the positives of participation in popular culture. In effect, Brazilians have forged an increasingly rich cultural citizenship over decades in the absence of a strong civic citizenship.49 From the 1930s to the 1970s, this growing and vibrant popular culture spawned contending forms of cultural nationalism and identity. The 1970s, largely because of opposition to the military regime that took power in 1964 and instituted brutal repressive measures, mark a turning point in the emergence of a civic nationalism and a struggle for citizenship in Brazil. These two powerful forces – civic and cultural – converge in the 1970s and 1980s, with television, futebol, and popular music as the principal vehicles facilitating the convergence. The process of becoming Brazilians – of creating one people and one nation – reaches its climax under the military regime in the 1970s and 1980s, culminating with the mass mobilization of Brazilians through the process of re-democratization, national elections in 1989, and the impeachment of President Fernando Collor in 1992. In the “direct elections now” campaign (diretas já) in 1984, and the impeachment of President Fernando Collor in 1992, tens of millions of Brazilians rallied around “their” ﬂag, national anthem, and other national symbols to claim their “rights” as Brazilians.50 They fully and forcefully assumed their civic and cultural identity as Brazilians.51 Nation and State ﬁnally converged more than a century and a half after Pedro’s declaration of independence in 1822. In the 1960s and 1970s, the military regime put into place many of the conditions for the consolidation of a shared national culture (extending State power and mass communications effectively across all of the national territory), and the climax of this sense of national belonging comes, ironically, with the massive mobilization of millions of Brazilians against the military regime in the 1980s. In one of ironies of Brazilian history, at the very moment that this modernizing project to create a sense\n\nIntroduction: Creating a People and a Nation\n\n11\n\nof national identity ﬁnally experiences its greatest success in the 1970s and 1980s, intellectuals and activists had already begun to deconstruct the meaning of identity, nation, nationalism, and modernity, and they began to proclaim the very impossibility of the modernizing project and the very notion of this version of a national identity.52 Many of them announced the death of the Freyrean vision of Brazil at the moment of its greatest inﬂuence.\n\nkey themes This book brings together a series of fundamental themes in Brazilian, Latin American, and world history – identity, nation, nationalism, modernity, citizenship, and the State. An early historiographical tradition in Latin America produced a large literature on these themes and the creation of new nations in the nineteenth century. Much of this literature served the European and Europeanized elites in the newly independent nations of Latin America in their struggle to assert control over territories largely populated by non-European peoples – Indians, Africans, and the racially mixed.53 Liberal and Conservative historiography in the nineteenth century (typiﬁed by classic works such as Domingo F. Sarmiento’s Facundo and José Enrique Rodó’s Ariel) sought to justify nation-building as a modernizing project aimed at transforming the peoples of Latin America into neo-Europeans.54 In recent decades, an entirely new wave of scholarly works has returned to the nationalism and nation-building projects of the nineteenth century to show that many peoples, not just the elites, participated in and shaped the debates, language, and processes of nation-building and nationalism. This new literature has emphasized the multiplicity of understandings – among various groups within a given country – of the foundational concepts of nation-building, liberalism, citizenship, and civic culture. The works of Florencia Mallon on Mexico and Peru, Sarah Chambers and Mark Thurner on Peru, Peter Guardino on Mexico, and Greg Grandin on Guatemala (to cite a few examples) probe the multiple meanings of nation-building and nationalism among nonelite groups.55 They have brought to the forefront of the discussion of nationbuilding and nationalism the importance of diverse groups within civil society and across regions within nations all playing a role in a growing conversation about ideas and ideologies. This is important work, but it has largely focused on the nineteenth century, and the nation-building projects in Latin America in the century after independence largely failed, became twisted beyond recognition, or died stillborn.\n\n12\n\nBecoming Brazilians\n\nAs Miguel Angel Centeno has eloquently argued, the elites who triumphed in the wars for independence “had no desire to imagine a national community” and “the inclusion and integration of the masses was the last thing on their mind.” In most of Latin America, the Europeanizing projects of elites eradicated, persecuted, and stigmatized non-European cultures and peoples. By their very nature, the projects were incapable of forging uniﬁed nations ﬁlled with peoples of very diverse ethnic, racial, and cultural traditions. When faced with the question, “que hacer con el pueblo?” (what to do with the people?), elites chose exclusion and persecution over the inclusion and mobilization necessary for creating national communities.56 Even in Argentina and Uruguay, the two most ethnically “European” countries in Latin America, the modernizing projects to build nations often ignored peoples within their own borders who did not ﬁt into the elitist narratives of nationhood.57 At the dawn of the twentieth century, contrary to the classic arguments of Benedict Anderson, the “Creole Pioneers” of nineteenth-century Latin America had largely failed to forge imagined communities that even remotely coincided with their supposed national political boundaries. In Brazil, and much of Latin America, it is in the decades after World War I and the Great Depression that some of the many nation-building projects originally imagined in the nineteenth century ﬁnally came to fruition.58 The dream of many of those nineteenth-century Liberals and Conservatives – to create a shared culture that spanned the national territory – did not become a reality until well into the twentieth century – and in ways that would probably have appalled most of them.59 The many voices converge around a set of shared symbols and myths that come to deﬁne many Latin American nations – from Mexico to Brazil. Ironically, the foundational myth of many of these nations was the very racial and cultural mixture (mestizaje/mestiçagem) that the Creole Pioneers (such as Sarmiento) had attempted to annihilate and eradicate with their European visions of cultural modernity.60 The great touchstone of discussion about nation-building and nationalism for the past three decades has been Benedict Anderson’s Imagined Communities (1983), one of the most widely read academic books of all time. Historians of Latin America have been both pleased and perplexed by Anderson’s work. The Creole Pioneer elites who led the wars for independence and the creation of the new nations in the nineteenth century serve as the centerpiece of his argument bringing Latin America to the forefront of discussions of nationalism – discussions that for too long have been dominated by the European experience. Nevertheless, as\n\nIntroduction: Creating a People and a Nation\n\n13\n\nmany scholars of Latin America have pointed out, Anderson’s (mis)understanding of the Creoles was largely based on a few very traditional and dated sources.61 Ironically, Anderson’s analysis of this group situated at the core of his argument has been seriously critiqued by historians of Latin America even while many still embrace the gist of his notion of “imagined communities.” Anderson’s work places great emphasis on the creation of a literate, print culture and Creoles as the precursor of these imagined communities in the nineteenth century.62 I argue that in Brazil, and much of Latin America, the creation of these imagined communities does not occur through print culture in the nineteenth century (except among a small group of European elites and groups most closely connected to them), but rather these communities emerge in the mid-twentieth century out of visual and aural cultures.63 Territories, argues Muniz de Albuquerque, are image based. “They arrive to us in channels – the media, education, social contacts, habits – cultural channels that encourage an abstraction of the real. In this way, history resembles theater, on which actors, historical agents, may create their forms of identity only through the markers of the past, through accepted and recognized roles, old masks that are forever updated.”64 It is the rise of radio, ﬁlm, and television that make possible the creation of a “community” of tens of millions of Brazilians and eventually allows them to “imagine” themselves as part of a Brazilian people and a Brazilian nation.65 Nationalism in Latin America provides peoples with an “idiom of identity,” but this idiom is more aural and visual than print.66 Over the last thirty years or so, nationalism and nation-building have generated a substantial and stimulating literature. Much of this work grapples with how to deﬁne State, nation, nationalism, modernity, citizenship, and identity.67 The rise of subaltern studies and a dynamic group of South Asian scholars has also provoked a move away from the Eurocentrism of much of the earlier work on nationalism.68 As this literature has proliferated, the central concepts have become even less clear and more contested. Without going into a prolonged discussion of this literature, let me simply set out what I mean by the concepts that are central to this book. As the sociologist Craig Calhoun has pointed out, there is no generally accepted deﬁnition of something as fundamental to the contemporary world as “nation.”69 Scholars such as Anthony D. Smith, Ernest Gellner, and E. J. Hobsbawm (to cite three of the classics) each have their own list of features. In this book, I deﬁne a nation as a people within a deﬁned set of political borders bound together by\n\n14\n\nBecoming Brazilians\n\ntheir attachment to a common set of myths, rituals, and symbols. That shared culture – of myths, rituals, and symbols – forms the core of their identity as a people and a nation. As these people leave the national territory, they also carry with them their attachment to this identity, even as they add others. This imagined community is constantly changing, evolving, with moments of cohesion as well as conﬂict. Nothing is preordained (or primordial) about these communities, and their creation as well as their survival over time is contingent on many factors. In the case of Brazil, the State precedes the nation and the “ﬁt” between the two is always complex and fraught with conﬂict.70 The vibrant literature that has appeared over the last thirty years emphasizes, as I will, that nations are cultural constructs that make claims to a collective identity, social solidarity, and the integration of the individual into membership in the whole. “Nationalism has become,” in the words of Lloyd Kramer, “the most widespread, inﬂuential political and cultural idea in the modern world because it gives people powerful stories to help them explain the meaning of their lives.”71 Nationalism, as Calhoun writes, is a discourse, a project, and an “ethical imperative.” The discourse seeks to frame a version of identity, the project strives to mobilize the population around that shared identity, and the imperative heightens the sense of national identity versus the “other.” In twentiethcentury Brazil, the Freyrean version of Brazilian identity becomes the dominant and “ofﬁcial” project. Although this identity clearly distinguishes the Brazilians from other peoples and nations, the lack of strong xenophobia in this project is striking. Nationalism, as I use it in my analysis, is an “expression of the desire among people who believe they have a common ancestry and a common destiny to govern themselves in a place peculiarly identiﬁed with their history and its fulﬁllment.”72 Prior to the emergence of the Brazilian nation, or other nations, people understood themselves and their lives in relation to their family, kin, villages, and locales. Scholars of nationalism continue to debate whether nationalism is a product of the modern world (or, in fact, created the modern world), but most place its emergence in the “age of revolutions” in the Atlantic world in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.73 Much ink has been spilt over whether nations and nationalism are constructs of the modern world or not and over ethnic versus civic nationalism. I will not enter into this debate, largely because it seems to me irrelevant in the case of Brazil (and for that matter, most of the Americas). Unlike so many peoples of the Old World (or even Mexico), Brazilians lay\n\nIntroduction: Creating a People and a Nation\n\n15\n\nno claims to some ancient ethnic identity. Brazil’s cultural nationalism has been intimately connected with the construction of a new “ethnic” identity forged in the Americas since 1500 rather than an appeal to an ancient one rooted in the Old World (or the New).74 The dominant form of nationalism that emerges in twentieth-century Brazil is cultural rather than civic (until the very late twentieth century). As Renato Ortiz has pointed out, “The inability of Brazilian society to create national civic myths was due to a lack of a consciousness of citizenship.”75 While the great mass of Brazilians struggled throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth century to make claims to citizenship, their efforts in the civic arena were much less successful than in the cultural arena. Through their shared popular culture, Brazilians participate in the idea of the nation.76 As Chapter 1 explains, this was especially true in the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century. I argue (in Chapter 7) that in the last quarter of the century, cultural nationalism and an emerging civic nationalism converge in ways that transform Brazilians’ sense of their own identity. The ﬂawed nature of citizenship in contemporary Brazil, however, remains a serious problem in what is now the world’s fourth largest democracy. The debates over Brazilian national identity in the twentieth century are bound up intimately with notions of modernity. In the nineteenth century, Brazilian (and other Latin American) elites strove to remake their new countries in the image of Europe. For these elites, “modern” equaled “European.”77 Argentina and Uruguay offer the most telling versions of this striving for modernity (a la Europe). Both Sarmiento and Rodó are emblematic of generations of Eurocentric “Creoles” who selfconsciously strove to remake their American societies into their idealized visions of Europe (especially France and England): educated, urban, industrial, technologically sophisticated, and white. It is no coincidence that these two iconic “Latin American” intellectuals lived and wrote in the two countries of the region most profoundly shaped by postcolonial European immigration. Their intellectual counterparts in Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, the Andes, and Brazil lived and wrote in strikingly different, much more mestiço societies. For Brazilian intellectuals, modernity and Modernism carry complex meanings.78 By World War I, a Brazilian form of Modernism had emerged that consciously rejected the Eurocentric Modernism of Rodó and other Spanish American writers. In the 1920s, Brazilian Modernism emerged as a movement that explicitly and loudly proclaimed Brazil’s cultural independence from Europe.79 A “modern” Brazil, for these avant-garde artists and writers, was a nation that recognized and\n\n16\n\nBecoming Brazilians\n\nfigure i.2 Candido Portinari, “Entry into the Forest,” Mural, Hispanic Reading Room, Library of Congress Source: Photo by Hart Preston/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images\n\ncelebrated its mixed indigenous, African, and European heritage, but was also technologically, scientiﬁcally, and industrially advanced. This modernist movement became the crucible of the emergence of the dominant narrative of Brazilian national identity in the twentieth century. Many of these Modernists were the children of the political and economic elites. Initially the critics of the mainstream Brazilian cultural elite, by the 1940s many of the Modernists had become key ﬁgures in the government and the “ofﬁcial” arbiters of national culture. They had become functionaries of the State.80 The multiplicity of meanings and plasticity of “modernity” in Brazil is striking. The Modernists of the early twentieth century sought modernity in a “return” to the “traditional” and “authentic” in their own society. Their search took them to the traditions and customs of the popular classes, in particular, those of African and mestiço descent. As Florencia Garramuño has brilliantly argued, for the Brazilian Modernists, “primitivism functioned as a kind of bridge between copying the European avant-garde and discovering Brazil.”81 While the elites of the nineteenth century sought to\n\nIntroduction: Creating a People and a Nation\n\n17\n\ncreate myths of nationhood by turning to the heroes and events of the wars for independence, the Modernists found the essence of Brazilian identity and nationalism in the cultural and social processes of the colonial era, especially the indigenous and African past. They sought to “recover” the “authentic” customs of the past to transform them into the foundations of national identity in the modern world. Throughout the twentieth century, many Brazilian intellectuals have marveled at the capacity of their society to blend the modern and the traditional, at the creation of a popular culture that draws on both. In the words of Ruben George Oliven, a “peculiarity of Brazilian society lies precisely in its capacity to take on those aspects of modernity that are of interest to it and to transform them into something suited to its own needs, in which the modern interacts with the traditional.”82\n\nmodernism The Brazilian Modernists of the early twentieth century saw themselves as participants in the latest and most advanced stage of Western history. They were, after all, an avant-garde. Like the nation-builders of nineteenth-century Latin America, they admired and respected the cultural, political, and economic accomplishments of the Europeans – especially the French, English, and Germans. Unlike their predecessors, they explicitly rejected the slavish Eurocentrism and “bourgeois” worldview of their parents’ and grandparents’ generations. They aspired to be modern, but modern Brazilians, not modern Europeans. They embraced the fruits of economic and political modernization while sharing with European Modernists skepticism about the values of bourgeois culture. Many of these Modernists eventually became the cultural managers of the State by the 1930s and 1940s, and like their nineteenth-century precursors, they sought to craft a modern State and nation using the tools produced by economic modernization.83 They became cultural engineers of Brazilian nation-building. A contemporary of the Modernists, but more closely allied with the cause of the so-called Regionalists, Gilberto Freyre turned to the folkways of the Northeast.84 While the Modernists were more closely identiﬁed with Brazil’s Southeast (especially Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Minas Gerais), the Regionalists were most notably from the Northeast (especially Pernambuco and Bahia). Although there was overlap and crossfertilization between the Modernists and Regionalists, the latter group had a much more conservative and backward-looking vision. Much like\n\n18\n\nBecoming Brazilians\n\ntheir contemporaries in the U.S. South, these Northeastern intellectuals wished to deﬁne their region within the nation and to emphasize its heritage and traditions.85 They produced poetry, novels, plays, and essays that (much like Southern U.S. literature during the same period) energized and enriched Brazilian literature. The tensions and interactions among these two movements stretched across the rest of the twentieth century and reﬂected the dynamic tensions among the multiple narratives of regional and national identity.86 Paradoxically, regionalism and nationalism emerged in the 1920s and 1930s in an ongoing dance of symbols, or in a series of “symbolic battles,” to quote Pierre Bourdieu.87 The regions that have become so stereotypical in Brazil, even to the point of ofﬁcial sanctiﬁcation by government agencies at the state and national level, took shape most notably in the Northeast (especially Recife and Salvador), Rio Grande do Sul, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo. Just as at the national level, multiple narratives competed at the regional level. Was the “Northeast” the vision of those in Recife, Salvador, the backlands, Ceará? Who would deﬁne gaúcho identity in the South? At the same time, paulistas, mineiros, and cariocas grappled with just what distinguished them from other Brazilians. Lúcia Lippi Oliveira has shown how these contending and contested regional narratives took shape and provide a variety of alternatives for those seeking to deﬁne Brazilian national identity. Although the central State under Getúlio Vargas attempted after 1930 to determine the outcome of the struggle among narratives, once again, the process was much more nuanced and complex than the once dominant interpretation of top-down, hegemonic control asserted in the past. Lippi Oliveira shows that each one of these regional identities contributed to the national conversation and the formation of national identities.88 As much of the literature on nation-building and nationalism asserts, in Brazil, the State precedes the nation.89 Out of the collapse of the colonial Iberian regimes in the 1810s and 1820s, the Creole elites seized control of the remnants of Bourbon and Braganza imperial political authority and labored to reshape that power to support national regimes and institutions in what would become some seventeen new countries by the 1850s. Those remnants of the imperial regime formed the core of the most basic functions of any State – the administration of public goods and a claim to a legitimate monopoly on violence. Nearly all the new Latin American countries struggled with reasserting the authority of the State in the aftermath of the destruction of the old bonds of imperial, monarchical authority. The power of the State in the nineteenth century rarely extended very\n\nIntroduction: Creating a People and a Nation\n\n19\n\nfar beyond the hinterlands of the main cities and towns, and when it did, it was often exercised by powerful landowners and their kinship networks. One of the great challenges in constructing Brazil was to make the State and the nation visible for the millions within the country’s presumed political borders.90 In contrast to the popular view that the State in Latin America has long been powerful and dominating, I agree with Miguel Centeno’s assessment that States in Latin America have historically been large, ineffective, and unable physically to integrate society until well into the twentieth century. These States have often been despotic in relation to civil society, yet weak in their institutional capacity and ability to implement decisions. Their power has been “shallow and contested” for much of the past two centuries.91 In Brazil, the “permanent institutional core of political authority” takes shape during three centuries of Portuguese colonialism and the leaders of the independence movement seize control of the State apparatus in the 1820s. Unlike their Spanish American counterparts, the Brazilian elites had the advantage of an independence transition led by the Braganza crown prince, and then his son.92 However weak the State in Brazil, it was committed to the preservation and expansion of slavery and the maintenance of a profoundly unequal social hierarchy as two of the principal pillars of the new nation.93 The challenge, as with all nation-builders, was to use the power of the State to create a nation out of a national project – to construct a nationstate. As Gellner points out, two persons are of “the same nation if and only if they share the same culture, where culture in turn means a system of ideas and signs and associations and ways of behaving and communicating.”94 Nationalism is the political program to create the nation. This requires the ability to construct a social framework to project and attempt to inculcate into the targeted population a common set of myths, rituals, and symbols – a form of secular religion.95 Ultimately, the objective is to create “a socially integrated body.”96 Elites attempt to do this through the power of the State to educate, conscript, and imprison, and through control of the media (to cite some of the most obvious instruments). I will emphasize in this interpretation that while the efforts of the State are fundamental, they are also sometimes ineffectual and, at other times, reshaped by unanticipated movements in various sectors of society and “from below.”97 The State is not simply an autonomous apparatus of power controlled by the elites to subject the masses. In the twentieth century, the State and popular culture are interpenetrating, interconnected, and inseparable. While those with great power may hold more cards than those large numbers of peoples with little power, their\n\n20\n\nBecoming Brazilians\n\nlives and destinies affect each other and the inﬂuence does not ﬂow one way. The shaping of Brazilian identity is a multidimensional and multifoci process that cannot be simpliﬁed (as it was so often in the past) to State or cultural hegemony.98 Throughout the twentieth century, State and nation have shaped and reshaped each other in Brazil operating in parallel, both reinforcing and, at times, undermining each other.99 As the sections on television show, in particular, new media of mass communication completely alter our notions of “cultural hegemony,” “cultural imperialism,” and unidirectional shaping of culture. The State and powerful ﬁrms that control mass communications cannot, and do not, simply shape ideas and identities. The creation and diffusion of the Freyrean vision of Brazilian identity from the 1930s to the 1990s was an increasingly interactive and intense process made possible by the rise of mass media.100 The State, as Prasenjit Duara has noted, is never able to eliminate alternative constructions of the nation.101 The end goal of nationalism, quite explicitly, is to create homogeneity and the submission of the individual to the collective. It is the effort to impose a single narrative over all other competing narratives of region and nation. In twentieth-century Brazil, this nationalist project ultimately becomes the creation of a particular version of the “povo brasileiro,” the Brazilian people. This povo – this new ethnicity created out of the collision of three peoples – are the inhabitants of the Brazilian nation.102 The reemergence of nationalism and studies of national identity since the 1970s has provoked something of an intellectual countercurrent of scholars contesting the very notions of nationality and national identity. The emergence of Atlantic world history, the ﬁeld of African diaspora studies, and a growing emphasis on transnational work have all led to sustained criticisms of the focus on nations and the national focus.103 While I appreciate these critiques, I see no reason to abandon the nation as a unit of analysis, studies of national identity, or nationalism. Each is a different lens offering views into the human experience and they are not necessarily mutually exclusive. As this book clearly demonstrates, Brazilian nationalism and identity have always been forged out of inﬂuences emerging within the political boundaries of Brazil and from outside – from North America, Europe, Africa, and even Asia. To separate the “national” and the “transnational” as competing analytical approaches is both unproductive and unnecessary. Amartya Sen has eloquently pointed out that everyone has multiple, multilayered identities – as citizens of nations, states, regions, kinship groups, genders, sexualities, and organizations, just to cite a few of the\n\nIntroduction: Creating a People and a Nation\n\n21\n\npossibilities. “Socially,” Serge Gruzinski reminds us, “a person constantly deals with a galaxy of individuals, each of whom has multiple identities.”104 Communities are dynamic and constantly in ﬂux composed simultaneously of coherence, integration, contradictions, divisions, and ambivalence. To be Brazilian does not mean one cannot also see oneself as a carioca, paulista, gaúcho, mineiro, or a citizen of other nations simultaneously.105 Unlike personal identity, collective identities are “constructed out of a synchronic web of afﬁliations and sentiments,” and they express “individuals’ sense of belonging within a society or community.”106 As this book shows, one of the great paradoxes of recent Brazilian nationalism (and other nationalisms as well) is the resurgence of regional identity formation parallel and in conjunction with the powerful centralizing push of the Brazilian State to forge a single national identity.107 As the conversation about national identity develops after the 1930s, other conversations about regional identities also take shape. As those from Minas Gerais forge a strong sense of mineiridade, those from Rio Grande do Sul become gaúchos, paulista identity emerges in São Paulo, and nordestino (northeasterner) identity takes shape, all of these various regional narratives are contested and contest national narratives.108 These regional identities take shape in a complex interaction with narratives of national identity and their “architects resided at the periphery as much as at the center.”109 As Barbara Weinstein has noted, Brazil in the early twentieth century “provides a compelling historical example of a period that witnessed both resurgent regionalism and emergent nationalism.”110 Being Brazilian is one of many identities, at times the most important of those identities, but not to the exclusion of the others. In the words of an eminent U.S. historian, David Potter, loyalty to the nation “ﬂourishes not by challenging and overpowering all other loyalties, but by subsuming them all and keeping them in a reciprocally supportive relationship to one another.”111 National identity is constantly contested and reconstructed over generations. As Stuart Hall has argued, identity “is always constructed through memory, fantasy, narrative and myth. Cultural identities are . . . the unstable points of identiﬁcation or suture, which are made within the discourses of history and culture. Not an essence but a positioning.”112 In this book, I am not trying to “deﬁne” Brazilian identity, rather I am examining how a constellation of rituals and symbols that most Brazilians see as quintessentially Brazilian (a collective solidarity) have come to be seen that way.113 I show how, over decades, what it means to be Brazilian emerges, evolves, and is constructed and\n\n22\n\nBecoming Brazilians\n\nreconstructed – how this identity is created out of contesting myths, rituals, and symbols. A set of beliefs – myths, to use the anthropological terminology – undergirds these rituals and symbols. Saying they are myths does not imply that they are not “true.” I use this term in the anthropological sense – as ordered systems of social thought that embody the fundamental perceptions of a people about their social life.114 They are beliefs that most citizens, at some level, see as deﬁning the nation and its people. As Brian Owensby has put it, “the nation has represented a kind of sacred space premised on the incorporation and neutralization of historical time.” Our myths are “true stories” located outside of historical time.115 In the United States, for example, the belief in liberty, equality, and opportunity for all is one of the most cherished national myths. Although most in the United States ﬁrmly adhere to this belief, we know that not all are free, nor treated equally, and opportunity does not come for everyone. Yet, these beliefs remain at the core of what it means to be an American. Myths “can also be used to valorize the discontinuity between present and past, making the idea of history more plausible and appealing.”116 In this sense, myths are not only our beliefs, but also our dreams, aspirations, and ideals.117 The construction of Brazilian identity in the twentieth century, like the construction of identity in other nations, is not only a process of constructing myths, but also of what Ernst Renan called a process of “selective forgetting.”118 Perhaps the most notorious example of this cultural amnesia is Freyre’s version of mestiçagem, an interpretation of Brazilian history that downplays the violence, struggle, and pain millions of people experienced in centuries of racial and cultural mixing in a society built on slavery, the slave trade, the subjugation of indigenous peoples, and the repression that kept powerful landowners and merchants in control of a society composed overwhelmingly of poor, rural peoples. The distinguished historian Edmund Morgan eloquently observed in his study of the formation of the United States, “Government requires makebelieve. Make believe that the king is divine, make believe that he can do no wrong or make believe that the voice of the people is the voice of God . . . Make believe that all men are equal or make believe that they are not.” He goes on to argue that, “The political world of make-believe mingles with the real world in strange ways, for the make believe world may often mold the real one. In order to be viable, in order to serve its purpose, whatever that purpose may be, a ﬁction must bear some resemblance to fact.” The success of governments in Brazil, as in the United States, “requires the acceptance of ﬁctions, requires the willing suspension\n\nIntroduction: Creating a People and a Nation\n\n23\n\nof disbelief.”119 As Gilberto Freyre’s origin myth of Brazilian society became the dominant narrative of Brazilian identity in the mid-twentieth century, a succession of Brazilian governments strove to persuade all Brazilians that this ﬁction depicted Brazilian reality.\n\ndecline of the freyrean vision Ironically, at the very moment of the greatest success of the Freyrean vision of Brazil, as this central mythology had become so deeply entwined in the very fabric of thought in all sectors and all social classes within Brazil, the vision’s hold on many Brazilians began to erode and decline. The assault on this vision comes principally from two prominent directions – an intellectual elite and increasingly vocal groups within civil society organized around black (negro) and Afro-Brazilian identity.120 Although black consciousness movements (movimento negro) had started to appear in Brazil in the nineteenth century and achieved substantial visibility in the 1940s and 1950s, a more sustained and growing movement began to take shape in the 1970s and 1980s.121 The crystallizing moment, in many ways, was the centenary of the abolition of slavery in 1988, a moment of celebration (from the point of view of the Brazilian government) and a moment for reconsideration (from the point of view of many of these Afro-Brazilian groups). While the government promoted a multitude of conferences, commemorations, and events, black consciousness groups advocated and promoted something of a countercommemoration. (This moment in Brazil bears strong resemblance to the 1992 quincentennial commemorations/counter-commemorations in the United States of the landmark voyage of Christopher Columbus as well as Modern Art Week in Brazil in 1922.)122 Over the past thirty years, the push for black consciousness (conciência negra) and the forceful critique of Brazil as a racially blended society have produced a sustained challenge to the Freyrean vision of Brazil as a society with one ethnicity, one people – of all Brazilians as mestiços. In a sense, this is a ﬁctive ethnicity, one that for many, if not most, Brazilians is not genetic or biological. They do not have to carry the genes of indigenous and African peoples in their bodies. They carry the shadows of these peoples in their souls. The late nineteenth-century conception of race as a biological entity, however, experienced an ironic resurgence in the late twentieth century. The white and black races that were essentialized by the spurious science of the late nineteenth century condemning the latter to inferiority and glorifying the former as the rulers of the earth has\n\n24\n\nBecoming Brazilians\n\nreemerged in novel ways in the last generation. Rather than moving away from these essential categories of race, many black activists have returned to them as a means to build solidary movements. They employ what might be called a “strategic essentialism.” Increasingly, the black consciousness groups from civil society have argued that Brazil is not a complex color continuum, but rather simply a bipolar society – of those who are “white” and those who are not. For these groups, Gilberto Freyre does not represent the afﬁrmation of the African contribution to Brazilian culture. To the contrary, for them, Freyre annihilates “African” identity in Brazil and incorporates it into mainstream “white” culture. In afﬁrming their black, African ancestry, these groups reject the myth of a “povo brasileiro,” of a single Brazilian ethnicity. They return to the biological notion that any person with “African” ancestry is black.123 The most visible example of this struggle in the past two decades has been the intense debate in Brazil over afﬁrmative action, a debate that goes to the heart of what it means to be Brazilian.124 What this debate over “race” has too often failed to grasp is that the essence of Freyre’s vision was not simply biology and phenotype, but rather culture (shadows in the soul). The ﬂuidity of phenotype may be fundamental to Brazilian society, but Freyre’s most important contribution to the narrative of national identity was his assertion that all Brazilians, regardless of the color of their skin, carry with them the cultural mestiçagem that deﬁnes the formation of the nation. For Freyre, culture trumps biology.125 The other major challenge to the Freyrean vision comes from intellectual and cultural elites. On a global scale, at the very moment that nationalism reemerged with a vengeance in the late twentieth century, intellectuals around the world had already begun to deconstruct “nation” and “nationalism.”126 From South Asia to Europe to the Americas, powerful critiques have taken apart the “narratives” of nationalism and nation. The very notion of national identity has come under systematic and relentless criticism. With the rise of transnational history, globalization, and interdisciplinarity within the academy, the very notion that one can write about nations and national identities is now considered suspect.127 Brazilians and Brazilianists over the past two decades have (like their intellectual counterparts in other areas of the world) systematically attacked the very notion of national identity and the existence of a Brazilian identity. What this interpretive book attempts is not to claim that there is some “essence” of Brazilian national identity that we can identify and delineate.128 Rather I seek to recover (to historicize in the language of\n\nIntroduction: Creating a People and a Nation\n\n25\n\ncultural studies) how people in twentieth-century Brazil develop a consciousness of Brazilianness (brasilidade) and how that consciousness is principally deﬁned (in their eyes) by the Freyrean mythology. We can see this consciousness in what I call the “national conversation” about brasilidade across the twentieth century. Many voices from all sectors of society participate in this conversation. By the middle of the century, the dominant voices in this conversation invoke the myths, symbols, and rituals associated with Freyre’s visions of mestiçagem. While it is the dominant voice and narrative, it is never the view of every single individual in Brazil, yet it is for much of the second half of the century the most powerful and pervasive narrative of Brazilian identity across regions and social classes. Its power and dominance are very much in question at the beginning of the twenty-ﬁrst century. By historicizing this dominant narrative of Brazilian identity, we see how such identity narratives are transitory and ephemeral, even if able to endure for long periods. In Brazil, as in many nations, there are many competing narratives of national identity and however dominant any one of them, no narrative ever achieves universal resonance. The great dream of nation-builders to homogenize and completely integrate all its inhabitants into one people is ultimately a utopian chimera. Numerous authors have argued that Freyre “invented Brazil.”129 This is an old argument. This essay argues that Freyre invented one vision of Brazil, a powerful narrative that gradually triumphed over all others as the dominant perception of brasilidade. What I try to show in this book is how a sense of Brazilian culture emerges that is widespread, pervasive, and powerful, but transitory. As Renato Ortiz has also noted, one of the striking features of Brazilian society has been the longstanding intermingling of “erudite” (“high”) and “popular” (“low”) culture.130 This cultural intermingling is at the heart of this book. Moreover, culture is never static; it is always shifting and changing. The myths, rituals, and symbols that are so foundational for the Freyrean vision – mestiçagem as a cultural positive, samba, the classic carnaval of Rio de Janeiro, futebol – did not exist in 1880. They begin to blossom by the 1930s. The Freyrean vision takes off in the 1930s, gains power in the 1940s and 1950s, is ascendant in the 1960s and 1970s, and then begins its decline in the 1980s onward. This is the story of the rise and relative decline of one version of national identity, one that become enormously inﬂuential and pervasive, even dominant (for a time). Deﬁning Brazilian identity in the middle of the twenty-ﬁrst century, no doubt, will involve another set of myths, rituals, and symbols.\n\n26\n\nBecoming Brazilians\n\nThe rise and relative fall of Gilberto Freyre’s vision accompanies the larger, structural changes across twentieth-century Brazilian history. Modernism, cultural nationalism, and the Freyrean vision all emerge in the 1920s and 1930s as a “modern” Brazil emerged out of a rural society, a coffee economy, and an intellectual discourse dominated by scientiﬁc racism. The upheavals of the 1920s – the tenente revolts, the emergence of socialism, an urban labor movement, Modernism – and the Revolution of 1930 mark the pivotal “moment” in the birth of modern Brazil. By the 1940s and 1950s, the emergence of an intelligentsia committed to national development (from the ideological left to the right), and a State that increasingly intervened to promote industrialization, helped produce an increasingly urban, industrial, and integrated nation. In the 1960s and 1970s, this developmental nationalism reached its limits under an authoritarian, military regime that ofﬁcially endorsed Freyre’s vision of mestiçagem and his claims that Brazil was a racial democracy. In the last two decades of the twentieth century, the emergence of the neoliberal economic wave, globalization, and the critiques of the Freyrean vision all converged to mark the end of the developmental nationalism that had emerged in the era of Getúlio Vargas and blossomed in the postwar decades. By the 1990s, an increasingly fragmented intelligentsia, a growing and restive civil society, and a weakened nation-state marked the end of a historical period when the creation of a national identity constructed around a dominant narrative not only seemed possible, but close to realization.131 The last decade of the twentieth century also marks the emergence of a new technological era – of the Internet and global digital communications – that make the 1990s the logical terminus for my analysis.\n\nan overview of the book This book is an interpretive essay that aims to stimulate further research on the many aspects of Brazilian national identity, nationalism, citizenship, and media that I bring together in my analysis. Rather than a comprehensive case for the argument, this book brings together work from a wide variety of ﬁelds and disciplines in ways that suggest new angles on Brazilian identity. The essay consists of nine parts: an introduction, seven chapters, and an epilogue. Chapter 1, “From the ‘Spectacle of Races’ to ‘Luso-Tropical Civilization,’” lays out for the reader the context of Brazilian history from independence to the early twentieth century focusing on the role of the State, regionalism, patrimonialism, and\n\nIntroduction: Creating a People and a Nation\n\n27\n\npolitics. At the core of the chapter is an overview of social thought in Brazil from the late nineteenth to the early twentieth century, in particular, a discussion about race and national identity. The ﬁnal section introduces the work of Gilberto Freyre, his vision of mestiçagem, and the debates over race and identity in the 1930s. The following chapter, “Communicating and Understanding Mestiçagem: Radio, Samba, and Carnaval,” turns to the ﬁrst stage in the popularization of Freyre’s vision with the rise of radio, samba, and “domestication” of carnaval in Rio de Janeiro. I explore the emerging tension and dynamic between the planned efforts of the State (especially under Getúlio Vargas) to construct a coherent and hegemonic vision of brasilidade and the unplanned, constantly shifting tides of popular culture and tastes. This creative and dynamic tension can be seen in the emergence of samba and its consecration as an “authentic” and “national” form of music and the gradual reshaping of carnaval in Rio de Janeiro. Chapter 3, “Visualizing Mestiçagem: Literature, Film, and the Mulata,” focuses on the rise of popular cinema and how it functions as the second wave of mass communication as a vehicle for the national conversation about Brazilian identity from the 1930s to the 1980s. While radio provides the aural culture for this conversation, ﬁlm contributes a very powerful visual culture, in particular, for the communication of the Freyrean vision via the novels of Jorge Amado and their ﬁlm incarnations. At the heart of this vision of Freyre and Amado is the sensual mulata. Ironically, Carmen Miranda (in the 1930s and 1940s) and Sonia Braga (in the 1970s and 1980s) – two light-skinned women – became the iconic images of the blending of African and Portuguese cultures that Freyre placed at the center of mestiçagem. Chapter 4, “‘Globo-lizing’ Brazil: Televising Identity,” moves to the third wave of technological transformation, the emergence and proliferation of television broadcasting, in a period dominated by Rede Globo. With its ability to connect with virtually all the inhabitants of Brazil, Globo became the most powerful force in the shaping of a shared set of national myths, rituals, and symbols after 1970. In close collaboration with the military regime, Globo wielded an enormous power in communicating the regime’s ofﬁcial version of the Freyrean vision. The focus of this chapter is the Jornal Nacional (Globo’s evening news broadcast), telenovelas, and futebol beginning in the late 1960s. As with radio and ﬁlm, we see the ongoing tension and dynamic as the State (and its instrument) attempts to impose a hegemonic vision on all Brazilians, yet it is never able to control or direct the rich and creative movements that emerge out of popular culture. Television became central\n\n28\n\nBecoming Brazilians\n\nto the lives of nearly all Brazilians by the 1980s and served as a powerful creator and mediator of popular culture. Given the importance of futebol (especially as shown on television after 1970), Chapter 5, “The Beautiful Game: Performing the Freyrean Vision,” departs from the technological waves of the previous three chapters (radio, ﬁlm, television) to delve more deeply into what has been perhaps the most potent instrument of identity formation in twentiethcentury Brazil. The success and appeal of futebol, and Brazil’s unprecedented triumphs in the international arena, provided an extraordinary stage for performing the Freyrean vision. Many Brazilians (and foreigners) saw in the faces of the players and their style of play, especially those on the national team, the living imprint of Freyre’s claims. The phenomenal success of Brazil – World Cup victories in 1958, 1962, 1970 – and the roles of players such as Garrincha and Pelé, seemed to conﬁrm that Brazil was the land of racial and cultural mixture and that mestiçagem produced results that conﬁrmed the nation’s exuberance and greatness. As Roberto DaMatta has so eloquently written, futebol also became the vehicle for the convergence of cultural and civic nationalisms in late-twentieth-century Brazil. Chapter 6, “The Sounds of Cultural Citizenship,” returns to popular music to show how (along with futebol) it offers the most important forum for the conversation about national identity in Brazil in the second half of the century. Popular music in the decades after 1960 both reﬂects and shapes the multiple narratives about Brazilian identity on a truly national scale and plays a central role in the emergence of cultural and political citizenship by the 1970s and 1980s. Chapter 7, “Culture, Identity, and Citizenship,” brings the arc of the Freyrean vision to its downward turn by the 1980s and 1990s as intellectuals declared any national identity as illusory, and as they and many emerging AfroBrazilian groups denounced the Freyrean vision as racist and false. The recent struggle for afﬁrmative action in Brazil vividly illustrates the weakening of the Freyrean vision and its relative decline as the dominant narrative of national identity. Ironically, this critique of Freyre emerges just as the transition from dictatorship to democracy mobilizes tens of millions of Brazilians to rally consciously around a sense of brasilidade, but one based not only a cultural identity, but also a civic identity built around access to civic and political rights and citizenship. I argue that the decades of cultural nationalism constructed around the Freyrean vision helped make possible the emergence of a powerful civic nationalism by the 1970s and 1980s. Ironically, with the ﬂorescence of civic nationalism and civil society among the multiple voices are many that challenge the\n\nIntroduction: Creating a People and a Nation\n\n29\n\nFreyrean narrative. At the very moment that the technology of mass communications ﬁnally made it possible to create (quite literally) a national community, the dream of uniting all the inhabitants in Brazil around a shared set of myths, rituals, and symbols began to slip away. Finally, in the Epilogue, “Nation, Modernity, and Identity in the Twentieth and the Twenty-First Centuries,” I return to the central arguments and ideas in this essay. I emphasize the power and diffusion of the Freyrean vision through popular culture and its constant interaction with State power. Beginning in the 1990s, and with the rise of the latest technological wave (the Internet), the meaning of national identity, whatever the narrative, has now become even more complicated and diffuse than ever. This new technology of mass communication and the emergence of a dynamic and divisive civil society in Brazil in the 1990s mark the end of an era. The dream of constructing nation-states in Latin America built around an imagined community bound together by a single narrative of national identity, as it turns out, is most likely an illusion even in the age of increasingly powerful States. What was an impossible dream of nation-builders in the nineteenth century seemed entirely possible to their successors in the mid-twentieth century, but now appears impossible in the twenty-ﬁrst century. In retrospect, the lack of technologies of mass communication made the dreams unachievable in the nineteenth century, the dramatic expansion of these technologies in the twentieth century helped create the illusion of complete national cultural integration, and the global, digital technologies of the twenty-ﬁrst century have made that integration difﬁcult, if not impossible. Brazil’s experience with culture, technology, and identity in the twentieth century is not unique and should compel us to reﬂect on the same processes in the rest of Latin America and, indeed, the rest of the world.\n\nnotes 1.
