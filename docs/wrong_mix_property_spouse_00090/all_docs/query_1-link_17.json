Mid-20th century, when as a provincial (or ‘regional’, the preferred BBC term that long preceded standard PC) grammar school sixth-former I was beginning to take a serious interest in film, my school library owned three books on the cinema. They were Paul Rotha’s The Film Till Now, Raymond Spottiswoode’s A Grammar of Film and Béla Balasz’s Theory of Film. My local public library didn’t need more than half a shelf to contain its complete cinematic collection in a section devoted to Theatre, Music and the Arts. I owned two or three books about the movies, all Penguin paperbacks by Roger Manvell – his seminal Film, first published in 1944, and a couple of editions of his short-lived Penguin Film Review – which had to be bought because they were not available for public borrowing back then when libraries were strictly forbidden to put hardcovers on paperbacks. In the 1960s I worked quite often with Manvell on the air. I also corresponded with, but never met, Paul Rotha, who became violently involved with the one-time British starlet Constance Smith. After her success as the Irish servant at Windsor Castle, stealing scenes from Irene Dunne and Alec Guinness in The Mudlark (1950), Smith was signed up by 20th Century-Fox and went to Hollywood with her husband Bryan Forbes. Their marriage soon broke up and Forbes returned to Britain to establish one of the most significant careers in British cinema. Smith was dropped by Fox and came home to engage in her sad, publicised affair with Rotha. Manvell, a decent, jolly, earnest man, more educationist than critic, had grave reservations about British cinema. The pictorial section of Film included twice as many illustrations from the Odessa Steps sequence of Battleship Potemkin than from the whole history of British feature films, though he put in 40 stills from British documentaries. Like many of his profesional circle (John Grierson, Basil Wright, Edgar Anstey, Athur Elton), he was forever fighting to have cinema accepted as a legitimate art form. Manvell was embarrassed by popular entertainment and looked with suspicion on film as an industry, though in fact the documentaries he admired were with few exceptions subsidised by private or public enterprise organisations. In the 1950 edition of Film, Manvell managed to list 30 films of high quality made by the British film industry between 1946 and 1949 (e.g. Ealing at its zenith, Lean’s Dickens movies, Carol Reed at his peak, Powell and Pressburger in full flower). One would be pushed to name another list as good in the theatre or fiction of the time. Nevertheless he felt obliged to proclaim that this had been ‘a period in which the flag was lowered to half-mast in the public interest’. In comparison with the films of Rossellini, he went on, ‘How many of them do not appear like faded leaves painted in exquisite detail by a lady in Cornwall?’. We were not encouraged to like British cinema as an institution. Indeed we were urged to disparage it as socially\n\nThe Encyclopedia of British Film : Fourth Edition, edited by Brian McFarlane, and Anthony Slide, Manchester University Press, 2014.

Meanwhile, the indefatigable Manvell played a part in initiating The History of the British Cinema by Rachael Low, the first volume of which, covering the years 1896 to 1906, appeared in 1948. It attracted from C.A. Lejeune, the Observer’s film critic, the backhanded compliment ‘although some of the earlier records make amusing reading to modern eyes, the book has the coolly impersonal authority of a Government White Paper’. Many of us were to grow up and grow old with Low’s unfinished, seemingly unfinishable history. When the first volume appeared I was officially too young to get into an ‘A’ certificate film; when her seventh and last (bringing the story up to 1939) appeared in 1985, I had turned fifty. By then, starting in the late 60s, books on the movies were being published in abundance both by trade publishers and university presses. But it took some time for the British cinema to benefit from this, largely because the French New Wave, as critics and directors, were as cool towards Britain as they were enthusiastic about Hollywood, and engendered this attitude in their admirers in the English-speaking world. This was rather odd considering that François Truffaut, the most quotably contemptuous of the group, included those archetypal Londoners, Chaplin and Hitchcock, in his personal pantheon. In the BFI’s trail-blazing series of monographs, Cinema One, which began in 1965, only two of the 28 books it published were devoted to British cinema – the inevitable Studies in Documentary and Kevin Brownlow’s account of the making of It Happened Here, the independent feature he co-directed with Andrew Mollo. Brownlow made his considerable reputation as an historian of American silent cinema and a restorer of silent pictures, mostly American. Not until the 1990s did he turn his attentions to British cinema with his authorised biography of David Lean. Things at last began to change significantly in the mid-1970s, and if one were looking for a milestone it would be Charles Barr’s Ealing Studios, a seminal work, still the best book about the British cinema. Rejected as too serious (probably because insufficiently anecdotal) by the publishing house that commissioned it, Ealing Studios appeared in 1977 under the auspices of the small company of Cameron and Tayleur. It was edited and designed by its co-publisher Ian Cameron, using the style made familiar by the influential auteur-orientated Movie, that had been launched by Cameron, V.F. Perkins, Mark Shivas, Paul Mayersberg and others in 1962. This editorial group were as hostile to the torpor – as they saw it – of British cinema as Gavin Lambert, Lindsay Anderson, Karel Reisz and their fellow members of the editorial board of Sequence had been a dozen years or so before. Broadly speaking, what united these two generations was their dislike of what A. Alvarez, writing at the time as the influential poetry editor of the Observer, called ‘the gentility principle’. What divided them were their different attitudes towards realism and the continuing post-war debate over political and social commitment. All the Movie collective admired Robert Hamer and Alexander Mackendrick, and most of them embraced the gifted, short-lived Seth Holt. Gavin Millar came to the defence of Karel Reisz and Lindsay Anderson in Movie ; and Raymond Durgnat made a vigorous case there for the reappraisal of Michael Powell. Anyway, Cameron brought out Barr’s book, and I managed to write about it in both the Observer and the Times Literary Supplement, as well as having it discussed on my BBC arts programme, Critics’ Forum. My enthusiasm for Barr’s book received extra fuel from my embarrassment at having reluctantly withdrawn in 1973 (as a result of commitments at the BBC) from writing an authorised history of Ealing, drawing on Sir Michael Balcon’s archives. I’d\n\nThe Encyclopedia of British Film : Fourth Edition, edited by Brian McFarlane, and Anthony Slide, Manchester University Press, 2014. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nCopyright © 2014.

Barr had been involved in various forms of film education before teaching movie studies at university. His Ealing Studios created academic waves, which attracted the Australian editor of this Encyclopedia to graduate studies under Barr at East Anglia. Film studies had been established in the Department of English and American Studies there since the early 1970s. Barr’s work and that of his colleagues and former followers have gone some way to tempering my hostility to media studies in higher education, something I advocated and sponsored but have at times come to have certain doubts about, even to regret. Still, one way or another, serious attention has been given to British cinema these past 25 years, much of it coming from academe, whether out of true enthusiasm or the searching for virgin territory. Apart from Barr one thinks especially of Jeffrey Richards, Anthony Aldgate and Robert Murphy on campus; of Roy Armes, Alexander Walker, Geoffrey Macnab, Charles Drazin and George Perry in the outside world. So with the 20th century ended and the 21st getting on its way, British cinema is at last getting the attention it deserves; monographs on unfashionable directors from Manchester University; studies of individual films in a new series published by I.B. Tauris; articles in magazines like the Journal of Popular British Cinema. Forty years ago volumes of Rachael Low’s magnum opus and Charles Oakley’s Where We Came In: The Story of the British Cinematograph Industry (1964) were almost alone on my shelves. There are now several dozen, most from Britain but some from the States, and several in French. Bertrand Tavernier, Philippe Pilard and the editors of Positif have done wonders in introducing British cinema to France, helping to establish the annual Festival du Film Britannique at Dinard (it began in 1990) and culminating in the magnificent season of British movies at the Beaubourg Centre in 1999. It was Pilard who began his revisionary 1989 book Le Nouveau Cinéma Britannique with the lapidary words: ‘Il y a un fantôme qui hante le cinéma britannique. Il est français. Il se nomme François Truffaut.’ We now know that Truffaut was wrong. The British cinema may have been in a state of crisis from World War One onwards, but it is in fact a rich and fascinating story, an essential thread in world cinema and a central part of the social and cultural history of 20th-century Britain. It has also been the better, rather than the worse, for involving the theatre and literature to such an extent. Not insignificantly, one of the greatest British novelists, Graham Greene, has been more involved as critic, screenwriter, student of film technique and source of adapted material, than any other writer of comparable status the world over. By a nice irony, Greene made his only screen appearance in a Truffaut film, La nuit américaine, albeit under a pseudonym, playing an English accountant preparing to pull the plug on a French film. This massive tome is the culmination of a quarter of a century of enthusiasm, diligent research and scholarship by McFarlane and his associates. The books that working cinéphiles have beside their desks – Leslie Halliwell, Ephraim Katz, David Thomson and others – have rarely been fair to British cinema. They’ve done scant justice to what they include, and constantly irritate the user by what they ignore. More significantly, for us living in the British Isles, they haven’t boldly gone, as we say on Star Trek’s USS Enterprise, to definitively record the individual contributions of artists small and large, on screen and behind the cameras, metropolitan and regional. We need our own reference work, to consult or browse in, and McFarlane\n\nThe Encyclopedia of British Film : Fourth Edition, edited by Brian McFarlane, and Anthony Slide, Manchester University Press, 2014. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nx Foreword\n\nand his team have produced a book that does this in detail, from the Brighton School to Jamie Bell, from the Sheffield Photo Company to Ealing. This book is packed with extraordinary revelations. I had no idea, for instance, that Marianne Stone, most famous now as the silent Vivienne Darkbloom in Kubrick’s Lolita, had appeared in more movies than any other British actress. I knew her principally as the wife of Peter Noble, who had abandoned a serious critical career (as author of The Negro in Film and the first biography of Orson Welles) to be the sweetnatured, sybaritic showbiz writer for trade magazines. McFarlane’s Encyclopedia of British Film will take its place beside the late Denis Gifford’s labour of love, The British Film Catalogue. His Encyclopedia is an essential work that will grow over the years as its readers send in their emendations or suggestions, and as more movies get made.\n\nCopyright © 2014.

ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nPREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION\n\nThis fourth edition of The Encyclopedia of British Film, skilfully compiled and edited by Brian McFarlane, provides an extensive and inspiring resource for anyone curious about what makes up the idea of British film, as both art form and industry. The development of British film, its history, the diverse influences and people that make films ‘British’, can be explored in this volume. Film-making in Britain thrives despite a tough economic climate and the uncertain terrain of the digital age. Reading entries for such diverse figures as Oliver Reed, Bryan Forbes, Michael Redgrave and Julie Christie, and the entries for, say, heritage cinema or comedy or film noir reminded me of the complex social character of film-making in Britain, and the tenacity and essential integrity of its practitioners.\n\nCopyright © 2014.

In the years between when I finished preparing the third edition of this Encyclopedia and now, 2012, when I’ve been revising and updating for the fourth, I’ve been struck by several things. Some of them are decidedly gloomy, and yet…. To get the ‘gloomy’ over at the outset. First, it was depressing to have to add as a final sentence for so many of the biographical entries something like: Most/all of his/her work in the latter half of the 2000s has been for television. Or: In the new century, he/she has been largely based in the US. Neither of these terse statements augers well for the British film industry. Increasingly, one wonders, is there a British film industry? or are there just British films that somehow, against the odds, contrive to get made. As to what constitutes a ‘British film’, this Encyclopedia has always adopted an inclusive stance. If there is significant creative input, as distinct from financial involvement, then it has always seemed sensible to include such films. What would be the point of omitting from the filmographies of participants a film such as Possession which was technically (i.e., financially) a US production but which was almost entirely British in its creative personnel and which was shot in Britain? One of the least cheering aspects of the present updating has been the number of films of wholly UK attribution that seem never to have secured anything like general release. So many of these films have had only limited festival screenings or have by-passed cinemas altogether and gone straight to DVD. A typical exhibition paradigm might be along these lines: the film may have been produced in 2003, found an outlet at a festival somewhere in 2006, and made its first British appearance on DVD in 2007. It is by contrast very encouraging to find films as accomplished and distinctive as An Education and Nowhere Boy to be entirely British. These, though, are the exceptions that throw into starker relief the situation encapsulated in the hypothetical case sketched above. Far more common is the situation in which the film’s attribution will be at least (UK/US), and the ‘US’ element will often be expressed in the employment of an American star name to ensure, or certainly bolster, distribution in the US. As well, one is struck by the multi-attribution of so many films, often involving three, four or more European countries to varying discernible degrees – presumably the degree of involvement and influence could be determined if one could make individual studies of such films, a project impossible in a work of the Encyclopedia’s scope. Often such films sound obscure, the sorts of venture not likely to reach large audiences. But not always, as evidenced by the likes of Ken Loach’s Looking for Eric (2009, UK/Be/Fr/It/Sp). I don’t doubt the industrial complexities behind the multiple national listings\n\nfor individual films, but it is interesting to ponder the degree and kind of their Britishness. In Loach’s case, there is no doubt. In general, though, the wholly British-funded films tend to be modest in their aspirations and to get lost in the commercial shuffle where the blockbusters are invariably – at best from the British point of view – lavish co-productions such as the ‘Harry Potter’ franchise. Speaking of the Potter phenomenon, one finds it hard to imagine how the British acting fraternity ever survived without it – and how it will do so when the series comes to its overdue end. Actually, it’s not hard at all: they will simply go to Hollywood where, often as not, they lose that particular potency that made them compelling company at home. Think of Steve Coogan’s superbly honed persona as inept egotist and the way its satirical edges were smoothed away in his US film, Happy Endings, or smart and witty Kate Beckinsale’s subsumption into blockbuster anonymity, or any number of others. I’m overstating the case of course: it doesn’t always happen: but it does happen often enough to be depressing. Currently, as far as actors go, Carey Mulligan looked like the white hope of British cinema, following her remarkably assured performance in An Education, but she has naturally been snatched up by Hollywood where she will be seen as Daisy in the new version of The Great Gatsby in 1913. Mulligan is typical of a number of new names that appear in this Encyclopedia for the first time. Other such actors include Ben Whishaw, who made a striking impression in the new (and perhaps unfairly underrated) version of Brideshead Revisited, Hayley Atwell, also in Brideshead and several other high-profile pieces such as The Duchess, Ben Barnes, the youthful lead in Easy Virtue, and the dazzling Anne-Marie Duff, whose film fame may yet rival that she has earnt on stage and television. Will British cinema be able to provide adequate opportunities for these emerging talents? Or will they, like Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant and others before them, succumb to the lure of Hollywood in the interests of pursuing a substantial career? As well as actors, there are as well other film personnel included here for the first time: producers such as Tessa Ross, editors such as the late Teddy Darvas, who wrote the entry on editors in this book and should himself have been included in the first edition, director Tom Hooper, and writers such as Peter Morgan whose name is on some of the smartest British films of recent years. There are, too, new thematic entries: for example on representations of houses and housing, of work and working lives, in British film. All the biographical entries have been updated where necessary, partly to give a sense of career movements in the later 2000s, sometimes to include information which has come to light since the previous\n\nThe Encyclopedia of British Film : Fourth Edition, edited by Brian McFarlane, and Anthony Slide, Manchester University Press, 2014.

Never before has there been a single reference book which works as a starting point for enquiries about the industry or the people involved in it. The fact that this is the 3rd edition since it first appeared in 2003 only goes to show that the book itself is evolving in line with British cinema, and suggests that it has filled a gap in the market. There is no doubt that British film is alive and well and this edition contains around 200 new entries, including up-and-coming young British actors and directors, and a few Americans who have made an impression on the British film industry. Also included as new entries are some more names from the past, such as Ernest Dudley (best known as ‘The Armchair Detective’ from radio in the 1940s). British cinema in the past has been overshadowed by Hollywood. This reference book puts the record straight and should be compulsory reading for anyone who has even the slightest interest in the world of British film. Researchers will probably find here everything they ever wanted to ask or needed to know – and probably a few things they had never even thought of!\n\nCopyright © 2014. Manchester University Press.

There are no doubt many complex industrial reasons for what I mean, and possibly personal ones as well relating to the lives of the people I have in mind. Why, I wondered, are there not British films made starring the likes of Helen McCrory and Phil Davis (watch them in the transfixing last moments of TV’s North Square), Daniela Nardini and Jack Davenport (from This Life), Natasha McElhone, Paul Rhys, Keeley Hawes, James Purefoy or Toby Stephens? These have all done superb work in television or on the stage, but to date no major film has been built around them – or any number of others like them, who have the talents to carry an entire film. Perhaps the other media are more rewarding to them; perhaps, industrially speaking only those British films with American stars have a serious hope of international success. My point is that it is certainly not a question of talent, and never has been. It may be that the proximity of the stage to the studios in Britain has always worked both for and against the British cinema: there is a repository of gifted actors who would simply prefer to work on the stage, and who regard the happily accessible studios as offering no more than pin-money. But what about film directors? One of the depressing things about preparing this third edition is the number of very promising talents who have made a striking feature debut, then, again for reasons I can only speculate about, not been able to follow these auspicious beginnings. A few years ago Jamie Thraves made a charming, character-driven piece called The Low-Down (2001), Dom Rotheroe’s drama of teenage amour fou, My Brother Tom (2001) seemed full of dark insights, and John Furse directed the moving hostage drama, Blind Flight (2004). None of these has since made a further feature. Will Debbie Isitt have to wait several years before she gets a chance to follow up her success with Confetti, or Andrea Arnold on her Cannes-winning Red Road? Will all those other new directors – Joe Wright, Neil Marshall, Edgar Wright, for instance – get the chance to establish themselves as they deserve? These names could easily be multiplied, and one could add to them those of film-makers who are inevitably beguiled by the possibilities of Hollywood (think of Mike Newell or Jonathan Glazer, for instance) when British cinema needs them so much more urgently. When seeking to update the credits of personnel for this edition, again and again I found that there were no further films to add, though in many cases there was television work. A well-known actress told me ten years ago that it is not possible to maintain a career in British films alone, and that actors, directors and others are lucky to have the opportunities that television offers. Nevertheless, there is something com­\n\nparatively fleeting about most television work, unless it acquires the classic status that leads to extended life on DVD. And as for stage, that is essentially a big-city pleasure: I may recall Helen McCrory’s Yelena in Uncle Vanya (2003) or Toby Stephens’ Coriolanus (1995) as the best I have ever seen, but no record of these, as far as I know, exists to substantiate such a view. Film has a permanence denied the stage and most television, which is why one wants to see the best British talents being given the opportunities to exhibit themselves there. What seems to be keeping a sense of cinema alive in Britain, and I am of course speaking wholly from an outsider’s point of view, is the preponderance of co-productions. Researching for this edition has meant examining every entry and, for those still active in their professions, this involves detailed checking of new work since the second edition two years ago. Over­ whelmingly, the new films are the products of collaboration between two or more countries and those films which are – daringly, it seems – designated ‘UK’ only often appear to have had only very limited release, or to have been made on a very modest scale. There is of course nothing wrong with the latter if it does not lead inexorably to the former. And yet . . . the situation is not, to an observer, all gloomy. Not, that is, while films as diversely interesting as the following can go on release in just over a single year. These include the work of established directors such as Michael Winterbottom’s A Cock and Bull Story, Ken Loach’s The Wind That Shakes the Barley, Stephen Frears’ The Queen, Shane Meadows’ This Is England, and Anthony Minghella’s Breaking and Entering; or of the versatile Julian Fellowes’ feature debut Separate Lies or Paul Andrew Williams’ London to Brighton; or of non-British directors working here, such as Alfonso Cuaron’s Children of Men, Woody Allen’s Match Point and Fernando Meirelles’ The Constant Gardener. What one would like to think is that these are not just a series of one-offs but the products of a flourishing British industry. Since the last edition appeared, it has become increasingly obvious that the Encyclopedia should in future provide a guide to some of the more valuable websites now available to those interested in British (indeed, in any) film. For example, the British Film Institute’s Film & TV Data Base (http:// www.bfi.org.uk/filmtvinfo/ftvdb) is now on line, covering international film, and rivalling the Internet Movie Data base (http://us.imdb.com) in comprehensiveness and reliability; there are websites that concentrate on British film (e.g., http://www.britfilms.com and http://www.britishpictures. com), and one that specialises on Shakespeare on film (www. bufvc.ac.uk/shakespeare). This handful of Internet addresses is of course not even the tip of an iceberg, but it perhaps gives an\n\nThe Encyclopedia of British Film : Fourth Edition, edited by Brian McFarlane, and Anthony Slide, Manchester University Press, 2014.

Her pre-eminence in all three made her the obvious choice. I thank all those people (film-makers and agents) who responded to requests for information to complete entries. Then, heartfelt thanks are due to the contributors who patiently replied to requests to update and amend their entries where necessary, and to the ‘vetters’ (Allen Eyles, Luke McKernan, Jeffrey Richards), who once again checked the new entries. As well, I am very grateful to the following for their vigilance in scrutinising the text and offering suggestions for additions and amendments: John Oliver at the BFI who answered many queries; Don Minifie, Roger Philip Mellor, Jonathan Croall, Richard Chatten, Tony Hillman, Philip Gillett and Andrew Spicer, who all drew my attention to matters that needed it; and to others who have been helpful on individual matters, including Charles Barr, Ian Britain, Dean Brandum, Frances Russell of the British Society of Cinematographers, Elaine Schreyeck, Andrew Knowles of the William Alwyn Foundation, and Christian Cargnelli. As with previous editions, I thank Methuen staff for the production of a handsome volume, and am indebted to Monash University, Melbourne, for the continuing support I have had from its School of English, Communications and Performance Studies, and from the Arts Faculty computer support staff. And above all my thanks are due to my wife Geraldine for all kinds of help and for bearing stoically with the kinds of domestic neglect that inevitably attend a project such as this. As before, this edition is dedicated to her. In the Introduction to the first edition, I wrote that the aim of the book was ‘to fill a gap’. My hope is that this third edition will go substantially further towards fulfilling that goal. Brian McFarlane Melbourne July 2007 Email: [email protected]\n\nCopyright © 2014.

There are about 160 new entries in the third edition, about half of them recognising new talents (Emily Blunt, Rupert Friend, Andrea Arnold, Jessica Stevenson, Martin Freeman, Natalie Ward, for example) at work in British cinema, some, as before, picking up on names and institutions and concepts that failed to find their way into earlier editions. Since the international success of British films seems to be in some degree dependent on the importing of American stars, several of these figures have been added: they are part of a continuing tradition that goes back at least to the 1920s, as Anthony Slide’s entry on ‘Americans in British silent films’ makes clear. For the first time, there is now an index of ‘thematic’ and ‘institutional’ entries: that is, for the non-biographical and company entries which can easily be found in the book’s alphabetic arrangement. The problems of release dates and of what constitutes a British film persist. As to the former, the date given after film titles is, as far as possible, that relating to its general release in the UK. In the absence of this, I have adopted the same pragmatic approach as before: UK festival dates or first release date in other countries or, failing all else, DVD release date or production date. Trying to pin release dates down is about as difficult as ensuring accuracy of birth dates, though a good deal of more reliable information relating to these latter has come to light since the second edition. About country of origin, I have again chosen to be inclusive, more or less following the line that, as I read recently, ‘Films are classed as UK-made if they are shot in the country, involve UK talent in front of and behind the camera and invest money in the UK or on British staff and services.’ My general cut-off date has been 31 December 2006, information relating to items later than that given only when it seems certain. In regard to the matter of dates of birth and death, I am immensely indebted once again to Janice Healey for her determined searching of records. There are as usual many other people who should be thanked. First, I must thank Dame Judi Dench for agreeing so readily to write the Preface to this edition: there is perhaps no name which currently conjures up\n\nThe Encyclopedia of British Film : Fourth Edition, edited by Brian McFarlane, and Anthony Slide, Manchester University Press, 2014.

All rights reserved.\n\nINTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION\n\nThe opening sentence of the Introduction to the first edition (2003) is: ‘The purpose of this book is to fill a gap.’ Following the generally encouraging response to the book’s appearance, it seems clear that this sense of a gap was widely felt. This was the gap resulting from the skimpy treatment given to British films in international reference books, to the endemic omission of all but the most famous names. There were valuable books in relation to this or that aspect of British film (such as cinema­ tographers or studios), but there was no comprehensive reference book that would try to suggest the contours of the whole phenomenon of British cinema and act as a starting point for more detailed researches. Indeed, the first edition of such an encyclopedia is most sensibly regarded as a foundation on which to build future editions, and it is with this idea in mind that the present volume is published. What is new about it? Well, there are over 260 new entries, many of them relating to personnel who have come to attention since the first edition went to press: directors such as John Furse or Edgar Wright, actors such as Romola Garai or Jamie Sives, and many others. In some cases, this is a matter of taking a punt on new talent, but it seems worth doing so to ensure that the book reflects where British cinema is now. As well, there are some, like the 1930s producer George Smith, who have come to my attention recently, along with new thematic entries (e.g., on the representation of ‘Italy in British cinema’) and some of the companies that specialised in ‘B’ movies in the 1950s. There is a further sprinkling of inter­ national names (e.g., Joan Crawford) who at various times made their presence felt in British film. The aim of the additions is to make The Encyclopedia of British Film as comprehensive and as contemporary as possible. The problem of what constitutes a British film persists and, in fact, becomes ever harder to deal with. As before, I have chosen to be inclusive, in the interests of fleshing out individual careers. If there is a significant ‘British’ element in a film’s production, then I have included such a title under the heading of other british films include. Some films are technically co-productions: for instance, Cold Mountain is a UK/Italian/ Romanian/US production and in the case of Dogville it is almost easier to list the European countries not involved. These films present no problem: they are auto­ matically included, however little they may seem, culturally, to have to do with Britain. Others, though, such as De-Lovely, while technically listed as a US/Luxemburg co-production, is included here as UK/Lux/US because it was filmed largely in British locations, with many British personnel both behind and in front of the camera, and some British company involvement. It is therefore listed in relation to actor Jonathan Pryce and costume designer Janty Yates, among several others.\n\nIt is a sad fact that there are comparatively few ‘wholly British’ films (or careers), and all too often these are only fleetingly seen, arriving and departing with none of the fanfare that accompanies the big co-productions. One of the most vexed matters in compiling an encyclopedia of film is that of release dates. Ideally, one would want perhaps to give the registration date on every film but, as it is impossible to guarantee access to this information in all cases, I have settled for the general UK release dates, using the BFI’s Film Index International, Denis Gifford’s The British Film Catalogue, Alan Goble’s CD The Complete Index to British Film Since 1885 and the IMDb’s information about first screenings. None of these, nor any other reference book, is infallible about this matter, and all one can do is to establish a benchmark. If the general UK release date has proved unavailable or seems unreliably asserted, I’ve next looked for a UK festival screening. If that is not available, then it has been necessary to use the first screening anywhere, or, failing that, the first video or DVD release date, or – faute de mieux – the production date. So, a notable British film like Girl with a Pearl Earring, first seen at the 2003 London Film Festival, had its general UK release in 2004, and that is the date that accompanies any mention of it. The dates given after the titles in the entries in this volume are as accurate as they can be at the end of 2004. However, it should be kept in mind that release dates do change. For instance, when I began compiling the updates for this edition, Colour Me Kubrick was listed for 2004 release but by the time I had finished this had been changed to 2005. As this is being written, Vera Drake has received awards at festivals, but it is not to be generally released in the UK until early 2005. One of the main functions of the second edition is, of course, to update the information contained in the original. The most melancholy aspect of this process is the recording of the deaths since the first edition went to press of many people who have been part of the history of British cinema. These have included such notable names as actors Sir Alan Bates and Dame Wendy Hiller, director John Schlesinger, film historian John Huntley and editor John Jympson, and, sadly, many others. As well, I have added (auto)biographies to entries where relevant, along with other kinds of writing about British film, and updated the credits of existing entries. This latter is a tricky enterprise: one wants the titles listed to be as up-to-date as possible but the risk is that the title may change (e.g., J. M. Barrie’s Neverland changed to Finding Neverland somewhere during the update process), the release date may change or another country may become involved in the production at a stage too late to alter the entry. So, again, the end of 2004 has in most cases to be the cut-off point, though last-minute awards and deaths are again an exception.\n\nThe Encyclopedia of British Film : Fourth Edition, edited by Brian McFarlane, and Anthony Slide, Manchester University Press, 2014.

All rights reserved.\n\nApart from the processes of updating, one of the most interesting aspects of preparing the second edition has been working my way through the masses of information that have been sent to me by users of the Encyclopedia. I am very grateful to people who have written in a spirit of ensuring that the book becomes as complete and accurate as possible and, as a result, there are corrections to matters of fact (especially relating to birth and death details), additional data about revealing career elements that had escaped me, and sometimes shifts of emphasis and judgements. In relation to the latter I have by no means taken on board every suggestion, these remaining areas in which a degree of subjectivity will always exist. New sources giving access to agents, and in some cases personnel active in the industry, have also thrown up further information about many of the original entries. So, the first edition has served its function and the second is inevitably more nearly complete and, in a field where accuracy has not always been the watchword, more nearly wholly accurate. This is being written towards the end of 2004 and I’ve been interested to contemplate the range of British films that have been on display since writing the Introduction two years ago. The big co-productions such as Vanity Fair (2004, UK/US) and Troy (2004, UK/Malta/US) still make the most resounding splashes and they are, no doubt, important to the survival of film as an industry. At the opposite end of the spectrum are chamber works such as Blind Flight (2004), on the basis of which there is now a brief entry on its director John Furse, who sustained tensions of plot and character with a confidence that seemed full of promise. There was the engaging horror comedy, Shaun of the Dead (2004), whose director Edgar Wright and star Simon Pegg are among the new entries in this edition. The traditions of British comedy are maintained by such films as Love Actually (2003, UK/US) and Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (2004), which, incidentally, confirm that, in Hugh Grant and Colin Firth, Britain can still produce inter­national stars. Humanist works such as the (more or less) comedy Calendar Girls (2003, UK/US) and the family drama The Mother (2003), invoke the realist mode that has so often underpinned British films in various genres, and the awardwinning documentary Touching the Void (2003), recalls where that mode had its roots. And films such as Girl with a Pearl Earring (2004, UK/Luxembourg/US) and I Capture the Castle (2003) remind us that literary adaptation has been a recurring strand in British film production. Major directors such as Ken Loach, Shane Meadows, Mike Leigh, Stephen Frears and Michael Winterbottom have continued to turn out notable work in an industrial climate that in some ways seems healthier than for some time. By healthier, I mean that there have been notable successes in both mainstream and art-house fare, in the small indigenous works as well as in the larger, more inter­ nationally slanted films that clamour for and receive more publicity. There are also the names of new film-makers, and I\n\nhave indicated a couple of these, which may be the basis for a generation to follow Loach et al. For those who don’t want their screens to be wholly dominated by hugely expensive, specialeffects-driven spectaculars, British film still appears to offer a range of viable alternatives. This selection of names and titles reinforces my general feeling that British cinema is alive and well. There have been some deplorable British films that have undeservedly found release in the last couple of years, but as long as one can adduce an output as diverse as that indicated above there are grounds for enthusiasm and optimism. There is, too, an ongoing scholarly interest in British film that means the past is being explored and charted in valuable ways. I hope that this book, in its second and successive editions, contributes to a sense of British cinema as an entity worthy of exploration and celebration. As before, there are many people who should be thanked. For specific suggestions about additions and amendments, I am grateful to Charles Barr, Geoff Brown, Richard Chatten, Jonathan Croall, Charles Higham, Tony Hillman, Alan Jones, David Meeker, Ken Ward and Roger Mellor, the latter also for his vigilance in ensuring that I saw all relevant newspaper articles about British film in the last year or so. At the British Film Institute, John Oliver and Janice Healey have continued to offer invaluable support. As with the first edition, I am indebted to Allen Eyles, Luke McKernan and Jeffrey Richards for ‘vetting’ all the new entries, and to Associate Editor Anthony Slide and, in Australia, Thelma Gellie, for their careful scrutiny of this new material. I thank, too, all those people who wrote expressing support for the Encyclopedia, sometimes offering individual pieces of information that I was glad to make use of. And I am very grateful to all those busy agents who either responded to my requests for basic information about their clients or to the clients themselves who sent prompt and helpful replies to emails forwarded by their agents. They are too numerous to name here, but they have filled a great many of the gaps found in the more readily available databases. Thanks are due also to Monash University, Melbourne, particularly to the School of Literary, Visual and Performance Studies for financial and other support for the second edition, to Terry Burke for much technical assistance, and the Computer Centre and the Arts Faculty computer support staff for their patience in dealing with many requests. Finally, and as before, my main thanks are due to my wife Geraldine for all kinds of help, and, like the first edition, this is dedicated to her.

ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nINTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST EDITION\n\nThe purpose of this book is to fill a gap. There have been various books which cover, for example, stars, directors and studios relevant to British cinema history, as well as a heartening growth of critical and theoretical works from many points of view. To date, however, there has been no compre­hensive reference book which might act as, in the words of one of its contributors, ‘the first port of call’ for anyone wanting to pursue an interest in British cinema. In large international reference works, British cinema is apt to be, if not exactly marginalised, skimpily treated at best, with even key figures in its history, whether before or behind the camera, quite frequently omitted. In one well-known work, for instance, Phyllis Calvert is missing whereas Joanne Dru’s career is generously canvassed, and this is only one graphic example of the way in which the (in many ways deserved) dominance of Hollywood has been allowed to overshadow achievement in other cinemas.\n\nCopyright © 2014. Manchester University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nWhat is a British film? Whereas the answer to this question might have seemed simple in the 1940s – a British film was made in British studios and/ or locations, with predominantly British personnel involved – this has clearly not been the case since the last two decades of the 20th century. (And one might note in passing, the idea of ‘Britishness’ in those earlier decades also tended to embrace first the ‘Empire’, then the ‘Commonwealth’; some consider­ ation is given to this, but the emphasis is, of course, on the film industry centred in the UK.) One could apply an arbitrary rule relating to where the finance has come from or where the film was made or who the film’s makers were, but no hard and fast categorisation of this kind seems satisfactory. The aim of this book has, in this respect, been to tend towards inclusiveness. In listing at the end of entries the other british films in which individual film-makers have been involved, if there is some ascertainable British involvement the abbreviation UK will follow the film’s title or year, then, in alphabetic order, abbreviations indicating the other countries that had some substantial involvement. UK is listed first, not because its contribution is necessarily the most important but because without its contribution the film would not be listed at all. It is not possible in a work such as this to distinguish the extent of contributions made by several countries in every film: the mere listing of the relevant countries, though, conforms to the ‘first port of call’ approach. For example, anyone making a special study of the film Sunshine will find it listed among Ralph Fiennes’s other british films as follows: Sunshine (2000, UK/ Austria/Can/Ger/Hung) and take more detailed researches\n\nfrom there. A film such as Batman (1989) was substantially shot at Pinewood, yet it will scarcely seem to most people to qualify as a British film. Nicholas and Alexandra (1971), designated US in some places, UK in others, was filmed mainly in Spain and Britain, with almost entirely British cast and crew. There seems no point in excluding a film on arbitrary grounds if its inclusion will help to give a fuller picture of the career involved. In the BFI Film and Television Handbook 1999, one finds six ‘UK Film Categories’ and the list is worth repeating here: • Category A Films where the cultural and financial impetus is from the UK and the majority of the personnel are British • Category B Majority UK Co-Productions. Films in which, though there are foreign partners, there is a UK cultural content and a significant amount of British finance and personnel • Category C Minority UK Co-Productions. Foreign (non-US) films in which there is a small UK involvement in finance or personnel • Category D American films with a UK creative and/or minor financial involvement • Category D1 American financed or part financed films made in the UK. Most films have a British cultural content • Category D2 American films with some UK financial involvement. The list is repeated partly to suggest the complexity of the matter and partly because it has been used as an unofficial guideline in the present book. In April 2002, however, the definition of ‘British’ was tightened in a parliamentary Budget statement aimed at curtailing abuse of tax breaks originally designed to encourage British film-makers but which had been used by producers describing as British films which in all important ways are foreign. For the purpose of deciding whether an individual might be included in this encyclopedia, the number of UK or part-UK films in which he/she was involved has been taken into account, and, in the case of co-productions, the number would be arrived at along lines suggested above. Where film-makers have had substantial careers in countries other than Britain, this will normally be noted in the descriptive paragraphs preceding the British filmography at the end of the entry. For major figures every attempt has been made to list all other british films; for others, that phrase is followed by the word include.\n\nThe Encyclopedia of British Film : Fourth Edition, edited by Brian McFarlane, and Anthony Slide, Manchester University Press, 2014.

In most cases, these patterns do not represent especially new insights so much as the reinforcing, through the accumulation of evidence as distinct from generalised feeling, of what one had previously suspected. It was striking, in writing the several thousand biographical entries, how few wholly film careers there have been in British cinema. In the first half of the 20th century, there was a remarkable reliance on stage background, especially among performers but also to some extent among directors, writers and designers. This connection between British cinema and British theatre remains to this day, but it is less pronouncedly a matter of the theatre’s being the likeliest path into film. Nor is there so strong a sense of personnel moonlighting in cinema while carving out their serious careers on stage. There is no doubt that this was previously the case for many, and when one reads obituaries of actors and actresses in particular it is quite common to find their film careers compressed into an unobtrusive paragraph. It was of course always geographically feasible for British actors to maintain careers in each medium because of the proximity of the film studios to the West End, but there was in addition a strong sense of cultural hierarchy involved. From the 60s on, while the theatre connection remains, if less tenaciously, the links are more likely to be with television and the shift is not coincidental. Before the ascendancy of television, though, radio was a hugely popular entertainment form, and many film personnel either began in or continued to work in radio. However, as television ownership increased, the nature of the film-going habit, and those who practised it, changed both in numbers and in demographic terms. As television performers and programmes became popular, there would be a good deal of crossover to the cinema whose production output declined as television increasingly satisfied the appetite for moving images. These are large and complex questions and this is not the place to do more than allude to them. What became a recurring refrain in the compilation of this encyclopedia was the sentence that said something like ‘ . . . but his first allegiance remained the stage’ or ‘ . . . but television has persistently offered her more interesting work’. And this is not just a matter of performers, but of writers and directors and other personnel as well. Except perhaps for a brief shining hour in the 40s, cinema has always had to fight for its place in the sun of British cultural life, under serious pressure from competing media. While this book is essentially concerned with cinema, it seemed important to indicate where careers were at least partly, and sometimes predominantly, spent in these other media. It is not just the performance media that have exerted a strong influence on British cinema, but what emerges as well are the very strong links with literature. Astonishing numbers of British films, at every period, were derived from novels, plays and short stories, and the British cinema’s adaptations, so the conventional wisdom went, were much more respectful, more faithful than their Hollywood counterparts, where a famous work was acquired, gutted and reshaped to box-office success. Now, the Hollywood adaptors (including expat Brits) are more likely to be praised for their bolder response to their literary antecedents, but it was not always so. A good many authors\n\nand playwrights are included in this book, partly because their works have been so much adapted and also because, in some cases, of their connections with the cinema (one thinks of Terence Rattigan, Graham Greene, Edgar Wallace and Hanif Kureishi, to pluck but four from the air). But apart from these obvious links with literature, one is struck by the prominence of the ‘literary’ in periods of highest distinction in British cinema. There is a strong reliance on the verbal, on the literary virtues of detailed characterisation and setting, and the wellmade play’s stress on structure, as well as on the predominance of literary sources in such productive periods as the mid 40s and the late 50s/early 60s. Indeed, this matter of ‘productive periods’ asserts itself again and again. The encyclopedia, if read (improbably) from cover to cover would most likely reflect the rediscovery of British silent cinema, the quota-driven prolificacy of the 30s, the wonderful efflorescence of wartime and immediately postwar film-making, the ‘New Wave’ rejuvenation of the late 50s until the mid 60s, then no more than rather fitful starts until the 90s when production at least stepped up, even if quality and commercial success were variable. These periods of notable achievement have characteristically seen the emergence of new talents or of talents finally being given their heads, but they also need to be seen in terms of the industrial shifts that have helped to produce them. To this end, the entries on matters such as studio structures, legislation, finance and film-associated organisations are important. They have helped to highlight and sometimes to reconceptualise crucial shifts in British cinema history. British cinema was often criticised in the past for being too resolutely middle-class in its orientation: it tended to espouse implicitly the values of middle-class decency and sobriety and to neglect especially not merely the values but the value of working-class life. This was never a wholly true proposition but it took account of certain tendencies. It was very instructive in writing the biographical entries for this book to note how many personnel had educational backgrounds involving major public schools and Oxbridge. This information has been included, not because one is in awe of it, but because it perhaps helps to explain the prevailing class attitudes of so much British cinema. Even when it has very clearly set out to explore other kinds of living, as the 30s documentarists or the New Wave film-makers did, it was often from precisely this kind of educational background. This is not to say that the mores implanted by the latter were uncritically endorsed but that this kind of background was so common in the industry that it needs to be taken into account in understanding its ideological cast. Again, with people now entering the industry from television or from the film schools, as they once routinely did from the famous acting schools, some change of perspectives might be expected. That reference to the acting schools draws attention to another aspect of British cinema: the precariousness of its star system. It may be that those trained in the ensemble arts of the theatre and subsequently finding the theatre to be more clearly an actor’s medium than the film were less likely than Hollywood players to be interested in pursuing star careers in film. It may be that they resisted the studios’ attempts to build them into stars, or that the studios were less competent in doing so than their US counterparts. There were certainly popular domestic stars but only occasionally did they become international phenomena of the kind on which sturdy commercial industries are built. Again and again one\n\nThe Encyclopedia of British Film : Fourth Edition, edited by Brian McFarlane, and Anthony Slide, Manchester University Press, 2014. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nCopyright © 2014.

By a further contrast it was impossible not to be aware of the extraordinary richness of British film’s character acting, and this refers not merely to those one-scene delights who could briefly vivify the most mundane enterprise but also to remarkable actors who never aspired to conven­tional stardom but often grabbed the chance to draw richly detailed character performances. Hence, the reader will find entries on the one hand for Sam Kydd and, on the other, for Mona Washbourne. One of the book’s aims is to do justice to precisely such people: the stars, the major directors, the other key players, are written about everywhere, but the character people have very rarely been given the credit they deserve for their way of embedding often flimsy structures in recognisable reality. Stars were characteristically a product of a studio system, most potently exemplified by Hollywood but emulated by the British industry from the later 20s to the 60s; emulated, that is, but not really rivalled. All the major studios (and production companies) and quite a number of the minor ones receive separate entries, and certainly some sense of their difference emerges. Rank and Associated British may seem confusable but on closer inspection their individuality is felt, and no one will confuse Ealing and Hammer, but none, it has to be acknowledged, ever quite assumed the aura of the Hollywood giants. This does not mean that their histories, or those of Tempean or Independent Artists or a number of others, are not worth pursuing; some of them knew exactly what they were doing and did it with great proficiency. Reference to Ealing and Hammer inevitably invokes the genres of comedy and horror, not that the output of either studio was so narrowly circumscribed. The critically privileged modes of British cinema have been the realist and the literary but other genres have always been there vying for audience – if not always critical – favour. The various guises of melodrama, most famously typified in Gainsborough’s costume melo­ drama, the long and changing history of the comedy genre from silent screen favourites to international successes such as Notting Hill (1999), the history of horror with its apotheosis in Hammer’s output, the war film, the biopic, science-fiction and others: these all required separate entries because, despite the long-held official line, they have always been part of the texture of British cinema. And running through all the research was the idea of Hollywood. Very often it beckoned with a siren song to British practitioners; sometimes it had its eye on how to make the most of British markets; sometimes its faded grandeur (stars and others) would be invoked to imbue the local industry with a touch of glamour – and to help with US distribution; almost always British film-makers have had to contend with the supremacy of Hollywood films at British box-offices. Some expatriate British fell in love with Hollywood and virtually never came back; others tried it and couldn’t get back fast enough. One way or other, Hollywood is an unignorable motif in the tapestry of British cinema and it is highlighted constantly in the appraisals of individual careers. The encyclopedia has been compiled out of enormous affection for and pleasure in British cinema. This has been the sine qua non of its inception and production. This does not imply, however, that it was put together with no regard for critical edge, though it does mean to avoid the merely idiosyncratic – as well as the merely blandly consensual.\n\nCriteria for inclusion The first task in preparing this encyclopedia was to establish the rules of selection. No work of this kind can ever be truly exhaustive, but my aim was to go well beyond the expected names. Because a book will always have some word limitation, the initial decision had to be whether to opt for ‘less about more’ or ‘more about less’. In settling for the former, the aim was to ensure the inclusion of entries which might not usually be found in such a reference work. Obviously big names and companies, recurring genres and motifs have been allocated space commensurate with their importance, but among more than 5,800 entries are a good many that would not normally be found: these include hundreds of character actors, cinematographers, producers, editors, costume and production designers, special effects technicians, sound recordists and con­ tinuity personnel. Whereas the major figures are widely discussed in books and articles, many others who have also made their contributions to the history of British cinema have been per­ sistently overlooked. There are dangers in opting for this approach; if this minor figure is included, then why not that one? Up to a point, this will always be unanswerable, but a part-answer lies in the idea of representativeness. Further, in choosing to acknowledge those often omitted, there is the chance of reducing the substance of other entries. The ‘first port of call’ perspective is perhaps an answer to this: the book is predicated on the notion that anyone wanting to do detailed research on, say, any person or company might see this as the starting point for that study. For those whose careers were conducted largely in the decades from the 30s to the 80s, it was comparatively easy to decide inclusions: the scope of the film-maker’s work would settle this. However, the silent period presented more problems: the period is now receiving much more attention than was the case a decade or so back and interesting careers, once over­ looked, are being brought to light, some of which may be represented here for the first time in a reference book. At the other end of the century and into the new one, there is inevitably an element of clairvoyance involved. Again, the general rule favouring inclusiveness has been followed: new film-makers whose output, in some cases, is still small have been included where signs of real interest and promise have been discerned. Non-biographical entries also present problems of selection. Companies and studios are comparatively easy but even with these, at the lesser end, there will be discriminations to be made. In relation to British silent cinema, in particular, recent scholarship has suggested there is more that is worthy of notice than has often – dismissively – been allowed. Thematic entries will always be contentious. Some will wonder at the inclusion of this concept and not of that other; some will exclaim at the omission, in such entries, of certain film titles. This is inevitable and the contention, one hopes, may provide matter for fruitful debate. One of the charms of an encyclopedia may also be the occasional surprising inclusion: we all tend to know what we would include, but it can sometimes be stimulating to find the unexpected. Film titles as such are not included as entries, partly because they would have made the book unwieldy and partly because there are plenty of places where information on individual films is available. Sources of information are so numerous as to defy compre­ hensive listing. The characteristic procedure was to start by using works of international reference on the understanding that any British person or company listed here was sure to be necessary in this encyclopedia. Then it was a matter of working one’s way down through works of increasing specialism\n\nThe Encyclopedia of British Film : Fourth Edition, edited by Brian McFarlane, and Anthony Slide, Manchester University Press, 2014. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nxxii Introduction to the First Edition\n\nin deciding which – say – cinematographers to include. In general, if there was doubt in a particular case I have settled for inclusion. I acknowledge all those earlier, more and less specialised works which helped establish the ‘headwords’ that form the basis of the present encyclopedia, and this includes many popular as well as scholarly sources. As well as sifting written and electronic sources of inform­ ation, more and less reliable, I must acknowledge gratefully those – perhaps two hundred – participants in British cinema, or their relatives, who provided data not otherwise readily available. One of the problems in compiling such a book is that some kinds of misinformation get handed down from one reference work to another. Not merely dates and places of birth and death, though there are plenty of mistakes about those, but matters of supposition which congeal into received wisdom. One example: obituaries for director Leslie Arliss suggested that he had developed his love of cinema while in Hollywood in the 1920s with his famous actor father George Arliss. There seemed reason to doubt this lineage and, indeed, the purchase of the birth and death certificates of Leslie Arliss established that his father was ‘Collector to Gas Company’ and that his real name was Arliss, whereas George Arliss’s real name was Andrews. There are probably many other instances of the perpetuation of such errors: this one is quoted merely to suggest the extreme care that needs to be taken in accepting such information. It is not of course possible to check birth and/or death certificates for about 4,500 biographical entries but wherever there has seemed room for doubt this has been done. The truth is simply elusive in some cases, and it is not, after all, the most important information relating to individuals. Where I have had to use a source that seems less than wholly reliable or less than exact (e.g., an interview with a ‘35-year-old director’), I have used the formula b c 1967, to indicate that, at very least, it is not clear which of two possible years might be accurate.\n\nSources\n\nCopyright © 2014. Manchester University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nThe sources enlisted in compiling the encyclopedia are too numerous to list in full, but some of the main ones are given below. All were useful but one learns to rely on no particular source for infallible information: • International encyclopedias of film • Reference works devoted to specific aspects of British film or dealing with it selectively (see Bibliography) • The British Film Institute’s SIFT Database and the Film Index International CD-Rom derived from it • Alan Goble’s The Complete Index to British Film since 1895 (CD-Rom) • The BFI Film and Television Handbook (published annually from 1983) • Denis Gifford’s The British Film Catalogue 1895–1970 (3rd edition): Volume 1: Fiction Film, 1894–1994; Volume 2: NonFiction Film, 1888–1994 • Old ‘Who’s Who’ or similar volumes relating to cinema from the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s • Who’s Who in the Theatre (various editions) • International Who’s Who and Who Was Who (various editions) • British Television, Oxford, 1996\n\n• Encyclopedia Britannica • Peter Noble’s British Film Yearbooks and, later, British Film and Television Handbooks (various editions between the late 1940s and the early 1980s) • Rachael Low’s The History of the British Film, seven volumes, London, 1949–85 • Family Records Centre, London • Principal Probate of the Family Division, London • Obituaries in many newspapers, including The Times, Independent, Guardian, Daily Telegraph, Variety • Journals and magazines, including The Monthly Film Bulletin, Sight and Sound, Films and Filming, Picture Show, Picturegoer • Innumerable memoirs, biographies and autobiographies • Stage Deaths: A Biographical Guide to International Theatri­ cal Obituaries (1991) • Interviews in newspapers and journals • Individual testimony, oral and written, in answer to hundreds of letters and telephone calls • Internet databases, including Internet Movie Database and All-Movie Guide, and many more specialised web sites devoted to British film and theatre • The International Motion Picture Almanac (various years) and the International Television Almanac (various years) • André Siscot’s Les gens du cinéma [Cinema’s People], Paris 1998.\n\nNotes to the reader The encyclopedia is obviously organised on alphabetic lines, whether the headwords indicate individuals, companies, studios, institutions or thematic entries. Within entries, words appearing in small capitals indicate a cross-reference to other entries, though some discretion has been exercised with regard to these. For instance, the word ‘comedy’ is not always high­ lighted if it is simply used in passing; the general rule is that the word is highlighted in such cases only if the reference is of a kind to suggest that it may be useful to follow up such a term in a thematic reference. All proper names, whether of individuals, companies, studios or institutions, are crossreferenced. Sometimes capitals are used even if the wording isn’t exactly the same – e.g., documentary, documentary films, doc­u­men­tary movement, etc – but if it nevertheless seems worth making the cross-reference. Names given in bold in the text of an entry indicate that this person will not have a separate entry, though the actual name may be listed alphabetically when this is thought to be helpful. Individual biographical entries begin with dates and places of birth, and where relevant, death. Where it may reasonably be assumed that a person is dead but the details of place and date have resisted research a question mark is used. If only a town name is given for either birth or death place, this means • that it is in England and is the only town or village of that name (according to the AA ‘Milemaster’ CD), or • that it is so much the better known of two possibilities as to be able to stand alone: for example, Brighton, standing alone clearly refers to the city in Sussex, as distinct from the village in Cambridgeshire; the much less well known village would be followed by its county name, or • that it is so well known (e.g. Chicago) as not to need the country’s name.\n\nThe Encyclopedia of British Film : Fourth Edition, edited by Brian McFarlane, and Anthony Slide, Manchester University Press, 2014. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nIntroduction to the First Edition xxiii\n\nIf only county or country is given, this means that no further reliable information could be found. These biographical entries are followed by a list of either all or a selection of other British films, listed according to release dates. The dates in these lists come at the end of all the films in any given year, and any information following such dates is applicable to all the films in that year. Where information may be applicable to only some of the films of that year, it will be given after each film. If a person’s credits all derive from the performance of one function (e.g., he/she was always a designer), then what follows other british films (include) will be just titles and dates; when he/she performs other functions, this will be noted in ways that will make clear which was relevant to which film, either by breaking up the list into chief functions, or by a parenthetical abbreviation after the particular film. other of course means ‘not referred to in the preceding descriptive paragraph(s)’. Some examples: (1) the last part of the other british films list for James Mason reads: Great Expectations, Inside Out, The Water Babies (UK/Pol) (1975), Voyage of the Damned (1976), Cross of Iron (1977, UK/Ger), Murder by Decree (UK/Can), The Passage (1978), North Sea Hijack (1979), Evil Under the Sun (1981), Group Madness (1983, doc).\n\nWhere no gloss follows the date, it may be assumed that all the films preceding that date are UK unless otherwise noted, as in the cases of The Water Babies and Murder by Decree, and that the first three films were all released in the UK in 1975. (2) in the John Mills entry, the filmography is introduced thus: other british films: (a, unless noted)\n\nand the ‘other’ films from 1947 to 1949 are listed as follows:\n\nCopyright © 2014. Manchester University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nSo Well Remembered (1947), Three Days (d, short), The History of Mr. Polly (+ p) (1948), Friend of the Family (short, narr), The Rocking Horse Winner (+ p) (1949).\n\nIn the one film listed for 1947, he only acted; of the two films for 1949, he only directed the former (a short film) and produced as well as acted in the latter. The + sign always indicates additional to the main function. In many cases, the filmography will be followed by bibliog (to a maximum of three) and giving (auto)biographical works and/or key critical texts. Unless these have some further relevance, they will not be listed again in the select biblio­ graphy at the end of the book. As to film dates, release dates have been based largely on the British Film Institute’s CD-Rom, Film Index International, and on Denis Gifford’s The British Film Catalogue, 1895–1970. On rare occasions when there is a serious gap between dates of production and of release this has been noted. All entries bear either (a) the signature of the contributor; (b) the letters AS (Anthony Slide), who had the major responsibility for silent screen contributions; or (3) no signature, which indi­cates that the entry was written by the book’s compiler/editor.\n\nAbbreviations The following abbreviations have been used: a AA\n\nactor, actress (American) Academy Award (Oscar)\n\nAAn (American) Academy Award nomination add dial additional dialogue adpt adapter adptn adaptation anim animation art d art director ass assistant assoc associate BAA British Academy Award BAAn British Academy Award nomination c cinematographer, director of cinematography/photography cam op camera operator co-(d) (p) (sc) co-(director) (producer) (screenwriter), etc comm commentator commy commentary comp composer cond conductor cont continuity cos des costume design d director des (production) design DOP director of photography (only used anecdotally) doc documentary e editor ex executive fx special effects m music m d music director narr narrator orch orchestration p producer ph photography prod man production manager RN: real name sc screenplay, scriptwriter sd sound st story sup supervising/supervisor supp a supporting actor/actress 2uc second unit unc uncredited w writer (i.e. other than scriptwriter) Examples of use: In the entry for Robert S.

In this case, so many people and institutions have been involved in ways great and small, all of them valuable, that it is hard to know where to begin and it is impossible to name them all. First, though, I must thank the Australian Government’s Research Council without whose extremely generous grant I doubt if I could have undertaken the project. This grant, supplemented by follow-up grants from the Monash University Arts Faculty and its School of Literary, Visual and Performance Studies, made possible the employment of a research assistant for three years and a research trip to London in 2000. Without my research assistant Melinda Hildebrandt the whole process would have taken at least twice as long. I thank her for her patience, good humour, diligence and willingness to exercise initiative. She set up valuable research practices that made the whole project much more manageable than it could otherwise have been, had a happy knack of seeing what needed to be done, and the skill and imagination to ensure that it was. Special thanks are due to Anthony Slide who accepted my invitation to handle the silent cinema entries and did so with the sort of efficiency that made him a pleasure to work with. He also did more than this: he volunteered many further entries and he read the entire manuscript, making many helpful suggestions. There are almost 120 contributors to this book’s 5,800 entries and it is clear that they require special thanks. Many of them volunteered to do extra entries and put me in touch with others who were interested in contributing. For their patience in dealing with editorial suggestions and taking up more of their time than they had anticipated I am greatly indebted.\n\nThe Encyclopedia of British Film : Fourth Edition, edited by Brian McFarlane, and Anthony Slide, Manchester University Press, 2014.

Luke McKernan also performed many other advisory and practical services beyond the demands of this particular role. In Australia, Thelma Gellie and Ian Britain also read everything and were punctilious in their suggestions for amendments. Others who read parts of the manuscript and whom I thank for their insights are Clyde Jeavons, Vincent Porter and Andrew Spicer (UK), Brenda Niall and Tom Ryan (Australia). It is difficult to say how much I owe to the care and encouragement of all these people. It is certainly the case that any remaining errors are mine. There are several groups of people at the British Film Institute to whom I am especially beholden. In the endless checking of dates and places and honorifics and other awards, Janice Healey exercised an unwearying patience and pertinacity that filled many gaps that would otherwise have been difficult for me to deal with from Australia. She has my heartfelt thanks. In the National Film and Television Archive, I was treated with great courtesy and kindness during the two months I spent there doing the kinds of research that could not have been done anywhere else. I thank all the staff of this department, with special mention of John Oliver who has continued to be a valuable source of information, checking all kinds of esoteric ‘facts’. In the BFI National Library, David Sharp was parti­ cularly helpful and Markku Salmi cleared up several problems. My thanks to both. Other institutions to which I must record my thanks include: the Australian Film Institute, Melbourne, and especially to Aysen Mustafa for her unfailing help; the BECTU History Project group, London, who have given me a great deal of support over a number of years, with particular thanks to Roy Fowler who put me in touch with several people who became contributors; the British Society of Cinematographers, whose secretary, Frances Russell, went to endless trouble to find and check information about her members; the Producers’ Alliance for Cinema and Television, with thanks to David Mills; and the Film Studies staff at De Montfort University, Leicester, who organised a useful seminar for the exchange of ideas about the book’s organisation. To Monash University, I owe major thanks for the con­tinued use of office and computer facilities, for the support of many members of the School of Literary, Visual and Performance studies, especially to Clive Probyn and Chris Worth, successive heads of School, to Terry Burke for pro­vid­ing me with valuable video assistance, to Carlin Payne who administered my grant; and for a great deal of help from the Computer Centre, which\n\ntreated me very generously with computer access and advice in dealing with the problems inevit­ably encountered by one who can use a computer without really understanding how it works. In this latter respect, my thanks are also due to Tim Roman and my son Duncan McFarlane. There are also numerous individuals connected with British cinema who responded to requests for information and advice. These include: Michael Craig, Bryan Forbes, Martyn Friend, Peter Handford, Julie Harris, the late Sir Anthony HavelockAllan, Jean Kent, Nicolas Roeg, Dinah Sheridan, Sylvia Syms and especially Sir Sydney Samuelson, helpful on many occasions, and the nearly two hundred other actors, directors, cinema­ tographers, producers, production and costume designers and other personnel who responded with courtesy and precision to what must sometimes have seemed imperti­ nent or tedious requests, by letter, email and telephone, for the giving or clarifying of biographical information that had proved elusive. They made the project seem worth the effort. And I thank those busy agents who passed on either letters or telephone enquiries. Other individuals who should be gratefully named include: Roger Mellor, for researching awards won by British film personnel; Cathy Surowiec who very generously made available the fruits of her own still-to-be-published research on production and costume designers, and especially in relation to birth and death dates and places; Geoff Brown, who cleared up several matters of fact; David Burnand, of the Royal College of Music, for fielding many queries about British film music; Geoff Mayer, for the loan of many tapes of British films; Monica Maughan, who gave me very useful answers to queries; my daughters Susannah McFarlane and Sophie Scully and my daughter-in-law Meredith McFarlane, for their various kinds of assistance. In regard to the processes involved in putting this book together, I must thank an invariably courteous, helpful and painstaking team at Methuen. Also, in relation to the British Film Institute’s share in the publishing, I am grateful to publisher Andrew Lockett for his continuing interest in the project over several years and to Sophie Contento for her help with illustrations. Finally, my main thanks, with my love, go to my wife Geraldine, who has had far more exposure to British cinema than she ever bargained for, and has borne heroically with more than three years of necessary, if enjoyable, monomania.
