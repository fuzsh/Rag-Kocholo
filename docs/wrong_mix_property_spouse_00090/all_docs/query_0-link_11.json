INDEX OF WILLS PROVED IN THE rerogaftSe Court of £anfer8urg* 1383 — 1558- AND NOW PRESERVED IN THE PRINCIPAL PROBATE REGISTRY, SOMERSET HOUSE, LONDON. COMPILED BY J. CHALLENOR C. SMITH, SUPERINTENDENT OF THE LITERARY DEPARTMENT, PROBATE REGISTRY, SOMERSET HOUSE. LONDON : ISSUED TO SUBSCRIBERS BY Cfje U3riti0f) iRecotU ©odetp, LimtteD, 1893. HERTFORD PRINTED BY STEPHEN AUSTIN AND SONS. 1424288 INTRODUCTION. The Will-registers were used as the basis of this index, and the filed wills as well as the act-books were afterwards examined for the purpose of obtaining supplemental information. The court-act books would undoubtedly have yielded some additional matter, but at the cost of so much labour as to have involved an indefinite postponement of the publication of the work. Omissions from calendars. — A large number of names that are omitted, through inadvertence or other causes, from the old calendars will be found here. Amongst these omissions there are about 59 names of persons whose wills were proved before the prior and chapter of Canterbury during two vacancies of the arch- bishopric * and a few names of testators whose wills were found on the file under the circumstances related in the foot-note on the first page of the text. Testatrix married more than once. — Whenever it was observed, in the process of making this index, that a testatrix in her will alluded to more husbands than one, such will was indexed under the several surnames of the husbands. Varied forms of surnames. — If the testator's surname, in any particular will, was variously spelt, that which appeared to be the prevailing form was adopted ; but if the variation seemed to be at all essential, the will was indexed under both forms. Although the system in this lexicographical arrangement has * See a foot-note, p. 15. These wills form the residue of a very much larger number, a list of which may be seen in the appendix to the 8th report of the Historical MSS. Commission. It was there stated that \"it would be in vain to make a search in the Will office in London \" for the Wills in such list, but as a matter of fact the very large majority of them were properly registered and calendared in the P.C.C. series. — See Genealogist, 1st series, vi, 48. vi INTRODUCTION. been to place under a key-name all wills relating to a particular cognomen, there can be no doubt that many inadvertent deviations from that method will be detected. A few examples will show h m much care is required in compiling and also in consulting- such an index as this. Members of one family make their wills Indifferently as \"Vqyce\" and \" Foys \" \\ a Hawtayne writes his n unc Haltheyn ; Robert Heryong, will 1500, was father of Richard Harry yonge, will 1545; there is an inventory of the goods of Gilbert Cayse, 14S9, whose will occurs herein as Keyes ; Joan Hebson, wiil 1503, was widow of John Ebson, will 1502 ; Hugh Symper, will 1505, appears in the Salop Visitation as \"de sco pctro.\" An initial F. and Vh. were used interchangeably even in what would appear to be improbable cases. Pi v 1: OF ABODE. — The plan here adopted has been that if a person's will indicated his connection with two or more distinct , ; ties, the fact should be shown in the index. It is not, how- be supposed that the wills were so closely examined as lo allow of an invariable conformity to that system. [1 sh mid be borne in mind that the place at which a person made his will was not necessarily his domicile. Distinction between will and testament. — There occur in th ' registers, and in this index, instances of the distinction ma le between the will (which dealt with real estate), testament (which concerned the personalty). Commonly 11 w mid be written in English or Norman-French and the iment in Latin. The term \"codicil \"was usually applied to d from a testament, and what is nowadays a \"codicil \" was frequently known as a \"schedule.\" UCS IN THE SERIES. — The most reasonable way of ac- counting for the gaps in the series of Prerogative Court wills is to appose that some books, or parts of books, are lost. STYLE. — The dates in this volume are according to old style. WILLS, UNLI iSOl KERWISE SPECIFIED, — It is to be understood that every entry in this index relates to a wttl% save when such w )p! i a , \" administration,\" \" acquittance,\" etc., arc added. NO ACT OF PROBATE. — In the earlier registers are to be found a large number of wills to which there is no Act of probate. In such cases it was necessary to draw an inference as to the year INTRODUCTION. vii in which the probate may have issued, but the date thus supplied is, of course, of no authority. ERRORS HEREIN. — It is hoped that whenever errors are de- tected in this index, a notification of them, addressed to the Super- intendent of the literary department, will be forwarded to the principal registry in order that the copies of the volume which are in daily use may be rectified. Jurisdiction of the Court. It would appear that the archbishops of Canterbury began to claim their prerogative testamentary jurisdiction as early as the reign of Henry III. but a long period elapsed before such claim was fully recog- nized by their Suffragans.* In the same manner that a bishop claimed the exclusive right to issue a grant in cases where the deceased person had goods (\"bona\") in divers archdeaconries or jurisdictions within his diocese, the arch- bishop asserted a claim whenever the goods were in more than one diocese within his province. In process of time there grew up a custom of limiting the arch- bishop's powers to cases in which the deceased had possessed \" bona notabilia \" or personal estate of \" considerable value \" outside the diocese in which the person's death took place, and a minimum value of five pounds was held to constitute this particular archiepiscopal jurisdiction. As was inevitable, the bishop was apt to encroach upon the testa- mentary authority of his archdeacons, and he himself was in like manner supplanted by his archbishop, who began to issue grants quite irrespec- tive of the existence of \" bona notabilia.\" This usurpation gradually increased until in process of time the officials of the Prerogative Court acquired a prescriptive right to make a grant in the estate of any person dying within the province, and thus many of the smaller Courts were virtually superseded many years before the passing of the Probate Act, 1857. In regard, however, to the period dealt with in this index, viz. 1 383-4 to 1558, it is probable that the testators in the very large majority of instances possessed \" bona notabilia.\" * See in the introduction to Coote's \"Ecclesiastical Practice,\" an interesting historical account of the origin and development of the law and practice in regard to the probate of Wills and granting of letters of administration. \\ iii INTRODUCTION. The entry of Administration of the goods of John Conwardby, 1384 (2 Rous) contains an allusion to another constituent part of the archbishop's prerogative. The intestate is stated to have had: — M DSnulla bona de quib} testari potuit in dius dioc Cant puinc Bnon vlf marc in ptibj CaleS vbi oms ct oimoda iurdicco eccca ct eSciciu ciiisdiTi ad pfatii rev prem racone guerra^ in? dnm nrm regem Angi et Regem Francie existent ec' notof ptinet.\" A' instruments with which register \"Blamyr\" opens (see xvii) will be found an appointment of a commissary to the arch- bishop for the town and confines of Calais. The provincial had likewise authority, by virtue of his prerogative, to bear and decide causes arising from disputes in connection with the wills or the administrations of persons dying possessed of bona notabilia or with tin: accounts relating to such persons' estates, or with legacies contained in their wills. v be had the sole right to issue a grant of probate or adminis- tration in the estates of his Suffragans, irrespectively of their having held bona notabilia. In the notes relating to register \"Marche\" (page xii) there will be found a quotation from a probate-act which exemplifies the fact that the archbishop's prerogative failed to supersede the exempt jurisdiction which certain of the religious houses had derived from the apostolic see. Court of Delegates. An Appeal from the Prerogative Court lay only to the King in Chancery, who appointed Delegates to \"hear and decide\" suits. In BOme instances the Court of Delegates, on the determination of a Cause, I a Grant of Probate or of Administration, and inasmuch as there most have been in the majority of cases that came before that Court, an estate sufficiently large to justify costly proceedings, it is obvious that the Wills and Admons. recorded in the Delegates' Court, and now preserved at Somerset House, are of more than average interest and importance. Such records are, however, but few in number, and date back no further than 1651, the earlier documents being lost. The cause-papers connected with these testamentary suits as well as those relating to ecclesiastical and other matters that came before the Court, are at the Public Record Office. By the Act of 2 and 3, Will. IV., c. 92, the powers of the Court of Delegates were transferred to the King in Council, but no change was made in the method of registering INTRODUCTION. ix proceedings in Appeal cases, and the Delegates' records therefore remain in one series. Extant Prerogative Records. For the period covered by this index the extant Prerogative Court Records are as follows : — (1) Will Registers, which likewise contain a few entries of Adminis- tration grants, as well as some Sentences, Commissions, Acquittances, etc., and a small number of non-testamentary ecclesiastical instruments. (2) Filed Wills, with which are a few Sentences, etc. (3) Calendars. (4) Probate-act books. (5) Administration-act book, (a fragment only). (6) Administration bonds. (7) Court-act books. (8) Inventories. Registers. These volumes for the most part contain nothing beyond the transcripts of Wills. A few of the earliest registers, however, contain either preambles or probate acts which furnish items of information relating to the history of the Prerogative Court. Book \" Rous,\" the earliest of the series, opens with the following preamble : — ROUS. — \" Registrum de tempore Reuerendissimi in Xpo patris ac domini Dni Wiftmi Courtenay dei gra Cantuarien' Archiepi tocius Anglie primatis et aplice sedis legati de pro- bacon' approbacon' et insinuacon' ac administracon' bono^ comission' testato^ % ab intestato defunctojp puincie sue Can- tuarien' infra ipam tempore mortis eo^dem plura et diuersa bona notabilia infra diuersas dioceses eiusdem puincie haben- cium ac de citacon' inhibicon' acquietanc' Inferio^q3 Judicum in ea pte facto^ et attemptato^ cassacon' annullacon' et ceteris testamenta et bona hui9 concernen' p dicti reuendissimi patris Comissar' subscript' vigore p^rogatiue ecctie Cantuar' ac consuetudinis laudabilis Time prescripte ac Commissionu ab eodem Reuerend' pre sub sigillo suo magno et oblongo eisdnl Commissar' concessa^ factis et habitis de Anno Domini Mitttno CCCmo octuagesimo quarto ac ceteris annis subscquen' vt inferius clare patet.\" X INTRODUCTION. It may be inferred from the wording of the probates in the case of some of the earliest wills in this volume {e.g. Walworth, fo. i, Burne, fo. i), that the grants in these particular instances issued from the Arches Court. This supposition falls in with Mr. Coote's statement (introd. p. 81), that there was no actual Prerogative Court, with its own officers, until 1443, and in that case it might naturally happen that wills j :ov, .! in connection with one jurisdiction of the archbishop would be entered in the same register with those pertaining to another. Some few wills in the earlier part of this volume were proved before \"Audiencie dni causa* auditore.\" It is supposed that in the Court of Audience, -rants were issued under the direct personal mandate of the archbishop, and it is probable that the series of records known as \" Lambeth wills and administrations\" represents the testamentary func- tions of that Court. Following the Probate Act to the will of Alexander Bach, bishop of St, Asaph, (fo. 3), is a paragraph (to which there is a marginal note \"feoda debita dn'o \") :— \" Et memorandum qd de consuetudine a tempore % p tempus cuius contrarij mcmoria hominum non existit pacifice T; in- concusse obsuata legitimeq3 p°scripta T; obtenta dns Archieps Cantuar' qui pro tempore fucrit pcipiet T; habebit a quott Epo Assaven' decedente anulum suum pontificalem % signetum suum, sigillum suum oblongum, optimum palafridum optimum ciphum Capam plumalem cellam rt frenum Capillum ac ocrias *t calcaria quib^ idem Eps dum vixit vtebat1' Et hec omia T, ta pcepit T; habuit dc Executorib3 p9dci dni Alexandri Epi defuncti Rciiendissimus in xpo pater dils meus Archieps qui nunc est.\" On leaf 36 d. is an acquittance of the executors of the bishop of W >r< ester, June 25, 1396, followed by an acknowledgment on the part of the archbishop that he has received of the prior of Worcester, by the hands of Richard Thurgrym, esquire, certain monies accruing to the metropolitan during the vacancy of the see of Worcester. 'There can be little doubt that the next two leaves, 37 and 38, form part of the < onteinporancous archiepiscopal register, in which there is an hiatus of about 5 years (including that of 1395, to which these two leaves refer). The former of these leaves opens with the concluding part of an oath of fealty to the Pope, probably made by Richard Metfoid on his INTRODUCTION. xi translation to the see of* Salisbury. No doubt this instrument was of even date with that which follows it. The latter is an oath of canonical obedience to the archbishop, made by Richard Metford, bishop of Salisbury, in the chapel of the manor of \" Maydenston,\" Feb. 16, 1395, attested by a notary, and witnessed by Mr. Adam de Mottrum, licenciate in decrees, archdeacon of Canterbury, and Walter Gybbes, licenciate in laws, canon of Exeter \" et pluribus aliis.\" Leaf 37, d. contains: — (1) A mandate of the archbishop to John Maydenheth, canon of Sarum, who was his official for that city and diocese during the vacancy of the see, to deliver the episcopal registers and seals to the newly- appointed bishop. Dated Feb. 16, 1395. (2) An instrument under the hand of pope Boniface IX., dated at Rome 8 Kal. Nov., 1395, and addressed to the archbishop, notifying the translation of the archbishop of Dublin to the see of Chichester. (3) Oath of canonical obedience to the metropolitan, made in the chapel of the manor of Maydenston, Feb. 16, 1395, by Robert, bishop of Chichester. A notarial attestation is appended. Leaf 38. Archbishop's mandate to the bishop of Sarum requiring him to deliver the registers, etc., belonging to the said bishop's late diocese of Chichester to the new bishop thereof. Dated Feb. 16, 1395. Leaf 46. The Will of Christina Mordon, of Faversham, Kent, widow, was proved 8 Kal. June, 1392, by her son John Mordon, a monk of Faversham Abbey, whose licence to act in the capacity of executor, granted by Robert the abbot of the monastery, is here registered. In leaves 41 to 70 are transcripts of Wills c. 139 1-3 ; then follow ten blank pages ; after which, from leaf 76, the volume is completed by several quires of wills of much later date (c. 1442-54). Inasmuch as the succeeding register (\"Marche\"), and almost the whole of the third one (\" Luffenam\"), are of earlier date than these last quires of \" Rous\" ; there is a reasonable inference that these latter formed originally a part of some other volume. There is, in other ways, ample proof of the extreme carelessness with which the quires or separate leaves were sorted previous to their being bound, e.g. in several instances the transcript of a Will is to be found in two or three sections dispersed through the volume. The dates, likewise, are throughout this register very far from being consecutive. On a fly-leaf at the end of \"Rous\" is a mutilated copy of a document dated at Cambridge, June 16, 1472, relating to some subsidy which was raised amongst the neighbouring clergy. Several names of Cambridgeshire incumbents are given therein. XI1 INTRODUCTION. March;:. — In the second register, \" Marche,\" there will be found a few preambles and Acts which allude to the question of jurisdiction, e.g. on the iirst fly-leaf and on leaves 15, 16, 24, 74, 77, 86, 177, 226, 256. B ik \"Marche\" obviously comprises what were originally the com- p >nent parts of two separate registers, the second of which began with what is now leaf 226. The preamble at the beginning of the register reads thus : — \"Registrum prerogatiue eccie Cantuarien de probacion in- sinuation et approbacion testamentorum et comissionum ab intestate decedenciu ftencium bona notabilia in dius diocesib5 puincie Cantuarien et Comissiori admistracioil bonoru huioi Ac Acquietanc in ca parte fact et concess p Magrm Johannem Perche ciicum Curie Cantuarien Registrariu ac eiusdem Curie Rc^istroru Custod Reuerendissimi 1 xpo pris % dm dni Thome Arundell dei gra Cantuarien Archiepi tocius Anglie pmatfj % aplice sedis legati Comissariu a xvij kin Augusti Anno Dni M°.

At about folio 30 one or two quires are misplaced and imperfect, and at the end of folio 32 is a fresh heading in these words : — Registrum prerogatiue eccfie Cantuarien de probacionibus insinuacionib3 et approbacionib3 testamento^ decedencium nenciu bona notabiia in diuersis dioc prouincie Cant et Comis- sion admtstracion bono^ huioi ac Acquietanc in ea pte fact et X i V INTRODUCTION.

At the end of the book \"Marche\" is an index to the latter of the two registers of which it really consists. Luffenam. — The Wills in this book are not in strict chronological order and in many cases they are imperfect. The preamble reads thus: — \" Rcgistrum p?rogatiue eccHe Cantuarien de pbaconi'b3 insinuaconib} et appbaconibus testamento^ decedencium habcncium bona notabilia in diuersis dioc puincie Cantuarien T Comission administracon' bono^ huibi ac Acquietac in ea parte fact et concess per magrm Jofrnem Lyndefeld Curie Cantuarien Exaiatorem generalem Reuendissimi in Xpo patris et domini domini Henrici Dei gfa Cantuarien Archiepi tocius Anglic primatis et aprice sedis Legati, Comissarium generalem a festo sancti Johannis baptiste anno domini Miltimo quadragentesimo vicesimo tercio et sic deinceps.\" On leaf 268 is an example of a \" long act.\" STOKTON has a preamble in these words : — \" Hie inferius inscribuntur et registrantur testamenta ap- probat tempore recolcnde memorie Thome Bourgchier Dei ia Cant Archiepiscopi ab annis domini Miltmo CCCC quin [uagesimo quarto Et mensis Septembf die octauo.\" The flyleaves of this register are sheets of a 15th century MS. and appear to form part of a homily concerning the office of preaching. On leaf 171 is a licence from John, abbot of the monastery of Holy Cross, Walt ham (of the Order of St. Augustine, London), \" subject immediately to the apostolic see,\" to Richard Wrangill, canon of the : monastery, permitting the latter to accept the executorship of the Will of Master John Brampton, chaplain in the said monastery, to v.*ii. h office the said Richard, together with master Thomas Wyche, scholar in sacred theology, was appointed. The Will in question does not appear in the P.C.C. series. INTRODUCTION. XV Godyn has no preamble. According to the old calendar there should be at the last folio of this register a Will of one Stephen Patinmaker. The Will which stands last in order in the volume is the incomplete one of Sir W7illiam Tyrrell, so it may be surmised that a membrane which is now lost contained the missing portion of the last mentioned Will as well as the complete Will of Stephen Patinmaker. Wattys has no preamble. Logge has no preamble, but on leaf 172 a heading: — [H]ic inferius inscribuntur et Registrant1' testamenta appro- bata auc'te Religosoru virorum prions et Capituli Eccfie cristi Cantuarien' sede Archiepali ifem per obitum bone memorie dm Thome Bourgchier nup Cardinalis et Archiepi Cant' vacante anno dni Millesimo CCCC octuagesimo vjt0 Milles has a preamble, thus : — \" Hie inferius inscribuntr % registrantur testamenta probata et approba't tempore reuerendissimi in Xpo pris et domini dni Johannis dei gra Cant archiepi a nono die mensis Decembf Anno dni Miftmo CCCClxxxvjt0 vsq3 ad et in %c\" The quires forming this volume are not always in chronological order, and in some instances single leaves appear to be misplaced. Dogett, Vox. Neither has a preamble. In each of them are some incomplete Wills. Horne. No preamble. A sentence prefixed to the first Will in this book embodies a copy of a Commission nominating William Barons, LL.D., as Commissary-General to the Prior and Chapter of Christ Church, Canterbury, during vacancy of the See, September 29, 1500. Moone has no preamble. It contains on leaf 76 another transcript of the commission last referred to. Blamyr. The preamble to book \"Blamyr\" reads thus : — \"Registrum reuerendissimi in xpo patris et domini dni Henrici Dene primo epi Sajp. ac deinde diuina gra in Archiepm Can? postulati et per sanctissimu in xpo patrem et dam dnm Alexandru diuina prouidentia eiusdem nois papam sextum, a vinculo quo ecclesia Catfr Sas cui preerat tenebatur absolut , ad ecciiam Metropolitanam xpi Cant septimo kt Junij anno domini millesimo quingentesimo primo translati Quarum quidem postulationis et Trans tenores inferius sunt conscript'.\" xvi INTRODUCTION. As was pointed out by the present bishop of Oxford many years ago (Regist. Sacr. Angl. p. x) the first two quires (in which this preamble is included) of this book, are really a portion of the missing archiephcopaU as distinguished from the prerogative, register of Arch- bishop Deane. Following the preamble is a series of ten Bulls of pope Alexander VI. The first eight of these bear date 7 Kal. June (June 25), 1501. No. 1 is for the translation of Henry (Deane) from the bishopric of Sarum to the archbishopric of Canterbury. No. 2 is for the absolution of the said bishop. Nos. 3 to 7 are respectively directed to the Chapter of Canterbury, the Suffragans of the province, the clergy of the city and diocese of Canterbury, the vassals of the same metropolitan church, and the people of the aforesaid city and diocese ; these five Bulls enjoin obedience, reverence, fealty, etc., to the archbishop elect. No. 8 is directed to the bishops (sic) of Coventry and Lichfield directing them to receive the oath of the same archbishop, the form of such oath being appended. No. 9 \" Bulla assignationis pallij \" is dated 7 Id. June (June 7) in the same year. No. 10 bears the same date and is directed to the \"bishops\" of Coventry and Lichfield \" ad recipiend' juramentum super reception' pallij \" by the said Henry, bishop of Sarum. Annexed to this bull are \" forma dandi pallium\" and \" forma juramenti super reception' pallij.\" Following these instruments are (1) a repetition of the \"juramentum fidelitatis\" which formed a schedule to Bull No. 8 supra. It agrees therewith verbatim and probably is a transcript made from the oath after it had been subscribed by the said archbishop elect. (2) An instrument dated at Westminster July 13, 1501, whereby Abp. Deane ies to the pope that he had made the oath of fealty and canonical obedience in the terms required of him (as before mentioned by Bull 5). (3) A similar instrument in which the Abp. certifies that the bishop of Coventry and Lichfield had administered to him the oath r receptione pallii\" in a certain oratory or chapel contiguous to Sr. Stephen's Chapel, Westminster. This is dated from the Archbishop's hou e of residence at Westminster, July 23, 1501.

Appended to this instrument is a ratification of it, \" quantum ad nos pertinet,\" by the dean and chapter of Canterbury, October 31, 1502. At folio 21 there occurs a fresh heading incidental to the death of the archbishop (Deane) and the devolution of his prerogative rights upon the Prior and Chapter of Canterbury. There is likewise an entry of the appointment of master Roger Church as Commissary-General of the Capitular body during the vacancy of the See. \"Blamyr\" has a larger proportion than usual of verbal inaccuracies and it would appear that many of the quires were never collated with the original wills. Holgrave has on its first page a preamble, to which succeeds a Commission appointing mr. John Yonge, LL.D. Commissary-General of the archbishop. Adeane and Bennett have no preamble. Fetiplace. No preamble. The act to the will of Thomas Iden at fo. 6 sets forth that the deceased had \" bona notabilia,\" yet the arch- bishop gave licence to a suffragan to grant probate. The actual wording is that although the testator : — \"bona ac terras et tenementa sive debita tam in dioc Roffen' ubi obijt quam in dioc' Cant' habuit ^ ptinuit ad instante peticone % desideriu RcU pris dni Jofris tuc Roffen' Epi recognoscentf approbacoem dicti testi ad p?fat' Rmu pfem ex causis pimlss' ptinere, ex certis cais dcm Rn™ prem movetib^ cocessit eidem Rdo pri approbacoem et insinuacbem testamenti ipius defuncti non obstan dcus Thomas fruit bona ac terr' T: ten' in dioc' p^dictf ut p)fertr, et dedit licencia eide Rd0 pfi huToi testm p se vel officiar' suos approband',\" etc. Holder and Ayloffe have no preambles.

Also an appointment of John Mascall, gent., to the same office April 23, 1529. XX INTRODUCTION. MAYNWARYNG has no preamble. Bodfelde. This register has a preamble from the wording of which it is to be inferred that Cardinal Wolsey (archbishop of York) on some pretext claimed to exercise prerogative jurisdiction in the southern province jointly with the archbishop of Canterbury. The preamble runs thus : — Tcstamcnta decedenciu infra prouincia Cantuarien' habenciii dum vixerunt et mortis eorum temporibus bona jura siue credita in diuersis dioc' seu Jurisdicc' Cant' prouincie aucte Reuerendissimojp Domino^ Thome tituli sancte Cecilie sacro- sancte Romane ecctie presbiteri Carlis Eboracen' Archiepi anglie primatis et Cancellarij Apliceq3 sedis eciam de latere Legati, Ac Witt mi dei gracia Cantuarien' Archiepi tocius Anglie primatis et aplice sedis Legati nati,\" etc. This heading is followed by a copy of a Commission dated January 3, 1522, whereby the two primates jointly appoint John Alen \" utrius3 juris doctor\" (canon and prebendary of Lincoln) and John Cockys \" legum doctor\" to be their Commissaries. Porch. This register received its designation from a misreading of the testator's surname, Forth, in the will with which the register commences. It has no preamble. Jankyn also has no preamble. Thower. At folio 18 a preamble reads: — \" Registrum venerabilium et Religiosorum viroru domini Thome Goldwell ecctie metropolitice xpi Cantuarien' prions et eiusdem ecctie Capli de et sup probation^ et approbationibus testamento^ . . . coram egregio viro magro Ricardo Gwent dccrctorum doctore eccrie predicte prerogatiue Custode ac prion's ct Capituli predicto^ Comissario sede Archiepali Cant' . . . vacan' \" Crumwbll. This register borrowed its name from Thomas Crum- well, the King's Vicegerent in matters ecclesiastical. It is in many respects distinct from the main scries which runs in complete chrono- logical sequence independently of it. The preamble shews that Cromwell as Secretary exercised, in the King's name, testamentary jurisdiction and it is not easy to see in what respect the power thus INTRODUCTION. xxi exerted is to be distinguished from that pertaining to the archbishop.* It wili be observed that there is an almost entire absence of Londoners' wills in this volume. The preamble, which is followed by a Commission to William Petre dated Jan. 13, 1535-6, reads thus : — \" Hie inferius regrantr Testa coram venerabili viro magro Guilielmo Petreo legum doctore Egregij viri magri Thome Crtiwell, illustrissimi in xpo principis et dominj nostri drij Henrici octavi dei gracia Anglie et Francie Regis fidei defen- sors dominj Hibern' ac in terris ecctie Anglicane sub xpo capitis supremi Secretarij primarij ac rotulorum siue scriniorum suoru magri et Custodis Necnon ad causas eccfiasticas auctori- tate dicti Illustrissimi principis vti supremi capitis ecctie pfclce quomodolit tractand vicem gereu vicarij generalis et officialis principalis Comissario auctoritate dicti Illustrissimi principis et dominj nfi regis approbat insinuata vnacum tenore comis- sionis ipius magri Guilielmi Petrei.\" One of the flyleaves to this register appears to have originally been a part of some legal treatise and is in 15th century handwriting. Hogen contains wills of an earlier period than those in Crumwell. It has a preamble in these words : — \" Testamenta coram Reuerendissimo in xpo pre et Domino domino Thoma pmissione diula Cant Archiepo totius Anglie primate et Metropolitano eiusq3 auctoritate et vigore ecctie sue metropolitice xpi Cantuarien prerogatiue approbata et insinuata a penultimo die mens Marcij Anno Domini Miftimo quingentesimo Tricesimo tertio Quo die dictus Reuerendissimus pater in Archiepm Cantuarien consecratus dicta^ testamenta inferius regrata sunt et conscripta Magro Richardo Gwent decretorum doctore dicti Reuerendissimi pris et sue prerogatiue Custode et Commissario ac Thoma Argall dee p?rogatiuc Regrario.\" This is followed by the primate's Commission to the said Richard Gwent. During the period covered by this register Henry VIII. became \" supreme head of the English church \" and incidentally he assumed a nominal, if not actual, authority in regard to testamentary matters. * It is, however, possible that the wills recorded in this register were proved before Cromwell during a Visitation, or Visitations, made in the King's name. — See notes to register \" Hogen.\" xxii INTRODUCTION. On folio 27 there is inserted a new form of heading, bearing date October 12, 1555, and in this, the archbishop is alleged to exercise his prerogative jurisdiction as deputy to the Kiiig. this register there is a copy of an undated instrument which sets forth that the king as the supreme ecclesiastical authority intends making a Visitation of the whole clergy; that Thomas Crumwell, his secretary, who by letters patent was appointed Vicegerent, Vicar- general and official for such purpose, is burdened with urgent State affairs and therefore unable to undertake such Visitation, wherefore the King at the humble petition of Thomas (Cranmer) archbishop of Canterbury constitutes the said archbishop his deputy for the exercise of various episcopal functions including the granting of probates and of letters of administration. ! \\ 1 BY, AiENGER, Spert. These books have short preambles in which there is no allusion to the king's jurisdiction. At folio 23 Spert, is entered a Commission bearing date July 24, 1543, under whic h the archbishop (\" domini nri . . . regis .... fulcitus\") con- stitutes John Cocks, LL.D., his Commissary-General in respect of testamentary business in the city, diocese, or province of Canterbury. PYNNYNG. No preamble. There is at fo. 20 a commission similar to that just quoted, to Wm. Cooke, LL.D., to perform nice of Commissary and Master of the Prerogative Court. This iment bears date January 13, 1546-7, and has a ratification by the dean and chapter of Canterbury, dated ten days later. ALEN, POPULWELL, Coode. These have no preamble. In the last part of register Coode (and following the month of December) are transcripts of some wills proved in 1547, as to which wills, see notes to \"Filed Wills.\" BUCKS and Powell have no preamble. 1 ' ' has a short one, and at folio 20 a heading in these words: — \" Regi bum venerabilium virorum Magri Niciioi Wootton \\ trill ; 5 J uri 1 >octoris Decani Eccrie Metropolis Christi Cant' ; Capituli ad quos omnimoda Jur£cio Spualis et ccclcsiastica que ad Archiepm Cant' sede plena pertinuit (ipa sede per Attincturam Thome Cranemer nuper Cantuarien Archiepi xiij\" die mens' Nouembris Anno Domini Miftimo quingen0 liijtto de aha prodicone attincti vacante) notorie . dinoscitur pcrtincre super approbaconibus tcstametorum,\" etc. . . . \" a dco xiij0 die Nouembris.\" f INTRODUCTION. xxiii More has no preamble. Ketchyn opens with an illuminated frontispiece which represents Cardinal Pole presiding in, perhaps, an ecclesiastical court. A preamble reads thus : — \" Registrum Reveredissimi patris Domini Reginaldi misera- tione divina tituli sancte Marie in Cosmedim Sacrosanctc Romane ecctie presfcri Cardinalis Pole nuncupati Cantuarien Archiepi totius Anglie primatis et Aplice sedis Legati nati.

Cooke [?for having used ecclesiastical authority in the past] and empowers him, so far as regards his said office, to obtain a priest or priests and other ecclesiastical or lay persons to assist him in dealing with contumacious persons, etc. Dated at Lambeth, 8 Id. Feb., 1555. Wrastley, Noodes, Welles. Neither of these registers contains a preamble. It will be found that the \"folio\"* in Will-registers contains almost invariably a quire of 8 membranes, the first of which is labelled with the numeral. (When ink-written arable figures are found they should be ignored.) Filed Wills. The statement usually made to the effect that the Prerogative Court \"original\" wills date as far back as 1484 is some- what misleading, for in the first place a full half of the earlier tiled- wills are merely transcripts, and secondly, with the exception of a single will bearing the date just quoted, there are none of date prior to 1496, Occasionally it is hard to say whether a will on the file is * There is another use of the word \"folio\" by which it is applied to a group of either 90 or 72 words, the origin of which use may perhaps be surmised. Assuming that the scale of charges made by scriveners in former times for copies of legal documents was in proportion to the number of leaves (or \"folios\") which such instruments con- tained, there would certainly grow up a habit of spreading the contents of a document over an unduly large number of sheets. One frequently meets with 16th century MSS. in which the foolscap page uniformly contains either 12 or 15 lines with 6 words in each, and it may therefore be inferred that a rule had been made fixing a minimum number of lines and words for each page ; thus the word folio would come to be applied to a precise number of 90 or 72 words. XXVI INTRODUCTION. an original one or not, e.g., there are wills of W. Mone and J. Walle both proved Nov. 13, 1526, and written on the two sides of a half- sheet of foolscap paper and either of these wills might well be taken for an original one. The list of these documents which is given in tabular form in the Parliamentary Return for 1832 (appendix, p. 545) is quite untrust- worthy in one or two points. For instance, if the compiler of that Return found in the bundle a solitary will pertaining to a particular month, he stated that the file for that month was extant although ips there were proved in that same month 30 or 40 other wills, the originals of which are wanting. Incorrect endorsements caused further errors in the Report, e.g., the only will endorsed and filed as '•.March 1515,\" was actually proved in March, 1513-4, and with no other authority than this one document, it was returned that the wills for March 15 14-5 were extant. Again, the file for March 1544-5, was lately found to consist of three wills ; of which, one was rightly placed there, one belonged to March of the succeeding year and the third was proved in February, 1588-9 ! Many instances occur in which there is written upon the will the Act of a probate thereof, which issued in some inferior Court. Cogni- zance of each of these cases is duly taken in this index. Heraldic Seals. The proportion of heraldic seals to be found upon these documents is exceedingly small. Unproved Wills. .A file was found that was labelled \"unin- telligible\" and \"apparently not proved\" (see foot-note page 1). It considered that these wills, even if unproved, ought not to be omitted from this index. The filed wills very rarely supply anything beyond what is in the registers. About 1540-55, schedules of debts are in several instances written upon the will. Almost invariably the testators are in such cases resident in Wales. An inspection of these filed wills reveals the fact that during the religious changes in the middle of the 1 6th century, the theology of a testator would undergo posthumous adjustment at the hands of the Officials. For instance, the words \" in earth supreme head immediately under God\" which are applied to the king in the filed will of T. Harrys, 1554, and in that of W. Sv-yns, 1554, are struck through and do not appear in the register. . In each ease of a will being found on the file {ante 1558-9), a letter \"F\" has been put to the corresponding entry of the name in INTRODUCTION. xxvii tnis index. As has already been shown, the endorsements on the so-called original wills are frequently incorrect and it is quite likely that a few wills belonging to the period here dealt with, are misfiled under a later date. Calendars. In addition to the series of parchment volumes which are now in daily use there are what are known as \"original\" calendars, a term which strictly speaking should be applied only to the calendars in which entries were made de die in diem as the grants issued. As regards, however, the period 1383-15 58 there are no such \" original \" books but merely indexes (six in number) compiled at a somewhat later date. Through their being written on paper, these were soon destroyed by necessary constant handling, whereupon they were superseded by three of the parchment calendars already mentioned. During an examination of these disused books in connection with this introduction, there was found inserted loose in one of them the first half of an alphabetical list of about 600 surnames to each of which is added a christian name and folio. This MS. is undated and has no outward indication of the nature of the volume to which it has related but inasmuch as it includes the names of peers, knights, and ecclesiastics of high rank it was readily ascertained that its period must be about the end of the reign of Henry VIII., whilst a comparison of the MS. with the contemporaneous Court Act books led to the conclusion that it must have been the index to an Act book of Administration grants * of earlier date than any now extant. With the hope of finding the missing portion of the MS. (letters K to Z) a cursory search has been made amongst a residuum of loose and decayed papers belonging to the P.C.C. series. This search met with no success, but there came to light a bundle of bonds c. 33, Henry VIII., an inspection of which furnished a confirmation of the supposition as to the purposes of the MS. index in question. These bonds to a limited extent supplement the MS. by supplying some names that doubtless appeared in the portion of it which is now lost.f The three parchment calendars already alluded to, are very incorrect and imperfect (e.g., in the first volume alone, there are about 100 names either entirely omitted or entered unrecognizably) but as this printed index has no official status it will not technically supersede these old calendars. * Including grants of Administration (with will) de bonis non which it was the custom to classify under Administrations. t It is intended that a copy of this MS., supplemented by the additional names that the newly-discovered bonds furnish, shall form an appendix to vol. ii hereof. xxviii INTRODUCTION. Probate-Act Books. The earliest of this series begins with the date November i, 1526, and ends with September 1538 inclusive. At the end of the volume are 34 entries of : — Acta dc ct super Comissionibus apparitoribus per prouin- ciam Cant aucte Reuerendissimo^ D. Thome Cardinalis Ebo^ Legati de Latere Ac Wiftmi Cant Archiepojp deputat concess et predict Comissioes emanarunt sub sigillis predict D. de dat inferius script / Sequntur. Act book No. 2 runs from November 1, 1548, to April, 1555, inclusive. No. 3 begins with May 1, 1555, and extends to a later date than does this printed index. In a few instances there has been found in these volumes the official M record\"* of a probate, of the issue of which there is no other evidence. Occasionally also these books supply other items of independent information, e.g. :— testator's parish, when not shown in the will, the diocese, which is sometimes the only means of identifying the parish, the quality or occupation of the deceased, the place of death, the issue of second and subsequent grants, the fact of an inventory having been exhibited. Administration Act-book. Administration Act-books of date previous to 1559 are represented solely by the portion of an index to which allusion is made under the heading \" Calendars.\" This fragment relates to grants made c. 1535-49 and contains some 600 names. ADMINISTRATION Bonds. The Parliamentary Return which was made in 1832 states that the series of Administration bonds begins with the year 17 14 but as has already been shown (page xxvii) there have recently been discovered a few which bear a much earlier date, viz., 33 Henry VIII. So far as is known, no others of date earlier than 1558 arc extant. . * The word \" Record \" is used officially in a technical sense as applying specially to the entry in the Act. hook, such entry being regarded as the most authoritative evidence of the MBM of a grant. INTRODUCTION. xxix It may be mentioned incidentally that in the basket of unsorted and fragmentary MSS. which contained those early bonds, are a few of later (17th century) period. The number of these is, however, exceedingly small and bears no appreciable proportion to the immense series of which they should form a part. Court Act-Books. The date of the earliest entry in this series of volumes is Feb. 3, 1535-6, and the first ten books contain, without any break, minutes of proceedings from that date down to Dec. 7, 1559- The contents of these act-books are found to vary in their nature from time to time. In them the Registrar, as a general rule, entered minutes relating not merely to estates concerning which there was actually litigation but also to the very large number of cases in which there was some action taken by the officials, or others, owing perhaps to some trifling informality before or after a grant issued. In this way the volumes give inter alia incidental allusions to a large number of Grants of Administration of which there is no other existing record. These books are unindexed, for the most part ill-written, and in abbreviated latin. Inventories. There is a very large series of these documents, beginning c. 1480. Very few of them are of earlier date than 1600, and apparently none belong to the period 1601 to 1660. From about 17 10 it was not customary for them to be exhibited save when they were specially demanded. Those of date previous to 17 10 are kept in boxes and are in a condition of the utmost confusion with not even an approximation to chronological order. If these should ever be sorted* they will supply, in addition to a very great deal of interesting archaeological material, some names of persons in whose estates grants may be presumed to have issued although there is no other evidence of the fact. This idea is supported by examples that have accidentally presented themselves, thus there are inventories of the estates of Sir Richard Darell, knight, 14.89 (with an allusion to \"the probat of the testament\") and William Pelle otherwise Fyssher of Mykell Henney, Essex, 1492. Neither of these names appears in the Calendar. * Unfortunately there is a vast amount of more pressing work to be first done. The original staff of five clerks engaged in the Ancient Record Department at the principal Probate Registry was reduced some years ago to the wholly inadequate number of three, and the constantly increasing use of this department by the literary and general public impedes still further, and to a very serious extent, the production of indices which are urgently needed. XXX INTRODUCTION. The thanks of the British Record Society and of the public are due to Lord Hannen, who, as president of the probate division, allowed the MS. of this index to be placed at the disposal of the society with a view to printing and publication. Sir Francis Jeune, who now presides in the same division, has also expressed a sympathetic interest in the work. ( It has been thought desirable to append the following notes and schedules. They appeared in vol. xlvi of the Register of the New England Historic- Genealogical Society , by whose permission they are re-produced here. ) INDEX OF WILL-REGISTERS AND CALENDARS IN THE PREROGATIVE COURT OF CANTERBURY. Will-registers of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury. From time immemorial these MS. books have been labelled with, and identified by, names — not numbers nor dates. The inaccuracy, and consequent inconvenience, inseparable from the use of numerals for such purposes sufficiently show the advantage of (and perhaps the reason for) the method adopted in the prerogative office. No doubt it was found impracticable to adhere rigidly to any particular plan in selecting names for the successive volumes, but at any rate the designations were, from whatever cause, chosen on different systems at different periods. With the exception of book \" Crumwell,\" the 54 earliest registers bore the names of the testators whose wills happened to occur first in the respective volumes. Register \"Crumwell\" (1536-40) took that title from Thomas Cram- well,* at that time the King's Vicegerent in ecclesiastical (including of course testamentary) matters. This volume is, in many respects, distinct from the main series, and there is a strong presumption that it represents a jurisdiction which the Vicegerent claimed and exercised, independent of the Archbishop's prerogative. From and after the 55th volume (\"Peter\") the registers down to 1650 are still, with a few exceptions, named from the first will occurring in the book, but it had become customary to place in that position the will of either a peer, a knight, or some deceased official of the court. From 1651 to 1840 the names given to the yearly registers were taken arbitrarily from the lists of wills proved during the respective years, such names being usually those of persons distinguished in the State, Church, Army, Navy, Law, etc., but the nomenclature during the latter part of the period in question was derived in large proportion from the surnames of proctors and other officials of the Prerogative Court. It is to be borne in mind that when in process of time the number of wills proved in the year became too large to allow of the transcripts being bound in one volume, the same distinguishing name was applied to the whole of the volumes, few or many, pertaining to the particular year. From 1384 to 1840 inclusive there are 1938 of these bulky volumes; at the extinction of the ecclesiastical courts (Jan. 11, 1858), the number had increased to 2263 ; and at the end of 1888 the total was 2821. These few notes are to a great extent founded upon information collected some time ago by Mr. George H. Rodman, the Record Keeper, and very kindly placed at my disposal. J. C. C. SMITH. * His surname is repeatedly thus spelt in the preamble to this register, though it is usually written \" Cromwell \" and mis-pronounced accordingly. CHRONOLOGICAL ARRANGEMENT. No. of Cal.
