        "text": "Well, I really only know the \"hits\" from Spandau Ballet and ABC. Or at least, their Stateside hits, as I understand that each band had many more in their homeland. So in the case of Spandau Ballet, that's mainly True, and I remember a couple other songs that MTV played, though I couldn't tell you the titles off hand. With ABC, you're talking about Poison Arrow (which I still think is a great song), The Look Of Love, and later on, Be Near Me, When Smokie Sings and Tell Me How To Be A Millionaire (and I saw Mantrap, their weird album length conceptual film, exactly once on MTV).\n\nSo, judging for that admittedly limited selection of songs, I'd reckon that both bands had a more R&B/dance flavor to their music than Roxy Music. Granted, Roxy Music did have their \"dance music\" moments on those last couple albums, even releasing a couple \"extended dance mix\" 12\" singles.\n\nI suspect that both Tony Hadley and Martin Fry may have drawn their stage personas from Bryan Ferry's \"lounge lizard\" thing, though without the irony that Ferry had during the early Roxy Music era (then again, Ferry lost the irony during the late 70's, too). Can also hear a bit of Ferry influence in their actual vocals, too, I think.\n\nre: Japan,\n\nI kinda have a weird history with that band. MTV actually played the Visions Of China, circa 82-83. Maybe not a lot, but they played it often enough that I saw it a few times, and I remember hating it! I guess it was too artsy for my 9-10 year old mind, and I think in particular I didn't like David Sylvian's voice, and I probably didn't like the other idiosyncratic aspects of the band's sound either.\n\nAt some point, John Taylor from Duran Duran (wait for it! wait for it!) did a guest VJ thing on MTV, and he played the VIsions Of China video. I remember they showed the clip, and he came on afterward and talked about how great they were, ending on \"Unfortunately, they've now broken up\", and I remember thinking \"GOOD!\", like ya know, like Grumpy Cat meme or something. lol\n\nSo then a few years later, as I was starting to expand my listening habits, there was an article in Guitar Player about Mick Karn. I was starting to get into fretless bass, and having David Torn quoted in the article made my ears prick up, as I was already a fan of his guitar work. So that was one that I sort of filed away at the time.\n\nBut then I found a couple of Sylvian's solo records at the library, and noted both Torn and Fripp (er, I mean Chuckles) were credited as playing on them. I think one was Secrets Of The Beehive, and I forget what the other was. I remember borrowing them, and kind of liking them, though maybe not enough to really dive in full blown.\n\nThen, Torn and Karn started collaborating on a regular basis, eg the Lonely Universe album, the Polytown project and a couple of Karn's own records. I think that was when I first really heard Karn's playing, and thought \"OK, this is definitely something I need to hear more of\". At the same time, I came to realize that Simon House had guested on Tin Drum. I was a massive Hawkwind fanboy at the time, and anything even remotely connected to them went on the short list, as it were. Oh yeah, and Richard Barbieri fell in with the Porcupine Tree crew, so that upped the interest.\n\nI think I ended up eventually buying Tin Drum and Oil On Canvas and love them both. I finally recently followed through on checking out more of their catalog by ordering Gentlemen Take Polaroids and the Rain Tree Crow album (the Japan reunion record from the mid 90's that wasn't actually billed as Japan, but it had Karn, Sylvian, Jansen and Barbieri's names all on the front cover, so I think it's generally recognized as a Japan record). I ordered them from the UK, so they should be arriving in a couple weeks.\n\nOne more thought: I think it was either the first or second Japan album I found in the used bins at Wax Stax at some point around 93 or 94, around the time I was starting to realize I was probably missing out by not knowing their music. I remember looking at the photo and thinking, \"Gee, they look like Duran Duran on the original cover of their first album\". But of course, it's the other way around: Duran Duran (however briefly) copied their early look from Japan's early look. But I shouldn't have been surprised there, given John Taylor's praise for Japan during his guest VJ spot way back when.\n\nSide note on Japan: on Mick Karn's 1995 album The Tooth Mother, the guest musicians include Gavin Harrison, Jakko Jaksyk, and Steven Wilson. I think I actually bought the album a couple/few years after it originally came out, as the first time I remember hearing of Gavin or Jakko, was when the former joined Porcupine Tree, and the latter came to my attention with the advent of 21st Century Band. GIven my habit of reading musician credits, songwriting bylines, it seems to me I would have recognized those two names when I saw them connected with those subsequent projects. Or maybe this was the one time I didn't really read the musician credits (I knew David Torn played on it, that was all that was important, maybe). (shrug)\n\nBut I find it curious to find out that two guys who later would end up in King Crimson would, a couple decades earlier, had worked with a musician who had with at least a couple other musicians with King Crimson connections of his own (eg Sylvian's work with Chuckles, Torn's work with Levin and Bruford, etc). And Gavin would end up playing with Karn's ex-Japan mate Richard Barbieri in Porcupine Tree, also.\n\nMaybe that means nothing, but it just seems curious in my mind.\n\nHere is the guest-reviewer column that Gary Kemp wrote for the Singles section of the May 1983 issue of Smash Hits. The erudite Spandau guitarist proves knowledgeable in the evolution of American R&B and British rock over the ten-year period leading up to the article.\n\nCommenting on the Sugarhill Gang and Grandmaster Flash, Kemp shares revelatory insights on the influence of the Second British Invasion on stateside urban contemporary, circa 1982–83. He also offers succinct yet comprehensive commentary on everything from Big Country and Paul Young to the Police and Michael Jackson. Even when he discusses something outside his realm of understanding, such as heavy metal, he maintains his objectivity and yields out of deference to the music's audience.\n\nI'm most taken by his comments on Paul Weller's evolution at the time of the article, and second Kemp's notion that the former-Jam frontman's change of environment was a brave and necessary move*. I also agree that Shalamar's Friends LP is one of the finer records of 1982 — it bubbles under on this top 10% list of some 941 albums assimilated from that year.\n\nOverall, Kemp proves much less pop-centric than the fairweathered Spandau fan might imagine.\n\n*What Kemp alludes to is the ill-suitedness of the power-trio format for the musical vision of a composer — in this case, Weller — who had grown to encompass everything from lavish soul and funk to vocal jazz and bossa nova. A comparison between The Gift — the Jam's swansong, on which the band at times sound ill-equipped to accommodate the stylistic scope of Weller's vision — and the subsequent Style Council output could serve to illuminate Kemp's observations."
