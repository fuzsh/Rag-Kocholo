        "text": "Jerry Miller, a guitar great and founding member of the iconic 1960s rock band Moby Grape, has died at 81, Deadline reported.\n\nThe outlet said that Miller died Saturday night, July 20, in Tacoma, Washington. No cause of death has been given.\n\n“Sadly, I have to relate that the great guitarist Jerry Miller passed away last night,” a post in the Moby Grape Facebook fan page reads. “Jo and the family are asking for everyone to please give them some privacy and respect, and Jo asked that people cease phone calls for the time being.”\n\nBorn in 1943 in Tacoma, Washington, Miller was one of the most influential musicians of the San Francisco scene in the 1960s, Ultimate Classic Rock reported.\n\nHe formed Moby Grape with Don Stevenson in 1966 and co-wrote three of the band’s best known songs, “Hey Grandma,” “8.05″ and “Murder In My Heart for The Judge.”\n\nMoby Grape built a reputation with their unique sound, blending elements of psychedelic rock, progressive, country and pop with three guitarists and five members all contributing songwriting and vocals.\n\nThe band’s self-titled debut was named one of the 500 greatest albums of all time by Rolling Stone in 2003.\n\nThe group broke up in 1970 but members continued to occasionally perform and record music together.\n\nMiller later performed as a solo artist, as the leader of the Jerry Miller Band, and in The Rhythm Dukes.\n\nMiller also played guitar on an early version of “I Fought the Law” by The Bobby Fuller Four and later toured with Bobby Fuller.\n\nThe song was named one of the 500 “Songs that Shaped Rock” by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and became a punk rock classic when it was covered by The Clash in the ‘70s.\n\nHe was a friend of Jimi Hendrix in the ‘60s, performed with fellow greats like B.B. King, The Doors and Eric Clapton, who once called him “best guitar player in the world,” according to Deadline.\n\nMiller was also named one of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time by Rolling Stone."
