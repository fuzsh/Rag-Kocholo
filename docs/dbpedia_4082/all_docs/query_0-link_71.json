        "text": "The LP comes with an insert featuring rare photos and detailed liner notes, and a download for the full album plus bonus material.\n\nHere's an LP of awesome, previously unreleased recordings of a very loud power trio from San Francisco, modeled after Cream, Blue Cheer and The Jimi Hendrix Experience. Included are a fantastic studio demo from 1968 plus raw and wild live tracks from 1969. Comrades of Moby Grape and The Sons Of Champlin, this power-trio was formed by Barry \"The Bee\" Bastian (Canned Heat, Lee Michaels...) on guitar and vocals, John Barrett (The Rhythm Dukes) on bass and Fuzzy John Oxendine (Roky Erickson & The Aliens, Jerry Miller Band...) on drums."
