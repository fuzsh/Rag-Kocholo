        "text": "...and apparently the Nature Intended album has fetched up to $900. I'll give the benefit of a doubt and assume that these prices were getting fetched before the truth came out, but given the oddities of collectors, who knows? Anyway, it's funny that copies of the original recordings on these \"Steve Drake\" albums could probably be had for $20 total or so.\n\nTrue, a fake band only does material from said group.\n\nT Rextasy has released their own material.\n\nDarryl\n\nI went to an all-day rock show in Urbana, Illinois around 1969, or so. Moby Grape was advertised as one of the groups. It wasn't the Grape, but it turned out to be the Rhythm Dukes, a Grape side project with Jerry Miller, and a rhythm section. They were really good ( Jerry Miller is a MONSTER guitarist), but we wanted Miller with Don Stevenson, Peter Lewis, and Mosley. I guess Mosley was in the Marines by then, but we didn't know that........\n\nI saw a version of Spirit ca. 1973-74 that had Ed Cassidy as its only original member. All the other guys were ringers. That comes pretty close in my mind to this thread's premise.\n\nSomething similar was done after \"Crazy Elephant\" scored a hit with \"Gimme Gimme Good Lovin'.\" The record was strictly a studio concoction and featured a lead vocal from a black guy who was once a member of The Cadillacs. The touring group, and the one pictured on the album that ultimately came out, featured five white guys.\n\ncan see miller for free whenever i want down the road like 25 miles at this roadhouse biker bar tuesday nights, still sounds absolutely fantastic, they focus on the blues, hes an amazing blues guitarist\n\nThat is a conversation I would have liked to have been a witness to.\n\nWouldn't it have been great if him and the real Animals had shown up and demanded to perform and get paid, putting pressure on the venue with threats of legal action.\n\nIf Longo came here, he would be killed.\n\nChester County Pa. is \"Bill Haley country\" where Haley lived and set up base since the 40's until the early 1960s.\n\nThe real group is led by Al Rappa was Haley's bassist since 1956.\n\nhttp://www.billhaleyscomets.com/\n\nBTW, the fake Little River Band's new CD is out and this is the first single, You Dream, I'll Drive:\n\nThe CD is Cuts Like a Diamond.\n\nJust my personal opinion:the \"fake\"sonny boy was older and much better than the \"original\".\n\nThere was a guy in the La Crescenta-Montrose area of Los Angeles (close to me) that passed himself off as Dan Cafferty of Nazareth!\n\nI saw the guy and knew it was NOT!\n\nStill- at least it's rather creative as most people don't know the names of the guys in Nazareth, so why not, right?"
