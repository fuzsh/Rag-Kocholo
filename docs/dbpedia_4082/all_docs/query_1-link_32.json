This guy could play some blues as well as rock. He's still playing around Washington State and the west coast. I did see he had some adversity with the floods on December.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAUGyED5vH0\n\nOne of my all time favorite guitarists. He performed for a while with Bill Champlin as \"The Rhythm Dukes\" back in the late '60's. That was a great little band! Around '77 he had a band called \"The Original Haze\" with Michael Been, later of \"The Call.\" I saw them one night and he noticed I was checking out his playing. Some guitarists seeing that would turn away from you. Jerry came over closer to where I was standing so I could see better. I love the sound of a big Gibson jazz box played through a cranked amp. Terry Haggerty of The Sons of Champlin was great in that respect, too."
