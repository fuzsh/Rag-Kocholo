        "text": "“Weepin'” Willie Robinson, a blues singer who performed with the likes of Steven Tyler and Bonnie Raitt but also spent time homeless, has died at age 81. Mr. Robinson had been a sharecropper, an Army veteran and a friend of performers, including B.B. King. “He was truly the elder statesman of the (Boston) blues. He was our godfather. He was the most dear man,” Holly Harris, host of “Blues on Sunday” on WBOS radio, told The Boston Globe for Monday’s editions. When he sang, “you knew he meant it because he had passion,” Harris said. Robinson died Sunday in a fire started by a cigarette he was smoking in bed, the Boston Fire Department said. He had worked a benefit concert with Tyler and two Boston Music Awards shows, in 2005 and again earlier this month. Robinson was born in Atlanta and picked cotton and fruit with his family up and down the East Coast. After spending time in the Army in the 1940s, he became a master of ceremonies and doorman at blues clubs in Trenton, N.J., where he met King and other legends and eventually sang with King’s 21-piece orchestra. His daughter, Lorraine Robinson, told the Globe her father found his place on stage. “A great smile would come on his face and he would be in his own little world, like he’d tune everything out,” she said. “He just, like, felt the music. It was so much in his soul.” Robinson settled in Boston in 1959 and played in clubs, but by 2005 he was living on the street and out of touch with his family. Blues performers learned of his situation, held a benefit concert and made sure he was fed and clothed. Robinson later performed everywhere from local clubs to the hallways of the rest home where he lived.\n\nwell almost. 4 hours and I still didn’t get a chance to play ALL the albums that I wanted to ….So, to those who I left out…my apologies….but man, there was some good music made in 2007.

You will be able to not only hear but feel the spirit voices and pulsing percussion instruments of Africa and the Americas fuse with Sosa’s lyrical and adventurous piano stylings. I want to be sure to thank my friends over at Ota Records for making certain I get to share this album with you.\n\nOmar Sosa-Afreecanos-Ota Records-2008\n\nOscar Peterson, whose early talent and speedy fingers made him one of the world’s best known jazz pianists, died at age 82. During an illustrious career spanning seven decades, Peterson played with some of the biggest names in jazz, including Ella Fitzgerald, Count Basie and Dizzy Gillespie. He is also remembered for touring in a trio with Ray Brown on bass and Herb Ellis on guitar in the 1950s. Peterson’s impressive collection of awards include all of Canada’s highest honors, such as the Order of Canada, as well as a Lifetime Grammy (1997) and a spot in the International Jazz Hall of Fame. His growing stature was reflected in the admiration of his peers. Duke Ellington referred to him as “Maharajah of the keyboard,” while Count Basie once said “Oscar Peterson plays the best ivory box I’ve ever heard.” He was also influenced by Nat King Cole, whose Nat King Cole Trio album he considered “a complete musical thesaurus for any aspiring Jazz pianist.” In 2005 he became the first living person other than a reigning monarch to obtain a commemorative stamp in Canada, where he is jazz royalty, with streets, squares, concert halls and schools named after him. A jazz player is an instant composer,” Peterson once said in a Canadian Broadcasting Corp. interview, while conceding jazz did not have the mass appeal of other musical genres. “You have to think about it, it’s an intellectual form,” he said…..and maybe today for a moment, think about the life of Mr. Oscar Peterson.\n\nI first want to make sure I give “props” to one of the major influences in my “World Music” know-how….please check out my good friend and brother Richard over at one world radio, he is the man with the global vibe and shed a little of that light my way over many years….without his input and output, I would never attempt such a show.\n\nGrassfire- John Trudell\n\nRock el Casbah- Rachid Taha\n\nTeknochek Collision- Slavic Soul Party\n\nEverybody Loves you- Hazmat Modine\n\nWin my Train Fare Home- Robert Plant (live in the desert)\n\nAfours Afours- Tinariwen\n\nChatma- Tinariwen\n\n—————————————————————————-\n\nNo Alternative- Saritah\n\nFly Away- Sara Wasserman/Aaron Neville\n\n—————————————————————————-\n\nJingo- Manu DiBango w/King Sunny Ade\n\nCrathadh t Aodaich and Zbadba- Mouth Music\n\nSpirit of the Forest- Baka Beyond\n\nTi Citron- 3 Mustaphas 3\n\nCuban Connection- Outback\n\n—————————————————————————–\n\nDon’t Look Back- Peter Tosh/Mick Jagger\n\nGirlwatcher- Yellowman (live in S.F.)\n\nI gotta Woman- Toots & the Maytals\n\nHey Brotha- Zap Mama w/Michael Franti\n\nI feel awake even tho this is a Dream-Suphala/Edie Brickell\n\nNivedan- Anoushka Shankar (live)\n\nPalmistry- Tabla Beat Science\n\n——————————————————————————-\n\nA Love Supreme- Carlos Santana\n\nA Love Supreme- Rufus Harley\n\nThe Invergarry Blues- Peatbog Faeries\n\nColonel Fraser- Jerry O’ Sullivan\n\n——————————————————————————–\n\nCourage- Vieux Farka Toure\n\nConnection-Sean Noonan Brewed by Noon\n\nBara- Tonight’s African Band\n\nDevil Woman- Toubab Krewe\n\nTibidi Waka- Vusi Mahlasela w/ Derek Trucks\n\nTshungane- ABAJI\n\nPirates- Super Rail Band de Bamako\n\nDee Moo Woor- Orchestra Baobab\n\n———————————————————————————\n\nDos Caminos- Omar Sosa (live)\n\nUna broma seria- Habana Abierta\n\nChe Che Cole Makossa- Antibalas\n\nYanbando- Juan Carlos Formell & Son Radical\n\nLeonel el Feo- Melingo with Florencia Bonadeo\n\nLip Smacker- Poncho Sanchez\n\n———————————————————————————-\n\nBalkan Trilogy- Terrafolk\n\n3rd Stream- Jake Shimabukuro\n\nT Boli- Dr. Didg\n\nKaluli Groove- Global Drum Project\n\nThe Hop- Radio Citizen w/Bajka\n\n———————————————————————————-\n\nParaiba- Forro in the Dark w/Miho Hatori\n\nKiyakiya- Babatunde Olatunji\n\nIncaldido- Bonga\n\nHende Baba- Thomas Mapfumo\n\nHearts Desire Dub- Eccodek\n\nLovelife- the Mighty Underdogs feat.

Reynolds Tobacco, Rolling Stone, and the magazine’s parent company, Wenner Media, according to a Daily Swarm report. The suit– filed on December 17 on behalf of 186 artists whose names appeared in Rolling Stone’s “Indie Rock Universe” feature, tucked conspicuously within a fold-out advertisement for Camel’s indie-friendly “The Farm” campaign in the magazine’s November 15 issue– accuses the defending parties of “unauthorized use of artists’ names; unauthorized use of artist names for commercial advantage (right of publicity); and unfair business practices.“. Yeah, I mean how can something like that be overlooked when so many people have such an eager eye to scrutinize? Xiu Xiu and Fucked Up essentially claim that Rolling Stone created and presented their feature with full knowledge that it would appear part and parcel with the Camel ad. The plaintiffs ask that the magazine print a follow-up feature equal in size to the original clarifying that artists’ names were used without consent. They’re also seeking financial recompense for damages. While this marks the first time Rolling Stone has found itself the subject of legal action following the ad scandal, nine states’ Attorneys General have already filed lawsuits against Camel for using cartoons to sell tobacco products. So, it is just get away with as much as possible until someone catches you up, you get all kinds of publicity and a chance to make amends…it’s all a game…but you knew that.\n\n-you’re just a player in the game to the industries.\n\nMost likely I am going with a TOP 20 something this year. But this is one of the great releases of 2007 for sure.\n\nGOIN’ HOME: A Tribute to Fats Domino\n\nIcons from the world of rock, blues, reggae, pop and country music have joined together to salute the genius of legendary piano man FATS DOMINO. This stellar tribute to one of the cornerstones of rock n’ roll music will help raise desperately needed funds specifically earmarked for instruments to be donated to New Orleans’ public school children. Monies raised from the sales of Goin’ Home will also go toward Domino’s neighborhood by creating a community center in the Crescent City’s still ravaged Lower 9th Ward. Proceeds of Goin’ Home will fund additional community related programs. The Tipitina’s Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation dedicated to preserving the cultural legacy of New Orleans through music education for the youth and providing programs that support working musicians of New Orleans and the Gulf Region, conceived and executive produced Goin’ Home. With so many great artists and people being a part of this album, I thought I’d dangle the set-lists in front of you to make your mouth and thirsty ear-holes water some more…\n\nDisc 1:\n\n1.

He grew up in Denver, Colorado, where his parents owned a record store (Record Center). Through his parents, and by spending time at the local blues bar Ebbett’s Field, he met Lightnin’ Hopkins. Mr. Hopkins was impressed with his drum playing and took him on tour, where Weiss had the opportunity to play with Muddy Waters, Howlin’ Wolf, Roger Miller, Dr. John, and other great musicians. Weiss released “Extremely Cool” in 1999, featuring extensive collaboration with Tom Waits, who co-produced the album for his longtime acquaintance (they met in 1972 at Ebbett’s Field, where Weiss played in the house band) and appears on at least two tracks. The style is heavily reminiscent of Waits, both in composition and vocal approach. Either could have influenced the other. “Old Souls and Wolf Tickets” was released in early 2002, perhaps less reminiscent of Tom Waits and more redolent of Delta blues acts decades older. Weiss’s music includes strains of every rhythmic style from nursery rhymes to zydeco. Weiss was the subject of Rickie Lee Jones’s hit “Chuck E.’s in Love” from her 1979 debut album, in which she claims “Chuck E.” is in love with “the little girl who’s singing this song” (Jones says the song was fictional). At the time Jones was linked romantically to Tom Waits. All three lived at the time at the Tropicana Hotel in Los Angeles, in the middle of a fertile musical scene including Jackson Browne, the Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, Warren Zevon, and the one and only Mister Frank Zappa and others. Weiss has also played with legendary bassist Willie Dixon, who was quoted on the original packaging of “Extremely Cool” (“Ain’t ya got ears son? That little Jew boy with the big old head be one of the best musicians in this town, this country even.”) “Down the Road a Piece,” from “Old Souls & Wolf Tickets,” is a 1970 recording of the two playing together. Chuck E. Weiss has been associated with Los Angeles and Southern California for years, saying he does not like to travel by airplane. Weiss played 11 years of Mondays at a club called the Central before it fell on hard times. Weiss and his friend Johnny Depp (who executive produced the first track on “Extremely Cool”) were instrumental in resuscitating it as the Viper Room, which became immediately trendy when River Phoenix died there in 1993. “Extremely Cool” makes reference to Canter’s Kibitz Room, a small nightclub in a larger diner in Los Angeles’s Fairfax District, where Weiss has also played habitually. His regular band is called The G-d Damn Liars.\n\nA Billboard bullet, “Rocket 88”, was penned by a 19-year old boogie-woogie boy and his back-up band, “The Kings of Rhythm”, for their first Sun Studios session in March 1951. B.B. King introduced the kid to Sam Phillips, but he did not have a song – yet. So, on that rainy ride up Highway 61 to Memphis with their gear strapped on top, inspiration and lightening struck. The first muscle car – a highway cruiser – the hot, new, Oldsmobile “Rocket 88” was the subject and title of that historic #1 Hit. His lead vocalist, Jackie Brensten, and his side band, “The Delta Cats”, were mistakenly credited with the song by Chess Records, who released it. But those that know Rock history know The Kings of Rhythm were the real rockers toiling in the shadows of their own success. That kid is referred to by Little Richard as “The Man”. B.B. King proudly echoes, “Heâ€™s the best band leader Iâ€˜ve ever seen.” The kid who became “The Man” is Ike Turner. He won a Grammy in 2007 in the traditional blues album category for “Risin’ With the Blues.” Which in my opinion is a well deserved rock and roll blues album. Ike Turner passed away today at his home in suburban San Diego. He was 76.\n\nThe High Noon Saloon was the spot for the Holidaze in Hicksville as Mr. Dan Hicks and the Hot Licks graced our Madison grounds with a true treat, as a matter of fact, this one goes down as a classic. Not only was it the season for holiday cheer as only Dan Hicks can share (I believe the one phrase in the show was lets get these Christmas songs out of the way, hey hey) , but it was also Mr. Hicks’ birthday. There was even a cake. Oh yeah there was a show. As expected except better, the show seemed to be more than a show, an experience. Folk swing is somewhat the style of the music, but man…..there was some kicked up blues riffs, so finely timed dance steps and a barrel, check that, a building filled with a humor so sincere to this night that you couldn’t go home without feeling connected. There were plenty of old classics to rejoice in….from I Scare Myself (which really blew the top off the place)and the nights closer of How can I Miss You When You Won’t go Away, but for me the stopper was the rendition of the Tom Waits song The Piano Has Been Drinking. While this show can be compared to others in the long and brilliant career of Dan Hicks, there was so many thrilled audience members that I would have sworn this was there first time witnessing the event that is Dan Hicks and the Hot Licks. I also noticed that while the room was filled up nicely, there was plenty of room for some younger ears, I really think that this music and the way it is presented to a crowd is something for the younger crowds to share in. Madison’s own Harmonious Wail and their Gypsy Swing music opened the show and was all that I have heard people say and more. Be sure to check them out also.\n\nListen to my first conversation with Dan here.\n\nListen to my second conversation with Dan here.\n\nMr. Dan Hicks and MisterG 12/09/07\n\nTherapy- Winzenried\n\nDreamin’- G Love & the Special Sauce\n\nSmoke 2 Joints- Sublime\n\nLove my Guitar- Prince\n\nJuJu in Those Strings- Eccodek\n\nBaby Elephants-n-Thangs- Baby Elephants w/George Clinton\n\nThe Craft- Blackalicious\n\n——————————————————————————\n\nLove and Happiness- Marc Broussard\n\nShoes- George Soule\n\n——————————————————————————\n\nWho Cares What the Question is- Band of Bees\n\nSanctified- Mama’s Cookin’\n\nAngelina- the Tony Tyler Trance\n\nWar- JJ Grey & Mofro\n\nBroken Down Piece of Junk- Brian Setzer\n\nLittle White Lines- Shooter Jennings\n\nAre You- Bob Seger\n\nThe Fat Man- Los Lobos\n\nIt’s All Over Now- Dirty Dozen Brass Band w/Dr. John\n\n—————————————————————————\n\nDebbie’s Dance- Skeebo Knight\n\nGet Down Tonite- Melvin Sparks\n\nThank You Nation 1814- Janet Jackson/DJ Reset\n\nOne Love Let’s Celebrate- Perry Farrell’s Satellite Party\n\n—————————————————————————-\n\nSolid- Soulive\n\nMiami Blues- Akashic Record\n\nFellin’ Good- Bama and the Family\n\n—————————————————————————–\n\nSun in Your Head- Dust Galaxy\n\nFading in C# Minor- Una\n\nCinnamon Girl- Matthew Sweet/Susanna Hoffs\n\nMy AK-47- Hot Tuna (live)\n\nRebecca, Rebecca- Mojo:Saint (live)\n\nCaress Me Baby- Omar Kent Dykes/Jimmie Vaughn/COTTON\n\nTell me Something I Don’t Know- Geoff Achison & the Souldiggers (live)\n\nSuits me Fine- King Johnson\n\n——————————————————————————–\n\nLost and Found- Al & the Transamericans\n\nTailspin- Moe\n\nSoulshine- Gov’t Mule (live)\n\nFallujah Dub- Guvna Dub\n\n——————————————————————————–\n\nthe Good, the Bad, the Ugly- the Dillingers\n\nHOPE THIS FIT…..your needs.\n\nOne of the most electrifying shows I have seen in a long time. Youssou N’Dour et le Super Etoile de Dakar brought West Africa, heck all cultures present together for an unforgettable night of dance, positive rhythms and shared spirit at the Wisconsin Union Theater. This was a few hours of community led by a powerful sermon by one of the most powerful voices on any continent. Carrying his storytelling and roots of Senegalese music, Youssou N’Dour does create a sound that is a force strong enough to combine all into one. The Griot Percussion mixed with Afro-Cuban arrangements is a sound that can flourish in any land, there is nostalgia in those songs and even I, who knows only a slight peek into the French dialect can feel it. It is a celebration."
