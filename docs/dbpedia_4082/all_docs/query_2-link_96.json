        "text": "Today is Saturday, July 15, the 196th day of 2017. There are 169 days left in the year.\n\nToday's Highlight in History:\n\nOn July 15, 1997, fashion designer Gianni Versace (ver-SAH'-chay), 50, was shot dead outside his Miami Beach home; suspected gunman Andrew Phillip Cunanan, 27, was found dead eight days later, a suicide. (Investigators believed Cunanan killed four other victims before Versace in a cross-country spree that began the previous March.)\n\nOn this date:\n\nIn 1799, French soldiers in Egypt discovered the Rosetta Stone, which proved instrumental in deciphering ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs.\n\nIn 1870, Georgia became the last Confederate state to be readmitted to the Union.
