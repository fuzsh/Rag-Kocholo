        "text": "Jerry Miller died Saturday night in Tacoma, Washington, at age 81. No cause has been given.\n\nâSadly, Jerry Miller passed away last night,â said the fan page post. âJo and the family are asking for everyone to please give them some privacy and respect, and Jo asked that people cease phone calls for the time being. Thank you.â\n\nHis death was reported on the Moby Grape Facebook fan page and by journalist Eric Brenner.\n\nEric Clapton reportedly once called him âthe greatest guitar player in the world,â and while Rolling Stone didnât hold him in quite as high regard, it still once ranked him among the greatest 100 all-time.\n\nHis career began in the late 1950s, playing and recording with popular Northwest dance-rock bands. He contributed guitar work to an early version of the hit record I Fought the Law by The Bobby Fuller Four, and later toured with Fuller.\n\nMiller was a contemporary of Jimi Hendrix and Larry Coryell, and they would often get together to watch touring bands visiting the Seattle area.\n\nDeadline reported that he toured with Bobby Fuller of âI Fought the Law,â fame and even did some âearly guitar workâ on that hit.\n\nMoby Grape was formed in San Francisco in 1966 with Miller was the lead guitarist in the three-guitar band. After leaving Moby Grape, Miller helped form The Rhythm Dukes and also performed as a solo artist."
