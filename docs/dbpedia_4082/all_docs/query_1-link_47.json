        "text": "Jerry Miller died Saturday night in Tacoma, Washington, at age 81. No cause has been given.\n\n“Sadly, Jerry Miller passed away last night,” said the fan page post. “Jo and the family are asking for everyone to please give them some privacy and respect, and Jo asked that people cease phone calls for the time being. Thank you.”\n\nHis death was reported on the Moby Grape Facebook fan page and by journalist Eric Brenner.\n\nEric Clapton reportedly once called him “the greatest guitar player in the world,” and while Rolling Stone didn’t hold him in quite as high regard, it still once ranked him among the greatest 100 all-time.\n\nHis career began in the late 1950s, playing and recording with popular Northwest dance-rock bands. He contributed guitar work to an early version of the hit record I Fought the Law by The Bobby Fuller Four, and later toured with Fuller.\n\nMiller was a contemporary of Jimi Hendrix and Larry Coryell, and they would often get together to watch touring bands visiting the Seattle area.\n\nDeadline reported that he toured with Bobby Fuller of “I Fought the Law,” fame and even did some “early guitar work” on that hit.\n\nMoby Grape was formed in San Francisco in 1966 with Miller was the lead guitarist in the three-guitar band. After leaving Moby Grape, Miller helped form The Rhythm Dukes and also performed as a solo artist."
