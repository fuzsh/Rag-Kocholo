        "text": "In the wake of World War II, America's political, economic and cultural influence loomed large over Europe. Jazz music, which U.S. GIs had helped spread throughout the continent, was enormously popular. After years of unimaginable suffering, death, and destruction, young people in particular were drawn to the spontaneity and freedom of jazz.\n\nGerry Teekins in 2005\n\nOne of the many European youths who became enamored with jazz was a 12-year-old Dutch boy by the name of Gerry Teekens. In an interview published in 2005, Teekens recalled how in the late 1940s in The Netherlands \"Jazz was very popular, even the girls in the street knew (big band leader Stan) Kenton and (saxophone player Lee) Konitz. We had jazz bands for all the school festivities, so I started getting interested in the music and started buying 78s by the Dutch Swing College Band, Bob Crosby, Harry James, Meade Lux Lewis, and then LPs by Erroll Garner, J.A.T.P., (Oscar) Peterson, Blakey, Miles, Trane, Ornette, and all those records on Savoy, Prestige, Blue Note, Impulse, and Riverside.\"\n\nBy the time he finished high school and college in the late 50s, Teekens had become a jazz drummer and spent much of the 1960s gigging around Europe. However, he finally got married, settled down, and accepted a teaching position, giving up his music career. But he never lost his love for jazz and remained connected to the jazz scene in his native Holland. In the late 1970s, Teekens began doing some promotion work, booking jazz bands to play at his school and using his contacts to help organize concerts and tours for American musicians coming to the Netherlands and Europe. He says: \"I brought in guys like Jimmy Raney and his son Doug Raney, Warne Marsh, Lee Konitz, Lou Levy, Teddy Edwards, and Allan Eager. I also organized concerts with Dexter Gordon and Johnny Griffin, Tete Montoliu with Albert Heath, Barney Wilen, and Peter Ind (Lee Tristano's bassist) plus his group.\"\n\nCriss Cross Jazz 1001\n\nTeekens organized tours for guitar great Jimmy Raney in 1976 and 1977, and the two developed a good relationship. In early 1981, Teekens put together a five-week concert tour in the Netherlands. Accompanying Raney were his son, Doug, (a fine guitarist in his own right), Dutch drummer Eric Ineke, and Danish bassist Jesper Lundgaard. The band had great chemistry, and the tour was a big success, playing to sold-out audiences around the country.\n\nHoping to capture the excellent vibe from the concert tour, Teekens and Raney decided to take the group into a studio to record an album before Raney headed back to the U.S. The resulting album, Raney '81 (right), became the first ever release for Teekens' new label, Criss Cross Jazz. Teekens says he chose the name Criss Cross because it described how jazz and jazz musicians traveled back and forth between the US and Europe - crisscrossing the Atlantic. (And maybe a shout-out to the Thelonious Monk album of the same name?) Over a period of nearly 40 years, until his death in 2019, Teekens would produce and release more than 400 albums on Criss Cross.\n\nIn the early years of the label, Teekens focused on recording jazz musicians who were touring in Holland or Europe. For example, in August of 1982, with the North Sea Jazz Festival taking place in the Dutch capital of The Hague, Teekens recruited tenor saxophonist Warne Marsh and the Hank Jones Trio to record a session together.\n\nSince Marsh's group and Jones's trio were appearing every night at different venues during the festival, Teekens had to find a studio near the city where he could record during the day and still get the musicians to their gigs in the evening. As luck would have it, he had recently met an optometrist and part-time drummer named Max Bolleman, who had a small home recording studio just outside of the city who was looking for clients. [Hang on. An optometrist with a Dutch name who records jazz music in his home studio. Sounds vaguely familiar, no? Rudy? Rudy Van something?]\n\nIn his recently-published autobiography, called Sounds (photo below), Bolleman recalls that Teekens called him on Thursday and asked if he could do a recording session on Saturday at noon. Bolleman says he agreed, but forgot to ask who would be coming. He called back and was floored (and not a little nervous) to learn that one of his first real recording dates would be with an all-star group made up of Warne Marsh, Hank Jones, Mel Lewis, and George Mraz. Despite the fact that Marsh had never played with any of the other musicians before, Bolleman says they laid down 10 tracks in about five hours before Teekens bundled everyone out the door. The resulting album, Star Highs (the second release on Criss Cross Jazz, below), was picked by Downbeat magazine as one of the top jazz albums of the year.\n\nCriss Cross Jazz 1002\n\nAfter a few years, Teekens got tired of trying to line up visiting musicians for recording sessions and began to make biannual trips to the US where it was much easier to book players for gigs. For several years, he hired the other Dutch optometrist recording engineer, Rudy Van Gelder, to record his sessions at his New Jersey studio. Working on a tight schedule, Teekens was able to churn out an album a day for six or eight days straight and generate enough material to provide a year's worth of releases for Criss Cross. In the late 1980s, in order to save money, Teekens (who operated Criss Cross on a shoestring budget) began booking studio time in New York City and bringing along his buddy Bolleman to engineer the sessions.\n\nSaxophonist Sam Newsome recorded his first date with Teekens in 1989. He recalls how \"Teekens used to stroll into town during the Christmas holiday with a sack full of record contracts in tow. He’d stay at a two-star hotel in Union Square, book a studio for two weeks and commence to make a record per day, along with his partner in crime, recording engineer and drummer Max Bolleman.\" According to Newsome, Teekens paid the leaders on his dates $1,000, with $500 apiece for the sidemen. (Which, Newsome adds, wasn't a bad rate for a day's work.)\n\nWhile Teekens featured many top tier jazz players on his label, including the likes of Chet Baker, Clifford Jordon, Milt Jackson, and Johnny Coles, he also is credited with giving many young players their first break. David Adler, in a 2003 article about Teekens in All About Jazz, notes that \"Most of Criss Cross' artists are American and relatively young, and Teekens' approach to recruiting them couldn't be simpler: 'If I hear someone I like,\" he says, \"I record them, regardless of whether they'll sell.' His track record is remarkable: Kenny Garrett, Steve Wilson, Benny Green, Bill Charlap, Chris Potter, Mark Turner, Kurt Rosenwinkel, Orrin Evans, and Seamus Blake are among those who made either their debuts or their earliest recordings for Criss Cross.\"\n\nPerhaps because he grew up listening to the classic bebop of the 50s, Teekens liked straight-ahead jazz, nothing experimental or avant garde. Beyond that, his only rule was that the music had to \"swing.\" As a result, most Criss Cross releases (especially the early ones) have a kind of house sound -- fluid, no-nonsense bebop with lots of standards. If you like one title, chances are you'll like them all.\n\nCriss Cross Records\n\nWhen I first began to collect Criss Cross LPs, I was struck not only by the fine playing by a lot of cats I had never heard of, but also by the fabulous sound quality. Sam Newsome says that all of the early albums were recorded live direct to two-track, which accounts for the natural, spontaneous feel of the sessions. Of course, having Rudy Van Gelder or Max Bolleman at the controls certainly didn't hurt either. Unfortunately, only the first 39 titles in the Criss Cross catalog (the releases from 1981-1989)were issued on vinyl. After 1989, Criss Cross releases are CD only. The LPs, by the way, were all pressed in Holland or Germany, and the quality is outstanding. Every disk I have is flat and quiet. [12/2022 update: Since I wrote this blog post, Criss Cross has teamed up with Elemental Music to release two more LPs: Brad Mehldau's 2000 album Consenting Adults (2021), and Melvin Rhyne's 1994 release Boss Organ (2022).]\n\nOver the last year or so, I've been on a mission to collect all 39 Criss Cross LPs. To date, I have 30. I was lucky enough to score more than half of them from a dealer who had a stash of mint \"new old stock.\" Most of the LPs are available and not too expensive, though some of the ones I'm still missing are proving hard to find in good condition. If all else fails (and once we're allowed to travel again), it would make a great excuse to plan a trip to Holland to see if I can track down the remaining titles. In the meantime, if you run across any Criss Cross titles, don't hesitate to give them a try even if you've never heard of the musicians. Teekens had excellent taste.\n\nMax Bolleman (who recently retired), went on to become one of the most in-demand recording engineers in Europe and worked on lots of great albums -- in addition to the many sides he did with Teekens for Criss Cross Jazz. His book (left) is filled with great stories of his years in the studio recording the famous and not so famous. It includes a priceless tale about the time Rudy Van Gelder threw him out of his Englewood Cliffs, NJ studio because he thought Bolleman was trying to steal information about his recording techniques and mic placements (he was).\n\nFinally, I'm happy to note that Criss Cross Jazz is alive and well and is now being run by Teekens' son, Gerry Jr. Next year (2021) will mark their 40th anniversary as a label. You can check out their excellent website and the more than 400 releases in the Criss Cross catalog here.\n\nEnjoy the music!\n\nHow do we feel about Ramsey Lewis?\n\nI ask because a few weeks ago I picked up a nice used copy of the 1966 release Swingin' by the Ramsey Lewis Trio. It's an intriguing combination of cool jazz, blues, and classical, played with panache and youthful exuberance. It sounds more than a little like early stuff by The Modern Jazz Quartet or The Chico Hamilton Group. The eclectic mix of tracks on the album includes \"My Funny Valentine,\" the Habanero aria from the opera Carmen, the Yiddish classic \"Bie Mir Bist Du Schoen,\" Gerry Mulligan's \"Limelight,\" as well as three originals by Lewis and Young.\n\nBut hold the phone. By 1966, Ramsey Lewis was well into his contemporary jazz pop phase and was no longer playing straight ahead jazz. So what the heck is going on?\n\nI'm glad you asked. I have about 30 albums by Ramsey Lewis. When I found Swingin', I was pretty sure I didn't have a copy. I certainly didn't recall the photo on the front of the jacket. As it turns out (and I would have realized this if I had read the liner notes) Swingin' is a 1966 reissue of the trio's 1956 debut album called Gentle-Men Of Swing (right). In addition to Ramsey on piano, the original trio featured Isaac \"Red\" Holt on drums and Eldee Young on bass. It was an auspicious debut that announced to the jazz world that these three young guys from Chicago had a fresh sound and, more importantly, something worthwhile to say.\n\nAnd they said it a lot, releasing 20 albums by the end of 1965, including three each in 1960, 1961, 1962, and 1963. Many are noteworthy for the unusual, wide-ranging choice of songs. The group liberally mixed together folk melodies, gospel songs, nursery rhymes, soundtracks, current Broadway and pop hits, Bossa Nova, soul, and even some country western.\n\nThe trio's style was generally mainstream, with some cool poly-rhythmical bass and drums. The majority of the tracks clock in at only three to four minutes; there isn't much stretching out on these early albums. But even if nothing like a hot jam session ever threatened to break out, Lewis and his band mates were clearly talented jazz musicians who could swing. They competed for record sales with piano trios like Oscar Peterson and (fellow Chicagoan and ARGO label-mate) Ahmad Jamal. In short, their jazz bona fides were solid.\n\nAfter a decade together, the group had a loyal fan base and steady albums sales. They were a popular fixture at Chicago clubs and also toured and played at venues like Birdland and the Village Vanguard in New York. But their big commercial break came with their 17nd (!) album, the 1965 release called The In Crowd. The record was recorded live during a three-night stand at the Bohemian Cavern club in Washington, D.C. The instrumental version of the title track (which had been a big hit for singer Dobie Gray earlier in 1965) made it to number five on the Hot 200 Chart, and all the way to number two on the R&B chart. The album won a Grammy for Best Instrumental Jazz Performance. And more importantly, the light jazz treatment of current pop hits that made The In Crowd such a hit proved to be the winning formula to propel Ramsey Lewis to a string of chart-topping albums and a massive new audience. As Lewis noted in an interview years later: \"All of a sudden this huge hit was on the chart, and we were up there in the Top Five with Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Barbra Streisand . . . So of course our money just sky-rocketed. And suddenly we were making five to ten times more than we had been. So I guess, while it did take time to get used to that, those are certainly days that I'll always remember.\"\n\nFrom bottom: Ramsey Lewis, Eldee Young, and Red Holt\n\nAlas, as is often the case, the trio didn't survive their sudden celebrity and the huge infusion of cash that followed. In an interview with Down Beat magazine, Lewis mentions growing artistic differences as a reason for the breakup and says: \"We weren't relating to each other musically.\" Which may very well be true. But apparently another factor was that Young and Holt were unhappy that Lewis was getting most of the attention that accompanied the group's new-found fame. As a result, the trio broke up before they could record a follow-up to their hit album. Young and Holt left to form their own group, The Young-Holt Trio, which was renamed Young-Holt Limited after about a year. They put out some 10 albums of R&B and soul jazz, and had one top five hit with the catchy \"Soulful Strut.\" Lewis, meanwhile, quickly rebuilt his trio with veteran musician Cleveland Eaton on bass and session man Maurice White on drums. [Years later, White would go on to become a founding member of the group Earth, Wind, And Fire.]\n\nLewis and his label wasted no time getting the new trio into the studio to take advantage of the chart-topping success of The In Crowd. The newly-formed group released five albums in the next two years, and a total of 10 albums before the end of the decade. It is worth noting that following The In Crowd, Lewis no longer billed his group as the Ramsey Lewis Trio. From now on, it was just Ramsey Lewis.\n\nIn retrospect, I feel certain that Swingin' -- the album I picked up recently -- was reissued by the label in 1966 to cash in on the popularity of The In Crowd. No doubt they were counting on the fact that lots of new fans wouldn't notice that Swingin' was a reissue of the group's first album. However, I have to assume that most fans of The In Crowd were disappointed if they expected Swingin' to be a follow-up album.\n\n1975's Sun Goddess\n\nBack at the ranch, things were going great for Lewis. He was now a huge popular success, selling more albums than ever, and, by his own admission, making lots more money than ever. In the 70s, Lewis expanded his group to a septet and began to experiment with fusion, electronic, and soul jazz. Many of his 70s releases, including the 1975 hit album, Sun Goddess, went gold. (Not my favorite musically, but one of the all-time great album covers, at left.) Lewis continued recording well into the 2000s and also devoted considerable time and energy into teaching and promoting jazz education. In 2007, he was named a Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the Arts. However, if you're thinking there must be a fly somewhere in the ointment, you'd be right.\n\nDespite his growing popularity, after The In Crowd, Lewis lost nearly all of his street cred. Fellow jazz musicians and critics viewed Lewis as a sellout with his shift to a watered-down jazz/pop style. In a 1982 review, critic Brian Harrigan wrote that Lewis's once brilliant technique was \"totally submerged by the presence of horn sections, additional keyboards, backing singers and - although I didn't actually hear it - probably someone taping on the side of a kitchen sink.\" In a 1993 review, Down Beat magazine said \"[His] acoustic piano breezes blandly through a set of diluted pop tunes and insipid originals, lightly scattering bluesy signature riffs upon the tepid waters.\" Ouch.\n\nLewis mostly shrugged off the negative press, saying that he had been mixing jazz and pop from the start. In a 2013 interview, he says that after The In Crowd, \"The jazz police disowned us. But at the same time, people like Duke Ellington and Oscar Peterson would come by and put their arms around us and say you guys have something unique, stick with what you have.\" Presumably the ever-increasing royalty checks helped assuage any remaining hurt feelings.\n\nRamsey Lewis in 2020\n\nWhile I understand the reaction by the \"jazz police\" when Lewis decided to follow the money starting in the mid 1960s, it's hard to blame him. Except for a handful of marquee musicians like Dave Brubeck, Miles Davis, and Stan Getz, most jazz musicians in the 50s and 60s were just trying to make ends meet. And when it comes right down to it, Lewis's jazz/pop albums like The In Crowd, Wade In The Water, and Dancing In The Streets, are great fun to listen to.\n\nAfter playing my newly-acquired copy of Swingin' (which, by the way, wasn't a total loss since the reissue is a stereo version to go with my original mono copy of Gentle-Men Of Swing), I pulled out a few more of Lewis's early albums, including Down To Earth from 1959 (maybe my favorite album by Lewis) and Barefoot Sunday Blues from 1963. I hadn't listened to these LPs in a while, and I was struck by how Lewis, Young, and Holt had carved out a really interesting niche with their jazz treatment of folk, blues, and gospel.\n\nTo date, Ramsey Lewis has recorded more than 80 albums. Most of them are readily available for no more than $10 in VG+ or NM condition. I frequently see his albums in the dollar bins or priced at $3 to $5 at used record stores. Nearly anything from the 1950s or 60s is worth picking up. And while I'm not a big fan of 1975's Sun Goddess, it's worth a few bucks just to have the great cover.\n\nEnjoy the music!\n\nI'd like to take this opportunity to say \"I'm sorry\" to Leo Sayer for ignoring him for the last 50 years. Until very recently, I never owned any of his albums or really paid any attention to him whatsoever. As a devotee of serious rock 'n' roll like the Beatles, Stones, CSNY, The Allman Brothers, The Who, etc., I lumped Sayer in with soft rock icons like The Captain & Tennille, Seals & Crofts, Gilbert O'Sullivan, and whoever did that godawful song called \"Afternoon Delight.\" Sure, back in the mid 70s I heard Sayer's hit singles \"You Make Me Feel Like Dancing\" and \"When I Need You\" on the radio about every five minutes, but I didn't rush out and buy them or the album they were featured on, Endless Flight.\n\nBut life is funny sometimes. A few weeks ago I put on my mask and ventured out of the music cave quarantine to a nearby antiques mall which has a couple of used vinyl dealers. It's one of my regular haunts, and I usually go by every couple of months to see what's new. With the virus, I've been doing all my vinyl shopping online, so hadn't been there in about six months.\n\nAs luck would have it, one of the dealers had an amazing sale going on, offering any 20 albums for $15. Seventy-five cent records? Yes, please.\n\nUnfortunately for me, the sale had been going on for nearly a month, so the selection was a little picked over. Nevertheless, I managed to find 60 albums in pretty short order. I got some nice jazz titles, a couple of albums by French crooner Charles Aznavour, a handful of minty classical LPs, a bunch of R&B (that I enjoy but don't listen to all that much), and 10-12 rock albums that I already own but bought anyway because the copies looked cleaner than mine. And I also found 12-15 albums by performers that (as I mentioned in a post from last year about the New Christy Minstrels) I'm normally sort of embarrassed to buy. One of these was Leo Sayer's 1976 album Endless Flight. To be honest, the main reason I bought it was because it looked absolutely pristine -- like it just came out of the rack at Tower Records in 1976. I have an archaeological interest in just about any 45-year-old album that looks brand new.\n\nWith so many albums languishing in my intake pile, it normally would have been months before Endless Flight resurfaced. However, I knocked over a pile of records that were stacked near my desk, and the cover (above, of Leo in midair) caught my eye. So I thought \"what the heck,\" cleaned it and gave it a spin.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was that the musicians are tight. The band is locked in like session pros from the The Wrecking Crew. And then I noticed the sound; the production is excellent, with a natural sound stage and great dynamics. So I grabbed the dust sleeve to check the credits. Holy cow! Everybody plays on this thing, including Lee Ritenour, Ray Parker, Nigel Olsson, Trevor Lawrence, Chuck Rainey, Steve fricking Gadd, Larry Carlton, Willie Weeks, Jeff Porcaro, Michael Omartian, Bill Payne, and Lee Sklar, just to name about half. Well, hell, no wonder it sounds so good.\n\nSayer and Producer Richard Perry\n\nNext I checked the technical credits. It was produced by Richard Perry, who has helmed more than 800 albums ranging from Ringo Starr to Carly Simon to Rod Stewart to Captain Beefheart. The album was engineered by veterans Bill Schnee and Howard Steele, and mastered by Brian Gardner at Allen Zentz Mastering in San Clemente, CA. It's on the Warner Brothers label. With so many ace session guys, a first-rate production team, and a custom, full-color dust sleeve, this was a big-budget production that the label clearly supported.\n\nAt this point I started to pay a little more attention to the music. By the end of the record it hit me that this is not only an exceptionally well-produced and well-played album, the songs are really good. I don't mean Bob Dylan Blonde On Blonde good for Pete's sake, but well-crafted pop songs that Sayer really nails. He wrote or co-wrote about half the songs, and others were penned by pros like Carol Bayer Sager, Andrew Gold, Barry Mann, and Motown's Holland-Dozier-Holland team.\n\nI don't want to go overboard. It's not my new favorite album, and I'm not planning to run out and buy Sayer's entire back catalog. But listening to Endless Flight reminded me once again that some of the music that I am kind of embarrassed to admit I own, is actually really good stuff. No question I will pull this out from time to time to enjoy.\n\nDaltrey, from 1973\n\nSince I knew next to nothing about Sayer, I did a little research. He was born in Sussex, England in 1948, and like a lot of the UK's future rock stars (John Lennon, Keith Richards, Freddy Mercury, Jimmy Page, David Bowie, and Pete Townshend for starters), he went to an arts college where he studied art and design. In the early 70s, he started co-writing songs with David Courtney (who later produced Sayer's first two albums), and the pair had their first top ten single in 1973 with a song called \"Giving It All Away\" off of Roger Daltrey's self-titled solo album, Daltrey (left). In addition to the hit single, Sayer and Courtney co-wrote a total of 10 of the 12 songs on the album, while Courtney played guitar and piano and also produced the album. That same year, Sayer released the first of his own singles (once again produced by Courtney). The second one out of the gate, \"The Show Must Go On,\" made it to number 2 on the UK pop charts. In 1974, Sayer had several more top ten singles in the UK, and his first top ten single in the U.S. His early albums also sold well, including Just A Boy, which made it to number 16 in the U.S. in 1974.\n\nSayer's breakout success came with the release of Endless Flight, which reached number 4 in the UK and number 10 in the U.S. album charts. (Though released at the end of 1976, the album and the singles from it charted in 1977.) Two singles from the album,\"You Make Me Feel Like Dancing\" and \"When I Need Love,\" were both number one hits in the U.S. \"You Make Me Feel Like Dancing\" ended up being the number 13 best-selling single of 1977. By way of comparison, the number one Billboard hit that year was the cringe-worthy \"Tonight's The Night\" by Rod Stewart. I know which one I'd rather hear on the radio every five minutes.\n\nSayer's next few albums did well, but by the early to mid 80s he had mostly dropped from sight. He had a series of financial and legal problems due a larcenous agent and corrupt financial advisers. (In a 2019 article in The Times of London, Sayer says he lost five million pounds.) However, he continued to record and had chart hits in the UK as recently as 2006. In 2005 he moved to Australia, and became and Australian citizen in 2009. He continues to write and record in his home studio. His latest release from 2019 is called Selfie.\n\nSayer in a 2019 photo.\n\nOnce again, my apologies to Leo Sayer, but better late than never.\n\nEnjoy the music!"
