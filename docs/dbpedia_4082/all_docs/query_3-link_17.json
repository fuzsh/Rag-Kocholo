The cause of death has not been disclosed.\n\n“Sadly, Jerry Miller passed away last night,” announced a post on a fan page. “Jo and the family are asking for privacy and respect during this time, and Jo has requested that people refrain from phone calls. Thank you.”\n\nMiller’s death was reported on the Moby Grape Facebook fan page and by journalist Eric Brenner.\n\nIconic rocker Eric Clapton once called Miller “the greatest guitar player in the world,” and Rolling Stone ranked him among the top 100 guitarists of all time.\n\nMiller’s career began in the late 1950s, playing with popular Northwest dance-rock bands.\n\nHe contributed to an early version of “I Fought the Law” by The Bobby Fuller Four and later toured with Fuller.\n\nBorn in 1943, Miller was a contemporary of Jimi Hendrix and Larry Coryell, often watching touring bands with them in the Seattle area. His career began in the late 1950s with popular Northwest dance-rock bands.\n\nMiller is best known for his work with the rock band Moby Grape, which was formed in San Francisco in 1966 with Miller was the lead guitarist in the three-guitar band.\n\nThe Grape signed with Columbia and recorded four albums for the label between 1967 and 1969.\n\n“Hey Grandma,” “8.05” and “Murder In My Heart for The Judge” are two iconic songs Miller co-wrote with Don Stevenson, according to Deadline.\n\nMore recently, “Hey Grandma” was featured in the soundtrack of the 2005 Sean Penn/Nicole Kidman film, “The Interpreter,” and toured the U.S. and Europe before disbanding in 1970, according to Deadline.\n\nThe band regrouped in 1971 for an album and continued to play and record intermittently in various configurations,, after which Miller formed The Rhythm Dukes, collaborating with organist Bill Champlin."
