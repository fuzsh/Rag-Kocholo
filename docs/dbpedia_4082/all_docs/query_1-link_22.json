If you like this stuff take a look at some of Eilen's youtube videos. They feature Jerry.\n\nA standard part of an Eilen show is a cover of Billy Kidd and the Pirate's \"shakin all over - at the end Jerry gets as much time as he wants to show off a bit - similar to Bill Kirchen's \"hot rod lincoln\" thing.\n\nIf you are really into it, there are also youtube videos of him sitting in with Los Straightjackets from when they toured with Eilen last year."
