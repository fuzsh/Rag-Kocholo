        "text": "Saw The Flamin Groovies live circa 1982 and they did a smokin' three-guitar version\n\nof \"Fall On You\" that captured that Moby Grape Magic for about four minutes. Mike\n\nWilhelm from The Charlatans was still in the group then. Followed that up with a wild\n\ncover version of some Beatles song called \"Old Brown Shoe\" or something...lol.\n\nThe Groovies did it faster, with three Gretch and Rickenbacker guitars, and would have probably gotten your seal of approval. They then launched into a rocked-up cover of The Beatles\n\n\"Lady Madonna\" with Cyril Jordan playing some unexpected slide guitar. They did two Raiders covers as well that night, plus the best of their Sire catalog. Killer show for six bucks.\n\nPeter Lewis (Loretta Young's boy) is still going strong with his latest LP...still leaving his mark...\n\nALL ABOUT JAZZ\n\nPeter Lewis: Imagination\n\nAll About Jazz review / Peter Lewis: Imagination album review @ All About Jazz\n\nBy Doug Collette\n\nJune 29, 2023\n\nPeter Lewis' songs are among the most distinctive entries in the body of work by that great but woefully unsung San Francisco band of the '60s, Moby Grape. \"Sittin' By The Window\" and \"Changes, Circles Spinning\" illustrate his unique fingerpicking guitar style, the circular nature of which sounds as effortless as the slightly breathy phrasing of his singing.\n\nLewis' sixth solo album, Imagination, wisely trades on those very strengths and, like its predecessor The Road To Zion (Omad Records, 2019), benefits from the simplicity of arrangements emphasizing guitars and vocal harmonies. Nevertheless, this is a logical extension of the prior album, not merely a soundalike companion piece.\n\nWith the discriminating addition of harmonium and Fender Rhodes, respectively, on \"Just Like Sunshine\" and the alternately majestic and near- frenzied \" Frank Zappa's Ghost,\" this is a dense thirty-eight minutes. But co-producer (with Lewis), recording engineer and mixer.\n\nJohn DeNicola precisely layers his acoustic and electric guitars with organ on the title song too, interwoven with the background singing from Lewis' daughter Arwen (with whom he often performs).\n\nThe overall effect of those components comprises a welcome variety of textures within an audio mix of depth, size and presence. Such clarity of sound especially benefits\n\nAlan Zahn's grand piano on \"Without You\"; his work on the ivories has all the warm immediacy of those bass lines of DeNicola's by which he wends his graceful instrumental way throughout the arrangement.\n\nThe keyboardist's organ playing also adds a stately air to \"The Garden Song (For Judy).\" Something of a curveball, \"If I Had You\" contains echoes of Fifties doo-wop vocals as well as the complex sonority of the Beach Boys group harmonies. But \"Path of Least Resistance\" harkens to the most upbeat rock and roll of Peter Lewis' past, Moby Grape's uplifting \"Fall On You.\"\n\nRob Bailey's cutting electric guitar solo elevates the forward motion of the musicianship there, so much that it can distract from the introspective clarity of the words Lewis intones. But the man's voice has deepened considerably with age and experience, and, as a result, the often stentorian tones in evidence on \"La Mujer\" for instance, add a suitable gravitas.\n\nPrinted in full on a six-panel color insert, also adorned with a drawing by Lewis, lyrics such as those are worth pondering almost as much as the multiple other virtues which distinguish this LP. No less deserving of close attention are the jazzy noir notes of\n\nJeff Elliot's trumpet wafting through \"Saying Goodbye.\"\n\nConcluding these ten tracks on such an unexpected note is nonetheless an appropriate twist from a musician who has defied expectations for over five decades. With all of his estimable collaborators in tow on Imagination, Lewis continues fearlessly along his chosen path of unpredictability.\n\nPersonnel\n\nPeter Lewis: guitar; John DeNicola: bass; Johnathan McEuen: guitar; Rob Bailey: guitar; George Adrian: guitar; Alan Zahn: piano; Jeff Elliot: trumpet; Randy Tico: bass; Brian Delaney: drums; Tommy Allen: drums; Don McCauley: drums.\n\nAdditional Instrumentation\n\nPersonnel: Peter Lewis: vocals, John DeNicola: harmonium, Mellotron, Fender Rhodes, percussion, tambourine, background vocals; Marc Muller: pedal steel.\n\nAlbum Information\n\nTitle: Imagination | Year\n\nReleased: 2023 | Record Label: Omad Records"
