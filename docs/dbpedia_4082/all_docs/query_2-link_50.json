The following list of notable/influential Rock Musicians is by no means complete. The musicians listed are those that readily came to mind, and any additions to the list can be sent using the link at the bottom of the page. The individual home pages for the musicians listed can be reached by clicking on their name in the bio section\n\nAerosmith - is an American hard rock band, sometimes referred to as \"The Bad Boys from Boston\" and \"America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band\". Their style, rooted in blues-based hard rock, has come to also incorporate elements of pop, heavy metal, glam, and rhythm and blues, which has inspired many subsequent rock artists. The band was formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1970. Guitarist Joe Perry and bassist Tom Hamilton, originally in a band together called the Jam Band, met up with singer Steven Tyler, drummer Joey Kramer, and guitarist Ray Tabano, and formed Aerosmith. By 1971, Tabano was replaced by Brad Whitford, and the band began developing a following in Boston. Aerosmith is the bestselling American hard rock band of all time, having sold 150 million albums worldwide, including 66.5 million albums in the United States alone. They also hold the record for the most gold and multi-platinum albums by an American group. The band has scored 21 Top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, nine #1 Mainstream Rock hits, four Grammy Awards, and ten MTV Video Music Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, and in 2005 they were ranked #57 in Rolling Stone magazine's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. 'Artist Discography'\n\nThe Allman Brothers Band - is a Southern rock band based in Macon, Georgia. The band was formed in Jacksonville, Florida in 1969 by brothers Duane Allman (slide guitar and lead guitar) and Gregg Allman (vocals, organ). While the band has been called the \"principal architects of Southern rock\", they also incorporate elements of blues-rock and hard rock, and their live shows have jam band-style improvisation and instrumental songs. In 1971, George Kimball of the Rolling Stone Magazine hailed them as \"the best damn rock and roll band\" of \"the past five years.\" The band has been awarded eleven Gold and five Platinum albums between 1971 and 2005. Rolling Stone ranked them 52nd on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time in 2004. The band continues to record and tour to the present day.\n\nThe actual Allman brothers, Duane and Gregg, had originally been in a garage band called the Escorts, then the Allman Joys and finally the Hour Glass. The Hour Glass had released two failed albums from Liberty Records. The Allman Brothers received the honor of being the last act to play the Fillmore East before it closed in June 1971. The final shows there achieved legendary status, partly due to bands' literally playing all night; in 2005 Gregg Allman would relate how the jamming musicians lost track of time, not realizing it was dawn until the side doors of the Fillmore were opened and the morning light poured in. Duane Allman died not long after the Fillmore East album was certified gold, killed in a motorcycle accident on October 29, 1971 in Macon, Georgia (at the intersection of Hillcrest and Bartlett) when he collided with the rear of a flatbed truck carrying heavy pipe that had turned in front of him. The loss of their leader was hard for the group to bear, but they quickly decided to carry on. The album continued to gain FM radio airplay, with stations even playing 13-minute and 23-minute selections. Dickey Betts filled Duane's former role in completing the last album he participated in, Eat a Peach. 'Artist Discography'\n\nBadfinger - was a rock band formed in Swansea, Wales in the early 1960s and was one of the earliest representatives of the power pop genre. During the early 1970s the band was tagged as the heir apparent to The Beatles, partly because of their close working relationship with the 'Fab Four' and partly because of their similar sound. However, Badfinger fell victim to some of the worst elements of the music industry, resulting in its two principal singers and songwriters committing suicide in 1975 and 1983. Badfinger originated with a band out of Swansea, South Wales in 1961 called The Panthers. The Panthers' featured lineup contained Pete Ham (lead guitar), Ron Griffiths (bass guitar), Roy Anderson (drums), and David 'Dai' Jenkins (guitar). After a handful of moniker changes, in 1964 they settled on The Iveys, named after a street called Ivey Place in Swansea. 'Artist Discography'\n\nThe Band - was a rock group active from 1967 to 1976 and again from 1983 to 1999. The original group (1967-1976) consisted of four Canadians: Robbie Robertson (guitar, piano, vocals); Richard Manuel (piano, harmonica, drums, saxophone, organ, vocals); Garth Hudson (organ, piano, clavinet, accordion, synthesizer, saxophone); and Rick Danko (bass guitar, violin, trombone, vocals), and one American, Levon Helm (drums, mandolin, guitar, bass guitar, vocals).\n\nThe members of the Band first came together as they joined rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins' backing group, The Hawks, one by one between 1958 and 1963. Upon leaving Hawkins in 1964 they were known as The Levon Helm Sextet (the sixth member being sax player Jerry Penfound), then Levon and the Hawks (without Penfound). In 1965, they released a single on Ware Records under the name the Canadian Squires, but returned as Levon and the Hawks for a recording session for Atco later in 1965. At about the same time, Bob Dylan recruited Helm and Robertson for two concerts, then the entire group for his U.S. tour in 1965 and world tour in 1966. They also joined him on the informal recordings that later became The Basement Tapes.\n\nDubbed \"The Band\" by their record company (a name believed to be derived from how they were referred to during their tenure with Dylan), the group left Saugerties, New York, to begin recording their own material. They recorded two of the most acclaimed albums of the late 1960s: their 1968 debut Music from Big Pink (featuring the single \"The Weight\") and 1969's The Band. They broke up in 1976, but reformed in 1983 without founding guitarist Robbie Robertson.\n\nAlthough the Band was always more popular with music journalists and fellow musicians than with the general public, they have remained an admired and influential group. They have been inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked them #50 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. 'Artist Discography'\n\nBig Brother & the Holding Company - is an American rock band that formed in San Francisco in 1965 as part of the psychedelic music scene that also produced the Grateful Dead, Quicksilver Messenger Service and Jefferson Airplane. The original members of the band were Sam Andrew (lead guitar) and James Gurley on guitars, Peter Albin on bass and Chuck Jones (no relation to the animator) on drums, who was replaced by Dave Getz in 1966. The group increased in popularity with the addition in June 1966 of lead singer Janis Joplin. In 1967, the band released their self titled debut album Big Brother and the Holding Company which was moderately successful on the charts. It includes the very Joplin song Down on Me, which almost became a top forty hit. . Their second album, Cheap Thrills, reached the top of the charts in 1968; this album produced Joplin's breakthrough hit, \"Piece of My Heart\". Near the end of 1968, Janis left the band with Sam Andrew and formed a new backing group, the Kozmic Blues Band, with whom she recorded I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again Mama! in 1969. Albin and Getz became members of Country Joe and the Fish. The band reformed in 1969 around the same line-up (except Joplin) —- Albin, Andrew, Getz and Gurley were joined by Nick Gravenites (vocals), Dave Schallock (guitar) and Kathi McDonald (vocals), plus many others on occasion. This lineup lasted until 1972, after which the band performed together only once in 15 years. The latest incarnation started up again in 1987 and has been touring part-time ever since with most of its original members, including Sam Andrew, Peter Albin, Dave Getz, and James Gurley, who was replaced on guitar in 1997 by Tom Finch. 'Artist Discography'\n\nBlack Sabbath - is an English heavy metal band from Birmingham, England. Formed in 1968 by Ozzy Osbourne (lead vocals), Tony Iommi (guitar), Geezer Butler (bass), and Bill Ward (drums and percussion), the band has since experienced multiple lineup changes, with a total of twenty-two former members. Originally formed as a heavy blues-rock band named Earth, the band began incorporating occult- and horror-inspired lyrics with tuned-down guitars, changing their name to Black Sabbath and releasing multiple gold and platinum records in the 1970s. As one of the most influential heavy metal bands of all time, Black Sabbath helped define the genre with releases such as 1970's quadruple-platinum Paranoid. Black Sabbath has sold more than 100 million albums worldwide, and were ranked number one on MTV's Greatest Metal Bands countdown. Ozzy Osbourne was fired from the band in 1979, and while initially replaced by former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio, Black Sabbath would see a revolving lineup in the 1980s and 1990s that included vocalists Ian Gillan, Glenn Hughes, Ray Gillen and Tony Martin. The original lineup reunited with Osbourne in 1997 and released a live album, Reunion, which spawned the Grammy Award-winning single \"Iron Man\" in 2000, thirty years after the song's initial release on Paranoid. Currently, the early 1980s line-up featuring Iommi, Butler, Dio, and Vinny Appice are recording a new album under the moniker Heaven and Hell, a title taken from the 1980 Black Sabbath song and album of the same name. 'Artist Discography'\n\nBlue Cheer - is a San Francisco-based rock group that initially performed and recorded in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and again from the mid-1980s to the present. They are credited as being pioneers of heavy metal music. According to Tim Hills in his book, The Many Lives of the Crystal Ballroom, \"Blue Cheer was the epitome of San Francisco psychedelia. The band was rumored to have been named for a brand of LSD and promoted by renowned LSD chemist and former Grateful Dead patron, Owsley Stanley. Their first hit was a cover version of Eddie Cochran's \"Summertime Blues\" from their debut album Vincebus Eruptum (1968). The single peaked at #14 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, their only such hit, and the album peaked at #11 on the Billboard 200 chart. The group's sound was hard to categorize, but was definitely blues-based, psychedelic, and loud. Blue Cheer's video for Summertime Blues made an appearance in 2005 documentary Metal: A Headbanger's Journey, where Geddy Lee of Rush referred to the group as one of the first heavy metal bands. The band is also regarded as the godfathers of stoner rock. 'Artist Discography'\n\nBlue Öyster Cult - is an American rock band formed in New York in 1967 and still active in 2008. The group is especially well known for these songs: \"Veteran of the Psychic Wars\", \"Joan Crawford\", \"Godzilla\", \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\", \"In Thee\", \"I Love the Night\", \"Take Me Away\", \"Dancing in the Ruins\", \"Cities on Flame with Rock and Roll, and \"Burnin' for You\". The band is a pioneer in heavy metal music both for its hard-edged musical assault and its use of sci-fi and occult imagery. They have sold over 14 million albums worldwide.\n\nTheir debut album Blue Öyster Cult was released in January 1972, with a black and white cover designed by artist Bill Gawlik. The album featured the songs \"Cities on Flame with Rock and Roll,\" \"Stairway to the Stars,\" and \"Then Came the Last Days of May\". The album sold well, and Blue Öyster Cult toured with artists such as the Byrds, Alice Cooper and the Mahavishnu Orchestra. Their next album Tyranny and Mutation, released in 1973, was written while the band was on tour for their first LP. It contained songs such as \"The Red and The Black\" (an ode to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and basically a sped-up rewrite of \"I'm On The Lamb\", from the debut album), \"Hot Rails To Hell\", and \"Baby Ice Dog\", the first of the band's many collaborations with Patti Smith. The band's third album, Secret Treaties (1974) received positive reviews, featuring songs such as \"Career of Evil\" (also co-written by Patti Smith), \"Dominance and Submission\" and \"Astronomy.\" As a result of constant touring, the band was now capable of headlining arenas. \"More Cowbell!\" 'Artist Discography'\n\nBuffalo Springfield - was a short-lived but influential folk rock group that served as a springboard for the careers of Neil Young, Stephen Stills, Richie Furay and Jim Messina and is most famous for the song \"For What It's Worth\". After its formation in April 1966, a series of disruptions, including internal bickering, as well as the pressure of working in the music industry, resulted in constant changes in the group's lineup — and ultimately culminated in the group's disbanding after roughly 25 months. Buffalo Springfield released a total of three albums but also left a legacy that includes many demo recordings, studio outtakes, and live recordings. Although the Buffalo Springfield was never a major commercial success, \"For What It’s Worth\" was a legitimate hit, and the group’s reputation would only grow stronger with the later successes of its members. Stills went on to form Crosby, Stills, and Nash with David Crosby of The Byrds and Graham Nash of The Hollies in 1968, with Young later joining as a full member in 1969. 'Artist Discography'\n\nThe Byrds - was a popular American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1964. Their trademark songs include pop covers of Bob Dylan's \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and Pete Seeger’s \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\", as well as the originals \"I’ll Feel a Whole Lot Better\", and \"Eight Miles High\". The Byrds were popular and influential during the late 1960s and early 1970s. The band melded the British Invasion sound with elements of contemporary folk and pop music. They also helped forge such subgenres as folk rock, space rock, raga rock, psychedelic rock, jangle pop, and –- on their 1968 album Sweetheart of the Rodeo, which featured Gram Parsons, –- country rock. After several line-up changes (with lead singer/guitarist Roger McGuinn as the only consistent member), they broke up in 1973. In 1991 they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and several band members have launched successful solo careers after leaving the group. In 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked them #45 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. 'Artist Discography'\n\nCanned Heat - is a blues-rock/boogie band that formed in Los Angeles in 1965. The group has been noted for its own interpretations of blues material as well as for efforts to promote the interest in this type of music and its original artists. It was launched by two blues enthusiasts, Alan Wilson and Bob Hite, who took the name from Tommy Johnson's 1928 \"Canned Heat Blues\", a song about an alcoholic who has desperately turned to drinking Sterno, generically called \"canned heat\". After appearances at Monterey and Woodstock, at the end of the '60s the band acquired worldwide fame with a lineup consisting of Bob Hite, vocals, Alan Wilson guitar, harmonica and vocals, Henry Vestine (or Harvey Mandel) on lead guitar, Larry Taylor on bass, and Adolfo ('Fito') de la Parra on drums. The music and attitude of Canned Heat afforded them a large following and established the band as one of the popular acts of the hippie era. Canned Heat appeared at most major musical events at the end of the '60s and they were able to deliver on stage electrifying performances of blues standards and their own material and occasionally to indulge into lengthier 'psychedelic' solos. Two of their songs - \"Going up the Country\" and \"On the Road Again\" - became international hits; both were re-workings of obscure blues. At the time all their albums were released for worldwide distribution. Since the early '70s numerous personnel changes have occurred and today, in the fifth decade of the band's existence, Fito de la Parra is the only member from the \"classic\" 1960s lineup. He has written a book about the band's career. Larry Taylor, whose presence in the band has not been steady, is the other surviving member from the earliest lineups. Harvey Mandel, Walter Trout and Junior Watson are among the guitarists who gained notoriety for playing in later editions of the band. British blues pioneer John Mayall has frequently found musicians for his band among former Canned Heat members. 'Artist Discography'\n\nCaptain Beefheart - born Don Glen Vliet on January 15, 1941) is an American musician and visual artist, best known by the pseudonym Captain Beefheart. His musical work was mainly conducted with a rotating assembly of musicians called The Magic Band, which was active from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s. Van Vliet was chiefly a singer and harmonica player, occasionally playing noisy, untrained free jazz-influenced saxophone and keyboards. His compositions are characterized by their odd mixtures of shifting time signatures and by their surreal lyrics, while Van Vliet himself is noted for his dictatorial approach to his musicians and for his enigmatic relationship with the public. Van Vliet joined the newly formed Magic Band in 1965, quickly taking over as band leader. Their early output was rooted in blues and rock music, but Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band (as they were collectively known) gradually adopted a more experimental approach. 1969 saw the release of their best known album, Trout Mask Replica, which was produced by Van Vliet's childhood friend Frank Zappa and is today regarded by some as a groundbreaking and influential masterpiece. Van Vliet released several more albums throughout the 1970s, but his group was beset by shifting line-ups and a lack of commercial success. Towards the end of the decade, he settled with a group of younger musicians and received acclaim for his three final albums, released between 1978 and 1982. Van Vliet's legacy is one of limited commercial success, but nonetheless one with a devoted following. Despite this lack of commercial success, his influence on musicians, especially those of punk and new wave, has been described as \"incalculable\".Since the end of his musical career around 1982, Van Vliet has made few public appearances, preferring a quiet life in his northern Humboldt County, California home where he has concentrated on a career in painting. His interest in art dates back to a childhood talent for sculpting, and his work—employing what has been described as a \"neo-primitive abstract-expressionist aesthetic\", has received international recognition. 'Artist Discography'\n\nCream - a 1960s British rock band consisting of bassist/lead vocalist Jack Bruce, guitarist/vocalist Eric Clapton, and drummer Ginger Baker. Their sound was characterized by a hybrid of blues, hard rock and psychedelic rock. In retrospective to be \"the first supergroup\", Cream combined Clapton's blues guitar playing with the powerful voice and intense basslines of Jack Bruce and the jazz-influenced drumming of Ginger Baker. They have sold over 35 million albums worldwide. Wheels of Fire was the world's first platinum-selling double album. Cream's music included songs based on traditional blues such as \"Crossroads\" and \"Spoonful\", and modern blues such as \"Born Under a Bad Sign\", as well as more eccentric songs such as \"Strange Brew\", \"Tales of Brave Ulysses\" and \"Toad\". Cream's biggest hits were \"I Feel Free\" (UK, #11), \"Sunshine of Your Love\" (US, #5), \"White Room\" (US, #6), \"Crossroads\" (US, #28), and \"Badge\". Cream first visited the United States in March 1967 to play nine dates at the RKO Theater in New York. They returned to record Disraeli Gears in New York between 11 May and 15 May 1967. Cream's second album was released in November 1967 and reached the Top 5 in the charts on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nFrom its creation, Cream was faced with some fundamental problems that would later lead to its dissolution in November 1968. The rivalry between Bruce and Baker created tensions in the band. Clapton also felt that the members of the band did not listen to each other enough. Clapton once told a story that when Cream were playing in a concert, he stopped playing and neither Baker nor Bruce noticed. Clapton has also commented that Cream's later gigs mainly consisted of its members showing off. Cream decided that it would break up in May of 1968 during a tour of the US. Later, in July, an official announcement was made that the band would break up after a farewell tour of the United States and after playing two concerts in London. Cream finished its tour of the United States with a 4 November concert in Rhode Island and performed in the UK for the last time in London on 25 and 26 November. In 1993, Cream was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and set aside their differences to perform at the induction ceremony. Initially, the trio was wary about performing, until encouraging words from Robbie Robertson inspired them to try. The end result was an incendiary set consisting of \"Sunshine of Your Love\", \"Crossroads\", and - interestingly, as the band had never played it live during their original tenure - \"Born Under a Bad Sign\". Clapton mentioned in his acceptance speech that their rehearsal the day before the ceremony had marked the first time they had played together in 25 years. 'Artist Discography'\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival - was an American rock and roll band who gained popularity in the late 1960s and early 1970s with a string of successful songs from multiple albums released in 1968, 1969 and 1970. The group consisted of singer, lead guitarist, and primary writer John Fogerty, rhythm guitarist and brother of John, Tom Fogerty, bass player Stu Cook, and drummer Doug Clifford. Their musical style encompassed rock and roll and swamp rock genres. CCR's music is still a staple of American and worldwide radio airplay and often figures in various media. John Fogerty, Doug Clifford, and Stu Cook (all born 1945) met at senior high school in El Cerrito, California and began playing instrumentals together under the name The Blue Velvets. The trio also backed singer Tom Fogerty— John's older brother by three years—at live gigs and in the recording studio. By 1964, the band had signed to Fantasy Records, an independent jazz label based in San Francisco at the time. Fantasy had released Cast Your Fate to the Wind, a national hit for jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi. The record's success was the subject of an NET TV special, which prompted budding songwriter John Fogerty to contact the label. For the band's first release, however, Fantasy co-owner Max Weiss renamed the group The Golliwogs (after the children's literary character, Golliwogg), apparently to cash in on a wave of popular British bands with similar names. During this period, band roles underwent some changes. Stu Cook had gone from piano to bass guitar and Tom Fogerty became the band's rhythm guitarist. John Fogerty also began to write much of the band's material. Most notably, the young guitarist had taken over lead vocal duty.\n\nThe debut album \"Creedence Clearwater Revival\" struck a responsive note with the emerging underground pop culture press, which touted CCR as a band worthy of attention. More importantly, AM radio programmers around the United States took note when a song from the LP, \"Suzie Q\", received substantial airplay in the San Francisco Bay Area as well as on Chicago's WLS. Blues aficionados doubtless appreciated the similarities between CCR's tough style and R&B artists on the Chess and Vee-Jay labels. \"Suzie Q\", the band's remake of a 1956 hit for rockabilly singer Dale Hawkins, went on to be the band's first single to crack the Top 40. It just missed the Top Ten at #11 and was Creedence's only top 40 hit not written by John Fogerty. Other singles included a cover of Screamin' Jay Hawkins' \"I Put a Spell On You\" and \"Porterville\". 'Artist Discography'\n\nCrosby, Stills and Nash (and Young) - was a folk rock/rock supergroup made up of David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash, also known as Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (CSNY) when joined by occasional fourth member Neil Young. They are noted for their intricate vocal harmonies, often tumultuous interpersonal relationships, political activism, and lasting influence on music and culture. Initially formed by the trio of David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash, the genesis of the group lies in two 1960s rock bands, The Byrds and The Hollies, and the demise of a third, Buffalo Springfield. Friction existed between David Crosby and his bandmates in the Byrds, and he was dismissed from the Byrds in the fall of 1967. By early 1968, Buffalo Springfield had also disintegrated over personal issues, and after aiding in putting together the band’s final album, Stephen Stills found himself unemployed by the summer. He and Crosby began meeting informally and jamming, the results of one encounter in Florida on Crosby’s schooner being the song “Wooden Ships,” composed in collaboration with another guest, Paul Kantner. Graham Nash had been introduced to Crosby when the Byrds had toured the UK in 1966, and when the Hollies ventured to California in 1968, Nash resumed his acquaintance with Crosby. At a party in February 1969 at Cass Elliot's house, Nash asked Stills and Crosby to repeat their performance of a new song by Stills, “You Don't Have To Cry,” with Nash improvising a second harmony part. The vocals jelled, and the three realized that they had a unique vocal chemistry.\n\nThe trio's first album, Crosby, Stills, & Nash, was released in May 1969 and was an immediate hit, spawning two Top 40 hit singles and receiving key airplay on the new FM radio format. With the exception of drummer Dallas Taylor, Stills had handled the lion's share of the instrumental parts himself. Realizing the need for additional musicians as a necessity for touring to promote their music, Neil Young was brought on board. The restructured group went on tour in the late summer of 1969 through the following January. Their second gig was a baptism-by-fire at the Woodstock Festival; CSNY's recording of the Joni Mitchell song memorializing Woodstock would later become a hit and the recording most associated with the festival. 'Artist Discography'\n\nDavid Bowie - born David Robert Jones on 8 January 1947) is a British musician, actor, record producer and arranger. Active in five decades of rock music and frequently reinventing his music and image, Bowie is widely regarded as an innovator, particularly for his work in the 1970s. He has been cited as an influence by many musicians. Bowie is also known for his distinctive baritone voice. Although he released an album and numerous singles earlier, David Bowie first caught the eye and ear of the public in the autumn of 1969, when his space-age mini-melodrama \"Space Oddity\" reached the top five of the UK singles chart. After a three-year period of experimentation he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era as the flamboyant, androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust, spearheaded by the hit single \"Starman\" and the album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. The relatively short-lived Ziggy persona epitomised a career often marked by musical innovation, reinvention and striking visual presentation.\n\nIn 1975, Bowie achieved his first major American crossover success with the number-one single \"Fame\" and the hit album Young Americans, which the singer identified as \"plastic soul\". The sound constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees. He then confounded the expectations of both his record label and his American audiences by recording the minimalist album Low – the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno over the next two years. Arguably his most experimental works to date, the so-called \"Berlin Trilogy\" albums all reached the UK Top Five.\n\nAfter uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single \"Ashes to Ashes\" and its parent album, Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps). He paired with Queen for the 1981 UK chart-topper \"Under Pressure\", but consolidated his commercial – and, until then, most profitable – sound in 1983 with the album Let's Dance, which yielded the hit singles \"Let's Dance\", \"China Girl\", and \"Modern Love\". In the BBC's 2002 poll of the 100 Greatest Britons, Bowie ranked 29. Throughout his career he has sold an estimated 136 million albums, and ranks among the ten best-selling acts in UK pop history. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked him 39th on their list of the 100 Greatest Rock Artists of All Time. 'Artist Discography'\n\nDeep Purple - is an English rock band formed in Hertfordshire in 1968. Along with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, they are considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock, although some band members have tried not to categorize themselves as any one genre. The band also incorporated pop and progressive rock elements. They were once listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's loudest band, and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide. Deep Purple was ranked #22 on VH1's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock program. The band has gone through many line-up changes and an eight-year hiatus (1976-84). The 1968-76 line-ups are commonly labelled Mark I, II, III and IV. Their second and most commercially successful line-up featured Ian Gillan (vocals), Ritchie Blackmore (guitar), Jon Lord (keyboards), Roger Glover (bass guitar) and Ian Paice (drums). This line-up was active 1969-73 and was revived from 1984-89 and again in 1993 before the rift between Blackmore and other members became unbridgeable. The current line-up including guitarist Steve Morse has been much more stable, though Lord's retirement in 2002 has left Paice as the only original member.\n\nDeep Purple are considered to be one of the hardest touring bands in the world. From 1968 until today (with the exception of their 1976-1983 split) they continue to tour around the world. In 2007 they received special award for selling more than 150 000 tickets in France with 40 dates in the country in 2007 alone. In 2007, Purple's Rapture of the Deep Tour was voted #6 concert tour of the year (in all music genres) by Planet Rock listeners.. Rolling Stones's A Bigger Bang Tour was voted #5 and beat Purple's tour with only 1%. Deep Purple is due to release new live compilation DVD box, Around the World Live, in May 2008. In February of 2008, the band made their first ever appearance in Moscow Kremlin at the personal request of Dmitry Medvedev who at the time was considered a shoo-in for the seat of the Presidency of Russia. In September of 2008, the band appeared in the 4,000-seat ancient Roman amphitheatre at Caesarea, Israel, within a four-performance Israeli tour. The band's Israeli tour was originally planned to consist of two performances, both in Caesarea, but two more performances were added in Hangar 11, Tel Aviv in view of the demand for tickets, both original performances being sold out minutes after tickets were placed for sale on-line. The band has decided to return to Israel later in September 2008, after a three-performance tour in Spain, in order to give the two additional concerts. The band were iconically popular in Israel in the 1970s, have influenced Israeli rock music and remain consistently popular today, having successfully bridged the generation gap as evident in the current tour. 'Artist Discography'\n\nDoobie Brothers - are an American rock group. They have sold over 22 million albums in the United States from the 1970s to the present. The Doobie Brothers were inducted into The Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004. As one of the most popular Californian rock bands of the '70s, the Doobie Brothers evolved from a mellow boogie band to a finely tuned pop band by the end of the decade. The group racked up a string of gold and platinum albums in the US, along with a number of radio hits like \"Listen to the Music,\" \"Black Water\" and \"China Grove.\" The roots of the Doobie Brothers lay in Pud, a short-lived Californian country-rock band in the vein of Moby Grape featuring guitarist/vocalist Tom Johnston and drummer John Hartman. After Pud collapsed in 1969, the pair began jamming with bassist John Shogren and guitarist Patrick Simmons. The quartet decided to form a group, naming themselves the Doobie Brothers after a slang term for marijuna. Soon, the Doobies earned a strong following throughout Southern California, especially among the biker crowd, (harleys and leather) ,and they were signed to Warner Bros. The Doobie line-up seemed to be in a constant state of flux, as the member roster seemed to change with each album released, moving from a trio format to as high as 12 members at one point.\n\nThe current lineup includes Michael Hossack on drums, Tom Johnston on guitar/vocals, John McFee on guitar/strings/vocals, Patrick Simmons on guitar/vocal, Guy Allison on keyboards/vocal, Marc Russo on saxaphone, Skylark on bass/vocal , Ed Toth on drums.\n\nThe on and off players were,Michael McDonald on keyboards/synthesizers/Vocals 1992 (two shows), 1995 tour (as a special guest) (McDonald still appears as a guest at certain shows), Chet McCracken on drums/percussion 1993 (filled in for Hossack in July), 1995 (filled in for Knudsen), Andy Newmark on drums, percussion (subbing for Knudsen in 1981), Bernie Chiaravalle on guitar/backing vocals (1995 tour), Bill Payne on keyboards (early 1974, toured with the group for a short period), and Ed Wynne on saxophone (2002) (filling in for Russo). 'Artist Discography'\n\nThe Doors - were an American rock band formed in 1965 in Los Angeles, California by vocalist Jim Morrison, keyboardist Ray Manzarek, drummer John Densmore, and guitarist Robby Krieger. The Doors' music was a fusion of psychedelic rock, hard rock, blues-rock, and acid rock. They were considered a controversial band, due mostly to Morrison's cryptic lyrics and unpredictable stage persona. The remaining members of the band dissolved it in March 1973, short of two years after Morrison's death on July 3rd 1971. According to the RIAA, they have sold over 32 million albums in the US alone.\n\nThe origins of The Doors lay in a chance meeting between acquaintances and fellow UCLA film school alumni Jim Morrison and Ray Manzarek on Venice Beach California in July 1965. Morrison told Manzarek he had been writing songs (Morrison said \"I was taking notes at a fantastic rock-n-roll concert going on in my head\") and, with Manzarek's encouragement, sang \"Moonlight Drive\". Impressed by Morrison's lyrics, Manzarek suggested they form a band.\n\nKeyboardist Ray Manzarek was in a band called Rick & the Ravens with his brother Rick Manzarek, while Robby Krieger and John Densmore were playing with The Psychedelic Rangers.. In August, Densmore joined the group and, along with members of The Ravens and bass player Pat Sullivan (later credited using her married name Patricia Hansen in the 1997 box CD release), recorded a six-song demo in September 1965. This was widely bootlegged and appeared in full on the 1997 Doors box set. The group recruited guitarist Robby Krieger, and the final lineup — Morrison, Manzarek, Krieger and Densmore — was complete. The band took their name from the title of a book by Aldous Huxley, The Doors of Perception (1954). That title was in turn taken from a line in a poem by the 18th-century artist and poet William Blake: \"If the doors of perception were cleansed, every thing would appear to man as it is: infinite\".\n\nThe Doors were unusual among rock groups because they did not use a bass guitar when playing live. Instead, Manzarek played the bass lines with his left hand on the newly invented Fender Rhodes bass keyboard, an offshoot of the Fender Rhodes electric piano, playing other keyboards with his right hand. On their studio albums (with the notable exception of their first record), The Doors did, however, use bass players, such as Jerry Scheff, Doug Lubahn (who also played with Clear Light), Harvey Brooks, Kerry Magness, Lonnie Mack, Larry Knechtel, Leroy Vinnegar, and Ray Neapolitan. Many of The Doors' original songs were group compositions, with Morrison or Krieger contributing the lyrics and an initial melody, and the others providing harmonic and rhythmic suggestions, or even entire sections of songs, such as Manzarek's organ introduction to \"Light My Fire\". 'Artist Discography'\n\nThe Eagles - are an American country rock band formed in Los Angeles, California during the early 1970s. With five number-one singles and six number-one albums, the Eagles were one of the most successful recording artists of the decade. At the end of the 20th century, two of their albums, Eagles: Their Greatest Hits 1971–1975 and Hotel California, ranked among the ten best-selling albums according to the Recording Industry Association of America. The best-selling studio album Hotel California is rated as the thirty-seventh album in the Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and the band was ranked number 75 on the magazine's 2004 list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. They also have the best selling album in the U.S. to date with Eagles: Their Greatest Hits 1971–1975. The Eagles broke up in 1980, but reunited in 1994 for Hell Freezes Over, a mix of live and new studio tracks. They have toured intermittently since then, and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.\n\nIn 2007, the Eagles released Long Road out of Eden, their first full studio album in 28 years. The group's debut album was quickly recorded and released in June 1972. Eagles was filled with natural, sometimes innocent country rock, and yielded three Top 40 singles. The first single and lead track, \"Take It Easy\", was a song written by Glenn Frey and his neighbor and fellow country-folk rocker Jackson Browne. Frey heard Browne recording it, contributed two lines to it (for which he got co-writing credit) and asked if the Eagles could use it. The song reached number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and propelled the Eagles to stardom. The single was followed by the bluesy \"Witchy Woman\" and the soft country rock ballad \"Peaceful Easy Feeling\", charting at No. 9 and No. 22 respectively. The Eagles were a major force in popularizing the Southern California country rock sound around the nation. Rolling Stone magazine's 2003 list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" ranked Eagles at number 374. 'Artist Discography'\n\nELP - Emerson, Lake and Palmer consisted of Keith Emerson (keyboards), Greg Lake (guitar, bass guitar, vocals) and Carl Palmer (drums, percussion). The Nice (with Keith Emerson on keyboards) and King Crimson (with Greg Lake on bass and vocals), having played at the same venues led to Emerson and Lake working together, and finding their styles to be very compatible, they went in search of a drummer with the intention of forming a trio. Before settling on Carl Palmer, who at that time was the drummerof Atomic Rooster, they approached Mitch Mitchell of The Jimi Hendrix Experience. Mitchell was uninterested but passed the idea to Jimi Hendrix. Hendrix, tired of his band and wanting to try something different, expressed an interest in playing with the group. Since Emerson and Lake had settled on Palmer by then, this led the British press to speculate about a supergroup called HELP, or \"Hendrix, Emerson, Lake & Palmer\". Hendrix died shortly thereafter, and the three pressed on as Emerson, Lake and Palmer. Their sound was dominated by the Hammond organ and Moog synthesizer of Emerson. The band's compositions were heavily influenced by classical music in addition to jazz, hard rock, and the musical stylings of Clouds. Their live perfomances were a mix of virtuoso musicianship and theatrics that gained the band a unique place in musical history. 'Artist Discography'\n\nThe Electric Light Orchestra - commonly abbreviated ELO, were a symphonic rock group from Birmingham, England who released eleven studio albums between 1971 and 1986 and another album in 2001. ELO were formed to accommodate Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne's desire to create modern pop songs with heavily classical overtones, but falling under a light rock category. However, the band's direction for most of their existence was set by Lynne who, after the band's debut record, wrote and arranged all of the group's original compositions and produced every album. It was in the United States that the band were first successful, billed as 'The English guys with the big fiddles'. They soon gained a cult following despite lukewarm reviews back in their native United Kingdom. They were managed by agent Don Arden, father of Sharon Osbourne. By the mid-1970s, they had become one of the biggest selling bands in music. From 1972 to 1986, ELO accumulated twenty-six U.K. Top 40 hit singles and twenty U.S. Top 40 hit singles. The group also scored twenty Top 20 U.K. hit singles, as well as fifteen Top 20 appearances in the U.S. Billboard charts. The band also holds the record for having the most Billboard Top 40 hits of any band in U.S. chart history without ever having a #1 single. 'Artist Discography'\n\nThe Electric Prunes - are a rock band who first achieved international attention as an experimental psychedelic group in the late 1960s, and contributed two tracks to the soundtrack of Easy Rider. After a period in which they had little control over their music, they disappeared for thirty years, reforming as a recording and touring band in 2001.\n\nThe group started in the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles, though during the group's long disbandment, rumors circulated that they were from Seattle. Their first hit was discovered by Seattle disk jockey Pat O'Day at KJR (AM) and was very popular in that city before it broke into the national charts. The first members, Ken Williams (guitar), James Lowe (lead vocal, autoharp), Michael Weakley (drums) and Mark Tulin (bass) called themselves The Sanctions, and later, Jim and the Lords. Soon, Dick Hargrave joined on organ, but shortly thereafter left to pursue graphic arts. Their lineup changed many times, including one lineup with Kenny Loggins.\n\nLowe, Tulin, Williams and Weakley were introduced to David Hassinger, then resident engineer at RCA studios, who arranged for them to record some demos at Leon Russell's home recording facility (which he called Sky Hill Studios). Hassinger also suggested they needed a new name. In response, the band produced a long list of suggestions, with The Electric Prunes last as a joke. Somehow it stuck.\n\nAfter a period of 30 years, the original quartet of Lowe, Tulin, Williams and Weakley met in the studio to consider a revival. As a result Lowe, Tulin and Williams (the three who had played on all the early recordings) were joined by two new members including James Lowe's son to reform the band. They began touring internationally in 2001, and in 2002 released a new recording titled Artifact and a DVD album called Rewired. Continuing the momentum in 2007, the trio of Lowe, Tulin, and Williams released a new CD entitled Feedback, a hook-laden orgy of tremolo, reverb, rollicking drums and hilariously juvenile lyrics (\"I have to off myself just to get away from you\") that was heard by too few critics but hailed as a masterpiece by some of those who did, including author Elizabeth Hand , who blogged, \"'Feedback' is truly one of the best albums I've heard in years. Anyone who's expecting an oldies nostalgia act is going to be wicked disappointed: these guys sound like they're still twenty years old with something to prove.\"\n\nThe Prunes have also taken residence in myspace, reaching out to fans new and old. They are now recording and touring with a new drummer, Walter Garces, who has been called the \"drum guru\" of LA. In 2007, the rock band The Verve ran the track \"Holy Are You\" before their concerts. 'Artist Discography'\n\nThe Fabulous Thunderbirds - are a blues-rock band, formed in 1974. After performing for several years in the Austin, Texas blues scene, the band won a recording contract with Takoma/Chrysalis Records, and later on signed with Epic Records. Their first two albums, released in 1979 and 1980 with Keith Ferguson on bass guitar and Mike Buck on drums, initially sold poorly, but are now regarded as successful blues recordings. The Thunderbirds' blues style mixed Texas blues with the harmonica laced swamp blues sounds of Slim Harpo and Lazy Lester, both of whom the Thunderbirds covered. The band's third album, Butt-Rockin', released in 1981, took the band closer to old rhythm and blues and added additional musicians playing piano and brass. Although the Fabulous Thunderbirds had become favorites of fellow musicians — opening shows for the likes of The Rolling Stones and Eric Clapton — and had been critically well-received, the band's records did not sell particularly well.\n\nThe single, \"Tuff Enuff\" was featured in the 1986 film Gung Ho. It was also featured in the film Tough Guys, as was the follow-up single \"Wrap It Up\". \"Tuff Enuff\" remains as the band's only Top 10 hit, peaking at #10 on the Billboard Hot 100. The band's music was also used in the 1987 movie, Hot Pursuit. The Fabulous Thunderbirds' next album, Hot Number, fell off the charts quickly. But following that, their recording of Powerful Stuff was a success, based in part upon its inclusion in the 1988 film Cocktail. The band then embarked on a long series of line-up changes and albums throughout the 1990s. Jimmie Vaughan left the band to play in a duo with his brother Stevie Ray Vaughan; following Stevie Ray's death in 1990, Jimmie pursued a full-time solo career. The Fabulous Thunderbirds replaced Vaughan with two guitarists, Duke Robillard and Kid Bangham. In the early 1990s, Kim Wilson recorded a pair of solo albums while continuing to tour with The Fabulous Thunderbirds. In 1994, the band recorded a ninth album, Roll of the Dice, which was released on Private Music in 1995. High Water followed in 1997. On the evening of February 16th, 2000, The Fabulous Thunderbirds made history, becoming the first band ever to be broadcast on the internet using high-definition cameras. The companion DVD, Invitation Only, is one of the first high-resolution multi-track recordings of a live concert event. The companion CD Live! was released in 2001.\n\nThe band recorded Painted On in 2005, produced by Steve Berlin (of Los Lobos) and featuring Rachel Nagy of The Detroit Cobras on the track Love Speaks Louder Than Words. Guitarist Nick Curran joined Wilson on vocals for Two Time Fool.\n\nThe Fabulous Thunderbirds have maintained an intense touring schedule throughout the United States and Europe since the early 1990s. The band will be returning to Europe again during the spring and summer of 2008, and will also perform at many blues festivals throughout the U.S. 'Artist Discography'\n\nThe Flying Burrito Brothers - was an early country rock band, best known for its influential debut album, 1969's The Gilded Palace of Sin. Although the group is most often mentioned in connection with country rock legends Gram Parsons and Chris Hillman, the group endured many personnel changes. The \"Flying Burrito Brothers\" \"borrowed\" their name from the original \"Flying Burrito Brothers\", which consisted of bassist Ian Dunlop and drummer Mickey Gauvin, Parsons's bandmates from the Boston-based International Submarine Band, plus any of a loose coalition of musicians. In 1968, the original Brothers moved from Los Angeles to New York City to concentrate on creating and playing music without the distractions of the music industry. From New York they continued to tour the Northeast United States, playing their eclectic traditional/rockabilly/blues/R&B-oriented version of rock, using the name \"The Flying Burrito Brothers East\" after Parsons's group became famous.\n\nMeanwhile, on the West Coast, Parsons and musician Chris Hillman thought this same moniker would be perfectly suited to the band they had been dreaming of since early 1968, when, as members of Roger McGuinn's band The Byrds, they created one of the first country-oriented rock albums, Sweetheart of the Rodeo. They immersed themselves in their vision in their house in the San Fernando Valley, dubbed \"Burrito Manor\", even replacing their wardrobe with a set of custom country-Western suits from Nudie's Rodeo Tailors, tailor to the C&W stars. Parsons's suit had marijuana leaf embroidery, as seen on The Gilded Palace of Sin album cover & on Nudie's Rodeo Tailors Online Museum Celebrity Photo Gallery. At this juncture, the band also included pianist/bassist Chris Ethridge and pedal steel guitarist Pete Kleinow. 'Artist Discography'\n\nFrank Zappa & the Mothers of Invention - was an American rock and roll band active from 1964 to 1975. They mainly performed works by and were the original recording group of composer and guitarist Frank Zappa, although other members have an occasional writing credit. Initially, the group was named \"The Soul Giants\" and consisted of drummer Jimmy Carl Black, bass player Roy Estrada, saxophonist Davy Coronado, guitarist Ray Hunt, and vocalist Ray Collins. Some biographers report that Collins got into a fight with Hunt in 1964 (according to Collins: \"I never touched Hunt, I don't even remember shaking his hand.\"), after which Hunt quit the group and Frank Zappa took his place as guitarist - quickly becoming the leader of the group, which changed its name to \"The Mothers\" on Sunday, May 10, 1964 (that year's Mother's Day).\n\nNow credited as \"The Mothers\", Zappa and the group recorded two acclaimed live albums, Fillmore East - June 1971 and Just Another Band From L.A., but Zappa again disbanded the band in late 1971 after an attacker had pushed him offstage into an orchestra pit at a concert in London, resulting in serious injuries that kept him off the road for more than a year. Although Zappa had always released, and would continue to release, albums explicitly as solo artist (Lumpy Gravy, 1967; Hot Rats, 1969; Chunga's Revenge, 1970; Apostrophe ('), 1974), various line ups of the Mothers followed in the 70s, the band now clearly a mere vehicle for Frank Zappa. Albums were variously released as Zappa/Mothers (Roxy & Elsewhere, 1974) or Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention (One Size Fits All, 1975) until Zappa permanently dropped the moniker in 1976, from the release of Zoot Allures (1976) onwards. Later releases by Zappa in CD format contain Mothers of Invention material from various line-ups (e.g., You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 3, 1988) and is occasionally credited as such on the album cover art (Playground Psychotics, 1992; Ahead of Their Time, 1993). Since 1980, Jimmy Carl Black, Don Preston and Bunk Gardner, plus other former members of the Mothers of Invention, have occasionally performed and recorded under the name \"The Grandmothers\" or \"The Grande Mothers Re:Invented\", performing music by Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart as well as originals and blues standards. 'Artist Discography'\n\nGenesis - is an English rock band formed in 1967. With approximately 150 million albums sold worldwide, Genesis are among the top 30 highest-selling recording artists of all time. In 1988, the band won a Grammy Award for Best Concept Music Video. The longest-tenured members of Genesis are Phil Collins, Mike Rutherford, and Tony Banks. Peter Gabriel, Anthony Phillips and Steve Hackett were also members of the band in its early days.\n\nGenesis began as a 1960s pop band playing moody, simple keyboard-driven melodies. During the 1970s, they evolved into a progressive rock band, incorporating complex song structures and elaborate instrumentation, while their concerts became theatrical experiences with innovative stage design, pyrotechnics, elaborate costumes and onstage stories. This second phase was characterized by lengthy performances such as the 23 minute \"Supper's Ready\" and The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, the 1974 concept album. In the 1980s, the band produced accessible pop music based on melodic hooks; this change of direction gave them their first number one album in the United Kingdom, Duke, and their only number one single in the United States, \"Invisible Touch\".\n\nGenesis has changed personnel several times. Founding member Anthony Phillips left the band in 1970 due to stage fright. In 1975, Collins, then the band's drummer, replaced Gabriel as lead singer after a lengthy search for a replacement. To facilitate Collins's move to lead vocals during concerts, Bill Bruford, and later Chester Thompson, played drums for the band, with Collins joining in briefly during lengthy instrumental passages. After Phil Collins left the band in 1996, Genesis recruited Ray Wilson (formerly of Stiltskin), who appeared on the 1997 album Calling All Stations. As a result of the commercial failure of Calling All Stations, the band announced an indefinite hiatus. However, in 2007, Banks, Collins and Rutherford reunited for a 20-city tour of Europe and North America, which included a free concert at Rome's Circo Massimo in front of 500,000 fans. 'Artist Discography'\n\nGrand Funk Railroad - (also known as Grand Funk) is an American rock band. The Grand Funk Railroad lineup was highly popular during the 1970s, selling over 25 million records, selling out arenas worldwide and being awarded four RIAA gold albums in 1970, the most for any American group that year. The current Grand Funk Railroad lineup uses the nickname \"The American Band\", from their hit song \"We're an American Band\". A popular take on the band during their heyday was that the critics hated them, but audiences loved them. Contrary to the name, the band is not a real funk band; but rather an attempt to pun the name \"Grand Trunk Railroad\" as that railroad went through Flint; although some sources cite the band's \"The Loco-Motion\" cover song as a funk track.\n\nDespite critical pans and lack of radio airplay, the group's first six albums (5 original material, one live album), released from 1969 to 1971, were successful. In 1970 Knight launched an intensive advertising campaign to promote the album Closer To Home, reportedly paying $100,000 for a huge billboard in New York City's Times Square. That album was certified multi-platinum despite the lack of critical approval. After Closer To Home, Live Album was also released in 1970, Survival and E Pluribus Funk, both released in 1971, followed. E Pluribus Funk celebrated the Shea Stadium show with a die-cut depiction of the stadium on the back of the album cover. In late 1971, the band started having issues with Knight's managerial style, and handling of the band's finances. Early in 1972 Grand Funk Railroad fired Knight; Knight sued for breach of contract, resulting in a protracted legal battle, at one point repossessing the band's gear before a gig at Madison Square Garden.\n\nIn 1996, the three original members of Grand Funk Railroad reunited once more, playing to 250,000 people in 14 shows during a three month period. In 1997, the band did three sold out Bosnian benefit concerts with a full symphony orchestra, conducted by Paul Shaffer (from the David Letterman Late Show) and released a live two-disc benefit CD called Bosnia recorded in Auburn Hills, Michigan, featuring Peter Frampton, who joined them on stage.\n\nThe newest incarnation of Grand Funk Railroad plays around 30 concerts per year. Current members include Max Carl on lead vocals, Don Brewer on drums, lead vocals , Bruce Kulick on guitars, Timothy \"Tim\" Cashion on keyboards, Mel Schacher on bass guitar, and Craig Frost on keyboards. 'Artist Discography'\n\nGram Parsons - (November 5, 1946 – September 19, 1973) was an American singer, songwriter, guitarist and pianist. Parsons was a member of the International Submarine Band, The Byrds and The Flying Burrito Brothers. He was later a solo artist who recorded and performed duets with Emmylou Harris. Parsons died of a drug overdose at the age of 26 in a hotel room in Joshua Tree, California. Since his death, his influential songwriting has been attributed to the birth of 1970s country rock and the early 1990s alt-country movement. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked him #87 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. 'Artist Discography'\n\nThe Grateful Dead - was an American rock band formed in 1965 in the San Francisco Bay Area. The band was known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of rock, folk, bluegrass, blues, reggae, country, jazz, psychedelia, space rock and gospel—and for live performances of long musical improvisation. \"Their music,\" writes Lenny Kaye, \"touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists.\" The fans of the Grateful Dead, some of whom followed the band from concert to concert for years, are known as \"Deadheads\"; they are renowned for their dedication to the band's music. Many fans referred to the band simply as \"the Dead\". As of 2003, the remaining band members who had been touring under the name \"The Other Ones\" changed their official group name to \"The Dead\". Deadheads continue to use that nickname to refer to all versions of the band. The Grateful Dead's musical influences varied widely; in concert recordings or on record albums one can hear psychedelic rock, blues, rock and roll, country-western, bluegrass, country-rock, and improvisational jazz. These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead \"the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world.\"\n\nThe Grateful Dead began their career in Menlo Park, California, playing live shows at Kepler's Books. They began as The Warlocks, a group formed in early 1964 from the remnants of a Palo Alto jug band called Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions. But as another band was already recording under the \"Warlocks\" name, the band had to change its name. The Warlocks were originally managed by Hank Harrison, but Harrison went back to graduate school. After meeting their new manager Rock Scully, they moved to the Haight-Ashbury section of San Francisco. Bands from this area became known for the San Francisco Sound; groups such as Jefferson Airplane, Quicksilver Messenger Service, Big Brother & the Holding Company, and Santana went on to national fame, giving San Francisco an image as a center for the hippie counterculture of the era. The founding members of the Grateful Dead were: banjo and guitar player Jerry Garcia, guitarist Bob Weir, bluesman organist Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan, the classically trained Phil Lesh and jazzist drummer Bill Kreutzmann. The Grateful Dead most embodied \"all the elements of the San Francisco scene and came, therefore, to represent the counterculture to the rest of the country\". 'Artist Discography'\n\nHarry Nilsson - (June 15, 1941 – January 15, 1994) was an American songwriter, singer, pianist, and guitarist who achieved the height of his fame during the 1960s and 1970s. For most of his recordings, he did not use his first name, and was credited only as Nilsson. Despite some significant critical and commercial successes, including two Grammy Awards and two Top 10 singles, Nilsson's tendency to make broad stylistic jumps from one record to the next - coupled with his generally iconoclastic decision-making - kept him from capitalizing on his career. Among Nilsson's best-known recordings are \"Without You\", \"Jump Into the Fire\", \"Everybody's Talkin\"\n\nNilsson signed with RCA Victor in 1966 and released an album the following year, Pandemonium Shadow Show, which was a critical (if not commercial) success. Music industry insiders were impressed both with the songwriting and with Nilsson's pure-toned, multi-octave vocals. Nilsson's next album, Harry (1969), was his first to hit the charts, and also provided a Top 40 single with \"I Guess the Lord Must Be in New York City\" . Later that year, Nilsson went to England with producer Richard Perry to record what became the most successful album of his career. Nilsson Schmilsson yielded three very stylistically different hit singles. The first was a cover of Badfinger's song \"Without You\" (by Pete Ham and Tom Evans), featuring a highly emotional arrangement and soaring vocals to match, a performance that was rewarded with Nilsson's second Grammy Award. Nilsson's disregard for commercialism in favor of artistic satisfaction casued his remaining recording output to recieve limited success. 'Artist Discography'\n\nHot Tuna - is an American blues-rock band, formed by bassist Jack Casady and guitarist Jorma Kaukonen as a spin-off of Jefferson Airplane. They play acoustic and electric versions of original and traditional blues songs. Hot Tuna began by opening Jefferson Airplane concerts, giving Kaukonen and Casady an opportunity to explore their love of traditional blues music. As Jefferson Airplane slowly wound down in the early 1970s, Hot Tuna -- for whom live performance was always of prime importance -- became an independent group. Their early repertoire was derived mainly from American country blues artists such as Rev. Gary Davis, Jelly Roll Morton, Bo Carter and Arthur Blake (Blind Blake). Originally a duo, Casady and Kaukonen added Will Scarlett on harmonica and released a live album in 1970, Hot Tuna. This album was recorded in the fall of 1969 at the New Orleans House in Berkeley and is affectionately known by Tunaphiles as the \"breaking glass album\", because of the sound of breaking beer glasses during the recording of \"Uncle Sam Blues\". This LP was followed by a long series of well received albums that played mostly to a small but devoted cult following. Aside from the six year breakup after 1978, Hot Tuna have continued to perform to the present day, and still performs much of the aforementioned country blues repertoire with which they began. 'Artist Discography'\n\nHumble Pie - was a rock, rhythm and blues band from England and were one of the first supergroups of the 1970s. The original band line-up featured Steve Marriott (former lead singer, songwriter and lead guitarist of Small Faces), Peter Frampton (former lead singer and guitarist of The Herd), Greg Ridley (former bass guitarist of Spooky Tooth) and seventeen-year-old drummer Jerry Shirley. Although successful in America, as a band, they remained much loved in Britain. They are best remembered for their dynamic live concert performances in the early 1970s and songs such as \"30 Days in the Hole\" and \"I Don't Need No Doctor\". In late 1968, Frampton was eager to escape The Herd, as well as his teeny-bopper image. The young guitar prodigy played on a Small Faces recording session in France that year and had become close friends with Marriott, who himself was becoming frustrated with creative restrictions. The Small Faces' frontman suggested a drummer for Frampton — Shirley, whom he'd known for several years, most notably through his work with the mod band Apostolic Intervention. Nothing really came of the project, though, until New Year's Eve 1968. Marriott walked offstage during a disastrous Small Faces gig, rang Frampton at his home later that night and asked if he and Ridley could join his new band. Humble Pie was born. 'Artist Discography'\n\nIron Butterfly - is an American psychedelic rock and early heavy metal band, well known for their 1968 hit \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\". They are considered an early heavy metal band as a result of this song and others like it, as well as the title of their debut album, Heavy (which was actually an often used slang term for things of a thoughtful manner, or 'far out', and had little to do with the term heavy metal). Their heyday was the late 1960s, but the band has been reincarnated several times with various members. VH1 ranks them as number 19 on their list of top 100 \"one-hit\" wonders. In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida is the 31st best-selling album in the world, selling more than 25 million copies.\n\nThe band was formed in 1966 in San Diego and released their debut album, Heavy, in 1968, after signing a deal with ATCO, an Atlantic Records subsidiary. The original members were Doug Ingle (vocals, keyboards), Jack Pinney (drums), Greg Willis (bass), and Danny Weis (guitar). They were soon joined by singer/frontman Darryl DeLoach.\n\nThe 17-minute \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\", the title track of their second album, became a Top Thirty hit in the US. (Doug Ingle is reported to have said the title was an alcohol-slurred version of \"In the Garden of Eden\" ) The members when In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida was recorded were Doug Ingle (keyboards and vocals), Lee Dorman (bass guitar), Ron Bushy (drums), and 17-year-old Erik Brann, also Braunn (guitar). Iron Butterfly is reportedly working on a new album that should be released in 2008. 'Artist Discography'\n\nJanis Joplin - Janis Lyn Joplin was born January 19, 1943 and died October 4, 1970. Joplin was born at St. Mary's Hospital in Port Arthur, Texas. The daughter of Seth Joplin, a worker of Texaco, she had two younger siblings, Michael and Laura. She grew up listening to blues musicians such as Bessie Smith, Odetta, and Big Mama Thornton and singing in the local choir. Joplin graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School in Port Arthur in 1960 and went to college at the University of Texas in Austin, though she never completed a degree. It was at Thomas Jefferson High that she started listening to and singing blues with her friends. Joplin styled herself in part after her female blues heroines, and in part after the beat poets. She joined Big Brother and The Holding Company in 1966,a band that was gaining some popularity with the Haight Ashbury crowd.. The band signed a deal with independent Mainstream Records and recorded an album in 1967. However, the lack of success of their early singles led to the album being withheld until after their subsequent success. The band's big break came with their performance at the Monterey Pop Festival, which included a version of Big Mama Thornton's \"Ball and Chain\". Their 1968 album Cheap Thrills featured more raw emotional performances and together with the Monterey performance, it made Joplin into one of the leading musical stars of the late Sixties.\n\nAfter splitting from Big Brother, she formed a new backup group, modeled on the classic soul revue bands, named the Kozmic Blues Band, which backed her on I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again Mama! (1969: the year she played at Woodstock). The Kozmic Blues Band was indifferently received and soon broke up, and Joplin then formed what was probably her best backing group, Full Tilt Boogie. The result was the posthumously released Pearl (1971). It became the biggest selling album of her short career and featured her biggest hit single, the definitive cover version of Kris Kristofferson's \"Me and Bobby McGee\", as well as the a capella \"Mercedes-Benz\", written by Joplin and beat poet Michael McClure. 'Artist Discography'\n\nJefferson Airplane - was an American rock band formed in San Francisco in 1965. A pioneer of the psychedelic rock movement, Jefferson Airplane saw commercial and critical success. Throughout the late 1960s Jefferson Airplane was one of the most sought-after (and highly-paid) concert acts in the world. Their records sold in great quantities, and they scored two US Top 10 hit singles and a string of Top 20 albums. Their 1967 record Surrealistic Pillow is still widely regarded as one of the key recordings of not only the Summer of Love but the late 1960s.Successor bands to Jefferson Airplane include Jefferson Starship and Starship while spinoffs include Hot Tuna and KBC Band. Jefferson Airplane was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996.\n\nThe group's founder was singer Marty Balin met folk musician Paul Kantner at another local club, the Drinking Gourd. After Balin recruited Kantner, the two set about selecting other musicians to form the house band at the Matrix. After Balin heard female vocalist Signe Toly Anderson at the Drinking Gourd, he invited her to be the group's co-lead singer. Anderson sang with the band for a year, departing in October 1966 after the birth of her first child, to be replaced bt Grace Slick.\n\nSlick, a former model, was already known to the band - she had attended the Airplane's debut gig at the Matrix in 1965 and her previous group, The Great Society, had often supported the Airplane in concert. Slick's recruitment proved pivotal to the Airplane's commercial breakthrough, as she possessed a powerful and supple contralto voice, well-suited to the group's amplified psychedelic music, and, as a former model, her stage presence greatly enhanced the group's live impact.\n\nIn December 1966 Jefferson Airplane was featured in a Newsweek article about the booming San Francisco music scene, one of the first in an avalanche of similar reports that prompted a massive influx of young people to the city and contributed to the commercialization and exploitation of the hippie culture. The group's second LP, Surrealistic Pillow, recorded in Los Angeles with producer Rick Jarrard in only thirteen days at a cost of $8000, launched the Airplane to international fame. The band's third LP, After Bathing at Baxter's, was released on November 27th, 1967 and eventually peaked in the charts at #17. Its famous cover, drawn by renowned artist and cartoonist Ron Cobb depicts a Heath Robinson-inspired flying machine soaring about the chaos of American commercial culture. Baxter's also marked the end of the Airplane's brief run of success on the singles chart. 'Artist Discography'\n\nJethro Tull - is a British rock group formed in 1967-1968. Their music is characterized by the songs, vocals and flute work of Ian Anderson, who has led the band since its founding, and guitarist Martin Barre, who has been with the band since 1969. Initially playing blues rock with an experimental flavour, they incorporated elements of classical, folk and 'ethnic' musics, jazz and art rock into their music. The band have sold more than 60 million albums worldwide. Ian Anderson's first band, started in 1963 in Blackpool, were known as The Blades. By 1966, they had developed into a seven-piece white soul band called the John Evan Band (later the John Evan Smash), named for pianist/drummer John Evans. At this point, Barriemore Barlow was the band's drummer, as he would later be for Jethro Tull.\n\nThey released their first album This Was in 1968. In addition to music written by Anderson and Abrahams the album included the traditional \"Cat's Squirrel\", which highlighted Abraham's blues-rock style. The Rahsaan Roland Kirk-penned jazz piece \"Serenade to a Cuckoo\" gave Anderson a showcase for his growing talents on the flute, an instrument which he started learning to play only half a year before the release of the album. The overall sound of the group at this time was described in the Record Mirror by Anderson in 1968 as \"a sort of progressive blues with a bit of jazz\"\n\nFollowing this album, Abrahams left after a falling out with Anderson and formed his own band, and after auditions for a replacement guitarist in December 1968, Anderson chose Martin Barre.\n\nTheir 2008 tour, celebrated 40 years of the band, included many older songs as well as guest appearances from former band members and others. 'Artist Discography'\n\nJimi Hendrix - (November 27, 1942 – September 18, 1970) was an American guitarist, singer and songwriter. Hendrix is considered one of the greatest and most influential guitarists in rock music history. After initial success in Europe, he achieved fame in the USA following his 1967 performance at the Monterey Pop Festival. Later, Hendrix headlined the iconic 1969 Woodstock Festival. Hendrix helped develop the technique of guitar feedback with overdriven amplifiers. He was influenced by blues artists such as B.B. King, Muddy Waters, Albert King, and Elmore James, rhythm and blues and soul guitarists Curtis Mayfield, Steve Cropper, as well as by some modern jazz.\n\nHendrix won many of the most prestigious rock music awards in his lifetime, and has been posthumously awarded many more, including being inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. An English Heritage \"Blue plaque\" was erected in his name on his former residence at Brook Street, London, in September 1997. A star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (at 6627 Hollywood Blvd.) was dedicated in 1994. In 2006, his debut US album, Are You Experienced, was inducted into the United States National Recording Registry, and Rolling Stone named Hendrix the top guitarist on its list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time in 2003.\n\nThe first Jimi Hendrix Experience album, Are You Experienced, was released in the United Kingdom on May 12, 1967 and shortly thereafter internationally, outside of USA and Canada. It contained none of the previously released (outside USA and Canada) singles or their B sides (\"Hey Joe/Stone Free\", \"Purple Haze/51st Anniversary\" and \"The Wind Cries Mary/Highway Chile\"). Only The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band prevented Are You Experienced from reaching No. 1 on the UK charts. At this time, the Experience extensively toured the United Kingdom and parts of Europe. This allowed Hendrix to develop his stage presence, which reached a high point on March 31, 1967, when, booked to appear as one of the opening acts on the Walker Brothers farewell tour, he set his guitar on fire at the end of his first performance, as a publicity stunt. This guitar has now been identified as the \"Zappa guitar\" (previously thought to have been from Miami), which has been partly refurbished. Later, as part of this press promotion campaign, there were articles about Rank Theatre management warning him to \"tone down\" his \"suggestive\" stage act, with Chandler stating that the group would not compromise regardless. On June 4, 1967, the Experience played their last show in England, at London's Saville Theatre, before heading off to America.\n\nAlthough very popular internationally at this time, the Experience had yet to crack America, his first single there having failed to sell. Their chance came when Paul McCartney recommended the group to the organizers of the Monterey International Pop Festival. This proved to be a great opportunity for Hendrix, not only because of the large audience present at the event, but also because of the many journalists covering the event that wrote about him. The performances were filmed by D. A. Pennebaker and later shown in some movie theaters around the country in early 1969 as the concert documentary Monterey Pop, which immortalized Hendrix's iconic burning and smashing of his guitar at the finale of his performance. 'Artist Discography'\n\nKansas - is an American progressive rock band which became a popular arena rock group in the 1970s, with hit singles such as \"Carry On Wayward Son\" and \"Dust in the Wind\". They have remained a classic rock radio staple and a popular touring act in North America and Europe. The debut album, Kansas (#174), which was released in March 1974, showcased Kansas' signature mix of guitars, keyboards, vocals, and Steinhardt's violin style, which merged American-style boogie-rock with complex, symphonic arrangements and changing time signatures. Their sound bore the marks of late-1960s, early 1970s progressive rock, such as Genesis and Emerson, Lake, and Palmer. Promotion by Kirshner and touring behind the debut album and its two follow ups, Song for America (#57) and Masque (#70), increased awareness of Kansas. On the strength of their 1977 hit single \"Carry On Wayward Son\" (#11) the band's fourth album, Leftoverture (#5), released in October 1976, on which Steinhardt added viola and Walsh added vibraphone to their work, was a hit which garnered a lot of airplay on the burgeoning AOR radio format. The follow up Point of Know Return (#4), released in October 1977, featured the title track (#28) and \"Dust in the Wind\" (#6), both hit singles. Both albums had unique album covers, with Leftoverture featuring a DaVinci-like old man on the cover, and Point of Know Return depicting a ship teetering over the edge of the world. Both albums have sold over 4 million copies in the U.S. alone. Both \"Carry On Wayward Son\" and \"Dust in the Wind\" were certified Gold singles, selling over one million units each. 'Artist Discography'\n\nKing Crimson - is an English progressive rock band founded by guitarist Robert Fripp and drummer Michael Giles in 1969. They have typically been categorized as a foundational progressive rock group, although they incorporate diverse influences ranging from jazz, classical and experimental music to psychedelic, New Wave, hard rock, gamelan and folk music. King Crimson have garnered little radio or music video airplay, but gained a large cult following. Their debut album, In the Court of the Crimson King, is widely regarded as a landmark in progressive rock. Their later excursions into even more unconventional territory have been influential on many contemporary musical artists.\n\nThroughout the early-1970s, King Crimson's membership fluctuated as the band explored elements of jazz and funk. Today, its early music seems to owe a lot to the compositional frameworks of jazz innovators, like Charles Mingus. As the band developed an improvisational sound influenced by hard rock, the band's personnel became more stable in the mid-1970s, before breaking up in 1974. The band re-formed in 1981 for three years, influenced by New Wave and gamelan music, before breaking up again for around a decade. Following their 1994 reunion, King Crimson blended aspects of their 1980s and 1970s sound with influences from more recent musical genres, a synthesis which has continued into the 21st century.\n\nKing Crimson's membership has fluctuated considerably throughout their existence, with eighteen musicians and two lyricists passing through the ranks as full band members. Fripp, the only constant member of King Crimson, has arranged several distinct lineups, but has stated that he does not necessarily consider himself the band's leader. He describes King Crimson as \"a way of doing things\", and notes that he never originally intended to be seen as the head of the group.\n\nWhat differentiates King Crimson's approach from most other jazz and rock groups is that Crimson's improvisation avoids the notion of one soloist at a time taking centre stage while the rest of the band lays back and plays along with established rhythm and chord changes. Rather, King Crimson improvisation is a group affair, a kind of organic music-making process in which each member of the band is able to make creative decisions and contributions as the music is being played. Individual soloing is largely eschewed; each musician is to listen to each other and to the group sound, to be able to react creatively within the group dynamic. David Cross described the process in this manner: \"We're so different from each other that one night someone in the band will play something that the rest of us have never heard before and you just have to listen for a second. Then you react to his statement, usually in a different way than they would expect. It's the improvisation that makes the group amazing for me. You know, taking chances. There is no format really in which we fall into. We discover things while improvising and if they're really basically good ideas we try and work them in as new numbers, all the while keeping the improvisation thing alive and continually expanding.\" With this approach, Fripp stresses the \"magic\" metaphor; to him, when group improvisation of this sort really clicks, it is white magic. 'Artist Discography'\n\nLed Zeppelin - is an English rock band formed in 1968 by Jimmy Page (guitar), Robert Plant (vocals), John Paul Jones (bass guitar, keyboards) and John Bonham (drums). With their heavy, guitar-driven sound, Led Zeppelin are regarded as one of the first heavy metal bands. However, the band's individualistic style draws from many sources and transcends any one genre. Their rock-infused interpretation of the blues and folk genres also incorporated rockabilly, reggae, soul, funk, classical, Celtic, Indian, Arabic, pop, Latin and country. The band did not release the popular songs from their albums as singles in the UK, as they preferred to develop the concept of album-oriented rock. Almost 30 years after disbanding following Bonham's death in 1980, the band continue to be held in high regard for their artistic achievements, commercial success and broad influence. The band have sold more than 300 million albums worldwide, including 111.5 million sales in the United States and they have had all of their original studio albums reach the U.S. Billboard Top 10, with six reaching the number one spot. Led Zeppelin are ranked #1 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. Rolling Stone magazine has described Led Zeppelin as \"the heaviest band of all time\" and \"the biggest band of the 70s\". On 10 December 2007 the surviving members of Led Zeppelin reunited (along with deceased drummer John Bonham's son Jason) for the Ahmet Ertegün Tribute Concert at The O2 Arena in London.\n\nWith their first album not yet released, the band made their live debut under the name \"Led Zeppelin\" at the University of Surrey, Guildford on 25 October 1968. This was followed by a US concert debut on 26 December 1968 (when promoter Barry Fey added them to a bill in Denver, Colorado) before moving on to the west coast for dates in Los Angeles, San Francisco and other cities. Led Zeppelin's debut album was released on 12 January 1969, during their first US tour. The album's blend of blues, folk and eastern influences with distorted amplification made it one of the pivotal records in the creation of heavy metal music. However, Plant has commented that it is unfair for people to typecast the band as heavy metal, since about a third of their music was acoustic. 'Artist Discography'\n\nLynyrd Skynyrd - is an American Southern rock band. The band became prominent in the Southern United States in 1973, and rose to worldwide recognition before several members, including lead vocalist and primary songwriter Ronnie Van Zant, died in a plane crash in 1977 five miles northeast of Gillsburg, Mississippi. A tribute band of the same name was formed in 1987 for a reunion tour with Johnny Van Zant, Ronnie's younger brother, at the helm, and continues to record music today. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 13, 2006. In 1972 the band was discovered by musician, songwriter, and producer Al Kooper of Blood, Sweat, and Tears, who had attended one of their shows at a club in Atlanta. They changed the spelling of their name to \"Lynyrd Skynyrd\", and Kooper signed them to MCA Records, producing their first album the following year. 1973's (pronounced 'lĕh-'nérd 'skin-'nérd) featured the hit song \"Free Bird\", which received national airplay, eventually reaching #19 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts, and is still considered a Rock and Roll anthem today.\n\nOn Thursday, October 20, 1977, just three days after the release of Street Survivors, and five shows into their most successful headlining tour to date, Lynyrd Skynyrd's chartered Convair 240 developed mechanical difficulties near the end of their flight from Greenville, South Carolina to LSU in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Though the pilots attempted an emergency landing on a small airstrip, the plane ran out of fuel and crashed in a forest near Gillsburg, Mississippi. Ronnie Van Zant, Steve Gaines, Cassie Gaines, assistant road manager Dean Kilpatrick, pilot Walter McCreary and co-pilot William Gray were all killed on impact.\n\nLynyrd Skynyrd disbanded after the tragedy (although the surviving members, plus Judy Van Zant and Teresa Gaines, reunited to perform an instrumental version of \"Free Bird\" at Charlie Daniels' Volunteer Jam in January 1979). Following the crash and the ensuing press, Street Survivors became the band's second platinum album and reached #5 on the U.S. album chart. The single \"What's Your Name\" reached #13 on the single airplay charts in January of 1978. The original cover sleeve for Street Survivors had featured a photograph of the band, particularly Steve Gaines, engulfed in flames. Out of respect for the deceased (and at the request of Teresa Gaines, Steve's widow), MCA Records withdrew the original cover and replaced it with a similar image of the band against a simple black background . Thirty years later, for the deluxe CD version of Street Survivors, the original \"flames\" cover was restored.\n\nIn 1987, Lynyrd Skynyrd reunited for a full-scale tour with crash survivors Gary Rossington, Billy Powell, Leon Wilkeson and Artimus Pyle and former guitarist Ed King. Ronnie Van Zant's younger brother, Johnny, took over as the new lead singer and primary songwriter. continue after the 1987 tribute tour caused legal problems for the survivors, as Judy Van Zant Jenness and Teresa Gaines Rapp (widows of Ronnie and Steve, respectively) sued the others for violating an agreement made shortly after the plane crash, stating that they would not \"exploit\" the Skynyrd name for profit. As part of the settlement, Jenness and Rapp collect nearly 30% of the band's touring revenues (representing the shares their husbands would have earned had they lived), and hold a proviso which forces any band touring as \"Lynyrd Skynyrd\" to contain at least two members of the pre-crash lineup. Since Collins and Wilkeson are now dead, Ed King unable to tour due to ongoing heart problems, and Pyle on the outs with the others and facing his own legal problems, that leaves Gary Rossington and Billy Powell as the Skynyrd standard-bearers. 'Artist Discography'\n\nMoby Grape - is an American rock group from the 1960s, known for having all five members contribute to singing and songwriting and that collectively merged elements of folk music, blues, country, and jazz together with rock and psychedelic music. Due to the strength of their debut album, several critics consider Moby Grape to be the best rock band to emerge from the San Francisco music scene in the late sixties. The group continues to perform occasionally. As described by Jeff Tamarkin, \"The Grape's saga is one of squandered potential, absurdly misguided decisions, bad-luck, blunders and excruciating heartbreak, all set to the tune of some of the greatest rock and roll ever to emerge from San Francisco. Moby Grape could have had it all, but they ended up with nothing, and less.\n\nThe group was formed in late 1966 in San Francisco, at the initiation of Skip Spence and Matthew Katz. The band name, judicially determined to have been chosen by Bob Mosley and Skip Spence, came from the punch line of the joke \"What's big and purple and lives in the ocean?\n\nWhile Jerry Miller was the principal lead guitarist, three guitarists played lead at various points, often playing off against each other, in a guitar form associated with Moby Grape as \"crosstalk\". The other major band at the time with a three guitar setup was Buffalo Springfield. Moby Grape's music has been described by Geoffrey Parr as follows: \"Probably the most unique thing about Moby Grape was their guitar playing. No rock and roll group has been able to use a guitar trio as effectively as Moby Grape did on Moby Grape. Spence played a distinctive rhythm guitar that really sticks out throughout the album. Lewis, meanwhile, was a very good guitar player overall and was excellent at finger picking, as is evident in several songs. And then there is Miller. ...The way they crafted their parts and played together on Moby Grape is like nothing else I've ever heard in my life. The guitars are like a collage of sound that makes perfect sense.\"\n\nMoby Grape is an example of a talented band that, through a combination of mismanagement and inexperience, unfortunately never fully realized its potential. Moby Grape's success was significantly impeded by decades-long legal disputes with their former manager, Matthew Katz. Legal difficulties originated shortly after the group's formation, when Matthew Katz insisted that an additional provision be added to his management contract, giving him ownership of the group name. At the time, various group members were indebted to Katz, who had been paying for apartments and various living costs prior to the group releasing its first album. Despite objecting, group members signed, based in part on an impression that there would be no further financial support from Katz unless they did so. Neil Young, then of Buffalo Springfield, was in the room at the time, and kept his head down, playing his guitar, and saying nothing. According to Peter Lewis, \"I think Neil knew, even then, that was the end. We had bought into this process that we should have known better than to buy into.\" The dispute with Katz became more acute after the group members' rights to their songs, as well as their own name, were signed away in 1973, in a settlement made without their knowledge between Katz and Moby Grape's then manager (and former producer), David Rubinson. It was also a settlement made at a time when Bob Mosley and Skip Spence were generally recognized as being legally incapacitated from the effects of schizophrenia.\n\nMoby Grape's success was significantly impeded by decades-long legal disputes with their former manager, Matthew Katz.

This settlement from 1973 meant that the group members would receive no royalties whatsoever from the well-regarded Vintage: The Best of Moby Grape, which Sony had released as part of its Legacy Records series in 1993 . At the time of the commencement of the lawsuit, Bob Mosley had been homeless in San Diego since the early 1990s, while Skip Spence was living in a residential care facility in northern California. Production of the Vintage collection soon ceased. In 2006, after three decades of court battles, the band finally won back its name. .\n\nIn September 2007, a reunited Moby Grape performed for over 40,000 fans at the Summer of Love 40th Anniversary Celebration in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. In October 2007, Sundazed Records reissued the Grape's first five albums (with bonus tracks) on CD and vinyl . The following month, the label was forced to both withdraw and recall Moby Grape, Wow and Grape Jam from print on both vinyl and CD because of a new lawsuit by former manager Katz. Sundazed stated on their website that they were directed to withdraw the three titles by Sony BMG (inheritors of the band's original label, Columbia), from whom Sundazed had licensed the recordings. These developments have resulted in a particular emotional setback for Bob Mosley.\n\nIn 1994, the group members commenced an action against Matthew Katz, Sony Music Entertainment and CBS Records (Sony being the successor corporation to Columbia Records), seeking to have the settlement overturned.

'Artist Discography'\n\nThe Monkees - were a pop singing quartet assembled in Los Angeles in 1965 for the American television series The Monkees, which aired from 1965 to 1968. The primary members were Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork, who were the public face of a music production system under the supervision of Don Kirshner. At the start, the band members provided vocals, and were given some performing and production opportunities, but they eventually fought for and earned the right to collectively supervise all musical output under the band's name. The group undertook several concert tours, allowing an opportunity to perform as a live band as well as on the TV series. When the show was cancelled in 1968, the band continued releasing records until 1971. In the 1980s, the television show and music experienced a revival, which led to a series of reunion tours, and new records featuring various incarnations of the band's lineup.\n\nIn assigning instruments for purposes of the television show, a dilemma arose as none of the four was an actual drummer. Both Nesmith, a guitarist, and Tork, who could play several stringed and keyboard instruments, declined to give the drum set a try. Jones tested well initially as a novice drummer, but the camera could barely capture him behind the drums due to his short stature. Thus, Dolenz was assigned to become the drummer. Tork taught Dolenz his first few beats on the drums and the producers hired him a teacher.\n\nCritics of the Monkees observed that they were simply the \"prefab four\", a made-for-TV knockoff of the Beatles, but the Beatles took it in stride, and made the Monkees welcome when they visited England. John Lennon publicly compared the Monkees' humor to The Marx Brothers. George Harrison praised their self-produced musical attempts, saying \"When they get it all sorted out, they might turn out to be the best\" (Peter Tork was later one of the musicians on Harrison's Wonderwall Music, playing Paul McCartney's five-string banjo).During the time when the Beatles were recording Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, the Monkees were in England and met the Beatles at a party and Nesmith attended the \"A Day in the Life\" sessions at Abbey Road Studios; he can be seen in the Beatles' home movies, including one scene where he is conversing with Lennon. Dolenz was also in the studio during a session, which he mentioned while broadcasting for WCBS-FM in New York (incidentally, he interviewed Starr on his program). McCartney can be seen in the 2002 concert film Back in the U.S. singing the \"(Theme from) The Monkees\" while backstage.\n\nBrushed off by critics during their heyday as manufactured and lacking talent, The Monkees experienced a critical and commercial rehabilitation two decades later. A Monkees TV show marathon (\"Pleasant Valley Sunday\") was broadcast on 23 February 1986 on the video music channel MTV. In February and March, Tork and Jones played together in Australia. Then, starting in May, Dolenz, Jones, and Tork made a \"20th Anniversary Tour.\" MTV promotion resurrected a smaller version of Monkeemania, and tour dates grew from smaller to larger venues. 'Artist Discography'\n\nThe Paul Butterfield Blues Band - (December 17, 1942 – May 4, 1987) was an American blues harmonica player and singer, and one of the earliest white proponents of the Chicago originated electric blues style. The impact on the course of rock and roll by the Butterfield Blues Band with the release of their first album, The Paul Butterfield Blues Band, and the song \"Born In Chicago\" in particular, was pivotal. They, along with British acts The Rolling Stones, The Animals, The Yardbirds, John Mayall's Bluesbreakers and others, including Butterfield's main competitor in Chicago, singer/harp player Charlie Musselwhite, helped introduce young white America to the blues, influencing hundreds of bands from the Grateful Dead to the Allman Brothers, and launched the brief reign of Mike Bloomfield as America's most influential rock guitarist.\n\nThe son of an affluent lawyer, Paul Butterfield was born and raised in Chicago's Hyde Park neighborhood. After studying classical flute as a teenager, he developed a love for the blues harmonica, and hooked up with white, blues-loving, "
