        "text": "This is a band I knew nothing about going in but I have a new respect for them now. I didn’t think I knew any of their songs…but I have heard this one. When I pick these bands that I’m learning about I usually pick a radio-friendly song to introduce them. After listening to their songs…there are songs I like a little more but this one is great and I’ve heard it somewhere at some point. It’s a cool song.\n\nQuicksilver Messenger Service was formed in 1965 and quickly rose to prominence alongside peers like Jefferson Airplane, Moby Grape, and Grateful Dead. With their melodies, guitar work, and some experimentation, Quicksilver became synonymous with the psychedelic scene. The members included John Cipollina on guitar, Gary Duncan on guitar, Greg Elmore on drums, David Freiberg on bass, and Jim Murray on guitar and harmonica…it also included the famous British session player Nicky Hopkins at one time. In 1970 it included Dino Valenti.\n\nTheir history is confusing because I get different stories as I read on. One of the members and possibly the founding member was Chester William Powers, Jr. He was known as Chet Powers and his stage name was Dino Valenti. But we are not done…as a songwriter he was known as Jesse Oris Farrow. He wrote the very popular “Get Together” made famous by The Youngbloods in 1967. He and Gary Duncan wrote this song…Fresh Air.\n\nIt seems that Cipollina and Duncan helped form the band with Dino Valenti in 1964-65. Valenti was busted for pot and amphetamine possession right after and sold his rights to Get Together for a legal defense. He spent time in jail until 1968. When he got out he made a solo album and even opened up for Jimi Hendrix at the Fillmore West. He would finally join Quicksilver in late 1969 or early 1970.\n\nFresh Air was released as a single in 1970 and also appeared on their album Just for Love. The album peaked at #27 on the Billboard Album Charts and #49 on the Billboard 100. Dino Valenti does the lead vocals on this song. They were a popular band because 4 of their album were in the top 30 of the Billboard Album Charts.\n\nThere is much more history to this band than I have of course. I will post another one by them shortly and expand on some of their history.\n\nThe band is still going with David Freiberg.\n\nDavid Freiberg on the name: “Originally there were four Virgos in the band, and one Gemini. Of the four Virgos, there were only two birthdays: John and I were born on August 24, and Gary and Greg were born on September 4…. The ruling planet for Virgo in astrology is Mercury, and it is for Gemini also. So in searching for a name, we said, ‘Well, let’s see – mercury’s the same as quicksilver, right? Mercury’s the messenger god? Quicksilver Messenger Service.’”\n\nJohn Cipollina: It was Valenti who organized the group. I can remember everything Dino said. “We were all going to have wireless guitars. We were going to have leather jackets made with hooks that we could hook these wireless instruments right into. And we were gonna have these chicks, backup rhythm sections that were gonna dress like American Indians with real short little dresses on and they were gonna have tambourines and the clappers in the tambourines were going to be silver coins.” And I’m sitting there going, ‘This guy is gonna happen and we’re gonna set the world on its ear.’\n\nGary Duncan: That’s the story Cipollina told everybody. But according to Dino, that wasn’t the case at all. When he’d been looking for a band, he’d talked to Cipollina, and everybody somehow put two and two together. He actually lived with us when he got out of prison, and while we played some music together and wrote songs, he had no interest in playing in Quicksilver; he wanted to start his own career. Well, when his own career didn’t do so well, he had more interest in playing in Quicksilver!\n\nFresh Air\n\nOh, what you do to me\n\nOh, what you do to me, little girl\n\nOh, have another hit of sweet air\n\nOh, have another hit\n\nI want to know where you going\n\nI want to know, sweet mama, where you gonna go?\n\nOh, have another hit of fresh air\n\nOh, have another hit\n\nOh, baby what you gonna do?\n\nI what to know what you gonna do sweet thing?\n\nOh, have another hit of sweet love in the morning\n\nOh, have another hit\n\nI love you, yes I do\n\nI love you, god knows I do\n\nOh, have another hit of sweet California sunshine\n\nOh, have another hit"
