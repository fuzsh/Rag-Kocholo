Jerry Miller, founding member of the popular ‘60s band Moby Grape, has died. He was 81.

The guitarist died Saturday night in Tacoma, Washington. News of Miller’s death was first reported by journalist Eric Brenner.

A cause of death has not been reported.

Miller was lead guitarist for Moby Grape, a band he formed alongside drummer Don Stevenson, bassist Bob Mosely and guitarists Peter Lewis and Skip Spence in 1966 in San Francisco. The band released its self-titled debut album in 1967.

Moby Grape gained notoriety for its unique mixture of psychedelic rock, pop and country music. Its best known for hits like “Omaha,” “Hey Grandma,” “I Am Not Willing” and “Never Again (Sweet Ride).”

The band released five albums before splitting up in 1969 after ongoing ownership disputes with a former manager over the band’s name. Band members reunited in various ways, and under various names, for decades following the split.

Miller went on to join The Rhythm Dukes, perform with musicians like Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton and B.B. King, and start his own self-titled band.

The musician rang in his 81st birthday with a performance in his hometown of Tacoma just earlier this month.
