        "text": "Faceless Killers by Henning Mankell\n\n1. Faceless Killers (1991)\n\nOne frozen January morning at 5am, Wallander responds to what he believes is a routine call out. When he reaches the isolated farmhouse he discovers a bloodbath. An old man has been tortured and beaten to death, his wife lies barely alive beside his shattered body, both victims of a violence beyond reason. The woman supplies Wallander with his only clue: the perpetrators may have been foreign. When this is leaked to the press, it unleashes a tide of racism.\n\nWallander’s life is a shambles. His wife has left him, his daughter refuses to speak to him, and even his ageing father barely tolerates him. He works tirelessly, eats badly, and drinks his nights away. But now Wallander must forget his troubles and throw himself into a battle against time and against mounting racial hatred.\n\nThe Dogs of Riga by Henning Mankell\n\n2. The Dogs of Riga (1992)\n\nSweden, winter, 1991. Wallander and his team receive an anonymous tip-off. A few days later a life raft is washed up on a beach. In it are two men, dressed in expensive suits, shot dead. The dead men were criminals, victims of what seems to have been a gangland hit. But what appears to be an open-and-shut case soon takes on a far more sinister aspect. Wallander travels across the Baltic Sea, to Riga in Latvia, where he is plunged into a frozen, alien world of police surveillance, scarcely veiled threats and lies.\n\nDoomed always to be one step behind the shadowy figures he pursues, only Wallander’s obstinate desire to see that justice is done brings the truth to light.\n\nThe White Lioness by Henning Mankell\n\n3. The White Lioness (1993)\n\nIn 1992, in Southern Sweden, Louise Akerblom, an estate agent and pillar of the Methodist church, disappears. There is no explanation and no motive. Wallander and his team are called in to investigate.\n\nWallander has a gut feeling that the victim will never be found alive, but has no idea how far he will have to go in search of the killer. In South Africa, Nelson Mandela has made his long walk to freedom, setting in train the country’s painful journey towards the end of the apartheid. Wallander and his colleagues find themselves caught up in a complex web involving renegade members of South Africa’s secret service and a former KGB agent, all of whom are set upon halting Mandela’s rise to power. Faced with an increasingly globalised world in which international terrorism knows no national borders, Wallander must prevent a hideous crime that means to dam the tide of history.\n\nThe Man Who Smiled by Henning Mankell\n\n4. The Man Who Smiled (1994)\n\nSpiralling into an alcohol-fuelled depression after killing a man in the line of duty, Wallander has made up his mind to quit the police force for good. When an old acquaintance seeks Wallander’s help to investigate the suspicious circumstances in which his father has died, Kurt doesn’t want to know. But when his former friend turns up dead, shot three times, Wallander realises that he was wrong not to listen.\n\nAgainst his better judgment, he returns to work to head what may now have become a double murder case. An enigmatic big-business tycoon seems to be the common denominator in the two deaths. But while Wallander is on the trail of the killer, somebody is on the trail of Wallander, and closing in fast…\n\nSidetracked by Henning Mankell\n\n5. Sidetracked (1995)\n\nMidsummer approaches and Wallander prepares for a holiday with the new woman in his life, hopeful that his wayward daughter and his ageing father will cope without him.\n\nBut his restful summer plans are thrown into disarray when a teenage girl commits suicide before his eyes, and a former minister of justice is butchered in the first of a series of apparently motiveless murders. Wallander’s desperate hunt for the girl’s identity and his furious pursuit of a killer who scalps his victims will throw him and those he loves most into mortal danger.\n\nThe Fifth Woman by Henning Mankell\n\n6. The Fifth Woman (1997)\n\nFour nuns and a fifth woman are killed in a savage night-time attack in Africa. A year later, Inspector Kurt Wallander invesigates the disappearance of an elderly birdwatcher and discovers a gruesome and meticulously planned murder – a body impaled in a trap of sharpened bamboo poles. Then, another man is reported missing.\n\nOnce again Wallander’s life is put on hold as he and his team work tirelessly to find a link between the series of vicious murders.\n\nOne Step Behind by Henning Mankell\n\n7. One Step Behind (1997)\n\nIt is Midsummer’s Eve. Three young friends meet in a wood to act out an elaborate masque. But, unknown to them, they are being watched. Each is killed by a single bullet.\n\nSoon afterwards, one of Wallander’s colleagues is found murdered. Is it the same killer, and what could the connection be? In this investigation, Wallander is always, tantalisingly, one step behind.\n\nFirewall by Henning Mankell\n\n8. Firewall (1998)\n\nStopping to use a cash machine one evening, a man falls to the ground dead. A taxi driver is brutally murdered by two teenage girls – one of whom escapes police custody and disappears without trace. Soon afterwards, a blackout covers half the country. When an engineer arrives at the malfunctioning power station, he makes a grisly discovery…\n\nWallander is sure that these events must be linked – somehow. Hampered by the discovery of betrayals in his own team, lonely and frustrated, Wallander begins to lose conviction in his role as a detective. And somehow these criminals always know the police’s next move.\n\nBefore the Frost by Henning Mankell\n\n9. Before the Frost (2004)\n\nThe leader of a religious cult in Guyana instigates a mass suicide. He succeeds in killing himself and his whole flock of worshippers, save one.\n\nIn a wood outside Ystad, the police make an horrific discovery: a severed head, and hands locked together in an attitude of prayer. A Bible lies at the victim’s side, handwritten corrections and amendments on every page.\n\nA string of incidents, including attacks on domestic animals, has been taking place and Inspector Wallander fears that these events could be the prelude to attacks on humans on a much greater scale. Meanwhile Linda Wallander, preparing to join the Ystad police force, arrives at the station. Showing all the hallmarks of her father – the maverick approach, the flaring temper – she becomes involved in the case and in the process is forced to confront a group of extremists bent on punishing the world’s sinners.\n\nThe Troubled Man by Henning Mankell\n\n10. The Troubled Man (2011)\n\nEvery morning Håkan von Enke takes a walk in the forest near his apartment in Stockholm. Then, one day he fails to come home. Wallander is not officially involved but Håkan’s son is engaged to his daughter Linda. A few months earlier Håkan was eager to talk to Kurt about a controversial incident from his past. Could this be connected to his disappearance?\n\nWhen Håkan’s wife also goes missing, Wallander is determined to uncover the truth, but the investigation will force him to look back over his own past as he comes to the unsettling realisation that even those we love the most can remain strangers to us…\n\nThe Pyramid by Henning Mankell\n\nThe Pyramid (2008)\n\nWhen Wallander first appeared in Faceless Killers, he was a senior police officer, just turned forty, with his life in a mess. His wife had left him, his father barely acknowledged him; he ate badly and drank alone at night.\n\nThe Pyramid chronicles the events that led him to such a place. We see him on his very first case, new to the police force and trying to solve a murder off-duty; we witness the beginnings of his fragile relationship with Mona, the woman he has his heart set on marrying; we learn the reason behind his difficulties with his father. These tales give fascinating insights into Wallander’s character, from the stabbing of a neighbour in 1969 to a light aircraft accident in 1989, every story is a vital piece of the Wallander series, showing Mankell at the top of his game.\n\nAn Event in Autumn by Henning Mankell\n\nAn Event in Autumn (2014)\n\nWallander’s life looks like it has taken a turn for the better when his offer on a new house is accepted, only for him to uncover something unexpected in the garden – the skeleton of a middle-aged woman.\n\nAs police officers comb the property, Wallander attempts to get his new life back on course by finding the woman’s killer with the aid of his daughter, Linda. But when another discovery is made in the garden, Wallander is forced to delve further back into the area’s past."
