        "text": "This children's historical fiction story (ages 9-15) based at Wheatland, Lancaster, Pa., home of President James Buchanan (fifteenth U.S. President), follows three fifteen-year-old super sleuths as they discover why a letter written to President Buchanan in 1868 was never delivered. When artifacts disappear from the Wheatland mansion, the amateur detectives are invited to investigate the thefts. Is there a connection between the missing items and James Buchanan's letter? Secret doors and ghostly noises are usually not part of the Wheatland tours. Why now? Book #14 in the \"Sammy & Brian Mystery\" series. (120pp. Gaslight Pub., 2002.)"
