One has to learn to distinguish between them, or one is lost.\n\n― The Dogs of Riga (1992)\n\nTo grow up is to wonder about things; to be grown up is to slowly forget the things you wondered about as a child.\n\n― When the Snow Fell (2007)\n\nPeople always leave traces. No person is without a shadow.\n\n― The Troubled Man (2009)\n\nMany people make the mistake of confusing information with knowledge. They are not the same thing. Knowledge involves the interpretation of information. Knowledge involves listening.\n\n― The Art of Listening, a piece he wrote for the New York Times in 2011\n\nDreams can be of value even if you don’t have an opportunity to turn them into reality.\n\n― The Troubled Man (2009)\n\nLife is a flimsy branch over an abyss.\n\n― Italian Shoes (2006)\n\nThe truth changes all the time.\n\n― The Man from Beijing (2010)\n\nNew ideas are always resisted.\n\n― The Man from Beijing (2010)"
