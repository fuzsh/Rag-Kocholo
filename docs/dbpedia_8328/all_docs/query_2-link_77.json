I think they're pretty good.\n\nI use to, at least the classics like Sherlock Holmes. I should probably read something by Mankell, if not only because I live in the same country, but I have lost the will to read crime or general fiction.\n\nMoridin said:\n\nI use to, at least the classics like Sherlock Holmes.
