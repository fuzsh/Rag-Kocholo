        "text": "Two-term governor of Tennessee Bill Haslam, and devoted friend of Young Life, reveals how faith--too often divisive and contentious--can be a redemptive and unifying presence in the public square.\n\nAs a former mayor and governor, Bill Haslam has long been at the center of politics and policy on local, state, and federal levels. And he has consistently been guided by his faith, which influenced his actions on issues ranging from capital punishment to pardons, health care to abortion, welfare to free college tuition. Yet the place of faith in public life has been hotly debated since our nation's founding, and the relationship of church and state remains contentious to this day--and for good reason. Too often, Bill Haslam argues, Christians end up shaping their faith to fit their politics rather than forming their politics to their faith. They seem to forget their calling is to be used by God in service of others rather than to use God to reach their own desires and ends.\n\nFaithful Presence calls for a different way. Drawing upon his years of public service, Haslam casts a remarkable vision for the redemptive role of faith in politics while examining some of the most complex issues of our time, including:\n\npartisanship in our divided era;\n\nthe most essential character trait for a public servant;\n\nhow we cannot escape \"legislating morality\";\n\nthe answer to perpetual outrage; and\n\nhow to think about the separation of church and state.\n\nFor Christians ready to be salt and light, as well as for those of a different faith or no faith at all, Faithful Presenceargues that faith can be a redemptive, healing presence in the public square--as it must be, if our nation is to flourish.\n\nRead a short excerpt here:\n\nThe images are as jarring in hindsight as they were on that day. The US Capitol under siege by protesters. Windows smashed. A woman fatally shot. Demonstrators climbing on statues in the rotunda. Members of Congress huddled under their desks. A protester dangling from the balcony above the Senate floor across the inscription Annuit Coeptis (meaning “[God] has favored our undertakings”).\n\nOn that same day, the country set a new record for deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic. This followed a summer of racial unrest, social justice protests, and a bitterly contested presidential election.\n\nThe entire country seems to be at each other’s throats. Republicans are convinced that Democrats are socialists and them winning elections will mean the end of our country. Democrats are convinced that Republicans are racist with no concern for those the Bible calls “the least of these.” Activists on the left and the right are convinced that only they represent “We the people” and vow to take back their government from the politicians.\n\nThe words of Isaiah ring true almost three thousand years later: “Justice is turned back, and righteousness stands far away; for truth has stumbled in the public squares, and uprightness cannot enter” (59:14).\n\nHow did we get here? And, more importantly, where do we go from here? If “truth has stumbled in the public squares,” do we just give up on the public square as a place to solve problems? Having served as a mayor and a governor, I know the limitations of government and the wisdom of the psalmist’s advice to “put not your trust in princes” (Psalm 146:3). But I also know that it matters who we elect, and it matters even more what they do and how they act after they are elected. Like we teach our children: decisions have consequences. Who we put in office and how we support those people make even more of a difference than I thought before I was in office.\n\nPolitics is the way that groups make decisions on how they will govern themselves so they can live together, whether it be your neighborhood association, a middle school student council, or a country. Like every other noble calling, politics can easily be twisted into a passionate pursuit of our own political success instead of a desire to serve. At its best, politics can be about wise, selfless decisions that mean better lives for people.\n\nUnfortunately, it is far too common for politicians on both sides to play to the frustration and outrage of the voters they seek. Real leadership, however, is about connecting the legitimate problems facing those voters with the difficult reality of governing—and actually working to solve those problems.\n\nWhile there is hope for solving a pandemic with a vaccine, there is no vaccine for the contemptuous polarization that grips us today. As the American experiment faces its greatest test since the Civil War, what can we, elected officials and concerned citizens, do to be faithful in such a time as this?\n\nA Simple Way YOU Can Leave a Legacy\n\nLet’s talk about death, shall we?\n\nUh oh, we’re about to get really morbid!\n\nWe know. We KNOW.\n\nIt’s not fun to think about dying. And, it’s even worse to think about the legal “stuff” you should do to protect your assets.\n\nBUT, here’s the cool part…\n\nDid you know there are thousands of people who have written Young Life into their wills and trusts?\n\nThey’ve chosen to donate a portion of their assets back to Young Life and that giving actually goes a long way to providing for the future of Young Life. These folks are part of “Club 37!” It is simply our group of friends who want the work of Young Life to continue even after they are “promoted.”\n\nWhen you give to the Young Life Foundation, you are truly building a legacy that lives well beyond your own years.\n\nWhy “37?”\n\nAmong our founder’s many skills was his ability to understand his audience. When Young Life club became Jim Rayburn’s primary vehicle for gathering young people and sharing the Gospel, he understood that kids may not want to come to something that was brand new, untested with the “crowd.” So he decided to call that first club, “Club 37” so that kids might feel like this was something well established and worth their participation.\n\nMore than eight decades later, millions of “kids” have now grown to maturity and Young Life has grown into all 50 states and more than 100 countries. This growth, in part, has been fueled by the generosity of so many people whose lives have been changed by their experiences with Jesus through Young Life. And for thousands of those people, they have chosen to invest in the mission by including Young Life in their will/trust or other end of life plans.\n\nIf you would like to be included in this group or have questions about how you can keep Young Life going beyond your own lifetime, then let us know. We can be reached by phone at 800-813-1945 or by email at YLFoundation@sc.younglife.org or online at www.younglifefoundation.org.\n\nWhat’s on Newt Crenshaw’s Bookshelf?\n\nGet a glimpse into Young Life President, Newt Crenshaw’s, bookshelf and see what he’s been reading lately. Maybe you’ll get some inspiration for your own next great read!\n\nFrom Newt:\n\nFirst, I’ve been reading through the Bible chronologically with my wife, Susan. It has been good and a blessing to be in the word daily, and to be given passages to read that I might not select on my own. I have profited by being in front of the biblical text and asking the basic discovery bible study questions, then waiting on the Holy Spirit’s conviction, teaching and movement. We are also just finishing up a study of the book of Daniel with our “adult Campaigners group” – powerful, difficult, and influential.\n\nHere are a number of books that I have read over the past year or so that have had an impact on me:\n\nIn the areas of health and science, I enjoyed and benefited from Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity by Peter Attia, a medical doctor who studies and practices longevity. He discusses many aspects of living a long, healthy life with some obvious and not-so-obvious recommendations. I also found Dasha Kiper’s Travelers to Unimaginable Land: Stories of Dementia, the Caregiver, and the Human Brain to be a poignant and powerful read.\n\nIn the area of spiritual formation, God has been teaching me many things from three books, two of which we read as a part of the Good Way (way to go, Good Way Team!): New Seeds of Contemplation by Thomas Merton, Invitation to a Journey by Robert Mulholland, and Interior Freedom by Jacques Philippe.\n\nIn theology and philosophy, I have been deeply challenged by: The Theology of Migration by Dan Groody, How to Inhabit Time by James KA Smith, and My Bright Abyss by Christian Wiman.\n\nOn leadership, I found Janet O Hagberg’s Real Power: Stages of Personal Power in Organizations to be both prophetic and prescriptive for the challenges we face as leaders today.\n\nFor biographies, I laughed, cried, and mourned as I read Phillip Yancy’s relatable and vulnerable memoir, Where the Light Fell.\n\nIn fiction, I tend to read the classics and went back for a second time to Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy – a “must read” among the great books. I also have been reading more modern fiction, and an amazing and challenging novel by Nobel laureate in literature and Norwegian author, Jon Fosse, called Septology, is worth the time and effort.\n\nFinally, in poetry, I picked up African American Poetry: 250 Years of Struggle, edited by Kevin Young, while at the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, AL while on a civil rights tour with the mission lead team a couple of years ago. Reading poets like Phyllis Wheatley and Langston Hughes moved me in new ways. I also regularly have Collected Poems: 1909-1962 by T.S. Eliot as a traveling companion, a treasured book given to me by a friend and fellow Eliot admirer.\n\nAs I told my children while raising them, reading is the window to the world!\n\nMisunderstood, but full of joy! Our Capernaum students are an opportunity to experience joy and love. They live without abandon, but are often misunderstood because of their disabilities. Meet Tess (video below), a Capernaum student and a bright light to all she meets. Students like her are looking for a place to belong, have friends, and learn about God’s love.\n\nIn Luke 14 it says, “Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame. Sir, the servant said, what you ordered has been done, but there is still room. Then go out to the roads and country lanes and bring them in that my house may be full.”\n\nThis is the heart of Young Life Capernaum, that our leaders around the globe would go out into the streets and alleys, the barrios and the penthouses, the villages, and the cities to find teenagers with disabilities. We want to know their names. We want to invite them to our tables. We want to journey with them and share with them about how the God of the Universe is madly in love with them.\n\nSince 1986, we’ve been intentionally creating spaces for students with disabilities to learn and experience God’s love in the context of Young Life fun. That means camping too! The video above gives just a glimpse of what these special weeks look like.\n\nTeenagers with disabilities are found in communities around the globe, making up close to 15% of the teen population. Many are experiencing great isolation and rarely see friends or engage in social activities outside of school. Close to one third of families impacted by disability leave the church because their child was not welcomed or included.\n\nWe know that as our friends get involved with Young Life Capernaum, they will experience authentic friendship, growth, and purpose. As that happens, they will experience the deep love of Jesus and have opportunities to grow in their faith. Many will go on to grow in leadership and have a powerful impact on their communities.\n\nThe passage above reminds us that Jesus was constantly bringing marginalized people together, that they may know him and that He may transform everyone’s understanding of community. The same thing is happening in Young Life, and it starts with us knowing their names.\n\nWe’ve heard countless stories of how our students have been impacted by Capernaum ministries, but we also know that the impact is mutual, changing the hearts of parents, peer buddies, volunteers, and staff.\n\nVenture capitalists look for big ROI’s (Return On Investment). Financial planners offer strategies to lead to healthy growing portfolios. We all like to know that our relationships matter. I have alway been struck by the value that you receive by investing in local Young Life. The number of volunteer leaders, investing countless hours with students, engaging, connecting and discipling. It's hard to put a price on something so priceless.\n\nThere is one ‘product’ of the YL mission that is not hard to count. Consider how $2.50 (the cost of one Bible for a student at Young Life summer camp this summer) can make a huge impact in the lives of young people today, AND lead to ongoing impact for years to come.\n\nAlex, an Area Director in South Carolina, was thrilled for Matthew who had come alive in Christ at Carolina Point. Alex had the honor and privilege to present a Bible to Matthew at camp that summer. Even though this happens hundreds of times at Young Life camps all across the U.S., Alex was thrilled to give Matthew his first Bible. As a junior, Matthew had the potential to make a significant impact on his school in the coming year and Alex knew it was critical to help Matthew begin to read the Bible.\n\nAs the school year began that August, Matthew began praying for Peyton, a freshman at his high school. He wanted Peyton to know Jesus personally, and experience His life and love. Each week….\n\nMatthew invited Peyton to club\n\npicked him up, and\n\ndrove him home\n\nA few months later, Matthew invited Peyton to summer camp at Windy Gap. Peyton was a little unsure because he had sport conditioning workouts and other summer commitments. With faithfulness, courage and persistence Matthew asked Peyton’s mom about Windy Gap and told her, “He needs to come.” Matthew promised it would be the best week ever. Peyton decided to go! Prayers answered.\n\nThey arrived at camp and as the week went on Peyton was having the time of his life but wasn’t so sure about the whole “Jesus thing.” He had doubts and questions and didn’t know where to begin. Matthew became a little disheartened but kept praying. At the end of the week, several YL leaders shared their own story of faith and Matthew noticed that Peyton had tears in his eyes. As they talked Peyton confessed, “I want to meet this Jesus that everyone talks about.”\n\nMatthew prayed with Peyton in the club room that day to begin his relationship with Jesus. Now it was Matthew’s turn to give a Bible to his young friend.\n\nToday, Alex is still on Young Life staff and Matthew has also joined the Young Life staff. After graduating high school, Peyton joined the Marines and has continued in his faith.\n\nThe gift of a Bible has the potential for a ripple effect of eternal proportions. Alex experienced the joy that Young Life leaders and staff pray for - the joy of sharing God’s Word with their young friends. For Alex, the joy was magnified as he witnessed Matthew grow in his faith through investing his life in Peyton’s. The ripple effect may be more accurately termed a seismic impact. Alex giving Matthew a Bible changed Matthew’s life and Peyton’s life for eternity.\n\nWould you consider how you might play an active part in starting ripple effects that result in seismic impact? Click below to contribute to help raise the remaining $86,000 for Bibles to distribute at U.S. Young Life camps this summer! For those who give over $1000, we will send a copy of this summer's Young Life Summer Devotional. EVERY GIFT RECEIVED BETWEEN JUNE 20, 2024 - JUNE 21, 2024 WILL BE MATCHED UP TO $10,000!\n\nOur Metaphors Matter\n\nMetaphors have a way of holding the most truth in the least amount of space. (Orson Scott Card)\n\nIf you want to change the world, you have to change the metaphor. (Joseph Campbell)\n\nMetaphor – “A figure of speech in which a word or phrase is applied to an object or action to which it is not literally applicable.”\n\nIn her July, 2020 article, The Words that Help us Understand the World, Hélène Schumacher states that “aside from injecting color and imagery into language, metaphors serve a functional purpose; they can explain complex concepts we may not be familiar with, help us to connect with each other, and can even shape our thought processes. They help us better understand our world.” Furthermore, I would argue that metaphors have the ability to not only reveal a narrative, or world view, but also influence it and the roles we see ourselves and others playing within it. In the words of Parker J. Palmer, in Let Your Life Speak, “Metaphors are more than literary devices… Animated by the imagination, one of the most vital powers that we possess, our metaphors often become reality, transmuting themselves from language into the living of our lives.” (p. 96)\n\nAn example of this can be seen through Leadership Foundations’ understanding of “city as playground.” An organization that has historical roots in Young Life, both in its commitment to an incarnational approach and through it’s early and present day leaders (Former Young Life staff, Reid Carpenter and David Hillis to name just two), it is committed to, in the words of Zechariah 8:4-5, to see cities as places where “Once again men and women of ripe old age will sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each of them with cane in hand because of their age. The city streets will be filled with boys and girls playing there.”\n\nLeadership Foundations chooses to not embrace the metaphor of “city as battleground.” Rather, the ramifications of “city as playground” and the narrative that follows are significant; theologically, socially and economically. Theologically, God is seen as a friend of the city rather than a foe. Socially, neighbors are seen as colleagues rather than competitors. Instead of seeking (or avoiding) an enemy and fighting a battle, this metaphor aligns people as human beings, at times facing bullies; but together in their humanity and heart for their city. Economically, “city as playground” moves the narrative from scarcity to abundance, and provides space for not only individuals, but churches, businesses and other institutions to influence the vibrant, creative, life-giving opportunities of a city. Finally, “city as playground” is an effort to allow people of good faith and people of good will to partner for a city’s best. To understand “common grace,” to live out the incarnation and recognize God’s movement in all and through all.\n\nAs we consider the prevalence and power of metaphors, we can look to the Bible. For example, in Matthew 5:13, Jesus is quoted as saying, “You are the salt of the earth.” Then again, in 5:14, he says, “You are the light of the world.” In John 15:5, Jesus says, “I am the vine, you are the branches.” All of these metaphors serve to communicate truth, and each of them influence the paradigm or narrative we live in and the roles we play.\n\nConsider for a moment the metaphors that we are surrounded with… What might they tell us about our narratives? How might they influence the way we see our roles and those of others? Consider the church… Is it a club with members who pay dues, an army with soldiers, or a body with many parts? How about Young Life? What metaphor might you use to describe our eighty-three-year-old mission? I have heard some refer to it as a family; others, a body. What do you think? Finally, how about teenagers? Are they tornadoes or hurricanes, wreaking havoc wherever they go? Are they untrained horses or dogs pulling at the leash, as some have been known to suggest? Are they a “white paper,” taking on any impression? Or, perhaps they are clay; malleable, full of potential.\n\nWhat do you think? Do our metaphors matter? How might you answer some of the above questions? I’d love to hear from you at jschultz@sc.younglife.org .\n\nIf you would like to learn more about Leadership Foundations, “City as Playground,” you can find a recent publication featuring the writings of various authors here.\n\nWritten by: Jonathan Schultz – Sr. Director, Young Life Community Network\n\nDid you know that over 50% of Jesus teaching was done in an outdoor setting? Jesus intentionally and masterfully utilized being outside to create teachable moments for his audience. Whether talking about seeds, fields, birds, flowers, or fruit, Jesus regularly captured the attention and imagination of his listeners by pointing them to the ways God’s creation speaks truth about His Kingdom.\n\nSo—did you know that Young Life Adventures models our communication with campers after Jesus’ way of teaching?\n\nAdventure camps exist primarily for the second part of Young Life’s mission statement: “Introduce adolescents to Jesus and help them grow in their faith.” Each adventure camp differs in its programatic approach and experiences it offers campers. But what adventure camps have in common is intentional crafting of content designed to help teenagers deepen their relationships with Jesus, often by utilizing the environment or experience to point to truth about God.\n\nYoung Life Adventure camps provide the perfect next camp experience for a teenager who has attended a week of outreach camp and is ready to learn more about their new relationship with Jesus. Through smaller camp sizes, high relational impact occurs, and leaders are equipped to help their students gain greater understanding of how to live life centered on God. And through outdoor experiences, whether hiking, kayaking, surfing, or doing service projects, we intentionally create conversations and space to process the teachable moments that occur each day.\n\nCountless examples of experiential teaching happen each week at every Adventure camp location. For example, at Adventures Baja, campers learn about following Jesus for life as they engage in service projects like building a house for a family, cooking a meal and playing with children at an orphanage, and helping with community service projects. When a camper sees a cement slab foundation, learns to swing a hammer to frame walls, and watches a house begin to take shape, conversation naturally occurs around what we build our lives upon. Just like Jesus taught about the importance of building our house (life) on the rock in Matthew 7:24-27, campers get the tangible experience of building an actual home on a firm foundation so it will last for the family whom will receive it.\n\nWhen a teenager returns home from a week in Baja, they will always remember being a part of building a house, with hopes that this experience will continue to speak into the foundation of their life forever.\n\nWhether biking on a single track trail and talking about the narrow way that leads to life, hiking up a mountain with a heavy pack and discussing what it means to give our burdens to Jesus, or simply listening to the birds and remembering that we are “worth more than many sparrows”, taking adolescents outside to encounter Jesus is woven into the fabric of adventure camping.\n\nTo learn more, check out https://adventures.younglife.org/ and consider a week at a Young Life Adventure camp next summer!\n\nIn 1972, two men sat around a campfire nestled in the San Juan Mountains of southwest Colorado. The first man, Will Wyatt, owned the property; the second, Bob Mitchell, was a senior leader – and future president – of Young Life. They agreed upon a plan to use that very space – lake, cabins and land – as a base for backpacking trips and adventure camping for teenagers looking to grow deeper in their faith.\n\nWhat they couldn’t envision, however, was how the Lord would take this simple idea and make Wilderness Ranch a place of transformative ministry for thousands of kids over the next 50 years.\n\nMore than just a week in the mountains, Wilderness Ranch has come to represent a space of spiritual awakening, community, vulnerability, fragility and growth. Stripped of their distractions and defenses, kids and adults alike practice “challenge by choice” – learning the art of stillness, reflection, determination, grit and surrender. This special place helps them lean in to meaningful and intentional relationships.\n\nFor five decades Will and Betty Wyatt’s gift has provided Young Life with another way in which to introduce kids to THE Guide. This is the One who invites them further down the trail and higher up the mountain, walking alongside them throughout all the joys and challenges the abundant life offers. By trip’s end these young men and women are different than when they left the trailhead earlier that week. They know the Creator, their guides, their friends, and themselves better – in a way only an experience like this can provide.\n\nThank you, Lord, for all you’ve done here in so many precious lives, and may these transformational moments at Wilderness Ranch continue for years to come.\n\n… Come and see,\n\n… Come worship the Lord with laughter,\n\n… and bring a teenager\n\nDear Young Life,\n\nTwo of my favorite quotes are:\n\n“Laughter is the Holy Spirit.” (Anne LaMott)\n\n“Laughter is the closest to grace.” (Karl Barth)\n\nI love that! Don’t you? 😊\n\nThey both lift up the premise that laughter is serious business in the Young Life mission. I’m so proud that Young Life laughs! Our humor is essential in introducing adolescents to Jesus Christ, and helping them grow in their faith.\n\nIn Young Life, our message is Jesus.\n\nOur method is friendship.\n\nOne of our many strategies is this simple and beautiful endeavor, and calling; humor.\n\nIn the month of April… There is a day we all set aside to take part in a “fool’s day.” We get to focus on the silly, the court jester part of all of us, and the creative ways we might “prank,” or “get” someone.\n\nI don’t think “April Fools Day” is the kind of humor that Young Life is striving for. We should never use humor to “get” anyone. Rather, it is to capture or captivate a teenager to consider the One who created them.\n\nSo, it is imperative we take the 364 other days to be “Fools for Christ.”\n\n“We are fools for the sake of Christ.” (Paul)\n\nWith our humor and laughter, we take kids from…\n\nBoredom to abundance,\n\nFrom darkness to light,\n\nFrom fearful hiding to an appropriate Spot Light.\n\nFrom resistance to curiosity,\n\nFrom a life spent in and around turmoil and trauma, to the best week of their life.\n\nThe beat down get lifted up… the invisible become seen.\n\nWe take kids from death to life with humor, so we must always be careful with it and cherish and nurture it. Laughter in Young Life should never humiliate, degrade, embarrass, or victimize. It should always lead to safety.\n\nWe should stand on the “why” of laughter. We should pray over our delivery of humor before we ever take the stage. Our program directors should pray over every skit, every sketch, camp and club… Everything.\n\nThe “why” of humor in Young Life is grounded in the idea that we are taking, leading, presenting, and placing kids at the feet of Jesus. Many in the world believe that the “why” or reason is just to be funny. May it never be in Young Life. May we lift up the principle that our programs should be… Godly first; fun second and funny third. (In that order and priority.)\n\nI have seen many funny things that were not godly. I have seen many godly things that weren’t that funny… godly is the goal.\n\nIf you can imagine a diamond ring analogy, the diamond is the Gospel message. It is “just Jesus.” Humor and program are the four prongs that lift up, and hold it in place, the beautiful diamond. We lift it to the light so kids can examine its brilliance and experience the amazing love story of Jesus.\n\nOn a practical level, may I lift up what I see as the “3 M’s” of humor in Young Life; Movement, Momentum and Message.\n\nMovement\n\nMovement is giving lots of extravagant things to see. It’s “eye candy” that involves them. It’s crazy adventure. It’s using the entire stage and exaggerating our physical movements. It’s over the top uniforms and costumes.\n\nMomentum\n\nMomentum is constantly keeping in mind that we are taking and leading kids somewhere with our laughter. It’s pointing kids to where we want them to go: the feet of Jesus. We need to keep things moving quickly. Lights and sound; being unprepared can be momentum killers.\n\nMessage\n\nMessage is grasping and praying up the idea that everything a kid sees says something about Christ.\n\nIf someone was to receive a pie in the face at club, how would Jesus do that?\n\nShaving cream, not whip cream.\n\nTowels available on impact.\n\nThe person would know in advance they were gonna be part of something fun.\n\nThere would be cheer for “Let’s hear it for ____!”\n\nIn closing, I lift up to you excerpts from 1 Corinthians 15…\n\n“Behold, I tell you a mystery; we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye… the dead will be raised imperishable and we will be changed.”\n\n“The perishable puts on imperishable.”\n\n“The mortal puts on immortality.”\n\n“Death is swallowed up in victory.”\n\n“Thanks be to God, who give us the victory through Jesus Christ our Lord.”\n\nI have seen this mystery first hand thousands of times in Young Life, especially at camp. You see a kid get off the bus skeptical and resistant. Then, in the twinkling of an eye, you see something different. Perhaps in the middle of a volleyball tournament, square dance, hoe down, ropes course, etc. a kid gets lost in the fun and takes a step towards Jesus.\n\n“The perishable took on imperishable.”\n\n“The mortal took on immortality.”\n\nWe are court jesters for Jesus my fellow “fools for Christ.” Everyday!\n\nHi Ho Away We Go!\n\nWarmly in Him, Ash\n\nWritten by Mike “Ash” Ashburn\n\nMy name is Raquel Moldowan and I am a recent high school graduate. Although I knew I wanted to go to College, through lots of prayer and thought about my future, I decided to take a gap year after graduation. I didn’t want this to be any ordinary gap year of staying home to work or signing up for a gap year program, I wanted one that was curated to my interests. I decided what I wanted to do something with Young Life because Young Life had played a huge role in my life and I wanted to dig deeper into that.\n\nI wanted to explore what a career in Young Life would look like. I had experienced so much of Young Life as a student and saw all of the fun and simplicity looking from the outside in, However, my eyes were opened to the depth and intentionality that happens in Young Life ministry from what I saw on this trip.\n\nHere’s what I ended up doing:\n\nI road-tripped around part of the US, spending around two weeks at a time with different Young Life Areas to see the differences in each areas, what each did well, and ultimately if I wanted to go on staff one day. This three-month adventure was on and I dug deep into the big WHY behind Young Life and spent time in places like Texas, Tennessee, Ohio, and more!\n\nThe Why to the What.\n\nOn this trip, I ultimately learned the importance of knowing your “why” behind anything you’re doing. In Young Life, this is incredibly important, but I saw it in action on this trip. Through prayer, listening to Brian Summerall teach at the TBLC, and talking to many volunteer leaders as well as staff people, I started to understand why we need a why behind our what.\n\nThe WHAT of Campaigners\n\nI spent time at clubs, campaigners, and even camp with the team in Lubbock, TX, but the thing they take the most pride in is contact work, and rightfully so! Between silly conversations at volleyball games and taking pictures on the field of my first ever Texas football game, I started to see that contact work was more than strategies and numbers, it was the answer to the why behind why they do what they do.\n\nYoung Life is for loving kids. These kids need quality time with their leaders, they need big fun events with raffle prizes that don’t make sense to other areas. Why? Because the kids there respond to that. They feel loved and included by that!\n\nThe WHAT of Club\n\nI continued my journey ending my time in Texas and driving through four states in one day to get to Chattanooga, TN. I spent those two weeks, not only meeting some of my now closest friends, but also seeing their Young Life in huge private schools that have boarding students and look more like Hogwarts than anything else as well as public schools and very low-income schools.\n\nAs I explored this different setup, their ‘what’ was the same as every other place I had gone. Their ‘what’ was showing kids Jesus, bringing kids to the feet of Jesus, and loving kids well.\n\nEach school, each place, each kid is different. How are you showing that kid that Jesus meets their needs where they’re at?\n\nThe WHAT of Camp\n\nOn this trip, I had not planned to go to any Young Life camps, just Young Life areas. However, I ended up at not one, not two, not three, but FOUR Young Life Camps. I got to be on work crew at three of those camps and even ended up leading a WyldLife camp trip in Ohio when one of their leaders was too sick to lead.\n\nYou’ve heard it before and you’ll hear it again, Young Life camp is an incredible tool.\n\nI have been blessed by growing up in a place where we have a Young Life property close by. It had never even occurred to me that some Areas are too far from a Young Life property to go to for camp, especially for just a weekend camp. I watched as these middle schoolers enjoyed camp at a property that was definitely not a Young Life property. This challenged my idea of camp and humbled me.\n\nThroughout the weekend, I started to see it: the ‘what’ of camp is different in different places. It might be a Young Life property, it might be a church camp, or it might even be someone’s barn.\n\nCamp may look different but the WHY of it in this case is the same: bringing kids to the feet of Jesus.\n\nThree Months, 4,385 (ish) miles driven, and 72 days later, I am so grateful for the experiences I got, the people I met, and the deeper thinking that sprouted from this trip. I am forever grateful for this experience and am so grateful for what it taught me as a leader and a friend. It taught me to dig deeper.\n\nDon’t just do something just to do it, ask the why behind it. If there is no answer to that question, maybe alter it, change it, or curate it to loving the people around you and showing them Jesus the best you can.\n\nAs a kid, I would often find myself swept up in the adventures that were playing out on the big screen. I imagined that I was Rufio fighting Captain Hook, Henry Rowengartner pitching for the Cubs, or Maximus Aurelius standing before thousands in the Roman Colosseum.\n\nNot only did I love watching movies, I wanted to make them. I was inspired by directors like Steven Spielberg and M. Night Shyamalan. I got my first video camera in the 5th grade and began writing and directing my own short films. While other kids were playing summer league baseball, I was recreating the Sandlot. Somewhere along the way, I realized that any good movie could stir not only your imagination, but your soul.\n\nAt the heart of any worthy film, is a great story, and the greatest filmmakers are some of the most profound storytellers. Every January for the past 46 years, some of these masterful storytellers have gathered together to explore the depths of the human experience through cinematography.\n\nThis past January, I had a front row seat. The Windrider Forum/Sundance Film Festival Experience may be the best kept secret in Young Life. Every January, the YL Community Networks office leads a dozen or so staff, Committee and friends of Young Life out into the mountains of Park City, Utah to attend the renowned festival for independent films.\n\nFor five days we bounced around town attending the premiers of various action films, thrillers, dark comedies, and documentaries. We got a behind the scenes look at filmmaking, sitting at the feet of Oscar winners and Oscar hopefuls, Hollywood stars and no name actors, seasoned directors and first time filmmakers alike.\n\nAt the end of each day, our little Young Life fellowship would gather at a lodge just outside of town, and wade into the shallows of the existential questions being explored by some of the world’s most influential independent filmmakers. By the end of each night, we were all tired. But something had been awakened in me.\n\nMy biggest take-away came from the festival within the festival.\n\nThe Windrider Summit hosts a large group of people of faith from a variety of backgrounds from all over the country, who gather at Sundance to discuss faith and film. Every morning, before embarking on our movie marathon, we would gather in a chapel turned theater to thoughtfully engage culture through a uniquely spiritual lens.\n\nThe summit hosts and awards various filmmakers, both Christian and non-Christian, who are impacting culture through their art. The distinct emphasis of Windrider is on the power of storytelling, through the medium of film. It is that spirit of Windrider that captivated and inspired me.\n\nAs we took the time to engage film through a distinctly theological lens, I was reminded that every film is theological in its nature. Filmmakers are in essence cultural theologians, offering unique perspectives on faith, meaning, redemption, suffering, and the human condition.\n\nA common theme that kept coming up this year was fatherhood. Films like To My Father, We Were Meant To, Super/man: The Christopher Reeve Story, Exhibiting Forgiveness, and Daughters all grapple in their own unique way with the complexities of fatherhood and a father's impact in the lives of their children.\n\nIf the cultural theologians are noticing the importance of fatherhood to the human experience, who better to enter the conversation than Christian filmmakers who are able to communicate the extravagant love of a heavenly father for whom we know the world is searching.\n\nAs Young Life staff, we have been commissioned to communicate the greatest story ever told. Why would we not engage a world longing for hope with one of the most powerful mediums available to us?\n\nI left the Sundance Experience more assured of my calling and more inspired to continue to use film to communicate the transformative power of the gospel through the stories of staff, leaders, kids, and friends of Young Life. In some ways, I’m still that 5th grade kid, discovering over and over again the wonder of making movies. But, now I have a greater purpose and endless stories to tell.\n\nWritten by: Bryan Spillman\n\n___\n\nTHE LAST REPAIR SHOP\n\nThis short film just one an Oscar as was co-directed by two of the artists we met at Windrider (Ben Proudfoot and Kris Bowers)\n\nPOWERFUL QUESTIONS\n\nHow curiosity is more effective than advice\n\nBe honest, would you rather give advice or ask a question?\n\nFor most of us, the answer is that we would much rather give advice! Or at least, that is what we tend to do. Our ultimate aspiration is to become experts in our field and then share our wisdom with others. That being said, it seems most of us are opposed to taking advice. This pattern can be observed in society, in faith, and even within our own families. We are determined individuals who prefer to find our own path rather than follow advice or accept answers from others. Our desires and egos hinder us, and despite the abundance of freely given advice, very little is actually put into practice.\n\nArguably the only person in history qualified to give advice was Jesus. However, as we take a look into the Gospels, we see that Jesus was much more inclined to ask questions than to give answers. Jesus asked 307 questions, 128 of which appear in more than one Gospel, while he only gave 8 answers. JESUS ASKED QUESTIONS NEARLY 40 TIMES MORE OFTEN THAN HE GAVE ANSWERS.\n\nAs we look deeper, we find the most amazing observation — Jesus only directly answered three specific questions:\n\n“Are you the Son of God?” (John 18:37)\n\n“Which is the greatest commandment?” (Matthew. 22 36-37)\n\n“Teach us to pray?” (Luke 11:1)\n\nClearly, Jesus knew it was more effective to ask questions than to give advice. In general, he asked six kinds of questions:\n\nQUESTIONS OF INVITATION: Jesus stopped and called them. “What do you want me to do for you?” he asked. (Matthew 20:32)\n\nQUESTIONS OF IDENTITY: Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, “Who do the crowds say I am?” (Luke 9:18)\n\nQUESTIONS OF INTENT: “What do you think?” (Matthew 21:28)\n\nQUESTIONS OF HEALING/COMPASSION: “Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?” (Matthew 9: 5-8)\n\nQUESTIONS OF LIFE/FAITH: “Are your hearts hardened?” (Mark 8:17)\n\nQUESTIONS OF LOVE: “If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you?” (Luke 6:32 )\n\nBy asking thought-provoking questions, Jesus actively engaged those around him by offending the mind, engaging the heart, and creating meaningful conversations. Most importantly, Jesus asked the questions people wanted to be asked. A well-crafted question can slow down the conversation, change perspective, and challenge one’s thinking. In a society lacking in respectful dialogue, it seems logical to begin with a question that can open up dialogue instead of giving advice that risks shutting it down. It seems to me in a world where civil discourse is in short supply, it makes sense to start with a good question. Voltaire may have been right. “It’s not the answers you give, but the questions you ask.”\n\nThe design of a powerful question can be simple:\n\nSHORT: Seven words or less\n\nOPEN-ENDED: “What, How, Where, and When” more than “Why”\n\nCURIOUS: Come from a place of learning\n\nDISRUPTIVE: Stimulate fresh thinking and self-awareness\n\nWhat is your most profound question? Send it to me and we will share it in the next IN THE KNOW!\n\nWritten by:\n\nKen B. Tank. - SVP, Young Life Community Networks.\n\nWe’ve all read the passage describing the early church and have aspired to be like them to some degree. However, with the current busyness, individualism and transience, I wonder, “Is this even possible today?” However, in my time as a Summer Staff Coordinator, I saw this lifestyle lived out.\n\nDuring one session, my co-workers and I led 12 teachings in 25 days geared towards various topics of scripture: How to Read Your Bible, How to Pray, The Holy Spirit, Hearing God’s Voice, etc. You’d think 12 sessions would be plenty, but they wanted more! These Summer Staffers were on fire for the Lord and hungry for His word! When we weren’t reading scripture, we were talking about scripture (amongst other things!). I found myself hanging out with two lifeguards as they asked questions about the Holy Spirit, shared their own insights with me and told me stories of how they experienced His voice that week. Truly, we were devoted to the teachings of the apostles.\n\nSummer staff is hard and exhausting. You will run out of energy and sin will show its face. It’s scary, but it forces you to be vulnerable and known. I had a very long day of 1on1s and felt completely out of gas. As their supervisor, I tried my best to maintain my composure and be an encouraging presence… But I couldn’t. I was tired and it showed. One student, named Blake, walked up to me while I was sitting by myself and asked, “Hey Ryan, are you okay? You seem exhausted.” I shared with him my exhaustion and he shared with me how much of a blessing I had been for him! It was needed. It’s my tendency to act like I have it together in leadership but Summer Staff won’t allow it… and I am glad it doesn’t. True fellowship can’t be one sided and God helped me see that. Truly, we were devoted to fellowship.\n\nSummer Staff is a beautiful example of God’s intention for mission. Everyone knows their role and works hard towards the common goal of seeing students begin a relationship with Jesus. At the end of each week, Young Life gives campers a moment to declare whether or not they decided to follow Jesus right before they head home. During this time, Summer Staffers take a break from cleaning camp and gather in the dining hall to watch a live feed of this event. During our 25 day session, we saw around 450 students begin a life with Jesus!!! All the hard work paid off! God did something big and He let us in on the action. Truly, the Lord truly added to His numbers daily\n\nDuring my time on Summer Staff, I got to live in a community with students who were dedicated to prayer, the scriptures, each other and had a common mission. What’s even better is we got to see God use our work in big ways. Living life like the early church is hard but it's not impossible. For those looking to try, Summer Staff is a great opportunity to experience it.\n\nWritten by Ryan McSwane\n\nThe History-Making Hot Dog\n\nHow God Uses Camp Food and DGL Scholarships to Change Countries\n\n“The food at Young Life camp was marvelous; I had never eaten a hot dog in my whole life. Experiencing it was history-making for me.”\n\nHot dogs aren’t typically a history-making event. For Sharon Intauno (DGL 2014), it was more than the hot dog … the whole Young Life camp experience was a significant turning point in her life. Sharon recalls the laughter, the fun, the joy she experienced at camp – a welcome relief from grieving the loss of her mother, the only parent she had known, when she was only 11 years old. “To be around a group of people who were so caring, I felt like a child. It was the most amazing time of my life.”\n\nLittle did she know that week at camp what the Lord had planned for her life. Recently named Regional Vice President, Young Life Africa South, Sharon, a 2014 DGL graduate, exemplifies how God can use Young Life’s Developing Global Leaders program to radically change the trajectory of someone’s life.\n\nAs a young teenager, Sharon was thrust into the role of head of the home – cooking, cleaning, and caring for cousins, nieces and nephews in her charge. She worked selling popsicles at a bus stop to help make ends meet and attended school when she could. She did well academically, but struggled to pay her tuition. She confessed, \"When school fees would run out, I would be sent out of class but I would sneak back in so I didn't miss too much.\"\n\nSharon was invited to Young Life when she was in high school and it was there she grew in her Christian faith. \"In spite of the challenges in my life, I had faith that I would one day be the first person in my family to earn a university degree.\"\n\nUpon high school graduation, Sharon was accepted by two colleges. \"Unfortunately, I had no means whatsoever to afford to register for even one semester but that's when I was offered a DGL scholarship and my life changed.\"\n\nThanks to her DGL scholarship, Sharon was able to lead Young Life and attend the University of Zimbabwe where she earned a Bachelor of Science, Development Studies and graduated with honors.\n\nLike nearly one third of DGL graduates, Sharon went directly to full-time Young Life staff; she quickly became an area director and in 2016 pioneered Zimbabwe Young Life College. Eventually she was promoted to Senior Regional Director for Zimbabwe, Eswatini, and South Africa and in 2023 was named Regional Vice President for Young Life Africa South.\n\n\"By God's grace I went on staff ten years ago and I've never looked back.\"\n\nSharon and her husband, Moses, recently had their first child, a daughter. Sharon delights in her roles as wife, mother, leader, friend, and most significantly, a daughter of the King.\n\nThrough sponsorship, Developing Global Leaders (DGL) offers Young Life leaders in the world's poorest developing countries a pathway to a future they never thought possible – the opportunity to attend university in their own country and impact their community with the Gospel. To find out more about DGL and what it takes to sponsor a student go to dgl.younglife.org or reach out to Andy Morman at amorman@intl.younglife.org\n\nWritten by Toni Morse\n\nThe first time I heard the phrase was from my parents. The second time, it was a teacher. Later, crossing guards and others burned it into my memory. The instruction was simple -look both ways before crossing the street. Lastly, I learned the song!\n\n“Look both ways when you cross the street,\n\nLeft and right, what do you see?\n\nIf no cars are coming, you're safe as can be.\n\nLook both ways, look both ways.”\n\n~~ Geof Johnson\n\nThe safety message was to ‘take a moment before you move forward.’ Recently I have considered how valuable it would be to apply this simple principle that we learned as children into my adult life today.\n\nAwareness of your surroundings\n\nPonder the destination you just left as well as where you are headed\n\nNotice the unexpected in the ordinary\n\n“Looking both ways'' is a life lesson that translates. It affirms awareness more than caution. Embedded in the statement is the intent to move forward. A child who is encouraged to look both ways does not intend to stay on the curb, but more so intends to head toward a new destination. As believers, we are people who see, reflect, take note, and change. MOMENTS happen daily and may be forgotten, but MOVEMENTS need to be noticed, acknowledged, and fostered.\n\nThe DAILY EXAMEN is an ancient spiritual practice adopted by the early church and exists in many forms today. Simply it is a prayerful reflection over the events of each day. If there is an element that is distinctive of the ‘Examen’ it may be the PACE. In a world of sound-bytes, video clips, and cultural attention deficit, the Examen is a stroll that moves through the last 24 hours and then slowly crosses into the next day. No moment is too small and if our theology is correct, God is in all of them. In summary, you are looking for God's presence in your past and His direction as you go forward.\n\nAs believers our relationship with Jesus is to be current, dynamic, and noticeable. Our interaction with him should be similar to how we talk with a friend, familiar, safe, and vulnerable. For me, to have a consistent practice that allows me to see God’s hand in my whole life has been invaluable and pivotal to my faith.\n\nMany have developed techniques for a Daily Examen. Saint Ignatius Loyola championed its practice early on and encouraged the Jesuits to practice it 2x a day (noon and the end of the day). He viewed it as a gift from God directly and wanted it shared widely. Below are the simple steps of the Daily Examen and a way that you can look both ways, your past and your future, in a posture of gratitude and sensitivity to Christ.\n\nSETTLE - Become aware of God’s presence. Slow your breathing. Try putting your feet on the floor (get settled). Set aside distractions and be expectant to receive from the Lord. The day could feel chaotic or busy, but ask God to bring clarity as you reflect.\n\nLOOK BACK - Review the day in gratitude. Note the joys, delights, and gifts of the day. Slowly, purposefully, and intentionally, notice the significant and seemingly minor moments of your day (food, sights, people, work, etc). As you reflect on the previous 24 hours, pick one event that stands out to you.\n\nNOTICE - Pay attention to your emotions. Ignatius thought God was easily found in our emotions. What were they? What is God saying through them to you? Not shame, but awareness. Is there a prompt in the midst? Someone to reach out to or contact? Anyone you need to apologize to? Anything bother you? What can you do to take care of it? Has this distracted you from anything? (try to sit and listen)\n\nFOCUS - Choose one feature of the day and pray from it. A vivid moment that could be good or bad. Look at it from all angles. Allow prayer to spring up to it. Praise, petition, lament, intercession, and gratitude.\n\nTOMORROW - Now go forward! What are your feelings about tomorrow? Any changes, convictions, hopes?\n\nAs you look both ways and foster a sensitivity to notice God’s hand in your past and your future, you will understand in a deeper way that “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever” - Hebrews 13:8\n\nA CHALLENGE: If you want to join me in practicing the Examen everyday for a month, together send ME a short email so we can encourage one another!\n\nWritten by Ken Tankersley (kenbtank@gmail.com)"
