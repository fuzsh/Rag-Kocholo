        "text": "With weather variability and extremes impacting the lives of communities and farmers now, many are asking for better ways to adapt to climate change. Farmers, emergency responders and global health workers lack access to effective weather forecasts for impactful decision making. We believe localized weather forecasts and timely, actionable advice is the answer!\n\nPioneering technologies, powered by AI and satellites, are rapidly emerging that could transform weather and early warning systems but they will not reach vulnerable communities without intervention. New partnership models must be explored and systems-level gaps urgently addressed to unlock opportunity for all.\n\n“Anything we can do to help farmers in poor countries with extreme weather – where we are going to have more floods and drought – is the biggest climate adaptation thing we need to do.”"
