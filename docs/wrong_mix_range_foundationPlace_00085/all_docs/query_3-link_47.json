        "text": "In partnership with the City of Tampa, Tampa General Hospital is proud to now offer the TampaWell Community Garden and Food Pharmacy, which serves one of the most food insecure neighborhoods in the city and provides residents with access to nutritious fruits and vegetables, education on healthy nutrition along with support for chronically ill adults and children living in the area.\n\nThe TampaWell Community Garden and Food Pharmacy is a unique gathering place that will nourish the bodies and minds of residents in East Tampa. This initiative aims to increase community members' consumption of fruits and vegetables, increase household food security, reduce healthcare provider usage and associated costs, and reduce instances of diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. The TampaWell Community Garden and Food Pharmacy provides a platform to fight food insecurity and educate current and future generations on the importance of healthy eating on their overall wellbeing.\n\nThe TampaWell Community Garden and Food Pharmacy offers access to nutritious foods for high-risk patients and community members. In partnership with the Feeding Tampa Bay Food Rx Program and the Tampa YMCA Veggie Van Produce Prescription Program, the TampaWell Food Pharmacy helps combat food insecurity in East Tampa by bringing nutrient-rich foods to food-insecure patients – free of charge. Like many lower-income neighborhoods in urban areas everywhere, East Tampa struggles with food sovereignty. Tampa General Hospital’s Specialty Center at Healthpark was chosen as the preferred location for the site for the TampaWell Community Garden and Food Pharmacy given the geographic location, socioeconomic demographics, and high food insecurity of the East Tampa neighborhood. The TGH Specialty Center at Healthpark offers diverse services including Primary Care, Pediatrics, OB/GYN, as well as 24 specialty clinics that support an underserved patient population with many nutrition-related chronic and acute illnesses.\n\nTampaWell Community Garden\n\nThe TampaWell Community Garden is a one-acre teaching garden, adjacent to the Food Pharmacy, which provides hands-on nutrition education and brings fresh, seasonal produce to the East Tampa community. We believe that the combination of a provider prescription, healthy food access, and education and motivation to make changes will translate to valuable health improvements. Many residents in the Tampa Bay area face barriers when it comes to accessing resources for proper nutrition. Ensuring this access is critical to developing and maintaining healthy communities.\n\nThe goals of the TampaWell Community Garden include:\n\nImproving the health of the community\n\nProviding food security to vulnerable residents\n\nCommunity access to nutritious foods\n\nProviding educational and developmental opportunities\n\nEstablishing a space for social change\n\nSupporting obese and chronically ill patients and residents, including adults and children\n\nPlease visit us at 5802 N. 30th Street, Tampa, FL 33610.\n\nTampaWell Food Pharmacy\n\nThe TampaWell Food Pharmacy is a unique gathering place that nourishes the bodies and minds of residents in East Tampa. This initiative aims to increase community members' consumption of fruits and vegetables, increase household food security, reduce healthcare provider usage and associated costs, and reduce instances of diabetes, hypertension, and obesity."
