        "text": "“Serving in the 21st Century” education sessions have, for over a decade, assisted officers and community members to connect with one shared goal as their North Star: protecting life. During these sessions, law enforcement and community members engage in open, honest, raw, and often emotional conversations about the issues that are impacting them, and most importantly, the solutions to those issues.\n\nThe goal of our “Traffic Stop Safety” program is to help ensure that young drivers – and law enforcement - get through traffic stops as safely as possible. By teaching the importance of approaching their traffic encounters with law enforcement with knowledge and heightened awareness, we can help to ensure that what is for many the first (and only) encounter with law enforcement doesn’t end in a traumatic event.\n\nOur student-athlete focused program engages the next generation of leaders in proactive discussions and skills-building centered around areas of justice, relationship-building and goal attainment. It provides principles and tips for building and sustaining healthy relationships through modeling and demonstrating positive ways to engage the university and broader community.\n\nWe believe that community members and the law enforcement professionals who are sworn to serve them are a part of One Community and must view and exist together as one.\n\nOur path to making that happen is to provide concrete steps and tools for bridging existing and future divides by connecting with each other in a deep and positive manner.\n\nOur Tomorrow, Now gifting initiative aims to raise the funds needed to execute more youth-oriented programming. Through tailoring a combination of our programming, we build a 3-part ecosystem designed to drive a deeper understanding of how we can collectively build stronger communities of tomorrow.\n\nOur journey begins with the of foundation our mission: listening, learning and understanding. In each community, we’ll conduct three sessions comprised of law enforcement and three different youth organizations. The goal of these conversations is to lay the foundation of trust that we build upon during Traffic Stop Safety and our D2C Community Tipoff.\n\nAfter the foundation is laid, we focus on building a deeper understanding about one of the most stressful series of moments any of us face - getting pulled over by the police. This class is designed to help spark dialogue around how both officers and community members can best navigate this situation, ensuring that everyone walks away from the interaction with a better understanding and the belief that the engagement was productive.\n\nThe final step is to create a space where community members and law enforcement can come together and work towards a common goal - while having some fun. We’ll team-up officers and community members for a basketball tournament where they can use their collaboration and shared interest to further deepen the connections built during D2C’s Serving in the 21st Century and Traffic Stop Safety education sessions\n\nSince tipping off in 2020, our partnership with the Miami Heat has grown to astronomical heights. Through committed and relentless cross-collaboration, we have taken our collective work from a pilot program for 75 officers to an award-winning initiative that spans beyond the Miami city limits. Highlights include:\n\n2,000+ officers and law enforcement professionals engaged across Miami PD, Miami-Dade PD, Broward County Sherriff's Office and Ft. Lauderdale PD\n\n15+ different law enforcement departments educated with a growing wait list\n\nMultiple South Florida high schools have participated in our courageous conversations by working alongside officers to find the solutions to the issues that divide us\n\nNominated for ESPN Humanitarian of the Year Award\n\nFeatured on “Matter of Fact With Soledad O’Brien”\n\nNBA Values of the Game Award was received by the HEAT’s Michael McCullough and Steve Stowe for the HEAT’s collaborative programming with D2C"
