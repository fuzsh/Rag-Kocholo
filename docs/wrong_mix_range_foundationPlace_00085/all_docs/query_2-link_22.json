        "text": "Sadly, Children Are the New Face of Homelessness in Central Florida!\n\nIn fact, Central Florida (*Seminole County) has the highest per capita population of homeless students in the Nation. These children are not hundreds or thousands of miles away in a far-off country; they are right here in our community. Although our local schools provide free breakfast and lunch, children often go hungry in the evenings, on the weekends, and during the summer break.\n\nImagine going without food from lunch time today until breakfast tomorrow. Now imagine going without food from lunch on Friday until breakfast on Monday. No child should have to go hungry or worry about food!\n\nHow You Can Support Us\n\nSupport from donors ensures that we can fulfill our mission and sustains our ability to provide food to local schools. We appreciate donations in any amount and we encourage you to support us on a recurring basis so that no child or family has to go hungy."
