These citizens play a critical role in cities and towns in all corners of this great state; and\n\nWhereas, This esteemed group of citizens is being honored and recognized for all that they have to offer to the state of Michigan. They are an admirable source of knowledge and inspiration to all the residents of this state; and\n\nWhereas, Older Michiganians are enthusiastic supporters of Michigan's economy, religious institutions, charities, workforce, government institutions and local communities. This group is one of Michigan's greatest resources in celebrating the past and working toward the future. They are an important foundation upon which Michigan can build a better tomorrow; now, therefore, be it\n\nResolved by the House of Representatives, That the members of this legislative body declare June 10, 2010, as Older Michiganians Day in the state of Michigan. It is our hope that on this day all Michiganians will honor the older citizens in their lives and recognize the many contributions they have made to Michigan communities."
