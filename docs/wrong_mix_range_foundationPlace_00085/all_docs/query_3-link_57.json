I just don't have a lot of time to watch it. But you know, I watched a whole game that wasn't even my team! It was the Denver Broncos when they won that astonishing victory over the heavily favored Pittsburgh Steelers in a wild-card playoff game. But I was watching more than a football game; I was watching Tim Tebow and the drama that unfolds every time he takes the field. That game was no exception.\n\nTuesday, February 28, 2012\n\nIf you cannot see the media above - download here: MP3\n\nDownload MP3 (right click to save)\n\nWe raised a son who loves sports, but he also had ability in music. How do you put those two together? A lot of times those two interests don't go together. Well, it was fourth grade when we thought it was time to introduce our son to a musical instrument. And when we talked a little bit about what instrument he'd be interested in, he said, \"Well, maybe the saxophone.\"\n\nTuesday, February 21, 2012\n\nIf you cannot see the media above - download here: MP3\n\nDownload MP3 (right click to save)\n\nYou know, sometimes it seems like there's a growing number of women who are really attractive until they open their mouth. Maybe that's why someone said, \"There are girls you date...\" Remember that? \"...and there are girls you marry.\" Oh, our society stresses beautiful hair, and teeth, and eyes, and clothes, and they think that's all that beauty is to a lot of women. But every once in a while, you meet a woman who's got a quality that really makes her special. It's hard to put a name on it, but she's special. It's kind of like a beach ball I saw the other night. You say the other night? Yeah. Actually you can use this beach ball in the dark. It has a light inside.\n\nMonday, February 20, 2012\n\nIf you cannot see the media above - download here: MP3\n\nDownload MP3 (right click to save)\n\nOne of the amazing frustrations about families is that you just can't get everybody to agree on a comfortable temperature. Sometimes you can't even get a husband and wife to agree on it. One likes the room cozy and warm; the other likes it cool and refreshing, shall we say. It's hard even be in agreement on what is hot and what is cold.\n\nMonday, February 6, 2012\n\nIf you cannot see the media above - download here: MP3\n\nDownload MP3 (right click to save)\n\nOur pre-school grandson? I think he overheard the weather forecast recently before his bedtime. It went something like this, \"Chance of rain, maybe a few snow flurries.\" I guess that's all he needed to hear, because he began to pray fervently that night, \"Jesus, please make it snow tomorrow.\" Now, flurries are barely snow, but apparently the mention of them is enough for fuel for hope, you know, and for faith...especially faith. And when he went to bed that night, his mom and dad...they prayed too. They said, \"Dear Jesus, would you please answer a little boy's prayer?\"\n\nTuesday, January 31, 2012\n\nIf you cannot see the media above - download here: MP3\n\nDownload MP3 (right click to save)\n\nHave you driven past a home or building that's under construction lately? Take a good look, because there are some things that you will never see again, so you'd better look now. Like the foundation for example. You can see it right now while they're building, but pretty soon all you'll see is the house, or the office building, or the condo. The foundation will pretty soon disappear from view. But it's always going to be what's holding up that whole structure. The same is true of the support beams. Pretty soon they're going to be covered with walls, and paint, and wallpaper. But they will always form the invisible support for everything. If the foundation or the support beams go, the whole thing goes.\n\nMonday, January 23, 2012\n\nIf you cannot see the media above - download here: MP3\n\nDownload MP3 (right click to save)\n\nI don't know who invented the credit card, but I'd like to have a very serious talk with him, because I'm not sure he helped any of us by thinking that this plastic \"postponer\" was going to help us. With a credit card you go to the store with $100 in cash, you get what you wanted, and you come out with $100 in your wallet. And it feels like, \"Hey, that didn't cost anything.\" Wrong! Fantasy land! The bill will come...it always does. You postponed the payment, but you didn't cancel it. Oh, and by postponing it, that purchase is actually going to cost you more. I think that's what they call interest. The time lag between what you buy and what you pay can get you into big trouble.\n\nWednesday, January 18, 2012\n\nIf you cannot see the media above - download here: MP3\n\nDownload MP3 (right click to save)\n\nShades of the '60s: lots of angry, discontented young people, occupying public places, trying to call attention to their cause. Haven't we seen this before?\n\nThe '60s demonstrations were about a war, and they turned more violent. The 2011 crowds? Well, they were occupying high-profile public areas like Wall Street, for example, around the world, and with a different cause; claiming that their protest was about jobs, and corporate greed, concentrated wealth, economic injustice. Of course, only time will tell whether this is a game-changer or just a loud blip on the screen.\n\nThursday, January 12, 2012\n\nIf you cannot see the media above - download here: MP3\n\nDownload MP3 (right click to save)\n\nEvery summer we used to take a large delegation to a great youth conference in Ocean City, New Jersey. One of our veteran staff was in charge of that delegation, and it was a big responsibility at the shore. When my son was old enough to go to that conference, he commented on Greg's leadership. He said, \"You know, Greg's really serious.\" Well my wife and I kind of laughed. We said, \"Oh, you should hear some of the crazy things he's done down at Ocean City.\" And then my son said, \"Not any more. He's in charge now.\" Well, my son was making a pretty valid observation. As your authority increases, so does your responsibility. Followers, I guess, can goof off, but leadership; oh, that's serious business.\n\nWednesday, December 28, 2011\n\nIf you cannot see the media above - download here: MP3\n\nDownload MP3 (right click to save)\n\nSo who needs an alarm clock in our neighborhood? We've got ravens! Yeah, those big black birds discovered our backyard. Now, ravens apparently are early risers, a little earlier than most people are. And they are also, shall we say, active conversationalists. Which makes them wonderful alarm clocks for those early morning hours whether you want them or not! Frankly I don't mind it. It's great to have all the birds singing their little spring concert in our yard. Actually, they do more than sing, they preach!"
