        "text": "Acumen and The Rockefeller Foundation are thrilled to announce the 2023 cohort of Food Systems Fellows! In today’s global climate, transforming the future of food is no longer just about tackling food nutrition, sustainability, or equity. It’s about the interconnectedness of many elements – human and animal health, land, water, climate, biodiversity, and the economy – and understanding how these converge to create the food systems we have today and want for a better tomorrow. The 2023 cohort is a global group of emerging system builders who have taken on this challenge. They are tackling a range of food systems issues – from improving farmers’ climate resilience, to bringing digital innovation to regenerative agriculture, to promoting biodiverse diets and food literacy amongst consumers.\n\nRafael Parra-Peña leads projects on food policy at the Sustainable Agriculture Network in Colombia. \"Growing up in Colombia, I saw the challenges my country faces. But I also saw the potential for positive change through sustainable food systems. By understanding the economic forces that shape agriculture and food systems, we can create policies and strategies that drive sustainable growth, productivity, and reduced poverty and inequality.\" Rafaelparra-peña leads projects on food policy at the sustainable agriculture network in Colombia“growing up in ColombiaI saw the challenges my country faces. But I also saw the potential for positive change through sustainable food systems. By understanding the economic forces that shape agriculture and food systems, we can create policies and strategies that drive sustainable growth, productivity, and reduced poverty and inequality.”\n\nDesigned to create system-level impact in food over the long term, The Rockefeller Foundation-Acumen Food Systems Fellowship is a one-year program supporting these system builders — individuals who can see the complexity of food systems, and have the ability to influence them at multiple levels to drive meaningful change.\n\nGeorgina Campbell Flatter pioneers new ways to increase the climate resilience and prosperity of African farmers at TomorrowNow. \"We have reached almost 500,000 farmers in Kenya with next gen weather services this year already. The opportunities for tech to make a difference to people's lives and help build climate resilience are right in front of us, we just need to make sure the solutions benefit those most in need.”\n\nTogether, the Fellows will participate in a blend of immersive seminars, workshops, and self-directed experiments to support their food systems work. Leveraging the principles of moral leadership and systems leadership, they’ll unlock their leadership potential and reimagine ways of creating more inclusive, nourishing, and regenerative food systems. At the end of the year, the Fellows will join our global class of 40 Food Systems Fellows, and our global community of over 1300 social innovators — who have collectively made an impact on more than 8 million lives across the world — to share in a lifelong journey of solving problems of poverty and building a world based on dignity.\n\nJoin us in celebrating this year’s cohort of Food Systems Fellows, and follow Acumen Academy on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook to keep up to date on these inspiring leaders and the work they’re doing to build food systems that work for everyone.\n\nCheryse Kaui Sana | Hawaii, USA\n\nKaui is the General Farm Manager of MA'O Organic Farms, an organisation with a mission to grow organic produce and empower youth leaders in Waianae, Hawai'i.
