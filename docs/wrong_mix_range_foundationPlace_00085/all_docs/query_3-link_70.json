JAMES OTERO, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA; AND ROBERT JUNELL, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS ---------- WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 29, 2003 United States Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:39 a.m., in Room SD-226, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Orrin G. Hatch, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Hatch, Kyl, DeWine, Sessions, Graham, Craig, Chambliss, Cornyn, Leahy, Kennedy, Biden, Kohl, Feinstein, Feingold, Schumer, Durbin, and Edwards. Chairman Hatch. Our hearings are open to the public and to the interested public. Of course, as a champion of the ADA and the Americans with Disabilities Act, I've done everything possible to accommodate the persons with disabilities, who informed us yesterday that they would be attending the hearing. Now, in fact, when we received word that there would be three deaf people in attendance, we immediately arranged an interpreter for them. When we were informed that up to 100 people with disabilities would be coming, we immediately began looking throughout the building for an additional suitable room to accommodate all of them. As background, the Committee practices to allow the public to attend hearings on a first-come, first-serve basis, and often many of the people who wait in line never get in. Rather than follow the usual practice and have most people in the hallways, we instead reserved SD-G50, a special first floor room for any guest who could not be accommodated in the hearing room. Now, we are very disappointed that we were unable to get SH-216, which would have been a bigger room and would have allowed us perhaps to get everybody in. I have asked my staff to look at SD-G50 and see how full it is, and see if we can accommodate everybody down there because we could immediately move down there if it is. Our problem is all of the television is set up and everything else right now, but we will check on it and we will see what we can do, because I am the last person on earth who would not want to accommodate those who are persons with disabilities. So we will start here and we will check out that room. If it is capable of handling this, we will try to accommodate if we can move everything down there, but as of right now, I think we are going to have to proceed here until I receive back word from staff. Senator Leahy. Can I say something about that? Chairman Hatch. And I would like your staff to work with them. Senator Leahy. I would. I have already asked my staff to go down and look at SD-G50. When I went by there earlier this morning, I mean it is a huge room. I think it would probably accommodate. We had people standing out here for an hour waiting, and maybe one way to do it would be to have the Senators who are here to make their statements, but I would really strongly urge that we move down there. It is a much larger room and it would be a lot easier to accommodate some people who have not been able to get in. Chairman Hatch. Let's see if we can do it. [Applause.] Senator Kennedy. I think it is a reasonable way to proceed in terms of hearing from the presenters here, and then as I understand as well, that SD-G50 is open and is available, and it seems to me that we ought to give the opportunity for people who have an interest in these nominees, an opportunity to hear them. And so I support Senator Leahy's proposal and hope that that can be-- Chairman Hatch. I think I made that comment, and I am certainly amenable to that. So let's have Senator Leahy's staff and my staff go down there and see if we can accommodate us down there. If we cannot, we are going to continue here. If we can, we will move down there with dispatch, because I am not going to waste a lot of time moving. So everybody is just going to have to move down there as quickly as they can. But I certainly want to always accommodate as many people as we possibly can, and especially those who suffer from disabilities, and we will just do it that way. We can make our two statements, and then we will have the two Senators make theirs or any other Senators who want to come at this time. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ORRIN G. HATCH, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF UTAH Chairman Hatch. Good morning. I am pleased to welcome all of you to the committee's first judicial confirmation hearing of the 108th Congress. I first would like to acknowledge and thank Senator Leahy for his service as Chairman of this Committee over the past 16 months. I also would like to extend a particular welcome to Senator Bob Dole, our former majority leader, and to Commissioner Russell Redenbaugh, the three-term U.S. Civil Rights Commissioner, who also happens to be the first disabled American to serve on that Commission. It means a great deal to me that they are both here today to support Mr. Jeff Sutton's nomination, and of course, I would also like to express my deep appreciation for the members we have here who have taken time to come and present their views on the qualifications of our witnesses today. Our first panel features three outstanding circuit nominees who were nominated on May 9, 2001, whose hearing was originally noticed for May 23, 2001. I agreed to postpone that hearing for a week at the request of some of my Democratic colleagues who claimed that they needed an additional week to assess the nominees' qualifications. As we all know, control of the Senate and the Committee shifted to the Democrats shortly thereafter on June 5th, 2001, and these nominees have been languishing in the Committee without a hearing ever since. So I am particularly pleased to pick up where we left off in May of 2001 by holding our first confirmation hearing for the same three nominees we noticed back then: Justice Deborah Cook, Jeffrey Sutton and John Roberts. It is with great pleasure that I welcome these distinguished guests before the Committee this morning. We also have three very impressive District Court nominees with us today: John Adams for the Northern District of Ohio, Robert Junell for the Western District of Texas, and S. James Otero for the Central District of California. I will reserve my remarks about these District Court nominees until I call their panel forward. Our first nominee is Ohio Supreme Court Justice Deborah Cook, who has established a distinguished record as both a litigator and a jurist. Justice Cook began her legal career in 1976 as a law clerk for the firm now known as Roderick Linton, which is Akron's oldest law firm. Upon her graduation from the University of Akron School of Law in 1978, Justice Cook became the first woman hired by that firm. In 1983 she became the first female partner in the firm's century of existence. I am proud to have her before us as a nominee who knows firsthand the difficulties and challenges that professional women face in breaking through the glass ceiling. During her approximately 15 years in the private sector, Justice Cook had a large and diverse civil litigation practice. She represented both plaintiffs and defendants at trial and on appeal in cases involving, for example, labor law, insurance claims, commercial litigation, torts and ERISA claims. In 1991 Justice Cook left the private sector after winning election to serve as a judge on the Ninth Ohio District Court of Appeals. During her 4 years on the Ninth District Bench she participated in deciding over 1,000 appeals. The Ohio Supreme Court reversed only 6 of the opinions that she authored, and 8 of the opinions on which she joined. In 1994 Justice Cook was elected to serve as a Justice on the Ohio Supreme Court. She therefore brings to the Federal Bench more than 10 years of appellate judicial experience which is built on a foundation of 15 years of solid and diverse litigation experience. There can be little doubt that she is eminently qualified to be a Sixth Circuit jurist, and I commend President Bush on his selection of her for this post. Our next nominee is Jeff Sutton, one of the most respected appellate advocates in the country today. He has argued over 45 appeals for a diversity of clients in Federal and State Courts across the country, including a remarkable number, 12 to be exact, before the U.S. Supreme Court. His remarkable skill and pleasant demeanor have won him not only a lot of decisions, but also a wide variety of prominent supporters including Seth Waxman, President Clinton's Solicitor General; Benson Wolman, the former head of the Ohio ACLU; Bonnie Campbell, a Clinton nominee to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals; Civil Rights Commissioner Redenbaugh, the first disabled American to serve on the U.S. Civil Rights Commission; and former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, who is among the country's most powerful advocates on behalf of persons with disabilities. I feel it necessary for me to comment briefly on some of the recent criticisms we have heard. Of course, no one familiar with the nominations process is surprised. We have the usual gang opposing Republican nominees. Well, their opposition of Jeff Sutton is for all of the wrong reasons. But as people who know me well will attest, I have always been willing to acknowledge a fair point made by the opposition. So in keeping with that principle, I want everyone to know that I found something commendable in the so-called report published by one of these groups about Jeff Sutton. That report conceded that, ``No one has seriously contended that Sutton is personally biased against people with disabilities.'' Now, that is a very important point, and should be obvious since Jeff Sutton has a well-known record of fighting for the legal rights of persons with disabilities. And he was raised in an environment of concern for the disabled. His father ran a school for people affected by cerebral palsy. Since the opposition to Jeff Sutton is not personal, then what is it? It seems to come down to a public policy disagreement about some Supreme Court decisions relating to the limits to Federal power when Congress seeks to regulate state governments. Those cases include the City of Berne, Kimel and Garrett, among others. But in those cases it was Jeffrey Sutton's job, as the chief appellate lawyer for the State of Ohio and as a lawyer, to defend his client's legal interest. As the American Bar Association ethics rules make clear: ``[a] lawyer's representation of a client, including representation by appointment, does not constitute an endorsement of the client's political, economic, social or moral views of activities.'' Now, I do not think anyone on this Committee would actually consider voting against a nominee out of dislike for the nominee's clients. We had an important discussion about clients in connection with the confirmation of Marsha Berzon, now a judge on the Ninth Circuit, who was born in Ohio by the way, and this Committee ultimately decided not to hold her responsible for her clients' views. Judge Berzon had been a long-time member of the ACLU, serving on the board of directors as the vice president of the Northern California Branch. She testified that, quote: ``If I am confirmed as a judge, not only will the ACLU's positions be irrelevant but the positions of my former clients and indeed my own positions on any policy matters, will be quite irrelevant, and I will be required to, and I commit to look at the statute, the constitutional provisions and the precedents only in deciding the case.'' That was on July 30th, 1998. Now, I want to remind my colleagues that that answer sufficed for Judge Berzon, and she was approved by this Committee with my support and confirmed by the Senate. It took longer than I would have liked it to have taken, but she was approved. I think we all agree that anybody involved in a legal dispute has a right to hire a good lawyer, even if that person is guilty of murder. And Jeff's clients are not murderers. They are state governments defending their legal rights. So let's not beat up on Mr. Sutton because he worked for the State of Ohio. Of course, I am not suggesting that Committee members must praise the effects of the Supreme Court's rulings in City of Berne, Kimel and Garrett. Those decisions affected real people and undid some of the hard work on the part of Congress. I should know. A number of us on this committee, and certainly Senator Kennedy and I, we did a lot of work on those cases. We put in a great deal of time and energy into drafting and passing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and other laws that have been declared Federal power, including the Violence Against Women Act, which Senator Biden spent so much time on, and myself. I thought those laws would be good for the country, and they still are. It was not easy to see them limited or struck down. Of course I understand the powerful constitutional principles and underpinning of the Supreme Court's decisions in those cases, but I can sympathize with those who see things differently. I have no sympathy, however, for the notion that those Supreme Court decisions and the positions of the states that were Mr. Sutton's clients are somehow a legitimate reason to oppose Mr. Sutton's nomination. That is ridiculous. So since even the people for the American Way concedes that Jeff Sutton harbors no personal bias, and since Mr. Sutton cannot be held responsible for the Supreme Court's decisions, and since we all agree that Ohio and Alabama and Florida have the right to representation in court, then I do not see any real reason to oppose this highly skilled and highly qualified and highly rated lawyer by the ABA. I do look forward to his testimony and would only urge my colleagues and observers to keep an open mind. From the record I have observed so far, I am convinced that Jeff Sutton will be a great judge, and one who understands the proper role of a judge. Our final circuit nominee today is Mr. John Roberts, who has been nominated for a seat on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. He is widely considered to be one of the premier appellate litigators of his generation. Most lawyers are held in high esteem if they have the privilege of arguing even one case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Mr. Roberts has argued an astounding 39 cases before the Supreme Court. At least that as the last count I had. It is truly an honor to have such an accomplished litigator before this committee, and one of the most well-recognized and approved appellate litigators in history. The high esteem in which Mr. Roberts is held is reflected in a letter the Committee recently received urging his confirmation. This letter, which I will submit for the record, was signed by more than 150 members of the D.C. Bar, including such well-respected attorneys as Lloyd Cutler, who was the White House Counsel to both Presidents Carter and Clinton; Boyden Gray, who was the White House Counsel for the first President Bush; and Seth Waxman, who was President Clinton's Solicitor General. The letter states, quote: ``Although as individuals we reflect a wide spectrum of political party affiliation and ideology, we are united in our belief that John Roberts will be an outstanding Federal Court of Appeals Judge and should be confirmed by the United States Senate. He is one of the very best and most highly respected appellate lawyers in the Nation, with a deserved reputation as a brilliant writer and oral advocate. He is also a wonderful professional colleague, both because of his enormous skills and because of his unquestioned integrity and fair-mindedness.'' This is high praise from a group of lawyers, who themselves have clearly excelled in their profession, who are not easily impressed, and who would not recklessly put their reputations on the line by issuing such a sterling endorsement if they were not 100 percent convinced that John Roberts will be a fair judge who will follow the law regardless of his personal beliefs. Let me just say a brief word about Mr. Roberts' background before turning to Senator Leahy. He graduated from Harvard College summa cum laude in 1976, and received his law degree magna cum laude in 1979 from the Harvard Law School, where he was managing editor of the Harvard Law Review. Following graduation he served as a law clerk for Second Circuit Judge Henry J. Friendly, and for then Justice William Rehnquist of the Supreme Court. From 1982 to 1986 Roberts served as associate counsel to the President in the White House Counsel's Office. From 1989 to 1993 he served as Principal Deputy Solicitor General at the U.S. Department of Justice. He now heads the appellate practice group at the prestigious D.C. law firm Hogan & Hartson, and he has received the ABA's highest rating of unanimously well qualified. I have to say that this panel represents the best, and I commend President Bush for seeking out such nominees of the highest caliber. Now, I just have a note here. Let me see what it says, and then I will turn to Senator Leahy. For everybody's information, I have been advised that we can set up in another large room. We will proceed here until the other room is ready for us at which time we will take a short recess and accommodate further the request made yesterday for additional accommodations. So I would prefer that, and even though it is an inconvenience to all of you, let's see if we can try and get at least these folks into that room first because they were here first, as well as those persons with disabilities who desire to attend. Anybody know what the room is? SD-G50 will be the room, so apparently we can hold it there. Senator Kennedy. Could I just thank the chair for that accommodation? Appreciate it very much. Chairman Hatch. That is fine. Senator Leahy. Chairman, I think it was-- Chairman Hatch. Let me turn to the Ranking Member for his remarks. [The prepared statement of Chairman Hatch appears as a submission for the record.] STATEMENT OF HON. PATRICK J. LEAHY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VERMONT Senator Leahy. I think it was a wise thing to do. As I said, when I walked by there, there appeared to be plenty of room. I am wondering, Mr. Chairman, I am wondering if we are going to be moving down there anyway, and Senator Warner and Senator Hutchinson, I would just as soon withhold my statement until we go down there, as a courtesy to Senator Warner and Senator Hutchison, and if Senator Voinovich comes, if they want to give their statement here, and then I will give my opening statement down there. Chairman Hatch. I would prefer for you to give your opening statement, and then we will hear from the two Senators. Senator Leahy. Happy to do that, Mr. Chairman. I tried. Chairman Hatch. I think my colleagues understand. Senator Leahy. I know they are anxious to hear my statement anyway. Chairman Hatch. Well, I am certainly anxious to hear it. Senator Leahy. Following the Chairman's example, it will be a little bit lengthy. We meet in an extraordinary session to consider six important nominees for lifetime appointments to the Federal Bench. During the last 4 years of the Clinton administration this Committee refused to hold hearings and Committee votes on qualified nominees to the D.C. Circuit and the Sixth Circuit. Today, in very sharp contrast, the Committee is being required to proceed on three controversial nominations to those same circuit courts and do it simultaneously. Many see this as part of a concerted and partisan effort to pack the courts and tilt them sharply out of balance. In contrast to the President's Circuit Court nominees, the District Court nominees to vacancies in California, Texas and Ohio, seem to be more moderate and bipartisan. Today we will hear from Judge Otero, nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, unanimously approved by California's bipartisan Judicial Advisory Committee, established through an agreement between Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer with the White House. I wish the White House would proceed to nominate another qualified consensus nominee like Judge Otero for the remaining vacancy in California. Too often in the last 2 years we have seen the recommendations of such bipartisan panels rejected or stalled at the White House. I note that Judge Otero's contributed to the community, worked on a pro bono project for the Mexican Legal Defense and Education Fund, served as a member of the Mexican Bar Association, the Stanford Chicano Alumni Association and the California Latino Judges Association, among others. We will hear from Robert Junell, nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, another consensus nominee who has a varied career as litigator and member of the Texas House of Representatives, life member of the NAACP, and a former member of the board of directors of La Esperanza clinic. I spoke earlier with Representative Charlie Stenholm, who strongly supports him. And then of course, Judge Adams, nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. These are not the ones who create the controversy, and I am disappointed the Chairman has unilaterally chosen to pack so many Circuit Court nominees onto the docket of a single hearing. This is certainly unprecedented in his earlier tenure as Chairman, and it is simply no way to consider the controversial and divisive nominations in a single hearing. It is not the way to discharge our constitutional duty to advise and consent to the President's nominees. When I was Chairman over 17 months we reformed the process of judicial nomination hearings. We made tangible progress repairing the damage done to the process in the previous 6 years. We showed how nominations of a Republican President could be considered twice as quickly in a Democratic controlled Senate as a Republican controlled Senate considered President Clinton's nominees. We added new accountability by making the positions of home-state Senators public for the first time, and we did away with the previous Republican process of anonymous holds. We made significant progress in helping to fill judgeships in the last Congress. The number of vacancies was slashed from 110 to 59, despite an additional 50 new vacancies that arose during that time. Chairman Hatch had written in September 1997 that 103 vacancies--this was during the Clinton administration--did not constitute a vacancy crisis. He also stated his position on numerous occasions that 67 vacancies meant full employment on the Federal court. Even with the two additional vacancies that have arisen since the beginning of the year, there are now 61 vacancies on the District and Circuit Courts. Under a Democratic controlled Senate we went well below the level that Chairman Hatch used to consider acceptable, and the Federal Courts have more judges now than when Chairman Hatch proclaimed them in full employment. We made the extraordinary progress we did by holding hearings on consensus nominees with widespread support and moving them quickly, but by also recognizing that this President's more divisive judicial nominees would take time. We urge the White House to consult in a bipartisan way and to keep the courts out of politics and partisan ideology. We urged the President to be a uniter, not a divider, when it came to our Federal Courts. We were rebuffed on that. All Americans need to be able to have confidence in the courts and judges, and they need to maintain the independence necessary to rule fairly on the laws and rights of the American people to be free from discrimination, to have our environmental consumer protection laws upheld. Under Democratic leadership in the Senate we confirmed 100 of President Bush's nominees within 17 months. Two others were rejected by a majority vote of this committee. Several others were controversial. They had a number of negative votes, but they were confirmed. And given all the competing responsibilities of the Committee and the Senate in these times of great challenges to our Nation, especially after the attacks of September 11th, then later the anthrax attacks directed at Senator Daschle and myself, attacks that killed several people and disrupted the operations of the Senate itself, hearings for 103 judicial nominees, voting on 102, and favorably reporting 100 in 17 months is a record we can be proud of, and one that I would challenge anybody to show, certainly in recent years to be matched. During the 107th Congress the Committee voted 102 of 103 judicial nominees eligible for votes. That is 99 percent. Of those voted upon, 98 percent were reported favorably to the Senate. Of those, 100 percent were confirmed. Incidentally, we completed hearings of 94 percent of the judges that had their files completed. Now, this 103 judges heard in 17 months is contrast to the less than 40 a year that the Republicans had when they had President Clinton as President. Indeed, they failed to proceed on 79 of President Clinton's judicial nominees in the 2-year Congress in which they were nominated. More than 50 of them were never even given a hearing. Indeed, the Senate confirmed more judicial nominees in our 17 months than the Republican controlled Senate did during 30 months. More achieved in half the time, but achieved responsibly. We showed how steady progress could be made without sacrificing fairness. But in contrast, this hearing today portends real dangers to the process and to the results, all to the detriments of our courts and to the protections they are intended to afford to the American people. The Senate, in this instance, and the Congress in many others, is supposed to act as a check on the Executive and add balance to the process. Proceeding as the majority has unilaterally chosen today is unprecedented. It is wrong. It undercuts the ability of this Committee and the Senate to provide balance. Three controversial Circuit nominations of a Republican President for a single hearing. That is something the Chairman, current Chairman, something he never did for the moderate and relatively noncontroversial nominees of a Democratic President just a few years ago. One has to think it is a headlong effort to pack the courts, and notwithstanding our efforts not to carry out the same instruction as we saw with a Democratic President, we seem to be going back to different rules for different Presidents. Jeffrey Sutton's nomination has generated significant controversy and opposition. I have questions about his efforts to challenge and weaken among other laws the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination Employment Act, the Violence Against Women Act, and his perceived general antipathy to Federal protection for state workers. I am concerned that more than 500 disability rights groups, civil rights groups, and women's groups are opposed to his confirmation because they feel. he will act against their interests and not protect their rights. I am concerned about a reputation among observers of the legal community that he is a leading advocate for the states' rights revival. This is a nomination that deserves serious scrutiny and which ought to be considered has been the practice for decades in this Committee as the only circuit court nominee in this hearing. The process imposed by my friends on the other side of the aisle is cheating the American people of the scrutiny these nominees should be accorded. We are also being asked to simultaneously consider the nomination of Deborah Cook. She is one of the most active dissenters on the Ohio Supreme Court. She comes to the Committee with a judicial record deserving of some scrutiny, and it has also generated a good deal of controversy and opposition as well. I note that these two difficult nominations are both in judgeships on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. Now, that was a court to which President Clinton had a much harder time getting his nominees considered. Republicans fail to acknowledge that most of the vacancies that have plagued the Sixth Circuit arose during the Clinton administration, when President Clinton had nominated people to the Court, and they were never even given a hearing. The Republicans closed the gates. They refused to consider any of the three highly qualified, moderate nominees President Clinton sent to the Senate for those vacancies. Not one of the Clinton nominees to those current vacancies on the Sixth Circuit received a hearing by the Judiciary Committee under Republican leadership from 1997 through June 2001. Now, in spite of that history, when the Democrats took over, we gave Committee consideration, and we confirmed two of President Bush's conservative nominees to that court last year. We did not play tit for tat. With the confirmations of Judge Julia Smith Gibbons of Tennessee, Professor John Marshall Rogers of Kentucky, Democrats confirmed the only two new judges to the Sixth Circuit in the past 5 years. Regrettably, despite our best efforts, the White House rejected all suggestions to address the legitimate concerns of Senators in that circuit that qualified, moderate nominees were blocked by Republicans when they were in charge. The Republican majority refused to hold hearings on the nomination of Judge Helen White, Kathleen McCree Lewis, Professor Kent Markus. One of those seats has been vacant since 1995, the first term of President Clinton. Judge Helene White of the Michigan Court of Appeals was nominated in January 1997. She did not receive a hearing on her nomination during the more than 1,500 days her nomination was before this committee, which probably set a record--4 years--51 months, in fact, no hearing. She was one of 79 Clinton judicial nominees who did not get a hearing during the Congress in which she was first nominated, and she was denied a hearing after being renominated a number of times, including in January 2001. Actually, the committee, under Republican control, had only about eight Courts of Appeals nominees a year that they heard. In 2000, they only held five, which contrasted today, with a Republican president, they will hold three in 1 day. We have Kathleen McCree Lewis, a distinguished African- American lawyer from a prestigious Michigan law firm was never accorded a hearing on her 1990 nomination to the Sixth Circuit, and that nomination was finally withdrawn by President Bush. Professor Kent Marcus, another outstanding nominee to a vacancy in the Sixth Circuit, never received a hearing on his nomination. And while his nomination was pending, his confirmation was supported by individuals of every political stripe, including 14 past presidents of the Ohio State Bar Association, and more than 80 professors and groups like the National District Attorneys' Association and virtually every newspaper in the State. Now, Professor Marcus did say in testimony at another hearing how what happened to him, here are some of the things he said: ``On February 9, 2000, I was the President's first judicial nominee in that calendar year. And then the waiting began.'' ``At the time my nomination was pending, despite lower vacancy rates in the Sixth Circuit, in calendar year 2000, the Senate confirmed circuit nominees to the Third, Ninth and Federal Circuits.'' No Sixth Circuit nominee was given a hearing. ``. . .more vacancies on the way, why then did my nomination expire without even a hearing?'' And then, to quote him, ``To their credit, Senator DeWine and his staff and Senator Hatch's staff and others close to him were straight with me.'' ``Over and over again they told me two things: There will be no more confirmations to the Sixth Circuit during the Clinton Administration. This has nothing to do with you, personally. It doesn't matter who the nominee is, what credentials they may have or what support they may have, they're not going to be heard.'' As Professor Markus identified, some on the other side of the aisle held these seats open for years for a Republican President to fill, instead of proceeding fairly. That is why there are now so many vacancies on the Sixth Circuit. Had Republicans not blocked President Clinton's nominees to the Sixth Circuit, if the three Democratic nominees had been confirmed and President Bush appointed the other vacancies on the Sixth Circuit, that court would be almost evenly balanced between judges appointed by Republican and Democratic Presidents, and that is why the Republicans blocked it. They do not want balance, and the same is true of a number of other circuits. The former Chief Judge of the Sixth Circuit, Judge Gilbert Merritt, wrote to the Judiciary Committee Chairman years ago to ask the nominees get hearings. He predicted by the time the next President is inaugurated, there will be six vacancies on the Court of Appeals. Almost half the court will be vacant. But no Sixth Circuit hearings were held in the last three/4 years of the Clinton administration, almost the entire second presidential term, despite these pleas. And when I scheduled the April 2001 hearing on President Bush's nomination of Judge Gibbons to the Sixth Circuit, it was the first hearing on a Sixth Circuit nomination in almost 5 years, even though there had been three pending for President Clinton that never got heard, and we confirmed Judge Gibson by a vote of 95 to nothing. But we did not stop there. We proceeded to hold this hearing on a second Sixth Circuit nominee just a few short months later--Professor Rogers. He, too, was confirmed. This is very similar to what had happened in the Circuit of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the Nation's circuit. It plays a significant role in environmental areas, OSHA, the National Labor Relations Board. There, again, President Clinton's nominees were not allowed to be heard, although we did hold a hearing for one of President Bush's last year. Allen Snyder was a law partner of Mr. Roberts and a former clerk to Chief Justice Rehnquist. He was never allowed a Committee vote. The Republicans refused to give Professor Elena Kagan, another D.C. Circuit nominee, a hearing during the 18 months she was pending. Today's nominees to the D.C. Circuit, John Roberts, worked in the Reagan Justice Department, in the Reagan White House, was an associate of former Solicitor General Kenneth Starr. It is obvious the Bush administration feels far more comfortable with him. Also, home-State Senators I understand have not been consulted in these. We have certainly not received any ``blue slips'' back. What we are doing is we are appointing people to the highest courts in the land, with little more attention and scrutiny than we would pay to appoint these for a temporary Federal commission. It is a disservice to the American people. The American people can be excused for sensing that there is the smell of an ink pad in the air, rubber stamps already out of the drawer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Senator Leahy appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Hatch. Thank you, Senator Leahy. [Applause.] Chairman Hatch. We will have order in the room. We will turn to--yes, sir? Senator Schumer. I know we do not have opening statements, and I do not want to get into any of the substance here, but I would ask that a letter that a number of us signed to you be added to the record. Chairman Hatch. We will put both your letter-- Senator Schumer. And I would just make this point. We received notice of who the witnesses would be at 4:45 yesterday. That does not give anyone any chance to prepare. The Committee has not organized. We do not have rules. You are changing the rule of the tradition of the ``blue slip,'' but we do not know what it is. This is just being rushed beyond, aside from the fact which Senator Leahy dealt with, in terms of the three nominees, now we have received notice for a hearing next Tuesday. We do not know who is going to be on the hearing, and there is a rule in the Committee of a one-week notice. And so there is just a tremendous rush to judgment here that is just not fair. We know we have differences on these nominees, but all of the procedures seem to be being ripped up in an effort to rush things through, and I would just ask that you give the letter that we sent you some consideration. It is not fair to tell us at 4:45 last night as to who the witnesses were going to be. On important judges like this, it is important that we get a chance to prepare, and I would just urge that in the future, this policy--or whatever it is--be reexamined. We have no chance, no chance to adequately prepare. If the impression that Senator Leahy said that we are just trying to rush things through without thorough examination is rankling some people, it is no wonder, because of all of these things. It is just not right for us. And I would ask you really give consideration to the letter, as you were generous enough to move the room as well, because we are going to have an awful time over the next year if we are not going to get an adequate chance to prepare to ask questions fully, et cetera, and I know it has not been your way in the past. You have always tried to be fair. Chairman Hatch. I appreciate the Senator's remarks. Certainly, your letter will go into the record, and our response to your letter will go into the record as well, and I intended to put them in the record. Also, I have been announcing for two weeks who are the witnesses are. They have been waiting 630 days. I think that is adequate time to prepare, but on the other hand, if there is a problem here, I am going to solve it for you. We will try and give better notice, but our obligation is to give notice of the hearing. Sometimes it is very difficult to adjust and get people, you know, prepared and there, but I will certainly take your comments into consideration. Let us turn to Senator Warner, and then Senator Hutchison, and then Senator Voinovich, and then, of course, we have Senator DeWine, who, also, along with Senator Voinovich, has two Ohio State judges, and then Senator Feinstein, if you would care to make your remarks about your judge here today or we could do it right before they are called up. Senator Feinstein. Whatever is your pleasure. Chairman Hatch. I will accommodate you. I will accommodate you. Senator Feinstein. I would be happy, since I am going to be here, I would be happy to wait for the other Senators. Chairman Hatch. And then wait until your judge is called up. Senator Feinstein. Yes. Chairman Hatch. That will be fine. Senator Warner? PRESENTATION OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR., NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT BY HON. JOHN WARNER, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VIRGINIA Senator Warner. Chairman Hatch, Senator Leahy, and members of the committee, I will ask to submit my statement for the record-- Chairman Hatch. Without objection, all statements will be put in the record. Senator Warner. --for three reasons: First, as a courtesy to the Committee and to our guests who have been very patient; secondly, this nominee, John Roberts, is indeed one of the most outstanding that I have ever had the privilege of presenting on behalf of a President in my 25 years in the United States Senate. His record needs no enhancement by this humble Senator, I assure you. So I ask that the Committee receive this nomination. He is accompanied by his wife Jane, his children Josephine and John, who have been unusually quiet, and we thank you very much and patient-- [Laughter.] Senator Warner. --his parents and his sisters. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, if I may indulge a personal observation, Mr. Roberts is designated to serve on the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Exactly one-half century ago, 50 years, I was a clerk on that court, and so I take a particular interest in presenting this nominee. Also, the nominee is a member of the firm of Hogan & Hartson, one of the leading firms in the Nation's capital. Fifty years ago, I was a member of that firm. And I just reminisced with the nominee. I was the thirty-fourth lawyer in that firm, which was one of the largest in the Nation's capital. Today, there are 1,000 members of that law firm, to show you the change in the practice of law in the half-century that I have been a witness to this. Mr. Chairman, you covered in your opening remarks every single fact that I had hopefully desired to inform the committee. So, again, for that reason you have, most courteously, Mr. Chairman, stated all of the pertinent facts about this extraordinary man, having graduated from Harvard, summa cum laude, in 1976.l Three years later, he graduated from Harvard Law School, magna cum laude, where he served as managing editor of the Harvard Law Review. Those of us who have pursued the practice of law, know that few of us could have ever attained that status. Even if I went back and started all over again, I could not do it. He served as law clerk to Judge Friendly on the usn Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and worked as a law clerk to the current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Judge Rehnquist--Justice Rehnquist. So I commend the President, I commend this nominee. I am hopeful that the Committee will judiciously and fairly consider this nomination and that the Senate will give its advice and consent for this distinguished American to serve as a part of our Judicial Branch. I thank the chair and members of the committee. [The prepared statement of Senator Warner appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Hatch. Thank you, Senator Warner. We appreciate it. Senator Hutchison? PRESENTATION OF ROBERT JUNELL, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS BY HON. KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS Senator Hutchison. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I am very pleased to introduce my friend, Rob Junell, who has been nominated to serve as a district judge for the Western District in Midland, Texas. This court is identified as a judicial emergency by the Judicial Conference of the United States. Rob has brought his wife Beverly with him today, and I know he will introduce her later, but I want to say that Rob and Beverly are real friends of mine. Sometimes we nominate people that are great on the merits, but we do not know them. Well, Rob is great on the merits, and I know him well. He served seven terms in the Texas House of Representatives, retiring voluntarily last year. He was Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee and the House Budget Committee, and I worked with him when I was State treasurer. And just a little vignette about the kind of person he is, I was elected to a 4-year term as State treasurer and introduced a very complicated piece of legislation to limit our State debt to the legislature. I asked Representative Junell to carry that bill, since he was Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and I thought, since it was so complicated, that I would put it out there, talk about it, let the members have the chance to really look at it and study it, and then in my second year, second part of my term, after the fourth year, I thought we would try to pass it. Well, Representative Junell did such a terrific job of carrying the bill that he passed it the first session that I had given it to him, and we do have a limit now on general obligation debt in Texas, which has served us very well throughout the ups and downs of the economy of our State. Rob graduated from NMMI, then graduated from Texas Tech and Texas Tech Law School, with honors. He received a master's degree from the University of Arkansas. He is very active in his local community of San Angelo, including service on the boards of the United Way of the Concho Valley, the San Angelo AIDS Foundation, and Schreiner University in Kerrville, Texas. He is a lifetime member of the NAACP. He also has received numerous honors and awards recognizing his leadership in serving the people of Texas. He has earned the distinction as Legislator of the Year given by the Texas Public Employees Association, the Vietnam Veterans Association, and the Greater Dallas Crime Commission. The Dallas Morning News named him one of the best of the best in the Texas legislature in 1995. In addition to Rob's legislative service, he has continued to maintain a law practice. In Texas, the legislature only meets 5 months every other year, a practice that I would recommend to the U.S. Congress. So these are people who have real jobs in the real world. He has been a practicing lawyer, very well-respected in the San Angelo and West Texas communities and has a wide range of clients, including hospitals, small businesses, school districts and individuals. I recommend my friend Rob Junell highly to you and hope that we can have an expeditious confirmation of his nomination. Chairman Hatch. Well, thank you, Senator Hutchison. We are sorry you have had to wait this long, but it is just the way it is on this committee, so we appreciate your patience. Senator Hutchison. Thank you. Senator Leahy. I appreciate you being here, too. You have mentioned him before with the same kind of glowing--he should know that even when he is not in the room, you have always said such nice things about him. As I said, Congressman Stenholm called me, too, to say similar things, and I do appreciate it. Senator Hutchison. Yes. Thank you very much. Chairman Hatch. Thank you. We will turn to Senator Voinovich, first, and then we will wind up with Senator DeWine. PRESENTATION OF DEBORAH L. COOK AND JEFFREY S. SUTTON, NOMINEES TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGES FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT AND JOHN ADAMS, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OHIO BY HON. GEORGE VOINOVICH, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF OHIO Senator Voinovich. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. I thank you for allowing me to speak on behalf of three deserving attorneys from the State of Ohio. I am anxious to express my strong recommendations for Justice Deborah Cook, Jeffrey Sutton, both of whom the President nominated to serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth District, as well as Judge John Adams, who has been nominated to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Judge Cook and Mr. Sutton were members of the original group that the President of the United States nominated for the Federal judiciary, and I am very pleased that this Committee is finally having a hearing on their nominations. I have known Judge Cook for over 25 years. I know her to be a brilliant lawyer, a wonderful person. She graduated from the University of Akron Law School in 1998 or 1978, and immediately went to work for the law firm of Roderick, Myers and Linton, Akron's oldest law firm. She was the first female lawyer to be hired by this firm, and in 1983 she became its first female partner. Deborah remained at Roderick Myers until 1991, when she was elected to Ohio's Ninth District Court of Appeals. She remained on this bench until 1995, when she was elected to the Supreme Court of the State of Ohio, an office which she continues to hold. She is married to her husband, Robert Linton, and Deborah has always exhibited a love of her family and community, and I am glad that her brother and her nephews are here today for this hearing. It is an historic day for their family. As a long-time resident of Akron, Deborah has demonstrated her commitment to her community, involved in the Akron Women's Network, the Akron Bar Association, the Akron Volunteer Center, Summit County United Way, and the Akron Art Museum, just to name a few. Throughout these 25 years, I have found Deborah to be a woman of exceptional character and integrity. Her professional demeanor and thorough knowledge combine to make her truly an excellent candidate for appointment to the Sixth Circuit. Deborah has served with distinction on Ohio's Supreme Court since her election in 1994 and reelection in the year 2000. My only regret is the confirmation to the Sixth District that we will lose and an outstanding judge in our Supreme Court. However, I am confident that she will be a real asset to the Federal bench. With the combined years of 10 years of appellate judicial experience on the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court, she uniquely combines keen intellect, legal scholarship and consistency in her opinions. She is a strong advocate of applying the law without fear or favor and not making policy towards a particular constituency. She is a committed individual and trusted leader, and it is my pleasure to give her my highest recommendation. I would just like to mention, in closing, that newspapers from Ohio have endorsed her on two occasions. Recently, on January the 6th, 2003, the Columbus Dispatch said, ``Since 1996, she has served on the Ohio Supreme Court, where she has distinguished herself as a careful jurist, with a profound respect for judicial restraint, and the separation of powers between the three branches of Government.'' The Plain Dealer, the largest newspaper in Ohio said, ``Cook is a thoughtful, mature jurist, perhaps the brightest on the State's highest court.'' And in May of 2000, the Beacon Journal, the Akron paper, stated that ``Deborah Cook's work has been a careful reading of the law, buttressed by closely argued opinions and sharp legal reasoning.'' I think that Deborah is someone that is very ideal for the Federal bench. Jeffrey Sutton, another nominee. I am pleased to speak on behalf of Jeffrey, a man of unquestioned intelligence and qualifications. With vast experience in commercial, constitutional and appellate legislation litigation. Jeffrey graduated first in his law school from the Ohio State University, followed by two clerkships with the United States Supreme Court, as well as the Second Circuit. Because he was the solicitor general of Ohio when I was Governor, I worked with him extensively when he represented the Governor's office, and in my judgment, he never exhibited any predisposition with regard to an issue. He has contributed so much with his compassion for people and the law. In my opinion, Jeffrey Sutton is exactly what the Federal bench needs--a fresh, objective perspective. He is fair and eminently qualified. His qualifications for this judgeship are best evidenced through his experience. He has argued nine cases before the United States Supreme Court, including Hohn v. The United States, in which the court invited Mr. Sutton's participation, and Becker v. Montgomery, in which he represented prisoners' interests pro bono. It is worthy to note that when I recently visited the Supreme Court to move the admission of some of my fellow Ohio State University graduates, that the clerk of the court himself commented favorably on Jeff's abilities. I will never forget it. We were moving him through, and he went out of the way. In addition to the U.S. Supreme Court, Jeff has argued 12 cases in the Ohio Supreme Court and six in the Sixth Circuit. While his unwillingness to shy away from challenging or controversial issues has, in some instances, led critics to question his qualifications and accomplishments, I believe such comments do not accurately reflect Jeff Sutton's heart. What these detractors fail to mention is how he argued pro bono on behalf of a blind student seeking admission to medical school; how he filed an amicus curiae brief with the Ohio Supreme Court in support of Ohio's hate crimes law on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League, the NAACP and other human rights, Bar Association; or his work on behalf of the Equal Justice Foundation, arguing on behalf of the poor. You do not hear that much about Jeff. Jeff Sutton also should not be criticized on assumptions that past legal positions reflect his personal views. Instead, he should be lauded for always zealously advocating his clients' interests, no matter what the issue. In fact, the letters I received in support of Jeff's nomination are some of the best evidence of his overwhelming, across-the-board support in the State of Ohio. I am going to ask that these letters that I have got be submitted for the record, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Hatch. Without objection. We will put them in the record. Senator Voinovich. But I would like to just read an excerpt from Benson Wolman. Benson Wolman and I have known each other since we were in law school together. He was probably the most liberal member there at the Ohio State University. He is a former executive director of the ACLU of Ohio, a self- proclaimed liberal Democrat, and here is what he said: ``Jeff's commitment to individual rights, his civility as an opposing counsel, his sense of fairness, his devotion to civic responsibilities and his keen and demonstrated intellect all reflect the best that is to be found in the legal profession.'' Greg Myers, chief counsel in the Death Penalty Division of the Office of the Public Defender, remarked: ``Jeff's integrity, respect, tolerance and understanding not only for the lawyers who advocate different positions, but for the legal ideas that stand in opposition to his.'' Mr. Chairman, I could go on praising Jeff for the outstanding--he is one of the brightest--may be the brightest lawyer we have got in the entire State. I have questioned his sense of wanting to serve on the Federal bench at his young age, with the family that he has, but you will see from his testimony he is an unbelievably qualified individual that really wants to serve his country. He has been active in his community. I am glad that his wife and his children are here today with him, members of his family, and I want to thank them for the sacrifice that they are willing to make, to allow him to serve in the judiciary. So, Mr. Chairman, I have worked with Deb and with Jeff, and they are wonderful people, and they will be real assets to the court. The last individual, and I will try to make it short, is John Adams. John is a native of Orville, Ohio. He is a very qualified candidate for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District. Judge Adams received his degrees from Bowling Green and his juris doctorate from the University of Akron. He currently is a judge in the Court of Common Pleas in Summit County. The Court of Common Pleas is the primary State court having original jurisdiction in all criminal felony cases and all civil cases, where the amount in controversy is over $15,000. Prior to that, the judge worked as a partner in the law firm of Kaufman & Kaufman in Akron as a Summit County prosecutor and as an associate with the law firm of Germano, Rondy and Ciccolini. Judge Adams has demonstrated a commitment to the community he lives in. He is a member of the Akron Bar Association, the Ohio Bar. He received a Volunteer Award in 2000 for the Dramatic Brain Injury Collaborative. He has memberships in the Summit County Mental Health Association, the NAACP, Summit County Criminal Justice Coordinating Council, Summit County Civil Justice Commission. I sincerely hope that the Committee acts favorably on Judge Adams' nominations and sends this qualified nominee to the Senate floor as soon as possible. Mr. Chairman, I would like to say one other thing. I know there has been a lot of controversy about the Sixth District and who did what and so on and so forth, whether it was during the Clinton administration and now the Bush administration. The Sixth District is in need of new, more judges. They are in a crisis situation, and I would ask this Committee to expeditiously move on those two nominees. Either they are up or down, but let us get on with it. It is important. We have, I mean, it is just unbelievable to me that this has gone on as long as it has, and I am hopeful that maybe somehow all of you can work together to move forward to fill those two vacancies on that court. Thank you very much for giving me the chance to be here. Chairman Hatch. Thank you. Senator Schumer. Would my colleague yield just for a comment? Senator Voinovich. Certainly. Senator Schumer. It has been a long time, and we want to fill them, but it would work a lot better if the White House consulted with some of the Senators in the area involved, such as Senators Levin and Stabenow, who had nominated people for years. They were not even given a hearing. There is a way to move things along, but it is not simply saying, ``This is who we pick after we blocked everybody you wanted. Now you must do those.'' That is all I would say to my good friend, who I now is a very fair-minded person. Chairman Hatch. Well, let me just say this, that the administration has consulted with the in-State Senators from Ohio on this matter, which is their obligation, and I expect them to consult with the Senators from the other States when they have nominees that are up from their States, and I have demanded that they do, and I believe they are doing that. Now, I think they have met the requisite consultation here, without question, and both Senators are for all three of these Ohio nominees. But your statement, Senator, is high praise, indeed, with the experience that you have had in the State of Ohio. I think you have made a terrific statement for these nominees from Ohio, and I commend you for it. I am sorry you had to wait so long, but we are grateful to have had you here. Go ahead, Senator. Senator Leahy. I think it is fair to say that the two Senators from Ohio are well-liked by everybody on this Committee on both sides of the aisle, and I have certainly appreciated serving with them. I was struck, though, by something that Senator Voinovich said about the delays in getting vacancies filled on the Sixth Circuit. I wished that, frankly, George, I wish there had been more in your party who had expressed the same concern when there were several moderate nominees, including one from your own State, and strongly supported in your State, during the Clinton administration, and been more effort to get them to at least have a hearing so that they might have been put on there. I would contrast that with when I became chairman, we moved two people to the Sixth Circuit within a relatively short time. From the time of their hearing to the time of their vote on the floor, was a matter of weeks, at best, and I think that you would not see the vacancies had there been more of a bipartisan effort to get those nominees of President Clinton's, to get them through, rather than to be held up by Republican holds. Chairman Hatch. Senator Feinstein has asked to be able to go now, and then I am going to give Senator DeWine--we understand the room is available downstairs now and prepared. So, Senator DeWine, if you would prefer to go here or down there, we will give you that choice. Senator DeWine. It does not matter, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Hatch. Well, then we will wait. Senator Voinovich. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Hatch. Thank you, Senator Voinovich. Then, if you do not mind-- Senator DeWine. No, it does not matter. Chairman Hatch. --we will wait until we get down there, and then you can finish your statement. And, Senator Feinstein, if you would care to make yours now, I would be happy to accommodate you. PRESENTATION OF S. JAMES OTERO, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA BY HON. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Senator Feinstein. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I am very pleased to introduce Judge James Otero to the committee. He is nominated for the Central District of California. He is the sixth candidate to come before this Committee as a product of California's Bipartisan Screening Committee, which the White House, Senator Boxer and I have set up. He received a unanimous 6-0 vote from this Screening Committee. He is joined at the hearing today by his wife Jill, his son Evan, and his daughter Lauren. Jill is a special education teacher in the Los Angeles Unified School District. She has been that for 28 years. Evan is a junior at my alma mater, Stanford, where he is majoring in political science, and Lauren, a high school senior, just got accepted to Stanford University. I would like to ask them to stand and be acknowledged by the committee. Thank you very much for being here. Judge Otero is a native Californian. He spent his entire legal career in the State. He graduated from California State University, Northridge, in 1973 and Stanford Law School in 1976. Immediately out of law school, he joined the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office. He practiced there for 10 years. He held a number of important assignments, including assistant supervisor for the city's Criminal Division, where he was in charge of 35 trial deputies. In 1987, he entered private practice as a lawyer for Southern Pacific Transportation Company. His time in private practice was brief, as he was appointed to the Municipal Court of Los Angeles in 1988. Two years later, he was elevated to the Superior Court. His 13-year career on the State bench has been distinguished. Notably, from 1994 to 1996, he served as a supervising judge of the Northern District in Los Angeles. In 2002, he was named assistant supervising judge for the court's Civil Division, and he has earned a reputation as one of the top judges in Los Angeles City. I can give you many quotes from Judge Gregory O'Brien, Attorney Tom Girardi, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Chris Conway, who has described him as one of the best judges on the court. He is active in professional and civic activities. He is secretary of the California Latino Judges' Association and previously served as vice president of the California Judges' Association. He is a board member of the Salesian Boys & Girls Club and the Salesian Family Youth Center. I could also note he is a fitness buff, and over the past years, he has run in over 100 races, including 10 marathons. I think it is fair to say that I strongly recommend Judge Otero, and I thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Hatch. Well, thank you, Senator Feinstein. Now, here is what we are going to do. We are going to move down to SD-G50. We would like all of you in this room--we are trying to accommodate you by having the Sergeant of Arms and his people accompany you downstairs so you can get seated down there. So we would like you, row by row, after the dais is cleared, to come through this door, just come up through there, through that door, and we will try and get this started. We are going to recess for 10 minutes, and hopefully we can get set up in that time down there. [Recess from 10:45 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., to move to Room SD- G50.] Chairman Hatch. If everybody will come to order. I, personally, feel very, very good that we have been able to accommodate everybody, and I apologize that we did not get this done--can we turn these up somehow or another? I wonder if we can get these mikes--that is better. Now, the mikes are all open, for everybody, so they will know. I, personally, apologize that this was not taken care of in advance. We did not know. We tried to get 216 and other large rooms, and they were not available. But when I found this was available, then we have made this accommodation which I think absolutely had to be made. [Applause.] Chairman Hatch. Thank you, but we would like no further demonstrations. This is a very, very serious hearing. These are three very important people who have been nominated by the President. And if you have heard the statements, and we have one more to go, a very important statement by the distinguished Senator from Ohio, then you will understand that this a hearing that deserves dignity. So we will now turn to Senator DeWine, who is from the State of Ohio, and ask him--if you would go ahead, Senator Leahy. We will turn to Senator-- Senator Leahy. I also want to thank the Chairman for moving down here. It was the right thing to do. It was something that, when it was suggested, we moved quickly. I applaud you for doing that and then moving out of our regular place. But I just wanted to note my applause of the Chairman for moving us down here as quickly as he did. Chairman Hatch. Well, thank you, and I am very grateful to the Senate for scrambling and getting this room prepared and helping us to get this done in an efficient and quick manner. Now, we will have one more statement, and then we are going to call on the witnesses, the three Circuit witnesses. We will finish with them before we call on the District Court witnesses. I know it is going to be a pain to wait for you District Court nominees, but that is the way it is going to have to be, and we will turn to our good friend and colleague, Senator DeWine. PRESENTATION OF DEBORAH L. COOK AND JEFFREY S. SUTTON, NOMINEES TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGES FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT BY HON. MIKE DEWINE, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF OHIO Senator DeWine. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is my pleasure, as a U.S. Senator from Ohio, to introduce to this Committee today two very distinguished Ohioans, who have been nominated by President Bush to serve on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. First, I would like to introduce to the Committee Justice Deborah Cook, who is from Akron, Ohio. Justice Cook currently is serving her second term as an Ohio Supreme Justice, a post she was first elected to in 1994. Let me welcome to the Committee several people who are here to support Justice Cook. First, is her husband, Bob Linton. Bob, thank you very much for being with us today. Let me also welcome Justice Cook's brother, Kevin Cook, and his wife Katerina, and their 8-year-old son Jordan, and 6-year- old Christina, as well as Justice Cook's sister, Susan Adgate, and her two children, Frankie and Audrey, as well as two of Justice Cook's judicial clerks, Shawn Judge and his wife Corie, and another judicial clerk, Amy Cadle. Justice Cook is an excellent judge and a gracious and giving individual who has dedicated a great deal of her personal time and energy to helping the underprivileged. First, let me give the members of the Committee a little bit about her work as a judge. Justice Cook has been an appellate judge for over 11 years--4 years on the Ohio Court of Appeals, over 7 years on the Ohio Supreme Court. While Justice Cook was on the Court of Appeals, she participated in deciding over a thousand cases. Of the opinions that she wrote, she was reversed just six times. Of the cases in which she joined other judge's opinions, her appeals panel was reversed eight times. So, together, of course, that is a 1.4-percent reversal rate, and by any standards, that is a remarkable record. Now, let us take a look at the statistics during her time on the Ohio Supreme Court. As we are all aware, few State Supreme Court cases are taken for review by the United States Supreme Court. The Ohio Supreme Court is certainly no exception to that rule. But this statistic for the Ohio Supreme Court and for her decisions on that court is still worth considering. During Justice Cook's time on the Ohio Supreme Court, the United States Supreme Court has reviewed five Ohio Supreme Court decisions. The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed with Justice Cook in all five of those cases. Let me repeat that. The United States Supreme Court has agreed with Justice Cook in all five of those cases. Of those cases, one of those cases was simply a unanimous Ohio Supreme Court decision affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court 8 to 1. But in the other four cases, Justice Cook had dissented in the underlying Ohio case. She was the dissenter, and in each of these four cases, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed-- reversed--Ohio Supreme Court's majority opinion and reached the same conclusion--the same conclusion--as Justice Cook did. Now, these were not all the close 5 to 4 decisions that we sometimes see in the U.S. Supreme Court. In a Fifth Amendment self-incrimination case, the Supreme Court sided with Justice Cook 9 to nothing. Another case went 8 to 1, again siding with Justice Cook's dissent. So it is clear from these statistics that Justice Cook's decisions, when she was dissenting in these cases, was well- founded. Mr. Chairman, members of this committee, another useful gauge of a sitting judge is the evaluation she gets from objective observers who watch the court on a day-to-day basis. In Ohio, the major newspapers closely watch our High Court. After observing Justice Cook on the Ohio Supreme Court for a full 6-year term, Justice Cook was endorsed by all of the major newspapers in the State of Ohio for her 2000 reelection campaign. These newspapers included the Cleveland Plain Dealer, the Columbus Dispatch, the Cincinnati Inquirer, the Akron Beacon Journal, the Dayton Daily News, and the Toledo Blade. Let me just say, as someone who has a lot of experience with these newspapers, that covers the entire political spectrum in the State of Ohio. Since the election in the past few weeks, several Ohio papers have endorsed her nomination to the Sixth Circuit. The Cincinnati Post wrote on January 8th of this year, and I quote, Mr. Chairman, ``Cook is serving her second term on the Ohio Supreme Court, where she has been a pillar of stability and good sense. Her role on that court, one, which in the last few years has repeatedly marched on 4-to-3 votes into the realm of policy-making, has often been writing sensible dissents.'' On December 29th, 2002, insisting that the Judiciary Committee act on Justice Cook, the Cleveland Plain Dealer wrote, and I quote, ``Cook is a thoughtful, mature jurist, perhaps the brightest on the State's highest court.'' The Akron Beacon Journal wrote on January 6th, 2003, and I quote, ``Those who watch the Ohio court know Cook is no ideologue. She has been a voice of restraint in opposition to a court majority determined to chart an aggressive course, acting as problem-solvers more than jurists. In Deborah Cook, they have a judge most deserving of confirmation, one dedicated to judicial restraint.'' And the Columbus Dispatch wrote on January 6th, 2003, and I quote, ``Cook's record is one of continuing achievement. Since 1996, she has served on the Ohio Supreme Court, where she has distinguished herself as a careful jurist, with a profound respect for judicial restraint and the separation of powers between the three branches of Government.'' Now, Mr. Chairman, these quotes are from papers across the political spectrum, all of which endorsed Justice Cook. As these comments make clear, Justice Cook is a talented, serious judge, who works diligently to follow the low. At the same time, she also dedicates, though, a great deal of her time to volunteer work and community service. Justice Cook has served on the United Way Board of Trustees, the Volunteer Center Board of Trustees, the Akron School of Law Board of Trustees, and the Women's Network Board of Directors. She was named Woman of the Year in 1991 by the Women's Network. She has volunteered for the Safe Landing Shelter and for Mobile Meals, and she has served as a board member, and then president, of the Akron Volunteer Center. Furthermore, Mr. Chairman, Justice Cook has served as a commissioner on the Ohio Commission for Dispute Resolution and Conflict Management, where she focused on, among other things, truancy, mediation for disadvantaged students. She has chaired Ohio's Commission on Public Legal Education and has taught continuing legal education seminars on oral argument and brief writing. I find it, Mr. Chairman, remarkable that Justice Cook has found time for this level of commitment to her community, and I have yet to describe the most amazing, to me, commitment Justice Cook has made helping the underprivileged in Ohio. Like many of us, Justice Cook believes that the ticket out of poverty is a quality education, and over the years Justice Cook, and her husband, in their everyday lives, have come across hardworking young people who are making an effort to improve their lives through education. Tasha Smith is one of those people. Justice Cook met her when she was struggling to put herself through college at Kent State by working as a waitress. Justice Cook assisted her with tuition for several years, and today this woman is in her final year of nursing school, carrying a 3.8 grade point average. Tara King is another of these students. With Justice Cook's help, she recently graduated from the University of Akron, and she just enrolled in graduate school at Cleveland State. After helping several students in this manner, Justice Cook and her husband decided they should structure their assistance so they could help more young people early on in their education. Four years ago, they started the College Scholars Program with a group of 20 disadvantaged third-graders from an inner-city school. The students were selected to participate based on teacher recommendations, financial need and level of family support. Justice Cook matched each of the students with a mentor in the community. The students met with their mentors weekly and participated in other program activities. If the students maintained good grades and conduct through secondary school, Justice Cook and her husband will pay for 4 years of their tuition in any public university in Ohio. Let me repeat that. Justice Cook is going to pay for 4 years of college tuition for 20--20--disadvantaged children. Now, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, these activities demonstrate a commitment to the community and dedication to helping the disadvantaged that we would like to see in everyone, and these are qualities that help make Justice Deborah Cook a fine judge. Now, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, let me turn my attention to another one of our fine nominees from Ohio, Mr. Jeff Sutton. Mr. Sutton, who is from Columbus, is here today with his family. I would like to introduce the Committee to his wife Peggy and their three children, Margaret, who is 6 years old; John, who is 9 years old; and Nathaniel, who just today is turning 11. Happy birthday, Nathaniel. I would like also to welcome Jeff's parents, Nancy and David Sutton, his sister Amy, his brothers Craig and Matt, and several additional friends and family. We are very pleased that all of you could be here on this very important day. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Sutton's legal and life experiences are extensive. A couple of years ago, before high school, his father took over--a couple of years before high school, his father took over a boarding school for children with severe cerebral palsy. Over 6 years, Mr. Sutton spent much of his time around the school doing odd jobs for his father. He was deeply affected by this experience and by the interactions that he had with these students during his formative years. It reinforced what he had been taught by his parents; that serving others is an important calling and virtue. Mr. Sutton attended Williams College, where he was a layman scholar and varsity soccer player. He graduated with honors in history, and after college, from 1985 to 1987, Mr. Sutton was a seventh grade geography teacher and tenth grade history teacher, as well as the high school varsity soccer coach and the middle school baseball coach. From there, he went on to law school and graduated first in his class from the Ohio State University College of Law, where he served as issue planning editor of the Law Review. Mr. Sutton clerked for Judge Thomas Meskill on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. He clerked for two U.S. Supreme Court Justices, retired Justice Powell and Justice Scalia. From 1995 to 1998, Mr. Sutton was the State solicitor of Ohio, which is the State's top appellate lawyer. During this service, the National Association of Attorneys General presented him with the Best Brief Award for practicing in the U.S. Supreme Court, a recognition he received an unprecedented 4 years in a row. Mr. Sutton is currently a partner in the Columbus law firm of Jones, Day, Reavis and Pogue. He is a member of the Columbus Bar Association, the Ohio Bar Association, and the American Bar Association. He has also been an adjunct professor of law at the Ohio State University College of Law since 1994, where he teaches seminars on Federal and State constitutional law. Recently, Mr. Chairman, the American Lawyer rated him one of its 45 under 45; that is, they ranked him, named him as one of the 45 top lawyers in the country under the age of 45. He has appeared frequently in court, having argued 12 cases before the United States Supreme Court, where he has a 9 and 2 record, with one case still pending. In the Supreme Court's 2000 to 2001 term, Mr. Sutton argued four cases. That is more cases than any other private practitioners in the entire country. Can we imagine preparing to argue one case before the Supreme Court, much less than four? And to no one's surprise, Jeff Sutton won all four. Mr. Sutton also has argued 12 cases before the Supreme Court, 6 cases before various U.S. Courts of Appeal, and numerous cases before the State and Federal trial courts. Over the years, Mr. Sutton has been the lawyer for a range of clients on a wide range of issues. Some of these cases are quite well-known. For example, he represented the State of Ohio in Flores v. City of Berne; the State of Florida in Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents; and the State of Alabama in University of Alabama v. Garrett. But, Mr. Chairman, I would like to tell the Committee about some less-well-known cases. He represented, as my colleague Senator Voinovich has indicated, Cheryl Fischer, a blind woman who was denied admission to a State-run medical school in Ohio because of her disability. He represented the National Coalition of Students with Disabilities in a lawsuit, alleging Ohio University was violating the Federal motor voter law by failing to provide their disabled students with voter registration materials. He filed an amicus brief in the Ohio Supreme Court, defending--defending--Ohio's hate crime statute, and he filed it on behalf of the NAACP, the Anti-Defamation League and other civil rights groups. He defended Ohio's minority set-aside statute against constitutional attack. He filed an amicus brief in the Sixth Circuit on behalf of the Center for the Prevention of Hand Gun Violence, defending-- defending--an assault weapon ordinance. He represented two capital inmates in State and Federal court, and he represented an inmate who brought a prisoners' rights lawsuit in the United States Supreme Court. Mr. Chairman, I am sure we will have the opportunity to go through these cases in some detail and many other cases, but I am confident the Committee will be impressed by Mr. Sutton's ability in representing these various clients in these cases. Like Justice Cook, and consistent with his upbringing, Mr. Sutton has found an extraordinary amount of time to give back to his community. Between a demanding law practice and time with his very young family, he serves on the Board of Trustees of the Equal Justice Foundation, a nonprofit provider of legal services to disadvantaged individuals and groups, including the disabled. He has spent considerable time doing pro bono legal work, averaging between 100 and 200 hours per year. He is an elder and deacon in the Presbyterian Church, as well as a Sunday School teacher. He participates in numerous other community activities, including I Know I Can, which provides college scholarships to inner-city children, and Pro Musica, a chamber music organization. He also coaches soccer and basketball teams. Finally, Mr. Chairman, I was struck by something I once read that Mr. Sutton wrote in the Columbus Dispatch about former Supreme Court Justice Powell. In describing Justice Powell's practical voice on the court, he wrote the following, and I quote, ``Justice Powell never lost sight of the context in which each decision was made and the people, the people, that it would affect. He believed in people more than ideas and experience, and experience, more than ideology, and in the end embraced a judicial pragmaticism that served the country well.'' Mr. Chairman, I believe this same description applies to Mr. Sutton. He will approach the bench in the same pragmatic, tempered and very thoughtful way. I appreciate the chairman's time, and I yield the floor. Chairman Hatch. Well, thank you. Thank you, Senator. We will call the three nominees, Hon. Deborah Cook Mr. John Roberts and Professor Jeffrey Sutton to the witness table, and if you will stand and raise your right hands. Do you solemnly agree to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so you help you God? Justice Cook. I do. Mr. Roberts. I do. Mr. Sutton. I do. Chairman Hatch. We will s"
