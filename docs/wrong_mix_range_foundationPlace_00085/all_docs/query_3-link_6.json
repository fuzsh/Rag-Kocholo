        "text": "Happy Anniversary to Tomorrow-R1! üõ∞Ô∏è üöÄ This month marks one year since Tomorrow.io's groundbreaking and historic launch of the world‚Äôs first commercially built weather-radar satellite. Tomorrow-R1 was our first successful on-orbit operation and marked the first step in deploying the Tomorrow.io constellation of active and passive weather sensors. This constellation will achieve breakthroughs in global weather forecasting and climate observation, bringing near real-time scans of precipitation and atmospheric profiles for any point on Earth. üåé Since our first satellite launch, we have seen and done even more exciting things. Here are the past year‚Äôs highlights: üöÄ The successful launch of our second satellite, Tomorrow-R2 (https://lnkd.in/g29jVnBh) üöÄTomorrow-R1 and Tomorrow-R2 capture precipitation scans from space (https://lnkd.in/gsq_NxCW) üöÄTomorrow.io delivers breakthrough satellite data with unprecedented accuracy (https://lnkd.in/gNYKD5Ms) These achievements would not have been possible without the tireless dedication and ingenuity of our brilliant Weather Science and Space & Sensors teams. Stay tuned for even more exciting space and weather updates from Tomorrow.io. The future is bright! #satellites #weatherintelligence #weatherresilience #weatherdata\n\nHave you heard of Hangar? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like Strava for pilots,‚Äù says founder Sam Sessler, whose app has gained thousands of users in just a few months.
