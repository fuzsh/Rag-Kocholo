        "text": "American industrial company\n\nVertiv is an American multinational provider of critical infrastructure and services for data centers, communication networks, and commercial and industrial environments.\n\nHeadquartered in Westerville, Ohio, Vertiv has ~27,000 employees worldwide,[3] doing business in more than 130 countries, and operating 23 manufacturing and assembly facilities.[4] The company has regional headquarters in: Bologna, Italy; Miami, Florida; Pasig, Manila, Philippines; Nanshan District, Shenzhen, China; and Mumbai, India.[5]\n\nHistory[edit]\n\n1946–1965: Capitol Refrigeration Industries[edit]\n\nVertiv began as Capitol Refrigeration Industries, established in 1946 by Ralph Liebert (1918–1984) in Columbus, Ohio. Liebert developed the first prototype precision air conditioner in his garage. In early 1965, the prototype was introduced to IBM in Chicago. Recognising the machine's potential, IBM arranged for Liebert to debut his invention at the World Computer Conference in Philadelphia.[6][7]\n\n1965–2000: Liebert Corporation[edit]\n\nMain article: Liebert Corporation\n\nLiebert Corporation was formed in 1965 with just five associates to pursue this fast growing market as the industry's first manufacturer of computer room air conditioning (CRAC) systems. Two years later, in 1967, Liebert made its first international move by setting up a Canadian distributor network. In 1968, the company moved into a new facility in Worthington, Ohio. As its business continued to grow, the company broke ground once again and moved into a 150,000 square foot facility in Columbus, Ohio. In 1977, Liebert launched Conditioned Power Corporation to design and manufacture power distribution, conditioning and monitoring systems for the data processing industry.[8]\n\nExpansion continued as Liebert broke ground for a second major manufacturing facility in Delaware, Ohio, in 1980. Ralph Liebert's son, Larry Liebert, took over the company as president in 1980 and served in this position until 1989. In 1981, Liebert became a public company, listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol LIEB. In 1983, Liebert acquired Franklin Electric subsidiary, Programmed Power Corporation, expanding the company's power division capabilities to include the design and manufacture of uninterruptible power supplies (UPS).[8] That same year, Liebert opened its first overseas production facility in Cork, Ireland.[6] Liebert Corporation was acquired by Emerson Electric in March 1987,[9] remaining a wholly owned subsidiary of Emerson.\n\n2000–2016: Emerson Network Power[edit]\n\nIn 2000, Emerson formed its Network Power (ENP) business unit, consolidating critical infrastructure technologies under a single brand. The following decade saw an expansion of ENP with various acquisitions. In 2001, the company increased is presence in Asia with the purchase of Avansys and formation of ENP India. ENP expanded its telecom industry solutions with the 2004 acquisition of Marconi outside plant and power system. In 2006, ENP acquired Germany-based Knürr, a leading provider of enclosure systems. In 2007, the Energy Logic energy efficiency model was developed and initially released.[10] Avocent and Chloride were acquired in 2009 and 2010 respectively.[11]\n\n2016–present: Vertiv[edit]\n\nIn December 2016, Platinum Equity acquired the ENP business from Emerson Electric in a transaction valued in excess of $4 billion, completed in December 2016. The company was rebranded as Vertiv. Emerson also retained a subordinated equity piece in the company.[12] Vertiv launched as a stand-alone business and announced the appointment of Rob Johnson as chief executive officer.[13][14] In 2017, Vertiv sold its ASCO power switch business to Schneider Electric for $1.25 billion.[15] The company made three acquisitions in 2018; Energy Labs, Geist and MEMS. Through a merger with a Goldman Sachs-led special purpose acquisition company, GS Acquisition Holdings, the company became publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: VRT) on February 10, 2020.[16][17] In 2021, Vertiv acquired E+I Engineering, a global provider of switchgear, busway and modular power solutions, for $1.8 billion.[18] In December 2023, Vertiv acquired CoolTera Ltd, a provider of coolant distribution infrastructure for data center liquid cooling technology, strengthening its thermal management portfolio for high density compute cooling requirements.[19]\n\nIn 2023, Vertiv's share price increased 252%, outperforming all companies in the S&P 500 index.[20] The company's market capitalization was valued at over $34 billion as of July 2024.[21]\n\nAcquisitions[edit]\n\nVertiv Date Company acquired Country Business Reference December 2023 CoolTera Ltd UK Liquid Cooling Infrastructure Solutions [22] November 2021 E+I Engineering Ireland Electrical Switchgear & Power Distribution Systems [23] December 2018 MEMS Power Generation UK Temporary Power Solutions [24] February 2018 Geist USA Rack Power Distribution Units (PDUs) [25] January 2018 Energy Labs USA Air Handling Systems [26]\n\nEmerson Network Power Date Company acquired Country Business Reference 2013 Advanced Protection Technology USA Surge Protection [27] 2012 Avtron Loadbank USA Load Banks & Testing Systems [28] 2010 Chloride Group UK Industrial Power [29] 2009 Avocent USA IT Management [30] 2008 Aperture USA Data Center Infrastructure Management [31] 2007 Stratos USA Radio Frequency & Optical Subsystems [32] 2007 Motorola Embedded Computing USA Enclosure Systems [33] 2006 Knürr AG Germany Enclosure Systems [34] 2006 Artesyn USA Embedded Power Conversion Technologies [35] 2005 Cooligy USA Microprocessor Active Cooling Technology [36] 2005 Chloride Telecom Systems France Telecom Power Systems [37] 2004 Midwest Microwave USA Microwave Connectors & Components [38] 2004 Marconi USA Outside Plant & Power Systems [39] 2004 Albér USA Battery Monitoring [40] 2001 Avansys China Power Conversion [41] 2000 Jordan USA Telecommunications Equipment [42] 2000 Ericsson Energy Systems Sweden Telecom Power Supplies & Systems [43]\n\nLiebert Corporation Date Company acquired Country Business Reference 1998 Nortel APS Canada Power Supply Systems [40] 1998 Hiross Italy Precision Environmental Control & Monitoring [40] 1998 Firetrol USA Electric & Diesel Fire Pump Controllers [44] 1997 Edco USA Low-Voltage Surge Protection Devices [45] 1996 HVM USA High Voltage Maintenance Services [44] 1995 eti/ERS USA Electrical Engineering & Testing [46] 1990 Control Concepts USA Transient Voltage Surge Suppression (TVSS) [47] 1988 ASTEC Power USA AC-DC & DC-DC Power Supplies [44] 1983 Programmed Power Corporation USA Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) [8]\n\nCurrent work[edit]\n\nVertiv's primary customers are businesses across three main end markets: data centers, communication networks and commercial & industrial environments.

Their joint objective over the next three years is to address the challenge of cooling high-density compute by integrating direct liquid cooling and immersion cooling into a single system. Vertiv was selected for its expertise in heat rejection technology.[54]\n\nIn December 2023, Vertiv announced its collaboration with Intel to provide pumped two-phase (P2P) liquid cooling infrastructure for the Gaudi3 AI accelerator.[55]\n\nIn March 2024, Vertiv joined the Nvidia Partner Network (NPN) as a Solution Advisor: Consultant partner.[56]\n\nCompetitors[edit]\n\nVertiv's competitors include Schneider Electric, Eaton, Legrand and Huawei.[57]\n\nBrands[edit]\n\nVertiv's brands include:[4]\n\nAlbér (Battery Monitoring)\n\nAvocent (IT Management)\n\nCybex (IT Management)\n\nE+I Engineering Group (Electrical Switchgear, Modular Power, Energy Management)\n\nEnergy Labs (Commercial and Industrial Thermal)\n\nGeist (Rack PDU)\n\nLiebert (AC Power and Thermal)\n\nNetsure (DC Power)\n\nPowerBar (Busbar Trunking)\n\nCorporate affairs[edit]\n\nLeadership[edit]\n\nSenior management[edit]\n\nGiordano Albertazzi became Vertiv's Chief Executive Officer on January 1, 2023,[58][59] following the departure of former CEO Rob Johnson.
