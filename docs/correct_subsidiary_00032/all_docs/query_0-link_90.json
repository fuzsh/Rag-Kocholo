        "text": "Phase change memory (PCM) is one of the leading candidates for neuromorphic hardware and has recently matured as a storage class memory. Yet, energy and power consumption remain key challenges for this technology because part of the PCM device must be self-heated to its melting temperature during reset. Here, we show that this reset energy can be reduced by nearly two orders of magnitude by minimizing the pulse width. We utilize a high-speed measurement setup to probe the energy consumption in PCM cells with varying pulse width (0.3 to 40 nanoseconds) and uncover the power dissipation dynamics. A key finding is that the switching power (P) remains unchanged for pulses wider than a short thermal time constant of the PCM ($\\tau$$_t$$_h$ &lt; 1 ns in 50 nm diameter device), resulting in a decrease of energy (E=P$\\tau$) as the pulse width $\\tau$ is reduced in that range. In other words, thermal confinement during short pulses is achieved by limiting the heat diffusion time. Our improved...\n\nThis paper presents a review on the progress of solid-state non-volatile memory device based on electric-pulse induced phase transition. This two-terminal memory device exploit the unique behaviour of chalcogenide semiconductors. The crystalline and amorphous states of chalcogenide glass have very different electrical resistivity. The amorphous, high resistance state represents a binary 0, while the crystalline, low resistance state represents a binary 1. The reversible phase transition between low-conductive amorphous state and high-conductive crystalline state is performed using electric pulses. Phase change memory technology has made rapid progress in a short period of time in terms of memory-cell size, data retention capacity, programming currents and endurance characteristics. The mechanisms responsible for the data loss and degradation of the memory has been discussed.\n\nPhase change memory is a non-volatile memory technology that utilizes the electrical resistivity contrast between resistive amorphous and conductive crystalline phases of phase change materials. These devices operate at high current densities and high temperature gradients which lead to significant thermoelectric effects. We have performed numerical modeling of electrothermal effects in p-type Ge2Sb2Te5 phase change memory structures suspended on TiN contact pads using COMSOL Multiphysics. Temperature dependent material parameters are used in the model. Strong asymmetry is observed in temperature profiles in all cases: the hottest spot appears closer to the higher potential end suggesting that the thermal profile can be significantly altered by the thermoelectric effects during device operation. Hence, thermoelectric effects need to be considered for device designs for lower power and higher reliability devices."
