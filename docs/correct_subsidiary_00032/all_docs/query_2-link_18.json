(USA) Inventor\n\nKoehler, Jonathan Gordon\n\nPetersen, Eric Paul\n\nAbstract\n\nA method of manufacturing a pressure sensor (56) for sensing a pressure of a process fluid includes obtaining a sensor body (114, 116) having a sensor cavity formed therein. A metal tube (94) is placed through an opening in the sensor body into the sensor cavity (132, 134). A rod (170) is placed through the metal tube (94) and into the sensor cavity. The sensor cavity (132, 134) is at least partially filled with a dielectric material (105) and the dielectric material (105) completely covers the metal tube (94) carried in the sensor cavity and a portion of the rod. The rod (170) is removed and thereby forming a dielectric passageway which is fluidically coupled to the metal tube (94). The sensor cavity (132, 134) is sealed with a deflectable diaphragm (106) which is configured to deflect in response to applied pressure from the process fluid. A differential pressure sensor (56) for sensing a differential pressure of a process fluid includes a sensor body (114, 116) having a sensor cavity (132, 134) formed therein is also provided.\n\nIPC Classes ?\n\nG01L 9/00 - Measuring steady or quasi-steady pressure of a fluid or a fluent solid material by electric or magnetic pressure-sensitive elements; Transmitting or indicating the displacement of mechanical pressure-sensitive elements, used to measure the steady or quasi-steady pressure of a fluid or fluent solid material, by electric or magnetic means\n\nG01L 13/02 - Devices or apparatus for measuring differences of two or more fluid pressure values using elastically-deformable members or pistons as sensing elements\n\nG01L 19/00 - MEASURING FORCE, STRESS, TORQUE, WORK, MECHANICAL POWER, MECHANICAL EFFICIENCY, OR FLUID PRESSURE - Details of, or accessories for, apparatus for measuring steady or quasi-steady pressure of a fluent medium insofar as such details or accessories are not special to particular types of pressure gauges\n\n2.\n\nMETHOD FOR FORMING A PATHWAY IN A PRESSURE SENSOR HAVING A GLASS TO METAL SEAL\n\nApplication Number 18153586 Status Pending Filing Date 2023-01-12 First Publication Date 2024-07-18 Owner Rosemount Inc.
