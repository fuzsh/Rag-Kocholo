        "text": "Greg is a Venture Partner with Advantage Capital. He serves on the boards of Hortau, Cultiva, Ocean Aero and NevadaNano. Prior to Advantage Capital, Greg was a Partner and founder of FA Technology Ventures, which funded successes like iRobot, E Ink, BinOptics, Softricity, CreditSights and A123. He served on the boards of BinOptics, Autotask, Softricity and Concentrix until their successful exits. He was also a board observer at CreditSights until its sale to Fitch.\n\nGreg has an extensive history in private equity investing and investment experience across every stage of the private equity life cycle, most recently as a founder and Managing Partner with FA Technology Ventures, a $100 million successful VC fund (top quartile performance per Cambridge Associates) that has been completely exited. Greg was a Managing Director and founder of Seacoast Capital (1994-2000), a $100 million growth equity fund. Prior to founding Seacoast, Greg managed a portfolio of financial assets for Signal Capital, a Sam Zell-backed fund that invested in a wide variety of assets and distressed securities. After the successful monetization of the Signal Capital portfolio, Mr. Zell became the lead investor in Seacoast.\n\nPrior to Signal Capital, Greg worked as a Principal at Capital Growth Partners, a middle market private equity firm focused on providing growth equity, and Venture Founders, an early-stage technology venture capital firm where he was involved with successful investments in Vicor (NASDAQ: VICR) and MatrixOne (which went public and was subsequently acquired by Dassault Systems in 2006). He started his career as an engineer and manager on the factory floor of General Motors, followed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), where he helped design state of the art manufacturing systems to rapidly scale mass production of VAX computers.\n\nGreg has an MBA from Harvard Business School and a Bachelor of Electrical Engineering from General Motors Institute (now Kettering University).\n\nA veteran of the private banking industry and a master of municipal finance, Krolicki began his career on Wall Street, subsequently working overseas in Europe and the Middle East. In the aftermath of a tragic airplane crash in 1990 involving Nevada’s State Treasurer-elect, an anticipated ninety-day temporary appointment to serve as Chief Deputy State Treasurer turned into a distinguished and high-profiled 24-year public service career with the state of Nevada. Krolicki, who has never lost an election for public office, won four statewide elections to Constitutional Office, twice as State Treasurer (1998 & 2002) and twice as Lieutenant Governor (2006 & 2010). He is the first individual in Nevada to be term limited twice.\n\nAs Lieutenant Governor, Krolicki was responsible for a broad array of critical duties on behalf of the state of Nevada, including serving as the Chairman of the Nevada Commission on Tourism (NCOT), Chairman of the Commission on Economic Development (NCED), President of the State Senate, Vice Chairman of the Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT), Vice Chairman of the Executive Branch Audit Committee, and Cabinet Member for two Nevada governors.\n\nDuring his eight years as Chairman of NCOT (2007-2015), Krolicki aggressively, innovatively, and collaboratively promoted Nevada’s world-class tourism industry to domestic and international markets. To retain his institutional experience and strategic relationships throughout the tourism and hospitality industries, Governor Brian Sandoval tapped Krolicki in 2017 to serve an additional four years on NCOT as a Commissioner (2017-2021). As Chairman of NCED for six years (2007-2013), Krolicki provided inspired leadership to Nevada’s formidable economic expansion and diversification efforts. He spearheaded legislation which helped Nevada earn the reputation as a preferred global location for new and expanding businesses. As President of the Nevada State Senate, Krolicki presided over four Regular Legislative Sessions and six Special Legislative Sessions, the latter category necessitated by issues ranging from state budget emergencies to locating Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada. By Gubernatorial Proclamation, Krolicki served as Chairman of the Nevada Sesquicentennial Commission (2013-2015), tasked with organizing the celebration of Nevada’s 150th Anniversary of Statehood.\n\nOn the national level, Krolicki received appointments from both the Bush and Obama Administrations to serve on the United States Intergovernmental Policy Advisory Committee (2003-2015), regularly advising the Office of United States Trade Representative on trade negotiations. Additionally, Krolicki served as Chairman of the International Committee of the National Lieutenant Governors Association (2010-2012) and as Chairman of the Republican Lieutenant Governors Association (2010-2013).\n\nAs State Treasurer, Krolicki’s duties were primarily focused on his responsibilities as the state’s Chief Banking and Investment Officer, overseeing all cash, investment, debt, and unclaimed property activities. He served as the Chairman of the College Savings Plans of Nevada, a Member of the State Board of Finance, and a Member of the Executive Branch Audit Committee. Krolicki was responsible for a legacy of notable accomplishments on behalf of the state, including Nevada becoming the first state to receive the “Certificate of Excellence in Investment Policy” and obtaining the first-ever upgrade to the state’s credit rating since original assignment in the 1960s. He is particularly proud to have created the Nevada Prepaid Tuition Program and the College Savings Plans of Nevada (both highly successful 529 Qualified Tuition Programs) and to have been entrusted by Governor Kenny Guinn in 2001 to design, roll out, and administer one of the most consequential programs in Nevada’s history – the Guinn Millennium Scholarship Program.\n\nKrolicki was honored with the following national recognitions during his tenure as State Treasurer: selection by his peers in 2004 as the “Nation’s Most Outstanding State Treasurer” (Unruh Award); selection by the municipal industry in 2004 to be the annual recipient of the national award for “Excellence in Public Finance” (Gritz Award); and election as President of the National Association of State Treasurers (NAST) in 2003. Krolicki chaired the following NAST Committees: Corporate Governance (2002-2007); Legislative (2003-2005); Credit Rating & Debt Management (2000-2001); National Institute for Public Finance (1999-2007); and was the Founder & Chairman of the NAST Foundation (2002-2007). Previously, Krolicki served as the Secretary to the Nevada State Board of Finance (1991-1999) and President of the Nevada Government Finance Officers Association (1997-99). He was recognized in 1996 by the Association of Government Accountants as a “Certified Government Financial Manager.” Krolicki continues to be associated with NAST, serving in 2022 as Chairman of the NAST Corporate Affiliate Advisory Board of Directors – whose membership is comprised of individuals from the leading financial firms in the country. He was honored in 2022 as NAST’s “Corporate Affiliate of the Year.”\n\nKrolicki voluntarily stepped away from elected office in 2015, actively returning to his roots in the banking and finance industry. He is also leveraging his decades of professional experiences, financial skills, and networking to board rooms around the globe – serving on public corporate, private corporate and not-for-profit boards of directors in the United States, Asia, and Europe. Krolicki continues to dedicate himself to various causes for which he is passionate: hosting elite world sporting events in Las Vegas (the Men’s World Curling Championships in 2018 and 2022); working with the International Olympic Committee in Lausanne, Switzerland (since 2016 he has twice been elected to serve as a Member on the Executive Committee of the World Union of Olympic Cities); education (Founding Board Member of the Davidson Academy since 2006 – a Reno-based charter school for profoundly gifted students which in 2022 was ranked the #1 Best Public High School in America); and the Rodel Fellowship (selected in 2007 to this ongoing Aspen Institute Leadership Fellowship Program recognizing the nation’s rising political leaders).\n\nKrolicki continues his public service on behalf of the state of Nevada, having been appointed to the five-member Nevada Gaming Commission by Governor Joe Lombardo in February 2023 to a term expiring in 2025. Krolicki was also elected in 2023 by his global peers to serve on the Board of Trustees of the International Association of Gaming Regulators.\n\nKrolicki is a graduate of Stanford University, and is a long-time resident of Lake Tahoe, Nevada.\n\nPaul Grinberg has been a senior strategic and financial leader for more than 35 years across a range of industries, including financial services, specialty finance, distressed asset investing, banking and technology.
