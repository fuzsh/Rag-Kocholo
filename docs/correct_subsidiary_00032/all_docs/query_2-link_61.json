The annual Movie Awards season, that culminated in the Hollywood Oscars in February, meant that as always we saw lots of our favorite screenstars in their finery. In watching them, I was reminded of my two colleagues who recently picked up Awards for MAD Products – John Wilson in Las Vegas, received an LED Sapphire Award for our unique T3Ster, TeraLED and FloEFD LED Module lighting design & test suite, and Mike Fletcher in London at the NMI Awards for our 1500A Power Tester power electronics thermal cycling hardware solution in 2014 (page 9). The teams within our “factory” helped conceive, deploy, promote and deliver these unique new product offerings. I therefore view these Awards as a ringing endorsement of the strategies we have employed in those markets over the last few years and to the efforts of my development colleagues in Budapest and Moscow in particular. Indeed, 2014 was our best ever year for a number of our product lines: the MicReD team’s launch of the Power Tester 1500A/3C meets the needs of the power electronics market such that we have announced this year a new 12 channel version (page 8) to cope with mass IGBT thermal cycling and lifecycle testing demands; and our Flowmaster product line enjoyed its best year and continues to grow its breadth of capabilities and leading edge accuracy. And while we are talking about awards and recognition, the Harvey Rosten Award for Thermal Excellence was recently won by Cameron Nelson, Jesse Galloway, and Philip Fosnot of Amkor Technology (page 44) in this its 20th year of existence. At the SemiTHERM Show, Robin Bornoff and John Parry revealed what we affectionately call “Dolly the Heatsink” – a novel innovative way to couple design space exploration within FloTHERM simulations, and additive manufacturing 3D Printers to organically “grow” an optimal heatsink design for a given electronics cooling scenario. Robin and John have applied for a patent for this interesting invention and if you haven’t already read them, do check out Robin’s popular blog series on our website describing how they came to their invention. This to me feels like a brave new world for electronics cooling, and in particular for FloTHERM, but also for CFD simulation in general because of the coupling of design space exploration, thermal predictions and new manufacturing techniques. I salute my two colleagues for pushing the frontiers of the application of our technology to new and exciting areas. In this edition of Engineering Edge I have been taken by the article from my Russian colleague Tatiana Trebunskikh in association with a major Russian helicopter manufacturer, TsAGI, on the validation of a rotating helicopter blade inside FloEFD using our new sliding mesh capability. As a former helicopter pilot in my military days, and knowing how notoriously hard the compressible physics is to resolve, this is exciting and extends the code’s capabilities in the aerospace sector. It is great to see such good agreement to experiment. I also encourage you to read the great breadth of customer application stories in this newsletter - Flowmaster is well represented by ALBA in Spain for synchrotron cooling systems, ThyssenKrupp for submarine systems in Germany, and North China Electric Power simulations; Emerson Power in America; and FloEFD usage by Discom B.V. to model automotive exhaust gas systems to prevent hot spots. Finally, do check out our new product releases – FloTHERM XT V2 has been recently released, as well as the new 12 Channel MicReD Industrial Power Tester 1500A. The interview of Klaus Olesen at Danfoss in Germany illustrates his worldview for IGBT liquid cooling and showcases his world-leading ShowerPower® cooling system simulation in FloEFD. And not to forget my dear friend, Dr. Ivo Weinhold, who draws on his quarter century of experience to outline what he sees as “The Third Wave of CFD” related to the demands of user experience in modern software.

Further enhancements in follow up releases have been made to provide a comprehensive means of generating surfaces that accurately represent the performance of a 1D thermo-fluid simulation model. While each surface represents only a single performance characteristic, multiple surfaces can be used together to provide a whole array of results in a detailed meta-model. The obvious advantage of doing this is that the simulation results can be obtained very quickly, because the detailed calculations do not need to be evaluated. Instead, the user defined boundary conditions are used to evaluate the response surfaces, to provide the system performance results. Related to this is the fact the meta-model does not require a great deal of computing power. This truly opens the door for the use on mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets. EnginSoft S.p.A In their Summer 2014 newsletter, Alberto Deponti and Edoardo Di Lorenzo of Enginsoft S.p.A, Italy, showed how to create a smart phone application that could evaluate a predefined meta-model of a cooling system. The example had four user inputs and can provide three system performance results. The inputs can be adjusted using slider bars for quick changes and the user can see the results of the changes on the same screen. This is a relatively simple example of what could be done and with the flexibility of the response surface creation the complexity of the system that can be run on a mobile device is only limited by the number of inputs the user would want to vary. The question is: Is this something that an engineer would really use in their day-to-day work environment? To answer that just look around you and see how mobile devices are used by many people as a tool to help them. From the package delivery people who have handheld devices to scan and track your packages, which provide you real-time updates on the status of your delivery, to F the sales person who can process your sale without having to go to a computer terminal or cash register. It is quite easy to see how this similar technology can and is being used in the engineering field. Consider this example, a chemical processing facility uses steam at various locations in the plant for heating the chemicals being manufactured. Since the plant has a limitation on how much steam it can produce, the facility engineer needs to know the impact on the system when he makes changes to the demand on the steam at different locations in the plant. If he has a process that requires heating which is further from the steam source, it will have more pressure drop than processes that are closer, therefore, he has to manage the flow control valves to ensure that he is maintaining a high enough pressure to deliver enough steam to the far process while still providing adequate steam to the other processes. He has three ways he can do this: 1. Trial and Error – keep adjusting the valves manually until he gets the required steam flow and pressure. 2. Run a simulation at his desk – return to the office and pull up his simulation software and run the simulation to determine proper valve positions and then return to the plant and make the adjustments. 3. Run a simulation on his mobile device at the plant – enter the required flow rates on his mobile application and have the proper valve setting within seconds. The time and cost saving can be significant by simply being able to make an accurate design and act on it quickly. In commodity markets, like the chemical industry, halting production for even an hour can have a considerable effect on margins. This is just one example and there are many others where this technology can and will be used in the future. With its response surface capabilities, Flowmaster is well positioned to allow its end users to make better decisions faster, by allowing them to put the information they need, in the mobile device they have in the palm of their hand.\n\n6. 6 mentor.com/mechanical New Release: FloTHERM® XTV2 ollowing on from the successful launch of the FloTHERM XT V1 series, we now have a significant update of the product line to announce for the V2 series. Over the coming months, the FloTHERM XT V2 series will provide crucial updates and innovation in core technology, parametric analysis, EDA synchronization and user experience. Core Technology We are introducing an update to our state- of-the-art solver, along with appropriate UI and data model support for time-varying analyses across all electronics thermal applications. The software has a number of new features in support of transient analysis, including: • Transient attributes attachable to objects. F • Both automatic and manual time step definition. • Post-processing features for both graphical and tabular output have all been appropriately updated. • Created or imported profiles, plus standard function definitions. The other primary core technology update in the V2 series is general Joule Heating support. This is designed as a complete analysis platform for predicting current density, electric potential and associated Joule Heating effects in complex electronics PCB’s and other high power devices and is of particular importance in the automotive and power electronics sectors. Joule Heating is automatically activated with any valid definition of an electrical circuit on electrically conducting solid objects and after solution, several new data fields are available for post-processing graphically, via the data inspectors and report generation: electrical potential, current density, Joule Heating and electrical resistivity.\n\n7. mentor.com/mechanical 7 News Parametric Study The FloTHERM XT V1 series supported the use of configurations for manipulating CAD dimensions and mates. In the V2 series, we are introducing a new integrated environment for defining, solving and analyzing results for parametric variations of geometry, attributes (e.g. material, thermal) and solution parameters. The new user interface supports the variation of model input variables of any type and comparison between scenarios using goals. The post-processing scene and data inspector views are automatically updated when moving between scenarios and the report generation has been updated to support output of the scenario table. EDA Synchronisation FloTHERM XT continues to develop its best- in-class capabilities in interfacing with the EDA world. The new release, is introducing an ODB++ import capability, with full support for the board outline, component layout, layer stack up and metallic distribution on all layers. This means that we can now support data input from non- Mentor Graphics layout tools, thus making it easier for customers to use the tool of their choice and expand use of existing data. • Capture Display Area – a new screen grab feature; • Goals redesign with filtering and column ordering; • Command-line solve support; and • Smart Legends providing direct access to change settings via the graphics display area. The FloTHERM XT V2 series is a very significant update over V1 and provides an unrivalled, broad- based design environment for electronics thermal applications across all sectors. In so doing, it continues to build on our strengths of seamlessly working with MCAD data, synchronization with the EDA world and an evolving user environment based on customer feedback. User Experience Building on the feedback from our customers using the V1 series, we have also significantly updated the software in a number of areas, including: • A new Project Tree, with column based informational feedback on powers and attribute attachments; In addition, it is now possible to import a board and component layout and modify the data for position, size, orientation, shape and modeling level prior to transfer to FloTHERM XT. The V2.2 release will also have a new modeling level option to represent the PCB copper nets and traces in full 3D detail, important for high power applications involving Joule Heating effects or when higher-fidelity solutions are required for critical devices on the board. • Advanced modeling diagnostics using Check Geometry and Leak Tracking features; • FloEDA bridge power mode support for steady-state and transient analyses;\n\n8. 8 mentor.com/mechanical Mentor Graphics Announces Customer Support Expansion e continue to evolve the CSD organization by expanding our range of Productivity Services, developing our Tiered Support offerings, and accelerating the roll out of On-Demand Training. Given this context, now is the right time for us to introduce a new identity that communicates the broader services portfolio we provide.

With over 100 products nominated across 13 categories, the winners were announced at a gala evening in Las Vegas. Products were benchmarked against a virtual perfect product in each category and then rated on a scale of zero to five Sapphires. Fractional scoring was allowed to help further differentiate products in each category. According to Maury Wright, Editor in Chief at LEDs Magazine, “for a score in excess of three Sapphires, the judges were asked to M consider to what degree the entry could deliver outstanding performance.” The unique combination of T3Ster, TeraLED and FloEFD was given four Sapphires. One of the judges even noted that the suite comprises an “excellent complete temperature analysis and simulation system”.

Partly on one hand, this is owing to the high number of integrated systems and parts and on the other hand because of the low numbers of boats ordered by a customer. The combination of these facts and the very steady process in the defense-business E Designing a Modern Submarine By T. Zikofsky,ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems The challenges faced by ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems, overcome by Flowmaster® 10 mentor.com/mechanical Figure 1. HDW Class 212A submarine U34 (Photo Courtesy of ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems) makes it difficult for the engineers to improve systems during an ordered batch. Therefore a well developed 1D CFD tool is needed to acquire all the necessary information for the design process and to ensure the system behavior is defined before the first submarine is commissioned. Flowmaster provides the functions that help engineers to find the best and most effective solution for pipe design and the needed power consumption of pumps. With this software you are able to calculate pressure drops, NPSH-values, flow rates, fluid velocities, oscillations etc. and furthermore, it is possible to calculate the heat transfer between solids and fluids (interaction). This article outlines the challenges engineers are faced with in the design process of one of the most complex machines man can build. It will also provide insight as to how Flowmaster is used in the ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems submarine yard in Kiel, Germany.\n\n11. mentor.com/mechanical 11 Defense Figure 2. Conventional Submarine The Conventional Submarine A modern conventional submarine uses a non-nuclear air independent propulsion system (AIP) based on a diesel fuel cell combination. The tactical advantages of this system are very low heat and acoustic signatures combined with the ability to stay submerged for long periods. In 2013 the German Navy submarine U32 set a new world record by staying fully submerged longer than ever before, during its trip from Germany to the east coast of the USA. seawater systems, fuel-cell systems, ballast system, freeing and compensating systems, fuel oil system, chilled water system, weapon compensating system, fire-fighting system, etc. Of course, all systems have to be robust and reliable because the conditions at sea can be rough and sometimes hostile, even without battle scenarios. Simulation of Cooling Systems There are two simulation scenarios in submarine systems: 1. Checking the performance of an existing system and 2. Designing a completely new one. The first way is the easiest because, in most cases, there are normally existing CAD-data or isometric drawings of the pipe routing so that the network can be built very quickly. The second way is more difficult because the final routing of the pipes is not clarified in detail. The engineer has to estimate the future routing and has to calculate possible failures. The timescale of a project makes it necessary to order the pumps a long time before the piping arrangement is finished, so the second way must be used. Building up numeric networks is always a question of time and money. Usually a simple network will be chosen to shorten the time of getting a first solution. If one needs an exact solution or a lot of additional features, you have to invest much more time in describing the model and of course the time necessary for transient simulations will increase. In general, it is possible to generate a network according to the specification with a detailed scale of 100%. The fluid systems of the modern HDW Class 212A and 214 Submarines are integrated with nearly 3000 valves and many kilometers of pipeline. These systems are divided into single sub- systems such as cooling At ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems the networks are used for: • Calculating duty points of pumps; • Calculating NPSH-values; • Simulating interferences during changes in rotating speeds of pumps (oscillations); • Checking the thermo management of the system; • Gathering all information of valve positions for the technical manual; • Checking the flow speeds in the pipelines according to mechanical and acoustic boards; and • Calculating the fill quantity of the pipe system to support the weight calculation of the submarine. All before the submarine is to be commissioned, necessary to save time and money. System Complexity Currently ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems simulates systems that use water, seawater, fuel oil, air, ideal gas, oxygen and hydrogen as working fluids. For this, and in order to use the internal pipe standard of different Figure 3. Part of a Network of a Complex Cooling System\n\n12. 12 mentor.com/mechanical pipe diameters, materials, pump curves, pressure drops of valves, flaps and filters are saved in Flowmaster. This makes it easier to define a complex network and to set the necessary boundary conditions. In some networks more than 1,100 components are used. Figure 3 shows a network with a large number of components. It is possible to calculate the required pump dimension and the fluid distribution in the different flow paths with this system. It is also possible to calculate the temperatures in the pipes because of the thermal heat duty in the heat exchangers. A special feature while using a transient solver is changing the opening position of single valves during the running simulation, so that one can see a live reaction of the system. Transient Scenarios In each operating condition of the submarine, the installed cooling pumps have to support a different flow rate. With Flowmaster it is possible to define single operating set-ups for use in parametric studies. Figure 4 shows an example of such a result plot of a transient interference analysis. According to the specification for this cruising condition, pump no. 1 has to provide a constant flow rate although the pumps no. 2, 3 and 4 are starting. It becomes obvious that with the current pipe configuration pump no.1 will not be able to provide the needed flow rate without increasing its rotating speed. With this information the required pump speed of pump no. 1 can be calculated and the best steering and automatic engineering concept for each cruising condition can be found. Figure 5 shows a network of an exhaust gas system for the diesel generator during submerged cruising condition. Some pipes of the system are flushed with seawater at the exterior wall and some parts are isolated. With this configuration it is possible to calculate the heat exchanges between the pipelines and the sea and also to calculate the temperatures of the exhaust gas in the pipes. Conclusion Numerical system simulations in the design process of submarines are a good tool for engineers to find the best solution for a fluid or piping system layout within a minimal amount of time. Flowmaster is the tool of choice for ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems for system analysis. It is also possible to support the submarine crew to find the best system setting by calculating valve positions or pump rotating speeds offline. With the Flowmaster software and the SQL-database a large number of engineers can also work in parallel on a large project, improving efficiency and reducing the design cycle. Figure 4. Post Processing Example: Interference Analysis for Complex Pump Systems Figure 5. Exhaust Gas System Network during Submerged Cruising Condition\n\n13. mentor.com/mechanical 13 Automotive Avoiding Hot Spots n their 30 years as designers and suppliers of exhaust gas systems, Discom B.V. have seen the requirements regarding noise and emissions change and tighten considerably. Investment in research and development is therefore critical to creating new designs and ensuring the continued success of the company. The challenges they face come not just from meeting or exceeding regulatory requirements, but also to ensure that the systems offer high reliability over their design lifetime. These requirements are made more complex due to the need to ensure that the final design can be practically installed and maintained within the often tight spaces set aside for them. Given these requirements, it’s essential that the tools that support the design process are integrated within the overall suite used, and can provide clear and reliable results with the minimum of user intervention. It’s for these reasons that FloEFD, operated by HEC on behalf of Discom, can prove so valuable. For instance, when considering the lifetime estimation of thermal loading on an exhaust silencer for a train, the CAD embedded nature of FloEFD allowed for even this complicated geometry to be prepared and discretized with minimum effort. The results from the simulation can then be fed in to the structural finite element package to define the boundary conditions for the resulting simulations. Underpinning all such work are two key aspects of the FloEFD package: a comprehensive materials library, which allows for the thermal properties of both metals and insulation materials to be accounted for. In addition, an advanced I Discom B.V. use FloEFD™ to ensure Temperatures are kept within Bounds radiation model allows for the effects of these materials, their surface finish and even solar radiation to be accounted for. When such detail is applied alongside a detailed CAD model, it is easy to identify and predict individual hot-spots should they occur. Being able to do all this ‘upfront’ in a virtual environment ensures that the optimum configuration can be derived before any metal has been cut. For more information: www.discom.eu Figure 1.

Discom B.V. headquarters in The Netherlands\n\n14. 14 mentor.com/mechanical he ShowerPower® liquid cooling heat exchange turbulator (Figure 1) was designed in 2005 by Danfoss GmbH engineers to efficiently cool IGBT power modules. The driver at the time was the fact that every electronic circuit generates heat during normal operation (except perhaps for superconductivity scenarios which are rare in industrial situations). This heat generation is due to conductive and switching losses in active devices as well as ohmic losses in conductor tracks. And since every new generation of power semiconductors becomes smaller than the preceding one, and the market expects smaller and more compact solutions, the demands to be met by the thermal design engineer kept growing. Sufficient cooling of power electronics is therefore crucial for good operational performance. The dominant failure mechanisms in power semiconductor components are related not only to high absolute temperatures but to changes in temperature during cycling; temperature swings produce thermo- mechanically induced stresses and strains in the material interfaces of the components (that have mismatches in coefficients of thermal expansion) which in turn lead to fatigue failures. Liquid cooling of power electronics has been around for many years, primarily because of the ever-increasing power densities demanded, and due to the T mentor.com/mechanical 14 ShowerPower® Turbulator keeps IGBTs Cool availability of liquids in certain applications. Liquid cooling outperforms air cooling by producing heat transfer coefficients several orders of magnitude higher, thus enabling much higher power densities and more compact module and inverter solutions. The acceptance of liquid cooling varies from business segment to business segment. The automotive industry for example has been using liquid cooling FloEFD™ Efficiently Cools IGBT Power Modules for internal combustion engines for more than a century, so the idea of liquid cooling of power electronics in an automotive application is considered a non-issue. In other industries the idea of having fluids flowing through power electronic assemblies often finds resistance and concerns. The term “turbulator” for the ShowerPower is a little misleading: under normal flow conditions, liquid flow in the flow channels Figure 1. The general Danfoss ShowerPower® turbulator concept (cooling liquid in blue; warmed up liquid in red) By Klaus Olesen,Thermal Design Specialist, Danfoss Drives, Germany\n\n15. mentor.com/mechanical 15 is laminar; typical Reynolds numbers range around 500 and the transition into the turbulence regime occurs at a Reynolds number around 2,400. Liquid cooling solutions may be divided into two groups - indirect and direct liquid cooling. Indirect cooling means that the power module is assembled on a closed cooler, e.g. a cold plate. Cold plates may be manufactured by for example gun drilling holes in aluminum plates or by pressed-in copper tubes in aluminum extrusions. When dealing with cold plates it is necessary to apply a layer of TIM (Thermal Interface Material) between the power module and the cold plate. Direct liquid cooling on the other hand means that the coolant is in direct contact with the surface to be cooled. Here the cooling efficiency is improved by increasing the surface area and this is commonly done by various pin fin designs. Direct liquid cooling (Figure 2) eliminates the otherwise required layer of TIM. Because the TIM layer accounts for 30%-50% of the Rth, junction-coolant, this TIM-elimination results in an improved thermal environment for the power module. Since dominant failure mechanisms are temperature-driven, this will lead to higher reliability of the power module. The ShowerPower cooler assembly in Figure 2 is for a wind turbine application featuring seven P3 IGBT modules, turbulators, sealings and a manifold. The design ensures that all chips in all modules are cooled Overall, the ShowerPower concept has several inherent benefits: 1. The ability to homogeneously cool large flat baseplate power modules, and systems of modules, thereby eliminating temperature gradients thus improving life and facilitating paralleling of many power chips; 2. Eliminating the need for TIM - No TIM- related pump-out and dry-out effects; 3. A very low differential pressure drop, 4. Compact, low weight, high degree of design freedom enabling 3D designs; and 5. Low manufacturing costs: metal-to- plastic conversion into simple plastic Figure 2. Typical Danfoss ShowerPower® turbulators (blue) and liquid cooling base plate for seven P3 power electronics modules in parallel Figure 3. Typical Danfoss ShowerPower® liquid cooling CFD simulation of a Power Module geometry inside FloEFD for Creo Power Electronics equally efficiently. The concept enables tailored cooling if hot spots need extra attention; this is simply done by designing the cooling channels individually. For further information on the principles of ShowerPower please refer to References 1 and 2. The general ShowerPower plastic part (in blue) has several cooling cells in the X and Y directions and needs a manifold structure on the backside of the plastic part; this ensures that each cooling cell receives water at the same temperature. Since the P3 module is relatively long and narrow only one cell is necessary across the module; this makes the plastic part much simpler since the manifold structure on the backside becomes obsolete.\n\n16. 16 mentor.com/mechanical parts. Numerous CFD simulations and test measurements have been done over the years on various Danfoss ShowerPower designs to validate the concept and to extend it to niche and custom applications. Engineering simulations, (thermal, fluid, mechanical, stress, vibrational etc.) are a crucial part in any Power Module product development project, the obvious reason being, to reduce the number of time- consuming and costly experimental tests necessary. Computational Fluid Dynamics, CFD, is the best way to simulate a ShowerPower liquid cooling system. CFD will predict fluid flow so that the correct heat transfer rates and pressure drop conditions are found and thus the relevant temperatures, e.g. semiconductor junction temperatures are calculated and maintained. When designing a liquid cooled system in the FloEFD for Creo CFD package (Figure 3) we consider several issues in order to ensure a reliable solution that is capable of delivering the performance needed over the required lifetime of the system. We also consider other factors such as corrosion, “tightness”, sedimentation (including bio growth) and anti-freezing issues for instance. The permutations in the turbulator geometry are quite large: • Width of channel; • Depth of channel; • Height of bypass; • Amount of channels per meander; and • Channel cross section area to avoid the risk of blockage. Figure 4 illustrates such a CFD prediction for a typical ShowerPower application. With FloEFD we can easily create several Figure 4. Typical Danfoss ShowerPower® liquid cooling CFD simulation of a Power Module geometry showing sectional views of flow vectors and velocity magnitude contours. different simulation cases to allow the design engineer to make optimization judgements. Finding the best design out of many CFD cases is supported by effective parametric results comparison in the software. We are able to look at many different channel dimensions for a range of flowrates (Figure 5). FloEFD ultimately gives us predictions of the surface temperatures on the IGBT/ShowerPower system before we iterate to a final prototype and build and test it (Figure 6). References: 1. K.

Danfoss is headquartered in Denmark and is a $5.5Bn company. I work in the Danfoss Silicon Power GmbH, in Flensburg, Germany, a part of the Danfoss Drives divi- sion. In late 2014, Danfoss Power Electron- ics acquired Vacon a Finnish motor drives company. Now Danfoss is the second big- gest low-voltage motor drives manufacturer in the world. I am a thermal design special- ist, responsible for developing new cool- ing technologies for our power electronic components and systems. I cover thermal, thermo-mechanical and fluid dynamics simulation tools (FEM, CFD), power elec- tronics reliability and, lifetime assessment, from concept development to feasibility studies. Danfoss Silicon Power aims to be the best choice of power module supplier in the world with our off-the-shelf and custom- ized solutions. Q. You have worked for Danfoss for 25 years, what have been the major chang- es and trends you have experienced? A. When I started in 1990, Danfoss was vertically integrated with many factories for supporting processes like chemical treatment, plastic molding etc. This has changed dramatically in the last 10 years as we have become leaner and have focused on our core capabilities while outsourcing supporting processes. In Flensburg, we focus on getting the best thermal designs for our power modules and tailor solutions to customer applications. We find that the market expects a cost reduction each year for control electronics and computers. While chip manufacturers need to have smaller chips, each generation with more current going through them (in a power law relation- ship ). We are constantly challenged to deal with more heat, to manage in a shrinking space! In terms of applications for IGBTs, modern wind turbines are being designed for a lifetime of 15-20 years with the turbines expected to run 24 hours a day, 365 days a year when the wind allows. This cor- responds to 150-180,000 hours of service which is 10-20 times the lifetime expectancy challenge on next generation motor drives. Power densities are increasing each year. In the automotive sector with the increase in electrification of vehicles we are seeing de- mands for power electronics to be embed- ded in other components like gear boxes. This impacts their performance because of the aggressive environments they need to operate in and reliability is therefore key. I can also foresee whole new geometrical shapes and materials emerging from the 3D printing industry that we will have to deal with and even nanotechnology surface coat- ings for enhanced heat transfer will become a challenge for us over time. Q. Where do you see CFD going in the Power Electronics arena in future? A. In terms of computer-aided engineer- ing (CAE) tools generally, I see a trend towards CFD and FEM structural analysis tools merging and offering true concur- rent “multiphysics” solutions. Because electrical power losses lead to temperature effects (CFD) impacting structural deforma- tions and crack formation (stress analysis) which in turn impact power thermal and structural changes over the component’s lifetime – they’re all interlinked. I also foresee the need for more design of experiments in CAE modeling of power electronics - to yield a precise die position in a module or to simulate a particular gate drive switch- ing strategy. We will always need more and more simulations as early as possible in the design cycle. I think engineers in future will therefore need to be multi-talented, and in terms of CFD in particular, there will be an increasing need for early rough simula- tions to yield data to make faster and faster design judgements. Q. The other part of your job is Power Electronics Reliability – how do you see that relative to your thermal expertise? A. Yes, I cover lifetime assessment of IGBTs and this is becoming increasingly important as they run hotter and hotter in warmer am- bient conditions where reliability is mission critical. We do “Physics of Failure” using a combination of statistical analysis, simula- tion tools and physical testing. We work closely with local universities at Aalborg and Fraunhofer to develop better techniques. The cycling and drive cycling our products experience obviously has a profound effect on their reliability. A big challenge we face is the change in physical properties of our materials over time during normal operation, due to the power loads they have to sustain and impairments in thermal performance. for typical automotive IGBT applications and 3-5 times the expectancy for other industrial applications. To secure sufficient reliability over the expected life of any such critical system calls for an in-depth understanding of the relevant failure mechanisms and mis- sion profiles of the specific application. Q. You invented the Danfoss Shower- Power® – the leading IGBT Liquid Cool- ing equipment for Power Modules. How has IGBT liquid cooling evolved over the last 10 years and what’s next? A. With greater and greater quantities of heat needing to be removed from IGBTs we recognized some time back that an effective form of liquid cooling was neces- sary. The ShowerPower invention was our patented response. We used CFD to design this complicated heat exchanger unit that was introduced to the market in 2008. We verified the CFD results against university experimental test data. We custom design and manufacture ShowerPower that attach to IGBT modules to maintain a constant sur- face temperature for optimal performance. We guarantee thermal and structural reliabil- ity of our solutions for long warranty periods without failures of the cooling circuits. Q. How has your CFD design process evolved in the last 10 years? A. For a typical customer application we may need to do 50 or more CFD simulations to check for good fluid flow and heat trans- fer in the ShowerPower. Ideally we want to compress our design cycles further each year, whilst dealing with increasingly com- plex geometries. We chose FloEFD as our CFD design tool because we didn’t want to be CAD geometry and meshing jockeys. We wanted a tool that was user friendly, embed- ded in PTC Creo, our CAD tool, and accu- rate. I like FloEFD compared to other more complicated CFD tools because I can dip in and out of it all year with minimal effort to pick it up again. It’s also robust and easy to mesh our complex geometries inside Creo. Our ShowerPower product is the best com- promise between manufactured cost and homogeneous thermal performance with our use of aluminum heatsinks. We were the first to do effective liquid cooling and we intend to maintain our technical advantage. Q. What do you see as future megatrends and challenges in your area of Power Electronics? A. We are seeing bigger and bigger cities emerging all over the world with larger and larger electrical infrastructures that produce HVAC and power conversion challenges. Even the explosion of elevator and lift technology in tall city skyscrapers puts a Klaus Olesen,Thermal Design Specialist, Danfoss Drives\n\n18. 18 mentor.com/mechanical FloTHERM® - Powering Power Supply Development By John Parry, Electronics Industry Vertical Manager, Mentor Graphics A case study of Emerson Network Power he development of electronic devices has seen a trend towards their miniaturization and an increase in their functionality. Both of these put high demands on heat dissipation. High MOSFET temperatures can lead to instability, shortened life expectancy, and even lead to the device exploding! High temperatures can also contribute to thermal breakdown in electrolytic capacitors, dramatically shortening their life. While inductors and other magnetic components can withstand high temperatures, peripheral devices can be impacted. To ensure that the power devices operate effectively within a given temperature range, attention needs to be paid to a product’s thermal design. Reliable thermal design can guarantee the life and reliability of the product, and ultimately reduce costs in the long-term. T Emerson Network Power are a $6.2bn company with about 45,000 employees [1]. Thermal Management is a Center of Expertise that has been strengthened by the acquisitions of Liebert, Hiross, Cooligy and Knurr, to critical cooling issues at room, rack or chip level. Emerson take a holistic approach to thermal design, using FloTHERM from the chip package up to the room in which the equipment sits, to produce the best overall thermal design. This endeavor is greatly assisted by FloTHERM’s Cartesian meshing supporting localized mesh regions, allowing multiple length scales to be included within a single model. At the package level, Emerson aim to create a thermal model that is as close to reality as possible to help evaluate the transient response of their power electronics components with accurate junction temperature prediction – the goal of all thermal design studies. Figure 1. Emerson’s exclusive use of thermal simulation at all packaging levels At the PCB level, emphasis is placed on using the correct material property values, capturing the actual copper distribution in the board. Attention is paid to refining the mesh around large and high power components such as, MOSFETs, to accurately capture temperature gradients in both the air and the solid. Thermal radiation contributes to both heat loss and heat exchange between components, so radiation is also included in the calculation, so the surface emissivity of the components and board must be factored in. At the modular level, the environment is an important factor to capture in the simulation. In the case of a small sub-rack for example, which is cooled by natural convection, the ambient temperature can be 30°C. With stratification in the ambient air affecting the air flow through the enclosure, the simulation model must be extended to include the local environment. As the scale of the model increases, care is needed to preserve the fidelity of the modeling effort. Comparison with test data becomes tricky, as it is difficult to control the environment, particularly when testing products cooled by natural convection, as small drafts and other effects can affect the measurements. Integrating the electronics together at the cabinet level adds a new level of complexity to the simulations, as failures or disturbances in the power network can cause the supply voltage to drop. Under these circumstances, the power electronics must be able to function as normal to avoid an impact on downstream equipment.\n\n19. mentor.com/mechanical 19 Electronics When operating in this manner, the power dissipation within the devices increases, leading to a further rise in temperature within the components in just a few seconds, this must however, remain below the maximum operating temperature for the components. Emerson Network Power’s equipment can be used in multiple configurations and in a variety of environments, so there is considerable scope for equipment-to- equipment thermal interaction at the room level. In some installations, this is prevented by using a room-level cooling strategy, such as cold aisle containment in datacenters. To make the most efficient use of FloTHERM, Emerson use Mentor webparts [2] to define models of porous materials, centrifugal blowers, thermoelectric coolers (TECs), fans at high altitude, and complex geometry. In this way thermal simulation is repeatedly used to validate ideas during design and improve knowledge sharing with colleagues and other stakeholders. Figure 2. Stackup of Power Module showing die detail, and FloTHERM model Figure 3. PCB and FloTHERM simulation results Figure 4. Typical Module and Temperatures within a Sub-Rack Emerson also make extensive use of thermal measurements, including Mentor’s Transient Thermal Tester, T3Ster® , to obtain thermal data for components and heatsink thermal resistances, to increase the fidelity of their thermal simulation work – a practice that is becoming increasingly common in best-in-class companies.

This can lead to such wonderful phenomena as running across a pool of corn starch and water and such disappointing phenomena as a glob of ketchup (or mayonnaise) on your fries when you only wanted a dab. A common example of non-Newtonian fluids in industry can be seen in the manufacture of extrusion molding products, namely plastics and rubbers. Using FloEFD’s ability to create customizable fluids and system conditions, one is able to accurately model the appropriate viscous effects of using non- Newtonian fluids. When creating the new custom fluid, it is important to characterize the dynamic viscosity properly. This can be done either by setting up a data table of points showing dynamic viscosity versus shear rate or as a consistency coefficient and viscosity model (i.e. Herschel-Bulkley, Power-law, etc.). Upper and lower limitations on viscosity can also be added, if appropriate. The new, user-defined non-Newtonian fluid materials are added to the Engineering Database of FloEFD and can be assigned to projects. N Model Solve for an Extrusion Die Ask The GSS Expert Since many extrusion molding machines have thin channels through which the fluid flows, it is important to have a fine enough mesh resolution through these passages. This can be accomplished by setting a Local Initial Mesh in FloEFD and enabling the Narrow Channel Refinement option within the manual settings of the Local Initial Mesh. Typically, it is recommended to have at least four cells spanning the narrow channel or gap in order to accurately resolve the flow (Figure 2). In the example given here, we’re looking at combining two streams of the same non-Newtonian fluid to be passed through a die. This could easily be updated to model the combination or mixing effects of two different non-Newtonian materials by simply changing the fluid assigned to one of the inlet flow conditions. It should be noted, however, that if one is using two different fluids, it is possible to reach a situation where the pressure drop is near convergence, but one of the materials has not reached the outlet. To address this issue and speed up the simulation time it is necessary to pause the simulation and turn on the “flow freezing” option under the Advanced tab in the Calculation Control Options. One can specify parameters controlling the procedure of saving the CPU time by freezing (i.e., taking from the previous iteration) values of all flow parameters, with the exception of fluid and solid temperatures and fluid substance concentrations, which converge more slowly than the other flow parameters, so the temperature and concentrations are calculated at each iteration. This option is useful because we have a time-dependent problem with substantial heat transfer and fluid substances propagation. One also has the option of periodic or permanent flow freezing. In the case of two fluids, it can be difficult to assess how many iterations would be needed to allow the penetrating material to fully propagate through the model, so setting the flow freezing option to permanent may be the better choice. Kate Boyd, Corporate Application Engineer How to use FloEFD™ ’s Customizable Fluids and Flow Freezing Features to Model Non-Newtonian Fluids Figure 1. An Extrusion Die Machine Figure 2. Mesh Resolution Across Small Gaps\n\n21. mentor.com/mechanical 21 Once the penetrating material has reached the outlet of the model, flow freezing can be switched off and the model analysis allowed to continue until convergence of all parameters is reached. Back to our one fluid model, having created a suitable mesh, defined the non-Newtonian fluid materials as described above and applied the necessary boundary conditions, the analysis is ready to be started. The volume of the fluid cavity is initialized with 100% of the non-Newtonian fluid. The inlet conditions are specified as mass flow boundaries where the material is released independently in two separate inlets. After about 200 iterations, the model is converged. Looking at our results using the Flow Trajectories function, we can see that the fluid trajectory's results are just as we would prefer (or expect) them to be as visualized through the inlets and the die (Figure 3). However, we notice some areas of higher velocity which require further inspection (Figure 4). Using the cut plot feature of FloEFD, we inspect the local velocities in the areas of interest. We are interested in areas of high velocity gradient because we don’t wish for the consistency of our material change during the extrusion process. Areas of high velocity gradient could be indicative of areas Figure 3. Flow Trajectories through the Model Figure 4. Local Velocities around the Rear Fluid Inlet with a high shear stress and thus run the risk of our materials seizing or becoming too thin. Figure 5 shows the local velocities around the rear fluid inlet. While there is some gradient, it should be easily remedied with some simple geometry changes. Figure 6 shows the local velocity magnitude distribution at the outlet cross-section around the die. Here we see much higher gradients through the die which are completely unacceptable. One of the main goals of the design process related to the extruder model is to achieve a more uniform distribution at the outlet so as to avoid the risks of having areas of high shear stress, as mentioned earlier. By using the various capabilities of FloEFD, we were able to accurately capture the fluid flow through the extrusion machine and thus reach the conclusion that further refinement or tooling of the machine is needed in order to ensure proper functioning. FloEFD can further be used in the continuation of the project to model design changes or variations, thus continuing to reduce the time and effort required to complete the project.

Made up of a complex network of electron accelerators that produce synchrotron light, it allows for the visualization of the atomic structure of matter as well as the study of its properties. The 3 GeV electron beam energy at ALBA is achieved by powerful combinations of a LInear ACcelerator (LINAC) and a low- emittance, full-energy BOOSTER located in the same tunnel as the STORAGE RING. ALBA's 270 meter perimeter has 17 straight A By Marcos Quispe,ALBA Synchrotron Light Source; Xavier Escaler and Montserrat Prieto, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC); and Morten Kjeldsen, Flow Design Bureau AS After five years in operation, the ALBA Synchrotron Light Source realize the first upgrade process of its cooling system. sections all of which are used for the installation of insertion devices. ALBA currently has seven operational state- of-the-art phase-I beamlines, comprising soft and hard X-rays, which are devoted mainly to biosciences, condensed matter (magnetic and electronic properties, nanoscience), and materials science. Additionally, two phase-II beamlines are in construction (infrared microspectroscopy and low-energy ultra-high-resolution angular photoemission for complex materials). This large scientific infrastructure provides more than 5,000 hours of beam time per year for the academic and the industrial sector, serving over 1,000 researchers every year. ALBA is a facility committed to scientific excellence and to improving the well-being and progress of society as a whole. After five years in operation, the ALBA Synchrotron Light Source has realized the first upgrade process of its cooling system. The main objective of the project was to enhance the hydraulic plant and its control system. Specifically, this enhancement is expected to significantly improve the Figure 1. Alba 3rd Generation Synchrotron Light Facility in Barcelona, Spain\n\n23. mentor.com/mechanical 23 Research facility’s reliability by providing more protection against single point failure, its stability as a result of more robust in- front-of-load variations and/or external perturbations, and tolerability in fail mode to ensure maximum service readiness. To embark on this objective a Project Manager structure was defined and all the activities were grouped in the following five work packages (WP) as detailed in Figure 1. This article will focus on Work Package 1 (WP1) which set out to better understand the cooling system from a fluid dynamics control point of view. The ALBA Cooling System The ALBA cooling system is outlined on the left of Figure 2 and comprises two main parts: production and consumption. For the purposes of this article, the focus will be mainly on the consumption side which is composed of four rings that require refrigeration. They are named Experimental Area (EA), Service Area (SA), Storage Ring (SR), and Booster (BO) as indicated on the right of Figure 2. Both the Storage and the Service Area rings operate with a pair of twin-pumps mounted in parallel and the rest Figure 1. Organization of work packages for the project “ALBA Cooling System Upgrade”. Figure 2. Outline of the cooling system (left) and of the consumption side (right) with a single pump. The deionized water is heated through all the rings and is collected in a common return line. Another pump (P11) takes the heated water from the return and feeds heat exchangers that cool it. The cooled water is brought to a large volume accumulator from which a suction line takes water again to the rings’ pumps. In order to regulate the water temperature, a series of controlled mixing valves allow for the combination of the cooled and heated water to take place, prior to being pumped to the rings. Moreover, a pressure maintenance system with a compressor is mounted at the exit line of the heat exchangers before the accumulator. Finally, a pipe line connecting the accumulator with the common return line enables the compensation for the lack or excess of flow to the cooling loop when the total flow rate changes in the rings’ loops. The Rings Model As can be seen in Figure 2, each ring (EA, BO, SR and EA) consists of two concentric ring-shaped pipelines (inlet and return flow) that refrigerate a specific number of sub- systems. At the same time, most of these sub-systems are made up of additional sub- networks that supply the cooled deionised water to final consumptions. Currently, Experimental Area Ring feeds nine sub-systems, seven of which correspond to Beam Lines (each Beam Line has various components to refrigerate) and the rest are provisional by-passes. The Booster Ring has 104 sub-systems. One of them is a Radiofrequency Cavity (RF) that refrigerates 14 components by the means of a manifold. The remaining 103 sub-systems are single electromagnets which are present in eight variations. With regards to the Storage Ring’s sub-systems, 21 are different types of electromagnets (8 to 17 magnets are fed by each sub-system), ten are Front Ends (each one cools one to five consumptions), and three correspond to RFs Cavities. In relation to the Service Area Ring’s sub-systems, nine supply cold water to Power Supplies, one feeds the LINAC and some Power Supplies and the last four sub-systems are connected to RFs Plants. The rings’ models have been built up from the available components in Flowmaster\n\n24. 24 mentor.com/mechanical software. The properties of each component have been selected based on the information provided by the corresponding manufacturer in the form of construction planes, technical documentation and so on. The lack of reliable information has been overcome with visual inspections and measurements in-situ. However, for the current study such level of detail has not been achieved on each ring due to their dense and complex structure as well as owing to the lack of time. As a result, the selected rings’ sub-systems to model with detail, according to the needs of the ALBA Synchrotron, are as follows. The completely modeled sub-system of the Experimental Area Ring is one Beam Line (BL). Nevertheless, the by-pass piping networks for two future BLs have also been modeled, and the remainder ignored. The different consumptions of these BLs have been simplified with a unique heat exchanger. When considering the Booster Ring’s sub- systems, all have been modeled down to the last detail. For instance, the top of Figure 3 shows the modeling of the two main pipes of the Booster Ring and nine of its sub- systems (eight electromagnets and the RF Cavity); with bottom of Figure 3 depicting this section. Another example is the model of the RF Cavity which is shown in Figure 4 where we can see the configuration of the manifold which supplies water to 14 local consumptions. In contrast, the Storage Ring’s fully modeled sub-systems are only four: one is the secondary distributor at sector 15 (which is grouping 16 electromagnets) and the other three are RFs cavities. Again, the geometry of the pipelines of the rest of the sub-systems has not been considered. In addition, the combination from one to five consumptions of each Front End has been modeled with a single heat exchanger. Despite this, a characterized heat exchanger element models each one of the various consumptions fed by the rest of the simplified sub-systems. The Service Area Ring’s are two detailed sub-systems: the RF Plant at sector 14 (see Figure 3. Comparison between a section of the Booster Ring (bottom) and its modeling (top) Figure 4. Schematic of the Radiofrequency Cavity of the Booster Ring\n\n25. mentor.com/mechanical 25 blue highlighted zoom of Figure 5) and the sub-system that combines the LINAC and some Power Supplies. A duly characterized heat exchanger element models each one of the different consumptions of these two sub-systems. Once again, the geometry of the other two RFs’ manifold and of the pipelines of the rest of the sub-systems has not been modeled. A heat exchanger emulates not only the two simplified RFs’ components but also the combination of Racks refrigerated by each one of the rest of the sub-systems (see green highlighted zoom of Figure 5). The contrast between the detailed and simplified sub-systems can be observed in Figure 5. Furthermore, Figure 6 demonstrates how meticulous the modeling of one RF’s consumption is. Improving Pipe Velocity Distribution Originally, the four rings had the same flow distribution: (i) the inlet flow was equally distributed to the left and right branch through a T-junction, by opening the two exit valves so that they tend to converge towards the opposite 180º ring location; (ii) for the return flow, the directions were reversed and two flows tend to converge towards the main outlet pipe. This original flow distribution is indicated as “180º circulation” on the left of Figure 7. This configuration causes the reduction of the flow velocities, as the two inlet flows approach and a zero velocity point should be ideally achieved in some undefined location which is dependent on the local consumption distributions. Consequently, there is a risk of air accumulation in a zone that might be close to some critical Figure 5. Schematic of a section of the Service Area ring model Figure 6. Comparison between the real appearance (CAD pictures) and Flowmaster modeling of one the RF’s consumption Figure 7. Schematic of the 180º original flow distribution (left) and of the 360º current flow distribution (right) at Experimental Area ring. Research\n\n26. 26 mentor.com/mechanical sub-system. In order to improve the flow velocity distribution along the rings, it was considered to change the position of the valves by closing one valve of the T-junction exit branches and to force a 360º circulation as indicated on the right of Figure 7. According to the opening or closing of T-junction exit valves, it is possible to distinguish a total of five flow distributions in each ring (one of 180º and four of 360º circulations) as observed in Table 1. In summary, the Flowmaster software has been used to simulate all the possible configurations with the aim of establishing the existence of an optimal flow distribution that minimizes the locations with the lowest velocities. Accuracy of the Model A preliminary validation of the Flowmaster model has been carried out with the production side comprising the pumping units. For that, the simulated results have been compared with the real hydraulic variables like flow rates (Q), pump rotating speeds (n) and pump delivery pressures (Pimp). Table 2 shows the comparative studies for a real working point of the cooling system. For the overall variables of the hydraulic system, the maximum average deviation equals – 6.8% corresponding to pump rotating speeds. The deviation for the main flow rate at the rings is less than 0.1%. Regarding the rings and their previously described sub-systems, they obviously require a fixed flowrate to cool their consumptions. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the modeled rings, the simulated results (flow rate in each one of the sub-systems) have been compared with the on-site measured ones as indicated in Table 3 in terms of averaged deviations. It must be noted that some local sub-systems were presenting larger deviation values. It can be observed that the maximum average deviation for the simulated flow rates in three of the rings is about 6.5% corresponding to the Service Area. Nevertheless, the Booster Ring shows a larger deviation that can be explained by the fact that the measured data is not reliable due to a detected calibration problem of its flowmeter. As a result, the 23.7% deviation does not represent the actual goodness of the Booster Ring’s model. It must be noted that this flowmeter issue does not take place in the other three rings. The Optimal Flow Configurations The presence of air in pipelines may cause instabilities of the water flow. To avoid air problems in pipelines it is widely accepted that minimum flow velocities are required above 0.5 m/s. In this work the five possible flow distribution in the main pipe rings has been modeled (as is detailed in Table 1). The simulations results show the map of the water flow velocities and allow quantification of the zones where the velocities are lower than 0.5 m/s. Then the recommended 360º flow distribution is the one that minimizes the lower map with velocities respect to the case 180º circulation. Table 4 indicates which one of the four possible 360º flow distributions is the optimal for each ring and the percent of improvement for both the inlet and return flow distributions through the main ring pipes. Table 3. Average Flow Rate Deviation of Simulated Value to Measured Value in Each Ring. Table 1. Studied Flow Distributions Table 2. Comparative Analysis between the Real Measurements and the Flowmaster Simulated Results.\n\n27. mentor.com/mechanical 27 The values shown in Table 4 are calculated with the following expression: Improvement = 100 |Nopt - N180 | N180 Where Nopt and N180 are the number of pipes with flow velocities lower than 0.5 m/s in the optimal and in the 180º configurations, respectively. Figure 8 illustrates the evolution of the flow velocity along the EA ring’s inlet flow main pipe caused by the 180º and 360º circulations. Whereas almost all of the EA ring’s sectors have velocities lower than 0.5 m/s (shown in red) when the flow distribution is 180º, the 360º current Figure 8. Velocity along the Experimental Area ring’s inlet flow main pipe due to the 180º circulation (left) and to 360º current circulation (right). circulation restricts these undesirable velocities to less than a half of the EA ring. However, there is obviously a zero velocity point next to the closed valve (indicated by the blue cross) but the good point is that it is located relatively far from any sub-system. Therefore, it is clearly observed the fact that the flow distribution change from 180º to 360º entails a significant velocity rise in most of the pipe sectors. Conclusions Thanks to Flowmaster 1D Thermo-fluid simulation software, ALBA Synchrotron has been able to improve the fluid dynamic behavior of the cooling system consumption rings. Table 4. Optimal Flow Distribution for Each Ring and Percent of Improvement Actually, each ring has been modeled with a high level of detail of its local consumptions. The accuracy of the model has been validated with real operation data. The resultant models have allowed for the study of the rings’ original flow distribution as well as all the alternative possible circulations. As a result, for each ring it has been identified that the 360º flow distribution make it possible to increase those deficient velocities that take place in the original configuration (180º circulation). The suggested 360º circulations have reduced these undesirable velocities by around 49% on average. Consequently, the cooling system’s reliability has been significantly increased.

For Starters Power Cycling is used to exert thermo- mechanical stress on different materials. Thanks to thermodynamics, we know that a material can expand and contract at different temperatures according to this equation: αV = 1 dV V dT S Figure 1. Heat-spreading behavior after 1 seconds (top) and 60 seconds (bottom) What this shows is that materials can change size when a temperature change occurs. What does this mean for testing? Well, as we have more than one material in our components and packages, we have what is called a thermal coefficient mismatch. This means that different materials expand or contract at different rates. This creates strain, and when strained enough, the interface or the materials themselves break. In addition to this some materials age quicker, corrode or stop functioning. In terms of semiconductors the possibilities are endless. Of course all of these effects need to be induced and tested with several methods, before a component is verified and shipped. However, the environment and operational condition of the component may determine which failure occurs first. Other Issues Environmental and operational conditions not only bring forth new technology, requirements and conclusions. Ultimately, what everyone is concerned about, is the longevity of their device. Will it last two million cycles? What will the cause be for earlier failure? Is there a difference between\n\n29. mentor.com/mechanical 29 complete failure and accepted failure? For clarification of what these questions entail let us use an electric car as an example. Not only does the automotive industry have some of the toughest reliability standards in the consumer space, but the industry also tends to buy, not fabricate, components. This means that much of the information is provided and then compared. Going one step further, we want to create our own electric car, and need to purchase IGBTs for our electric motor. Now, aside from all the electric criteria, we would prefer it if the IGBT does not get very hot, performs all functions and has a long life time. Given that we are not in Utopia, we will need to get data from different manufacturers and compare their statements. one second, might affect it differently than if it’s cycled for one minute. Additionally, different cycling methodologies can be driven to quantify different failure modes. By keeping the change in junction temperature constant over the cycle period, therefore reducing the power as the die attach ages, the system experiences less stress over the entire life span. The other option is to keep the input current constant and not compensating for the degradation. The effects are relatively straight forward and not all are shown here. In a quick test we can already demonstrate how constant current (blue) differs to constant power (red) and constant temperature change (green). Though the results vary, there is a clear trend and a possibility to “optimize” results. The reason this is important has several explanations: 1. If you are receiving the IGBTs, make sure you understand the test procedure 2. ΔT seems like a useful solution, although cars driven slower to manage the power levels might not suit everyone. 3. Be sure that the testing method applies to your application – wind turbines might need to withstand a hurricane, while a car has to deal with a novice driver that doesn’t know the difference between 'R' and '1st ', or believes that a side walk is shared space. Thermal Resistance Thermal resistance is a measurable unit in Kelvin per Watt (K/W) – if a device has 2K/W, the temperature will increase by two degrees for every Watt power. Unfortunately the thermal resistance may increase as the device ages. If the device gets too hot, it ages, as it ages it will deteriorate and in so doing it will then become hotter. This then reduces the longevity of the components. Cycling Conditions Another important factor is the conditions at which the device is cycled and stands in direct correlation with the thermal resistance. Turning the device on and off for Figure 2. Summary of testing parameters to age high power electronics Figure 3. Chart showing the aging of IGBTs after the use of different control strategies. Constant Current (Blue), Constant Power (Red) and Constant change in Junction Temperature (Green)\n\n30. 30 mentor.com/mechanical Thermal Simulation to Model Airflow and Heat Dissipation for Vehicle ECUs E lectronic control units (ECUs) are a vital part of vehicle operation, controlling engine functions - fuel injection, ignition timing, and idle speed control. The ECU is part of a feedback loop in which data from sensors around the engine is monitored and used to optimize the control outputs. The ECU must be highly reliable in a harsh environment. Components can be exposed to extreme temperatures, and the push for minimal footprint designs increases the thermal issues. It must take into consideration environmental implications and maintenance-free operation, as well as suitability for high volume manufacturing. Historically, automotive electronics have been cooled via convection by ambient air. Within the engine bay, ambient air temperatures vary significantly. Often, the ECU is tucked away leaving convection around it compromised. Electronics modules in vehicles, and in particular, modules mounted out-of-cab, are often sealed to prevent moisture ingress. Preventing external air flow from circulating around the electronics directly, making Figure 1. The ECU with the PCB forced convection impossible. Convection cannot be relied on as a heat transfer mechanism in these situations. Conduction, normally to the vehicle structural body, becomes the dominant means by which to cool components. With a conduction-influenced design, the materials used in the ECU are an important part of thermal considerations. In this case, we are comparing materials used in the mounting brackets and their effects on the ECU’s internal component average temperatures. Modeling the ECU as Mounted in a Vehicle In the FloTHERM XT model, the ECU was mounted to a metal bracket, mounted to the vehicle chassis (Figure 1). Two thin walls were located close to two sides of the ECU to block airflow around the unit. Total heat dissipation in the unit was 19.8 W (Joules per second). We modeled two internal ICs as two-resistor (2R) representations to obtain a prediction of junction temperature. Each one dissipated 4.5 W. Pin heatsinks were also mounted on these 2R components. The remaining 24 IC representations were simple conducting cuboids with typical effective conductivity properties applied depending on the type of IC represented. These dissipated between 0.1 to 1 W each. The results give an indication of case temperature (Figure 2). Results for Unmodified Mild Steel and Aluminum Brackets With walls on two sides, there was, as expected a compromised airflow, and hotter Figure 2. Labeled ICs on the PCB inside the ECU By Kelly Cordell-Morris, QA/Test Engineer, Mentor Graphics\n\n31. mentor.com/mechanical 31 enclosure when made of mild steel. Plus a higher airflow velocity resulting from energy lost via convection. A change of material provided an average improvement of 8°C. PSOIC3 located over a hole in the bracket recorded the smallest change, with convection playing a large part in heat transfer making this IC less sensitive to changes in the material. However, U1 would be more sensitive to change given its location. Including a heatsink gave an alternative heat transfer path to conduction (Figure 3). In conclusion, holes may help airflow; however, on occasion solid mounts may be preferable to maximize conduction when convection is virtually zero. Results with Solid Bracket A new configuration for the bracket where the holes were suppressed was created for both models. Another configuration for each model with the heatsinks removed was also solved to determine just how necessary heatsinks may be to the final design (Figures 4-6). With a fully solid mounting bracket IC temperatures were generally reduced by around 4°C. Clearly, conduction was more efficient with the new design despite convection being compromised by the removal of the bracket cut-outs. Changing the bracket material to aluminum reduced temperatures by a further 7-8°C on average. We observed the greatest temperature drop on PSOIC 1, which may be because of its location close to U1. With lower temperatures on the 2R model and thus lower temperatures for the surrounding PCB, more efficient heat loss from PSOIC 1 to the PCB can be achieved. Results with No Heatsink We saw little gain in temperature for the majority of the components. U1 and U1-2 junction temperatures were raised 1.7°C and 1.5°C, respectively, when the heatsinks were removed in the mild steel bracket model. The rise was slightly less when the bracket was aluminum. The greatest change for the 2R models was in case temperature as would be expected with the removal of a heatsink. For the other components on the PCB, PSOICs 1 and 2 were the only ones significantly affected. This is probably because of their proximity to U1, and PSOIC 1 was the most affected because it is closest. Assuming that the small increase in temperature for these few components is allowable, the addition of heatsinks would appear superfluous. Again, using aluminum for the mounting bracket reduced component temperatures by 7-8°C on average. Conclusion In cases where airflow around the ECU is compromised, material changes can have significant effects to be considered for the thermal design. Using a more thermally conductive material such as aluminum is a simple change that results in a robust and fairly inexpensive design. Where convection, either forced or natural, is compromised or impossible, then a simple mounting bracket design can be more effective than a design intended to increase airflow around the ECU casing. This has the added benefit of making manufacturing simpler and thus less costly. As has been shown in this case, heatsinks in a closed system may not be that effective and add unnecessary cost to the final design. Thermal simulation software provides a quick and easy way to test material and thermal changes early on in the design process. Figure 3.

Many early CFD pioneers like Brian Spalding, David Tatchell, Ferit Boysan and Michael Engelman have talked or written about their memories. This pool of historical facts, technical information and personal impressions give a remarkably consistent description of the way engineering simulation software evolved from academic research codes towards the modern CFD products we know today. Developed and supported on an industrial scale by multinational software companies. Closely linked to the performance of available computing hardware, this development was, particularly in the early stages, driven primarily by research and development projects for aerospace and defense, but latterly also increasingly by interest from civilian industry. Looking back, three major phases of the development of CFD software for industrial applications can now be recognized: • The First Wave: The beginnings of commercial CFD software in the 70s and 80s. • The Second Wave: In the 90s, CFD enters the research and development departments of large industrial enterprises. • The Third Wave: After the millennium, CFD becomes an indispensable part of the product development process. TheThree Waves of Commercial CFD The First Wave: The beginnings of commercial CFD software Since 1958 the codes of the CFD software engineers in the first phase had its roots in the work of the Fluid Dynamics Group T-3 at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (USA), and the research activities under Prof. D. B. Spalding at Imperial College London in the 1960s and 1970s. In the late 1960s, Concentration, Heat and Momentum (CHAM) Ltd., founded by Spalding, and initially located at Imperial College London, dealt with consulting work. The era of commercial CFD software began in 1974, when CHAM Ltd moved to its own offices in New Malden near London. Initially, the development of customized CFD codes was central to the business activities of CHAM. That became too time-consuming and inefficient, so CHAM decided to develop a general-purpose CFD package for in-house consultancy work, and released this as a commercial product, PHOENICS, in 1981. This may well be regarded as the birth of the CFD software industry (see CHAM Ltd, 2008). Others quickly followed suit. For instance, Fluid Dynamics International (USA) followed in 1982 with FIDAP, a FEM-based CFD package, and in 1983 Creare Inc (USA) released the finite- volume CFD code, Fluent. Computational Dynamics/ADAPCO (UK/USA), co-founded by Prof. David Gosman, another professor at Imperial College London, released StarCD in 1989. The basic technologies behind most of the CFD packages of this era had been created by former employees or guest scientists of the two aforementioned research institutions in London and Los Alamos, or were based on their scientific publications. But there were also other developments of CFD technology: in the 1980s alternative approaches for CFD simulation emerged as part of the military and civilian aviation and space program of the former Soviet Union, largely unnoticed by the Western scientific community due to the political situation. Their technical tasks for CFD simulations were similar to those in the West, but the available computing resource for their solution was much more limited. Conversely, because of the high political priority of these research programs, very extensive experimental data for numerous fluid flow and heat transfer phenomena, especially in the near-wall area, were generated. This situation led to the development of alternative CFD methods, which, building on known methods for Figure 1. Fluid flow simulation in the 1980s, taken from Hanna Parry (2011) By Ivo Weinhold, User Experience Manager and John Parry, Mentor Graphics\n\n33. mentor.com/mechanical 33 Cartesian grids as published in the scientific publications in the West, were based on a combination of numerical, analytical, and empirical data. This innovative approach yielded high-quality simulation results in virtually, arbitrarily complex computational domains while maintaining the low resource requirements and the effectiveness of methods using Cartesian grids. With the gradual economic liberalization in the Soviet Union in the late 1980s, several teams of scientists have commercialized this CFD technology and, since the early 1990s, sold their products and services in Europe and Asia. The best known products of this kind were Aeroshape-3D by Prof. V. N. Gavriliouk and team (Petrowa, 1998 Alyamovskiy, 2008) and FlowVision by Dr. A. A. Aksenov and team (Aksenov et al., 2003). From the beginning of the 1990s, the conditions for CFD software and simulations changed quite rapidly. Computer hardware, mathematical methods and physical models all experienced huge performance gains. Numerical methods such as unstructured Finite Volume methods, multi-grid methods, sliding mesh, etc., suitable for complex geometry and optimized for HPC, became commercially available as well as more reliable, more flexible and more broadly applicable physical models. CFD technology became much more feasible, and for the first time, quite realistic model sizes, for real industrial applications were possible. These new capabilities heralded a new phase in the usage of commercial CFD software - entry into the research and development departments of industry across the board. The Second Wave: CFD enters the Research and Development Departments of the Industry Using technology typical of the first phase, Flomerics Ltd., founded in 1988 by David Tatchell and Harvey Rosten in Kingston- upon-Thames (UK), played a pioneering role in marketing CFD software developed exclusively for industrial applications with its software package FloTHERM, first released in 1989. Both founders worked for CHAM Ltd in senior positions before leaving to found Flomerics, with the aim of “providing good science to industry” (Tatchell, 2009). FloTHERM was a first paradigm shift in the CFD industry, away from the focus on complex CFD technology, towards the solution of engineering tasks in industry as the central goal. This also meant that from then on engineers working in product development, and not scientists, were the main target users of this type of CFD software. The available CFD technology, computer hardware and operating systems imposed certain limits on such an innovative approach. Therefore Flomerics concentrated initially on only two application areas: electronics cooling (with FloTHERM) and built environment HVAC (with FloVENT). The requirements of engineering-oriented CFD software for these application areas were relatively clearly defined and, more important, also just feasible. This concept opened up completely new market opportunities, because for the first time engineers in product development without special knowledge of numerical methods and without extensive CFD experience were empowered to employ CFD simulations as a development tool. The solution of a technical engineering task became the center of attention, while the underlying CFD technology was more or less just a means to an end. Obviously, other CFD providers also recognized the beginning of this paradigm shift and especially the new business opportunities associated with it, responding to this trend with their own product offerings. Overall, huge investments from all CFD software vendors in better user interfaces, robust solvers and reliable physical models could be observed, with the clear objective of entrenching CFD into the research and development departments of large industrial enterprises and thereby attracting a new generation of CFD users. After establishing CFD as a successful tool for the functional design, verification and optimization of product designs, features, processes and physical effects in large industrial companies in the early 2000s, the reputation of this technology amongst engineers improved significantly. As a result, the demand for CFD simulations showed strong growth, especially in medium-sized and small companies keen to reduce the costs associated with physical prototypes. Another important aspect was the need to integrate CFD simulation into the regular product development process, as these companies usually had as yet no Figure 2. Result plot of Aeroshape-3D (Parry et al., 2012) Figure 3. Early version of FloTHERM (Hanna Parry, 2011) Perspective\n\n34. 34 mentor.com/mechanical dedicated simulation departments. This meant that qualified engineers from product development or design groups would perform the simulation themselves. The efficiency with which simulation projects were conducted had to be increased, so CFD results would be available sufficiently in sync with the product design cycles, for the results to help guide proposals for design improvements. In this context the handling of industry-level geometry played a key role. At that time this was already being provided as 3D CAD data which should, of course, be used with as little simplification and modification effort as possible to be useable by the subsequent and preferably fully-automated mesh generation step. The CFD software market responded to these demands with new and improved products – and a third wave of CFD software for industrial product design began and continues to this day. The Third Wave – CFD Becomes an Essential Element of the Product Design Process The major CAD and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) vendors play a key role in this third phase. Since the 1990s, they have been successfully introducing the concept of PLM, which encompasses CAE. As a result, customers have put pressure on commercial CFD software vendors to conform to this concept and to take steps to integrate their products into the major PLM systems. In the 2000s, virtually all CFD software providers upgraded their systems with, at the least, CAD import interfaces. Some have developed bi-directional links with major CAD/PLM systems, and a few have even embedded their CFD technology directly into the 3D CAD systems themselves. New CFD techniques to support these requirements were also developed, partly from scratch, and partly as enhancements of existing technology. The company NIKA GmbH, founded in 1999 as a German-Russian joint venture, was a typical example of a new commercial CFD software vendor emerging at the start of this third wave. NIKA exclusively developed, based on the above mentioned Aeroshape- 3D technology, CAD embedded CFD software, which is now offered as FloEFD for several major 3D CAD systems. The current third wave has allowed newcomers from other areas the opportunity to enter the CFD market, refreshing it with new technologies. But all have one thing in common: The industrial user, with his or her need for easy-to-use, task-oriented, automated, reliable, efficient and readily- available CFD software as an indispensable tool for digital prototyping is the focus. The result of changing development processes and, as a consequence, the changing role of the simulation engineer. Aspects like process integration, reliability, modeling safety, and reproducibility are becoming the center of attention, and influence purchasing decisions for CFD software. The further development of CFD software based around these requirements will bring exciting new technologies and products to market. A new fourth wave may be expected to follow soon…watch this space.
