        "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio - Emerson Network Power, a business of Emerson, announced that it has completed the acquisition of Cooligy Inc., Mountain View, Calif., a developer and manufacturer of active cooling technology for microprocessors and other heat-generating components. Cooligy adds fluid-based, chip-level cooling technology to Emerson Network Power's family of Liebert cooling solutions, which provide room and rack-level cooling for computer and electronic equipment.\n\n\"Our cooling solutions are helping users adapt to increasing heat at the room and rack level, while Cooligy is helping manufacturers push processing speeds and power upward,\" said Bob Bauer, group vice president, Emerson. \"Together we enable faster, more powerful processors operating safely and efficiently in higher-density racks and rooms.\"\n\nAccording to the company, Cooligy's closed-loop active cooling technology provides the lowest thermal resistance and highest reliability solution for cooling advanced CPUs, ASICS, graphics chips, and large programmable gate arrays.\n\n\"Cooligy's system design is the most efficient and cost effective way to provide cooling for tomorrow's high speed processors,\" said Bauer. \"Some of our customers are already planning for the next generation of servers and we believe this technology will play a key role in helping them effectively manage the heat from those systems.\"\n\nFor more information, visit www.emersonnetworkpower.com."
