        "text": "One of the key challenges of phase change memory (PCM) is its high power consumption during the reset operation, when the phase change material (typically Ge2Sb2Te5, i.e., GST) heats up to âˆ¼900 K or more in order to melt. Here, we study the temperature-dependent behavior of PCM devices by probing the reset power at ambient temperatures from 80 to 400 K. We find that different device structures exhibit contrasting temperature-dependent behavior. The reset power in our confined-type PCM is nearly unchanged with ambient temperature, corresponding to a temperature-dependent thermal resistance, whereas results for mushroom-type PCM from the literature show a linear relation between power and temperature, suggesting a more constant thermal resistance. This discrepancy is ascribed to different temperature distributions and thermal properties of the dominant components of the PCM cell thermal resistance, as shown by electro-thermal modeling. In the confined cell, the thermal boundary resist...\n\nThe operation of a phase-change memory cell is studied, with special regard to programming performance, by means of analytical and TCAD numerical modeling and experimental characterization. Dependence of the reset current on geometrical properties of the heater element is analyzed through the study of heat flux from the heater element to the phase-change material. A simple electrothermal analytical model is implemented, which allows the prediction of the cell reset current value as a function of heater geometrical parameters. Analytical predictions are compared with good agreement to extensive experimental measurements. The effects of power dissipation are studied, showing that cell power efficiency strongly depends on its geometrical properties."
