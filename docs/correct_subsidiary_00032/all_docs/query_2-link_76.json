        "text": "In the present experiment, the liquid cooling in minichannel heat sink for processors of personal computers is studied. A minichannel heat sink is designed, analyzed and fabricated from copper with the length, width and base with thickness, of 30, 31 and 6mm respectively with 15 channels, for a pre-chosen test CPU, with TDP of 95 watts and maximum surface temperature of 71˚C. Distilled water is used as coolant. The liquid cooling in minichannel heat sink is compared with the factory air cooled aluminium heat sink setup. Experiments are performed at full load conditions for 60 minutes at various operating speeds for both setup and temperatures of the CPU are logged. The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of liquid cooled minichannel heat sink.\n\nThe efficient cooling from heat sinks is important for the proper functioning and longevity of a central processing unit (CPU). In this Project, ANSYS simulation of a modified micro-fin heat sink was done and the results were analyzed to get an idea of the approximate rate of Heat transfer, Temperature distribution and Thermo fluid behavior of the heat sink mounted on the central processing unit. Air cooling methods by free convection and conduction are used for heat extraction. The simulation was based on the effects on inlet fluid velocity, design of fins and location of source on the performance of the Heat Sink. The Turbulent SST model is used. The Heat transfer rate, temperature and pressure distribution were obtained for different designs of fin. After complete analysis, an increased air flow velocity at inlet and thin sheet fins with source at the bottom of heat sink provides the most effective heat transfer rate.\n\nThe development of the digital computer and its usage day by day is rapidly increasing. But the reliability of electronic components is getting affected critically by the temperature at which the junction operates. As operating power and speed increases, and as the designers are forced to reduce overall systems dimensions, the problems of extracting heat and controlling temperature becomes crucial. A heat sink is a passive heat exchanger that transfers the heat generated by an electronic or a mechanical device to a fluid medium, often air or a liquid coolant. Modern electronic devices are becoming more compact in size so the heat sink must be developed for such device. The study of heat sink is an important field for the last decade. The reason is mainly the possibilities of reducing the size, weight and cost as compared to current designs. The continual development of faster desktop computers being sold at lower prices into the market place has demanded that thermal management engineers develop and optimize thermal management devices that not only perform better, but are at the same or lower cost than previous generations. An overview of different types of heat sinks is provided. Modelling of heat sink and the development of overall model is described.\n\nElectronic equipment plays an important role in day-to-day life. Almost every object or equipment or machine uses electronic components to complete its task. For electronic component to work it needs electric current to flow through the circuits. And hence they become main reason of excessive heating. Continued shrinking of electronic systems has resulted in a histrionic increase in the amount of heat generated per unit volume. Air cooling with the help of heat sinks is the most economical & efficient method of electronics cooling. In this study, thermal analysis of a server system is proposed, and an effort is made to lower the maximum temperature in the CPUs by changing CPU heat sink design. The server computer of form factor SSI EEB is modelled in detail and is analyzed by using commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software packages Icepak and Fluent. To optimize parameters of heat, sink parameters the CFD simulations will be performed for maximum dissipation of heat. Few iterations will be performed by changing geometry and material of heat sinks number of fins of heat sinks and changing the fan positions on computer chassis. The optimum grouping of parameters and results will be compared with the commercially available heat sink.\n\nThis research paper presents a thermal analysis of a heat sink for a microprocessor using SolidWorks and ANSYS Discovery software. The aim of the study is to analyse the heat dissipation capacity of the heat sink under different operating conditions. The simulation model of the heat sink is developed using SolidWorks, and the thermal analysis is performed using ANSYS Discovery software. The results show that the heat sink is capable of efficiently dissipating heat generated by the microprocessor, and the thermal performance is influenced by factors such as the airflow rate and the thermal conductivity of the materials used in the heat sink. The findings of this study can be useful in the design and optimization of heat sinks for microprocessors to enhance their thermal performance and reliability.\n\nA number of thermal management devices are used to actuate concentrated electronic appliances in an efficient way. A liquid cooling plate acts as a heat sink enclosed by materialized walls. This work aims to carry out design of liquid cooling plates such that the heat diffused by the electronic equipment is removed while their temperatures levels remain within safe limits. The liquid cooling plates expose ?cold surfaces? to electronic appliances. The performance of a cooling plate is estimated depending upon heat carrying capacity, associated heat transfer rates and concentrated thermal regions on the plate surface. For this study, the design of liquid cooling plate was done with SOLIDWORKS. Pure water was used as a working fluid in test channels. A comparative analysis of flow distribution, temperature contours, pressure drop and pumping power for different channel configurations was carried out with ANSYS. It was observed that a channel configuration is of key importance in liquid...\n\nThe high heat transfer coefficients in microchannels are attractive for direct cooling of electronic systems requiring high heat-flux removal. In this work we are presenting the results of a study on self-similar heat sinks for liquid cooled electronics, made from copper, designed for industrial application and for large scale production. The internal structures, where the most part of the active cooling takes place, have been designed in order to achieve high heat transfer coefficients. As it is almost impossible to validate the design and describe the flow characteristics inside the device via analytical solutions, a well known numerical code was employed to have an insight of the thermal-fluid distributions. It is clear from the simulation that even if copper is characterized by a high thermal conductivity, most of the heat is removed in the overflow-structure, on the side of the device adjacent to the source of heat. This paper attempts to critically analyse a comprehensive list...\n\n—Heat sink constitutes geometrically simple structure but to find out the accurate fluid flow path pose enormous difficulty to attempt to perform thermal analysis. These are used in a wide range of applications wherever efficient heat dissipation is required, major examples are Cooling electronic devices like microprocessors, DSPs, GSPs, Refrigeration, and lasers. This work is concerned with the comparative study of taper pin fins heat sink with Rectangular pin fins heat sink using the commercial CFD software Icepack. The heat sink is made from aluminum and air is used as the cooling fluid and a constant heat flux of 100 W/cm 2 from bottom and flow velocity of 2m/s. The observed results are satisfactorily good.\n\nA number of thermal management devices are used to actuate concentrated electronic appliances in an efficient way. A liquid cooling plate acts as a heat sink enclosed by materialized walls. This work aims to carry out design of liquid cooling plates such that the heat diffused by the electronic equipment is removed while their temperatures levels remain within safe limits. The liquid cooling plates expose \"cold surfaces\" to electronic appliances. The performance of a cooling plate is estimated depending upon heat carrying capacity, associated heat transfer rates and concentrated thermal regions on the plate surface. For this study, the design of liquid cooling plate was done with SOLIDWORKS. Pure water was used as a working fluid in test channels.

It was observed that a channel configuration is of key importance in liquid cooling plates. The findings from this study are beneficial for the optimum design of cooling systems for high heat flux applications, i.e., in electronic devices, computer processors and automotive engines.\n\nThe cooling of electronic devices is essential to guarantee their functional performance and operational lifetime. Due to continued miniaturization and integration of transistors in packaged chips, the heat dissipation rate has surpassed the limits of classical air-cooled heat sinks. This has triggered a lot of research towards alternatives for high heat flux cooling. Liquid cooling with micro heat sinks is one of these candidate solutions. The first part of this thesis focusses on the validation of thermal enhancement in microchannel heat sink (MCHS) using numerical analysis. The single channel computational domain for the numerical simulation was adopted from MCHS. The basic geometry of the computational domain was obtained from the existing literature which related to the geometry of MCHS. With using experimental model demonstrated by M.R.Sohel, his experimental data was used as a reference to compare with the available analytical correlation and with numerical approached. The ra..."
