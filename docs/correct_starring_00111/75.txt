Often cast as a roguish charmer and Western renegade, Texan-born Dennis Quaid hit the Hollywood radar in the 1980s with rugged roles in "The Right Stuff" (1983) and "The Big Easy" (1987). Throughout his career he was also a frequent player in dramatic sports films like "Everybody's All American" (1988) but by decade's end, personal problems and drug addiction took a toll on the quality of Quaid's work. After a period of recovery, the actor strengthened his focus, married America's sweetheart, actress Meg Ryan, and began to rebuild his reputation as a solid screen presence with well-received roles in the Western epic "Wyatt Earp" (1993), the sports drama "Any Given Sunday" (1999), and the light family comedy, "Yours, Mine and Ours" (2005). But despite successful supporting roles in occasionally acclaimed dramas like "Traffic" (2000), Quaid's later work relied more heavily on outlandish, Earth-threatening scenarios, and unfortunately his appealing way with everyday-guy-turned-heroes was underused by Hollywood directors. Despite a rough road of public spectacles - including the dissolution of his fabled marriage to Ryan after rumors of infidelity on both their parts; hospital negligence in the accidental poisoning of his newborn twins - Quaid's undeniable charm both on and off screen made him one of the most appealing and reliable leading men of his generation.
