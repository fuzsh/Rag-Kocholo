        "text": "You might recognize Roma Downey from her longtime role in the series “Touched By An Angel”, but the Emmy nominated actress is also making a name for herself behind the camera.\n\nDowney is among the producers of the new movie “On a Wing and a Prayer”, which stars Dennis Quaid and Heather Graham. The film is based on the true story of a family flying in a small, private plane when the pilot died unexpectedly of a heart attack. Quaid plays the role of the father who became tasked with landing a plane he didn’t know how to fly.\n\nWhile talking with “Live In The D” host Tati Amare about “On a Wing and a Prayer”, Downey said it’s “an extraordinary drama” and a story that “unfolds with exceptional tension.”\n\nDowney also shared that she feels a special connection to Detroit because her former “Touched By An Angel” co-star, Della Reese, was from Detroit. Watch the video above to see Downey’s interview with Tati."
