        "text": "Many musicians and actors are receiving their own biopics and former presidents are no exception. A biopic based on the life of actor turned 40th president of the United States, Ronald Reagan is set to premiere on August 30, 2024 and the trailer just recently dropped. Dennis Quaid stars in the film, simply titled Reagan.\n\nQuaid revealed that it was interesting to him to get the opportunity to play Reagan because he was the first president he ever voted for. He wanted to do the part justice and not just impersonate the former president. Quaid explained, “It was one of the most challenging roles that I’ve ever had to kind of get down and know the person. He was actually a great communicator, very private, kind of unknowable person. I learned a lot in this role and a lot about him. He defeated the Soviets in the Cold War, going on for almost 50 years, without firing a shot. He led us out of times very similar to what we’re going through now and did it with principles rather than just the politics of the day.”\n\nQuaid, who just turned 70 years old on April 9 and opted not to celebrate, said that the milestone did give him a chance to look back on his long career. He added, “It’s great being an actor. You get to go and research [and] live all these lives that you would never get a chance to become acquainted with. You go through all these doors that say, ‘authorized personnel only’ and get all these experiences.”\n\nIn addition, Penelope Ann Miller will play Nancy Reagan in the film. Reagan is directed by Sean McNamara and is said to look at Reagan’s life through the eyes of a fictional KGB agent, played by Jon Voight. Robert Davi will play Leonid Brezhnev, who ruled the Soviet Union through the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nWill you go see Reagan when it comes out this summer?"
