        "text": "By Movieguide® Contributor\n\nTHE LONG GAME, a movie about an unlikely group of golfers, stars Dennis Quaid and Jay Hernandez and is set for release on April 12.\n\n“We are thrilled to share this powerful and inspirational film with audiences across the country who can come as a family to celebrate this true underdog story. Making this film with an all-star Latino cast and crew and amazing partners like Bonniedale sets an exciting blueprint for Mucho Mas,” Javier Chapa, the co-founder of Mucho Mas Media, said.\n\nDirected by Julio Quintana, the Bonniedale/Mucho Mas Media movie is based on the book “Mustang Miracle” by Humberto G. Garcia. It tells the story of five teenage Hispanic-American caddies in the 1950s who, though they couldn’t play at the white-only country club, built their own golf course and went on to win the state championship at the same country club.\n\nQuaid said he “could not be more proud of” the movie that won SXSW’s 2023 Narrative Spotlight Audience Award.\n\n“Great sports movies transcend the sport itself—this is an American dream story and exemplifies the kind of stories Bonniedale seeks to tell,” he said.\n\n“[I]t’s a great underdog story. And it’s authentic, and that’s what we tried to reflect in doing it is just to be real,” Quaid told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nJesse Dodson wrote in PGA of America how the movie “clearly displays the extreme exclusivity that golf — and America — once had, then beautifully demonstrates how the sport can make a difference by helping create relationships between people from all backgrounds.”\n\nQuintana also saw golf as too exclusive, but his attitude toward the sport changed through making the movie.\n\n“When I was younger, I saw golf as stuffy and overly restrictive, but once you get into it, by the very nature of the game, it requires a lot of virtue, honor and trust,” Quintana said. “Over the course of making the movie, the game really transformed into a very noble sport that elevates people… I found a new respect for the whole sport.”\n\nGregory Diaz IV, who plays Gene, one of the five caddies, shared similar sentiments as Quintana and felt golf was an “elitist” game for “white people” prior to making the movie.\n\n“After hearing this story and the fact it’s a true story that took place in the ’50s when they had so much more to deal with than we do today — and how they overcame it all —made it so much fun to not only be a part of the film, but also to have the amazing opportunity to learn to play golf and fall in love with the sport,” Diaz said.\n\nThis will be Quintana and Quaid’s second project together. Their 2021 Netflix movie BLUE MIRACLE, which won Movieguide®’s 2021 Epiphany Prize®, tells the story of a group of orphans and their guardian Omar (Jimmy Gonzales), who, with the help of boat captain Wade (Quaid), team up to win a fishing contest in order to save the orphanage.\n\nMovieguide® previously reported on the faith-based movie directed by Quintana:\n\nBoth characters [Wade and Omar] experience encounters with their faith as they are thrown into a competition that is bigger than themselves.\n\n“I love that. I think that it also tested his faith,” Gonzales said of his character Omar. “He was leaning into a lot of these parts of his faith as a cover. And in terms of really getting out there and putting the faith to test, Captain Wade (Quaid) shows him that you got to try; you got to work hard. That was a big part of the appeal for the project for me.”\n\nQuaid noted how his character comes to discover humility and is used by God as a result.\n\n“At the beginning of the film, he’s really kind of a jaded character,” Quaid told Movieguide®. “He’s ego driven, puts burdens on all the wrong things, he thinks he’s out there winning trophies for his son who is back in Dallas, but it’s really for himself, and he gets these orphans foisted upon him, who are going to be out on the streets and lose their homes. And I think he winds up really learning humility, which is really when God’s miracles happened. And it’s like a person who’s looking for redemption and he doesn’t even know it.”"
