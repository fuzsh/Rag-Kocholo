        "text": "Taylor Sheridan’s upcoming Western drama, 1883: The Bass Reeves Story, will feature a familiar face and place.\n\nDennis Quaid has joined the streaming series as Sherrill Lynn, a Deputy U.S. Marshall. And as production begins, the series plans to film inside the Ellis County Courthouse.\n\nThe six-part limited series stars David Oyelowo as Reeves, the real-life U.S. Deputy Marshal who was born into slavery and later worked in the post-Reconstruction era as a federal peace officer in the Indian Territory.\n\nThe Paramount+ series is a spin-off of Sheridan’s Yellowstone prequel, 1883.\n\nBass Reeves is executive produced by Sheridan, Chad Feehan, David C. Glasser, Oyelowo, Jessica Oyelowo, David Permut, Ron Burkle, Bob Yari and David Hutkin.\n\nSheridan’s current dramas are anchored by dead-serious rancher types. Kevin Costner stars in Yellowstone, Harrison Ford co-stars in 1923 and now Quaid.\n\n“I’m doing Bass Reeves for Taylor Sheridan,” Quaid told Fox News. “Riding horses, shooting guns. You know, making mayhem at 4 in the morning.”\n\nQuaid, the Houston-born Emmy and Golden Globes awards nominee, has starred in shows such as Merry Happy Whatever, The Art of More and Vegas. Mostly, he’s known for film roles, such as in The Rookie, The Day After Tomorrow, Traffic, Frequency, The Parent Trap, The Right Stuff, Breaking Away, Midway and more.\n\nSheridan, a Weatherford resident, has used North Texas as a backdrop for his shows. He filmed several scenes for 1883 in and around Fort Worth. He shot a scene in the Johnson County town of Venus for Yellowstone.\n\nIn Waxahachie, Sheridan is expected to film inside the Ellis County Courthouse on Feb. 13 and Feb. 14. The city plans to close parking around the courthouse.\n\nRead more about Taylor Sheridan and his productions"
