        "text": "Sean McNamara‘s “Reagan,” starring Dennis Quaid, the first full-length feature on the 40th U.S. President, has been picked up for North American distribution by ShowBiz Direct. The film was shot in 2020! There have been multiple delays on this one. Regardless, “Reagan” has finally been dated for an August 30th release.\n\nA biopic set against the backdrop of the Cold War, the film follows Reagan’s journey from his ‘20s childhood in Dixon, Illinois to Hollywood and on to the White House.\n\nThe film stars Quaid as Reagan, Jon Voight as Viktor Petrovich, Penelope Ann Miller as Nancy Reagan, Mena Suvari as Reagan’s first wife Jane Wyman, Lesley-Anne Down as Margaret Thatcher, David Henrie as teenage Reagan, and Kevin Dillon as Jack Warner.\n\nThese last five years, Quaid has starred in faith-based movies, marketed for conservative-minded audiences, they include “The Hill,” “On A Wing and Prayer,” “I Can Only Imagine,” It’s seemingly fitting that Quaid will now be playing one of the most worshipped conservatives in history. The film will most probably paint a very favorable picture of Reagan.\n\nIn an interview with EW, Quaid mentioned that Reagan was his favorite president. The 66-year-old added that he was simultaneously surprised, honored and terrified to be offered the role: “I didn't understand why they were offering me Ronald Reagan because I just didn't see it. I admired him so much, and so I had a chill of fear go down my spine when I was offered it.”"
