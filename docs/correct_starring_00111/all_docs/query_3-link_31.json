Netflix #1 movie in America,\" says the film's director, Jeff Celentano, on Instagram. \"Crazy! Keep the thumbs up and we'll stay awhile. Thank you all for your undying support!!\"\n\nActor Colin Ford played Rickey Hill. He accepted the award on stage with The Hill won Best Family Feature Film at the Family Film and TV Awards.\n\n\"The Hill was 10+ years in the making and very near and dear to my heart,\" says Ford on Instagram. \"This film is based upon the life of Rickey Hill, who shows us that through faith and determination, you should never give up on your dreams!\"\n\nThe director, Celentano shared the impact the script had on him over a decade ago.\n\n\"I read the script and bawled my eyes out and never looked back. It just got inside my soul. Like Rickey determined to play baseball, I was determined to get this movie made.\"\n\nHollywood actor Quaid had a record-breaking year in 2023 as he appeared in five movies and two TV shows.\n\nA second faith film Quaid was in last year was On a Wing and a Prayer, another true story this time combining faith and survival."
