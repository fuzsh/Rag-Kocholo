        "text": "Actor Born Dennis William Quaid on April 9, 1954 in Houston, TX\n\nDennis Quaidâs career began with bit roles in such films as 1975's \"Crazy Mama\" and 1977's \"I Never Promised You a Rose Garden.\" But it was his role in 1979âs Oscar-winning âBreaking Awayâ that garnered him the attention of critics and audiences. Later, he had memorable roles in the TV movies \"Bill\" and \"Bill: On His Own,\" and as Gordon Cooper in Phil Kaufman's movie \"The Right Stuff\" (1983).\n\nA drug problem stalled his career in the late 1980s, and though he achieved sobriety in the â90s, his acting career was overshadowed by then-wife Meg Ryanâs rising star status as she appeared in the popular films \"Sleepless in Seattle\" and \"You've Got Mail.\" But things seemed to pick up again for Quaid when he appeared as a crooked attorney in Steven Soderbergh's 2000 hit, \"Traffic.\" He followed up the success with a role in the 2002 baseball movie \"The Rookie\" and received critical acclaim for his daring turn as a closeted gay man in 2002's \"Far From Heaven.\"\n\nBy 2004, Quaid got married for a third time, to Kimberly Buffington. In 2007, they made headlines for suing a pharmaceutical company after their newborn twins received an overdose of blood thinner at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center."
