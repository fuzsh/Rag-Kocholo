        "text": "The first trailer for Reagan, a new biopic starring Dennis Quaid, has been released. The video sees Quaid playing Ronald Reagan, the 40th president of the United States. The film releases in theaters on August 30, 2024, from ShowBiz Direct.\n\n“From dusty small-town roots, to the glitter of Hollywood, and then on to commanding the world stage, Reagan is a cinematic journey of overcoming the odds,” the official synopsis reads. “Told through the voice of Viktor Petrovich, a former KGB agent whose life becomes inextricably linked with Ronald Reagan’s when Reagan first caught the Soviets’ attention as an actor in Hollywood, this film offers a perspective as unique as it is captivating. Dennis Quaid brings to life a story that transcends the boundaries of a traditional biopic, offering a profound exploration of the enduring impact of the power of one man who overcame the odds, sustained by the love of a woman who supported him in his journey.”\n\nCheck out the Reagan trailer, along with a poster for the movie, below (watch more trailers and clips):\n\nWho is in the Ronald Reagan biopic?\n\nAlong with Quad, Reagan stars Penelope Ann Miller as Nancy Reagan, Mena Suvari as Jane Wyman, Lesley-Anne Down as Margaret Thatcher, David Henrie as teenage Reagan, Kevin Dillon as Jack Warner, and Jon Voight as Viktor Petrovich.\n\n“Portraying Ronald Reagan was an enormous challenge,” Quaid previously told Deadline about the film. “This is an important movie, one of my most interesting roles and I am really excited to work with the ShowBiz team to get this film opened in theatres this Summer.”\n\nReagan is directed by Sean McNamara, who previously 2011’s Soul Surfer and 2018’s The Miracle Season, among other titles. The film, which was shot during the COVID-19 pandemic, was originally scheduled to be released in 2023 but was delayed because of the 2023 strikes."
