        "text": "\"There's nothing a retired governor can do about the Soviets...\" ShowBiz Direct has revealed a trailer for a movie called Reagan, a brand new biopic about the 40th President of the United States of America. This will open in theaters at the end of August this summer. Actor Dennis Quaid stars as Ron, who worked as an actor before getting into politics. \"I've always been told bits and pieces of the stories of Ronald Reagan's life, but this movie puts the whole story together. I've played quite a few real people over the years, and I like to play them from their point of view, without judgment. It was a big challenge for me to get behind the public persona of the man and also to move beyond my own feelings of admiration for him.\" Set against the backdrop of the Cold War, the film was shot in Oklahoma and in California at Reaganâ€™s beloved Rancho Del Cielo and on Air Force One. The film follows Reagan from his humble beginnings to the glitz & glamour of Hollywood, and finally on to his biggest role as Commander in Chief. The cast includes Mena Suvari, Jon Voight, Penelope Ann Miller, Xander Berkeley, Amanda Righetti, C. Thomas Howell, Justin Chatwin, and Robert Davi.
