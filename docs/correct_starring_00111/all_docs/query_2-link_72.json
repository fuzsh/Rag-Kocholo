        "text": "A poor year for really good quality movies, although I’ll keep searching. Reviewed below are three mainstream offerings, The Alamo (box office disaster, but a quality production), The Day After Tomorrow (Roland Emmerich’s environmental plea), and I, Robot (CGI-rich Asimov rip-off).\n\nTHE ALAMO (27 March 2004) USA\n\nDirector: John Lee Hancock.\n\nCast: Patrick Wilson, Jason Patric, Billy Bob Thornton, Dennis Quaid.\n\nPlot: An irregular force of American patriots attempt to defend their outpost against overwhelming odds.\n\nReview: This is a good movie. It is a dramatic retelling of the siege of the Alamo fort by the Mexican army in 1836, and the subsequent confrontation between the Mexican forces and those under the newly appointed Commander-in-Chief for Texas, ‘Sam’ Houston.\n\nIt has quality in all departments, being well scripted, well cast and with an excellent screenplay – the complex story is well-told – and good performances all round. In a busy year for Dennis Quaid (he was also doing The Day After Tomorrow), he gives a convincing performance as Houston, the rising star of the Texan political scene, and Billy Bob Thornton acquits himself well as the adventurer-turned-politician Davy Crockett.\n\nA big risk was made in casting virtual unknown Patrick Wilson as William Travis, the Alamo’s overall commander, but he is more than on par with Thornton and Quaid. Another relative unknown, Jason Patric, plays David Bowie (of ‘the knife’ fame) and again is excellent and believable.\n\nSo, how come this rather good movie turned out to be one of the most expensive box office disasters of all time (according to some calculations, the most expensive)?\n\nSubject? Perhaps people just aren’t moved to go and see a movie about nothing more than a two hour gunfight at a dusty old fort. Title? It recalls the stodgy 1960s production directed by and starring John Wayne. Casting? Quaid and Thornton being good actors but just not major crowd-pullers. Disney? Not a name one associates with memorable historical epics.\n\nMy own theory is one of simple mathematics. The budget, extraordinarily, was almost $100,000,000 (yes, one-hundred-million dollars), spent on what is ultimately a minority interest movie, and which only recovered half the budget at most. Thankfully it was not a career-ending mistake. Hooker reversed his fortunes in 2009 when the relatively low budget The Blind Side returned its outlay tenfold within six months, and was successful again in 2013 with Saving Mr Banks. Not someone who chooses obvious subjects, it will be interesting to see what he comes up with next.\n\nScore: 7/10.\n\nTHE DAY AFTER TOMORROW (17 May 2004) USA\n\nDirector: Roland Emmerich.\n\nCast: Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal, Dash Mihok, Jay O Sanders, Ian Holm.\n\nPlot: Dennis Quaid tries to persuade everyone that global warming is about to cause a global catastrophe … and that is exactly what it does.\n\nReview: Visually a treat, conceptually muddled, acting so-so. If you like natural disaster-themed movies then you’ll enjoy this, although the overall impression is rather a muddled affair. The opening scenes – a flight over Antarctic ice fields, all created in the computer – set the tone for the excellent computer generated imagery in the movie, of which there is much – crumbling Arctic ice shelves, tornadoes, tidal waves, blizzards, snow storms, ice storms and other disasters.\n\nThe choice of actors and Roland Emmerich’s direction, although reasonably competent, does not give the movie the weight it could have. Denis Quaid stating, “I think we’re on the verge of a major climate shift”, passes by almost unnoticed. One can imagine someone such as Sean Connery uttering the same line and making it a real show stopper.\n\nThere is just so much information for one to process during the course of the movie, with sub-plots galore:\n\nQuaid’s relationship with his son.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal‘s dodgy college career.\n\nGyllenhaal’s romance with Emmy Rossum.\n\nQuaid’s quest to rescue his son from mortal danger.\n\nQuaid’s role as an ignored science advisor.\n\nQuaid’s wife nursing a sick child in hospital.\n\nDash Mihok getting the hots for Tamlyn Tomita.\n\nLeadership issues in the Whitehouse.\n\nA bunch of wolves which have escaped from a zoo and are now causing havoc on …\n\nA supertanker drifting through New York.\n\nEmmy Rossum getting mysteriously ill.\n\nA bunch of guys stuck on a space station.\n\nIan Holm and friends stuck in a cabin in the north of Scotland.\n\nMoral dilemmas about burning books to keep warm (in spite of there being stacks of far more usable wooden furniture all around).\n\nThe list goes on. No wonder Quaid looks strangely glassy-eyed throughout the movie – blink and you’ve missed another sub-plot.\n\nAlthough made to entertain, Roland Emmerich wanted to express genuine concerns about global climate change and the USA government’s lack of commitment to the Kyoto Protocol – he paid out of his own pocket to make the movie ‘carbon neutral’, using environmentally-friendly technology and planting trees to offset the fossil fuels burned during the making of the movie. Twister had related themes and equally dubious science, but at least we learned a little about tornadoes and enjoyed the ride without having to take notes. So, a worthy effort, but falling very wide of its intended mark.\n\nScore: 5/10\n\nI, ROBOT (15 July 2004) USA\n\nDirector: Alex Proyas\n\nCast: Will Smith, Bridget Moynahan, Alan Tudyk.\n\nPlot: Investigating the death of a robotics specialist, Will Smith finds himself in the midst of a robot rebellion.\n\nReview: Claimed to be ‘based on a book by Isaac Asimov’ but in reality with only very loose references Asimov’s work, this is very much a big-budget effects fest, although with some interesting qualities.\n\nThe movie opens with a grungy, downbeat Will Smith, which is a pleasant change from his relentlessly jovial performances. Bridget Moynahan as his sidekick predictably initially dislikes her mentor, but rapidly warms to him, in the process also loosening her hair and clothing. Most original is Alan Tudyk (and the CGI team) as Sonny, the maverick robot which turns out to be a special project by its creator, designed to help thwart the threat of a robot revolution. Tudyk, via virtual animatronics, manages to make him/it a sympathetic character.\n\nThis is really a formulaic story though, designed to maximise opportunities for the special effects department and minimise audience use of brain power. There are occasional nice touches, such as Sonny reacting to the moment when Smith refers to him as a thinking being, not just a machine, and the spooky scenes with redundant robots just standing around in storage containers. However, these moments are not developed, and the movie speeds towards a predictable finale.\n\nScore: 3/10.\n\nSo, the best movie of 2004 is …\n\nTHE ALAMO (7/10)\n\n… because it is an all-round quality production, with good performances and exceptional attention to detail – and a massively oberblown budget largely spent on recreating the Alamo fort and surrounding settlement on a ranch 50 miles west of Austen, Texas. If Disney had made Hooker keep costs down to a more typical a-couple-of-tens-of-millions, the movie would have shown a respectable profit. In a final twist of fate, the set – the largest ever built – burned down in 2011 after a lightening storm."
