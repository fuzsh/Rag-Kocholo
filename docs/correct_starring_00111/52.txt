Actor Born Dennis William Quaid on April 9, 1954 in Houston, TX

Dennis Quaidâs career began with bit roles in such films as 1975's "Crazy Mama" and 1977's "I Never Promised You a Rose Garden." But it was his role in 1979âs Oscar-winning âBreaking Awayâ that garnered him the attention of critics and audiences. Later, he had memorable roles in the TV movies "Bill" and "Bill: On His Own," and as Gordon Cooper in Phil Kaufman's movie "The Right Stuff" (1983).

A drug problem stalled his career in the late 1980s, and though he achieved sobriety in the â90s, his acting career was overshadowed by then-wife Meg Ryanâs rising star status as she appeared in the popular films "Sleepless in Seattle" and "You've Got Mail." But things seemed to pick up again for Quaid when he appeared as a crooked attorney in Steven Soderbergh's 2000 hit, "Traffic." He followed up the success with a role in the 2002 baseball movie "The Rookie" and received critical acclaim for his daring turn as a closeted gay man in 2002's "Far From Heaven."

By 2004, Quaid got married for a third time, to Kimberly Buffington. In 2007, they made headlines for suing a pharmaceutical company after their newborn twins received an overdose of blood thinner at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
