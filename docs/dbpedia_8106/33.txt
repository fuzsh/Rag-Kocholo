The annual Christmas bazaar at All Saints' Church in Bishop's Stortford will help parishioners see the light.

The event at Hockerill on Saturday raised Â£1,300 after more than 500 people browsed a selection of stalls to pick up festive presents including favourites like home-made chutney.

Paul Bennett, churchwarden and bazaar organiser, said: "The money will be used for general church funds. In particular, we have been fitting lighting to our entrance paths as they are very dark at night; this is quite expensive but important for safety.

"The event was a delight in that there was a lovely atmosphere throughout the day. Stallholders and helpers worked as a happy team and, apart from the cash raised, the important purpose of the bazaar is to bring people from the whole parish together, both those who attend church and others."
