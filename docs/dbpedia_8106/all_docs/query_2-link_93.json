        "text": "THE choir’s Christmas concert was slated for Thaxted, but there has been a complete breakdown of the heating system in the church. Not wanting to disappoint our audience, or turn them into blocks of ice, they have relocated to All Saints Church, Hockerill, Bishop’s Stortford CM23 2DY on the same day, Saturday 14 December, with a new start time of 7.30pm.\n\nAll Saints is somewhat unique in that it operates a licensed bar, and interval drinks can be pre-ordered before the start. They hope to see you on the 14th for what will be a lovely musical celebration of Christmas conducted by Alex Chaplin, complete with an excerpt from Messiah, carols for choir and audience and featuring a Brass Quintet with Sue Graham Smith on keyboards.\n\nTickets at £15 full, £11 concession, £5 under 16s are now available online (no booking fee) at www.harlowchorus.ticketsource.co.uk or by phone from Julia Dimon on 01277 362440."
