        "text": "Some people may think that church is only for people who aren’t like them. But we believe that God’s love and peace is for everyone, no matter what your past or current situation. At All Saints’ we are each discovering the difference that following Jesus makes to our lives.\n\nClose this section\n\nWe aim to be a respectful community where people can feel at home and meet with God. Our services aim to evoke a sense of holiness, mystery and a foretaste of heaven. (Our Songs and Stories service is more informal). When you visit us, there will be people to welcome you and give you the books you need to follow the service. The service will be clearly structured with some or all of the following: Bible readings, a sermon, prayers, hymns, holy communion. There may be a collection towards the cost of the church. At a Mass you are encouraged to receive the bread and wine or a personal blessing at the altar rail. You are very welcome to stay to chat after the service.\n\nClose this section\n\nOur main service is the Sunday Sung Mass at 10am, with Sunday School. On the first Sunday of each month the service uses more accessible words and hymns, without Sunday School.\n\nClose this section\n\nNo, you are free to simply observe or participate as much as feels comfortable for you. The service can be followed in the service booklet provided.\n\nClose this section\n\nChildren are very welcome at All Saints’ and you shouldn’t be embarrassed if they become restless or noisy. There is more information about the facilities and activities we have for children.\n\nClose this section\n\nNo – please be aware that the church is not as warm as most centrally heated buildings.\n\nClose this section\n\nThe church and Hall have separate step-free access but there are steps inside parts of each building. More information about accessability is available.\n\nClose this section\n\nUnfortunately, the church does not have any parking, including disabled parking. Most people park outside the church on Stansted Road for Sunday services and evening concerts. There is more information about parking.\n\nClose this section"
