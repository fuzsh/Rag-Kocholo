        "text": "October 2012\n\nA bumper collection of produce was donated to Harlow Foodbank recently by the pupils of Summercroft Primary School.\n\nAs part of the schools Harvest celebrations, a special assembly was held in All Saints Church, Hockerill, to which parents were invited. The children sang songs and shared their thoughts about how we can help others.\n\nHeadteacher Michael Smith said –\n\n“The children presented a moving and inspiring asssembly in music and word. They really got across the message of how we should help our neighbours in need. We were thrilled to once again support the Harlow Foodbank whose mission is to feed local people in crisis.”\n\nThe pictures show the school housecaptains preparing the goods ready for their collection by the Foodbank volunteers."
