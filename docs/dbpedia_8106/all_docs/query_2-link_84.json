        "text": "Continuing with a theme of seasonal pieces, here is Snow. Like ‘Stocking and Shirt’ (Piece of the Week 49) this formed part of a much bigger piece commissioned for the 25th anniversary of Sing for Pleasure (who, this year, are celebrating their 60th anniversary!).\n\nIt’s written for upper voices in two parts and piano (organ in the first performance), and was later published by OUP as no. 2 of ‘At the Turn of the Year’. The poem is by Walter de la Mare, who was a prolific writer, particularly for children, in the first half of the twentieth century. He is today particularly known as the compiler of an excellent and fascinating anthology of poetry, Come Hither, as well as for his own poems for young people. ‘Snow’ is a short and characterful poem, beginning ‘No breath of wind, No gleam of sun’, and describes a scene of wintry desolation, later enlivened by a single ray of sun and a lonely robin. This landscape suggested to me the accompanying motive of chords built up on parallel augmented fourths, above which the two vocal parts exploit a range of mainly stepwise shapes, often imitating each other to create an overlapping texture.\n\nThis performance is a beautiful but unusual one – rather than by a young peoples’ choir it is by two professional sopranos, Maria Jette and Sonja Tengblad, with Philip Brunelle at the piano.\n\nThe sheet music is published by Oxford University Press. Wrap up warm!\n\nMany years ago, I took part in a rather innovative Anglia TV documentary. It was about Constable Country – the land around the river Stour near Dedham, on the Essex-Suffolk border, where the painter John Constable grew up and painted many of his most famous paintings. But rather than being a mere travelogue, this programme sought to combine painting, poetry, and music, by inviting three creative artists to respond to the landscape that inspired Constable, and to his paintings themselves. Thus, the painter John Addyman, the poet Kevin Crossley-Holland, and I spent some time steeped in the landscape and responded in our own way. I found myself setting some of Kevin’s poetry to music, studying John’s paintings (as well as Constable’s), and providing instrumental music that would accompany the various landscape images in the film. But, unusually for a composer, instead of writing the music after the film was complete, my music was required first, and the film was fitted around it to some extent, though some of the music was designed to be faded in and out as required. The music was all recorded in studio in an old house somewhere near the Suffolk coast – I can’t remember where now – and the baritone James Meek, the cellist Joanna Borrett, and the flautist Duke Dobing, were joined by me on the piano.\n\nI recently found an old VHS tape of the TV documentary (made in 1989), which I’m hoping to get digitised – but in the meanwhile I do have an audio recording of some of the musical sections, and so I’d like to introduce my piece Reflections, for cello and piano. This piece was directly inspired by the paintings of both artists, who, in their very different ways, liked to study and paint the reflective images in the always moving water – and I’ve recently taken that original recording and added reflective images of trees by the River Stour, a few miles upstream from Constable Country, but on the edge of the town of Sudbury, where John Addyman lived and worked. Here is a link to some of John Addyman’s Suffolk paintings.\n\nHere is a link to a performance of Reflections (with images and score), played by Joanna Borrett and myself, and here is a link to obtain the sheet music.\n\nAnd here is a link to Joanna Borrett’s Soundcloud page, where you can hear her beautifully playing her own music and that of others.\n\nIt’s been so wet and windy in the last week here in the UK that my song Stocking and Shirt (for upper voices in two parts and piano) flew into my mind. It’s a setting of a poem by James Reeves (1909-78) which describes clothes on a washing-line catching in the wind, ‘dancing together’, and finally being grabbed by the storm and flung over the hedge, while the ‘housewife’ (remember this poem was written several generations ago) screams ‘Stop!!’. The poem is very much of its time, but it portrays an exciting picture which I set to music as part of the cantata that I wrote for the 25th anniversary of the Sing for Pleasure organisation in 1989 (you can read more about Sing for Pleasure, and the cantata, in Piece of the Week 36 – Autumn).\n\nI shall never forget the voices of the excited children singing this song at the first performance, and one of the choirs that was taking part, the Central Singers of Chichester (director Nikki Bennison) took it into their repertoire and later won the BBC Choir of the Year competition with it!\n\nI set the words to a fast-moving 6/8 melody, mainly in the Lydian mode (G major but with C sharp) which rises and falls in interlocking thirds and seconds – and to accentuate the feeling of windy weather and breathlessness the melody is shared between the two parts, each taking a short phrase and holding on the last note while the next phrase is sung by the other voice:\n\n(voice 1) Stocking and shirt (voice 2) can trip and prance,\n\n(voice 1) Though nobody’s in them (voice 2) to make them dance!\n\n(voice 1) See how they waltz (voice 2) or minuet… (etc.)\n\nLater on I asked the singers to shout the words in capitals:\n\n(v.1) COME!\n\n(v.2) Cries the wind to stocking and shirt! AWAY!\n\n(v.1) Cries the wind to blouse and skirt…. (etc.)\n\nThankfully, each voice has a chance to recover their singing tone after the shout. Later on they are required to shout STOP! In the same way.\n\nAfter this excitement the music calms down for a quiet ending, one voice echoing the other as at the beginning:\n\n(v.1) STOP! Cries the housewife (v.2) but all too late,\n\n(v.1) Her clothes have passed (v.2) the furthest gate;\n\n(v.1) They are gone for ever (v.2) in the bright blue sky,\n\n(v.1) And only the handkerchiefs (v.2) wave goodbye…\n\n(v.1) goodbye…..(v.2)goodbye…..\n\nAnd the piano part climbs and diminuendos into the distance.\n\nA few years after the first performance it was published by Oxford University Press, along with two other songs, to make a set of three separate octavos called ‘At the Turn of the Year’ – the other two movements being Snow and Wisselton, Wasselton.\n\nHere’s a performance of Stocking and Shirt, and the sheet music is available here. Let’s hope for calmer weather now!\n\nThis time last year, I made a resolution to post a new ‘Piece of the Week’ every week – and that was a resolution that I largely kept (the only reason I didn’t get to no. 53 is because some weeks I posted newsletters instead). Piece of the Week no. 1 was my New Year Carol, and this year I’d like to celebrate the New Year in a different way.\n\nFor me, as doubtless for many of us, the past year had its joys and its sorrows, and almost everybody I spoke to yesterday hoped that 2024 would be ‘a better year’ than last year. So I thought that my song Rainbow might be an appropriate way to welcome in the year. This song originated during the Covid lockdown, and you will recall the rainbows in front windows all over the country, in thankfulness for the tremendous work done by doctors, nurses, and carers during that time of isolation and loss. But the rainbow has a wider meaning – healing, treasure (the ‘pot of gold’), birth, hope, good fortune, diversity, rain, fertility, new beginnings, ‘somewhere over the rainbow’ and more…\n\nMy ‘rainbow’ was a way of bringing family and friends together who were at that time scattered across Southern England, only able to communicate with each other by digital means, so I wrote this song for them to sing and record remotely while I got to grips with the delights of iMovie, NotePerformer, and Audacity – a skill so many musicians acquired during lockdown.\n\nIt is for SATB choir, or SA (or unison) voices, all with keyboard accompaniment. You can see and hear the result here, and you can see detail of how to obtain the music here, where there is also a link to a longer blog that I wrote at the time.\n\nThe image is of the display made by my granddaughters for their front window.\n\nI hope that this rainbow song might bring us new joy, comfort, healing, and good fortune as we celebrate new beginnings in 2014. Happy New Year!\n\nWhile the Oxford Book of Flexible Anthems was being put together in 2007 we discovered, somewhat at the last minute, that we really needed a new and easy Epiphany anthem, and this task fell to me to provide. I decided to set some very well-known words to a new tune.\n\nMany of us were introduced to John Henry Hopkins’ carol ‘We three Kings of Orient are’ at primary school, and it has probably stuck with us ever since. Although the gently flowing modally flavoured verse with its folky 6/8 rhythm can convey a slightly ‘oriental’ feel, especially with the little organ interlude with which it is sometimes adorned, the resolute major key chorus (‘Oh, star of wonder…) can easily become somewhat riotous. Traditionally the second, third, and fourth verses are sung by the three kings in turn, with all singing the first and last verses, giving opportunity for a variety of ‘kings’ as the carol unfolds, and for some cheerful singing for all in the chorus.\n\nFor my setting of these words, Star of Wonder, I used the same verse-chorus pattern, with minor key verses with opportunity for soloists, and a major key chorus – but the mood and rhythm is rather more march-like, and the change from minor to major is more pronounced. My aim was to provide a good strong tune, easy to learn, bearing in mind that there isn’t much rehearsal opportunity for Epiphany anthems as Christmas is only just over. I made just one small alteration to the words: the original Heaven sings Alleluia, Alleluia the earth replies is replaced with Alleluia, alleluia, Heaven sings and earth replies – this makes the lines of equal length, and gave me the opportunity for a loud Alleluia followed by a quiet one, as if it were echoing from heaven to earth. Throughout, the verses are in unison and the chorus in harmony, with an optional descant in the final bars.\n\nThe original version, in The Oxford Book of Flexible Anthems, is flexibly scored in three parts for SABar; here the lower two parts are optional and the whole thing can be sung in unison. There is also a version for SATB here, and an SABar version is also published separately. (All the above links are to Forwoods ScoreStore who offer a 20% discount on OUP publications in January 2024). These two versions are also available as digital pdf downloads from www.chimesmusicdigital.com (UK) and Sheet Music Plus (USA). For all versions the accompaniment is organ or piano, and an orchestral accompaniment is also available on hire from OUP.\n\nHere are some recordings:\n\nThis one on YouTube, from The Church of the Epiphany, Qatar\n\nThis one on Soundcloud, from All Saints Hockerill, Bishops Stortford, UK\n\nAnd this is The Oxford Choir on Spotify\n\nHope you had a lovely Christmas Day, and a fruitful period of relaxation as we move towards the New Year.\n\nDear friends,\n\nThis newsletter brings you my Christmas greetings and a summary of my composing activities over the last twelve months.\n\nSo here goes:\n\nLast Christmas saw performances of my Christmas carols in many parts of the world, as well as UK performances of my longer cantatas, O Come Emmanuel, A Light in the Stable, and A Feast for Christmas. A highlight for me was a lovely first live performance of a new carol, Sweet Babe, sang she, by the Houston Chamber Choir, conductor Robert Simpson, in Houston, Texas.\n\nIn March we were delighted to be at a BBC Singers recording at Maida Vale Studios of my Peace in the World, a magical performance conducted by Grace Rossiter and broadcast on BBC Radio 3 in June. Another broadcast, this time on BBC Radio 4, was of Where shall wisdom be found (from O Come Emmanuel), beautifully sung by Ely Cathedral Choir, directed by Sarah MacDonald.\n\nEaster saw several performances of Wondrous Cross, in the UK and the Netherlands, and during this time I was also busy finalizing my choral cantata, Endless Song. Celebrating the joy of singing, this thirty-minute piece was commissioned by the Waltham Singers, conductor Andrew Fardell, and, accompanied by the Maggini String Quartet, was colourfully performed in Great Waltham Church, Essex, in June. Summer also saw at least two performances of A Summer Garland (also originally commissioned by the Waltham Singers), both in different parts of Cambridgeshire. It was also lovely to hear a revival of my anthem He will speak peace (as far as I know, last performed in 1992) by Selwyn College Chapel Choir, director Sarah MacDonald, on Remembrance Sunday in November.\n\nAn initiative that has occupied me this year has been arranging popular hymns and worship songs to make anthems for small church choirs. The Colne Edition Prayer and Praise for Choirs series are available as digital downloads (pdfs) and details are here.\n\nInstrumentally, it was great to see revivals of pieces including Dances for Wind Quintet (Ormonde Ensemble, Colchester) North Sea Sketches (Hampshire Recorder Sinfonia, director Helen Hooker) and Suffolk Sketches (Beth Spendlove, solo violin, in Halesworth). And Circus Skills (for various wind instruments with piano, in several books) and Blue Bassoon, have been republished by a new educational music publisher, Clifton Edition.\n\nI’ve also been spending quite a lot of time writing piano pieces recently, and published this year were Aspects of Blue (Editions Musica Ferrum) for intermediate level players, and also two arrangements for Isata Kanneh-Mason’s book Piano Inspiration (ABRSM). Jan and I have continued to add new easy arrangements to the Janet and Alan Bullard Piano Series. And I’ve also written eight hymn-tune preludes for the final two books of the Oxford Hymn Settings for Organists series, due to be published next year.\n\nAnd finally, I was delighted that my Candle Carol, written during lockdown, was included in Carols for Choirs 6, published in the summer by Oxford University Press. I was lucky to be able to go to the excellent launch concert of the book at Merton College, Oxford recently, and hear a range of new carols and meet some of the composers involved.\n\nDetails of all the above pieces and collections are searchable on this website. And, if you’ve read this far, please accept my very best wishes for Christmas and for the New Year!!\n\nVisual artists and composers have responded to the Nativity scene for many centuries, and in many ways – and that calming image of the stable communicates a sense of peace alongside a joyful promise for the future.\n\nI’ve chosen two of my several carols to Nativity texts – one which I wrote some time ago, and the other one recently.\n\nScots Nativity is almost certainly my most popular carol – I’m not talking ‘blockbuster’ performances, but it appears very regularly in carol concerts and services. It’s difficult for me to assess why that is, but I suspect it’s due to its ‘folky’ character and modal aspects, its traditional Scottish words, and the characteristic reversed dotted rhythm sometimes known as the ‘scotch snap’. I wrote it over twenty years ago now, (on a hot summer’s day on the wall outside Ely Cathedral) as a duet for two voices, for my wife Jan (who was born in Scotland) and daughter Mary to sing. Later I added lower voices, and there are in fact now three versions, SA, SATB, and SAMen, all published by Oxford University Press, separately and in various collections. There’s also a version translated into Swedish!\n\nThe words of Scots Nativity date from the sixteenth or seventeenth century, and I also used seventeenth-century words, probably by William Ballet, for my much more recent carol, Sweet Babe, sang she. Here I was aiming for the same mood (and as it happens, in the same key) but with an unaccompanied and more richly scored texture. The text here is from an early seventeenth century lute song, beginning\n\nSweet was the song the Virgin sung, when she to Bethlehem in Judah came,\n\nand was delivered of a son, That blessed Jesus hath to name.\n\nSweet babe, sang she….\n\nIn my setting I mainly give the chorus a background role, singing an undulating and slowly varying lullaby, while a solo soprano (or semichorus) sings the text reflectively in the foreground. Passages of gentle ‘alleluias’ make contrasting interludes for all voices together. In many ways it is different from Scots Nativity, but I think it paints a picture which complements it.\n\nThere are many recordings online of Scots Nativity: here’s one, by the Bearsden Choir, just north of Glasgow.\n\nAnd here’s a lovely recording of Sweet Babe, sang she, by the Houston Chamber Choir, Texas.\n\nScots Nativity (upper voices) is available here, and the SATB version here. It is also in Carols for Choirs 5, and in several other OUP collections.\n\nSweet Babe, sang she is available here.\n\nWith my very best wishes for Christmas!\n\nCandles are an important part of Advent – I’m not talking here about the Advent candles that sit on your dining table and burn down one number for each day (if you remember to blow them out in time) but the arrangement of five candles in church, with one lit on each of the four Sundays before Christmas and the central one lit on Christmas Day (or Christmas Eve). Traditionally the four candles represent hope, peace, joy, and love, with the fifth one representing light in the darkness.\n\nI wrote Candle Carol (words and music) for a small village church, and it is for SATB, (TB optional, so it can just be sung by upper voices), accompanied by piano or organ. The voice parts are intended to be tuneful and accessible, and the four verses refer to the four candles, linked by a chorus:\n\nCandle of hope, candle of peace,\n\nSending a message for anguish to cease;\n\nCandle of joy, candle of love,\n\nGranting the gift of the Saviour above.\n\nIn the event, the scheduled Christmas service for which it was written was cancelled due to the Covid lockdown, and the following Christmas, with the country still under restrictions, it was performed by a socially distanced choir of four, and also expanded to eight for a virtual recording with a digital backing track. So, to me, the carol brings back memories of a cold and nearly empty church and the isolation of lockdown, but moderated and sustained by the hope, peace, joy and love of the Christmas message.\n\nHere’s a link to the recording, performed and produced by the Cantus Firmus Trust.\n\nCandle Carol is now available for all to sing as it is included in Carols for Choirs 6 (Oxford University Press), published earlier this year.\n\nIt is also available separately as a digital download from OUP’s digital providers, for example JW Pepper in USA, and Chimes Music Digital in UK.\n\nThere must be innumerable musical settings of this text, many combined with the Nunc Dimittis to form the evening canticles. But at this time of the year, the Magnificat (Song of Mary) assumes a greater importance as it is also one of the Advent readings.\n\nI have made four settings of it, each with a Nunc Dimittis, but in the future I might try writing a larger scale Magnificat setting in several movements.\n\nIt’s a fascinating text to set – the opening section can be big and joyous (as if all people are rejoicing), but just as characterful would be to view the event quietly, from Mary’s point of view, reflecting the wonder and ‘lowliness’ that she feels in her role. Later on, there is the opportunity to respond to various key words: mighty, mercy, strength, and then the universally applicable message of ‘putting down the mighty, and exalting the humble and meek’. The complete words are printed at the end of this post.\n\nSo I’d like to share with you two of my easier settings, one for unison or two-part voices, and one for SATB or two-part voices.\n\nLet’s start with the setting for unison or two-part voices, accompanied by piano or organ. I wrote this setting, ‘The Colchester Service’ specially for The Oxford Book of Easy Flexible Anthems and aimed for maximum flexibility in the vocal scoring: I set myself the task of writing a unison melody with a range of just an octave, so that it can be sung by any or all voices, and I added an optional second part beneath it. Either part can be sung by almost any voice, so it is suitable for many sizes and types of choirs. My aim in this setting was to write a free-flowing melody, responding to the text, of course, (in a modern translation) but also aiming to achieve something unified and ‘folky’ and a little different from many more traditionally ‘churchy’ settings of the text. The recording here emphasises that aspect – although it is with organ rather than piano. Here it is on YouTube with a scrolling score, and here is the same recording on Spotify.\n\nThe other setting – ‘The Essex Service’ – was commissioned for a choral festival in Brentwood Cathedral organised by the Essex and East London Branch of the RSCM in 2015. Originally for voices in two parts, I later worked it up into an SATB version. Again, I sought to achieve that mood of wondering that Mary must have felt, beginning with a musical line that gradually opens out from a major third to an octave and back again, with the lower part moving in the opposite direction to the upper one. Compared with the ‘Colchester’ setting, this ‘Essex’ setting then responds more directly to the mood of the different verses, with greater contrast in the ideas. Finally, the music settles down on a single note for the ‘Glory be to the Father’ section, builds to a climax and relaxes for the final Amens, in a condensed version of the opening line. You can hear this setting, with a scrolling score, here, performed by the choir of Chelmsford Cathedral directed by James Davy.\n\nIt’s been a privilege to be able to set these iconic words to music several times; they offer so much to all composers to respond to in their own way.\n\nScores of the settings are here:\n\nMagnificat (Colchester Service) in the Oxford Book of Easy Flexible Anthems\n\nMagnificat (Essex Service) Sheet Music Direct (SATB version) or Sheet Music Direct (two-part version) – or contact me for a single specimen copy.\n\nAnd finally, here are the words of the Magnificat in the more traditional version:\n\nMy soul doth magnify the Lord.\n\nAnd my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.\n\nFor he hath regarded: the lowliness of his handmaiden:\n\nFor behold, from henceforth: all generations shall call me blessed.\n\nFor he that is mighty hath magnified me: and holy is his Name.\n\nAnd his mercy is on them that fear him: throughout all generations.\n\nHe hath shewed strength with his arm: he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.\n\nHe hath put down the mighty from their seat: and hath exalted the humble and meek.\n\nHe hath filled the hungry with good things: and the rich he hath sent empty away.\n\nHe remembering his mercy hath holpen his servant Israel:\n\nAs he promised to our forefathers, Abraham and his seed for ever.\n\nGlory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost,\n\nAs it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be: World without end, Amen.\n\nThose brought up in the traditions of the Church of England may know that the Collect for last Sunday begins ‘Stir up, we beseech thee, O Lord, the wills of thy faithful people’. But for many of us, ‘Stir-up Sunday’ (the last Sunday before Advent) is literally the time when the kitchen gets busy with the stirring up of mincemeat, Christmas cakes and puddings, and other delights of the season! And, certainly, some lovely aromas have been drifting from our kitchen over the last few days, and mince-pie ‘tasting sessions’ have already taken place.\n\nAll of which brings me to this week’s ‘piece of the week’ – Christmas Recipe. For unaccompanied choir SATB, this song is based on a traditional Christmas recipe from an early nineteenth-century cookery book. It’s one of those recipes where you start small and end large, and is obviously aimed at the capacious bellies of those who had cooks and housekeepers to look after them! So to begin:\n\nTake a large olive, stone it, and stuff it with a paste made of anchovies, capers, and oil. Put the stuffed olive inside a boned lark. Put the stuffed lark inside a fat quail. Put the quail…. (and so it continues, with a partridge, pheasant, a goose, all put inside the turkey). And then:\n\nPut in a saucepan with olives and cloves, and carrots and celery and small squares of ham, and parsley and bay-leaves and black peppercorns…. And so it goes on – you get the idea – and finally our Christmas Feast is served!\n\nThe general pomposity of this kind of recipe, and the time that it was written, suggested a traditional unaccompanied style reflecting the music of two hundred years ago, so that’s what I did, and I hope that choirs and audiences enjoy its humour. Although often sung separately, it’s actually a movement from my cantata ‘A Feast for Christmas’ which is a predominantly lively and secular approach to Christmas cheer, for SATB choir, piano or brass quintet, and optional narrator and childrens’ choir. This was commissioned in 2007 by the South Chiltern Choral Society and their then conductor, the late Gwyn Arch (father of Dave Arch, the MD for Strictly Come Dancing!).\n\nIf you would like to make this Christmas Recipe – or simply enjoy the music – here is a link to the scrolling score, and here is a link to purchase it. You can also see details of the complete ‘Feast for Christmas’ here.\n\nAnd don’t forget to get started on making those pies and puddings!"
