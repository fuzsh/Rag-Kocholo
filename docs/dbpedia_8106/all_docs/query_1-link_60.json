        "text": "The annual Christmas bazaar at All Saints' Church in Bishop's Stortford will help parishioners see the light.\n\nThe event at Hockerill on Saturday raised £1,300 after more than 500 people browsed a selection of stalls to pick up festive presents including favourites like home-made chutney.\n\nPaul Bennett, churchwarden and bazaar organiser, said: \"The money will be used for general church funds. In particular, we have been fitting lighting to our entrance paths as they are very dark at night; this is quite expensive but important for safety.\n\n\"The event was a delight in that there was a lovely atmosphere throughout the day. Stallholders and helpers worked as a happy team and, apart from the cash raised, the important purpose of the bazaar is to bring people from the whole parish together, both those who attend church and others.\""
