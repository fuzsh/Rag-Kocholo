We work closely with a range of other RE funders, including the Association of Church College Trusts.\n\nThe Association of Church College Trusts was formed in 1979, as a loosely-knit organisation of autonomous trusts. In their different ways the Trusts support and promote work in education. Although all the Trusts have some involvement with RE and church-related education, each has a different emphasis and some have additional priorities. Some Trusts focus on projects in their own geographical location.\n\nAll Saints Educational Trust\n\nImaginative new projects which will enhance the Church’s contribution to higher and further education are considered for funding.\n\nDate for applications: 31st March annually.\n\nWebsite: http://www.aset.org.uk\n\nHockerill Educational Foundation\n\nCorporate grants to support the development of Religious Education, particularly in the Dioceses of Chelmsford and St Albans.\n\nDate for applications: By 1 March each year.\n\nWebsite: http://www.hockerillfoundation.org.uk\n\nKeswick Hall Trust\n\nGrants are considered for research in Religious Education.
