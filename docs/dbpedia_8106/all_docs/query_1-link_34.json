However Christmas time points us to Jesus the Prince of Peace who will one day make all wars cease, and in the here and now brings us peace with God and between individuals At this time we celebrate the amazing good news that God loved us so much that he sent his son into the world to bring light, live among us, demonstrate his revolutionary love, and save us from our sins.\n\nThe churches of our town are organising a wide variety of different ways that YOU can join in celebrating the enduring good news of God’s precious gift to us.
