Other ways to see regular updates of progress on current projects are by following us on Facebook or Twitter. Our Twitter feed has been running since 2013 and our new Facebook page was launched this year. Links to these can be found at the bottom of the page. They provide a fascinating insight into what is happening out on site in churches and back in the factory.
