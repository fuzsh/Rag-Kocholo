About Ofsted

Ofsted have been inspecting schools on a regular basis since 2005. After a cursory warning period they undertake a thorough examination of the whole school. Inspectors will sit in on classes, assessing each teacher's teaching ability. They will also evaluate the way the current curriculum is implemented, and how the progress of each student is tracked throughout their tenure.

Each school is graded on a four point scale: 1 being outstanding, 2 being good, 3 means they require improvement, and 4 signifying inadequate. Those schools attaining an outstanding or good grade might not be re-inspected for as long as five years; while those receiving lower grades will be reassessed with greater frequency, with little or no notice prior to the inspectors arriving.
