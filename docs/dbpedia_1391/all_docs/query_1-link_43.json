        "text": "Raúl García, one of the Club’s emblems, was calm despite the tie in the League debut and very optimistic towards the Champions League.\n\nIker Andrés / Photo: Ángel Gutiérrez\n\nRaúl García gave a press conference after Thursday’s morning training, in which the player from Navarra was confident in performing at a good level in this campaign, \"Last year, it was said that the team was not physically well in many stages during the year, and then it was shown that it wasn’t true\".\n\nWith last campaign’s precedents as an insignia, the top scorer of the pre-season sees the team calm and certain to keep fighting, especially in the maximum European competition. \"We’ll see the draw because we’re interested, but whoever comes, we’re ready to do a good job in the Champions League. Beforehand, there are always easy rivals, but anyone can complicate your life”.\n\nAfter the great role played in the Champions League last season, the team’s sights are set on competing like that again, \"with the same hopes as last year\", the player from Navarra said, while adding \"The team always wants to peak. Last year was, as if to say, the first time that the group played in the competition. We know that it’s a top-level tournament, so we have to be prepared to deal with any kind of game because all rivals are strong. I hope we can play the same role as last year\", the player claimed."
