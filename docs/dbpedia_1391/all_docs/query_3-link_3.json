I am proud to be able to help people at their most vulnerable and in moments of fear and uncertainty.\n\nThrough a career in medicine, I have had the privilege of working with people from all walks of life.\n\nWhile I’m not a politician by trade and did not seek out a life in politics, it’s clear the interests of the people of Washington are not being heard in D.C.\n\nWith your help, I believe we can become united by one common goal: to restore the safe and prosperous lives of our WA families."
