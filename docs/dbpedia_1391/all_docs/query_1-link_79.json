        "text": "The nonprofit Sundance Institute announced the 2024 grant recipients for the Sundance Institute Documentary Fund, supporting the work of nonfiction filmmakers globally.\n\nThis year, 28 projects have been selected to receive an unrestricted grant, with the total granting pool standing at $1,450,000 — almost half a million dollars more than last year’s fund thanks to increased support for our granting. This granting cycle’s recipients represent all stages of the process, with five projects in development, 15 in production, seven in post-production, and one completed project in its impact campaign. The Documentary Fund seeks to serve as a stable source of support for inventive nonfiction works that create cultural and social impact by tackling a variety of timely and pressing issues. Grants are made possible by Open Society Foundations, John Templeton Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, and Sony Music Entertainment thanks to Sony Music’s Global Justice Fund.\n\nIn 2024, thanks to new support from the John Templeton Foundation, the Institute is able to increase the size of the Documentary Fund’s granting pool by $500,000 per year. Through this new generous support the Fund is providing grants that support innovative and daring nonfiction storytelling projects aligned with Templeton’s mission of supporting interdisciplinary research and catalyzing conversations that inspire awe and wonder.\n\nThe Fund includes the first grantees selected by the Sundance Institute | Sony Music Vision Initiative, a new partnership between the Sundance Institute Documentary Film Program and Sony Music Entertainment, funded by Sony Music’s Global Social Justice Fund. Through granting and engagement opportunities, including educational sessions on music in film, this initiative is aimed at elevating documentary film projects by BIPOC filmmakers that demonstrate a significant music component or innovative approach to audio and sound.\n\n“It has always been critical to the Sundance’s mission to uplift talented and underrepresented voices seeking to create thoughtful and thought-provoking work that elevates and advances cultural dialogue, and we are thrilled to celebrate the variety of perspectives and approaches this year’s grantees bring to the table with their projects,” said Paola Mottura, Documentary Film Fund Director and Kristin Feeley, Director, Documentary Film & Artist Programs. “During this challenging time for our industry, we are grateful to be able to deepen our support for the global documentary community. This work is urgent and it is an honor to be a part of these talented artists’ journeys and help them get closer to connecting with their audiences. We’re appreciative of our partners in making this support possible and we look forward to experiencing these risk-taking works.”\n\nThe Documentary Fund prioritizes the support of artists from historically marginalized communities and seeks to amplify global voices telling crucial stories. More than half of the grant proposals came from outside the U.S., with the final group of grantees representing 25 countries. The majority of projects (92%) receiving grants are directed by artists from communities that have been traditionally marginalized and 60% are from first-time feature directors.\n\nThrough careful craft and fearless vision, projects in this year’s slate have the power to instill resilience through family and community legacies, transcend new frontiers in ritual and belief, spotlight the impact of grassroots activism, explore tender reconnections with loved ones through the arts, and empower personal expression in the face of oppressive policies and governments.\n\nWhile many of the projects supported this year are from early-career filmmakers, this cycle of granting also supports projects from mid-career storytellers, including: Hawa, produced by Christian Popp, who also produced Becoming Cary Grant (2017); House of Earth directed by Ljubomir Stefanov (Honeyland, 2019); Leap of Faith directed by Nicholas Ma, who produced Won’t You Be My Neighbor? (2018); Stallions directed by Rita Baghdadi (Sirens, 2022); Untitled Philippines Project, the fifth feature from filmmaker PJ Raval (Call Her Ganda, 2018); and The First Plantation, directed by Jason Fitzroy Jeffers, who produced T, the 2020 winner of the Golden Bear for Best Short Film at Berlinale.\n\nPreviously supported projects have included: All That Breathes; American Factory; The Battle for Laikipia; Collective; Crip Camp: A Disability Revolution; Hale County This Morning, This Evening; Mija; Minding the Gap; The Mole Agent; No Other Land; Nocturnes; Strong Island; Sugarcane; The Territory; Time; and Union.\n\n2024 Documentary Fund Grantees:\n\nDEVELOPMENT\n\nBasketball Heaven (U.S.A.)\n\nDirector/Producer: Resita Cox\n\nA poetic portrait of the historic Black community in Kinston, North Carolina.
