        "meta_description": "Liver disease resulting from heart disease has generally been referred as “cardiac hepatopathy.” The two main forms of cardiac hepatopathy are acute cardiogenic liver injury (ACLI) and congestive hepatopathy (CH). ACLI most commonly occurs in the setting of acute cardiocirculatory failure, whereas CH results from passive venous congestion in the setting of chronic right-sided heart failure (HF). Both conditions often coexist and potentiate the deleterious effects of each other on the liver. In CH, the chronic passive congestion leads to sinusoidal hypertension, centrilobular fibrosis, and ultimately, cirrhosis (“cardiac cirrhosis”) and hepatocellular carcinoma. The differentiation between congestion and fibrosis currently represents an unmet need and a growing research area. Although cardiac cirrhosis may only arise after several decades of ongoing injury, the long-term survival of cardiac patients due to advances in medical and surgical treatments is responsible for the increased number of liver complications in this setting. Eventually, the liver disease could become as clinically relevant as the cardiac disease and further complicate its management.",

        "text": "3.2 Pathophysiology\n\nLiver damage in ACLI is the result of several mechanisms: passive congestion reduced hepatic blood flow, total body hypoxemia, inability to utilize oxygen, and ischemia/reperfusion injury. Necrosis, rather than apoptosis, is the main mode of death due to these mechanisms [31]. Although frequently multifactorial, the predominating mechanism of damage can be different depending on the underlying condition [7, 12]. In this regard, the most frequent diseases leading to ACLI are HF, respiratory failure, and septic shock, accounting for more than 90% of cases [7]. These diseases often coexist and lead to ACLI. Hence, Fuhrmann et al. identified more than one disease contributing to ACLI in 74% of their study population [27].\n\nAs mentioned previously, HF represents the main underlying condition in ACLI. The proportion of ACLI cases due to HF published in the literature ranges from 39 to 78% [7, 12, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28]. In this condition, the main mechanisms involved in the development of ACLI are passive congestion and ischemia of the liver. Indeed, in this scenario, ACLI is believed to reflect the extreme of a spectrum of liver injury that begins with passive hepatic congestion since the vast majority of patients have markedly elevated cardiac filling pressures [17, 22, 26, 32, 33]. Thus, several studies have shown how, despite similar hemodynamic derangements, only those with a pre-existing congestive liver developed ACLI [23, 29, 33]. This crucial role of passive congestion of the liver justifies the rare occurrence of ACLI in hemorrhagic or hypovolemic shock [7]. Most importantly, Seeto et al. showed that 15–20 minutes of hypotension is sufficient to provoke ACLI [33]. This explains why hemodynamic instability is not systematically observed, since such a brief period can easily be unrecognized.\n\nRespiratory failure accounts for approximately 15% of ACLI cases [7]. Severe hypoxemia resulting from an exacerbation of chronic respiratory disease is the main mechanism leading to ACLI. Very low levels of arterial pressure in oxygen (i.e., under 40 mmHg) are commonly observed, as well as the coexistence of hepatic venous congestion. In this setting, cardiac output and hepatic blood flow are normal or even increased [22, 23].\n\nSeptic shock is the cause of ACLI in 15–30% of cases. The prime factor leading to hypoxia is both the increased demands of oxygen and the decreased ability of hepatocytes to utilize oxygen [7]. It has been postulated that inflammatory mediators and endotoxins may be behind this abnormal oxygen utilization [7, 34, 35]. Although at the initial phases of septic shock hepatic blood flow is increased, the progression from high to low cardiac output may occur rapidly and aggravate the hypoxic damage [12].\n\nWhile the previously described mechanisms induced ACLI by causing liver hypoxia, it has been postulated that re-oxygenation is also required [7, 12]. Several observations support this role of ischemia/reperfusion injury in ACLI: (1) it has been described that liver cell necrosis occurs at the time of reperfusion not ischemia [7]; (2) the incidence and severity of CLN correlate with the duration of shock. In fulminant and refractory cardiogenic shock (median duration of shock was 3 hours), CLN was only observed in a minority of patients and was mild [21, 29], whereas earlier studies showed how the longer the period of shock the greater the severity and frequency of CLN [36, 37]. One explanation of these findings is that long-lasting shocks probably harbor transient periods of hemodynamic stability and re-oxygenation that can cause ischemia/reperfusion injury and subsequently induce ACLI. (3) In a minority of ACLI cases, liver necrosis is limited to the mediolobular zone and spares the centrilobular zone [38, 39, 40]. Henrion et al. postulated that this atypical histological pattern could be due to an incomplete liver reperfusion prior to death that only reached periportal and mediolobular liver cells. Hence, periportal and centrilobular cells would have survived, the former because of oxygen delivery remained sufficient, and the latter because of the absence of reperfusion injury. Mediolobular hepatocytes, on the other hand, would have been destroyed due to ischemia/reperfusion injury [7].\n\n3.3 Clinical presentation and diagnosis\n\nThe majority of ACLI cases occur in elderly men (i.e., 65–70 years) with congestive HF that has deteriorated over the past few days. It must be highlighted that a shock state is far from being a constant feature as is observed in around half of the cases. Moreover, the cardiac component may not be apparent at first evaluation as usual signs of HF, such as painful hepatomegaly, ankle edema, or hepatojugular reflux, are frequently lacking. Therefore, the diagnosis of ACLI cannot be rejected because of the absence of shock and of signs of HF, and in case of uncertainty, a cardiac evaluation is warranted [6, 7]. Symptoms due to ACLI are often absent or resemble those from acute viral hepatitis [24], and more commonly, the clinical picture is dominated by symptoms of the underlying conditions. Overt jaundice is absent at admission, and encephalopathy can develop but is usually the result of hemodynamic instability and hypoxia, rather than liver failure [7, 12].\n\nLaboratory tests show a substantial and rapid increase in aminotransferases and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels to 10–20 times the upper limit of normal, usually 1–3 days after hemodynamic deterioration. These elevations generally return to normal within 7–10 days if hemodynamic stability is restored [3, 41]. A progressive increase in bilirubin is usually seen but is seldom severe [3, 7, 12]. The higher values reported by recent series may be explained by the inclusion of more patients with septic shock. Nonetheless, the mean bilirubin value in these studies was lower than 6 mg/dL [27, 28]. Higher values may suggest progression to acute liver failure [6]. Unlike in children where hypoglycemia has been regarded as a distinct feature of ACLI, in adults both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia have been reported [7, 12]. Although no analytical alteration is pathognomonic of ACLI, there are some findings that suggest its diagnosis [7]: (1) an alanine aminotransferase (ALT)-to-LDH ratio <1.5 is of great help in the differential diagnosis as it is rarely seen in other etiologies of hepatitis [42]; (2) the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) generally peaks earlier and higher than ALT [41]. The rational behind this finding lays on the concentration of aminotransferases throughout the hepatic acinus. ALT reaches the highest concentration at the level of periportal hepatocytes (Rappaport liver zone 1) and the lowest concentration at the level of pericentral hepatocytes (Rappaport liver zone 3), while AST maintains a stable concentration throughout the entire acinus. Hence, after the hypoxic insult, the initial concentrations of AST are higher than those of ALT, since the lower oxygen concentration of pericentral hepatocytes makes them more susceptible to hypoxic damage [43]. Once the cause of liver damage is resolved, the concentration of ALT exceeds that of AST in subsequent days, due to its longer half-life (47 ± 10 hours versus 17 ± 5 hours, respectively) [44]. Aboelsoud et al. [41] universally observed this pattern, but it was only described in 75% of the cases in Henrion’s study [22]. The rapid decline and reversal of the AST-ALT ratio may explain these differences, and therefore, an ALT higher than AST should not discard ACLI; (3) an early and sharp deterioration in prothrombin activity and renal function also supports ACLI. Such abnormalities are unusual at presentation in patients with viral or drug-induced hepatitis, unless ALF is already established [7]. Figure 1 shows a typical biochemical profile of ACLI in a patient treated in our hospital.\n\nIn accordance with the above, diagnosis of ACLI is usually made when the following criteria are met [12, 22, 26]: (1) an appropriate clinical setting of cardiac, respiratory, or circulatory failure; (2) a severe increase in aminotransferase levels; and (3) exclusion of other causes of acute liver damage. The differential diagnosis for severe elevations of transaminases is relatively limited and includes ACLI, acute viral hepatitis, toxin- or drug-induced liver injury, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson’s disease, acute bile duct obstruction, and acute Budd-Chiari syndrome [44]. Imaging techniques are essential to rule out some of these etiologies and can also support the diagnosis by finding a dilation of inferior vena cava and suprahepatic veins due to passive congestion [7]. Liver biopsy is rarely necessary and only when the underlying cause remains unclear. It will show features of coagulative necrosis of centrilobular hepatocytes without significant inflammation (Figure 2A–C). In biopsies delayed several days, however, there may be neutrophils infiltrating the affected regions [25]. As already stated, necrosis rarely occurs predominantly in the middle zone [38, 39, 40].\n\n4.3 Clinical presentation and diagnosis\n\nCH may be asymptomatic for a long time, and frequently, its presence is suspected through abnormalities in liver tests [8]. Symptoms attributed to CH may include dull right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, early satiety, malaise, and mild jaundice [3]. The abdominal symptoms respond to the stretching of the liver capsule due to hepatic congestion and may occur in the absence of overt ascites or lower extremity edema. These symptoms, however, are usually masked by those related to right-sided HF [2].\n\nPhysical examination may often show hepatomegaly and signs of HF, including hepatojugular reflux and peripheral edema. A pulsatile liver may also be seen, and its loss suggests progression to cardiac cirrhosis [49]. Overt ascites is also a frequent finding, although it is rarely refractory. In a series of 83 patients with CH of whom only one had established cardiac cirrhosis, up to 57% had ascites. Moreover, ascites and edema had no relation to the extent of liver fibrosis, and therefore, they are due to elevated right-sided cardiac pressure hitting the sinusoidal network [50]. The differentiation of cardiac ascites from cirrhotic ascites can be cumbersome. In these conditions, the serum-ascites albumin gradient is ≥1.1 g/dL since they both respond to hepatic sinusoidal hypertension [79]. There are, however, some ascites findings that are useful to make a differential diagnosis. Cardiac ascites has higher protein levels (>2.5 g/dL). This is due to preserved liver synthetic function and absence of capillarization of the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells [3, 8, 80]. The latter refers to the lost of fenestrae and development of a basement membrane by these cells as a consequence of liver fibrosis. In cirrhosis, these features make hepatic sinusoids less leaky and prevent the passage of proteins to the space of Disse and from here to the peritoneal fluid [81]. Other less reliable findings in cardiac ascites are higher LDH levels and higher red blood cell counts due to leaking of red blood cells into the ascites via lymph tissue, with resulting lysis [80]. Despite these differences, a significant number of cases are still misclassified. Measurement of serum B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or of its inactive pro-hormone (N-terminal-proBNP) in serum and ascites has been recently suggested as an aid tool in uncertain cases. Thus, Sheer et al. reported that both serum and ascites NT-proBNP levels had high sensitivity and specificity in predicting HF as the cause of ascites [82]. More recently, Farias et al. found serum BNP to be superior to the total ascitic fluid protein concentration with regard to discriminating cardiac ascites from cirrhotic ascites. A serum BNP cutoff of >364 pg/mL had 98% sensitivity, 99% specificity, 99% diagnostic accuracy, and a positive likelihood ratio of 168.1 for the diagnosis of cardiac ascites. Conversely, a serum BNP cutoff of ≤182 pg/mL was excellent for ruling out ascites due to heart failure [79].\n\nThe differentiation of cardiac cirrhotic ascites from cardiac ascites without cirrhosis is especially challenging and of great clinical importance. On the one hand, the diagnosis of cardiac cirrhosis warrants further evaluations such as bi-annual surveillance ultrasonography or endoscopic screening for esophageal varices. On the other hand, its presence may preclude a heart transplant or require a combined heart-liver transplant. Apart from some diagnostic tools such as liver biopsy and hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) that will be later discussed, there are some clinical clues that help in the differential diagnosis. In patients with cardiac ascites without cirrhosis, splenomegaly and spider angiomata are absent, and varices are rarely identified on upper endoscopy [3, 49]. This can be explained by the fact that varices represent collateral vessels from the high-pressure portal system to the low-pressure systemic circulation, and in CH without cirrhosis, no pressure gradient exists because pressure remains high along the entire path of venous return to the right atrium [50]. Complications of cirrhosis may occur in the late stages of cardiac cirrhosis. Although in the past the traditional patient with cardiac cirrhosis died from his cardiac disease before progressing to decompensated cirrhosis, advances in medical and surgical treatments are responsible for the increased number of liver complications in this setting [3]. The risk of hepatocarcinoma after the Fontan procedure is probably the best example. The success of this surgery to palliate right-sided congenital heart lesions permits long-term survival in the setting of elevated right-sided heart pressures. Eventually, the liver disease could become as clinically important as the cardiac disease and further complicate its management [51].\n\nBesides the presence of right-sided HF (or other cause of high central pressures) and the aforementioned clinical findings, the diagnosis of CH should be further supported on compatible results of diagnostic tools and exclusion of other possible causes of liver disease [49, 50].\n\n4.3.1 Biochemical profile\n\nElevation of serum cholestasis markers (alkaline phosphatase, GGT, and bilirubin) is characteristic of CH. Total bilirubin levels rarely exceed 3 mg/dL, and indirect bilirubin usually predominates over direct bilirubin [3]. The degree of cholestasis is related to the severity of both the elevation of right atrial pressure and tricuspid regurgitation [55, 83]. These data suggest that elevated right-sided filling pressures may contribute more to LFT elevation than reduced cardiac output [2]. The mechanism of cholestasis in this setting is thought to be due to the compression of the bile canaliculi and small ductules by centrally congested sinusoids [25]. Other laboratory findings include mild elevations of serum aminotransferases to two to three times the upper limit of normal and mild hypoalbuminemia. The latter may also be secondary to malnutrition or protein-losing enteropathy [8]. As liver disease progresses, liver function tests (i.e., bilirubin, INR, and albumin) may continue to worsen. Importantly, liver enzymes are often normal, and in the presence of other findings suggestive of CH, this diagnosis cannot be ruled out based on these normal values [3]. As already discussed, CH predisposes the liver to ACLI in the face of hemodynamic instability, instigating the aforementioned marked elevation of liver enzymes [8].\n\n4.3.2 Imaging tests\n\nImaging tests help both to support the diagnosis of CH and to identify complications. Characteristic conventional imaging findings include dilation of inferior vena cava and hepatic veins, loss of normal triphasic hepatic venous wave-form, and abnormal kinetics of intravenous contrast enhancement (e.g., delayed bolus arrival to the liver suggesting slow systemic circulation, diffusion of extracellular contrast media into the periportal lymphatic space in the delayed phase, retrograde hepatic venous opacification during the early phase of intravenous contrast material injection into the upper extremities, and a predominantly peripheral heterogeneous pattern of hepatic enhancement due to stagnant blood flow) [84] (Figure 3A, B). Importantly, the appearance of a nodular or heterogeneous liver on standard imaging is not sufficient to diagnosis cirrhosis in CH [51].\n\nCH may lead to the generation of benign regenerative nodules or focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH)-like lesions and hepatocarcinoma. The former is referred to as “FNH-like” despite having characteristic pathological findings of FNH due to the presence of abnormal background liver parenchyma. Although they most commonly demonstrate typical imaging findings (i.e., well-circumscribed, homogeneous nodule with late arterial hyperenhancement that fades to isointensity/isoattenuation on delayed phase imaging), they sometimes have a washout appearance that could be mistaken for hepatocarcinoma due to abnormally increased background parenchymal enhancement in the delayed phase [84] (Figure 4). Indeed, distinguishing hepatocarcinoma from these atypical imaging represents an unmet need, and biopsy is frequently required for accurate diagnosis. Radiological findings that support the diagnosis of hepatocarcinoma include the following: significant change in appearance of a nodule, venous invasion, a heterogeneous-appearing mass, and elevated alpha-fetoprotein [51, 84]. There are currently no screening guidelines for hepatocarcinoma in CH. In post-Fontan patients, some experts recommend to begin screening at 15–20 years after the operation [51], while the newly released guidelines from the American Heart Association recommend a much more comprehensive surveillance (Table 1) [85]. In patients with CH due to other conditions, it seems reasonable to perform bi-annual screening once cardiac cirrhosis is established.\n\nBasic*In-Depth*Investigational*Childhood (every 3–4 years)\n\nCMP\n\nPlatelet count\n\nSerum GGT\n\nPT/INR\n\nSerum FibroSure biomarkers\n\nSerum α-fetoprotein\n\nAbdominal ultrasound\n\nTotal serum cholesterol\n\nLiver imaging via CT or MRI\n\nLiver elastography (ultrasound or MRI)\n\nLiver biopsy\n\nAdolescence (every 1–3 years)\n\nCMP\n\nPlatelet count\n\nSerum GGT\n\nPT/INR\n\nSerum FibroSure biomarkers\n\nSerum α-fetoprotein\n\nAbdominal ultrasound\n\nTotal serum cholesterol\n\nLiver imaging via CT or MRI\n\nLiver elastography (ultrasound or MRI)\n\nLiver biopsy\n\nAdulthood (every 1–2 years)\n\nCMP\n\nPlatelet count\n\nSerum GGT\n\nPT/INR\n\nTotal serum cholesterol\n\nAbdominal ultrasound\n\nSerum FibroSure biomarkers\n\nSerum α-fetoprotein\n\nLiver imaging via CT or MRI\n\nLiver elastography (ultrasound or MRI)\n\nLiver biopsy\n\n4.3.3 Histology\n\nThe congestive liver explant has been characterized as a “nutmeg liver” due to the presence of dark centrilobular zones that reflect sinusoidal congestion alternating with pale periportal zones with normal or fatty liver tissue [84] (Figure 5A). Characteristic histological findings include sinusoidal dilatation and congestion, hepatocyte atrophy most prominent in zone 3, extravasation of red blood cells into the space of Disse, regenerative hyperplasia emerging from periportal regions, and centrilobular fibrosis (Figure 5B, C) [25]. The degree of sinusoidal dilatation is positively correlated with the degree of elevation of right atrial pressure. As liver disease progresses, bridging fibrosis typically extends between central veins to produce a pattern that has been name “reversed lobulation” since it contrasts to the typical fibrosis pattern found in most primary liver diseases where bridging fibrosis occurs between portal triads (i.e., zone 1) [3]. As far as the correlation between fibrosis extension and systemic hemodynamic parameters is concerned, there are discordant results with most studies finding no correlation [50, 54, 86, 87, 88, 89].\n\nIt must be highlighted that the distribution of fibrosis throughout the liver is extremely heterogeneous in patients with CH [86, 90], and it may be explained by the fibrogenic effects of intrahepatic thrombosis caused by static blood flow [61]. This variability raises concern about sampling error and about the role of liver biopsy as the gold standard tool for fibrosis assessment. Moreover, liver biopsies may not predict post-heart transplant outcomes. In a retrospective study, Louie et al. found that the presence of bridging fibrosis was not significantly associated with post-operative survival or post-operative liver failure, based on which they concluded that patients with bridging fibrosis may still be considered viable candidates for isolated heart transplantation [90]. Similar results were described by Dhall et al. [86]. Regardless of these limitations, liver biopsy still plays an important role in the assessment of the stage of liver disease, in ruling out hepatocarcinoma and alternative etiologies of liver disease and in determining candidacy for isolated heart transplantation or combined heart-liver transplantation. Its findings, however, should be correlated with the clinical presentation and results of other diagnostic tools [51, 86].\n\n4.3.4 Non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis\n\nNon-invasive diagnostic tests of liver fibrosis have been extensively studied and have excellent predictive value for advanced fibrosis in patients with viral hepatitis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [91]. Nevertheless, the performance of these tests in assessing the severity of fibrosis in CH is poor. A detail description of each of these tests in this setting is beyond the scope of this chapter and can be found elsewhere [51, 92, 93].\n\nBriefly, among serological markers, the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)-XI score has been suggested to be potentially useful as some studies have shown a moderate correlation with the stage of fibrosis in post-Fontan patients [94, 95]. This score excludes INR given the high prevalence of anticoagulation use in CH. Despite these results, further studies are needed as other studies have described opposite results [78, 90]. The remaining tests (i.e., standard serum markers, FibroSure testing, hyaluronic acid levels, and most clinical risk calculators) are inaccurate at staging liver fibrosis [51]. The use of liver stiffness tools is hampered by the fact that congestion increases liver stiffness values [91]. Hence, in CH, it provides unreliable information regarding the grade of fibrosis, although some evidence suggests that liver and spleen stiffness calculated by magnetic resonance elastography may be more accurate. Finally, new advances in imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion-weighted imaging, may potentially differentiate fibrosis from congestion but require validation [51].\n\n4.3.5 Hepatic hemodynamic study\n\nHepatic vein catheterization with measurement of the HVPG is currently the gold standard technique for determining portal pressure. It represents the difference between the wedged hepatic venous pressure (WHVP) and the free hepatic venous pressure (FHVP). The WHVP is usually measured by occluding the right hepatic vein through the inflation of a balloon, whereas the FHVP is measured without occluding it. The occlusion of the vein forms a continuous static column of blood between the catheter and the hepatic sinusoids. Thus, WHVP measures sinusoidal pressure. Due to the scarce connections between sinusoids existing in cirrhosis, pressure cannot be decompressed through the sinusoidal network, and therefore, WHVP reflects portal pressure in this setting. FHVP, on the other hand, is a surrogate for inferior vena cava pressure. Normal values of HVPG are <5 mmHg. The HVPG is a strong and independent predictor of outcomes in compensated and decompensated cirrhosis due to primary liver diseases [96, 97, 98].\n\nThe diagnostic and prognostic value of HVPG measurement in CH has not been adequately assessed. In this context, both FHVP and WHPV are elevated, and the HVPG is within the normal range (Figure 6). Once cardiac cirrhosis is established, the HVPG is expected to increase beyond 6 mmHg (Figure 7) [51]. Hence, HVPG could theoretically provide relevant information about the stage of CH. The few clinical studies that have provided hemodynamic data in this regard have described inconsistent results. For instance, in the study of Myers et al., esophageal varices were seen in some patients despite having a HVPG below 6 mmHg. As previously explained, the high pressures along the entire path of venous return to the right atrium prevent the formation of varices unless the establishment of cirrhosis creates a pressure gradient between the portal and systemic circulation. In order to explain these discordant results, the same authors argued that it was possible that the varices observed in a few patients represented either false-positive endoscopies or undetected concomitant disease such as portal vein thrombosis [50]. Moreover, it has not yet been demonstrated that the HVPG correlates with the stage of fibrosis in CH [50, 86]. These findings probably respond to several confounders: the inclusion of few patients with advanced fibrosis, the variable distribution of fibrosis throughout the liver, and the absence of a full and reliable characterization of the liver disease. As far as its prognostic utility is concerned, no study has evaluated the HVPG for predicting hepatic decompensation events and survival after isolated heart transplantation [51]. Despite this, many academic centers, including our own, measure the HVPG to assist in the transplant decision-making process. Finally, it must be reminded that the hepatic vein catheterization also allows performing a transjugular liver biopsy. This technique is safer than the percutaneous biopsy and can be performed even under anticoagulation or ascites [99]."
