In the 21st minute, Quakes midfielder Fatai Alashe played the ball off his chest and ripped a volley from 25 yards out, forcing keeper Tyler Deric to make an uncomfortable save and knock the ball out for a corner kick. In the 32nd minute, San Jose was awarded an indirect free kick inside the penalty area. Defender Victor Bernardez received a quick pass and blasted a shot that beat the keeper, but smacked the woodwork, causing a scramble in front of net. The loose ball was eventually cleared to safety.

The fourth-consecutive sellout at Stanford was also the largest crowd in the history of the California Clasico. San Jose improved to 4-1-4 in their last nine matches and 4-1-2 overall at home this season. San Jose nearly opened the scoring in the first minute of the match. Midfielder Matias Perez Garcia whipped in a corner kick and the ball found its way inside the six-yard box. Forward Chris Wondolowski was one of several Quakes around the ball and attempted to volley it past Galaxy keeper Jaime Penedo, but his shot was blocked by a last-ditch effort by the goalkeeper. The Galaxy took a 1-0 lead on the right foot of Juninho in the 19th minute. A loose ball rolled out to Juninho about 30 yards from goal and he ripped a one-timed shot that dipped towards the bottom-left corner of the net. Quakes keeper David Bingham lunged to his left, but couldnât get enough on it to keep it out. San Jose leveled the score line in the 28th minute. Perez Garcia held the ball near the edge of the penalty area and lost his defender with some nifty footwork. After creating space for himself, Perez Garcia played a ball across the box about waist high and Wondolowski volleyed a rocket past Penedo. It marked Wondolowskiâs Western Conference-leading ninth goal of the season and Perez Garciaâs fifth assist. The Quakes took the lead in the 53rd minute. Perez Garcia drove an in-swinging corner kick into the box and defender Clarence Goodson beat his man to the near post and headed it into the back of the net. It marked Goodsonâs first MLS goal since August 11, 2007 and his first as a member of the Earthquakes. It also marked Perez Garciaâs second assist of the match. San Jose doubled their advantage in 72nd minute. Second-half substitute midfielder Cordell Cato received a pass from midfielder Shea Salinas in the penalty area and proceeded to dribble around multiple defenders before driving a low left-footed strike past Penedo. It marked Catoâs first goal of the year and first since September 7, 2014\n\nHistory of Quakes â LA Galaxy Rivalry\n\nAs the two original MLS teams in California, the Earthquakes (then known as the Clash) and the Galaxy met for the first time on April 28, 1996, at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. â¦ In front of a crowd of 40,347, the Clash fell to the Galaxy, 2-1 â¦ From 1996-2005, the in-state rivals matched up more than any other teams in the league â¦ Along with playing each other 58 times in the regular season, the Quakes and the Galaxy have also faced off 10 times in the postseason and five times in the Lamar Hunt US Open Cup â¦ The teams squared off in the playoffs in 1996, 2003 and 2005, as well as the 2001 MLS Cup â¦ The Galaxy captured the 1996 conference semifinal series, two games to one, taking the final two contests at the Rose Bowl by identical scores of 2-0 â¦ In 2001, the sides met in the MLS Cup, with the Quakes producing a come-from-behind 2-1 triumph at Columbus Crew Stadium as Dwayne De Rosario scored the winner in overtime â¦ The 2003 Western Conference Semifinal series produced one of the most memorable games in league history â¦ After dropping the road leg of a two-game set, 2-0, San Jose fell behind by that same score after just 13 minutes of the home return to trail the series, 4-0 on aggregate â¦ The Quakes responded with a four-goal explosion in regulation to level the aggregate, 4-4, getting the fourth from Chris RonÃ©r in the 90th minute just moments after he had come into the game â¦ Fellow second-half substitute Rodrigo Faria then struck six minutes into sudden-death overtime to send San Jose to the Western Conference Finals, and ultimately its second MLS Cup â¦ In 2005, having lost the first leg of the Western Conference Semifinals, 3-1, at The Home Depot Center, the Quakes needed another two-goal comeback to win the series â¦ After going up 1-0 on a Brian Ching goal in Game 2 on Oct. 29, 2005, Ned Grabavoy scored for the Galaxy to end the Quakesâ hopes â¦ That match marked the Quakesâ final game before the team was relocated to Houston on Dec. 15, 2005 â¦ Since the Earthquakes rejoined MLS in 2008, the teams have met 11 times â¦ San Jose has gone 4-4-3 during that stretch, including a 1-0 win in front of what was then a stadium-record crowd of 10,799 at Buck Shaw Stadium on Aug. 21, 2010, thanks to a fourth-minute goal by Chris Wondolowski â¦ The sides played to a scoreless draw in front of a new Buck Shaw record crowd of 10,872 in last yearâs first meeting on June 25, with the Quakes unable to find a goal despite out-shooting the Galaxy, 25-8, and playing with a man advantage for 47 minutes â¦ The return fixture in Carson resulted in a 2-0 victory for LA as Robbie Keane scored the winner on his MLS debut â¦ The Earthquakes were 2-0-1 against the Galaxy in 2012, rallying from two-goal deficits to knock off their Southern California rival on May 23, 3-2, at The Home Depot Center and June 30, 4-3, in front of 50,391 at Stanford Stadium â¦ San Jose again came from behind in their final regular season meeting of 2012, equalizing a pair of one-goal deficits for a 2-2 draw at Buck Shaw Stadium â¦ After defeating the Galaxy 1-0 in the first leg of Western Conference Semifinals, the Quakes dropped the second match at Buck Shaw Stadium 3-1 and were eliminated from the postseason â¦ The 2013 California Clasico got off to a lively start as the Earthquakes rallied from a 2-1 deficit while playing a man down with goals from Shea Salinas and Alan Gordon in second-half stoppage time, making San Jose the first team in league history to accomplish that feat â¦ The Galaxy won the two teamsâ next meeting in 2013 with a 3-0 rout on Aug. 31 at the StubHub Center thanks to a goal from Landon Donovan and a brace by Robbie Keane â¦ The Earthquakes dropped a 1-0 decision to the Galaxy in their first meeting of 2014, a match that drew a sold-out crowd of 50,006 â¦ Newly signed designated player Matias Perez Garcia and U.S. National Team forward Chris Wondolowski both scored in the first half to help the Earthquakes earn a valuable road point with a 2-2 draw against the LA Galaxy at the StubHub Center â¦ In their third meeting of 2014, the Earthquakes tied the LA Galaxy 1-1 at Buck Shaw Stadium on September 14, thanks to a second half goal from Quakes forward Chris Wondolowski â¦ In their first regular season meeting of 2015, the San Jose Earthquakes defeated the LA Galaxy 3-1 in the California Clasico at Stanford Stadium in front of a sellout crowd of 50,422 â¦ The Quakes fell to the Galaxy 1-0 in the Round of 16 in the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup at Avaya Stadium on July 1, 2015.\n\nEarthquakes-LA Galaxy Connections\n\nGalaxy

The club has allowed more than one goal just once in those nine matches and has kept four clean sheets.\n\nMidfield Magician\n\nQuakes midfielder Matias Perez Garcia has registered six assists in his last eight MLS matches and San Jose has only lost once in those eight contests (4-1-3). In the process, he has boosted his game-winning assist total to four, tied for the most in Major League Soccer. The club is also 4â0 this year when MPG records an assist or scores [at HOU (5/5); vs. CLB (5/16); at SEA (6/20); vs. LA (6/27)].\n\nStrong Form\n\nWhile San Jose is currently sitting in seventh place in the Western Conference, numerous factors suggest they have been better than the table indicates. The Earthquakes have played fewer matches than all but one team currently ahead of them in the WC playoff race, including having multiple games in hand on four of the six clubs theyâre chasing. San Jose has also played 10 of their 18 matches thus far on the road.\n\nTough to Break Down at Avaya\n\nThe Quakes have only allowed two goals in the last four MLS matches at Avaya Stadium [vs. VAN (4/11); vs. CLB (5/16); vs. DAL (6/7); vs. HOU (7/10)].\n\nStingy Defense\n\nThe San Jose Earthquakes have held their opponents to one or fewer goals in 13 of their 18 matches this season, including nine of the last 11. They have also kept clean sheets in four of the past 10 games.\n\nQuakes Among MLS Leaders\n\nCurrently, several Earthquakes rank near or at the top of numerous statistical categories. Among them are:\n\nâ¢\n\nMatias Perez Garcia â 4 game-winning assists (t-1st in MLS)\n\nâ¢\n\nMatias Perez Garcia â 6 assists (t-5th in MLS)\n\nâ¢\n\nMatias Perez Garcia â 75 corner kicks (2nd in MLS)\n\nâ¢\n\nMatias Perez Garcia â 49 fouls suffered (2nd in MLS)\n\nâ¢\n\nDavid Bingham â 65 saves (2nd in MLS)\n\nâ¢\n\nDavid Bingham â 75.6 save pct. (6th in MLS)\n\nâ¢\n\nDavid Bingham â 5 shutouts (t-8th in MLS)\n\nâ¢\n\nChris Wondolowski â 9 goals (t-4th in MLS)\n\nâ¢\n\nChris Wondolowski â 50 shots (t-6th in MLS)\n\nGreatest Six-Year Span in MLS History\n\nIncluding nine goals so far this year, Chris Wondolowski has tallied 95 goals since the start of the 2010 season, the most by any player over a six-year span in MLS history. Wondolowski still has the remainder of this season to add to his league record. Only three other players ever registered more than 80 goals in a six-year span â Taylor Twellman (91 from 2002-07), Roy Lassiter (88 from 1996-01) and Carlos Ruiz (81 from 2002-07).\n\nMLS Goals Since 2010\n\nChris Wondolowski has been by far the leagueâs most efficient striker since 2010, leading the league in goals during that time span:\n\n1.
