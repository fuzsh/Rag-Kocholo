In honor of Hispanics’ contributions to the agency’s global mission, DLA Energy Public Affairs is highlighting Hispanic Americans who work daily to provide logistics support to America’s Warfighters.\n\nMy name is: Raul Garcia\n\nI am: A customer account specialist at DLA Energy Americas East.\n\nDescribe your job in a sentence: My job entails helping the Warfighter obtain fuel for their missions in a timely manner. This is the best job I’ve ever had.\n\nHow long have you worked at DLA Energy? I have been working at DLA Energy for nearly eight years.\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about working for DLA? My favorite thing is being part of an organization with such a large footprint making positive, impactful contributions for our Warfighters.\n\nWhat are your best memories of working here? My best memory is being part of the humanitarian effort supporting Puerto Rico during the 2017 Hurricane Season. I’m originally from Puerto Rico and currently have family there. Being part of the FEMA/DLA Mission to assist my family, friends and community made it that much more satisfying.\n\nWhat is one thing you'd like others to know about your heritage? Hispanics have made remarkable contributions in building and defending this nation. As of September 2018, 136,000 Hispanic Soldiers serve in the U.S. Army, composing 13.8% of its force."
