        "text": "—\n\nToday, Earthjustice announced Raúl García as Vice President of Policy and Legislation. García previously held the role as Legislative Director for Healthy Communities where he led the organization’s policy work on federal safeguards for clean air, clean water, and against toxics exposure. He steps into the role as longtime Vice President Marty Hayden transitions to a senior policy advisor role after 25 years of extraordinary leadership within Earthjustice and the wider environmental movement.\n\n“Raúl is a respected leader known for his dedication to centering the voices of communities in our policy work,” said Earthjustice President Abigail Dillen. “He has brought his coalition-building skills, creativity, and passion to safeguarding and strengthening the National Environmental Policy Act to managing a broad portfolio of issues concerning toxins, pollution, and permitting, and I am thrilled for all that he will do across the environmental movement to protect people and combat the climate crisis. I am equally thrilled that Marty Hayden will continue to lend his leadership and expertise to the organization and am grateful for both his work and the legacy he leaves.”\n\n“I have seen Raúl in action since he first started at Earthjustice and could not think of a better person to fill this role,” said Marty Hayden, outgoing Vice President of Policy and Legislation. “Since joining Earthjustice, Raúl has played a critical role in elevating the voices of frontline communities into our advocacy work across numerous issues. He’s a trusted partner to environmental justice communities and social justice groups, a passionate, creative, and skilled advocate, and he will help us meet this moment on climate change and environmental justice. I look forward to working with him in this new capacity and continuing to serve at Earthjustice.”\n\nGarcía brings 11 years of experience advocating for environmental and social justice causes. Prior to assuming the role of Vice President of Policy and Legislation, he served as the Legislative Director for Healthy Communities where he worked on Earthjustice’s advocacy strategies to defend and improve federal safeguards for clean air, clean water, and against toxics exposure. He also served as a Senior Legislative Counsel in the PAL department and focused on protecting the National Environmental Policy Act, as well as advancing environmental, health, and safety protections in infrastructure development."
