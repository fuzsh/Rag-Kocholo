This Navarrese striker has been a pillar for each of these clubs, showing a level of professionalism and dedication that has been key to many of his teams' successes.\n\nSince its inception in Osasuna, going through a golden period in the Atletico Madrid, until its consolidation as a reference in the Athletic Club de Bilbao, Raúl has proven to be more than a player; He has been a strategist on the field and a mentor off it. His ability to adapt to different styles of play and his consistency in performance are testament to his quality and discipline, qualities that have allowed him to remain at the top of Spanish football for two decades.\n\nValverde, current coach of Athletic Club de Bilbao, has highlighted the importance of the forward in the team. «It is difficult not to be amazed by the numbers that Raúl has, not only in Athletic but in his entire sporting career. He has been fundamental in each of the three teams in which he has been. For us, one of the clear references of the squad for his way of doing things, his professionalism, drive and for what he brings to us,\" he said. Valverde. This admiration is no coincidence, it is the result of years of constant effort and dedication.\n\nDespite having played less this year, Raúl García continues to be an example of professionalism and resilience. The decision to retire has not been easy, but it is understandable considering the physical and mental exhaustion that being at the highest level in football entails. «There is also a time to think that life continues in another way. For us it has been a privilege to have him\"Valverde added.\n\nImpact Raúl García in Spanish football goes beyond his sporting achievements. He has been a role model for new generations, showing that true success is based as much on talent as it is on attitude and hard work. His legacy will be remembered not only for the goals and victories, but also for his ability to inspire and lead on and off the field."
