        "text": "On an emotionally charged afternoon at San Mamés, Raúl García received an ovation that will resonate in his memory forever, just after announcing that this season will be the last in his soccer career. This gesture from the public not only recognizes his sporting achievements, but also the special bond that he has cultivated with the fans and the city of Bilbao.\n\nA career full of success and loyalty. Since his debut, Raúl García has been synonymous with commitment and passion for football. With a total of 602 matches in La Liga, he ranks as the third player with the most matches in the history of the championship, a statistic that speaks volumes about his consistency and resistance on the field of play. His spells at Osasuna, Atlético de Madrid and, finally, at Athletic Club, have not only been prolific in terms of quantity, but also in quality and leadership.\n\nGarcía's impact on Athletic. In nine seasons wearing the red and white shirt, Raúl has participated in 356 games, leaving an indelible mark on the club and its fans. His ability to define matches and his dedication on the field have made him one of the pillars of the team, being an essential part of achievements such as the League, two Copas del Rey, two Europa Leagues and two Spanish and European Super Cups.\n\nA goodbye full of gratitude. In his own words, Raúl expressed: «Thank you to all of San Mamés for the expressions of affection. There are only a few days left like today, but the goal is to enjoy them as much as I have every time I have worn this shirt. \"We still have challenges ahead.\" This message not only reflects his gratitude, but also his desire to close his career, leaving Athletic in the best possible position.\n\nRaúl García's career. Beyond the trophies and records, Raúl leaves a legacy of professionalism, dedication and a unique ability to connect with the fans. His figure has transcended numbers to become a symbol of the club's identity and values.\n\nIn short, Raúl García's farewell is not only the end of an era for him as a player, but also a moment of reflection for the club on how to replace a footballer of his caliber. San Mamés will lose one of its contemporary heroes, but Raúl's spirit will remain in every corner of the stadium and in every game that Athletic plays in the future. His career will be remembered not only for the goals and victories, but for the respect, passion and commitment that he showed every time he put on the Athletic Club shirt."
