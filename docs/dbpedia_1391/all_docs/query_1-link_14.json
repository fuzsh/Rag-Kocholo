        "text": "Raúl A. García-Rosario was born and raised in Carolina, Puerto Rico. In 2020, he graduated with a B.Sc in Cellular-Molecular Biology from the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras. During his undergraduate career, he developed an interest in neuroscience research and decided to pursue an MD-PhD. From 2020 to 2022, Raul was a Postbaccalaureate IRTA Research Fellow at the National Institute on Aging in the Laboratory of Behavioral Neuroscience (Neurocognitive Aging Section), where he studied the neuroadaptations underlying memory resilience in aging. His clinical experience identified the immediate need for the translation of basic research findings into therapeutics. That is why, as a physician-scientist, Raul hopes to accelerate this translation by conducting research with a more direct emphasis on patients’ needs.\n\nRaul's research experiences/interests include neuroregeneration, neurodegenerative diseases, neurocognitive aging, learning, memory, cognition, and behavioral neuroscience."
