        "text": "\"I didn't grow up as an Athleticzale, but I am one now.\"\n\nThe extraordinary words of Athletic Club legend Raúl García during his final press conference as a Lion.\n\nFlanked by José Angel Iribar and Athletic president Jon Uriarte, the forward spoke about his career and how his affection for the Zurigorri has grown during his time in Bilbao.\n\n\"I've experienced things here that people would always tell me about and I've enjoyed it so much,\" García said. \"In my own way, I've always fought with that spirit and sense of pride that all of us Athleticzales have.\"\n\nRaúl will have receive a San Mames tribute on Saturday as Athletic host CA Osasuna, a clash which features the first and last club of a long and successful playing career of more than 800 matches.\n\nHe said: \"You look back and it makes you feel dizzy with all that you have experienced. I feel very proud not so much about the quantity, but about how I've done it. I don't go crazy about the numbers, they just confirm that I've done things right.\"\n\nWith 605 LaLiga matches under his belt so far, Raúl is the third-highest appearance maker in the competition's history. He had some special words of thanks for Osasuna and Atlético Madrid, the other two clubs which have formed part of his career.\n\n\"After looking back at the journey I've been on, the only thing I can do is say thank you,\" he added.\n\n\"I want to start with Osasuna, the club I was born with. I've always had and will always have that ‘Rojillo’ spirit. I have to thank all the teammates and people I worked with there as well as the fans because the way they've treated me has always been spectacular.\n\n\"Obviously the same in Madrid. I made the decision to go there when I was very young. I'm thankful for everything I experienced at Atlético, because even in the bad times it was a club where I learnt a lot and they have shown me a lot of affection.\"\n\nThe no.22 showed his appreciation for his parents, insisting that \"what he's done and how he's done it\" is down to his upbringing at home. He also thanked his wife and kids for their constant support.\n\n\"What can I say about my family? My parents are here. I can't do a press conference without linking it to the values they've passed down to me: hard work and perseverance. They taught me that obstacles along the path are just lessons that make us stronger. So, I have to thank them as well.\n\n\"As for my other family, my wife and children. Even if I sometimes tell you off, you know I love you very much. You're the light that makes us move. In the most complicated moments you're always there to bring a smile to my face. I know that achieving what I've achieved would have been very difficult if you weren't here.\"\n\nGarcía admitted he's had no second thoughts about his decision, saying he's made this choice to give back to those who have long put his needs before their own.\n\n\"If there's one thing I've tried to do in my life, it's to be coherent and make the right decisions at all times,\" he said\n\n\"I have made mistakes on many occasions and I will continue to do so. This choice didn't depend on winning or not winning the Copa because it was something I had already decided.\n\n\"I'm lucky that physically I feel very well. I could continue, but you have to listen to your head as well. I've spent my whole life putting my job before the people around me. So, now I must be sensible and start another journey in order to give them the time that they've given me.\n\n\"With time I'll figure out what I want to do, but now I see only positive things and I'm not afraid it will be something I don't like.\"\n\nHe also had a final message for his young teammates, advising them to avoid \"looking to leave a legacy\" but lto help improve each other as footballers and people.\n\nHe added: \"Work so that people absorb things that they can use. My routine has been to improve myself as much as I can and to help everyone around me. I hope that that hard work and perseverance has made an impact, as that would make me proud.\n\nJon Uriarte: \"He's a legend of football\"\n\nAthletic Club's president Jon Uriarte described Raúl as a \"great player\" and \"a legend of Spanish football\", congratulating the attacker on an incredible career.\n\nJon said: \"He's spent nine seasons with us, playing 358 games and scoring 83 goals. He's played 605 games in LaLiga, the third most in the competition. 814 in total, in which he has scored 148 goals, more than half of them with the Zurigorri shirt.\n\n\"He's left legacies at three different clubs: Osasuna, Atlético Madrid and us. That's really difficult considering the rivalry between those teams.\n\n\"He's managed to do that for many reasons, but I will highlight two. His competitive character, he doesn't like to lose anything and because he's a tireless worker. It's an incredible story, but unfortunately all stories come to an end.\n\n\"However, this one ends with a Supercopa and a Copa under his arm.\"\n\nIribar: \"He's a great example for all\"\n\nJosé Ángel Iribar praised García as an example for all \"on and off the pitch\", insisting that Raúl's character will have rubbed off on his team and \"will serve us well in the future because we're a team built to win\".\n\nThe footballer said Iribar's words were \"important\" to him and that he would \"treasure them forever\".\n\nHe continued: \"We have had the good fortune to share these last few years together. I really respect him and what can I tell you about Txopo that you don't already know. I always listen to everyone who talks to me because it's a way of learning.\n\n\"Obviously I do that in football in general, but when it comes to Athletic you have to keep quiet and listen to Angel when he speaks.\""
