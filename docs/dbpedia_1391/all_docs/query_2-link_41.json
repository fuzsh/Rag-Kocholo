        "text": "I am currently living in the south of Spain, working as freelance traditional/digital sculptor.\n\n​\n\nI started my profesional career in 90's when I was very young, as I loved to paint my models, I soon found myself creating and sculpting my own figures. I developed myself as traditional sculptor for almost 20 years now, working for most of the companies in the miniature figure industry.\n\nI recently moved to digital sculpting in 2015, as I realized digital is already a new standard in most of the industries. I am actually working in the collectibles statues industry. But I am really open to new fields.\n\n​\n\nI really don't like to look back my past, I am a more a \"looking forward\" artist focus on improving and doing new things.\n\nAlong I was lucky to found my own miniatures companies, Latorre Models, Enigma Miniatures and lately Mproyec, where I did what I really desired to do in that time.\n\n​\n\nThis is truly a new period, I am very excited to see what the future come up with."
