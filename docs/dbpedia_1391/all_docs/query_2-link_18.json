        "text": "Athletic Bilbao have completed the signing of Spain international Raul Garcia from Primera Division rivals Atletico Madrid. The 29-year-old midfielder, who played more than 200 matches for Atletico, passed his medical with the Basque club on Monday before putting pen to paper on a four-year contract.\n\nAthletic said in a statement: “Raul Garcia will be presented at 1700 (local time) on Monday, August 31 as a new player of Athletic Bilbao.\n\n“The player will be tied to the club until June 30, 2019 and his buy-out clause will be 40 million euros.”\n\nPamplona-born Garcia started his career with hometown club Osasuna before moving to Atletico in 2007. During his stay at the Vicente Calderon — which included a season back on loan at Osasuna — Garcia helped the Rojiblancos win the Primera Division, Copa del Rey, Europa League, UEFA Super Cup and Spanish Supercopa. He was also part of the Atletico side that reached the Champions League final last year, which they lost 4-1 to Real Madrid after extra time.\n\nSEE MORE: Up-to-the-minute transfer deadline deals.\n\nGarcia has won two caps for Spain, making his debut against France last year."
