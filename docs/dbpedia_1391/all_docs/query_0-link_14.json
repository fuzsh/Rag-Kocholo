Using household expenditure and emissions data, we document that low-income households have higher emissions per dollar spent than high-income households, making a carbon tax regressive. We build a model that captures this fact and study climate policies that are neutral with respect to the income distribution. A central feature of these policies is that resource transfers across consumers are ruled out. We show that the constrained optimal carbon tax in a heterogeneous economy is heterogeneous: Higher-income households face a higher rate. Our main result shows that when the planner is limited to a uniform carbon tax, the tax follows the Pigouvian rule but is lower than the unconstrained carbon tax. Finally, we embed this model into a standard incomplete markets framework to quantify the policy effects on the economy, climate and welfare, and we find a Pareto-improving result. The climate policy is welfare-improving for every consumer.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/gwp427\n\n2404\n\nWhen Is the Use of Gaussian-inverse Wishart-Haar Priors Appropriate?\n\nAtsushi Inoue and Lutz Kilian\n\nAbstract: Several recent studies have expressed concern that the Haar prior typically employed in estimating sign-identified VAR models is driving the prior about the structural impulse responses and hence their posterior. In this paper, we provide evidence that the quantitative importance of the Haar prior for posterior inference has been overstated. How sensitive posterior inference is to the Haar prior depends on the width of the identified set of a given impulse response. We demonstrate that this width depends not only on how much the identified set is narrowed by the identifying restrictions imposed on the model, but also depends on the data through the reduced-form model parameters. Hence, the role of the Haar prior can only be assessed on a case-by-case basis. We show by example that, when the identification is sufficiently tight, posterior inference based on a Gaussian-inverse Wishart-Haar prior provides a reasonably accurate approximation.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2404\n\n2403\n\nGeopolitical Oil Price Risk and Economic Fluctuations\n\nLutz Kilian, Michael D. Plante and Alexander W. Richter\n\nAbstract: This paper seeks to understand the general equilibrium effects of time-varying geopolitical risk in oil markets. Answering this question requires simultaneously modeling several features including macroeconomic disasters and geopolitically driven oil production disasters, oil storage and precautionary savings, and the endogenous determination of uncertainty about output and the price of oil. We find that oil price uncertainty tends to be driven by macroeconomic uncertainty. Shifts in the probability of a geopolitically driven major oil supply disruption have meaningful effects on the price of oil and the macro economy, but the resulting oil price uncertainty is not a major driver of fluctuations in macroeconomic aggregates.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2403\n\nGlobalization Institute No. 426\n\nTime-varying Persistence of House Price Growth: The Role of Expectations and Credit Supply\n\nChi-Young Choi, Alexander Chudik and Aaron Smallwood\n\nAbstract: High persistence is a prominent feature of price movements in U.S. housing markets, i.e., house prices grow faster this period if they grew faster last period. This paper provides two additional new insights to the literature on U.S. house price movements. First, there exists a significant time variation in the persistence of house price growth, both at the national and city level. Second, there is considerable heterogeneity in the time-varying persistence across different regions, particularly in areas that were historically less persistent, such as the capital-poor regions in the Midwest and South. This study conducts additional regression analyses to determine the main factor behind the time-varying persistence, with a particular focus on two housing demand factors: extrapolative expectations and credit supply expansion. Our results suggest that the time variation in the persistence of urban house price growth is better aligned with credit supply expansion than with extrapolative expectations. These findings remain robust even when accounting for potential endogeneity and reverse causality concerns.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/gwp426\n\n2402\n\nTexas Manufacturing Outlook Survey: Survey Methodology, Performance and Forecast Accuracy\n\nJesus Cañas, Aparna Jayashankar, Emily Kerr and Diego Morales-Burnett\n\nAbstract: The Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey (TMOS) is a monthly survey of area manufacturers conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. TMOS indexes provide timely information on manufacturing activity in Texas, which is useful for understanding broader changes in regional economic conditions. This paper describes the survey methodology and analyzes the explanatory and predictive power of TMOS indexes with regard to other measures of state economic activity. Regression analysis shows that several TMOS indexes successfully track changes in Texas employment, gross domestic product and consumer price index. Forecasting exercises show that several TMOS indexes are also useful in predicting future changes in some of these regional economic indicators.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2402\n\n2401\n\nThe Impact of the 2022 Oil Embargo and Price Cap on Russian Oil Prices\n\nLutz Kilian, David Rapson and Burkhard Schipper\n\nAbstract: This paper documents the effect of the oil embargo and price cap on Russian oil exports in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. We show that the embargo forced Russia to accept a $32/bbl discount on its Urals crude in March 2023 relative to January 2022, nearly half of which is directly attributable to the higher cost of shipping crude oil over longer distances, as Russia diverted much of its crude oil exports to India. Based on a calibrated model of global oil supply and demand, the remainder ($17/bbl) can be explained by increased Indian bargaining power. We also provide a similar analysis for the ESPO price discount on exports to China. In contrast, the price cap deprived Russia of the financial resources it spent on assembling a “shadow” fleet of tankers, but its effect on the Russian oil export price was negligible once the adoption of the price cap had facilitated the use of Western services to transport Russian oil to Asia.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2401\n\n2023\n\n2316\n\nA Narrative Analysis of Federal Appropriations for Research and Development\n\nAndrew J. Fieldhouse and Karel Mertens\n\nAbstract: This paper provides a narrative analysis of postwar federal appropriations for the research and development (R&D) activities of the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation—five agencies that consistently account for the vast majority of federal outlays for all types of R&D. We build a novel dataset quantifying the enacted full-year appropriations for all budgetary accounts funding R&D activities at these five agencies over fiscal years 1947-2019. We use this dataset to isolate a subset of 218 “significant” changes in real appropriations for each agency, and we analyze numerous primary and secondary sources to understand the context and motivation. Based on these sources, we classify each significant change in federal R&D appropriations as either “endogenous” or “exogenous” to short-run macroeconomic developments. The exogenous changes in R&D appropriations are intended as instrumental variables for studying the causal effects of government R&D in appropriately specified empirical models.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2316\n\nGlobalization Institute No. 425\n\nDollar Shortages, CIP Deviations and the Safe Haven Role of the Dollar\n\nAppendix\n\nPhilippe Bacchetta, J. Scott Davis and Eric van Wincoop\n\nAbstract: Since 2007, an increase in risk or risk aversion has resulted in a U.S. dollar appreciation and greater deviations from covered interest parity (CIP). In contrast, prior to 2007, risk had no impact on the dollar, and CIP held. To explain these phenomena, we develop a two-country model featuring (i) market segmentation, (ii) limited CIP arbitrage (since 2007) and (iii) global dollar dominance. During periods of heightened global financial stress, dollar shortages in the offshore market emerge, leading to increased CIP deviations and a dollar appreciation. The appreciation occurs even in the absence of global dollar demand shocks. Central bank swap lines mitigate these effects.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/gwp425\n\nAppendix DOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/gwp425app\n\n2315\n\nDeposit Convexity, Monetary Policy and Financial Stability\n\nChart data\n\nEmily Greenwald, Sam Schulhofer-Wohl and Joshua Younger\n\nAbstract: In principle, bank deposits can be withdrawn on demand. In practice, depositors tend to maintain stable balances for long periods, allowing banks to fund long-dated assets. Nevertheless, the cost of deposit funding influences banks’ capacity for maturity transformation. Banks and researchers conventionally model the response of deposit interest rates to market interest rates as constant, implying that deposits have nearly constant duration. Contrary to this standard assumption, we show empirically that the “beta” of deposit rates to market rates increases as market rates rise, causing the duration of deposits to fall. The amount of duration risk delivered to bank balance sheets via this channel from March 2022 to September 2023 is comparable in magnitude to the amount of duration risk absorbed by each of the several large-scale asset purchase programs the Federal Reserve has undertaken since 2008. Dynamic betas present a significant challenge to bank portfolio hedgers by introducing large and dynamic risks that are difficult to model and impractical to replicate on the asset side of the balance sheet. As a result, deposit convexity amplifies monetary policy transmission and increases financial fragility, mechanisms that recent banking stresses have highlighted.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2315\n\nGlobalization Institute No. 424\n\nLiving Up to Expectations: Central Bank Credibility, the Effectiveness of Forward Guidance and Inflation Dynamics Post-Global Financial Crisis\n\nStephen J. Cole, Enrique Martínez García and Eric Sims\n\nAbstract: This paper studies the effectiveness of forward guidance when central banks have imperfect credibility. Exploiting unique survey-based measures of expected inflation, output growth and interest rates, we estimate a small-scale New Keynesian model for the United States and other G7 countries plus Spain allowing for deviations from full information rational expectations. In our model, the key parameter that aggregates heterogeneous expectations captures the central bank's credibility and affects the overall effectiveness of forward guidance. We find that the central banks of the U.S., the U.K., Germany and other major advanced economies have similar levels of credibility (albeit far from full credibility); however, Japan's central bank credibility is much lower. For each country, our measure of credibility has declined over time, making forward guidance less effective. In a counterfactual analysis, we document that inflation would have been significantly higher, and the zero lower bound on short-term interest rates much less of an issue, in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis had the public perceived central bank forward guidance statements to be perfectly credible. Moreover, inflation would have declined more, and somewhat faster, with perfect credibility in the wake of the inflation surge post-COVID-19.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/gwp424\n\n2314\n\nInvesting in the Batteries and Vehicles of the Future: A View Through the Stock Market (Revised March 2024)\n\nMichael Plante\n\nAbstract: A large number of companies operating in the EV and battery supply chain have listed on a U.S. stock exchange in recent years. I compile a unique data set of high-frequency stock returns for those companies and investigate the extent to which an “industry” factor specific to the EV and battery supply chain (an “EV” factor) can explain their returns. Those returns are decomposed into systematic and idiosyncratic components, with the former given by a set of latent factors extracted from a large panel of stock returns using high-frequency principal components. It is found that a market factor and a factor associated with tech stocks have good explanatory power for the stocks of interest. I identify an “EV” factor as the first principal component of the idiosyncratic returns and find it has relatively good explanatory power for EV and battery stocks, often exceeding that of the tech factor. There is also evidence for a lithium factor that plays an important role in the returns of lithium companies.\n\nOriginal paper\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2314r1\n\nGlobalization Institute No. 423\n\nMean Group Distributed Lag Estimation of Impulse Response Functions in Large Panels (Revised May 2024)\n\nChi-Young Choi and Alexander Chudik\n\nAbstract: This paper develops Mean Group Distributed Lag (MGDL) estimation of impulse responses of common shocks in large panels with one or two cross-section dimensions. We derive sufficient conditions for asymptotic normality, and document satisfactory small sample performance using Monte Carlo experiments. Three empirical illustrations showcase the usefulness of MGDL estimators: crude oil price pass-through to U.S. city- and product-level retail prices; retail price effects of U.S. monetary policy shocks; and house price effects of U.S. monetary policy shocks.\n\nOriginal paper\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/gwp423r1\n\n2313\n\nMarriage and Work Among Prime-Age Men\n\nAdam Blandin, John Bailey Jones and Fang Yang\n\nAbstract: Married men work substantially more hours than men who have never been married, even after controlling for observables. Panel data reveal that much of this gap is attributable to an increase in work in the years leading up to marriage. Two potential explanations for this increase are: (i) men hit by positive labor market shocks are more likely to marry; and (ii) the prospect of marriage increases men’s labor supply. We quantify the relative importance of these two channels using a structural life-cycle model of marriage and labor supply. Our calibration implies that marriage substantially increases male labor supply. Counterfactual simulations suggest that if men were unable to marry, prime-age male work hours would fall by 7%, and if marriage rates fell to the extent observed, men born around 1980 would work 2% fewer hours than men born around 1960.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2313\n\n2312\n\nOil Price Shocks and Inflation\n\nLutz Kilian and Xiaoqing Zhou\n\nAbstract: Despite growing interest in the impact of oil and other energy price shocks on inflation and inflation expectations, until recently this question has not received much attention. This survey not only presents empirical results for the U.S. economy, but expands the analysis to include other major economies. We find that only in the euro area and in the U.K. energy price shocks are associated with a material increase in core consumer prices. This helps explain the somewhat more persistent response of headline inflation in these countries than in the U.S. or Canada. Inflation is even less sensitive to energy price shocks in Japan. We document that energy price shocks played a more important role in explaining headline inflation in the euro area in 2021 and 2022 than in the U.S. This does not mean that energy price shocks have de-anchored inflation expectations, however. While suitable data on long-run inflation expectations are scant, neither for the U.S. nor the U.K. is there evidence that energy price shocks have materially changed long-run inflation expectations.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2312\n\nGlobalization Institute No. 422\n\nA Theory of Capital Flow Retrenchment\n\nAppendix\n\nJ. Scott Davis and Eric van Wincoop\n\nAbstract: The empirical literature shows that gross capital inflows and outflows both decline following a negative global shock. However, to generate a positive co-movement between gross inflows and outflows, the theoretical literature relies on asymmetric shocks across countries. We present a model where there is heterogeneity across investors within countries, but there are no asymmetries across countries. We show that a negative global shock (rise in global risk-aversion) generates an identical drop in gross inflows and outflows. The within-country heterogeneity relates to the willingness of investors to hold risky assets and foreign assets.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/gwp422\n\nAppendix DOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/gwp422app\n\n2311\n\nHigh-Yield Debt Covenants and Their Real Effects\n\nFalk Bräuning, Victoria Ivashina and Ali Ozdagli\n\nAbstract: High-yield debt, including leveraged loans, features incurrence financial covenants or \"cov-lite\" provisions. These covenants differ from traditional loans' maintenance covenants, as they preserve equity control rights but impose specific restrictions on the borrower after crossing the covenant threshold. Contrary to the prevailing belief that incurrence covenants offer limited protection for creditors, our research reveals a significant and sudden decline in investment upon triggering these covenants. This evidence highlights a novel propagation mechanism for economic shocks, wherein contractual restrictions play a crucial role in the highly-leveraged corporate sector, becoming binding well before default or bankruptcy occurs.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2311\n\n2310\n\nHow to Construct Monthly VAR Proxies Based on Daily Futures Market Surprises\n\nLutz Kilian\n\nAbstract: It is common in applied work to estimate responses of macroeconomic aggregates to news shocks derived from surprise changes in daily futures prices around the date of policy announcements. This requires mapping the daily surprises into a monthly shock that may be used as an external instrument in a monthly VAR model or local projection. The standard approach has been to sum these daily surprises over the course of a given month when constructing the monthly proxy variable, ignoring the accounting relationship between daily and average monthly price data. In this paper, I provide a new approach to constructing monthly proxies from daily surprises that takes account of this link and revisit the question of how to use OPEC announcements to identify news shocks in VAR models of the global oil market. The proposed approach calls into question the interpretation of the identified shock as oil supply news and implies quantitatively and qualitatively different estimates of the macroeconomic impact of OPEC announcements.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2310\n\n2309\n\nGlobal Transportation Decarbonization\n\nDavid Rapson and Erich Muehlegger\n\nAbstract: A number of policy proposals call for replacing fossil fuels in the name of decarbonization, but these fuels will be difficult to replace due to their as-yet unrivaled bundle of attributes: abundance, ubiquity, energy density, transportability and cost. There is a growing commitment to electrification as the dominant decarbonization pathway for transportation. While deep electrification is promising for road vehicles in wealthy countries, it will face steep obstacles. In other sectors and in the developing world, it’s not even in pole position. Global transportation decarbonization will require decoupling emissions from economic growth, and decoupling emissions from growth will require not only new technologies, but cooperation in governance. The menu of policy options is replete with tradeoffs, particularly as the primacy of energy security and reliability (over emissions abatement) has once again been demonstrated in Europe and elsewhere.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2309\n\n2308\n\nFinancial Shocks in an Uncertain Economy\n\nChiara Scotti\n\nAbstract: The past 15 years have been eventful. The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) reminded us of the importance of a stable financial system to a well-functioning economy, one with low and stable inflation and maximum employment. Given the recent banking stress, we ponder this issue again. The pandemic was a huge shock surrounded by much uncertainty, making precise forecasts within traditional models difficult. And more recently, there has been continuous talk of a soft landing and recession risks.\n\nIn this paper, I focus on some of the lessons we have learned over the years: (i) uncertainty and tail risk have cyclical variation; (ii) financial shocks can have a significant effect on macroeconomic outcomes; (iii) the impact of shocks is stronger in periods of high volatility.\n\nThese lessons have important implications for policymakers in today’s environment.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2308\n\n2307\n\nComplementary Currencies and Liquidity: The Case of Coca-Base Money\n\nCristian Frasser and Lucie Lebeau\n\nAbstract: In coca-growing villages of Colombia, where pesos are scarce, coca-base is not only used as the main input for cocaine production—it also acts as a complementary currency (CC), circulating locally as a medium of exchange for day-to-day transactions. This paper provides a clear rationale for the economically-motivated adoption of a CC in a small open economy underprovided with official currency. An equilibrium currency shortage arises endogenously in our model, whereby shocks to the local supply of currency have a real impact on local trade and welfare. We show how a CC can mitigate the underprovision of liquidity and derive general insights relating the CC’s characteristics to its ability to supplement the official currency. In an application, we quantify the unintended consequences of various anti-narcotic policies pursued by the Colombian government on liquidity provision in coca-growing villages and identify the least-harmful policy tools given the policy objectives at stake.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2307\n\nGlobalization Institute No. 421\n\nOn the Nexus of Monetary Policy and Financial Stability: Novel Asset Market Monitoring Tools for Building Economic Resilience and Mitigating Financial Risks\n\nEnrique Martínez-García, Valerie Grossman and Lauren Spits\n\nAbstract: In this note we argue that asset pricing bubbles are an important source of financial instabilities. First, the literature has tended to overlook bubbles and their consequences under the premise that they are hard to detect in real time. We suggest that novel statistical techniques allow us to overcome those prejudices as they provide valuable signals of emerging exuberance in real‐time. Second, monetary policy has been slow to recognize that financial instability arising from bubbles can have adverse effects on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy itself and on the types of risks faced by policymakers. We argue that measuring and monitoring episodes of exuberance in housing—but also in other asset classes—can be useful not just for thinking about macroprudential strategies but also to conduct risk analysis for monetary policy.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/gwp421\n\n2306\n\nMoney Matters: Broad Divisia Money and the Recovery of Nominal GDP from the COVID-19 Recession\n\nMichael D. Bordo and John V. Duca\n\nAbstract: The rise of inflation in 2021 and 2022 surprised many macroeconomists who ignored the earlier surge in money growth because past instability in the demand for simple-sum monetary aggregates had made these aggregates unreliable indicators. We find that the demand for more theoretically-based Divisia aggregates can be modeled and that their growth rates provide useful information for future nominal GDP growth.\n\nUnlike M2 and Divisia-M2, whose velocities do not internalize shifts in liabilities across commercial and shadow banks, the velocities of broader Divisia monetary aggregates are more stable and can be reasonably empirically modeled in both the short run and the long run through the COVID-19 pandemic and to date. In the long run, these velocities depend on regulatory changes and mutual fund costs that affect the substitutability of money for other financial assets. In the short run, we control for swings in mortgage activity and use vaccination rates and an index of the stringency of government pandemic restrictions to control for the unusual effects of the pandemic.\n\nThe velocity of broad Divisia money temporarily declines during crises like the Great and COVID Recessions, but later rebounds. In each recession monetary policy lowered short-term interest rates to zero and engaged in quantitative easing of about $4 trillion. Nevertheless, broad money growth was more robust in the COVID Recession, likely reflecting that the banking system was less impaired and could promote rather than hinder multiple deposit creation. Partly as a result, our framework implies that nominal GDP growth and inflationary pressures rebounded much more quickly from the COVID Recession versus the Great Recession. We consider different scenarios for future Divisia money growth and the unwinding of the pandemic that have different implications for medium-term nominal GDP growth and inflationary pressures as monetary policy tightening seeks to restore low inflation.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2306\n\n2305\n\nThe Returns to Government R&D: Evidence from U.S. Appropriations Shocks (Revised December 2023)\n\nAppendix\n\nAndrew J. Fieldhouse and Karel Mertens\n\nAbstract: Based on a narrative classification of all significant postwar changes in R&D appropriations for five major federal agencies, we find that an increase in nondefense R&D appropriations leads to increases in various measures of innovative activity and higher business-sector productivity in the long run. We structurally estimate the production function elasticity of nondefense government R&D capital using the SP-IV methodology of Lewis and Mertens (2023) and obtain implied returns of 150 to 300 percent over the postwar period. The estimates indicate that government-funded R&D accounts for one quarter of business-sector TFP growth since WWII, and imply substantial underfunding of nondefense R&D.\n\nOriginal paper\n\nOriginal appendix\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2305r1\n\nAppendix DOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2305appr1\n\nGlobalization Institute No. 420\n\nA Theory of Net Capital Flows over the Global Financial Cycle\n\nJ. Scott Davis and Eric van Wincoop\n\nAbstract: We develop a theory to account for changes in net capital flows of safe and risky assets over the global financial cycle. We show empirically that countries that have a net debt of safe assets experience a rise in net outflows of safe assets (reduced accumulation of safe debt) during a downturn in the global financial cycle. This is accomplished through a rise in total net outflows and a drop in net outflows of risky assets. We develop a multi-country portfolio choice model that can account for these facts. The theory relies on cross-country heterogeneity in the share of an investor's portfolio invested in risky assets. A global drop in risky asset prices changes relative wealth across countries due to this heterogeneity, which leads to changes in net flows of safe and risky assets. The model is applied to 20 advanced countries and calibrated to reflect observed cross-country heterogeneity of net foreign asset positions of safe and risky assets. The implications of the calibrated model for net capital flows are quantitatively consistent with the data.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/gwp420\n\n2304\n\nEstimating Macroeconomic News and Surprise Shocks (Revised March 2024, new title November 2023)\n\nAppendix\n\nLutz Kilian, Michael D. Plante and Alexander W. Richter\n\nAbstract: The importance of understanding the economic effects of TFP news and surprise shocks is widely recognized in the literature. A common VAR approach is to identify responses to TFP news shocks by maximizing the variance share of TFP over a long horizon. Under suitable conditions, this approach also implies an estimate of the surprise shock. We find that these TFP max share estimators tend to be strongly biased when applied to data generated from DSGE models with shock processes that match the TFP moments in the data, both in the presence of TFP measurement error and in its absence. Incorporating a measure of TFP news into the VAR model and adapting the identification strategy substantially reduces the bias and RMSE of the impulse response estimates, even when there is sizable measurement error in the news variable. When applying this method to the data, we find that news shocks are slower to diffuse to TFP and have a smaller effect on real activity than implied by the TFP max share method.\n\nRevision 1\n\nOriginal paper\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2304r2\n\nAppendix DOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2304app\n\n2303\n\nDebt Maturity and Commitment on Firm Policies\n\nAndrea Gamba and Alessio Saretto\n\nAbstract: If firms can issue debt only at discrete dates, debt maturity is an effective device against the commitment problem on debt and investment policies. With shorter maturities, debt dynamics are less persistent and more valuable because upward leverage adjustments are faster and long-run leverage lower. Debt maturities that are relatively shorter than asset maturities increase marginal q, and reduce underinvestment. A decomposition of the credit spread consistent with equilibrium shows that the component due to the commitment problem on future debt issuances is sizeable when leverage and default risk are low, and is lower for shorter maturity.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2303\n\n2302\n\nState-Dependent Local Projections\n\nSílvia Gonçalves, Ana María Herrera, Lutz Kilian and Elena Pesavento\n\nAbstract: Do state-dependent local projections asymptotically recover the population responses of macroeconomic aggregates to structural shocks? The answer to this question depends on how the state of the economy is determined and on the magnitude of the shocks. When the state is exogenous, the local projection estimator recovers the population response regardless of the shock size. When the state depends on macroeconomic shocks, as is common in empirical work, local projections only recover the conditional response to an infinitesimal shock, but not the responses to larger shocks of interest in many applications. Simulations suggest that fiscal multipliers may be off by as much as 40 percent.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2302\n\n2301\n\nHeterogeneity in the Pass-Through from Oil to Gasoline Prices: A New Instrument for Estimating the Price Elasticity of Gasoline Demand\n\nLutz Kilian and Xiaoqing Zhou\n\nAbstract: We propose a new instrument for estimating the price elasticity of gasoline demand that exploits systematic differences across U.S. states in the pass-through of oil price shocks to retail gasoline prices. We show that these differences are primarily driven by the cost of producing and distributing gasoline, which varies with states’ access to oil and gasoline transportation infrastructure, refinery technology and environmental regulations, creating cross-sectional gasoline price shocks in response to an aggregate oil price shock. Time-varying estimates do not support the view that the gasoline demand elasticity has declined in absolute value to near zero since the 1980s. The elasticity was stable near -0.3 until the end of 2014. It rose to about -0.2 in 2015-16, but has remained stable since 2016. Gasoline demand is more responsive in states with lower personal income, higher unemployment rates and lower urban population shares. There is no evidence for an asymmetry in the elasticity with respect to positive and negative gasoline price shocks. We illustrate how these elasticity estimates inform the recent policy debate about the impact of gasoline tax holidays on consumers’ discretionary income, about the demand destruction from the spike in gasoline prices after the invasion of Ukraine and about the impact of rising gasoline prices on carbon emissions.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2301\n\n2022\n\n2224\n\nA Broader Perspective on the Inflationary Effects of Energy Price Shocks\n\nLutz Kilian and Xiaoqing Zhou\n\nAbstract: Consumers purchase energy in many forms. Sometimes energy goods are consumed directly, for instance, in the form of gasoline used to operate a vehicle, electricity to light a home or natural gas to heat a home. At other times, the cost of energy is embodied in the prices of goods and services that consumers buy, say when purchasing an airline ticket or when buying online garden furniture made from plastic to be delivered by mail. Previous research has focused on quantifying the pass-through of the price of crude oil or the price of motor gasoline to U.S. inflation. Neither approach accounts for the fact that percent changes in refined product prices need not be proportionate to the percent change in the price of oil, that not all energy is derived from oil and that the correlation of price shocks across energy markets is far from one. This paper develops a vector autoregressive model that quantifies the joint impact of shocks to several energy prices on headline and core CPI inflation. Our analysis confirms that focusing on gasoline price shocks alone will underestimate the inflationary pressures emanating from the energy sector, but not enough to overturn the conclusion that much of the observed increase in headline inflation in 2021 and 2022 reflected non-energy price shocks.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2224\n\nGlobalization Institute No. 419\n\nCommodity Exports, Financial Frictions and International Spillovers\n\nAppendix\n\nRomain Houssa, Jolan Mohimont and Christopher Otrok\n\nAbstract: This paper offers a solution to the international co-movement puzzle found in open-economy macroeconomic models. We develop a small open-economy (SOE) dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model describing three endogenous channels that capture spillovers from the world to a commodity exporter: a world commodity price channel, a domestic commodity supply channel and a financial channel. We estimate our model with Bayesian methods on two commodity-exporting SOEs, namely Canada and South Africa. In addition to explaining international business cycle synchronization, the new model attributes an important fraction of business cycle fluctuations to foreign shocks in the SOEs.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/gwp419\n\nAppendix DOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/gwp419app\n\n2223\n\nMacroeconomic Responses to Uncertainty Shocks: The Perils of Recursive Orderings\n\nLutz Kilian, Michael D. Plante and Alexander W. Richter\n\nAbstract: A common practice in empirical macroeconomics is to examine alternative recursive orderings of the variables in structural vector autoregressive (VAR) models. When the implied impulse responses look similar, the estimates are considered trustworthy. When they do not, the estimates are used to bound the true response without directly addressing the identification challenge. A leading example of this practice is the literature on the effects of uncertainty shocks on economic activity. We prove by counterexample that this practice is invalid in general, whether the data generating process is a structural VAR model or a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2223\n\n2222\n\nWhy Has U.S. Stock Ownership Doubled Since the Early 1980s? Equity Participation Over the Past Half Century\n\nJohn V. Duca and Mark Walker\n\nAbstract: The U.S. stock ownership rate doubled between 1983 and 2001 but remains below predictions of some equity participation models. Consistent with calibration studies by Heaton and Lucas (2000) and Gomes and Michaelides (2005), mutual fund costs and indicators of background labor risk are significantly related to stock ownership over 1964-2019. Coefficient estimates and continuous data on driving variables can be used to create a continuous proxy for stock ownership, which could help researchers gauge the effects of shocks that are transmitted via equity participation. Typically omitted asset transfer costs can help analyze other aspects of household portfolio behavior.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2222\n\n2221\n\nThe Dual Beveridge Curve (Revised February 2024)\n\nAnton Cheremukhin and Paulina Restrepo-Echavarria\n\nAbstract: The recent behavior of the Beveridge Curve significantly differs from past recessions and is hard to explain with traditional gradual changes in fundamentals. We propose a novel dual vacancy model where we acknowledge that not all vacancies are made equal—when firms post a vacancy they can hire from unemployment or they can poach a worker from another firm. Our dual vacancy model segments the labor market into separate search processes for unemployed and employed workers and provides a better fit to the data than traditional models assuming a homogeneous market. By analyzing labor market data from 2000 onwards, we estimate the proportions of the two types of vacancies and find a significant rise in poaching vacancies since the mid-2010s. The behavior of the share of poaching vacancies is explained by the residual hires to quits ratio and by an increasing trend in the profit-cost ratio of these positions. Once we adjust the Beveridge Curve to only include vacancies for the unemployed, the recent puzzling behavior disappears. These results imply that a slowdown in the demand for overall workers is likely to have a diminished effect on unemployment, affecting the implications of monetary policy for unemployment.\n\nOriginal paper\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2221r1\n\nGlobalization Institute No. 418\n\nJust Do IT? An Assessment of Inflation Targeting in a Global Comparative Case Study\n\nRoberto Duncan, Enrique Martínez-García and Patricia Toledo\n\nAbstract: This paper proposes new measures of the effectiveness of inflation targeting (IT) and evaluates its main drivers in a (large) sample of advanced economies (AEs) and emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs). Using synthetic control methods, we find that IT has heterogeneous effects on inflation across countries. The gains shifting the level of inflation (generally downwards) are modest and smaller in AEs than are those in EMDEs. All such gains are statistically significant in one out of three economies approximately. Second, statistically significant differences in keeping inflation close to target under IT (compared with estimated counterfactuals) can be detected more broadly in nearly half of the economies. Third, IT can be a source of economic resilience that helped cushion inflation fluctuations during the 2007-09 Global Financial Crisis with statistically significant gains mostly found among EMDEs (in two out of three of these economies). Finally, we find that IT effectiveness—measured by the dynamic treatment effect and the absolute deviations of both observed and synthetic inflation from target—is significantly correlated with indices of exchange rate stability and monetary policy independence, especially among EMDEs.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/gwp418\n\n2220\n\nThe Electric Ceiling: Limits and Costs of Full Electrification\n\nDavid Rapson and James Bushnell\n\nAbstract: Electrification is a centerpiece of global decarbonization efforts. Yet there are reasons to be skeptical of the inevitability, or at least the optimal pace, of the transition. We discuss several under-appreciated costs of full, or even deep, electrification. Consumer preferences can operate in favor of and in opposition to electrification goals; and electrification is likely to encounter physical and economic obstacles when it reaches some as-yet-unknown level. While we readily acknowledge the external benefits of decarbonization, we also explore several under-appreciated external costs. The credibility and eventual success of decarbonization efforts is enhanced by foreseeing and ideally avoiding predictable but non-obvious costs of promising abatement pathways. Thus, even with all of its promise, the degree of electrification may ultimately reach a limit.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2220\n\n2219\n\nNonlinear Budget Set Regressions for the Random Utility Model\n\nSoren Blomquist, Anil Kumar, Che-Yuan Liang and Whitney K. Newey\n\nAbstract: This paper is about the nonparametric regression of a choice variable on a nonlinear budget set when there is general heterogeneity, i.e., in the random utility model (RUM). We show that utility maximization makes this a three-dimensional regression with piecewise linear, convex budget sets with a more parsimonious specification than previously derived. We show that the regression allows for measurement and/or optimization errors in the outcome variable. We characterize all of the restrictions of utility maximization on the budget set regression and show how to check these restrictions. We formulate nonlinear budget set effects that can be identified by this regression and give automatic debiased machine learners of these effects. We find that in practice nonconvexities in the budget set have little effect on these estimates. We use control variables to allow for endogeneity of budget sets and adjust for productivity growth in taxable income. We apply the results to estimate .52 as the elasticity of an overall tax rate change in Sweden. We also find that the restrictions of utility maximization are satisfied at the choices made by nearly all individuals in the data.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2219\n\n2218\n\nCentral Bank Digital Currency: Financial Inclusion vs. Disintermediation\n\nJeremie Banet and Lucie Lebeau\n\nAbstract: An overlapping-generations model with income heterogeneity is developed to analyze the impact of introducing a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) on financial inclusion, and its potential adverse effect on bank funding. We highlight the role of two design parameters: the fixed cost of CBDC usage and the interest rate it pays, and derive principles for maximum inclusion and for mitigating the inclusion-intermediation trade-off. Agents’ choice of money instrument is endogenously driven by income heterogeneity. Pre-CBDC, wealthier agents adopt deposits, while poorer agents adopt cash and remain unbanked. CBDCs with low fixed costs (and low interest rates) are adopted by cash holders and directly increase inclusion. CBDCs with high fixed costs (and high interest rates) are adopted by deposit holders and increase inclusion by raising deposit rates. The former allows for more favorable inclusion-intermediation trade-offs. We calibrate the model to match the U.S. income distribution and aggregate share of unbanked households. A CBDC 50% cheaper (30% more expensive) than bank deposits decreases financial exclusion by 93% (71%) without impacting intermediation. In comparison, making the deposit market perfectly competitive would only decrease exclusion by 45%.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2218\n\n2217\n\nA Rescue or a Trap?—An Analysis of Parent PLUS Student Loans\n\nWenhua Di, Carla Fletcher and Jeff Webster\n\nAbstract: Parents taking out loans for their children’s college educations may face an excessive debt burden that jeopardizes their own financial security. This paper examines the experience of Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) borrowers using administrative data from a large student loan guaranty agency. We find that PLUS borrowers are more likely to default if their children attend low-resource institutions, typically ones where lower-income enrollments predominate. Although parent PLUS generally outperforms student loans, PLUS performance is sensitive to program costs during difficult economic times. In contrast, student outcomes depend more on educational outcomes. Interviews with borrowers confirm that PLUS borrowers have more experience handling debt than their children, but there is a lack of communication on repayment obligations and expectations between generations. This study reveals the differing consequences of parent and student borrowing for higher education and the troublesome PLUS program design that poses challenges to certain borrowers.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2217\n\n2216\n\nConsumption and Hours in the United States and Europe\n\nLei Fang and Fang Yang\n\nAbstract: We document large differences between the United States and Europe in allocations of expenditures and time for both market and home activities. Using a life-cycle model with home production and endogenous retirement, we find that the cross-country differences in consumption tax, social security system, income tax and TFP together can account for 68-95 percent of the cross-country variations and more than half of the average differences between Europe and the United States in aggregate hours and expenditures. These factors can also account well for the cross-country differences in allocations by age and generate substantially lower market hours in Europe for the age group of sixty and above as in the data. All the factors, except income tax, are quantitatively important for determining cross-country differences in expenditure allocations. While the differences in social security system and income tax are crucial in explaining the difference in market hours around retirement ages, TFP and consumption tax are more important for the difference in market hours for prime ages.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2216\n\n2215\n\nOperational Loss Recoveries and the Macroeconomic Environment: Evidence from the U.S. Banking Sector\n\nW. Scott Frame, Nika Lazaryan, Ping McLemore and Atanas Mihov\n\nAbstract: Using supervisory data from large U.S. bank holding companies (BHCs), we document that operational loss recovery rates decrease in macroeconomic downturns. This procyclical relationship varies by business lines and loss event types and is robust to alternative data aggregations, macroeconomic measurement horizons and estimation methodologies. Further analysis shows that resource constraints faced by BHC risk management functions are a plausible explanation for these patterns. Our findings offer new evidence on how economic shocks transmit to banking industry losses with implications for risk management and supervision.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2215\n\n2214\n\nAre Equity Option Returns Abnormal?

The alpha reduction, relative to competing static factor models, is between 50% and 75% depending on the computing model and the type of option position.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2214\n\n2213\n\nInterest Rate Surprises: A Tale of Two Shocks\n\nRicardo Nunes, Ali Ozdagli and Jenny Tang\n\nAbstract: Interest rate surprises around FOMC announcements reveal both the surprise in the monetary policy stance (the pure policy shock) and interest rate movements driven by exogenous information about the economy from the central bank (the information shock). In order to disentangle the effects of these two shocks, we use interest rate changes on days of macroeconomic data releases. On these release dates, there are no pure policy shocks, which allows us to identify the impact of information shocks and thereby distill pure policy shocks from interest rate surprises around FOMC announcements. Our results show that there is a prominent central bank information component in the widely used high-frequency policy rate surprise measure. When we remove this central bank information component, the estimated effects of monetary policy shocks are more pronounced relative to those estimated using the entire policy rate surprise.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2213\n\n2212\n\nUncertainty, Stock Prices and Debt Structure: Evidence from the U.S.-China Trade War\n\nAli Ozdagli and Jianlin Wang\n\nAbstract: Using the recent U.S.-China trade war as a laboratory, we show that policy uncertainty shocks have a significant impact on stock prices. This impact is less negative for firms that heavily rely on bank debt whereas non-bank debt does not have a mitigating effect. Moreover, the mitigating effect of bank debt is concentrated among zombie firms. A zombie firm that derives half of its capital from bank debt has no negative stock price reaction to increased uncertainty. These results are consistent with bank debt providing insurance for zombie firms in bad economic times.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2212\n\n2211\n\nHeterogeneity and the Effects of Aggregation on Wage Growth\n\nRobert Rich and Joseph Tracy\n\nAbstract: This paper focuses on the implications of alternative methods of aggregating individual wage data for the behavior of economy-wide wage growth. The analysis is motivated by evidence of significant heterogeneity in individual wage growth and its cyclicality. Because of this heterogeneity, the choice of aggregation will affect the properties of economy-wide wage growth measures. To assess the importance of this consideration, we provide a decomposition of wage growth into aggregation effects and composition effects and use the decomposition to compare growth in an average wage—specifically average hourly earnings—to a measure of average wage growth from the Survey of Income and Program Participation. We find that aggregation effects largely account for average hourly earnings growth being persistently lower and less cyclical than average wage growth over the period 1990-2015, with these effects reflecting a disproportionate weighting of high-earning workers. The analysis also indicates that composition effects now play a more limited role in the cyclicality of wage growth compared to results reported in previous studies for earlier time periods.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2211\n\nGlobalization Institute No. 417\n\nFlexible Average Inflation Targeting: How Much Is U.S. Monetary Policy Changing?\n\nJarod Coulter, Roberto Duncan and Enrique Martínez-García\n\nAbstract: One major outcome of the Federal Reserve’s 2019–20 framework review was the adoption of a Flexible Average Inflation Targeting (FAIT) strategy in August 2020. Using synthetic control methods, we document that U.S. inflation rose post-FAIT considerably more than predicted had the strategy not changed (an average of 1.18 percentage points during 2020:M8-2022:M2). To explore the extent to which targeting average inflation delayed the Fed’s response and contributed to post-FAIT inflation, we adopt a version of the open-economy New Keynesian model in Martínez-García (2021) and document the economic consequences of adopting alternative measures of average inflation as policy objectives. We document three additional major findings using this general equilibrium setup: First, depending on how far back and how much weight is assigned to past inflation misses, the policy outcomes under FAIT are similar to those under the pre-FAIT regime. Secondly, we find that the implementation of FAIT can have large effects over short periods of time as it tends to delay action. However, over longer periods of time—such as the 1984:Q1-2019:Q4 pre-FAIT period—its effects wash out and appear negligible. Finally, we find that different average inflation measures explain an average of 0.5 percentage points per quarter of the post-FAIT inflation surge, indicating that targeting average inflation by itself can only explain part of the inflation spike since August 2020.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/gwp417\n\n2210\n\nDemographic Transition, Industrial Policies and Chinese Economic Growth (Revised February 2024)\n\nMichael Dotsey, Wenli Li and Fang Yang\n\nAbstract: We build a unified framework to quantitatively examine how demographic transition and industrial policies have contributed to China’s economic growth in the past five decades. On the demographic side, we consider evolutions in government population-control policies, life expectancy and pension income replacement. Industrial policies include changes in the speed of the growth of entrepreneurship, industry-specific interest subsidies and financial intermediation costs. Our analyses suggest that the demographic transition alone barely affects the aggregate savings rate, mainly due to general equilibrium feedback effects from prices. However, demographics account for a considerable fraction of the increase in per capita output growth since 1970. By comparison, industrial policy changes contribute significantly to the rise in both the aggregate savings rate and per capita output growth during the period. Notably, the interactions between the demographic transition and industrial policy changes cause aggregate savings to rise, but have little effect on per capita output growth. A novel factor of the model is endogenous human capital accumulation, a driver of per capita output growth. Our results are robust to the endogenization of fertility decisions.\n\nOriginal paper\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2210r1\n\n2209\n\nThe Effects of Audit Partners on Financial Reporting: Evidence from U.S. Bank Holding Companies\n\nGauri Bhat, Hemang Desai, W. Scott Frame, Christoffer Koch and Erik J. Mayer\n\nAbstract: This paper uses confidential data on audit engagement partner names from regulatory filings of bank holding companies (BHC) to investigate whether partners display individual style that affects the financial reporting of the BHCs. We focus on loan loss provisioning. We construct an audit partner-BHC matched panel data set that enables us to track different partners across different BHCs over time. We employ two empirical approaches to investigate partner style. The first approach tests whether partner fixed effects are statistically significant in loan loss provisioning models. The second approach tests whether a partner’s history of loan loss provisioning predicts future practices for the same partner. Our empirical evidence does not support systematic differences in loan loss provisioning across audit engagement partners, suggesting that the audit firm’s standards and quality control constrain personal partner style.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2209\n\n2208\n\nA Robust Test for Weak Instruments with Multiple Endogenous Regressors (Revised December 2022)\n\nDaniel J. Lewis and Karel Mertens\n\nAbstract: We generalize the popular bias-based test of Stock and Yogo (2005) for instrument strength in two-stage least-squares models with multiple endogenous regressors to be robust to heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation. Equivalently, we extend the robust test of Montiel Olea and Pflueger (2013) for a single endogenous regressor to the general case with multiple endogenous regressors. We describe a simple procedure for applied researchers to conduct our generalized first-stage test of instrument strength, and provide fast Matlab code for its implementation. In simulations, our test controls size and is powerful. We demonstrate our testing procedures by considering the estimation of the state-dependent effects of fiscal policy as in Ramey and Zubairy (2018).\n\nOriginal paper\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2208r1\n\n2207\n\nThe Impact of Minority Representation at Mortgage Lenders\n\nW. Scott Frame, Ruidi Huang, Erik J. Mayer and Adi Sunderam\n\nAbstract: We study links between the labor market for loan officers and access to mortgage credit. Using novel data matching the (near) universe of mortgage applications to loan officers, we find that minorities are significantly underrepresented among loan officers. Minority borrowers are less likely to complete mortgage applications, have completed applications approved, and to ultimately take-up a loan. These disparities are significantly reduced when minority borrowers work with minority loan officers. Minority borrowers working with minority loan officers also have lower default rates. Our results suggest that minority underrepresentation among loan officers has adverse effects on minority borrowers’ access to credit.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2207\n\nGlobalization Institute No. 416\n\nThe Global Financial Cycle and Capital Flows During the COVID-19 Pandemic (Revised November 2022)\n\nJ. Scott Davis and Andrei Zlate\n\nAbstract: We estimate the heterogeneous effect of the global financial cycle on exchange rates and cross-border capital flows during the COVID-19 pandemic, using weekly exchange rate and portfolio flow data for a panel of 59 advanced and emerging market economies. We begin by estimating a global financial cycle (GFC) index at the weekly frequency with data through the end of 2021, and observe an outsized decline in the index over a period of just four weeks during February and March 2020. We then estimate the country-specific sensitivities of exchange rates and capital flows to fluctuations in the GFC. We show that the ability of the GFC to explain fluctuations in exchange rates and capital flows increased dramatically during the pandemic crisis. By using the law of the total variance we are able to decompose a panel of country-specific exchange rate or capital flow series into the time-series variance of the cross-sectional mean and the cross-sectional variance around that mean. We show that the GFC mainly explains the time-series variance of the cross-sectional mean. In addition, during the pandemic crisis like the COVID pandemic in 2020, relevant high-frequency indicators such as the weekly changes in cases and vaccination rates, which varied in timing and intensity across countries, improve the cross-sectional fit of our model by just as much as standard macroeconomic fundamentals such as the current account, reserves and net foreign assets.\n\nOriginal paper\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/gwp416r1\n\n2206\n\nHow Do Mortgage Rate Resets Affect Consumer Spending and Debt Repayment? Evidence from Canadian Consumers\n\nKatya Kartashova and Xiaoqing Zhou\n\nAbstract: One of the most important channels through which monetary policy affects the real economy is changes in mortgage rates. This paper studies the effects of mortgage rate changes resulting from monetary policy shifts on homeowners’ spending, debt repayment and defaults. The Canadian institutional setting facilitates the design of identification strategies for causal inference, since the vast majority of mortgages in the country experience predetermined, periodic and automatic contract renewals with the mortgage rate reset based on the prevailing market rate. This allows us to exploit quasi-random variation in the timing of the rate reset and present causal evidence for both rate declines and increases, with the help of detailed, representative consumer credit panel data. We find asymmetric effects of rate changes on spending, debt repayment and defaults. Our results can be rationalized by the conventional cash-flow effect in conjunction with changes in consumer expectations about future interest rates upon the reset. Given the pervasiveness of Canadian-type mortgages in many other OECD countries, our findings have broader implications for the transmission of monetary policy to the household sector.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2206\n\n2205\n\nWhen Do State-Dependent Local Projections Work?\n\nSílvia Gonçalves, Ana María Herrera, Lutz Kilian and Elena Pesavento\n\nAbstract: Many empirical studies estimate impulse response functions that depend on the state of the economy. Most of these studies rely on a variant of the local projection (LP) approach to estimate the state-dependent impulse response functions. Despite its widespread application, the asymptotic validity of the LP approach to estimating state-dependent impulse responses has not been established to date. We formally derive this result for a structural state-dependent vector autoregressive process. The model only requires the structural shock of interest to be identified. A sufficient condition for the consistency of the state-dependent LP estimator of the response function is that the first- and second-order conditional moments of the structural shocks are independent of current and future states, given the information available at the time the shock is realized. This rules out models in which the state of the economy is a function of current or future realizations of the outcome variable of interest, as is often the case in applied work. Even when the state is a function of past values of this variable only, consistency may hold only at short horizons.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2205\n\n2204\n\nDynamic Identification Using System Projections on Instrumental Variables (Revised July 2024)\n\nAppendix (Revised July 2024)\n\nDaniel J. Lewis and Karel Mertens\n\nAbstract: We propose System Projections on Instrumental Variables (SP-IV) to estimate structural relationships using regressions of structural impulse responses obtained from local projections or vector autoregressions. Relative to IV with distributed lags of shocks as instruments, SP-IV imposes weaker exogeneity requirements and can improve efficiency and increase effective instrument strength relative to the typical 2SLS estimator. We describe inference under strong and weak identification. The SP-IV estimator outperforms other estimators of Phillips Curve parameters in simulations. We estimate the Phillips Curve implied by the main business cycle shock of Angeletos et al. (2020) and find that the impulse responses are consistent with weak but also relatively strong cyclical connections between inflation and unemployment.\n\nRevision 2\n\nRevision 1\n\nOriginal paper\n\nOriginal appendix\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2204r3\n\nAppendix DOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2204appr1\n\n2203\n\nFinancial Technology and the Transmission of Monetary Policy: The Role of Social Networks (Revised February 2023, new title)\n\nXiaoqing Zhou\n\nAbstract: Financial technology-based (FinTech) lending is expected to ease U.S. mortgage market frictions that have weakened the transmission of monetary policy to households. This paper establishes that social networks play a key role in consumers’ adoption of FinTech lending, which amplifies the effects of a monetary stimulus. I provide causal estimates of the network effect on FinTech adoption using county-level data. To quantify the role of FinTech lending and network spillovers in the transmission of monetary policy shocks, I build a heterogeneous-agent model with social learning. The model shows that the consumption response to a monetary stimulus is 13% higher in the presence of FinTech lending and network spillovers, and that about half of this improvement is accounted for by network spillovers.\n\nOriginal paper\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2203r1\n\n2202\n\nEndogenous Option Pricing\n\nAndrea Gamba and Alessio Saretto\n\nAbstract: We show that a structural model of firm decisions can produce very flexible implied volatility surfaces: upward and downward sloping, u-shaped. A calibrated version of the model is able to match many unconditional financial characteristics of the average option-able stock, and can help explain how, contrary to simple economic intuition, more valuable growth and contraction options are associated with a more negatively sloped implied volatility curve (i.e., a more negatively skewed implied distribution).\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2202\n\nGlobalization Institute No. 415\n\nRevisiting the Great Ratios Hypothesis (Revised April 2023)\n\nAlexander Chudik, M. Hashem Pesaran and Ron P. Smith\n\nAbstract: Kaldor called the constancy of certain ratios stylized facts, whereas Klein and Kosobud called them great ratios. While they often appear in theoretical models, the empirical literature finds little evidence for them, perhaps because the procedures used cannot deal with lack of cointegration, two-way causality and cross-country error dependence. We propose a new system pooled mean group estimator that can deal with these features. Monte Carlo results show it performs well compared with other estimators, and using it on a dataset over 150 years and 17 countries, we find support for five of the seven ratios considered.\n\nOriginal paper\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/gwp415r1\n\n2201\n\nThe Matching Function and Nonlinear Business Cycles\n\nJoshua Bernstein, Alexander W.

Using a general constant returns to scale matching function, this paper first derives analytical conditions that determine how the cyclicality of the matching elasticity amplifies or dampens the nonlinear dynamics of the job finding and unemployment rates. It then demonstrates that these effects are quantitatively significant and driven by plausible variation in the matching elasticity.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2201\n\nGlobalization Institute No. 414\n\nSocial Distancing, Vaccination and Evolution of COVID-19 Transmission Rates in Europe (Revised July 2022)\n\nCodes\n\nAlexander Chudik, M. Hashem Pesaran and Alessandro Rebucci\n\nAbstract: This paper provides estimates of COVID-19 transmission rates and explains their evolution for selected European countries since the start of the pandemic taking account of changes in voluntary and government-mandated social distancing, incentives to comply, vaccination and the emergence of new variants. Evidence based on panel data modeling indicates that the diversity of outcomes that we document may have resulted from the non-linear interaction of mandated and voluntary social distancing and the economic incentives that governments provided to support isolation. The importance of these factors declined over time, with vaccine uptake driving heterogeneity in country experiences in 2021. Our approach also allows us to identify the basic reproduction number, R0, which is precisely estimated around 5, which is much larger than the values in the range of 2.4 – 3.9 assumed in the extant literature.\n\nRevision 1\n\nOriginal paper\n\nOriginal codes\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/gwp414r2\n\nGlobalization Institute No. 413\n\nOn the Distributional Effects of International Tariffs (Revised March 2023)\n\nDaniel Carroll and Sewon Hur\n\nAbstract: We provide a quantitative analysis of the distributional effects of the 2018 increase in tariffs by the U.S. and its major trading partners.

When tariff revenues are used to reduce distortionary taxes on consumption, labor and capital income, the average welfare loss from the trade war is equivalent to a permanent 0.1 percent reduction in consumption. Much larger welfare losses are concentrated among retirees and low-wealth households, while only wealthy households experience a welfare gain.\n\nOriginal paper\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/gwp413r1\n\n2021\n\n2117\n\nComment on Giacomini, Kitagawa and Read’s ‘Narrative Restrictions and Proxies’\n\nLutz Kilian\n\nAbstract: In a series of recent studies, Raffaella Giacomini and Toru Kitagawa have developed an innovative new methodological approach to estimating sign-identified structural VAR models that seeks to build a bridge between Bayesian and frequentist approaches in the literature. Their latest paper with Matthew Read contains thought-provoking new insights about modeling narrative restrictions in sign-identified structural VAR models. My discussion puts their contribution into the context of Giacomini and Kitagawa’s broader research agenda and relates it to the larger literature on estimating structural VAR models subject to sign restrictions.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2117\n\n2116\n\nThe Impact of Rising Oil Prices on U.S. Inflation and Inflation Expectations in 2020-23\n\nLutz Kilian and Xiaoqing Zhou\n\nAbstract: Predictions of oil prices reaching $100 per barrel during the winter of 2021/22 have raised fears of persistently high inflation and rising inflation expectations for years to come. We show that these concerns have been overstated. A $100 oil scenario of the type discussed by many observers, would only briefly raise monthly headline inflation, before fading rather quickly. However, the short-run effects on headline inflation would be sizable. For example, on a year-over-year basis, headline PCE inflation would increase by 1.8 percentage points at the end of 2021 under this scenario, but only by 0.4 percentage points at the end of 2022. In contrast, the impact on measures of core inflation such as trimmed mean PCE inflation is only 0.4 and 0.3 percentage points in 2021 and 2022, respectively. These estimates already account for any increases in inflation expectations under the scenario. The peak response of the 1-year household inflation expectation would be 1.2 percentage points, while that of the 5-year expectation would be 0.2 percentage points.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2116\n\n2115\n\nEmpirical Bayes Control of the False Discovery Exceedance\n\nPallavi Basu, Luella Fu, Alessio Saretto and Wenguang Sun\n\nAbstract: In sparse large-scale testing problems where the false discovery proportion (FDP) is highly variable, the false discovery exceedance (FDX) provides a valuable alternative to the widely used false discovery rate (FDR). We develop an empirical Bayes approach to controlling the FDX. We show that for independent hypotheses from a two-group model and dependent hypotheses from a Gaussian model fulfilling the exchangeability condition, an oracle decision rule based on ranking and thresholding the local false discovery rate (lfdr) is optimal in the sense that the power is maximized subject to FDX constraint. We propose a data-driven FDX procedure that emulates the oracle via carefully designed computational shortcuts. We investigate the empirical performance of the proposed method using simulations and illustrate the merits of FDX control through an application for identifying abnormal stock trading strategies.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2115\n\nGlobalization Institute No. 412\n\nMonetary Policy Uncertainty and Economic Fluctuations at the Zero Lower Bound\n\nRachel Doehr and Enrique Martínez-García\n\nAbstract: We propose a TVP-VAR with stochastic volatility for the unemployment rate, core inflation and the federal funds rate augmented with survey-based interest rate expectations and uncertainty and a FAVAR with a wider set of observable variables and alternative monetary policy measures in order to explore U.S. monetary policy, accounting for the zero lower bound. We find that a rise in monetary policy uncertainty increases unemployment and lowers core inflation; the effects on unemployment in particular are robust (a gradual 0.4 percentage point increase), lasting more than two years after the initial shock. Interest rate uncertainty shocks explain a significant portion of macro fluctuations, particularly after the 2007-09 global financial crisis contributing to push the unemployment rate one percentage point higher during the early phase of the subsequent recovery. Furthermore, we find that higher interest rate uncertainty makes forward guidance shocks (but also federal funds rate shocks) less effective at moving unemployment and core inflation. We also posit a theoretical model to provide the structural backbone for our empirical results, via an “option value” channel. Theory yields sizeable real effects and a muted monetary policy transmission mechanism as firms choose to postpone investment decisions in response to heightened interest rate uncertainty.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/gwp412\n\n2114\n\nWealth Inequality and Return Heterogeneity During the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nKatya Kartashova and Xiaoqing Zhou\n\nAbstract: Wealth inequality in the U.S., measured by the top 1% wealth share, experienced dramatic changes in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Economic theory suggests that the key to understanding wealth inequality is heterogeneity in the return to net worth across households. To understand the dynamics of wealth inequality during the COVID-19 pandemic, we develop a novel methodology that allows us to estimate the returns to net worth for different groups of households at relatively high frequency. We show that portfolio heterogeneity and asset price movements are the main determinants of wealth returns and inequality, whereas saving-rate heterogeneity and within-class return differences played a minor role. As the stock market continued to outperform the housing market, the return of the wealthy has risen faster than that of other households, reinforcing the wealth concentration at the top. We also document a widening racial return gap between white and black households later in the pandemic. Nearly all of the racial differences in the wealth return, however, are explained by the differences in wealth, not by race itself. Whereas the previous literature has evaluated return heterogeneity and its implications for long-run wealth inequality in low-frequency data, our analysis suggests that return heterogeneity together with large asset price movements is also key to understanding short-run dynamics in wealth inequality.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2114\n\n2113\n\nBargaining Under Liquidity Constraints: Nash vs. Kalai in the Laboratory\n\nJohn Duffy, Lucie Lebeau and Daniela Puzzello\n\nAbstract: We report on an experiment in which buyers and sellers engage in semi-structured bargaining in two dimensions: how much of a good the seller will produce and how much money the buyer will offer the seller in exchange. Our aim is to evaluate the empirical relevance of two axiomatic bargaining solutions, the generalized Nash bargaining solution and Kalai's proportional bargaining solution. These bargaining solutions predict different outcomes when buyers are constrained in their money holdings. We first use the case when the buyer is not liquidity constrained to estimate the bargaining power parameter, which we find to be equal to 1/2. Then, imposing liquidity constraints on buyers, we find strong evidence in support of the Kalai proportional solution and against the generalized Nash solution. Our findings have policy implications, e.g., for the welfare cost of inflation in search-theoretic models of money.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2113\n\nGlobalization Institute No. 411\n\nFirm Entry and Exit and Aggregate Growth\n\nJose Asturias, Sewon Hur, Timothy J. Kehoe and Kim J. Ruhl\n\nAbstract: Applying the Foster, Haltiwanger and Krizan (FHK) (2001) decomposition to plant-level manufacturing data from Chile and Korea, we find that the entry and exit of plants account for a larger fraction of aggregate productivity growth during periods of fast GDP growth. To analyze this relationship, we develop a model of firm entry and exit based on Hopenhayn (1992). When we introduce reforms that reduce entry costs or reduce barriers to technology adoption into a calibrated model, we find that the entry and exit terms in the FHK decomposition become more important as GDP grows rapidly, just as they do in the data from Chile and Korea.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/gwp411\n\n2112\n\nThe Local Fiscal Multiplier of Intergovernmental Grants: Evidence from Federal Medicaid Assistance to States\n\nSeth Giertz and Anil Kumar\n\nAbstract: Advocates of Medicaid expansion argue that federal Medicaid assistance to states fosters economic activity, generating positive local multiplier effects. Furthermore, during economic downturns, Congress regularly tweaks federal match rates for state Medicaid spending – including during the COVID-19 public health emergency – in order to assist states. Despite heavy reliance on Medicaid funding formulas, identifying the economic effect of these federal transfers has proved challenging. This is because federal Medicaid assistance (to states) is endogenous, since funding levels are correlated with unobserved factors driving state economic activity. To address this concern, we construct an instrument based on a slope discontinuity in the federal matching rate for state Medicaid spending. Using state-level panel data from 1990 to 2013, we find that federal Medicaid assistance does stimulate economic activity, but the implied cost per job created is quite high and the multiplier is well below 1. Despite modest economic effects over the entire sample period, we find that federal Medicaid assistance provided powerful fiscal stimulus to states after the Great Recession when the implied multiplier shot up to 1.5.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2112\n\nGlobalization Institute No. 410\n\nA Theory of Gross and Net Capital Flows over the Global Financial Cycle (Revised December 2022, new title)\n\nJ. Scott Davis and Eric van Wincoop\n\nAbstract: We develop a theory to account for changes in gross and net capital flows over the global financial cycle (GFC). The theory relies critically on portfolio heterogeneity among investors within and across countries, related to risky portfolio shares and portfolio shares allocated to foreign assets. A global drop in risky asset prices during a downturn of the GFC changes relative wealth within and across countries due to portfolio heterogeneity. This leads to changes in gross and net capital flows that are consistent with the stylized facts: all countries experience a decline in gross capital flows (retrenchment), while countries that have a net debt of safe assets experience a rise in total net outflows and net outflows of safe assets and a drop in net outflows of risky assets. The model is applied to 20 advanced countries and calibrated to micro data related to within country portfolio heterogeneity, as well as cross country heterogeneity of net foreign asset positions of safe and risky assets. The implications of the calibrated model for gross and net capital flows are quantitatively consistent with the data.\n\nOriginal paper\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/gwp410r1\n\n2111\n\nWage Setting Under Targeted Search\n\nAnton Cheremukhin and Paulina Restrepo-Echavarria\n\nAbstract: When setting initial compensation, some firms set a fixed, non-negotiable wage while others bargain. In this paper we propose a parsimonious search and matching model with two-sided heterogeneity, where the choice of wage-setting protocol, wages, search intensity and degree of randomness in matching are endogenous. We find that posting and bargaining coexist as wage-setting protocols if there is sufficient heterogeneity in match quality, search costs or market tightness and that labor market tightness and relative costs of search play a key role in the optimal choice of the wage-setting mechanism. Finally, we show that bargaining prevalence is positively correlated with wages, residual wage dispersion and labor market tightness, both in the model and in the data.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2111\n\n2110\n\nHousehold Inflation Expectations and Consumer Spending: Evidence from Panel Data\n\nMary A. Burke and Ali Ozdagli\n\nAbstract: Recent research offers mixed results concerning the relationship between inflation expectations and consumption, using qualitative measures of readiness to spend. We revisit this question using survey panel data of actual spending from the U.S. between 2009 and 2012 that also allows us to control for household heterogeneity. We find that durables spending increases with expected inflation only for selected types of households while nondurables spending does not respond to expected inflation. Moreover, spending decreases with expected unemployment. These results imply a limited stimulating effect of inflation expectations on aggregate consumption, which could be reversed if inflation and unemployment expectations move together.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2110\n\n2109\n\nCountercyclical Fluctuations in Uncertainty are Endogenous\n\nJoshua Bernstein, Michael Plante, Alexander W. Richter and Nathaniel A. Throckmorton\n\nAbstract: This paper uses a battery of calibrated and estimated structural models to determine the causal drivers of the negative correlation between output and aggregate uncertainty. We find the transmission of uncertainty shocks to output is weak, while aggregate uncertainty endogenously responds to first moment shocks in the presence of labor market search frictions. This indicates that countercyclical movements in aggregate uncertainty are endogenous responses to changes in output, rather than exogenous impulses. A vector autoregression on simulated data shows recursive identification techniques do not robustly identify structural uncertainty shocks.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2109\n\n2108\n\nContainer Trade and the U.S. Recovery\n\nLutz Kilian, Nikos Nomikos and Xiaoqing Zhou\n\nAbstract: Since the 1970s, exports and imports of manufactured goods have been the engine of international trade and much of that trade relies on container shipping. This paper introduces a new monthly index of the volume of container trade to and from North America. Incorporating this index into a structural macroeconomic VAR model facilitates the identification of shocks to domestic U.S. demand as well as foreign demand for U.S. manufactured goods. We show that, unlike in the Great Recession, the primary determinant of the U.S. economic contraction in early 2020 was a sharp drop in domestic demand. Although detrended data for personal consumption expenditures and manufacturing output suggest that the U.S. economy has recovered to near 90% of pre-pandemic levels as of March 2021, our structural VAR model shows that the component of manufacturing output driven by domestic demand had only recovered to 57% of pre-pandemic levels and that of real personal consumption only to 78%. The difference is mainly accounted for by unexpected reductions in frictions in the container shipping market.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2108\n\nGlobalization Institute No. 409\n\nPooled Bewley Estimator of Long-Run Relationships in Dynamic Heterogenous Panels (Revised November 2023)\n\nCodes\n\nAlexander Chudik, M. Hashem Pesaran and Ron P. Smith\n\nAbstract: Using a transformation of the autoregressive distributed lag model due to Bewley, a novel pooled Bewley (PB) estimator of long-run coefficients for dynamic panels with heterogeneous short-run dynamics is proposed. The PB estimator is directly comparable to the widely used Pooled Mean Group (PMG) estimator, and is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. Monte Carlo simulations show good small sample performance of PB compared to the existing estimators in the literature, namely PMG, panel dynamic OLS (PDOLS) and panel fully-modified OLS (FMOLS). Application of two bias-correction methods and a bootstrapping of critical values to conduct inference robust to cross-sectional dependence of errors are also considered. The utility of the PB estimator is illustrated in an empirical application to the aggregate consumption function.\n\nRevision 1\n\nOriginal paper\n\nSupplement to original paper\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/gwp409r2\n\n2107\n\nConspicuous Consumption: Vehicle Purchases by Non-Prime Consumers\n\nWenhua Di and Yichen Su\n\nAbstract: Consumers with higher income often spend more on luxury goods. As a result, lower-income consumers who seek to increase their perceived income and social status may be motivated to purchase conspicuous luxury goods. Lower-income consumers may also desire to emulate the visible consumption displayed by their wealthier peers. Using a unique vehicle financing dataset, we find that consumers with lower credit scores value vehicle brand prestige more than average consumers. The stronger preferences for prestige lead non-prime consumers to purchase more expensive vehicles than they otherwise would have. We find evidence that the preferences for prestige are driven both by status signaling and peer emulation motives. Furthermore, we show that larger vehicle purchases financed by auto loans lead to worse loan performance and credit standing for non-prime consumers.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2107\n\n2106\n\nNonlinear Search and Matching Explained\n\nJoshua Bernstein, Alexander W. Richter and Nathaniel Throckmorton\n\nAbstract: Competing explanations for the sources of nonlinearity in search and matching models indicate that they are not fully understood. This paper derives an analytical solution to a textbook model that highlights the mechanisms that generate nonlinearity and quantifies their contributions. Procyclical variation in the matching elasticity creates nonlinearity in the job finding rate, which interacts with the law of motion for unemployment. These results show the matching function choice is not innocuous. Quantitatively, the Den Haan et al. (2000) matching function more than doubles the skewness of unemployment and welfare cost of business cycles, compared to the Cobb-Douglas specification.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2106\n\n2105\n\nPaycheck Protection Program: County-Level Determinants and Effect on Unemployment\n\nPavel Kapinos\n\nAbstract: This paper uses U.S. county-level data to study the determinants and effects of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The paper first overviews the timeline and institutional aspects of the PPP, implemented in the second quarter of 2020 and worth about $669 billion in forgivable small business loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA). It then studies the determinants of the county-level ratios of PPP loans per job lost during the original unemployment surge associated with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in late March 2020 and finds that it does not appear to be a major driver of the PPP loan concentration; instead, it was primarily driven by the local banking conditions and demographic factors. The second part of this paper uses the method of local projections to determine whether the participation in the PPP program improved economic conditions following its implementation. Impulse responses in the standard linear framework are positive and statistically significant, albeit economically negligible, suggesting that the PPP was entirely ineffective in stabilizing labor market conditions. Extending the framework to state-dependent local projections reverses this result: PPP lending had a significant effect on reducing unemployment on average and especially in counties with strong banking liquidity and an educated labor force.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2105\n\nGlobalization Institute No. 408\n\nCOVID-19 Fiscal Support and Its Effectiveness\n\nAlexander Chudik, Kamiar Mohaddes and Mehdi Raissi\n\nAbstract: This paper uses a threshold-augmented Global VAR model to quantify the macroeconomic effects of countries’ discretionary fiscal actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its fallout. Our results are threefold: (1) fiscal policy is playing a key role in mitigating the effects of the pandemic; (2) all else equal, countries that implemented larger fiscal support are expected to experience less output contractions; (3) emerging markets are also benefiting from the synchronized fiscal actions globally through the spillover channel and reduced financial market volatility.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/gwp408\n\n2104\n\nHow Foreign- and U.S.-Born Latinos Fare During Recessions and Recoveries\n\nPia M. Orrenius and Madeline Zavodny\n\nAbstract: Latinos make up the nation’s largest ethnic minority group. The majority of Latinos are U.S. born, making the progress and well-being of Latinos no longer just a question of immigrant assimilation but also of the effectiveness of U.S. educational institutions and labor markets in equipping young Latinos to move out of the working class and into the middle class. One significant headwind to progress among Latinos is recessions. Economic outcomes of Latinos are far more sensitive to the business cycle than are outcomes for non-Hispanic whites. Latinos also have higher poverty rates than whites, although the gap had been falling prior to the pandemic. Deep holes in the pandemic safety net further imperiled Latino progress in 2020 and almost surely will in 2021 as well. Policies that would help working-class and poor Latinos include immigration reform and education reform and broader access to affordable health care.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2104\n\nGlobalization Institute No. 407\n\nCOVID-19 Time-Varying Reproduction Numbers Worldwide: An Empirical Analysis of Mandatory and Voluntary Social Distancing\n\nCodes\n\nAlexander Chudik, M. Hashem Pesaran and Alessandro Rebucci\n\nAbstract: This paper estimates time-varying COVID-19 reproduction numbers worldwide solely based on the number of reported infected cases, allowing for under-reporting. Estimation is based on a moment condition that can be derived from an agent-based stochastic network model of COVID-19 transmission. The outcomes in terms of the reproduction number and the trajectory of per-capita cases through the end of 2020 are very diverse. The reproduction number depends on the transmission rate and the proportion of susceptible population, or the herd immunity effect. Changes in the transmission rate depend on changes in the behavior of the virus, reflecting mutations and vaccinations, and changes in people's behavior, reflecting voluntary or government mandated isolation. Over our sample period, neither mutation nor vaccination are major factors, so one can attribute variation in the transmission rate to variations in behavior. Evidence based on panel data models explaining transmission rates for nine European countries indicates that the diversity of outcomes resulted from the non-linear interaction of mandatory containment measures, voluntary precautionary isolation and the economic incentives that governments provided to support isolation. These effects are precisely estimated and robust to various assumptions. As a result, countries with seemingly different social distancing policies achieved quite similar outcomes in terms of the reproduction number. These results imply that ignoring the voluntary component of social distancing could introduce an upward bias in the estimates of the effects of lock-downs and support policies on the transmission rates.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/gwp407\n\n2103\n\nMortgage Borrowing and the Boom-Bust Cycle in Consumption and Residential Investment\n\nXiaoqing Zhou\n\nAbstract: This paper studies the transmission of the major shocks in the U.S. housing market in the 2000s to consumption and residential investment. Using geographically disaggregated data, I show that residential investment is more responsive to these shocks than consumption, as measured by elasticities and the implied contributions to GDP growth. I develop a structural life-cycle model featuring multiple types of housing investment to understand the large responses of residential investment. Consistent with the microdata, the model generates lumpy debt accumulation, lumpy housing investment and a strong correlation between mortgage borrowing and housing investment at the early stage of the life cycle. In the model, households move up the property ladder by increasing their mortgage debt after they have accumulated enough home equity. Since liquidity constraints and fixed costs prevent especially young homeowners from acquiring their desired home, shocks to their borrowing capacity have a large impact on residential investment.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2103\n\n2102\n\nDry Bulk Shipping and the Evolution of Maritime Transport Costs, 1850-2020\n\nDavid S.

We first analyze a new and large dataset on dry bulk freight rates for the period from 1850 to 2020, finding that they followed a downward but undulating path with a cumulative decline of 79%. Next, we turn to understanding the drivers of booms and busts in the dry bulk shipping industry, finding that shipping demand shocks strongly dominate all others as drivers of real dry bulk freight rates in the long run. Furthermore, while shipping demand shocks have increased in importance over time, shipping supply shocks in particular have become less relevant.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2102\n\nGlobalization Institute No. 406\n\nOptimal Bailouts in Banking and Sovereign Crises (Revised February 2024)\n\nSewon Hur, César Sosa-Padilla and Zeynep Yom\n\nAbstract: We study optimal bailout policies amidst banking and sovereign crises. Our model features sovereign borrowing with limited commitment, where domestic banks hold government debt and extend credit to the private sector. Bank capital shocks can trigger banking crises, prompting the government to consider extending guarantees over bank assets. This poses a trade-off: Larger bailouts relax financial frictions and increase output, but increase fiscal needs and default risk (creating a ‘diabolic loop’). Optimal bailouts exhibit clear properties. The fraction of banking losses the bailouts cover is (i) decreasing in government debt; (ii) increasing in aggregate productivity and (iii) increasing in the severity of banking crises. Even though bailouts mitigate the adverse effects of banking crises, the economy is ex ante better off without bailouts: Having access to bailouts lowers the cost of defaults, which in turn increases the default frequency, and reduces the levels of debt, output and consumption.\n\nOriginal paper\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/gwp406r1\n\n2101\n\nHow the New Fed Municipal Bond Facility Capped Muni-Treasury Yield Spreads in the COVID-19 Recession\n\nMichael D. Bordo and John V. Duca\n\nPublished as: Bordo, Michael D. and John V. Duca (2023), \"How the New Fed Municipal Bond Facility Capped Municipal-Treasury Yield Spreads in the COVID-19 Recession,\" Journal of the Japanese and International Economies, 67: 101245. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jjie.2022.101245.\n\nAbstract: For over two centuries, the municipal bond market has been a source of systemic risk, which returned early in the COVID-19 downturn when borrowing from securities markets became costly for many private and public entities, and some found it difficult to borrow at all. Indeed, just before the Fed announced its unprecedented intervention into the municipal (muni) bond market, spreads of muni over Treasury yields rose in line with the unemployment rate and appeared headed to levels not seen since the Great Depression, when real municipal gross investment plunged 35 percent below 1929 levels. To prevent a repeat, the Fed created the Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF) to purchase newly issued, (near) investment grade state and local government bonds at normal ratings-based interest rate spreads over Treasury bonds plus a fee of 100 basis points, later reduced to 50 basis points. Despite a modest take-up, the MLF has effectively capped muni spreads at near normal levels plus the Fed fee and limited the extent to which interest rate spreads could have amplified the impact of the COVID pandemic. To establish the MLF the Fed needed Treasury indemnification against default losses. There are concerns about whether the creation of the MLF could undermine the efficiency of the bond market if the facility lasts too long and could induce moral hazard among borrowers. How the MLF will be unwound will affect these downside aspects and help answer the question whether the program’s benefits exceed its costs.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2101\n\n2020\n\n2031\n\nThe Labor Market Impact of a Pandemic: Validation and Application of a Do-It-Yourself CPS\n\nAlexander Bick and Adam Blandin\n\nAbstract: The Current Population Survey (CPS) is a central source of U.S. labor market data. We show that, for a few thousand dollars, researchers can quickly design and implement their own online survey to supplement the CPS. The survey closely follows core features of the CPS, ensuring that outcomes are conceptually compatible and allowing researchers to weight and validate results using the official CPS. Yet the survey also allows for faster data collection, added flexibility and novel questions. We show that the survey provided useful estimates of U.S. labor market aggregates several weeks ahead of the CPS during the turbulent start of the COVID-19 recession. We then assess the extent of downward nominal wage rigidity at the onset of the pandemic, finding that wage reductions were widespread, but were more common for job-switchers and recalled workers. We discuss a wide range of additional applications.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2031\n\n2030\n\nThe Role of the Prior in Estimating VAR Models with Sign Restrictions\n\nAtsushi Inoue and Lutz Kilian\n\nAbstract: Several recent studies have expressed concern that the Haar prior typically imposed in estimating sign-identified VAR models may be unintentionally informative about the implied prior for the structural impulse responses. This question is indeed important, but we show that the tools that have been used in the literature to illustrate this potential problem are invalid. Specifically, we show that it does not make sense from a Bayesian point of view to characterize the impulse response prior based on the distribution of the impulse responses conditional on the maximum likelihood estimator of the reduced-form parameters, since the prior does not, in general, depend on the data. We illustrate that this approach tends to produce highly misleading estimates of the impulse response priors. We formally derive the correct impulse response prior distribution and show that there is no evidence that typical sign-identified VAR models estimated using conventional priors tend to imply unintentionally informative priors for the impulse response vector or that the corresponding posterior is dominated by the prior. Our evidence suggests that concerns about the Haar prior for the rotation matrix have been greatly overstated and that alternative estimation methods are not required in typical applications. Finally, we demonstrate that the alternative Bayesian approach to estimating sign-identified VAR models proposed by Baumeister and Hamilton (2015) suffers from exactly the same conceptual shortcoming as the conventional approach. We illustrate that this alternative approach may imply highly economically implausible impulse response priors.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24149/wp2030\n\n2029\n\nHow New Fed Corporate Bond Programs Dampened the Financial Accelerator in the COVID-19 Recession\n\nMichael D.

In response, the Fed not only reopened its commercial paper funding facility but also announced it would purchase newly issued and seasoned bonds of corporations rated as investment grade before the COVID pandemic. A careful splicing of different unemployment rate series enables us to assess the effectiveness of recent Fed interventions in these long-term debt markets over long sample periods, spanning the Great Depression, Great Recession and COVID Recession. Findings indicate that the announcement of forthcoming corporate bond backstop facilities had helped stop risk premia from rising further than they had by late-March 2020. In doing so, these Fed"
