        "text": "LAREDO, Texas – A 32-year-old Laredo man has pleaded guilty to possession with the intent to distribute 100 grams or more of heroin, announced U.S. Attorney Alamdar S. Hamdani.\n\nThe investigation began in January when law enforcement learned Raul Garcia Jr. aka Rule was selling drugs in the Laredo area. Over the next two months, investigators continued to receive information Garcia was selling narcotics, and possibly out of his home.\n\nIn March, law enforcement obtained a warrant to search Garcia’s home. During the search, authorities located heroin packaged for street sale. A month later, law enforcement obtained a second search warrant and again found heroin. Similar to drugs recovered during the March search, they noted the heroin found in April was also packaged for street sale.\n\nAs part of his guilty plea, Garcia admitted to possessing the drugs located and seized throughout the investigation.\n\nU.S. District Judge Marina Garcia Marmolejo will impose sentencing at a later date. At that time, Garcia faces up to 40 years in federal prison and a possible $5 million maximum fine.\n\nGarcia will remain in custody pending that hearing.\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Laredo Police Department’s Narcotics Division conducted the investigation with assistance from Homeland Security Investigations and Border Patrol. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Brian Bajew and Leslie Cortez are prosecuting the case."
