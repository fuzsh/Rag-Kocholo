        "text": "I was not going to post my entire list. This is only an early draft. I do not know how to rank some of the players. I am only listing some of my issues.\n\n-- @Doni Benzema is ahead of Higuain and RVN. He might be riding on Ronaldo's coattails, but I cannot igniore the fact that he has a long career here than many players.\n\n-- @Zidane05 If I redo the list in 2021, I am sure that my ranking would be different. At this moment, I think Raul and Iker are ahead of Sergio Ramos. I have no idea next year. I firmly believe my top 3, but after that, it is still opened.\n\n-- I really do not know how to rank the old-timers. Miguel Munoz was a well-know captain and then coach for the team. Was he any good as a player?\n\n-- I know that Josep Samiter was a Barcelona's legend and one of the best pre-war player in Spain. He later helped us to win our first league title. His name, however, is not listed among \"Real Madrid Legends\" on the official website. Even Pavon listed there as well. So I put him at 52nd, which is largely influenced by his absence on the official website.\n\n-- Kapo as mentioned dropped all the way to 30th.\n\n-- Predrag Mijatović's name is often mentioned, but is he really 31st?\n\n-- I don't think Cunningham belongs to the list. He was more of a cult hero and his career was cut short. I put him there for now, but I am sure that he will be gone.\n\n-- I like Guti, but he spent his career mainly as a backup. I rate his career here better than Beckham. R9 scored some great goals in his first two seasons. Is Guti ahead of him? Figo was a starter when he played with Guti. Lucas and Solari also have some moments here, but they were not really starters. They did not make the list, but I put Guti at 41st. So is he 41st?\n\n-- Luis del Sol only spent two seasons here.\n\n-- I punished Luis Enrique. But if I made an All-Time list for Barcelona, Luis Figo would make it.\n\n-- Angel di Maria is 75, but his ranking should go down. Basically, he had one good reason here. I will put Moirentes ahead him for sure. Isco probably contributed more than a single season. Sneijder was not on my pool, but he also had a good reason, which is similar to Di Maria.\n\n-- Ozil, Robinho, etc missed the cut.\n\n-- I am very confused.\n\n1) Alfredo Di Stefano\n\n2) Cristano Ronaldo\n\n3) Paco Gento\n\n4) Iker Casillas\n\n5) Raul\n\n6) Sergio Ramos\n\n7) Zinedine Zidane\n\n8) Ference Puskas\n\n9) Emilio Butragueño\n\n10) Pirri\n\n11) Fernando Hierro\n\n12) Amancio Amaro\n\n13) Hugo Sanchez\n\n14) Fernando Redondo\n\n15) Roberto Carlos\n\n16) Manuel Sanchís Hontiyuelo\n\n17) Luka Modric\n\n18) Juanito\n\n19) Jacinto Quincoces\n\n20) José Santamaría\n\n21) Ricardo Zamora\n\n22) Santillana\n\n23) José Antonio Camacho\n\n24) Pahiño\n\n25) Michel\n\n26) Marcelo\n\n27) Francisco Buyo\n\n28) Chendo\n\n29) Miguel Munoz\n\n30) Raymond Kopa\n\n31) Predrag Mijatović\n\n32) Luis Molowny\n\n33) Hector Rial\n\n34) Santiago Bernabeu\n\n35) José María Zárraga\n\n36) Ignacio Zoco\n\n37) Rafael Gordillo\n\n38) Casemiro\n\n39) Pepe\n\n40) José Manuel Velázquez\n\n41) Guti\n\n42) Ronaldo\n\n43) Luis Figo\n\n44) Marquitos\n\n45) Ricardo Gallego\n\n46) Ramon Grosso\n\n47) Rafael Martín Vázquez\n\n48) Goyo Benito\n\n49) Vicente del Bosque\n\n50) Toni Kroos\n\n51) Xabi Alonso\n\n52) Josep Samitier\n\n53) Dani Carvajal\n\n54) Iván Zamorano\n\n55) Claude Makelele\n\n56) Michel Salgado\n\n57) Gunter Netzer\n\n58) Karim Benzema\n\n59) Gonzalo Higuaín\n\n60) David Beckham\n\n61) Ruud van Nistelrooy\n\n62) Paul Breitner\n\n63) Michael Laudrup\n\n64) Uli Stielike\n\n65) Jorge Valdano\n\n66) Davor Suker\n\n67) Arthur Johnson\n\n68) Álvaro Arbeloa\n\n69) Manuel Sanchis Martinez\n\n70) Luis del Sol\n\n71) Keylor Navas\n\n72) Miguel Ángel\n\n73) García Remón\n\n74) Domínguez\n\n75) Angel di Maria\n\n76) Fernandes Morientes\n\n77) Chus Alonso\n\n78) Raphael Varane\n\n79) Isco\n\n80) Ipiña\n\n81) Clarence Seedorf\n\n82) Bernd Schuster\n\n83) Bodo Illgner\n\n84) Félix Quesada\n\n85) Henning Jensen\n\n86) Iván Helguera\n\n87) Gareth Bale\n\n88) Juan Santisteban\n\n89) Rene Petit\n\n90) Mateos\n\n91) Steve McMananan\n\n92) Juan Monjardín\n\n93) Félix Quesada\n\n94) Joseíto\n\n95) Rafael Lesmes\n\n96) Leoncito\n\n97) Laurie Cunningham\n\n98) Isidoro San Jose\n\n99) Pedro Eugenio de Felipe\n\n100) Juan Alonso\n\nThanks for the invitation to this thread @Excape Goat.\n\nI am going to start with a list of the best teams that Real Madrid has had throughout its history in my opinion. I will not talk about teams in a specific season without periods that span several seasons (from 5 to 9).\n\n1- Di Stéfano's Real Madrid (1953-1960): clearly number one; for titles, for his style of play and for changing the history of the club forever. The first European titles (Latin and European Cups) and world (Intercontinental) titles came with this team.\n\n2- Cristiano's Real Madrid (2011-2018): the 4 Champions League in 5 seasons are the definitive endorsement for this group to occupy the second position despite having won only two leagues (but at a time when they have fought, according to my opinion, with the only team that can aspire to be named the best in history alongside Di Stéfano's Madrid, I mean of course Messi's Barcelona).\n\nAlthough the first two I think are very established in both positions from the third onwards, the thing is already quite equal:\n\n3- Real Madrid Galacticos (1996-2003): they are in third position for restoring greatness to the club by winning 3 Champions in just 5 seasons, although it is true that their game was much more irregular than that of the first two. The 1999-2000 and 2001-02 seasons are a clear example of the team disaster that appeared in the League and the invincible team that appeared in the Champions League qualifiers.\n\nHere I have quite a few doubts but I am going to qualify like this:\n\n4- Real Madrid Quinta del Buitre (1984-1990): they are not higher due to their constant setbacks in the European Cup, with having won only one for me they would already be above the \"Galacticos\". Its main endorsement is 5 consecutive leagues and 2 UEFA Cups (19 years after the last European conquest by the entity, the European Cup on that occasion) won with the probably best generation of homegrown players in the club's history, generation supported by great national and international stars such as Buyo, Gordillo, Schuster or Hugo Sánchez as well as with the last days of glory of the previous generation formed by Juanito, Camacho or Santillana.\n\n5- Real Madrid of the 60s (1960-1969): it is a spectacular decade with 8 leagues and a European Cup won, as well as another two lost finals in the top European competition. If I had been a little more precise, I should have gone to Real Madrid Ye-Ye, limiting from the year 1962 or 1963 until the end of the decade, but I was sorry to leave out the first two years (which on the other hand could have included them in the Di Stéfano's Real Madrid for a final rank from 1955-1962).\n\nOther teams that left their mark on the club would be (and focusing on the professional era which on the other hand is when the entity really begins to stand out) Real Madrid of Zamora (1931-36), which was the first to win the league, or the Real Madrid of the 70s (1973-80) that won 5 Leagues and 3 Spanish Cups but also has a small “stain” in Europe for not reaching any final (although in 1973, 1976 and 1980 the Cup semis were reached of Europe).\n\nRegarding this season, I copy here the same post that I wrote a few days ago in the thread of \"The Did you know thread. Uselss, but fascinating trivia, facts and stories\"\n\nTHE MOST DISAPPOINTING SEASON IN THE HISTORY OF REAL MADRID\n\nIn the 1982/83 season Real Madrid played 5 finals (if we count the last league match as the final) and surprisingly lost them all. The development of that season was as follows:\n\nSmall details in very specific games can determine whether a team's season is rated as excellent or as a disaster.\n\nWell, if you look at the 1982/83 season of Real Madrid you will see that the number of titles won was zero. However, if one goes into detail, one sees that he was very close to winning the five titles he opted for that year. Being Real Madrid that was a failure but it seems incredible that they did not lift any title that season. Go for it.\n\nThe first title at stake was the Spanish Super Cup. In those days the competition was played during the season in two games and not in the preseason as it happened until 2 years ago or by the Final Four system established two seasons ago. Real Madrid agreed to play the final as Spanish Cup champion and Real Sociedad as League champion. By the way, that was the first edition of the Super Cup.\n\nThe first leg was played at the Santiago Bernabéu on 13th October of 1982. The \"whites\" played at a disadvantage from the 22nd minute of the clash due to the expulsion of Juanito and despite not playing a good game they went ahead in the 44th minute through the mediation of Metgod, a goal that ultimately gave the \"madridistas\" the victory and advantage for the second leg (1-0).\n\nThe return was played in Atocha on December 28, 1982, April Fools' Day in Spain and very premonitory of the season that awaited the Chamartín team.\n\nAgain in the 22nd minute, Real Madrid is left with one less player, Juan José is sent off for giving López Ufarte a header. From that moment on, the \"whites\" locked themselves in and Real Sociedad pressed, managing to equalize the tie in the 53rd minute. In the 71st minute, the second expulsion for Real Madrid miraculously managed to reach extra time with only 9 players.\n\nAlready in extra time, in minutes 92 and 102, Real Sociedad sentenced the title and to make matters worse, Salguero scored the final 4-0 with his own goal.\n\nFirst title and first loss in extra time.\n\nChronologically the second title at stake is the League. On May 1, 1983, Real Madrid arrived as the leader of the championship and depending on itself to be champion. He has led the championship in 24 of the 33 rounds played to date and is worth a draw to be champion. Play in Valencia, a team that is practically descending since it needs to win and that a combination of results be given in other games to save the category (in addition to winning Real Madrid, favorable results should be given to Valencia CF ¡in 4 games!, and in all of them they were considered incredible as it may seem).\n\nNot only must Real Madrid lose, but Athletic Bilbao is obliged to win in Las Palmas in order to be champion (Las Palmas also plays relegation in that match).\n\nThe Basques, despite starting losing, win on the islands by 1-5 so everything depends on Real Madrid. The \"whites\" neither play well nor are they lucky. A future Real Madrid's player, Miguel Tendillo, scored 1-0 in the 39th minute, which would ultimately be final. In the second half, the \"whites\" (who are already hitting the post in the first half through a foul thrown to the crossbar by Metgod) run into the posts again on two occasions (Metgod again and Santillana) and against everything prognosis the league travels to Bilbao and Valencia is saved.\n\nSecond title lost in the last minute.\n\nThird title: The team is very affected and thus will face the final of the Cup Winner's Cup on May 11, 1983. The opportunity is magnificent to win this competition for the first time (it will never be achieved). The a priori rival is quite affordable, the semi-unknown Aberdeen trained by a then unknown and future Sir named Alex Ferguson. By the way, I haven't said it until now, but Real Madrid was trained that year by the legend of the club's legends: Don Alfredo di Stéfano.\n\nThe \"whites\" had eliminated Baia Mare, Ujpest Dosza, Inter Milan and Austria Vienna. On the contrary, the Scots had to play one more tie and eliminated Sion, Dynamo Tirana, Lech Poznan, Bayern Munich and Waterschei Gent. That is, they had already warned by eliminating Bayern that was the current runner-up in Europe (0-1 against Aston Villa the previous season).\n\nAberdeen took the lead in minute 4 but Juanito put the tables in minute 15. It rains during the game and the Scots more used to it feel more and more comfortable on the pitch.\n\nAnd we got to the extra time. And there in minute 112 Hewitt puts the final 2-1.\n\nThird title that escapes and second in extra time. The disappointment is capital, a historic opportunity to do something great in a tournament that the entity has never won has been lost.\n\nFourth title: The morale of the team must be in the ground, the two biggest titles of the year have escaped and in a completely unexpected way.\n\nDespite this, on June 4, 1983, a new opportunity was presented with the dispute of the final of the Spanish Cup. The rival is no longer Real Sociedad, Athletic Bilbao or Aberdeen, the rival is the intimate enemy, Diego Armando Maradona's FC Barcelona.\n\nCelta, Athletic Club and Real Sociedad had fallen at the hands of the FC Barcelona. Cádiz, Sevilla and Sporting de Gijón (he was the current “two runner-up” of the cup) did it at the hands of the \"whites\".\n\nIn the 32nd minute, Victor overtook Barcelona but at the restart Santillana tied the final in the 50th minute. Again the extension seemed inevitable but then in the 90th minute, Marcos Alonso gave the title to Barcelona 2-1. To make the matter more bizarre, we must be remembered that Marcos was the son of Marquitos, defender of Real Madrid of Di Stéfano and one of the few players 5 times European champion.\n\nFifth title: We continue. That season the so-called League Cup is released (a tournament of little success that only had 4 editions).\n\nWell, Real Madrid will appear again in a final, the fifth of the season (if we consider the last day of the league as the final). To reach the final they had to eliminate Real Sociedad and Real Zaragoza (on penalties after winning 5-3 in the second leg with four goals from Santillana that neutralized Zaragoza's 5-3 first leg).\n\nHis rival again, Barcelona, who had eliminated Sporting Gijón and Atlético Madrid.\n\nThe final is played in two games. On June 26 at the Santiago Bernabéu and after reaching the half-time with a 0-0 draw, FC Barcelona leads by 0-2 with goals from Carrasco and Maradona but Real Madrid quickly put the tie with goals from Del Bosque and Juanito (2- 2 was the end result).\n\nSo things will be decided in Barcelona. Real Madrid again starts the game at a disadvantage and before the first half hour they lose 2-0. The final, again, is lost and only Santillana's goal in minute 82 (2-1 definitive) gives some emotion to the final of the match, but there is nothing to do and Barcelona is proclaimed champion of the new League Cup.\n\nFor Real Madrid, an absolutely disappointing season ends in which they were about to win everything and finally nothing was gained (in subsequent interviews José Antonio Camacho, whenever he is asked about this season, comments that the squad was absolutely demoralized by what happened that year since no one could find an explanation for how the season could end without any title to put in their mouths).\n\nIn 1984 nothing was won either and it was necessary to wait until 1985 to raise a trophy again, two in this case, the first UEFA Cup and the first and only League Cup. To win the League again, we had to wait for 1986, for the Spanish Super Cup to 1988 and for the Spanish Cup to 1989."
