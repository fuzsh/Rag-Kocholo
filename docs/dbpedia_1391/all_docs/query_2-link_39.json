        "text": "The Fentanyl Crisis\n\nThousands of Washingtonians are dying from the deadly drug fentanyl. Since 2019 there has been a rapid surge in fentanyl-related deaths. Washington had the nation’s fourth-highest rise in drug overdose & poisoning deaths, mostly from fentanyl, from January 2023 to January 2024.\n\nDr Garcia, an emergency room doctor, sees at least two fentanyl overdoses per shift. He’s met far too many families who have lost loved ones to fentanyl. His own son very nearly died of fentanyl addiction. He understands, both professionally and personally, that we must take strong, immediate action. Unfortunately, the incumbent hasn’t done nearly enough in response to this crisis.\n\nIf elected to the U.S. Senate, Dr Garcia will introduce the Americans Against Fentanyl Act, which will target serious fentanyl dealers with mandatory felony charges and significant prison time, and help addicts by allowing and reprioritizing federal funding for involuntary treatment & recovery programs. Dr Garcia researched other policies that have been effective in combating both the drug trade and drug addiction, and also sought the input of advocates and former addicts.\n\nFrom July 16 to July 21, Dr Garcia led the Freedom From Fentanyl Walk which started in Central Washington and ended in Seattle. Joined by his wife, Jessica, his children, friends, public officials and advocates, he decided to do the six-day walk to bring focus to the fentanyl crisis, to honor all those who have died, and to raise hope that with the right policies we can fight and overcome this deadly illegal drug.\n\nClick here to see a fact sheet on the fentanyl crisis in Washington.\n\nINFLATION & THE HIGH COST OF LIVING\n\nInflation is hitting Washingtonians hard. Washington consistently ranks among the highest in the nation for cost of living:\n\nThird most expensive state for childcare costs\n\nFourth most expensive for groceries\n\nFifth most expensive for median home prices\n\nFifth most expensive for rent compared to wages\n\nIn the greater Seattle area, the combined cost of a mortgage and childcare takes up a staggering 92% of the median income!\n\nPeople all across Washington are struggling with the fact that their dollars are able to buy less and less. Too many people can barely afford even the basics.\n\nThis cannot go on. Dr Garcia will take a stand against the reckless federal spending that has sent our national debt to dangerous levels and is a contributing factor in inflation. He will also work for policies that promote economic productivity, in order to reduce prices and costs for consumers.\n\nClick here to see an infographic on Washington being one of the most expensive states in the nation.\n\nClick here to see an infographic on Washington’s cost of living compared to the national average.\n\nCrime\n\nRising violent crime in Washington is a top concern of voters. And for good reason: Washington is ranked the 8th most-dangerous state in the nation, according to a recent study.\n\nFBI data shows that violent crime in Washington rose by nearly 82% between 2020 & 2022. This, in contrast to the national violent crime rate, which decreased.\n\nOur leaders have failed us, exposing the people of Washington to more & more violent crime while doing virtually nothing to protect us, our children and our communities.\n\nThe incumbent has ignored our safety concerns for too long. As your next U.S. Senator, Dr Garcia will do what it takes to hold violent criminals accountable and keep our state safe.\n\nClick here for an infographic on Washington being ranked as the 8th most dangerous state.\n\nWomen’s Healthcare\n\nWomen in many parts of Washington have, for years, struggled with an OB-GYN shortage. And for years, the incumbent, Sen. Cantwell, has done nothing to stop or solve this crisis.\n\nWe must reprioritize and fund critically needed women’s healthcare in rural hospitals and small communities.\n\nAs a physician, Dr. Garcia has worked diligently to bring healthcare access to women. And he has experienced the pain and frustration as his own community, even his own hospital, struggled with losing local OB-GYN care.\n\nAs a physician and community leader, Dr Garcia fought to maintain healthcare for women, while Sen. Cantwell did nothing. As a United States Senator, he will take swift action to solve this crisis and start to bring OB-GYN care back to the communities where women & families have lost local access.\n\nAfter many years of ignoring the OB-GYN crisis, Sen. Cantwell waited until June of this year, when she’s up for re-election, to drop a bill on the issue. That’s unacceptable. How can Sen. Cantwell claim to be a champion of women’s healthcare when she’s been AWOL on a matter so critical to women and families? Dr Garcia will serve everyone, at all times — because politics should never be a factor in such an important issue as women’s healthcare.\n\nClick here for an infographic on the OB-GYN shortage in Washington.\n\nFAQs\n\nHere you’ll find answers on Dr Garcia’s positions on additional issues. If you have a question on an issue you don’t see here, please feel free to contact us at info@garciaforwa.com.\n\nAbortion\n\nDr Garcia recognizes that the majority of Washingtonians have spoken on abortion, and that they support keeping abortion legal. As an elected Senator whose duty it is to represent the will of the people, Dr Garcia would oppose bills or policies that run counter to the majority position of the people of Washington on abortion. As a physician, Dr Garcia would not vote for an abortion ban or to make abortion illegal, because he has studied the ramifications and consequences of such legislative actions increasing the morbidity and mortality of women. Banning abortion can result in doctors being unable to perform life-saving procedures.\n\nImmigration\n\nAs an immigrant who came to the United States legally with his mother and was given the opportunity to achieve the American Dream, Dr Garcia believes wholeheartedly in welcoming people via legal immigration. He would also work to deal with people who are here illegally, including children, but who are contributing to the community and obeying all other laws; while he doesn’t believe they should be immediately rewarded with citizenship for having broken immigration law, he would support reforms that allow them to be here without constantly looking over their shoulders and fearing deportation.\n\nAny immigration reforms, however, must also tackle the serious issue of illegal immigration and border security. Chaos on our borders, particularly our southern border, is causing great damage to our country and our people. Criminals, drug traffickers, human and sex traffickers, and other unvetted persons have been allowed to enter the United States. Almost all of the illegal fentanyl seized by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol is at the southern border – and who knows how much gets through undetected. This is not a Republican or a Democratic issue – it’s an American issue, a national security issue, and a public safety issue.\n\n2nd Amendment\n\nDr Garcia supports the 2nd Amendment. As someone who spent the first 11 years of his life under the communist dictatorship in Cuba, he saw firsthand how that tyrannical government banned people from owning firearms, and punished possession of guns with prison and even death. As an ER doctor who has treated victims of gun violence, he is committed to working on bipartisan solutions to gun violence. He wants children in schools to be as safe as they would be in a TSA-screened airport. He believes that Democrats and Republicans can and should work together to make our schools and our streets safer, and that it is possible to do so while still protecting Americans’ constitutional rights."
