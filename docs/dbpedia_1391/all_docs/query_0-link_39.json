        "text": "Cancer progression is a process during which mutations in various signaling pathways accumulate in the cell leading to uncontrolled growth (Kinzler and Vogelstein, 1996; Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011). Cancer progression is also influenced by tumor promoters, substances that do not mutate the DNA by themselves but nevertheless facilitate cancer development. In 1941, Berenblum and Rous found that inflammatory agents such as croton oil or turpentine could induce skin cancer when applied repeatedly to mouse or rabbit skin, but only when an initiator mutagen such as benzopyrene or anthracene had been previously painted on that patch of skin (Berenblum, 1941; Rous and Kidd, 1941). The active agent in croton oil was later purified and found to be the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), also known as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The molecular mechanism by which PMA promotes cancer is incompletely understood but involves the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) in the plasma membrane, where PMA mimics the endogenous second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG) (Nishizuka, 1984). Tumor promoters cause chronic inflammation and significantly contribute to tumorigenesis (Weinberg and Weinberg, 2007).\n\nThe canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway is a major driver of cancer and plays a crucial role in embryonic development (MacDonald et al., 2009; Nusse and Clevers, 2017). In the case of colon cancer, the great majority of tumors are initiated by mutation of the tumor suppressor Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC), which is a component of the destruction complex that normally degrades the transcriptional regulator β-catenin, leading to its accumulation in the nucleus and benign polyp formation (Kinzler and Vogelstein, 1996; Segditsas and Tomlinson, 2006). Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is also the driving force in many other cancers (Galluzzi et al., 2019). A key regulator of Wnt signaling is Glycogen Synthetase 3 (GSK3), which phosphorylates β-catenin, leading to the formation of a phosphodegron that triggers its degradation in the proteasome. Upon activation of the Wnt receptors, GSK3, together with the destruction complex, is sequestered into multivesicular bodies (MVBs), also known as the late endosomes (Taelman et al., 2010; Vinyoles et al., 2014). The translocation of GSK3 from the cytosol into MVBs/lysosomes leads to the stabilization of many other cellular proteins in addition to β-catenin, in a process designated Wnt-STOP (Wnt-Stabilization of Proteins) (Acebron et al., 2014; Albrecht et al., 2021).\n\nThe many GSK3 phosphorylation targets stabilized by Wnt signaling include regulators of macropinocytosis such as Ras, Rac1, and Pak1 (Taelman et al., 2010; Albrecht et al., 2020; Jeong et al., 2012). A recent advance was the realization that Wnt signaling requires macropinocytosis (i.e., cell drinking) in order to traffic activated Wnt receptors and GSK3 to MVBs and lysosomes (Redelman-Sidi et al., 2018; Tejeda-Muñoz et al., 2019). Wnt-induced macropinocytosis also causes the internalization of focal adhesions (FAs) and integrins from the cell surface into MVBs (Tejeda-Muñoz et al., 2022c). The requirement of macropinocytosis for Wnt signaling is revealed, for example, by the decrease in nuclear β-catenin when colorectal cancer (CRC) cells mutant for APC were treated with macropinocytosis inhibitors such as the derivative of the diuretic Amiloride known as 5-(N-Ethyl-N-isopropyl) Amiloride (EIPA) (Tejeda-Muñoz et al., 2019; Tejeda-Muñoz and De Robertis, 2022a; Tejeda-Muñoz and De Robertis, 2022b).\n\nMacropinocytosis is emerging in the field as a promising target for cancer treatment (Lambies and Commisso, 2022). In addition, it has been found that the macropinocytosis induced by Wnt signaling causes significant lysosome acidification and activation (Albrecht et al., 2020). There is also accumulating evidence showing that the size and number of lysosomes increase during carcinogenesis (Cardone et al., 2005; Kroemer and Jäättelä, 2005; Zhitomirsky and Assaraf, 2016). Lysosomes, previously thought to be the garbage disposal of the cell, have emerged as central organelles in cancer (Kirkegaard and Jäättelä, 2009; Kirkegaard and Jäättelä, 2009).\n\nFrom the considerations above, investigating the intersection of Wnt signaling, macropinocytosis, lysosomes, FAs, and membrane trafficking, is of great interest. While in most cells macropinocytosis requires stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) (Haigler et al., 1979; Yoshida et al., 2018), Ras (Bar-Sagi and Feramisco, 1986; Commisso et al., 2013), or Wnt (Redelman-Sidi et al., 2018; Tejeda-Muñoz et al., 2019), some cells, such as amoebae and macrophages, have constitutive macropinocytosis. Importantly, Swanson discovered that the phorbol ester PMA stimulated macropinocytosis even in macrophages that were thought to have fully activated constitutive macropinocytosis (Swanson, 1989).\n\nIn the present study, we asked whether phorbol ester could interact with canonical Wnt signaling. Using the Xenopus embryo, which provides a premier model system to analyze the Wnt pathway, we found that PMA, which lacked any effects on its own, greatly sensitized the embryo to dorsalization by Wnt signaling, leading to the formation of radial head structures lacking trunks. The dorsalizing effect of PMA on embryos was blocked by the macropinocytosis inhibitor EIPA, the lysosomal V-ATPase inhibitor Bafilomycin A (Baf), or the Rac1 inhibitor EHT1864. Rac1 is an upstream regulator of the p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) required for actin-mediated macropinocytosis. Lysosomal activity was specifically required at the 32-cell stage for the activity of the Wnt-mimicking GSK3 inhibitor Lithium Chloride (LiCl). Ectopic axes induced by dominant- negative GSK3 (DN-GSK3-β) or β-catenin mRNAs were blocked by EIPA or dominant-negative Rab7, indicating a widespread requirement of membrane trafficking for Wnt signaling."
