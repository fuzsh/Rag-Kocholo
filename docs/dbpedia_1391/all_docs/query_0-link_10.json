        "text": "The Latin Recording Academy presented its first Best New Artist Showcase of the year, featuring previous Best New Artist Latin GRAMMY winners Joaquina and Kany García, who is also a five-time Latin GRAMMY winner. The event took place at the Museo de Arte de San Juan in Puerto Rico on June 13.\n\nAt just 19, Joaquina has quickly become one of Latin pop’s most exciting rising stars and won the Latin GRAMMY for Best New Artist in 2023. Joaquina’s debut EP, Los Mejores Años — for which she received a second Latin GRAMMY nomination for Best Singer-Songwriter Album — demonstrated her special knack for capturing the nuances of teenage angst in a way that was equally catchy and poetic.\n\nWinner of five Latin GRAMMYs — including one in the Best New Artist category in 2008 — Puerto Rican singer/songwriter Kany García has written and performed some of Latin pop's biggest hits, including \"Hoy Ya Me Voy,\" \"Alguien,\" \"Duele Menos,\" and \"Para Siempre.\" She often uses her voice to tell stories of women through her lyrics, and she was honored as a Leading Lady of Entertainment by The Latin Recording Academy in 2022.\n\n\"Taking the Best New Artist Showcase series to Puerto Rico for the first time, alongside Joaquina and Kany García, is an exciting opportunity to continue celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Latin GRAMMY Awards,\" said Manuel Abud, CEO, The Latin Recording Academy. \"The support of our Presenting Partner Mastercard, and Official Sponsor Rums of Puerto Rico, enables us to continue delivering on our mission to foster the next generation of Latin music makers.\"\n\nThe Best New Artist Showcase series is the centerpiece of the partnership between Mastercard and The Latin Recording Academy. The concept kicked off in November 2022 during Latin GRAMMY Week, and showcases have since been held in Mexico City, Sao Paulo, and Seville.\n\n\"At Mastercard, we understand that music is more than just a sound; it's a passion that unites us all. We are excited to partner with the Latin Recording Academy to continue to connect our cardholders with their passions and create unforgettable experiences for them and their families,” said Pablo Cuarón, Country Manager for Puerto Rico at Mastercard.\n\nThe next Best New Artist Showcase will take place later this year. Stay tuned here for more details coming soon.\n\nRums of Puerto Rico was an official sponsor of the Best New Artist Showcase for the first time and provided rum-inspired cocktails from their portfolio for all attendees.\n\nSee photos from the event below:\n\nIn celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Latin GRAMMYs, the Latin Recording Academy has announced a series of exhibits for 2024 at the Paley Museum in New York City, the GRAMMY Museum in Los Angeles, and the Gary Nader Art Centre in Miami.\n\n\"For 25 years we have had the immense privilege of celebrating excellence in Latin music, accompanying our music creators in their successes worldwide. These exhibits are a magnificent opportunity to bring the magic of the Latin GRAMMYs to the public,\" said Manuel Abud, CEO of the Latin Recording Academy. \"We invite all music lovers to join us in New York City, Los Angeles and Miami to enjoy these exhibits, which are filled with unforgettable moments and important achievements that have marked our history.\"\n\nThe 2024 Latin GRAMMYs, officially known as the 25th Annual Latin GRAMMY Awards, will air live from the Kaseya Center in Miami on Thursday, Nov. 14. The three-hour telecast, produced by TelevisaUnivision, the world's leading Spanish-language media and content company, will broadcast live on Univision, Galavisión, and ViX on Thursday Nov. 14, beginning at 8 p.m. ET/PT (7 p.m. CT), with a one-hour pre-show starting at 7 p.m. ET/PT. This year’s nominees will be announced on Tuesday, Sept. 17.\n\nThis year, the Latin GRAMMYs will debut a new Field and two new Categories: Best Latin Electronic Music Performance, housed within the new Electronic Music Field, and Best Contemporary Mexican Music Album (Regional-Mexican Field). Ahead of the 2024 Latin GRAMMYs, the Latin Recording Academy will host the official Latin GRAMMY Week 2024, which includes multiple events throughout Miami-Dade County including the 2024 Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year gala, which this year honors 18-time Latin GRAMMY winner and two-time GRAMMY winner Carlos Vives.\n\nLearn more about the new Latin Recording Academy exhibits taking place in New York City, Los Angeles and Miami below:\n\nThe Paley Museum, New York City\n\nSept. 13 - Nov. 3\n\nThe Latin GRAMMYs kick-off exhibit at the Paley Museum showcases the remarkable 25-year history of Latin music, celebrating the vibrant cultural tapestry that has shaped the awards show into a global phenomenon. Visitors can explore priceless artifacts, glamorous costumes, and iconic instruments from music superstars like Ricky Martin, Rosalía, Carlos Santana, and Shakira — all Latin GRAMMY and GRAMMY winners — as well as celebrated New Yorkers such as Celia Cruz and Rúben Blades, whose influence has left an indelible mark on the music world. The exhibit will highlight some of the most unforgettable moments from the Latin GRAMMY Awards telecast, trace the show’s incredible evolution, and demonstrate why Latin music has become an essential part of our culture.\n\n\"It is a tremendous honor to partner with the Latin Recording Academy and to have the privilege of hosting this historic 25th anniversary celebration of the Latin GRAMMY Awards at the Paley Center,\" said Maureen J. Reidy, President & CEO of The Paley Center for Media. \"This must-see exhibit will honor the indelible impact of Latin music and its visionary artists, whose innovative rhythms, poignant lyrics, and extraordinary contributions have redefined the global musical landscape and have had a profound impact not only on music but on entertainment and culture worldwide.\"\n\nGRAMMY Museum, Los Angeles\n\nSept. 19 - Dec. 18\n\nHosted on the 2nd floor of the GRAMMY Museum as part of its permanent Latin Music Gallery, this exhibit will enhance the museum's extensive Latin aisle by featuring artifacts from global Latin superstars like Shakira, Carlos Santana, Karol G, and Rosalía, among others. The exhibit will explore the last 25 years of Latin GRAMMY history and the diverse musical genres and cultures that have graced its stage.\n\nAt its core, the exhibit underscores how Latin music has evolved into a powerful commercial force in the international music landscape over the past quarter-century, with the Latin GRAMMYs playing a pivotal role in its global rise. The exhibit will also explore the history of the institution and its most significant moments, highlighting Latin music's creative complexity and enduring cultural impact.\n\n\"The Latin GRAMMYs have undeniably established themselves as a cultural landmark and a powerful influence in global music over the past 25 years,\" said Michael Sticka, President and CEO of the GRAMMY Museum. \"This fall, we eagerly anticipate commemorating more than two decades of musical excellence, memorable highlights, and extraordinary moments from the Latin GRAMMYs at the GRAMMY Museum.\"\n\nGary Nader Art Centre, Miami\n\nSept. 26 - Dec. 20\n\nMiami will host a first-of-its-kind collection of 25 years of Latin GRAMMY official art, featuring original paintings by renowned artists including Romero Britto, Walter Goldfarb, Michael V. Rios — who also designed the cover of Carlos Santana’s multi-GRAMMY-winning album Supernatural —and Patssi Valdez, among others. From mixed media to collage, murals and oil paintings, the collection includes renowned visual artists from several countries. In addition,Brazilian muralist Aline Bispo, the official artist for the 24th Annual Latin GRAMMY Awards, will unveil a new piece to inaugurate the festivities.\n\n\"It is a profound honor to host the art exhibition commemorating the Latin GRAMMYs at our gallery in Miami. This city, with its vibrant culture and deep Latin roots, is the perfect setting to celebrate the rich heritage and artistic achievements of Latin music. We are thrilled to bring together art and music in such a dynamic fashion, highlighting the synergy between these two powerful expressions of creativity,\" said Gary Nader, founder of the Gary Nader Art Centre.\n\nOn Aug. 7, the Latin GRAMMY Cultural Foundation awarded the Sebastián Yatra Scholarship to Cuban double bass player Leo Luna Roblejo during a special ceremony in Miami.\n\nThe event — hosted by award-winning journalist Pamela Silva and sponsored by Loud And Live as part of their $1 million commitment over five years — featured performances by Yatra, a Latin GRAMMY winner and GRAMMY nominee, alongside Luna Roblejo, and additional scholarship recipients and alumni.\n\nAlso known as the Prodigy Scholarship, the Sebastián Yatra Scholarship was created 10 years ago to support music education and Latin music genres. It is sponsored annually by a Latin music icon and holds a maximum value of $250,000.

I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to their education and artistic development.\"\n\n\"Music has been my calling and my passion ever since I was a young child, and to have the opportunity to pursue my dream thanks to the support of Sebastián Yatra and the incredible Latin GRAMMY Cultural Foundation is beyond anything I could have imagined,\" said Luna Roblejo. \"I am committed to making you all proud, and I will take full advantage of this opportunity, working hard every day to make the most of this gift.\"\n\nThe Foundation also announced the recipients of its annual Gifted Tuition, Tuition Assistance, Bulova and Gibson Gives scholarships — with additional funds from First Horizon and the Arturo Sandoval Institute — that award 43 talented students from diverse backgrounds the opportunity to pursue an education at some of the most prestigious music institutions in the world.\n\nGifted Tuition Scholarship Recipients\n\nThe following three students will each receive the Gifted Tuition Scholarship, with a maximum value of $120,000, which will support the tuition costs of four years of study at the university, college or music institution of their choice, including wrap-around services provided by the Foundation.

The daughter of a popular folk duo, Albita Rodríguez was born in Havana in 1962. Noted for the fiery combustion of her vocal cords and a precise understanding of Cuban musical tradition, Albita reignited her career after she left Cuba and moved to Miami in 1993. Her breathtaking live performances at Florida nightclubs resulted in a recording contract with Emilio Estefan’s Crescent Moon label.\n\nReleased in 1995, her U.S. debut, No Se Parece A Nada, included one of her biggest hits: the brassy tropical anthem “Qué Manera de Quererte,” as well as a velvety bolero — a genre in which she also excels. A prolific songwriter, Albita built up a prodigious discography of original material, fusing the essence of son cubano with traditional trova and balada. The hostess of a highly successful television show, “La Descarga Con Albita,” she also showcased her formidable acting chops in productions of the Broadway musicals “The Mambo Kings,” “Carmen La Cubana,” and “Havana.” Albita continues actively recording new music and performing in front of enthusiastic audiences all over the world.\n\nLolita Flores (Spain)\n\nMaría Dolores González Flores was born in Madrid in 1958 and was only 17 when she released a hugely successful debut album, Amor, Amor. In 1976, her second album featured the smash “No Renunciaré,” an impossibly nostalgic balada marked by an ornate arrangement and her gritty performance. During the 1980s, Lolita became a beloved pop star throughout the Americas, and in the 1990s, she developed a parallel career as an award-winning actress and television presenter. The daughter of singers Lola Flores and Antonio González ‘El Pescaílla’ and sister of Rosario and the late Antonio Flores, Lolita found a distinctive personal approach anchored on the gorgeous texture of her vocals and an eclectic repertoire that never ceases to surprise. In 2001, the album Lola, Lolita, Lola triumphed with an irresistible cover of the Cuban standard “Sarandonga,” which her father had recorded in 1966. In later decades, Lolita expanded her palette with sophisticated albums such as 2007’s Sigue Caminando, which veered into bossa nova, jazz, and pop-rock.\n\nAlejandro Lerner (Argentina)\n\nA thoughtful singer/songwriter anchored on his impeccable keyboard technique, Alejandro Lerner is the most covered Latin artist of his generation. Born in Buenos Aires in 1957, Alejandro Federico Lerner began his career as a teenager, playing with various legends of 1970s Argentine rock. Released in 1982, his solo debut, Alejandro Lerner Y La Magia, showcased the qualities that would soon garner him millions of fans: solid musicianship, the raw honesty of his lyrics, and a natural gift for evoking delicate, nocturnal moods. Inspired by Argentina’s return to democracy, 1983’s “Todo A Pulmón” was recorded by Spanish star Miguel Ríos and became an international hit. The mutual admiration that he shared with Mexican balada icon Armando Manzanero resulted in several successful tours together. Alternating between his native Argentina and Los Angeles, Lerner collaborated with Carlos Santana on the 2002 album Shaman and toured with the guitarist. He has also worked with Carole King, Luis Miguel (on the 1996 mega-hit “Dame”), Celine Dion, Air Supply, Gino Vannelli, Paul Anka, Alan Parsons, and Barry Gibb, among many other luminaries. In 2005, he was enlisted by Disney to perform the songs in the Spanish version of Chicken Little and to compose an original song for the closing credits of the animated film. A tireless performer, Lerner is still active in the recording studio and tours sold-out venues across the Americas.\n\nLos Ángeles Azules (Mexico)\n\nFounded in the Mexico City municipality of Iztapalapa in 1976 by the siblings of the Mejía Avante family, the group released their debut album in 1982. But it was in 1996 that the orchestra became a fundamental part of Mexican cumbia with “Cómo Te Voy A Olvidar.” Noted for their openness to collaborate with artists from other genres, Los Ángeles Azules revolutionized their sound — and the Latin music business — in 2013 by teaming up with legends from the Latin alternative field: Caifanes’ Saúl Hernández, Fabulosos Cadillacs’ Vicentico, and Ximena Sariñana, to name a few. Subsequent duets with Natalia Lafourcade (the retro charm of “Nunca Es Suficiente” in 2018), Argentinian artists (the brilliant fusion of De Buenos Aires Para El Mundo in 2020), and Carlos Santana (2023’s funky single “A Todos Los Rumberos,” with Panteón Rococó) solidified the band’s reign as one of the most beloved acts in all of Latin music.\n\nDraco Rosa (Puerto Rico)\n\nThe remarkable musical career of Draco Rosa encompasses many facets — from boy band superstar to iconic rock en español pioneer and global hitmaker — all of them informed by his virtuoso vision and protean talent. Born in Long Island, New York, in 1969 to Puerto Rican parents, the Latin GRAMMY-winning singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist Robert Edward Rosa Suárez got his first taste of fame as a member of Menudo. After a brief stint with rock band Maggie’s Dream, Rosa released two fundamental albums that shaped the 1990s wave of Latin American rock: 1994’s Frío and 1996’s Vagabundo. Delving into the pop machinery with the desire to subvert any and all expectations, Rosa co-wrote “Livin’ la Vida Loca” and other pop smashes for former Menudo bandmate Ricky Martin and also produced songs for Julio Iglesias. Always invested in exploring new ground, he developed a solo career that switches effortlessly from epic alternative rock (2018’s Monte Sagrado) to soulful ambient sonics (2021’s Sound Healing 1:11). This year marked the release of Reflejos de Lo Eterno, a transcendent covers collection of Latin alternative classics.\n\nWatch: Draco Rosa Talks On Tour Backstage Must-Haves | Herbal Tea & White Sofas\n\nLulu Santos (Brazil)\n\nA prodigiously talented guitarist, singer, and composer able to infuse an ethereal sense of romance into every song he touches, Lulu Santos has spent the past five decades carving a distinguished path in Brazilian music. Born in Rio de Janeiro in 1953, Luiz Maurício Pragana dos Santos abandoned his studies in favor of the hippie movement and a music career. After founding the ambitious progressive rock outfit Vímana, Santos launched a solo career in 1982 with the album Tempos Modernos. The jangly self-titled track and the lush “De Repente Califórnia” epitomized the MPB aesthetic of the time: sunny pop-rock chords, oblique melodies, and echoes of new wave. His third LP, 1984’s Tudo Azul, established him as one of the key Brazilian rockers of the decade. Still, Santos’ tireless quest for novel forms of expression found him incorporating dance, funk, and R&B into his 1990s output. A passionate champion of fellow musicians, Santos released poignant albums revisiting the songbooks of fellow legends Roberto and Erasmo Carlos (2013) and Rita Lee (2017). He remains active in music, having recently released a new EP of remixes — Atemporal — in May 2024.\n\n2024 Trustees Award Honorees\n\nÁngel ‘Cucco’ Peña (Puerto Rico)\n\nMarc Anthony. Celia Cruz. Willie Colón. Gilberto Santa Rosa. These are just a few of the many stars whose work was enhanced by the talent of composer, producer, and orchestrator Ángel ‘Cucco’ Peña, a living legend of Puerto Rican music. Born in Santurce in 1948, Peña attended Puerto Rico’s Conservatory of Music and later sharpened his skills as a performer with tropical ensemble Orquesta Panamericana. His ability to infuse his Puerto Rican roots into every recording he touched cemented his sterling reputation as a sympathetic collaborator of other artists. In 1993, he co-produced Willie Colón’s classic LP Hecho en Puerto Rico, including the salsa anthem “Idilio.” The late 1990s were a time of fiery creativity for Peña. He produced Marc Anthony’s third album, Contra la Corriente, took over the musical direction on Gilberto Santa Rosa’s live album En Vivo Desde El Carnegie Hall, and contributed to albums by Ricky Martin (the pop blockbuster Vuelve), Chayanne and Celia Cruz. The Latin GRAMMY winner has worked extensively in film, advertising and television specials and remains an active ambassador of Latin music.\n\nChucho Rincón (Mexico)\n\nA prolific composer, producer and label executive, Latin GRAMMY winner Chucho Rincón is a pioneer of the Mexican recording industry and a guiding light within Latin music. Born in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, in 1937, Jesús ‘Chucho’ Rincón Cárdenas grew up in Michoacán and learned to play the guitar at a young age. After moving to Mexico City and taking acting and voice lessons, he became the lead vocalist for the soulful Trío Los Aguilillas in 1956. Rincón left the band in favor of a solo career and began writing songs in 1962. His charismatic presence and musical expertise facilitated a transition into a musical director with several labels. Working for Capitol, he signed many artists, including a young Joan Sebastian, whose career he would continue to shepherd decades later. In 1988, Rincón moved with his family to Spain where he became the musical director of the Orfeón label. He has produced over 300 albums by stars such as Alejandro Fernández, Chavela Vargas, and La Sonora Santanera and composed more than 200 songs, including the mega-hit “Quén Pompó.” Rincón continues producing music as part of a creative team with his son Fabián.\n\nIn fact, the star is so busy with the roll-out that, on the afternoon of our interview, he’s FaceTiming from the back of a car. The day prior, he’d filmed the music video for \"Done With You,\" the album’s next single. Now he’s headed to the airport to jet off to Paris, where he’ll be photographed front row at the LOEWE SS25 men’s runway show in between Sabrina Carpenter and Mustafa — the latter of whom is one of the few collaborators featured on God Said No.\n\nApollo’s trusted co-writer and producer, Teo Halm, is also joining the conversation from his home studio in L.A. In between amassing credits for Beyoncé (The Lion King: The Gift), Rosalía and J Balvin (the Latin GRAMMY-winning \"Con Altura\"), SZA (\"Notice Me\" and \"Open Arms\" featuring Travis Scott) and others, the 25-year-old virtuoso behind the boards had teamed up with Apollo on multiple occasions. Notably, the two collabed on \"Evergreen (You Didn’t Deserve Me At All),\" which helped Apollo score his nomination for Best New Artist at the 2023 GRAMMYs.\n\nIn the wake of that triumph, Apollo doubled down on their creative chemistry by asking Halm to executive produce God Said No. (The producer is also quick to second his pal’s magnetic mystique: \"Don't get it twisted, he's zaddy, for sure.\")\n\nApollo bares his soul like never before across the album’s 14 tracks, as he processes the bitter end of a two-year relationship with an unnamed paramour. The resulting portrait of heartbreak is a new level of emotional exposure for a singer already known for his unguarded vulnerability and naked candor. (He commissioned artist Doron Langberg to paint a revealing portrait of him for the cover of his 2023 EP Live For Me, and unapologetically included a painting of his erect penis as the back cover of the vinyl release.)\n\nOn lead single \"Spite,\" he’s pulled between longing and resentment in the wake of the break-up over a bouncing guitar riff. Second single \"Dispose of Me\" finds Apollo heartsick and feeling abandoned as he laments, \"It don’t matter if it’s 25 years, 25 months/ It don’t matter if it’s 25 days, it was real love/ We got too much history/ So don’t just dispose of me.\"\n\nElsewhere, the singer offers the stunning admission that \"I would’ve married you\" on album cut \"Life’s Unfair.\" Then, on the very next song — the bumping, braggadocious \"Against Me\" — Apollo grapples with the reality that he’s been permanently altered by the love affair while on the prowl for a rebound. \"I cannot act like I’m average/ You know that I am the baddest bitch,\" he proclaims on the opening verse, only to later admit, \"I’ve changed so much, but have you heard?/ I can’t move how I used to.\"\n\nPoetry played a surprisingly vital role in the album’s creation as well, with Apollo littering the studio with collections by \"all of the greats,\" including the likes of Ocean Vuong, Victoria Chang, Philip Larkin, Alan Ginsberg, Mary Oliver and more.\n\n\"Could you imagine making films, but never watching a film?\" the singer posits, turning his appreciation for the written art form into a metaphor about cinema. \"Imagine if I never saw [films by] the greats, the beauty of words and language, and how it's manipulated and how it flows. So I was so inspired.\"\n\nPerhaps a natural result of consuming so much poetic prose, Apollo was also led to experiment with his own writing style. While on a day trip with his parents to the Palace of Versailles, he wrote a poem that ultimately became the soaring album highlight \"Plane Trees,\" which sends the singer’s voice to new, shiver-inducing heights.\n\n\"I'd been telling Teo that I wanted to challenge myself vocally and do a power ballad,\" he says. \"But it wasn't coming and we had attempted those songs before. And I was exhausted with writing about love; I was so sick of it. I was like, Argh, I don't want to write anymore songs with this person in my mind.\"\n\nInstead, the GRAMMY nominee sat on the palace grounds with his parents, listening to his mom tell stories about her childhood spent in Mexico. He challenged himself to write about the majestic plane tree they were sitting under in order to capture the special moment.\n\nBack at the studio, Apollo’s dad asked Halm to simply \"make a beat\" and, soon enough, the singer was setting his poem to music. (Later, Mustafa’s hushed coda perfected the song’s denouement as the final piece of the puzzle.) And if Apollo’s dad is at least partially responsible for how \"Plane Trees\" turned out, his mom can take some credit for a different song on the album — that’s her voice, recorded beneath the same plane tree, on the outro of delicate closer \"Glow.\"\n\nBoth the artist and the producer ward off any lingering expectations that a happy ending will arrive by the time \"Glow\" fades to black, however. \"The music that we make walks a tightrope of balancing beauty and tragedy,\" Halm says. \"It's always got this optimism in it, but it's never just, like, one-stop shop happy. It's always got this inevitable pain that just life has.\n\n\"You know, even if maybe there wasn't peace in the end for Omar, or if that wasn't his full journey with getting through that pain, I think a lot of people are dealing with broken hearts who it really is going to help,\" the producer continues. \"I can only just hope that the music imparts leaving people with hope.\"\n\nApollo agrees that God Said No contains a \"hopeful thread,\" even if his perspective on the project remains achingly visceral. Did making the album help heal his broken heart? \"No,\" he says with a sad smile on his face. \"But it is proof of pain. And it’s a beautiful thing that is immortalized now, forever.\n\n\"One day, I can look back at it and be like, Wow, what a beautiful thing I experienced. But yeah, no, it didn't help me,\" he says with a laugh."
