        "text": "Atlético’s midfielders stressed before the media that the team faces every match as if it were the last.\n\nAtlético’s midfielder, Raúl García has stressed to the media after the win at the Alfonso Pérez Coliseum of the importance of earning the three points on a complicated field. \"The important thing is that the team won. This is not an easy field, it is always difficult to win here. In the second half, we could have controlled the game more to suffer less, but I don't think the team suffered. The important thing is that the team won,\" he admitted.\n\nThe Spanish international also highlighted the duel against Getafe in order to get the win and move up in the table. \"We do not think about the table. We want to concentrate on the coming games. If the League is matched it’s much better for everyone, the more teams at the top, the more competition there’ll be. We wanted the three points and add up gradually, and then we'll see how we get there,\" he said.\n\nMario Suárez spoke into the microphones of Canal+ at the conclusion of the duel against Getafe (0-1). The home-grown player stressed that the game idea of the team is non-negotiable, living the present and play every game as if it were the last. \"We continue with our philosophy. We prepare each match as if it were a final. Today we needed to win and we won. We must now think about the match at home against Córdoba. We perform business as usual, going game-by-game, and without focusing on what others are doing,\" he said.\n\nAtlético’s player also had some words for the scorer of the night, Mario Mandžukić. \"He did a great job. The more goals scored by the strikers, the more the team benefits. He is a very important player for us and we hope he continues to score goals to help the team,\" he acknowledged."
