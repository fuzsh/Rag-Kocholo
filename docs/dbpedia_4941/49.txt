Inge Morath (May 27, 1923 â€“ January 30, 2002) was an Austrian photographer.

She was born in Graz, Austria. She was sent to forced labour at the Berlin Tempelhof airport for refusing to join the Hitler Youth. During and after the war she worked first in Berlin and then Vienna as a foto assistent. In 1949 she eventually made her way to Paris and later to London, where she studied photography, and later joined the legendary Magnum Photos agency.

While photographing the making of "The Unforgiven" in 1960, she accompanied its director, John Huston, and his friends hunting ducks. Up the river, she noticed its star, Audie Murphy, in the water, having fallen out of his boat. She stripped to her underwear, reached Murphy, who was in the last stages of exhaustion, and hauled him ashore by her bra strap as the hunt continued uninterrupted.

Morath was on the Magnum team recording the making of The Misfits on location near Reno, Nevada. There, she met playwright Arthur Miller, who had initially written the film for his then-current wife, Marilyn Monroe. They married on February 17, 1962; Miller's friends agreed Inge was the first grown-up he had married. That September, their daughter Rebecca was born. According to Miller biographer Martin Gottfried, they later had a son, Daniel, who was born with Down Syndrome. Miller put Daniel in an institution in Roxbury, Connecticut. Morath visited him regularly, but Miller never did.

Morath died of cancer in New York City. Rebecca is married to actor Daniel Day-Lewis.
