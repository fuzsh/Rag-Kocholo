She will receive a $5,000 production grant to support the completion of her long-term documentary project, Underland. For the first time in the award’s history, the finalist will receive a $1,000 grant in support of their project. The finalist this year is Neha Hirve.\n\nTamara Merino is a documentary photographer and visual storyteller based in Chile, whose work focuses on human and socio-cultural issues and identity, all of which intersect in her documentation of subterranean communities.\n\nPreviously a finalist of the Inge Morath Award in the years 2016 and 2019, she continues to pursue this expanding body of work. She says:\n\nUnderneath the soil and away from the chaos of modern society exist hundreds subterranean communities where people still live in cave houses around the world. Though we all inhabit the globe in different ways, we all have a strong relationship with the environment that surrounds us. Each of the communities I have documented for Underland, from Australia to Spain to the United States, have its own socio-cultural, environmental, economical, and religious reasoning that leads them to live a life underground.\n\nTamara’s project was selected from a pool of one hundred and fourteen applications by the membership of Magnum Photos at their Annual General Meeting. Given each year to a woman photographer under the age of 30, the award honors the legacy of their colleague, Inge Morath.\n\nAs this year’s finalist, Neha Hirve is being recognized for her proposal In a light that is leaving, which tells the story of radical eco-activists in Hambach Forest fighting against the power company RWE.\n\nNeha is an independent photographer based between Sweden and India. She focuses on the various relationships humans have to the earth, exploring the space between activism and action, interpretation and fact, and performance and reality.\n\nTamara and Neha’s work will be presented on Magnum Foundation’s blog in the coming months.\n\nVisual storytellers need support now more than ever, and that’s why, we’re moving forward as scheduled with accepting proposals for the Inge Morath Award, a $5,000 grant given to a woman photographer under the age of 30 to support the completion of a long-term documentary project.\n\nOne Awardee and up to two finalists are selected by a jury composed of Magnum photographers and the Executive Director and staff of the Magnum Foundation and the Inge Morath Estate.\n\nInge Morath was an Austrian-born photographer who was associated with Magnum Photos for nearly fifty years. After her death in 2002, the Inge Morath Foundation was established with a limited-term mission to manage Morath’s estate and facilitate the study and appreciation of her contribution to photography. With the closure of the research space in 2014, Inge’s archive was acquired by the Beinecke Library at Yale University, and a set of Morath’s master prints by the Yale University Art Gallery, where they are now available to scholars.\n\nBecause Morath devoted much of her enthusiasm to encouraging women photographers, her colleagues at Magnum Photos established the Inge Morath Award in her honor. The Award is administered by the Magnum Foundation as part of its mission to expand creativity and diversity in documentary photography, in cooperation with the Inge Morath Estate.\n\nPast winners of the Inge Morath Award recipients include:\n\nAlex Potter (US, 19′), for Once a Nation, Melissa Spitz (US, 18′), for You Have Nothing to Worry About, Johanna-Maria Fritz (Germany, ‘17), for Like a Bird, Daniella Zalcman (US, ‘16), for Signs of Your Identity, Danielle Villasana (US, ’15), for A Light Inside, Shannon Jensen (US, ’14), for A Long Walk; Isadora Kosofsky (US, ’12), for Selections from “TheThree” and “This Existence;” Zhe Chen (China, ’11) for Bees; Lurdes R. Basolí (Spain, ’10) for Caracas, The City of Lost Bullets and Claire Martin (Australia, ’10) for Selections from The Downtown East Side and Slab City; Emily Schiffer (US, ’09) for Cheyenne River; Kathryn Cook (US, ’08) for Memory Denied: Turkey and the Armenian Genocide; Olivia Arthur (UK, ’07) for The Middle Distance; Jessica Dimmock (US, ’06) for The Ninth Floor; Mimi Chakarova (US, ’06) for Sex Trafficking in Eastern Europe; Claudia Guadarrama (MX, ’05) for Beforethe Limit; and Ami Vitale (US, ’02), for Kashmir.\n\nIM Award Guidelines:\n\nAll submissions must be made online using the interface at Submittable.com.\n\nThe Award is given to a female photographer to complete a long-term documentary project. Proposals and accompanying material should present only the project for which the Award is being requested.\n\nAll applicants must be under the age of 30 on April 30th, 2020 (in other words, if April 30th is your birthday, and you’re turning 30, then you’re no longer eligible to submit a proposal).\n\nPresentation guidelines and image specifications are noted on the Submittable page.\n\nSubmit here:\n\nhttp://magnumfoundation.submittable.com/\n\nAll IM Award submissions must be received by April 30th, 2020.\n\nContact:\n\nFor further inquiry please contact\n\n[email protected]\n\nMagnum Foundation and Inge Morath Estate are pleased to announce Alex Potter as the recipient of this year’s Inge Morath Award, a $5,000 production grant to support the completion of a long-term documentary project.\n\nOriginally from the Midwest, Alex has been based in Yemen for several years working as an emergency nurse while pursuing her in-depth photography project, Once a Nation. She says:\n\nIn seven years, Yemen has fallen from an Arab Spring success story, a peaceful election and exchange of power, to a nearly failed state whose government is divided by tribe, geography, political affiliation, and increasingly, religion. Numerous UN-brokered deals have failed, driving the country further into crisis and famine. Having photographed in Yemen since 2012, long before other journalists rushed in to cover the war, I am uniquely equipped to tell this story.\n\nAlex’s project was selected from a pool of ninety-five applications by the membership of Magnum Photos at their Annual General Meeting. Given each year to a woman photographer under the age of 30, the award honors the legacy of their colleague, Inge Morath.\n\nThis year’s finalists are Kimberly dela Cruz, for her proposal Death of a Nation, which follows the drug war in the Philippines, launched by President Rodrigo Duterte in 2016. Tamara Merino, for her proposal Underland, documenting communities around the world living in caves and underground dwellings; and Ioanna Sakellaraki for her proposal, The Truth is in the Soil, exploring the last generation of traditional female mourners in the Mani peninsula of Greece.\n\nAlongside Alex and other selected applicants, their work will be presented on Magnum Foundation’s blog over the coming year.\n\nNanna Heitmann (Germany): Gone from the window\n\n[juicebox gallery_id=”31″]\n\nEssay will play automatically, hover over image for additional options\n\nCoal mining enabled Germany‘s participation in the industrial revolution and contributed to the German “Wirtschaftswunder after World War II; resulting in the development of today‘s key industries. That is all history. Prosper Haniel, the last remaining colliery, closed in 2018.\n\nCoal mining had once attracted countless people from all over Germany, as well as migrant workers from Turkey, Greece and Poland, all with the hope of a better life.\n\nThe elderly men are marked by decades of hard work. Broken knees, herniated discs and black lung are the typical symptoms. In the worst case, the inhaled coal dustpan lead to the malignant form of the silicosis.\n\nFortunately, the once widespread miner‘s disease has become much rarer. But this doesn’t erase the memories seeing elderly individuals, sitting by the open window, gasping for breath. If the cancer killed one of them, he was gone from the window – that‘s where the German phrase comes from.\n\nNobody will mourn the overexploitation of man and nature when the last colliery closes. But the warmth of the miners, their traditions and the very special identity of this region: this will be missed.\n\nThe families – the homes – first of all the intimacy need to be documented more. Pictures like metaphors – Freedom, Clean Air/ Space in contradiction to the claustrophobic feeling inside the mine, as softness/ gentleness in contradiction to the hardness in the mine.\n\nNanna Heitmann’s Website\n\nLilit Matevosyan (Russia): I had left my home early in the morning\n\n[juicebox gallery_id=”32″]\n\nEssay will play automatically, hover over image for additional options\n\nFor several years my study has been the history of my family: from generations that lived in the XIX century to our time. By making this project, I began to realize how a small story of one family, could be the history of millions of others. My stories will be divided into heads of key events of the family history. They had began with the territories of Turkey, where my ancestors lived and fled before the genocide and had continued on the lands of Georgia and Armenia. Personal stories are intertwined with events occurring on the territory of the post-Soviet space. One of the key chapter will be the earthquake in Armenia in 1988. My family was at the epicenter of events and witnessed the last of this tragedy. Next will be a difficult time for perestroika and our moving to Sakhalin Island, Russia – this is the era of the ‘90s. It is important for me to render again in these places, to return and to experience these events anew. This project will have completely different visual forms: from black and white photography, working with the archive, working with color and collage.\n\nFrom young age I was deeply interested in the history of my family. Living with my father, I heard stories about the place of my birth, relatives and names. They seemed to be a source of answers to my questions about family life. Anyway all that I had in the past determines what I have now. I felt that I had to find out everything, but in this case I must see it by myself.\n\nIn search of clues and answers on my 25th birthday, I went to Tbilisi – to the house where I was born. Then my adventure of the past began. Only being there I could feel the world that existed before me. The charm of something very familiar and native accompanied me after every walk around the city. The absence of external borders between people – is what I encountered in my trips through Georgia. The revelation that the family can be outside the family, behind the every house’s door.\n\nLilit Matevosyan’s Website\n\nThe Inge Morath Award, 2019 Guidelines\n\nThe Magnum Foundation and the Inge Morath Estate are pleased to announce the 18th annual Inge Morath Award, a $5,000 grant given to a female photographer under the age of 30 to support the completion of a long-term documentary project.

The Inge Morath archive was acquired by the Beinecke Library at Yale University, and a set of Morath’s master prints by the Yale University Art Gallery, where they are now available to scholars.\n\nBecause Morath devoted much of her enthusiasm to encouraging women photographers, her colleagues at Magnum Photos established the Inge Morath Award in her honor.\n\nThe Award is administered by the Magnum Foundation as part of its mission to expand creativity and diversity in documentary photography, in cooperation with the Inge Morath Estate.\n\nPast winners of the Inge Morath Award recipients include:\n\nMelissa Spitz (US, 18′), for You Have Nothing to Worry About,\n\nJohanna-Maria Fritz (Germany, ‘17), for Like a Bird, Daniella Zalcman (US, ‘16), for Signs of Your Identity, Danielle Villasana (US, ’15), for A Light Inside, Shannon Jensen (US, ’14), for A Long Walk; Isadora Kosofsky (US, ’12), for Selections from “TheThree” and “This Existence;” Zhe Chen (China, ’11) for Bees; Lurdes R.

I portrayed the house of my grandparents, in which our family has lived since 1890. Back then my great-great-great-grandfather bought the house to build his photo-studio. I combined photographs from our family photo archive and my own pictures of the house and its surroundings, as well as portraits from my grandmother, my mother and myself. The house was always given to a daughter. I was pregnant with my daughter while making the series. That is why I decided to focus on the women of my family. In this extract I concentrate especially on my grandmother Ingrid, who lives in the house with her husband. She will probably be the last owner of the house, because nobody wants to move back there.\n\nIn my series I try to show the almost never changing atmosphere of the house and the village. Generations have lived there – World War I and World War II changed their lives. Then the village in the middle of Germany became a village at the border and a central train station to the West. To visit my family in their village, people needed special permission because of the border. After 1989 the village once again was part of central Germany. Nowadays my grandparents are connected to people from the former West living in a neighbor village. These days they are singing together in the same choir.\n\nHilde Pank’s Website\n\nCitlali Fabián (Mexico): Ben’n Yalhalhj / Soy de Yalálag / I’m from Yalalag\n\n[juicebox gallery_id=”29″]\n\nEssay will play automatically, hover over image for additional options\n\nThere is always a need to feel that you belong to somewhere or a desire to feel that you are part of something bigger than your self. (At least I always had that feeling, because that is the way that my parents taught me to see the world.) I’m Citlali, a yalaltec woman born and raised outside Yalalag but always in touch with my zapotec culture.\n\nSince I began photographing I have documented yalaltec culture. I’ve collected vernacular photos of my family in an attempt to connect and better understand our identity and worldview. I’m trying to weave a net in order to talk about my ancestral zapotec history – from our family perspective. I truly think there is no lineal story, but it is really important to be able to see all angles to appreciate different points of view. In order to appreciate cultures from a meaningful place, especially native cultures, we need to have the chance to talk about ourselves and been seen from our own human stories.\n\nThe present selection of images are part of my project called Ben’n Yalhalhj which means from Zapotec Language “I’m from Yalalag”. It is a universe of images collected and sometimes intervened over the last 8 years.\n\nCitlali Fabián’s Website"
