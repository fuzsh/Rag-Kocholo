        "text": "The first woman to join the Magnum collective, photographer Inge Morath (1923-2002) forged an extraordinary career. Travelling across the globe to capture scenes of life in Spain, Iran, China and beyond, she became a purveyor of personal and universal stories.\n\nThis influential journey is highlighted in Linda Gordon’s Inge Morath: An Illustrated Biography, a book featuring black-and-white and colour images from throughout her career. As late playwright Arthur Miller notes: “She made poetry out of people and their places over half a century.”\n\nThe book is published by Prestel Publishing and Magnum Foundation.
