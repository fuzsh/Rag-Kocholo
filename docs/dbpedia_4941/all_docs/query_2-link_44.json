She will receive a $5,000 production grant to support the completion of her long-term documentary project, Underland. For the first time in the award’s history, the finalist will receive a $1,000 grant in support of their project. The finalist this year is Neha Hirve.\n\nTamara Merino is a documentary photographer and visual storyteller based in Chile, whose work focuses on human and socio-cultural issues and identity, all of which intersect in her documentation of subterranean communities.\n\nPreviously a finalist of the Inge Morath Award in the years 2016 and 2019, she continues to pursue this expanding body of work. She says:\n\nUnderneath the soil and away from the chaos of modern society exist hundreds subterranean communities where people still live in cave houses around the world. Though we all inhabit the globe in different ways, we all have a strong relationship with the environment that surrounds us. Each of the communities I have documented for Underland, from Australia to Spain to the United States, have its own socio-cultural, environmental, economical, and religious reasoning that leads them to live a life underground.\n\nTamara’s project was selected from a pool of one hundred and fourteen applications by the membership of Magnum Photos at their Annual General Meeting. Given each year to a woman photographer under the age of 30, the award honors the legacy of their colleague, Inge Morath.\n\nAs this year’s finalist, Neha Hirve is being recognized for her proposal In a light that is leaving, which tells the story of radical eco-activists in Hambach Forest fighting against the power company RWE.\n\nNeha is an independent photographer based between Sweden and India. She focuses on the various relationships humans have to the earth, exploring the space between activism and action, interpretation and fact, and performance and reality.\n\nTamara and Neha’s work will be presented on Magnum Foundation’s blog in the coming months.\n\nThe Inge Morath Award, 2020 Guidelines\n\nVisual storytellers need support now more than ever, and that’s why, we’re moving forward as scheduled with accepting proposals for the Inge Morath Award, a $5,000 grant given to a woman photographer under the age of 30 to support the completion of a long-term documentary project.\n\nOne Awardee and up to two finalists are selected by a jury composed of Magnum photographers and the Executive Director and staff of the Magnum Foundation and the Inge Morath Estate.\n\nInge Morath was an Austrian-born photographer who was associated with Magnum Photos for nearly fifty years. After her death in 2002, the Inge Morath Foundation was established with a limited-term mission to manage Morath’s estate and facilitate the study and appreciation of her contribution to photography. With the closure of the research space in 2014, Inge’s archive was acquired by the Beinecke Library at Yale University, and a set of Morath’s master prints by the Yale University Art Gallery, where they are now available to scholars.\n\nBecause Morath devoted much of her enthusiasm to encouraging women photographers, her colleagues at Magnum Photos established the Inge Morath Award in her honor. The Award is administered by the Magnum Foundation as part of its mission to expand creativity and diversity in documentary photography, in cooperation with the Inge Morath Estate.\n\nPast winners of the Inge Morath Award recipients include:\n\nAlex Potter (US, 19′), for Once a Nation, Melissa Spitz (US, 18′), for You Have Nothing to Worry About, Johanna-Maria Fritz (Germany, ‘17), for Like a Bird, Daniella Zalcman (US, ‘16), for Signs of Your Identity, Danielle Villasana (US, ’15), for A Light Inside, Shannon Jensen (US, ’14), for A Long Walk; Isadora Kosofsky (US, ’12), for Selections from “TheThree” and “This Existence;” Zhe Chen (China, ’11) for Bees; Lurdes R. Basolí (Spain, ’10) for Caracas, The City of Lost Bullets and Claire Martin (Australia, ’10) for Selections from The Downtown East Side and Slab City; Emily Schiffer (US, ’09) for Cheyenne River; Kathryn Cook (US, ’08) for Memory Denied: Turkey and the Armenian Genocide; Olivia Arthur (UK, ’07) for The Middle Distance; Jessica Dimmock (US, ’06) for The Ninth Floor; Mimi Chakarova (US, ’06) for Sex Trafficking in Eastern Europe; Claudia Guadarrama (MX, ’05) for Beforethe Limit; and Ami Vitale (US, ’02), for Kashmir.\n\nIM Award Guidelines:\n\nAll submissions must be made online using the interface at Submittable.com.\n\nThe Award is given to a female photographer to complete a long-term documentary project. Proposals and accompanying material should present only the project for which the Award is being requested.\n\nAll applicants must be under the age of 30 on April 30th, 2020 (in other words, if April 30th is your birthday, and you’re turning 30, then you’re no longer eligible to submit a proposal).\n\nPresentation guidelines and image specifications are noted on the Submittable page.\n\nSubmit here:\n\nhttp://magnumfoundation.submittable.com/\n\nAll IM Award submissions must be received by April 30th, 2020.\n\nContact:\n\nFor further inquiry please contact\n\n[email protected]\n\nAnnouncing the 2019 Inge Morath Award\n\nMagnum Foundation and Inge Morath Estate are pleased to announce Alex Potter as the recipient of this year’s Inge Morath Award, a $5,000 production grant to support the completion of a long-term documentary project.\n\nOriginally from the Midwest, Alex has been based in Yemen for several years working as an emergency nurse while pursuing her in-depth photography project, Once a Nation. She says:\n\nIn seven years, Yemen has fallen from an Arab Spring success story, a peaceful election and exchange of power, to a nearly failed state whose government is divided by tribe, geography, political affiliation, and increasingly, religion. Numerous UN-brokered deals have failed, driving the country further into crisis and famine. Having photographed in Yemen since 2012, long before other journalists rushed in to cover the war, I am uniquely equipped to tell this story.\n\nAlex’s project was selected from a pool of ninety-five applications by the membership of Magnum Photos at their Annual General Meeting. Given each year to a woman photographer under the age of 30, the award honors the legacy of their colleague, Inge Morath.\n\nThis year’s finalists are Kimberly dela Cruz, for her proposal Death of a Nation, which follows the drug war in the Philippines, launched by President Rodrigo Duterte in 2016. Tamara Merino, for her proposal Underland, documenting communities around the world living in caves and underground dwellings; and Ioanna Sakellaraki for her proposal, The Truth is in the Soil, exploring the last generation of traditional female mourners in the Mani peninsula of Greece.\n\nAlongside Alex and other selected applicants, their work will be presented on Magnum Foundation’s blog over the coming year.\n\nThe Inge Morath Award, 2019 Guidelines\n\nThe Inge Morath Award, 2019 Guidelines\n\nThe Magnum Foundation and the Inge Morath Estate are pleased to announce the 18th annual Inge Morath Award, a $5,000 grant given to a female photographer under the age of 30 to support the completion of a long-term documentary project.

With the closure of the research space in 2014, all ongoing activities of the estate were folded into the Legacy Program of the Magnum Foundation, New York.

The Inge Morath Award is a $5,000 production grant given each year to a woman photographer under the age of 30 to support the completion of a long-term documentary project. This year’s finalists are Peyton Fulford, for her proposal Infinite Tenderness and Emily Kinni, for her proposal The Bus Stop. From a pool of 98 applications from 31 countries, Melissa, Peyton, and Emily were selected by the membership of Magnum Photos at their Annual General Meeting to honor the legacy of their colleague, Inge Morath.\n\nBorn in Missouri, Melissa Spitz received her BFA from the University of Missouri and her MFA from the Savannah College of Art and Design. She was awarded by Time Magazine in 2017 as “Instagram Photographer of the Year,” and is one of the recipients of the 2016 Flash Forward Award by The Magenta Foundation. Her work has been featured by Time Magazine, VICE, The Huffington Post and Aperture Foundation.\n\nIn her proposal, Melissa Spitz writes:\n\nSince 2009, I have been making photographs of my mentally ill, substance-abusing mother. Her diagnoses change frequently–from alcoholism to dissociative identity disorder–and my relationship with her has been fraught with animosity for as long as I can remember. You Have Nothing to Worry About has acted like a mirror for my mother and she attributes seeing the photographs as her reason for seeking help with alcohol abuse. The project’s Instagram @nothing_to_worry_about has spurred a community of mothers and daughters discussing addiction and mental health in the home.\n\nPeyton Fulford’s Infinite Tenderness portrays the notion of intimacy and identity among the LGBTQ+ community in the American South. In her proposal, she writes: “I am documenting the exploration of one’s body, sexuality, and gender that comes along with growing up and identifying oneself. My intention is to empower others and create an accepting space for queer kids that grow up in small towns and rural areas.”\n\nEmily Kinni’s The Bus Stop documents recently released inmates at a bus station in the prison town of Huntsville, Texas. In her proposal, she writes: “On average there are 100 to 150 releases a day Monday through Friday. If the individual doesn’t have a family member picking them up they walk a block away to a designated Greyhound bus station and wait for their ride out of town. I have been going to this bus stop and photographing men interested in sharing their stories with me.”\n\nMelissa, Peyton and Emily’s work, in addition to that of other select applicants, will be presented in the Inge Morath Magazine over the coming year.\n\nMagnum Foundation is a non-profit organization that expands creativity and diversity in documentary photography, activating new audiences and ideas through the innovative use of images. Through grantmaking, mentoring, and creative collaborations, we partner with socially engaged imagemakers experimenting with new models for storytelling.\n\nThe Inge Morath Award, 2018 Guidelines\n\nThe Inge Morath Award, 2018 Guidelines\n\nThe Magnum Foundation and the Inge Morath Estate are pleased to announce the 17th annual Inge Morath Award, a $5,000 grant given to a female photographer under the age of 30 to support the completion of a long-term documentary project.

The Inge Morath Award is a $5,000 production grant given each year to a woman photographer under the age of 30 to support the completion of a long-term documentary project. This year’s finalist is Isadora Romero, for her proposal Amazona Warmikuna. From a pool of 122 applications from over 30 countries, Johanna-Maria and Isadora were selected by the membership of Magnum Photos at their Annual General Meeting to honor the legacy of their colleague, Inge Morath.\n\nBorn in Malsch, Germany, Johanna-Maria Fritz studied photography at Neue Schule für Fotografie. She was highlighted by Time Magazine’s list “Women in Photography: 34 Voices From Around the World,” and is one of the recipients of the 2017 Feature Shoot Emerging Photography Awards. Her work has been published in Tagesspiegel, Neues Deutschland, Fluter, Zeit-online, Vice, and Interview Magazine, and she has exhibited her work internationally.\n\nIn her proposal, Johanna-Maria writes:\n\nFor Like a bird, I travelled to Palestine, Afghanistan, and the Islamic Republic of Iran. I was especially curious about the role of women in circus life and the environment the circus is based in. Thankfully I was able to get access to the female culture in conservative societies as I am myself a woman… I direct a spectator’s view to different worlds: the one of the circus as well as the society surrounding it and how the social fabric of the circus influences the outside and in turn is influenced itself.\n\nFinalist Isadora Romero works in her home country of Ecuador. Her project Amazona Warmikuna portrays the lives of indigenous women in the Ecuadorian Amazon. Inspired by the myth of the Amazonas, from whom the region received its name, Isadora’s series is a tribute to their mystical vision of the world and their incredible strength.\n\nBoth Johanna-Maria and Isadora’s work, in addition to that of other select applicants, will be presented in the Inge Morath Magazine over the coming year.\n\n“This year’s applicants were unusually strong, almost across the board,” says Magnum Foundation Executive Director Kristen Lubben. “That so many young women under the age of 30–and from countries around the world–already have substantial and distinctive bodies of work to share is really promising for the field as a whole. Being able to support these photographers in the completion of their long-term projects is a fitting way to honor the legacy of Inge Morath, who carved a path for herself as a celebrated photographer in the wake of WWII, working against the grain of what was expected of women at the time.”\n\nMagnum Foundation is a non-profit organization that expands creativity and diversity in documentary photography, activating new audiences and ideas through the innovative use of images. Through grantmaking, mentoring, and creative collaborations, we partner with socially engaged imagemakers experimenting with new models for storytelling.\n\nThe Inge Morath Award, 2017 Guidelines\n\nThe Inge Morath Award, 2017 Guidelines\n\nThe Magnum Foundation and the Inge Morath Foundation are pleased to announce the 16th annual Inge Morath Award, a $5,000 grant given to a female photographer under the age of 30 to support the completion of a long-term documentary project.

The Inge Morath archive was acquired by the Beinecke Library at Yale University, and a set of Morath’s master prints by the Yale University Art Gallery, where they are now available to scholars.\n\nBecause Morath devoted much of her enthusiasm to encouraging women photographers, her colleagues at Magnum Photos established the Inge Morath Award in her honor.\n\nThe Award is administered by the Magnum Foundation as part of its mission to expand creativity and diversity in documentary photography, in cooperation with the Inge Morath Foundation.\n\nPast winners of the Inge Morath Award include:\n\nDaniella Zalcman (US, ‘16), for Signs of Your Identity, Danielle Villasana (US, ’15), for A Light Inside, Shannon Jensen (US, ’14), for A Long Walk; Isadora Kosofsky (US, ’12), for Selections from “TheThree” and “This Existence;” Zhe Chen (China, ’11) for Bees; Lurdes R. Basolí (Spain, ’10) for Caracas, The City of Lost Bullets and Claire Martin (Australia, ’10) for Selections from The Downtown East Side and Slab City; Emily Schiffer (US, ’09) for Cheyenne River; Kathryn Cook (US, ’08) for Memory Denied: Turkey and the Armenian Genocide; Olivia Arthur (UK, ’07) for The Middle Distance; Jessica Dimmock (US, ’06) for The Ninth Floor; Mimi Chakarova (US, ’06) for Sex Trafficking in Eastern Europe; Claudia Guadarrama (MX, ’05) for Beforethe Limit; and Ami Vitale (US, ’02), for Kashmir.\n\nIM Award Guidelines:\n\nAll submissions must be made online using the interface at Submittable.com.\n\nThe Award is given to a female photographer to complete a long-term documentary project. Proposals and accompanying material should present only the project for which the Award is being requested.\n\nAll applicants must be under the age of 30 on April 30th, 2017 (in other words, if April 30th is your birthday, and you’re turning 30, then you’re no longer eligible to submit a proposal).\n\nPresentation guidelines and image specifications are given at our Submittable.com page.\n\nSubmit here: https://ingemorath.submittable.com/submit\n\nAll IM Award submissions must be received by April 30th, 2017.\n\n2016 Inge Morath Award Announced\n\n2016 Inge Morath Award Recipient Announced\n\nWe are pleased to announce the recipient of the 2016 Inge Morath Award, Daniella Zalcman, for her project “Signs of Your Identity.” This year’s finalists are Gabriella Demczuk (US), for her proposal “Baltimore Sings the Blues” and Tamara Merino (Chile), for her proposal “Underland.”\n\nEach year, the winner of the Inge Morath Award is selected by the membership of Magnum Photos, Magnum Foundation, and the Inge Morath Foundation. The Award of $5,000 is given to a woman photographer under the age of 30 to support the completion of a long-term documentary project. This year, there were 114 applicants from around 30 different countries.\n\nKristen Lubben, Executive DIrector of the Magnum Foundation, says “Zalcman’s multiple exposure black-and-white portraits of native Canadian survivors of residential schools are layered with images that evoke the dislocation and cultural and physical violence of their shared past. We are pleased to be able to recognize Zalcman’s creative approach to addressing memory and trauma, and to support her in expanding this thoughtful and distinctive project. We join the membership of Magnum Photos and the Inge Morath Foundation in honoring Inge’s legacy through this award.”\n\nIn her successful proposal for the award, Zalcman writes that “In Canada, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, various iterations of the Indian Residential School system were created — usually church-run boarding schools meant to forcibly assimilate indigenous children into Western culture. These students were punished for speaking their native languages or observing any indigenous traditions, routinely physically and sexually assaulted, and in some extreme instances subjected to medical experimentation and sterilization. The last residential school in Canada didn’t close until 1996. The U.S. government still operates 59 Indian Boarding Schools today. A disproportionate number of residential school survivors and their immediate family struggle with PTSD, depression, and substance abuse. I create multiple exposure portraits of former students still fighting to overcome the memories of their residential school experiences. These are the echoes of trauma that remain even as the healing process begins.”\n\nArabian girls سكس and الحجاب hard porn on new موقع الكتروني afdalsex.com\n\nBorn in Washington, D.C., Daniella Zalcman studied architecture at Columbia University. She is the recipient of the 2016 Foto Evidence Book Award and a multiple grantee of the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting. Her work has been published in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Washington Post, TIME, CNN, BBC, National Geographic, and Der Spiegel, among others. She is an alumna of the Eddie Adams Workshop and is a member of the Boreal Collective. Daniella is currently based out of London and New York.\n\nGabriella Demczuk’s “Baltimore Sings the Blues” takes a closer look at the issues and changes Baltimore’s underserved communities are facing after the national attention surrounding Freddie Gray’s death.\n\nChilean photographer Tamara Merino’s project “Underland” documents a town called Coober Pedy in the middle of the Australian outback. It is home to 47 different nationalities of immigrants, ex-prisoners, and veterans of World War II who have decided to escape their past lives and take refuge in this remote and unique place.\n\nThe honored proposals by Zalcman, Demczuk, and Merino, as well as projects by selected other applicants, will be presented in IM Magazine over the coming year."
