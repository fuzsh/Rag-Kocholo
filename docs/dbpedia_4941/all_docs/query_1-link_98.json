Leanna Brodie 白仁耐 and Jovanni Sy’s 施崇梵 new play brings to life an ambitious and daring act of cultural cross-pollination: the 1983 Mandarin production of Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman in Beijing. The play, a Stratford Festival-Banff Centre co-commission, produced in association with Canada’s National Arts Centre, is directed by Jovanni Sy 施崇梵 with Chinese translations by Fang Zhang. It will be presented in English and Mandarin with surtitles in both languages."
