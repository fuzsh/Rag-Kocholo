        "text": "Arthur Miller is Born | October 17, 1915\n\nArthur Miller was born in Manhattan. He was the second son of two Polish immigrants who were pretty well off in their life.\n\nStock Market Crash | October 24, 1929\n\nThis event was devastating to the Miler family. Within two years of the crash, the family is forced to give up their business and move to Brooklyn\n\nSchool Life | 1932 - 1938\n\nArthur Miller graduates from Brooklyn's Abraham Lincoln High School and begins work in an auto-parts warehouse in order to save money for college. He also attends New York City College night classes for a few weeks, but drops out when he is unable to keep up with both school and work.\n\nMiller enrolls in the University of Michigan after having been denied admission twice before due to his poor grades in high school. Miller works as a reporter and night editor for the university newspaper, the Michigan Daily.\n\nMiller receives the Hopwood Award for his first play, No Villain, and uses the prize money to help pay tuition. A revised version entitled They Too Arise wins him a $1,250 scholarship from the Theater Guild's Bureau of New Plays the following year.\n\nMiller graduates from college and finds work writing radio plays for the Federal Theater Project in New York City. Two years later, the U.S. government cuts the Depression-era program after critics assail its leftist political leanings. An unemployed Miller accepts federal assistance.\n\nFirst Marriage | August 5, 1940\n\nMiller marries his college sweetheart, a Catholic woman named Mary Grace Slattery. Miller is unable to find a producer interested in his plays, The Half Bridge and The Golden Years. Slattery supports them both through her work as a waitress and an editor.\n\nWork | 1940 - 1943\n\nAs the United States mobilizes to fight World War II, Miller begins work as a ship fitter's helper in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, choosing to work nights in order to write during the daytime.\n\nMiller finds work as a screenwriter for a war film, The Story of G.I. Joe, and quits his job in the Navy Yard. Frustrated with his employers and their lack of acknowledgement for his work, Miller eventually quits the job.\n\nThe Man Who Had All the Luck | 1944\n\nThe Man Who Had All the Luck receives the Theater Guild National Award and opens on Broadway. Despite the award, the play bombs with the public and closes after only four performances. Disheartened with his repeated failures in New York, Miller considers quitting writing. In the same year Mary Slattery gives birth to the couple's first child, a daughter named Jane.\n\nAll My Sons | 1947\n\nMiller's play All My Sons, based on a true story about a man who sold faulty machine parts to the U.S. military during World War II, becomes an instant hit. The play wins two Tony Awards and the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award, and is rated one of the ten best plays of 1947. In the same year, Miller's son Robert is born.\n\nDeath of a Salesman | 1949\n\nDeath of a Salesman opens to huge acclaim on Broadway. The play wins the Pulitzer Prize, the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award, and the Tony.\n\nAffair with Marilyn Monroe | 1951\n\nMiller meets actress Marilyn Monroe and they have a brief affair.\n\nThe Crucible | 1953\n\nThe Crucible opens on Broadway. The play's setting in the Salem Witch Trials provides an allegory for Senator Joseph McCarthy's ongoing persecution of suspected communists, a process that disgusts Miller.\n\nA view from the Bridge | 1955\n\nMiller produces two new moderately successful plays, A Memory of Two Mondays and A view from the Bridge.A View from the Bridge is based on the same story as Elia Kazan's Oscar-winning film On the Waterfront.\n\nSecond Marriage and HUAC | June 29, 1956\n\nMiller divorces his first wife and marries Marilyn Monroe. Shortly after the marriage, Miller—who has attended party meetings, but never been a member of the Communist party—is called before the House Committee on Un-American Activities to testify. Committee chairman Francis Waters privately offers to let Miller off if he agrees to have Monroe pose with Walters for a campaign poster. Miller refuses and is questioned about his involvement with communist activities and probed for the names of other communists. Despite the pressure, Miller refuses to name names.\n\nContempt of Congress | May 31, 1957\n\nA judge finds Miller guilty of contempt of Congress for refusing to name other alleged communists during his 1956 HUAC testimony.\n\nMiller's Conviction Overturned | July 8, 1957\n\nAfter a lengthy appeals trial, a judge overturns Miller's contempt conviction.\n\nThe Misfits | 1961\n\nThe Misfits, a movie written by Miller and starring Monroe, premieres. Shortly afterward, the couple divorces. Monroe dies of a drug overdose nineteen months later.\n\nThird Marriage| February 17, 1962\n\nMiller marries Austrian-born photographer Inge Morath, whom he met on the set ofThe Misfits. In September, Morath gives birth to their daughter Rebecca.\n\nTwo New Plays | 1964\n\nMiller writes Incident at Vichy and After the Fall, two plays about the Holocaust. Critics assail After the Fall, calling it indulgent and exploitative of Marilyn Monroe's recent death. Miller denies any intentional similarity between the play's character and his former wife.\n\nPresidency of PEN | 1965\n\nMiller is elected president of PEN, an international literary organization that advocates for a free press and against censorship and oppression of writers.\n\nMiller Rejects Son | 1966\n\nMiller's son Daniel is born with Down Syndrome and his parents decide to commit him to an institution.\n\nThe Price | 1968\n\nThe Price, a play about two brothers dealing with the death of their father, premieres. Miller's own father died in 1966. The Price is Miller's last major Broadway success.\n\nMiller Revival in Britain | 1985\n\nAfter receiving lackluster reviews at its 1977 American premiere, The Archbishop's Ceiling opens to great acclaim in England and marks the beginning of a revival of Miller's work in that country. The play's themes reflect Miller's advocacy on behalf of censored writers in the Soviet bloc.\n\nMiller writes Autobiography | 1987\n\nMiller publishes his autobiography, Timebends. He also releases two plays, I Can't Remember Anything and Clara, both preoccupied with the themes of memory and remembrance.\n\nThe Ride Down Mt. Morgan | 1991\n\nMiller's The Ride Down Mt. Morgan, a distinctly political play about the Reagan years, premieres in England.\n\nBroken Glass | 1994\n\nBroken Glass, a play about the Nazis' 1938 Kristallnacht attack against civilian Jews and their property, premieres."
