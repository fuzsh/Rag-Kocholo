        "text": "Inge Morath was not a fashion photographer. But Ms. Morath, a Magnum Photos photographer, captured — and demonstrated — a rich sense of style. Her poetic and somewhat theatrical depiction of elegance is the centerpiece of a new book, “Inge Morath: On Style,” with an introduction by Justine Picardie (Abrams).\n\nMs. Morath, one of the two first female photographers with Magnum, had an eye for style — on the street and on film sets, at galas and on runways.\n\nHer foundation spent five years scanning her archive to build a rich collection of images that fall into this category. For the most part, the book features photographs she took in the early years of her career, in England, France and the United States in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nRather than clothing, the book concerns itself with “demeanor and expression of self,” John P. Jacob, the book’s editor, wrote in the afterword. “More precisely, it is concerned with the social relations of appearance.”\n\nMs. Morath, who died in 2002 at age 78, was living in Berlin when World War II broke out. Her experiences during the war influenced her own way of life.\n\n“I do think that the attitude toward beautiful things in her really came from having had nothing for a period of time,” said her daughter, the director and writer Rebecca Miller. “It’s a certain kind of appreciation of lovely things that she had that was particular to her time.”\n\nLovely things abound in this collection: rich and exuberant scenes from a ball in Vienna; a sophisticated “French” Sunday morning; models posing with well-coiffed canine companions. In Ms. Morath’s portraiture, there is drama and depth. But there are candid moments, too.\n\n“The feeling of sensual joy — just being alive — is really in those pictures,” Ms. Miller said.\n\nMs. Morath worked as a researcher for Henri Cartier-Bresson before she joined Magnum. She traveled widely throughout her career, and worked on books with her husband, the playwright Arthur Miller. She was a poetic photographer, but she had a way with language, too: She spoke seven languages in addition to her native German.\n\nMs. Miller suspects that her mother’s humanistic approach to her subjects gave her an advantage when photographing certain people. “She would just make people feel at home and soft inside, and so they were able to kind of let go,” she said.\n\nOne of those people was the designer Cristóbal Balenciaga. Ms. Morath began wearing Balenciaga after the Magnum photographer Robert Capa suggested that she begin dressing “like a lady.” A decade later, she photographed the fiercely private couturier at his home near Paris. In 1965, The New York Times Magazine reported that “the most enthusiastic of Balenciaga’s recent clients is Inge Morath (Mrs. Arthur Miller).”\n\nAlong with her Balenciaga collection, Ms. Morath owned dozens of silk shirts in different hues, gifts from “a Spanish count,” Ms. Miller said. The shirts were lost in a fire, but some of the Balenciaga pieces went to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for a 1973 retrospective on the designer.\n\nDespite her mother’s own fashion sense — and her years spent photographing those in the limelight — Ms. Morath didn’t live a notably lavish lifestyle, her daughter said. When it came to fashion, she purchased pieces that would last. “Even to the end of her life, she would buy one or two really nice things,” Ms. Miller said. “She bought Jil Sander suits in the last year.”\n\nAnd as a photographer, Ms. Miller said, her mother could “go on any mission that she was sent on and exist on a couple of apples and sleep on the floor. That wasn’t hard for her, as much as she was a very elegant woman.”"
