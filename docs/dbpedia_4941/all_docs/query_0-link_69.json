In 1972 she studied Mandarin and obtained a visa to China, making the first of many trips to the country in 1978.\n\nMorath was at ease anywhere. Some of her most important work consists of portraits, but of passers-by as well as celebrities. She was also adept at photographing places: her pictures of Boris Pasternak's home, Pushkin's library, Chekhov's house, Mao Zedong's bedroom, artists' studios, and cemetery memorials are permeated with the spirit of invisible people still present. Inge Morath died in New York City on 30 January 2002.\n\nCourtesy of Magnum Photos\n\nshow more descriptionshow less description\n\nBidding increments increase at the following intervals:\n\nBelow $400: $50\n\nBetween $400 and $699: $100\n\nBetween $700 and $1,499: $200\n\nBetween $1,500 and $2,499: $300\n\nBetween $2,500 and $4,999: $500\n\nBetween $5,000 and $9,999: $1,000\n\nBetween $10,000 and $19,999: $2,000\n\nBetween $20,000 and $29,999: $3,000\n\nBetween $30,000 and $49,999: $4,000\n\nBetween $50,000 and $99,999: $5,000\n\nAbove $100,000: $10,000\n\nYou will receive an email confirmation of your bid and when you are outbid.\n\nIf you are the winning bidder, you will be contacted 48 hours after of the close of the auction.\n\nEvery bid submitted is treated as a maximum bid.
