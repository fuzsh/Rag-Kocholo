        "text": "Death and Legacy\n\nIngeborg Morath Miller died of cancer in 2002, at the age of 78. In honor of their colleague, the members of Magnum Photos established the Inge Morath Award in 2002. The Award is administered by the Inge Morath Foundation in cooperation with the Magnum Foundation, New York.\n\nSince its inception, each year one or more exceptional young women photographers have been named as recipients of the IM Award. Recipients are selected by the members of Magnum at their annual meeting, and are granted $5,000 to support the completion of a documentary project. Virtually all IM Award recipients have gone on to achieve significant successes in the field."
