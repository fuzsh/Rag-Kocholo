        "text": "test heading\n\nTHOUGH NO STRANGER TO COMICS, Boaz Yakin is better known to the world of movies. My first introduction to him was through Fresh. One of my favorite movies.\n\nSince then, Yakin has written and directed many films with the likes of Denzel Washington, Renée Zellweger and Jason Stratham, working on blockbusters and indy pictures both.\n\nOur first collaboration was with his script for Marathon, another kind of epic—the ancient Greek kind—with art by the remarkable Joe Infurnari. Yakin took us back to the days of Eucles, the runner who saved Athens from the Persian invasion. Kirkus Reviews noted: “Marathon chronicles at once a glorious win for the underdogs and an awe-inspiring personal achievement.”\n\nWith Jerusalem, Yakin lept many centuries ahead, to Palestine in the 1940s and through the creation of the state of Israel. This 400 page family saga is a transporting experience. The artwork is by Nick Bertozzi, whom I consider to be one of the most talented American graphic novelists alive today. I remember first reading the script, mesmerized by this sprawling Jewish family inspired by Yakin’s own, at a hinge-point in history.\n\nHistory springs back to life here, but more than that—very high grade writing and artistry will immerse you in a great STORY in ways only the best graphic novels do. Do get yourself a copy of Jerusalem. You’ll treasure it.\n\nin the media:\n\nJerusalem is a NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER"
