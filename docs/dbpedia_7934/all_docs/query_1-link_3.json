        "text": "American screenwriter and film director\n\nBoaz Yakin (Hebrew: בועז יכין, born June 20, 1965)[1] is an Israeli-American screenwriter, film director, and producer based in New York City. He has written screenplays to films like The Rookie, Fresh, A Price Above Rubies, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, and Now You See Me, and has directed the 2000 sports drama Remember the Titans and the 2012 Jason Statham action film Safe. As a producer he has collaborated frequently with filmmaker Eli Roth and served as executive producer for the first two entries in the Hostel franchise.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nYakin was born in New York City. Both his parents are Israeli-born,[2][3] and met in Paris while studying miming with Marcel Marceau.[4] His father's family are of Syrian Jewish and Egyptian Jewish descent, and his mother's family is of Ashkenazi Polish Jewish descent.[5]\n\nHe attended the Bronx High School of Science, where he was classmates in 1983 with actor Jon Cryer.[3] He studied filmmaking at City College of New York then at New York University and made his first deal for a screenplay at age 19.[4]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter finishing school, Yakin worked in the film industry, developing projects for several companies, and saw his first screenplay reach the screen in 1989, when The Punisher, a vehicle for Dolph Lundgren, was released. Yakin's next screenplay was The Rookie, starring Clint Eastwood and Charlie Sheen. Wanting to take on more personal material, Yakin drew from his experiences growing up in New York's inner city for his next screenplay, Fresh. Yakin opted to direct his screenplay for Fresh himself. The film won critical acclaim, earning the Filmmaker's Trophy at the 1994 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nYakin went back to his youth for inspiration on his next project. His experience with the Chassidic community informed his screenplay for A Price Above Rubies. Yakin rebounded with his next assignment, which was his first film that he directed but did not write; Remember the Titans was a major box office success, and moved him to the upper tier of bankable Hollywood talents.\n\nHis Holocaust drama Death in Love debuted in January 2008. Yakin describes it as a movie about the failure of the family and inability to change your past.[2]\n\nHe was a member of the US Dramatic Jury at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival.[6]\n\nIn 2010, it was announced that Yakin would direct Sympathy for the Devil, with Samuel L. Jackson and Josh Duhamel in the cast.[7] The project was still in development as of 2014.\n\nYakin's family film Max was released by Warner Bros. and MGM on June 26, 2015.[8]\n\nHis 2020 film, Aviva, was set to premiere at the SXSW Film Festival, but was released publicly because of the COVID-19 pandemic.[9]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nYakin was married to Israeli music video director Alma Har'el.[10] The couple divorced in 2012.\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Director Writer Producer 1989 The Punisher No Yes No 1990 The Rookie No Yes No 1994 Fresh Yes Yes No 1998 A Price Above Rubies Yes Yes No 1999 From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money No Story No 2000 Remember the Titans Yes No No 2003 Uptown Girls Yes No Executive 2004 Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights No Yes No 2008 Death in Love Yes Yes Yes 2010 Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time No Yes No 2012 Safe Yes Yes No 2013 Now You See Me No Yes Executive 2015 Max Yes Yes Executive 2018 Boarding School Yes Yes No 2020 Aviva Yes Yes Yes 2021 The Harder They Fall No Yes No\n\nBooks\n\n[edit]\n\nMarathon, a graphic novel illustrated by Joe Infurnari, First Second, 2012\n\nJerusalem, a graphic novel illustrated by Nick Bertozzi, First Second, 2013\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
