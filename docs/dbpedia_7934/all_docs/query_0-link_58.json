        "text": "Sonia has always felt stiffled in this community and after the birth of her youngest son, she reaches a point of emotional critical mass. She tells her husband that she is unsatisfied and unfulfilled in life and she requests that they attend marital counselling. Her husband, Mendel, is not a bad sort but he is circumscribed by his Hasidic upbringing. He agrees to counselling so long as the counsellor is Hasidic. Sadly the therapy does no good for Sonia. The counsellor hints that the reason for the marital problems in her marriage is somehow her fault. Perhaps she has not carried out her relgious duties in a manner satisfactory to Heaven, he suggests. Sonia bristles at this and asks him why he is taking sides in the therapy. When the therapist insists that he is not taking sides, Sonia admonishes him, \"Yes you are. You are taking God's side.\"\n\nSonia's outrage at her community and her subserviant status in it reaches its limits one night when she is raped by Mendel's brother.\n\nUltimately Sonia leaves her Brooklyn community and travels across the River to the \"nonkosher\" island of Manhatan where she meets and becomes the lover of a Puerto Rican jeweler. After several months, Mendel comes to Manhattan to look for her. When they meet, Mendel says he is willing to forgive her if she will only return to Brooklyn and be mother to their children. Sonia refuses, saying that she has traveled too far from their Brooklyn community and the intense ultra-religious way of life that engulfs their marriage. She begs him not to force her to return. She is no longer a proper wife for him or any other religious Jewish man, she says. Mendel does not inquire about what exactly she has done to make her feel that way. He loves her and chooses to give her her freedom. Sonia knows that Mendel will have no choice now but to give her a GET, a Jewish religious divorce. Sonia weeps when she sees that he understands her pain and her desire to forge a new life for herself out in the secular world. One thing she asks, that her children will be allowed to come visit her from time to time. Mendel responds, \"How can children be kept away from their mother?\""
