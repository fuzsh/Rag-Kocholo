Michaela Paetsch will be joining the NRO on July 7th playing Mendelssohn’s Concerto in E minor for Violin & Orchestra.

In the Orchestra’s days as the “Colorado Philharmonic,” sixteen-year-old Michaela Paetsch arrived in her cowboy boots as the youngest concertmistress in the organization’s history. Over her two years with the orchestra, she performed as a soloist five times and enjoyed the camaraderie found in collaborating with her young colleagues. Her first appearance with the orchestra was in 1977, Carl Topilow’s first year as Music Director and Principal Conductor.

Ms. Paetsch had worked with Maestro Topilow around Denver, in the top positions, with the Denver Young Artists Orchestra and the Colorado All State Orchestra, alongside her siblings. She experienced success both as an orchestral player and as a soloist, including winning first prize in both the MTNA and ASTA solo violin competitions in Chicago. Performing with her family is a large part of Michaela’s life and she credits them with her continued passion and success in music. Ms. Paetsch performed the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto for the first time at the age of twelve with the Colorado Springs Symphony Orchestra.
