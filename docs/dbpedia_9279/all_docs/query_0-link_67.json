What types of stories do we find? Food safety and toy recalls, health care, the automo- tive industry, and various product glitches dominate. Indeed, quality—or lack of quality—is a vital issue in everyone’s life. That’s why this book is relevant and important for today’s students and future business leaders, as well as those already in the work- force. Understanding the principles of quality and performance excellence is absolutely essential for new graduates to succeed in today’s highly competitive business world.\n\nIt is difficult for students to learn about these principles on their own, because there are so many different approaches to the topic. Although these approaches are similar, each has its own jargon and acronyms, which makes trying to pene- trate the subject for the first time a difficult experience. Furthermore, most books about quality are not written with the needs and experiences of students in mind.\n\nThis book has three objectives:\n\n• to familiarize students with the basic principles and methods associated with total quality and performance excellence;\n\n• to show students how these principles and methods have been put into effect in a variety of organizations; and\n\n• to illustrate the relationship between basic principles and the popular theories and models studied in management courses.\n\nThe book presents the basic principles and tools associated with quality and per- formance excellence and provides many illustrations and end-of-chapter cases that can be used as the basis for class discussion. Many cases focus on large and small companies in manufacturing and service industries in North and South America, Europe, and Asia–Pacific.\n\nThis book is organized so that it can be used as a supplement to textbooks for courses in management, organization theory, organizational behavior, strategic\n\nxi\n\nCopyright 2017 Cengage Learning.

The book also can be used as a free-standing introduction to quality and performance excellence in an elective course. Students who have had the basic courses in management and organizational theory and behavior will be familiar with most of the various management theories used to place quality and performance excellence principles in perspective.\n\nCHANGES IN THE EIGHTH EDITION\n\nThis edition has made numerous changes to maintain currency of content and the student-friendly style of past editions. Discussions of the Baldrige criteria have been updated to conform with the 2015–16 criteria, and many other minor updates have been integrated throughout. New or additional boxed examples have been added, discussion questions and new experiential exercises have been added, and several new cases have been included.\n\nORGANIZATION OF THE BOOK\n\nConsiderable flexibility is built into the book to meet the individual needs of instructors. After the first two chapters, all others can be sequenced in almost any order. Unlike most books on quality, this one is organized according to traditional management topics. This organization helps students to see the parallels between quality principles and management theories in areas such as organizational design and leadership. In many traditional management books, quality is often presented as new or different, which it clearly is not.\n\nMany quality principles are based on management theories that are familiar to teachers and students. The organization of this book enables students to appreciate the ways in which quality and performance excellence really are different from those theories.\n\nThe book has four parts. Part 1, Foundations of Quality and Performance Excellence, presents the core principles of total quality and performance excellence, and begins to explain how they relate to familiar management concepts. It also positions quality thinking within general business management frameworks and strat- egy, and it introduces tools used in process management. Each chapter begins with a “Performance Excellence Profile,” highlighting a Malcolm Baldrige Award-winning organization whose practices have particular relevance to the material in that chapter.\n\nChapter 1 introduces the concepts of total quality and performance excellence and their applicability to manufacturing, services, health care, education, and not- for-profits; the evolution of quality principles; and the modern principles of total quality and its relationship with agency theory.\n\nChapter 2 describes three major frameworks for pursuing performance excellence in organizations: the Baldrige Framework for Performance Excellence, ISO 9000:2000, and Six Sigma, focusing on the value of these approaches in build- ing performance excellence and evaluating their similarities and differences. The philosophies of Deming, Juran, and Crosby serve to motivate and provide a foun- dation for these frameworks.\n\nChapter 3 introduces process management and summarizes the most important tools and techniques for designing quality goods and services and for controlling\n\nxii Preface\n\nCopyright 2017 Cengage Learning.

These include topics such as qual- ity function deployment, failure mode and effects analysis, poka-yoke, statistical thinking, and statistical process control. It also discusses the role of creativity and innovation in quality, statistical thinking, and the effective use of such tools as sta- tistical process control.\n\nChapter 4 focuses on tools for quality and process improvement, including kaizen, the Deming Cycle, Six Sigma DMAIC, lean thinking, the Seven QC Tools, benchmarking and reengineering, and creativity and innovation concepts. The chapter presents several examples of process management in action.\n\nPart 2, Performance Excellence, Strategy, and Organization Theory, introduces the importance of quality and performance excellence from a strategic perspective, the idea of customer-supplier relationships, and the role of organizational design.\n\nChapter 5 addresses the role of quality and performance excellence in organi- zational strategy for achieving competitive advantage, the value of differentiating organizations from their competitors, and approaches for doing so. It also dis- cusses quality-based strategic-planning processes and strategic work-design activi- ties. An important aspect of strategic management is the use of a “balanced scorecard” of metrics and information for data-driven decisions. This topic is also addressed.\n\nChapter 6 discusses the importance of customers and suppliers in a high- performing organization. It presents principles of customer-supplier relationships, practices for dealing with customers and suppliers, and examples of customer- supplier relationships in action and how they relate to organization theory.\n\nChapter 7 focuses on designing organizations to support a focus on perfor- mance excellence. It explains how high-performing organizations must differ from traditional functional organizations, approaches to organizational design, examples of organizations that have successfully redesigned themselves with a quality focus, and comparisons with organizational design theory.\n\nPart 3, Performance Excellence and Organizational Behavior, discusses the themes of teamwork and empowerment, and relates quality to the topics of groups and motivation.\n\nChapter 8 focuses on teamwork. It highlights the importance of teams in a high- performance environment and describes the various types of teams commonly found in such organizations, including Six Sigma project teams. It also discusses what teams must do to work effectively from an organizational viewpoint, presents some examples of teamwork in action, and compares quality-based team concepts to orga- nizational behavior theories.\n\nChapter 9 develops the important concepts of employee engagement, empow- erment, and motivation. This chapter describes the scope and benefits of employee engagement, why empowerment is important in organizations, principles for suc- cessfully introducing and sustaining engagement and empowerment, and examples of organizations that have done so successfully. Motivation is discussed in the con- text of organizational practices that support quality efforts. These concepts also are discussed in the context of popular organizational theories of motivation.\n\nPart 4, Leadership and Organizational Change, deals with practices for mak- ing performance excellence a part of today’s modern organizations, focusing on leadership and the journey to performance excellence.\n\nPreface xiii\n\nCopyright 2017 Cengage Learning.

In two acute care hospitals and a network of other facilities, PVHS offers a full spectrum of health care services, including emergency/urgent, intensive, medical/surgical, maternal/child, oncology, and orthopedic care. Founded in 1925 as the Poudre Valley Hospital (PVH) in Fort Collins, Colorado, the hospital expanded and diversified its services and has become PVHS—a regional medical hub with a service area covering 50,000 square miles. The focus areas of PVHS services include (1) Colorado’s third largest cardiac center; (2) the only Level IIIa neonatal intensive care unit between Denver and Billings, Montana; (3) Level II and III trauma centers; and (4) a bariatric surgery Center of Excellence. The system’s mission is to remain independent, while providing innovative, comprehensive care of the highest quality, and exceeding customer expectations. Its vision is to provide world-class health care.\n\nTo meet its mission and attain its vision, senior leaders have built a culture that encourages high performance and satisfaction by engaging the workforce of 4,200 staff, 550 credentialed physicians, and 800 volunteers. Communication begins with new-employee orientation and continues with an open-door policy, a variety of paths for development, and many sharing opportunities. From design of new services to bedside care, PVHS uses interdisciplinary teams to meet patient needs. For example, a trauma resuscitation team of physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, and radiology technologists is on call 24/7, and an interdisciplinary care team led by a trauma surgeon makes daily rounds to see trauma patients. These teams demonstrate “the best collaboration of nurses and doctors, relative to any trauma program in the United States,” according to a recent survey team by the American College of Surgeons (ACS).

After first establishing relationships with physicians, PVHS expanded its partner base to include entities such as home health agencies, a long-term care provider, community health organizations, and a health plan administrator—a partnership that saves local employers $5 million each year. A partnership with a community hospital in Scottsbluff, Nebraska, led to the building of a new hospital. During the planning of this facility, PVHS listened closely to its customers, which led to improved emergency room layout, private patient rooms with spectacular mountain views and windows that open, healing gardens, and installation of family amenities such as showers and kitchens.\n\nPVHS created a performance improvement system called the Global Path to Success (GPS)—a framework by which senior managers and staff integrate key processes. Using an innovative electronic Balanced Scorecard system, users can gauge progress on key measures relative to strategic objectives. If key performance measures are blue or green, PVHS is on track to accomplish the corresponding objectives. If key measures are yellow or red, an action plan— monitored by the appropriate senior manager—is developed to remedy the situation.\n\nPVHS drives innovation by designing and testing innovative systems and technologies to meet health care needs. For example, PVHS was among the first health systems in the nation to use a robotic-assisted surgery system in four medical specialty areas and among the first 24 health systems in the world to integrate medical imaging systems across service lines. The Meditech Information System is a secure, user-friendly electronic network that ensures the flow of accurate, real-time information across the organization. To promote optimal patient experiences, PVHS uses the GetWell Network—an in-room, interactive patient education program that allows patients to obtain information about their care team, access the Internet and e-mail, communicate complaints and compliments, and order on-demand movies.\n\nPVHS has received external verification of progress toward achieving its vision and goal. In 2007 and 2008, PVH was recognized as the nation’s number one hospital for sustained nursing excellence by the American Nurses Association and the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators (NDNQI). In RN hours per patient day, PVH has exceeded the NDNQI best quartile since 2005 and outperformed the American Nurses credentialing center’s “magnet” hospitals’ 90th percentile in 2008. For five consecutive years, PVH has been one of seven U.S. hospitals to be named a Thomson 100 Top Hospital (for superior outcomes, patient safety, and operational and financial performance). PVH and Medical Center of the Rockies (MCR) patient satisfaction scores surpass the national top 10 percent, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. In 2008, PVHS received the Peak Performance Award—Colorado’s highest award for performance excellence—making it the only organization to receive this honor twice.\n\n4 Part 1: Foundations of Quality and Performance Excellence\n\nCopyright 2017 Cengage Learning.

The preceding profile provides some clues: a culture focused on quality, high performance, and meeting the needs of customers and stakeholders; a planning system that supports organizational goals, provides direction for improvement, and leads to innovation and “best practices”; and a commitment to supporting, developing, and engaging the workforce. In a nutshell, these represent the central themes of this book and apply to all organizations, whether they be health care, manufacturing, service, education, or government agencies.\n\nIn this chapter, we will introduce you to the basic principles of quality and per- formance excellence. Specifically, we will:\n\n• explain the concepts of quality and performance excellence; • provide reasons why attention to these concepts should be a part of every\n\norganization’s culture and management systems; • provide a brief history of the “quality revolution”; • describe quality in manufacturing, service, health care, education, and\n\ngovernment organizations; • explain the fundamental principles and practices of quality and performance\n\nexcellence; and • discuss relationships of quality with organizational models in management\n\ntheory.\n\nQUALITY AND PERFORMANCE EXCELLENCE\n\nPeople define quality in many ways. In fact, the American Society for Quality (ASQ) Quality Improvement Glossary defines quality as “a subjective term for which each person has his or her own definition.”2 Some think of quality as supe- riority or excellence of a product or service, others view it as a lack of manufactur- ing or service defects, still others think of quality as related to product features or price. A research study by the ASQ identified the most common definitions of qual- ity used by respondents’ organizations. The top 10 were:\n\n1. Efficiently providing products and services that meet or exceed customer expectations\n\n2. Adding customer value 3. Continuously measuring the improvement of processes and services for\n\ncustomers 4. Acting as promised and reporting failures 5. Doing the right thing at the right time in the right way with the right people 6. Ensuring customers come back and products do not\n\nChapter 1: Introduction to Quality and Performance Excellence 5\n\nCopyright 2017 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Providing the best value to customers by improving everyday activities and processes\n\n8. Beyond delivering what the customer wants, anticipating what the customer will want when he or she knows the possibilities\n\n9. Delivering customer value across the organization through best-in-class products, services, and support\n\n10. Meeting and exceeding the expectations of clients, employees, and relevant constituencies in the community.3\n\nToday, most managers agree that the main reason to pursue quality is to satisfy customers. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the American Society for Quality (ASQ) define quality as “the totality of features and characteris- tics of a product or service that bears on its ability to satisfy given needs.” The view of quality as the satisfaction of customer needs is often called fitness for use. In highly competitive markets, merely satisfying customer needs will not achieve suc- cess. To beat the competition, organizations often must exceed customer expecta- tions. Thus, one of the most popular definitions of quality is meeting or exceeding customer expectations. Deer Valley Resort is one example of an organization dedi- cated to exceeding customer expectations (see box “Quality on the Slopes”).\n\nCustomer-driven quality is fundamental to high-performing organizations. The president and CEO of Fujitsu Network Transmission Systems, a U.S. subsidiary of Fujitsu, Ltd., stated, “Our customers are intelligent; they expect us to continuously evolve to meet their ever-changing needs. They can’t afford to have a thousand mediocre suppliers in today’s competitive environment. They want a few excep- tional ones.”\n\nQUALITY ON THE SLOPES4\n\nDeer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah, is viewed by many as the Ritz-Carlton of ski resorts, providing exceptional services and a superior ski vacation experience. The resort offers curbside ski valet service to take equipment from vehicles, parking lot attendants to ensure efficient parking, and a shuttle to transport guests from the lot to Snow Park Lodge. Guests walk to the slopes on heated pavers that prevent the pavement from freezing and assist in snow removal. The central gathering area by the base lifts is wide and level, allowing plenty of room to put on equipment and easy access to the lifts. At the end of the day, guests can store their skis without charge at each lodge. The resort limits the number of skiers on the mountain to reduce lines and congestion, and offers complimentary mountain tours for\n\nboth expert and intermediate skiers. Everyone is committed to ensuring that each guest has a wonderful experience, from “mountain hosts” stationed at the top of the lifts to answer questions and provide directions, to the friendly workers at the cafeterias and restaurants, whose food is consistently rated number one by ski enthusiast magazines. “Our goal is to make each guest feel like a winner,” stated the vice president and general manager. “We go the extra mile on the mountain, in our ski school, and throughout our food-service operation because we want our guests to know they come first.” It is no wonder why the resort is consistently rated one of the best in reader surveys of skiing enthusiast magazines (and the author’s favorite place to ski!).\n\n6 Part 1: Foundations of Quality and Performance Excellence\n\nCopyright 2017 Cengage Learning.

It should also be embedded in the management practices of the organization; in other words, quality should be an underlying value in how an organization is managed. If good management practices are designed and executed, then good results should follow. This leads to the concept of performance excellence–a term that refers to an integrated approach to organizational perfor- mance management that results in delivery of ever-improving value to customers and stakeholders, contributing to organizational success; improvement of overall organiza- tional effectiveness and capabilities; and learning for the organization and for people in the workforce. Performance excellence is a characteristic of today’s most outstand- ing organizations and is a requisite for providing high-quality goods and services. All organizations—large and small, manufacturing and service, profit and not- for-profit—can benefit from incorporating these principles into their organizations.\n\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF QUALITY IN ORGANIZATIONS\n\nQuality was THE buzzword among businesses—particularly manufacturing—dur- ing the 1980s and into the 1990s. Today, we generally do not hear much about quality except when things go wrong. Media releases abound with stories of medical errors that result in death, software glitches that cause products to fail, quality problems in the food supply chain, and many others. General Motors’ faulty ignition switches, which made front-page news a few years ago, resulted in at least a dozen deaths and a massive recall. Although many organizations don’t talk about quality very much, these examples show that quality remains a critical issue, not only in manufacturing, but in health- care, services, and indeed, in every organization.5\n\nH. James Harrington, one of the leading quality management consultants in the world and a columnist for Quality Digest magazine, observed that many companies today are more interested in cost reduction and efficiency than improving quality, and calls for a return to the “basics.” He advocates that firms need to create better goods and services by finding and eliminating sources of defects, and spend more effort measuring customer satisfaction as a way of assessing progress and driving further improvement. More importantly, he believes that quality must be driven down to the personal level, so that every worker can make a serious commitment to work hard and do their best every day, and take pride in their accomplishments. The attitude of “It’s good enough” is simply not good enough in today’s world.6\n\nConsumers today are intelligent enough to recognize quality—or the lack thereof—in the products and organizations they deal with (see box “Quality Is Everyone’s Concern”). The organization that fails to heed its customers is in for a rude awakening, or, at worst, a quick demise. This is why an understanding of quality is still vital to every employee in every organization. Joseph Juran, one of the most respected leaders of quality in the twentieth century, suggested that the past century would be defined by historians as the century of productivity. He also stated that the twenty-first century should be designated the century of quality. “We’ve made dependence on the quality of our technology a part of life.”7 The economic welfare and survival of businesses and nations depends on the quality of\n\nChapter 1: Introduction to Quality and Performance Excellence 7\n\nCopyright 2017 Cengage Learning.

Elevations Credit Union (ECU) has been named “Best Financial Institution” by readers of the Boulder Daily Camera for 15 of the past 16 years, and repeat- edly as “Best Bank,” “Best Mortgage Company,” or “Best Customer Service” by readers of the Colorado Daily, Boulder Weekly, Longmont Times-Call, and Loveland Reporter-Herald.\n\n2. Business satisfaction with the city of Coral Springs, Florida, rose from 76 percent to 97 percent over a four-year period. Money magazine named Coral Springs as one of the Best Places to Live. The city was named as one of the 100 best communities for young people by America’s Promise Alliance for multiple years.\n\n3. Supplier on-time delivery at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control has been essentially 100 percent since 2006, and overall supplier quality has been nearly 100 percent since 2007. Time reductions as a result of process and performance improvement programs have occurred in all lines of its businesses, yielding an estimated savings of $225 million annually.\n\n4. The overall Net Promoter (NP) scores (a loyalty metric defined by the level of repeat sales and referrals) for MEDRAD, a manufacturer of medical imaging devices, were consistently 60 percent or higher compared to the 50 percent or higher marks for other organizations nationwide. MEDRAD’s global customer satisfaction ratings using the NP system steadily increased from 50 percent to 63 percent, surpassing the best-in-class benchmark of 50 percent.\n\n5. AtlantiCare, a nonprofit health system in southeastern New Jersey, saw its system revenues grow from $280 million to $651 million over an eight-year period, reflecting an 11 percent compound annual growth rate, compared to a state average of 5.6 percent. During this time period, AtlantiCare’s medical center volume increased from about 34,000 to over 56,000 discharges—also more than twice the state average.\n\nQUALITY IS EVERYONE’S CONCERN\n\nConsumers have paid attention to quality in their purchasing decisions for some time. In a letter to the editor of Business Week (July 9 & 16, 2007, p. 16), a reader wrote: “Americans have switched from Detroit Big Three vehicles to Honda and Toyota vehicles not for visual design features but for durability, reliability, good fuel con- sumption, and low full cost of operation.\n\nDetroit needs to offer five-passenger, 35- mile-per-gallon vehicles with 100,000 mile bumper-to-bumper warranties over 10 years of ownership to cause satisfied Honda and Toyota buyers to switch.” Today, consumers don’t just write letters; they post blogs, reviews, and opinions on websites and social media for all to see.\n\n8 Part 1: Foundations of Quality and Performance Excellence\n\nCopyright 2017 Cengage Learning.

The Pewaukee School District (PSD) is the smallest K-12 educational system in Waukesha County, Wisconsin. Despite having one of the most rigorous public school graduation requirements (28 credits) in the state, PSD achieved a 97.4 per- cent graduation rate in 2012–2013 and had a higher graduation rate from 2008 through 2012 than other county, state, and nearby high-performing districts. PSD’s economically disadvantaged students surpassed the performance of similar students in the county, state, and nearby high-performing schools on the Wisconsin Knowl- edge and Concept Examinations (WKCE) reading proficiency tests by achieving 45.5 percent proficiency compared to scores below 33 percent.\n\nMany more examples like these can be cited, and considerable empirical evi- dence exists that firms implementing effective quality and performance excellence approaches improve their business results on measures of income, sales growth, cost control, and growth in employment and total assets (see box “Research Vali- dates TQ Practices”). Nevertheless, scores of companies have either failed to take the first step in a performance excellence journey, or have let initial successes fade away because of lack of commitment and sustainability.\n\nA BRIEF HISTORY\n\nTo understand the importance of quality in business today, we need to review some history. The birth of modern quality assurance methods actually began in the twelfth century B.C. in China during the Zhou Dynasty. Specific governmental departments were created and given responsibility for:\n\n• production, inventory, and product distribution of raw material (what we now call supply chain management)\n\nRESEARCH VALIDATES TQ PRACTICES9\n\nKevin Hendricks and Vinod Singhal published one of the most celebrated studies based on objective data and rigorous statistical analysis in 1997, showing that when implemented effectively, total quality management approaches improve financial performance. Using a sample of about 600 publicly traded companies that received quality awards and recognition, the researchers tracked the percent change in operating income and a variety of mea- sures that might affect operating income: percent change in sales, total assets, number of employ- ees, return on sales, and return on assets. These results were compared to a set of control firms that were similar in size to the award recipients and in the same industry. The analysis revealed significant\n\ndifferences between the sample and the control group. Specifically, the growth in operating income averaged 91 percent versus 43 percent for the control group. Award recipients also experienced a 69 percent jump in sales (compared to 32 percent for the control group), a 79 percent increase in total assets (compared to 37 percent), a 23 percent increase in the number of employees (compared to 7 percent), an 8 percent improvement in return on sales (compared to 0 percent), and a 9 percent improvement in return on assets (compared to 6 percent). Small companies actually outperformed large companies, and over a five-year period, the portfolio of award recipients beat the S&P 500 index by 34 percent.\n\nChapter 1: Introduction to Quality and Performance Excellence 9\n\nCopyright 2017 Cengage Learning.

The system even included an independent qual- ity organization responsible for end-to-end oversight that reported directly to the highest level of government. The central government issued policies and procedures to control production across China—including production of utensils, carts, cotton, and silk—and prohibited the sale of nonconforming, inferior, and substandard products. In ancient China, inspection at various stages by the workers themselves was important in establishing responsibility for quality. When a product was found to be nonconforming, the responsible worker was identified and the causes for the failure evaluated.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, skilled craftspeople served both as manufacturers and inspectors, building quality into their products through their considerable pride in their workmanship. Customers expected quality, and craftspeople understood it. A few hundred years later, the Industrial Revolution changed everything. Thomas Jefferson brought Honore Le Blanc’s concept of interchangeable parts to America. Eli Whitney mistakenly believed that this idea would be easy to carry out. The gov- ernment awarded him a contract in 1798 to supply 10,000 muskets in two years. He designed special machine tools and trained unskilled workmen to make parts accord- ing to a standard design, measure them, and compare them to a model. Unfortu- nately, Whitney grossly underestimated the effect of variation in the production process and its impact on quality. It took more than 10 years to complete the proj- ect, perhaps the first example of cost-overrun in government contracts! This same obstacle—variation—continues to plague managers to this day.\n\nFrederick W. Taylor’s concept of “scientific management” greatly influenced the nature of quality in manufacturing organizations. By focusing on production efficiency and decomposing jobs into small work tasks, the modern assembly line destroyed the holistic nature of manufacturing. To ensure that products were man- ufactured correctly, independent “quality control” departments assumed the tasks of inspection. Thus, the separation of good from bad product became the chief means of ensuring quality.\n\nHENRY FORD’S CONTRIBUTION TO QUALITY\n\nOne of the leaders of the second Industrial Revolution, Henry Ford, Sr., developed many of the fundamentals of what we now call “total quality practices” in the early 1900s. This piece of history was not discovered until Ford executives visited Japan in 1982 to study Japanese management practices. As the story goes, one Japanese executive referred repeatedly to “the book,” which the Ford people learned was\n\na Japanese translation of My Life and Work, written by Henry Ford and Samuel Crowther in 1926 (New York: Garden City Publishing Co.). “The book” had become Japan’s industrial bible and helped Ford Motor Company realize how it had strayed from its principles over the years. The Ford executives had to go to a used bookstore to find a copy when they returned to the United States.\n\n10 Part 1: Foundations of Quality and Performance Excellence\n\nCopyright 2017 Cengage Learning.

The pioneers of quality control—Walter Shewhart, Harold Dodge, George Edwards, and others—developed new theories and methods of inspection to improve and maintain quality. These pioneers coined the term quality assurance—which refers to any planned and systematic activity directed toward providing consumers with pro- ducts (goods and services) of appropriate quality, along with the confidence that pro- ducts meet consumers’ requirements—and developed many useful techniques for measuring, controlling, and improving quality. Thus, quality became a technical discipline.\n\nA related term (often used interchangeably with quality assurance) is quality control. Quality control is the evaluation of a process to determine if corrective action is needed to ensure that a requisite level of quality is achieved, often through some type of inspection or measurement activity. This term is said to have been invented at H. J. Heinz, when they were the only major foodmaker to support the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act.10 Control charts, sampling techniques, and eco- nomic analysis tools laid the foundation for modern quality assurance activity and influenced the thinking of two of their colleagues, W. Edwards Deming and Joseph M. Juran, both of whom also worked at Western Electric in the first half of the twentieth century.\n\nDeming and Juran introduced statistical quality control to Japanese workers after World War II as part of General MacArthur’s rebuilding program. Although this was not much different than what was being done in America, there was one vital difference. They convinced top Japanese managers that quality improvement would open new world markets and was necessary for the survival of their nation. The managers believed in, and fully supported, the concept of quality improve- ment. The Japanese were in an ideal position to embrace this philosophy. Their country was devastated from the war, and they had few natural resources with which to compete, except their people. During the next 20 years, while the Japanese were improving quality at an unprecedented rate, quality levels in the West remained stagnant. Western manufacturers had little need to focus on quality. America had a virtual monopoly in manufacturing, and the postwar economy was hungry for nearly any kind of consumer good. Top managers focused their efforts on marketing, production quantity, and financial performance.\n\nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s, many businesses in the United States lost significant market share to other global competitors, Japan in particular. By 1987, Business Week posed a stern warning to American management: “Quality. Remember it? American manufacturing has slumped a long way from the glory days of the 1950s and 1960s when ‘Made in U.S.A.’ proudly stood for the best that industry could turn out…. While the Japanese were developing remarkably higher standards for a whole host of products, from consumer electronics to cars and machine tools, many U.S. managers were smugly dozing at the switch. Now, aside from aerospace and agriculture, there are few markets left where the U.S. carries its own weight in interna- tional trade. For American industry, the message is simple. Get better or get beat.”11\n\nThe “quality revolution” in America can be traced to 1980, when NBC aired a documentary titled “If Japan Can … Why Can’t We?” This program introduced the 80-year-old Deming, who was virtually unknown in the United States, to corporate\n\nChapter 1: Introduction to Quality and Performance Excellence 11\n\nCopyright 2017 Cengage Learning.

FordMotor Company was among the first to invite Deming to help transform its operations. Within a few years, Ford’s earnings were the highest for any company in automotive history, despite a 7 percent drop in U.S. car and truck industry sales, higher capital spending, and increased marketing costs. In 1992, the media celebrated the fact that the Ford Taurus outsold the Honda Accord to become the leader in domestic sales. Former Ford CEO Donald Petersen stated: “The work of Dr. Deming has definitely helped change Ford’s corporate leadership…. Dr. Deming has influenced my thinking in a variety of ways. What stands out is that he helped me crystallize my ideas concerning the value of teamwork, process improvement, and the pervasive power of the concept of continuous improvement.” Ironically, by the turn of the new century, Ford’s quality had dropped to last place among American car compa- nies, demonstrating that sustaining quality efforts is indeed a difficult challenge.\n\nAmerica woke up to the importance of quality during the 1980s as most major companies embarked on extensive quality improvement campaigns. In 1984, the U.S. government designated October as National Quality Month. In 1987—some 34 years after Japan established the Deming Prize—Congress established the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (simply known as the Baldrige Award) to raise awareness of quality and recognize national role models, spawning a remarkable interest in quality among American businesses. By the end of the decade, Florida Power and Light had become the first non-Japanese company to win Japan’s coveted Deming Prize for quality. After the publicity that quality received from the manufacturing sector, the quality movement shifted to services. Companies such as FedEx and The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company demonstrated clearly that quality principles can be applied effectively in the service sector.\n\nDuring the 1990s, health care, government, and education began to pay increased attention to quality. As more public and government attention focused on the nation’s health care system, its providers turned toward quality as a means of achieving better performance and lower costs.12 One hospital, for example, low- ered its rate of postsurgical infections to less than one-fifth of the acceptable national norms through the use of quality tools. In 1993, Vice President Al Gore spearheaded the National Performance Review, an initiative driven by the need to improve quality, which made 384 recommendations and indicated 1,214 specific actions that the federal government should take to improve operations and reduce costs. In 1991, a consortium of professional associations, business associations, and individual businesses and universities incorporated a nonprofit group called the National Education Quality Initiative to improve educational processes through quality principles. Many local school systems, colleges, and universities made con- siderable progress.\n\nAlthough quality initiatives focused initially on reducing defects and errors in products and services through the use of measurement, statistics, and other problem-solving tools, organizations began to recognize that lasting improve- ment could not be accomplished without significant attention to the quality of the management practices used on a daily basis. Managers began to realize that the approaches they use to listen to customers and develop long-term relation- ships, map out strategy, measure performance and analyze data, reward and train employees, design and deliver products and services, and act as leaders in their organizations are the true enablers of quality, customer satisfaction, and\n\n12 Part 1: Foundations of Quality and Performance Excellence\n\nCopyright 2017 Cengage Learning.

In other words, they recognized that the “quality of manage- ment” is as important as the “management of quality.” Many began to use the term Big Q to contrast the difference between managing for quality in all organi- zational processes and focusing solely on manufacturing quality (Little Q). As organizations began to integrate quality principles into their management sys- tems, the notion of total quality management, or TQM, became popular. Quality took on a new meaning of organization-wide performance excellence rather than a narrow engineering- or production-based technical discipline and permeated every aspect of running an organization.\n\nToday, the term TQM has virtually disappeared from business vernacular; however, the underlying principles of quality management are recognized as the foundation of high-performance management systems and an important factor for competitive success. Perhaps it is unfortunate that a three-letter acronym was cho- sen to represent such a powerful management concept. It is equally unfortunate that people generalize the demise of faddish terminology to the concepts them- selves. Many organizations have integrated quality principles so tightly with daily work activities that they no longer view quality as something special. In contrast, many other organizations have barely begun.\n\nReasons for failure of quality initiatives are rooted in organizational approaches and systems, many of which this book addresses. As a former editor of Quality Digest put it: “No, TQM isn’t dead. TQM failures just prove that bad management is still alive and kicking.” The most successful organizations have found that the fundamental principles of total quality (TQ) are essential to effective management practice, and continue to represent a sound approach for achieving business success.\n\nAs TQM changed the way that organizations thought about customers, human resources, and manufacturing and service processes, many top executives began to recognize that all fundamental business activities—such as the role of leadership in guiding an organization, how an organization creates strategic plans for the future, how data and information are used to make business decisions, and so on—needed to be based on quality principles, work together as a system, and be continuously improved as environmental conditions and business directions change. From this perspective, the product-focused notion of quality evolved into a new concept, called performance excellence, which we defined earlier in this chapter.\n\nIn the quest to remain competitive, and after learning from the failures of TQM, a new approach to quality improvement emerged in the late 1990s, called Six Sigma. Six Sigma is a customer-focused and results-oriented approach to busi- ness improvement that integrates many traditional quality improvement tools and techniques that have been tested and validated over the years, with a bottom-line and strategic orientation that appeals to senior managers, thus gaining their sup- port. Many organizations have adopted Six Sigma as a way of revitalizing their quality efforts. Recently, Six Sigma tools have been integrated with lean tools from the Toyota production system to address not only quality problems, but other key business problems involving cost reduction and efficiency.\n\nThe real challenge today is to ensure that managers do not lose sight of the basic principles on which quality management and performance excellence are based. The global marketplace and domestic and international competition has\n\nChapter 1: Introduction to Quality and Performance Excellence 13\n\nCopyright 2017 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Spain and Brazil are encouraging the publication of quality books in their native language to make them more accessible. These trends will only increase the level of global competition. Many other factors are changing how organizations view quality (see the box “What Will Influence the Future of Quality?”). As Tom Engibous, president and chief executive officer of Texas Instruments, commented on the present and future importance of quality in 1997: “Quality will have to be every- where, integrated into all aspects of a winning organization.” This is what perfor- mance excellence is all about.\n\nWHAT WILL INFLUENCE THE FUTURE OF QUALITY?\n\nIn 2011, the American Society for Quality identified eight key forces that will influence the future of quality:14\n\n1. Global responsibility: An organization must be fully aware of the global impact of its local decisions and realize that as demand grows for the planet’s finite resources, waste is increasingly unacceptable. Global responsibility also involves human rights, labor practices, fair operating practices, consumer interests, and contributions to society. In an increasingly connected and informed world, responsible efforts are being rewarded by consumers, making it more important than ever to maintain a reputation as an organization driven by global concern.\n\n2. Consumer awareness: With today’s technology such as the Internet, Twitter, and Facebook, consumers have access to a wealth of information on which to make purchasing decisions. As a result, organiza- tions must be quick when responding to their customers’ concerns and match their products to customers’ wants and needs, or risk having their customers defect to a competitor. Many service providers maintain databases that capture customer prefer- ences, allowing them to customize the cus- tomer experience. Manufacturing\n\ntechnologies will need to provide similar levels of customization, allowing for eco- nomic order quantities of one, along with zero wait times.\n\n3. Globalization: Globalization no longer means just an opportunity for organizations to enter new markets. Today, firms have to contend with a growing number of compe- titors and sources of lower-cost labor and assume the risks associated with global supply chains.\n\n4. Increasing rate of change: Technology has shifted the rate of change into an entirely new gear, which brings with it opportunities and threats. The threat lies in the possibility that humanity won’t be able to adapt to the disruptions that accompany technological advances. But, if it can, the opportunities are nearly limitless. Product life cycles are getting shorter, and industries come into existence, thrive, and die within our lifetimes. As a result, being first to market means more now than ever before, as does the ability to anticipate and respond quickly to consumer demand.\n\n5. Workforce of the future: Competition for talent will increase, and along with technological advances, will change how and where work is done. As a result, organizations will need to become more flexible with how and where\n\n14 Part 1: Foundations of Quality and Performance Excellence\n\nCopyright 2017 Cengage Learning.

Although the details of quality management differ between manufacturing and service indus- tries, the customer-driven definition eliminates these artificial distinctions and provides a unifying perspective.\n\nQUALITY IN MANUFACTURING\n\nWell-developed quality systems have existed in manufacturing for some time. How- ever, these systems focused primarily on technical issues such as equipment reliabil- ity, inspection, defect measurement, and process control. The transition to a customer-driven organization has caused fundamental changes in manufacturing practices, changes that are particularly evident in areas such as product design, human resource management, and supplier relations. Product design activities, for example, now closely integrate marketing, engineering, and manufacturing opera- tions. Human resource practices concentrate on empowering workers to collect and analyze data, make critical operations decisions, and take responsibility for continu- ous improvements, thereby moving the responsibility for quality from the quality control department onto the factory floor. Suppliers have become partners in\n\ntheir workforces operate. Organizations will need to make a greater investment in training and education, and place a greater emphasis on professional certifications, which will evolve based on organizations’ demands for demonstrated competency from its employees.\n\n6. Aging population: As people live longer, organizations face higher costs for health care and social welfare programs. Retirement become “a short-lived artifact of the latter half of the twentieth century.” Demographers predict that by 2015, the majority of the population will be over the age of 65. The result is a growing market for organizations to consider as the aging lifestyle becomes more prevalent.\n\n7. Twenty-first century quality: Quality isn’t the same as it was 50 years ago, or even five years ago. Quality is moving beyond the organization’s walls to encompass a custo- mer’s entire experience with the organization rather than just the quality of the product or\n\nservice. With more opportunities for quality professionals to apply their skills, we may soon see quality applied to social problems, proving that “quality is exerting itself in new ways—in hopeful ways.”\n\n8. Innovation: According to the study, innovation is “the pursuit of something different and exciting.” Innovation lies at the heart of orga- nizational survival. As the study states, “If innovation means the ability of a company to anticipate customer needs—expressed or unexpressed, known or unknown—and bring products or services to the marketplace that excite customers, then clearly innovation is the fuel of growth in today’s changing world, and more so tomorrow.”\n\nThese forces will impact how organizations configure themselves, how managers plan and lead, and how all workers will perform to achieve quality. As ASQ noted, “Quality should shape society. Ultimately, quality methodology will be used to build a better world.”\n\nChapter 1: Introduction to Quality and Performance Excellence 15\n\nCopyright 2017 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Many of these efforts were stimulated by the automobile industry, which forced their network of suppliers to improve quality.\n\nManufactured products have several quality dimensions, including the following:15\n\n1. Performance: a product’s primary operating characteristics. 2. Features: the “bells and whistles” of a product. 3. Reliability: the probability of a product’s surviving over a specified period of\n\ntime under stated conditions of use. 4. Conformance: the degree to which physical and performance characteristics\n\nof a product match preestablished standards. 5. Durability: the amount of use one gets from a product before it physically\n\ndeteriorates or until replacement is preferable. 6. Serviceability: the ability to repair a product quickly and easily. 7. Aesthetics: how a product looks, feels, sounds, tastes, or smells. 8. Perceived quality: subjective assessment resulting from image, advertising, or\n\nbrand names.\n\nMost of these dimensions revolve around the design of the product. In designing the initial Lexus automobile for instance, Toyota bought several competitors’ cars— including Mercedes, Jaguar, and BMW—and put them through grueling test track runs before taking them apart.16 The chief engineer decided that he could match Mer- cedes on performance and reliability, as well as on luxury and status features. He devel- oped 11 performance goals. The final design had a drag coefficient smaller than any other luxury car (resulting in higher aerodynamic performance), a lighter weight, a more fuel-efficient engine, and a lower noise level. Sturdier materials were used for seat edges to maintain their appearance longer. The engine was designed with more torque than German models to give the car the quick start that Americans prefer. Ford’s direc- tor of North American interior design called the instrument cluster “a work of art.”\n\nQuality control in manufacturing is usually based on conformance, specifically conformance to specifications. Specifications are targets and tolerances determined by designers of products and services. Targets are the ideal values for which pro- duction strives; tolerances are acceptable deviations from these ideal values. For example, a computer chip manufacturer might specify that the distance between pins on a computer chip should be 0.095 ± 0.005 inches. The value 0.095 is the target, and ±0.005 is the tolerance. Thus, any pin distance between 0.090 and 0.100 would be acceptable. A lack of defects has constituted quality in manufactur- ing for many years. Many studies comparing domestic and foreign products focus on statistical measures of defects. However, the lack of defects alone will not satisfy or exceed customer expectations. Many top managers have stated that good quality of conformance is simply the “entry into the game.” A better way to achieve dis- tinction and delight customers is through improved product design. Thus, manufac- turers are turning their attention toward improved design for achieving their quality and business goals.\n\nQUALITY IN SERVICES\n\nService can be defined as “any primary or complementary activity that does not directly produce a physical product—that is, the non-goods part of the transaction\n\n16 Part 1: Foundations of Quality and Performance Excellence\n\nCopyright 2017 Cengage Learning.

Service orga- nizations include hotels; health, legal, engineering, and other professional services; educational institutions; financial services; retailers; transportation; and public utilities.\n\nToday services account for nearly 80 percent of the U.S. workforce. The importance of quality in services cannot be underestimated, as statistics from a variety of studies reveal:18\n\n• The average company never hears from more than 90 percent of its unhappy customers. For every complaint it receives, the company has at least 25 customers with problems, about one-fourth of which are serious.\n\n• Of the customers who make a complaint, more than half will do business again with that organization if their complaint is resolved. If the customer feels that the complaint was resolved quickly, this figure jumps to about 95 percent.\n\n• The average customer who has had a problem will tell nine or ten others about it. Customers who have had complaints resolved satisfactorily will tell only about five others.\n\n• It costs six times more to get a new customer than to keep a current customer.\n\nSo why do many companies treat customers as commodities? In Japan, the notion of customer is equated with “honored guest.” Service clearly should be at the fore- front of a firm’s priorities.\n\nThe service sector began to recognize the importance of quality several years after manufacturing had done so. This can be attributed to the fact that service industries had not confronted the same aggressive foreign competition that faced manufacturing. Another factor is the high turnover rate in service industry jobs, which typically pay less than manufacturing jobs. Constantly changing personnel makes establishing a culture for continuous improvement more difficult.\n\nThe production of services differs from manufacturing in many ways, and these differences have important implications for managing quality. The most critical dif- ferences are:\n\n1. Customer needs and performance standards are often difficult to identify and measure, primarily because the customers define what they are, and each cus- tomer is different.\n\n2. The production of services typically requires a higher degree of customization than does manufacturing. Doctors, lawyers, insurance salespeople, and food- service employees must tailor their services to individual customers. In manufacturing, the goal is uniformity.\n\n3. The output of many service systems is intangible, whereas manufacturing pro- duces tangible, visible products. Manufacturing quality can be assessed against firm design specifications, but service quality can only be assessed against cus- tomers’ subjective, nebulous expectations, and past experiences. Manufactured goods can be recalled or replaced by the manufacturer, but poor service can only be followed up by apologies and reparations.\n\nChapter 1: Introduction to Quality and Performance Excellence 17\n\nCopyright 2017 Cengage Learning.

Services are produced and consumed simultaneously, whereas manufactured goods are produced prior to consumption. In addition, many services must be performed at the convenience of the customer. Therefore, services cannot be stored, inventoried, or inspected prior to delivery as manufactured goods are. Much more attention therefore must be paid to training and building quality into the service as a means of quality assurance.\n\n5. Customers often are involved in the service process and are present while it is being performed, whereas manufacturing is performed away from the cus- tomer. For example, customers of a quick-service restaurant place their own orders, carry their food to the table, and are expected to clear the table when they have finished eating.\n\n6. Services are generally labor intensive, whereas manufacturing is more capital intensive. The quality of human interaction is a vital factor for services that involve human contact. For example, the quality of hospital care depends heavily on interactions among the patients, nurses, doctors, and other medical staff. Hence, the behavior and morale of service employees is critical in deliv- ering a quality service experience.\n\n7. Many service organizations must handle very large numbers of customer transactions. For example, on a given business day, FedEx and UPS handle millions of shipments across the globe every day, and banks process similar volumes of transactions. Such large volumes increase the opportunity for error.\n\nThese differences made it difficult for many service organizations to fully under- stand and apply TQ principles when it was the rage in manufacturing, although many have caught up admirably.\n\nMany service organizations have well-developed quality assurance systems. However, they often tend to be based on manufacturing analogies and tend to be more product-oriented than service-oriented. Many of the key dimensions of prod- uct quality apply to services. For instance, “on time arrival” for an airline is a mea- sure of service performance; frequent flyer awards and “business class” sections\n\nKNOCK THREE TIMES19\n\nMarriott has become infamous for its obsessively detailed standard operating procedures (SOPs), which result in hotels that travelers either love for their consistent good quality or hate for their bland uniformity. “This is a company that has more controls, more systems, and more procedural manuals than anyone—except the government,” says one industry veteran. “And they actually comply with them.” Housekeepers work with a 114-point checklist. One SOP: Server knocks three times. After knocking, the associate\n\nshould immediately identify him- or herself in a clear voice, saying, “Room Service!” The guest’s name is never mentioned outside the door.\n\nAlthough people love to make fun of such procedures, they are a serious part of Marriott’s business, and SOPs are designed to protect the brand. Recently, Marriott has removed some of the rigid guidelines for owners of hotels it man- ages, empowering them to make some of their own decisions on details.\n\n18 Part 1: Foundations of Quality and Performance Excellence\n\nCopyright 2017 Cengage Learning.

A typical hotel’s quality assurance system focuses on technical specifications such as properly made-up rooms (see box “Knock Three Times”). However, service organizations have special requirements that manufacturing systems cannot fulfill. The most important factors of service quality include the following:20\n\n• Time: How much time must a customer wait? • Timeliness: Will a service be performed when promised? • Completeness: Are all items in the order included? • Courtesy: Do frontline employees greet each customer cheerfully? • Consistency: Are services delivered in the same fashion for every customer, and\n\nevery time for the same customer? • Accessibility and convenience: Is the service easy to obtain? • Accuracy: Is the service performed right the first time? • Responsiveness: Can service personnel react quickly and resolve unexpected\n\nproblems?\n\nService organizations must look beyond product orientation and pay signifi- cant attention to customer transactions and employee behavior. Several points that service organizations should consider are as follows:21\n\n• The quality characteristics that a firm should control may not be the obvious ones. Customer perceptions are critical, although it may be difficult to define what the customer wants. For example, speed of service is an important qual- ity characteristic; yet, perceptions of speed may differ significantly among different service organizations and customers. Marketing and consumer research can play a significant role.\n\n• Behavior is a quality characteristic. The quality of human interaction is vital in every transaction that involves human contact. For example, banks have found that the friendliness of tellers is a principal factor in retaining depositors.\n\n• Image is a major factor in shaping customer expectations of a service and in setting standards by which customers evaluate that service. A breakdown in image can be as harmful as a breakdown in delivery of the service itself. Top management is responsible for shaping and guiding the image that the firm projects.\n\n• Establishing and measuring service levels may be difficult. Service standards, particularly those relating to human behavior, are often set judgmentally and are hard to measure. In manufacturing, it is easy to quantify output, scrap, and rework. Customer attitudes and employee competence are not as easily measured.\n\n• Quality control activity may be required at times or in places where supervi- sion and control personnel are not present. Often work must be performed at the convenience of the customer. This calls for more training of employees and self-management.\n\nThese issues suggest that the approach to managing quality in services differs from that used in manufacturing. However, manufacturing can be seen as a set of\n\nChapter 1: Introduction to Quality and Performance Excellence 19\n\nCopyright 2017 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Manufacturing is a customer of product design; assembly is a customer of manufacturing; sales is a customer of packaging and dis- tribution. If quality is meeting and exceeding customer expectations, then manufacturing takes on a new meaning, far beyond product orientation. TQ pro- vides the umbrella under which everyone in the organization can strive to create customer satisfaction.\n\nQUALITY IN HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION, GOVERNMENT, AND NOT-FOR-PROFITS\n\nOne service industry that faces continuing pressure to improve quality—and one with the strongest interest in quality today—is health care. Quality has been a focus in health care for some time. In 1910, Ernest Codman, M.D., proposed the “end result system of hospital standardization.” Under this system, a hospital would track every patient it treated long enough to determine whether the treat- ment was effective. If the treatment was not effective, the hospital would then attempt to determine why, so that similar cases could be treated successfully in the future. The ACS developed Minimum Standards for Hospitals in 1917 and began\n\nTHE FIVE KEY DIMENSIONS OF SERVICE QUALITY\n\nResearch has identified five principal dimensions that contribute to customer perceptions of quality:\n\n1. Reliability: The ability to provide what was promised, dependably and accurately. Examples include customer service repre- sentatives responding in the promised time, following customer instructions, providing error-free invoices and statements, and mak- ing repairs correctly the first time.\n\n2. Assurance: The knowledge and courtesy of employees, and their ability to convey trust and confidence. Examples include the ability to answer questions, having the capabilities to do the necessary work, monitoring credit card transactions to avoid possible fraud, and being polite and pleasant during customer transactions.\n\n3. Tangibles: The physical facilities and equip- ment, and the appearance of personnel.\n\nTangibles include attractive facilities, appro- priately dressed employees, and well- designed forms that are easy to read and interpret.\n\n4. Empathy: The degree of caring and individual attention provided to customers. Some examples might be the willingness to sched- ule deliveries at the customer’s convenience, explaining technical jargon in a layperson’s language, and recognizing regular customers and calling them by name.\n\n5. Responsiveness: The willingness to help customers and provide prompt service. Examples include acting quickly to resolve problems, promptly crediting returned mer- chandise, and rapidly replacing defective products.\n\nThese dimensions have been incorporated into a survey methodology known as SERVQUAL.22\n\n20 Part 1: Foundations of Quality and Performance Excellence\n\nCopyright 2017 Cengage Learning.

The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health- care Organizations (JCAHO)—the principal accreditation agency for health care— was created in 1951 through a collaboration of ACS and several other agencies to provide voluntary accreditation. Its mission is “to continuously improve the safety and quality of care provided to the public through the provision of health care accreditation and related services that support performance improvement in health care organizations.” By 1970, accreditation standards were recast to represent opti- mal achievable levels of quality, rather than minimum essential levels of quality. JCAHO issued new standards in 1992 requiring all hospital CEOs to educate them- selves on CQI (continuous quality improvement—the term used in the health care profession to denote quality initiatives) methods.23 The new standards emphasize performance improvement concepts and incorporate quality improvement principles more fully in areas such as surgical case review, blood usage evaluation, and drug usage evaluation.\n\nOther organizations, such as the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI), have emerged to support quality improvement in health care. IHI’s goals are improved health status, better clinical outcomes, reduced costs that do not com- promise quality, greater access to care, an easier-to-use health care system, and improved satisfaction to patients and communities. IHI focuses on fostering collab- oration, rather than competition, among health care organizations, and promotes the use of quality control tools that have proven to be beneficial in manufacturing. One early pilot project driven by IHI at 37 intensive care units resulted in huge drops in pneumonia and other complications, shorter patient stays, and cost reduc- tions of up to 30 percent.\n\nIn 1990, SSM Health (SSM) Care became one of the first health care organi- zations in the United States to implement CQI throughout its entire system. Five years later, after visiting manufacturing recipients of the Malcolm Baldrige Award and learning about their practices, SSM instituted a new leadership plan, improved strategic and financial planning processes, a new conference to share best practices among its hospitals, and a"
