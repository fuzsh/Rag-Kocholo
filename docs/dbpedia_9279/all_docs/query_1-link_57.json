As they nibble on it, they’re caught by the witch, who is about to bake the children in the oven when Gretel throws her into the oven instead. The ballet ends with a celebration of the evil witch’s demise.\n\nThe addition of the extra characters, Bland said, provided more depth and interaction to the tale.\n\nBland said he chose an array of classical music to help tell the story, searching through many albums for pieces that would fit.\n\n“I didn’t want to use music from the opera, or music people would know,” he said. “I found some unique, fun things.”\n\nHe selected works by the Czech composer Oskar Nedbal from his 1907 ballet “From Fairy Tale to Fairy Tale”; by Dmitri Shostakovich from his “Jazz Suite” of the 1930s; by Romanian Gypsy composer Georges Boulanger (1893-1958), a violinist/conductor/composer; and by Austrian violinist/composer Fritz Kreisler (1875-1962). There are also pieces recorded by contemporary American violinist Michaela Paetsch Neftel (born in 1961).\n\nBland said families can enjoy a pre-performance reception beginning at 12:30 p.m. in the upstairs lobby of the Miller Center, where members of the cast, in costume, will be available to meet children and supervise stories and crafts.\n\nThe reception also will offer treats from Ady Cakes and ice cream from Sweet Ride (both of West Reading), as well as a candy “bar.”\n\nContact Susan L.
