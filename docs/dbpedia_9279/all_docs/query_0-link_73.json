I needed to hear, and know, the music the characters knew, so concentrated on getting recordings from the earliest possible in existence to about 1930, and then expanded to learn as widely as I could the whole violin world. The list below is what I collected through the writing of the story, and my thoughts on them.\n\n\"The Auer Legacy\" (six-disc collection of recordings made 1906-1937)"
