        "text": "ARREST REUNITES DAD AFTER 11 YEARS Father Sees in Orphanage A father, who had not seen his son and a daughter since 1945, was reunited with them yesterday as a result of the arrest Saturday the son on robbery and assault charges. Clarence L. Clark, 59, a clerk in the Arcade hotel, 1013 Madison read in yesterday's TRIBUNE of the arrest of six persons accused of two robbery assaults Friday night near Marine dr. and Lawrence ay. Ciark noticed a picture Robert L .\n\nClark, 19, of 4851 Hazel one of those arrested, and thought he saw a family resemblance. He went to Summerdale police station and asked Desk Sgt. George Kammerer for permission to see Robert Clark. Tearful Reunion Follows Kammerer arranged a meeting and a tearful reunion resulted as the elder Clark Photo! Robert Lee Clark, 19, and his father, Clarence, 59. nized his son, whom he had last seen as a boy of 8 .\n\nAfter talking to his son, Clarence Clark went in a police squad car to Angel Guardian orphanage, 2001 Devon and there he saw his daughter, Shirley, 17, for the first time in 11 years. The elder Clark said he was separated from his wife, Caroline, in 1945, and lost track of his family. Robert Clark said he was taken first to the juvenile home, and then to Angel Guardian orphanage after his parents separated. He told his father he believed an older brother, Clarence 21, is in the air force. Promises to Aid Children The elder Clark promised that he would attempt to find a home for his children, and that he would try to help his son .\n\nRobert Clark and two companions, Kenneth M. Yebez, 17, of 4653 Hazel and Thomas E. Lindahl, 22, of 933 Leland will appear in Boys court today. They were accused of robbing and assaulting Robert B. Josiin, 39, of 4950 Marine an advertising official, and assaulting Garret H .\n\nFranke, 25, of 5018 Sheridan a bank bookkeeper in a an alleged robbery attempt. AUTO AND TAXI GO ONTO WALK; 3 PERSONS HURT Passers-by in Randolph east of Clark were scattered last night by an automobile and a taxicab that upon the sidewalk after a freakish collision in heavy traffic. Mrs. Lillian Berg, 47, of 1606 Hyde Park the automobile driver, stopped at the south curb in Randolph a one westbound artery, and stepped out from behind the steering wheel to let her mother, Mrs. Goldie Siegel, 84, of 5480 Cornell riding beside her, alight at the curb .\n\nAs she moved toward the open door, Mrs. Siegel told police, her foot brushed the accelerator, and the car took off, plunging in a circular, northerly path between passing cars. Mrs. Berg grabbed the door, attempting to stop the runaway car, and was dragged across the street. The car rammed a parked cab and followed it upon the sidewalk, spilling gasoline all over the street .\n\nPassers-by dodged the plunging cars, but the two women suffered minor bruises. Roy Bollman 26, of 712 Willard the driver, who was standing beside his cab, was struck by it and suffered a shoulder fracture. Bollman is a probationary policeman dog catcher. Mrs. Berg was charged with parking a vehicle with the motor running and the keys in the ignition switch .\n\nDanny Thomas Young Again, and Snaps Ankle Beverly Hills, July 15 (R- Comedian Danny Thomas suffered a fracture of the left ankle last night in an impromptu basketball game in his back yard, a spokesman said. Thomas, 42, was frolicking with several college boys who were visiting his daughter. Margaret, 18. H-BOMB TEST WILL BE HELD IN CITY FRIDAY Twoimaginary hydrogen bombs will explode in the Chicago area Friday. Where they will hit is a secret even to Anthony J .\n\nMullaney, director of the Chicago civil defense corps. The simulated attack on the city will come at 12:45 p. m. as part of a two day nation-wide test of civil defense training. Seventy-five other points in the United States and its possessions also will be struck in the mock aerial attack .\n\nMullaney had been advised by the federal civil defense administration, which set up exercise, on the time of the attack and the number of bombs to be dropped. Plans Revised Originally, plans worked out by the federal agency called for a sealed envelope to be given to Mullaney containing the locations where the bombs will be assumed to have been exploded. Mullaney, under this plan, would not open the envelope until the time of the attack. However, Mullaney thought it would be more realistic not to receive the envelope and the agency granted his request. Instead, he will be notified of the target area immediately after the attack .\n\nKeeps It Flexible This way, we will be required to keep our plans flexible and we will be confronted with problems which must be met without prior information, as they would in an actual attack,\" he said. When the targets are known, Mullaney and his staff will be able to chart the rings of 66 damage from these points. The location of the damage areas will be the key to the issuing of instructions for rescue work and meeting other test problems. -FUNERAL DIRECTORSLAIN SON Funeral Information SOUTH CHAPEL 316 W. 63D-ST .\n\nPHONE: WEntworth 6-0025 MONDAY SIM--Alexander 1 p.m. at chapel TUESDAY CLOUD -William A. 1 p. m. at chapel NORTH CHAPEL 5501 N .\n\nASHLAND-AV.
