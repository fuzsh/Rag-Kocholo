        "text": "SHAKESPEARE WITH A TWIST\n\nThe Shakespeare Festival of Dallas will boldly embellish the Bard this year with two novel presentations. Shogun Macbeth, a new conceptualized rendering of the popular Shakespeare tragedy, places the greedy bureaucrat and his power-driven wife squarely in the middle of feudal Japan. Much Ado About Nothing, the comic love story of the ever-bickering Benedict and Beatrice, is set on a yacht in the Mediterranean, circa 1937. Taking liberties of time and place with Shakespeare, while leaving the language intact, is part and parcel of the Shakespeare tradition. His plots of courtship and scheming, his themes of love and damnation and his multi-dimensional way with words all defy the specifics of history, custom and cultural guise. With that in mind, director John Briggs has taken Macbeth and moved its Renaissance grandeur and dark deeds of undoing to an equally regal, menacing place and time-Japan, about the year 1200, where politics are mystical and orderly, and consequences are unforgiven. P. Sanders MacNeal has created lavish Japanese costumes and Robin Murray has constructed a set that conjures both the Japan of then and the pristine Japanese theater aesthetic of then and now. Briggs’ elaborate staging incorporates Japanese Kabuki theater. Dale A. J. Rose is directing Much Ado with less alteration of the text but a great dose of whimsy that’s most appropriate to one of Shakespeare’s most whimsical, happy works. The production will be underscored with about half a dozen songs of the day, including several by Gershwin.\n\nMuch Ado opens on July 19 and plays on odd-numbered dates in July and even-numbered dates in August through August 4. Shogun Macbeth opens July 20 and plays on even-numbered dates in July and odd-numbered dates in August through August 3. No performances on Mondays. Gates open at 7:30 pm; performances begin at 8:15 at the Band Shell, Fair Park. Stadium seating; coolers and picnic baskets encouraged. Free. 987-1993.\n\n-Tim Allis<BR>CALDER’S ANIMALS: FUN FOR ALL\n\n“Calder’s Animals: Made at the Zoo and Elsewhere, Too!” is the first exhibit in what the Fort Worth Art Museum hopes will become an annual tradition: a summer art show just for children. At the end of each school year, the museum will set aside one gallery for an exhibit of works by important artists that appeal especially to the young. It’s such a good idea one wonders why other museums don’t do the same. But none of this should keep adults away from the show. Any grownup who can’t enjoy Calder’s witty little sketches and sculptures of zoo and circus animals is too grown up.\n\nCalder is known for his mobiles, deftly balanced sculptures that twist and turn slowly in the wind. But during the early Twenties, while he was a student at New York’s Art Students League, he would haunt the Central Park and Bronx zoos with his drawing pad, effortlessly distilling with pen or brush the very essence of some animal in a continuous, wire-thin contour. “I seem to have the knack of doing it with a single line,” he said. He also developed the knack of twisting single strands of wire into equally engaging sculptures.\n\nIn 1926, after he moved to Paris, Calder started work on his minor masterpiece, “The Circus,” a miniature environment composed of dozens of wire figures. Most of them were animated and the artist charmed the Paris art world with regular circus performances in his apartment. “Calder’s Circus,” a 19-minute movie record of one of these performances, will be shown at the museum.\n\n“Calder’s Animals: Made at the Zoo and Elsewhere, Too!” will continue through Sept. 1 at the Fort Worth Art Museum, 1309 Montgomery St. Hours are Tue 10-9, Wed-Sat 10-5, Sun 1-5. Call (817) 738-9215 for information.\n\n-Ken Barrow\n\nHAPPY 300TH, J.S. BACH\n\nOf the numerous area events honoring the tricentennial of the birth of J.S. Bach, the biggest is sponsored, appropriately enough, by the Dallas Bach Society. Under the leadership of Bach Society artistic director Paul Riedo, the organization will present its most ambitious Bach festival to date, filling four consecutive Monday nights in July. While focusing on the music of Bach, the festival will present music by contemporaries of Bach as well, and will touch on four major areas of Bach’s prodigious output: chamber music, orchestral music, choral music and organ music.\n\nThe series opens July 8 with an orchestral concert including Bach’s First Orchestral Suite, Handel’s Concerto Grosso in G minor and Vivaldi’s ever-popular concerto cycle, The Four Seasons, with violin soloist J. Patrick Rafferty performing with the Dallas Bach Orchestra. On July 15, the Dallas Bach Choir will perform motets of Bach in a concert also featuring solo organ works. July 22 will bring an all-Bach chamber music concert including the Sonata in E for violin and harpsichord, the sonata in B minor for flute and harpsichord, the Sonata in A minor for unaccompanied violin and the Trio Sonata from “TneMusical Offering.” On July29, the series will conclude with a performance of a work many consider to be Bach’s greatest, the Mass in B minor, with soloists Julianne Baird and Kathleen Terbeek (sopranos), Dale Terbeek (countertenor), Karl Dent (tenor) and Jan Opalach (bass) joining the Dallas Bach Choir and Orchestra with Riedo conducting. All performances at St. Thomas Aquinas Church, 6306 Kenwood Avenue. July 18, 15 & 22 at 8:15 p.m.; July 29 at 7:30 p.m. Tickets $7.50 for July 8, $5 for July 15 & 22, $8.50 for July 29 or $20 for the entire series. 827-8886.\n\n-Wayne Lee Gay\n\nD’s Openers include this month’s theater, music, film, sports, art, dance, enlightenment and recreation events, as well as a list of the top nightlife establishments in Dallas.

Actually, we know little of this musical by Dallasite Kyle McClaran except that it’s a first venture by Rosser Square Productions and that the Lower Greenville crowd is talking about it as they do the opening of a new club, which could spell c-u-l-t.

Guerney about 14-year-old Charlie and the problems he’s having figuring out who he’s supposed to be. While his father is away fighting World War II, he’s trapped in a brooding, self-analytical, proper East Coast summer vacation (in Canada) with his lonely mother, who thinks he should be more responsible, his nagging sister, who thinks he’s a jerk, and two friends who seem to be doing things he hasn’t yet learned how to do.

(6332 La Vista. 823-5340. Thur 7 pm-2 am, Fri & Sat 5 pm-2 am. Closed Sun-Wed, MC, V, AE.)\n\nCafé Dallas. Café Dallas sports ceiling fans, slick art posters, obligatory potted plants and smiling waitresses bedecked in slinky red dresses. The club’s circular, casino-like layout seems conducive to |ust about any sort of bar behavior, from frenzied dancing on the split-level dance floor to intimate whispering on the cushioned couches that line the walls. (5500 Greenville. 9870066 Mon-Fri 4 pm-2 am. Sat & Sun 7 pm-2 am. MC, V, AE.)\n\nCallaghan’s Saloon. This West End bar is the best place in town to pretend you’re Irish. You show up. stare at the green walls, watch all the people singing to corny Irish songs played by live Irish bands, drink a few inexpensive beers (there’s also a good selection of imported ones) and suddenly you think you’ve belonged here all your life. (1701 N Market at Ross. 761-9355. Mon-Sat 11 am-2 am, Sun noon-10 pm. No cover. AE, DC, CB.)\n\nComedy Corner. The only full-time club in town devoted to stand-up comedy keeps rolling along. Its a great place to see hot new comedy talent from around the country. During each show, you see the nightclub’s own house comedian, a feature comedian and then the main comedian. And at amateur night on Tuesdays, you get to watch anyone from local sportscasters to corporate lawyers try out their acts, (8202 Park Lane at Greenville. 361-7461. Sets begin Sun-Thur at 9 pm, Fri & Sat at 8:45 & 10:45 pm. Reservations recommended on weekends. Cover: $5.50 Sun & Tue- Thur, $8 Fri, $9 Sat. MC, V, AE.)\n\nConfetti. Look what’s happened to Dallas’ meat market: It went upscale. No more wild-looking waitresses in nasty outfits. No more best-body contests. No more teen-ager-looking types. Now sleekly redesigned tor the young office crowd, the club still throws a good party. (5201 Matilda oft Lovers Lane. 369 6969. 369-6977. Mon-Thur 5 pm-2 am. Fri 5 pm-4 am. Sal 7 pm-4am, Sun 6 pm-2 am. Cover Mon-Thur after 9 $1. Fri & Sat $3. Sun $2 All credit cards.)\n\nCotton Candy Club. An old. Harlem-era jazz and rhythm and blues club, the Cotton Candy appeals to an older South Dallas crowd, and the atmosphere is reminiscent of a time when clubs were big and fancy south of the river. (2532 Martin Luther King Blvd. 428-5034. Tue-Sat 4 pm-2 am. Closed Sun & Mon. Cover on weekends. No credit cards.)\n\nCourt Five. This place could be one of your great discoveries. A hole in the wall hidden among the North Dallas apartment complexes, this little bar attracts non-swingle-style partiers who have a roaring great time dancing to such decent little rock ’n’ roll bands as the Vinyl Tops and Solid Partners. There’s a large outdoor patio, hilarious photos on the wall of the owner with his friends and even bad pool tables in the back. (7108 Holly Hill. 363-0174. Mon-Fri 5 pm-2 am, Sal & Sun 7 pm-2 am. MC, V, AE.)\n\nEllington’s. Pay a stiff cover, waltz in on gilded spike heels or new Italian-leather shoes and what do you find? Another Upper Greenville dance club. Ellington’s is trying to prove that the SYs (Swinging Yuppies) will come to a bar that has live music every night. You’ll find good bands but the same hustle atmosphere that pervades North Dallas. (The Corner Shopping Center, 8021 Walnut Hill. 369-8445. Mon-Sat 4 pm-2 am. Closed Sun. MC, V, AE. Cover: $3 Mon-Thur, $5 Fri & Sat.)\n\nFast and Cool. This latest Shannon Wynne creation, located in the old Nick’s Uptown building, is a dance club with naked light bulbs hanging down from the ceiling and female dancers in cages. The diverse dance tunes include everything from the Animals to the Eurythmics to Motown hits. (3606 Greenville. 827-5544. Tue-Sun 7 pm-2 am. Cover: $3 Thur-Sat. MC, V, AE.)\n\nGershwin’s Bar & Grill. No one can discover a nightspot faster than the North Dallas single. This new Upper Greenville restaurant features two bars-and both are constantly packed. If you don’t like the bar closest to the door, you can simply work your way over to the one beside a grand piano that appears to be built on top of a scaffolding. Most of the crowd is at the bar waiting for a table, so if you’re going to hustle someone, you’d better hurry. (8442 Walnut Hill at Greenville. 373-7171. Sun-Thur 11:30 am-midnight, Fri & Sat 11:30 am-1 am. No cover. MC, V, AE, DC.)\n\nThe Golden Parachute. Who misses elan, the private Greenville Avenue disco that closed last year? Now there’s a better imitation in Far North Dallas. The only problem is that the membership costs $200 per year. Once inside, you’re in your typical elegant disco with sensual people (these places never change). But there is a nice veranda where you can cool off outside if your hormones get too hot. (5505 Belt Line. 233-9499. Mon-Fri 3 pm-2 am Sat 7 pm-2 am. Closed Sun. All credit cards.)\n\nIn Cahoots. Like a randy phoenix rising from the remains of the old Papagayo, this multilevel, chromed-out fleshpot is Babylon revisited in NorthPark East. What has the Me Generation come to? The obligatory video here is a mix of cartoons, rock and Selfdance -you can watch your celluloid self writhing on the dance floor, in case there’s any doubt about your reality. The waitresses are scantily clad, the drinks are strong and the after-work buffet ranks with the best in Dallas. (NorthPark East, 8796 N Central Expwy. 692-5412. Mon-Thur 5:30 pm-2 am, Fri & Sat 7:30 pm-3:30 am, Sun 7:30 pm-2 am. All credit cards.)\n\nJazba at Ratcliffe’s. If we mention this place too loudly, will we have trouble getting a table when we want one? This small, elegant jazz bar in Ratcliffe’s seafood restaurant has what we like: clean lines, smooth music and Southern comfort. (1901 McKinney. 748-7480. Tue-Sat 8 pm-1 am; live music beginning at 9 pm. Closed Sun & Mon. Weekend cover: $5. All credit cards.)\n\nJazz City. There are nightclubs galore that offer a sprinkling of jazz, but until now. none has tried so diligently to recreate New Orleans’ French Quarter atmosphere. Here, on far Lower Greenville, you’ll find a place that serves New Orleans food and drinks, and it plays pure, straight jazz. Every major |azz group in the area comes through, so you can get a taste of just about all Dallas has to offer. (1518 Greenville, south of Ross. 823-7474. Mon-Thur 11 am-midnight, Fri 11-2, Sat 4 pm-2. Live music Thur-Sat. Cover varies depending on act. MC, V, AE.)\n\nLonghorn Ballroom. The Longhorn hasn’t changed much since the last time you were there. It still offers only beer and setups and one of the best country/ western dance floors in Dallas. Owner Dewey Groom has made his place synonymous with country music and a lasting source of local pride. (216 Corinth at Industrial. 428-3128. Wed & Thur 7 pm-1 am, Fri & Sat 7 pm-2 am, Sun 5-11:30 pm. All credit cards)\n\nMemphis. This is the best live music bar in Far North Dallas, if you like large jazz ensembles-and everybody seems to. The little Addison bar is usually packed with jazz buffs listening to regulars such as Clairvoyance. Emerald City and Eddie Harrison and the Shortcuts. (Quorum Plaza. 5000 Belt Line, Suite 500. 386-9517 Mon-Fri 4 pm-2 am. Sat & Sun 7 pm-2 am. Cover: $3-$5. All credit cards.)\n\nNairobi Room. Are you adrift from reality, are you in touch with your true self, or are you just sticking safety pins through your ears because everyone else is doing it? Find out here, at the most well-known new wave and punk bar in the city. Sometimes the Nairobi Room is a parody of itself: A lot of people there try exceedingly hard to make themselves look too cool. During the day. no doubt, they wear business suits. But, hey, dress any way you want and they’ll let you in. (Beer and wine only. BYOB. 2914 Harry Mines, in the Town House Motor Lodge. 748-9567. Open 7 days a week, 7 pm-2 am. Bands and cover charge are sporadic. No credit cards.)\n\nNo Whar But Texas. This place may be the most laid-back of the big country/western bars No one seems to care if you can’t dance or drawl. But you’ll still find great North Dallas cowboys and cowgirls on and around the huge dance floor. (The Corner Shopping Center, 9840 N Central Expwy. 369-3866. Mon-Fri 5 pm-2 am, Sat 7 pm-2 am. Sun 6 pm-2 am. Cover vanes. MC, V, AE, DC.)\n\nPoor David’s Pub. In a city where live music clubs close quicker than real estate deals. Poor David’s has been hanging on for eight years. It’s still the leader in blues artists, progressive-country singers, and the top touring folk singers. (1924 Greenville. 821-9891. Mon & Wed-Sat 4 pm-2 am, Tue 6 pm-2 am. Closed Sun. Cover varies. No credit cards.)\n\nProhibition Room. Return with us now to this old Prohibition-style bar. Through a tunnel, down in the basement, you’ll find great atmosphere: hardwood floors, a bar made from old buildings, jazz, blues, old Sinatra tunes on the jukebox, pool tables. It’s a tremendous after-work place, and it features good live acts on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. (703 McKinney in the Brewery. 954-4407. Mon-Sat 4 pm-2 am. Closed Sun. All credit cards.)\n\nRazz Ma’ Tazz. The nightclub assault continues in the West End district of downtown Dallas. The latest. Razz Ma’ Tazz, offers one of the most intriguing interiors we’ve seen in a while: a combination of a Havana show room from the Fifties and a plain old Sixties rock and roll hang out. The live music you get. though, ranges from rock to R&B to dance-styled pop. Good local bands, ornate bar, hamburgers and sandwiches also available. (1714 Market. 748-7112. Tue-Thur 4 pm-midnight, Fri-Sun 4 pm-1 am. MC, V, AE.)\n\nRick’s Casablanca. At first glance, you may think you’ve come to one of those old-fashioned tropical bars (with perhaps the best ceiling fans in Dallas). But Rick’s is quickly becoming one of the best small clubs to hear good bands, from reggae to rhythm and blues. The place is often crowded early in the week, since Robert Lee Kolb and Local Heroes perform Monday through Wednesday nights. (1919 Greenville. 824-6509. Mon-Fri 4 pm-2 am. Sat & Sun 6 pm-2 am. Cover varies. MC, V, AE.)\n\nRMR’s Fast Times. You’ll love this place-if you’re under 19. The ultimate teen bar in the Dallas area, this converted skating rink is pure bedlam on Saturday nights, with nearly 1,000 teeny-boppers packed on the dance floor. There’s also a “juice” bar that serves nonalcoholic drinks such as “virgin pina coladas.” (2609 Oakland, Garland. 278-8843. Tue & Thur 8-midnight, Fri & Sat 8 pm-1 am. Cover: $4 Tue & Thur, $5 Fri & Sat No credit cards.)\n\nVenetian Room. The old king of the Dallas showroom supper clubs, the Venetian Room still consistently brings in the most recognizable names in pop-jazz-comedy acts. The posh, elegant place, with its frescoes on the walls and tuxedoed waiters, might be intimidating to some, but the dress code has been loosened (you can get by without tie or fancy dress), the cover charge ranges from $12-$20, and you don’t have to buy the full-course dinner (which starts at $20) to come to the show. (Fairmont Hotel, Ross and Akard. 720-2020. Mon-Sat, two shows nightly at 9 pm and 11 pm. MC, V, AE, DC.)\n\nNIGHTLIFE\n\nDRINKING\n\nCactus. Are you ready to get down in Richardson? At the end of the work day. it seems that everyone who must drive Central all the way from downtown stops here to unwind. By Friday, the place is a madhouse, with Richardson residents packed two deep at the bar talking mortgages and landscaping and sex, like all good suburbanites. (13929 N Central Expwy, Richardson. 234-1055. Daily 11 am-2 am. All credit cards.)\n\nChelsea Corner. In the block where upper McKinney Avenue runs into Highland Park, there is the perfect club to blend the two cultures. A quiet, candle-on-the-table place, with little sandwich or quiche dinners and all kinds of colorful fruit drinks, and a guitarist playing folk-pop songs on an elevated stage, Chelsea Corner is great for a peaceful moment before you hit the fast lane, or a way to unwind if you’re conning off it. (4830 McKinney. 522-3501. Mon-Sat 11:15-2 am, Sun 5:30 pm-2 am. Live music Tue-Sat. MC, V, AE, DC.)\n\nSan Francisco Rose. When you’re relaxing at San Francisco Rose, it’s easy to feel as if you’re in someone’s living room rather than in a Lower Greenville bar. Seating consists of cozy groupings of easy chairs and overstuffed Victorian sofas, and whether you’re alone or with a group, this arrangement lends itself to the cause. But if you’re looking for a place for an intimate conversation with a companion, you may be out of luck here. (3024 Greenville. 826-2020. Mon-Sat 11 am-2 am, Sun noon-2 am. All credit cards.)\n\nZanzibar. A fresh face on the burger-spattered strip of Lower Greenville Avenue, Zanzibar offers drinks and good deli food in a colorful café setting. The decor-neon, glass bricks and pink-and-green walls-is odd enough to work. (2912 Greenville. 828-2250. Mon 6 pm-midnight, Tue-Sat 11:30 am-2 am, Sun 10:30 am-midnight: Sun brunch: 10:30-3. AE, V, MC.)\n\nFORT WORTH NIGHTLIFE\n\nThe Blue Bird. Even when the band’s not playing, you’ll feel like dancing at The Blue Bird: The jukebox is the best in Fort Worth.

The club is packed nearly every weekend with regulars dancing to the infectious music of Robert Ealey and the Bluesblasters. (5636 Wellesley. (817) 732-6243. Fri & Sat 7 pm-2 am. No credit cards.)\n\nBilly Bob’s Texas. This huge country/western club in the Fort Worth Stockyards has a lot going for it: It’s bigger than Gilley’s, more citified than the Longhorn Ballroom and is a “must-see” if you’re in Fort Worth. (2520 N Commerce in the Stockyards. Metro 429-5979. Mon-Sat 9:30 am-2 am, Sun noon-2 am. MC, V, AE.)\n\nCaravan of Dreams. Caravan of Dreams has excellent live jazz/blues (and a bar) on the first floor, a theater with movies and live drama (and a bar) on the second floor and an outdoor patio with a cactus garden (and a bar) on the roof.
