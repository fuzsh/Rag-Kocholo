        "text": "Welcome to the Web Page of...\n\nJOHANN SEBASTIAN PAETSCH\n\nCellist\n\nBorn in Colorado Springs, USA in 1964 of musical parents, Johann Sebastian Paetsch began his violoncello studies with his father, Günther Paetsch at the age of five, giving his first public recital when he was only six. His rapid progress of chamber music started in early childhood. In his large family of nine, almost the entire chamber music repertoire for strings from duo until nonet was worked on and performed many times in concert.\n\nHe studied at Butler University with Arkady Orlovsky, at the Yale University with Aldo Parisot and at the \"Musikhochschule Lübeck\" with David Geringas. He took part in Master classes and Summer Courses with Yo-Yo Ma, Rostropovitch, Janos Starker, and Mischa Maisky. As a member of the \"Yale Cellists\" he took part in recording two world-wide famous CD's.\n\nA graduate of Yale University, Johann Sebastian Paetsch is well known for his commitment to the cello's vast chamber and instrumental repertoire. He tours widely with the Piano Trio \"Trio Kairos\", a partnership that has produced recordings. Paetsch's collaboration with numerous prominent artists of the quality of Gidon Kremer, the Wilanow Quartet and Eduard Brunner have yielded an extensive reassessment of the Romantic and late Contemporary instrumental repertoire, in particular the Messiaen \"Quartet for the End of Time\". Since 1988, Johann Sebastian Paetsch has already championed all Six Suites for Violoncello Solo by Bach in two evenings.\n\nAs a soloist who has appeared in many major music capitals of the world, he shows no hesitation in performing the concertos of Shostakovich, Prokofiev and Tchaikovsky as well as the standard repertoire. He has played the Haydn and Dvorak Cello Concertos, among others in Japan, in the USA and in Europe. His collaboration with his sister Michaela Paetsch in the many performances of the Brahms Double Concerto for violin and cello took place in the USA, Canada and Germany. He played the Schumann Concerto in California and the Saint-Saens Concerto with the Orchester della Svizzera Italiana. He interpreted Tchaikovsky's \"Rococo Variations\" in the USA. His most recent release includes the Television recording of the Haydn Cello Concerto with the \"Solisti della Svizzera Italiana.\"\n\nAs recipient of numerous prizes and awards, Johann Sebastian Paetsch was awarded the top prize in the Emmanuel Feuermann Competition and in the Young Musicians Foundation Competition in Los Angeles. He was successful in the ARD Competition in Munich, in the prestigious Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow and the Rostropovitch Competition held in Paris.\n\nJohann Sebastian Paetsch enjoys a distinguished international career as one of the foremost up-and-coming cellists of his generation. Renowned not only for his technical prowess but also for the gorgeous depth of tone and profound musicality of his playing, Mr. Paetsch is loved by audiences, critics and fellow musicians the world over. He plays a cello made in 1730 by Matteo Gofriller. Since 1992, Johann Sebastian Paetsch has been 1st Solo-cellist of the Orchestra della Svizzera Italiana in Lugano, Switzerland.\n\nJohann Sebastian Paetsch -- Repertoire\n\nThe following works for cello and orchestra, cello solo, cello and violin and cello and piano comprise partially Mr. Paetsch's repertoire, and as such are always available for Booking.\n\nCello and Orchestra\n\n* Boccherini - Concerto in B-flat * Brahms - Double Concerto in a-minor * Couperin - Pieces en Concert * Dvorak - Concerto in b-minor * Haydn - Concertos in C, D-Major * Monn - Concerto g-minor * Popper - Hungarian Rhapsody * Prokofiev - Sinfonia Concertante * Saint-Saens - Concerto in a-minor * Schuman - Concerto in a-minor * Shostakovich - Concerto No. 1 * Tartini - Concerto in A-Major * Tchaikovsky - Rococo Variations * Vivaldi - Concerto in a-minor\n\nCello Solo\n\nComposer Work Length * Bach Suite No. 1 G-Major 20' Suite No. 2 d-minor 31' Suite No. 3 C-Major 32' Suite No. 4 Eb-Major 24' Suite No. 5 c-minor 23' Suite No. 6 D-Major 22' * Cassado Suite for Solo Cello 18' * Crumb Solo Sonata 11' * Hindemith Sonata Opus 25, No. 3 10' * Kodaly Sonata Opus 8 32' * Mayuzumi \"Bunraku\" 10' * Reger Suite No. 3 a-minor 14' * Ysaye Solo Cello Sonata\n\nCello and Violin\n\n* Haydn Passacaglia * Kodaly Duo for Violin and Cello * Martinu Duo for Violin and Cello * Ravel Sonata for Violin and Cello\n\nCello and Piano\n\nComposer Work Length\n\n* Beethoven Sonata Opus 5 No. 1 g-minor 16' Sonata Opus 5 No. 2 D-Major 18' Sonata Opus 69 A-Major 25' Sonata Opus 102 No. 1 C-Major 15' Sonata Opus 102 No. 2 D-Major 22' * Boccherini Sonata in A-Major 12' * Brahms Sonata No. 1 Opus 38 e-minor 22' Sonata No. 2 Opus 99 F-Major 23' * Chopin Sonata 20' Polonaise Brillant 8' * Debussy Sonata d-minor 13' * De Falla, M.
