Some of the\n\ncomplexities include the multiple currencies used by inhabitants of the myriad states of central Eu­rope ­until the ­later nineteenth ­century (when t­ hese ­were at least stabilized, though not united), the changing of units of exchange over time, and the very dif­fer­ent “real” value of coins, especially before 1815. Although an agreement was made in the mid-­sixteenth ­century that all states of the Holy Roman Empire that issued reichstaler would maintain its silver content at 25.98 grams of silver,1 in practice t­hese ­were often clipped or the silver or gold mixed with cheaper alloys. A taler being a relatively large coin, each state could also issue its own smaller coins, in amounts left to their own discretion, making for a proliferation of fractional currencies (the most common being the groschen and the pfennig; twelve pfennig ­were equal to one groschen, and twenty-­four groschen made up the taler). Between 1754 and 1892, Austria denominated its currency in florins (F), often called gulden, which w ­ ere further divided into one hundred heller; a­ fter 1892, the Austrian currency became the krone, worth .5 of a florin. The schilling (S) was introduced in 1924 and divided into one hundred groschen; this gave way to the reichsmark ­after Germany’s annexation of Austria in 1938 but was reinstated in 1945. Some of the southern states, such as Bavaria, traded in gulden (G). As the distinguished economic historians Hans-­Jürgen Gerhard and Karl Heinrich Kaufhold noted on this subject: “Through the hands of ­wholesalers and retailers, of workers, shop­keep­ers, and w ­ omen operating market stalls passed a\n\nx iv • Note on C urre nci e s\n\n­great quantity of completely dif­fer­ent and frequently changing coins from ­every pos­si­ble princely domain, the value of each changing from year to year.”2 This—­plus enormous fluctuations in the price of the grains that fed, or failed to feed, most of the population—­makes it very hard to estimate the “real” value of wages or prices for the eigh­teenth ­century in par­tic­u­lar, and what we have available for the porcelain industry are mostly nominal wages or prices, which might have meant quite dif­fer­ent ­things to the persons who earned or paid ­these at the time. In chapters 1–3 I have tried to introduce some figures simply to get a sense of the costs and values attached to par­tic­ u­lar occupations or items, but none of t­ hese is fully meaningful without closer analy­sis of local currency values and food prices, and contrasts to ­later wage figures or commodity prices must be contextualized to ascertain their significance. I have converted figures given in florins or gulden to taler to make comparison easier. As we get to the modern period, this prob­lem is less severe as the silver content of the reichstaler (T) stabilized, and this unit of currency began to be used in many northern German states. The southern states, including Austria, however, continued to use florins (the name adapted from the Italians, who used it for their gold coins) or gulden, usually worth about two-­thirds of a taler, but also varying from one another and in value over time. In currency conventions established by the Zollverein (Customs Union) in the 1830s, the currencies ­were linked to a fixed amount of silver, such that 1 T was equivalent to .57 gulden. In 1857, the Austrian florin (F) was pegged at 1 T = .66 F.3 ­After Bismarck’s unification, the new German Empire created a single currency, the mark, to be used across all its states and valued at .33 of a taler; it was subdivided into one hundred pfenning. The mark survived the German Empire but not the ­great financial crisis of the early Weimar Republic; in order to end the hyperinflation of 1922–23, the Weimar regime issued a new currency, the rentenmark (RtM), backed by a massive mortgage on land. By the summer of 1924, sufficient stability had been achieved that a new, gold-­backed reichsmark (RM) could be introduced (1 RtM = 1 RM). In 1948, the reichsmark was replaced in West Germany with the deutschmark (DM) and in the East with the ostmark (OM), which was not\n\nNote on C u r re n c i e s • xv\n\nofficially exchangeable into western currencies. When the bureaucrats of the German Demo­cratic Republic estimated the value of the goods they exchanged with the West, they did so in a fictional currency called the valutamark (VM), with the same value as the DM. In 2002, ­after a transitional period, the re­united Germany gave up its deutschmark in f­avor of the euro at the rate of about 1.96 DM = 1 E; the Austrian schilling was exchanged for euros at the rate of 13.76 S = 1 E. For the reader’s assistance, h ­ ere is a brief list of currency abbreviations and exchanges: DM\n\ndeutschmark; introduced as West Germany’s currency in 1948\n\nE\n\neuro; introduced at about 1.98 DM in 2002\n\nF\n\nflorin; used in Austria and some southern states; value set in 1857 at .66 = 1 T\n\nG\n\ngulden (guilder) used in some southern German states, value set in 1838 at .57 of a taler\n\nM\n\nmark; replaces the taler in 1873 at the rate of 3 M = 1 T\n\nOM\n\nostmark; East German currency ­after 1948\n\nRM\n\nreichsmark; introduced in 1924 to replace the rentenmark (RtM); indexed to the market price of gold\n\nS\n\nschilling; Austrian currency used between 1924 and 1938 and again 1945–2002\n\nT\n\nreichstaler; set in 1566 at 25.98 grams of silver\n\nVM\n\nvalutamark; fictional currency name used in the GDR to estimate value of sales or purchases from the West; equivalent to 1 DM\n\nThe following abbreviations have been used for manufacturers: KGGM Königliche Gesundheitsgeschirr Manufaktur KPM\n\nKönigliche Porzellanmanufaktur\n\nWPM Wiener Porzellan Manufaktur A list of archival abbreviations appears at the end of the bibliography.\n\nAcknowl­edgments\n\nW\n\nhen one sets out to write a book in a new field, one incurs even more debts to friends, colleagues, and new contacts\n\nthan when one excavates in familiar terrain. At all stages of this proj­ ect I have needed, and found, a ­great deal of help. My first conversations about the proj­ect ­were with my emeritus colleague and beloved friend, the quantitative historian Paul Paskoff, who encouraged me to pursue a business history, and over the years has given me endless references and good advice. Perhaps second to hear about the “porcelain book” (other than, of course, my long-­suffering husband and c­ hildren) was James Brophy, whose unflagging friendship and excellent critiques of each and ­every chapter have guided me throughout; I am very much looking forward to seeing Jim’s deeply researched and critically impor­tant history of the German publishing industry—­with which this study has some fascinating parallels— in print as well. Margaret Lavinia Anderson took a g­ reat deal of time out of her busy retirement to go over several chapters with a fine-­ toothed comb and improved them im­mensely with her incisive questioning and surgical strikes on my embarrassingly vague phrasings. Mary Lindemann endured a barrage of questions about the complexities of the early modern German economy, which she understands better than anyone ­else I know; Frank Trentmann, author of the best recent global history of consumption, offered exceptionally helpful comments, especially on some of the m ­ iddle chapters and the introduction. Having presented versions of this proj­ect in many conference papers or visiting lectures, I fear I have forgotten many of ­those I o ­ ught to thank for their helpful comments: among t­hose I\n\nxv iii • Ack n owl ­e d g me nts\n\ncan remember as most inspiring ­were questions asked by Jonathan Sperber, Simone Lässig, Glenn Penny, Till van Rahden, Jesse Sponholz, Rebekka Habermas, Dror Wahrman, and Alice Goff. Fi­nally, when the manuscript was (supposedly!) done, the anonymous readers for Prince­ton University Press also prompted me to r­ eally clarify why this story was worth telling, and to inject it with as much firsthand testimony as pos­si­ble. If I have failed on ­either of ­those points, it is certainly not for lack of trying to respond to their critically impor­tant suggestions. A large number of other interlocutors have helped me find materials or understand par­tic­u­lar aspects of a subject that just kept getting more complicated the longer I pursued it. I am so fortunate to count as a friend Katherine Aaslestad, whose expertise on m ­ atters Napoleonic has been invaluable; together we have cultivated a shared interest in commemorative military memorabilia. I also learned a g­ reat deal about monarchical commemorations from my student (or I like to claim her, anyway) Eva Giloi, whose book about the Wilhelmine royal image broke new ground in this field. Another recent PhD (this time from Emory University), Claudia Kreklau, kindly shared her fascinating work on middle-­class German foodways, which helped enhance my understanding of this field, also being ploughed by my longtime friend Corinna Treitel. Corinna’s training in the history of science makes her work all the stronger; and indeed, other friends and colleagues in that field have proved greatly helpful in pursuing some aspects of this proj­ect. Thanks to a fellowship in fall 2018 at the Max Planck Institut für Wissenschaftsgeschichte, I was able to discuss my writing at a critical stage with Lorraine Daston, Joan Richards, Christine von Oertzen, Sebastian Felten, and Ursula Klein, among o ­ thers. Last minute help came from Gabriella Szalay, now curating porcelain at the Busch-­ Reisinger Museum in Cambridge, Mas­sa­chu­setts. I was lucky to follow up this semester in the com­pany of historians of science with several months among the (mostly) art historians at Villa I Tatti, the Harvard Center for Italian Re­nais­sance Studies. ­There, director Alina Payne and I had enlightening conversations about the history of German\n\nAck n owl e ­ d gm e nt s • x i x\n\n(and Eu­ro­pean) art theory and design, and I met many wonderful interlocutors, among them Thomas Gruber and Alexandra Enzensberger. An eve­ning pre­sen­ta­tion of a spin-­off essay—on porcelain and the classical tradition—­offered a cornucopia of fascinating questions and comments to follow up on. Last but far from least, my colleagues and students at Louisiana State University have been extremely helpful and supportive throughout, and I would most of all like to thank my colleague in art history Darius Spieth, who, having grown up visiting Rosenthal Studio-­Häuser and German flea markets, knows much more about recent porcelain making than I could learn from books, and John Pojman, a chemist specializing in polymers, who shares my fascination with ceramic ­recipes and happily answered my technical questions. My last-­minute undergraduate research assistant Timothy Kemp did a terrific job turning up some secondary lit­ er­a­ture and proofing all my chapters for typos. Fi­nally, it is with pride in his accomplishments that I thank Christopher Mapes—­whose honors thesis I supervised many years ago—­for providing me with archival scans and for making the maps for this book; now that he has earned his PhD (at Vanderbilt), I look forward to watching his own scholarly ­career flourish. A crucial aspect of the research undertaken for this book was the visiting of dozens of museums, where I learned invaluable lessons by looking and reading. Among ­those that made a special impact I would like to acknowledge the Porzellanikon museums in Hohenberg an der Eger and Selb ­(Bavaria), Meissen Porzellan Manufaktur und Museum, Musée de Sèvres, Kunstgewerbe Museum (Berlin), Charlottenburg Palace (Berlin), Porzellan­ sammlung (Dresden), Silberkabinett (Vienna), Augarten Museum (Vienna), Museum of Nymphenburg Porcelain (Nymphenburg Palace), Villeroy & Boch Museum (Mettlach), Museum für Kunst und Industrie (Vienna), Musée des Arts Décoratifs (Paris), Museo di Capodimonte (Naples), Museo Nazionale della Ceramica (Naples), Victoria and Albert Museum (London), Trea­sury of the G ­ rand Dukes, Pitti Palace (Florence), Royal Delft Factory and Museum (Netherlands), Friedenstein Palace and Herzogliches Museum (Gotha), Thüringer Landesmuseum Heidecksburg (Rudolstadt), Museum\n\nx x • Ack n owl­e d g m e nts\n\nLeuchtenburg/Porzellanwelten (Kahla), Museum Künstlerkolonie (Darmstadt), Reiss-­Engelhorn-­Museen and Mannheimer Schloss (Mannheim), Musée Carnavalet (Paris), and Thüringer Museum (Eisenach). This proj­ect was also made pos­si­ble by archivists, administrators, and of course Prince­ton University Press personnel who have helped me make this book a real­ity. The receipt of a Boyd (University) professorship from Louisiana State University in 2014 has made pos­si­ble a g­ reat deal of travel as well as purchases of books and images that would have become overwhelming without t­ hese research funds. I am enormously grateful to my chair (Aaron Sheehan-­Dean), my dean (Troy Blanchard), and my provost (Stacia Haynie), as well as my former chair and dean (Gaines Foster), and the all-­wise associate dean and grants coordinator (Ann Whitmer) for making pos­si­ble a leave in 2018–19 without which this book would have been several years more in the making. I am also very much in debt to the librarians and archivists who have helped me find materials over the years, most especially the staff at the Max Planck Institut für Wissenschaftsgeschichte (Berlin) and the Villa I Tatti (Florence). The archives themselves are listed in the bibliography, but I should like to personally thank Eva Wollschläger at the KPM archive, Agnes Müller at the Villeroy & Boch Unternehmensarchiv, Peter Braun at Meissen, and most especially Rüdiger Barth and Petra Werner at the Porzellanikon Archiv in Selb for their assistance. I am very grateful to Michaela Howse and Ortwin Knorr for permission to publish f­ amily photos, and for further information about their f­ amily histories. At Prince­ton, I w ­ ill be eternally grateful to Brigitta van Rheinberg for her immediate embrace of this proj­ect at an early stage of its inception, and to Eric Crahan, Thalia Leaf, Mark Bellis, and Kathleen Kageff for their careful tending of the w ­ hole pro­cess. It is hard to let go of a manuscript, but my friends and above all my beloved f­amily tell me it is time. My husband, Victor, and my sons, Charles and Henry, have had their fill of porcelain talk and are ready for me to importune them with my next subject. I am ­eager, too, to have a bound copy to give to my ­mother, Betsy; my mother-­in-­law, Jean; my ­sister and\n\nAck n owl e ­ d gm e nt s • x x i\n\nbrother-­in-­law, Jeannie and Sotiri; my aunt and cousin-­in-­law, JoAnn and Nia; and our ­great friends Paul and Beth, all of whom have been part of my porcelain experience for de­cades. Porcelain was once about aristocratic display but then became a power­ful symbol of ­family, and home. It is to ­those who gather around my holiday ­table that I dedicate this book.\n\nPorcelain\n\nIntroduction\n\nT\n\n­here is something magical, collectors and holiday hosts agree, about porcelain. It is the finest, whitest, and most dif-\n\nficult to make form of ceramics, and it enraptured Chinese emperors long before the first pieces made their way to Eu­rope in the fourteenth century. For four centuries, Eu­ro­pean royals and rich merchants cherished their imported porcelains, and entrepreneurial craftsmen mixed endless concoctions in the hopes of cutting in on this lucrative luxury trade. When a desperate Saxon alchemist fi­ nally hit upon an approximation of the Chinese r­ecipe, his vessels ­were dubbed “white gold”: and in the small Saxon town of Meissen, in the heart of Eu­rope, an industry, and obsession, was born. The book tells the story of Eu­rope’s reinvention of porcelain and concludes with the state of the fine ceramics industry t­oday. It is a rich and complicated adventure, in which we not only visit lavishly decorated palaces but also linger in blisteringly hot craft workshops and spartan working-­class homes. Though ­actual porcelain objects in all their splendor and strangeness play a central role, the focus is r­ eally on the ­people who made, marketed, and purchased them, ­whether they ­were princes, or peddlers, or middle-­class ­house­wives. While originally its uses ­were purely ornamental and decorative, over time, porcelain became a kind of “plastic,” one that could be molded to please any palate or pocket­book. A number of large-­scale manufactories—­some state sponsored, many not—­ offered busts of Frederick the G ­ reat and Napoleon, as well as Zeus and figures from the commedia dell’arte, classicizing toast racks, and “orientalizing” inkwells. Centuries ­later, ­under the Nazi regime,\n\n2 • Intro du ction\n\none ­whole factory devoted itself to SS paraphernalia. Porcelains ­were made to imitate Parian marble, lapis lazuli, or, as in the case of the many dolls’ heads made from the mixture, h ­ uman flesh. And then t­ here ­were the less vis­ i­ble uses of porcelain: in telegraph insulator tubes, in doorknobs and floor tiles, in false teeth. Across three centuries, from the eigh­teenth to the twentieth, in its central Eu­ro­pean birthplace porcelain has been a word to conjure with, and an everyday part of life. This, then, is the story of the rich and complicated lives ­people and porcelain have shared—­down to the pre­sent moment, when the Eu­ro­pean chapter of this tale, at least, seems to be drawing to a close. When I began this inquiry, I conceived of it as a part of my work on the modern afterlives of classical antiquity and the biblical Orient. My eye was caught by the spectacular confections that fill German (and non-­German) decorative arts museums and so many exquisitely illustrated and researched exhibition cata­logs. I owe most of what I know about porcelain as an art form to ­these sources.1 In ­those pages I discovered a world of vast diversity— of styles, of objects, of uses—­and began to be intrigued by the business history side of the story: who w ­ ere ­these manufacturers, and who bought all this stuff, from squirrel-­shaped teapots to semipornographic porcelain pipes? How w ­ ere Rembrandt’s masterpieces reproduced on tiny teacups, and just how did Meissen—­originally founded by King Augustus II—­survive and even flourish during the era of East German communist rule? Intrigued, I pursued my interests by delving into manufactory histories and then archival documents, and as I turned this material on my historian’s wheel, I increasingly found that I had a wonderful means to tell a story about p ­ eople, about states and markets, and about the changing nature of work and consumption over the last three centuries. This was, perhaps most importantly, the story of the strug­gle between a long-­surviving mercantile economy and the arrival of new forms of cap­i­tal­ist production and management, and the story of the transformation of an aristocratic obsession into a bourgeois necessity—­and fi­nally into an unloved white elephant. Much more than describing the imagery and artistry of porcelains, I discovered I wanted to tell t­ hese wider stories, stories that offer us a fresh way not only to grasp porcelain’s unique and\n\nI nt ro du ct i on • 3\n\nfascinating trajectory, but also to narrate German and central Eu­ro­pean history as a ­whole. In keeping with this attempt to fuse porcelain’s story together with the history of central Eu­ro­pe­ans since about 1700, this book does not pretend to be a commodity history of the sort that has taught us so much about the trades in coffee, tea, salt, sugar, and other transnational substances. ­Here, porcelain is featured, but firmly rooted in the wider context of economic and cultural developments, and treated as part of a network of other commodities, both ­those that competed with it (such as fine-­grade earthenware, or faience, and much cheaper stoneware) and ­those that enabled its spread (such as coffee, tea, and etageres for its display).2 By no means is this a truly transnational study, like the wonderful, related works of Robert Finlay, whose The Pilgrim Art tells the story of the ­earlier East Asian and Near Eastern traffic in porcelains, and of Erika Rappaport, whose work describes the British Empire’s commandeering of the tea trade.3 I do, however, emphasize the real­ity that central Eu­ro­pean developments ­were very much s­ haped by consumption and production patterns elsewhere, including ­those in China, ­England, France, the Ottoman Empire, and the United States. Similarly, though informed and inspired by the now-­extensive lit­er­a­ture on material culture and consumption, most of which focuses on Britain, France, and the United States, I am not deeply concerned with porcelain as a “­thing” or with theories of materiality.4 My method is rather guided by Daniel Roche’s insistence that historians ­ought to pay more attention to “the real world of objects without high aesthetic value,” and by Leora Auslander’s advice that the best writing about material culture is that which “seeks to grasp how the large-­scale transformations of the world are crystallized, reproduced, and changed in the small gestures of the everyday.”5 This focus on porcelain and material goods generally is not an approach familiar to most historians of Germany, who, for understandable reasons, typically feel obliged to treat more serious, often po­liti­cal, subjects. While historians of Britain, Amer­i­ca, France, and the Netherlands have shown us the ­great value and delight offered by histories of consumer goods, central Eu­ro­pe­anists have been slow to devote attention to objects of minor aesthetic\n\n4 • Intro du ctio n\n\nvalue, or even to the history of consumption itself.6 Perhaps the presumption that a consumer culture did not exist even in West Germany u ­ ntil the 1950s—­and arrived in other parts of central Eu­rope only a­ fter 1989—­has stifled interest in consumption in e­ arlier periods.7 In Marx’s homeland, too, the critique of consumption has seemed more impor­tant to study than consumption itself.8 But times are changing. The study of food cultures—­again mostly emerging from the United States, Britain, and France—is now attracting German historians as well, and innovative cultural histories have demonstrated the ways in which central Eu­rope’s monarchies and regional states won nineteenth-­century hearts and minds, partly through their inhabitants’ consumption of commemorative goods.9 Yet we still have a need for some close studies of courtly and urban consumption in the eigh­teenth c­ entury and especially for work that helps us understand the ups and downs of the transition from courtly to middle-­class consumption across the “­saddle period” of 1780 to 1830 or 1840.10 Even if consumption and material objects—as opposed to status, education, po­liti­ cal party, or ethnicity—­did not define central Eu­ro­pe­ans’ social roles ­until quite recently (and one may still debate how much of a part it plays ­today), it can nevertheless be held that consumer goods such as silk hats or porcelain have played an impor­tant role in shaping Germanness (as well as Czech and Hungarian identities, of which this author can say l­ittle but that they too need investigation). It would be wonderful to have studies of the Wilhelmine ­house­hold as evocative and detailed as some of the recent works on the Victorian home.11 I hope that this book may help to promote interest in this sort of inquiry for this region. The biggest difference between this study and previous books on the subject, however, is that while it is partly a cultural history, Porcelain is also an economic and business history, one that illuminates German-­speaking central Eu­rope’s transition from a plurality of mercantile states to its imbrication in a globalizing cap­i­tal­ist economy. The book’s focus, then, is on porcelain as an industry, one in which German princes as well as private entrepreneurs from the outset have played a major role. Economic history, so profoundly impor­tant for understanding both cultural and po­liti­cal\n\nI nt ro du ct i on • 5\n\ndevelopments, has been neglected by German and Austrian historians for some time and is in need of revival and reemphasis. By using some of its tools and rephrasing its questions, we can comprehend developments that still resonate strongly in our time. In the porcelain industry, for example, competition on price had already begun by the 1760s, and makers regularly committed what we would ­today call “industrial espionage.” ­Here we can see the special challenges faced by would-be private entrepreneurs in central Eu­ro­pean conditions, and how they responded—­not always successfully— to the more advanced industrial socie­ties to the west. Porcelain relates in concrete detail the par­tic­u­lar history of central Eu­ro­pean industrialization and gives us a glimpse of the evolution of the highly skilled workforce and the elegantly designed consumer goods for which Germany, in par­tic­u­lar, remains famous ­today. Economic histories do not need to be dry, and this one, it is hoped, makes it all the easier to understand the origins of the Eu­ ro­pean consumer marketplace by coating the tale in the translucent splendor of porcelain. Of course, ­there are many excellent economic histories of central Eu­rope, and one might rightly ask: why does porcelain ­matter, as compared to iron, coal, steel, cotton, or beer, all commodities of greater consequence for the economy as a ­whole? Social historians might won­der why one should focus on employees in this semiluxury industry—­who never numbered more than one hundred thousand—­rather than on the millions of workers in other branches of manufacturing? Porcelain may have played a smallish part in gross national output, but it was a highly vis­i­ble, mercantile product, for centuries mass-­produced with large inputs of skilled artisanal ­labor but without the ste­reo­typical steam-­powered machines, making porcelain’s history a win­dow on the trades and production practices of the Old Regime. Porcelain played a central role in putting the previously “backward” German states on Eu­rope’s luxury-­making map and, as one of the commodities first exported en masse, it helped to integrate the states that produced it into the wider global marketplace. Founded in 1710, Augustus II’s Meissen manufactory earned itself one of the first internationally admired “brand” names, and the strategies this and other mercantile makers developed to protect the\n\n6 • Intro du ctio n\n\nbrand’s reputation while also attempting to turn a profit foreshadow in remarkable ways the operations of luxury makers ­today. As a non-­necessary consumer good, one associated primarily with ­women and f­ amily life, porcelain also takes us into the world of bourgeois self-­presentation and individual (and especially female) choice, something impossible for historians of the coal or steel industries. And fi­nally, the history of porcelain illuminates the many strategies state officials and business o ­ wners have attempted to tame the unpredictable cap­i­tal­ist marketplace, made more volatile by Germany’s history of internal fragmentation, warfare, and dictatorship. Most economic histories do not emphasize the contingencies that make or break an entrepreneur, or an entire industry; this one—­I hope readers ­will ­pardon the pun!—is all about that fragility. Fi­nally, perhaps the most unconventional aspect of this book is that its center of gravity lies not in the period usually identified as the heyday of central Eu­ro­pean porcelain production, the eigh­teenth ­century, but in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.12 Many connoisseurs regard this period as one that—­aside from a few Jugendstil masterpieces—­produced only “flea market trash.”13 But it is in the post-1800 era that the history of the porcelain industry offers us real insight into the very long afterlives of mercantile economies and of forms of craft production, even as cap­i­tal­ist markets and mass production begin to take hold. Of course, porcelain is much too frail a foundation on which to build a comprehensive history of po­liti­cal and economic developments in Germany and Austria since about 1700. But time and again fascinating moments in this history flash past, illuminating in new ways familiar developments such as the rise of the nation-­state and the ravages of the ­Great Depression, the power of cartels and the increasing centrality of advertising. I hope readers ­will be convinced that while ­there are other stories to be told through porcelain, the history of this industry tells us a ­great deal about the peculiarities of central Eu­ro­pean capitalism that have ­shaped German and Eu­ro­pean culture and economic development down to the pre­sent day. At the end of this story, however, we find ourselves at a crossroads, at which porcelain and central Eu­ro­pe­ans seem to be parting ways. In the last\n\nI nt ro du ct i on • 7\n\nthirty years, and especially since the economic downturn beginning in 2008, the Eu­ro­pean porcelain industry has entered a period of severe crisis. This has to do partly with global competition and the relentless pressure underselling exerts on small, artisanal businesses, and partly with the lapsing of state subsidies for the arts and crafts. But lifestyle changes are also afoot, and for younger Eu­ro­pe­ans and Americans—­many of whom are growing up without porcelain in their lives—­the magical ambience of “white gold” has almost entirely vanished. My own biography illustrates just how recently this special commodity lost its international allure. Although I grew up in a middle-­class Californian ­house­hold, from the time I was small I knew that one used the “fine china” for holidays and that grand­mother’s porcelain figurines ­were to be admired only in their glass cabinet. When I married, I picked out a “china” pattern— in my case, a Viennese Secession pattern made by a Japa­nese firm—­and now we use that set only for guests and holidays. We store our own motley collection of other porcelain pieces in my husband’s grand­mother’s breakfront; this includes some coffee cups hand painted by my grand­mother and my ­great aunt, but no figurines (I have always disliked ­those). All are terribly dusty and neglected; I suspect my c­ hildren have never even noticed them. We eat our meals from mismatched earthenware dishes—­some of them printed with the ubiquitous “blue willow” pattern, and o ­ thers made by the Welsh Portmeiron factory. Had we come from more affluent families, or families with central Eu­ro­pean heritages, we might have chosen, or inherited, porcelain pieces made by Meissen, the oldest and most prestigious, German manufacturer, or Rosenthal, the masterful adapter of modern designs. Had we been married not in 1989 but in 2009, we might not have put any “china” at all on our wedding registry. Americans have traditionally cared less about the quality of their tableware than Eu­ro­pe­ans have, yet u ­ ntil very recently, porcelain was very much part of our cultural and economic history too. Porcelain thus ends with a poignant question: Has this story, which began with an alchemical miracle at Eu­rope’s heart, and eventually embraced by so many, come to an end? I would hope not; but porcelain’s fate w ­ ill be de­cided beyond ­these pages; perhaps, even, in the readers’ dining rooms.\n\nChapter 1\n\nReinventing the ­R ecipe\n\nI\n\nn 1976, in the w ­ aters around the lonely island of St. Helena, the Dutch underwater archaeologist Robert Sténuit made a\n\nremarkable find: the wreckage of the Dutch East Indiaman the White Lion. Portuguese warships had sunk the ship in 1613, as the two trading powers vied for control of shipping routes to the East Indies. The White Lion’s cargo gives us a snapshot of the commodities Eu­ro­pe­ans ­were willing to risk multiyear voyages, hard-­won capital, and perilous seas to obtain: pepper and diamonds, but also barrel a­fter barrel of another commodity: blue-­and-­white Ming porcelains.1 Like pepper and diamonds, Chinese porcelain was a luxury good, before 1600 owned chiefly by Ottoman, Iberian, and Italian elites. But when, in 1602, the Dutch captured and auctioned off their first Portuguese boatload of porcelain, they discovered that northern Eu­ro­pe­ans, too, ­were willing to pay a premium for this delicate commodity, which, moreover, made an ideal, waterproof ballast. By the time Dutch East India Com­pany merchants loaded up the White Lion, it had become quite conventional to fill holds with porcelains of many sizes and shapes, some of them quite ­humble (fig. 1.1). Northern Eu­rope’s love affair with porcelain had begun. The White Lion’s porcelains never made it to Amsterdam. But this ill-­fated commercial voyage and the ship’s sunken cargo tip us off to two impor­tant realities about porcelain’s history that ­will resound through this book. The first is that while made in China\n\nRe i nve nt i n g th e Rec ip e • 9\n\n1.1. White Lion teacup This ­humble teacup made up part of the salable ballast discovered in the hold of the shipwrecked White Lion. Intended for the Dutch market, this mass-­produced Chinese vessel never made it to Amsterdam.\n\nsince at least the Song Dynasty (960–1279 CE), porcelain soon became a commodity sought ­after by consumers of and traders in luxuries across the world. The second is that all porcelains are not created equal; ­there are exquisitely made ­grand vases and one-­of-­a-­kind novelties, and ­there are modestly decorated, often almost invisible, utilitarian vessels—­the ones whose sales often sustain the production of more “artistic” forms. As porcelain’s history is usually told as a tale ­either of luxury pieces or of single or regional manufactories, it is useful for us to begin by invoking this international commercial context and the long history of stylistic diversity and widely divergent price points. The White Lion reminds us to think globally,\n\n1 0 • Chapte r 1\n\neven as we focus on the central Eu­ro­pean chapters of this story, and not to forget the role played by ordinary ­house­hold consumers in the sustaining of the luxury trades. This case, too, ­will not be the last of porcelain’s ­“shipwrecks,” reminding us that commercial success is generally fleeting, ­whether we are describing a single manufactory, a par­tic­ul­ar commodity, a fash­ion­able style, a nation’s prosperity, or even the endurance of an entire industry. It is in the nature of commerce to be perpetually one White Lion away from ruin. Properly, porcelain’s history, like the White Lion’s voyage, begins in China, and the centers of dispersion into northern Eu­rope ­were ­England and the Netherlands. Both of ­these nations subsequently developed thriving ceramics industries of their own, though neither they nor the more elegant Italian and French makers of “soft-­paste” porcelain or “faience” (named a­ fter Faenza, Italy, one of the early centers of production) w ­ ere able to replicate the Chinese r­ ecipe for the highest-­quality, “hard-­paste” porcelains.2 That distinction goes to Saxony, where in 1708 a would-be alchemist first made a translucent, white vessel comparable to t­ hose of the East Asian makers. Saxony’s state sponsorship of the industry generated a model imitated by princes across the Holy Roman Empire for whom porcelain making quickly became, as Duke Carl Eugen of Württemberg described in 1758, “a necessary aspect of splendor [Glanz] and prestige [Würde].”3 By the third quarter of the eigh­teenth c­ entury, a special relationship had developed between porcelain and central Eu­rope, previously weakly integrated into the luxury markets to the west. That relationship would flourish and embrace an ever-­widening consumer base, even as most state manufactories closed or ­were transferred into private hands, rendering central Eu­rope, in the words of historian Friedrich Hofmann, “the classical land of porcelain making.” 4 The story of central Eu­rope’s passion for porcelain and the translation of that passion into an industry is the one told in this book. Porcelain making offered central Eu­ro­pean princes and states a means to demonstrate to the wealthier and more cultured Italian, French, Dutch, and En­glish elites that\n\nRe i nve nt i n g th e Rec ip e • 1 1\n\nthey too could create elegant wares. For centuries it tantalized entrepreneurs in a generally low-­consuming, war-­torn region with hopes that a stable market for luxury goods might materialize. If dreams of prosperity through porcelain making w ­ ere often dashed, the industry’s endless attempts to produce the most refined of all ceramics and to please buyers of all sorts entwined the commodity in the lives and hearts of central Eu­ro­pe­ans. This book w ­ ill follow our commodity over time, as it made its way into the homes of more and more consumers, and as symbolic meanings changed. In the eigh­teenth ­century, porcelain served as a princely proof of Glanz; in the nineteenth, it bound itself up with regional pride, with bourgeois respectability, and with hygiene; in the twentieth c­ entury, porcelain became, especially for ­women, part of an indestructible sense of “home,” security, and continuity in the face of po­liti­cal upheaval and total war—­even as it was also mobilized to make munitions and to embellish dictatorships. The central Eu­ro­pean entanglement with porcelain is not one we can grasp without delving deeply into the past and ranging across almost all aspects of life. The foregoing may help to explain why this book, written by a historian, emphasizes porcelain’s production, consumption, and cultural significance rather than its artistry. Porcelain’s artistic masterpieces have been well studied by connoisseurs and museum curators; but to this author, the non-­artistic aspects of porcelain’s history—­its relationship to advances in mineralogy, chemistry, and marketing, for example, and its complicated relationship to state power—­are as in­ter­est­ing as the history of its marketing and its use by consumers. ­These ave­nues of inquiry allow us to investigate, by a less usual route, the histories of industrialization, of commerce and consumption, of style and fashion, and of science. For porcelain came to central Eu­rope as a scientific breakthrough that followed a cascade of other experiments and improvements, and its manufacture was propelled forward by po­liti­cal and economic concerns as well as aesthetic longings. It is a commodity that richly deserves a “total” history, or as “total” a history as this author can hope to conjure. Embarking at St. Helena with the White Lion, we have an eventful voyage—­including many shipwrecks—­ahead.\n\n12 • Chapte r 1\n\nEu­ro­p ean Ceramics before Porcelain Long before the White Lion took on its cargo in Java, elegant porcelains had been produced for centuries in vari­ous parts of East Asia. Production prob­ ably began first in Jingdezhen, China, where a translucent, green ceramic form was sought to mimic the highly prized “imperial gem,” jade. Although we cannot establish precisely the date of the first “discovery” of Chinese porcelain, the production of exquisite vessels for the emperor’s t­able was already a major industry in the eleventh c­ entury. The making of pottery is of course a much older activity, practiced the world over by prehistoric ­humans. But Chinese porcelain production at Jingdezhen was dif­fer­ent in several ways: first of all, it was an industry so impor­tant to the ruling elites that it was owned and overseen by the imperial state. Secondly, it was already an industry that featured an extensive division of l­abor, including skilled and unskilled clay mixers, modelers, paint­ers, and kiln tenders. It was said that seventy-­ two hands went into making a single pot.5 Thirdly, in a world in which virtually all production and consumption was local, h ­ ere was an industry geared to exporting its products, in this case, chiefly to the court in Kaifeng and then (­under the Yuan Dynasty) Beijing, which monopolized the purchase of the finest, all-­white, line. In China, as in Eu­rope for many centuries, porcelain was not for commoners. Admirers in the Islamic world soon began to import Chinese porcelain, or to make their own imitations. Moving in the opposite direction ­were techniques and materials: the blue-­and-­white patterns that became so strongly associated with Chinese porcelain ­were enabled by the importing of Persian cobalt to China and Chinese adapting of Persian methods of painting in the ­fourteenth ­century. Blue-­and-­white porcelain was also cheaper to produce and easier to fire than the previously favored celadon imitations of jade, adding a pecuniary incentive for makers to switch styles.6 The addition of tin oxide to lead glazes—­also pioneered in Asia Minor—­made pos­si­ble the opaque, white glazing of lesser-­grade ceramics, such as “Iznik” wares, made in Anatolia from the fifteenth ­century, and “majolica” (named ­after the island of Majorca, where Italian traders acquired tin-­glazed earthenwares from\n\nRe i nve nt i n g th e Rec ip e • 13\n\nAndalusian makers). Usually decorated in strong blues, yellows, and reds, majolica, by the later fifteenth ­century, had already diffused northward with other Re­nais­sance arts. As would be the case for Eu­ro­pean ceramics, experimentation never s­ topped, and ­recipes always varied, depending on local clays and other ingredients. Before East Asian porcelain began to circulate widely in Eu­rope, Eu­ro­pe­ ans could make or purchase many other forms of ceramics. The most h ­ umble ­were unglazed earthenware vessels; stoneware, a more durable form of ceramics that can withstand firing at 1,000–1,200°C, and does not require a glaze, was a bit more costly. At the higher end, craftsmen labored to please noble patrons with ceramics that w ­ ere also works of art, such as the majolica platters that depicted classical or biblical tales, or reproduced famous works of art, and ­were intended for show, not for daily use. Innovation—­ prompted by competition between craftsmen and by the scientific trends of the day—­did not cease; in France, the Huguenot polymath Bernard Palissy made heroic, but unsuccessful, attempts to fire true porcelain, succeeding, however, in making majolica featuring a new palette of colors and unique, naturalistic designs. Meanwhile, in Faenza in northeastern Italy, another version of tin-­glazed earthenware, subsequently known as “faience,” went into large-­scale production. Faience was difficult and expensive to make, as kilns had to be stoked with precious wood to reach the firing temperature of 1,000°C. But ­there ­were ­great advantages. Faience’s smooth surface allows for elaborate overpainting with paints that do not bleed or smear, as was often true of majolica, or melt, as in the case of most early porcelain glazes. It too would quickly diffuse to the north and west, spurring a demand for ceramics that remained, however, pieces for display rather than tableware for regular use. If majolica and faience ­were admired, East Asian porcelain retained the highest rank in luxury ceramics.7 It was more delicate, translucent, and glassy—­but required whiter clays than southern Eu­rope possessed and even higher firing temperatures (1,400°C) to produce. Southern princes found it irresistible, and as in painting, architecture, sculpture, m ­ usic, and food, so too in ceramics, northern princes ­adopted southerners’ tastes. The Medici\n\n14 • Chapte r 1\n\n­were the first g­ reat collectors, followed by Philip II of Spain, whose h ­ ouse­hold by the time of his death in 1598 boasted some three thousand porcelains. Thanks to Sir Francis Drake’s raiding of Spanish ships, Elizabeth I acquired more than fifteen hundred blue-­and-­white pieces for her “Jewel House” in the Tower of London; the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II (r. 1619–37) owned only half as much.8 Commerce, too, first focused on Mediterranean markets, but soon shifted northward where the Dutch found new buyers. In 1608, the Dutch East India com­pany (VOC) imported one hundred thousand pieces of Chinese porcelain, selling some of it domestically, and exporting the rest to continental markets; by the 1630s, the Dutch imports w ­ ere exceeding two hundred thousand pieces per year.9 Despite the disruptions of the Thirty Years’ War and the many other religious and civil conflicts of the period, the volume of the Dutch porcelain trade burgeoned during the next de­cades, reaching by one estimate more than three million pieces imported between 1604 and 1656 for the VOC alone.10 This surge in Eu­ro­pean purchases benefited Chinese producers, who had suffered a downturn in domestic o ­ rders thanks to the Ming Empire’s attempts at economizing. The Chinese ceramicists, who had been catering to the tastes of Ottoman and South Asian buyers for centuries, now varied their production methods to suit the Dutch and En­glish East India Companies. Eu­ro­pe­ ans could order par­tic­u­lar designs or shapes from Chinese makers, though misunderstandings often took place. But just as Eu­ro­pean demand ­rose in the wake of the Thirty Years’ War (1618–48), po­liti­cal conflicts resulting in the fall of the Ming and the rise of the Qing Empire interrupted supply. More severe disruptions occurred in the period 1662–84, when the Qing closed ports and evacuated coastal areas. This shortage in supply led to rising prices for porcelains on the Eu­ro­pean market and the search for substitutes, which ­were found in fine ceramics made in Japan, Vietnam, and Persia, and in Dutch delftware. Although the Chinese “china” trade made a power­ful recovery in the ­later 1680s, the hiatus provided the context in which a flurry of new efforts to duplicate Asian r­ecipes commenced.11 Predictably, the Italians produced the first, best, imitations, generating large quantities of faience by the late\n\nRe i nve nt i n g th e Rec ip e • 15\n\nsixteenth ­century. U ­ nder the patronage of the Medici, Florentine ceramicists also successfully fired a type of ceramics we now call “soft-­paste porcelain,” ­because it is fired at a lower temperature than “true” or hard-­paste porcelain, and has a stronger tendency to slump in the kiln.12 “Soft-­paste” shapes and colors (mostly blue and white) usually imitated the prized Mamluk and Chinese forms already owned by the Medici. It would be this form of porcelain that spread to France by the l­ater seventeenth c­ entury, and inspired many of the Germans’ first efforts at porcelain making. If the Italians succeeded in making the first Eu­ro­pean proto-­porcelains, just as predictably, it was the Dutch who made porcelain imitations a commercial success. Already in 1614 Claes Jansen Sytmans in The Hague received a patent for making porcelain “like that that comes from foreign lands.”13 Working undoubtedly from Chinese models, Sytmans pioneered the firing of a form of blue-­and-­white tin-­glazed earthenware that quickly spread to several locations in the United Provinces. ­After a gunpowder explosion destroyed much of Delft in 1654, many new potteries set up ­here, making it the center of Dutch production, and bequeathing the name “delftware” to the blue-­and-­ white earthenware style. Delftware had the advantage over Medici porcelain or Italian faience of being more easily accessible to northern Eu­ro­pe­ans, and much less expensive; the Dutch rapidly developed the art of something like mass production, at least for their widely admired tiles.14 By 1670, delftware had become sufficiently desirable to support the operation of thirty large, and many more small, workshops in the United Provinces.15 Naturally, delftware too was imitated. Its success seems to have spurred the development of a much wider network of faience factories in the ­later seventeenth ­century, many of them started by Dutch craftsmen. Wherever consumers had a bit more disposable income, in E ­ ngland and the Netherlands in par­tic­ul­ar, ceramics making boomed. In Staffordshire, ­England, the number of potteries tripled between the 1680s and 1750s, and middling Dutch ­house­holds in the l­ater seventeenth c­entury already contained relatively large supplies of delftware and “Kraak.”16 The continent followed suit, though more slowly. Some of the most famous producers w ­ ere the French firms operating in Rouen, Moustiers, Nevers, Marseilles, and\n\n16 • Chapte r 1\n\nSt. Cloud near Paris, but ­there w ­ ere also faience and fine earthenware makers in Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Rus­sia, and the German states. ­These potters already offered a wide se­lection of wares, from lavishly decorated ­grand platters to more modest tableware, and competed with the import market for commissions and sales. Central Eu­rope’s cultural, as well as commercial, debts to the Dutch often go unstated, but in this case it seems clear that the taste for blue-­ and-­white ceramics was spread to German courts chiefly by Dutch princesses such as Louise Henriette of Nassau, wife of Elector Frederick William of Brandenburg-­Prussia, who began serious porcelain collecting already in 1652, and a de­cade ­later designed central Eu­rope’s first “porcelain chamber” in her Oranienburg Palace near Berlin.17 Louise’s s­ister, Henriette Catherine, married a lesser German prince but also insisted on a Dutch-­style palace at Oranienbaum near Dessau, where she installed a Dutch-­tiled summer dining room. (This is by no means the last time that we w ­ ill find ­women acting as tastemakers.) It would be Dutch importers, who began selling East Asian porcelains at the biannual Leipzig fair sometime ­after 1650, who stocked Augustus the Strong’s porcelain cabinet.18 And it would be two Calvinist refugees from the Spanish Netherlands skilled in the making of delftware who founded the first German faience factory in the town of Hanau in 1661. The story of this first founding is instructive, as it demonstrates the interwovenness of “industry” with geography, politics, and religious m ­ atters in the Holy Roman Empire, and sets out a pattern that would be followed by many entrepreneurs and their princely patrons when porcelain making came to the Germanys. Hanau, situated on the Main River near the commercial center of Frankfurt, was at the time legally two cities, one of which had been settled by Calvinist craftsmen, including goldsmiths; our faienciers chose to set up shop among their coreligionists as well as other high-­end tradesmen. As was the common practice of the time, they first had to request an official “privilege” from their sovereign—in this case the Count of Hanau-­Münzenberg—to ply their trade; we must remember that in early modern Eu­rope, ­there was no freedom of l­abor, or of speech, or of movement, as such. Most ­legal entitlements came in the form of such “privileges,” given to par­tic­u­lar individuals\n\nRe i nve nt i n g th e Rec ip e • 17\n\nor groups to perform par­tic­ul­ar duties in par­tic­u­lar places according to par­tic­ul­ ar specifications. In this case, the count was agreeable, undoubtedly hoping that the new business would produce taxable exports and artisanal prestige for his realm. Our craftsmen received a document giving them a twenty-­five-­year mono­poly on faience making in the microstate and tariff-­ free imports of raw materials. By 1675, their workshop employed thirty, an exceptionally large number of craftsmen for the day.19 In 1678, the Elector of Brandenburg bestowed a privilege on another Dutchman, Fransen van der Lee, to establish Berlin’s first faiencerie.20 By 1721, ­there ­were factories in Ansbach, Nurnberg, Bayreuth, and Strassbourg.21 Faience sold wonderfully, and throughout the period covered by this book its producers competed with the porcelain makers for customers and always took the larger market share. In this parallel industry, too, many techniques that would be transferred to porcelain making ­were pioneered. But faience was not porcelain: it was clunkier; it was not translucent; its bodies ­were not perfectly white. And thus, even the success of the faienceries did not slow Eu­ro­pe­ans’ purchases from Asia, or their search for the secret to making “true” porcelain.\n\nWho “Needs” Porcelain? It is commonly, and rightly, said that the demand for porcelain in the eigh­ teenth ­century was closely related to Eu­rope’s rising consumption of exotic hot beverages such as tea, coffee, and choco­late. But it does not follow that utility was the ­mother of invention, and in fact, the reinvention of porcelain had ­little to do with eating and drinking at all. In 1708, when porcelain was first fired in Dresden, only a handful of central Eu­ro­pe­ans had tasted coffee, and only the Dutch and the Ottomans drank theirs in porcelain cups; o ­ thers used silver, as befit a luxury beverage.22 Ordinary ­people in the seventeenth ­century, and in some rural areas as late as the 1880s, ate their meals from one common pot (often iron or copper), dunking their fin­gers or hunks of bread into the soup, or using “trenchers” hewn out of wood instead of bowls or plates.23 Jugs and some cooking vessels might have been made\n\n18 • Chapte r 1\n\nof earthenware. Taverns and inns generally chose pewter—­which did not break—­for individual plates and serving dishes or used wood or tin to serve the cheapest meals. Middling persons who could afford to abandon wood also stocked their kitchens with a combination of pewter, copper, tin, and earthenware, and in early modern depictions we typically find a combination of earthenware jugs, copper molds, and pewter platters arrayed on walls and shelves (see ahead to fig. 2.1). Stout stoneware tankards or jugs might be used by t­hose able to invest in longer-­lasting drinking vessels; faience began to creep in for elite diners from the seventeenth c­ entury. But even the nobility did not at first consider porcelain desirable for the serving of meals. Silver remained de rigueur for most feasts, whose purpose, a­ fter all, was chiefly to impress the guests with the hosts’ wealth and generosity; at most, porcelain might be used for fruit or desserts, or for coffee and tea ­after an elite meal. Eighteenth-­century Eu­ro­pe­ans, then, did not “need” porcelain, at least not for dining. We must look elsewhere to explain the ­factors that led to its invention and rise in popularity, and then trace its adoption for ­domestic uses.24 What the nobility—­virtually the only central Eu­ro­pe­ans capable of purchasing porcelain in the ­later seventeenth c­ entury—­wanted porcelain for was for display, and as a sort of architectural feature, complementing their tapestries, parquet floors, and elaborate mirrors. ­There was pre­ce­dent for this: majolica platters, for example, ­were for display on buffet racks or walls, not for serving food, and at banquets, the prince’s very best silver and gold pieces ­were regularly displayed on shelves to show off his wealth to diners. Similarly, what early noble collectors did with the porcelain vases, pots, or platters was to put them in their cabinets of curiosity, or place them on specially made shelves in specially designed porcelain rooms. That Louise Henriette of Brandenburg-­Prussia, Austria’s Maria Theresa, the Dukes of Saxe-­Gotha-­ Altenburg, and the Margrave of Brandenburg-­Ansbach—to cite just a few tastemakers—­built such rooms indicates that for them, porcelain was an object of admiration and curiosity; its purpose was less to keep tea warm than to complement a world of splendor that included crystal chandeliers, gilded molding, and intricately carved ivories.\n\nRe i nve nt i n g th e Rec ip e • 19\n\nPorcelain’s appeal and functions, then, differed entirely from t­hose of earthenware, and we should not expect potters per se—­with the pos­si­ble exception of a few faience manufacturers—to have been the ones in hottest pursuit of the “secret r­ ecipe.” For the most part, making pottery was a local industry, for transporting heavy, breakable, and inexpensive vessels by wagons over Eu­rope’s rutted roads or treacherous (and tariff-­ridden) rivers made ­little sense. In towns and cities guilds determined production, but “Töpfer” or “Hafner” ­were never among the most highly respected of guildsmen, for making an earthenware pot is not a terribly difficult exercise and the materials neither scarce nor costly. A determined layperson with a stout stick could extract clay from the ground—­well-­traveled roadways ­were favored spots to dig, as they revealed the patches of clay clearly; hence our term “pot hole.”25 Along with earthenware jugs and bowls, skilled potters did make more sophisticated decorative items such as beer steins and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal jars, and a few makers, such as the stoneware masters of the Westerwald region, ­were known for their high-­quality products throughout Eu­rope. But ­these ceramics makers operated in markets catering to the everyday needs of peasants, innkeepers, brewers, middling townspersons; they had ­little hope, or ambition, to rival Chinese porcelain makers, with whom, at least ­until the ­later eigh­teenth ­century, they w ­ ere not in competition. Rather than look to the suppliers, then, we need to look to the patrons, and the potential customers for the luxury wares to be produced if the ­recipe could fi­nally be found: and this, in central Eu­rope in par­tic­u­lar, meant the Holy Roman Empire’s many princes, and their courts.\n\nCourt Culture at the Dawn of the Porcelain Age As James Sheehan has beautifully described it, the social experience of living in the early modern Holy Roman Empire was one of extreme social fragmentation; language, customs, styles of dress, diets, and, a­ fter the 1520s, religious beliefs varied so much between regions that as late as 1765, in traveling the approximately 250 miles from his native Frankfurt to the city of Leipzig, Goethe’s clothes, manners, and speech made him seem to locals to\n\n20 • Chapte r 1\n\nhave “dropped down out of another world.”26 The vast majority of the Empire’s inhabitants, moreover, made their living from agriculture and, at least ­until the dawn of the nineteenth c­ entury, survived, if they did, in producing for and buying from highly localized markets. No one would have dreamed that ­these central Eu­ro­pe­ans would have the means, taste, or opportunity to purchase porcelain. On the other hand, thanks to its po­liti­cal fragmentation, the Holy Roman Empire was also home to many wealthy (and many more not so wealthy) princes. Rich Renaissance-­era German rulers, high-­ranking noblemen, and bankers—­Emperor Rudolf II, for example, or the Fuggers—­could and did commission intricate masterpieces made by local craftsmen as well as purchase imported luxury goods from Dutch and Armenian traders, and from agents located in Rome, Amsterdam, and Paris. The sixteenth-­century wars of religion, however, and even more importantly, the devastating Thirty Years’ War decimated sources of income and bud­gets for many central Eu­ ro­pean nobles. While France, ­England, and the Netherlands w ­ ere able to recover quickly from ­these midcentury bloodlettings, it took central Eu­ rope, where some areas had lost nearly half their prewar population, considerably longer to rebound. In the era when Charles II and above all Louis XIV began investing huge sums in luxurious living and display, central Eu­ ro­pean princes put their fortunes chiefly into building standing armies. Only in the very late seventeenth and early eigh­teenth centuries ­were most able to think seriously about renovating their palaces or offering new entertainments at court. This does not mean, however, that German princes ­were not carefully watching what was happening elsewhere, in Italy, France, and the Netherlands. Medici princes and the Spanish kings, as we have seen, already had large porcelain collections, and intermarriages between German nobles and princesses from the h ­ ouse of Orange-­Nassau spread the taste for blue-­and-­ white ceramics to central Eu­ro­pean palaces. ­Those who visited Versailles—­ including the young Augustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony (and also king of Poland, 1697–1706 and 1709–33)—­had the opportunity to see a ­great deal of porcelain, including Louis le Vau’s “Trianon de Porcelaine,” built in\n\nRe i nve nt i n g th e Rec ip e • 2 1\n\nthe 1670s as a private rendezvous for Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan, and decorated with blue-­and-­white tiles as well as Asian porcelains.27 By the seventeenth ­century’s close it had become de rigueur to sprinkle stately rooms with Chinese lidded jars and elaborate delftware tulip vases. Sophie Charlotte, Electress of Brandenburg (and ­after 1701, queen of Prus­sia), took this much further and used her pre­de­ces­sor’s collection to wall­paper a ­whole room (plate 1).28 Completed in 1695, Charlottenburg Palace, built by Frederick III, soon to be Frederick I, king in Prus­sia, was one of the first of the new German royal “residences.” The early eigh­teenth ­century saw the widespread building of similar baroque palaces in locations such as Ansbach and Würzburg and the appearance of a string of new Versailles knock-­offs such as Nymphenburg, near Munich, and Schönbrunn, near Vienna. The Holy Roman Empire, a­ fter all, had 330 or so affiliated states, ruled by electors, prince-­ bishops, dukes, f­ ree knights, and other princelings, all of whom wanted their own, estimable residences. Po­liti­cal, cultural, and economic centers, their new palaces, moreover, increasingly came to be divided into more specialized and more private rooms, with symbolic or fash­ion­able décor. ­There ­were Chinese murals in several rooms at the Oranienbaum Palace near Halle, and dedicated porcelain rooms at Nymphenburg, Schönbrunn, and Friedenstein (Gotha), among o ­ thers, updating the centuries’ old practice of displaying silver and gold vessels in feasting locations. Augustus II, who visited Versailles in the late 1680s and the Prus­sian palaces at Charlottenburg and Oranienburg in 1709, would take this conceit to a new level of extravagance in the plans for his “Japa­nese” Palace (see below) and in the many Asian details carried out in his plea­sure gardens at Pillnitz. Frederick the G ­ reat, for his part, would l­ ater turn the convention inside out, putting the chinoiseries on the exterior of his tea­house at Sans Souci. Royal architects such as Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach in Austria and Mattäus Daniel Pöppelmann in Prus­sia would also include Chinese motifs among their designs. The imitation of Chinese porcelains was deeply linked to this courtly decorative fad. As the number of new palaces grew, so too did the quantity of courtiers and the luxuriousness of their accommodations and entertainments. In the\n\n22 • Chapte r 1\n\ncourse of the early eigh­teenth ­century, staff and supplicants at German-­ speaking courts increased appreciably, with Augustus’s Saxon entourage, for example, doubling in size from 460 in 1700 to more than seven hundred in 1730. Augustus periodically treated his courtiers and guests to g­ reat feasts, where spectators, too, w ­ ere invited to watch the king strengthen himself with food and drink. Augustus kept a menagerie and held lavish h ­ orse and animal parades known as “carousel,” as well as barbaric bouts of “fox tossing,” in which courtiers holding the ends of large cloths threw foxes and other animals into the air ­until they expired—or, uncomfortably, landed on one of the tossers.29 Like other princes, Augustus bought rich clothing, books, imported furnishings, clocks, works of art, exotic foodstuffs—­and ceramics, chiefly, it seems, from Dutch importers,30 notorious for their willingness to please all palates. Expenses at the court consumed a goodly portion of state budgets—​ 12.4 ­percent of the Habsburg bud­get in 1700, and a whopping 36 ­percent of the Electoral Palatinate’s expenses a bit ­later in the ­century.31 Banquets for weddings, coronations, festivals, and royal visits—­which could sometimes last for days—­became more habitual and more lavish. At such banquets, it was customary to advertise the host’s wealth and power by displaying the h ­ ouse­hold’s silver on dining-­room shelves; at Joseph II’s coronation banquet in 1764, as Martin von Meytens’s beautiful painting shows, the room was wallpapered with silver and gold vessels. The emperor and ­family dined on gold, their guests on silver; although the t­ ables ­were set in the newly fash­ion­able à la française manner (see chapter 3), porcelain was not yet good enough for such a g­ rand occasion (plate 2). As Daniel Roche—­and Norbert Elias before him—­emphasized, this form of luxury consumption had primarily po­liti­cal functions: to display the monarch’s power and to reinforce re­spect for authority.32 This was, ­after all, the age of “absolutism.” And if one could show oneself a ­great prince through display rather than warfare, that was an appealing alternative. Thus the expansion of courtly luxury in the era of absolutism provides the most impor­tant context for new attempts to imitate East Asian porcelain, a luxury good chiefly used for display. But the absolutist state had\n\nRe i nve nt i n g th e Rec ip e • 23\n\nanother urgent imperative to accomplish: the creation of new revenue streams that would support the replacement of mercenaries with standing armies. Standing armies ­were extremely costly, as they required perpetual upkeep as well as provisioning with standard-­issue weapons, uniforms, and powder; new bureaucracies w ­ ere needed to manage the bud­gets and coordinate conscription, training, and the distribution of supplies. To fill their coffers, the states of central Eu­rope ­adopted what was to be the first form of national economic policy, known as mercantilism. Associated with Louis XIII’s finance minister, Jean-­Baptiste Colbert, mercantilism, a philosophy as well as a policy, aspired to keep liquid currency—­silver and gold—­within the prince’s borders. The appeal of such a policy accelerated in the l­ ater seventeenth c­ entury as the need for expensive armies increased. Colbert’s policy called for discouraging imports and encouraging the production of commodities, and especially luxury goods, at home. Overseas colonies ­were to be founded to produce raw materials and to provide markets for finished goods. Very high tariffs ­were to be applied to imports, and more efficient taxation exerted so that the state could fund its army and subsidize industries or trading enterprises that the prince wanted to keep at home, such as the manufacturing of armaments—or porcelain.\n\nPorcelain in the Age of Mercantilist Modernization It would be a fool’s errand to generalize about “the” economy of the Holy Roman Empire in the early modern period, as each of the 330-­odd principalities had its own peculiarities, dependent on size, location (with re­spect to rivers, raw materials, and bordering states), number of urban areas, and po­liti­cal and religious configurations.33 In the ­later seventeenth c­ entury, Saxony—­blessed with rich mines; impor­tant trading centers such as Leipzig, Dresden, and Pirna; and a power­ful monarch—­played in an entirely dif­fer­ ent economic league than did the much poorer and more rural Eastern Pomerania, or the tiny and powerless Lordship of Eglofs. We can say that the Empire was overwhelmingly a world of peasants—­only about 2 ­percent of the population lived in towns over ten thousand, and even by 1800 only\n\n24 • Chapte r 1\n\n4 ­percent did so: quite a contrast with the United Provinces, where urbanization had already topped 40 ­percent in the seventeenth ­century.34 Many of ­these peasants remained en-­serfed, and the large majority lived at subsistence levels, especially ­after 1550, as too much Spanish silver chased too few loaves of bread. Just as most central Eu­ro­pe­ans ­were peasants, most of the region’s capital was in land, or in servants and serfs, although t­ here ­were rich court cities such as Vienna, Dresden, Prague, and Braunschweig, thick with artisans, clergymen, and nobles. The Holy Roman Empire was also home to some successful commercial entrepôts, such as Hamburg, Frankfurt, and Leipzig, whose annual Easter fair featured goods from Asia and the Amer­i­cas as well as from western Eu­rope and Rus­sia. In glassmaking, mining, and metalworking, central Eu­ro­pe­ans could even rival peers in ­England, Italy, and France. Yet in its level of investment in agricultural improvements or in small industries such as silk weaving or shipbuilding, the region as a w ­ hole was already ­behind the Low Countries, ­England, and France when the Thirty Years’ War commenced in 1618. In this terrible conflict, bad weather, disease, and the depredations of mercenaries exacerbated the horrors of a war fought mostly on central Eu­ro­pean territory. When peace fi­nally arrived in 1648, hundreds of villages and towns had been decimated, their princes now staggering ­under enormous debts, incurred in part by the hiring of so many mercenaries. It was time to get the states’ finances in order, if only to be able to afford a standing army for the next time around. ­Here we can identify the importance of state building and army building in the wake of the Thirty Years’ War even to such a seemingly remote issue as the search for a Eu­ro­pean porcelain ­recipe. For it was that devastating war and its dislocations that inspired the German princes of central Eu­rope to adopt their own versions of Colbert’s mercantilism. Although Colbert’s policy was originally a war­time mea­sure, it made sense ­after the war ended too. At a time in which speculators with spare cash ­were few, and largely confined their interests to currency trading or overseas ventures, state investment in manufacturing was one way to get local production moving, in the directions and places the prince thought it should move. The furthering of\n\nRe i nve nt i n g th e Rec ip e • 25\n\nhome “manufactures” or “Industrie,” by which officials meant small-­scale, low-­tech, and unguilded workshop production, was also a way to put impoverished ­people to work and to reduce their dependence on their local lords, the church, or state charity. Prus­sia’s state-­subsidized wool-­making factory, for example, employed soldiers during peacetime to provide them with the means of subsistence.35 Central Eu­ro­pean states in par­tic­u­lar found this modernizing method appealing—­although applying French policies would have unintended consequences. Farming, animal husbandry, and metalworking formed especially impor­ tant sectors of the economy and ­were everywhere subsidized or subjected to state intervention or both to a greater or lesser extent. But the first two of ­these sectors ­were too large and diverse to be completely state dominated or funded, and the latter was controlled by a variety of guilds, silversmiths, clockmakers, armaments producers, and so on. The luxury trades, on the other hand, w ­ ere especially favored in ­these state business ventures, for they did double duty. Not only did making luxuries at home reduce costly imports, but their production reflected the refinement of the prince’s court and could be touted as providing domestic artisans and consumers a series of lessons in good taste.36 Moreover, the luxury trade was smaller, more concentrated, and easier to control. Many of the luxuries—­silk, velvet, coffee, sugar—­were purchased almost exclusively by courtiers, and sometimes even forbidden to commoners by sumptuary laws, which ­limited non-­noble purchasing of some goods, partly in paternalist attempts to prevent reckless spending on non-­necessities and partly to maintain bound­aries between status groups. As such laws lapsed, however, and German nobles accumulated the funds to procure more luxury items, producing ­these commodities at home became more and more attractive. Introducing mercantile policies into central Eu­rope, however, was no easy ­matter. Mercantile mea­sures that sought to pull money and power to the state center flew in the face of a decentralized “Society of O ­ rders,” in which nobles, towns, and ecclesiastical institutions jealously guarded their time-­ honored l­egal privileges and local economic power. Landlords lived off land rents and the ­labor of their serfs, and only a few ­were willing or able to\n\n26 • Chapte r 1\n\nconsider investing in new industries. ­There ­were plenty of small workshops, but few with sufficient capital or ­legal status to expand without state assistance. Local guilds stood in their way; it is estimated that as late as 1800, half of western German output was still controlled by guildsmen,37 and they continued to be hostile to would-be entrepreneurs. The guilds did not control ­labor in the countryside, however, which partly explains why mercantile manufacturing began ­there, ­either in small factories making, for example, glass or iron, or in the form of “cottage” textile production. Moreover, the vital mercantile tactic of establishing overseas colonies was largely closed to central Eu­ro­pean states, which entered the race late, and without much verve. This was perhaps the result of geo­graph­i­cal fragmentation, a lack of deep-­pocketed speculators, or simply princes whose ambitions ran only to continental power and influence. A few of the Hanseatic cities did have ships and trading expertise, most noteworthy among which was the imperial f­ ree city of Hamburg. But Hamburg was too small to compete with ­Great Britain, or France. The gigantic Habsburg Empire did not have a major seaport u ­ ntil the annexation of Trieste ­after the Napoleonic Wars; and Trieste was a Mediterranean port, more suited to trading with the Ottomans and North Africans than with the Atlantic or Pacific worlds. Prus­sia spent much of the eigh­teenth ­century trying to establish and consolidate its territorial holdings to the east. ­There ­were a few tepid attempts at founding East or West India companies, but most fizzled; Denmark, with holdings in the Indian Ocean and the West Indies, was perhaps the most successful of the Germanic colonizers. But only the post-1871 German Empire would succeed in developing the long-­range maritime commerce and naval power sufficient to sustain a major colonial empire. Within the Holy Roman Empire, commerce was complicated and the application of mercantile modernizing strategies halting. Rivers t­here ­were plentiful; but without canals to connect them, many of them w ­ ere difficult to navigate. Roads and bridges, too, w ­ ere in poor shape, and they w ­ ere riddled with an estimated eigh­teen hundred tollbooths—­sixty-­seven in Prus­sia alone! The states employed dif­fer­ent weights and mea­sures and extracted their fees in a dizzying array of local currencies.38 All ­these ­factors made it difficult\n\nRe i nve nt i n g th e Rec ip e • 27\n\nfor states to regulate trade; the many smaller and larger wars of the period simply exacerbated the prob­lem. Given the impossibility of policing so many borders, smuggling of all sorts was ubiquitous, especially as the German-­ speaking nobility, although relatively poor, was e­ ager to purchase French, En­glish, and Italian luxuries. All t­hese f­actors—­the Empire’s comparative infrastructural inferiority, the small scale of its enterprises, the difficulty of accumulating liquid capital, the extreme diversity of its mea­sure­ments, and its porous borders—­made getting a toehold in the global marketplace difficult even for central Eu­rope’s larger and richer states. And yet, by the mid-­eighteenth ­century central Eu­ro­pean princes had indeed set about introducing modernizing plans on the mercantilist model—­ which went hand in hand with po­liti­cal absolutism—­into their domains. Taxes and tariffs ­were reformed in order to protect domestic wares from foreign competition, and in many cases their collection was taken over by the state, to the dissatisfaction of local officials and smugglers. Recognizing that most nobles ­were land rich and cash poor, German princes founded enterprises themselves, or bribed, cajoled, or even strong-­armed their courtiers into ­doing so. To sweeten the pot, would-be entrepreneurs or investors ­were offered special privileges, including monopolies on domestic sales and reduced materials or transportation costs. Rather frequently ­these efforts backfired when ­those same courtiers dumped their unprofitable enterprises back in the prince’s lap.39 To encourage manufacturing, German princes also lured skilled craftsmen from France, Switzerland, and the Low Countries, regardless of their religious affiliations, to their domains—we can recall ­here the experience of our Hanau faienciers. Skilled ­labor, ­after all, produced items of higher value, which could be more profitably taxed. The general effect was indeed to increase manufacturing and commerce in selected spheres, but also to diminish the local economic autonomy of towns and guilds for the benefit of the princely states. On the other hand, sometimes in order to win cooperation with ­these new forms of taxation, conscription, and regulation, princes w ­ ere forced to renew some local privileges, to limit cross-­border trade, and in the East, to give landlords expanded rights over their serfs.40\n\n28 • Chapte r 1\n\nMercantilism was by no means an ideal way to modernize the economy. Increased taxes squelched private investment from non-­state-­funded actors, even as they took money away from lower-­end buyers who might other­wise have been able to consume more.41 The mercantile system subsidized ventures that now seem slightly silly—­such as Carolus Linnaeus’s forlorn attempts to grow pineapples in Sweden. Some of ­these experiments proved to be exorbitantly expensive, such as Prus­sia’s attempts to found a silk industry. They also might have downstream consequences for t­hose tasked with administering them. Thus when an unusually daring state official reported to Frederick the ­Great that Prus­sian silk was of poor quality and ­wouldn’t sell, the king was sufficiently incensed to put the hapless truth teller in Spandau prison.42 Heavy-­handed state interventions into the marketplace often resulted in fraud, mismanagement, and the artificial protection and preservation of obsolete or unprofitable industries long ­after free-­market forces would have killed them off. But the historical real­ity is that state-­led modernization was what the decision makers of the day believed was necessary, and for better and for worse that is the direction they chose. Albeit in a piecemeal and halting fashion, mercantilism did help to modernize central Europe—­naturally in its own way. Tax revenues increased, and princes built new fortifications, standing armies, and palaces intended to display their wealth and power. In a world where most wealthy persons still put their capital into land, serfs, ­horses, and banquets rather than into the founding of commercial or manufacturing enterprises, state intervention did introduce some new liquidity, even as it tended to corrode local economic privileges—­such the “closed shop” enforced by the guilds, the long-­standing consumption taxes exacted by the towns, and the domination of the ­labor market by the nobles. State officials found themselves, unwittingly, furthering religious toleration when, in cajoling foreign craftsmen to relocate into German lands, they extended privileges, if not rights, to minority populations. And although it disrupted older patterns of employment, state-­led investment provided jobs at a time of population growth and made some regions exporters of finished goods, allowing a rise in the standard of living and the purchasing of new consumer items in return.43 Mercantilism also\n\nRe i nve nt i n g th e Rec ip e • 2 9\n\nstimulated competition between states, which, at least in some cases, produced innovation. In the end, we cannot say that mercantilism was the best choice for the princes’ bottom line: but the bottom line was not, for ­these rulers, the be all and end all. For most, showing oneself to be in command of a “refined” state with a sufficient army and an obedient, tax-­paying population mattered more. Could the ­recipe for porcelain have been discovered, and an industry founded, without the support of princes? The answer to the first part of this hy­po­thet­i­cal question is a clear yes, and to the second, a provisional no. Artisans working without state support had made many smaller and larger technical discoveries over the centuries, perfecting glass-­bead making, for example, or grinding better and better optical lenses. Craft practices had always depended on an unstable combination of secrecy and sharing of information, and “invention” could be a ­matter of serendipity. One English potter’s son described his sudden insight, in applying to his ­horse’s infected eye a white powder given to him by a stable boy: this substance might make a wonderful faience glaze!44 This is prob­ably an apocryphal story, but it draws on the real­ity that ­there ­were plenty of ­people tinkering with clay ­recipes and glazes long before porcelain makers came on the scene. It is not impossible that a Dutch, French, or En­glish artisan might have hit on a workable ­recipe. In fact, in the case of some craftsmen at work in the small states that now make up Thuringia, it seems that several did (see chapter 2). The magic “­recipe” was, in any case, not just a s­ imple list of ingredients; in addition to specifying the components of the paste and the glaze, the Arcanum included the know-­how necessary to build a kiln able to fire at a steady, very high temperature. As clay, w ­ ater, pebbles, and sand varied across regions, mixtures always required tinkering. Contrary to its reputation, ­there was, in the end, no single, secret formula for porcelain, and many dif­fer­ent ­recipes could and did succeed.45 But could a r­ ecipe, once fired successfully, have been parlayed into an industry without state support? By industry ­here one would have to mean the continuous production of a single commodity, especially as pursued by more than one workshop, and in pursuit of a translocal market. Founding an\n\n30 • Chapte r 1\n\nindustry of this sort might have been pos­si­ble in the Netherlands or ­England, places where the guilds ­were now defunct, where direct state intervention into the economy was minor, and where producers enjoyed relatively large and wealthy consumer bases. In fact, both places did have their own comparable industries, which employed many, and did not need state support: delftware on the one hand, and Staffordshire fine earthenware on the other. When porcelain came along, it had to compete with ­these other, established ceramic products for esteem as well as for resources. ­These states, too, had long traditions of importing Asian wares, at low prices, and their aristocracies seem to have been less desperate to imitate the excesses of the French court. The Dutch did establish two porcelain manufactories, at Weesp and The Hague, but neither had much success. The En­glish eventually founded numerous private firms making “bone china” or porcelain with a dif­fer­ent clay mixture, but ­these firms ­were never so profitable as the Staffordshire potteries (which would include Wedgwood), nor so closely linked to courtly self-­representation as were the German firms. Thus was porcelain, as a product and as an industry, quite a dif­fer­ent animal than it would be in central Eu­rope. It is difficult to see how the Holy Roman Empire might have broken into the international market for fine ceramics without the patronage of deeppocketed princes. Indeed, given the political and economic conditions described above, it is hard to imagine how that would have been pos­si­ble. Only a few states had the wherewithal to support the vital, and as it turned out, lengthy, experiments necessary to discover the r­ ecipe, and to cover the startup costs of an industry in which t­ here was, especially at the outset, much wastage. Among the Empire’s polities, Electoral Saxony had g­ reat advantages; boasting long traditions of mining and assaying, glassmaking and alchemy, it was home to many craftsmen skilled in working at high temperatures, something vital to making hard-­paste porcelain, which needed to be fired first at about 900°C and then again (­after glazing) at 1,400–1,500°C, for as long as two days’ time. This largest Saxon state was also abundantly endowed with crucial raw materials—­kaolin clay, alabaster, and wood. Fi­ nally, most of Saxony’s wealth and resources lay in the hands of its prince, Elector Augustus II (r. 1694–1733), who was also titular king of Poland from\n\nRe i nve nt i n g th e Rec ip e • 3 1\n\n1697 to 1706, and again from 1709 u ­ ntil his death in 1733. Augustus was already a g­ reat collector of exotic luxuries—­including jeweled drinking vessels in the shape of stags, intricately carved cherry pits, and an enormous collection of Asian porcelain.46 Yet the birth of the Saxon porcelain industry was not in the first instance the result of an attempt to take advantage of Augustus’s self-­confessed “porcelain sickness.” It was the result, in fact, of the prince’s longing to bring an even more lucrative industry to his state: the making of gold.\n\nThe Saxon Success Story In the social world of the Old Regime, Johann Friedrich Böttger (1682–1719) was a nobody, one of the members of the Third Estate who, as the French reformer Abbé Emmanuel de Sieyès would ­later complain, counted for nothing even though their work formed the foundation for the state’s wealth. Yet Böttger was lucky enough to have been born the son of the mintkeeper in Schleiz (then one of the Empire’s tiniest microstates), and to have relatives willing and able to help him; in early modern society, f­ amily resources ­were crucial to individuals’ success. When Johann’s f­ ather lost his job, the ­family moved to the Prus­sian town of Magdeburg, to share quarters with his b ­ rother, a prosperous goldsmith. ­After his ­father’s death, Johann was again fortunate in his stepfather, a well-­to-do engineer and bureaucrat who could afford to give Johann what was for the time a very good bourgeois education and pay for his apprenticeship to an apothecary in Berlin. ­Here the ambitious teenager demonstrated an aptitude for experiment—­and a penchant for ignoring rules. His apprenticeship brought him into contact with a number of men engaged in the alchemical search for the phi­los­o­pher’s stone, the mineral compound that, it was believed, could be combined with base metals to make gold. Böttger, too, became obsessed with this quest. Having received some ingredients and instructions from a mysterious, wandering Greek monk, this swaggering nobody made a fateful boast: while the wisest of scholars for centuries had failed in this esoteric endeavor, he had discovered the secret to making gold.47\n\n32 • Chapte r 1\n\nBöttger’s boast was not so implausible at the time. Suffused with mystical and magical ele­ments, alchemy nonetheless counted as a “science,” and like Böttger’s Berlin friends, many of the leading scientists of the day, including Sir Isaac Newton, expended much energy and effort in the hopes that their alchemical experiments would succeed. Moreover, investment in alchemical research made sense, above all for nations experienced in smelting precious metals, but also for poorer states seeking a quick fix for depleted trea­suries.48 Evidently Böttger’s demonstrations ­were convincing enough that rumors began to spread, and in 1701 they reached the ears of the Prus­sian elector (soon to become Frederick I, king in Prus­sia), ­eager to employ an alchemist to help him make more gold to finance his lavish tastes, his sizable army, and his big debts. Frederick commanded Böttger to report to him in Berlin. Fearful he would be punished for his magic tricks, Böttger abandoned his apprenticeship and went into hiding—­and then made a dash for the border. This put him beyond the long arm of the Prus­sian elector but regrettably delivered him into the clutches of Saxony’s elector Augustus the Strong, who was also in ­great need of funds, to feed his collecting habits as well as to keep himself on the Polish throne. On learning that an alchemist had entered his territory, Augustus promptly had Böttger arrested, with the same aims as ­those of his Hohenzollern neighbor. To prevent the young alchemist from being kidnapped by Prus­sian soldiers or from ­running away, Augustus now locked him in a Saxon prison. The prisoner was comfortably accommodated and provided with materials, books, and lavish meals; he was allowed to entertain many of the state’s leading scholars, including the se­nior scientist and courtier Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus. Meanwhile, the Saxon elector impatiently awaited news that his real-­life Rumpelstiltskin had turned dross into gold.49 Augustus wanted Böttger to succeed. Perhaps, as the fictional porcelain fancier of Bruce Chatwin’s novel Utz claims, the elector credited some of the more esoteric alchemical theories and hoped his prisoner would discover the secret of immortality.50 The evidence, however, suggests that Augustus simply wanted Böttger to make him piles of gold. But making gold, it turned out, required steep initial investments, and by 1703, Augustus had already\n\nRe i nve nt i n g th e Rec ip e • 33\n\nplunged forty thousand taler into this endeavor: the equivalent of a very respectable annual wage for some four thousand men.51 It was only in this year, however, perhaps thanks to Tschirnhaus’s intervention, that Böttger was allowed to depart his gilded cage, and move operations to the Goldhaus, a fully equipped alchemist’s laboratory just meters from the electoral palace in Dresden. ­Here Böttger had access to the latest equipment and to a fully stocked scientific library; he was also allowed to hire some skilled craftsmen to assist him. He moved into apartments in the palace and was given space for a billiards room and freedom to walk in the palace gardens, although if he got too close to the gate, his guards ­were instructed to shoot pellets at him from a blowpipe.52 Böttger’s move to the Goldhaus enabled him to do better science, but it was his collaboration with the much older Tschirnhaus (1651–1708) that was crucial to his scholarly success, and saved him from execution for having perpetrated a fraud. A skilled mathematician and chemist, the Silesian-­ born Tschirnhaus had studied medicine, mineralogy, chemistry, and philosophy at the University of Leiden. He had then proceeded to Paris, where he took a job as tutor to Colbert’s son, fell ­under the spell of mercantilist ideas, and was introduced to experiments in porcelain making. In Louis XIV’s capital and in the course of his travels he had also befriended experts in the chemical properties of glass. He had made intensive studies of burning mirrors, which enabled the melting and assaying of materials at high temperatures. Linked to the Saxon court by his wife’s connections, the cosmopolitan Tschirnhaus had settled in Dresden, and become one of a number of scholars at Augustus’s court. Like the leading scientists of the day, Tschirnhaus was interested in alchemy, but he prioritized the practical, po­liti­cal aim of improving Saxon industries such as marble polishing, glassblowing, and, if pos­si­ble, porcelain making. By 1694 at the latest he was using his burning lenses to melt delftware and Chinese porcelain in pursuit of its r­ ecipe. In 1701–2, he arranged visits to St. Cloud in France and to delftware workshops in the Netherlands, and he learned about French experiments with mixtures using eggshells, snail shells, and chalk. Tschirnhaus himself pioneered a pro­cess to fuse chalk and quartz, a pro­cess at the heart of porcelain\n\n34 • Chapte r 1\n\nmaking,53 and he was unhappy to leave aside his own proj­ects when Augustus tasked him with speeding up Böttger’s science. But assisting this “nobody” gave him the opportunity to explore high-­temperature firing, and the development of ceramic crucibles for gold making was an enterprise this odd ­couple could work on in tandem. When, in May 1706, they succeeded in turning out a hard, red ceramic paste that resembled the Yixing porcelains already in Augustus’s and other princely collections, it was surely Tschirnhaus who recognized that the right r­ ecipe for the most desired white porcelain was within reach, and who persuaded both Böttger and the elector to pursue this more probable concoction while putting the longer-­term proj­ect of making gold on the back burner.54 We should not, however, diminish the contributions made by our nobody. As Ursula Klein has shown, most apothecary shops contained something known even in the l­ater seventeenth c­ entury as “laboratories,” and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal production in t­hese shops overlapped a g­ reat deal with academic chemistry.55 Böttger, by all accounts, was a chemical prodigy and, by dint of many failed efforts, became an expert kiln builder, a highly impor­tant part of his “magic.” Thus Böttger was the inventive technician and hands-on experimenter, Tschirnhaus, his scholarly con­sul­tant. They set to work, officially in pursuit of gold, but increasingly of the porcelain r­ ecipe. Augustus allowed them the assistance of five craftsmen from Freiburg im Breisgau, experienced in mining and assaying, who tested compound a­ fter compound.56 Their work was interrupted by Böttger’s removal to the Königstein prison in 1706–7, when Saxony was occupied by the Swedes; Augustus did not want his Rumpelstiltskin captured by another greedy king. But when in 1707 work commenced again in Dresden, the team devoted itself to perfecting the vitrified red stoneware that would subsequently be known as Böttger stoneware, as well as to formulating the elusive ­recipe for the most coveted white porcelain. At this point it was perhaps the input of the chemist and mining expert Gottfried Pabst von Ohaim, another courtier Augustus had assigned to the gold-­making proj­ect, that mattered most. Böttger and Tschirnhaus had been using good quality clay from Colditz, near Leipzig; Pabst suggested seeking\n\nRe i nve nt i n g th e Rec ip e • 35\n\ncalcified clay and pebbles to make a white paste, and he is prob­ably the one who located a v­ iable clay near the town of Aue in the Erzgebirge, on the estate of one Veit Hans Schnorr von Scheeberg.57 This very white clay—­ kaolin, composed heavi­ly of aluminum silicate—­was already known to courtiers, as it had been marketed as a wig powder. When combined with Colditz clay (43 ­percent each) and alabaster (14 ­percent) it proved plastic enough to form a proper “paste.”58 This, then, was fi­nally the “Arcanum,” whose name carried with it strong whiffs of magic, and whose mixing could be accomplished only by the few initiates who came to be called “arcanists.” "
