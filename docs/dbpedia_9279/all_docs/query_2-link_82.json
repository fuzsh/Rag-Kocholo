U.S. 50. The fest is free and open to the public, and features wine, live music, food, chili roasting, arts and crafts vendors and a fun zone for kids.\n\nThe Harvest Fest will begin with the traditional Blessing of the Harvest by Fr. Jesse Perez, of St. Michaels’ Catholic Church. He has been the priest there for three years, and before that nurtured the congregation in Leadville. He was born in raised in Salida, and has close ties to Florence as well.\n\nKicking off the day’s music will be Hammerstadt Fusion of the Soul. A local favorite from Colorado Springs, they will be performing from 10 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Hammerstadt is a four-piece electric ensemble, with a repertoire of blues, rock, jazz and fusion music.\n\nTaking the stage at 2 p.m., Cañon City’s own Deja Bluz will bust it out with their classic rock and roll sounds. Brothers Dan and Glenn McCarter have been playing together since 2002, but it was Glenn and friend Rick Kamerzell, who started the band 25 years ago. Glenn and Rick are both original members of the Belvedere Blues Band, and their other band member, Tom Mallory, is a classically trained woodwind musician from California.\n\nAt 10 a.m. Sept. 25, the festival will begin with the mellow sounds of Mistura Bela, of Denver. Meaning ‘Beautiful Mixture,’ this group is well known for their Brazilian sambas and Latin and jazz standards. They will take the stage from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.\n\nClosing the show on Sunday afternoon is the raucous and crowd-pleasing Inman Brothers Band, who will take the stage at 1:30 p.m. From grand stands at the state fair to music festivals up and down the Front Range, they are a Colorado favorite. Founded in the late 70’s, the 5 piece southern rock band is based in Colorado Springs.\n\nFor more information, call the winery at 719-276-5191 or 877-422-9463 (HCA-WINE), or email info@abbeywinery.com.\n\nAnnual Art & Antique Auction slated for Sept. 30\n\nThe fourth annual Art & Antique Auction will be at 6 p.m. Sept. 30 at the Bell Tower Cultural Center, located at 201 E. 2nd St. in Florence. The preview begins at 4 p.m. The event will feature noted regional artists and antique dealers consigning some of their best work for this fundraiser to help pay for a new roof on this historic building. A special feature of the auction will be the sale of 12 small wooden boxes suitable for holding treasures or becoming treasures themselves. Refreshments and food will be available.\n\nCommunity invited to Recital Series at Christ Episcopal Church\n\nThe Recital Series at Christ Episcopal Church will be at 2 p.m. Sept. 24 at Christ Episcopal Church, located at 802 Harrison Ave. The recital presents: Michaela Paetsch – Violin; Janice Saffir – Piano; JS Bach – Solo Violin Sonata in A Minor; Ludwig Von Beethoven/Michaela Paetsch – Solo Cadenzas of the Violin Concerto; George Boulanger – Gypsy Dance; and music by Franz Schubert, Fritz Kreisler, Joseph Haydyn, Johannes Brahms, Michaela Paetsch, Bela Bartok, Astor Piazzola and Pablo de Sarasate.\n\nA “Meet and Greet” reception will follow the performance.
