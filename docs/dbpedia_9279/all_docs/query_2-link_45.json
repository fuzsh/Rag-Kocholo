        "text": "Discussion\n\nThe main findings of this study are (1) the fully automated resting phase detection worked successfully in patients, (2) the time to decision for the neural network detection was shorter than that by manual detection, (3) the resting phase measured by the neural network was similar to that of the expert, and (4) the error was lower in the case of the neural network than in the case of the general operator. Therefore, the neural network achieved the objectives of this study, and it can determine the resting phase instantly with better accuracy than that of manual detection by general operators.\n\nThe automated RCA detection was sufficiently accurate to determine the RCA for motion detection. For RCA detection, a 3D-DenseNet-based network that uses separable spatiotemporal convolution and feature gating in an effective video classification system was applied to the proposed architecture. Manual detection required approximately 1 min to determine the resting phase, whereas the 3D DenseNet-based network could identify the RCA immediately because this system combines three key concepts: a top-heavy model design, temporally separable convolution, and spatiotemporal feature gating.11 A balance between speed and accuracy is important when building a neural network system and our network achieved both speed and accuracy. There was a significant difference only at the end points, but the mean bias was small (−36.3 ms), and the normalized RMSE (0.33 ms) was lower than that of the general operator (0.51 ms). It has been reported that the rest duration of the RCA ranges between 66 and 200 ms;6 the rest phase duration detected by the neural network and experts during our study is almost consistent with this finding. Moreover, the increase in speed of decision is substantial, which can be confirmed on-site in daily clinical practice.\n\nA previous study demonstrated semi-automated systems for detection of rest period using methods other than neural networks,12,13 whereas our neural network system is a fully automated system. In another study of healthy volunteers, a fully automated system that adopted an alternative method, not a neural network, was verified to determine the cardiac rest period. By analyzing the high-speed motion of the heart in a set of cine images, Asou et al. specified the cardiac resting phase for coronary MRA in 10 healthy volunteers.14 Sato et al. reported a fully automated resting phase detection method based on a template-matching technique in 24 healthy volunteers.15 In contrast to these systems, we tested a novel artificial intelligence system, implemented it on the MRI scanner, and adopted it to clinical patients. It is important that the system works successfully in patients as well as in healthy volunteers. And operators could check results immediately on MRI console. This automated process is expected to result in faster examination times that will be beneficial to clinical workflow, operators, and patients. Moreover, this network can be extended to other anatomies, such as the atrioventricular system in the future. Therefore, it could pave the way for the development of similar solutions for other clinical evaluation procedures. If a fully automated examination is successful, the application of cardiovascular MRI examination can be more wide spread.\n\nThis study has some limitations. First, the study’s sample size is small. This study shows an early clinical experience; additional studies involving more patients should be carried out in the future.\n\nSecond, this study focused on the resting phase, and it did not obtain the coronary MRA. The resting phase of the neural network was similar to that of the expert, and the normalized RMSE of the neural network was lower than that of the general operator. There are various factors other than the resting phase, such as body movements, breathing, heart rate, acceptance rate, difference in time after injection of contrast medium, and artifacts, that affect the image quality of coronary MRA images. It is not possible to exclude these biases. Moreover, if the coronary MRA is performed two times in clinical practice, it will drastically increase the examination time and lead to a disadvantage for patients. Therefore, we assessed a neural network system from the viewpoint of accuracy.\n\nThird, the neural network in this study did not support cases with hypoplastic RCA. To create a neural network that addresses these cases, we would have to increase the training data. Our group is also developing artificial intelligence that tracks the atrioventricular movement. If this artificial intelligence is used in combination with the neural network of this study, it would be possible to support cases with hypoplastic RCA in the future. And the information from this study will guide other researcher’s future work.\n\nIn conclusion, neural network algorithms can determine the cardiac resting phase instantly. It was observed that the resting phase is similar to that determined by an expert. The neural network worked successfully in patients and has the potential to improve the clinical workflow."
