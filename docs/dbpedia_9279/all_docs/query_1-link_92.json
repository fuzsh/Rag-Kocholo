Comedy show host Hillary Rea, a bit of a drama queen, wailed \"I'm HOMELESSSS!\" from a tree stump after accidentally locking herself out of her house in her \"primitive\" (ehem, comfy) XXXL sweats and Eagles-adorned fleece slippers in her introductory story. Rather than finding herself exposed to the world in baggy clothes, stand-up comic Carolyn Busa, who punctuated her tale with song, found her college self completely exposed — topless, in fact — to the virtual world. \"Toiling in Obscurity\" host Jaime Fountaine gasped at Paul McCloud's devotion to Elvis (McCloud even named his son after the man), while K-12 curriculum developer Andrew Whitmore cringed with each of his mother's new \"piano baby\" doll purchases (think: Elf on the Shelf to a whole new level). Cofounder of Philly Sketchfest Dave Terruso and musical guests Emily and Micah McGraw poked fun at classmates, teachers (a grave mistake), and Philly accents. Bursts of laughter rang out in the Arts Café as our guests told tale after tale of comical mishaps and mistakes.\n\nMichaela Majoun - Opening Remarks\n\nHillary Rae - Introduction\n\nHillary Rae - Performance\n\nCarolyn Busa - Introduction\n\nCarolyn Busa - Performance\n\nJaime Fountaine - Introduction\n\nJaime Fountaine - Performance\n\nEmily and Micah McGraw - Introduction\n\nEmily and Micah McGraw - Performance\n\nAndrew Whitmire - Introduction\n\nAndrew Whitmire - Performance\n\nDave Terruso - Introduction\n\nDave Terruso - Performance\n\nEmily and Micah McGraw - Performance\n\nMichaela Majoun - Closing Remarks\n\nEpisode 98 - 2/25/2013 - Apiary\n\nProduced by Alli Katz, hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nOn tonight's episode of LIVE, Apiary, a local magazine devoted to celebrating and nurturing the literary arts, graced the Arts Café with passionate writers from a host of genres. Food writer Christina Perucho, who believes in dance therapy, olive oil, and red lipstick, observed that cranky folks get decaf and boys never actually call you by your real name, while Dorkabetic author Hannah McDonald shrilly warned the audience to never fall in love with boys with common names. In a breathy and passionate voice, author Frank Sherlock proclaimed that public toilets are \"rank with territorial piss\" and questioned the meaning of life. Eclectic musical guest Strawberry Hands and English teacher Mathew Kay shared melancholic and shutter-inducing songs and poems about life's struggles. Contemporary poet Carlos Soto Roman could only say, say, say, say before an overwhelming beeping cut off his words and left an unsettling silence in the air. The Arts Café truly burst with passion and performance in this evening's LIVE.\n\nMichaela Majoun - Opening Remarks\n\nCristina Perachio - Introduction\n\nCristina Perachio - Performance\n\nFrank Sherlock - Introduction\n\nFrank Sherlock - Performance\n\nStrawberry Hands - Introduction\n\nStrawberry Hands - Performance\n\nHannah McDonald - Introduction\n\nHannah McDonald - Performance\n\nMatthew Kay - Introduction\n\nMatthew Kay - Performance\n\nCarlos Soto-Roman - Introduction\n\nCarlos Soto-Roman - Performance\n\nStrawberry Hands - Performance\n\nMichaela Majoun - Closing Remarks\n\nEpisode 97 - 1/28/2013 - Philly Love Notes\n\nProduced by Alli Katz, hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nMonday's readers, participants in the online blog project \"Philly Love Notes,\" read to remind Philadelphians how great their city is. John Paul Titlow honored his father's memory polishing off milkshakes at the old-fashioned counter of Little Pete's Diner in Center City, and Andrew Thompson paid tribute to the eco-farm in southwest Philly where life is still made from dirt. Edith Mulhern and Katie Sweeney's love of Philly intertwined with their running routes — Woodland Cemetery, an accessible slice of Philly's rich history, and the Kelly Drive loop, with its rusty water fountain, were not to be overlooked. Gretchen Lohse, whose most inspirational Philly site is her own house in Fishtown, sung \"All Around the River\" with a voice piercing in its insistence. Shadia Cooper and Visheera Muhammad from Tree House Books, whose mission is to grow and sustain a community of readers, writers, and thinkers in North Central Philadelphia, joined us with their own letters to the city they love: Cooper revealed the dreamland in her head, and Muhammad talked about creamy walls, like Twix ice cream, in her grandmother's bedroom. Emma Fried-Cassorla, creator of the blog, read a story by Emma Eisenberg entitled \"The Last City I Loved: Philadelphia.\" And in each of their testimonies, we saw the truth in Cassorla's claim that \"people like to pretend they don't like Philadelphia, but when you get them talking about it they can't stop.\"\n\nMichaela Majoun - Opening Remarks\n\nJohn Paul Titlow - Introduction\n\nJohn Paul Titlow - Performance\n\nAndrew Thomson - Introduction\n\nAndrew Thomson - Performance\n\nGretchen Lohsi - Introduction\n\nGretchen Lohsi - Performance\n\nTreehouse - Introduction\n\nTreehouse - Performance\n\nEdith Mullhern - Introduction\n\nEdith Mullhern - Performance\n\nKatie Sweeney - Introduction\n\nKatie Sweeney - Performance\n\nEmma Fried-Cassorla - Introduction\n\nEmma Fried-Cassorla - Performance\n\nGretchen Lohsi - Performance\n\nMichaela Majoun - Closing Remarks\n\nEpisode 96 - 11/26/2012 - Emerging Philadelphia Writers\n\nProduced by Alli Katz, hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nEpisode 95 - 9/12/2012 - 10th Anniversary of Quirk Books\n\nProduced by Alli Katz, hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nFull program\n\nPhiladelphia publishing house Quirk Books celebrated its tenth anniversary with the Writers House and WXPN at today's edition of LIVE. Eric Smith, Quirk's social media and marketing coordinator, explained the history of Quirk, from The Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook in 2002 to The Peanut Butter Cookbook in 2009. Dougie Horner, proclaimed \"the funniest guy in Philly\" by Philadelphia Magazine, read an excerpt from The History of the Berenstain Bears, proving through snappy one-liners and bizarre plot lines that Philadelphia Magazine chose right. Don Steinberg taught us jokes every man should know, and Caroline Tiger informed us how to spot the serial long-distance dater (hint: \"when you joke about his weekday girlfriend, there is a long pause before he laughs\"). Musical guest Emily Bate provided lively tunes about her new subject of interest, lady criminals. And Michael Rogalski, creative director at Quirk Books, ended the night by sharing his experience and expertise. While most known for the international bestseller Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, the authors and staff at Quirk demonstrated that talent extends to every corner of the publishing house.\n\nMichaela Majoun - Opening Remarks\n\nEric Smith - Introduction\n\nEric Smith - History of Quirk Books\n\nDougie Horner - Introduction\n\nDougie Horner - Short Stories\n\nEmily Bate - Introduction\n\nEmily Bate - Performance\n\nCaroline Tiger - Introduction\n\nCaroline Tiger - Reading\n\nDon Steinberg - Reading\n\nDon Steinberg - Introduction\n\nMichael Rogalski - Introduction\n\nMichael Rogalski - Reading\n\nEmily Bate - Performance\n\nEpisode 94 - 3/26/2012 - Principal Hand Presents\n\nProduced by Erin Gautsche, hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nFull program\n\nLocal experimental poets from Steve McLaughlin's monthly reading series enlivened the Writers House this March evening in an abundance of exuberant verse. Each performer tipped their hat to their fellow readers, resulting in a number of energetic collaborations as the night progressed. It was difficult to discern the difference between Eddie Hopely's lilting poetry and his ordinary speech; he seemed to edit his work in real-time as he warped language in repetition. Trisha Low claimed that performance studies, a field in which she is pursuing an MFA at Tisch, doesn't really exist, an assertion that was hard to believe as her reading took a surprising theatrical turn. Musical guest Corey Duncan of Oh! Pears showcased spirited acoustics in his song \"Under the Olive Trees\"; later in the night, his malleable, whinnying voice went soft in a cover of Tchaikovsky's 5th Symphony (movement #2). \"Corroded philosophic algorithm\" John Paetsch evidenced his verbal alacrity in snappy changes of tone, alternating between textbook recitation, gangsta-speech, diatribe, falsetto, stuttered name-dropping, and even interjected song as if flicking through channels on a TV. Cecilia K. Corrigan enlisted the help of the other poets in attendance to pay tribute to HBO's \"Luck\" with a surreal screenplay about horseracing, intrigue, and threatening poems. Gauss PDF founder Gordon Faylor wrapped up the poetic portion of the night; his voice grew unsettling and gravelly as he spouted medical analyses, creating a diseased effect.\n\nMichaela Majoun - Opening Remarks\n\nEddie Hopely - Introduction\n\nEddie Hopely - Performance\n\nTrisha Low - Introduction\n\nTrisha Low - \"Conversation\"\n\nCorey Duncan - Introduction\n\nCorey Duncan - \"Under the Olive Trees\"\n\nJohn Paetsch - Introduction\n\nJohn Paetsch - \"Novel\"\n\nCecilia K.

Pattie Russo, who began writing stories while working with lab animals in a cancer research lab, started the evening off with a fresh, dystopian take on a \"lost dog\" story, while Sam Allingham continued the theme of absence with an exploration of deluded parental dynamics and art museums. The Old-Fashioneds proceeded to charm with their traditional bluegrass style; plucky, heartening fiddle balanced mournful vocals in \"Who's Going to Shoe Your Pretty Little Feet?\" and \"Single Girl.\" Bridget Talone changed the pace with a measured, mesmerizing reading of Prince-inspired poems. Next, MFA poetry candidate Timothy Leonido delved into inter-workplace tension as it relates to pharmaceuticals, dairy mishaps, and illicit scratch-off dealings. Mathew Jakubowski's \"Chilling Out Raya Potta\" rounded out the night with gripping character development, both written and oral: the earnestness of Raya Potta, executor of \"emblematic public experiences,\" was clear in Jakubowski's voice.\n\nMichaela Majoun - Opening Remarks\n\nPattie Russo - Introduction\n\nPattie Russo - \"Serious Work Indeed\"\n\nSam Allingham - Introduction\n\nSam Allingham - \"Sunflowers,\" \"Field,\" and \"Your Name Here\"\n\nThe Old Fashioneds - Introduction\n\nThe Old Fashioneds - \"Whose Going to Show Your Pretty Little Feet\"\n\nBridget Talone - Introduction\n\nBridget Talone - Nine Poems\n\nTimothy Leonido - Introduction\n\nTimothy Leonido - Short Story\n\nMatthew Jakubowski - Introduction\n\nMatthew Jakubowski - \"Chilling Out Raya Potta\"\n\nOld Fashioneds - \"Single Girl\"\n\nMichaela Majoun - Closing Remarks\n\nEpisode 92 - 01/23/2012 - Friends of the Writers House\n\nProduced by Erin Gautsche, hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nFull program\n\nFor the 92nd episode of LIVE, we invited valued members of the Writers House community to come share their poetry. We were joined by writers Anne-Adele Wight, Frank Sherlock, Susanna Frye, Michelle Taransky, and Ryan Eckes, as well as the musical group Honey Watts, comprised of folk artists Liz Fullerton and Carl Cheeseman. Many of the poets expressed themselves through natural imagery, as in Taransky's \"No, I will be in the Woods\" and Wigh''s commentary on environmental issues in \"Sidestep Catapult.\" The poets also voiced their concerns with social issues and educating people, as we saw in Sherlock's piece on the Occupy Wall Street movement. We concluded the session close to home, with Eckes' series of poems about Philadelphia, finishing appropriately with a poem exploring what the word \"friend\" really means.\n\nErin Gautsche - Opening Remarks\n\nAnne-Adele Wight - Introduction\n\nAnne-Adele Wight - \"Sidestep Catapult\"\n\nFrank Sherlock - Introduction\n\nFrank Sherlock - \"Great Meetings in History\"\n\nSusana Frye - Introduction\n\nSusana Frye - Reading\n\nMichelle Taransky - Introduction\n\nMichelle Taransky - \"No, I will be in the Woods\"\n\nHoney Watts - Introduction\n\nHoney Watts - \"No Promises\"\n\nRyan Eckes - Introduction\n\nRyan Eckes - \"Old News\"\n\nHoney Watts - \"Charlotte\"\n\nErin Gautsche - Closing Remarks\n\nEpisode 91 - 11/28/2011 - Leeway Foundation Grant Winners\n\nProduced by Erin Gautsche, hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nFull program\n\nEpisode 91 of LIVE featured grant winners from the Leeway Foundation, a group that focuses on female and transgender artists in Philadelphia who work to promote social change and resist oppression. During the event, the winners described the projects funded by the Leeway grants. These works ranged from books to artistic portraits to plays. The final winner, Reverend Dr. Beverly Dale, performed one-woman shows on women's liberation from sexual opression. Genne Murphy, playwright and grant winner, was unfortunately unable to join us; however, prior to the event, she worked with two actresses – Anjoli Santiago and Leyla Eraslan – on a reading of Scenes Three and Four of her play-in-progress, \"Giantess.\" Poetry by Shari Tobias and Debra Powell-Wright was also shared during this episode, as well as the introduction to Ondartza Polita's \"Legend of Nahia.\"\n\nMichaela Majoun - Opening Remarks\n\nShari Tobias - Introduction\n\nShari Tobias - \"Tomb of the Unkown Mother\"\n\nDebra Wright - Introduction\n\nDebra Wright - \"Love Letter to Mother\"\n\nDebra Wright - \"Woman Just Be\"\n\nLizanne Knott - Introdution\n\nLizanne Knott - \"Three Steps Shy\"\n\nGenne Murphy - Introduction\n\nGenne Murphy - \"Giantess\"\n\nOndartza Polita - Introduction\n\nOndartza Polita - \"Legend of Naya\"\n\nReverand Dr. Beverly Dale - Introduction\n\nReverand Dr. Beverly Dale - \"Buns\"\n\nReverand Dr. Beverly Dale - \"Song of Songs\"\n\nLizanne Knott - \"Angels\"\n\nMichaela Majoun - Closing Remarks\n\nEpisode 90 - 10/24/2011 - First Person Festival Preview\n\nProduced by Erin Gautsche, hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nFull program\n\nAs a precursor for the 10th anniversary First Person Festival of Memoir and Documentary Art, LIVE hosted its 90th episode with poets and spoken word artists set to perform at the festival. The storytelling began with comedian Hillary Rea sharing stories of her celebrity encounters, told in backwards chronological order. Among the rest of the storytellers were Michelle Myers and Kao Kue, who each performed works that brought out their distinctly Asian American heritage, paying special attention to their ancestors. Erik Thomas shared his funny, captivating, yet emotional poem, \"Daddy Issues,\" which offered his perspective on growing up gay. Hip-hop artist and poet Native Son, as well as musician and self-proclaimed \"teaching artist\" Jack Drummond, shared stories as well.\n\nMichaela Majoun - Opening Remarks\n\nHillary Rea - Introduction\n\nHillary Rea - \"Celebrity Encounters\"\n\nMichelle Myers - Introduction\n\nMichelle Myers - Three Poems\n\nJack Drummond - Introduction\n\nJack Drummond - \"Freedom\"\n\nErik Thomas - Introduction\n\nErik Thomas - \"Daddy Issues\"\n\nKao Kue - Introduction\n\nKao Kue - Stories and Poems\n\nNative Son - Introduction\n\nNative Son - Poems\n\nJack Drummond - \"Sometimes I Feel like a Motherless Child\"\n\nMichaela Majoun - Closing Remarks\n\nEpisode 89 - 9/26/2011 - Philadelphia Stories Contributors\n\nProduced by Erin Gautsche, hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nFull program\n\nThe Writers House welcomed contributors to the literary journal Philadelphia Stories as well as musician Adrien Reju to the 89th episode of LIVE. To start off the evening, Christina Delia read us her short story \"The Robbery\" from the journal, as well as a story about dreams called \"All Through the Night.\" Next, we heard James W. Morris's ridiculous yet chilling \"The Captive,\" and Chad Willemborg's creepy and emotionally charged \"The Boat.\" Quaker writer Helen W. Mallon shared a few of her unique stories featuring a spiritually lost, bi-racial mother of twins and a girl's father that refuses to come out of the bathroom for weeks. Finally, Debrah Morkun shared a series of poems called \"IDA.\" With the exceptions of Morkun and Reju, the works read by the writers present can be found in print in Philadelphia Stories.\n\nMichaela Majoun - Opening Remarks\n\nChristina Delia - Introduction\n\nChristina Delia - \"The Robbery\"\n\nJames W.

In this episode of LIVE contributors to the anthology Philadelphia Noir tested the limits of radio with scandalous, suspenseful stories set in delightfully familiar landscapes. Carlin Romano, occasionally adopting a Russian accent for added effect, began with a University City tale about a man with an affinity for seducing real estate agents. Dennis Tafoya revealed his taste for desperation and anxiety in a story about a kleptomaniac, saying, \"I'm not a criminal, but I'm a parent, so I understand.\" Elliot Harvey of A Stick and A Stone introduced the audience to \"haunted folk therapy\"; enchanting banjo and the raspy edge to his clear soprano lent his music an appropriate level of sorrow and pain. Ansali Solomon followed with a segment from \"Secret Pool,\" in which the disappearance of a teenager's Walkman coincides with her discovery of a shadowy swimming pool. Solomon Jones's emphatic, poetic voice accented the sensory trauma of \"Scarred,\" a short fictional piece brimming with military conspiracy, while Jim Zervanos lightened the mood in \"Your Brother Who Loves You,\" a story rich with satire and comical aspirations to badassery.\n\nMichaela Majoun - Opening Remarks\n\nCarlin Romano - Introduction\n\nCarlin Romano - Performance\n\nDennis Tafoya - Introduction\n\nDennis Tafoya - \"Above the Imperial\"\n\nA Stick and a Stone - Introduction\n\nA Stick and a Stone - \"Moving Slowly\"\n\nAnsali Solomon - Introduction\n\nAnsali Solomon - \"Secret Pool\"\n\nSolomon Jones - Introduction\n\nSolomon Jones - \"Scarred\"\n\nJim Zervanos - Introduction\n\nJim Zervanos - \"Your Brother Who Loves You\"\n\nA Stick and a Stone - \"Muscle Memory\"\n\nMichaela Majoun - Closing Remarks\n\nEpisode 87 - 2/28/2011 - Leeway Foundation Grant Winners\n\nProduced by Erin Gautsche, hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nFull program\n\nThis edition of Live at the Writers House featured the Leeway Foundation's 2010 Arts and Change Grantees. Catzie Villayphonh arrived at the program straight from teaching 5th-7th graders poetry; though she claimed to be underprepared, Villayphonh delivered a confident, high-speed performance of \"You Bring Out the Laos in the House,\" a poem that covered everything from fertilized duck eggs to elephant tattoos. Dr Tanji Gilliam, whose Leeway project was designed to empower women impacted by domestic violence, encouraged those afraid to speak up to \"speak in\"; as she delivered a troubling and frank family history her voice trembled only twice. Musical guest Emily Ana Zeitlyn – who, host Michaela Majoun explained, was born on a kitchen table in Fairmount Park – sung two of her \"lyrically spare... and emotionally volcanic\" songs in clear, soft tones. The first of these songs, \"Take Me Back,\" was followed by several poems from Monique E. Hankerson: Hankerson's mild-mannered voice grew righteous and strong as she recounted injustices both universal and personal. Filipino-American Lorelai Narvaja followed with excerpts from family interviews, exploring the conflicting attitudes with which her family regards the past. Finally, Benita Cooper revealed how her grandmother's amazing stories brought her the ability to trust her own voice and ultimately start a large-scale intergenerational storytelling project.\n\nMichaela Majoun - Opening Remarks\n\nCatzie Vilayphonh - Introduction\n\nCatzie Vilayphonh - Reading\n\nDr. Tanji Gilliam - Introduction\n\nDr. Tanji Gilliam - \"For Clark\"\n\nDr. Tanji Gilliam - \"My Voice\"\n\nEmily Ana Zeitlyn - Introduction\n\nEmily Ana Zeitlyn - \"Take Me Back\"\n\nMonique Hankerson - Introduction\n\nMonique Hankerson - \"The Wayward\"\n\nLorelei Narvaja - Introduction\n\nLorelei Narvaja - \"My Cousin\"\n\nBenita Cooper - Introduction\n\nBenita Cooper - \"One More Story\"\n\nEmily Ana Zeitlyn - \"Follow\"\n\nMichaela Majoun - Closing Remarks\n\nEpisode 86 - 1/24/2011 - UPenn Excelano Project\n\nProduced by Erin Gautsche, hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nFull program\n\nMichaela Majoun's voice expressed her excitement about this \"return to the classic radio play,\" and compelling storytelling left the audience, too, hungry for more. Actors Ames Adamson, Zura Athena Johnson, Mary Lee Bednarek, Amanda Schoonover, and Keith Conallen demonstrated their versatility as they shifted from character to character throughout the episode. Rain filled the Arts Cafe in Seth Bauer's drizzly \"Umbrella Play,\" mingling with the sighs of its bewildered, love-struck characters. The precipitation gave way to accents of affluence in a scene from Quinn D. Eli's \"The Golden Ladder\"; the excerpt ended just as the audience's curiosity peaked. Farm girl Carsie Blanton updated a traditional country sound in her simile-strewn musical interludes, while Jacqueline Goldfinger evoked a deep-South sensibility in her dark comedy \"The Terrible Girls.\" Next, Genne Murphy returned to the local in a Philadelphia play that expertly juxtaposed blas&ecaute; recollections from a former dope addict with trepidation and uncertainty.

Our first guest was food and wine writer Brian Freedman, who shared a negative restaurant review (the restaurant remained unnamed) and an excerpt from a series of essays detailing an embarrassing incident at summer camp involving a vanilla éclair and a cabin full of thirteen campers. Other guests included Kirsten Henri, who told an unconventional story about trying to learn to cook with her Italian grandmother; Drew Lazor, who shared a cleverly titled piece about Philly pizza joints; Felicia D'Ambrosio, who described her growth from a city paper writer to running an online review site by reading pieces from her past and present; and Collin Keefe, who read a series of humorous blog posts describing a highly anticipated food truck's reluctance to open. Also present for the event was musician John Francis, who played his non-food-related but stirring \"Who\" and \"Johnny Cash on the Radio.\"\n\nMichaela Majoun - Introduction\n\nBrian Freedman - Introduction\n\nBrian Freedman - Reading\n\nKirsten Henri - Introduction\n\nKirsten Henri - Reading\n\nDrew Lazor - Introduction\n\nDrew Lazor - Reading\n\nFelicia D'Ambrosio - Introduction\n\nFelicia D'Ambrosio - Reading\n\nJohn Francis - Introduction\n\nJohn Francis - Performing \"Who\"\n\nCollin Keefe - Introduction\n\nCollin Keefe - Reading\n\nJohn Francis - Closing Performance Introduction\n\nJohn Francis - Performance \"Johnny Cash on the Radio\"\n\nMichaela Majoun - Closing Remarks\n\nEpisode 83 - 9/27/2010 - First Person Arts Story Slam Stars\n\nProduced and hosted by Erin Gautsche.\n\nFull program\n\nGuest host Erin Gautsche assured the audience that tonight's First Person Arts Story Slam winners were \"the best of the best\" in this edition of LIVE. Angel Hogan, whose rural childhood consisted of \"a heap of multicultural embarrassments,\" started the night off by detailing the transformation of her white rooster, Mr. Chick, from mild-mannered house-pet to terrifying attack bird. Leah Walton revealed why her typically charming grandfather was nicknamed \"Hank the Crank\" in a story that recounted their late-night ice-cream-and-casaba-melon run; her gruff, silly grandpa voice added investment to the escapade. Musical guest Ross Bellenoit's deep, resonant guitar was complemented by natural rhyme as he sang about \"victories of blood and gold\"; a sharp contrast, to be sure, to the cheeseburger song he once wrote for Craig LaBan. Quirky strains of awkwardness punctuated R. Eric Thomas's piece about a road trip with his parents, while Katonya Mosely addressed her complicated bladder in a recollection of her crazy law school days. Mike McCarry's struggles with terminal lateness were almost too incredible to believe in his account of \"the day I figured out they were never gonna fire me\": his mishaps were balanced by profound reflections in Tre Rials's \"How I Spent My Summer Evacucation,\" in which Rials thanked Katrina for lending him new perspective.\n\nErin Gautsche - Introduction\n\nAngel Hogan - Introduction\n\nAngel Hogan - \"Chicken\"\n\nLeah Walton - Introduction\n\nLeah Walton - \"Hank the Crank\"\n\nRoss Bellenoit - \"To Be Free\"\n\nRoss Bellenoit - Performance\n\nR.

Writing (along with video games and sports) was a shared interested for the 7th and 8th grade alumni of Mighty Writers' \"Scary Stories\" workshop, and their enthusiasm for the craft was reflected in a series of imaginative readings. Soccer player Imani Kunle's collected air lent an almost cavalier tone to the devastations of an apocalypse story, while Antoniyah Ben T'om's \"Deep Roots\" made a compelling case against feeding plants tasteless fertilizer. Anthony Oliver's creative similes (\"like two bald-headed Milk Duds,\" among others) were a highlight of \"A Walk Down the Street,\" a story which fused time travel and a near-death experience. Eighth-grader Tiaira Rodgers confronted \"Thomas Jefferson with his big mouth\" in another time-travel narrative about changing the constitution's stance on slavery; her choice of first person made the tale read like a personal recollection. Musical interludes from Nicole Reynolds showcased the innocent, meandering quality of her voice even as she asked \"would you cut off your ear / if I needed it to hear...?\" And Naur Collins concluded the readings with a grisly ghost story set in the Eastern State Penitentiary, growling and whispering for additional creepiness.\n\nMichaela Majoun - Introduction\n\nImani Kunle - Introduction\n\nImani Kunle - Reading\n\nAdoniyah Ben T'om - Introduction\n\nAdoniyah Ben T'om - \"Deep Roots\"\n\nCaroline Bean - Talks about Mighty Writers\n\nAnthony Oliver - Introduction\n\nAnthony Oliver - \"A Walk Down the Street\"\n\nTiaira Rodgers - Introduction\n\nTiaira Rodgers - \"The Constitution\"\n\nNicole Reynolds - Introduction\n\nNicole Reynolds - \"Wonderin\"\n\nNaur Collins - Introduction\n\nNaur Collins - \"Eastern State Penitentiary\"\n\nJonathan Marcin - Talks about Mighty Writers\n\nNicole Reynolds - \"Here Right Now\"\n\nMichaela Majoun - Closing Remarks\n\nEpisode 81 - 2/22/2010 - Leeway Foundation Winners\n\nProduced by Erin Gautsche, hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nFull program\n\nAnother round of Leeway grant recipients graced the Writers House for this edition of LIVE, navigating the depths of documentary and memoir in a night with equal parts emotion and humor. Elizabeth Castiglione illustrated how unsettling the ordinary can become in an exploration of bipolar disorder, equating her situation to a 6th-grade writing assignment involving PB&J. Esteemed gluten-free author Jax Peters Lowell offset the dread of her husband's brain-surgery recovery with a slew of quirky characters – from a Cockney-speaking crossing guard to an elite \"Connecticut preppy\" – in \"Coconuts.\" Indah Nuritasari asked audience members to pardon her accent as she recounted her migration from Indonesia to Philly, emphasizing the small miracles of everyday life. The Swimmers followed with a fresh take on the synthesizer; the progressive combination and separation of male and female vocals mesmerized. Yowei Shaw, a Penn senior, shared a scene from her radio documentary about The People's Revolutionary Party in Philly, proving that even communists eat cookie cream pie. A reporter's composure and clarity distinguished a final reading from Barbara Ann Grant, in which the humiliation and frustration of securing care for her elderly mother was balanced by small comic details (a 75-year-old boy toy and the redefinition of \"HONDA,\" for instance).\n\nMichaela Majoun - Introduction\n\nElizabeth Castiglione - Introduction\n\nElizabeth Castiglione - From the first chapter of Stumbling in the Dark\n\nJax Peters Lowell - Introduction\n\nJax Peters Lowell - \"Coconuts\"\n\nIndah Nuritasari - Introduction\n\nIndah Nuritasari - \"Relying on Miracles\"\n\nSwimmers - Introduction\n\nSwimmers - \"Anything Together\"\n\nYowei Shaw - Introduction\n\nYowei Shaw - Reading\n\nBarbara Ann Grant - Introduction\n\nBarbara Ann Grant - Reading\n\nSwimmers - Closing Performance Introduction\n\nSwimmers - \"Save Me From the Brightness\"\n\nMichaela Majoun - Closing\n\nEpisode 80 - 1/25/2010 - Philly Fiction 2 Contributors\n\nProduced by Erin Gautsche, hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nFull program\n\n\"A deafening audience\" joined us this night to celebrate our very own \"city of inspiration\" and its fiction-writing inhabitants. Christine Flanagan began with a story about an ad man fighting to keep his anger in check in settings ranging from the Schuylkill banks to the local 7-11. Former Writers House fundraiser and experimental mailman John Carroll followed with an amusing account of a Phillies game in which harassment of Cubs fans featured prominently. The young narrator of Elise Juska's \"Northeast Philly Girls\" drew laughs from the audience as she marveled at the tight-jeans pride of her \"grown-up\" middle-school cousin. Scotch-Irish \"musical cooperative\" Flora Lee couldn't seem to help themselves from leaning into a cheerful, sweet, head-bobbing sound, reminiscent of an earlier musical time. Kelly McQuain told an Italian Market tale in which a freehand tattoo undertaking goes horribly awry, while Benjamin Matvey ended on a bizarre note with a story of young love and brains in the Mütter Museum.\n\nMichaela Majoun - Introduction\n\nChristine Flanagan - Introduction\n\nChristine Flanagan - Reading from \"Return to Ithaca\"\n\nJohn Carroll - Introduction\n\nJohn Carroll - \"Baby Blue\"\n\nElise Juska - Introduction\n\nElise Juska - \"Northeast Philly Girls\"\n\nFlora Lee - Introduction\n\nFlora Lee - \"I'm Beginning to See the Light\"\n\nKelly McQuain - Introduction\n\nKelly McQuain - \"Erasing Sonny\"\n\nBenjamin Matvey - Introduction\n\nBenjamin Matvey - \"Peace of Mind\"\n\nFlora Lee - Closing Performance Introduction\n\nFlora Lee - Untitled Song\n\nMichaela Majoun - Closing\n\nEpisode 79 - 11/30/2009 - Local Fiction Writers\n\nProduced by Erin Gautsche, hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nFull program\n\nThis episode of LIVE demonstrated the benefits of listening locally in a tribute to the city's homegrown literary talent. Jeff Bender defined Jesus Christ's character by his prowess on the wrestling mat, while Rachel Cantor turned an in-flight flirtation into a desperate, operatic confrontation. Tim Leonido's \"Difference Tone\" channeled all of the precision of an automaton in its playfully overwrought vocabulary. Rachel Carpenter, originator of such words as \"faukward\" and \"expatitis,\" preoccupied the audience with the past in a reading from The Return of Mr. Davies. Zach Djanikian's speaking voice was transformed by song: its emphatic fluidity met simple, soothing guitar. Finally, novel-juggler Jeremy Rosenberg drew laughter with the musings of a pro-pyramid-scheme cheese-factory worker and a loony amateur astronomer.\n\nMichaela Majoun - Opening Remarks\n\nJeff Bender - Excerpt from The Weight\n\nRachel Cantor - Introduction\n\nRachel Cantor - \"White Sky\"\n\nTim Leonido - Introduction\n\nTim Leonido - \"Difference Tone\"\n\nRachel Carpenter - Introduction\n\nRachel Carpenter - \"Things Begin Again\" from The Return of Mr. Davies\n\nZach Djanikian - Introduction\n\nZach Djanikian - I Think They're Out to Destroy\n\nJeremy Rosenberg - Introduction\n\nJeremy Rosenberg - \"Pyramid Scheme\" and \"Moon\"\n\nZach Djanikian - Closing Introduction\n\nZach Djanikian - Love of My Life\n\nMichaela Majoun - Closing Remarks\n\nEpisode 78 - 10/26/2009 - \"Local Journalists Write Philadelphia\" Features\n\nProduced by Erin Gautsche, hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nFull program\n\nSome of Philadelphia's most intriguing stories hit the radio waves in this episode of LIVE, which was comprised of feature articles from local journalists. Daniel Denvir's opening piece was ringed with a sad, twisted humor as he detailed the desensitized virtual violence of a \"military Dave and Buster's\"; Mattathias Schwartz followed with an appetizing look into an old-style bakery (South Philadelphian dialects rose through slowly, like dough). Penn PhD candidate David Faris explained that \"one-hundred and fifty dollars goes away much more smoothly when you kiss it goodbye in stackable red chips\" in his underground exploration of illegal no-limit poker, while Bruce Schimmel extolled the merits of driving a \"mature vehicle.\" Twin brothers Rich and Rob Kwait of Cabin Dogs provided a musical interlude about a ghost train before Tara Murtha took a dark look at the abuses and paradoxes of the teen prostitute \"game\" in the US. Isaiah Thompson managed to lighten the mood by chronicling South Philly residents' cohabitation with a self-sustaining feral chicken pack; fittingly, Cabin Dogs concluded the night with a plaintive song inspired by the sunset on a chicken farm.\n\nMichaela Majoun - Opening Remarks\n\nDaniel Denvir - Introduction\n\nDaniel Denvir - \"Game Theory\"\n\nMattathias Schwartz - Introduction\n\nMattathias Schwartz - \"Nothing Fancy\"\n\nDavid Faris - Introduction\n\nDavid Faris - \"Take it to the Limit\"\n\nBruce Schimmel - Introduction\n\nBruce Schimmel - \"Driving Down\"\n\nCabin Dogs - Introduction\n\nCabin Dogs - \"Blue Train\"\n\nTara Murtha - Introduction\n\nTara Murtha - \"Traffic Stop\"\n\nIsaiah Thompson - Introduction\n\nIsaiah Thompson - \"Coop d'état\"\n\nCabin Dogs - Closing Intro\n\nCabin Dogs - \"Twilight\"\n\nMichaela Majoun - Closing Remarks\n\nEpisode 77 - 9/21/2009 - Keystone Chapbook Prize Winners\n\nProduced by Erin Gautsche, hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nFull program\n\nPennsylvania poets exhibited the fruits of their prize-winning chapbooks in tonight's episode of LIVE. Harry Humes started the night off in deep tones, his poems evocative of the coal-mining country where he was raised. The music began early in the episode with singer-songwriter-cardiologist Suzie Brown's soothing \"Side Streets\"; later, Brown warned against falling for a drifter in her Johnny-Cash-inspired \"Longest Road.\" Katherine Bode Lang's work addressed overheard vegetable chopping, divorce, her mother, and the view from her front porch; her \"Lament for Pluto\" was an audience favorite. Lisa Sewell read from her series of book-inspired poems and arrested listener attention with a bleak look into the Super Dome during Hurricane Katrina; Deborah Burnham concluded with snow, peaches, migraines, and mirror metaphor.\n\nMichaela Majoun - Introduction\n\nHarry Humes - Introduction\n\nHarry Humes - Reading\n\nSuzie Brown - Introduction\n\nSuzie Brown - Performance\n\nKatherine Bode Lang - Introduction\n\nKatherine Bode Lang - Reading\n\nLisa Sewell - Introduction\n\nLisa Sewell - Reading\n\nDeborah Burnham - Introduction\n\nDeborah Burnham - Reading\n\nSuzie Brown - Closing Remarks\n\nSuzie Brown - Closing Performance\n\nMichaela Majoun - Closing\n\nEpisode 76 - 3/23/2009 - Young Local Fiction Writers\n\nProduced by Erin Gautsche, hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nFull program\n\nThe writers featured in this episode of LIVE defied age expectations with the maturity of their captivating prose. Former Writers House staffer Sam Allingham appealed to listener imagination by distinguishing between the peculiar pulsations of love-stricken buildings, while Wharton speech-writer Katherine Hill intimated potential recycling conspiracies in a humorous story of purge. Shannon Pelcher's voice managed to be both feathery and syrupy as it meandered alongside a pleasantly bumbling bass. A poetic sensibility permeated Adrian Khactu's reading as he paused amongst maternal dysfunction and an enigmatic Mexican savior. French fries loomed large over Mecca Sullivan's obesity-clinic twist on a mother-daughter piece, while Penn senior Vince Levy touched upon polar bears, suicide, and the beauty of imminent danger in \"Swim Lessons.\"\n\nMichaela Majoun - Introduction\n\nSam Allingham - Introduction\n\nSam Allingham - \"Buildings, A Love Story\"\n\nKatherine Hill - Introduction\n\nKatherine Hill - \"Waste Disposal\"\n\nShannon Pelcher - Introduction\n\nShannon Pelcher - \"Peculiar Pain\"\n\nAdrian Khactu - Introduction\n\nAdrian Khactu - \"Mexico\"\n\nMecca Sullivan - Introduction\n\nMecca Sullivan - Piece from \"Blue Talk and Love\"\n\nVince Levy - Introduction\n\nVince Levy - \"Swim Lessons\"\n\nShannon Pelcher - Closing Performance Introduction\n\nShannon Pelcher - \"Daydream\"\n\nMichaela Majoun - Closing\n\nEpisode 75 - 2/16/2009 - Leeway Foundation Award Winners\n\nProduced by Erin Gautsche, hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nFull program\n\nChlamydia, Darby, cats shitting on the lawn: Leeway Foundation award-winners filled the Writers House this Monday with poems and stories of prison, family, and domestic animals. Writer and teacher Alison Harris started off the evening painting pictures in calm even tones of those at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder, a reflection of the foundation's mission to promote expression that amplifies the voices of the marginalized. Valerie Harris, a teaching artist aiming to assist individuals in appreciating \"the cultural landscape of their communities,\" gave a human face to Darby Borough, and Stephanie Yuhas, by literally adopting the voice of her Transylvanian mother, gave a complete picture of that human face. Courtney Fairchild gave us a different sort of lyricism with musical performances from her new album \"11 Chances,\" a mix of percussion and buttery smooth tonality. Ann Marie Kirk and Winifred Coller-Bolkus, by different means and in varied voices, finished the night by expressing the triumph of human spirit against adversity: one through stories of burnt sheets and burnt lungs, and the other by way of a frog with a prosthesis. With unyielding voices in their advocacy for economic and social justice, our five female readers provoked thought and laughter throughout the evening.\n\nMichaela Majoun - Introduction\n\nAllison Harris - Introduction\n\nAllison Harris - Reading\n\nValerie Harris - Introduction\n\nValerie Harris - Reading\n\nCourtney Fairchild - Performance\n\nAnn Marie Kirk - Introduction\n\nAnn Marie Kirk - Reading\n\nStephanie Yuhas - Introduction\n\nStephanie Yuhas - Reading\n\nWinifred Collier-Bolkus - Introduction\n\nWinifred Collier-Bolkus - Reading\n\nCourtney Fairchild - Performance\n\nMichaela Majoun - Closing\n\nEpisode 74 - 01/26/2009 - Writers and Actors from InterAct Theatre Company\n\nProduced by Erin Gautsche, hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nFull program\n\n\"If only you could speak her language …\" the voice of Kelly Lundgren Pietrucha's protagonist expresses all of the regret and limitation that each of the writers' characters is made to feel at some point in these three pieces of short fiction. Pietrucha presented her short story along with fellow writers Liz Abraham and Jonathan Liebson. In this month's installment of LIVE, however, the Kelly Writers House did not see the performance of these pieces by their authors, but rather by professional actors from the InterAct theatre company. The company, which celebrated its tenth season in 2008/2009, is known for giving voices to the region's writers. Lilian Rozen started off the evening with a performance of Liz Abraham's short story: a mix of docility and hospital beds, starting with shouts and ending in whispers and silence. Jonathan Liebson's short story, performed by Dan Hodge, was one of hatred, unease, and knife blades biting into flesh. In a change of tone from Liebson, Mark Silever and the Stone Throwers, the evening's musical performers, gave a more upbeat feel with an acoustic guitar and indie vibe. Jared Delaney ended the night with Pietrucha's storm and attempts to gain control. This Monday, the Kelly Writers House was able to showcase arts both written and performed, and the blend between strengthened each.\n\nMichaela Majoun - Introduction\n\nLillian Rosen - Reading\n\nJonathan Liebson - Introduction\n\nJonathan Liebson - Commentary\n\nJonathan Liebson (read by Dan Hodge) - Reading\n\nMark Silver - Performance\n\nKelly Lundgren Pietrucha - Introduction\n\nKelly Lundgren Pietrucha (read by Jared Delaney) - Reading\n\nMark Sliver - Introduction\n\nMark Silver - Performance\n\nMichaela Majoun - Closing\n\nEpisode 73 - 11/17/2008 - Sage Writers\n\nProduced by Erin Gautsche, hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nFull program\n\nThe inside world of prison came out in this episode of LIVE. The program included a variety of inspirational, unsettling, and thought-provoking poems and prose. Founder and director Judith Trustone who began the publishing program after teaching a creative writing course at a local prison, noted stark views of prisoners (they are but \"a squirt of sperm\") in her poem \"A Kinder, Gentler Murder.\" Trustone's readings of works from prisoners themselves also explicitly demonstrated the atrocities within prison. One such poem, \"Twenty-first-century Dawn's Early Light,\" addressed today's injustices while seamlessly intertwining the lyrics of the National Anthem into with its own, causing the book in which it resides to be banned in Pennsylvania's prisons. Cameron Holmes, who had twenty years inside, addressed patriotism in his poem \"The World is Round\" — an account of his perspective of 9/11 while behind bars. The desire for freedom rung true in the poems of Patrick Middletone, the first prisoner in the US to earn his BA, MA, and PhD behind bars, and Anton Forde, a native Jamaican who maintains his innocence. Both prisoners are \"lifers.\" The clamorous music of Oh! Pears, founded by Corey Duncan, complemented the poets' messages with their own haunting chants — music which ultimately believes that words, and sometimes only words, can heal us.\n\nMichaela Majoun - Introduction\n\nJudith Trustone - Introduction\n\nJudith Trustone - Reading\n\nCameron Holmes - Introduction\n\nCameron Holmes - Reading\n\nOh!

Leslie Banks, an expert in multiple genres, began the night with an excerpt from \"Minion,\" a story about seduction and deep-South vampires. Solomon Jones, spoken-word artist and author, read excerpts from political thriller \"C.R.E.A.M\" and \"The Mission,\" the latter a warning for single men about walking the feminine hygiene aisle. Twin poets Al and Nnamdi, devoted to the empowerment of the community via social work and spoken word, followed with the poem entitled \"Why I Write.\" The brothers gave their powerful voices to all those without (\"I write to share my love affair of words with the children / Because God is on my tongue and the world is in need of healing\"). Monnette Sudler, our musical guest for the evening, continued the theme of healing with \"The Healing Song,\" a combination of African thumb piano and soft cries of \"heal me.\" Ed Shockley, artistic director of the Philadelphia Dramatics center, ended the night with an echo of \"Oh Freedom\" from his performance of \"Slave Narrative.\"\n\nErin Gautsche - Introduction\n\nL.A.

The evening began with readings from Thomas Devaney, one of the cocurators for Edgar Allan Poe's 200th anniversary exhibit. His daringly dark poetry (a result of Poe, perhaps?) drew inspiration from acrostics and YouTube videos. Influenced by her personal trials, Trapeta Mayson, who enjoys teaching young people the importance of creative venues, chilled the room with thoughts of her ill mother, immigration, and the \"Liberian English\" dialect. Bypassing dialect for translation in \"Ship Burial,\" Randall Couch, a regular panelist on PoemTalk, seamlessly interwove excerpts of Beowulf into his own work. Hezekiah Jones then presented a folky, mellow song taken from a letter written from the future. Back to the present, Ish Klein, a self-taught film- and puppet-maker, allowed her puppets to speak for themselves, while Scott Edward Anderson, writer of The Green Skeptic Blog, spoke for those that cannot speak in his environmentally conscious poetry and bitingly sarcastic description of his knee. Hezekiah Jones's strumming song about baked goods, \"Cupcakes for the Army,\" fittingly concluded the inspirational evening with a tale of hopes, dreams, and childhood innocence.\n\nErin Gautsche - Introduction\n\nThomas Devaney - Introduction\n\nThomas Devaney - Reading\n\nTrapeta Mayson - Introduction\n\nTrapeta Mayson - Reading\n\nRandall Couch - Introduction\n\nRandall Couch - Reading\n\nHezekiah Jones - Introduction\n\nHezekiah Jones - Performance\n\nIsh Klein - Introduction\n\nIsh Klein - Reading\n\nScott Edward Anderson - Introduction\n\nScott Edward Anderson - Reading\n\nHezekiah Jones - Performance\n\nEpisode 70 - 03/31/2008 - Mad Poets Society\n\nProduced by Erin Gautsche, hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nYou can hear a recording of the entire program here.\n\nRather than being clinically insane or deranged, the Mad Poets Society believe themselves to be \"a little crazy, but not someone you'd move away from on the bus.\" This episode of LIVE featured several mad poets and their deeply moving, wildly humorous, and utterly chilling poetry. Director Eileen D'Angelo expressed a range of true and imagined fears, regrets, and desires, while self-proclaimed \"humorous and serious poet\" Steven Delia reflected both his sincerity and wit. Appreciative chuckles and guffaws sputtered out during Delia's self-deprecating \"4 AM Commercial\" and slightly scandalous \"Ode to Cecily.\" Unlike Delia, who could only think of Cecily's underwear, a frustrated Missy Grotz could not take her mind off of her mouth's searing pain in \"Advil Isn't Cutting It.\" Musical guest Devin Greenwood then sent a shiver through the audience with his strumming guitar and successive \"mmm's.\" In a sprightly voice, Autumn Knopka next read a selection of poetry that \"met FCC regulations.\" Breaking the trend of introducing his poem with an anecdote, Dan Maguire, who \"doesn't do anything\" but \"takes a long time doing it,\" comically noted his poem's literary features (if you're wondering — unrhymed iambic hexameter with enjambment and slant rhyme). His smooth voice filled the room like a lullaby as he fittingly read a poem about mental illness. Greenwood's final song, \"Dragon City,\" characterized by an atmospheric puccalo, finished the evening with a bittersweet and mystic tale — one which you'd have to be, well, mad to believe.\n\nMichaela Majoun - Introduction\n\nEileen DAngelo - Introduction\n\nEileen DAngelo - The Failings of Memory\n\nEileen DAngelo - Marksman\n\nEileen DAngelo - August, Perseids Meteor Shower\n\nEileen DAngelo - For Eric\n\nEileen DAngelo - Love Letter to a Moody Sea\n\nStephen Delia - Introduction\n\nStephen Delia - Easter\n\nStephen Delia - Roadside Sideshow\n\nStephen Delia - 4 AM Commerical\n\nStephen Delia - Perception\n\nStephen Delia - Ode to Cecily\n\nStephen Delia - Winter Night on 2nd Street\n\nStephen Delia - Angel Gloss\n\nStephen Delia - When I Get Married\n\nMissy Grotz - Introduction\n\nMissy Grotz - Do You See My Face\n\nMissy Grotz - Can I Be Myself\n\nMissy Grotz - Creativity\n\nMissy Grotz - Advil Isnt Cutting It\n\nMissy Grotz - Morning Paper Guy on 12th and Curlan\n\nMissy Grotz - Who Do I See But What Do I Care\n\nDevin Greenwood - Introduction\n\nDevin Greenwood - This Over Here\n\nAutumn Konopka - Introduction\n\nAutumn Konopka - The Stuff of Poems\n\nAutumn Konopka - Potato Salad Isnt Only for Picnics\n\nAutumn Konopka - Couplets for William and Abigail\n\nAutumn Konopka - Paper Boy\n\nAutumn Konopka - Hush\n\nDan Maguire - Introduction\n\nDan Maguire - The Lateness of the Day\n\nDan Maguire - Reprise\n\nDan Maguire - Finding the Words\n\nDevin Greenwood - Dragon City\n\nEpisode 69 - 02/25/2008 - Leeway Award Winners\n\nProduced by Erin Gautsche, hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nYou can hear a recording of the entire program here.\n\nLeeway Award winners flooded the Writers House this evening, crossing boundaries between people and places. Judith Truthstone, founder of Sage Writers, traversed the hidden world of prison to uncover \"toxic masculinity.\" In order to dissuade them from listening to what she considers to be poisonous music, hip hop artist Kameela Waheed introduced students in Camden to Funk and James Brown. Architect Rachel Goffe, Renaissance woman Michelle Posadas, and writer Wakzani Mhute traveled within and outside of the US, questioning the interplay of identity and change. In an interview with the elderly Carolyn Thomas, Rachel Goffe's buttery voice unveiled the horrors of eminent domain, while Posadas's journal shed light on the oppression faced by Filipinos. In Zimbabwe, women suffer from the \"unnamed disease that embarrasses everyone,\" as detailed in Mhute's rhythmic poem. Musical guest Paper Trees mesmerized the room with Allison Polans's deep and sultry voice as she, too, sang of identity and men. The award winners will surely inspire transformation with their art, as they have already done so this night in the Arts Café.\n\nMichaela Majoun - Introduction\n\nRachel Goffee - Introduction\n\nRachel Goffee - Interview\n\nKameelah Waheed - Introduction\n\nMichelle Posadas - Introduction\n\nMichelle Posadas - Journal Excerpts\n\nPaper Trees - Introduction\n\nPaper Trees - Pretender\n\nWakzanai Mhute - Introduction\n\nWakzanai Mhute - Short Illness\n\nWakzanai Mhute - The Torrent\n\nJudith Truestone - Introduction\n\nJudith Truestone - Imagine\n\nJudith Truestone - A Kinder, Gentler Murder\n\nPaper Trees - Seesaw Shuffle\n\nEpisode 68 - 01/28/2008 - Youth Poets from the Arts and Spirituality Center\n\nProduced by Erin Gautsche, hosted by Michaela Majoun\n\nYou can hear a recording of the entire program here.\n\nThe Kelly Writers House and WXPN hosted the talented poets of the Arts and Spirituality Center, an interfaith and nonprofit community of artists and activists. Cathy Cohen, founder and program director of We the Poets, which teaches children how to write, read, and present poetry, revealed the interaction of art and faith in her poems \"Speak a New Language\" and \"Walk on Fire.\" thirteen-year-old Safi Aziz talked about the the heart as our essence and seventeen-year-old Brandon Ramirez echoed this idea of expression in his poem \"Speaking My Soul.\" Bernard Collins, a teacher and poet amongst other things, explored the connections between poetry and visual arts in his poems \"Red\" and \"Warmth.\" Mary Francis and Jan Jeffries performed \"Akiwowo,\" the sound of maracas cut up by a hand hitting a drum, the beats coming closer and closer together as Francis raised an octave and allowed the audience to feel the full weight and power of her voice. Magda Martinez, winner of the Leeway Foundation Transformation Award, mixed Spanish and English in \"Cuentito peludo\" and \"Untitled Poems,\" where the journey for identity and the immediacy of Martinez's voice sent shivers down the spine. Fifteen-year-old Tammy Miller ended the night with poems inspired by events in her life. With a mix of veteran writers and newly proclaimed poets, the house was roused by voices of excitement and passion.\n\nMichaela Majoun - Introduction\n\nCathy Cohen - Introduction\n\nCathy Cohen - Girl On Fire\n\nCathy Cohen - Rose At The Door\n\nCathy Cohen - Lines Of Your Journey\n\nCathy Cohen - Speak A New Language\n\nCathy Cohen - Walk In White\n\nSafi Aziz - Introduction\n\nSafi Aziz - Let Me Write\n\nBernard Collins - Introduction\n\nBernard Collins - Red\n\nBernard Collins - The Conversation\n\nBernard Collins - Warmth\n\nBernard Collins - Two Thoughts\n\nBernard Collins - Trains\n\nMarcy, and Jan Jeffries Francis - Akiwowo\n\nBrandon Ramirez - Introduction\n\nBrandon Ramirez - Speaking My Soul\n\nBrandon Ramirez - Love Choice and Trust\n\nMagda Martinez - Introduction\n\nMagda Martinez - Cuentito Peludo\n\nMagda Martinez - Untitled Poems\n\nTammy Miller - Introduction\n\nTammy Miller - Mother Where Are You\n\nTammy Miller - As I Grew Up\n\nTammy Miller - Man On That Wave\n\nMarcy, and Jan Jeffries Francis - Thank You For This Day\n\nMichaela Majoun - Ending\n\nEpisode 67 - 11/26/2007 - Winds of Change: Philly Politics 2007\n\nProduced by Erin Gautsche, hosted by Michaela Majoun\n\nYou can hear a recording of the entire program here\n\nWhen Mayor Michael Nutter assumed office in 2008, Philadelphia had the highest homicide rate in the country, along with other less-than-savory issues. In this episode of LIVE, some of Philadelphia's most prominent political writers detailed the host of challenges facing the mayor. Chris Satullo, who spent a year teaching in France and writes the \"Center Square\" column for The Inquirer, and Dave Davies, a welder and cab driver who now reports for the Philadelphia Daily News, questioned whether Nutter was ready for the job and whether his supporters' patience would fray. Dan Urevick-Ackelsberg, who was taking a leave from Penn Law in hopes of joining the 2008 Olympic rowing team, urged citizens to take responsibility in choosing a \"muppet-voiced\" mayor while defiantly arguing against the implementation of \"Jetson-like\" sky-ways in Center City. Musical guest The Spinning Leaves focused more on the present — singing about homeless people, schizophrenics, pigeons, and love — while Mighty Writer Tim Whitaker referenced the past \"lame ducks\" of Philadelphia. Amidst the criticism and concern, however, the hope for Philadelphia's future remained apparent within these writers' perceptive prose.\n\nChris Satullo - Reading\n\nMichaela Majoun - Introduction\n\nDave Davies - Reading\n\nDan Urevick-Acklesberg - Reading\n\nThe Spinning Leaves - Try, Try, Try\n\nTim Whitaker - Reading\n\nThe Spinning Leaves - Bridges For Free\n\nEpisode 66 - 10/29/2007 - From Vaudeville to Video: 1812 Celebrates 100 Years of Comedy\n\nProduced by Erin Gautsche, hosted by Michaela Majoun\n\nYou can hear a recording of the entire program here.\n\nDavid Jadico told us what it's like to be \"on top of a performer\" (or else something rephrased to give a slightly less racy impression). Joining Jadico were comedians Jennifer Childs, Tony Braithwaite, Mary Carpenter, and Scott Greer, members of the 1812 Theatre company (along with all of the characters they brought with them). This performance of \"From Vaudeville to Video: 1812 Celebrate 100 Years of Comedy\" started with two baritones and a little strumming; two more people and a few decades earlier and you'd think you were listening to a barbershop quartet. Following were comedic sketches by our five guests: Jennifer Childs turned Bell Barth got friendly with the audience when she asked two in the crowd, \"hey how ya doin, you togetha? You two togetha?\" And then in a slightly higher pitch: \"you three togetha?\" She and Tony continued their sketch with soup, sex, and laughs from \"the best audience [they've] ever had.\" The team showed their real comedic genius when they improvised an old-time radio show, taking suggestions from the audience to give us \"the Smith Brothers Potato Peelers Comedy Club.\" After getting a little political and literally slowing things down with the STOA (slow talkers of America), the cast chatted with Michaela Majoun and revealed that the job is indeed as fun as it looks.\n\nTony Braithewaite - A Conversation\n\nMichaela Majoun - Introduction\n\nMary Carpenter - A Conversation\n\nJennifer Childs - A Conversation\n\nScott Greer - A Conversation\n\nDave Jadico - A Conversation\n\nVarious - Belle Barth impersonation\n\nVarious - Bob & Ray impersonation\n\nVarious - George & Gracie impersonation\n\nVarious - Improvised radio show\n\nVarious - Opening vaudeville-style song\n\nVarious - Political humour mock news segment\n\nVarious - Shel Silverstein song\n\nEpisode 65 - 09/24/2007 - Pocket Myths presents The Odyssey\n\nProduced by Erin Gautsche, hosted by Michaela Majoun\n\nYou can hear a recording of the entire program here.\n\nHomer's heroic epic, The Odyssey, received a playful makeover in this edition of LIVE. Featuring local poets, Pocket Myths unleashed the characters of the Odyssey through poetry, stories, and artwork. Writer and artist Emily Abendroth slurped, lashed, and tumbled into the character of Charybdis in her poem, \"Rather Than Things to Her Mouth, She Brought Her Mouth to Things.\" Temple professor Justin Audia flew to the sky (a result of blatantly stealing from Chapman, Gertrude Stein, and Kirk Cameron) in his piece about Aeolus, the wind king. Echoing her dual identity (Californian and Australian), poet Julia Bloch took on the soulful personas of both Anticlea and Persephone. New music then swept speech away in a cacophonous and writhing, yet melodious, piece performed by My Invisible and Jack Grauer. In a more contemporary setting, CA Conrad shared a \"Frank Poem,\" which contained traces of Odysseus's character, while poet Ryan Eckes read shorter myths of local content that echoed the theme of father and son — or, of Laertes and Odysseus. The evening finished with a haunting, wistful song from My Invisible — a song which Odysseus may even have sung as he wandered the Earth, hoping only to return home.\n\nMichaela Majoun - Introduction\n\nEmily Abendroth - Introduction\n\nEmily Abendroth - Rather Than Things to Her Mouth, She Brought Her Mouth to Things\n\nJustin Audia - Introduction\n\nJustin Audia - A Torrid Eye\n\nJulia Bloch - Introduction\n\nJulia Bloch - Persephone\n\nJulia Bloch - Anticlea\n\nJulia Bloch - I Dream of the Death of Buffy the Vampire Slayer\n\nMy Invisible - Introduction\n\nMy Invisible - Jelly\n\nCA Conrad - Introduction\n\nCA Conrad - Frank Poems\n\nRyan Eckes - Introduction\n\nRyan Eckes - Laertes\n\nRyan Eckes - Stolen Car\n\nRyan Eckes - Rite of Passage\n\nRyan Eckes - Caption\n\nRyan Eckes - If I Speak\n\nRyan Eckes - Immortality\n\nMy Invisible - Cypher\n\nEpisode 64 - 03/26/2007 - Philadelphia Zine Writers\n\nProduced and hosted by Erin Gautsche.\n\nYou can hear a recording of the entire program here.\n\nThe Kelly Writers House and WXPN invited a writers of Philadelphia-based zines, small-circulation publications, typically self-created and/or handmade. Katie Haegele, the evening's first zine writer, talked about Helen's Hands. Casey Grabowski took inspiration from his work as a civil engineer in his zine Reverse Engineering, and King Wenclas read excerpts from his 2001 zine novel, a post-9/1 satire. With chants of USA and then moments of silence, his reading was one full of war hysteria: \"KILL BLOOD DEATH WAR GET 'EM.\" Justin Duerr gave us similar imagery in his zine number 54 with \"a world … inhabited by lonely war-ridden bodies … where death stalks openly in dimly lit avenues.\" Philly-born talent Birdie Busch changed the tone of the evening with her folk/indie-esque songs expressing her love and appreciation for Philadelphia with \"South Philly\" and then … \"North Philly.\" Kate continued on the Philadelphia theme with her zine about Freemasons (and their books made of human skin).\n\nKatie Haegele - Introduction\n\nKatie Haegele - Breakdancing for the Pope\n\nKatie Haegele - Helen's Hands\n\nKatie Haegele - Ode to New Life\n\nKatie Haegele - The Lesson\n\nKatie Haegele - Stearocyte\n\nCasey Grabowski - Introduction\n\nCasey Grabowski - Reverse Engineering, Redevelopment...\n\nKing Wenclas - Introduction\n\nKing Wenclas - War Hysteria\n\nKing Wenclas - Expedition to Mars\n\nBirdie Busch - Introduction\n\nBirdie Busch - South Philly\n\nBirdie Busch - The Hub Singers\n\nKate Amock - Introduction\n\nKate Amock - on Stonemasons\n\nJustin Duerr - Introduction\n\nJustin Duerr - from Issue 54\n\nJustin Duerr - from Issue 51\n\nJustin Duerr - from Issue 50\n\nJulia Bloch - Anticlea\n\nEpisode 63 - 02/26/2007 - Penn Grad Student Poets\n\nProduced and hosted by Erin Gautsche.\n\nYou can hear a recording of the entire program here.\n\nA few of Penn's very own grad-student poets were featured in LIVE at the Kelly Writers House this Monday. Starting off the evening with letters to Kelly Clarkson and an appeal to \"reflect — drink a big chipped mug of compunction\" was Julia Bloch. Before coming to Penn to study twentieth-century poetry and poetics she worked in independent and progressive publishing, held staff and freelance gigs for various magazines and publications, and won a number of prizes for her writing. Dorothea Lasky, a School of Education student and coeditor of the Katalanche Press chapbook series followed with appeals to the Lord and claims to be the crusader. Jason Zuzga, an English Literature PhD student and 2005—2006 Merrill Writer-in-Residence in Stonington, Connecticut, offered video transcripts about making butter and Grotto Hill, as well as original works such as \"City Life\" and \"Sea Horse.\" Philadelphia singer-songwriter Adam Arcuragi drew us in with free-flowing, introspective lyrics and compelling harmonies as he sang \"Broken Throat\" and \"1981.\" Caroline Whitbeck, a Comparative Literature and Literary Theory PhD student, shared a number of poems ranging in topic from the dying pope to love. Playwright and poet Shonni Enelow added in a mix of theatrics when she performed \"unnamed\" and \"He Was National Jimmy…,\" the urgency of her words revealed through pants and stutters.\n\nErin Gautsche - Introduction\n\nJulia Bloch - Introduction\n\nJulia Bloch - from Letters to Kelly\n\nJulia Bloch - Persephone\n\nJulia Bloch - Anticlea\n\nJulia Bloch - Sky Time\n\nJulia Bloch - Ruinic\n\nJulia Bloch - Manhattanic\n\nDorothea Lasky - Introduction\n\nDorothea Lasky - On Old Ideas\n\nDorothea Lasky - Outside Chattanooga, Tennessee\n\nDorothea Lasky - Portrait of Me and Vladimer Mayakovsky\n\nDorothea Lasky - The Fire That Burns the Bird\n\nDorothea Lasky - Memories\n\nDorothea Lasky - The Process of Explication\n\nDorothea Lasky - The Animal\n\nJason Zuzga - Introduction\n\nJason Zuzga - Making Butter\n\nJason Zuzga - City Life\n\nJason Zuzga - Sea Horse\n\nJason Zuzga - Diet\n\nJason Zuzga - Documentary\n\nAdam Arcuragi - Introduction\n\nAdam Arcuragi - Broken Throat\n\nAdam Arcuragi - 1981\n\nCaroline Whitbeck - Introduction\n\nCaroline Whitbeck - Choke Cherry\n\nCaroline Whitbeck - They're All Out of Storm Names\n\nCaroline Whitbeck - See Daddy Make a Deal\n\nCaroline Whitbeck - Death Watch\n\nCaroline Whitbeck - from Inheritance\n\nShonni Enelow - Introduction\n\nShonni Enelow - Monologues\n\nShonni Enelow - He Was National Jimmy...\n\nShonni Enelow - unnamed\n\nShonni Enelow - 1947 Washington High School...\n\nEpisode 62 - 01/22/2007 - Leeway Foundation Award Winners\n\nProduced and hosted by Erin Gautsche.\n\nYou can hear a recording of the entire program here.\n\nJust as Thelma Shelton Robinson's gift of storytelling was passed down to her through her father, so too were the Leeway Foundation Award Winners' storytelling gifts passed on to the Writers House this evening. Seventy-four-year-old Robinson delivered a fervent account of Corinne Sites, a twenty-year old maid who was unceremoniously declared innocent of murder only after being sentenced to the electric chair twenty-five years earlier. Felicia Webster, founder of the self-love tour \"With Love, Felicia,\" performed a singsong poem about, well, love. The audience joined in with their own rhythmic snapping as Webster's voice ebbed and flowed with emotion. Musician Maudeline Swaray sung an upbeat tune, hoping to spread peace and to unite communities with her lively music. Also hoping to fuse communities, performance artist Davina Stewart demonstrated a historical double dutch jingle that would \"spread like wildfire\" amongst children. Gwynne Sigel, who is working on a multi-year oral history project, spun out tales of golden peacocks, winter, and man in a selection of translated Yiddish poetry, while Maudeline Swaray allowed French to influence her final song. These award winners truly delivered an equally chilling and inspiring night at the Arts Café.\n\nErin Gautsche - Introduction\n\nThelma Shelton Robinson - Introduction\n\nThelma Shelton Robinson - The Story of Corinne Sights\n\nFelicia Webster - Introduction\n\nFelicia Webster - Love?\n\nMaudeline Swaray - Introduction\n\nMaudeline Swaray - Let's Come Together Once More\n\nMaudeline Swaray - The Ring Song\n\nGwynne Sigel - Introduction\n\nGwynne Sigel - The Golden Peacock\n\nGwynne Sigel - Frumla\n\nGwynne Sigel - How Man Was Created\n\nDavina Stewart - Introduction\n\nDavina Stewart - from \"Ciam Lakey\"\n\nEpisode 61 - 11/13/2006 - Plan B Press\n\nProduced by Erin Gautsche, hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nPoets from Plan B Press, a publication dedicated to publishing contemporary poetry by beginning authors, emerged at the Writers House in this evening's edition of LIVE. With reflections of hope, surrealism, family, Philadelphia, and the beyond, their poems covered a range of topics. A soothing, meditative voice arose out of documentary filmmaker Daniel Collin as he read \"The Zen Man Seldom Held a Pen,\" a voice that starkly contrasted that which he used while delivering his political poem, \"Unthink, Unstop, Everywhere Blues\" (with, ehem, strategic bleeping). A bit more family-friendly, Jim Mancinelli's Dalí-influenced poems told tales of his Italian immigrant grandfather, Vincenzo, and his miller father. Philadelphia native Ryan Eckes took us home to the City of Brotherly Love as we travelled down Market Street, to the \"Bhagavad\" CVS, and then finally out the window. Motorcyclist Samantha Barrows voyaged to Louisiana Route 82, sweating all the way through. Sandy Crimmins, who recently collaborated with a fire-eater and some flamenco dancers, reflected on mangled bird legs and death, while musician Joshua Herd Park debated whether he should stay or go. If only this episode didn't go by quite so quickly!\n\nMichaela Majoun - Introduction\n\nDaniel Collins - Introduction\n\nDaniel Collins - The Zen Man Seldom Held a Pen\n\nDaniel Collins - After\n\nDaniel Collins - Unthink, unstop, everwear blues\n\nJim Mancinelli - Introduction\n\nJim Mancinelli - Ask\n\nJim Mancinelli - Vincenzo\n\nJim Mancinelli - A Mill Life\n\nJim Mancinelli - Saying Good-Bye\n\nJim Mancinelli - from chapbook \"Indeed\"\n\nRyan Eckes - Introduction\n\nRyan Eckes - Market Street\n\nRyan Eckes - Bus\n\nRyan Eckes - Cover Letter\n\nRyan Eckes - Development\n\nRyan Eckes - Stolen Car\n\nRyan Eckes - CVS\n\nRyan Eckes - Natividad\n\nRyan Eckes - Paying Respects\n\nRyan Eckes - Out the Window\n\nJoshua Heard Park - Introduction\n\nJoshua Heard Park - Quilt\n\nJoshua Heard Park - One Wish\n\nSandy Crimmins - Introduction\n\nSandy Crimmins - The Element of Air\n\nSandy Crimmins - Bird Wings\n\nSandy Crimmins - John Paul\n\nSandy Crimmins - on migranes\n\nSandy Crimmins - Momento More\n\nSamantha Barrows - Introduction\n\nSamantha Barrows - Dish\n\nSamantha Barrows - Watered-Down Red\n\nSamantha Barrows - Louisiana Route 82\n\nEpisode 60 - 10/30/2006 - Philadelphia Stories\n\nProduced by Erin Gautsche, hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nYou can hear a recording of the entire program here.\n\nThis installation of LIVE brought us back to the much-anticipated pre-bedtime ritual of childhood, story time (albeit one where parents are award-winning writers and regular contributors to literary journals). Writers Robin Parks, Curtis Smith, Marc Schuster, Raima Evan, and Scott Glassman from Philadelphia Stories, a region-specific literary magazine, as well as musical guest the Baird Sisters, came to share their original works. Parks, winner of the Raymond Carver Short Story Award, read \"identifying marks\" with a quiet intimacy that made us feel like recipients of some long-kept secret. Smith, a published novelist, told us \"the prettiest lie,\" one he wished to whisper in the ears of all the men and women who were cradled as babies once too. Curator of Philly's INVERSE reading series, Scott Glassman created imagery that dislocated and invited listeners into a strange world, the kind he prefers. The Baird Sisters joined in with acoustics and a mix of traditional Appalachian ballads and original pieces, starting off with \"Sugar Babe\" and ending with \"Willie Moore.\" Raima Evan, a playwright and UPenn PhD, invited us into the world and mind of \"Giddle Goldberg,\" who finds herself with a talking carp, and founder of the Elliot Court Writers Workshop, Marc Schuster, expressed his deep dismay at being the only one in the world who doesn't know Kurt Vonnegut. Each of the five authors shared a unique perspective and offered a fully formed world.\n\nRobin Parks - Introduction\n\nMichaela Majoun - Introduction\n\nRobin Parks - Identifying Marks\n\nCurtis Smith - Introduction\n\nCurtis Smith - The Prettiest Lie\n\nScott Glassman - Introduction\n\nScott Glassman - Day One: Postmark\n\nScott Glassman - Day Two: Burrough\n\nScott Glassman - Day Three: Corporeal\n\nScott Glassman - Day Five: Dunes\n\nScott Glassman - Day Ten: Eminence\n\nThe Baird Sisters - Introduction\n\nThe Baird Sisters - Sugar Babe\n\nThe Baird Sisters - Willie Moore\n\nRaima Evan - Introduction\n\nRaima Evan - untitled\n\nMarc Schuster - Introduction\n\nMarc Schuster - Everybody Knows...\n\nEpisode 59 - 09/25/2006 - Dish: Food Writers Read\n\nProduced by Erin Gautsche, hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nYou can hear a recording of the entire program here.\n\nOur taste buds tingled during tonight's episode of LIVE. Food connoisseurs filled the Arts Café with their humorous tales, providing not only laughter, but also health tips, to a well-seasoned audience. Jason Fagone, author of Horsemen of the Esophagus, chronicled Bill L. Wingadore's fight to victory at the Wing Bowl, noting that the victory cost (or won?) him 38,500 calories and 4,000 grams of fat for a bowl of saucy and not-so-meaty chicken wings. Carolyn Wyman, a tour guide at Reading Terminal Market, also offered health advice — claiming that \"I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!\" spray is the \"dieter's version of heaven,\" and that spam contains everything and anything an eater could want. Restaurant critics Craig Laban and Alyssa Ludwig revealed their four-bell rating system and love of strip mall restaurants, respectively, while Philadelphia native Rick Nichols predicted the next food trend in Philly. Musical guest Red Heart the Ticker finished the night off with a sweet voice and country tune about drinking.\n\nMichaela Majoun - Introduction\n\nJason Fagone - Introduction\n\nJason Fagone - On History of the Chicken Wing\n\nCaroline Wyman - Introduction\n\nCaroline Wyman - History of \"I Can't Believe It's Not Butter\"\n\nCaroline Wyman - On Pez\n\nCraig Laban - Introduction\n\nCraig Laban - Down the Wildwood Boardwalk\n\nRed Heart the Ticker - Jack Knives\n\nRed Heart the Ticker - Steel-Toed Drinking\n\nAlyssa Ludwig - Introduction\n\nAlyssa Ludwig - Local Food and the 100-Mile Diet\n\nRick Nichols - Introduction\n\nRick Nichols - Baker's Dilemma\n\nRick Nichols - In the Searon of Love, and Maybe War\n\nEpisode 58 - 04/24/2006 - Spring Celebration\n\nProduced by Erin Gautsche, hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nWriters and professionals Tracy Byford, Mike McGrath, Dr. Tomasz Anisiko, Moira Sheridan and Ilene Sternberg joined us this Monday to share stories, columns, and wisdom in celebration of spring. Tomasz Anisiko, who holds a doctorate in horticulture, read an excerpt from his book Plant Exploration for Longwood Gardens, where we are transported to a picturesque hillside covered in boxwood in Tbilisi, Georgia. Tracy Byford shared the story of how she got into gardening when she brought us to her backyard, starting with a bleeding heart that was gifted to her at the age of five and continuing to her current position as manager of the bio pond. Musical guest Kevin James Holland offered a different tribute to the spring in his song \"Anyone Will Do But Me,\" where with a buoyant melody and a melancholic tone he sang of love and devotion. Mike McGrath, host of WHYY 91FM show \"You Bet Your Garden,\" gave a mix of nostalgia and incredulity as he told the story of \"The Little Willow That Could.\" Moira Sheridan read one of her backyard gardener columns and explained her confusion at the concept of gardens as a place to relax, and Ilene Sternberg exclaimed with perturbation that when the neverending lawn mowers and leaf blowers finally quiet, \"I fear I've gone deaf,\" but such is \"life on a large lot.\" From history lessons to childhood explorations, spring was brought to life in the Arts Café.\n\nTomasz Anisiko - Introduction\n\nTomasz Anisiko - Return of the Argonauts\n\nTracy Byford - Introduction\n\nTracy Byford - How I Got Into Gardening\n\nKevin James Holland - Introduction\n\nKevin James Holland - Anyone Will Do But Me\n\nKevin James Holland - Pushing Up Daisies\n\nMike McGrath - Introduction\n\nMike McGrath - The Little Willow That Could\n\nMoira Sheridan - Introduction\n\nMoira Sheridan - Backyard Gardener\n\nIlene Sternberg - Introduction\n\nIlene Sternberg - Life on a Large Lot\n\nEpisode 57 - 03/27/2006 - Leeway Foundation Grant Winners\n\nProduced by Erin Gautsche, hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nYou can hear a recording of the entire program here.\n\nThis LIVE at the Writers House featured 2005 Leeway Foundation grant winners; the foundation awards grants to women, transgender, transsexual, and genderqueer artists working for social change. Suzanne Povse's story focused on the struggles and triumphs of being a skilled blue-collar female in an almost all-male occupation, speaking for those who are or were in similar positions. Taina Asili raised a different battle cry in \"The Birth of Yuppies,\" where with an infusion of jazz and blues as a backdrop Taina sang and yelled and repeated: \"I'm giving birth to a miracle, breathe, pushing him past genocide, breathe,\" letting \"breathe\" become a mantra in resisting colonialism. Ham'diya Mu's work, \"The Visit,\" reflected the pain inflicted by incarceration and the prison industrial complex, which she fights to change. Musical guests Josh Marcus and Josh Newman performed \"Coloured Smoke\" with a banjo and a folk/country feel, reflecting our propensity to not fully be present. Patience Rage, who empowers women by coaching them through telling their stories of incest, told her own story of fear, pain, and confusion. Tamika Nwalipengam, creator of a performing arts program for young single mothers, provided encouragement and hope to women by recounting her own struggles and how she overcame them. The Arts Café resonated with voices of triumph and pain with stories that truly embodied the Leeway Foundation's mission.\n\nTaina Asili - Introduction\n\nTaina Asili - The Art of Trust\n\nTaina Asili - The Birth of Yuppis\n\nJoshua Marcus - Introduction\n\nJoshua Marcus - Coloured Smoke\n\nJoshua Marcus - Introduction to \"Man Threatening Pipe Wrench\"\n\nJoshua Marcus - Man Threatening Pipe Wrench\n\nHam'diya Mu - Introduction\n\nHam'diya Mu - The Visit\n\nHam'diya Mu - A Mother's Anguish to Children Incarcerated Everywhere\n\nTamika Nwalipenga - Introduction\n\nTamika Nwalipenga - My Story\n\nSusanne Povse - Introduction\n\nSusanne Povse - Draw Press to Machinist\n\nPatience Rage - Introduction\n\nPatience Rage - My First Kiss\n\nEpisode 56 - 02/20/2006 - Love: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\n\nProduced by Erin Gautsche, hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nYou can hear the recording of the entire program here.\n\nIn tonight's episode of LIVE, an eclectic group of poets, scholars, and novelists came together to write about this crazy little thing called love. Hopelessly devoted, the aptly named Gweny Love sensually yearned for her \"own man,\" one that would make her \"part of his daily routine.\" Penn history PhD student, Greg Downs, didn't let words bring his characters down as each one told the other that they were beautiful. In his second story, \"Adam's Curse,\" the women told the men to hit the road — for they had made a pact to live entirely without men. When the sun went down and the stars came up, high-school student Lee, from author Curtis Sittenfeld's bestselling novel Prep, was thrilled that her longtime crush, reeking like sweet beer, came into her room … and her bed. In a delicate and soft country voice, singer Amy Pickard feared that her heart would be filled with ashes before love could grow. After walking 135 square miles, Nathaniel Popkin realized that Philadelphians were deeply and tragically in love with their city, while scholar Niama Williams just wanted to hold the hands (ehem) of Law and Order star Vincent D'Onofrio and the Piazza Honda guy. Tonight's writers certainly surrendered their hearts and souls to love and all of its aspects — the good, the bad, and the ugly.\n\nGweny Love - You're Part of My Daily Routine\n\nMichaela Majoun - introduction of Greg Downs\n\nGreg Downs - The Second Mile\n\nGreg Downs - Adam\n\nMichaela Majoun - introduction of Curtis Sittenfeld\n\nCurtis Sittenfeld - from Prep\n\nAmy Pickard - Ashes\n\nMichaela Majoun - introduction of Nathaniel Popkin\n\nNathaniel Popkin - from The Deep Was Round About Me\n\nMichaela Majoun - introduction of Niama Williams\n\nNiama Williams - Merging\n\nNiama Williams - For Vincent D'onofrio\n\nNiama Williams - Twin\n\nNiama Williams - Piazza Honda\n\nNiama Williams - For E\n\nMichaela Majoun - introduction of Gweny Love\n\nGweny Love - I Need Love\n\nAmy Pickard - Cut From the Hopeless\n\nEpisode 55 - 12/12/2005 - Women Music Writers\n\nProduced by Erin Gautsche, hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nFemale music writers took center stage on this evening's production of LIVE as they told tales of music obsessions and failures. Rather than \"romanticizing guys with guitars,\" Columbia graduate student Daphne Carr worshipped Christian rock, while Princeton assistant professor Daphne Brooks lauded black women rockers. Maura Johnston, editor at majorleaguebaseball.com, failed to be properly obsessed with rock-and-roll as a fifteen-year-old — she didn't even wear a denim skirt or sip beer! In a silky, sultry, and hesitant voice (quite the opposite of a rock-and-roller), Buried Beds sang of innocence and maturity. Doree Shafrir, former A&E editor at Philadelphia Weekly, drew parallels between indie rock and skinny Jewish boys, while wig collector Sara Sherr couldn't help but compare her work as a record retailer to a horror film. Demonstrating knowledge in a variety of musical genres, these women brought humor and scholarship to their stories.\n\nDaphne Brookes - Introduction\n\nDaphne Brookes - All You Can't Leave Behind\n\nBuried Beds - Camellia\n\nBuried Beds - Song\n\nBuried Beds - Insomnia\n\nDaphne Carr - Introduction\n\nDaphne Carr - Why on Earth or Elsewhere\n\nMaura Johnston - Introduction\n\nMaura Johnston - Untitled\n\nDoree Shafrir - Introduction\n\nDoree Shafrir - The Shiva of Indie Rock\n\nSara Sherr - Introduction\n\nSara Sherr - Adventures in Record Retail\n\nEpisode 54 - 10/06/2005 - 2-1-5 Literary Festival\n\nProduced by Erin Gautsche, hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nWXPN and the Writers House hosted the 2-1-5 Literary Festival this Monday. Founded in 2001, the festival celebrates written, spoken, and visualized word. Ron Swegman started the night with an excerpt from his novel Philadelphia on the Fly, telling us that he writes and fishes for \"a specific kind of solitude … a desire to experience the new, alone.\" Fellow author Lord Whimsy swore allegiance with animation and vigor to the color green: \"bringer of balance\" and \"the color divine.\" The Absinthe Drinkers, making a different tribute to green in their band name, performed their original pop and funk songs. With voices deep, sonorous, and vibrating like a bass guitar, the group sang in unison of Macbeth, love, and murder. Christian Bauman read an excerpt from his novel \"voodoo lounge\" with power and authenticity; he spoke with the voice of his female protagonist, an army sergeant standing naked in the window. CA Conrad used the strength of his own voice in his poem to the president (who he has yet to hear back from): \"I have a lot of love Mr. President, and I just want to press against you sometimes to let you get a little of it.\" Jim Gladstone used fictional elephants Babar and Celeste to remind us of the uplifting power of ideals. Authors were able to both showcase their talent and give us a peek at the vibrant Philadelphia community they've come from.\n\nAbsinthe Drinkers - Introduction\n\nAbsinthe Drinkers - Macbeth\n\nAbscinthe Drinkers - Agamemnon's Return\n\nChristian Bauman - Introduction\n\nChristian Bauman - Exerpt from Woodoo Lounge\n\nCA Conrad - Introduction\n\nCA Conrad - To the President\n\nJim Gladstone - Introduction\n\nJim Gladstone - Elephants Who Need Elephants\n\nLord Whimsy - Introduction\n\nLord Whimsy - Green: The Color Divine\n\nRon Swegman - Introduction\n\nRon Swegman - Philadelphia on the Fly\n\nEpisode 53 - 04/05/2005 - All New York City Poets Live\n\nProduced by Tom Devaney with assistance from Jeff Lieder, directed by Beth Warshaw, and hosted by Michaela Majoun.\n\nThe Kelly Writers House bit into the Big Apple in tonight's edition of LIVE. New York City poets graced the Arts Café with their reflective and humorous poems. John Coletti paired seemingly random phrases together (steady sage, grade grubbing) to produce complex layers of meaning. Columnist for The Constant Critic Jordan Davis criticized his parents for their naming choices (Horace, and then Jordan) and even spurred the audience into repetitively chanting \"good for you.\" Though it may have appeared as though Jordan Davis was a hypnotist, teacher Sharon Mesmer could better claim that title — she is a relative of the man who invented hypnosis! Mesmer, in the guise and skins of others, rapidly changed her identity with each poem. Elinor Nauen, who enjoys writing about cars and baseball, presented a lively tale about \"pink highways.\" Finally, \"little bit of everything\" musician Edmund Berrigan performed sweetly melancholic songs and left the task of revealing their meanings to the audience. A thought-provoking evening, this LIVE demanded the audience to consider questions of identity, character, and the universe.\n\nEdmund Berrigan - Caught in the Human Shredder\n\nEdmund Berrigan - Introduction\n\nEdmund Berrigan - Mostly Harmless\n\nEdmund Berrigan - Once I Had an Earthquake\n\nJohn Coletti - A New Round of Touche\n\nJohn Coletti - Champ Little Groom\n\nJohn Coletti - Everyone I Want to Be\n\nJohn Coletti - Human Flower\n\nJohn Coletti - Introduction\n\nJohn Coletti - It's a Substitute for Thinking\n\nJohn Coletti - Lost Weekend\n\nJohn Coletti - Old Black Boots\n\nJohn Coletti - Siphon\n\nJordan Davis - A Brother on the Baltic\n\nJordan Davis - Almost Named Horrace\n\nJordan Davis - Chanting Monotonously\n\nJordan Davis - Distance Learning\n\nJordan Davis - How Are You I Am Fine\n\nJordan Davis - Introduction\n\nJordan Davis - Ira Will Not Be Attending the Meeting\n\nJordan Davis - Relaxing Poems\n\nSharon Mesmer - Gait Signatures\n\nSharon Mesmer - I Wanted to Compose a Canticle of Exaltation and Praise\n\nSharon Mesmer - Introduction\n\nSharon Mesmer - My Juice\n\nElinor Nauen - Introduction\n\nElinor Nauen - Pink Highways\n\nEpisode 51 - 01/31/2005\n\nProduced by Tom Devaney.\n\nIn this episode of LIVE, the Arts Café featured a cross-section of Philadelphia writers whose stories broke the city limits. Author J.C. Hallman read an excerpt from his book, The Chess Artist, in which he and his close friend, Glen, travel to Russia to discover the birth of chess. Native Philadelphian Octavia McBride-Ahebee dedicated her heart-wrenching poems to the suffering women of Africa. One poem, \"The Water God,\" brought to life the chilling death of a young child who was discarded for the benefit of the group. Temple professor Pattie McCarthy described the sometimes-embarrassing effects of intersecting cultures in her poem \"Otherwise (an eke name),\" while editor of Hinchas de Poesía, Will Esposito, shared new words (\"Hako\" which translates to box) and places (Hyde Park) in his reflective and sweeping poems. Ian Keenan, who is six years into his Künstlerroman, read a series of poems rooted in punny wordplay — the most effective of which, \"Super Sestina,\" concerned football and using adjectives as adverbs. Cynthia G. Mason's haunting voice then swelled in the Arts Café as she performed melancholic and mystical songs with her good friend Larry. Throughout the show, these writers poignantly traversed cultures, boundaries, and expectations."
