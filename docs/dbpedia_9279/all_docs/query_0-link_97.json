He also made important contributions to such diverse fields as x-rays, remote control, radio, the theory of consciousness or electromagnetism. In his honour, the international unit of magnetic induction was named after him. Yet, his fame is scarce in comparison with that of other inventors of the time, such as Edison, with whom he had several heated arguments. He was a rather odd, reserved person who lived for his inventions, the ideas for which came to him in moments of inspiration. In his autobiography he relates these flashes with a number of neuropsychiatric manifestations, which can be seen to include migraine auras, synaesthesiae, obsessions and compulsions.\n\nNIKOLA TESLA AND MEDICINE: 160TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH OF THE GENIUS WHO GAVE LIGHT TO THE WORLD - PART II.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nVucevic, Danijela; Dordevic, Drago; Radosavljevic, Tatjana\n\n2016-11-01\n\nNikola Tesla (1856- 1943) was a genius inventor and scientist, whose contribution to medicine is remarkable. Part I of this article reviewed special contributions of the world renowned scientist to the establishment of radiology as a new discipline in medicine. This paper deals with the use of Tesla currents in medicine. Tesla Currents in Medicine. Tesla's greatest impact on medicine is his invention of a transformer (Tesla coil) for producing high frequency and high voltage currents (Tesla currents). Tesla currents are used in diathermy, as they, while passing through the body, transform electrical energy into a therapeutic heat. In 1891, Tesla passed currents through his own body and was the first to experience their beneficial effects. He kept correspondence on electrotherapy with J. Dugan and S. H. Monell. In 1896, he used high frequency currents and designed an ozone generator for producing ozone, with powerful antiseptic and antibacterial properties. Tesla is famous for his extensive experiments with mechanical vibrations and resonance, examining their effects on the organ ism and pioneering their use for medical purposes. Tesla also designed an oscillator to relieve fatigue of the leg muscles. It is less known that Tesla's inventions (Tesla coil and wireless remote control) are widely used in modern medical equipment. Apart from this, wireless technology is nowadays widely applied in numerous diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Nikola Tesla was the last Renais- sance figure of the modern era. Tesla bridged three centuries and two millennia by his inventions, and permanently indebted humankind by his epochal discoveries.\n\nNellâanno di Nikola Tesla\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nPersida LazareviÄ Di Giacomo\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe 150th Anniversary Celebration of Nikola Tesla The paper deals with the 150th anniversary celebration of Nikola Tesla, the greatest ever Yugoslav scientist.

Due to his origins, Tesla is contended between Serbia and Croatia, but he is also considered to be an American scientist since he registered most of his patents in the USA. Although there is some dissension between Serbia and Croatia regarding the historical facts about Teslaâs life, it can be asserted that Tesla appears to be an example of collaboration among the former Yugoslav countries. Tesla, however, deserves to be remembered as well as the author of autobiographical prose (My Inventions; Some Personal Recollections; A Strange Experience by Nikola Tesla and as the protagonist of many works published in Serbo-Croatian and in English, such as MiloÅ¡ Crnjanskiâs drama Tesla (1969 or The Hunger and Ecstasy of Vampires (1996 by Brian M.

New developments in thermodynamics, energy physics, and electricity and magnetism dictated new properties of the ether. These have traditionally been examined from the perspective of the scientists re-conceptualizing the ether. However Nikola Tesla, a prolific inventor and writer, presents a different picture of nineteenth century physics. Alongside the displays that showcased his inventions he presented alternative interpretations of physical, physiological and even psychical research. This is particularly evident in his telautomaton, a radio remote controlled boat. This invention and Tesla's descriptions of it showcase some of his novel interpretations of physical theories. He offered a perspective on nineteenth century physics that focused on practical application instead of experiment. Sometimes the understanding of physical theories that Tesla reached was counterproductive to his own inventive work; other times he offered new insights. Tesla's utilitarian interpretation of physical theories suggests a more scientifically curious and invested inventor than previously described and a connection between the scientific and inventive communities.\n\nExcerpts from Prodigal Genius: The Life of Nikola Tesla\n\nIndian Academy of Sciences (India)\n\nHome; Journals; Resonance â Journal of Science Education; Volume 12; Issue 3.

The potential market for the use of fly ash is operational, but for the time being, only used by cement producers. Fly ash radioactivity could be one of the major points of concern when larger use of fly ash is planned, particularly in the Serbian construction industry. Radioactivity measurements have been conducted regularly for decades. This paper presents the results of a ten-year fly ash radioactivity measurements at the Nikola Tesla B TPP located in Obrenovac. In addition, the paper compares the natural radionuclides coal content data combusted by the Nikola Tesla B TPP boilers coming from the Kolubara Basin and ash created during coal combustion. Fly ash created in the Nikola Tesla TPPs boilers is characterised by the increased concentration of the natural radionuclides content compared to coal. This is the so-called technologically enhanced natural radioactivity (Technologically Enhanced Occurring Radioactive Material - TENORM of industrial waste, whereas the average specific activities: 232Th in coal amount to 25.2 Bq/kg, and in fly ash and coal 84.2 Bq/kg and 238U 38.3 Bq/kg, respectively. Following the obtained natural radionuclides content results it may be concluded that the Nikola Tesla B TPP ash may be disposed into the environment. Ash may be used also in the construction industry (civil engineering. In building construction applications, ash share as the additive to other building materials depends from its physical and chemical characteristics, as well as from the radionuclides activity: 266Ra, 232Th and 40K. Unlike the thermal power plants regularly (once a year testing the specific natural radionuclides activity in the combusted coal and boiler fly ash, Electric Power Industry of Serbia has not performed large-scale investigations of the natural radionuclides content in coal within the Kolubara\n\nNIKOLA TESLA AND MEDICINE: 160TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH OF THE GENIUS WHO GAVE LIGHT TO THE WORLD - PART I.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nVucevic, Danijela; Dordevic, Drago; Radosavljevic, Tatjana\n\n2016-09-01\n\nThe interest in Nikola Tesla, a scientist, physicist, engineer and inventor, is constantly growing. In the millennialong history of human civilization, it is almost impossible to find another person whose life and work has been under so much scrutiny of such a wide range of researchers, medical professionals included. Although Tesla was not primarily dedicated to biomedical research, his work significantly contributed to the development of radiology, and high frequency electrotherapy. This paper deals with the impact of Tesla's work on the development of a new medical branch - radiology. Nikola Tesla and the Discovery of X-ray radiation. Tesla pioneered the use of X-rays for medical purposes, practically laying the foundations of radiology. Namely, since 1887, Tesla periodically experimented with X-rays, at that time still unknown and unnamed, which he called \"shadowgraphs\". Moreover, at the end of 1894, lie conducted extensive research focusing on X-rays, but unfortunately it was inlerrupted after the fire burning down his laboratory in 1895. In 1896 and 1897, Tesla published ten papers on the biologic effects of X-ray radiation. All his studies on X-rays were experimental. During 1896 and 1897, Tesla continued improving X-ray devices. Apart from this, Tesla was the first to point out the harmful effects of exposure to X-ray radiation on human body. Nikola Tesla was a visionary genius of the future. Tesla's pioneer steps, made more than a century ago in the domain of radiology, are still being used today.\n\nNikola Tesla: Why was he so much resisted and forgotten? [Retrospectroscope].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nValentinuzzi, Max E; Ortiz, Martin Hill; Cervantes, Daniel; Leder, Ron S\n\n2016-01-01\n\nRecently, during the Christmas season, a friend of mine visited me and, sneaking a look at my bookshelves, found two rather old Nikola Tesla biographies, which I had used to prepare a \"Retrospectroscope\" column for the then-named IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine when our dear friend Alvin Wald was its editor-inchief [2]. Eighteen years have elapsed since then; soon, the idea came up of revamping the article. Cynthia Weber, the magazine's current associate editor, considered it acceptable, and here is the new note divided in two parts: that is, a slightly revised version of the original article followed by new material, including some quite interesting information regarding Tesla's homes and laboratories. On top of this, Tesla is not devoid of a science fiction touch, as mentioned at the end.\n\nEncouraging a \"Romantic Understanding\" of Science: The Effect of the Nikola Tesla Story\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHadzigeorgiou, Yannis; Klassen, Stephen; Klassen, Cathrine Froese\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to discuss and apply the notion of romantic understanding by outlining its features and its potential role in science education, to identify its features in the story of Nikola Tesla, and to describe an empirical study conducted to determine the effect of telling such a story to Grade 9 students.

Since the generators of TPP 'Nikola Tesla B' have the greatest power in the power system of Serbia, it was necessary to achieve high reliability of the excitation system so that the process of producing electricity is not endangered Considering this, the implemented excitation system uses modern technology with redundancy both in the power and control blocks, which resulted in an increase in the hot reserve by 100%. In addition, it was necessary to adjust the excitation system to increased generator power and performance from 618MW to 667.5MW. In this paper, the main parameters of the excitation system are given: the power, the excitation system control, the thyristor ignition system, the event recorder system, the digital relay protection, as well as the measuring and signaling functions.\n\nNORM in the vicinity of the thermal power plant 'Nikola Tesla' B - experimental results\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKisic, D.; Veselinovic, N.; Tokonami, S.; Celikovic, I.; Stojanovic, Z.; Cuknic, O.; Nemcevic, M.; Simovic, R.; Zunic, Z.

PORTRAITS OF SCIENTISTS ON THE BANKNOTES OF YUGOSLAVIA, SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO AND SERBIA. Nikola Tesla and Mihailo Pupin Idvorski were the ingenious inventors and scientists of our time who made special contributions to radiology. Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) pioneered the use of X-rays for medical purposes, thus effectively laying the foundations of radiology and radiography, and revealed the existence of harmful effects of X-rays on the human body. Mihailo Pupin Idvorski (1854-1935) was worldwide famous for applying physics in practice, as well as in the basis of telephone and telegraph transmissions. He also studied the nature of X-rays and contributed to establishing of radiology. PORTRAITS OF SCIENTISTS ON THE BANKNOTES OF THE WORLD: Maria Sklodowska Curie (1867-1934) was the first woman to gain the academic title of the Academy of Medicine, Paris. Together with her husband Pierre Curie (1859-1906) she gave an outstanding contribution to science and medicine. The discovery of the radioactive elements introduced the concept of \"radioactivity\" into physics and \"radiotherapy\" as a new discipline in medicine, thus creating the conditions for the development of nuclear medicine, oncology, and mobile diagnostic radiology. This paper presents the banknotes featuring the portraits of Nikola Tesla, Mihailo Pupin Idvorski, Maria Sklodowska Curie and Pierre Curie, the world renowned scientists, who made enormous contributions to medicine and laid the foundation for radiology.\n\nExperimental coal dust suppression system installed at the Nikola Tesla thermal power plant\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nGuzijan, D [Rudarski Institut, Belgrade (Yugoslavia).

The airports Both of the airports have their own TMA, but currently there are conventional SID and STAR flows for 'Nikola Tesla' running through TMA 'Batajnica' while procedures for 'Batajnica' are issued only as temporary for special flights. Procedure design A detailed overview of procedure design includes general considerations, the principles on which the design is based, design of turns, maps of inbound flows featuring holdings and missed approach segments. Holdings All holdings, including both in approach and in missed approach for both airports are defined in accordance with RNP holding criteria and in a way that aircraft inbound from as many as possible flows could use them. Final approaches All final approaches consist of a single TF leg (Track to Fix. Containment areas are linear and all their elements are determined by RNP 0.3. Baro-VNAV is used for vertical guidance. Missed approach segments with MAP holdings In design of missed approach segment only TF legs were used for a straight flight and RF legs for turns. The priority was minimization of total complexity in the segment which is why the minimal number of legs was used and turn amplitude was limited. Conclusion Implementation of RNP AR APCH in combination with Baro- VNAV and CDA at 'Nikola Tesla' and 'Batajnica' would bring many benefits without any observed negative side effects. Note The topic is addressed with far more details in diploma thesis of Vojislav MilosavljeviÄ, originally titled 'Procedure za prilaz i sletanje na aerodrome 'Nikola Tesla' i 'Batajnica' primenom RNP AR APCH i Baro-VNAV' defended at The Faculty of Traffic and Transport Engineering, Belgrade, Serbia, on July, 7th 2008.

William Gilbert (1540-1603) initiated the era of scientific investigation, followed by advances in later centuries by Otto von Guericke (1602-1686), Abbe Nollet (1700-1770), Luigi Galvani (1737-1798), Alessandro Volta ( 1745-1827), Michael Faraday (1791-1867) and Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) among others. Although electrotherapy was infrequently used to treatment malignancy, it was to make a major contribution to cancer therapy because the experience gained in electrotherapeutics paved the way for the rapid adoption of diagnostic and therapeutic radiology. Within a year of rontge's discovery, more than a thousand books, pamphlets and papers about X-rays were published.

By using the methods of alpha and gamma spectrometry, as well as luminescence spectrophotometry, it has been found that the ash repository is a source of radionuclides of the uranium and thorium series and spreads direction of ground waters up to a distance of several hundred metres. The influence of the repository on the soil radioactivity has been found to be minimal, whereas the balance of the first members of series ( 238 U- 234 U- 230 Th; 232 Th- 228 Th) has not been disturbed.

His inventions, patents, and theoretical work formed the basis of modern AC electricity, and contributed to the development of radio and television. Like his competitor Thomas Edison, Tesla was one of America's first celebrity scientists, enjoying the company of New York high society and dazzling the likes of Mark Twain with his electrical demonstrations.

Due to its vast area, that is for an effective plot of about 400 ha, under unfavorable meteorological conditions the emerging of ash cloud spreading over the surrounding area at distances of over 15 km could be produced. This paper deals with accident conditions at ash disposal area which, after stopping of sprinkling operation or in case of an inadequate sequence of ash tapping, when larger portions of disposal area are dried, turn into area of air polluting sources. Computations of particle dispersions under such conditions have been performed for different meteorological conditions and the results are represented as space distribution of particle deposition on the soil and their concentration in the air.

Building upon that massive body of research, in this paper we investigate actual dynamic pricing patterns in new and emerging markets. We specifically focus on the impact that recent entry of low cost carriers on a number of routes from Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport might have had on pricing practices of legacy incumbents. Unlike with most of previous contributions in the field, we analyse the market characterised by relatively low frequencies and predominantly short-to-medium haul flights. In this paper, we observe and analyse pricing dynamics on two types of routes: routes where only legacy carriers operate and routes where legacy carriers face competition from low cost carriers. The effects of route competition on offered airline fares are estimated and conclusions derived.\n\nLiving laboratory for Nikola Tesla.

The concentrations of the different elements obtained in the extractions were statistically analysed. The majority of the examined elements were found to be most probably associated with inorganic fractions of lignite, only aluminum, silicon, chromium and arsenic have a larger extractable organic/sulfide fraction than an extractable inorganic fraction. Alumosilicates of magnesium (carriers of arsenic, zinc, lead, copper and chromium, silicates of potassium (scavengers of lead and nickel, mixed aluminates of iron and magnesium (carriers of arsenic, zinc, copper and chromium and compounds of iron that do not contain aluminum and magnesium (scavengers of manganese were dissolved in the fifth phase of the sequential extraction. Copper is a substrate of alumosilicates of potassium and magnesium, while zinc and chromium are substrates of compounds of iron leached in the third phase of the sequential extraction.

Tesla not only discovered the rotating magnetic field, the basis of most alternating current machinery, but also introduced the fundamentals of robotry, computers, and missile science and helped pave the way for such technologies as satellites, microwaves, beam weapons, and nuclear fusion. Almost supernaturally gifted, Tesla was also unusually erratic, flamboyant, and neurotic. He was J. P. Morgan's client, counted Mark Twain as a friend, and considered Thomas Edison an enemy. But above all, he was the hero and mentor to many of the last century's most famous scientists.

It introduces the operating principle of the Tesla turbine, which was invented by engineer Nikola Tesla, a turbine which uses discs instead of blades, mounted on a shaft at a small distance between them. The turbine geometry, results from stress and flow calculations performed on the turbine rotor and assembly, using the Simulation modules and SolidWorks Flow Simulation program are presented. After designing the turbine, it becomes the subject of experimental research to determine the curve of the speed depending on the pressure. Also, the experimental research focuses on the behaviour of the turbine from a dynamic point of view [3].\n\nProject for solving of environmental problems caused by ash emission and deposition from the thermal power plant 'Nikola Tesla' at Obrenovac\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSimonovic, B.R.; Vukmirovic, Z.; Ilic, M.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nThe problem of ash emission and deposition from the Thermal Power Plant 'Nikola Tesla' (TPPNT) in Obrenovac commences with the date of their construction. Up to now, mainly, some analysis of several possible influences of ash (emitted or deposited on the ash and slug dump) was done. We believe that is time now, due to the consequences for a long time, to pose and to resolve the whole problem of ash emission and deposition from TPPNT Obrenovac. Due to the very big production capacity, an enormous amount of fly ash (particle size of 90-200 Î¼m) is emitted to a large area near Obrenovac. Very large quantities of ash and slug (more than 2 millions tons annually) produced during coal burning were deposited on the dump very close to the river Sava. Some of the multiple consequences due to elution of heavy metals, water spilling from the dump and mixing with ground water and surface water of river Sava, weathering of fine particles of ash by wind, acid rains near to the thermal power plants, and other influences of flying and deposited ash on the environment of the whole area are always present. Due to the complexity of the posed problem, a multidisciplinary experts' team was formed to cover all aspects of negative influences of ash emission and deposition from TPPNT Obrenovac. Our project comprises a large number of subprojects covering different problem solving, diminution or removal of all negative influences according to European standards and regulations.

This paper presents the results of a water regime analysis, photosynthetic efficiency and trace elements (B, Cu, Mn, Zn, Pb, and Cd) content in vegetative plant parts. Water regime parameters indicate an overall stability in plant-water relations. During the period of summer drought, photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm) was low, ranging from 0.429 to 0.620 for all the species that were analyzed. An analysis of the tissue trace elements content showed a lower trace metal concentration in the plants than in the ash, indicating that heavy metals undergo major concentration during the combustion process and some are not readily taken up by plants. The Zn and Pb concentrations in all of the examined species were normal whereas Cu and Mn concentrations were in the deficiency range. Boron concentrations in plant tissues were high, with some species even showing levels of more than 100 microg/g (Populus sp., Ambrosia sp., Amorpha sp., and Cirsium sp.). The presence of Cd was not detected. In general, it can be concluded from the results of this research that biological recultivation should take into account the existing ecological, vegetation, and floristic potential of an immediate environment that is abundant in life forms and ecological types of plant species that can overgrow the ash deposit relatively quickly. Selected species should be adapted to toxic B concentrations with moderate demands in terms of mineral elements (Cu and Mn).\n\nResonance â Journal of Science Education | Indian Academy of ...\n\nIndian Academy of Sciences (India)\n\nVolume 12 Issue 3 March 2007 pp 54-69 General Article.

The center of the view is toward the west-southwest. The rover had driven 25.82 meters (84.7 feet) west-northwestward earlier on Sol 1856. This is the longest drive on Mars so far by a rover using only five wheels. Spirit lost the use of its right-front wheel in March 2006. Before Sol 1856, the farthest Spirit had covered in a single sol's five-wheel drive was 24.83 meters (81.5 feet), on Sol 1363 (Nov. 3, 2007).

He finished his elementary and highschool in Skopje, and the School of Fine Arts in Bucharest in the period from 1920 to 1927. After completing his education in Romania, Nikola Martinoski travelled to Paris for his artistic development. He accepted one version of expressionism while he was there which gave him the opportunity to express himself most suitably as a painter, but at the same time it gave him a chance to take a stand as an intellectual being in the world where he lived. Martinoski returned to Skopje at the end of 1928 where he lived and worked until his death in 1973. He painted nudes, portraits, still life and landscapes. The themes such as:a mother and her child, nursing mothers, a gypsy woman, a wedding, all take a special place in his work, and he painted dozens of such compositions in different versions. This paper also gives the analysis of his paintings such as: a Turkish Woman, and a Gypsy Girl, which are kept at the National Museum in Nis, but which are unknown to the general public, There is also a painting called Jannah III, from the private collection of Mirjana Djukic from Nis, which has never been exhibited and which hasnât been written about.\n\nInvestigation of coal dust explosion hazard at the Nikola Tesla-A thermal power station\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nGolubovic, D\n\n1987-10-01\n\nReports on investigations into coal dust explosion hazards in working places with high coal dust exposure, done in the Tesla-A thermal power station by Mining Institute of Belgrade specialists. Settled and floating coal dust concentrations were monitored for six months and samples analyzed for explosibility under lab conditions. Samples from transport and preparation facilities and the power station boiler house were taken. The entire plant was divided into 4 zones, depending on intensity of dust settlement and ventilation system. Coal dust generation varied from 0.3-65 g/min. Daily dust settlement ranged between 40 and 300 g/m/sup 2/. Total quantity of accumulated coal dust in the power plant ranged from 0.8-650 kg/day; 250 g/m/sup 3/ of coal dust may cause an explosion. Thus, a dangerous amount of coal dust, depending on work-site, will settle in 3.3.-21.8 days. Disturbance of settled dust may create explodable clouds.

A dimensÃ£o da unidade remota ou sensora constitui um grande desafio dentro desta Ã¡rea, sendo que na maioria dos casos,deseja-se uma unidade o menor possÃ­vel. Desta maneira, sensores passivos sÃ£o interessantes, pois possibilitam uma menor dimensÃ£o do dispositivo e nÃ£o necessitam de uma fonte prÃ³pria de energia, ou bateria, que pode causar danos ao indivÃ­duo monitorado caso ocorra vazamento do seu conteÃºdo quÃ­mico. Deste modo,o sensor indutivo autorressonante apresenta-se como uma boa soluÃ§Ã£o, uma vez que este pode ser construÃ­do com apenas um componente, neste caso um indutor.Por apresentar pequenas dimensÃµes, este tipo de sensor possui uma baixa capacitÃ¢ncia parasita, o que torna a sua frequÃªncia de ressonÃ¢ncia bastante alta. Neste caso, a bobina bifilar idealizada por Nikola Tesla pode constituir-se de uma soluÃ§Ã£o, uma vez que a idÃ©ia de Tesla era de aumentar a capacitÃ¢ncia intrÃ­nseca de suas bobinas. Portanto, um entendimento fÃ­sico e devido equacionamento da bobina bifilar se faz necessÃ¡rio, uma vez que, atÃ© onde se sabe, este tipo de abordagem nÃ£o existe na literatura.A partir de uma anÃ¡lise das tensÃµes entre espiras adjacentes, foi desenvolvido neste trabalho um equacionamento da bobina bifilar de Tesla, possibilitando a determinaÃ§Ã£o do aumento da capacitÃ¢ncia interna e, consequente, reduÃ§Ã£o na frequÃªncia de ressonÃ¢ncia desta bobina. Um modelo elÃ©trico equivalente da bobina foi tambÃ©m elaborado atravÃ©s desta anÃ¡lise. Isto possibilita o projeto de bobinas bifilares e prediÃ§Ã£o dos parÃ¢metros capacitÃ¢ncia e frequÃªncia de autorressonÃ¢ncia desta bobina.

Sixteen neurosurgical patients (male nâ=â5, female nâ=â11) with single or multiple UIA were enrolled in this trial. All patients were accordingly examined at 7 Tesla and 1.5 Tesla MRI utilizing dedicated head coils.

Image analysis was performed by two radiologists with regard to delineation of aneurysm features (dome, neck, parent vessel), presence of artifacts, vessel-tissue-contrast and overall image quality. Interobserver accordance and intermethod comparisons were calculated by kappa coefficient and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient. A total of 20 intracranial aneurysms were detected in 16 patients, with two patients showing multiple aneurysms (nâ=â2, nâ=â4). Out of 20 intracranial aneurysms, 14 aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation and 6 aneurysms in the posterior circulation. 7 Tesla MPRAGE imaging was superior over 1.5 and 7 Tesla TOF MRA in the assessment of all considered aneurysm and image quality features (e.g. image quality: mean MPRAGE7T: 5.0; mean TOF7T: 4.3; mean TOF1.5T: 4.3). Ratings for 7 Tesla TOF MRA were equal or higher over 1.5 Tesla TOF MRA for all assessed features except for artifact delineation (mean TOF7T: 4.3; mean TOF1.5T 4.4). Interobserver accordance was good to excellent for most ratings. 7 Tesla MPRAGE imaging demonstrated its superiority in the detection and assessment of UIA as well as overall imaging features, offering excellent interobserver accordance and highest scores for all ratings. Hence, it may bear the potential to serve as a high-quality diagnostic tool for pretherapeutic assessment and\n\nTaxonomic revision of the Elephant Pupinid snail genus Pollicaria Gould, 1856 (Prosobranchia, Pupinidae\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBangon Kongim\n\n2013-04-01\n\nFull Text Available The status of species currently assigned to the Southeast Asian Elephant Pupinid snail genus Pollicaria Gould, 1856 is reassessed.

Inst.\n\n2006-12-08\n\nRX J1856.5-3754 is one of the brightest nearby isolated neutron stars, and considerable observational resources have been devoted to it. However, current models are unable to satisfactorily explain the data. We show that our latest models of a thin, magnetic, partially ionized hydrogen atmosphere on top of a condensed surface can fit the entire spectrum, from X-rays to optical, of RX J1856.5-3754, within the uncertainties. In our simplest model, the best-fit parameters are an interstellar column density N{sub H} {approx} 1 x 10{sup 20} cm{sup -2} and an emitting area with R{sup {infinity}} {approx} 17 km (assuming a distance to RX J1856.5-3754 of 140 pc), temperature T{sup {infinity}} {approx} 4.3 x 10{sup 5} K, gravitational redshift z{sub g} {approx} 0.22, atmospheric hydrogen column y{sub H} {approx} 1 g cm{sup -2}, and magnetic field B {approx} (3-4) x 10{sup 12} G; the values for the temperature and magnetic field indicate an effective average over the surface. We also calculate a more realistic model, which accounts for magnetic field and temperature variations over the neutron star surface as well as general relativistic effects, to determine pulsations; we find there exist viewing geometries that produce pulsations near the currently observed limits. The origin of the thin atmospheres required to fit the data is an important question, and we briefly discuss mechanisms for producing these atmospheres. Our model thus represents the most self-consistent picture to date for explaining all the observations of RX J1856.5-3754.\n\nThe TESLA RF System\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nChoroba, S.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nThe TESLA project proposed by the TESLA collaboration in 2001 is a 500 to 800GeV e+/e- linear collider with integrated free electron laser facility. The accelerator is based on superconducting cavity technology. Approximately 20000 superconducting cavities operated at 1.3GHz with a gradient of 23.4MV/m or 35MV/m will be required to achieve the energy of 500GeV or 800GeV respectively. For 500GeV â¼600 RF stations each generating 10MW of RF power at 1.3GHz at a pulse duration of 1.37ms and a repetition rate of 5 or 10Hz are required. The original TESLA design was modified in 2002 and now includes a dedicated 20GeV electron accelerator in a separate tunnel for free electron laser application. The TESLA XFEL will provide XFEL radiation of unprecedented peak brilliance and full transverse coherence in the wavelength range of 0.1 to 6.4nm at a pulse duration of 100fs. The technology of both accelerators, the TESLA linear collider and the XFEL, will be identical, however the number of superconducting cavities and RF stations for the XFEL will be reduced to 936 and 26 respectively. This paper describes the layout of the entire RF system of the TESLA linear collider and the TESLA XFEL and gives an overview of its various subsystems and components\n\nLinear Colliders TESLA\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAnon.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThe aim of the TESLA (TeV Superconducting Linear Accelerator) collaboration (at present 19 institutions from seven countries) is to establish the technology for a high energy electron-positron linear collider using superconducting radiofrequency cavities to accelerate its beams. Another basic goal is to demonstrate that such a collider can meet its performance goals in a cost effective manner. For this the TESLA collaboration is preparing a 500 MeV superconducting linear test accelerator at the DESY Laboratory in Hamburg.

Materials and Methods The study was reviewed and approved by the local ethic review board. k-t SENSE perfusion MR was performed at 1.5 Tesla and 3.0 Tesla (saturation recovery gradient echo pulse sequence, repetition time/echo time 3.0ms/1.0ms, flip angle 15Â°, 5x k-t SENSE acceleration, spatial resolution 1.3Ã1.3Ã10mm3). Fourteen volunteers were studied at rest and 37 patients during adenosine stress. In volunteers, comparison was also made with standard-resolution (2.5Ã2.5Ã10mm3) 2x SENSE perfusion MR at 3.0 Tesla. Image quality, artifact scores, signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and contrast-enhancement ratios (CER) were derived. In patients, diagnostic accuracy of visual analysis to detect >50% diameter stenosis on quantitative coronary angiography was determined by receiver-operator-characteristics (ROC). Results In volunteers, image quality and artifact scores were similar for 3.0 Tesla and 1.5 Tesla, while SNR was higher (11.6 vs. 5.6) and CER lower (1.1 vs. 1.5, p=0.012) at 3.0 Tesla. Compared with standard-resolution perfusion MR, image quality was higher for k-t SENSE (3.6 vs. 3.1, p=0.04), endocardial dark rim artifacts were reduced (artifact thickness 1.6mm vs. 2.4mm, pTesla and 1.5 Tesla, respectively. Conclusions k-t SENSE accelerated high-resolution perfusion MR at 3.0 Tesla is feasible with similar artifacts and diagnostic accuracy as at 1.5 Tesla. Compared with standard-resolution perfusion MR, image quality is improved and artifacts are reduced.

The infrastructure necessary to assemble and test superconducting rf cavities has been installed at the TESLA Test Facility (TTF) at DESY. 5-cell, 1.3 GHz cavities have been fabricated and have reached accelerating fields of 25 MV/m. Full sized 9-cell copper cavities of TESLA geometry have been measured to verify the higher order modes present and to evaluate HOM coupling designs. The design of the TESLA 9-cell cavity has been finalized and industry has started delivery. Two prototype 9-cell niobium cavities in their first tests have reached accelerating fields of 10 MV/m and 15 MV/m in a vertical dewar after high peak power (HPP) conditioning. The first 12 m TESLA cryomodule that will house 8 9-cell cavities is scheduled to be delivered in Spring 1995. A design report for the TTF is in progress.

Evidence is argumentatively applied in defence of the thesis that at different stages of the artistic life of the work it comes under three well-grounded distinct painting genres; self-portrait, portrait (single and double and one figure composition (with the âpresenceâ of a latent image. The hypothesis of genre migration is built on the basis of circumstances and facts that âaccompanyâ the work from its creation till becoming part of a donation by the heirs of the author to a gallery in his hometown. An idea is argued that the simultaneous presence of several genres in the painting is unique for Bulgarian art from the early 20th century, which dimensions could only be rationalized when compared with current ideas and practices in art and nowadays views of portraying in particular. An inference is made in the text by proving that the hypothesis also applies to subsequent paradigm shifts with the time regarding portraying.\n\nAnil K Rajvanshi\n\nIndian Academy of Sciences (India)\n\nHome; Journals; Resonance â Journal of Science Education.

Many of these were originally discovered - at least in rudimentary form - by Nikola Tesla. In the West, the suppression of Tesla led to the suppression of these effects. And the knowledge of them went to the grave with Tesla. After World War II, the Soviet Union mounted a massive campaign to obtain all the scientific literature of the West and thoroughly digest it. Great centers were set up, and thousands of PhDs devoted to this purpose. Gradually they synthesized this technology from the errors in EM foundations they uncovered, and from obscure, ignored papers published in the orthodox Western scientific literature. They rediscovered the technology of Tesla, Moray, and Rogers. And they have highly weaponized the effects, and adjusted and aligned the weapons upon us\n\nNew constraints on the star formation history of the star cluster NGC 1856\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nCorrenti, M.; Goudfrooij, P.; Puzia, T.H.; de Mink, S.E.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe use the Wide Field Camera 3 onboard the Hubble Space Telescope to obtain deep, high-resolution photometry of the young (age â¼ 300 Myr) star cluster NGC 1856 in the Large Magellanic Cloud.

Materials and methods: We scanned 19 patients (mean age 53; 16 women) with 20 saccular aneurysms treated with coils only, at 1.5 and 3.0 Tesla according to standard clinical 3D TOF-MRA protocols containing a shorter echo-time but weaker read-out gradient at 3.0 Tesla in addition to intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (IA-DSA). Per modality two neuro-radiologists assessed the occlusion status, measured residual flow, and indicated whether coil artefacts disturbed this assessment on MRA. We assessed relative risks for disturbance by coil artefacts, weighted kappa's for agreement on occlusion levels, and we compared remnant sizes. For artefact measurements, a coil model was created and scanned with the same protocols followed by 2D MR scans with variation of echo-time and read-out gradient strength. Results: Coil artefacts disturbed assessments less frequently at 3.0 Tesla than at 1.5 Tesla (RR: 0.3; 95%CI: 0.1â0.8).

Aune\n\n2000-09-01\n\nFull Text Available The conceptional design of the proposed linear electron-positron collider TESLA is based on 9-cell 1.3 GHz superconducting niobium cavities with an accelerating gradient of E_{acc}â¥25 MV/m at a quality factor Q_{0}â¥5Ã10^{9}. The design goal for the cavities of the TESLA Test Facility (TTF linac was set to the more moderate value of E_{acc}â¥15 MV/m. In a first series of 27 industrially produced TTF cavities the average gradient at Q_{0}=5Ã10^{9} was measured to be 20.1Â±6.2 MV/m, excluding a few cavities suffering from serious fabrication or material defects. In the second production of 24 TTF cavities, additional quality control measures were introduced, in particular, an eddy-current scan to eliminate niobium sheets with foreign material inclusions and stringent prescriptions for carrying out the electron-beam welds. The average gradient of these cavities at Q_{0}=5Ã10^{9} amounts to 25.0Â±3.2 MV/m with the exception of one cavity suffering from a weld defect. Hence only a moderate improvement in production and preparation techniques will be needed to meet the ambitious TESLA goal with an adequate safety margin. In this paper we present a detailed description of the design, fabrication, and preparation of the TESLA Test Facility cavities and their associated components and report on cavity performance in test cryostats and with electron beam in the TTF linac. The ongoing research and development towards higher gradients is briefly addressed.\n\nTESLA: Large Signal Simulation Code for Klystrons\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nVlasov, Alexander N.; Cooke, Simon J.; Chernin, David P.; Antonsen, Thomas M. Jr.; Nguyen, Khanh T.; Levush, Baruch\n\n2003-01-01\n\nTESLA (Telegraphist's Equations Solution for Linear Beam Amplifiers) is a new code designed to simulate linear beam vacuum electronic devices with cavities, such as klystrons, extended interaction klystrons, twistrons, and coupled cavity amplifiers. The model includes a self-consistent, nonlinear solution of the three-dimensional electron equations of motion and the solution of time-dependent field equations. The model differs from the conventional Particle in Cell approach in that the field spectrum is assumed to consist of a carrier frequency and its harmonics with slowly varying envelopes. Also, fields in the external cavities are modeled with circuit like equations and couple to fields in the beam region through boundary conditions on the beam tunnel wall. The model in TESLA is an extension of the model used in gyrotron code MAGY. The TESLA formulation has been extended to be capable to treat the multiple beam case, in which each beam is transported inside its own tunnel. The beams interact with each other as they pass through the gaps in their common cavities. The interaction is treated by modification of the boundary conditions on the wall of each tunnel to include the effect of adjacent beams as well as the fields excited in each cavity. The extended version of TESLA for the multiple beam case, TESLA-MB, has been developed for single processor machines, and can run on UNIX machines and on PC computers with a large memory (above 2GB). The TESLA-MB algorithm is currently being modified to simulate multiple beam klystrons on multiprocessor machines using the MPI (Message Passing Interface) environment. The code TESLA has been verified by comparison with MAGIC for single and multiple beam cases. The TESLA code and the MAGIC code predict the same power within 1% for a simple two cavity klystron design while the computational time for TESLA is orders of magnitude less than for MAGIC 2D. In addition, recently TESLA was used to model the L-6048 klystron, code\n\nJozef Schreier (1909-1943).

Î³-Î³ collisions at the TESLA linear collider will benefit from a further decrease of the horizontal emittance. This paper reviews the processes which limit the horizontal emittance in the damping ring. Preliminary estimates on the smallest horizontal emittance for the present TESLA damping ring design as well as an ultimate limit of the emittance reachable with the TESLA damping ring concept will be given\n\nPSR J1856+0245: Arecibo discovery of a young, energetic pulsar coincident with the TeV Î³-ray source HESS J1857+026\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nHessels, J.W.T.; Nice, D.J.; Gaensler, B.M.; Kaspi, V.M.; Lorimer, D.R.; Champion, D.J.; Lyne, A.G.; Kramer, M.; Cordes, J.M.; Freire, P.C.C.; Camilo, F.; Ransom, S.M.; Deneva, J.S.; Bhat, N.D.R.; Cognard, I.; Crawford, F.; Jenet, F.A.; Kasian, L.; Lazarus, P.; van Leeuwen, J.; McLaughlin, M.A.; Stairs, I.H.; Stappers, B.W.; Venkataraman, A.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nWe present the discovery of the Vela-like radio pulsar J1856+0245 in the Arecibo PALFA survey.

In this report, we consider this option for the TESLA project. Recent study has shown that the horizontal emittance in the TESLA damping ring can be further decreased by a factor of four. In this case, the Î³Î³ luminosity in the high energy part of spectrum can reach about (1/3)L e + e - . Typical cross-sections of interesting processes in Î³Î³ collisions are higher than those in e + e - collisions by about one order of magnitude, so the number of events in Î³Î³ collisions will be more than that in e + e - collisions. Photon colliders can, certainly, give additional information and they are the best for the study of many phenomena. The main question is now the technical feasibility. The key new element in photon colliders is a very powerful laser system. An external optical cavity is a promising approach for the TESLA project. A free electron laser is another option. However, a more straightforward solution is ''an optical storage ring (optical trap)'' with a diode pumped solid state laser injector which is today technically feasible. This paper briefly reviews the status of a photon collider based on the linear collider TESLA, its possible parameters and existing problems\n\n120 YEARS SINCE THE DISCOVERY OF X-RAYS.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBabic, Rade R; Stankovic Babic, Gordana; Babic, Strahinja R; Babic, Nevena R\n\n2016-09-01\n\nThis paper is intended to celebrate the 120th anniversary of the discovery of X-rays. X-rays (Roentgen-rays) were discovered on the 8th ofNovember, 1895 by the German physicist Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen. Fifty days after the discovery of X-ray, on December 28, 1895. Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen published a paper about the discovery of X-rays - \"On a new kind of rays\" (Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen: Ober eine neue Art von Strahlen. In: Sitzungsberichte der Wurzburger Physik.-Medic.- Gesellschaft. 1895.). Therefore, the date of 28th ofDecember, 1895 was taken as the date of X-rays discovery. This paper describes the work of Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen, Nikola Tesla, Mihajlo Pupin and Maria Sklodowska-Curie about the nature of X-rays . The fantastic four - Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen, NikolaTesla, Mihajlo ldvorski Pupin and Maria Sklodowska-Curie set the foundation of radiology with their discovery and study of X-rays. Five years after the discovery of X-rays, in 1900, Dr Avram Vinaver had the first X-ray machine installed in abac, in Serbia at the time when many developed countries did not have an X-ray machine and thus set the foundation of radiology in Serbia.\n\nTesla Roadsterin vauriokorjaus\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nHiltunen, Santeri\n\n2016-01-01\n\nInsinÃ¶Ã¶rityÃ¶ssÃ¤ perehdyttiin Tesla-sÃ¤hkÃ¶auton rakenteeseen sekÃ¤ korjaamiseen, sÃ¤hkÃ¶tyÃ¶-turvallisuuteen sekÃ¤ sÃ¤hkÃ¶tekniikkaan.

Tesla coil is described as a long line with distributed parameters in a single-wire form, where the line voltage is measured across electrically neutral space. By applying the principle of equivalence of single-wire and two-wire schemes an equivalent two-wire scheme can be found for a single-wire scheme and the already known long line theory can be applied to the Tesla coil. A new method of multiple reflections is developed to characterize a signal in a long line. Formulas for calculation of voltage in Tesla coil by coordinate and calculation of resonance frequencies are proposed. The theoretical calculations are verified experimentally. Resonance frequencies of Tesla coil are measured and voltage standing wave characteristics are obtained for different output capacities in the single-wire mode. Wave resistance and phase coefficient of Tesla coil is obtained. Experimental measurements show good compliance with the proposed theory. The formulas obtained in this paper are also usable for a regular two-wire long line with distributed parameters.\n\nBack to the future: SETI before the space age\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDick, Steven J.\n\n1995-02-01\n\nIn the late 1890s and early 1900s, before the advent of formalized search for extr"
