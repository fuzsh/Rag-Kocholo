Compared with thyroid neoplasms in adults, however, those in the pediatric population exhibit differences in pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and long-term outcomes. Furthermore, therapy that may be recommended for an adult may not be appropriate for a child who is at low risk for death but at higher risk for long-term harm from overly aggressive treatment. For these reasons, unique guidelines for children and adolescents with thyroid tumors are needed.\n\nMethods: A task force commissioned by the American Thyroid Association (ATA) developed a series of clinically relevant questions pertaining to the management of children with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Using an extensive literature search, primarily focused on studies that included subjects ≤18 years of age, the task force identified and reviewed relevant articles through April 2014. Recommendations were made based upon scientific evidence and expert opinion and were graded using a modified schema from the United States Preventive Services Task Force.\n\nResults: These inaugural guidelines provide recommendations for the evaluation and management of thyroid nodules in children and adolescents, including the role and interpretation of ultrasound, fine-needle aspiration cytology, and the management of benign nodules. Recommendations for the evaluation, treatment, and follow-up of children and adolescents with DTC are outlined and include preoperative staging, surgical management, postoperative staging, the role of radioactive iodine therapy, and goals for thyrotropin suppression. Management algorithms are proposed and separate recommendations for papillary and follicular thyroid cancers are provided.\n\nConclusions: In response to our charge as an independent task force appointed by the ATA, we developed recommendations based on scientific evidence and expert opinion for the management of thyroid nodules and DTC in children and adolescents. In our opinion, these represent the current optimal care for children and adolescents with these conditions.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn order to promote best practice standards for the diagnosis and management of thyroid cancers, The American Thyroid Association (ATA) (1), the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (2), the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) (3), and the British Thyroid Association/Royal College of Physicians (4), previously published guidelines specifically addressing the evaluation, treatment and follow-up of thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) in adults. In most cases, the evaluation, treatment and follow-up of children with thyroid neoplasia have followed adult guidelines. Heretofore, this approach resulted in a high proportion of cure, but required all children to undergo therapy that included total thyroidectomy followed by radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation with iodine-131 (131I). The goal was to eliminate any evidence of disease, documented by a negative whole-body RAI scan and, most recently, by an undetectable serum thyroglobulin (Tg) level. Unfortunately, recent studies with follow-up spanning several decades reveal an increase in all-cause mortality for survivors of childhood DTC, predominately due to second malignancies in children treated with radiation (5–7). These observations, coupled with a better understanding of the excellent prognosis associated with pediatric DTC (5,8–15), have now prompted the ATA to specifically address treatment of children with benign and malignant thyroid tumors.\n\nThis inaugural pediatric task force acknowledges that no randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial exists for the treatment of children with DTC. Published data are from retrospective cohorts and are potentially subject to investigator bias or nonrandom assignment to various treatment groups. Further limiting the development of treatment guidelines is the fact that previous series of DTC in children averaged only 10 years of follow-up. This constraint has made it difficult to determine if any treatment results in decreased risk of recurrence, mortality, or complications of therapy for children. Nevertheless, retrospective analysis of therapeutic options has led to a reconsideration of the former concept that all children with DTC should be similarly treated and has provided the opportunity for this task force to broaden the scope of acceptable therapy in an attempt to provide aggressive therapy when warranted and to limit overtreatment of those children who are unlikely to benefit.\n\nBackground\n\nAccording to the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program, new cases of thyroid cancer in people age <20 represent 1.8% of all thyroid malignancies diagnosed in the United States (16). Unfortunately, the incidence appears to be increasing (17). Among 15- to 19-year-old adolescents, thyroid cancer is the eighth most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second most common cancer among girls (8,18). Adolescents have a 10-fold greater incidence than younger children, and there is a female to male preponderance (5:1) during adolescence that is not seen in young children (8,18–21). The most common presentation for DTC in children is that of a thyroid nodule. However, papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) also frequently presents as cervical adenopathy with or without a palpable thyroid lesion, or as an incidental finding after imaging or surgery for an unrelated condition (11). Occasionally, the diagnosis is made only after the discovery of distant metastases (22–24).\n\nThe pathological classification of DTCs in children is based on standard definitions set by the World Health Organization (WHO), with histological criteria the same for children and adults (25). PTC accounts for 90% or more of all childhood cases (10,12,20,26–28). Follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) is uncommon, while medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), poorly differentiated tumors, and frankly undifferentiated (anaplastic) thyroid carcinomas are rare in young patients. Pediatric PTC may present with a variety of histological variants all having a distinctive but shared set of nuclear characteristics.\n\nSubtypes of PTC in pediatrics include the following histologic variants: classic, solid, follicular, and diffuse sclerosing (25,29). Children, especially those <10 years of age, may not have the classic papillary morphology seen in adults, and such tumors can be un-encapsulated and widely invasive throughout the gland and have a follicular and solid architecture with unique nuclear features and abundant psammoma bodies (30,31). The major risk factor for developing PTC is radiation exposure to the thyroid (32–34). Children, especially those <5 years of age, are the most sensitive (33,35,36). Radiation-induced PTC does not appear to differ in clinical behavior compared with sporadic PTC (37). Activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway is critical for thyroid malignancies (38–40). An estimated 5% of patients with nonmedullary thyroid cancer (NMTC) have a family history of nonsyndromic NMTC (35,41) with conflicting evidence in regard to whether it behaves more aggressively (42).\n\nPTC and FTC exhibit major clinical differences. PTC is frequently multifocal and bilateral and metastasizes to regional neck lymph nodes in the vast majority of children (10,12,13,15,23,24,31,43–47). Hematogenous metastases to the lungs occur in up to 25% of cases (9,11,14,24,31,43,48–52) and generally occur only with significant regional lymph node metastases (10,53). FTC is typically a unifocal tumor and more prone to initial hematogenous metastases to lungs and bones. Metastases to regional lymph nodes are uncommon in FTC. Histologic variants of FTC include: Hürthle cell (oncocytic), clear cell, and insular (poorly differentiated) carcinoma (25).\n\nBased on the rarity of FTC in children and the major clinical and biological differences between PTC and FTC in children, the current guidelines have been developed specifically for PTC in children, and we have chosen to include a separate section dedicated to the treatment of FTC.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe ATA selected a task force using a strategy similar to that of previous ATA Guidelines task forces. Members were approved by the ATA and represent an international community of experts from a variety of disciplines including endocrinology, molecular biology, nuclear medicine, radiology, and surgery. None of the scientific or medical content of the manuscript was dictated by the ATA. The task force met by conference calls and in person and developed a series of clinically relevant questions pertaining to the management of children with thyroid nodules and DTC. Task force members were assigned to subcommittees structured along the lines of these clinical questions and attempted to answer them using an extensive literature search, primarily focused on studies that included subjects ≤18 years of age, in addition to expert opinion. Similar to other ATA guidelines, the strength of the recommendations was categorized using a modified schema proposed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (54) (see ). With contributions from all authors, the document was primarily written by the chair and cochairs (GLF, AJB, and SGW). The Pediatric Endocrine Society (PES) codeveloped and endorsed the guidelines. The final document was approved by the ATA (Board of Directors and membership) and the PES (Drug and Therapeutics Committee and Board of Directors).\n\nTable 1.\n\nRatingDefinitionA: Strongly recommendsThe recommendation is based on good evidence that the service or intervention can improve important health outcomes.

Health Organization\n\n[A1] Why do we need Specific Guidelines for Children with Thyroid Nodules and Thyroid Cancer?\n\nThere are important clinical, molecular, and pathological differences in DTC among children compared to adults that prompt the development of unique pediatric guidelines. From a clinical perspective, thyroid nodules are uncommon in children. However, nodules diagnosed in children carry a greater risk of malignancy compared to those in adults (22%–26% versus 5%–10% in most series) (27,55,56). Second, when histology and tumor size are controlled for, children with PTC are more likely to have regional lymph node involvement, extrathyroidal extension, and pulmonary metastasis (9–15,23,24,31,43–53). Third, despite extensive disease at clinical presentation, children are much less likely to die from disease (2% or less long-term cause-specific mortality) than are adults (5,8–15), and many children with pulmonary metastases (30%–45%) develop persistent albeit stable disease following 131I therapy (24,57). This is associated with a more favorable progression-free survival in children compared to adults with persistent DTC (9,10,13,14,47,48,51,52). Finally, there may be a continued clinical response demonstrated by a decline in Tg levels after cessation of RAI therapy in children with pulmonary metastases (58).\n\nCompared with adult PTC, childhood PTC is characterized by a higher prevalence of gene rearrangements and a lower frequency of point mutations in the proto-oncogenes implicated in PTC. Recent molecular studies have shown that BRAF mutations are the most common abnormality in adult PTC (36%–83% of cases) (38), but they are rare in children with PTC (59) and virtually absent from the youngest patients. This may be important because point mutations of RAS and BRAF lead to genomic instability and dedifferentiation manifested by decreased expression of the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) (60,61). In contrast, RET/PTC rearrangements are more common in PTC from children (20,26,40,62) and do not lead to genomic instability. These molecular differences might be one of the reasons for better response to RAI therapy in children with PTC and could partially explain their low mortality and rare progression to less-differentiated tumors. Consistent with this hypothesis, a small study of PTC from children and adolescents found distant metastases and recurrence only in tumors with undetectable NIS, and the activity of 131I required to achieve remission was greater in those cancers with undetectable NIS (63). Finally, these molecular differences may have an impact on the utility of molecular testing for diagnosis of thyroid malignancies in children with thyroid nodules (see Section B5).\n\n[A2] To what age group should these Guidelines apply?\n\nStudies of pediatric DTC have variously included individuals extending up to 21 years of age (5,8–10,13,14,47,48,51,52). With uncommon exception, the majority of pediatric patients have completed growth and development by ≤18 years of age. To more accurately define the impact of the physiologic changes of growth and development on tumor behavior, the upper limit for pediatrics should be defined as patients ≤18 years of age.\n\n■ RECOMMENDATION 1\n\nThe pediatric age should be limited to a patient ≤18 years of age. Establishing a uniform upper limit of age will afford an opportunity to better define the potential impact of growth on tumor behavior. From a pragmatic point of view, individual centers may transition pediatric patients to adult care anywhere between 18 and 21 years of age. Clinicians may manage the “child” under these guidelines until transition has been completed.\n\nRecommendation rating: C\n\n[A3] Should treatment of Children with DTC be stratified into more than one Age Group?\n\nSeveral studies have compared the clinical presentation and outcomes for children diagnosed with DTC <10–15 years of age with that of patients 10–18 years of age. The data are unclear as to whether younger age portends greater risk for extensive disease or recurrence. All studies are retrospective and most include only small numbers of children <10–15 years of age. In general, studies in which 25%–30% of the cohort are of younger age have shown that young age is associated with persistent disease or recurrence, whereas studies with fewer young children have not confirmed this (10,14,50,53,64–66). In addition, treatment regimens varied, which may impact outcomes. For example, surgeons may be less aggressive in lymph node dissection in younger children, and this factor, rather than age, may impact recurrence rates.\n\nIn some series, extrathyroidal extension (ETE) (50,66), regional node involvement (50,67), distant metastases (64,67), and lymph node recurrence (10,65,66) have an increased prevalence in younger children, but this is not seen in all series (14,44,50,53). The largest study included 740 children from Belarus (10), 92% of whom had exposure to radionuclides at the time of the Chernobyl disaster. By multivariate regression analysis, younger age was associated with an increased risk of recurrent nodal disease and lung metastases after adjustment for other risk factors. Unfortunately, several features of that study preclude generalization of the data. The Belarus cohort was exposed to radiation, and the relationship between age and outcome might be explained by the heightened sensitivity to radiation in younger children rather than age per se (68).\n\n■ RECOMMENDATION 2\n\nIt remains unclear if younger children (<10–15 years of age) are at greater risk for more extensive disease or higher rates of recurrence. Other factors aside from age (treatment approaches, genetic susceptibility, and/or radiation exposure) may interact to modify this risk. However, those studies with a larger proportion of young children show an increased risk of persistent disease/recurrence. In an effort to increase the descriptive nature of these discussions, the committee recommends that “prepubertal” and “pubertal/postpubertal” should be incorporated into future studies to increase uniformity and more accurately represent the potential influence of pubertal development on the incidence and behavior of DTC within the pediatric population.\n\nRecommendation rating: B\n\n[A4] What are the Goals of Therapy for DTC in Children?\n\nGiven the fact that disease-specific mortality for children with DTC is very low, it is unlikely that modification of current treatment protocols will further reduce the disease-specific mortality. However, the apparent increased risk of second malignancies and overall mortality among childhood DTC survivors who were treated with radiation (see Section C16) underscores the need to better risk-stratify children with DTC so that more aggressive therapy is reserved for those at highest risk for morbidity and mortality and avoided in those children who are unlikely to derive long-term benefit. The goals for improved treatment are to\n\n1. Maintain the low disease-specific mortality currently experienced by children with DTC.\n\n2. Reduce potential complications from therapy.\n\nA major task in this process is to prospectively identify the minority of children who will benefit from aggressive therapy and to better understand the clinical characteristics that predict a response to such therapies. It is possible that in this search to develop “lower-intensity” therapy, we might increase the risk for residual/recurrent disease and the numbers of patients surviving with low-volume, persistent but progression-free disease. Two major differences in these guidelines compared with previous treatment guidelines are recommendations directed toward:\n\n1. Pre- and postoperative staging\n\n2. Selective use of 131I in children with DTC\n\nThe 2009 ATA thyroid cancer guidelines for adult patients recommend that staging should be performed for all patients with DTC using the Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) (69). In this system, children are classified as either stage I (no distant metastases) or stage II disease (with distant metastases). However, stage I includes a widely diverse group of children: those with a solitary lesion confined to the thyroid, those with extensive locoregional disease and neck nodal metastases, and those with microscopic PTC. Treatment and prognosis for these varied lesions should ideally be stratified to represent the risks of persistent/recurrent disease, and that will require an additional risk-stratification scheme beyond TNM classification.\n\nStudies have confirmed the notion that children with DTC have lower rates of complications when surgery is performed by experienced thyroid surgeons (70–72). For this reason, the current task force recommends that children with DTC should be operated upon by experienced thyroid surgeons. Furthermore, it is our opinion that children with DTC should be cared for by teams of physicians experienced in the management of DTC in children to include, not only high-volume thyroid surgeons, but also experts in nuclear medicine and endocrinology who have experience in managing children with DTC. Evaluation and care should be provided in centers with a full range of pediatric and oncologic resources, which should be organized into a multidisciplinary team that regularly conducts patient review and/or tumor board conferences. This will facilitate interdisciplinary decisions regarding optimal therapy and will help to reduce the possibility that treatment and long-term follow-up will be either overly aggressive or inadequate.\n\n■ RECOMMENDATION 3\n\nChildren with DTC should be cared for by teams of physicians experienced in the management of DTC in children. This will facilitate interdisciplinary decisions regarding optimal therapy and will help to reduce the possibility that treatment and long-term follow-up will be either overly aggressive or inadequate.\n\nRecommendation rating: C\n\n[B1] Thyroid Nodule Guidelines\n\n[B2] How Common are Thyroid Nodules in Children and What is the Risk for Malignancy?\n\nThyroid nodules are less common among children than adults but are more likely to be malignant in children referred for evaluation of nodular thyroid disease (22%–26% versus approximately 5%) (27,55,56). Estimates from ultrasound (US) and postmortem examination suggest that 1%–1.5% of children and up to 13% of older adolescents or young adults have thyroid nodules (73,74), although it is unclear how many of these would have become clinically apparent. Recent data from a large Japanese series using high-resolution US confirm the incidence of solid nodules at 1.65% but also identified cystic lesions in 57% of children and adolescents (75). Such high-resolution US data have not yet been replicated in other pediatric populations, and it remains unclear if thyroid nodules are this prevalent in other regions. Nevertheless, it appears from multiple studies that the prevalence of thyroid nodules is much greater in children than is generally appreciated. It also remains unclear how many of these nodules would reach a clinical threshold during childhood.\n\n[B3] Are there High-Risk Groups Who Might Benefit from Prospective Screening for Thyroid Nodules and Thyroid Cancer?\n\nSeveral risk factors are associated with the development of thyroid nodules in children, including iodine deficiency, prior radiation exposure, a history of antecedent thyroid disease, and several genetic syndromes ( ). One high-risk population is that of childhood cancer survivors who were treated for their primary malignancy with radiation therapy, especially survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, and central nervous system tumors (76,77). Thyroid nodules, many of which can only be detected by US, develop in cancer survivors at a rate of about 2% annually and reach a peak incidence 15–25 years after exposure (78–80). In general the risk is greatest among those who received radiation therapy at a younger age and with doses up to 20–29 Gy (77,81,82). High resolution US may identify small subclinical thyroid tumors (83,84). However, insufficient data exist to determine if early detection of nonpalpable tumors will significantly improve the quality and or longevity of life in patients screened by a standardized protocol using US and fine-needle aspiration (FNA). Furthermore, routine US screening may also identify incidental findings, such as ectopic thymus, that may confuse the clinical picture and potentially lead to unnecessary testing (75).\n\nTable 4.\n\nHereditary syndromeaGene (chromosomal location)Type of thyroid neoplasiaAPC-associated polyposis (familial adenomatous polyposis [FAP], attenuated FAP, Gardner syndrome, and Turcot syndrome)• APC (5q21-q22)• PTC (cribriform-morular variant)Carney complex• PRKAR1A (17q24.2)\n\n• “CNC2” (2p16)• Multinodular goiter\n\n• Follicular adenomas\n\n• DTC (PTC and FTC)DICER1 Syndrome• DICER1 (14q32.13)• Multinodular goiter\n\n• DTC (due to second somatic mutation in DICER1, possibly related to treatment of pleuropulmonary blastoma)PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (Cowden syndrome, Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, PTEN-related Proteus syndrome, and Proteus-like syndrome)• PTEN (10q23)• Multinodular goiter\n\n• Follicular adenomas\n\n• DTC (FTC overrepresented)Werner syndrome• WRN (8p12)• DTC (PTC and FTC)\n\nA variety of genetic disorders predispose to thyroid neoplasia (85,86) ( ). Benign and malignant thyroid tumors can occur in patients with APC-associated polyposis (87), the Carney complex (88), the DICER1 syndrome (89,90), the PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (91–93), and Werner syndrome (94). Cases of DTC have also been reported in Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome (95), the familial paraganglioma syndromes (96), Li–Fraumeni Syndrome (97), McCune–Albright syndrome (98), and Peutz–Jeghers syndrome (99).\n\nFurthermore, children from kindreds with familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer (FNMTC) may have a predisposition to tumor development (100–105). No clear recommendations exist for prospective screening (outside of routine physical examination) in most cases. However, updated recommendations for US screening have been put forth for both the PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome and APC-associated polyposis (91,92,106). In addition, in nonsyndromic FNMTC, US surveillance of family members has been shown to detect earlier stages of disease as reflected by smaller tumor size (0.8 vs. 2.85 cm; p<0.001), a lower incidence of lymph node metastasis (23.2% vs. 65.6%; p<0.001) as well as a lower incidence of ETE (20.9% vs. 56.2%; p=0.002) compared to the proband (107).\n\nLimited data exist on children with autoimmune thyroiditis. However, one report shows an increased prevalence of thyroid nodules perhaps as high as 30% with 7 of 11 PTC only detected by US examination (108). It is unclear how many of these would have achieved clinical importance, however. The presence of a palpable thyroid nodule or asymmetry with or without palpable cervical lymphadenopathy warrants referral to an experienced thyroid ultrasonographer and consideration of FNA as indicated based on suspicious sonographic features (see Section B4) or growth over time. There are increasing data to suggest that patients with a nodule and thyrotropin (TSH) levels in the upper tertiles of the reference range may be at increased risk for malignancy (109).\n\nFrom these data we conclude that thyroid nodules are common in childhood cancer survivors who received radiation therapy, and they are associated with a modest risk of malignancy. Other groups of children with tumor syndromes, as well as those born into a kindred with FNMTC, have an increased risk for thyroid nodules and/or cancers. Some of these cancers are small and not likely to be detected without US. Although this task force could not recommend thyroid US as a routine screening tool in all of these patients, we do encounter children who have incidental nodules identified via screening thyroid US. Similar to palpable nodules, nodules detected in this setting should be interrogated by US performed by an experienced ultrasonographer, and FNA should be performed if the nodule has concerning sonographic features or growth over time.\n\n■ RECOMMENDATION 4(A)\n\nAn annual physical examination is recommended in children at high risk for thyroid neoplasia. Additional imaging should be pursued if palpable nodules, thyroid asymmetry, and/or abnormal cervical lymphadenopathy are found on examination.\n\nRecommendation rating: B\n\n■ RECOMMENDATION 4(B)\n\nIn children with a history of radiation exposure to the thyroid, the data show that US can detect small thyroid nodules, but the panel is not yet convinced that detection of subclinical disease by US prior to a palpable abnormality on physical examination impacts long-term outcomes. Therefore, routine screening US in high-risk children can neither be recommended for nor against until more data become available.\n\nRecommendation rating: I\n\n■ RECOMMENDATION 4(C)\n\nPatients at increased risk of developing familial DTC should be referred to centers of excellence so that appropriate evaluation, follow-up, genetic counseling, and/or treatment can be undertaken without subjecting patients and families to unwarranted and aggressive therapy.\n\nRecommendation rating: C\n\n■ RECOMMENDATION 4(D)\n\nFor patients with autoimmune thyroiditis, evaluation by an experienced thyroid ultrasonographer should be pursued in any patient with a suspicious thyroid examination (suspected nodule or significant gland asymmetry), especially if associated with palpable cervical lymphadenopathy.\n\nRecommendation rating: B\n\n[B4] What is the Optimal Evaluation of Children with Thyroid Nodules?\n\nThe 2009 ATA adult guidelines indicate that the evaluation and treatment of thyroid nodules in children should be the same as in adults (Recommendation 18). In general, this task force agrees with that sentiment, but there are specific areas in which we feel the approach should differ ( ).\n\nThe 2009 adult guidelines indicate that FNA is not warranted for the evaluation of a nodule <1 cm in size unless the patient is considered high-risk, most commonly with a history of exposure to ionizing radiation, or the nodule is associated with pathologic regional lymph nodes. A size criterion is more problematic in children because thyroid volume changes with age and the size of the nodule alone does not predict malignant histology (110–112). Therefore, US characteristics and clinical context should be used more preferentially to identify nodules that warrant FNA. US features such as hypoechogenicity, irregular margins, and increased intranodular blood flow are more common in malignant lesions (110,113). In addition, the presence of microcalcifications and abnormal cervical lymph nodes increase the likelihood of malignancy (110,113). In all children with a suspicious nodule, US evaluation of the cervical lymph nodes should be performed.\n\nThe 2009 adult guidelines indicate that FNA is not warranted for the evaluation of a hyperfunctioning nodule in the adult. Although we concur that preoperative FNA of a hyperfunctioning nodule in a child is similarly not warranted, this is based on the understanding that all hyperfunctioning nodules in children will be surgically removed (see Section B10).\n\nThe 2009 adult guidelines indicate that calcitonin screening for MTC in adults with thyroid nodules may be cost effective, but it was neither recommended for nor against. In children and adolescents, the prevalence of sporadic MTC is extremely low. In addition, calcitonin reference ranges in children have not yet been widely validated, especially in children who have background thyroid disease such as thyroiditis. Further studies are needed to determine the cost-effectiveness of adding calcitonin to the evaluation of thyroid nodules in children.\n\nThe 2009 adult guidelines indicate that US-guided FNA is preferred for lesions with a higher likelihood of nondiagnostic cytology or sampling error. The sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of FNA in children are similar to that of adults (114–119). However, based on the higher proportion of malignant nodules in children and the potential difficulty in obtaining repeat samples from children, this task force recommends that all FNA in children should be performed with US guidance. This is particularly relevant for complex cystic lesions, which require FNA of the solid portion, and it may also reduce the need for repeat FNA. The latter is important since FNA may alter the ultrasonographic features of thyroid nodules (120), thus making short-term follow-up more difficult.\n\nA unique but very important difference in children is that PTC may present as diffusely infiltrating disease that results in diffuse enlargement of a lobe or the entire gland. For this reason, diffuse thyroid enlargement, especially if associated with palpable cervical lymph nodes, should prompt imaging. With rare exception, the diffuse infiltrating form of PTC is associated with microcalcifications that warrant FNA.\n\nFinally, for both children and adults, cytopathology findings on FNA are categorized according to The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (121). In this six-tier system, FNA results are reported as (a) nondiagnostic or unsatisfactory, (b) benign, (c) atypia or follicular lesion of undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS), (d) follicular/Hürthle neoplasm or suspicious for follicular/Hürthle neoplasm, (e) suggestive of malignancy, or (f) malignant. Insufficient or nondiagnostic cytopathology refers to a specimen with limited cellularity (fewer than six follicular cell groups each containing 10–15 cells per group from at least two separate aspirates), absence of follicular cells or poor fixation and preservation (122). There is a 1%–4% risk of malignancy in insufficient samples from adults (121), but very few data in children. Repeat FNA is an option in children but should be delayed for a minimum of 3 months in order to decrease the potential for atypical cellular features that may arise during the reparative process (123). In adults, the risk of malignancy in indeterminate nodules ranges from ∼5% to 15% in the AUS/FLUS category to 15%–30% in the follicular neoplasm or suggestive of neoplasm group (122). The limited data available suggest these indeterminate FNA categories account for ∼35% of pediatric FNA and that, in children, 28% of AUS/FLUS lesions and 58% of suggestive of follicular or Hürthle cell neoplasm are malignant (26,124). The 2009 adult guidelines suggested that repeat FNA was an option for adults with indeterminate cytopathology. However, due to the apparent increased probability of malignancy among these indeterminate categories in children, the task force recommends definitive surgery (lobectomy plus isthmusectomy) for indeterminate FNA findings in children (see ).\n\n■ RECOMMENDATION 5\n\nThe evaluation and treatment of thyroid nodules in children ( ) should be the same as in adults with the exceptions that (a) US characteristics and clinical context should be used rather than size alone to identify nodules that warrant FNA, (b) all FNA in children should be performed under US guidance, (c) preoperative FNA of a hyperfunctioning nodule in a child is not warranted as long as the lesion is removed, (d) a diffusely infiltrative form of PTC may occur in children and should be considered in a clinically suspicious gland, and (e) surgery (lobectomy plus isthmusectomy) is favored over repeat FNA for most nodules with indeterminate cytology.\n\nRecommendation rating: B\n\n[B5] Are There Molecular Signatures That Complement FNA and Improve the Diagnostic Utility of FNA in Children?\n\nStudies in adults have shown that molecular testing aids in the management of thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytopathology (125–130). However, these diagnostic approaches have not yet been validated in pediatric patients. Mutational analysis has been used to examine thyroid nodules in children in limited single institution studies (26,131). Approximately 17% of pediatric FNAs may be positive for a mutation or rearrangement, the presence of which correlated with malignancy in 100% (26). However, the cytopathologic classification for these malignant tumors were AUS/FLUS, suggestive of follicular or Hürthle neoplasm, suggestive of malignancy, or malignant, all of which would have led to surgical removal regardless of the mutational analysis. Although a proprietary multigene expression classifier has been validated to corroborate a benign diagnosis in adults with indeterminate nodules (126), there are no studies determining its usefulness in the evaluation of the indeterminate pediatric thyroid nodule. Therefore, although current molecular diagnostics might improve the diagnostic acumen for indeterminate cytopathology in children, additional studies are required before a formal recommendation can be proffered.\n\n■ RECOMMENDATION 6\n\nA positive mutational test appears highly likely to be associated with malignancy. Conversely, insufficient data exist in children to rely on negative genetic studies to reliably exclude malignancy. Although molecular studies hold promise for complementing the results of FNA, particularly for nodules that yield indeterminate cytology, they have not yet been sufficiently validated in children and cannot be routinely recommended in routine clinical practice until further studies are conducted.\n\nRecommendation rating: E\n\n[B6] How Should Thyroid Nodules Be Treated in Children?\n\nThe surgical approach to the child with a thyroid nodule is dictated by the FNA results (see ). Every effort should be made to ensure the FNA is performed in a controlled setting designed to accommodate age-appropriate anesthesia and pediatric advanced life support monitoring and intervention. In an effort to provide clarity, the proposed classification scheme from the National Cancer Institute Thyroid FNA State of Science conference is used as a guide to stratify surgical intervention (122).\n\n[B7] What Is the Recommended Approach for Children with Benign Thyroid Cytopathology?\n\nA key element in this question is whether or not “benign” lesions in children as defined by absence of suspicious US findings and benign FNA are ever subsequently found to be malignant. There are insufficient data to answer this question in children, but there are studies that have included both children and adults (132–134). The false-negative rate appears to be quite low, in the range of 3%–5% (114); however, the false negative rate may be higher in larger lesions secondary to an increased risk of sampling error (27,135–137).\n\n[B8] Is There a Role for Levothyroxine Suppression Therapy?\n\nThe literature in this area is conflicting. Not all studies have used the same methodology nor have they always separated spontaneous thyroid nodules from radiation-induced thyroid nodules. Furthermore, some but not all benign thyroid nodules regress spontaneously, and this might be more common in small cystic lesions (138,139). Levothyroxine (LT4) suppression therapy has been evaluated for its efficacy to reduce nodule size or to reduce the risk of subsequent nodule formation. However, there are only minimal data regarding long-term safety and potential side-effects of LT4 therapy (140,141).\n\nLT4 therapy has been prescribed to reduce the size of benign thyroid nodules, but the clinical benefit of a small to modest reduction in size is not clear (142–147). About a third (30.6%) of euthyroid children had a ≥50% reduction in nodule size, which was directly correlated with TSH levels (r=0.640, p<0.001) and inversely with LT4 dose (r=−0.389, p=0.009) (140).\n\nThyroid hormone has also been used in pediatric patients with radiation-induced thyroid nodules in which the formation of subsequent nodules has been shown to be reduced (148,149). It is not clear if this data can be extrapolated to pediatric patients with spontaneous nodules, and LT4 therapy had no effect on the incidence of thyroid cancer (148).\n\nWhether LT4 therapy is used or not, an increase in nodule size is more commonly associated with malignant disease and should prompt re-evaluation and/or surgical resection (see Section B9). Alternatives to surgery have been evaluated in adults, but they have not yet been evaluated in children and their use cannot be recommended.\n\n■ RECOMMENDATION 7\n\nWe are unable to recommend for or against the routine use of LT4 therapy for children with benign thyroid nodules. In general, the data support the efficacy of LT4 therapy to reduce the size and risk of subsequent nodule formation, but there are no data to weigh this potential benefit against the potential risks of long-term suppression therapy. In patients with compressive symptoms or a history of radiation exposure the benefits of LT4 therapy may be more apparent.\n\nRecommendation rating: I\n\n[B9] Is There a Role for Surgery in Children with Benign Nodules?\n\nFor the subset of children who have benign cytopathology, surgery may be considered due to increasing size, compressive symptoms, cosmetic reasons, or patient/parent choice. For growing nodules (defined in adults as a ≥50% increase in volume or ≥20% increase in at least two dimensions) or nodules that have developed suspicious US characteristics, repeat FNA should be performed prior to surgery to assist with surgical planning and preoperative staging. FNA of nodules >4 cm appears to have decreased sensitivity for the diagnosis of malignancy (27,135–137). Given the high false-negative rate of FNA in large lesions, and also to simplify long-term follow-up, surgery should be considered for FNA-documented benign nodules >4 cm, especially if they are solid. If surgery is undertaken, lobectomy is preferred to minimize the risk for complications.\n\n■ RECOMMENDATION 8\n\nBenign lesions should be followed by serial US (see ) and undergo repeat FNA if suspicious features develop or the lesion continues to grow. Lobectomy may be performed in patients with compressive symptoms and cosmetic concerns or according to patient/parent preference and should be considered in all apparently benign solid thyroid nodules >4 cm, those lesions demonstrating significant growth, or in the presence of other clinical concerns for malignancy.\n\nRecommendation rating: B\n\n[B10] What Is the Optimal Management of the Child with an Autonomous Thyroid Nodule?\n\nPediatric patients are occasionally found to have an autonomously functioning nodule (toxic adenoma) diagnosed by a suppressed TSH and increased, nodule-specific uptake on nuclear medicine radioisotope scan (99mTc pertechnetate or iodine-123 [123I]) (150,151). These lesions are most frequently associated with somatic activating mutations within the genes encoding the TSH receptor or the Gs-alpha subunit (151). On examination, children are either euthyroid or may have mild signs or symptoms of hyperthyroidism.\n\nIn adults, the treatment options for autonomous nodules include 131I ablation, surgical resection, or ethanol injection. Because of concerns of the mutagenic effect of low-activity radioiodine on the normal thyroid tissue, and reports that up to one third of patients may be found to have an incidentally discovered DTC associated with autonomous nodules (150), surgical resection is the usual recommendation for most pediatric patients because the safety of observation or alternative treatments is unstudied in children. However, in asymptomatic patients with an autonomous nodule and subclinical hyperthyroidism, surgery may be deferred, but FNA should be considered if the nodule has features suggestive of PTC.\n\n■ RECOMMENDATION 9\n\nFor pediatric patients with a suppressed TSH associated with a thyroid nodule, thyroid scintigraphy should be pursued. Increased uptake within the nodule is consistent with autonomous nodular function. Surgical resection, most commonly lobectomy, is the recommended approach for most autonomous nodules in children and adolescents.\n\nRecommendation rating: A\n\n[C1] Papillary Thyroid Cancer—Initial Management Guidelines\n\n[C2] What Is the Optimal Preoperative Evaluation for the Child with Newly Diagnosed PTC?\n\nThe preoperative evaluation of the newly diagnosed pediatric PTC patient is critical for optimizing surgical outcome and medical therapy. In all cases, a comprehensive neck US using a high-resolution probe (7.5 MHz or higher) and Doppler technique should be obtained by an experienced ultrasonographer. All regions of the neck should be interrogated, recognizing that US has decreased sensitivity to identify malignant lymphadenopathy in the central neck (level VI) (152,153). A complete US examination should be performed prior to surgery if it was not performed with the FNA. The goal is to identify locoregional metastatic disease otherwise not appreciated on physical examination (154–157).\n\nGiven the very high rate of cervical lymph node metastases in children with PTC, the preoperative identification of suspicious lymph nodes affords the surgeon an opportunity to more thoughtfully plan comprehensive, compartment-oriented, lymph node dissection during the initial surgery with the intent to decrease recurrence rates and the need for additional surgery (154,157). In patients with large or fixed thyroid masses or bulky metastatic lymphadenopathy, US may be less sensitive at detecting metastatic disease to deep tissue regions, such as the superior mediastinum (level VII), the retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal, and subclavicular spaces (152,153). The addition of cross-sectional imaging using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), depending on local expertise and preference, should be considered, especially if there is any concern for invasion of the aero-digestive tract (158–161). If iodinated contrast agents are used, further evaluation and treatment with RAI may need to be delayed for 2–3 months until total body iodine burden decreases. The advantage of CT over MRI is that CT has shorter image acquisition times, making scheduling more accessible and reducing the need for conscious sedation in younger patients.\n\nA chest x-ray and/or chest CT may be considered in those with substantial cervical lymph node disease, in whom the prevalence of lung metastases is increased (9,10,24,65,162,163). Pediatric-specific protocols should be used to minimize ionizing radiation exposure. Routine chest CT is not recommended for patients with minimal neck disease because pulmonary metastases are likely to be identified when the child is subsequently staged with a stimulated Tg and diagnostic whole-body scan (DxWBS) (see Section C8) (24,49,164–166).\n\nThyroid nuclear scintigraphy for the evaluation of newly diagnosed PTC should only be pursued if the patient presents with a suppressed TSH. Decreased uptake on thyroid scintigraphy is nonspecific for thyroid malignancy (119). Additionally, the task force does not recommend the routine use of additional imaging (e.g., bone scan or [18F]-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography [18FDG-PET/CT]) in the evaluation of children for PTC. These studies are not validated in this setting and the likelihood of finding disease in an otherwise asymptomatic patient is low and nonspecific (see Section D5).\n\n■ RECOMMENDATION 10\n\nA comprehensive neck US to interrogate all regions of the neck is required in order to optimize the preoperative surgical plan. FNA of suspicious lateral neck lymph nodes is recommended (see Recommendation 13). Anatomic imaging by MRI or CT with contrast should be considered in patients with large or fixed thyroid masses, vocal cord paralysis, or bulky metastatic lymphadenopathy in order to optimize surgical planning.\n\nRecommendation rating: A\n\n[C3] What Is the Recommended Surgical Approach for the Patient with a Diagnosis of PTC?\n\nFor the majority of patients with PTC, total thyroidectomy (TT) is the recommended initial surgical approach. In this procedure, the left and right thyroid lobes, the pyramidal lobe (when present), and the isthmus are resected. Alternatively, in patients with a small unilateral tumor confined to the thyroid gland, a near-TT, whereby a small amount of thyroid tissue (<1%–2%) is left in place at the entry point of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) and/or superior parathyroid glands, might be considered in an effort to decrease the risk of permanent damage to these structures. This recommendation for more comprehensive thyroid surgery in pediatric patients is based on data showing an increased incidence of bilateral and multifocal disease (30% and 65%, respectively) (11,14,47,52,167), as well as an increased risk for recurrence and subsequent second surgical procedures when less than a near-TT or TT is performed (5,14,15,44,47,51,168). In long-term analysis of 215 pediatric patients with PTC, bilateral lobar resection compared with lobectomy was shown to decrease the incidence of local recurrence from 35% to 6% over 40 years of follow-up (5). Bilateral thyroid surgery also optimizes the use of RAI for imaging and/or treatment and Tg as a marker to detect persistent/recurrent disease (8,169–171). Using an intracapsular approach, the superior parathyroid glands may be most easily preserved by maintaining arterial inflow and venous drainage (172–174).\n\n■ RECOMMENDATION 11\n\nFor the majority of children, TT is recommended. The rationale for this approach is based on multiple studies showing an increased incidence of bilateral and multifocal disease. In long-term analysis, bilateral lobar resection compared with lobectomy has been shown to decrease the risk for persistent/recurrent disease.\n\nRecommendation rating: A\n\n[C4] Should Central Neck Dissection Be Performed?\n\nIn patients with preoperative evidence of central and/or lateral neck metastasis, a therapeutic central neck dissection (CND) should be performed. For this subgroup of patients, who are also at increased risk of pulmonary metastases (10,14,65), CND is associated with a decreased risk of persistent/ recurrent locoregional disease as well as the potential to increase the efficacy of 131I treatment for distant metastases (14,15,22,47,48).\n\nThe increased incidence of cervical metastasis in children suggests that prophylactic CND, as defined in the 2009 ATA consensus statement on the terminology and classification of CND for thyroid cancer (175), should be considered at the time of initial surgery for pediatric patients with PTC. This is particularly relevant given that decreased disease-free survival (DFS) is most strongly correlated with the presence of persistent or recurrent locoregional disease (5,13–15,22,47,52).\n\nUnfortunately, there are no data that reliably predict which subgroup of patients is at increased risk for locoregional metastasis. Larger tumor size (>4 cm) has been shown to correlate with an increased risk of lymph node metastases (10,11,176). However, up to 36% of tumors ≤4 cm have cervical lymph node metastasis (10). In addition, several of the panel experts have cared for children with regional metastasis found in children with primary tumors ≤1 cm in size. In adults, these tumors are labeled papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) and scoring systems have been described to predict the likelihood of metastasis (177). However, the thyroid volume is smaller in young children so that the size criteria used for tumor staging (see Section B4), as well as the diagnosis of PTMC, may not apply to children (178).\n\nWhile data suggest that pediatric patients with thyroid cancer typically have 100% 10-year disease-specific survival (5,8,162,179), the extent of initial surgery appears to have the greatest impact on improving long-term DFS (5,47). However, without long-term, prospective data and a reliable set of criteria to stratify which patients would benefit from more aggressive surgical resection, one must weigh the risks of more aggressive surgery with the potential benefit of decreasing the incidence of persistent/recurrent disease.\n\nThe limited data suggest that, in children, TT with prophylactic CND is associated with increased DFS, as high as 95% at 5 and 10 years (46,163). However, the data are mixed and possibly related to the use of adjunctive RAI remnant ablation. In a retrospective study examining 75 children with PTC, 80% of whom underwent TT with 131I remnant ablation, the type and extent of neck dissection did not impact the risk for locoregional or distant metastasis (15). Conversely, another study suggested that TT with prophylactic CND may reduce the risk for reoperation that was as high as 77% in those without CND (44). Some groups suggest routinely considering a prophylactic CND, particularly for larger tumors (1,180,181), whereas others suggest making this decision based upon intraoperative findings (182).\n\nIf and when performed, CND should only be performed by a surgeon highly experienced in the procedure. To reduce the risk of recurrence, a comprehensive and compartment-based lymph node dissection should be pursued rather than “berry picking” (183). In patients with unifocal disease, data from adult patients suggest that ipsilateral, prophylactic CND may provide the same potential benefit while decreasing the higher complication rate associated with bilateral CND (184). During ipsilateral CND, the incorporation of frozen section to stratify which patients should undergo contralateral (complete) prophylactic CND may achieve a balance between the potential risks and benefits of this procedure (185).\n\nWith these considerations in mind, the following recommendations are made in an attempt to balance the goal of achieving surgical remission with the potential increased risk of complications that may be unnecessary for patients with minimal or no locoregional metastasis.\n\n■ RECOMMENDATION 12(A)\n\nCND is recommended for children with malignant cytology and clinical evidence of gross extrathyroidal invasion and/or locoregional metastasis on preoperative staging or intraoperative findings. This approach may be associated with a decreased need for second surgical procedures and increased DFS.\n\nRecommendation rating: B\n\n■ RECOMMENDATION 12(B)\n\nFor patients with PTC and no clinical evidence of gross extrathyroidal invasion and/or locoregional metastasis, prophylactic CND may be selectively considered based upon tumor focality and size and the experience of the surgeon. For patients with unifocal disease, ipsilateral CND, with pursuit of contralateral CND based on intraoperative findings, may help balance the risks and benefits.\n\nRecommendation rating: C\n\n■ RECOMMENDATION 12(C)\n\nCompartment-oriented resection is the recommended approach for lymph node dissection. Berry picking and attempting to use palpation to determine if metastatic disease is present in a lymph node are not recommended.\n\nRecommendation rating: A\n\n■ RECOMMENDATION 12(D)\n\nFuture studies to assess if TT with prophylactic CND dissection will lead to reduced reliance on 131I treatment, re-operative procedures, and improved DFS are recommended.\n\nRecommendation rating: C\n\n[C5] What Are the Indications for Lateral Neck Dissection?\n\nPediatric patients occasionally present with bulky disease to the lateral neck and may have suspicious lymph nodes in the lateral neck on preoperative US imaging. US findings suggestive of metastasis to a lymph node include increased size, rounded shape, loss of central hilum, cystic appearance, peripheral vascularity on Doppler imaging, and microcalcifications (186), with the latter two features having the highest specificity for malignancy (113). The US appearance of the lymph nodes may be considered sufficient evidence to pursue lateral lymph node dissection; however, in patients undergoing surgery, FNA to confirm metastasis to the lateral neck lymph nodes should be performed prior to lateral neck dissection. The addition of a Tg measurement in the FNA washout fluid may be used to confirm equivocal cytological evidence of metastatic disease, even in the presence of serum anti-Tg antibodies (TgAb) (187–191) (see Section D2). When indicated, compartment-oriented lateral neck dissection (levels III, IV, anterior V, and II) is associated with a reduction in persistent/recurrent disease and improved DFS (10,14,47).\n\n■ RECOMMENDATION 13\n\nCytological confirmation of metastatic disease to lymph nodes in the lateral neck is recommended prior to surgery. Routine prophylactic lateral neck dissection (levels III, IV, anterior V, and II) is not recommended. However, lateral neck dissection should be performed on patients with cytologic evidence of metastases to the lateral neck. Measurement of Tg in the FNA washout can be considered if the cytological diagnosis is equivocal.\n\nRecommendation rating: B\n\n[C6] What Are the Possible Complications of Surgery and What Should Be Done to Minimize the Risks of Surgery?\n\nThe lower incidence of thyroid disease requiring surgical intervention in children combined with a higher incidence of locoregional lymph node metastasis has been associated with an increased risk of complications for pediatric patients undergoing TT. Utilizing high-volume thyroid surgeons, defined as a surgeon who performs 30 or more cervical endocrine procedures annually, can reduce the rate of complications (70,71). In a cross-sectional analysis of over 600 pediatric patients undergoing thyroid surgery, there were fewer general complications (8.7% vs. 13.4%) and endocrine complications (5.6% vs. 11%) when the procedures were performed by high-volume surgeons (71). In addition, the duration of stay and cost were significantly lower when the procedure was performed by a high-volume surgeon (71).\n\nThe most common complications after thyroidectomy are endocrine related and include transient or permanent hypoparathyroidism, with an average rate of approximately 5%–15%. In a high-volume tertiary endocrine surgical practice, the risk of permanent hypoparathyroidism is <2.5% (72). Surgery specific, non–endocrine-related complications include RLN damage, spinal accessory nerve injury, and Horner syndrome, with an average rate of 1%–6% (10,13,46,47,70,72). In patients younger than 10 years of age, there is an increased risk of complications associated with the presence of ETE, lymph node dissection, and repeat surgery (10,70,168).\n\nThe risk of hypoparathyroidism correlates with the extent of surgery. Even in patients in whom the parathyroid glands are identified and viability of gland function is likely, manipulation of the parathyroid glands may lead to transient or permanent hypoparathyroidism. Autotransplantation of parathyroid tissue after frozen-section confirmation is utilized if there is any concern of devitalization, and it is associated with a decreased risk of permanent hypoparathyroidism (192,193). Postoperatively, several approaches can predict which patients are at an increased risk of developing hypocalcemia, including serial measurements of serum calcium (194) as well as measurement of a peri-operative intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) level. The utility of postoperative iPTH is fairly well established with a level of <10–15 pg/mL correlating with an increased risk to develop clinically significant hypocalcemia (195,196). An elevated postoperative serum phosphorous may also be predictive (197). The use of peri-operative iPTH and/or phosphorus monitoring may decrease morbidity and allow for stratification of patients who would benefit from more intensive monitoring and treatment with calcium and calcitriol. An alternative to this approach is to place all patients who have undergone TT, especially those who undergo concomitant CND, on empiric calcium with or without calcitriol replacement therapy.\n\nNo monitoring devices have been shown to decrease the rate of non-endocrine surgical complications. The use of intraoperative RLN monitoring may be considered as an adjunct monitoring device and may be considered for younger patients (<10 years of age), in patients undergoing CND, and in patients undergoing repeat surgical procedures. However, the use of RLN monitoring has not been clearly shown to lower the incidence of RLN damage (198).\n\n■ RECOMMENDATION 14(A)\n\nPediatric thyroid surgery should be performed in a hospital with the full spectrum of pediatric specialty care, to include, but not be limited to endocrinology, radiology (US and anatomic imaging), nuclear medicine, anesthesia, a high-volume thyroid surgeon, and intensive care. Pediatric thyroid surgery, especially if compartment-focused lymph node resection is indicated, should ideally be performed by a surgeon who performs at least 30 or more cervical endocrine procedures annually. Thyroid surgery performed under these guidelines is associated with lower complications rates, decreased hospital stay, and lower cost.\n\nRecommendation rating: B\n\n■ RECOMMENDATION 14(B)\n\nThe early incorporation of calcium and calcitriol in patients at high risk for hypocalcemia may decrease the risks of symptomatic hypocalcemia. Postoperative iPTH measurement may be used to help predict which patients would benefit from more intensive monitoring and treatment.\n\nRecommendation rating: B\n\n[C7] What Tumor Classification Systems Can Be Used for Pediatric PTC?\n\nNo single postoperative staging system has been validated in children with PTC, and the utility of extrapolating adult staging systems into the pediatric setting is limited by the observed clinical disparity between the two age groups. Specifically, the age-metastasis-extent of disease-size of tumor (AMES) and metastasis-age-completeness of resection-invasion-size (MACIS) have been examined, but the data are limited and the utility of these staging systems in pediatric patients with PTC remains unclear (176, 199). The AJCC TNM classification system ( ) is the most widely used system for describing the extent of disease and prognosis in the adult population (69). However, due to the extremely low disease-specific mortality in children with PTC and the fact that all patients aged<45 years have either stage I (no distant metastases) or stage II disease (with distant metastases), the TNM classification system remains limited in terms of determining prognosis in children. Despite this, the TNM classification is an excellent system with which to describe the extent of disease as well as to stratify an approach to evaluation and management. Especially useful to risk-stratify the pediatric PTC patient is knowledge regarding lymph node status. Children with PTC who have gross cervical lymph node disease at diagnosis are more likely to have multifocal disease (89% vs. 16%), an increased incidence of pulmonary metastasis (20% versus none), and increased persistent (30% versus none) and/or recurrent (53% versus none) disease compared with children without palpable nodal disease (53,65).\n\nTable 5.\n\nPrimary tumor (T)TXSize not assessed, limited to the thyroidT1T1a≤ 1 cm, limited to the thyroidT1b> 1 cm but ≤ 2 cm, limited to the thyroidT2> 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm, limited to the thyroidT3> 4 cm, limited to the thyroid, or any tumor with minimal extrathyroid extensionT4T4aTumor extends beyond the thyroid capsule to invade subcutaneous soft tissues, larynx, trachea, esophagus, or recurrent laryngeal nerveT4bTumor invades prevertebral fascia or encases carotid artery or mediastinal vesselsLymph nodes (N)NXRegional lymph nodes not assessedN0No regional lymph node metastasisN1N1aMetastasis to level VI (pretracheal, paratracheal, and prelaryngeal/ Delphian lymph nodes)N1bMetastasis to unilateral, bilateral, or contralateral cervical levels I, II, III, IV, or V) or retropharyngeal or superior mediastinal lymph nodes (level VII)Distant metastasis (M)MXDistant metastasis not assessedM0No distant metastasisM1Distant metastasis\n\nTherefore, using the TNM classification system, specifically regional lymph node and distant metastasis staging, one can categorize pediatric patients into one of three risk groups. This categorization strategy does not define the risk of mortality (which is low for both stage I and II patients) but identifies patients at risk of persistent cervical disease and helps to determine which patients should undergo postoperative staging to screen for the presence of distant metastasis ( and Section C8). These three groups are\n\nTable 6.\n\nATA pediatric risk levelaDefinitionInitial postoperative stagingbTSH goalcSurveillance of patients with no evidence of diseasedLowDisease grossly confined to the thyroid with N0/Nx disease or patients with incidental N1a disease (microscopic metastasis to a small number of central neck lymph nodes)Tge0.5–1.0 mIU/LUS at 6 months postoperatively and then annually × 5 years\n\nTge on LT4 every 3–6 months for 2 years and then annuallyIntermediateExtensive N1a or minimal N1b diseaseTSH-stimulated Tge and diagnostic 123I scan in most patients (see )0.1–0.5 mIU/LUS at 6 months postoperatively, every 6–12 months for 5 years, and then less frequently\n\nTge on LT4 every 3–6 months for 3 years and then annually\n\nConsider TSH-stimulated Tge ± diagnostic 123I scan in 1–2 years in patients treated with 131IHighRegionally extensive disease (extensive N1b) or locally invasive disease (T4 tumors), with or without distant metastasisTSH-stimulated Tge and diagnostic 123I scan in all patients (see )<0.1 mIU/LUS at 6 months postoperatively, every 6–12 months for 5 years, and then less frequently\n\nTge on LT4 every 3–6 months for 3 years and then annually\n\nTSH-stimulated Tge ± diagnostic 123I scan in 1–2 years in patients treated with 131I\n\n1.

ATA Pediatric Intermediate-Risk\n\nExtensive N1a or minimal N1b disease. These patients appear to be at low risk for distant metastasis but are at an increased risk for incomplete lymph node resection and persistent cervical disease.\n\nThe impact of the pathologic identification of microscopic (ETE) (T3 disease) on management and outcomes has not been well studied in children with PTC, but patients with minimal ETE are probably either ATA Pediatric Low- or Intermediate-Risk, depending on other clinical factors.\n\n3. ATA Pediatric High-Risk\n\nRegionally extensive disease (extensive N1b) or locally invasive disease (T4 tumors), with or without distant metastasis. Patients in this group are at the highest risk for incomplete resection, persistent disease, and distant metastasis.\n\n■ RECOMMENDATION 15(A)\n\nThe AJCC TNM classification system should be used to describe the extent of disease in pediatric patients with PTC ( ). Children with PTC should be stratified into risk levels (ATA Pediatric Low-, Intermediate-, or High-Risk) based on clinical presentation, tumor size, and evidence of regional invasion and metastasis ( ). The extent of disease in the neck at diagnosis appears to correlate best with the risk for distant metastasis and/or persistent disease that may require additional treatment.\n\nRecommendation rating: B\n\n■ RECOMMENDATION 15(B)\n\nPatients found to have disease confined to the thyroid gland, as well as incidental evidence of minimal, microscopic disease to lymph nodes in the central neck (level VI), fall into the ATA Pediatric Low-Risk level ( ).\n\nThe presence of extensive, extrathyroidal invasion or metastasis defines patients at greater risk for persistent regional or distant metastasis. Patients with these features are categorized within the ATA Pediatric Intermediate- or High-Risk levels ( ). Within these categories, additional postoperative staging is warranted to better define which patients may or may not benefit from additional therapy.\n\nRecommendation rating: B\n\n[C8] What Postoperative Staging Is Recommended?\n\nFor most patients, initial staging ( ) is typically performed within 12 weeks postoperatively. This affords the patient and family time to recover from surgery, while at the same time avoiding delay in additional therapy, if needed. The purpose of postoperative staging is to assess for evidence of persistent locoregional disease and to identify patients who are likely to benefit from additional therapy with 131I, such as those suspected or known to have distant metastases. The individual patient's risk level ( ) helps to determine the extent of postoperative testing. While the committee recognizes that no prospective studies have been performed to validate a stratified risk-based approach in children with PTC, an individualized approach incorporating pathologic findings and postoperative clinical data is founded on well-accepted approaches to therapy in adults (1,3) as well as personal experience in certain pediatric practices (200). The foundation of this stratification system for pediatric patients, however, assumes complete and accurate preoperative staging for regional disease (see Section C2) and appropriate surgery that is performed by a high-volume thyroid cancer surgeon.\n\nFor ATA Pediatric Low-risk patients, initial postoperative staging includes a TSH-suppressed Tg. The interpretation of serum Tg and most importantly, interpretation of the trend in serum Tg over time are summarized in Section D2.\n\nIn contrast, for ATA Pediatric Intermediate- and High-Risk patients, a TSH-stimulated Tg and DxWBS are generally recommended for further risk stratification and determination of treatment with 131I ( ). Children who fall into the ATA Pediatric Intermediate- and High-Risk categories are prepared following standard guidelines for 131I therapy (see Section C12), and the TSH-stimulated Tg and DxWBS data are used to assess for evidence of residual disease ( ). In patients without evidence of TgAb, the TSH-stimulated Tg is a reliable marker for evaluating for the presence or absence of residual disease (see Section D2). In a recent study examining 218 consecutive adult DTC patients across all ATA risk stratification levels, a TSH-stimulated Tg <2 ng/mL had a 94.9% predictive value for the absence of disease (201).\n\nWhether a DxWBS might image disease that is not identified through neck US is a matter of debate and few data in children address this. In one pediatric study, US and DxWBS equally identified lymph node metastases in the majority of patients (35/45); however, in six patients, lymph node metastases were found only with a posttreatment RAI WBS (202). Two of the patients were TgAb positive, reinforcing the potential benefit of DxWBS in patients who are TgAb positive (202,203). DxWBS may also visualize disease in the lungs or mediastinum that would not otherwise be shown by neck US or other cross-sectional imaging (49).\n\nFor patients with cervical iodine uptake, the addition of hybrid imaging using single photon emission computed tomography with integrated conventional CT (SPECT/CT) offers improved anatomic imaging to determine whether cervical uptake is secondary to remnant thyroid tissue or metastasis to regional lymph nodes (204–206).\n\nA potential drawback of DxWBS imaging is that if 131I is used, the small diagnostic activity may theoretically “stun” the iodine-avid tissue and reduce subsequent 131I uptake if high-activity 131I treatment is then used (207,208). This issue can be reduced by selecting the lowest possible activity of 131I (2.7–4.0 mCi=100–148 MBq) (209) or by using 123I (207,210). Due to its lower cost, 131I is more commonly used, but 123I provides superior imaging quality and generates lower absorbed doses of radiation to the tissues (207,211), which favors its use in children.\n\nTaken together, postoperative staging is used to further stratify which children may or may not benefit from additional treatment with surgery and/or RAI therapy. Irrespective of initial risk stratification, all patients will enter surveillance, ensuring that appropriate therapy will be given if evidence of disease is ultimately identified. As long as the patient is maintained on tailored LT4 suppression and a proper surveillance plan is followed ( , ), delayed treatment is not expected to alter the already low disease-specific mortality due to the indolent nature of PTC in children. Furthermore, a more individualized and conservative approach to postoperative staging and treatment will decrease unnecessary exposure to 131I in children without evidence of disease, in whom the risks of routine 131I therapy likely outweigh any benefit. Because of the lack of high-level evidence to help guide these difficult medical decisions, families should be fully informed about the options and their risks/benefits as the surveillance and treatment plans are being formulated.\n\n■ RECOMMENDATION 16\n\nPostoperative staging is usually performed within 12 weeks after surgery ( ) and allows for stratification of patients who may or may not benefit from further therapy, to include additional surgery or 131I therapy. ATA Pediatric Low-Risk patients may be initially assessed and followed with a TSH-suppressed Tg alone. In contrast, a TSH-stimulated Tg and a DxWBS is typically recommended to assess for evidence of persistent disease in ATA Pediatric Intermediate- and High-Risk patients. Additional imaging, to include neck US and/or hybrid imaging using SPECT/CT, may be used conjunctively to more accurately define the anatomic location of RAI uptake noted on a DxWBS. Whenever possible, 123I should be used for the DxWBS.\n\nRecommendation rating: B\n\n[C9] What Are the Goals of 131I Treatment?\n\nThe traditional approach to managing pediatric patients with DTC included reflexive postsurgical 131I therapy, which was prescribed in an effort to eliminate residual thyroid tissue in order to increase the sensitivity for using serum Tg as a biomarker for recurrent disease. In addition, 131I was prescribed in an effort to decrease the risk of recurrent disease (see Section C10).\n\nThe goal of 131I therapy is to decrease the risks of thyroid cancer recurrence and theoretically to improve mortality by eliminating iodine-avid disease. RAI was proposed as a specific treatment for DTC in 1946 after an adult with functional thyroid cancer metastases responded to multiple RAI treatments (212), and 131I therapy has since been broadly incorporated into treatment protocols for both adults and children (1,213). A recent survey indicates that use of therapeutic 131I for all thyroid cancers, regardless of tumor size, has increased from 1990 to 2008 (214).\n\nWith increased awareness of the potential long-term side effects of 131I treatment (see Section C16), there are increased efforts to identify patients who have a high likelihood of benefit from therapy. Unfortunately, the majority of available data are based on a nonstratified approach in which all children underwent TT and variable extent of lymph node dissection, and the majority received therapeutic 131I. The challenge is to reduce or eliminate unnecessary 131I exposure for children who may not benefit without increasing disease-specific morbidity and mortality. The following sections address various aspects of this question.\n\n[C10] What Is the Impact of 131I Therapy on Recurrence and Survival for Children with PTC?\n\nAdjunctive 131I therapy may improve DFS in young adults (including some adolescents) but this has not been universally shown for those with small, stage I lesions (215). Reflective of this, the 2009 ATA guidelines and the current NCCN guidelines support the selective rather than universal administration of 131I, especially for young patients (<45 years of age) with intrathyroidal PTC and either no or limited lymph node disease (1,3).\n\nStudies specifically examining the potential benefits of 131I therapy in children have been difficult to perform because the number of patients is small and the prognosis is favorable, regardless of adjunctive therapy (11,169,216,217). Arguments in favor of universal therapeutic 131I for children have been based on the observation that retention of the normal thyroid remnant may decrease the sensitivity for detecting metastases or recurrent disease by serum Tg and/or DxWBS (218,219). Arguments against the universal prescription of therapeutic 131I are based on the known short- and long-term toxicities (220), lack of data showing conclusive benefit from routine 131I therapy (5,13), a possible increase in the risk of secondary malignancies (5–7,221,222), and studies showing that Tg can remain useful and become undetectable in patients post TT despite not having received 131I (223–225).\n\nMost of the data regarding 131I use in children have examined treatment of known residual disease rather than ablation of the normal thyroid remnant only (9). In patients with known residual disease, 131I therapy appears to decrease recurrence (9,43,51,162,226). However, large retrospective series in children show conflicting results regarding the potential for benefit from adjunctive 131I. In one study, 131I remnant ablation did not clearly decrease the risk for locoregional recurrence, distant metastases, or all-sites recurrence compared with surgery alone, but there was a trend toward reduction in the risk of distant metastases (p=0.06) (5). Unfortunately, overall survival was reduced in patients who had received external beam therapy, radium implants, or 131I, primarily secondary to an increase in nonthyroid, second malignancies. Another study also found no improvement in DFS following remnant ablation (13), but additional studies revealed a significant improvement in DFS for children with PTC treated with 131I and no clear increase in the risk of second primary malignancies (169).\n\n[C11] Which Children Might Benefit from Therapeutic 131I?\n\n131I is indicated for treatment of nodal or other locoregional disease that is not amenable to surgery as well as distant metastases that are known or presumed to be iodine-avid (169). In addition, some experts also advocate routine 131I therapy for children with T3 tumors or extensive regional nodal involvement (extensive N1a or N1b disease) (9,169).\n\nPublished studies show that children with iodine-avid pulmonary metastases benefit from 131I treatment, and complete remission is achievable for many patients, particularly those with microscopic and small-volume lung disease (9,57,58,162,227). Thus, for patients with pulmonary metastases, 131I is considered therapeutic, with the understanding that increasing burden of disease may ultimately require administration of multiple activities (57) (see Section D8).\n\n■ RECOMMENDATION 17\n\n131I is indicated for treatment of iodine-avid persistent locoregional or nodal disease that cannot be resected as well as known or presumed iodine-avid distant metastases. For patients with persistent disease following 131I administration, the decision to pursue additional 131I therapy should be individualized according to clinical data and previous response (see and ). The potential risks and benefits must be weighed on an individual basis.\n\nRecommendation rating: B\n\n[C12] How Should a Child Be Prepared for 131I?\n\nIf 131I is prescribed, the TSH should be above 30 mIU/L to facilitate uptake (21,228,229). The majority of children will achieve this level of TSH by ≥14 days of LT4 withdrawal (230). For that reason, triiodothyronine supplementation during LT4 withdrawal is not usually required but can be considered for children who are especially sensitive to hypothyroid symptoms or if the withdrawal period extends beyond 3 weeks.\n\nRecombinant human TSH (rhTSH) has been used for remnant ablation as well as for treatment of intermediate- and high-risk DTC in adults (231–233) and may result in a lower absorbed radiation activity to the blood (as much as one third lower) (234). However, data regarding the use of rhTSH in children are limited (235,236). Experience in children would suggest that the typical adult dose of rhTSH (two doses of 0.9 mg given 24 hours apart) appears to be safe and generates sufficient TSH levels (169,236,237). In particular, rhTSH might have a role in situations in which endogenous hypothyroidism should be avoided (e.g., significant medical comorbidities) or is impossible (e.g., TSH deficiency) (169,236).\n\nTo facilitate RAI uptake, a low-iodine diet is generally prescribed for 2 weeks prior to therapy, but the efficacy of this practice in children has not been specifically demonstrated. Nevertheless, a low-iodine diet has been shown to increase the effective radiation dose to the thyroid by 50%–150% in adults (238). For that reason, a low-iodine diet is commonly recommended. In children who received intravenous contrast during preoperative staging, it is advisable to wait approximately 2–3 months or to confirm normal (median normal 24-hour urine iodine excretion=143 μg/24 hour, 5%–95% range=75–297 μg/24 hour) (239) or low 24-hour urine iodine values before performing either a DxWBS or administering therapeutic 131I.\n\n■ RECOMMENDATION 18\n\nIn order to facilitate 131I uptake by residual iodine-avid cancer, the TSH level should be above 30 mIU/L. This can be achieved in almost all children by withdrawing LT4 for ≥14 days. In selected patients who cannot mount an adequate TSH response or cannot tolerate profound hypothyroidism, rhTSH may be considered. Low-iodine diets have not been specifically evaluated in children but may enhance the effective radiation activity of 131I and are recommended.\n\nRecommendation rating: A\n\n[C13] What Should Be Considered for Administration of 131I?\n\nGeneral guidelines for safety in the administration of 131I were reviewed by the ATA Task Force on Radiation Safety in 2011 (240). There are few specific references to children, but the overall document pertains to children as well as adults. Once the decision to administer 131I is made, the safety of family members and classmates will help guide the decision for inpatient or outpatient therapy. This will be largely based on patient age and ability to comprehend the tasks required for outpatient therapy. Other factors to consider are the amount of radiation retained by the patient and the potential exposure time and distance between patient and others (240). In general, children and adolescents with PTC are primarily a radiation risk to others during the first 1–2 days after 131I therapy. For young children, this may be especially problematic, if they are not yet toilet trained or are frightened to sleep alone. Detailed instructions for the daily care of children who have received 131I are provided in the ATA guidelines on radiation safety and abbreviated in appendix 1 of that document (240).\n\nAdjunctive therapies to minimize the risk of 131I to the treated child have not been well studied. Adequate hydration is essential to enhance 131I clearance and should be encouraged. Regular bowel evacuation is also important, so stool softeners or laxatives may be considered. Nausea and/or vomiting are common following 131I therapy, particularly in young children and those receiving higher 131I activities. In such cases, anti-emetics like the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonists can be considered. Accelerating 131I clearance from the salivary glands may reduce the risk of sialadenitis, but the use of sialagogues such as sour candy or lemon juice is poorly studied in children. Some studies in adults found benefit by starting lemon drops 24 hours after 131I dosing (241), but some experts do not recommend this practice. Similarly, the use of the radioprotectant amifostine has not been validated in children, and a recent review of randomized control trials in adults found no benefit from amifostine therapy (242).\n\nAdjunctive treatments to increase the efficacy of 131I therapy have also not been well studied in children. In adults with PTC, co-treatment with lithium has been suggested to increase 131I retention and improve the efficacy of treatment of metastatic tumors (243). To our knowledge, no study of children with PTC has evaluated the safety and efficacy of lithium co-treatment. Because the expression of NIS is more common and more robust in pediatric PTC, the effect of lithium on 131I retention might be less than that found in adults (169).\n\n■ RECOMMENDATION 19(A)\n\nAdequate hydration should be ensured in all children receiving therapeutic 131I to facilitate clearance of the radioisotope, and additional supportive care with anti-emetic medications and stool softeners/laxatives should be considered. Sour candy or lemon drops can be given after 131I treatment, but not all experts ascribe to this practice.\n\nRecommendation rating: C\n\n■ RECOMMENDATION 19(B)\n\nThe routine use of lithium and amifostine cannot be recommended.\n\nRecommendation rating: F\n\n[C14] How Is the Activity of Therapeutic 131I Determined?\n\nTherapeutic 131I administration is commonly based on either empiric dosing or whole body dosimetry. There are no standardized activities of 131I for children and, to our knowledge, there are no data that compare the efficacy, safety, or long-term outcomes from 131I administration in children using these different approaches.\n\nEmpiric dosing offers the advantage of simplicity. Some adjust 131I activity according to weight or body surface area and give a fraction (e.g., child's weight in kilograms/70 kg) based on the typical adult activity used to treat similar disease extent (1,3,21,219,229). Others suggest that 131I activities to treat residual disease should be based on body weight alone (1.0–1.5 mCi/kg; 37–56 MBq/kg), while still others feel this may not be as reliable as dosing based on body surface area. In general terms, a 15-year-old may require five sixths of the adult activity, a 10-year-old may require one half of the adult activity, and a 5-year-old may only require one third of the adult activity for similar extent of disease (169).\n\nFor children with diffuse lung uptake or significant distant metastases, those undergoing multiple 131I treatments, or children who may have limited bone marrow reserve due to prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy, whole-body dosimetry can be used to calculate the largest activity of 131I that could theoretically be administered so that the absorbed activity to the blood does not exceed 200 rads (cGy) and that the whole-body retention 48 hours after administration does not exceed 4.44 GBq (120 mCi) in the absence, or 2.96 GBq (80 mCi) in the presence, of iodine-avid diffuse lung metastases, respectively (244–246). Lesional dosimetry can also be performed to select effective activities of 131I for children with substantial lung involvement or large tumor burden at distant sites such as bone (209,210,245,247,248). One must keep in mind that these toxicity constraints have not been validated in pediatrics and may be associated with significant toxicity in young children (249,250). Furthermore, these protocols are time consuming and not routinely available at all referral centers.\n\n■ RECOMMENDATION 20\n\nBased on the lack of data comparing empiric treatment and treatment informed by dosimetry, we are unable to recommend for or against either approach in most patients. Many experts provide the first activity of 131I based on an empiric estimate and reserve dosimetry for patients with diffuse pulmonary metastases or subsequent activities of 131I in patients with iodine-avid distant metastases who require additional therapy. However, dosimetry can be considered prior to the first 131I treatment in small children and in patients with limited bone marrow reserve. Due to the differences in body size and iodine clearance in children compared with adults, it is recommended that all activities of 131I should be calculated by experts with experience in dosing children.\n\nRecommendation rating: I\n\n[C15] Should a Posttreatment Whole-Body Scan Be Obtained?\n\nApproximately 4–7 days after 131I therapy, a posttreatment whole-body scan should be performed to take advantage of the increased sensitivity associated with administration of the larger activity of 131I used for therapy (208). Newer gamma-camera systems allow scanning as early as 72 hours after 131I therapy (251). On occasion, the posttreatment WBS (RxWBS) may reveal metastatic disease (regional or pulmonary) that was not apparent on the DxWBS (218), but it remains uncertain if this knowledge informs future treatment or outcomes. If new lesions are identified on the RxWBS, the addition of SPECT/CT to the RxWBS may afford greater definition of residual disease during postoperative restaging (252).\n\nIn addition, the clearance of RAI from thyroid cancers has been shown to vary substantially with biological half-life ranging from 3 to 12 days (253). Rapid turnover of iodine might clear 131I by the time standard imaging protocols are performed, while other lesions might be better revealed with delayed imaging (254). For the rare child with elevated serum Tg and negative RxWBS, serial acquisition times may be beneficial in documenting disease and iodine avidity.\n\n■ RECOMMENDATION 21\n\nA posttreatment WBS is recommended for all children 4–7 days after 131I therapy. The addition of SPECT/CT may help to distinguish the anatomic location of focal uptake.\n\nRecommendation rating: B\n\n[C16] What Are the Acute and Long-Term Risks of 131I Therapy in Children?\n\nThere are both acute and long-term side effects and complications associated with exposure to therapeutic 131I. The side effects can be organized by organ system, and the majority are explained by mechanistic exposure based on the method of delivery, absorption, distribu"
