        "text": "I have been reading all these theories of why Goans prefer to speak in English rather than in Konkani and it is tiring to go through the lame excuses and so here is my bit and hope it will put paid to the hypocrisy and the pretence of being of a superior clad of people.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that Goans — and I specifically mean ‘Catholic Goans’ — suffer from an inferiority complex. Period.\n\nThis complex came about when a British Navy ship landed in Goa to take in fresh supplies and found out that the locals had no trouble handling pork, beef and booze while some of them could keep a store's ledger and almost all of them played some musical instrument. The Brits took them across the globe in shiploads as waiters, cooks, barmen, storekeepers and musicians. In India, it was the East India Company that employed them as clerks; the Roman script they had learnt under the Portuguese, came in handy; English could be learnt on the trot. They were now in all the major cities of India; Karachi and Lahore included. They would now hob-knob with the white man at Sunday service! Those that worked in Britt households, soon brought their wives to live with them at their workplace, where they then worked as ‘Ayahs’ to the Britt kids and they would soon pick up the “Gaoro’s” language. A houseboy was also a worthwhile job.\n\nThose returning home to Goa on annual leave, would talk of how they hobnob with the Gaoras and how like them they were too (today, my mundkar tells me proudly of how her grandmother would speak in chaste Eengleesh)! Many would look upon themselves as ‘Anglo Indians’ and Fernandes would soon become Ferns and Rodrigues even better; Rodricks!\n\nThis was particularly true for the ‘Sudras’; the ‘Brahmins’ preferring to speak in Portuguese and after the liberation of Goa, in English; the Chaddis in between… confused coconuts; the name, not inappropriate… brown on the outside and white on the inside.\n\nThe die was cast. Today’s Catholic Goans are a ‘racist’ lot. They shun the mother tongue and opt for speaking in English. Result, no Catholic Goan speaks a single language correctly. It is pathetic… at a supermarket I heard a woman shout; ‘Not telling you make susu there!’ I didn’t understand what was said in a rat-a-tat AK 47 voice until I turned around to see… She was shouting at her 3-yr. old, who was peeing in the aisle. She carried on talking to the staff in her perceived enlightenment and command of ‘Engleesh’. It was disgusting. Goan Catholics need to have a good look at themselves and find their identity; not assume somebody else’s.\n\nThis woman is bent on making a Portuguese passport and moving off to London. She doesn’t mind staying 16-to-flat, having now lost both her self-esteem and self-respect and unwittingly, she is also a racist. Goans will migrate to Canada and the US; lands that were take over from the Inuits and the Red Indians while shooting the original inhabitants like vermin and corralling them in reserves. Those lands were taken in the name of Christianity; the Pope and Church sanctioning it. Goans (my spell checker brings up ‘Goons’) will migrate to Australia (a land first populated by criminals, thieves, murderers and prostitutes) and New Zealand; once again, lands that were forcibly taken over by racist of ‘white’ men; Aborigine children forcefully separated from their parents and ‘educated’ in camps and the elders put in ‘settlements’. In New Zealand, the first thing that Captain Cook did was to shoot dead the chief of a Maori tribe on the beach, as they came forward peacefully to greet the sailors. Today, these racists — like wintering migrating ducks ­— flock down to Goa in the northern winters and look down upon us locals as unfortunates, left behind; haughty disdain while announcing that they are Canadian, UK or whatever racist country they hold passports from. Forget that Goans have lost their identity… they have no moral fibre nor character left in them anymore.\n\nAnyway, we in India now have a Govt. at the centre who are putting things right. In the new education policy 2020, a child will be taught in his ‘mother’ or ‘native’ tongue until class 5. This is ‘Good News’ to many of us in Goa. Konkani is a derivative of Sanskrit (alphabet of the gods, from deva god + nigari an Indian alphabet) and enriched by the Saraswats of the Mohenjo-Daro and Harappan Civilizations, who came and settled in Goa when the Saraswathi river went dry around about the 13th. century (You may read of it in my book ‘The Teardrop Theory’). It is the most southern of the ‘Devanagari’ on the Indian sub-continent and our ancient Sanskrit language and is the root of all languages spoken outside of Africa and on those islands that split off from Africa 75,000-years ago and now form parts of countries in the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean. In the new Educational plan 2020, I will side with the Govt. of Goa to teach Konkani in the Devanagiri script. The Roman script is not Indian.\n\nFurthermore, all European languages have their roots in Sanskrit and the ‘white’ man has grouped his language as an ‘Indo-European Group of Languages’, rather than an ‘Indic’ language. The Innuits and the Red Indians speak a derivative of Sanskrit or Indic, not an ‘Indo-European’ language. They only set their eyes on a white man in the late 15th. century; the Indians were in the Americas for some 30,000-years before that.\n\nNow, to make my point about Catholic Goans being Anglophiles or Portofilos, here is what happened in 2009. My daughter had just passed out in August from the London School of Economics (LSE) and was immediately snapped up by David Cameroon to work initially for his ‘Vote for Change’ campaign. Three months later, she came down to India and was here for Christmas, having dumped David Cameroon and the UK for good.\n\nI was sitting at my wife’s place in Margao, when her sister-in-law — a college lecturer — said to me in her sing-song Margao-Brahmin-Portuguese-accented-Engleesh: ‘Why have you called Gina back to India?’ I said that this was her home and why the question? The reply: ‘No… she could have stayed there only no… married there no?’\n\nMy daughter was not only back in India, which she dearly loves (speaks Hindi, Marathi Konkani fluently and Tamil by now I hope and like me, six languages and now learn Sanskrit and she… Tamil), married a Tamilian, who is today Head of OXFAM (Africa) and they live in Nairobi; proud Indian Citizens! Deepak communicates with his 8-month old daughter in Tamil; proud of his heritage. Gina attends Embassy dinners in her favourite saris; Deepak, sometimes in a turban!\n\nNow, some of you might be trying to figure out why this long post from me and what am I trying to get across. So, first and foremost, I am an Indian Citizen, a proud one at that, a Hindu, a BJP paying member and a foot-soldier of the RSS too. What I would like most, is to see the Catholic Goan integrate into the Indic way of life; join the services, the police force and first and foremost, stop talking in a foreign language thrust upon us by thieves, invaders and slave trading colonialists. Stand by your ancient roots that lie deep in this sub-continent. Be a proud Indian. If you are a Goan and hold citizenship of another country, please restrain yourselves and do not get involved in our Indic customs and traditions. Show some loyalty to your adopted white race at least.\n\nStop the hypocrisy and the double standards and let us talk about books on this forum.\n\nRaymond Dias"
