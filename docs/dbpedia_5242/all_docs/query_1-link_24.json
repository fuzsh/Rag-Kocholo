        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nCloud-to-ground lightning flash density results for the contiguous United States have been published by Orville (1991, 1994) for the years 1989–91. In the present paper, we extend these results four years to cover the most recently acquired cloud-to-ground lightning information for the period 1992–95.\n\nFlash density measurements, or the number of lightning flashes to ground per unit area per unit time, are of fundamental interest on all spatial and temporal scales. Contour plots of the annual cloud-to-ground lightning flash counts reveal the areas with the most frequent lightning from year to year. We will see that this varies from Florida (1992 and 1994), to the St. Louis area (1993), to the Kentucky–Illinois border and southern Louisiana (1995). Recordings of cloud-to-ground positive lightning show a numerical increase over the four years, from 0.6 million (1992) to 2.1 million (1995). The percentage of positive lightning, however, remains between 4% and 5% (1992–94), increasing to 9.3% in 1995. The data, results, and discussion of these 1992–95 measurements are presented in the following sections.\n\n2. Data\n\nAll data were obtained by the National Lightning Detection Network, which is operated by the GeoMet Data Services, Inc. (now Global Atmospherics, Inc.) Tucson, Arizona. The network consists of over 100 wideband magnetic direction finders (Orville 1991, 1994) augmented by time-of-arrival (TOA) sensors beginning in July 1994 (see Fig. 1). It is believed and assumed that augmentation of the TOA sensors does not significantly increase the number of flashes recorded. This assumption is supported by the data presented in Table 1 and Fig. 2, which show that the number of flashes recorded since July 1994 appears to vary little month by month when compared to a previous year such as 1993. This comparison is not true, however, for the year 1992 when there was generally less lightning on a month-by-month basis compared to subsequent years.\n\nLocations of the magnetic direction finders in the contiguous United States have been published previously (Orville 1991, Fig. 2; Orville 1994, Fig. 1). Changes in the network configuration in subsequent years (1994–95) have resulted in a modified configuration shown in Fig. 1. We assume that the modified configuration does not affect significantly the results in this paper. The principles of magnetic direction finding, detection efficiency, and location errors have been discussed previously by several authors (e.g., Krider et al. 1976,1980; Mach et al. 1986; Orville 1994) and will not be repeated here. In our present analysis, we assume that a 70% detection efficiency applies throughout the network. Recent detection efficiency measurements in New York reported by Pyle (1995) show an average efficiency of 76%. All flash density results in this paper are the result of multiplying the measurements by a factor of 1.4 to correct for the 70% detection efficiency. It is not obvious, however, that the detection efficiency is the same for negative and positive flashes. Hojo et al. (1989, Fig. 1) using a magnetic direction finder network in the mid-1980s report a detection efficiency for positive flashes that is less than for negative flashes at all distances from their medium gain direction finders. In the absence of separate measurements of negative and positive flash detection efficiencies for the advanced lightning direction finders (ALDF), we will assume that the detection efficiencies are the same. Location errors are assumed to be on the order of 10 km and do not affect the results reported here. Recent measurements by Pyle, however, suggest that the location errors may be significantly less than 10 km.\n\nThe contour plots in this paper are based on a grid of 3000 points, 60 along the x axis and 50 along the y axis. This is the only grid scale currently available in the analysis software. On maps of the United States, this grid corresponds to a spatial resolution of 90 km in the east–west direction and to 65 km in the north–south direction. Variations of the flash parameters occurring on a smaller scale will, of course, not be resolved in the present maps.\n\n4. Discussion\n\na. Ground flash density\n\nThe dramatic variation of the ground flash density from maxima in Florida in 1989, 1990, 1991, (Orville 1994, plates 1a, 2a, and 3a), 1992 and 1994 (Figs. 3a and 3c) to a singular maximum in 1993 (Fig. 3b) in the Midwest is further evidence of the unusual weather that dominated the Midwest in 1993. In the words of Changnon (1994),\n\nThe flood of 1993 was a massive summer-long culmination of heavy rains encompassing the Upper Mississippi River Basin and the lower Missouri River Basin and their tributaries. Record summer rainfall over 9 midwestern states created record high river levels leading to astronomical economic losses and social disruption. The record floods were unique meteorologically because of their long duration through summer. The $15 to $20 billion in losses made the flood of 1993 the worst on record in the United States.\n\nThe 1993 ground flash density peak in the Midwest, exceeding 11 flashes per square kilometer, is consistent with the observations of the heavy rains throughout the summer of 1993.\n\nLightning and precipitation studies were initiated approximately three decades ago. Battan (1965) deployed approximately thirty rain gauges in the Santa Catalina Mountains of Arizona from 1957 to 1962 and discovered a statistically significant correlation between mean rainfall and the number of cloud-to-ground lightning flashes. Subsequent studies have been made by Piepgrass et al. (1982) and Shih (1988), both at the NASA Kennedy Space Center. Shih examined cloud-to-ground lightning flashes and precipitation observations and found that the flash rate predicted the total area-average rainfall. Kane (1990) performed an analysis, based on cloud-to-ground lightning data, of a localized flooding event that occurred in eastern Ohio on 14 June 1990. He noted a well-behaved correlation between the areas that received over 3\" of rain and the most dense region of cloud-to-ground lightning flashes.\n\nWe should be careful, however, to note that the referenced studies and the data presented in this paper are for thunderstorms over land. Extrapolation of any results from land to thunderstorms over the ocean is not justified. Zipser (1994) has noted that in parts of West Africa, Oceania, and other equatorial regions, climatologically, there is actually a minimum of thunderstorm activity corresponding to the month(s) of peak precipitation. Clearly, more research is needed to understand the relationship between precipitation and lightning.\n\nb. Positive ground flash density\n\nThe positive flash densities have maxima in the Midwest in all four years, 1992–95. It is particularly dramatic in 1993 where there is one maximum centered in eastern Iowa. The maximum of 0.9 flashes per square kilometer in Fig. 4b is three times the maximum in Florida, on the order of 0.3 flashes per square kilometer. Positive flash densities for the years 1992–95 are low along the East Coast and in the West, continuing this observation from the years, 1989–91 (Orville 1994).\n\nIt is interesting that the location of maximum positive flash densities, in the Midwest, is geographically in agreement with the reported locations of discharges between the top of clouds and the ionosphere, now known as sprites (Sentman and Westcott 1993; Winckler et al. 1993; Lyons 1994). This may be fortuitous. Searches for sprites in other geographical areas of the United States and other countries are continuing.\n\nc. Percent positive polarity\n\nThe percentage positive lightning contours have local maxima along the West Coast, in the upper Midwest, and in the Northeast (Fig. 7). Instrumentation effects that might contribute to the local maxima along the West Coast and in the Northeast have been discussed previously by Orville (1994). No instrumentation effects, however, are known to contribute to the high percentage of positive lightning in the upper Midwest and in the southern Plains and lower Midwest in 1995 (Fig. 7d). The explanation for these secondary percentage positive maxima remains unknown.\n\nWe have noted previously (Orville 1994) that the broad area of positive polarity in the Midwest coincides with the observation by Rutledge and MacGorman (1988) of the occurrence of positive flashes in stratiform precipitation in mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), a frequent storm type east of the Rocky Mountains. The existence of thunderstorms east of the continental divide, dominated by positive lightning, is now well documented, for example, Curran and Rust (1992), Branick and Doswell (1992), and Stolzenburg (1994)."
