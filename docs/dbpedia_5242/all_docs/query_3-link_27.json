The details change, but the attitudes do not.\n\nOnline today I read an article about an airline in India that is experimenting with offering female passengers the chance to choose a seat that is not next to a man. Enough women have been groped on flights that the airline will now let women who are choosing their seat see which seats have already been selected by men, so that they can choose their own seat accordingly, if they would rather not sit next to a man they don’t know.\n\nMost women who commented on the article thought this was a great idea.

Another said the solution was not for men to behave themselves, but for women to take self-defense classes.
