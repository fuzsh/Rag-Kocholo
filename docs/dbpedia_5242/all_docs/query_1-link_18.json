        "text": "Abstract\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, novel nanoparticle-based mRNA vaccines were developed. A small number of individuals developed allergic reactions to these vaccines although the mechanisms remain undefined.To understand COVID-19 vaccine-mediated allergic reactions, we enrolled 19 participants who developed allergic events within 2 h of vaccination and 13 controls, nonreactors. Using standard hemolysis assays, we demonstrated that sera from allergic participants induced stronger complement activation compared to nonallergic subjects following ex vivo vaccine exposure.Vaccine-mediated complement activation correlated with anti-polyethelyne glycol (PEG) IgG (but not IgM) levels while anti-PEG IgE was undetectable in all subjects. Depletion of total IgG suppressed complement activation in select individuals. To investigate the effects of vaccine excipients on basophil function, we employed a validated indirect basophil activation test that stratified the allergic populations into high and low responders. Complement C3a and C5a receptor blockade in this system suppressed basophil response, providing strong evidence for complement involvement in vaccine-mediated basophil activation. Single-cell multiome analysis revealed differential expression of genes encoding the cytokine response and Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways within the monocyte compartment. Differential chromatin accessibility for IL-13 and IL-1B genes was found in allergic and nonallergic participants, suggesting that in vivo, epigenetic modulation of mononuclear phagocyte immunophenotypes determines their subsequent functional responsiveness, contributing to the overall physiologic manifestation of vaccine reactions.These findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying allergic reactions to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, which may be used for future vaccine strategies in individuals with prior history of allergies or reactions and reduce vaccine hesitancy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/all.16231\n\nView details for PubMedID 39033312\n\nAbstract\n\nSecretory granule (SG) fusion is an intermediate step in SG biogenesis. However, the precise mechanism of this process is not completely understood. We show that Golgi-derived mast cell (MC) SGs enlarge through a mechanism that is dependent on phosphoinositide (PI) remodeling and fusion with LC3+ late endosomes (amphisomes), which serve as hubs for the fusion of multiple individual SGs. Amphisome formation is regulated by the tyrosine phosphatase PTPN9, while the subsequent SG fusion event is additionally regulated by the tetraspanin protein CD63 and by PI4K. We also demonstrate that fusion with amphisomes imparts to SGs their capacity of regulated release of exosomes. Finally, we show that conversion of PI(3,4,5)P3 to PI(4,5)P2 and the subsequent recruitment of dynamin stimulate SG fission. Our data unveil a key role for lipid-regulated interactions with the endocytic and autophagic systems in controlling the size and number of SGs and their capacity to release exosomes.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.celrep.2024.114482\n\nView details for PubMedID 38985670\n\nAbstract\n\nMast cells are tissue-resident immune cells strategically located in different compartments of the normal human heart (the myocardium, pericardium, aortic valve and close to nerves) as well as in atherosclerotic plaques. Cardiac mast cells produce a broad spectrum of vasoactive and proinflammatory mediators, which have potential roles in inflammation, angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, tissue remodeling and fibrosis. Mast cells release preformed mediators (e.g., histamine, tryptase, chymase) and de novo synthesized mediators [e.g., cysteinyl leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2)], as well as cytokines and chemokines, which can activate different resident immune cells (e.g., macrophages) and structural cells (e.g., fibroblasts, endothelial cells) in the human heart and aorta. The transcriptional profiles of various mast cell populations highlight their potential heterogeneity and distinct gene and proteome expression. Mast cell plasticity and/or heterogeneity enable these cells the potential for performing different, even opposite, functions in response to changing tissue contexts. Human cardiac mast cells display significant differences compared to mast cells isolated from other organs. These characteristics make cardiac mast cells intriguing, given their dichotomous potential roles of inducing or protecting against cardiovascular diseases. Identification of cardiac mast cell subpopulations represents a prerequisite for understanding their potential multifaceted roles in health and disease. Several new drugs specifically targeting human mast cell activation are under development or in clinical trials. Mast cells and/or their subpopulations can potentially represent novel therapeutic targets for cardiovascular disorders.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/cvr/cvae066\n\nView details for PubMedID 38630620\n\nAbstract\n\nConventional basophil activation tests (BATs) measure basophil activation by the increased expression of CD63. Previously, fluorophore-labeled avidin, a positively-charged molecule, was found to bind to activated basophils, which tend to expose negatively charged granule constituents during degranulation. This study further compares avidin versus CD63 as basophil activation biomarkers in classifying peanut allergy.Seventy subjects with either a peanut allergy (N = 47), a food allergy other than peanut (N = 6), or no food allergy (N = 17) were evaluated. We conducted BATs in response to seven peanut extract (PE) concentrations (0.01-10,000 ng/mL) and four control conditions (no stimulant, anti-IgE, fMLP (N-formylmethionine-leucyl-phenylalanine), and anti-FcεRI). We measured avidin binding and CD63 expression on basophils with flow cytometry. We evaluated logistic regression and XGBoost models for peanut allergy classification and feature identification.Avidin binding was correlated with CD63 expression. Both markers discriminated between subjects with and without a peanut allergy. Although small by percentage, an avidin+ /CD63- cell subset was found in all allergic subjects tested, indicating that the combination of avidin and CD63 could allow a more comprehensive identification of activated basophils. Indeed, we obtained the best classification accuracy (97.8% sensitivity, 96.7% specificity) by combining avidin and CD63 across seven PE doses. Similar accuracy was obtained by combining PE dose of 10,000 ng/mL for avidin and PE doses of 10 and 100 ng/mL for CD63.Avidin and CD63 are reliable BAT activation markers associated with degranulation. Their combination enhances the identification of activated basophils and improves the classification accuracy of peanut allergy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/all.15930\n\nView details for PubMedID 37916710\n\nAbstract\n\nThe exponential growth of precision diagnostic tools, including omic technologies, molecular diagnostics, sophisticated genetic and epigenetic editing, imaging and nano-technologies and patient access to extensive health care, has resulted in vast amounts of unbiased data enabling in-depth disease characterization. New disease endotypes have been identified for various allergic diseases and triggered the gradual transition from a disease description focused on symptoms to identifying biomarkers and intricate pathogenetic and metabolic pathways. Consequently, the current disease taxonomy has to be revised for better categorization. This European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Position Paper responds to this challenge and provides a modern nomenclature for allergic diseases, which respects the earlier classifications back to the early 20th century. Hypersensitivity reactions originally described by Gell and Coombs have been extended into nine different types comprising antibody- (I-III), cell-mediated (IVa-c), tissue-driven mechanisms (V-VI) and direct response to chemicals (VII). Types I-III are linked to classical and newly described clinical conditions. Type IVa-c are specified and detailed according to the current understanding of T1, T2 and T3 responses. Types V-VI involve epithelial barrier defects and metabolic-induced immune dysregulation, while direct cellular and inflammatory responses to chemicals are covered in type VII. It is notable that several combinations of mixed types may appear in the clinical setting. The clinical relevance of the current approach for allergy practice will be conferred in another article that will follow this year, aiming at showing the relevance in clinical practice where various endotypes can overlap and evolve over the lifetime.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/all.15889\n\nView details for PubMedID 37814905\n\nAbstract\n\nPhysiologic levels of basal serum tryptase vary among healthy individuals, depending on the numbers of mast cells, basal secretion rate, copy numbers of the TPSAB1 gene encoding alpha tryptase, and renal function. Recently, there has been a growing debate about the normal range of tryptase because individuals with the hereditary alpha tryptasemia (HαT) trait may or may not be symptomatic, and if symptomatic, uncertainty exists as to whether this trait directly causes clinical phenotypes or aggravates certain conditions. In fact, most HαT-positive cases are regarded asymptomatic concerning MC activation. To address this point, experts of the European Competence Network on Mastocytosis (ECNM) and the American Initiative on Mast Cell Diseases met at the 2022 Annual ECNM meeting and discussed the physiologic tryptase range. Based on this discussion, our faculty concluded that the ´normal serum tryptase range´ should be defined in asymptomatic controls, inclusive of individuals with HαT, and based on 2 standard deviations covering the 95% confidence interval. By applying this definition in a literature screen, the normal basal tryptase in asymptomatic controls (HαT-positive persons included) ranges between 1 and 15 ng/mL. This definition should avoid over-interpretation, unnecessary referrals, and unnecessary anxiety or anticipatory fear of illness in healthy individuals.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jaip.2023.08.008\n\nView details for PubMedID 37572755\n\nAbstract\n\nMastocytosis is a heterogeneous group of neoplasms defined by a numerical increase and accumulation of clonal mast cells (MCs) in various organ systems. The disease may present as cutaneous mastocytosis or systemic mastocytosis (SM). On the basis of histopathological and molecular features, clinical variables, and organ involvement, SM is divided into indolent SM, smoldering SM, SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm, aggressive SM, and MC leukemia. Each variant is defined by unique diagnostic criteria and a unique spectrum of clinical presentations. A key driver of MC expansion and disease evolution is the oncogenic machinery triggered by mutant forms of KIT. The genetic background, additional somatic mutations, and comorbidities also contribute to the course and prognosis. Patients with SM may also suffer from mediator-related symptoms or even an MC activation syndrome. This article provides an update of concepts on the genetics, etiology, and pathology of mastocytosis, with emphasis on diagnostic criteria and new treatment concepts. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Pathology: Mechanisms of Disease, Volume 18 is January 2023.

These include hematopoietic progenitors, melanocytes, germ cells, and mast cells, which all are significantly affected by loss-of-function mutations of KIT or SCF. Such mutations also influence the development and/or function of additional cells, including those in parts of the CNS and the interstitial cells of Cajal (that control gut motility). Many other cells can express KIT constitutively or during immune responses, including dendritic cells, eosinophils, ILC2 cells, and taste cells. Yet the biological importance of KIT in many of these cell types largely remains to be determined. We here review the history of work investigating mice with mutations affecting the W locus (that encodes KIT) or the Sl locus (that encodes SCF), focusing especially on the influence of such mutations on mast cells. We also briefly review efforts to target the KIT/SCF pathway with anti-SCF or anti-KIT antibodies in mouse models of allergic disorders, parasite immunity, or fibrosis in which MCs are thought to play significant roles.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jaci.2022.04.012\n\nView details for PubMedID 35469840\n\nAbstract\n\nMast cell activation is a key event in allergic reactions, other inflammatory states, and mast cell activation syndromes. Mast cell-stabilizing agents, mediator-targeting drugs and drugs interfering with mediator effects are often prescribed in these patients. However, the clinical efficacy of these drugs varies, depending on the numbers of involved mast cells and the underlying pathology. One straightforward approach would be to eradicate the primary target cell. However, to date, no mast cell-eradicating treatment approach has been developed for patients suffering from mast cell activation disorders. Nevertheless, recent data suggest that long-term treatment with agents that effectively inhibit KIT-function results in the virtual eradication of tissue mast cells and a sustained decrease in serum tryptase levels. In many of these patients, mast cell depletion is associated with a substantial improvement in mediator-induced symptoms. In patients with an underlying KIT D816V+ mastocytosis, such mast cell eradication requires an effective inhibitor of KIT D816V, such as avapritinib. However, the use of KIT inhibitors must be balanced against potential side effects. We here discuss mast cell-eradicating strategies in various disease models, the feasibility of this approach, available clinical data, and future prospects for the use of KIT-targeting drugs in mast cell activation disorders.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jaci.2022.04.003\n\nView details for PubMedID 35421448\n\nAbstract\n\nMastocytosis is a hematologic neoplasm characterized by expansion and focal accumulation of neoplastic mast cells (MC) in diverse organs, including the skin, bone marrow (BM), spleen, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. The World Health Organization classification divides the disease into prognostically distinct variants of cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) and systemic mastocytosis (SM). Although this classification remains valid, recent developments in the field and the advent of new diagnostic and prognostic parameters created a need to update and refine definitions and diagnostic criteria in MC neoplasms. In addition, MC activation syndromes (MCAS) and genetic features predisposing to SM and MCAS have been identified. To discuss these developments and refinements in the classification, we organized a Working Conference comprised of experts from Europe and the United States in August 2020. This article reports on outcomes from this conference. Of particular note, we propose adjustments in the classification of CM and SM, refinements in diagnostic criteria of SM variants, including smoldering SM and BM mastocytosis (BMM), and updated criteria for MCAS and other conditions involving MC. CD30 expression in MC now qualifies as a minor SM criterion, and BMM is now defined by SM criteria, absence of skin lesions and absence of B- and C-findings. A basal serum tryptase level exceeding 20 ng/mL remains a minor SM criterion, with recognition that hereditary alpha-tryptasemia and various myeloid neoplasms may also cause elevations in tryptase. Our updated proposal will support diagnostic evaluations and prognostication in daily practice and the conduct of clinical trials in MC disorders.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/HS9.0000000000000646\n\nView details for PubMedID 34901755\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC8659997\n\nAbstract\n\nImportance: As of May 2021, more than 32 million cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the United States, resulting in more than 615 000 deaths. Anaphylactic reactions associated with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have been reported.Objective: To characterize the immunologic mechanisms underlying allergic reactions to these vaccines.Design, Setting, and Participants: This case series included 22 patients with suspected allergic reactions to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines between December 18, 2020, and January 27, 2021, at a large regional health care network. Participants were individuals who received at least 1 of the following International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision anaphylaxis codes: T78.2XXA, T80.52XA, T78.2XXD, or E949.9, with documentation of COVID-19 vaccination. Suspected allergy cases were identified and invited for follow-up allergy testing.Exposures: FDA-authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.Main Outcomes and Measures: Allergic reactions were graded using standard definitions, including Brighton criteria. Skin prick testing was conducted to polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polysorbate 80 (P80). Histamine (1 mg/mL) and filtered saline (negative control) were used for internal validation. Basophil activation testing after stimulation for 30 minutes at 37 °C was also conducted. Concentrations of immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgE antibodies to PEG were obtained to determine possible mechanisms.Results: Of 22 patients (20 [91%] women; mean [SD] age, 40.9 [10.3] years; 15 [68%] with clinical allergy history), 17 (77%) met Brighton anaphylaxis criteria. All reactions fully resolved. Of patients who underwent skin prick tests, 0 of 11 tested positive to PEG, 0 of 11 tested positive to P80, and 1 of 10 (10%) tested positive to the same brand of mRNA vaccine used to vaccinate that individual. Among these same participants, 10 of 11 (91%) had positive basophil activation test results to PEG and 11 of 11 (100%) had positive basophil activation test results to their administered mRNA vaccine. No PEG IgE was detected; instead, PEG IgG was found in tested individuals who had an allergy to the vaccine.Conclusions and Relevance: Based on this case series, women and those with a history of allergic reactions appear at have an elevated risk of mRNA vaccine allergy. Immunological testing suggests non-IgE-mediated immune responses to PEG may be responsible in most individuals.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.25524\n\nView details for PubMedID 34533570\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Accurate diagnosis of peanut allergy is a significant clinical challenge. Here, a novel diagnostic blood test using the peanut Bead-Based Epitope Assay (\"peanut BBEA\") was developed utilizing the LEAP cohort and then validated using two independent cohorts.METHODS: The development of the peanut BBEA diagnostic test followed the National Academy of Medicine's established guidelines with discovery performed on 133 subjects from the non-interventional arm of the LEAP trial and an independent validation performed on 82 subjects from the CoFAR2 and 84 subjects from the POISED study. All samples were analyzed using the peanut BBEA methodology,which measures levels of IgE to two Ara h 2 sequential (linear) epitopes and compares their combination to a threshold pre-specified in the model development phase. When a patient has an inconclusive outcome by skin prick testing(or sIgE), IgE antibody levelsto this combination of two epitopes candistinguish whether the patient is \"Allergic\" or \"Not Allergic.\" Diagnoses of peanut allergy in all subjects were confirmed by double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge and subjects' ages were 7-55 years.RESULTS: In the validation usingCoFAR2 and POISED cohorts, the peanut BBEA diagnostic test correctly diagnosed 93% of the subjects, with a sensitivity of 91%, specificity of 95%, a positive predictive value of 95% and negative predictive value of 91%.CONCLUSIONS: In validation of the peanut BBEA diagnostic test, the overall accuracy was found to be superior to existing diagnostic tests for peanut allergy including skin prick testing, peanut sIgE and peanut component sIgE testing.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/all.14905\n\nView details for PubMedID 33991353\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: In contrast to theirclearly defined rolesin allergic diseases, the physiologic functions of Immunoglobulin E antibodies (IgEs) and mast cells (MCs) remainenigmatic. Recent research supports the toxin hypothesis,showing thatMCs and IgE-related type 2 immune responses can enhance host defense against certain noxious substances, including honeybee venom (BV). However, the mechanisms by whichMCs can interfere with BV toxicity are unknown. In this study, we assessed the role of IgE andcertain MC products inMC-mediated BV detoxification.METHODS: We appliedin vitro and in vivofluorescence microscopyimaging, andflow cytometry,fibroblast-based toxicity assaysand mass spectrometry to investigate IgE-mediated detoxification of BV cytotoxicity by mouse and human MCs in vitro. Pharmacologic strategies to interfere with MC-derived heparin and proteaseshelped to define the importance of specific detoxification mechanisms.RESULTS: Venom-specific IgE increased the degranulation and cytokineresponses of MCs to BVin vitro. Passive serum sensitization enhanced MC degranulationin vivo. IgE-activated mouse or human MCs exhibited enhanced potential for detoxifying BV by both proteolytic degradation and heparin-related interference with toxicity.Mediators released by IgE-activated human MCs efficiently degraded multiple BV toxins.CONCLUSIONS: Our results both revealthat IgEsensitization enhances the MC's ability to detoxify BVand alsoassign efficienttoxin-neutralizing activity to MC-derivedheparin and proteases. Our study thus highlights the potential importance of IgE, MCs, and particular MC products in defense against BV.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/all.14852\n\nView details for PubMedID 33840121\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Multifood Oral Immunotherapy (mOIT) with adjunctive anti-IgE (omalizumab, Xolair ) treatment affords safe, effective, and rapid desensitization to multiple foods, although the specific immune mechanisms mediating this desensitization remain to be fully elucidated.METHODS: Participants in our phase 2 mOIT trial (NCT02643862) received omalizumab from baseline to week 16 and mOIT from week 8 to week 36. We compared the immune profile of PBMCs and plasma taken at baseline, week 8 and week 36 using high-dimensional mass cytometry, component-resolved diagnostics, the indirect basophil activation test, and Luminex.RESULTS: We found (i) decreased frequency of IL4+ peanut-reactive CD4+ T cells and a marked downregulation of GPR15 expression and CXCR3 frequency among gammadelta and CD8+ T cell subsets at week 8 during the initial, omalizumab-alone induction phase; (ii) significant upregulation of the skin-homing receptor CCR4 in peanut-reactive CD4+ T and Th2 effector memory (EM) cells and of cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA) in peanut-reactive CD8+ T and CD8+ EM cells (iii) downregulation of CD86 expression among antigen-presenting cell subsets; and (iv) reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines, notably IL-17, at week 36 post-OIT. We also observed significant attenuation of the Th2 phenotype post-OIT, defined by downregulation of IL-4 peanut-reactive T cells and OX40 in Th2EM cells, increased allergen component-specific IgG4/IgE ratio, and decreased allergen-driven activation of indirectly sensitized basophils.CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study provides novel comprehensive insight into the immune underpinnings of desensitization through omalizumab-facilitated mOIT. Moreover, this study provides encouraging results to support the complex immune changes that can be induced by OIT.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/all.14833\n\nView details for PubMedID 33782956\n\nAbstract\n\nThe American Initiative in Mast Cell Diseases (AIM) held its inaugural investigator conference at Stanford University School of Medicine in May 2019. The overarching goal of this meeting was to establish a Pan-American organization of physicians and scientists with multidisciplinary expertise in mast cell disease. To serve this unmet need, AIM envisions a network where basic, translational, and clinical researchers could establish collaborations with both academia and biopharma to support the development of new diagnostic methods, enhanced understanding of the biology of mast cells in human health and disease, and the testing of novel therapies. In these AIM proceedings, we highlight selected topics relevant to mast cell biology and provide updates regarding the recently described hereditary alpha-tryptasemia. In addition, we discuss the evaluation and treatment of mast cell activation (syndromes), allergy and anaphylaxis in mast cell disorders, and the clinical and biologic heterogeneity of the more indolent forms of mastocytosis. As mast cell disorders are relatively rare, AIM hopes not only to achieve a coordination of scientific efforts in the Americas, but also in Europe by collaborating with the well-established European Competence Network on Mastocytosis (ECNM).\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jaci.2021.03.008\n\nView details for PubMedID 33745886\n\nAbstract\n\nMast cell neoplasms are one of the most frequently diagnosed malignancies in dogs. The clinical picture, course, and prognosis vary substantially among patients, depending on the anatomic site, grade and stage of the disease. The most frequently involved organ is the skin, followed by hematopoietic organs (lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and bone marrow) and mucosal sites of the oral cavity and the gastrointestinal tract. In cutaneous mast cell tumors, several grading and staging systems have been introduced. However, no comprehensive classification and no widely accepted diagnostic criteria have been proposed to date. To address these open issues and points we organized a Working Conference on canine mast cell neoplasms in Vienna in 2019. The outcomes of this meeting are summarized in this article. The proposed classification includes cutaneous mast cell tumors and their sub-variants defined by grading- and staging results, mucosal mast cell tumors, extracutaneous/extramucosal mast cell tumors without skin involvement, and mast cell leukemia (MCL). For each of these entities, diagnostic criteria are proposed. Moreover, we have refined grading and staging criteria for mast cell neoplasms in dogs based on consensus discussion. The criteria and classification proposed in this article should greatly facilitate diagnostic evaluation and prognostication in dogs with mast cell neoplasms and should thereby support management of these patients in daily practice and the conduct of clinical trials.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3389/fvets.2021.755258\n\nView details for PubMedID 34957277\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Peanut and tree nut allergies are the most important causes of anaphylaxis. Co-reactivity to more than one nut is frequent, and co-sensitization in the absence of clinical data is often obtained. Confirmatory oral food challenges (OFCs) are inconsistently performed.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the utility of the basophil activation test (BAT) in diagnosing peanut and tree nut allergy.METHODS: The Markers Of Nut Allergy Study (MONAS) prospectively enrolled patients aged 0.5-17 years with confirmed peanut and/or tree nut (almond, cashew, hazelnut, pistachio, walnut) allergy or sensitization fromCanadian (n=150) and Austrian (n=50) tertiary pediatric centers. BAT using %CD63+ basophils (SSClow/CCR3pos) as outcome was performed with whole blood samples stimulated with allergen extracts of each nut (0.001-1000ng/mL protein). BAT results were assessed against confirmed allergic status in a blinded fashion to develop a generalizable statistical model for comparisonto extract and marker allergen-specificIgE.RESULTS: A mixed effect model integrating BAT results for 10 and 100 ng/mL of peanut and individual tree nut extracts was optimal. The area under the ROC curve (AUROC) was 0.98 for peanut, 0.97 for cashew, 0.92 for hazelnut, 0.95 for pistachio, and 0.97 for walnut. The BAT outperformed sIgE testing for peanut or hazelnut and was comparable for walnut (AUROC 0.95, 0.94, 0.92) ina sub-analysis in sensitized patients undergoing OFC.CONCLUSIONS: BAT can predict allergic clinical status to peanut and tree nuts in multi-nut sensitized children and may reduce the need for high-risk OFCs in patients.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/all.14695\n\nView details for PubMedID 33300157\n\nAbstract\n\nOral immunotherapy (OIT) can successfully desensitize allergic individuals to offending foods such as peanut. Our recent clinical trial (NCT02103270) of peanut OIT allowed us to monitor peanut-specific CD4+ T cells, using MHC-peptide Dextramers, over the course of OIT. We used a single-cell targeted RNAseq assay to analyze these cells at 0, 12, 24, 52, and 104 weeks of OIT. We found a transient increase in TGFbeta-producing cells at 52 weeks in those with successful desensitization, which lasted until 117 weeks. We also performed clustering and identified 5 major clusters of Dextramer+ cells, which we tracked over time. One of these clusters appeared to be anergic, while another was consistent with recently described TFH13 cells. The other 3 clusters appeared to be Th2 cells by their coordinated production of IL-4 and IL-13, but they varied in their expression of STAT signaling proteins and other markers. A cluster with high expression of STAT family members also showed a possible transient increase at week 24 in those with successful desensitization. Single cell TCRalphabeta repertoire sequences were too diverse to track clones over time. Together with increased TGFbeta production, these changes may be mechanistic predictors of successful OIT that should be further investigated.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.clim.2020.108568\n\nView details for PubMedID 32783912\n\nAbstract\n\nIt has been estimated that around 8% of the children in the U.S. suffer from food allergy and of those, 40% are allergic to multiple foods.

Three major allergens from cashew (Ana o 1 at 50 kDa, Ana o 2 major band at 33 kDa and minor band at 53 kDa, and Ana o 3 at 10 kDa) and five major allergens from pistachio (Pis v 1 at 7 kDa, Pis v 2 at 32 kDa, Pis v 3 at 50 kDa, Pis v 4 at 23 kDa, and Pis v 5 at 36 kDa) have been identified. Of those, Ana o 1 and Pis v 3, Ana o 2 and Pis v 2, Ana o 2 and Pis v 5, Ana o 3 and Pis v 1 have been recognized as homologues based on their sequence similarity and cross reactivity to IgE from the patients.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/pai.13258\n\nView details for PubMedID 32323379\n\nAbstract\n\nPhysicians think of mast cells and IgE primarily in the context of allergic disorders, including fatal anaphylaxis. This 'bad side' of mast cells and IgE is so well accepted that it can be difficult to think of them in other contexts, particularly those in which they may have beneficial functions. However, there is evidence that mast cells and IgE, as well as basophils (circulating granulocytes whose functions partially overlap with those of mast cells), can contribute to host defense as components of adaptive type 2 immune responses to helminths, ticks and certain other parasites. Accordingly, allergies often are conceptualized as \"misdirected\" type 2 immune responses, in which IgE antibodies are produced against any of a diverse group of apparently harmless antigens, and against components of animal venoms. Indeed, certain unfortunate patients who have become sensitized to venoms develop severe IgE-associated allergic reactions, including fatal anaphylaxis, upon subsequent venom exposure. In this review, we will describe evidence that mast cells can enhance innate resistance, and survival, to challenge with reptile or arthropod venoms during a first exposure to such venoms. We also will discuss findings indicating that, in mice surviving an initial encounter with venom, acquired type 2 immune responses, IgE antibodies, the high affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI), and mast cells can contribute to acquired resistance to the lethal effects of both honeybee venom and Russell's viper venom. These findings support the hypothesis that mast cells and IgE can help protect the host against venoms and perhaps other noxious substances.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s40629-020-00118-6\n\nView details for PubMedID 33224714\n\nAbstract\n\nTargeted functional genomics represents a powerful approach for studying gene function in vivo and in vitro. However, its application to gene expression studies in human mast cells has been hampered by low yields of human mast cell cultures and their poor transfection efficiency. We developed an imaging system in which mast cell degranulation can be visualized in single cells subjected to shRNA knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. By using high-resolution confocal microscopy and a fluorochrome-labeled avidin probe, one can directly assess the alteration of functional responses, i.e., degranulation, in single human mast cells (10-12 weeks old). The elimination of a drug or marker selection step avoids the use of potentially toxic treatment procedures, and the brief hands-on time of the functional analysis step enables high-throughput screening of shRNA or CRISPR-Cas9 constructs to identify genes that regulate human mast cell degranulation. The ability to analyze single cells substantially reduces the total number of cells required and enables the parallel visualization of the degranulation profiles of both edited and non-edited mast cells, offering a consistent internal control not found in other protocols. Moreover, our protocol offers a flexible choice between RNA interference (RNAi) and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing for perturbation of gene expression using our human mast cell single-cell imaging system. Perturbation of gene expression, acquisition of microscopy data and image analysis can be completed within 5 d, requiring only standard laboratory equipment and expertise.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41596-019-0288-6\n\nView details for PubMedID 32060492\n\nAbstract\n\nBasophil activation tests (BATs) can closely monitor, in vitro, a patient's propensity to develop type I hypersensitivity reactions. Because of their high specificity and sensitivity, BATs have become promising diagnostic tools, especially in cases with equivocal clinical histories, skin prick test results, and/or levels of specific IgE to allergen extracts. BATs also are useful as tools for monitoring the effects of treatment, since oral immunotherapy (OIT) studies report a diminution in patients' basophil responsiveness over the course of OIT. This review will discuss the BAT findings obtained before, during, and after OIT for food allergy. We will mainly focus on the association of basophil responsiveness, and alterations in basophil surface markers, with clinical outcomes and other clinical features, such as blood levels of specific IgG and IgE antibodies. The detailed analysis of these correlations will ultimately facilitate the use of BATs, along with other blood biomarkers, to differentiate short-term desensitization versus sustained unresponsiveness and to improve treatment protocols. Given the critical anatomic location of mast cells adjacent to the many IgE+ plasma cells found in the gastrointestinal tissues of allergic individuals, we will also discuss the role of gastrointestinal mast cells in manifestations of food allergies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3389/fimmu.2020.602660\n\nView details for PubMedID 33381123\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC7768812\n\nAbstract\n\nThe origin and functions of mast cells (MCs) have been debated since their description by Paul Ehrlich in 1879. MCs have long been considered 'reactive bystanders' and 'amplifiers' in inflammatory processes, allergic reactions, and host responses to infectious diseases. However, knowledge about the origin, phenotypes and functions of MCs has increased substantially over the past 50 years. MCs are now known to be derived from multipotent hematopoietic progenitors, which, through a process of differentiation and maturation, form a unique hematopoietic lineage residing in multiple organs. In particular, MCs are distinguishable from basophils and other hematopoietic cells by their unique phenotype, origin(s), and spectrum of functions, both in innate and adaptive immune responses and in other settings. The concept of a unique MC lineage is further supported by the development of a distinct group of neoplasms, collectively referred to as mastocytosis, in which MC precursors expand as clonal cells. The clinical consequences of the expansion and/or activation of MCs are best established in mastocytosis and in allergic inflammation. However, MCs have also been implicated as important participants in a number of additional pathologic conditions and physiological processes. In this article, we review concepts regarding MC development, factors controlling MC expansion and activation, and some of the fundamental roles MCs may play in both health and disease. We also discuss new concepts for suppressing MC expansion and/or activation using molecularly-targeted drugs.\n\nView details for DOI 10.7150/thno.46719\n\nView details for PubMedID 32929378\n\nAbstract\n\nMast cells have existed long before the development of adaptive immunity, although they have been given different names. Thus, in the marine urochordate Styela plicata, they have been designated as test cells. However, based on their morphological characteristics (including prominent cytoplasmic granules) and mediator content (including heparin, histamine, and neutral proteases), test cells are thought to represent members of the lineage known in vertebrates as mast cells. So this lineage presumably had important functions that preceded the development of antibodies, including IgE. Yet mast cells are best known, in humans, as key sources of mediators responsible for acute allergic reactions, notably including anaphylaxis, a severe and potentially fatal IgE-dependent immediate hypersensitivity reaction to apparently harmless antigens, including many found in foods and medicines. In this review, we briefly describe the origins of tissue mast cells and outline evidence that these cells can have beneficial as well as detrimental functions, both innately and as participants in adaptive immune responses. We also discuss aspects of mast cell heterogeneity and comment on how the plasticity of this lineage may provide insight into its roles in health and disease. Finally, we consider some currently open questions that are yet unresolved.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1146/annurev-immunol-071719-094903\n\nView details for PubMedID 32340580\n\nAbstract\n\nFood allergy has reached epidemic proportions and has become a significant source of healthcare burden. Oral food challenge, the gold standard for food allergy assessment, often is not performed because it places the patient at risk of developing anaphylaxis. However, conventional alternative food allergy tests lack a sufficient predictive value. Therefore, there is a critical need for better diagnostic tests that are both accurate and safe. Microfluidic methods have the potential of helping one to address such needs and to personalize the diagnostics. This article first reviews conventional diagnostic approaches used in food allergy. Second, it reviews recent efforts to develop novel biomarkers and in vitro diagnostics. Third, it summarizes the microfluidic methods developed thus far for food allergy diagnosis. The article concludes with a discussion of future opportunities for using microfluidic methods for achieving precision diagnostics in food allergy, including multiplexing the detection of multiple biomarkers, sampling of tissue-resident cytokines and immune cells, and multi-organ-on-a-chip technology.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1063/1.5144135\n\nView details for PubMedID 32266046\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC7127910\n\nAbstract\n\nShort-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are fermented dietary components that regulate immune responses, promote colonic health and suppress mast cell-mediated diseases. However, the effects of SCFAs on human mast cell function, including the underlying mechanisms, remain unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of the SCFAs acetate, propionate and butyrate on mast cell-mediated pathology and human mast cell activation, including the molecular mechanisms involved.Precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) of allergen-exposed guinea pigs were used to assess the effects of butyrate on allergic airway contraction. Human and mouse mast cells were co-cultured with SCFAs and assessed for degranulation after IgE- or non-IgE-mediated stimulation. The underlying mechanisms involved were investigated using knockout mice, small molecule inhibitors/agonists, and genomics assays.Butyrate treatment inhibited allergen-induced histamine release and airway contraction in guinea pig PCLS. Propionate and butyrate, but not acetate, inhibited IgE and non-IgE-mediated human or mouse mast cell degranulation in a concentration-dependent manner. Notably, these effects were independent of the stimulation of SCFA receptors GPR41, GPR43 or PPAR, but instead were associated with inhibition of histone deacetylases. Transcriptome analyses revealed butyrate-induced downregulation of the tyrosine kinases BTK, SYK and LAT, critical transducers of FcεRI-mediated signals that are essential for mast cell activation. Epigenome analyses indicated that butyrate redistributed global histone acetylation in human mast cells, including significantly decreased acetylation at the BTK, SYK and LAT promoter regions.Known health benefits of SCFAs in allergic disease can, at least in part, be explained by epigenetic suppression of human mast cell activation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/all.14254\n\nView details for PubMedID 32112426\n\nAbstract\n\nIntestinal epithelial cells (IECs) contribute to the regulation of intestinal homeostasis and inflammation through their interactions with the environment and host immune responses. Yet our understanding of IEC-intrinsic regulatory pathways remains incomplete. Here, we identify the guanine nucleotide exchange factor RABGEF1 as a regulator of intestinal homeostasis and innate pathways dependent on IECs. Mice with IEC-specific Rabgef1 deletion (called Rabgef1IEC-KO mice) developed a delayed spontaneous colitis associated with the local upregulation of IEC chemokine expression. In mouse models of colitis based on Interleukin-10 deficiency or dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) exposure, we found that IEC-intrinsic RABGEF1 deficiency exacerbated development of intestinal pathology and dysregulated IEC innate pathways and chemokine expression. Mechanistically, we showed that RABGEF1 deficiency in mouse IECs in vitro was associated with an impairment of early endocytic events, an increased activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent pathway, and increased chemokine secretion. Moreover, we provided evidence that the development of spontaneous colitis was dependent on microbiota-derived signals and intrinsic MYD88-dependent pathways in vivo. Our study identifies mouse RABGEF1 as an important regulator of intestinal inflammation, MYD88-dependent IEC-intrinsic signaling, and chemokine production. This suggests that RABGEF1-dependent pathways represent interesting therapeutic targets for inflammatory conditions in the gut.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41385-019-0211-z\n\nView details for PubMedID 31628426\n\nAbstract\n\nThe pathophysiological roles of mast cells are still not fully understood, over 140 years since their description by Paul Ehrlich in 1878. Initial studies have attempted to identify distinct \"subpopulations\" of mast cells based on a relatively small number of biochemical characteristics. More recently, \"subtypes\" of mast cells have been described based on the analysis of transcriptomes of anatomically distinct mouse mast cell populations. Although mast cells can potently alter homeostasis, in certain circumstances, these cells can also contribute to the restoration of homeostasis. Both solid and hematologic tumors are associated with the accumulation of peritumoral and/or intratumoral mast cells, suggesting that these cells can help to promote and/or limit tumorigenesis. We suggest that at least two major subsets of mast cells, MC1 (meaning anti-tumorigenic) and MC2 (meaning pro-tumorigenic), and/or different mast cell mediators derived from otherwise similar cells, could play distinct or even opposite roles in tumorigenesis. Mast cells are also strategically located in the human myocardium, in atherosclerotic plaques, in close proximity to nerves and in the aortic valve. Recent studies have revealed evidence that cardiac mast cells can participate both in physiological and pathological processes in the heart. It seems likely that different subsets of mast cells, like those of cardiac macrophages, can exert distinct, even opposite, effects in different pathophysiological processes in the heart. In this chapter, we have commented on possible future needs of the ongoing efforts to identify the diverse functions of mast cells in health and disease.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3390/ijms20184397\n\nView details for PubMedID 31500217\n\nAbstract\n\nStroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States. Because post-stroke inflammation is a critical determinant of damage and recovery after stroke, understanding the interplay between the immune system and the brain after stroke holds much promise for therapeutic intervention. An understudied, but important aspect of this interplay is the role of meninges that surround the brain. All blood vessels travel through the meningeal space before entering the brain parenchyma, making the meninges ideally located to act as an immune gatekeeper for the underlying parenchyma. Emerging evidence suggests that the actions of immune cells resident in the meninges are essential for executing this gatekeeper function. Mast cells (MCs), best known as proinflammatory effector cells, are one of the long-term resident immune cells in the meninges. Here, we discuss recent findings in the literature regarding the role of MCs located in the meningeal space and stroke pathology. We review the latest advances in mouse models to investigate the roles of MCs and MC-derived products in vivo, and the importance of using these mouse models. We examine the concept of the meninges playing a critical role in brain and immune interactions, reevaluate the perspectives on the key effectors of stroke pathology, and discuss the opportunities and challenges for therapeutic development.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3389/fncel.2019.00126\n\nView details for PubMedID 31001088\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC6457367\n\nAbstract\n\nMast cell-deficient mice are widely used to identify and quantify contributions of mast cells to diverse biological responses in vivo, including allergic inflammation. However, despite the fact that scores of genes have been identified as modifiers of allergic inflammation, most mast cell-deficient models have been available only on a single genetic background. We transferred the KitW-sh allele onto the BALB/c background to generate BALB/c mast cell-deficient mice (BALB/c-KitW-sh/W-sh). BALB/c-KitW-sh/W-sh mice have dramatically reduced mast cell numbers (0-2% of wild type) in all tissues examined, as well as subtle hematologic differences from the corresponding wild type mice, including splenomegaly with evidence of increased splenic hematopoiesis. We examined in BALB/c-KitW-sh/W-sh mice models of allergic inflammation that are substantially diminished in C57BL/6-KitW-sh/W-sh mast cell-deficient mice. In a model of acute allergic inflammation, i.e., IgE-dependent passive cutaneous anaphylaxis, both ear swelling and leukocyte infiltration were largely or entirely absent in BALB/c-KitW-sh/W-sh mice. In contrast, in two different models of allergic airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, lung inflammation, and airway remodeling developed robustly in mast cell-deficient BALB/c-KitW-sh/W-sh mice. These results support the conclusion that the importance of mast cell contributions in various models of allergic inflammation may be at least partially determined by genetic background.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41374-019-0354-2\n\nView details for PubMedID 31857699\n\nAbstract\n\nOral immunotherapy (OIT) can successfully desensitize many peanut allergic subjects, but clinical tolerance diminishes over time upon discontinuation, or low dose maintenance, of peanut. Therefore, in order to improve the efficacy and sustainability of such therapy, we sought to identify biomarkers and clinical tools that can predict therapeutic outcomes and monitor treatment responses.We evaluated whether basophil activation in whole blood, and plasma levels of peanut-specific immunoglobulins, are useful biomarkers for peanut OIT.We longitudinally measured, before, during and after OIT, basophil activation in whole blood ex vivo in response to peanut stimulation, and peanut-specific IgE and IgG4, in a large, single-site, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 peanut OIT study. We compared basophil responsiveness and peanut specific immunoglobulins between those who were clinically reactive vs. tolerant to peanut oral challenges.Peanut OIT significantly decreased basophil activation, peanut-specific, Ara h 1, Ara h 2 and Ara h 3 IgEs, and sIgE/total IgE, but increased sIgG4/sIgE. Participants who became reactive to 4 g of peanut 13 weeks off active OIT exhibited higher peanut-induced basophil activation ex vivo and higher peanut-specific IgEs and sIgE/total IgE, but lower sIgG4/sIgE. Notably, participants entering the study with low basophil responsiveness were more likely to achieve treatment success. Substantial suppression of basophil activation was required to maintain long-term clinical tolerance after peanut OIT.Assessments of peanut-specific basophil activation and peanut-specific immunoglobulins can help to predict treatment outcomes, and to differentiate transient desensitization vs. sustained unresponsiveness after OIT.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jaci.2019.10.038\n\nView details for PubMedID 31805311\n\nAbstract\n\nDietary avoidance is recommended for peanut allergies. We evaluated the sustained effects of peanut allergy oral immunotherapy (OIT) in a randomised long-term study in adults and children.In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study, we enrolled participants at the Sean N Parker Center for Allergy and Asthma Research at Stanford University (Stanford, CA, USA) with peanut allergy aged 7-55 years with a positive result from a double-blind, placebo-controlled, food challenge (DBPCFC; ≤500 mg of peanut protein), a positive skin-prick test (SPT) result (≥5 mm wheal diameter above the negative control), and peanut-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E concentration of more than 4 kU/L. Participants were randomly assigned (2·4:1·4:1) in a two-by-two block design via a computerised system to be built up and maintained on 4000 mg peanut protein through to week 104 then discontinued on peanut (peanut-0 group), to be built up and maintained on 4000 mg peanut protein through to week 104 then to ingest 300 mg peanut protein daily (peanut-300 group) for 52 weeks, or to receive oat flour (placebo group). DBPCFCs to 4000 mg peanut protein were done at baseline and weeks 104, 117, 130, 143, and 156. The pharmacist assigned treatment on the basis of a randomised computer list. Peanut or placebo (oat) flour was administered orally and participants and the study team were masked throughout by use of oat flour that was similar in look and feel to the peanut flour and nose clips, as tolerated, to mask taste. The statistician was also masked. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants who passed DBPCFCs to a cumulative dose of 4000 mg at both 104 and 117 weeks. The primary efficacy analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02103270.Between April 15, 2014, and March 2, 2016, of 152 individuals assessed, we enrolled 120 participants, who were randomly assigned to the peanut-0 (n=60), peanut-300 (n=35), and placebo groups (n=25). 21 (35%) of peanut-0 group participants and one (4%) placebo group participant passed the 4000 mg challenge at both 104 and 117 weeks (odds ratio [OR] 12·7, 95% CI 1·8-554·8; p=0·0024). Over the entire study, the most common adverse events were mild gastrointestinal symptoms, which were seen in 90 of 120 patients (50/60 in the peanut-0 group, 29/35 in the peanut-300 group, and 11/25 in the placebo group) and skin disorders, which were seen in 50/120 patients (26/60 in the peanut-0 group, 15/35 in the peanut-300 group, and 9/25 in the placebo group). Adverse events decreased over time in all groups. Two participants in the peanut groups had serious adverse events during the 3-year study. In the peanut-0 group, in which eight (13%) of 60 participants passed DBPCFCs at week 156, higher baseline peanut-specific IgG4 to IgE ratio and lower Ara h 2 IgE and basophil activation responses were associated with sustained unresponsiveness. No treatment-related deaths occurred.Our study suggests that peanut OIT could desensitise individuals with peanut allergy to 4000 mg peanut protein but discontinuation, or even reduction to 300 mg daily, could increase the likelihood of regaining clinical reactivity to peanut. Since baseline blood tests correlated with week 117 treatment outcomes, this study might aid in optimal patient selection for this therapy.National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(19)31793-3\n\nView details for PubMedID 31522849\n\nAbstract\n\nAs there is limited data on the sustainability of desensitization of multifood-oral immunotherapy (multifood-OIT), we conducted a multisite multifood-OIT study to compare the efficacy of successful desensitization with sustained dosing vs discontinued dosing after multifood-OIT.We enrolled 70 participants, aged 5-22 years with multiple food allergies confirmed by double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFCs). In the open-label phase of the study, all participants received omalizumab (weeks 1-16) and multi-OIT (2-5 allergens; weeks 8-30) and eligible participants (on maintenance dose of each allergen by weeks 28-29) were randomized 1:1:1 to 1 g, 300 mg, or 0 mg arms (blinded, weeks 30-36) and then tested by food challenge at week 36. Success was defined as passing 2 g food challenge to at least 2 foods in week 36.Most participants were able to reach a dose of 2 g or higher of each of 2, 3, 4, and 5 food allergens (as applicable to the participant's food allergens in OIT) in week 36 food challenges. Using an intent-to-treat analysis, we did not find evidence that a 300 mg dose was effectively different than a 1 g dose in maintaining desensitization, and both together were more effective than OIT discontinuation (0 mg dose) (85% vs 55%, P = 0.03). Fifty-five percent of the intent-to-treat participants and 69% of per protocol participants randomized to the 0 mg arm showed no objective reactivity after 6 weeks of discontinuation. Cross-desensitization was found between cashew/pistachio and walnut/pecan when only one of the foods was part of OIT. No statistically significant safety differences were found between the three arms.These results suggest that sustained desensitization after omalizumab-facilitated multi-OIT best occurs through continued maintenance OIT dosing of either 300 mg or 1 g of each food allergen as opposed to discontinuation of multi-OIT.Sean N.

There have been continued efforts to identify alternative diagnostic methods to replace or minimize the need for oral food challenges (OFCs) in the diagnosis of food allergy. Methods: Data was extracted for all IRB-approved, Stanford-initiated clinical protocols involving standardized screening OFCs to a cumulative dose of 500 mg protein to any of 11 food allergens in participants with elevated skin prick test (SPT) and/or specific IgE (sIgE) values to the challenged food across 7 sites. Baseline population characteristics, biomarkers, and challenge outcomes were analyzed to develop diagnostic criteria predictive of positive OFCs across multiple allergens in our multi-allergic cohorts. Results: A total of 1247 OFCs completed by 427 participants were analyzed in this cohort. Eighty-five percent of all OFCs had positive challenges. A history of atopic dermatitis and multiple food allergies were significantly associated with a higher risk of positive OFCs. The majority of food-specific SPT, sIgE, and sIgE/total IgE (tIgE) thresholds calculated from cumulative tolerated dose (CTD)-dependent receiver operator curves (ROC) had high discrimination of OFC outcome (area under the curves > 0.75). Participants with values above the thresholds were more likely to have positive challenges. Conclusions: This is the first study, to our knowledge, to not only adjust for tolerated allergen dose in predicting OFC outcome, but to also use this method to establish biomarker thresholds. The presented findings suggest that readily obtainable biomarker values and patient demographics may be of use in the prediction of OFC outcome and food allergy. In the subset of patients with SPT or sIgE values above the thresholds, values appear highly predictive of a positive OFC and true food allergy. While these values are relatively high, they may serve as an appropriate substitute for food challenges in clinical and research settings.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3389/fimmu.2018.02689\n\nView details for PubMedID 30538699\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC6277531\n\nAbstract\n\nRationale: Oral immunotherapy (OIT) is an emerging treatment for food allergy. While desensitization is achieved in most subjects, many experience gastrointestinal symptoms and few develop eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease. It is unclear whether these subjects have subclinical gastrointestinal eosinophilia (GE) at baseline. We aimed to evaluate the presence of GE in subjects with food allergy before peanut OIT. Methods: We performed baseline esophagogastroduodenoscopies on 21 adults before undergoing peanut OIT. Subjects completed a detailed gastrointestinal symptom questionnaire. Endoscopic findings were assessed using the Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) Endoscopic Reference Score (EREFS) and biopsies were obtained from the esophagus, gastric antrum, and duodenum. Esophageal biopsies were evaluated using the EoE Histologic Scoring System. Immunohistochemical staining for eosinophil peroxidase (EPX) was also performed. Hematoxylin and eosin and EPX stains of each biopsy were assessed for eosinophil density and EPX/mm2 was quantified using automated image analysis. Results: All subjects were asymptomatic. Pre-existing esophageal eosinophilia (>5 eosinophils per high-power field [eos/hpf]) was present in five participants (24%), three (14%) of whom had >15 eos/hpf associated with mild endoscopic findings (edema, linear furrowing, or rings; median EREFS = 0, IQR 0-0.25). Some subjects also demonstrated basal cell hyperplasia, dilated intercellular spaces, and lamina propria fibrosis. Increased eosinophils were noted in the gastric antrum (>12 eos/hpf) or duodenum (>26 eos/hpf) in 9 subjects (43%). EPX/mm2 correlated strongly with eosinophil counts (r = 0.71, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Pre-existing GE is common in adults with IgE-mediated peanut allergy. Eosinophilic inflammation (EI) in these subjects may be accompanied by mild endoscopic and histologic findings. Longitudinal data collection during OIT is ongoing.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3389/fimmu.2018.02624\n\nView details for PubMedID 30524424\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC6261984\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Food allergy prevalence has continued to rise over the past decade. While studies have reported threshold doses for multiple foods, large-scale multi-food allergen studies are lacking. Our goal was to identify threshold dose distributions and predictors of severe reactions during blinded oral food challenges (OFCs) in multi-food allergic patients. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed on all Stanford-initiated clinical protocols involving standardized screening OFCs to any of 11 food allergens at 7 sites. Interval-censoring survival analysis was used to calculate eliciting dose (ED) curves for each food. Changes in severity and ED were also analyzed among participants who had repeated challenges to the same food. Results: Of 428 participants, 410 (96%) had at least one positive challenge (1445 standardized OFCs with 1054 total positive challenges). Participants undergoing peanut challenges had the highest ED50 (29.9 mg), while those challenged with egg or pistachio had the lowest (7.07 or 1.7 mg, respectively). The most common adverse event was skin related (54%), followed by gastrointestinal (GI) events (33%). A history of asthma was associated with a significantly higher risk of a severe reaction (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.37, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.36, 4.13). Higher values of allergen-specific IgE (sIgE) and sIgE to total IgE ratio (sIgEr) were also associated with higher risk of a severe reaction (1.49 [1.19, 1.85] and 1.84 [1.30, 2.59], respectively). Participants undergoing cashew, peanut, pecan, sesame, and walnut challenges had more severe reactions as ED increased. In participants who underwent repeat challenges, the ED did not change (p = 0.66), but reactions were more severe (p = 0.02). Conclusions: Participants with a history of asthma, high sIgEr, and/or high values of sIgE were found to be at higher risk for severe reactions during food challenges. These findings may help to optimize food challenge dosing schemes in multi-food allergic, atopic patients, specifically at lower doses where the majority of reactions occur.

Mast cells (MCs) are widely deployed in the skin and can be activated during CHS responses to secrete diverse products, including some with pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory functions. Conflicting results have been obtained regarding pathogenic versus protective roles of MCs in CHS, and this has been attributed in part to the limitations of certain models for studying MC functions in vivo. This review discusses recent advances in the development and analysis of mouse models to investigate the roles of MCs and MC-associated products in vivo. Notably, fluorescent avidin-based two-photon imaging approaches enable in vivo selective labeling and simultaneous tracking of MC secretory granules (e.g., during MC degranulation) and MC gene activation by real-time longitudinal intravital microscopy in living mice. The combination of such genetic and imaging tools has shed new light on the controversial role played by MCs in mouse models of CHS. On the one hand, they can amplify CHS responses of mild severity while, on the other hand, can limit the inflammation and tissue injury associated with more severe or chronic models, in part by representing an initial source of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29922295\n\nAbstract\n\nRegulated exocytosis is a process by which cargo, which is stored in secretory granules (SGs), is released in response to a secretory trigger. Regulated exocytosis is fundamental for intercellular communication and is a key mechanism for the secretion of neurotransmitters, hormones, inflammatory mediators, and other compounds, by a variety of cells. At least three distinct mechanisms are known for regulated exocytosis: full exocytosis, where a single SG fully fuses with the plasma membrane, kiss-and-run exocytosis, where a single SG transiently fuses with the plasma membrane, and compound exocytosis, where several SGs fuse with each other, prior to or after SG fusion with the plasma membrane. The type of regulated exocytosis undertaken by a cell is often dictated by the type of secretory trigger. However, in many cells, a single secretory trigger can activate multiple modes of regulated exocytosis simultaneously. Despite their abundance and importance across cell types and species, the mechanisms that determine the different modes of secretion are largely unresolved. One of the main challenges in investigating the different modes of regulated exocytosis, is the difficulty in distinguishing between them as well as exploring them separately. Here we describe the use of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran as an exocytosis reporter, and live cell imaging, to differentiate between the different pathways of regulated exocytosis, focusing on compound exocytosis, based on the robustness and duration of the exocytic events.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29985342\n\nAbstract\n\nMany mast cell-associated diseases, including allergies and asthma, have seen a strong increase in prevalence during the past decades, especially in Western(ized) countries. It has been suggested that a Western diet may contribute to the prevalence and manifestation of allergies and asthma through reduced intake of dietary fiber and the subsequent production of their metabolites. Indeed, dietary fiber and its metabolites have been shown to positively influence the development of immune disorders via changes in microbiota composition and the regulation of B- and T-cell activation. However, the effects of these dietary components on the activation of mast cells, key effector cells of the inflammatory response in allergies and asthma, remain poorly characterized. Due to their location in the gut and vascularized tissues, mast cells are exposed to high concentrations of dietary fiber and/or its metabolites. Here, we provide a focused overview of current findings regarding the direct effects of dietary fiber and its various metabolites on the regulation of mast cell activity and the pathophysiology of mast cell-associated diseases.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3389/fimmu.2018.01067\n\nView details for PubMedID 29910798\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC5992428\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Reliable prognostic markers for predicting severity of allergic reactions during oral food challenges (OFC) have not been established.OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop a predictive algorithm of a food challenge severity score (CSS) to identify those at higher risk for severe reactions to a standardized peanut OFC.METHODS: Medical history and allergy tests were obtained for 120 peanut-allergic participants who underwent double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFCs). Reactions were assigned a CSS between 1 to 6 based on cumulative tolerated dose and a \"severity clinical indicator.\" Demographic characteristics, clinical features, peanut component IgE values, and a basophil activation marker were considered in a multi-step analysis to derive a flexible decision rule to understand risk during peanut of OFC.RESULTS: 18.3% participants had a severe reaction (CSS >4). The decision rule identified the following three variables (in order of importance) as predictors of reaction severity: ratio of %CD63hi stimulation with peanut to %CD63hi anti-IgE (CD63 ratio), history of exercise-induced asthma, and forced expiratory volume in 1 sec/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio. The CD63 ratio alone was a strong predictor of CSS (p<0.001).CONCLUSION: The CSS is a novel tool that combines dose thresholds and allergic reactions to understand risks associated with peanut OFCs. Lab-values (CD63 ratio), along with clinical variables (exercise-induced asthma and FEV1/FVC ratio) contribute to the predictive ability of the severity of reaction to peanut OFC. Further testing of this decision rule is needed in a larger external data source before it can be considered outside of research settings.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29709643\n\nAbstract\n\nMast cells are hematopoietic cells that reside in virtually all vascularized tissues and that represent potential sources of a wide variety of biologically active secreted products, including diverse cytokines and growth factors. There is strong evidence for important non-redundant roles of mast cells in many types of innate or adaptive immune responses, including making important contributions to immediate and chronic IgE-associated allergic disorders and enhancing host resistance to certain venoms and parasites. However, mast cells have been proposed to influence many other biological processes, including responses to bacteria and virus, angiogenesis, wound healing, fibrosis, autoimmune and metabolic disorders, and cancer. The potential functions of mast cells in many of these settings is thought to reflect their ability to secrete, upon appropriate activation by a range of immune or non-immune stimuli, a broad spectrum of cytokines (including many chemokines) and growth factors, with potential autocrine, paracrine, local, and systemic effects. In this review, we summarize the evidence indicating which cytokines and growth factors can be produced by various populations of rodent and human mast cells in response to particular immune or non-immune stimuli, and comment on the proven or potential roles of such mast cell products in health and disease.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29431212\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC5813811\n\nAbstract\n\nDespite progress in single food oral immunotherapy, there is little evidence concerning the safety and efficacy of treating individuals with multiple food (multifood) allergies. We did a pilot study testing whether anti-IgE (omalizumab) combined with multifood oral immunotherapy benefited multifood allergic patients.We did a blinded, phase 2 clinical trial at Stanford University. We enrolled participants, aged 4-15 years, with multifood allergies validated by double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges to their offending foods. Inclusion criteria included a positive skin prick test of 6 mm or more (wheal diameter, above the negative control), a food-specific serum IgE concentration of more than 4 kU/L for each food, or both, and a positive double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge at 500 mg or less of food protein. Exclusion criteria included eosinophilic oesophagitis and severe asthma. Participants were randomised (3:1) with a block size of four, to receive multifood oral immunotherapy to two to five foods, together with omalizumab (n=36) or placebo (n=12). 12 individuals who fulfilled the same inclusion and exclusion criteria were included as controls. These individuals were not randomised and received neither omalizumab nor oral immunotherapy. Omalizumab or placebo was administered subcutaneously for 16 weeks, with oral immunotherapy starting at week 8, and was stopped 20 weeks before the exit double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge at week 36. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants who passed double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges to at least two of their offending foods. This completed trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02643862.Between March 25, 2015, and Aug 18, 2016, 165 participants were assessed for eligibility, of whom 84 did not meet the inclusion criteria and 21 declined to participate. We enrolled and randomised 48 eligible participants and the remaining 12 patients were included as nonrandomised, untreated controls. At week 36, a significantly greater proportion of the omalizumab-treated (30 [83%] of 36) versus placebo (four [33%] of 12) participants passed double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges to 2 g protein for two or more of their offending foods (odds ratio 10·0, 95% CI 1·8-58·3, p=0·0044). All participants completed the study. There were no serious or severe (grade 3 or worse) adverse events. Participants in the omalizumab group had a significantly lower median per-participant percentage of oral immunotherapy doses associated with any adverse events (27% vs 68%; p=0·0082). The most common adverse events in both groups were gastrointestinal events.In multifood allergic patients, omalizumab improves the efficacy of multifood oral immunotherapy and enables safe and rapid desensitisation.US National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nView details for PubMedID 29242014\n\nAbstract\n\nFood allergy (FA) prevalence has been increasing over the last few decades and is now a global health concern. Current diagnostic methods for FA result in a high number of false-positive results, and the standard of care is either allergen avoidance or use of epinephrine on accidental exposure, although currently with no other approved treatments. The increasing prevalence of FA, lack of robust biomarkers, and inadequate treatments warrants further research into the mechanism underlying food allergies. Recent technological advances have made it possible to move beyond traditional biological techniques to more sophisticated high-throughput approaches. These technologies have created the burgeoning field of omics sciences, which permit a more systematic investigation of biological problems. Omics sciences, such as genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, microbiomics, and exposomics, have enabled the construction of regulatory networks and biological pathway models. Parallel advances in bioinformatics and computational techniques have enabled the integration, analysis, and interpretation of these exponentially growing data sets and opens the possibility of personalized or precision medicine for FA.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29307411\n\nAbstract\n\nThirdhand smoke (THS) represents the accumulation of secondhand smoke on indoor surfaces and in dust, which, over time, can become more toxic than secondhand smoke. Although it is well known that children of smokers are at increased risk for asthma or asthma exacerbation if the disease is already present, how exposure to THS can influence the development or exacerbation of asthma remains unknown.We investigated whether epicutaneous exposure to an important component of THS, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), can influence asthma pathology in a mouse model elicited by means of repeated intranasal challenge with cockroach antigen (CRA).Wild-type mice, α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)- or mast cell (MC)-deficient mice, and mice with MCs that lacked α7 nAChRs or were the host's sole source of α7 nAChRs were subjected to epicutaneous NNK exposure, intranasal CRA challenge, or both, and the severity of features of asthma pathology, including airway hyperreactivity, airway inflammation, and airway remodeling, was assessed.We found that α7 nAChRs were required to observe adverse effects of epicutaneous NNK exposure on multiple features of CRA-induced asthma pathology. Moreover, MC expression of α7 nAChRs contributed significantly to the ability of epicutaneous NNK exposure to exacerbate airway hyperreactivity to methacholine, airway inflammation, and airway remodeling in this model.Our results show that skin exposure to NNK, a component of THS, can exacerbate multiple features of a CRA-induced model of asthma in mice and define MCs as key contributors to these adverse effects of NNK.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29678746\n\nAbstract\n\nCancer evolution is a step-wise non-linear process that may start early in life or later in adulthood, and includes pre-malignant (indolent) and malignant phases. Early somatic changes may not be detectable or are found by chance in apparently healthy individuals. The same lesions may be detected in pre-malignant clonal conditions. In some patients, these lesions may never become relevant clinically whereas in others, they act together with additional pro-oncogenic hits and thereby contribute to the formation of an overt malignancy. Although some pre-malignant stages of a malignancy have been characterized, no global system to define and to classify these conditions is available. To discuss open issues related to pre-malignant phases of neoplastic disorders, a working conference was organized in Vienna in August 2015. The outcomes of this conference are summarized herein and include a basic proposal for a nomenclature and classification of pre-malignant conditions. This proposal should assist in the communication among patients, physicians and scientists, which is critical as genome-sequencing will soon be offered widely for early cancer-detection.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ebiom.2017.11.024\n\nView details for PubMedID 29203377\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC5832623\n\nAbstract\n\nCompound exocytosis is considered the most massive mode of exocytosis, during which the membranes of secretory granules (SGs) fuse with each other to form a channel through which the entire contents of their granules is released. The underlying mechanisms of compound exocytosis remain largely unresolved. Here we show that the small GTPase Rab5, a known regulator of endocytosis, is pivotal for compound exocytosis in mast cells. Silencing of Rab5 shifts receptor-triggered secretion from a compound to a full exocytosis mode, in which SGs individually fuse with the plasma membrane. Moreover, we show that Rab5 is essential for FcεRI-triggered association of the SNARE protein SNAP23 with the SGs. Direct evidence is provided for SNAP23 involvement in homotypic SG fusion that occurs in the activated cells. Finally, we show that this fusion event is prevented by inhibition of the IKKβ2 kinase, however, neither a phosphorylation-deficient nor a phosphomimetic mutant of SNAP23 can mediate homotypic SG fusion in triggered cells. Taken together our findings identify Rab5 as a heretofore-unrecognized regulator of compound exocytosis that is essential for SNAP23-mediated granule-granule fusion. Our results also implicate phosphorylation cycles in controlling SNAP23 SNARE function in homotypic SG fusion.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29127297\n\nAbstract\n\nTLR ligands can promote Th1-biased immune responses, mimicking potent stimuli of viruses and bacteria.To investigate the adjuvant properties of dual TLR2/7 ligands compared to those of the mixture of both single ligands.Dual TLR2/7 ligands: CL401, CL413, and CL531, including CL264 (TLR7-ligand) and Pam2CysK4 (TLR2-ligand), were used. Immune-modulatory capacity of the dual ligands with the individual ligands alone or as a mixture in mouse BMmDCs, BMmDC:TC cocultures, or BMCMCs was compared and assessed in naïve mice and in a mouse model of OVA-induced intestinal allergy.CL413 and CL531 induced BMmDC-derived IL-10 secretion, suppressed rOVA-induced IL-5 secretion from OVA-specific DO11.10 CD4+ TCs, and induced proinflammatory cytokine secretion in vivo. In contrast, CL401 induced considerably less IL-10 secretion and led to IL-17A production in BMmDC:TC cocultures, but not BMCMC IL-6 secretion, or IL-6 or TNF-α production in vivo. No immune-modulating effects were observed with single ligands. All dual TLR2/7 ligands suppressed DNP-induced IgE-and-Ag-specific mast cell degranulation. Compared to vaccination with OVA, vaccination with the mixture CL531 and OVA, significantly suppressed OVA-specific IgE production in the intestinal allergy model.Based on beneficial immune-modulating properties, CL413 and CL531 may have utility as potential adjuvants for allergy treatment.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1155/2017/7983217\n\nView details for PubMedID 29204451\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC5674512\n\nAbstract\n\nGouty arthritis is caused by the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in joints. Despite many treatment options for gout, there is a substantial need for alternative treatments for patients unresponsive to current therapies. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have demonstrated therapeutic benefit in experimental models of antibody-dependent arthritis and in rheumatoid arthritis in humans, but to date, the potential effects of such inhibitors on gouty arthritis has not been evaluated. Here we demonstrate that treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (imatinib) can suppress inflammation induced by injection of MSU crystals into subcutaneous air pouches or into the ankle joint of wild type mice. Moreover, imatinib treatment also largely abolished the lower levels of inflammation which developed in IL-1R1-/- or KitW-sh/W-sh mice, indicating that this drug can inhibit IL-1-independent pathways, as well as mast cell-independent pathways, contributing to pathology in this model. Imatinib treatment not only prevented ankle swelling and synovial inflammation when administered before MSU crystals but also diminished these features when administrated after the injection of MSU crystals, a therapeutic protocol more closely mimicking the clinical situation in which treatment occurs after the development of an acute gout flare. Finally, we also assessed the efficiency of local intra-articular injections of imatinib-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles in this model of acute gout. Treatment with low doses of this long-acting imatinib:PLGA formulation was able to reduce ankle swelling in a therapeutic protocol. Altogether, these results raise the possibility that tyrosine kinase inhibitors might have utility in the treatment of acute gout in humans.\n\nView details for PubMedID 28982129\n\nAbstract\n\nContact hypersensitivity (CHS) is a common skin disease induced by epicutaneous sensitization to haptens. Conflicting results have been obtained regarding pathogenic versus protective roles of mast cells (MCs) in CHS, and this has been attributed in part to the limitations of certain models for studying MC functions in vivo. Here we describe a fluorescent imaging approach that enables in vivo selective labeling and tracking of MC secretory granules by real-time intravital 2-photon microscopy in living mice, and permits the identification of such MCs as a potential source of cytokines in different disease models. We show using this method that dermal MCs release their granules progressively into the surrounding microenvironment, but also represent an initial source of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10, during the early phase of severe CHS reactions. Finally, using 3 different types of MC-deficient mice, as well as mice in which IL-10 is ablated specifically in MCs, we show that IL-10 production by MCs can significantly limit the inflammation and tissue pathology observed in severe CHS reactions.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1172/jci.insight.92900\n\nView details for PubMedID 28469089\n\nAbstract\n\nThere is evidence that mast cells, basophils and IgE can contribute to immune responses to parasites, however, the relative importance of these effector elements in parasite immunity is not fully understood. Previous work in Il3-deficient and c-kit mutant Kit(W/W-v) mice indicated that interleukin-3 and c-Kit contribute to expulsion of the intestinal nematode Strongyloides venezuelensis (S.v.) during primary infection. Our findings in mast cell-deficient Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mice and two types of mast cell-deficient mice that have normal c-kit: \"Hello Kitty\" and MasTRECK mice, confirmed prior work in Kit(W/W-v) mice suggesting that mast cells play an important role in S.v. egg clearance in primary infections. We also assessed a possible contribution of basophils in immune responses to S.v By immunohistochemistry, we found that numbers of basophils and mast cells, were markedly increased in the jejunal mucosa during primary infections with S.v Studies in basophil-deficient Mcpt8(DTR) mice revealed a small but significant contribution of basophils to S.v. egg clearance in primary infections. Studies in mice deficient in various components of immune responses showed that CD4(+) T cells and ILC2 cells, IgG, FcRγ, and to a lesser extent, IgE and FcϵRI, contribute to effective immunity in primary S.v infections. These findings support the conclusion that the hierarchy of importance of immune effector mechanisms in primary S.v. infection is: CD4(+) T cells/ILC2 cells, IgG and FcRγ>mast cells>IgE and FcϵRI>basophils.

The food allergens tested were almond, egg, milk, sesame, peanut, pecan, walnut, hazelnut, cashew, pistachio, soy, and wheat.Our data demonstrate that of the reactions observed during a graded DBPCFC, gastrointestinal reactions occurred more often in boys than in girls, as well as in individuals with high levels of IgE to 2S albumins from cashew, walnut, and hazelnut. Certain food allergies often occurred concomitantly in individuals (ie, cashew/pistachio and walnut/pecan/hazelnut). IgE testing to components further corroborated serological relationships between and among these clustered food allergies.Associations of certain food allergies were shown by DBPCFC outcomes as well as by correlations in IgE reactivity to structurally related food allergen components. Each of these criteria independently demonstrated a significant association between allergies to cashew and pistachio, as well as among allergies to walnut, pecan, and hazelnut.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jaip.2017.01.016\n\nView details for PubMedID 28351786\n\nAbstract\n\nThere is evidence that mast cells, basophils and IgE can contribute to immune responses to parasites, however, the relative importance of these effector elements in parasite immunity is not fully understood.

The classification of the World Health Organization (WHO) divides the disease into cutaneous mastocytosis, systemic mastocytosis, and localized mast cell tumors. On the basis of histomorphologic criteria, clinical parameters, and organ involvement, systemic mastocytosis is further divided into indolent systemic mastocytosis and advanced systemic mastocytosis variants, including aggressive systemic mastocytosis and mast cell leukemia. The clinical impact and prognostic value of this classification has been confirmed in numerous studies, and its basic concept remains valid. However, refinements have recently been proposed by the consensus group, the WHO, and the European Competence Network on Mastocytosis. In addition, new treatment options are available for patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis, including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and multikinase inhibitors directed against KIT D816V and other key signaling molecules. Our current article provides an overview of recent advances in the field of mastocytosis, with emphasis on classification, prognostication, and emerging new treatment options in advanced systemic mastocytosis.

However, BAT protocols vary in blood anticoagulant used and temperature and time of storage before testing, complicating comparisons of results from various studies.We attempted to establish a BAT protocol that would permit analysis of blood within 24 hours of obtaining the sample.Blood from 46 healthy donors and 120 patients with peanut allergy was collected into EDTA or heparin tubes, and samples were stored at 4°C or room temperature for 4 or 24 hours before performing BATs.Stimulation with anti-IgE or IL-3 resulted in strong upregulation of basophil CD203c in samples collected in EDTA or heparin, stored at 4°C, and analyzed 24 hours after sample collection. However, a CD63(hi) population of basophils was not observed in any conditions in EDTA-treated samples unless exogenous calcium/magnesium was added at the time of anti-IgE stimulation. By contrast, blood samples collected in heparin tubes were adequate for quantification of upregulation of basophil CD203c and identification of a population of CD63(hi) basophils, irrespective of whether the specimens were analyzed by means of conventional flow cytometry or cytometry by time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and such tests could be performed after blood was stored for 24 hours at 4°C.BATs to measure upregulation of basophil CD203c and induction of a CD63(hi) basophil population can be conducted with blood obtained in heparin tubes and stored at 4°C for 24 hours.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jaci.2016.04.060\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000397295800022\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC5237629\n\nAbstract\n\nConflicting results have been obtained regarding the roles of Fc receptors and effector cells in models of active systemic anaphylaxis (ASA). In part, this might reflect the choice of adjuvant used during sensitization because various adjuvants might differentially influence the production of particular antibody isotypes.We developed an \"adjuvant-free\" mouse model of ASA and assessed the contributions of components of the \"classical\" and \"alternative\" pathways in this model.Mice were sensitized intraperitoneally with ovalbumin at weekly intervals for 6 weeks and challenged intraperitoneally with ovalbumin 2 weeks later.Wild-type animals had immediate hypothermia and late-phase intraperitoneal inflammation in this model. These features were reduced in mice lacking the IgE receptor FcεRI, the IgG receptor FcγRIII or the common γ-chain FcRγ. FcγRIV blockade resulted in a partial reduction of inflammation without any effect on hypothermia. Depletion of monocytes/macrophages with clodronate liposomes significantly reduced the hypothermia response. By contrast, depletion of neutrophils or basophils had no significant effects in this ASA model. Both the hypothermia and inflammation were dependent on platelet-activating factor and histamine and were reduced in 2 types of mast cell (MC)-deficient mice. Finally, engraftment of MC-deficient mice with bone marrow-derived cultured MCs significantly exacerbated the hypothermia response and restored inflammation to levels similar to those observed in wild-type mice.Components of the classical and alternative pathways contribute to anaphylaxis in this adjuvant-free model, with key roles for MCs and monocytes/macrophages.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jaci.2016.05.047\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000397002400024\n\nAbstract\n\nAnimal models have demonstrated that allergen-specific IgG confers sensitivity to systemic anaphylaxis that relies on IgG Fc receptors (FcγRs).

Anaphylaxis was evaluated in mice deficient for FcγRs injected with mediator antagonists or in which basophils, monocytes/macrophages, or neutrophils had been depleted. FcγR expression was evaluated on these cells before and after anaphylaxis.Activating FcγRIII is the receptor primarily responsible for all 3 models of anaphylaxis, and subsequent downregulation of this receptor was observed. These models differentially relied on histamine release and the contribution of mast cells, basophils, macrophages, and neutrophils. Strikingly, basophil contribution and histamine predominance in mice with IgG1- and IgG2b-induced anaphylaxis correlated with the ability of inhibitory FcγRIIB to negatively regulate these models of anaphylaxis.We propose that the differential expression of inhibitory FcγRIIB on myeloid cells and its differential binding of IgG subclasses controls the contributions of mast cells, basophils, neutrophils, and macrophages to IgG subclass-dependent anaphylaxis.

Because it can be triggered in some persons by minute amounts of antigen (eg, certain foods or single insect stings), anaphylaxis can be considered the most aberrant example of an imbalance between the cost and benefit of an immune response. This review will describe current understanding of the immunopathogenesis and pathophysiology of anaphylaxis, focusing on the roles of IgE and IgG antibodies, immune effector cells, and mediators thought to contribute to examples of the disorder. Evidence from studies of anaphylaxis in human subjects will be discussed, as well as insights gained from analyses of animal models, including mice genetically deficient in the antibodies, antibody receptors, effector cells, or mediators implicated in anaphylaxis and mice that have been \"humanized\" for some of these elements. We also review possible host factors that might influence the occurrence or severity of anaphylaxis. Finally, we will speculate about anaphylaxis from an evolutionary perspective and argue that, in the context of severe envenomation by arthropods or reptiles, anaphylaxis might even provide a survival advantage.\n\nView details for PubMedID 28780941\n\nAbstract\n\nAnimal models have demonstrated that allergen-specific IgG confers sensitivity to systemic anaphylaxis that relies on IgG Fc receptors (FcγRs).

Collectively, our results unravel novel complexities in the involvement and regulation of cell populations in IgG-dependent reactions in vivo.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jaci.2016.03.028\n\nView details for PubMedID 27246523\n\nAbstract\n\nEpidermal keratinocytes form a structural and immune barrier that is essential for skin homeostasis.
