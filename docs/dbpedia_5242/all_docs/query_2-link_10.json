He published about 160 peer-reviewed journal papers on remote sensing and applied electromagnetics.\n\nDISTINGUISHED LECTURER TOPICS:\n\nSynthetic Aperture Radar for oil spill observation\n\nMarine oil pollution monitoring is a topic of great applicative and scientific relevance. Use of remotely sensed measurements is of special interest and, in particular, the SAR because of its almost all-weather and all-day imaging capability at fine spatial resolution is the most effective tool. Conventional single-polarization SAR oil spill monitoring techniques are limited in their capability to detect oil slicks since they strongly rely on suitable thresholds, training samples, and ancillary information. Hence, an expert image analyst is due. The launch of a number of polarimetric SAR missions, along with the understanding of the peculiar physical mechanisms governing the scattering by an oil slick, led to a new paradigm (known as physical processing) that fostered a set of polarimetric algorithms particularly robust and efficient. Hence, suitable polarimetric models that exploit the departure from the slick-free sea Bragg scattering have been developed to effectively address oil slick monitoring. A set of polarimetric features extracted following such electromagnetic models have been proved to be reliable for oil slick monitoring. Polarimetric SAR observations led to a significant improvement in sea oil slick observation since they allow distinguishing oil slicks from a broad class of lookalikes in an unsupervised way.\n\nWind speed estimation by Synthetic Aperture Radar\n\nThe oceans cover over 70% of the Earth’s surface, carrying out about 50% of global primary production and hosting the widest biodiversity on the planet. Ocean monitoring plays a key role in all World Meteorological Organization (WMO) programs. Within such a framework, sea-surface wind field is attracting growing attention from engineers and in order to boost the sustainable development by exploiting new “clean” energy sources (e.g., to plan and implement offshore wind energy farms). In this seminar the SAR, a microwave narrowband coherent imaging system, is analyzed as sensor for sea surface wind estimation.\n\nThe critical analysis of three general procedures is presented along with a physical background.\n\nMan-made targets at sea observation by polarimetric SAR\n\nSea man-made targets usually appear as bright spots over a dark background, this is due to some concurring physical factor: the large size of the target compared to the SAR spatial resolution, the metallic nature of the target that ensures a strong electromagnetic return and a low return of the sea surface that occurs in low-to-moderate wind regimes. When some of the aforementioned physical hypothesis do not occur the detection of man-made targets becomes a much more challenging task. In the seminar a physical-driven approach is presented along with a number of examples. In this seminar the supporting role of SAR polarimetry and physical processing for man-made target at sea detection is illustrated.\n\nTamaki Ura is Professor Emeritus of the University of Tokyo, where he is a world leader in the development of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles.\n\nHe has developed various types of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and related application technologies including navigation methods, a new sensing method using a chemical sensor, precise seafloor mapping methods, a precise seabed positioning system with a resolution of a few centimeters, a new sensing system of the thickness of cobalt-rich crust; and more.

Hines was born and raised in Glace Bay, Cape Breton. From 1977-1981 he attended Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, graduating with a B.Sc. (Hon) in Engineering-Physics.\n\nHe joined the Defence Research Establishment Atlantic (now Defence R&D Canada – Atlantic), Dartmouth, Canada where he researched towed array self-noise. From 1985-1988, he attended the University of Bath, UK where he received his PhD in Physics. His research on acoustic scattering from ocean boundaries earned him the Chesterman Medal from the University for “Outstanding Research in Physics”. Upon returning to DRDC Atlantic in 1989, he joined the Acoustic Countermeasures group to work on acoustic scattering and time spreading. From 1996 until 2003 he led several research groups that focused on experimentation and modeling to support sonar research. Since 2003 he has managed projects in Rapid Environmental Acoustics and Aural Classification for underwater acoustics and is currently Principal Scientist in the Underwater Sensing section at DRDC.\n\nDr. Hines is a Fellow of the Acoustical Society of America, a member of IEEE, and an Adjunct Professor at Dalhousie University’s Dept. of Graduate Studies. He is a seasoned experimentalist and has been chief scientist for several collaborative international research trials. His present research interests include acoustic scattering, sound speed dispersion in the seabed, vector sensor processing, and the application of aural perception in humans, to target classification in sonar.\n\nLecture topics:\n\n1. The application of aural perception in humans to active and passive sonar classification.\n\nHumans have a remarkable ability to aurally classify transient acoustic signals – from a dog’s bark to the slamming of a car door. Sonar experts have always relied to some extent on this ability to aurally classify sounds to assist in identification – this includes active sonars, in which an acoustic wave is transmitted and one listens to the received echo from a target, such as a submarine, and passive sonars in which one simply listens for signals of interest, such as a marine mammal call. This begs the questions, “How do humans discriminate between these sounds and can we develop a computer algorithm to do it?” In this presentation, we examine those questions, and present some rather pleasing results from an automatic aural classifier that was applied to active sonar target classification and to passive classification of marine mammal vocalizations.\n\n2. Vector sensors: Over 40 and Still Hot (a Hot Topics lecture given at the 151st Meeting of the Acoustical Society of America)\n\nAcoustic vector sensors and gradient arrays have been in use in underwater acoustics for more than 4 decades so one may wonder why they might be considered a “Hot Topic”. The reason lies in the recent resurgence in their use. This in turn, is due primarily to major advances in engineering and signal processing that have been applied to these devices. Historically, theoretical gains have been difficult to achieve with these sensors due to their susceptibility to uncorrelated noise. That is to say, the very process of making a localized measurement of the vector acoustic field lowers the signal-to-noise ratio, relative to a simple pressure measurement. However, with today’s advances in design, manufacturing, and digital signal processing, high-quality performance can be achieved in a very small package size. Moreover, the current interest in these devices isn’t limited to underwater acoustic applications; rather it extends across a number of technical areas within the acoustics community. This presentation will begin with a gentle introduction to the theoretical foundation and history of these devices. Then some current applications in both underwater and airborne acoustics will be highlighted."
