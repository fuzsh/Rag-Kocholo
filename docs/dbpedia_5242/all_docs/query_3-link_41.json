        "text": "Discussion\n\nThis report examined worldwide data from 909 institutions in 108 countries to investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the volume of diagnostic cardiovascular procedures performed in the U.S. and non-U.S. facilities and to determine factors associated with volume reduction in U.S. facilities. We found that volume reductions were generally similar between U.S. and non-U.S. facilities for all diagnostic procedures apart from ICA, in which the U.S. experienced greater declines (69% vs. 53%, respectively; p < 0.001). Conversely, we observed significant differences between U.S. regions, with the greatest declines seen in the Northeast and Midwest for nearly every type of cardiovascular test. Factors statistically correlated with greater reduction in volumes in a multivariable analysis included COVID-19 prevalence, staff redeployments, outpatient centers, and urban centers.\n\nThe impact of the pandemic on worldwide CVD morbidity and mortality is an area of growing concern. Already, multiple reports have described worrisome declines in the rates of percutaneous revascularization procedures for ACS. Garcia et al. (18) evaluated 9 high-volume cardiac catheterization facilities in the United States and found that laboratory activations for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI) declined from baseline values by 38% at the end of March 2020. This decrease was similar to reductions in STEMI activations reported in separate studies from Spain (40%) (16) and Italy (33%) (15). One possible explanation could be increased usage of noninvasive management pathways for ACS. However, studies have shown that, in fact, overall hospitalizations for ACS have also declined by a similar percentage (13,14). Mafham et al. (13) evaluated hospital admission data in England and found that admissions for ACS in March 2020 had declined by 40% (13). Our data also showed reductions in ICA volumes of 40% in U.S. facilities and 43% in non-U.S. facilities at the end of March 2020, similar to those in previous studies. However, in April 2020, we observed even greater worldwide declines in ICA procedures, with a significantly greater reduction in U.S. centers than in non-U.S. centers (69% vs. 53%, respectively; p < 0.001).\n\nThe greater reduction of ICA procedures in U.S. facilities could relate to several factors, including the rapid rise in COVID-19 cases in the U.S. during March and April of 2020. New York City was widely considered to be one of the epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic in April (34). Thus, it is not surprising that our data also revealed significant differences in volume reductions between U.S. regions, with a nearly 2-fold greater decline in ICA procedures in the Northeast than in the West (77% vs. 41%, respectively; p <0.001). These declines are unlikely due to a true decrease in the incidence of ACS. In fact, Kwong et al. (35) showed that the risk of acute myocardial infarction was approximately 3 to 6 times higher in the first 7 days of viral respiratory infection. A more alarming, and more likely, alternative is the decline in emergency room visits for chest pain due to the reluctance of patients to seek medical attention during the pandemic. A recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that, during the early phase of the pandemic, emergency room visits for chest pain decreased by 24,258 visits per week across the United States compared to the same period in 2019, whereas visits for acute myocardial infarction declined by 1,156 per week, suggesting that delayed care in these cases might have resulted in “additional mortality” (36). Similar declines in emergency room presentations have been described for acute stroke (37,38), acute surgical complaints (4,39), and even emergency mental health services (40), which are largely believed to be the result of decreased usage of health care services generally during the pandemic, rather than the decreased incidence of non-COVID-19 illnesses. Although the reported declines in hospital presentations and procedures for ACS are a major cause for concern, additional data are urgently needed to better establish the direct impact of these findings on the morbidity and mortality of CVD around the world.\n\nIn addition to reductions in ICA procedures, we found that rates of noninvasive cardiovascular procedures also fell sharply during the early pandemic. It is possible that declines in worldwide cardiovascular testing might have curtailed transmission of COVID-19 while permitting an increase in hospital capacity and a decrease in inappropriate testing (41). However, it may also signify a potential looming global health crisis from the millions of CVD diagnoses that could be missed during the pandemic. Overall, declines in noninvasive cardiovascular procedure volumes were similar for U.S. and non-U.S. laboratories (68% vs. 64% reported declines; p = 0.118), which is more likely explained by offsetting procedure volume reductions in non-U.S. regions than a true resemblance between U.S. and non-U.S. centers. For example, our international report showed that regions beyond the peak of transmission in April 2020 (e.g., Far East and South East Asia) reported the lowest reductions in volume of procedures, whereas regions at the peak or in the early stages of community transmission during the same time period (e.g., Europe and South America, respectively) reported greater reductions in volumes (12).\n\nVariable rates of reductions in procedure volumes for each modality also suggests that factors other than restricted access during the pandemic likely impacted the relative reductions observed. For example, declines in TEE volumes were generally greater than other modalities, likely due to fears of aerosolization with endotracheal intubation. We also found that most U.S. and non-U.S. facilities implemented policies to avoid aerosol-generating exercise stress tests in favor of pharmacologic stress tests while optimizing protocols to shorten patient-staff contact time (e.g., reduced acquisition times and use of stress-first protocols). Consequently, both U.S. and non-U.S. facilities reported greater reductions in stress ECG and stress echocardiography than nuclear stress tests, where image acquisition can be performed at a distance by using pharmacologic stress agents. Reductions in CCTA were also lower than exercise stress tests, raising the possibility that facilities could have used alternative nonstress modalities to diagnose CAD.\n\nIn contrast, there were significant differences in reductions of procedure volumes reported among U.S. regions, with greater declines generally observed in the Northeast and Midwest. This difference did not emerge until April 2020 when declines in procedure volumes in the Northeast and Midwest outpaced declines in the South and West. We found that facilities operating in counties with a greater prevalence of COVID-19 in April of 2020 reported greater reductions in cardiovascular testing (p = 0.011). This was likely due to the mounting effects of the pandemic in these areas, which led to the abrupt cessation of elective procedures and the suspension of many outpatient medical practices (42,43). Consequently, our analysis revealed that classification as an outpatient practice was also associated with a 12.5% greater reduction in volumes of diagnostic procedures (p < 0.001). A common practice in the most affected areas of the pandemic has been to redeploy medical staff to accommodate surges in the number of hospitalized patients (44). In our study, redeployment of imaging staff was associated with an 11.5% greater overall procedure volume reduction, independent of the COVID-19 prevalence in the surrounding area (p < 0.001). However, whether redeployments were the direct cause of procedure volume reductions or a consequence of reductions during the early pandemic (e.g., redeployments to reduce overhead) is unknown. Although health care systems must prioritize provision of resources to maintain flexibility and scalability during the pandemic, further examination of the potential adverse consequences of such strategies (i.e., decreased availability of essential health care services) and the development of approaches to mitigate them in the future are warranted. Additionally, despite the divisive politicization surrounding the U.S. response to the COVID-19 pandemic (45) factors associated with U.S. political alignment (i.e., the political party affiliation of the current governor and whether the state electoral college voted for the Republican or Democratic nominee in the 2016 presidential election) were also not significantly associated with procedure volume reduction in a multivariable analysis.\n\nFinally, population density has been shown in some studies to be an important factor in both the incidence and death rates resulting from COVID-19 infection (46, 47, 48). We found that facilities located in urban counties with a metropolitan population of >1 million had 9.7% fewer procedures than facilities in more rural counties (p = 0.003). Although the reason for this is not entirely apparent, it could signify the existence of disparities in access to cardiovascular testing during the pandemic. Major health inequities related to COVID-19 have already been described, with black populations experiencing greater rates of infection, hospitalizations, and even deaths in some studies (49, 50, 51). At baseline, black patients in the United States have disproportionately higher morbidity and mortality from CVD and are less likely to receive the same standards of cardiovascular care as nonminority patients (52). Minority populations are also overrepresented in urban communities (53), raising the possibility that minority groups could be more affected by the greater declines in diagnostic cardiac procedures seen in more densely populated counties. Variables accounting for racial and economic differences were not significant in our analysis; however, this study was not designed to detect discrepancies in these characteristics (e.g., county-level data do not fully reflect the demographic characteristics of the neighborhood served by an individual institution, and study participants did not provide patient demographic data associated with their procedure volumes). Nonetheless, communities and individual laboratories should be aware of possible disparities in access to cardiovascular testing that affect the communities most in need of these essential services during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThis study has several limitations. First, U.S. regional participation in the INCAPS-COVID study was variable, and data collection is prone to potential biases (e.g., volunteer bias or sampling bias). Thus, the extent to which regional data are representative of the true regional changes in cardiovascular testing is unknown. Additionally, facilities that participated in the survey may not represent the exact distribution of facilities that perform diagnostic cardiac imaging in the community (e.g., only 35% of non-U.S. facilities reported procedure volume data for TTE, a commonly used imaging modality), and the specialty of the survey respondent may have affected the mixture of procedures reported (e.g., nuclear medicine physicians may only report nuclear procedures rather than procedures for the entire department or practice). Nevertheless, the INCAPS-COVID registry constitutes a diverse group of diagnostic facilities representing a broad range of clinical practice settings in each world region. Furthermore, our regression analysis was limited by the granularity of U.S. COVID-19 data, which at the time of this writing, were available only at the county level in most U.S. states. Ideally, a smaller geographical unit of measurement (e.g., census tract) would better reflect the demographic characteristics of the community served by each individual U.S. imaging center. Still, county-level data were sufficient to account for a great degree of variability in our model and enabled us to identify variables significantly associated with U.S. procedure volume reduction. Finally, our results reflect only the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the collection of INCAPS-COVID data, institutional and governmental strategies related to the delivery of health care have likely changed, and shifts in diagnostic cardiac testing during the second and third waves of the pandemic remains unknown. In view of this, the INCAPS-COVID Investigators Group is planning to reconvene for additional data collection in early 2021, which is expected to provide additional insights into ongoing changes in worldwide diagnostic cardiovascular testing throughout the COVID-19 pandemic."
