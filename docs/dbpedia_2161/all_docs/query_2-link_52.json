        "text": "It is with deep sorrow and profound love that we share the passing on January 17, 2023 of our dear friend John Wright. John was our lobbyist and cherished advisor. John founded The Wright Group NY in 2010, one of the first Black-owned government relations firms in New York. The firm’s clients range from some of New York’s largest cultural institutions to smaller non-profits that serve some of the City’s most underinvested communities. John took enormous pride in the numerous legislative advancements he and The Wright Group NY were instrumental in achieving. What John created was fundamentally unique and grounded in his vision to support New York’s communities and causes that too often are rendered voiceless. John built a firm and brought together a community of those connected by their efforts and commitment to advance justice and equality. John believed that meaningful transformative change could only be achieved when the City’s most marginalized have access to influence and become decision-makers in every aspect of government. He empowered those advocating for equitable solutions to advance systemic change by supporting clients and coalitions and guiding leaders and youth alike. John served as a board member for numerous non-profits, including Harlem United and the Brooklyn Community Foundation. He inspired and mentored so many with his compassion and steadfast dedication to justice and equality.\n\nJohn moved through the world with a commanding presence and power. But it was a power not through dominance, but through service and understanding. He was a colorful, spirited, and complex person who was widely respected for not just what he did, but for who he was and how he did it. His inquisitiveness, humility, and thirst for knowledge meant that he was always learning. And John’s openness about his journey and pursuit of personal betterment and healing illustrated the integrity with which he lived his life. John was known for his deep and lasting relationships, brilliant strategic mind, infectious laugh, and his generous and compassionate spirit. He created meaningful connections with each person with whom he interacted and served as a bridge between people, communities, and spaces where he saw synergy, often before others could.\n\nJohn is survived by his mother Claudia, his partner Regina Woods, his three sons Caleb, Elijah and Jaylin, ex-wife and mother to Caleb and Elijah, Tracie M. Gardner, and several aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces and nephews."
