        "text": "Friday (not money media) Review: \"The Missing Fruit\" dance performance Usually on Fridays I write a review of a book, podcast, or other media about personal finance. Today I'm writing about dance. Read to the end - you'll see the connection. This past weekend I went to the Kaatsbaan Cultural Park on the Hudson Valley in New York to see my daughter (who's a professional contemporary dancer) perform in Roderick George's \"The Missing Fruit.\" It's a mesmerizing, startling piece. As a review in Dance Enthusiast says, the piece \"unflinchingly probes the repercussions of historical trauma and the persistence of oppression experienced by people of color.\" (See link to the review in the comments). All eight dancers, including the choreographer, are mind-blowing. I could go on and on about the brilliance of every aspect of the piece - the technical prowess, the artistry, the music, the message - but I want to focus on one thing. At one point the dancing comes to a shocking stop at the sound of a gunshot. George falls to the floor, the spotlight shining on him. And he stays there. And stays and stays. Audience members were told prior to the performance that there would be an 8 minute break. After a minute or two of watching him lying on the floor, we started to look at each other and murmur. Is this the break? What do we do? Should we leave our seats? Is it okay to talk or should we sit in silence? It made us uncomfortable. As we should be. Violence and oppression are happening all around us. What are we doing? Are we bystanders? Do we look the other way? Are we taking any action? This made me think about all aspects of my life. What am I doing to make change? To leave the world a better place? With my actions. And with my money. Money is connected to most other aspects of our lives. If we have some to give, we can use it to help. And if you EVER have the chance to see Roderick George and the kNoname Artist dance company, jump on it. He's a rising star and you will be moved, mesmerized, and made to think. #contemporarydance #dance #themissingfruit #personalfinance #makingadifference #giving\n\nSorry to break it to you, but Ryan Reynolds isn't doing the full 'Bye Bye Bye' dance in 'Deadpool & Wolverine' https://ift.tt/N6K9zo5 Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson/Deadpool in \"Deadpool & Wolverine.\" 20th Century Studios/Marvel Studios \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" opens with a fight sequence set to *NSYNC's \"Bye Bye Bye.\" Most of the choreography is performed by a dance double named Nick Pauley, who's credited as Dancepool. \"If it looks like the person who's dancing doesn't have arthritis, that's him,\" Reynolds said of Pauley. Warning: Major spoilers ahead for \"Deadpool & Wolverine.\" Ryan Reynolds is many things — actor, producer, writer, and entrepreneur. But busting out *NSYNC choreography isn't his strong suit. \"Deadpool & Wolverine,\" the third installment of the \"Deadpool\" franchise, costars Reynolds as Wade Wilson/Deadpool and Hugh Jackman as Logan/Wolverine. Before the two characters join forces for an epic team-up, Deadpool goes to North Dakota to dig up the grave of Logan, who died in the third stand-alone Wolverine film \"Logan.\" When soldiers from the Time Variance Authority (TVA) catch up to Deadpool, a gory battle ensues and the merc fights them with the help of Logan's adamantium skeleton. The fight sequence is set to *NSYNC's \"Bye Bye Bye,\" with Deadpool performing Darrin Henson's iconic choreography while fending off the soldiers. Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson/Deadpool in \"Deadpool & Wolverine.\" 20th Century Studios/Marvel Studios In reality, Reynolds had a lot of help from dancer Nick Pauley, who's credited as Dancepool. Reynolds named Pauley as his dance double in a recent \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" press conference attended by Business Insider. \"A guy named Nick Pauley is the guy that choreographed it,\" Reynolds said. \"I mean, he's doing a lot of the moves that have been established previously by *NSYNC. If it looks like the person who's dancing doesn't have arthritis, that's him.\" Deadpool and a TVA soldier in \"Deadpool & Wolverine.\" Marvel Studios Reynolds said that he was able to execute some of the moves, but with less ease than the dancer. \"And then there's the moments where there's a bit of a pop and lock, except the pop really pops, like it cracks, and the lock will not unlock,\" Reynolds said, adding that most of the credit goes to Pauley. \"I will hang my hat on his talent there and thank him for his contribution and services.\" View this post on Instagram A post shared by Nick Pauley (@nickfpauley) Following the release of \"Deadpool & Wolverine,\" Pauley shared a photo of himself wearing the Deadpool costume and another image at the film's premiere in New York City. \"Watching the footage back was pretty surreal. I hadn't remembered what I freestyled in between the choreography, and it was hilarious to watch it back and be like 'oh my god now I remember doing that,'\" Pauley wrote in his Instagram caption. \"When filming, I felt right at home. @vancityreynolds and @slevydirect - thank you for your en...\n\nNotes from the rehearsal room A few years ago, I was devising a performance that brought a movement artist, a physical theatre practitioner and an actor together. We were figuring out ways to bring to life, an origin story (of the Sky Woman) Sky woman falls from the Sky world into the water world and her fall is stalled by a flock of geese. This is all we need to know for now. How do three performers get together to create a moving visual for this? We devise a movement, a wing flap of sorts and I figure that I want the three of them to perform that movement, exactly, together, in the same way. The very kind performers agree and we rehearse it, over and over. It still does not feel right! The illusion of the birds is not happening for me. Neither for them. My conditioning of watching choreographed sequences, where everyone does the same thing was playing out. Getting it right. Getting it perfectly right was my obsession at that point. After rehearsing it for days, it still did not feel right. I decided to invite a dancer/choreographer to help me get it right. The choreographer observes The performers do The director (me) is anxious I ask the choreographer: What do you think? He responds: Why are they trying to do the same thing when they're all so different? ⚡ Simple question. A profound realisation ⚡ Why did I want diversity to function like similarity? Their body types, their practices, their aesthetics, their physicality, their entry points into the work, their height, their gender - everything was different And here I was making them a happy assembly line of flocking geese! That moment & that one question changed so much for me as a theatre maker and as a DEIB facilitator. Result: Geese, different from one another. Some visual, some aural, some large, some moving, some static - And still, Sky woman's fall was stalled gracefully, the audience stayed glued to the story. The performers felt seen and valued. The story came alive. I had an AHA moment that was transformative \"You need not all do the same things Even if you did, it'll all be different\" With our teams in the workplace, do we have the same expectations out of completely different people? Each with their unique approaches? How do you consciously enable diversity to thrive? Would love to hear your experiences Breath Beings #diversityandinclusion #creativedirection #growthmindset #theatrelife\n\nHello, creative minds and dance lovers alike! 🎥💃🎵 As we dive into the intricate art of creating a mesmerizing musical number, let's take a moment to celebrate a crucial but often overlooked collaborator in this process - the Editor. In the dance of film creation, the Editor is our rhythm keeper, the one who ensures that each movement, each beat, each note aligns seamlessly to tell a coherent, captivating story. And when it comes to musical numbers, their role becomes all the more critical. An inexperienced editor can unintentionally disrupt the flow of a musical number by cutting away from the rhythm, choosing an ill-timed close-up over a wide shot, or making similar missteps. Such decisions can detract from the power of the performance, disconnecting the audience from the narrative that the dance seeks to express. So, how can we prevent these missteps? The answer lies in fostering a close collaboration between the Editor and the Choreographer. The choreographer, having designed the dance, understands the story, the rhythm, and the intent behind each movement. By consulting with the choreographer during the editing process, the editor can ensure that the rhythm of the cuts complements the rhythm of the dance, and the story told through the dance is preserved in the final cut. 🎬🎞️ This collaboration is the key to producing a compelling musical number. The choreographer's vision, brought to life by the dancers and captured through the lens, is finally given its full expression through the editor's careful, rhythmically attuned cuts. So, here's to the unsung heroes of musical numbers - the Editors, and to the magic that happens when choreography and editing dance in harmony. It's a reminder that every step of film creation, from the first dance rehearsal to the final edit, plays a vital role in creating something truly remarkable. Stay tuned as we continue exploring the art and craft behind the scenes of your favorite musical numbers! #EditingMagic #ChoreographyAndFilm #BehindTheScenes #MusicalNumberCreation\n\n🚫 What’s your NO Manifesto? 🚫 In 2012, I was introduced to Yvonne Rainer and her work. She is a dancer, choreographer & film maker. Her work can be called minimalist and experimental. She wrote the No Manifesto in 1965, challenging the art world to strip the frills and be, without pretence, without gimmicks and without spectacle. Here’s the manifesto Rainer’s NO Manifesto No to spectacle. No to virtuosity. No to transformations and magic and make-believe. No to the glamour and transcendency of the star image. No to the heroic. No to the anti-heroic. No to trash imagery. No to involvement of performer or spectator. No to style. No to camp. No to seduction of spectator by the wiles of the performer. No to eccentricity. No to moving or being moved. As a theatre maker, when I read the first line, \"NO to Spectacle\" I was uncomfortable. I wanted to stop reading, But I persisted. I stayed with her Manifesto, and tried to embrace it, in my own way. And then I asked myself “Hey, that’s Yvonne’s No Manifesto! What’s yours?” After that, in every theatre performance and workshop that I facilitated, I nudged the team to come up with a collective NO manifesto and a YES Manifesto. While applying it to everyday work and life, the NO manifesto can be a powerful reminder of the things that you’ll keep telling yourself YOU won’t do. Working in the DEIB space, I nudge leaders to think of their NO manifesto as well Here’s my NO Manifesto NO to hate and violence NO to manipulation NO to negative judgement NO to belittling NO to Abuse NO to Toxicity NO to a single narrative NO to sexism NO to pretence NO to pleasing people NO to … NO to … And every time I write this manifesto, it changes, it evolves, it keeps growing. I also add a YES manifesto to this after I write the NO's. Do I live upto the NO manifesto all the time? I try. I fail. I succeed. But I know that I have failed and I try again to be a better being, one breath at a time. 🚫 What’s your NO Manifesto? 🔒 Do share Image: No to shying away from putting myself out there!!

You might find me juggling reports like a circus performer, tweaking campaigns like a maestro, and... oh, is that my fifth cup of tea today? ☕️🎪 We all know the scene—spreadsheets in one hand, a never-ending to-do list in the other, and a tea mug that might as well be attached to our palm. But amid this caffeinated chaos, there’s an art. Here's the grind-down: 1- Reporting Rumba: Dance through those numbers. Each stat tells a story, each figure is a step in your growth dance. 💃📊 2- Optimization Opera: Hit the high notes by fine-tuning those campaigns. Every tweak is a note that can turn a campaign from a jingle to a symphony. 🎶📈 3- Caffeine Choreography: Too much tea can jitter your strategy. Balance is key. Swap a cup for water or a walk—keep the mind alert and the ideas flowing. 🚶💡 Let's raise our mugs to the end-of-quarter hustle.\n\nWeekend READ📰: Breaking into 🕺dance or break dancing, either way my fav of these classic dance scenes is the one with Travolta, and yours? Annie --- Because people may cheat, steal, and kill, but their hips don't lie. Anyone who knows me well can tell you two things. One, I like crime fiction in all its forms. Two, I like it when the characters in those crime fictions break into some kind of dance. Ideally, the dance will be exuberant, revelatory, and/or deeply unsettling, but really I’ll take just about anything where the hips get loose. Noir sometimes gets a bum wrap as a bleak and forlorn corner of the cultural world, and it’s true, there are some horrible things out there, but there’s also a dark, subversive wit running through the genre that’s always been part and parcel of its appeal. That’s my position, anyway. There’s also something so thoroughly efficient about a dance, something that can capture an entire life in a few deft movements. I’m thinking Bacall’s shimmy in To Have and Have Not, or Ilsa and Rick pressing cheeks in the final days of a free Paris—those moments that run an uncanny shiver down your spine. In the interest of pursuing passions to their logical ends, I’ve collected here twelve of my favorite moments in the history of crime and dance. Some are composed of a few steps, others are full-blown choreographed routines. All are strange and wondrous to behold. ...READ Article... #movies #filmnoir #crime #dancing #film #entertainment Hon.\n\nLet's talk about creativity and the creative process. I have two friends, one a writer and the other a choreographer, who tell me that their creative process is like the attached photo, too! The choreographer will dream all day long and get ideas for pieces just about anywhere. But when she is in the studio, the music is playing, and she has hours to spend on movement, she will often freeze. Same thing with my writer friend. Beautiful sentences come to her fully formed when she's making dinner. But present her with an empty page, and all those words fly away. They are both professionals and get paid for their creative work, so obviously, they don't stay stuck. But still, talking to them and thinking about my own creative process in design has me wondering about those frozen moments. First, why do those 'deer in the headlights' moments happen for most people across all creative endeavors? And second, what do you do to get out of your own way when you're stuck? My choreographer friend, for example, puts on really silly/high-energy music and gyrates around ridiculously until she makes herself laugh. Apparently, 'Hey, Mickey!' and 'Walking on Sunshine' are favorites for this exercise. Once she is collapsed in a puddle on the floor giggling, she can choreograph. So, back to my two questions: why do you think this phenomenon happens, and what do you do to get unstuck? #design #creativity #creativeprocess #inspiration\n\nCharacters' journeys are the heart of any musical sequence. Let's dive into how choreography can breathe life into these narratives. 🩰🎭 #CharacterJourney #MusicalChoreography In a fleeting 10-second clip, a whole world can be conveyed - the hopes, the struggles, the triumphs of a character. This is the power of choreography in a musical sequence. 🎥🎶 As choreographers, our role extends beyond designing dance moves. We are storytellers, responsible for moving the character's journey forward, infusing each step, each twirl with meaning and purpose. The character's journey is not a side note in the musical number; it's the very essence of it. Every beat, every rhythm should echo their emotions, mirror their experiences, and propel their story forward. It's about capturing the nuances of their transformation and expressing it through movement. What does this journey mean for the musical number? How does it shape the choreography? These questions guide our creative process, influencing everything from the choice of dance style to the design of specific movements. So, the next time you watch a musical sequence, look beyond the spectacle. Observe how the dance unfolds the character's journey, how each movement narrates a piece of their story. That's the true magic of choreography, the art of telling stories through movement. 🌟 Stay tuned for more insights into the world of choreography! #CharacterJourney #MusicalChoreography #StorytellingThroughDance #BehindTheScenes\n\nImage Source : Govinda’s son Yashvardhan is very handsome Apart from his comic timing, Govinda is also famous for his dance.
