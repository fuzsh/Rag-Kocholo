        "text": "If anything is a guarantee in the music business it’s change.\n\nJust ask Lady Gaga.\n\nDespite being less than a decade into superstardom, the 30-year-old has experienced several career twists and turns.\n\nTwo of the more notable center on management and creative.\n\nIndeed, as pertains to the latter, many were surprised when Mother Monster parted ways with longtime creative director and choreographer Laurieann Gibson (pictured above). The timing, just after ‘Born This Way,’ was sudden and left fans worried given how integral at-the-time Gibson was to all things “Gaga.”\n\nRenown for her colorful personality and “Boom Kack” catchphrase, Gibson was replaced by Richy Jackson – a dancer/choreographer who served as her #2.\n\nSome have speculated that this has been a perpetual thorn in her side ever since.\n\nAnd while only she knows the validity of that, her movements on Twitter have added fuel to the flames.\n\nSee what we mean below…\n\nFollowing yesterday’s behind the scenes look at the choreography for Gaga’s Super Bowl Halftime Show, a fan tweeted the following message to the singer, Gibson, and Richy. A message Gibson retweeted:\n\nWhen confronted by fans about the cattiness of the RT, Gibson insisted there was “no no no shade” being thrown. She said:\n\nnever negative grateful for the vision people have the love if you see negative thts not it be mindful ️\n\nRight…\n\n************\n\nNo number of emojis and zen like statement can conceal the shade. It’s there in abundance.\n\nSaying that, it’s a tad tricky because while it’s easy to scream “be better, not bitter” (which is true), Gibson did indeed champion much of the classic choreography Gaga is known for. Something the clip below attributes to another person.\n\nStill, regardless of how irked she is, professionalism is all about keeping it light, bright, and moving with a permanent ‘Pokerface.’ Pun intended.\n\nSo, whether right in reason or not, Laurieann kinda played herself on this one.\n\nLady Gaga takes to the stage at the PEPSI Super Bowl Halftime Show on February 5th.\n\nYour thoughts?"
