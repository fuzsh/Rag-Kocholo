        "text": "ROBERT A. CELESTIN, ESQ.\n\nWith over twenty-five (25) years of experience in the entertainment industry as an attorney, manager and record label owner, Mr. Robert A. Celestin has represented and worked with a number of talented artists and top music executives within the recording industry.\n\nMr. Celestin received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology and Philosophy in 1981 from Yale University and his Juris Doctorate from Columbia University School of Law in 1984.\n\nHe first got his start in the music business as the Program and Music Director of WYBC-FM while a student at Yale. It was there that record industry heavyweights like Sylvia Rhone and Sharon Heyward suggested that he attend law school.\n\nWhile a law student, Mr. Celestin interned at Inner City Broadcasting’s WBLS-FM as a Programming Assistant working with the late great Frankie Crocker.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Mr. Celestin commenced his legal career at the prestigious law firm of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays and Handler, LLP (“Kaye, Scholer”) concentrating primarily in Corporate Financing. Drawn to the more creative side of his personality, Mr. Celestin ventured into the music industry, which he considers his first love. He left Kaye Scholar and started his music law career at Arista Records, LLC. (“Arista”) in its legal department. Arista at the time, was the home of superstar “WHITNEY HOUSTON” and rap superstars “WHODINI”.\n\nDuring that time period, Mr. Celestin became friends with ANDRE HARRELL, a former Def Jam Records, Inc. executive and the founder of a fledgling record label named Uptown Records, Inc. (“Uptown”). After spending a year at Arista, Mr. Harrell invited Mr. Celestin to join Uptown as its Vice-President and General Manager.\n\nAt Uptown, Mr. Celestin was not only responsible for administrating the operations of Uptown, but he was also actively involved in creative decisions regarding the acquisition of recording artists and administrative decisions regarding the recording of various recording artists' albums. In addition, Mr. Celestin’s duties included handling the negotiations and the actual signing to Uptown of artists such as \"JODECI\", \"GUY\", \"MARY J.

(\"Untouchables\"), a record label founded by Heavy D and the Boyz’s member and producer Edward “DJ Eddie F” Ferrell. Untouchables had entered into a joint-venture agreement with Laface Records, LLC (a record label founded and owned by producer/sing-writer L.A. Reid and Kenny “BabyFace” Edmunds) and was responsible for the success of multi-platinum artists such as “DONNELL JONES”, “INTRO” and “PETE ROCK AND CL SMOOTH”. In addition, Mr. Celestin managed producers signed to the Untouchables Producer Management Division (\"UPM\"). As Vice President and General Manager of UPM, Mr. Celestin was responsible for managing the careers of hit producers such as Dave \"Jam\" Hall (MADONNA, MARY J. BLIGE & MARIAH CAREY), Edward \"DJ Eddie F” Ferrell (HEAVY D & the BOYZ, INTRO & TLC), KENNY \"Smoove\" KORNEGAY (CASE, CHANGINGS FACE & MARY J. BLIGE), among others.\n\nAfter a two (2) year stint at Untouchables, Mr. Celestin went into private practice and joined the law practice of Louise West and assisted her in the representation of superstar recording artists/producers “MISSY ELLIOTT”, “TIMBALAND”,“GINUWINE” and others.\n\nIn 2000, Mr. Celestin established the Law Offices of Robert A.
