        "text": "The Dance Studio came under the management of current ownerÂ Â and artistic director, Amy Famiglietti in September of 2006.Â Â Under the management of Amy, the studio has added ten classes to the Dance Studioâs current class list and also established The Senior Dance Company, Junior Elite Dance Company, and Junior Dance Company.Â Â The Dance Studio has also partnered with some of the industryâs best dancers, choreographers, and dance educators to bring innovative and exciting master class workshops into the studio for our dancers such as #1 Most popular Internet Dancer Matt Steffanina, NYCâs Broadway Dance Center and touring cast of Hamilton Choreographer Derek Mitchell, Rosero Mccoy who has choreographed for Disney Channelâs Shake it up, Keke Palmer, and Toni Braxton, Mary Antonini from West Side Story, Aladdin, and the Prom on Broadway, and Victor Smalley, Angel Armas, and Lucas Triana of Dance Moms Miami to name a few.Â\n\nOur three Dance Company teams offer additional performance opportunities to students who are extremely passionate about dancing. The Dance Company has competed and performed at the Pulse Dance Convention, Radix Dance Convention and Nuvo Dance Convention, graced the stage at the Walt Disney World Resort 8 times, Boston Celtics Opening Act at the TD Garden, performed at the Boston Aids Walk on the esplanade, Breast Cancer 3-Day Walk, Faneuil Hall as a part of the Rockette Opening Act Competition, Prudential Center Winter Lightâs Festival, Connect for Connecticut and many other local events.Â Â They have also been hired for the filming of an HGTV renovation show and danced in a marketing campaign commercial for a marketing company in Boston.\n\nThe Dance Studio works to provide a diverse and unique performing arts education to all students in a fun and artistic environment.Â Â We offer classes and performance opportunities to all age groups and students of varying skill levels!Â Â Whether you are looking to pick up dancing after a long hiatus, give it a first try, or are looking for a challenging dance education to help build a future in the performance industry, The Dance Studio has something to offer for you.\n\nAmyâs Mission: âI strive to give the students at The Dance Studio the most well rounded dance education possible. Itâs very important to me to stay current with the ever evolving dance world and community and then pass the knowledge I receive onto our dancers.Â Â Dance is so much more than a sport and physical activity and it is very important to me to create art and choreography that makes a difference and tells a story. I never want a student at The Dance Studio to feel like they are performing a dance because âthatâs whats happens when you take dance class.â I always want our studentsâ movement and performance to matter and to mean something more than a series of steps strung together to music. If my students graduate feeling like they understand dance as an artistic form of expression and understand the power of their performance...then I feel like Iâve succeeded.â"
