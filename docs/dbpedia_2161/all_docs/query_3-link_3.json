        "text": "Laurieann Gibson reinvents herself as ‘Harlee’\n\nPosted by | Ray Cornelius\n\nLaurieann Gibson can now add pop singer to her many list of accomplishments. The famed choreographer, who has worked with everyone from Diddy to Lady Gaga to Michael Jackson, has reinvented herself with the help of Akon and Johnny Wright under the name Harlee.\n\nAccording to BET, Gibson’s alter ego is looking to “incorporate both music and dance into one movement.”\n\n“The inspiration for me as an artist, a performer and a director was ‘Thriller’ and was ‘Smooth Criminal,’ and I think that is exactly the tone of my album both visually and with regard to the execution of the dance,” the “Dream Warriors” singer told BET.com. “I definitely think [that fusion] is missing and that’s the direct lane that Harlee is going to dominate and bring back.”\n\nClick here to see Harlee in action!\n\nPhoto Credit: Facebook/Laurieann Gibson"
