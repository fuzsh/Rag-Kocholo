        "text": "Laurieann \"BoomKack\" Gibson (born on July 14, 1969) is a Canadian choreographer, director, television personality, singer, actress and dancer from Toronto. In 2005, Gibson rose to prominence on the MTV reality series, Making the Band, and later worked as a judge on Little Talent Show, Skating with the Stars and So You Think You Can Dance. Gibson also had a brief musical career, in which she released two albums, Addictive in 2016 and Last Chance in 2012.\n\nCollaborations with Lady Gaga\n\nLaurieann was introduced to Gaga by Vincent Herbert in 2007. She taught Gaga about her experience onstage and shared tips while creating choreography for Gaga's songs.\n\nLaurieann was one of the founding members of the Haus of Gaga as choreographer and credited as L.A.G. in The Fame booklet. For her work, she won Best Choreography for \"Bad Romance\" at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nIn 2011, she also became the Creative Director of the Haus after the departure of Matthew Williams in late 2010. As Creative Director she collaborated notably with photographer Nick Knight, Fashion Director Nicola Formichetti and Artistic Director Todd Tourso for the Born This Way era. On February 13, 2011, Laurieann walked the red carpet while Gaga was in The Vessel for the 54th Grammy Award Ceremony. She told reporters that “She is incubating until her performance. She’s incubating, so she’s been in there for a serious amount of time, so we can’t let you know what it’s made of… What’s gonna happen tonight is she is gonna shift the world. And so this incubating process is not only necessary, but (it’s about) how dedicated she is to her performance.” After that, Laurieann directed the HBO concert special Lady Gaga Presents: The Monster Ball Tour at Madison Square Garden (February, 2011), co-directed with Gaga on the music videos for \"Judas\" (April, 2011) and \"Yoü and I\" (July, 2011) along with \"How Lady Gaga Keeps Intouch With Her Fans\", a Google Chrome commercial (May, 2011) using \"The Edge of Glory\".\n\nIn April to May of 2011,The Dance Scene, an American reality television series aired on E! that followed her and her team, including Richard Jackson, Lacee Franks and musical director Joe \"Flip\" Wilson. Later that year, Born to Dance, a reality dance competition show aired on BET which included a scene filmed on April 18, 2011. The scene included Laurieann, Vincent Herbet, Richard Jackson, Bethany Strong and 3 contestants and aired on September 11, 2011.\n\nIt was announced on November 12, 2011 that Gibson and Gaga parted ways. During an interview with Entertainment Tonight Canada, Gibson gave some insight behind the seperation. \"…without judgment, but it was a bit obscure for me, creatively. We reached a point where I wanted to keep that brand that helped build, a little more pure for teens. It was fun, but it's hard when everything is dark and heavy.\"\n\nChoreographer\n\nMusic videos\n\n\"Just Dance\" (March 2008)\n\n\"Beautiful, Dirty, Rich\" (2008)\n\n\"Poker Face\" (2008)\n\n\"LoveGame\" (March 2009)\n\n\"Paparazzi\" (April 2009)\n\n\"Bad Romance\" (November 2009)\n\n\"Telephone\" (January 2010)\n\n\"Alejandro\" (2010)\n\n\"Born This Way\" (January 2011)\n\n\"Judas\" (2011)\n\n\"Yoü and I\" (July 2011)\n\nTours\n\nNew Kids on the Block:Live (2008)\n\nThe Fame Ball Tour (2009)\n\nThe Monster Ball Tour (2009-2011)\n\nEvents\n\nFor a complete list, see \"Performances\" from 2008 to fall of 2011.\n\nMuchMusic Video Awards (May 2009)\n\nMTV Music Video Awards (September 2009)\n\nMuchMusic Video Awards (May 2011)\n\nCreative director\n\n\"Born This Way\" (2011)\n\n\"Judas\" (2011)\n\nDirector\n\nLady Gaga Presents: The Monster Ball Tour at Madison Square Garden (2011)\n\n\"Born This Way\" (2011/Unreleased)\n\n\"Judas\" (2011)\n\nGoogle Chrome commercial (2011)\n\n\"Yoü and I\" (2011)\n\nTrivia\n\nLaurieann won Best Choreography for \"Bad Romance\" at the 2010 MTV VMA.
