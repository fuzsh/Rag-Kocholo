        "text": "Famous for both steps and hits, choreographer Laurie Ann Gibson and hit making producer Rodney Jerkins are close to unveiling ‘Starmaker’! Slated to premiere on MTV August 16, ‘Starmaker’ zeros in on a Diddy helmed reality talent competition in which 14 artists compete for an exclusive recording contract with Bad Boy Records. According to MTV, ‘Starmaker,’ while following Diddy’s successful Making the Band series, will feature weekly performances from its competing artists before a live audience. In addition, each of the 14 artists will handle photo shoots, paparazzi and Diddy’s signature brand of challenging tasks. Jerkins, noted mostly for production of hits for Brandy, Mary J. Blige and Britney Spears, will act as an adviser and judge on the series. Joined by The Hollywood Reporter editor Tamara Conniff, Kimberly Caldwell, and noted music manager Johnny Wright, Jerkins along with Laurie Ann Gibson is expected to guide and if necessary, eliminate those who may not have what it takes to make it at Bad boy. StarMaker is executive produced by Sean Diddy Combs, Mark Burnettt, and Audrey Morrissey. StarMaker premieres on MtV August 16 at 10pm, immediately following MTV’s hit reality competition ‘America’s Best Dance Crew’."
