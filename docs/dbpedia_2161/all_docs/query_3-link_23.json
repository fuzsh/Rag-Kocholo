        "text": "Fox is looking to Mary J. Blige and choreographer Laurieann Gibson for its next music drama.\n\nThe network, home to Lee Daniels and Danny Strong’s Empire, has put 8 Count, inspired by Gibson’s life, into development. The project, from The Jackal Group’s Gail Berman and Joe Earley, landed at Fox with a sizable penalty attached.\n\nDescribed as a music-fueled drama, 8 Count follows a young choreographer who, in order to redeem her damaged reputation in the cutthroat music/dance world, must invest in an up-and-coming singer who also has one last shot at stardom.\n\nThe project brings Berman, former entertainment president, and Earley, former COO, back to Fox. The duo will executive produce via The Jackal Group. Erika L. Johnson (Shades of Blue, Queen Sugar) will pen the script. Gibson, a multiple Grammy winner, will also exec produce alongside Blige, who will also serve as a music adviser on the drama.\n\nGibson has choreographed music videos and live performances for the likes of Nicki Minaj, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry and more. Her TV work includes Making the Band, So You Think You Can Dance, Dance Moms and Starmaker. She is repped by APA.\n\nFor Fox, 8 Count comes as the network has two music dramas on its schedule — Empire and Star, the latter of which is also from Daniels.\n\nJohnson is repped by APA, Echo Lake Entertainment and Hansen Jacobson.\n\nBlige, a nine-time Grammy winner who co-stars in the upcoming Netflix feature Mudbound, is with APA."
