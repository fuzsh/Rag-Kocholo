        "text": "Choreographer Laurieann Gibson Is Teaching a Cardio Dance Class in Jamaica Plain\n\nThe celebrity choreographer is coming to town through new fitness concept Trillfit.\n\nWhen Bad Boy Entertainment was in its ’90s heyday, it was nearly impossible to turn on TRL without seeing a video by Director of Choreography Laurieann Gibson. Now, the dance legend is coming to Boston to let you live out your hip hop dreams.\n\nGibson—a classically trained dancer whose long resume also includes appearing on every season of Making the Band, serving as creative director for Lady Gaga and Nicki Minaj, and choreographing for the likes of Beyonce and Michael Jackson—will lead a cardio dance class at Jamaica Plain’s Urbano Project on Sept. 13, through a new fitness-meets-music concept called Trillfit.\n\nBut if you think you’ll be throwing it back to your ’90s glory days at Trillfit, think again. Gibson, who is now behind the brand BoomKack Worldwide, says she’s bringing some modern twists to the Boston event. “I have some new moves for this trip that are original moves and bring the fitness component into it,” she says.\n\nSo what exactly is Trillfit? Founder Heather White says it seeks to combine fitness and hip hop, with each session consisting of two 45-minute fitness classes, music spun by a live DJ, and gift bags for all students. In addition to Gibson’s dance class, the inaugural pop-up will include a Pilates class taught by Equinox’s Meagan Fitzgerald and music by DJ Nick Bishop.\n\nWhite says founding Trillfit was her way of filling a void in the boutique fitness industry. “I wanted to make really fun, experiential workouts that celebrate urban culture. I wanted to create something that would make me want to work out more,” she says. “I wanted to create an atmosphere where you and your girls—or your boys—could come, turn up, and get fit.”\n\nAnd, Gibson says, that’s exactly the kind of experience the first event promises.\n\n“Come one, come all—it’s for everybody,” Gibson says. “It’s about finding the dancer in every single person on this earth.”"
