        "text": "DESCRIPTION:\n\n(from MTV's web site, December 2009) Sean \"Diddy\" Combs and reality television visionary Mark Burnett join forces to produce P. Diddy's Starmaker -- an innovative performance elimination show that brings together the best elements of reality television under one roof: linking the explosive reality of young talent desperate to become stars with the excitement of on-stage competition. P. Diddy's Starmaker is the only show that gives viewers a backstage pass to see the real life drama behind the scenes as seven guys and seven girls battle it out for the superstar opportunity of a lifetime -- a deal with Diddy's Bad Boy Records label. Diddy has not only made a name for himself as an entertainment mogul but has proven his capabilities for nurturing talented and driven performers -- from the legendary Notorious B.I.G. to the chart topping Danity Kane (on MTV's Making the Band). Diddy has had years of experience with the ins and outs of making a reality show, and this time he has handpicked an elite team of industry heavyweights who will groom and judge these 14 aspiring singers over the course of 10 weeks of P. Diddy's Starmaker assignments. These assignments will give the contestants hands-on experience of the challenges aspiring superstars face by placing them in real life situations of the music business. All 14 P. Diddy's Starmaker performers live together in a Los Angeles mansion (featuring custom furniture by Gus Design) where romantic relationships, alliances and arguments flare up as the hopefuls navigate their way to stardom. Former American Idol contestant Kimberly Caldwell serves as the host of P. Diddy's Starmaker, while the contestants will be judged by the likes of performer Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins, music industry executive Tamara Conniff and choreographer Laurie Ann Gibson. Additionally, celebrity guest judges Pete Wentz (Fall Out Boy), Nicole Scherzinger (Pussy Cat Dolls), Lady Gaga and Kelly Rowland will also weigh in over the course of the competition. Noted artist manager Johnny Wright will mentor the contestants along the way and guide each one through the P. Diddy's Starmaker process, just as he guides his real life superstar clients like Justin Timberlake and the Jonas Brothers. Don't miss a minute of the P. Diddy's Starmaker journey, because when it's over, you'll be looking at the next big thing."
