        "text": "Mad Men\n\n10/9c AMC\n\nA splendid third-season opener offers some tiny clues to Don's past, and sees the firm mired in some corporate skulduggery as the result of being placed under \"British rule.\" One-third of the staff has been downsized, or in the term of the times, \"fired,\" and that proves to be a boon for Pete and Ken, leaving one of them pleased and the other upset. Don and Sal are dispatched to Baltimore to put out a fire involving a concerned client, and both men wind up spending a hot time in the old town. — Ray Stackhouse\n\nP. Diddy's StarMaker\n\n10/9c MTV\n\nThe industrious Diddy may be busy Making His Band, but he managed to find some time to exec-produce this new talent competition, which follows 14 aspiring singers (seven girls and seven guys) as they compete for a coveted deal with Diddy's Bad Boy Records. Over the course of 10 weeks, the hopefuls will be groomed and judged by industry heavyweights, including manager Johnny Wright, producer Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jenkins and choreographer Laurie Ann Gibson. American Idol alum Kimberly Caldwell hosts. — Karen Andzejewicz\n\nTrue Blood\n\n9/8c HBO\n\nOh, this is not going to end well. Even after Godric took the high road at the church to avoid massive bloodshed for humans and vampires alike — and seemingly brought everyone with him — that brain-dead Luke, drunk on Steve Newlin's Kool-Aid, showed up at the lair with a bomb strapped to his torso. But the potential for explosive outcomes isn't limited to Dallas, because back in Bon Temps, Lafayette has half a mind to scramble Eggs (and maybe bloody Maryann) over drastic changes in Tara's appearance and behavior. — Joe Friedrich\n\nArmy Wives\n\n10/9c Lifetime\n\nKelly Bishop (known for work on Gilmore Girls and her Tony Award for A Chorus Line) guest stars as Mrs. Jean Calhoun, the widow of a former senator, who has come to the base to attend a ground-breaking ceremony on the base. Thankfully Claudia Joy and Denise have resolved their issues and gotten their friendship back on track, since they serve as escort to this VIP. — Rhoda Charles\n\nMy Antonio\n\n10/9c VH1\n\nMost women would agree that General Hospital (and Janet Jackson video) star and Calvin Klein underwear model Antonio Sabato Jr. belongs on the hot list. In this series premiere, he's surrounded by beautiful women in Hawaii and looking for love. At some point in the 10-episode series, Antonio's ex-wife joins the contestants and tries to win him back, and Antonio's mom arrives to help him with his decision. — Fred Mitchell\n\nReality Hell\n\n10:30/9:30c E!\n\nGet ready to go meta. This new reality series mocks... reality series. Unsuspecting contestants will \"compete\" in fake reality set-ups that get more and more absurd as the series progresses. First up tonight: the backstabbing world of modeling reality shows."
