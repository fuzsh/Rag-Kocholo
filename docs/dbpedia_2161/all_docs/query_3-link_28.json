        "text": "REALITY\n\nSTRUTTIN’ HER STUFF\n\nWE’VE just gotten over Heidi Klum and her Teutonic reign on “Project Runway” and now Tyra Banks is returning with another edition of her paean to femininity, “America’s Next Top Model.” The notoriously imperious Miss Banks may meet her match among her new batch of wannabe supermodels. There are some tough chicks this year. Lluvy is a janitor from Modesto, California, and Michelle is a wrestler from Terre Haute, Indiana. There are also waitresses, a student, an elementary school aide, and a mom named Tiffany. Wonder how her children will react when they see her go for the glamour.\n\n—\n\nAMERICA’S NEXT TOP MODEL\n\nWednesday, 8 p.m., UPN\n\nMUSIC\n\nDIDDY SCOUTS FOR A GIRL GROUP\n\nP. DIDDY and his crew – managers Johnny Wright and Phil Robinson, choreographer Laurie Ann Gibson and vocal coach Doc Holiday – set out to form an all-girl group on “Making the Band 3.” Once nineteen semifinalists have been chosen, the girls live together in a New York City loft and audition for the demanding judges. Which girl will turn out to be the most neurotic? The nastiest? Miss Congeniality? Let’s just hope when they sing, our ears won’t bleed.\n\n—\n\nMAKING THE BAND 3\n\nThursday, 10 p.m., MTV\n\nDRAMA\n\nFade out\n\nTWELVE years after it changed the way television shows were produced, “NYPD Blue” is broadcasting its final episode. Many actors have stomped through the doors of its precinct – Amy Brenneman, David Caruso and Jimmy Smits – but none made such a lasting connection with the audience as Dennis Franz as volatile recovering alcoholic Andy Sipowicz. In the last episode, Sipowicz, who finally got promoted to detective, makes some tough decisions as he starts a new chapter in his life.\n\n—\n\nNYPD BLUE\n\nTuesday, 10 p.m., ABC\n\nREALITY\n\nRacing against time\n\nTWO reality-TV champs join the cast of the latest installment of “The Amazing Race.”\n\nRob and Amber first met on “Survivor: All-Stars” last year. She won the contest and he proposed. They are now engaged and this high-pressure show should be another test of their love. Should they win the prize, they will be millionaires for the second time, which will be a record for the reality genre, and for the network.\n\n“The Amazing Race,” unlike “Survior,” is the only reality series to have won an Emmy award in its category. It will have a two-hour premiere.\n\n—-\n\nTHE AMAZING RACE\n\nTuesday, 9 p.m., CBS\n\nDRAMA\n\nJerry’s last act\n\nTHE death of Jerry Orbach haunts the debut of “Law & Order: Trial By Jury.” Starring Bebe Neuwirth, Amy Carlson and Kirk Acevedo, “Trial” attempts to give the audience further insight into the workings of the criminal justice system by expressing the points of view of defendants, judges, jurors and defense attorneys. Soon there’ll be “Law& Order: Court Stenographer,” but until then, we’ll give this one a first look.\n\n—\n\nLAW & ORDER\n\nPreview: Thursday, 10 p.m., NBC\n\nPremiere: Friday, 10 p.m., NBC\n\nREALITY\n\nGetting buggy wit’ it\n\nEVERYONE’S seen morons eat creepy crawly critters on NBC’s “Fear Factor.” This week, the morons are famous – or maybe we should say infamous. True winners from the reality show game, like Ethan Zohn and Jenna Morasca from “Survivor,” Reichen Lehmkuhl from “The Amazing Race 4” and poetic fireman Ryan Sutter from “The Bachelorette” are among the participants. But they’ll all have to deal with the wiles of Omarosa from “The Apprentice.” Yes, the bitch is back and she’s up to her old tricks. When the contestants aren’t overreacting to her behavior, they will attempt several stunts, including crawling up a horizontal rope suspended from a helicopter and the mandatory snakes and worms snack bar.\n\n—\n\nFEAR FACTOR\n\nMonday 8 p.m., NBC"
