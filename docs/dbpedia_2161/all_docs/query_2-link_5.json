        "text": "Johnnie Wright, a singer and bandleader who was among the first country musicians to use Latin rhythms and who managed the singing career of his wife, Kitty Wells, died on Tuesday at his home in Madison, Tenn. He was 97.\n\nHis death was confirmed by his daughter Carol Sue Wright Sturdivant.\n\nMr. Wright and Jack Anglin, as Johnnie and Jack, placed 15 records in the country top 20 from 1951 to 1962. The most successful were remakes of doo-wop hits by the Four Knights and the Spaniels, including the Four Knights’ “(Oh, Baby Mine) I Get So Lonely,” a No. 1 country single in 1954.\n\nBut the record that distinguished the duo’s music from their harmony-singing predecessors was the Latin-inflected “Poison Love,” a 1951 hit that has been covered by Doug Sahm, Gail Davies and others. The idea to set the song to a Caribbean beat came from Ernie Newton, the bassist at the session.\n\nJohnnie and Jack had records on the country chart for the next decade, until Mr. Anglin’s death in 1963 in an automobile accident while traveling to a memorial service for Patsy Cline, Hawkshaw Hawkins and Cowboy Copas, who were killed in the same plane crash.\n\nAs a solo artist, Mr. Wright topped the country charts in 1965 with “Hello Vietnam,” a patriotic lament written by Tom T. Hall. Long before that, though, Mr. Wright’s career had been eclipsed by that of his wife, whose 1952 hit, “It Wasn’t God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels,” helped make her the most popular female country singer of the 1950s. Besides managing her career, Mr. Wright was the one who suggested that she adopt the stage name Kitty Wells, taken from a song recorded by the Pickard Family, “Sweet Kitty Wells.” She had been born Ellen Muriel Deason.\n\nMr. Wright himself underwent a minor a name change in 1962, when his given name was misspelled Johnny on one of Johnnie and Jack’s records. He began spelling his name Johnny after that.\n\nJohnnie Robert Wright was born on May 13, 1914, in Mount Juliet, Tenn., a farming community near Nashville. He was working for a cabinet company in Nashville when he met Ms. Wells (then Ellen Deason) in 1935. They were married in 1937. She sang gospel music on the Nashville radio station WSIX, and Mr. Wright and his sister Louise soon began performing with her on the air. After Ms. Wells gave birth to the couple’s first child, Mr. Wright and Mr. Anglin, who had married Louise, formed Johnnie and Jack and Their Tennessee Hillbillies.\n\nIn 1940 the two men moved their families to Greensboro, N.C., to host a radio show on WBIG. They later worked in Knoxville, Tenn., where they hired the young Chet Atkins to play fiddle for them. Mr. Atkins, who went on to greater renown as a guitarist, produced some of their records as well.\n\nThey returned to Nashville in 1947 to join the Grand Ole Opry, now calling their band the Tennessee Mountain Boys. They recorded for the Apollo and King labels but had little commercial impact. In 1948 they briefly moved to Shreveport, La., where they and Ms. Wells joined “Louisiana Hayride,” a radio show modeled on the Opry. They also signed with RCA Victor, for which they recorded their breakthrough hit, “Poison Love.”\n\nIn addition to his daughter, Mr. Wright is survived by Ms. Wells; their son, Bobby; eight grandchildren; 12 great-grandchildren; and three great-great-grandchildren. Their daughter Ruby died in 2009.\n\nMusic was always a family pursuit for the Wrights, who toured with their children as the Kitty Wells Family Show until they were in their 8os.\n\n“We worked with Roy Acuff for a year and he never would feature a girl because he didn’t think a girl could ever be a star of a show,” Mr. Wright told Nashville Scene. “We got to talking about it, and I said, ‘I don’t see why, if she’s more popular than Johnnie and Jack, we couldn’t call it the Kitty Wells Family Show With Johnnie and Jack. And it worked. Roy Acuff said it wouldn’t work, but it did.”"
