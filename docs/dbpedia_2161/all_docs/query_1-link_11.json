        "text": "In a break-up that ricocheted throughout the blogosphere, dance world and beyond, the Hollywood Reporter confirmed on Sunday that choreographer and creative director Laurieann Gibson is no longer working with Lady Gaga.\n\nLady Gaga Breaks From Creative Director Laurieann Gibson\n\nThe exact cause of the split has yet to be revealed, though plenty are posturing about tension between the two longtime collaborators — some claiming it stems from statements Gibson made in the press, others pointing to disparate visions for Gaga’s ever-evolving image. In an exclusive statement to THR, Gibson acknowledges that, “Recently, Lady Gaga was motivated to take the helm of the creative direction of her career.” But despite reports that she had been fired, Gibson says she “decided to step away.”\n\nIndeed, Gibson, who is also an in-house creative director at Interscope Records, tasked with guiding the visual roll-outs of developing artists, seems to be taking the high road when it comes to the Haus of Gaga she helped build. While not particularly press-shy, she has yet to discuss the matter in depth or publicly. Gibson’s only reaction thus far is her statement, printed below in its entirety:\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\n“I am fulfilled with the work I have done with choreographing all of the iconic moves, creative directing the artist, appearances, shows, directing the tour, music videos, and the HBO Monster Ball, which was a culmination of my work as its creator and director. Recently, Lady Gaga was motivated to take the helm of the creative direction of her career and as such I decided to step away. I am extremely proud of her, and in stepping away I wish her all the best. I look forward to continuing my work with notable artists, as well as new artists that are part of my Interscope Records deal, and the upcoming seasons of my TV shows.”\n\nGibson is the star of E! series “The Dance Scene,” which is produced by Ryan Seacrest Productions.\n\nGaga is currently wrapping up a slate of promotional appearances in England, which included a performance of her latest single, “Marry the Night,” on UK “X Factor.”"
