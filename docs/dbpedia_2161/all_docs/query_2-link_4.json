        "text": "Johnny Wright was among the most popular of the traveling country bandleaders during the big band era. Blending his country music roots with a slight bluegrass feel, Johnny’s band was the perfect backdrop for singers such as his beloved wife, Kitty Wells. Teaming with Jack Anglin in the 1950s and 60s, Johnnie and Jack had a string of hit recordings, among them “Poison Love” and “Stop the World (and Let Me Off)”, all the while touring with Kitty. He manged her career and in 1983 worked together to build the Family Country Junction Museum and Studio in their hometown of Madison, TN. Their grandson, John Sturdivant continues to run the recording studio."
