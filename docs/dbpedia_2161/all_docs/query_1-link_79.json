        "text": "Laurieann was to help Just Ivy for her promo tour where each performance would be 15-20 mins. The rehearsal was to take place for a period of 6 weeks with the first block being 3 weeks then a break followed by another 3 weeks.\n\nBlack Pearl Records said they paid Laurie Ann $50K prior to the rehearsals. However, they said that Laurieann only showed up to the first 2 weeks and then went MIA and didn’t explain her absence.\n\nThe company said they tried to contact Laurieann but her manager said she would not be coming back unless they paid an additional $25K.\n\nThey filed suit against Laurieann for breaching the contract and demanded $100K in damages. The company said she had blown off the lawsuit despite being served the legal paperwork last year. They demanded the court award them a default judgement in the amount of $100K.\n\nThen on June 19th, the NY judge hit her with a $100K default judgement in the case. The order granted Black Pearl Records their motion for a default judgement due to Laurieann never trying to defend herself against the allegations in the suit."
