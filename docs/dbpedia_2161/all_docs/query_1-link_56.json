        "text": "Reina Hidalgo & Asiel Hardison\n\nA&R Creative\n\nCREDITS FOR REINA AND ASIEL: PINK,LADY GAGA, RIHANNA,CIARA, GLORIA ESTEFAN,MISSY ELLIOT,ALICIA KEYS, SEAN KINGSTON,RICKY MARTIN,JENNIFER LOPEZ,KYLIE MINOGUE,DANCE SPIRIT MAGAZINE,GRAMMYS, VMA'S,AMERICAN MUSIC AWARDS,SNL, DANCING WITH THE STARS, IPOD,GOOD MORNING AMERICA, JAY LENO, ELLEN, NIKE, ADIDAS.\n\nReina Hidalgo is an Afro-Latina Cuban native from Miami and New Jersey. She attended college at New World School of the Arts in Miami where she received numerous scholarships and her B.F.A. in Dance. Since relocating to California in 2004, Reina has appeared in numerous films, TV shows, commercials, world tours, and music videos as a dancer. In the last 9 years, Reina has focused on her choreography and producing career. Her work has been seen on Masked Singer, Latin Billboards, Latin Grammys, So You Think You Can Dance, The Hunger Games 2, Enrique Iglesias, and The Jonas Brothers. She was also Supervising Choreographer and Consulting Producer for the EMMY Nominated HULU original show “East Los High”. You can see her latest work on Daddy Yankee’s 2022 “Legendaddy” world tour and Encanto Live at the Hollywood Bowl/ Disney Plus.\n\nWhen Asiel Hardison gets in a zone he dances like no one is watching. Dancing is his life and his rhythm lies within his heartbeat. Growing up on the south side of Chicago in Beverly, Asiel’s grandmother exposed him to the performing arts as a young boy. “Taking me to shows as a young child really inspired me to get on stage myself,” says Asiel. He got his start at ETA Performing Arts Center and learned all forms of dance. But he fell in love with dance when he saw Michael Jackson’s Bad video and has been dancing ever since.\n\nDancing had become such an intense passion as a teenager; Asiel chose rehearsals over hanging out with friends. If practice makes perfect, then persistence leads to progression. By the time Asiel reached 21 he already received an abundance of recognition and knew dance was more than just a dream. It was his life. So he packed up and headed westward bound to L.A. in 2004 where he landed his first major gig choreographing an Afro-Cuban opening number for Gloria Estefan. Filming an iPod commercial, being a dance double for Bernie Mac in the movie Soul Men, and leading dance workshops are just a few bullets to take note of on his resume.\n\nIf Asiel looks familiar it’s because you’ve seen him dancing along side of pop sensation Lady Gaga since 2008 as her dance captain. He was chosen as captain by world-renowned choreographer Laurieann Gibson. This was a dream come true. However, being a dreamer isn’t what got him to his dream – hard work, poise and passion did. “Laurieann assigned me as Lady Gaga’s dance captain after seeing my ability and work ethic in rehearsals for the FAME tour,” says Asiel.\n\nOf course every success story has its roadblocks. As much as dance is his passion, Asiel speaks of the biggest obstacle he has overcome - doubt. “The biggest obstacle has been trusting my gift and knowing that if I put my heart into this passion that I will be satisfied.” He’s a versatile dancer, but there is a certain energy that Asiel brings to dancing; as if it’s a spirit. There’s more to it than 5-6-7-8. Having the ability to tap into that spirit is what sets him apart from other dancers. “Dancing is my true love and therapy,” says Asiel. “I like to make you feel something when you watch, take you on a journey and tell you my story when I’m dancing.” His story is a story of humble success and is sure to be continued."
