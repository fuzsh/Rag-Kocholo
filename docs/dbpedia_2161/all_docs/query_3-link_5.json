        "text": "It’s the reincarnation of Laurieann Gibson. The singer and choreographer is returning to the spotlight with a new project. The 44-year-old, who rose to fame on MTV’s “Making the Band,” has signed a deal with Akon and Justin Timberlake’s manager Johnny Wright and renamed herself Harlee, the self-proclaimed “captain of the dream warriors.”\n\nIn the mysterious teaser, Harlee struggles to escape the clutches of two men, who hose her and drag her through a dark warehouse while her feet remain bruised and broken.\n\n“I fight for the people who need to be inspired #hope has wings – #Harlee,” tweeted Gibson, who has choreographed for Lady Gaga and Nicki Minaj.\n\nShe previously released one-off singles including 2012’s “Last Chance,” but has never put out a full album.\n\nWatch her reintroduce herself."
