        "text": "769 Entertainment has launched and partnered with multi-talented choreographer and creative director Laurieann Gibson. Helmed by former Atlantic Records, MGM/United Artists, and Michael Jackson’s MJJ Music president Jerry L. Greenberg, 769 Entertainment partnered with Gibson to create “a movement crossing racial, social, political, and economic lines as a celebration of dance.”\n\nSays Greenberg, “With so much great music and talent emerging today, along with all the new technologies, social media and countless ways to promote, I feel it’s the right time to get back into the playing field and start a new, exciting and relevant entertainment company.”\n\nTransitioning successfully from Gibson's early career as a dancer with Alvin Ailey’s dance troupe and In Living Color Fly Girl to in-demand choreographer, director, and creative director, she is one of the most admired dancers—Gibson introduces her next logical, creative pivot. She has been quoted as saying, “Artist development is something I’ve been passionate about from my days at Uptown and Motown Records.” Now it is her turn behind the microphone to bring her ideas and vocal talents to our musical culture through this deal with 769 Entertainment.\n\nGibson is an on-camera personality featured on various series including Making The Band, So You Think You Can Dance, Dance Moms and Starmaker. Behind the scenes, Gibson currently is working on the scripted Fox series 8-Count that Deadline Hollywood describes as, “a music-filled drama that follows a young choreographer who, in order to redeem her damaged reputation in the music/dance world, must invest in an up-and-coming singer who has one last shot at stardom.” It is based loosely on aspects of Gibson’s life, and is being developed by multi-platinum selling and Grammy-award winning and Oscar-nominated artist, Mary J. Blige."
