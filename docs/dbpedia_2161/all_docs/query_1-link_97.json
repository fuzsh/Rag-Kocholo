        "text": "Babe you admire and why?\n\nA Babe I admire the most would have to be my mother. She is one of the strongest, most independent and loving humans I’ve ever met. The tremendous sacrifices and unconditional support that she offers to her two children is beyond selfless. Most of my perception on how to be a woman and how to stay positive during hardships are influenced by how she raised me and how she lives her life.\n\nIn your opinion, which music video has the all-time best choreo?\n\nI would have to say “All For You” by Janet Jackson\n\nWhat is the best piece of advice you've ever been given?\n\n“Stay ready so you don't have to get ready” I also just love this one: “If it's not hell yes, it's a no”.\n\nWhat’s your go-to comfort food?\n\nI can always do pad Thai.\n\nIf you could be anywhere in the world right now, where would you be?\n\nI would be in 90 degree weather laying on a beach, watching the sunset with my crystals charging next to me.\n\nThe Hustle:\n\nTell us about your hustle.\n\nWhen I am on the road and performing, my role varies depending on the artist I am working with. Sometimes I am just the performer, so my responsibility is to make sure that I have the choreography down; to make sure my instrument is polished enough to perform the choreography to the best of my ability. When I am more than the performer, I sometimes play the role of dance captain. Then, I am responsible for making sure that the dancers are all performing in unison. When we are rehearsing at the venues for soundcheck, it is my responsibility to confirm that our props and wardrobe are correctly located on stage, and also working alongside the artist to make sure that their mic, wardrobe and props are all in their designated areas. After the performance, I collect all props and wardrobe and return them to their proper luggage. As a freelance dancer, I’m constantly moving from a rehearsal to the stage or from a photoshoot to an audition. If I have an audition, I do my research on the choreographer, the show and the role I am going in for. Depending on when I'm finished, I would either go to the dance studio to take a dance class or to cool down in yoga. I like to start my week with yoga to align my mind, body and soul. It's very important for all three to be aligned so that I can perform at my best. On days where I don't have auditions, I'll focus on cross training. Sometimes that means I'm taking a kickboxing class at CKO or boxing at Rumble Gym, or just any full body cardio classes.\n\nWhen did you first know that you wanted to pursue dance professionally?\n\nEver since I was a young girl I knew I would dance, and knew it was the only thing I wanted to do. My mother says she knew I would be a dancer because every time she played music when I was in her womb I would not stop moving. I remember being four years-old, dancing in front of my mother's closet mirrors and feeling like a star.\n\nWhat were some steps that you took to establish yourself as a professional? What are some obstacles that you faced early on?\n\nThe first step I took would have to be attending a performing arts high school where I began building the foundation for my career. Next was receiving my BFA. Learning dance history and getting classical training such as ballet, modern and jazz were fundamental for my career. Taking workshops from choreographers that I looked up to, and who were involved in jobs that I wanted to partake in, helped me along in my process. Learning the commercial industry by taking classes/seminars from directors and casting agents helped me comprehend how to maneuver through the entertainment industry.One of the obstacles I had to endure was coming from a concert dance background and having to transition to the commercial industry. This was difficult because in concert dance, you’re hired into a company based on your dance ability/technique and aesthetic, whereas in commercial dancel, there are many factors to consider—one of them being your “look”. Most directors, when booking for a commercial, movie or music video, have an image that is specific to their vision. Most of the time, you can book a job just because of your image before you're even able to present your talent.\n\nWhat’s it like to see your visions come to life onstage or on camera?\n\nSeeing my vision come to life is an amazing sensation. Being able to witness my language (my movement) come from a thought to a feeling to a motion on a larger scale like a stage is overwhelmingly satisfying. A moment that I am intentionally present because live performance is only alive at that time and place.\n\nHave you ever faced creative differences with a choreographer or dance partner? If so, how did you handle that situation?\n\nYes, I experienced moments with dance partners where we've had creative differences. In those moments, I always try to understand the other artist's vision. The best solution is to find ways to compromise so that both artists' visions come to fruition without devaluing each other.\n\nHow have your past professional and academic experiences and lessons prepared you for the work you do today? How have they not prepared you?\n\nWhen attending George Mason University, they introduced classes that were beneficial to understanding the many roles of the industry. For example, I had to take a production and lighting class. which was extremely useful for the work I do now because I am able to communicate with lighting directors and stage managers.\n\nWhat style of dance do you enjoy the most? Which do you find the most challenging?\n\nRight now, I’m enjoying house dance the most. Tap has always been challenging to me.\n\nHow has being a woman impacted your professional experiences? What can we collectively do to support and empower women in your industry today?\n\nBeing a woman is one of the greatest gifts I've been given. In a male-driven industry, it's been so important to stay grounded in my values. Understanding that I am equal to men regardless of their position in the industry has helped me tackle my mental limitations and become a representation for the younger generation that anything is possible when you stay focused and put your mind to it. You will hear no’s because of your appearance or how you speak, but that should never deter you from your dreams. As women, we should never let people, or social media platforms, depict how we're supposed to look. As a woman and artist in my community it is my responsibility to uplift women to love their natural talents; to understand and believe that they are good enough!\n\nSpecifically, how has being a WOC impacted your professional experience? What can we do to create more supportive and inclusive work environments inside and outside of your industry?\n\nBeing a woman of color has impacted my career when it comes to getting certain jobs or roles. It reverts back to the “look” issue I mentioned before. For example, I didn't get a job once because my skin was darker than the other girls, and I wouldnt fit the look that they were going for. It hasn't happened many times, but it does occur. To improve this in my industry, I think it must begin with the people in control of casting dancers, including choreographers, directors, casting agents, etc. If they can change their perception from remaining traditional and allowing their visions to expand where race and culture are included and not refrained from, we can be supportive to all.\n\nWhat’s one thing you’re proud to have accomplished in your career thus far?\n\nOne thing I would be proud of is having the opportunity to be part of the “Boston Black” exhibit at the Boston Children's Museum. In this exhibit I talk about my family and where I come from, as well as the style of dance that I do and why I love to dance.\n\nWhat has been your most memorable performance?\n\nMy most memorable performance was when I performed at the White House with my salsa dance group called “Ritmo en Accion” for First Lady Bush. We were performing because we received an award called “The Coming Up Taller Award.”\n\nWho are some women in your field that you look to for inspiration?\n\nJust to name a few: Jessica Castro, Luam Kefzlegy and Laurieann Gibson\n\nYour career makes a lot of physical demands. How do you recharge and relax in your free time?\n\nTo recharge, I meditate. As an artist I'm always on the hustle and on the go, and sometimes as humans we forget that we are not robots. So I do the opposite of what I normally do: I sit still. I listen to music, take long hot baths and hang out with my dog, Rocky.\n\nCareer and/or life advice for other babes?\n\nCareer advice: “Stay ready so you don’t have to get ready!” Do your research for the job or position, and prepare yourself in all the necessary fields so when the time comes, you are more than prepared and don't have to “fake it till you make it.”\n\nLife advice: Never allow anything or anyone stop you from doing and being who you truly are. You were uniquely created with your own special light, and your light was meant to shine bright. Turn your light on—and keep it on!"
