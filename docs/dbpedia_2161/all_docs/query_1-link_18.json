        "text": "Lady Gaga's former creative director, Laurieann Gibson, shared how the \"Poker Face\" singer fired her and the reason behind it.\n\nGibson, 51, got candid after losing her job with Gaga. According to her, she was fired via email because the people surrounding the singer felt that \"I was taking too much spotlight.\"\n\nGibson helped Gaga, 34, become a superstar with her debut album \"The Fame Monster.\" She was the creative genius behind Gaga's \"Monster Ball\" tour as well. Gibson also worked with other stars like Katy Perry and even dipped into the fashion world with Naomi Campbell. However, Gaga's camp wanted her to focus on the \"A Star Is Born\" actress only.\n\n\"At that point, I was fully immersed into continuing to build what was now a number-one iconic brand … and then to be able to collaborate with the greatest model on earth… [I was] extending my creativity far past music. That version of me was euphorically happy and the beginning of me really understanding my creative ability and how it would impact pop culture,\" she told Page Six.\n\nGibson considered her time working with Gaga \"very exciting\" because prior to that, she did \"Making the Band\" and also worked with Missy Elliott, the Jonas Brothers and The Dixie Chicks.\n\n\"I had worked with the greats,\" she continued. \"Once [Gaga’s then-manager] Vincent Herbert brought me Gaga obviously it was not the brand the world got introduced to, but I was able to put all aspects of my ability into this young artist and it worked.\"\n\nGaga and Gibson parted ways in 2011 and she blamed the \"Yessigans\" — the yes people — around Gaga. For her, their falling-out was due to what the people around the artist told her about Gibson.\n\n\"I’m convinced the falling-out between Lady Gaga and me… wasn’t about the two of us at all,\" she wrote in her book \"Dance Your Dance: 8 Steps to Unleash Your Passion and Live.\"\n\n\"Instead, some of the people around her thought I shouldn’t be working with other artists … They thought that I was taking too much spotlight — even though I didn’t want her spotlight. Just as I realized this chatter was happening, Gaga fired me. In an email. I’m not even sure she wrote it herself.\"\n\nSpeaking about her book, she said it was not autobiographical. It's about eight steps on how one can unleash their passion and live their dreams and they are supported by some real-life situations. She talked about the steps and the process and accepted the fact that she went through what she did to get the revelation for the lesson.\n\nGibson's book, \"Dance Your Dance,\" was released on Tuesday."
