        "text": "Roger Bonds, Diddy‘s former head of security, has released a statement following Cassie‘s now-settled lawsuit against Diddy.\n\nOver the weekend, Bonds addressed the filing on his Instagram story, considering the suit mentioned him by name. According to him, he’s releasing a statement because he has four daughters, and “saw [things].”\n\n“This is not meant to be threats or snitching or anything like that against Cassie or Diddy or anyone else,” Bonds wrote. “This is me telling my truth as I truly remember it for 2 reasons only, 1st because I have 4 daughters so on all dudes my truth as I seen it, saw it and was involved with for yrs.”\n\nIn a since-deleted post per Complex, he shared photos of himself and Cassie over the years, captioned, “IM WILLING TO TELL MY TRUTH BECAUSE FOR SO MANY YRS I WAS QUIET , Nothing matters now but FAMILY.”\n\nCassie claimed that Bonds witnessed Diddy allegedly stomping on her face in a January 2009 incident after he saw her speaking to another music manager in a Los Angeles nightclub. She stated that Bonds attempted to intervene and prevent the assault, which was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nThe “Me & U” singer had hoped that talking with a new manager would “allow her to further grow her career, and that Mr. Combs would be happy for her,” but he instead became enraged. Diddy reportedly kicked her in the face and she began to bleed “profusely.” When seeing the physical evidence of the abuse, the Combs Global mogul “forced his staff to bring [Cassie] to a hotel suite at The London\n\nHotel in Los Angeles, where she was required to stay for a week,” per the lawsuit."
