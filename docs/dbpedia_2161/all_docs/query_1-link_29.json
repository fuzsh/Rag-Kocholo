        "text": "Lady Gaga Breaks From Creative Director Laurieann Gibson\n\n[img:$uid]http://www.billboard.com/photos/stylus/1282669-lady-gaga-mtv-europe-617.jpg[/img:$uid]\n\nLady Gaga and her longtime creative director Laurieann Gibson are no longer working together, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed.\n\nPopular hip-hop gossip site MediaTakeOut was first to report that the two had a \"bitter fight.\" It postulates that Gibson's ego has gotten the best of the choreographer-turned-reality star and points to several comments made in the press recently, one in which Gibson credits Madonna for inspiring Gaga's ever-evolving style -- a comparison Gaga has tried to distance herself from.\n\nThe two had been working together since Gaga was first signed to Interscope Records. In April, Gibson described their earliest experiences together to THR. \"I met one brilliant artist that the world had no idea existed,\" she said. \"The hypocrisies of the industry were forcing her to act one way. She tells people that I fought for her, and I fought to protect her gift because it's rare. She's a fearless, transparent entertainer... we're colorful, we're dramatic, we were born this way.\"\n\nBut as time went on, and Gibson pursued her own projects, like the Ryan Seacrest-produced E! series The Dance Scene, friction began to trickle into their working relationship. A hint of it came during the filming of Gaga's \"Judas\" video, whose strong religious overtones made Gibson somewhat uneasy. She described the conceptual debate as such: \"At one point, there was two completely different views and after the third glass of wine, I was like, 'Listen, I don't want lightning to strike me. I believe in the Gospel and I'm not going there.'\" Gibson added that she would have walked away from filming without a conceptual compromise.\n\nA scrapped treatment for the \"Edge of Glory\" video also apparently involved Gibson, who brought up \"an issue\" with director Joseph Kahn's vision for the clip, which was scrapped in favor of a low-rent city fire escape visual. Gibson went on a Twitter tirade after fans questioned the production value of the video and what went down. Gibson tweeted to two such critics: \"listen u disrespectful f**k they had an issue on set I don't lie!!!!!\" and \"creative Changes happen always educate ignorant Monster's!!!\"\n\nAccording to a source, relations between Gibson and Gaga really began to unravel this summer around the filming of yet another video, \"Yo√º and I.\" More recently, THR reported of a red carpet scuffle in September involving Gibson at the Creative Arts Emmys, where she was nominated for directing Gaga's Monster Ball concert movie for HBO. Apparently, Gibson was taking her sweet time posing for photographers, so much so that she created gridlock and angered ID PR chief Kelly Bush, who was waiting with her client Paul Reubens.\n\nRichard Jackson, who was Gibson's No. 2, is now choreographing all of Gaga's performances, the pop star tweeted on Nov. 6. The two are currently in London, where Gaga just performed on U.K. X Factor.\n\nA rep for Gaga confirmed to THR that the two are no longer working together but declined to comment further. Gibson could not be reached for comment.\n\nTimmy84 said:\n\nMusicslave said:\n\nLooks like Laurieann was somewhat of a creative filter for her, if anything she'll probably be even more no holds barred now that Laurieann is out of the picture. Better watch out, here she comes, Lady Gaga: Raw & Uncut!\n\nExcuse my French but the bitch came out at the X Factor with a decapitated head costume!\n\n[Edited 11/15/11 8:58am]\n\nI hear ya Timmy I know I know... It just seems like perhaps there was even more she would've done if Laurieann wasn't around to discourage it. I couldn't imagine what. LIke you said, just when she blew your mind with the egg, she pulls the ole decapitated head trick.\n\nListen, I'm not trying to make Laurieann out to be a saint or some ultra-conservative either. Maybe she was a slight voice of restraint for her. Who knows? I guess the proof will be in the pudding huh?"
