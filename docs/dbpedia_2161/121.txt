Laurieann "BoomKack" Gibson (born on July 14, 1969) is a Canadian choreographer, director, television personality, singer, actress and dancer from Toronto. In 2005, Gibson rose to prominence on the MTV reality series, Making the Band, and later worked as a judge on Little Talent Show, Skating with the Stars and So You Think You Can Dance. Gibson also had a brief musical career, in which she released two albums, Addictive in 2016 and Last Chance in 2012.

Collaborations with Lady Gaga

Laurieann was introduced to Gaga by Vincent Herbert in 2007. She taught Gaga about her experience onstage and shared tips while creating choreography for Gaga's songs.

Laurieann was one of the founding members of the Haus of Gaga as choreographer and credited as L.A.G. in The Fame booklet. For her work, she won Best Choreography for "Bad Romance" at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards.

In 2011, she also became the Creative Director of the Haus after the departure of Matthew Williams in late 2010. As Creative Director she collaborated notably with photographer Nick Knight, Fashion Director Nicola Formichetti and Artistic Director Todd Tourso for the Born This Way era. On February 13, 2011, Laurieann walked the red carpet while Gaga was in The Vessel for the 54th Grammy Award Ceremony. She told reporters that “She is incubating until her performance. She’s incubating, so she’s been in there for a serious amount of time, so we can’t let you know what it’s made of… What’s gonna happen tonight is she is gonna shift the world. And so this incubating process is not only necessary, but (it’s about) how dedicated she is to her performance.” After that, Laurieann directed the HBO concert special Lady Gaga Presents: The Monster Ball Tour at Madison Square Garden (February, 2011), co-directed with Gaga on the music videos for "Judas" (April, 2011) and "Yoü and I" (July, 2011) along with "How Lady Gaga Keeps Intouch With Her Fans", a Google Chrome commercial (May, 2011) using "The Edge of Glory".

In April to May of 2011,The Dance Scene, an American reality television series aired on E! that followed her and her team, including Richard Jackson, Lacee Franks and musical director Joe "Flip" Wilson. Later that year, Born to Dance, a reality dance competition show aired on BET which included a scene filmed on April 18, 2011. The scene included Laurieann, Vincent Herbet, Richard Jackson, Bethany Strong and 3 contestants and aired on September 11, 2011.

It was announced on November 12, 2011 that Gibson and Gaga parted ways. During an interview with Entertainment Tonight Canada, Gibson gave some insight behind the seperation. "…without judgment, but it was a bit obscure for me, creatively. We reached a point where I wanted to keep that brand that helped build, a little more pure for teens. It was fun, but it's hard when everything is dark and heavy."
