        "text": "The scope of this minisymposium concerns the mitigation of seismic responses of existing structures. Towards this direction, vibration control advancements focus lately on the development of passive, semi-active, and active control techniques. Among others, these include the incorporation of additional oscillating masses, that introduce damping to the structural system (i.e., Tuned Mass Dampers - TMD), the application of negative stiffness elements (i.e., Negative Stiffness Devices – NS, and Quasi-Zero Stiffness Oscillators - QZS), and TMDs with Inerters (i.e., Tuned Mass Dampers Inerter - TMDI).\n\nThis minisymposium encourages the submission of research papers presenting new findings in the field of computational modelling, experimental testing, and optimization of novel vibration control approaches implemented in existing structures for seismic protection.\n\nTopics relevant to this minisymposium include, but are not limited to:\n\n1) Seismic protection techniques for civil engineering structures against horizontal or vertical component of ground motions\n\n2) Innovative vibration control systems (negative stiffness elements, inerters, tuned mass dampers)\n\n3) Advanced and simplified numerical modelling of vibration isolation and energy dissipation devices\n\n4) Experimental and qualification testing of isolation/dissipation devices\n\n5) Analytical methods for simplified modelling and analysis\n\n6) Seismic absorption concepts for foundation of structures\n\nThe urgency of proactive actions for improving the resilience and sustainability of the built environment is one of today’s critical tasks in Civil Engineering. In this perspective, robust and reliable optimization procedures offer immense promise and transformative potential for mitigating seismic risk.\n\nTraditional seismic design methodologies often prioritize safety, leading to solutions that are either cost-prohibitive or require time-consuming design iterations. On the other hand, advanced optimization algorithms and frameworks can be strategically employed throughout the structure's entire lifecycle, allowing practitioners to explore a broader range of design options that are not only structurally sound but also cost-effective, efficient, and environmentally sustainable.\n\nThis mini-symposium proposes a paradigm shift in this domain.\n\nFrom structural monitoring and assessment to the design of retrofitting strategies, optimization tools allows to glean deeper insights into structural health, predict potential vulnerabilities with enhanced accuracy, and design more targeted and cost-effective retrofitting interventions when necessary.\n\nThe aim of this mini-symposium is to convene academics and practitioners in the field of civil engineering, computer science, and disaster risk management in order to foster the exchange of latest advancements and experiences on the optimum design and control of structures for seismic risk reduction.\n\nTopics of interest include (but are not limited to) the following themes:\n\nadvanced algorithms and computational technologies specifically tailored for design and control of structures;\n\napplication of Artificial Intelligence tools for seismic risk reduction;\n\nestablishment of best practices for successfully integrating optimization algorithms with traditional design methodologies on real-world structures.\n\nThis minisymposium focuses on both theoretical and practical aspects concerning the transient solution of structural dynamics problems in science and engineering. Particularly, novel numerical methods and solution strategies as well as discretization schemes in space and time for wave propagation, structural vibration, structural health monitoring, coupled problems (e.g., fluid-structure-interaction) and impact problems are of interest. This includes, but is not limited to, the development or the application of:\n\n• isogeometric and high-order finite element methods (e.g., IGA, SEM, p-FEM, etc.);\n\n• fictitious domain methods;\n\n• meshfree methods;\n\n• mass lumping and mass scaling techniques;\n\n• advanced time integration schemes (e.g., novel implicit and explicit time integration schemes, implicit-explicit or asynchronous time integration schemes, sub-cycling, parallel implementation, etc.).\n\nFurthermore, contributions dealing with large-scale, industry-relevant applications are expressly welcome.\n\nOffshore wind energy is currently one of the most rapidly expanding sectors within the global energy industry. In parallel with the growth in demand for renewable energy, there has been a proportional increase in the size and capacity of wind turbines (WTs). Larger turbines can capture more wind energy, making them more efficient and cost-effective. Consequently, the current design trends for WTs are characterized by the development of increasingly larger rotors and the construction of more slender and taller towers. These structures are subjected to a multitude of environmental loads that can significantly impact their design and operation. The most critical of these loads include the combined effects of wind and sea waves, as well as seismic forces in areas prone to earthquakes. These loads result in substantial structural vibrations and fatigue within the tower and foundation, which may ultimately lead to structural failures. To ensure the longevity and reliability of wind turbines, it is imperative to both mitigate the induced structural vibrations and enhance their design.\n\nThis minisymposium focuses on addressing the critical challenge of mitigating ambient vibrations, such as those caused by earthquakes, wind, and wave loading, particularly in wind turbine structures. Experts and researchers from multidisciplinary backgrounds are encouraged to propose innovative strategies and technologies aimed at strengthening wind turbine towers, ensuring their structural integrity and operational efficiency. Among the topics of discussion are recent vibration control strategies, including passive, semi-active, and active control techniques. Some of these strategies involve the utilization of Tuned Mass Dampers (TMDs), TMDs with inerters (TMDIs), and devices incorporating negative stiffness (NS) elements.\n\nThis minisymposium encourages the submission of research papers presenting new findings in the fields of computational modeling, experimental testing, and optimization of novel vibration control systems implemented in wind turbine structures for vibration mitigation.\n\nArtificial Intelligence can process vast amounts of data using fast, iterative, and intelligent algorithms, enabling software to automatically 'learn' from diverse input data. One key application of AI is Machine Learning, which automates the creation of analytical models. Machine Learning allows computers to learn without explicit programming. In recent years, Machine Learning has advanced rapidly, promising to significantly transform and enhance the role of data science across various fields. A comprehensive review reveals that Machine Learning has been utilized in four key areas of earthquake engineering: seismic hazard analysis, system identification and damage detection, seismic fragility assessment, and structural control for earthquake mitigation.\n\nMachine Learning is poised to significantly advance research and practice in earthquake engineering. Currently, there are two main approaches in this field: physics-based methods, which are transparent, interpretable, and somewhat predictable, and data-driven Machine Learning models, which are often not unique and can be difficult to interpret. Consequently, there is a growing trend toward finding a balance between these approaches. Since the lack of physical interpretation in Machine Learning models can limit their applicability to similar problems, integrating physical knowledge into Machine Learning-based earthquake engineering studies is essential. Despite the increasing number of studies, the application of Machine Learning in earthquake engineering is still in its early stages compared to other disciplines. However, with the support of next-generation data sharing and sensor technologies, Machine Learning holds great potential to revolutionize earthquake engineering.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Machine Learning has been applied in four key areas of earthquake engineering: seismic hazard analysis, system identification and damage detection, seismic fragility assessment, and structural control for earthquake mitigation. The literature identifies seven classes of Machine Learning methods: artificial neural networks, support vector machines, response surface models, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and hybrid methods that combine multiple soft computing algorithms, such as fuzzy logic. This Minisymposium invites presentations on all these topic areas and Machine Learning methods in earthquake engineering.\n\nThe engineering community has widely acknowledged and accepted the importance of accounting for the effects of uncertainty on the performance of engineering systems subject to time-varying loading. Among others, this is also dictated by the need to efficiently account for the uncertainty pertaining to modelling natural excitations such as seismic and wind loads. The latter often exhibit time-varying characteristics, which are better captured by resorting to a stochastic processes-based modelling. In addition, the explicit quantification of the uncertainty in structural systems, in particular, is an extremely challenging task since highly refined numerical models are already used to characterize the system performance. It is thus clear that accounting for uncertainties adds additional levels of complexity over the (already challenging) dynamic deterministic analysis. Hence, there is an evident and ever-increasing need to develop efficient numerical methods that allow quantifying uncertainty for analysis of dynamical systems.\n\nThis mini-symposium aims at presenting the latest developments and approaches for uncertainty quantification in the field of computational stochastic dynamics. The scope of the mini-symposium is broad, as it includes different types of linear and nonlinear structural problems; the development of novel advanced simulation approaches, path integration- and probability-density-based methods, as well as metamodeling-based frameworks; model identification in stochastic systems; and practical applications of methods for uncertainty quantification in stochastic dynamics comprising, e.g., robust design, reliability-based design, multi-objective optimization, life-cycle optimal design, sensitivity analysis, model updating, etc. Both theoretical developments and practical applications involving systems of engineering interest are particularly welcomed.\n\nKey words: stochastic dynamics, uncertainty propagation, dynamical response.\n\nMost part of masterpieces and art collections are stored in historical buildings used as Museums. Such buildings are usually very sensitive to vibrations since they were built without any anti-seismic regulations. Their dynamic properties, therefore, can largely affect the safety of the exhibited artifacts, which can easily be very vulnerable, due to their age, materials, and features. At the occurring of seismic excitations, art collections can experience relevant damages, and the most vulnerable items can be destroyed. However, even for ordinary occurrences, the vibrations can be a threat, affecting the safety and the conservation properties of some items.\n\nThis session is focused on the dynamic monitoring and analysis of both historical buildings used for exhibition and pieces of art. A special attention is devoted to the combined effects of the dynamic response of container and content due to external excitations. Both exceptional excitations, such as earthquakes and explosions, and ordinary ones, such as micro-seismic activities, wind, visitors walking, vehicular traffic and construction works, should be taken into account. The session collects all the contributions, both theorical and experimental, devoted to this field, ranging from general issues to specific case-studies.\n\nThe main topics faced by the session include:\n\n- Dynamic monitoring and/or analysis of masterpieces, artifacts and art collections\n\n- Dynamic monitoring and/or analysis of historical-monumental buildings\n\n- Dynamic monitoring and/or analysis of Museums\n\n- Seismic assessment of masterpieces, artifacts and art collections\n\n- Seismic assessment of historical-monumental buildings\n\n- Design of innovative devices for increasing the seismic safety of art collections and monumental building\n\nThe use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in developing predictive models towards the design and assessment of structures is gaining significant momentum. This minisymposium aims to serve as an ideas exchange hub that will help scientists to share their current research work on AI and ML algorithms that have as a main objective the development of:\n\n1. algorithms for automatic extraction of closed form design formulae,\n\n2. machine learning models for the assessment and design of structures and materials,\n\n3. data analytics, visualization and interpretation algorithms dealing with the mechanical behaviour of structures\n\nOne of the main objectives of this minisymposium is to generate a broad discussion on how AI and ML algorithms can be utilized in assisting towards establishing a safer built environment in both low and high seismically active countries.\n\nSeismic nonlinear response history analysis is the most powerful tool for evaluating the seismic behaviors of structural systems, and plays a key role in many earthquake engineering studies. Meanwhile, many aspects of nonlinear response history analysis and their practical applications are still in need of further research. These have motivated the proposal of this mini-symposium. The aim of this mini-symposium is to bring together different ideas from around the globe on seismic nonlinear response history analysis. Hopefully, the attendees will leave the mini-symposium with good memories from the COMPDYN and Greece, as well as new scientific achievements, and plans for nice papers as special issues in the prestigious journals (to be later set and announced by the organizers of this mini-symposium). Abstracts on all aspects of response history analysis are very welcome to this mini-symposia.\n\nKnowledge, preparedness, prevention, and mitigation of seismic risks are central to the work of numerous scientific and engineering communities in Europe and beyond, driven by the significant loss of life, property, and infrastructure experienced in recent decades. In the face of ongoing disruptive climate changes, both natural and human-induced hazards increasingly affect urban areas and communities. It is now recognized that safeguarding human settlements and natural heritage from natural hazards requires a holistic and comprehensive approach, considering the potential simultaneous occurrence and interaction of various hazards. This principle forms the basis of the RETURN project—Multi-risk Science for Resilient Communities under a Changing Climate, funded by the NextGenerationEU Program of European Union.\n\nThis Minisymposium seeks to promote discussion on the seismic response of structures that have previously been impacted by other natural or human-induced hazards (such as volcanic activity, landslides, ground instability, fires, and floods), as well as on the response of structures to such hazards following an earthquake.\n\nWhile the primary focus is on analytical and numerical investigations, contributions on related topics, including impact chains, risk management, population preparedness, multi-criteria analysis of mitigation actions, and civil protection activities, are also welcome.\n\nThis minisymposium will explore the synergies between earthquake, wind and geotechnical engineering through experimental testing, facilitated by the Engineering Research Infrastructures for European Synergies (ERIES) project. ERIES is a transnational access project connecting leading experimental facilities across Europe and Canada. The project enables the research community to access physical and numerical facilities, as well as to share and develop new methods for seismic, wind and geotechnica engineering. The minisymposium will provide an overview of the research that is being conducted through ERIES, with a focus on loss-driven design and mitigation approaches, risk quantification and prioritisation, and green and sustainable development. It will include presentations from user groups detailing their progress to date. The minisymposium will also highlight the latest advances in experimental testing related to seismic and wind engineering, and discuss best practices and future directions for research. This session is aimed at researchers and other professionals interested in earthquake and wind engineering, as well as anyone interested in learning more about ERIES.\n\nMany Reinforced Concrete (RC) buildings in seismic-prone regions were constructed before the implementation of current seismic regulations and therefore do not adhere to modern anti-seismic design philosophies. As a result, the structural safety of these buildings is often inadequate when subjected to seismic forces, posing significant risks to renovation investments in the event of an earthquake. Replacing existing buildings with new, compliant structures is not economically feasible and would entail substantial environmental and social repercussions.\n\nAlso, masonry infill walls play a critical role in modifying the seismic response of RC buildings. Their irregular distribution can lead to various failure mechanisms. Most existing structures were not designed to account for the effects of masonry infill walls, which significantly increases their vulnerability. Nevertheless, the high out-of-plane vulnerability of these infill walls has been responsible for numerous collapses, casualties, and economic losses during seismic events. Extensive numerical and experimental research is being conducted to understand how different parameters of these infill walls affect their seismic performance.\n\nMoreover, considering the impact of buildings on global energy consumption, future renovation efforts must address both seismic and energy performance improvements. This special session will feature presentations followed by a round-table discussion, focusing on several key topics including but not limited to:\n\nSeismic performance assessment methodologies of RC structures\n\nExperimental testing and numerical simulation of RC individual elements and/or RC frames\n\nExperimental and numerical studies on the seismic behaviour of masonry infill walls and/or infilled RC frames\n\nIndependent or integrated retrofit techniques for reinforced concrete frame structures\n\nCost-effectiveness evaluation of retrofitting strategies at regional or national levels\n\nBy addressing these topics, the session aims to advance the knowledge and application of integrated retrofitting approaches, ensuring the structural integrity and sustainability of buildings in seismic zones.\n\nMasonry structures and infrastructures worldwide pose a significant concern for seismic safety. These structures are highly susceptible to both structural and non-structural damage, potentially leading to collapses under medium to strong seismic events. Over the years, this vulnerability has resulted in numerous fatalities and substantial economic losses, prompting the development of various methods for seismic assessment and retrofitting.\n\nIn this context, Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) and Non-Destructive (ND) testing are crucial, as they provide essential information on building conditions and existing damage, enabling the formulation of appropriate remedial measures. Additionally, recent experiences with reconstruction and retrofitting have underscored the necessity for innovative, practical, and cost-effective seismic strengthening solutions.\n\nFrom this perspective, the scientific community has developed various approaches to achieve a comprehensive description of historical masonry structures and infrastructures. Additionally, recent advances in data science, particularly in artificial intelligence, neural networks, and machine learning techniques, assist in processing large volumes of data and the complex methodologies required to address inherent uncertainties.\n\nThis mini-symposium aims to discuss the new advances in the conservation and preservation of masonry structures and infrastructures, plain or strengthened, with specific applications to cultural heritage. Topics to be covered, but not limited to, are:\n\n• Constitutive models for masonry materials\n\n• Comparisons of different modelling strategies\n\n• Structural assessment\n\n• Homogenization techniques\n\n• Multi-scale analysis\n\n• SHM in earthquake, flood, and landslide-prone regions\n\n• Structural Dynamic identification methods and uncertainty quantification\n\n• Continuous dynamic monitoring techniques\n\n• Damage detection, localization, and quantification\n\n• Automated model updating\n\n• Digital Twins\n\n• Bayesian methods\n\n• Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques\n\n• Big data analytics, interdisciplinary ways of making sense out of data\n\n• Restoration, requalification and retrofitting strategies\n\nPredicting the dynamic behavior of periodic structures via advanced numerical methods is a challenging problem which has gained large popularity over the past decades. This includes the analysis of resonant metamaterials with band gap phenomena where the need of efficient numerical methods is becoming crucial, e.g., for fast reanalysis and design of engineering systems with optimized vibration levels. In this framework, this minisymposium aims at discussing advanced modeling strategies for periodic structures and metamaterials with complex cells like those encountered in practical engineering applications. These cells can represent 2D or 3D substructures or multi-physic subsystems that usually involve many internal and boundary degrees of freedom. In this context, the development of reduced order models is becoming crucial to undertake numerical simulations in affordable times. The topics of the minisymposium include:\n\nWave-based approaches: wave finite element (WFE) method, plane wave expansion (PWE) method, Bloch mode expansion, energy-based methods…\n\nNearly periodic structures, substructures with parametric changes, uncertainties.\n\nNonlinear periodic structures.\n\nModel reduction strategies.\n\nSeismic performance of non-structural components (NSCs) in buildings is currently one of the hottest topics in structural engineering, considering that their seismic response turned out to have a high impact on the life safety and economic losses. Some NSCs may directly affect the serviceability of buildings (partition walls, piping systems), whilst other NSC typologies have direct and indirect economic and social consequences (artistic assets) as well as safety issues (equipment in nuclear power plants). In all cases, according to the NSC sensitivity to dynamic actions (to floor accelerations, displacements, or both), the correct definition of the seismic demands is needed both for design and assessment purposes, and it is commonly provided in terms of floor response spectra (FRS). The most important factors that influence FRS have been recognized by the scientific community, and there is a constant tendency to improve the state-of-knowledge on them. In this field, the main goal of the research efforts is to provide engineers with more accurate but simple approaches for the NSC seismic design and assessment. At the same time, significant efforts are still required to provide the practitioners with seismic performance parameters, obtained from experimental testing or advanced numerical analy`ses, useful in the performance-based seismic design framework.\n\nThis Minisymposium aims to promote and share the latest achievements about the definition of the seismic demands to which NSCs are prone and the assessment of their performance both through advanced numerical analyses and experimental testing.\n\nThe expected contributions may include (but are not limited to):\n\n- Numerical and experimental studies on NSCs.\n\n- FRS in new and existing structures.\n\n- Methodologies for the performance-based seismic design of NSCs.\n\n- Assessment of NSCs in existing structures.\n\n- NSCs response in elastic and inelastic field.\n\n- Monitoring techniques for NSCs.\n\n- Retrofit solutions for seismic risk mitigation.\n\n- Approaches and provisions in design codes.\n\nExisting structures designed/constructed without modern seismic design provisions represent one of the largest seismic safety concerns worldwide. Such structures are vulnerable to significant structural and non-structural damage and even collapse when subjected to medium-to-strong ground shaking. This resulted in number of fatalities and significant economic losses, which promoted the development of seismic assessment and retrofit procedures for existing structures.\n\nRecent devastating earthquakes pointed out the need for new, practical, and cost-effective seismic strengthening solutions that can be applicable at regional and with minimum level of disruption to the occupants. Over the past three decades, several techniques emerged. Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP), Fiber Reinforced Cementitious Matrix (FRCM), High Performance Fiber Reinforced Cementitious Composites (HPFRCC) composites, base isolation, dissipative devices, low-damage systems gained popularity as attractive solutions for repair and retrofit of civil infrastructures. They are successfully used for strengthening/rehabilitation of existing buildings and bridges. However further research effort is needed to improve their effectiveness, develop new applications, numerical modelling, design procedures, and techniques for installation. Furthermore, computational efficient simulations are needed to assess the benefits of seismic risk mitigation strategies at regional scale.\n\nIn this context, the mini symposium intends to attract academic staff, researchers, post-graduate students and professional engineers dealing with seismic repair and retrofit of structures, such as buildings and bridges, with innovative materials or with innovative seismic devices. The refinements in the analysis, assessment of residual capacity, design procedures and simulation to assess the benefits of interventions at regional scale are of particular interest.\n\nTo guarantee the safety of roadway and railway networks, transport authorities’ operators daily perform structural safety assessments of existing bridges and viaducts, dealing with several challenges. First, in developed countries such as Italy and Greece, there is a significant number of existing bridges, which were designed in the past according to obsolete design codes, in need of appropriate structural assessment considering the current service needs. The multitude of bridges to be evaluated contrasts with the limited availability of financial resources, time, and manpower of transport authorities. Furthermore, bridge structural assessment should consider the detrimental actions of natural and human-induced hazard sources which, as shown by recent disasters, can affect the safety of bridges and were not appropriately considered by design prescriptions in the past. In addition, many existing bridges located in aggressive environments suffer degradation phenomena severely impacting the structural capacity of bridge components.\n\nTo prevent relevant economic losses and to safeguard life safety, the definition of reliable risk-informed prioritisation and assessment to address mitigation strategies on critical bridges is essential. To this scope, different levels of investigation are required, from the large-scale screening of bridge portfolios to the detailed bridge-specific assessment. To this scope, the scientific community is called upon to develop new methodologies for efficient structural assessment approaches to be implemented in bridge management systems and possibly supported by advances in new technologies (e.g., remote-sensing approaches, sensor-based monitoring) or novel computational strategies (e.g., machine-learning techniques).\n\nThis Minisymposium aims to promote and share the latest research advances and achievements in risk-informed prioritisation, assessment, and mitigation to ensure the safety of existing bridges. The expected contributions may include (but are not limited to):\n\nInnovative methodologies for onsite bridge inspection;\n\nPhotogrammetry, 3D lidar scanning, and point cloud processing for bridge digital twinning;\n\nAutomatic defect detection using artificial intelligence algorithms.\n\nMonitoring techniques for bridges;\n\nAdoption of monitoring and onsite inspection data for refined finite element modelling calibration;\n\nRisk-informed prioritisation considering multiple hazard sources;\n\nAdvances in bridge structural assessment;\n\nNumerical and experimental studies on structural behaviour of bridge components;\n\nMaintenance and retrofit solutions for risk mitigation;\n\nCost/benefit analyses aimed at the identification of the optimal retrofitting solution.\n\nThe seismic resilience of structures and bridges has become an important parameter in earthquake engineering. In this regard, it is well known that the effects of the soil structure interaction may reduce the resilience of the systems. Therefore, it is non conservative to neglect SSI in the assessments of the seismic resilience of structures. The session aims to discuss the novel approaches that can assess the seismic resilience together with the consideration of the effects of SSI. Contributions from structural and geotechnical arena are both welcomed in order to discuss the state of the art and new perspectives.\n\nThe mini symposium \"Interpretable Machine Learning for Natural Hazards, Exposure, and Risk Modelling\" aims to address the critical need for transparency and explainability in the application of advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques to natural hazard, exposure, and risk modelling. Despite the versatility of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models for engineering applications, the practicing communities face challenges in implementing these due to their Blackbox nature. Hence it is critical to provide sufficient analytics for model interpretability and its response in terms of predictions based on variability in the inputs. Transparent/translucent models not only enable better decision-making, foster trust among stakeholders, and ensure better safety measures but are also easier to debugging and regulating.\n\nWith the emergence of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and physics/domain-informed ML, various concepts and algorithms have been developed that improve the understanding of AI systems output and operation, such as global and local feature importance-based metrics, game-theory-based algorithms, physics-informed optimization, physics-informed neural networks, counterfactual and contrastive example-based techniques, and causal inferences. The symposium focuses to bridge the gap between advanced ML/DL methods and their practical, interpretable applications in the field of natural hazard, exposure, and risk modelling.\n\nKey topics include (but are not limited to) the application of XAI and physics/domain-informed ML/DL for:\n\nEarthquake Early Warning Systems.\n\nGround Motion Modelling and Ground Motion Simulations.\n\nProbabilistic Hazard Analysis (for Earthquakes, Floods, Winds, etc).\n\nStructural Health Monitoring.\n\nSurrogate Modelling of Structures.\n\nMulti-Hazard Modelling and Analysis.\n\nExposure Modelling.\n\nPerformance-Based Engineering.\n\nRisk-Based Design and Assessment.\n\nCommunity Infrastructural Modelling.\n\nThis mini symposium invites contributions that highlight advancements in the interpretability of ML/DL models through XAI and/or physics-informed modelling, case studies demonstrating practical applications, and innovative methodologies that enhance the reliability and transparency of predictive modelling in the context of mitigation of natural hazards and structural modelling.\n\nPrecast concrete buildings were observed to be affected by significant damage following the recent strong earthquakes around the world.\n\nThe conducted surveys highlighted how the most widespread damages resulted in loss of support of horizontal structural elements caused by the absence of mechanical connections, overturning of closure external panels due to collapse of the connection with the structure, as well as damage to several non-structural elements.\n\nParticular attention should be therefore paid to the seismic safety of structures constituted of precast elements.\n\nThe goal of this Minisymposium is to address several gaps still present in the current literature, concerning the design of precast concrete buildings, seismic performance of existing and retrofitted structures, their numerical modelling, experimental data and life cycle environmental impact, among other aspects.\n\nThe Minisymposium aims to collect contributions from researchers, practitioners and manufacturers on the latest advancements in the field of precast constructions. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n1. Proposals of new seismic design concepts, for instance related to dowel-based connections;\n\n2. Retrofitting solutions, of the traditional (e.g. concrete jacketing) or innovative type (e.g. dissipation-based interventions);\n\n3. Seismic assessment of existing and retrofitted, single-storey and multi-storey buildings;\n\n4. Local and global modelling strategies;\n\n5. Experimental campaigns;\n\n6. Life cycle environmental impact of buildings and retrofitting solutions;\n\n7. Seismic vulnerability of nonstructural elements typically employed in precast industrial buildings, such as external and internal panels, equipment, supports for gas or liquid distribution systems, racks, electrical cabinets, tanks.\n\nThe introduction of engineered wood products (Glulam, Cross Lam, Laminated Veneer Lumber, etc.) has offered new possibilities and encouraged a massive use of timber-based elements in the last decades, making timber-based systems with wide possibilities of use in seismic-prone areas. Moreover, the peculiarities of material sustainability, to be ecofriendly and carbon removal offer high potentialities against the climate changes and for reducing the impact of the construction in urbanised areas. Thus, the excellent seismic response together with their environmental sustainability and energetic efficiency, have stimulated a huge use of timber systems not only in countries particularly devoted to the timber practice (i.e., North America, Japan, Australia, and North Europe) but also in the Mediterranean basin area. In addition to long-span roofs, bridges and floors, timber elements are effectively used to realize highly performing timber structural systems for commercial and residential destinations in seismic zone. Nowadays, studies concerning alternative and innovative uses of timber elements are ongoing by the scientific community. Among these, timber elements used for combined seismic and energetic retrofit of existing masonry and reinforced concrete buildings, innovative connection systems, vertical additions on existing masonry and reinforced concrete buildings, new structural elements, high-rise timber buildings.\n\nThis minisymposium welcomes contributions that focus on (i) theoretical, experimental and numerical results concerning the seismic behaviour of engineered timber buildings and its subassemblies; (ii) seismic behaviour of mechanical and carpentry connections and their effect on the overall seismic response of the buildings; (iii) timber systems for retrofitting existing masonry and reinforced concrete buildings; (iv) restoration techniques and testing for existing timber structures in seismic-prone area; (v) vertical additions; (vi) high-rise timber buildings, (vii) code practices: recent advancements and urgent needs.\n\nEnhancing resilience to earthquake events involves an in-depth understanding and quantification of risk along with a continuous effort to improve the reliability of infrastructure and communities against such hazards. Recent seismic events across the world, including Turkey and Taiwan, stress the need to better understand the interconnections among the experienced regional seismic hazards, the infrastructure’s performance and the community’s ability to prepare, respond, and recover from such disasters. In such complex interactions, several uncertainties need to be addressed at a systems’ level to offer a better understanding of the interventions necessary to achieve a more resilient state. Current efforts extend in multiple directions, including: (1) onsite investigations either in a pre- or post-disaster setting, to record the responses of the infrastructure inventory along with the community’s actions to better understand the impact that such events have, and inform retrofitting and building regulations, (2) use of novel numerical and computational models to better simulate both the hazard and the infrastructure inventory response, in some cases using machine learning and artificial intelligence in order to robustly address the associated uncertainties and (3) community preparedness, such as emergency planning and early warning systems, community response, including rapid damage assessment, and recovery. Such efforts collectively, aim to reinforce the resilience of seismic-prone regions, by better informing them of the different ways that such an imminent disaster can be mitigated fast and with minimal disruptions/fatalities.\n\nThis Mini-Symposium aims to promote and share the state-of-the art approaches to reliability estimation for structural systems and their components, along with the quantification of seismic risk, using novel methodologies that aim to improve the resilience of communities against such events.\n\nThe expected contributions to this Mini-Symposium may include (but are not limited to):\n\n• (Community-level) Seismic Risk Assessment\n\n• (Community-level) Infrastructure Inventory Reliability Assessment\n\n• Resilience and sustainability of infrastructure against earthquakes (including metrics, ways to integrate them and quantify them simultaneously)\n\n• Pre- and post-disaster assessments\n\n• Digital Twins/ Surrogate modeling / Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques for risk and reliability estimation\n\n• Risk Design and Assessment of infrastructure (including powerline/gas networks, transportation, water supply, etc.).\n\n• Structural Reliability and Probabilistic Methods\n\nSeismic mitigation design, based on techniques such as energy dissipation and base isolation, is aimed at preventing structural damage, increasing life-safety and achieving a desired level of performance. The successful implementation of these techniques was made possible by the progress in the technology of anti-seismic devices, such as hysteric and hydraulic dampers, and isolation bearings. However, the remarkable potential of these strategies can be further broadened and refined to meet the demands of a more resilient society. Consequently, the search for improved solutions and more effective design procedures is the object of ongoing cutting-edge research.\n\nThe Minisymposium aims to engage academics, researchers, practitioners and manufacturers, by displaying progresses and highlighting research needs in the field of seismic mitigation systems for buildings and infrastructures. It will present the latest contributions aimed at enhancing current technologies and retrofit strategies, with the goal of fostering a discussion on the future developments of seismic code prescriptions. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:\n\nexperimental assessment of novel base isolation and energy dissipation systems;\n\nrisk analysis of structures equipped with seismic mitigation systems;\n\ndesign procedures for seismically upgrading existing structures;\n\nadvances in numerical modelling and simulations of the real experimental response of seismic isolation and energy dissipation systems;\n\nrecent developments in standards and codes.\n\nCivil infrastructures have gained great importance for local and regional economies because of the major role of communication and networking in modern society. The accurate assessment of their integrity from a comprehensive perspective is, indeed, increasingly encouraged by stakeholders and governments. In this regard, the behaviour of critical assets such as bridges represents a key issue when analysing the resilience of transportation networks and the evaluation of their performance decay over time allows for avoiding catastrophic events. This symposium aims to contribute to structural degradation analysis, structural health monitoring and network resilience assessment. The subjects addressed are considered fundamental bullet points to consider for a broad resilience assessment and for retrofit interventions design of infrastructures at both local and global levels.\n\nThe topics included in this symposium include, but are not limited to:\n\nTraditional monitoring techniques to detect damage or degradation\n\nNumerical models for the analysis of the effects of degradation on structural performances of bridges\n\nAdvanced performance decay analysis of bridges over their lifespan\n\nStructural health monitoring, also by the use of interferometric satellite data\n\nSmart monitoring by using machine learning techniques\n\nData-driven or Model-based algorithms for structural health monitoring\n\nMonitoring by means of photogrammetric technologies (e.g. crack detection or digital image correlation) and Computer Vision approaches\n\nResilience assessment for networks of infrastructures\n\nConsidering the numerous factors influencing environmental changes, engineers and researchers are increasingly confronted with challenges in developing sustainable constructions. A comprehensive understanding of the behavior of new structural materials is essential. Key design issues include the computational modeling of construction materials incorporating recycled components, the behavior of structural elements composed of diverse materials, the modeling of interfaces between different materials, and the application of innovative materials in structural elements.\n\nThis minisymposium will showcase recent advancements in this field, drawing together academics, researchers, students, and professional engineers. The scope of discussion will encompass, but is not limited to, the following topics:\n\nBehavior of Reinforced Concrete with Recycled Aggregates: Utilizing advanced computational modeling techniques to explore the structural performance and durability of reinforced concrete elements made with recycled aggregates, highlighting advancements in recycling techniques and the reduction of construction waste.\n\nModeling Techniques for Multi-material Elements: Developing sophisticated computational models to investigate the structural behavior and integration of elements made from a combination of materials, such as timber-concrete composites and hybrid steel-concrete structures, to enhance sustainability and performance.\n\nLaboratory Testing Protocols: Defining and simulating standardized laboratory tests using computational tools to evaluate the mechanical properties, durability, and environmental impact of sustainable construction materials.\n\nStrengthening of Existing Constructions: Employing computational simulations to optimize the use of sustainable materials and innovative techniques, such as fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP) and ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC), for the retrofitting and strengthening of existing structures.\n\nDesign of Non-standard Construction Materials: Leveraging computational modeling to design and analyze the use of non-traditional and sustainable materials, including rammed earth, bamboo, and bio-based composites, in structural applications to promote environmental sustainability and resource efficiency.\n\nThis minisymposium aims to foster knowledge exchange and collaboration, advancing the frontiers of sustainable construction practices and contributing to the development of eco-friendly building solutions through state-of-the-art computational modeling.\n\nEarthquakes can cause significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, with subsequent direct and indirect impacts. Several procedures are available to assess and/or design assets to ensure satisfactory levels of seismic safety. However, comparatively fewer procedures also integrate additional society requirements such as environmental sustainability. Moreover, only a few procedures allow considering the exacerbation of impacts due to additional hazards in close temporal proximity to an earthquake. Existing literature on cascading effects shows that the combination of multiple events can lead to higher impacts than the sum of those of the individual hazards. In other words, these multi-hazard scenarios should be integrated into frameworks aimed at quantifying different typologies of impacts, including environmental (e.g., carbon emissions), economic (e.g., replacement costs) and social (i.e., well-being losses) impacts. To tackle the challenges of designing and maintaining structures exposed to multiple events, it is crucial to develop multidisciplinary approaches that integrate these factors into retrofit or new design.\n\nThis minisymposium brings together researchers and practitioners to share their expertise in analysing buildings and infrastructure subject to earthquakes and other hazards, paving the way towards a shift in standard approaches to risk modelling. We welcome any application surpassing traditional/conventional practices in earthquake risk modelling, including but not limited to (a) decision-making methods coupling earthquake consequences with other dimensions (e.g., energy cost); (b) multi-hazard risk assessment involving earthquakes as the “primary” hazard and capturing realistic multi-hazard interactions; (c) consequence-based design of new assets or retrofitting. The target audience for this session includes academics, researchers and professionals from various fields, including architecture, civil engineering and sustainability. The session also appeals to policymakers and stakeholders involved in planning, designing and maintaining eco-friendly, safe and resilient systems.\n\nThe global priority for a resilient and sustainable built environment is clear. In seismic-prone areas, this means improving seismic safety and energy efficiency while reducing embodied carbon of buildings. Achieving these goals requires adopting resilient technologies to minimize post-earthquake damage and related socio-economic and environmental impacts. These technologies should adopt natural-based materials and plug-and-play systems to reduce construction and demolition waste, considering demolition, recyclability and waste minimization in a circular and life-cycle perspective. Efforts are now increasingly directed towards sustainable building designs for nearly-zero energy or net-zero carbon structures. However, renovating existing buildings in a low-carbon manner also remains a significant challenge, yet essential for driving the development of future-proof, safer buildings that align with current policy targets.\n\nThis mini-symposium focuses on the development and implementation of damage-control low-carbon technologies. We welcome applications on innovative solutions, including but not limited to: (a) Integrated design of earthquake-proof and environmentally sustainable technologies for new buildings and retrofitted solutions, encompassing local to global intervention strategies; (b) Experimental studies and/or numerical modeling of resilient structural and non-structural technologies; (c) Case study applications and comparisons with conventional solutions. The target audience includes academics, researchers and professionals from various fields, including architecture, civil engineering and sustainability, who are interested in designing, constructing and maintaining eco-friendly, safe and resilient systems.\n\nBridge structures are fundamental components for the transportation system of a nation. In many cases, these structures are close to or have already exceeded their design life and an advanced deterioration state can be observed. Deterioration and lack of proper maintenance have been important factors in bridge collapses observed in recent years, as occurred in 2018 for the Morandi Bridge in Italy. As a consequence, the activities of structural management and assessment, together with the definition of advanced maintenance programs, pose a significant challenge to bridge owners. The situation is furthermore complicated by the safety level led by older design codes, which results to be significantly lower than what is provided by modern standards.\n\nThe present Mini-symposium aims at promoting the discussion on the challenges that have to be faced in assessing existing bridge structures, also considering the presence of deterioration phenomena, and to share the most recent advances in the assessment and retrofit approaches developed by both the research community and practitioners.\n\nThe topics of the Minisymposium include (but are not limited to):\n\nAdvances in bridge assessment approaches\n\nMaintenance, repair and retrofit of existing bridges\n\nNumerical and experimental studies on the effects of deterioration on the structural performance\n\nNumerical and experimental studies on bridge components\n\nInnovative materials applications in bridge structures\n\nSeismic vulnerability and reliability of existing bridges, including or not including the time dependent response of the structure\n\nActive and passive seismic protection of bridge structures\n\nSeismic isolation and energy dissipation retrofit design\n\nAdvanced numerical modeling of bridge components\n\nSeismic Resilience of existing bridges\n\nService Life Design applications\n\nRecent earthquakes highlighted the vulnerability of unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings, constituting a significant portion of our cultural heritage. The seismic risk assessment of URM structures has proven to be challenging, as their behavior may involve the activation of both in-plane and out-of-plane mechanisms. Various modeling approaches were developed over the last few decades to address this critical issue related to the assessment of their seismic response, prediction of potential collapse mechanisms, and design of non-invasive and sustainable strengthening interventions.\n\nThis minisymposium will collect various studies exploring methodologies and tools for evaluating the seismic response and risk analysis of existing masonry buildings. It will offer the opportunity to present contributions covering different advanced and simplified methods within computational modeling techniques, analysis approaches, experimental investigations, and case studies focusing on the seismic risk assessment of ordinary and monumental URM structures. Submissions may also address restoration activities and traditional or innovative rehabilitation and strengthening techniques.\n\nResearch areas may include (but are not limited to) the following issues:\n\nComparison of different modeling strategies\n\nComparison of different seismic risk assessment approaches\n\nStructural dynamic identification methods and uncertainty quantification\n\nSustainable retrofitting solutions for masonry structures\n\nEfficiency of low-impact interventions\n\nParametric analyses for the optimization of effectiveness, costs, and impact of interventions\n\nComparison of the effects of traditional and innovative strengthening systems\n\nExperimental investigation and modeling of integrated interventions\n\nAnalytical and computational strategies for identifying and strengthening local mechanisms in masonry buildings, even based on parametric analysis and visual programming\n\nCharacterization of seismic input for atop local mechanisms\n\nConsideration of the soil-structure interaction in masonry structure modeling\n\nRocking response of masonry walls under earthquakes\n\nCase studies\n\nSeveral novel computational modeling approaches are currently available for capturing damage growth and fracture propagation in materials and structures. However, many of the available methods encounter major challenges, such as the elevated computational cost, need for extensive calibration and validation, uncertainty quantification in the model predictions, and more. This has led to the emergence of research directions focused on enhanced predictive modeling of damage and fracture phenomena, including several classes of deterministic, data-driven, and stochastic methods as well as methods that attempt to develop combinations of these methods. This minisymposium aims to provide a platform for discussion on the recent advancements in these methods, and offer an outlook on the current needs and future trends. Topics of interest include, but they are not limited to, the following:\n\nNumerical simulation techniques, such as continuum damage, phase-field, XFEM, cohesive zone methods, peridynamics.\n\nBrittle, cohesive and ductile fracture of materials and structures, including material characterization and model validation\n\nMachine learning and data-driven approaches to improve the accuracy of the prediction and efficiency of the computational solution\n\nMulti-scale modeling techniques to accelerate simulations across different length scales\n\nMulti-physics considerations including fluid transport, thermo-plasticity, chemo-mechanical couplings, etc.\n\nContinuous-to-discontinuous modeling formulations\n\nImprovements in nonlinear numerical solution algorithms\n\nStochastic analysis and uncertainty quantification in the context of damage modeling\n\nMicrostructured and soft materials, including biomaterials and polymers, are increasingly adopted in various high-tech applications due to their unique mechanical properties and adaptability. Metamaterials, engineered with precise geometrical configurations, exhibit extraordinary characteristics such as auxeticity, exotic elastic couplings, negative refraction, and tailored wave propagation. Heuristic-based approaches and shape and topology optimization techniques can be exploited to enhance the mechanical performance of these materials and structures, leading to innovative advancements across multiple domains.\n\nRecent research has extended to the design and modelling of periodic lattice-like solids with kinking prohibition directions, high fracture toughness micro-architectured materials, and indentationresistant microstructures. Soft materials, including biological tissues and hierarchical bio-inspired materials, are integral to applications in biomedical devices and flexible electronics due to their adaptability and biocompatibility. The complex behaviour of these materials under dynamic loads poses significant challenges and opportunities for researchers, as their mechanical integrity and performance can be significantly affected by external impacts such as vibrations, thermal fluctuations, and mechanical stresses.\n\nThis mini-symposium aims to address these challenges. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n• Vibrational Characterization Techniques: Computational models to analyse and predict vibrational responses of microstructured solids.\n\n• Dynamic Behaviour of Soft Materials: Investigating how vibrations affect the mechanical integrity and functional performance of soft, pliable materials.\n\n• Metamaterial Innovation: Exploring the vibrational and indentation resistance properties of novel metamaterial designs and their implications for future technologies.\n\n• Impact Mitigation Strategies: Developing techniques to mitigate adverse effects of vibrations in sensitive materials and structures.\n\n• Multiscale Modelling and Simulation: Bridging the gap between micro-scale material properties and macro-scale structural behaviours through advanced simulations.\n\n• Microstructure Design Based on Shape and Topology Optimization Techniques.\n\nModern probabilistic risk assessment procedures often require many nonlinear dynamic analyses to consider the (i) inherent aleatory uncertainties in the hazard and (ii) the epistemic uncertainties associated with the exposure and predictive engineering models. In this context, High-fidelity finite element models can faithfully describe the inelastic response, capturing all the essential features of the hysteretic behaviour even for large deformations, thereby supporting high-accuracy risk predictions.\n\nLarge numbers of deterministic analyses might become inevitable to fully consider the uncertainties associated with material properties, structural attributes, and seismic hazard. This leads to a high impractical computational cost for routine applications that may be needed to run in real-time for large-scale analyses or emergency management. Consequently, researchers have been incentivised to explore the use of low-fidelity models that approximate the structural behaviour, improving the computational efficiency in various structural dynamics problems, but that also introduce some biases that lead to a reduced degree of accuracy or resolution.\n\nExamples of low-fidelity models considered for earthquake engineering applications include (i) surrogate models, a pure data-driven approximation of the model outputs, and (ii) reduced order models, simplifying the original finite element models condensing dynamic degrees of freedom and simplifying hysteretic response characteristics. While low-fidelity models offer a significant speedup to assessment procedures, the corresponding estimation might be biased when compared to the ones obtained using higher-fidelity numerical models. Therefore, the fidelity of the structural models should strike the right compromise between the accuracy and the computational efficiency objectives.\n\nThis mini-symposium aims to provide a forum for researchers to discuss recent advances and results on low-complexity models to predict the global performance of structures under different types of loading conditions for the computational and structural dynamics community. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:\n\nCalibration of Reduced Order Models (ROM) or Surrogate Models (SM)\n\nTechniques or probabilistic frameworks to reduce or adequately account for the biases related to the use of low-fidelity models\n\nValidation at the building level or a large geographical scale (with high-fidelity or empirical observations)\n\nApplications to different fields of structural dynamics (e.g., seismic, tsunami, debris flows)\n\nConstruction 3D printing is an emerging technology that has the potential to transform the construction industry by automating the construction process and pursuing new structural and architectural designs and forms that can optimize performance, aesthetics and functionality. Currently, printing with various materials, both cementitious, such as concrete, and metals has been achieved and large-scale structures have been built. Also, in an effort to reduce the carbon footprint of construction, there is a recent emphasis on printing with environmentally friendly materials, such as green concrete and hempcrete. Despite these advancements, methods to analyze, design, optimize and evaluate 3D printed components and structures remain an open question.\n\nThis Mini-Symposium aims to collect, promote and share the state-of-the art in these fields. Expected contributions to this mini-symposium may include (without being limited to):\n\n• Experimental evaluations at material, component and/or structural scales.\n\n• Optimization strategies for 3D printed components and structures\n\n• Analysis and Design methods for 3D printed components and structures\n\n• Numerical simulation techniques for 3D printed components and structures, including constitutive modeling and discretization techniques\n\nOver the past decade, structures and transport infrastructures have faced a number of significant safety issues, which have occasionally resulted in collapses that have had major social and economic impacts. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) techniques provide a logical solution for the detection of structural deterioration or damage through the assessment of changes in structural characteristics, including displacements, eigenfrequencies, damping factors and mode shapes, using on-site sensors. The recent advancements in interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) processing have significantly enhanced SHM by providing extensive satellite data for monitoring displacement rates of structures over large areas. A significant challenge in SHM is the minimisation of false positives, particularly in instances where minor frequency variations do not indicate actual damage. A substantial proportion of SHM systems focus on the correlation between damage and fluctuations in modal parameters. However, non-stationary inputs (such as wind and traffic) and stochastic environmental alterations can also influence modal parameters. It is therefore appropriate to employ statistical thresholds in order to distinguish between linear non-stationary behaviour and nonlinear structural damage. The objective of this MS is to explore strategies for integrating on-site and remote sensing data, establishing unified damage detection strategies, and discussing advancements in SHM techniques and algorithms. The programme will address a number of key topics, including information integration strategies, signal processing advancements, and case studies on structures, infrastructures, tunnels, dams, and cultural heritage sites.\n\nThe design of earthquake-resilient structures has been continuously enhanced in the last years, favouring the adoption of innovative systems and technologies to mitigate seismic effects. To this scope, well-established techniques already available on the market include passive and active vibration control systems based on base isolation and supplemental damping.\n\nA relevant topic is the development of devices and technologies aimed at favouring the re-centring of the structure. Examples include dampers with shape memory alloys, displacement gap devices, rocking systems, and variable friction sliding isolators. Another trend involves the proposal of both isolators and dampers featuring an adaptive force-displacement response and/or implementing an active control. Three-dimensional isolation systems, in parallel / in series combination of devices, and tuned mass dampers with inerters applied to case-studies are also matters that currently attracts interest. New design approaches are profiting of the recent spread of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms.\n\nThis Mini-Symposium (MS) aims to draw the interest of academics, researchers, and practitioners, by displaying recent progress in the field of seismic isolation and energy dissipation, and presenting the most recent contributions to the improvement of current technologies for vibration control of steel, RC and masonry structures and infrastructures, as well as timber buildings. The MS welcomes original research papers, presentation of case studies, and state-of-the-art reviews that include, but are not limited to, the following topics:\n\ninnovative anti-seismic devices with adaptive response;\n\ndevices with self-centring behaviour;\n\ndamping systems with inerters or active control;\n\nrocking systems implementing damping technologies;\n\n3D isolation systems (mitigation of vertical accelerations);\n\noptimization of anti- seismic devices by means of Artificial Intelligence;\n\ncombined systems (in parallel / in series);\n\nnumerical simulations and prototype testing;\n\napplications and case-studies.\n\nAs urban populations grow, cities face the challenge of accommodating diverse structures while increasing the spatial density of buildings. The traditional seismic analysis considers buildings as stand-alone structures, with no neighbouring structures. Yet dense urban configuration introduces a significant, often unquantified interaction between adjacent buildings through the underlying soil, known as Structure-Soil-Structure Interaction (SSSI). As a result, all modified seismic risks associated with interbuilding dynamic interactions through the soil are typically neglected. The difficulty of analysing groups of closely spaced buildings requires detailed geometric and material properties of existing and new structures. This potential risk to existing property owners represents an unquantified liability within the current seismic code framework. Thus, neglecting the increased seismic risk for some particular cases due to the coupling of adjacent buildings through the underlying soil is no longer reasonable.\n\nThis minisymposium focuses on addressing the leading developments of SSSI and Site-City Interaction effects (SCI), using different techniques such as:\n\n(i) Numerical methods (Finite Element Method, Boundary Element Method or hybrid Finite/Boundary Element Method),\n\n(ii) Analytical methods or reduced-order methods.\n\n(iii) Experimental methods (centrifuge and shaking table tests).\n\n(iv) Instrumented measurements of real structures and response spectrum.\n\n(v) Site-City Interaction (SCI) or city effects\n\nThe architectural heritage, which includes both monumental and ordinary masonry buildings, has stood the test of time for centuries, serving as a testament to cultural evolution. Preserving this heritage is thus crucial, as it plays an essential role in society. However, many of these buildings are located in areas prone to frequent seismic activity, posing a significant risk. There has been a growing interest in this topic recently, with approaches ranging from linear and nonlinear analyses of individual buildings to large-scale strategies. This has led to the development of tailored conservation methods.\n\nObjectives\n\nThis Mini-symposium aims at gathering contributions of leading researchers and practitioners to share and discuss the latest advancements in the seismic risk assessment and mitigation of historical masonry structures (both monumental buildings and historic centres). The session will provide a platform for exchanging innovative methodologies, case studies, and technological applications that improve our understanding and management of heritage structures threatened by seismic activity.\n\nThe main topics that this special session is intended to collect are, but not limited to:\n\nSeismic vulnerability assessment of historical masonry buildings at single-scale by means of numerical methodologies;\n\nSeismic vulnerability assessment (in both as-built and retrofitted conditions) with large-scale approaches and derivation of vulnerability and fragility curves;\n\nAdvanced methodologies for damage detection, localization, and quantification in heritage structures;\n\nNon-destructive testing for cultural heritage buildings;\n\nUtilization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in the analysis and management of cultural heritage sites;\n\nProposal of innovative retrofitting techniques for masonry buildings;\n\nStructural Health Monitoring (SHM) in seismic-sensitive historic regions;\n\nApplication of nonlinear analysis techniques to Cultural Heritage structures;\n\nMulti-scale analytical methods;\n\nExploring the impact of environmental and operational conditions on the integrity of architectural heritage;\n\nDetailed case studies demonstrating practical applications and outcomes.\n\nIn-service bridges are recognized as critical components of the transportation infrastructure, having been in operation for many years. These structures face challenges such as degradation, outdated regulations, and operating conditions different from those they were originally designed for, including the impacts of increased vehicle loads and climate change. Hence, assessing the vulnerability of existing bridges is crucial to identify critical situations where resources can be allocated effectively.\n\nIn this context, intervention prioritization strategies and the development of innovative retrofitting techniques assume strategic importance. Implementing innovative Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) solutions also plays a key role in maintaining bridge integrity and safety. Additionally, considering Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in the retrofit process ensures that sustainability aspects are integrated, minimizing environmental impacts and promoting long-term viability.\n\nFurthermore, enhancing resilience in the retrofit of bridges and other existing infrastructure is essential to adapt to future conditions and extend the life span of these critical assets. By incorporating resilient design principles and advanced technologies, infrastructure can better withstand adverse events and recover more quickly.\n\nThis session is organized under the auspices of FABRE (www.consorziofabre.it) and will promote the discussion of research results and design experiences regarding these crucial aspects of infrastructure management. Participants will explore strategies for vulnerability assessment, innovative retrofit solutions, SHM, LCA, and resilience improvement, contributing to the sustainable and efficient management of transportation infrastructure.\n\nEffective management of structural and infrastructure assets is critical to the longevity and reliability of critical services. This session will focus on the critical role of asset management in maintaining and improving infrastructure, considering both current and future challenges. Evolving conditions of use, driven by factors such as climate change and human activity, are impacting both existing structures and newly designed infrastructure. These new structures will need to adapt to changing conditions that could alter current regulations and engineering practices.\n\nKey issues include:\n\nPredictive maintenance: Advances in predictive maintenance that utilize data analytics and machine learning are changing the way infrastructure is managed. By anticipating failures and optimizing maintenance schedules, these techniques are helping to extend asset life and reduce downtime.\n\nImproving resilience through digital technologies: The integration of digital technologies, such as real-time monitoring and control systems, increases infrastructure resilience. These technologies enable continuous monitoring of the condition and performance of structures, allowing a rapid response to potential problems and better management of resources.\n\nSustainability issues: Sustainable infrastructure management practices are critical to reducing environmental impact and promoting long-term viability. Issues include the use of environmentally friendly materials, energy-efficient designs and strategies to minimize the carbon footprint of construction and maintenance activities.\n\nEvaluation of Appropriate/Optimal Retrofit Options: Selecting the best retrofit options is essential to prolonging the life of current infrastructure. This entails assessing several retrofit solutions according to criteria including cost, efficacy, and sustainability to guarantee best practices and efficient use of resources.\n\nBlockchain and Smart Contracts for Efficiency: Using smart contracts and blockchain technology can greatly improve infrastructure management's efficiency. Blockchain technology offers a transparent and safe means of tracking and managing assets, and smart contracts minimize errors and administrative overhead by automating procedures and transactions.\n\nThe discussion of research findings and design experiences pertaining to the management of both above-ground and underground transportation infrastructure is invited for this mini-symposium. Attendees will investigate how innovative research and useful design techniques may tackle the changing obstacles in infrastructure asset management, promoting social transformation, territorial integration, and economic growth.\n\nSteel storage racks, widely adopted in numerous industries globally for storage and organisational purposes, stand as indispensable elements in modern infrastructure. Their ubiquity reflects their exceptional versatility and efficiency in providing organised storage solutions. In virtually every corner of the world, steel storage racks find application in diverse sectors, including but not limited to warehousing, logistics, retail, manufacturing, and beyond. Such an important role played by racking and storage equipment in the European market can be strongly affected by low-probability/high-consequence events and in particular by earthquakes, as repeatedly shown by past seismic events in Italy and abroad.\n\nThe mini-symposium will interest any researcher or practitioner involved in the assessment, design and maintenance of steel storage racks, as well as industry stakeholders interested in promoting sustainable and innovative retrofitting solutions.\n\nThe mini-symposium welcomes original contributions on novel research proposals, case studies or advanced discussions on seismic risk assessment and retrofitting strategies for steel storage racks, such as:\n\nSimplified or detailed modelling techniques and tools\n\nFragility models for steel racks\n\nSeismic performance assessment of steel racks\n\nSeismic design and/or loss assessment of case-study steel racks\n\nInnovative and sustainable retrofitting solutions\n\nExperimental testing of steel racks and their sub-components\n\nIn recent years the scientific community has provided several tools aimed at assessing and managing risk using multi-level and multi-criteria approaches, the latter including the interaction among natural (such as seismic, hydrogeological, volcanic, etc) and anthropic (pollution, nuclear, etc.) risk factors. The trend denotes the rising awareness of the need of a holistic approach for risk assessment, based on the understanding of the factors contributing to the specific risk evaluated that are, as known: hazard (e.g., depending on location, intensity, frequency etc), vulnerability and exposure. In general, these factors may refer to different dimensions and scales. Dimensions may be related, as example, to the structural capacity of construction/infrastructure to withstand hazardous events, the social capacity of a community to recover from a disaster, or the territorial capacity to face the emergency and to allow rapid rescue services in the post-disaster emergency phase. Whereas, the scale refers to the level at which the assessment is conducted, moving from the individual construction/infrastructure/component, up to regions within an entire country. For instance, as for the territorial level, at first qualitative data are required in order to rank the risk by means of a certain resulting score. Then, a ranking list is obtained, from which more refined data and, consequently, more refined numerical simulations may be carried out. To this it should be added that within a multi-criteria framework, risk factors evaluated at different scales pose significative challenges because of their different knowledge domains, often suffering also inconsistencies in terms of methodology and glossary.\n\nThis special issue deals with recent advances in the multi-risk field, addressing specifically possible computational strategies for risk evaluation and mitigation focused on existing constructions, both ordinary and cultural heritage ones. Some topics, among the possible ones, relevant to this symposium are:\n\n• simplified and refined multi-level approaches seismic risk assessment, also combined with other risk factors;\n\n• analysis and creation of dynamic inventory reporting the systematic seismic damage suffered after an earthquake;\n\n• statistical analysis of seismic damage and simulation tools;\n\n• structural vulnerability;\n\n• fragility and consequence functions of structural and non-structural components;\n\n• risk-based design procedures for retrofit interventions;\n\n• analyses protection and mitigation against risk;\n\n• expected annual losses (EAL);\n\n• data concerning the effects on the economic system due to hazardous events at large and small scale;\n\n• structural vulnerability and fast appraisal methods.\n\nNonlinear dynamic analyses are becoming increasingly common in engineering practice to support the vulnerability assessment of existing buildings, structures and infrastructures. A central issue in nonlinear dynamic analyses is damping. Damping in structures refers to the ability of a system or structure to dissipate or absorb energy when subjected to dynamic loads. This can occur in several ways: a) Hysteretic damping, which is implicitly considered in the modeling of the inelastic response of the materials that characterize the structural elements (e.g., hysteresis loops of concrete and steel) when performing a nonlinear analysis (whether with distributed or with lumped plasticity); b) damping resulting from other non-negligible mechanisms such as friction, opening and closing of concrete cracks, thermal energy dissipation due to material heating, and other factors. Damping remains a challenging issues: Its mechanical meaning is still to be fully understood and its numerical modeling has a significant impact on prediction seismic demands on structures.\n\nThis Minisymposium aims to collect and discuss contributions focused on damping, both in its theoretical aspects and in applications and modeling.\n\nThe prediction of the seismic response is the key issue to bring to light deficiencies and qualities provided by the considered structural systems. This topic is of paramount importance for both new and existing conventional structures, but it becomes even more important when new structural systems or seismic protection devices are developed. On one hand, it is rather obvious that experimental tests, whether dynamic or cyclic tests, provide the most realistic, thus trustworthy, structural response of a considered case study. On the other hand, experimental tests require facilities that are not always available, or can be performed rarely on full scale specimens, but more often on rather small portions of the considered structure or only at component level. Based on this observation, the development of a numerical model represents a practical, as well as easily accessible, alternative to assess the structural response of the considered system. Indeed, numerical analysis can be performed many times, without any economic or material losses, can be used to determine the response of either full scale structures or single structural components, and is the only available tool to conduct wide parametric analysis. However, every numerical model entails unavoidable assumptions and simplifications, that affect the results. Hence, a very effective strategy, which gathers the advantages given by experimental tests and numerical modelling, is to develop numerical models and calibrate the parameters ruling the monotonic/cyclic response of the elements so that the numerical response match as well as possible the experimental one. On one side, this approach allows to develop reliable numerical models that can be used for further extensive analysis, on the other side exploits the realistic response of the experimental tests. The present Minisymposium aims at collecting and discussing contributions focused on (i) the development of numerical models, at building, sub-assembly or member/device level, able to fit the structural response determined by experimental tests, (ii) calibration strategies that can be followed to tune the parameters ruling the numerical model and (iii) possible approaches to evaluate the accuracy of the numerical model in predicting the experimental responses.\n\nOver the past twenty years, the global incidence of natural hazard-related disasters has nearly doubled compared to the preceding two decades. This increase primarily stems from the significant vulnerability of built environments, resulting in escalating impacts on economic and social sectors. Comprehensive assessment and understanding of disaster risks represent the basis for managing the entire cycle, encompassing prevention, forecasting, emergency response, recovery, and fostering adherence to safety-enhancing regulations and standards.\n\nThis minisymposium aims to showcase seismic fragility and vulnerability methodologies focused on assessing risk, predicting damage scenarios and ensuing consequences. Various approaches, including empirical methods, analytical or mechanical models will be explored. The discussions will evaluate the strengths and limitations of each approach in terms of their applicability and outcomes. The debate will handle the different methodological approaches and their implications, such as the uncertainty levels associated with different scales of application—whether at the level of individual buildings, at urban level, regional areas, or broader scales. It will also examine how the choice of intensity measures influences fragility assessment outcomes.\n\nThe relevant topics to this minisymposium include, but are not limited to:\n\nApplicability and results of different approaches for seismic vulnerability and fragility assessment.\n\nImpact of using different intensity measures (IM) on fragility assessment, considering the definition of \"efficient\" and \"sufficient\" IM, potentially handling also post-earthquake damage data.\n\nEffect of stratigraphical amplification in fragility assessment.\n\nUncertainty estimates in fragility results considering the scale of and/or the methodological approach.\n\nInfluence of aging and deterioration on vulnerability trends.\n\nIntegration of smart monitoring technologies (remote sensing, UAV) and machine learning in seismic capacity assessment and damage estimation.\n\nEffectiveness of shakemap or ground motion prediction equation in forecasting seismic hazard\n\nCase studies with a critical discussion about the accuracy level of exposure knowledge, ground motion characterization, and the methodological approach adopted.\n\nThe field of moving loads and interaction problems is an active area of research in structural dynamics, of particular interest to large civil structures such as railway and road bridges. In developed countries, the extensive amount of resources invested in such structures is an asset of principal value, that motivates the need to improve the theoretical bases and computational techniques for their optimal assessment and design. Such need is further strengthened by the relevant role played by civil infrastructures in current environmental concerns.\n\nA number of dynamic research areas are engaged in keeping the field of moving loads and interaction problems at the frontiers of knowledge. Those areas include advanced numerical simulation, improved mathematical methods and algorithms, simplified and refined formulations of the various interaction phenomena implicated in bridge dynamics, deterministic and stochastic approaches (both in time and frequency domains), characterisation of fast and ultra-fast vehicles (high-speed trains and maglevs), deployment of systems to mitigate vibration; and last but not least, innovative approaches for the assessment of venerable -but widespread- structures such as the masonry bridges.\n\nThe Minisymposium aims to collect state-of-art contributions from researchers and practitioners in the field of theoretical and numerical analysis of moving load and vehicle-bridge interaction problems. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n1. Closed-form solutions in advanced moving load problems\n\n2. Refined numerical modelling of bridge responses under moving forces\n\n3. Vehicle-bridge interaction (VBI) and track-bridge interaction (TBI) phenomena\n\n4. Soil-structure interaction (SSI) effects in road and railway bridge vibration\n\n5. Vehicle scanning methods for bridge characterisation\n\n6. Nondeterministic methods and surrogate modelling in moving load and interaction problems\n\n7. 3D modelling for VBI and running safety assessment of railway bridges\n\n8.

Discrete and continuous methods for simulation of masonry bridge dynamics\n\n11. Passive and active damping systems to supress moving-load induced resonance\n\n12. Open software for moving load and VBI analysis\n\nMost engineering structures are subjected to a great variety of dynamic loads in their lifetime. The latter can be caused by earthquake, wind, traffic, wave, blast, rotating machinery or other types of natural or anthropic events. The goal of structural engineering is to limit the damage of structures to achieve functional recovery and resilient design. In particular, the need is to meet acceptable performance levels at present and in the years to come without compromising the ability of future generations to use them, maintain them and benefit from them.\n\nIn order to achieve such goals, in addition to traditional approaches, structural engineers have introduced sophisticated dynamic response modification techniques and devices.

For small-to-medium scale structural components, piezoelectric-based absorbers coupled with energy harvesting circuitry are widely considered for transforming kinetic energy to usable electric energy, while dampening vibrations. For medium-to-large scale structures, electromagnetic motors commonly interface vibrating structures and energy harvesting circuits to enable kinetic energy scavenging from relatively low-frequency large-amplitude oscillations, sometimes amplified by rotational inerter-based mechanisms. Regardless of the scale and underlying technology, the efficiency of dynamic energy harvesters and inertial dampers relies on robust tuning of their properties in both the mechanical/structural and the electrical/circuit domains, which are heavily dependent on the naturally uncertain attributes of the vibrating structures and the dynamic excitation.\n\nIn this context, this Mini-Symposium focuses on the analytic/mathematical modelling, optimal design/tuning, and performance assessment, through simulations or experimental/field testing, of kinetic energy harvesting systems and inertial dampers in the presence of uncertainty to dynamic excitation and/or to system properties. Contributions may discuss mathematical uncertainty modeling aspects for dynamic energy harvesting systems and inertial dampers, computational and analytical methods for assessment and/or design of such systems, and experimental field or lab testing aiming to capture and quantify the behavior of such systems. Both theoretical studies as well as work related to practical engineering problems and focused applications are relevant to this Mini-Symposium. Finally, submissions identifying practical needs and unexplored niches on the development, design, testing, and deployment of regenerative inertial dampers in adverse and uncertain environments are welcome.\n\nExisting steel structures are typically exposed to multiple hazards, including earthquakes, wind and climate change effects. The structural response of such structures is also detrimentally affected by ageing effects which tend to jeopardize the pristine stiffness, strength and ductility and, in turn, their energy dissipation capacity. Current codes of practice worldwide provide simplified approaches for the structural assessment of existing steel structures; these code provisions exhibit a number of limitations for applications, especially for structural systems with ageing effects. Thus, there is an urgent need of robust and refined assessment methods to evaluate the structural performance of existing steel structures, plus quantify reliably financial losses. Accurate local response analysis for existing steel systems, e.g. including refined modelling for base-to-column and/or beam-to-column connections designed for gravity-loads only, requires further numerical and experimental investigations.\n\nCurrent assessment approaches are extensions of methods developed and corroborated for newly designed structures. Furthermore, they are often not adequately calibrated for existing steel systems, especially for those with corrosion and other deterioration effects (stiffness, strength, etc).\n\nExperts in the field of existing steel structures, especially those systems that are not conforming to modern design standards, are invited to contribute to this MS. Emphasis is on the limitations of current approaches for structural response analysis, plus proposing possible adaptations and identification of challenges to foster future experimental and numerical investigations. Use of advanced techniques of machine learning and AI-based methods to replace time-consuming experimental tests is also relevant for the MS.\n\nFinally, the MS intends to discuss state-of-art techniques for structural retrofitting for existing steel structures and proposing a roadmap for sustainable and resilient interventions.\n\nAccording to the capacity design requirements, earthquake resistant structures have the ability to dissipate energy in plastic mechanisms. Dissipative zones are designed to yield before others, that remain in the elastic range during the seismic action. The capacity design approach allows for a reduction of seismic forces through the seismic behavior factor, as it is assumed that dissipative elements yield and dissipate energy. The reduction of seismic actions involves a reduction in dimensions of structural members and therefore in the cost of the structure. Simultaneously, recent advanced dissipative devices are developed with the aim of ensuring an adequate dissipation of energy, provide stable hysteresis loops and, according to the Loss-Based Design, to be easily replaced after a seismic event. The minisymposium encourages the submission of research papers dealing with adopted/developed fuses of earthquake resistant steel structures, investigated through experimental tests, numerical models and analytical methods.\n\nTopics relevant to this minisymposium include, but are not limited to:\n\n1) Seismic protection devices for earthquake resistant steel structures;\n\n2) Innovative fuses capable of dissipate energy through stable hysteresis loops;\n\n3) Numerical models, experimental tests and analytical methods to simulate the structural response of investigated devices;\n\n4) Novel steel bracing systems.\n\nKeywords: Capacity design, Earthquake resistant steel structures, Bracing systems, Dissipative devices\n\nBridges play a crucial role in our society, and their collapse can result in significant economic and social losses. At the same time, ageing and deteriorating bridge infrastructure is becoming more vulnerable, as highlighted by recent bridge collapses. Additionally, climate change exacerbates these vulnerabilities, underscoring the importance of structural assessment, health monitoring, and retrofitting. Public institutions and infrastructure management entities have become more aware of these needs, part"
