        "text": "Evidence of active tectonic shortening in the Lake Garda area (Northern Italy) has been very well described in the geological literature for at least 40 years, mainly due to the extensive research conducted during the siting of nuclear power plants in Lombardia in the 80's. This area includes in fact the causative faults for some of the largest seismic events ever occurred in Northern Italy, i.e. the two medieval earthquakes of January 3rd, 1117 (Verona, Io = IX-X MCS) and the 25th of December, 1222 (Brescia, Io = IX-X MCS). More recently, two \"twin\" moderate events occurred at Salò on October 30th, 1901 (Io = VIII MCS) and November 24th, 2004 (Ml = 5.4). This is therefore a critical area for understanding the relationship between tectonic structures and earthquake source parameters in the Po Plain. We address this issue through new field data and airphoto interpretation, morphobathymetric investigations in South Lake Garda, and a systematic revision of published data. A new map of Quaternary faults is presented, that shows a good correlation between Quaternary deformations, major regional tectonic structures, and macroseismic information derived from local strong seismic events. Style and rates of activity of the proposed capable faults allow us to infer the typical seismogenic features of the characteristic seismic event for the Lake Garda region, which can be regarded as the controlling earthquake for the seismic hazard of the central part of the Po Plain.\n\nWe identify evidence of late Quaternary compressive tectonics in the Northern sector of the Central Po Plain through a systematic revision of the literature, new field mapping, and a new study of seismic reflection data obtained by ENI E&P. In particular, the reinterpretation of ca. 18.000 km of seismic profiles clearly shows a belt of segmented, 10 to 20 km long, fault propagation folds, controlled by the Plio-Quaternary growth of several out-of-sequence thrusts. As an example of this active structural style, in this paper we focus on a buried fold located just south of the Castenedolo Hill, a few km SE of Brescia. Although the Castenedolo anticline has long ago been described as a young compressional structure (e.g., DESIO, 1965), no detailed structural analysis of this feature has been performed until now. We calculated the uplift rates of this fold through the analysis of its syntectonic sedimentary record as imaged by the extremely high quality ENI E&P subsurface data available in the area. The evolution of this anticline was a discontinuous process characterized by several tectonic uplift pulses (with rates of ca. 0.1 mm/yr) of different duration, separated by periods of variable extent in which no fold growth occurred. The Quaternary growth history of this anticline and the presence of faulted and folded late Pleistocene to Holocene deposits at nearby sites (Ciliverghe and Monte Netto) demonstrate that the significant seismicity of this area (e.g., the December 25, 1222, Io = IX MCS Brescia earthquake, MAGRI & MOLIN, 1986; GUIDOBONI, 1986) must be related to active compressional structures within the Brescia piedmont belt. Our regional investigations show that the structural and paleoseismic setting illustrated near Castenedolo is typical of the whole Lombardia domain of the Southern Alps. This implies that the currently accepted seismotectonic model for this region, and related seismic hazard assessment, should be thoroughly and carefully re-evaluated.\n\nIn the foothills of the Southern Alps between Lake Garda and Lake Maggiore, the relations between the recent tectonic evolution and the accompanying seismic potential have been overlooked. Published interpretations of structures consider shortening to cease at the end of the Messinian; this is in contrast with geomorphic and stratigraphic evidence for Plio-Pleistocene reverse faulting and folding presented in this paper. Evidence for Quaternary shortening near Lake Garda includes Quaternary folds with 200 m of structural relief recorded by Lower- Middle Pleistocene deposits. These crop out on top of the Castenedolo and Ciliverghe Hills, within the epicentral area of the historical December 25, 1222 Brescia earthquake (epicentral intensity IX MCS, Me 6.2; GUIDOBONI, 2002). Shortening further west may also be occurring, but there is no record of local damaging historical earthquakes along the foothills of the Alps. This motivated us to review available data and undertake new reconnaissance field work, in order to better understand the Quaternary tectonic evolution of the Southern Alps near Lake Como in the Insubria region. We focused our studies on two major structures located east and west of Como, respectively, the Gonfolite backthrust and the Albese con Cassano anticline. The Gonfolite backthrust, first recognized by BERNOULLI et alii (1989) and reported as late Miocene in age, is accompanied by geomorphic features consistent with Quaternary compressional structures. Our new field mapping suggests that this thrust offsets deposits of Pliocene and possibly younger age. Neotectonic evidence for the recent evolution of Albese con Cassano anticline was first presented by OROMBELLI (1976). Our investigations confirm Orombelli’s observations, and suggest that the Albese con Cassano is an actively growing anticline that accumulated ca. 200 m of post-Middle Pleistocene vertical displacement. In addition, paleoliquefaction features in Mid-Pleistocene proglacial deposits at this site suggest that growth of this fold has been accompanied by strong local earthquakes. Evidence of Quaternary tectonics in the Insubria region is consistent with that observed in the well-known seismic area near Lake Garda. Therefore, the seismic potential of this area should be carefully re-evaluated based on the examination of available geological data and the results of new ad hoc paleoseismological analyses. Current assessment of seismic hazard, based only on the historical seismic catalog, supposedly heavily underestimates the earthquake potential in one of the most vulnerable areas of the whole Europe.\n\nA dense grid of petroleum industry seismic reflection profiles, coupled with field mapping, exploratory trenching and geomorphic and structural analysis are used to characterize the Quaternary growth history of the Capriano del Colle Fault System, one of several inferred active buried thrusts that extend across the Po Plain in northern Italy. Shortening is characterized here by a deeply buried south-vergent forethrust and an associated north-vergent backthrust whose upward propagation is expressed by fault-propagation folding near the surface. Structural interpretation based on seismic data suggests that strain is accommodated at very shallow levels by secondary flexural-slip thrusts and reverse faults developed on synclinal flanks that emanate from active axial surfaces. Analysis of syntectonic growth strata document maximum rates of dip-slip of 3.45 ± 0.66 mm/yr (1.6 Myr–1.2 Myr) and 0.47 ± 0.22 mm/yr during a more recent time period (0.89 Myr–present). A quarry excavation at Capriano del Colle allows a preliminary paleoseismologic analysis of coseismic surface faulting and liquefaction exposed near the core of an active mid-Pleistocene to Holocene anticline. These features are interpreted to be generated during strong local earthquakes, consistent with the environmental effects and ground motions of an event similar to the December 25, 1222, Brescia earthquake (Io = IX MCS). This indicates, for the first time, that compressive folds and blind thrusts in the Po Plain are currently accommodating slow rates of modern contraction in an active zone of the Southern Alps that extends from Lake Garda to Varese. We thus argue that earthquakes similar to the December 25, 1222 Brescia event are likely to occur in this region and pose a direct threat to such a densely populated and developed area."
