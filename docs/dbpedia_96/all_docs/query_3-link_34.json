Materials and Methods Study participants provided written informed consent to participate in this institutional review board–approved study. ECV was measured in healthy subjects and patients with heart failure by using cardiac CT and cardiac MR imaging. Paired Student t test, linear regression analysis, and Pearson correlation analysis were used to determine the relationship between cardiac CT and MR imaging ECV values and clinical parameters. Results Twenty-four subjects were studied. There was good correlation between myocardial ECV measured at cardiac MR imaging and that measured at cardiac CT (r = 0.82, P < .001). As expected, ECV was higher in patients with heart failure than in healthy control subjects for both cardiac CT and cardiac MR imaging (P = .03, respectively). For both cardiac MR imaging and cardiac CT, ECV was positively associated with end diastolic and end systolic volume and inversely related to ejection fraction (P < .05 for all). Mean radiation dose was 1.98 mSv ± 0.16 (standard deviation) for each cardiac CT acquisition. Conclusion ECV at cardiac CT and that at cardiac MR imaging showed good correlation, suggesting the potential for myocardial tissue characterization with cardiac CT. © RSNA, 2012",
