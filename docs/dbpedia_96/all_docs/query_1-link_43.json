        "text": "Recent research on the ties between the Venetian cardinal Pietro Ottoboni – a patron of music and the arts in Rome from the end of 1689 until 1740 – and the representatives of the European powers in Rome, has put into relief the ‘cultural lines of force’ that ran between him and the foreign nobility. Those relations changed over the course of time during the pontificates of Alexander VIII (1689-1691), Innocent XII (1691-1700), and Clement XI (1700-1721). In fact, Ottoboni’s patronage of music during these three decades is articulated in various ‘phases’, shaped by politics and historical events, but also by the ups and downs of the cardinal’s financial resources. Cardinal Ottoboni maintained strong relationships with the ambassadors thanks to both his diplomatic skills and his offering of musical events in which the very best singers, instrumentalists, and composers took part (Arcangelo Corelli, Alessandro Scarlatti, Giovanni Bononcini, Ottavio Pitoni). The foreign diplomats and aristocrats were received with great splendour at the Palazzo della Cancelleria, the cardinal’s residence, in which various theatres were in function at different times. These social events favoured the exchange of music, musical instruments, singers, instrumentalists, and composers between Rome and the rest of Europe. A focus on the ties between Ottoboni and the Portuguese nation throws into relief the climate of collaboration that favoured the exchanges between Rome and Lisbon in the field of music and the arts, as is shown, for instance, by the presence at the Roman church of S. Antonio dei Portoghesi of numerous musicians that were employed by the Venetian cardinal. At the same time, artists from Portugal found in Ottoboni an important point of reference in Rome, something that had a direct bearing on the dissemination of genres, styles, and musical instruments in Lisbon. We know, for example, that in 1718, in his capacity as protector of the Sistine Chapel, Ottoboni procured a range of music for Lisbon cathedral at the request of king John V. Using new archival sources, this paper investigates the possible collaboration between Ottoboni and the Portuguese ambassadors on the organisation of musical events.\n\nThis is the first dedicated study of the musical patronage of Roman baronial families in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Patronage - the support of a person or institution and their work by a patron - in Renaissance society was the basis of a complex network of familial and political relationships between clients and patrons, whose ideas, values, and norms of behavior were shared with the collective. Bringing to light new archival documentation, this book examines the intricate network of patronage interrelationships in Rome. Unlike other Italian cities where political control was monocentric and exercised by single rulers, sources of patronage in Rome comprised a multiplicity of courts and potential patrons, which included the pope, high prelates, nobles and foreign diplomats. Morucci uses archival records, and the correspondence of the Orsini and Colonna families in particular, to investigate the local activity and circulation of musicians and the cultivation of music within the broader civic network of Roman aristocratic families over the period. The author also shows that the familial union of the Medici and Orsini families established a bidirectional network for artistic exchange outside of the Eternal City, and that the Orsini-Colonna circle represented a musical bridge between Naples, Rome, and Florence. Keywords: Orsini family, Medici family, Colonna family, patronage of poetry and music in Rome (and Florence, ca. 1550-1656). The book also provides new information on various poets, singers, and composers, including Antonio Barre, Tommado Cimello, Giovanni dell'Arpa, Pietro Vinci, Diego Ortiz, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Hieronimo Tastavin, Giulio Cesare Brancaccio, Scipione delle Palle, Luca Marenzio, Piero Strozzi, Giovanni Battista Strozzi il giovane, Emilio de Cavalieri, Francesco Rasi, Giulio Caccini, Francesca Caccini, Cristofano Malvezzi, Torquato Tasso, Ottavio Rinuccini, Vittoria Archilei, Isabella Andreini, Onofrio Gualfreducci, Simone Ponte, Cesare Zoilo, Francesco Petratti, Giovanni Marciani, Carlo Rainaldi, Giovanni Rovetta, Francesco Manelli, Stefano Landi, Claudio Monteverdi, Luigi Rossi, Venanzio Leopardi (among many others)."
