He had minor facial anomalies and mild intellectual delay. He appears to be the youngest patient reported with this rare chromosome complement. His father, mother, and brother had normal chromosomes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on the propositus and his father with the Y chromosome heterochromatic probe (pHY3.4) to add to the evaluation of mosaicism. 17 refs., 3 figs., 2 tabs.\n\nBehavioral phenotype in a child with Prader-Willi syndrome and comorbid 47, XYY.\n\nPubMed\n\nPalkar, Pooja; Kabasakalian, Anahid; Taylor, Bonnie; Doernberg, Ellen; Ferretti, Casara Jean; Uzunova, Genoveva; Hollander, Eric\n\n2016-08-01\n\nWe report a 12-year-old male with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and 47, XYY syndrome.

For instance epidemiological data in 47,XYY persons are still limited. Methods Using a national Danish registry, we identified 208 persons with 47,XYY or a compatible karyotype, whereof 36 were deceased; all were diagnosed from 1968 to 2008. For further analyses, we identified age matched controls from the male background population (n = 20,078) in Statistics Denmark. We report nationwide prevalence data, data regarding age at diagnosis, as well as total and cause specific mortality data in these persons. Results The average prevalence was 14.2 47,XYY persons per 100,000, which is reduced compared to the expected 98 per 100,000. Their median age at diagnosis was 17.1 years. We found a significantly decreased lifespan from 77.9 years (controls) to 67.5 years (47,XYY persons). Total mortality was significantly increased compared to controls, with a hazard ratio of 3.6 (2.6-5.1). Dividing the causes of deaths according to the International Classification of Diseases, we identified an increased hazard ratio in all informative chapters, with a significantly increased ratio in cancer, pulmonary, neurological and unspecified diseases, and trauma. Conclusion We here present national epidemiological data regarding 47,XYY syndrome, including prevalence and mortality data, showing a significantly delay to diagnosis, reduced life expectancy and an increased total and cause specific mortality.

Methods Neuropsychological evaluation of general cognitive ability, language, memory, attention, visual-spatial abilities, visual-motor skills, and motor function. Results Study cohort: 21 boys with 47,XYY and 93 boys with 47,XXY (KS), ages 4-17 years, and 36 age-matched control boys. Both the XYY and KS groups performed less well, on average, than the controls on tests of general cognitive ability, achievement, language, verbal memory, some aspects of attention and executive function, and motor function. The boys with XYY on average had more severe and pervasive language impairment, at both simple and complex levels, and the boys with KS on average had greater motor impairment in gross motor function and coordination, especially in running speed and agility. Conclusions The results from these large XYY and KS cohorts have important neurocognitive and educational implications. From the neurocognitive standpoint, the presenting findings afford an opportunity to gain insights into brain development in boys with XYY and those with KS. From the educational standpoint, it is critical that boys with XYY or KS receive appropriate educational interventions that target their specific learning challenges. These findings also provide important information for counseling clinicians and families about these disorders.

Most cases of 47, XXX and 47, XYY syndromes are diagnosed in this context, and parents are thus faced with an unexpected situation. The objective of the present study was to characterize a French cohort of prenatally diagnosed cases of 47, XXX and 47, XYY and to evaluate the termination of pregnancy (TOP) rate before and after France's implementation of multidisciplinary centres for prenatal diagnosis in 1997. This retrospective study identified respectively 291 and 175 cases of prenatally diagnosed 47, XXX and 47, XYY between 1976 and 2012. For each case, the indication, maternal age, karyotype and outcome were recorded. Most diagnoses of the two conditions were fortuitous. The occurrence of 47, XXX was associated with advanced maternal age. The overall TOP rate was higher for 47, XXX (22.9%) than for 47, XYY (14.6%), although this difference was not statistically significant. However, the TOP rates fell significantly after 1997 (from 41.1% to 11.8% for 47, XXX and from 25.8% to 6.7% for 47, XYY). The TOP rates after prenatal diagnoses of 47, XXX and 47, XYY fell significantly after 1997, following France's implementation of multidisciplinary centres for prenatal diagnosis.

The patient was the 2,637 gram product of a 38 week gestation and elective repeat C-section born to a 35 year old G3P2 mother. The pregnancy was complicated by placenta previa. There was no history of maternal health problems or drug or steroid use. At birth bilateral epicanthal folds and overfolded helices were noted without webbing of the neck or lymphedema. There was a phallic structure measuring 1.5 cm with dorsal hood and midline cleft with a normal female introitus, urethra, and vagina. Congenital adrenal hyperplaxia was excluded.moreÂ Â» Renal ultrasound was normal. Periperal blood chromosomes revealed a mos45,X(38%)/47,XYY(29%)/48,XYYY(33%) karyotype. Echocardiography revealed coarctation of the aorta and a bicuspid aortic valve. An additional cell line, 46,XY, was identified in aortic tissue obtained at the time of surgery. At age 15 months she was 25% in height and weight and had bilateral ptosis. Her development was within normal limits, but no words except {open_quotes}Mama{close_quotes} or {open_quotes}Dada{close_quotes} were spoken. A left intraabdominal testis with epididymis and dilated tubules and bilateral Fallopian tubes were removed at laparoscopy/reconstruction. Cell cultures were initiated from gonadal tissue, and karyotypes are pending. Patients with mosaic Y chromosome aneuploidy involving 2 Y chromosomes are rare. Eighteen patients with 45,X/47,XYY have been described; prenatally diagnosed cases appeared to be normal male whereas cases diagnosed postnally presented with ambiguous genitalia and/or other anomalies. The phenotype of Y chromosome aneuploidy with 3 Y chromosomes is even more unpredictable due to the paucity of reported cases. To our knowledge this is the first patient described with this unusual karyotype, thus adding to the limited information of patients with rare mosaic Y chromosome aneuploidy.Â«Â less\n\n[XYY syndrome (diplo-Y syndrome)].\n\nPubMed\n\nBraun-Scharm, H; Schroeder-Kurth, T M\n\n1986-01-01\n\nA case is reported of a 12-year-old boy with the XYY syndrome and unusual clinical symptoms.

Approximately, 28 genes have been shown to contribute to classical phenotype of SWB with presence of dysmorphic facial features, supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS), intellectual disability, and overfriendliness. With the use of Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization and other molecular cytogenetic techniques, is possible define with more accuracy partial or atypical deletion and refine the genotype-phenotype correlation. Here, we report on a rare genomic structural rearrangement in a boy with atypical deletion in 7q11.23 and XYY syndrome with characteristic clinical signs, but not sufficient for the diagnosis of WBS. Cytogenetic analysis of G-banding showed a karyotype 47,XYY. Analysis of DNA with the technique of MLPA (Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification) using kits a combination of kits (P064, P036, P070, and P029) identified an atypical deletion on 7q11.23. In addition, high resolution SNP Oligonucleotide Microarray Analysis (SNP-array) confirmed the alterations found by MLPA and revealed others pathogenic CNVs, in the chromosomes 7 and X. The present report demonstrates an association not yet described in literature, between Williams-Beuren syndrome and 47,XYY. The identification of atypical deletion in 7q11.23 concomitant to additional pathogenic CNVs in others genomic regions allows a better comprehension of clinical consequences of atypical genomic rearrangements.

SECURITY\n\nPrader-Willi syndrome in a child with XYY.\n\nPubMed\n\nHonma, A; Ishii, R; Ito, A; Kato, M; Saitoh, S; Hayasaka, K\n\n1999-01-01\n\nWe report a 26-month-old boy with XYY syndrome, with the complication of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) due to uniparental maternal disomy of chromosome 15. To our knowledge, this is the first case of XYY syndrome and PWS. Clinical findings were fully compatible with the diagnostic criteria for PWS. Molecular analysis revealed a maternal heterodisomy of chromosome 15, indicating that non-disjunction of chromosome 15 had occurred at maternal meiosis I, and that the non-disjunction of chromosome Y and of chromosome 15 had occurred independently.\n\nFemale-to-male transsexual with 47,XXX karyotype.\n\nPubMed\n\nTuran, M T; EÅel, E; DÃ¼ndar, M; Candemir, Z; BaÅtÃ¼rk, M; SofuoÄlu, S; Ozkul, Y\n\n2000-12-01\n\nThere are few reports describing chromosomal abnormalities in transsexuals. In rare cases, transsexualism and sexual chromosomal multiplicity coexist. Six cases of male-to-female transsexuals with 47,XYY chromosomal pattern have been previously reported. We have not encountered any female transsexual cases with 47,XXX karyotype in the literature. A 21-year-old female patient came to our outpatient department with depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts. On psychiatric interview, she reported that she had feelings of discomfort with her gender identity and had desired to be male since her childhood. Then, we performed cytogenetic investigation using blood culture and G chromosome banding. Histology and DNA histograms of the patient revealed a chromosomal pattern of 47,XXX. We conclude that sexual chromosomal abnormalities in some transsexuals may cause a vulnerability to development of a gender identity disorder.\n\nFetal karyotyping for chromosome abnormalities after an unexplained elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening.\n\nPubMed\n\nFeuchtbaum, L B; Cunningham, G; Waller, D K; Lustig, L S; Tompkinson, D G; Hook, E B\n\n1995-08-01\n\nTo study the chromosome abnormality rate among women with elevated levels of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) and the types of chromosome abnormalities in this population, and to compare this rate with reports in the literature and the rate observed in the general population. We studied 8097 women who chose to undergo amniocentesis and fetal karyotyping after having an elevated MSAFP test of 2.5 multiples of the median (MOM) or higher. All abnormal karyotypes were reviewed and grouped according to whether the elevated MSAFP value could be explained by a ventral wall or neural tube defect. The overall chromosome abnormality rate was 13.83 per 1000 amniocenteses. The rate in the \"unexplained\" group was 10.92 per 1000 amniocenteses. Just over half (53%) of the abnormal karyotypes were autosomal anomalies, and 47% were sex chromosome abnormalities. The autosomal aneuploidies observed most frequently were triploidy and trisomy 13. The sex chromosome abnormalities observed most frequently were the XXY and XYY karyotypes. Women who have unexplained elevated MSAFP values of 2.5 MOM or greater have a twofold increase in the rate of chromosome abnormalities in their fetuses compared with the general population (P < or = .001). This rate is consistent with other studies that used a 2.5 MOM cutoff. Studies that used a 2.0 MOM cutoff have reported chromosome abnormality rates that do not vary from general population estimates.\n\nHeight and seriousness of crime in XYY men.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHook, E B; Healy, K M\n\n1977-01-01\n\nThe case histories of XYY males in two security settings were ranked by degree of seriousness of crime. The correlations of these scores with height were either zero (for data of Daly with the history of the propositus excluded) or positive (for data of Jacobs et al., P less than 0.05). For both studies, the results were contrary to the expectation of negative correlation which would be found if, in accord with Hunter's suggestion, authorities were biased to place XYYs in security settings because of the more threatening appearance associated with larger stature.

Crime was classified into eight types (sexual abuse, homicide, burglary, violence, traffic, drug-related, arson and 'others'). Denmark 1978-2006. All men diagnosed with KS (N=934) or 47,XYY (N=161) at risk and their age- and calendar-time-matched controls (N=88â979 and 15â356, respectively). The incidence of convictions was increased in men with KS (omitting traffic offenses) compared to controls with a HR of 1.40 (95% CI 1.23 to 1.59, p<0.001), with significant increases in sexual abuse, burglary, arson and 'others', but with a decreased risk of traffic and drug-related offenses. The incidence of convictions was significantly increased among men with 47,XYY compared to controls with a HR of 1.42 (95% CI 1.14 to 1.77, p<0.005) in all crime types, except drug-related crimes and traffic. Adjusting for socioeconomic variables (education, fatherhood, retirement and cohabitation) reduced the total HR for both KS and 47,XYY to levels similar to controls, while some specific crime types (sexual abuse, arson, etc) remained increased. The overall risk of conviction (excluding traffic offenses) was moderately increased in men with 47,XYY or KS; however, it was similar to controls when adjusting for socioeconomic parameters. Convictions for sexual abuse, burglary, arson and 'others' were significantly increased. The increased risk of convictions may be partly or fully explained by the poor socioeconomic conditions related to the chromosome aberrations.\n\nCriminality in men with Klinefelter's syndrome and XYY syndrome: a cohort study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nStochholm, Kirstine; Bojesen, Anders; Jensen, Anne SkakkebÃ¦k; Juul, Svend\n\n2012-01-01\n\nObjective To investigate the criminal pattern in men between 15 and 70â years of age diagnosed with 47,XXY (Klinefelter's syndrome (KS)) or 47,XYY compared to the general population.

Three men (1.8%) with XYY chromosome abnormality were found. This rate is much higher than that found in unselected samples of prisoners (0.7-0.9%) or in the general population (0.01%). The three men had shown prepubescent abnormalities, school problems, and had suffered from physical abuse. The chromosome analysis in all cases had been carried out in connection with the forensic psychiatric court report due to the sexual homicide. However, two men had earlier psychiatric referrals.

Past and present views on these conditions have presented contradictory statements reflecting the enthusiasm with which abnormalities have been sought and recorded in studies of newly discovered conditions - not always with due respect to the validity of the methods applied. Methodological flaws include sampling bias, generalizations unacceptably made on single cases, lack of control groups, lack of a blind evaluation procedure and finally lack of sufficient broad-spectred data. Thus an impetus to reassessment of the sex aneuploid groups presents itself. Though four hypotheses have been set forth, it has not necessarily been in search of one universally appropriate theory. In matters as complicated as these concerning interrelations of biological, psychological and social factors, it does not enhance scientific thinking to try to make straight-line cause-and-effect connections; it is important to attack the question from different perspectives, and one theory does not make another redundant. This procedure has not elicited a cacophony of ideas from so many diverse sources, that it is difficult to distinguish the nature of the issues, which are under discussion. On the contrary, in the attempt to examine the four hypotheses a picture has emerged: This does not show any inconsistencies or controversies regardless of the perspective from which it is seen - thus manifesting the force of inner coherence. The first hypothesis deals with the question whether or not distinctive XYY- and XXY-syndromes of psychological features exist. The comparisons of the total amount of data stemming from the XYY-men and the XXY-men lead to the statement, that the two groups are more alike than different. Both groups show a slight general deficit in global intelligence, but a wide spectrum of IQ scores is possible in\n\nFactors influencing parental decision making in prenatal diagnosis of sex chromosome aneuploidy.\n\nPubMed\n\nMezei, GÃ¡bor; Papp, Csaba; TÃ³th-PÃ¡l, ErnÃ¶; Beke, ArtÃºr; Papp, ZoltÃ¡n\n\n2004-07-01\n\nTo evaluate factors influencing parental decisions toward continuing or terminating a pregnancy with prenatal diagnosis of sex chromosome aneuploidy. We reviewed the records of patients with fetuses with sex chromosome aneuploidy between 1990 and 2001. A questionnaire survey of women who chose to terminate such pregnancies was designed to examine aspects of their decision-making process. Forty-nine of 89 pregnancies with sex chromosome aneuploidy were terminated (termination rate 0.55; 95% confidence interval 0.45-0.65). Pregnancies with abnormal ultrasound findings (14/16, 87%), with 45,X or 47,XXY karyotypes (26/36, 72%), and with nonmosaic karyotypes (30/48, 63%) were terminated significantly more often than pregnancies with normal ultrasound findings (35/73, 48%; P <.01), with 47,XXX or 47,XYY karyotypes (4/12, 33%; P <.05), and with mosaic karyotypes (5/25, 20%; P =.01). There was a trend (P =.136) toward a lower rate of termination from 67% to 36% across time, with a significant decrease from 67% to 7% in pregnancies with 47,XXX; 47,XYY; and mosaic karyotypes (P <.01), and no change in cases with 45,X and 47,XXY karyotypes (67% compared with 69%; P = 1.0). Abnormal sexual development and infertility were the greatest parental concerns related to termination. Fear of having a child with abnormal sexual development or infertility remains the major determinant of parental decision toward terminating pregnancy, resulting in consistently high termination rates across time in pregnancies with 45,X and 47,XXY karyotypes. In cases with 47,XXX; 47,XYY; and mosaic karyotypes, the declining termination rate across time is a consequence of recent studies reporting normal sexual development and fertility.\n\nPrenatal diagnosis of sex chromosome abnormalities: the 8-year experience of a single medical center.\n\nPubMed\n\nVaknin, Zvi; Reish, Orit; Ben-Ami, Ido; Heyman, Eli; Herman, Arie; Maymon, Ron\n\n2008-01-01\n\nTo assess the indications for prenatal karyotyping of sex chromosomal abnormalities (SCAs) during pregnancy. All singleton pregnancies interrupted in our institute because of SCAs (1998-2005) were categorized into subgroups of 45,XO (Turner syndrome), 47,XXY (Klinefelter syndrome), 47,XXX and 47,XYY. The indications for prenatal diagnostic testing were recorded. There were 67 SCAs pregnancies: 33% Turner syndrome, 28% Klinefelter syndrome, 21% 47,XXX and 18% 47,XYY. Maternal age was similar among the 4 groups (34 +/- 5, range 25-42 years). The main indications for fetal karyotyping were abnormal Down's syndrome (DS) screening or ultrasound findings, advanced maternal age (> or =35 years), and parental request. About 2/3 of the Turner and 47,XYY cases had either abnormal DS screening tests or sonographic findings, such as: increased nuchal translucency, mainly cystic hygroma and fetal hydrops. However, fetal karyotyping in more than 2/3 of the 47,XXX and 47,XXY cases was mainly performed because of advanced maternal age, and the diagnosis of fetal SCAs was coincidental (p <0.03). Our recent suggestion to expand the DS screening capacity to other chromosomal abnormalities including SCAs is further supported. Prenatal detection seems to be promising for Turner syndrome and possibly for 47,XYY syndrome, while other SCAs are less likely to be detected either by ultrasound or biochemical screening.

The patients were comparable only with respect to some somatic deviations. Age at manifestation of psychic abnormalities as well as the degree of deviation of behaviour were rather different. One patient got his psychic traumatization mainly in early childhood where as the other suffered from a more puberal conflict. Genetic disposition may be the basic cause of the psychological abnormalities. Yet, the degree of deviation seems to be influenced mainly by environmental factors.\n\nSpectral karyotyping reveals a comprehensive karyotype in an adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGuo, Bo; Zhu, Hong Li; Li, Su Xia; Lu, Xue Chun; Fan, Hui; Da, Wan Ming\n\n2012-01-01\n\nCytogenetic abnormalities are frequently detected in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

However, there is no consensus about the best method to calculate the intrachromosomal asymmetry. The present study aimed to compare different intrachromosomal asymmetry indexes in order to indicate which are more efficient for the estimation of asymmetry in different groups of orchids. Besides, we aimed to compare our results with the Orchidaceae phylogenetic proposal to test the hypothesis of Stebbins (1971). Through a literature review, karyotypes were selected and analyzed comparatively with ideal karyotypes in a cluster analysis. All karyotypes showed some level of interchromosomal asymmetry, ranging from slightly asymmetric to moderately asymmetric. The five tested intrachromosomal asymmetry indexes indicated Sarcoglottis grandiflora as the species with the most symmetrical karyotype and Christensonella pachyphylla with the most asymmetrical karyotype. In the cluster analysis, the largest number of species were grouped with the intermediary ideal karyotypes B or C. Considering our results, we recommend the combined use of at least two indexes, especially Ask% or A1 with Syi, for cytotaxonomic analysis in groups of orchids. In an evolutionary perspective, our results support Stebbins' hypothesis that asymmetric karyotypes derive from a symmetric karyotypes.\n\nA de novo 2q35-q36.1 deletion incorporating IHH in a Chinese boy (47,XYY) with syndactyly, type III Waardenburg syndrome, and congenital heart disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, D; Ren, G F; Zhang, H Z; Yi, C Y; Peng, Z J\n\n2016-12-02\n\nReports of terminal and interstitial deletions of the long arm of chromosome 2 are rare in the literature. Here, we present a case report concerning a Chinese boy with a 47,XYY karyotype and a de novo deletion comprising approximately 5 Mb between 2q35 and q36.1, along with syndactyly, type III Waardenburg syndrome, and congenital heart disease. High-resolution chromosome analysis to detect copy number variations was carried out using an Affymetrix microarray platform, and the genes affected by the patient's deletion, including IHH, were determined. However, no copy number changes were observed in his healthy parents. The present case exhibited novel syndactyly features, broadening the spectrum of clinical findings observed in individuals with 2q interstitial deletions. Our data, together with previous observations, suggest that IHH haploinsufficiency is the principal pathogenic factor in the syndactyly phenotype in this study, and that different types of variations at the IHH locus may cause divergent disease phenotypes. This is the first report of the involvement of IHH haploinsufficiency in syndactyly phenotype.\n\nIntrachromosomal karyotype asymmetry in Orchidaceae\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMedeiros-Neto, Enoque; Nollet, Felipe; Moraes, Ana Paula; Felix, Leonardo P.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAbstract The asymmetry indexes have helped cytotaxonomists to interpret and classify plant karyotypes for species delimitation efforts.

Of these, 13 (2.13%) had a 47,XYY abnormality; 5 (0.8%) were chromatin positive but two of these had cell lines that included an extra Y chromosome, one being a 48XXYY male and the other a mosaic 48,XXYY/XYY. Eight patients with autosomal abnormalities included two with Down's syndrome and a 47,XY,+21 karyotype, two with small supernumerary chromosomes, 47,XY+mar, and two with inherited balanced translocation. As in the prevalence studies of patients in these high secruity hospitals, the significant finding was the very high frequency of males with extra Y chromosomes. In this survey, it was most marked in the younger patients and particularly in those who were aged 20 years or less (approximately 6%). As a group the XYY males were therefore significantly younger than all other male admissions. As in previous surveys thay were also significantly taller and 60% were 185 cm or more in height. There were no other distinguishing physical characteristics associated with the 47,XYY karytype. In all but two patients the behaviour disturbances were attributable to psychopathic disorders and mental subnormality was diagnosed no more frequently than in the total population studied (approximately 50%).\n\n[Medicopsychosocial syndrome of polygonosomies (XXX, XXY, XYY, syndromes etc...)].\n\nPubMed\n\nBenezech, M; Bourgeois, M\n\n1976-01-01\n\nThis is an attempt to describe a common syndrom of polygonosomy. Medical, psychological and social incidences of XXX, XXY, XYY, genotypes indicate that these chromosomal aberrations share identical features: phenotypic abnormalities (high stature, dermatoglyphes abnormalities), neuropsychic troubles (neurological symptoms and mental fragility) and antisocial tendancy. One can suppose that at least some polygonosomic persons have a minimal brain dysfunction (or damage), which causes more vulnerability to environnement, deprivation and stress. Relational, educational and socio-economical factors appear now to have a marked role in the etiopathogenesis of these psychiatric troubles.

They also evaluate factors associated with ADHD symptomatology (cognitive and adaptive scores, prenatal vs postnatal ascertainment) and describe the clinical response to psychopharmacologic medications in a subset of patients treated for ADHD. Evaluation included medical and developmental history, cognitive and adaptive functioning assessment, and parent and teacher ADHD questionnaires containing DSM-IV criteria. In the total study group, 58% (96/167) met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD on parent-report questionnaires (36% in XXY, 52% in XXX, 76% in XYY, and 72% in XXYY). The Inattentive subtype was most common in XXY and XXX, whereas the XYY and XXYY groups were more likely to also have hyperactive/impulsive symptoms. There were no significant differences in Verbal, Performance, or Full Scale IQ between children with symptom scores in the ADHD range compared with those below the ADHD range. However, adaptive functioning scores were significantly lower in the group whose scores in the ADHD range were compared with those of the group who did not meet ADHD DSM-IV criteria. Those with a prenatal diagnosis of XXY were less likely to meet criteria for ADHD compared with the postnatally diagnosed group. Psychopharmacologic treatment with stimulants was effective in 78.6% (66/84). Children and adolescents with SCA are at increased risk for ADHD symptoms.

Although there is high variability, each sSCA subtype has a characteristic set of cognitive and physical phenotypes. Here, we investigated the differences in the morphometry of the human corpus callosum (CC) between sex-matched controls 46,XY (N =99), 46,XX (N =93), and six unique sSCA karyotypes: 47,XYY (N =29), 47,XXY (N =58), 48,XXYY (N =20), 47,XXX (N =30), 48,XXXY (N =5), and 49,XXXXY (N =6). Methods We investigated CC morphometry using local and global area, local curvature of the CC boundary, and between-landmark distance analysis (BLDA). We hypothesized that CC morphometry would vary differentially along a proposed spectrum of Y:X chromosome ratio with supernumerary Y karyotypes having the largest CC areas and supernumerary X karyotypes having significantly smaller CC areas. To investigate this, we defined an sSCA spectrum based on a descending Y:X karyotype ratio: 47,XYY, 46,XY, 48,XXYY, 47,XXY, 48,XXXY, 49,XXXXY, 46,XX, 47,XXX. We similarly explored the effects of both X and Y chromosome numbers within sex. Results of shape-based metrics were analyzed using permutation tests consisting of 5,000 iterations. Results Several subregional areas, local curvature, and BLDs differed between groups. Moderate associations were found between area and curvature in relation to the spectrum and X and Y chromosome counts. BLD was strongly associated with X chromosome count in both male and female groups. Conclusions Our results suggest that X- and Y-linked genes have differential effects on CC morphometry. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare CC morphometry across these extremely rare groups.

By SKY we were able to detect the abnormal clones in all cases but 9. In the G-band preparations these cases showed very few abnormal mitoses. The SKY either extended or confirmed the G-band findings in 94% of those with an abnormal karyotype. Cryptic translocations (translocations not suspected from the G-band karyotype) were found in 71 cases (26 AML, 9 ALL, 5 MDS, 2 CLL and 29 NHL). We find SKY a powerful adjuvant diagnostic tool that does not compromise one of the advantages of karyotyping techniques, the analysis of the entire genome which, in contrast to molecular biological techniques, still leave the possibility to get mroe answers than questions posed.\n\nEvolution of Karyotypes in Chameleons\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRovatsos, Michail; AltmanovÃ¡, Marie; Johnson PokornÃ¡, Martina; VelenskÃ½, Petr; KratochvÃ­l, LukÃ¡Å¡\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe reconstruction of the evolutionary dynamics of karyotypes and sex determining systems in squamate reptiles is precluded by the lack of data in many groups including most chameleons (Squamata: Acrodonta: Chamaeleonidae). We performed cytogenetic analysis in 16 species of chameleons from 8 genera covering the phylogenetic diversity of the family and also phylogenetic reconstruction of karyotype evolution in this group. In comparison to other squamates, chameleons demonstrate rather variable karyotypes, differing in chromosome number, morphology and presence of interstitial telomeric signal (ITS). On the other hand, the location of rDNA is quite conserved among chameleon species. Phylogenetic analysis combining our new results and previously published data tentatively suggests that the ancestral chromosome number for chameleons is 2n = 36, which is the same as assumed for other lineages of the clade Iguania, i.e., agamids and iguanas. In general, we observed a tendency for the reduction of chromosome number during the evolution of chameleons, however, in Rieppeleon brevicaudatus, we uncovered a chromosome number of 2n = 62, very unusual among squamates, originating from a number of chromosome splits. Despite the presence of the highly differentiated ZZ/ZW sex chromosomes in the genus Furcifer, we did not detect any unequivocal sexual differences in the karyotypes of any other studied species of chameleons tested using differential staining and comparative genomic hybridization, suggesting that sex chromosomes in most chameleons are only poorly differentiated.

DATA SOURCES: Scientific articles were searched in MEDLINE database, using the descriptors \"karyotype\" OR \"chromosomal\" OR \"chromosome\" AND \"heart defects, congenital\". The research was limited to articles published in English from 1980 on. DATA SYNTHESIS: Congenital heart disease is characterized by an etiologically heterogeneous and not well understood group of lesions. Several researchers have evaluated the presence of chromosomal abnormalities detected by the karyotype in patients with congenital heart disease. However, most of the articles were retrospective studies developed in Europe and only some of the studied patients had a karyotype exam. In this review, only one study was conducted in Latin America, in Brazil. It is known that chromosomal abnormalities are frequent, being present in about one in every ten patients with congenital heart disease. Among the karyotype alterations in these patients, the most important is the trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). These patients often have associated extra-cardiac malformations, with a higher risk of morbidity and mortality, which makes heart surgery even more risky. CONCLUSIONS: Despite all the progress made in recent decades in the field of cytogenetic, the karyotype remains an essential tool in order to evaluate patients with congenital heart disease. The detailed dysmorphological physical examination is of great importance to indicate the need of a karyotype.

We aimed to evaluate the accuracy, efficacy, and incremental yield of chromosomal microarray analysis as compared with karyotyping for routine prenatal diagnosis. Methods Samples from women undergoing prenatal diagnosis at 29 centers were sent to a central karyotyping laboratory. Each sample was split in two; standard karyotyping was performed on one portion and the other was sent to one of four laboratories for chromosomal microarray. Results We enrolled a total of 4406 women. Indications for prenatal diagnosis were advanced maternal age (46.6%), abnormal result on Downâs syndrome screening (18.8%), structural anomalies on ultrasonography (25.2%), and other indications (9.4%). In 4340 (98.8%) of the fetal samples, microarray analysis was successful; 87.9% of samples could be used without tissue culture. Microarray analysis of the 4282 nonmosaic samples identified all the aneuploidies and unbalanced rearrangements identified on karyotyping but did not identify balanced translocations and fetal triploidy. In samples with a normal karyotype, microarray analysis revealed clinically relevant deletions or duplications in 6.0% with a structural anomaly and in 1.7% of those whose indications were advanced maternal age or positive screening results. Conclusions In the context of prenatal diagnostic testing, chromosomal microarray analysis identified additional, clinically significant cytogenetic information as compared with karyotyping and was equally efficacious in identifying aneuploidies and unbalanced rearrangements but did not identify balanced translocations and triploidies.

The cell line NALM-1 was originally established by Minowada and coworkers from the peripheral blood of a patient in CML blastic crisis. A karyotype analysis of the NALM-1 cell line was performed in the 1970s. To the best of our knowledge, this karyotype was not re-analyzed by molecular cytogenetic techniques, although this cell line is the source of many molecular investigations including expression studies. To establish this cell line as a CML control in our own laboratory, NALM-1 was analyzed by GTG banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and spectral karyotyping. Our results differ from the original publication of Sonta and coworkers. We describe for the first time the karyotype of the NALM-1 cell line: 44,X,-X,der(7)t(7;9;15)(q10;?;q15),der(9)t(9;9)(p24;q33 approximately q34)t(9;22)(q34;q11),der(15)t(7;9;15) (?;?;q15),der(22)t(9;22)(q34;q11).\n\nUpdating the maize karyotype by chromosome DNA sizing.\n\nPubMed\n\nSilva, JÃ©ssica Coutinho; Carvalho, Carlos Roberto; Clarindo, Wellington Ronildo\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe karyotype is a basic concept regarding the genome, fundamentally described by the number and morphological features of all chromosomes. Chromosome class, centromeric index, intra- and interchromosomal asymmetry index, and constriction localization are important in clinical, systematic and evolutionary approaches. In spite of the advances in karyotype characterization made over the last years, new data about the chromosomes can be generated from quantitative methods, such as image cytometry. Therefore, using Zea mays L., this study aimed to update the species' karyotype by supplementing information on chromosome DNA sizing. After adjustment of the procedures, chromosome morphometry and class as well as knob localization enabled describing the Z. mays karyotype. In addition, applying image cytometry, DNA sizing was unprecedentedly measured for the arms and satellite of all chromosomes. This way, unambiguous identification of the chromosome pairs, and hence the assembly of 51 karyograms, were only possible after the DNA sizing of each chromosome, their arms and satellite portions. These accurate, quantitative and reproducible data also enabled determining the distribution and variation of DNA content in each chromosome. From this, a correlation between DNA amount and total chromosome length evidenced that the mean DNA content of chromosome 9 was higher than that of chromosome 8. The chromosomal DNA sizing updated the Z. mays karyotype, providing insights into its dynamic genome with regards to the organization of the ten chromosomes and their respective portions. Considering the results and the relevance of cytogenetics in the current scenario of comparative sequencing and genomics, chromosomal DNA sizing should be incorporated as an additional parameter for karyotype definition. Based on this study, it can be affirmed that cytogenetic approaches go beyond the simple morphological description of chromosomes.\n\nKaryotype and identification of sex in two endangered crane species\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nGoodpasture, C.; Seluja, G.; Gee, G.; Wood, Don A.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nA laboratory procedure for sex identification of monomorphic birds was developed using modern cytological methods of detecting chromosome abnormalities in human amniotic fluid samples. A pin feather is taken from a pre-fledging bird for tissue culture and karyotype analysis. Through this method, the sex was identified and the karyotype described of the whooping crane (Grus americana) and the Mississippi sandhill crane (G. canadensis pulla). Giemsa-stained karyotypes of these species showed an identical chromosome constitution with 2n = 78 + 2. However, differences in the amount of centromeric heterochromatin were observed in the Mississippi sandhill crane when compared to the whooping crane C-banded karyotype.\n\nKaryotype versus microarray testing for genetic abnormalities after stillbirth.\n\nPubMed\n\nReddy, Uma M; Page, Grier P; Saade, George R; Silver, Robert M; Thorsten, Vanessa R; Parker, Corette B; Pinar, Halit; Willinger, Marian; Stoll, Barbara J; Heim-Hall, Josefine; Varner, Michael W; Goldenberg, Robert L; Bukowski, Radek; Wapner, Ronald J; Drews-Botsch, Carolyn D; O'Brien, Barbara M; Dudley, Donald J; Levy, Brynn\n\n2012-12-06\n\nGenetic abnormalities have been associated with 6 to 13% of stillbirths, but the true prevalence may be higher. Unlike karyotype analysis, microarray analysis does not require live cells, and it detects small deletions and duplications called copy-number variants. The Stillbirth Collaborative Research Network conducted a population-based study of stillbirth in five geographic catchment areas. Standardized postmortem examinations and karyotype analyses were performed. A single-nucleotide polymorphism array was used to detect copy-number variants of at least 500 kb in placental or fetal tissue. Variants that were not identified in any of three databases of apparently unaffected persons were then classified into three groups: probably benign, clinical significance unknown, or pathogenic. We compared the results of karyotype and microarray analyses of samples obtained after delivery. In our analysis of samples from 532 stillbirths, microarray analysis yielded results more often than did karyotype analysis (87.4% vs. 70.5%, P<0.001) and provided better detection of genetic abnormalities (aneuploidy or pathogenic copy-number variants, 8.3% vs. 5.8%; P=0.007). Microarray analysis also identified more genetic abnormalities among 443 antepartum stillbirths (8.8% vs. 6.5%, P=0.02) and 67 stillbirths with congenital anomalies (29.9% vs. 19.4%, P=0.008). As compared with karyotype analysis, microarray analysis provided a relative increase in the diagnosis of genetic abnormalities of 41.9% in all stillbirths, 34.5% in antepartum stillbirths, and 53.8% in stillbirths with anomalies. Microarray analysis is more likely than karyotype analysis to provide a genetic diagnosis, primarily because of its success with nonviable tissue, and is especially valuable in analyses of stillbirths with congenital anomalies or in cases in which karyotype results cannot be obtained.

We demonstrate here the magnitude of DNA content differences among normal chromosomes of the same type. Significant peak-position differences between homologues were observed for an average of four chromosome types in each of the karyotypes of 98 different individuals. The frequency of individuals with differences in homologue peak positions varied among chromosome types: e.g., chromosome 15, 61%; chromosome 3, 4%. Flow karyotypes of 33 unrelated individuals were compared to determine the range of peak position among normal chromosomes. Chromosomes Y, 21, 22, 15, 16, 13, 14, and 19 were most heteromorphic, and chromosomes 2-8 and X were least heteromorphic. The largest chromosome 21 was 45% larger than the smallest 21 chromosome observed. The base composition of the variable regions differed among chromosome types. DNA contents of chromosome variants determined from flow karyotypes were closely correlated to measurements of DNA content made of gallocyanin chrome alum-stained metaphase chromosomes on slides. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with chromosome-specific repetitive sequences indicated that variability in their copy number is partly responsible for peak-position variability in some chromosomes. Heteromorphic chromosomes are identified for which parental flow karyotype information will be essential if de novo rearrangements resulting in small DNA content changes are to be detected with flow karyotyping.

Males with sex chromosomal aneuploidies are known to have variability in their developmental profile with the majority presenting with expressive language deficits. As a consequence of language delays, they have an increased likelihood of language-based learning disabilities and social-emotional problems that may persist through adulthood. Studies on males with 47,XXY have revealed unique behavioral and social profiles with possible vulnerability to autistic traits. The prevalence of males with more than one extra sex chromosome (e.g., 48,XXYY and 48,XXXY) and an additional Y (e.g., 47,XYY) is less common, but it is important to understand their social functioning as it provides insight into treatment implications.

However, determining which rearrangements are responsible for karyotype changes is a challenging task and the combination of a robust phylogeny with refined karyotype characterization, GS measurements and bioinformatic modelling is necessary. Here, this approach was applied in Heterotaxis to determine what chromosome rearrangements were responsible for the dysploidy variation. We used two datasets (nrDNA and cpDNA, both under MP and BI) to infer the phylogenetic relationships among Heterotaxis species and the closely related genera Nitidobulbon and Ornithidium. Such phylogenies were used as framework to infer how karyotype evolution occurred using statistical methods. The nrDNA recovered Ornithidium, Nitidobulbon and Heterotaxis as monophyletic under both MP and BI; while cpDNA could not completely separate the three genera under both methods. Based on the GS, we recovered two groups within Heterotaxis: (1) \"small GS\", corresponding to the Sessilis grade, composed of plants with smaller genomes and smaller morphological structure, and (2) \"large GS\", corresponding to the Discolor clade, composed of plants with large genomes and robust morphological structures. The robust karyotype modeling, using both nrDNA phylogenies, allowed us to infer that the ancestral Heterotaxis karyotype presented 2n = 40, probably with a proximal 45S rDNA on a metacentric chromosome pair. The chromosome number variation was caused by ascending dysploidy (chromosome fission involving the proximal 45S rDNA site resulting in two acrocentric chromosome pairs holding a terminal 45S rDNA), with subsequent descending dysploidy (fusion) in two species, H. maleolens and H. sessilis. However, besides dysploidy, our analysis detected another important chromosome rearrangement in the Orchidaceae: chromosome inversion, that promoted 5S rDNA site duplication and relocation.

However, since only a low proportion of Orchidaceae has been analysed for chromosome data, greater diversity may await to be unveiled. Here we analyse both genome size (GS) and karyotype in two subtribes recently included in the broadened Maxillariinea to detect how much chromosome and GS variation there is in these groups and to evaluate which genome rearrangements are involved in the species evolution. To do so, the GS (14 species), the karyotype - based on chromosome number, heterochromatic banding and 5S and 45S rDNA localisation (18 species) - was characterised and analysed along with published data using phylogenetic approaches. The GS presented a high phylogenetic correlation and it was related to morphological groups in Bifrenaria (larger plants - higher GS). The two largest GS found among genera were caused by different mechanisms: polyploidy in Bifrenaria tyrianthina and accumulation of repetitive DNA in Scuticaria hadwenii. The chromosome number variability was caused mainly through descending dysploidy, and x=20 was estimated as the base chromosome number. Combining GS and karyotype data with molecular phylogeny, our data provide a more complete scenario of the karyotype evolution in Maxillariinae orchids, allowing us to suggest, besides dysploidy, that inversions and transposable elements as two mechanisms involved in the karyotype evolution. Such karyotype modifications could be associated with niche changes that occurred during species evolution.

Many of these species are both morphologically and biogeographically divergent, and the relationship among some species remains uncertain even with evolutionary and phylogenetic studies being proposed for the group. For a better understanding of the evolutionary relationship between these snakes, we cytogenetically analysed 7 species and 3 subspecies of Neotropical snakes from the Boidae family using different chromosomal markers. The karyotypes of Boa constrictor occidentalis, Corallus hortulanus, Eunectes notaeus, Epicrates cenchria and Epicrates assisi are presented here for the first time with the redescriptions of the karyotypes of Boa constrictor constrictor, B. c. amarali, Eunectes murinus and Epicrates crassus.

In contrast, C. hortulanus presented a totally different karyotype composition for the Boidae family, showing 2n = 40 chromosomes with a greater number of macrochromosomes. Furthermore, chromosomal mapping of telomeric sequences revealed the presence of interstitial telomeric sites (ITSs) on many chromosomes in addition to the terminal markings on all chromosomes of all taxa analysed, with the exception of E. notaeus.

To investigate the interspecific relationships among Paratelmatobius and Scythrophrys species, we analyzed a mitochondrial region (approximately 2.4 kb) that included the ribosomal genes 12S and 16S and the tRNAval in representatives of all known localities of these genera and in 54 other species. Maximum parsimony inferences were done using PAUP* and support for the clades was evaluated by bootstrapping. A cytogenetic analysis using Giemsa staining, C-banding and silver staining was also done for those populations of Paratelmatobius not included in previous cytogenetic studies of this genus in order to assess their karyotype differentiation. Our results suggested Paratelmatobius and Scythrophrys formed a clade strongly supported by bootstrapping, which corroborated their very close phylogenetic relationship. Among the Paratelmatobius species, two clades were identified and corroborated the groups P. mantiqueira and P. cardosoi previously proposed based on morphological characters. The karyotypes of Paratelmatobius sp. 2 and Paratelmatobius sp. 3 described here had diploid chromosome number 2n = 24 and showed many similarities with karyotypes of other Paratelmatobius representatives. The cytogenetic data and the phylogenetic analysis allowed the proposal/corroboration of several hypotheses for the karyotype differentiation within Paratelmatobius and Scythrophrys. Namely the telocentric pair No. 4 represented a synapomorphy of P. cardosoi and Paratelmatobius sp. 2, while chromosome pair No. 5 with interstitial C-bands could be interpreted as a synapomorphy of the P. cardosoi group. The NOR-bearing chromosome No. 10 in the karyotype of P. poecilogaster was considered homeologous to chromosome No. 10 in the karyotype of Scythrophrys sp\n\nA new karyotype for Rhipidomys (Rodentia, Cricetidae) from Southeastern Brazil\n\nPubMed Central\n\nde Carvalho, Ana Heloisa; Lopes, Maria OlÃ­mpia Garcia; Svartman, Marta\n\n2012-01-01\n\nAbstract In this work we present a new karyotype for Rhipidomys Tschudi, 1845 (Cricetidae, Rodentia) from Brazil. Our chromosome analyses included GTG- and CBG-banding patterns, the localization of the nucleolus organizer regions after silver staining (Ag-NORs) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a telomere probe. The new karyotype is composed of 44 chromosomes and has a fundamental number (number of autosomal arms) of 48. Most Rhipidomys species already karyotyped presented similar complements with 2n=44, but their fundamental numbers varied from FN=46 to 80, a variation that has been mainly attributed to pericentric inversions. The comparison of this new karyotype to those of other Rhipidomys already reported allowed us to conclude that it is a distinctive chromosome complement, which can be of great use as a tool for the very complicated taxonomic identification in this genus.

Clinically, Burkitt lymphoma has a favourable prognosis with very few relapses. However, the few patients experiencing disease progression and/or relapse have a dismal outcome. Here we report cytogenetic findings of seven cases of Burkitt lymphoma in which sequential karyotyping was performed at time of diagnosis and/or disease progression/relapse(s). After case selection, karyotype re-review and additional molecular analyses were performed in six paediatric cases, treated in Berlin-Frankfurt-MÃ¼nster-Non-Hodgkin lymphoma study group trials, and one additional adult patient. Moreover, we analysed 18 cases of Burkitt lymphoma from the Mitelman database in which sequential karyotyping was performed. Our findings show secondary karyotypes to have a significant increase in load of cytogenetic aberrations with a mean number of 2, 5 and 8 aberrations for primary, secondary and third investigations. Importantly, this increase in karyotype complexity seemed to result from recurrent secondary chromosomal changes involving mainly trisomy 21, gains of 1q and 7q, losses of 6q, 11q, 13q, and 17p. In addition, our findings indicate a linear clonal evolution to be the predominant manner of cytogenetic evolution. Our data may provide a biological framework for the dismal outcome of progressive and relapsing Burkitt lymphoma.

Dermatoglyphics is in use as a supportive diagnostic tool in genetic or chromosomal disorders as well as in clinical conditions with genetic etiologies. Primary amenorrhoea and Dermatoglyphics, both have the suspected multifactorial (genetic and environmental) aetiologies. Objective: In the present study the finger dermatoglyphic patterns were studied in primary amenorrhoea cases and age matched fertile control females and also attention was given to find out whether a specific dermatoglyphic trait exists in primary amenorrhoea cases and whether it was statistically significant. Materials and Methods: To study the role of dermatoglyphics in primary amenorrhoea, a study was conducted on 30 subjects with primary amenorrhoea (as cases) and compared it with equal number of age matched fertile females (as controls). We studied fingertip patterns in all the subjects enrolled. Simultaneously we have assessed the Karyotype of primary amenorrhoea cases. Result and Conclusion: Two subjects in experimental group have shown abnormal Karyotypes. The most significant finding in present study was increased total finger ridge count (TFRC) in primary amenorrhoea cases which was statistically significant. We also found higher frequency of loops and arches in primary amenorrhoea with abnormal karyotypes. This type of study may be quite useful as a supportive investigation, in stating the predisposition of an individual to primary amenorrhoea and referral of an individual for karyotyping.

These species have high morphological variability in a large number of varieties and cytotypes, hampering identification. This study aimed to determine the karyotype asymmetry index among accessions of Cynodon to discriminate between them. Karyotype symmetry was based on three estimates, which were compared. The basic number for the genus is x = 9. The results of the chromosome count and DNA quantification, respectively, were as follows: two diploid accessions (2n = 2x = 18 and 1.08 Â± 0.094 to 1.17 Â± 0.036 pg DNA and Â± standard deviation), one triploid accession (2n = 3x = 27 and 1.63 Â± 0.017 pg DNA), four tetraploid accessions (2n = 4x = 36 and 1.88 Â± 0.069 to 2.10 Â± 0.07 pg DNA), and one pentaploid accession (2n = 5x = 45 and 2.55 Â± 0.098 pg DNA). C. incompletus var. hirsutus had the longest total length of the haploid lot (29.05 Âµm), with chromosomes that ranged from 1.7 to 6.2 Âµm in length. On the basis of the karyotype asymmetry indices, the accessions were divided into two groups: 1) C. dactylon var. dactylon, C. transvaalensis, C. dactylon var. polevansii, three accessions of Cynodon sp, and C. nlemfuensis; and 2) C. incompletus var. hirsutus. This is the first description of tetraploidy in C. transvaalensis. The karyotypic data facilitated a determination of the degree of proximity between the accessions.\n\nExploring Contemporary Issues in Genetics & Society: Karyotyping, Biological Sex, & Gender\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBrown, Julie C.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIn this two-part activity, high school biology students examine human karyotyping, sex-chromosome-linked disorders, and the relationship between biological sex and gender.

This was a retrospective study in a large patient cohort of 5950 singleton pregnancies which underwent MPS-based testing as a prenatal screening test for trisomies 21, 18 and 13, with X and Y chromosomes as secondary findings, in Southwest Hospital in China. MPS-based SCA-positive women were offered the choice of knowing whether their SCA results were positive and those who did commenced a two-stage post-test clinical counseling protocol. In Stage 1, general information about SCA was given, and women were given the option of invasive testing for confirmation of findings; in Stage 2, those who had chosen to undergo invasive testing were informed about the specific SCA affecting their fetus and their management options. Thirty-three cases were classified as SCA-positive by MPS-based testing. After Stage 1 of the two-stage post-test clinical counseling session, 33 (100%) of these pregnant women chose to know the screening test results, and 25 (75.76%) underwent an invasive diagnostic procedure and karyotype analysis, in one of whom karyotyping failed. In thirteen cases, karyotyping confirmed the MPS-based test results (two X0 cases, seven XXX cases, three XXY cases and one XYY case), giving a positive predictive value of 54.17% (13/24 cases confirmed by karyotyping). After post-test clinical counseling session Stage 2, seven women chose to terminate the pregnancy: one X0 case, two XXX cases, the three XXY cases and the single XYY case. Six women decided to continue with pregnancy: one X0 case and five XXX cases. Our study showed the feasibility of clinical application of the MPS-based test in the non-invasive detection of fetal SCA. Together with a two-stage post-test clinical counseling protocol, it leads to a well-informed decision-making procedure\n\nKaryotypes of some medium-sized Dytiscidae (Agabinae and Colymbetinae) (Coleoptera)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAngus, Robert B.; Clery, Molly J.; Carter, Jodie C.; Wenczek, Daniel E.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAbstract An account is given of the karyotypes of 29 species of medium sized Dytiscidae (Coleoptera). Of the 20 species of Agabus Leach, 1817, 18 have karyotypes comprising 21 pairs of autosomes and sex chromosomes which are either X0(â) or XX (â). These species are Agabus serricornis (Paykull, 1799), Agabus labiatus (Brahm, 1791), Agabus congener (Thunberg, 1794), Agabus lapponicus (Thomson, 1867), Agabus thomsoni (J. Sahlberg, 1871), Agabus confinis (Gyllenhal, 1808), Agabus sturmii (Gyllenhal, 1808), Agabus bipustulatus (Linnaeus, 1767), Agabus nevadensis HÃ¥kan Lindberg, 1939, Agabus wollastoni Sharp, 1882, Agabus melanarius AubÃ©, 1837, Agabus biguttatus (Olivier, 1795), Agabus binotatus AubÃ©, 1837, Agabus affinis (Paykull, 1798), Agabus unguicularis (Thomson, 1867), Agabus ramblae Millan & Ribera, 2001, Agabus conspersus (Marsham, 1802) and Agabus nebulosus (Forster, 1771). However two species, Agabus infuscatus AubÃ©, 1838 and Agabus adpressus AubÃ©, 1837, have developed a neo-XY system, with karyotypes comprising 21 pairs of autosomes and XY sex chromosomes (â). No chromosomal differences have been detected between typical Agabus bipustulatus and Agabus bipustulatus var. solieri AubÃ©, 1837, nor have any been found between the three species of the Agabus bipustulatus complex (Agabus bipustulatus, Agabus nevadensis and Agabus wollastoni). The four species of Colymbetes Clairville, 1806, Colymbetes fuscus (Linnaeus, 1758), Colymbetes paykulli Erichson, 1837, Colymbetes piceus Klug, 1834 and Colymbetes striatus (Linnaeus, 1758) have karyotypes comprising 20 pairs of autosomes and sex chromosomes which are X0 (â), XX (â). Two of the species of Rhantus Dejean, 1833, Rhantus exsoletus (Forster, 1771) and Rhantus suturellus (Harris, 1828) have karyotypes comprising 20 pairs of autosomes and X0/XX sex chromosomes, but the other three species, Rhantus grapii (Gyllenhal, 1808), Rhantus frontalis (Marsham, 1802) and Rhantus suturalis (Macleay, 1825) have 22\n\nKaryomorphology and karyotype asymmetry in the South American Caesalpinia species (Leguminosae and Caesalpinioideae).\n\nPubMed\n\nRodrigues, P S; Souza, M M; CorrÃªa, R X\n\n2014-10-20\n\nWith the purpose of addressing the pattern of karyotype evolution in Caesalpinia species, chromosome morphology was characterized in five species from Brazil, and karyotypic asymmetry was analyzed in 14 species from South America. All accessions had the chromosome number 2n = 24, which was first described here for Caesalpinia laxiflora Tul. and Cenostigma macrophyllum Tul. The karyotype formula of C. laxiflora, Caesalpinia pyramidalis Tul., and C. macrophyllum was 12 m. The formula varies amongst the populations of Caesalpinia bracteosa Tul. (11 m + 1 sm) and Caesalpinia echinata Lam. (10 m + 2 sm and 9 m + 3 sm). The intra- and interspecific variations in chromosome length were significant (analysis of variance, P < 0.05). Analyzing the asymmetry index (AI), revealed that Caesalpinia calycina Benth. had the most asymmetrical karyotype (AI = 10.52), whereas Caesalpinia paraguarienses (D. Parodi) Burkat. and Caesalpinia gi"
