        "meta_description": "Abstract The Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) in sea surface temperature (SST) has been shown to influence the climate of the surrounding continents. However, it is unclear to what extent the observed impact of the AMO is related to the thermodynamical influence of the SST variability or the changes in large-scale atmospheric circulation. Here, an analog method is used to decompose the observed impact of the AMO into dynamical and residual components of surface air temperature (SAT) and precipitation over the adjacent continents. Over Europe the influence of the AMO is clearest during the summer, when the warm SAT anomalies are interpreted to be primarily thermodynamically driven by warm upstream SST anomalies but also amplified by the anomalous atmospheric circulation. The overall precipitation response to the AMO in summer is generally less significant than the SAT but is mostly dynamically driven. The decomposition is also applied to the North American summer and the Sahel rainy season. Both dynamical and residual influences on the anomalous precipitation over the Sahel are substantial, with the former dominating over the western Sahel region and the latter being largest over the eastern Sahel region. The results have potential implications for understanding the spread in AMO variability in coupled climate models and decadal prediction systems.",

        "text": "b. Constructed circulation analogs\n\nTo estimate the components of precipitation and SAT that are solely due to atmospheric circulation anomalies, we compute empirical circulation analogs, applying the constructed circulation analog method of Deser et al. (2016). Analog techniques have previously been used for statistical weather forecasting (Lorenz 1969; Van den Dool 1994; Van den Dool et al. 2003) and, more recently, to assess the role of global warming on cold European winters (Cattiaux et al. 2010). The constructed analog method used here aims to calculate the SAT (or precipitation) anomalies that are associated with the large-scale circulation anomalies and is similar to the gridpoint partial least squares method employed by Smoliak et al. (2010), Wallace et al. (2012), and Smoliak et al. (2015). The Deser et al. (2016) method is preferred here because the calculation that produces the circulation analogs can be simply extended to other fields, to construct the anomaly associated with a particular circulation pattern. Deser et al. (2016) demonstrated (in Fig. S1 of their paper) that the constructed approach yields similar estimates as the pointwise partial least squares method of Smoliak et al. (2015) for the dynamical contribution to observed wintertime SAT trends over North America.\n\nWe use monthly SLP anomalies to characterize the dynamical circulation anomalies. For each month, the Euclidean distance is calculated between the (area weighted) SLP anomaly of the target month and all other SLP anomalies corresponding to the same calendar month (i.e., each January is compared with all other Januaries). The Euclidean distance is calculated on the target region: for example, the European region is defined as 30°–90°N, 60°W–60°E. The 80 months that are closest to the target month are then selected, excluding those that occur within 5 years of the target month to avoid sampling the neighboring years. A subsample of 50 months is then randomly selected from the set of the 80 closest months. We then calculate the optimal linear fit (in a least squares sense) of the 50-month subsample to the target SLP field, using multiple linear regression. Fitting this subsample of 50 months to the target month yields a regression coefficient for each of the 50 months, which can be used to construct the analog SLP anomaly. The random subsampling and fitting to the target SLP field is repeated 100 times, and the resulting 100 constructed SLP fields are then averaged to obtain an analog SLP field. The repeated subsampling ensures that the analog SLP field closely represents the target SLP field but is not overly determined by any particular month in the dataset. We found the results are insensitive to the exact number of “closest” months, number of subsampled months, or the number of repeated subsamples performed [see also the appendix of Deser et al. (2016)].\n\nThe dynamical SAT and precipitation analog fields, associated with the circulation anomaly, are calculated during the procedure that calculates the analog SLP field. When calculating the optimal linear fit to the target SLP field, the regression coefficients yielded are multiplied by the SAT/precipitation anomaly for the respective month. The subsampling results in 100 estimates for the dynamical SAT/precipitation anomaly, which are averaged to obtain a “best” estimate of the dynamical SAT/precipitation anomaly. This process is repeated for every month in the SAT and precipitation datasets. The monthly full and dynamical anomalies for each field are averaged over 3-month periods to produce seasonal anomalies; the residual anomaly is then calculated by subtracting the dynamical anomaly from the full anomaly. In section 3a, we estimate the uncertainty in this by using the 100 random subsamples used to produce the constructed analogs for each month. One of the subsamples for each month in a season is randomly selected, and these are combined to produce one seasonal analog. This process is then repeated 1000 times, and the uncertainty is measured from the resulting distribution.\n\nTo estimate the uncertainty in the dynamical decomposition, the 100 random subsamples used to produce the constructed analogs for each month were randomly combined 1000 times, producing 1000 random seasonal analogs (the shading in Fig. 7, described in greater detail below, indicates the 5%–95% range of this distribution for each year).\n\nAn example of the dynamical circulation analog over Europe for the summer season [defined as the June–August mean (JJA)] is shown in Fig. 1 for the year 1990. The full SLP anomaly for the season is clearly well captured throughout the European sector by the dynamical SLP anomaly field (cf. Fig. 1a with Fig. 1b), which was constructed using the analog technique. The residual SLP anomaly is small everywhere within the European target region, which gives confidence that the analog method is able to effectively reconstruct the seasonal circulation anomalies. The year 1990 is selected at random, but the scales of the seasonal SLP anomalies over the European sector are not particularly unusual, and the residual is similarly small for all seasons and years. To test how well the constructed analog SLP anomalies are able to capture the full anomaly fields for each season, we calculated the fraction of the explained variance (i.e., the squared correlation coefficient r2) for each season, and almost 100% of the variance of the full SLP anomaly fields is captured by the constructed analogs in all seasons (see Fig. S1 for an example for the European winter analogs).\n\nThe decomposition of SAT and precipitation anomalies for summer 1990 are shown in Fig. 2. For this particular season, the dynamical circulation analogs suggest that the cold anomaly over eastern Europe (Fig. 2a) is primarily dynamically induced by northerly winds associated with the western edge of the cyclonic circulation anomaly. Over Scandinavia the temperature anomalies are weak, given what would be estimated using this method from the anomalous circulation alone [i.e., the dynamical SAT anomaly (Fig. 2c)], which would typically be associated with warm anomalies as a result of anomalous southerly flow. The residual SAT anomaly is therefore cold over Scandinavia. The largest residual SAT anomaly is found over northern Russia, on the eastern edge of the analysis region. While this may be related to SLP anomalies from outside the region of interest, maps of the fraction of explained variance (shown later in Fig. 3) do not show an abrupt drop close to the edge of the analysis region; for example, the explained variance fraction drops to 0.5 about 10° outside the target region (i.e., Fig. S1). The decomposition of precipitation is less clear, largely because of the smaller scale of the precipitation anomalies themselves. The dry anomaly over central and western Europe occurs under a region of anomalous high pressure, whereas the positive precipitation anomaly over Russia occurs under a region of anomalous low pressure. This dynamical precipitation anomaly broadly corresponds to the full precipitation anomaly (i.e., Fig. 2b), but there is still a sizeable residual precipitation anomaly (i.e., Fig. 2f), particularly around the Black Sea, where the dry anomalies are not captured by the dynamical precipitation.\n\nFrom the dynamical anomaly fields calculated for each year and each season, we can analyze how much of the total interannual variability for each field can be explained by the dynamically induced anomalies. The fraction of variance explained (i.e., r2) by the dynamical anomaly fields over Europe for each season is shown in Fig. 3. In terms of SAT variability, the dynamical anomalies explain the majority of the variability over the entire continent during winter [December–February (DJF)], whereas, in the other seasons, the dynamical component accounts for around 50% of the variance over most of the continent. The fraction of total interannual precipitation variability that is explained by the dynamical anomalies is much noisier than the equivalent SAT fields, which is likely because of the shorter length scale of precipitation anomalies compared to SAT anomalies. During all seasons, the highest fraction of variance explained by the dynamical component occurs over northwestern Europe and is particularly striking in winter (i.e., Fig. 3b). Farther downstream, over eastern Europe and Russia, there is more spread between the different seasons.\n\nThe residual anomaly in each dataset will include any influences from thermodynamic processes: for example, the advection by the climatological flow of the anomalous air temperature and humidity over the ocean, local radiative forcing from clouds, and soil moisture anomalies, which are not directly linked to circulation anomalies. Of course, the residual anomalies are also likely to include a reasonable amount of “noise” that is not clearly related to thermodynamics but results from the empirical nature of the decomposition. However, we anticipate that much of this noise will be filtered out when calculating composite differences of the anomaly fields between the warm and cold phases of the AMO (section 2c), which is the main focus of this paper. It should be noted that, since we use monthly anomaly data, the impact of smaller-scale dynamical features that occur on time scales less than a month will only be represented if it has a signature in the monthly SLP anomalies. This means that the impact of individual extratropical storms are to some extent expected to be accounted for where the seasonal SLP anomalies are closely related to seasonal storm-track anomalies, which is the case, for example, over Europe during the summer season (Dong et al. 2013). Whereas, smaller mesoscale and convective systems are likely to be represented to some extent in the residual.\n\na. Summer\n\nThe warm phase of the AMO in summer (i.e., JJA) generates a cyclonic anomaly over western Europe (Fig. 5a), which is similar to the southern lobe of the negative summer North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) pattern, as highlighted in previous studies (Ghosh et al. 2016; Sutton and Hodson 2005; Ting et al. 2014). A similar cyclonic anomaly is also found in the 20CR and HadSLP2 datasets (Figs. S2, S3), albeit slightly weaker in the latter. As a result, the composite difference maps of the decomposed anomalies are very similar in all datasets. The difference of the full and decomposed SAT and precipitation anomalies between the warm and cold phases of the AMO for the European summer are shown in Fig. 6. The full SAT anomaly linked to the warm phase of the AMO is similar to that found in previous studies (Knight et al. 2006; Sutton and Dong 2012; Sutton and Hodson 2005), with significant warm anomalies from western Europe to about 45°E (Fig. 6a). However, since these are decadal anomalies, they are still fairly small compared to interannual variability. The largest warm anomalies occur around the Mediterranean. A significant portion of the warm SAT anomalies across Europe is related to the dynamical circulation, as shown by the dynamical SAT anomaly plot (Fig. 6c), but a larger portion is associated with the residual SAT anomaly, apart from over Scandinavia (Fig. 6e). Interestingly, the dynamical and residual anomaly patterns are similar over much of southern Europe, such that the circulation field acts to amplify the warming during the positive phase of the AMO. However, the residual SAT anomaly across southern Europe could be related to the thermodynamic impact of Mediterranean SST anomalies, which are anomalously warm during the warm phase of the AMO, particularly during summer and autumn (Fig. 5).\n\nThe influence of the AMO on summertime precipitation over Europe differs from the SAT in that the dynamical anomaly appears to have a dominant influence compared to the residual anomaly (Fig. 6). This is consistent with the larger fraction of variance (i.e., Fig. 3) explained by the dynamical anomaly compared with SAT. The cyclonic anomaly over northwestern Europe (i.e., Fig. 5a) is similar to the southern lobe of the negative summer NAO pattern and is thus associated with more storms and precipitation across northwestern Europe (Bladé et al. 2012; Folland et al. 2009). The dynamical anomaly is responsible for the large-scale features seen in the full anomaly field, with wetter conditions over the northwest of Europe and drier conditions over the southeast of Europe, during the warm phase of the AMO. The residual response does systematically mediate the dynamical anomalies somewhat over the Alps and over eastern Europe, however, where positive residual anomalies act to reduce the dry dynamical anomalies in all datasets.\n\nThe dynamical anomalies appear to dominate the response of the precipitation to the AMO more strongly than the SAT, particularly over northwestern Europe. This is also consistent with the impact of the summer NAO, which exhibits a stronger influence on European precipitation anomalies than on SAT anomalies (Bladé et al. 2012). To further investigate the control of the circulation on the SAT and precipitation anomalies over the northwestern Europe region, we now analyze indices of the SAT and precipitation averaged over the region (shown in Fig. 6), which are plotted in Fig. 7. Also plotted are the 5-yr averaged SAT and precipitation anomalies as well as the annual and 5-yr AMO indices; the correlation of the SAT and precipitation indices with the respective AMO indices is shown in each panel. A measure of the uncertainty in the decomposition is shown in shading for the annual time series and in bold vertical lines for the 5-yr time series. The uncertainty in the decomposition is relatively small compared to the signal, and it is clear that there is a systematic multidecadal variability in the residual SAT anomaly. Over northwestern Europe there are significant correlations between the annual AMO index and annual SAT (r = 0.32, significant at the 95% level), and between the 5-yr AMO index and 5-yr SAT (r = 0.57, significant at the 95% level), shown in Fig. 7a. Analysis of the decomposed anomaly indices reveals that the SAT response is dominated by the residual component, which is significantly correlated with the AMO on the annual time scale and particularly on the longer time scale (Fig. 7e) on which the AMO accounts for over 40% of the variance (i.e., r = 0.64, r2 = 0.41). This is consistent with the thermodynamic influence of the advection of warmer air from over the anomalously warm North Atlantic by the climatological summer westerlies, which flow directly over the northwestern Europe region [for climatologies, see, e.g., the “ERA-40 atlas” (Kållberg et al. 2005)].\n\nThe summer precipitation response to the AMO over northwestern Europe, however, is dominated by the dynamical component (Figs. 7b,d). The AMO exhibits less control on the precipitation though, as none of the components are significantly correlated with the 5-yr index (although in the second half of the time series there is a reasonable relationship). The dynamical index is particularly well correlated with the annual AMO index, but it is difficult to confidently assign a causal response to the annual AMO index because on interannual time scales extratropical SST anomalies (and a significant fraction of the AMO) are primarily forced by atmospheric circulation anomalies (Deser et al. 2010; Gulev et al. 2013). Nonetheless, these results do lend support to the notion that circulation anomalies exhibit a dominant role on the influence of the AMO on summertime precipitation, in comparison with the residual anomaly, particularly over northwestern Europe.\n\na. Sahelian rainy season\n\nOver the Sahel region, over 90% of the annual rainfall occurs during the West African monsoon season, which peaks during August. Here we define the Sahelian rainy season as the 5-month season centered on August [i.e., June–October (JJASO)]. The AMO has been linked to multidecadal precipitation variability over the Sahel during the rainy season (e.g., Folland et al. 1986; Knight et al. 2006; Mohino et al. 2011; Ting et al. 2009; Zhang and Delworth 2006), so it is of interest to decompose the influence of the AMO into its dynamical and residual components. The SLP anomaly2 associated with the AMO variability during the Sahelian rainy season is shown in Fig. 8. Low pressure anomalies are present across most of the tropical Atlantic (also in 20CR and HadSLP2). In particular, the significant low pressure anomaly in the tropical North Atlantic is similar to that found in previous studies (e.g., Martin and Thorncroft 2014b) and is related to an increase in the low-level West African westerly jet (Pu and Cook 2010) and associated moisture flux at around 10°N during warm AMO periods (Grist and Nicholson 2001), resulting in increased precipitation. Earlier studies found that high pressure over the tropical North Atlantic results in dry conditions over the Sahel (Hastenrath 1990). There is also a large-scale pressure gradient extending from the subtropical South Atlantic to the Sahel that is associated with cross-equatorial southerly wind anomalies, which extend onshore over the Gulf of Guinea, also resulting in increased precipitation (Hastenrath and Polzin 2011; Martin and Thorncroft 2014b).\n\nThe differences of the full and decomposed anomaly fields between warm and cold phases of the AMO are shown in Fig. 9. The largest SAT anomalies occur over North Africa, around the Mediterranean, where warm anomalies are associated with the warm phase of the AMO over Europe (cf. Fig. 6). The warm residual SAT anomaly over northwestern Africa is likely because of advection of warmer air by the climatological northerlies in this region and is robust among all three datasets (shown in Figs. S7 and S8). As highlighted in previous studies, the clearest impact of the AMO is in precipitation over the Sahel region. In the warm phase of the AMO there is a large increase in precipitation over the Sahel during the rainy season. The decomposed fields reveal an interesting dependency on the circulation anomalies. The dynamical precipitation anomalies are positive across most of the Sahel region but particularly near the west coast, where westerly wind anomalies tend to bring moist maritime air onto the continent, which is also evident in the decompositions using 20CR and HadSLP2 (Figs. S7, S8). The residual precipitation anomalies also contribute to the positive full precipitation anomalies, reinforcing the dynamical component across the Sahel, which may be related to increased moisture flux from over the warmer SSTs by the monsoon winds. The residual component is particularly large, however, over the eastern Sahel region (Fig. 9f). In this region, there are northerly climatological winds in the lower troposphere from the eastern Mediterranean, where SSTs are significantly warmer during the warm phase of the AMO (Fig. 4). This feature is also evident in the decomposition using HadSLP2 but to a lesser extent in 20CR (Figs. S8, S9). Modeling and observational studies have previously shown that Mediterranean SSTs exhibit some control over Sahel rainfall (Gaetani et al. 2010; Park et al. 2016); however, SSTs in the tropical North Atlantic still have a more direct influence. The residual precipitation anomalies over the eastern Sahel are therefore consistent with warmer and moister air flowing south from the eastern Mediterranean toward the Sahel (Park et al. 2016; Rowell 2003)."
