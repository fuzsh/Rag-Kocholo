During a seven-year field experiment, the response of winter wheat to five different sowing times was studied. The beginning of the dormancy period was determined, and the Growing Degree Day (GDD) requirements for the period from sowing to emergence and from emergence to dormancy were assessed. As the sowing date was delayed, the time from sowing to emergence increased. The minimum optimum temperature during the emergence period was about 12 °C, with a heat requirement of about 125–130 GDD for earlier sowings, ensuring that winter wheat germinated successfully and properly prepared for wintering. The heat requirement for later sowings was higher and reached about 180 GDD when the average temperature of this period was about 8 °C. For the late sowing, the period from emergence to dormancy was too short, so winter wheat did not accumulate the required amount of heat, which had a significant impact on yield. The accumulated temperature from emergence to dormancy must be greater than 100 GDD. The obtained values can be applied in other regions or to choose the appropriate wheat sowing time to reduce yield losses under climate change.

High-altitude measuring sites were arranged in the forest massif (mast, 16 m) and above the meadow vegetation (mast, 30 m). By the Giardina M. model and based on the measurements data the calculations of the deposition flux density of aerosol particles on forest and meadow vegetation were made. Our preliminary results of prediction obtained by Giardina M. model good agrees with measured dry deposition velocities across particle sizes. In the forest, the mass concentration of aerosol particles differs slightly from the mass concentrations in the grasslands and is equal on average 7.9 × 10−3 mg m−3 for the size particles below 200 nm (PM0.2) and 6.7 × 10−4 mg m−3 for particles in the size range from 0.2 to 10 μm (PM0.2–10). However, we found that mass flux density of aerosol particle is almost 4.8 times higher under forest canopy than in meadow vegetation. In addition, the leaf area index (LAI), which characterize the effective area of particle deposition, is also significantly higher in the tree canopy (5.6) compared to the grassland vegetation (2.4).

It used the dimidiate pixel model to invert FVC, and based on the centre of gravity migration model, the coefficient of variation and the Mann–Kendall and Sen’s slope estimator test, it studied the spatial variation trend and stability of FVC in the four relevant areas of the Inner Mongolia section; an attribution analysis using a geodetector was also conducted. The following results were found: (1) in terms of temporal FVC change in the relevant areas, from 2000 to 2020, the overall FVC showed an increasing trend, indicating an obvious hierarchy of change as per different seasonal scales (summer > growing season > fall > spring). There is a mutation point in FVC in different areas, and the FVC sequence is random. (2) Regarding spatial change, the overall FVC showed a trend of being high in the eastern regions and low in the western regions and low–high–low from the north to the south; the stability of the Hetao Irrigation District–Wuliangsuhai Area changed more significantly with the successive seasons, and the degraded areas of FVC were mainly distributed in the city centre of the Kundulun River–Daheihe River Area and in the Hetao Irrigation District in the summer. (3) In terms of driving factors, soil type had a relatively higher explanatory power regarding the Hetao Irrigation District–Wuliangsuhai Area, rainfall had a relatively higher explanatory power regarding the Morin River–Wuding River Area and the Kundulun River–Daheihe River Area, and land use had a relatively higher explanatory power regarding the Ten Kongtui–Heidaigou Area.

This study establishes a new method for numerically modeling the turbulent flow in and around forest shelterbelts using an advanced multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann model (MRTLBM). A detailed description is presented for a large eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent winds by implementing barrier element drag force in the MRTLBM framework. The model results for a forest shelterbelt are compared with a field observational dataset. The study indicated that our implementation of drag force in MRTLBM is an accurate method for modeling turbulent flows in and around forest patches. Sensitivity analyses of turbulent flow related to the shelterbelt structure parameters and wind directions are also carried out. The analysis indicated that the optimal wind shelter effect in reducing the mean wind speed and turbulent kinetic energy is maximized using a narrow, medium porosity shelterbelt, with the wind direction perpendicular to the shelterbelt. These conclusions are in agreement with other observational and modeling studies. Finally, the computational time of a central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) was compared for a large domain with 25 million grids to demonstrate the MRTLBM advantage of LES in regards to computational speed with a mixed forest and building environment. The GPU is approximately 300 times faster than a CPU, and real-time simulation for this large domain is achieved using the Nvidia V100 GPU.

Enhancing strong, noisy ground electromagnetic (EM) field data using synchronously recorded underground EM signals, which typically exhibit a high signal-to-noise ratio, is both valuable and feasible. In this study, we propose an EM field reconstruction method employing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network with referenced deep underground EM observations. Initially, a deep learning model was developed to capture the time-varying features of underground multi-component EM fields using the LSTM recurrent neural network. Subsequently, this model was applied to process synchronously observed strong, noisy data from other conventional observation systems, such as those at the surface, to achieve noise suppression through signal reconstructions. Both the theoretical analysis and the practical observational data suggest that the proposed method effectively suppresses noise and reconstructs clean EM signals. This method is efficient and time-saving, representing an effective approach to fully utilizing the advantages of deep underground observation data. Furthermore, this method could be extended to the processing and analysis of other geophysical data.

These results were used to describe the consequence of recent PM2.5 reductions on NO and O3 concentrations at different site types across the UK. The strongest positive [NO] vs. [PM2.5] correlation was observed for the Urban Traffic site type overall, but it displayed the weakest positive [O3] vs. [PM2.5] correlation. Analysis of individual Urban Traffic sites revealed an overall negative [O3] vs. [PM2.5] gradient at the London Marylebone Road (LMR) site. A sharp 35% PM2.5 decrease occurred at LMR between 2011 and 2015 before annual mean concentrations plateaued. Further examination of annual correlations revealed negative [O3] vs. [PM2.5] gradients in each year directly proceeding the sharp 35% PM2.5 decrease at LMR. NOx fluctuations were minimal and accompanied by comparable volatile organic compound (VOC) decreases; thus, VOC-limited chemistry at LMR was deemed to not be the primary cause of O3 increases. Instead, PM2.5 reductions are suggested to be a more significant factor in causing O3 increases, as suppression of O3 production by PM2.5 chemistry decreases with declining [PM2.5]. The remaining two Urban Traffic sites in Birmingham did not display a negative [O3] vs. [PM2.5] correlation in the years studied. This was partly ascribed to the Birmingham measurement sites not being under the influence of the street canyon effect like LMR. Principal attribution was to the lower-average absolute initial PM2.5 concentrations and absence of a significant (>26%) continuous mean PM2.5 decline of greater than 2 years. This study therefore proposed a threshold initial PM2.5 concentration (t) above which O3 suppression by PM2.5 chemistry is sufficient to induce O3 increases when average PM2.5 concentrations significantly decline (by >26% across >2 years), where 17 μg m−3 < t < 26 μg m−3. Extending this analysis to additional cities across the UK as sufficient data become available would allow refinement of the proposed threshold and improved understanding of the influence from the street canyon effect. These results inform future air pollution policies, in the UK and across the globe, in which further joint reductions of PM2.5 and O3 are crucial to achieve maximum benefits to human health.

The results show the following: (1) When precipitation particles occupy more than 20% of cloud layers detected by cloud radar, the ice–water mixed cloud layer descends and evolves into a precipitating cloud. (2) During surface precipitation periods, the proportion of raindrops forming precipitation was equivalent to that of small-scale precipitation particles in the cloud layers. The proportion of precipitation particles in the cloud layers with temperatures below 0 °C averaged 25%. Ice-phase particles within the bright band (BB) melted, coalesced, and grew into larger precipitation particles, increasing their proportion to 55%. (3) After surface precipitation ended, the water content and precipitation rate of the cloud layer were 60% and 52% of those during the precipitation process, respectively. The proportion of small-scale precipitation particles in the cloud layers was approximately half of that during the precipitation period. A large number of evaporated small-scale precipitation particles floated in the air layer below the clouds, occupying less than 6.0% of the cloud layers.

We use the Smell Pittsburgh dataset to develop a model that can reflect the relation between bad smell events and industrial pollutants in a specific urban territory. The initial dataset resulted from crowd-sourcing citizen reports using a mobile phone application, which we categorised in a binary matter (existence or absence of smell events). We investigate the mapping of smell data with air pollution levels that were recorded by a reference station located in the southeastern area of the city. The initial dataset is processed and evaluated to produce an updated dataset, which is used as an input to assess various ML and DL models for modelling smell events. The models utilise a set of air quality and climate data to associate them with a smell event to investigate to what extent these data correlate with unpleasant odours in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

In this work, a prediction model for the thawing depth of permafrost subgrade in the QTEC under the climate warming scenario was established. Based on the survey results of permafrost ice content along the QTEC and the classification of thawing settlement risks, the zoning characteristics of thawing settlement of permafrost subgrade in the QTEC were obtained and analyzed. The results showed that the thawing depth of permafrost underlying the 26 m width subgrade in the QTEC will mainly remain below 9 m, and the area with a thawing depth of 6~9 m will have the widest spread within the next 20 years. The thawing settlement will be between 0.02 m and 5.45 m, with an average value of about 0.93 m after 20 years. Furthermore, after 50 years, the thawing depth of permafrost underlying the 26 m width subgrade will almost always be greater than 9 m, and the average thawing settlement will be about 1.12 m. Within the next 20 to 50 years, the risk of permafrost subgrade thawing settlement in the QTEC will be the most significant risk type, and this effect will mainly be distributed in the Kunlun Mountains, Chumar River Plain, Kekexili Mountains, Beiluhe Basin, Tanggula Mountains and intermountain Basins.

Lidar sensing allows obtaining up-to-date information about natural and technogenic sources of atmospheric pollution. There is a wide range of problems in ecological control, where the deployment of an inexpensive mobile lidar network is required. For this purpose, it is suggested to use Q-switch and MOPA fiber lasers in lidars. Q-switch fiber lasers have a simpler design and are more practical to use. However, pulses from Q-switch lasers have long full-pulse durations. In the present work, a lidar signal inversion method (LSIM) is proposed for solving this problem. Verification and outdoor experimentation of the LSIM was carried out with the reference signal method (RSM). The advantage of the proposed RSM is the minimum number of controllable parameters necessary for LSIM verification and approbation. As a result, the accuracy of the obtained results increased. Thus, the possibility of application of the Q-switch fiber lasers for lidar sensing is shown both theoretically and experimentally.

The data in operation have not been widely used in numerical weather prediction. To ensure HY-2B data meet the theoretical assumptions for DA applications, the iterated reweighted minimum covariance determinant (IRMCD) QC method was studied in HY-2B data based on the typhoon “Chanba”. The statistical results showed that most of the outliers were eliminated, and the observation increment distribution of the HY-2B data after QC (QCed) was closer to a Gaussian distribution than the raw data. The kurtosis and skewness of the QCed data were much closer to zero. The QCed track demonstrated the lowest accumulated error and the best intensity in typhoon assimilation, and the QCed intensity was closest to the observation during the nearshore enhancement, exhibiting the strongest intensity among the experiment. Further analysis revealed that the improvement was accompanied by a significant reduction in vertical wind shear during the nearshore enhancement of the typhoon. The QCed moisture flux divergence and vertical velocity in the upper layer increased significantly, which promoted the upward transport of momentum in the lower layers and contributed to the maintenance of the typhoon’s barotropic structure. Compared with the assimilation of raw data, the effective removal of outliers using the IRMCD algorithm significantly improved the simulation results for typhoons.

The complex underlying surface composition of urban areas makes process-based and physiology-based models inadequate for simulating carbon flux in this context. In this study, long short-term memory (LSTM), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and artificial neural network (ANN) were employed to develop and investigate their viability in estimating carbon flux at the ecosystem level. All the data used in our study were derived from the long-term chronosequence observations collected from the flux towers within urban complex underlying surface, along with meteorological reanalysis datasets. To assess the generalization ability of these models, the following statistical metrics were utilized: coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). Our analysis revealed that the RF model performed the best in simulating carbon flux over long time series, with the highest R2 values reaching up to 0.852, and exhibiting the smallest RMSE and MAE values at 0.293 μmol·m−2·s−1 and 0.157 μmol·m−2·s−1. As a result, the RF model was chosen for simulating carbon flux at spatial scale and assessing the impact of urban impervious surfaces in the simulation. The results showed that the RF model performs well in simulating carbon flux at the spatial scale. The input of impervious surface area index can improve the performance of the RF model in simulating carbon flux, with R2 values of 84.46% (with the impervious surface area index in) and 83.74% (without the impervious surface area index in). Furthermore, the carbon flux in Fengxian District, Shanghai, exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity: the CO2 flux in the western part of Fengxian District was less than in the eastern part, and the CO2 flux gradually increased from the west to the east. In addition, we creatively introduced the diurnal impervious surface area index based on the Kljun model, and clarified the influence of impervious surface on the spatiotemporal simulation of CO2 flux over the complex urban underlying surface. Based on these findings, we conclude that the RF models can be effectively applied for estimating carbon flux on the complex underlying urban surface. The results of our study reduce the uncertainty in modeling carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems, and make the variety of models for the carbon cycling of terrestrial ecosystems more diverse.

Rainfall estimates have only been derived based on local data and characteristics so far, and have not yet been developed based on universal data for all of Indonesia. This study aimed to develop a rainfall estimation model based on weather radar data throughout Indonesia using ensemble machine learning with the gradient boosting algorithm. The proposed rainfall estimation model is universal, can be applied to different rainfall pattern areas, and has a temporal resolution of 10 min. It is based on determining the root mean square error (RMSE) and R-squared (R2) values. Research was conducted in six areas with different rainfall patterns: Bandar Lampung and Banjarmasin with monsoon rain patterns, Pontianak and Deli Serdang with equatorial rain patterns, and the Gorontalo and Biak areas with local rain patterns. The analysis of the proposed model reveals that the best hyperparameters for the learning rate, maximum depth, and number of trees are 0.7, 3, and 50, respectively. The results demonstrate that the estimated rainfall in the six areas was very accurate, with RMSE < 2 mm/h and R2 > 0.7.

The aim of the study was to investigate this topic using Haikou, a tropical city, as the research area. Outpatient data on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (CVD and CeVD) from Hainan Provincial People’s Hospital during 2016–2018 (total of 77,820) and meteorological and air-quality data were used to establish a distributed-lag nonlinear model (DLNM) based on the nested generalized addition model (GAM) of meteorological elements. The results revealed the impact on the risk of CVD and CeVD was mainly due to the cold effect, which significantly lagged behind. The thermal effect had a strong impact on the onset of CVD and CeVD on the day of high temperature. Males were easily affected by low temperatures, while females were the opposite. The lag period of the working-age group affected by low temperatures was longer and greater than that of the elderly group. The high-temperature effect only had an impact on the working-age group. The lag effect of low temperatures on the risk of hypertension was the greatest. These results can provide technical support for carrying out meteorological forecasting, warning, and services for individuals with CVD and CeVD, suggesting attaching importance to health protection for special populations.

Previous research focused on pollutant dispersion within street canyons and did not consider the coupling of indoor and outdoor pollutants. This paper employs the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method to simulate the dispersion characteristics of vehicle emission pollutants in street canyons, primarily investigating the indoor and outdoor pollutant dispersion patterns under various window opening configurations (single-sided ventilation, corner ventilation, and different positions of the glass under corner ventilation). Additionally, the study considers the impacts of the aspect ratio and ambient wind speed. Studies have shown that corner ventilation is effective in reducing indoor pollutant levels. When the two window glass positions are far away from the center of the intersection, the average CO mass fraction in the single-sided ventilation room is reduced by 87.1%. The average indoor CO mass fraction on the leeward side decreases with the increasing wind speed and aspect ratio. At a wind speed of 8 m/s, the average indoor CO mass fraction on the leeward side decreases to 2.45 × 10−8. At an aspect ratio of 2, the indoor CO mass fraction on the leeward side decreases with increasing floors before stabilizing at approximately 4.77 × 10−9. This study suggests optimal window opening strategies to reduce indoor pollutant levels in street-facing buildings at street intersections, offering guidance to indoor residents on window ventilation practices.

Firstly, the effect of topography is considered using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Next, a mesoscale model is presented to account for the effect of atmospheric stability. The effect of turbine wakes on the mean and fluctuating wind speeds are then represented by an advanced wake model. The model is validated using the measurement data of a wind farm located in the North of Japan. The measured wind data by Lidar at a reference height are horizontally extrapolated to a nearby met mast hub height and validated by a cup anemometer. Moreover, a novel averaging method is proposed to calculate a directional equivalent Monin–Obukhov length scale to account for the effect of atmospheric stability. Finally, the measured wind data at the reference height are vertically extrapolated and validated at the lidar location. The predicted mean and fluctuating wind speeds show good agreement with the measurements.

To achieve the aim of the study, two field experiments were conducted at a private farm in the Nubaria area of Beheira Governorate during the 2022 and 2023 seasons to quantify all the benefits from using fish water effluent (FWE) in irrigation. The obtained results indicated that the effluent could represent a good source of irrigation and bio-fertilization. The yield of tomato was higher when using FWE for irrigation compared with using groundwater for irrigation (IW). This was due to the additional amounts of dissolved bio-nitrogen along with other nutrients present in the FWE. The proportion of dissolved nitrogen added by using FWE was 22.3 kg nitrogen per hectare in 2022 and 24.6 kg nitrogen per hectare in 2023, in addition to some other major elements such as phosphorus and potassium, which are also among the main nutrients needed by crops. It has also been noticed that the fertility of the sandy soil increased with the use of FWE for irrigation. One of the most important results was the possibility of reducing the addition of nitrogen mineral fertilizers by 25%, thus saving on N fertilizers when growing tomato. In addition to the vitality of the FWE and its macro- and microelements, algae, microorganisms, and other organic materials, the use of this type of water as an alternative source for irrigation, along with the reduction in the amount of added mineral fertilizers, will reduce the degree of groundwater contamination with mineral fertilizers and increase the income of farmers. It was also observed that the air temperature decreased during the growing season when compared with the temperature of uncultivated surrounding areas.

Understanding the differences in the chemical compositions of size-resolved particulate matter (PM) in indoor air and outdoor air could aid in assessing the health impacts of air in these settings and establishing relevant regulation policies. In this study, indoor and outdoor size-resolved PM was collected from an office in Beijing in summer (between 5 and 25 July 2020) and winter (between 5 and 31 January 2021). Its chemical components, including sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, chlorine, organic matter (OM), elemental carbon (EC), crustal materials (CM), and heavy metals (HM), were analyzed. The mean levels of indoor and outdoor PM2.1 and PM9 were found to be much higher than those in the guidelines for PM2.5 and PM10 outlined by the National Ambient Air Quality Standard. Moreover, the levels of PM2.1 and PM2.1–9 mass were higher outdoors than they were indoors. The size distributions of mass concentrations were shown to be bimodal, peaking at 0.43–0.65 μm and 4.7–5.8 μm, respectively. The most abundant chemicals were OM, nitrate, and sulfate for PM2.1 and OM, CM, and nitrate for PM2.1–9. We found higher percentages of sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, EC, and HM in smaller-size fractions of PM. Additionally, positive matrix factorization showed that biomass burning, secondary inorganic aerosol, coal combustion, dust, traffic, and industrial pollution were the main sources of PM during the study period. The greatest non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic hazards were found at 0.43–0.65 μm in summer and 2.1–3.3 μm in winter. Our results indicate that size-resolved PM of ambient origin may infiltrate buildings near roads to varying degrees, resulting in negative health effects.

Tourism transportation is one of the important sources of carbon emissions, and reducing its carbon emissions is a key part of achieving China’s carbon reduction goals. Based on the panel data of various provinces and cities in North China from 2000 to 2022, this paper calculates the carbon emissions of tourism transportation by using the carbon emission coefficients of different transportation modes in different segments. Moreover, the temporal and spatial evolution of the tourism economy is systematically analyzed. The Tapio decoupling model and LMDI addition decomposition model are used to analyze the relationship between carbon emissions and tourism economic growth and the effects of 11 influencing factors on carbon emissions. The results show that: (1) The carbon emission of tourism transportation in North China has experienced four stages: a steady growth period, a transitional adaptation period, a stable equilibrium period, and a drastic decline period. The overall carbon emission level of tourism transportation is as follows: Hebei Province > Shanxi Province > Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region > Beijing City > Tianjin City. (2) The decoupling coefficient between tourism traffic carbon emissions and economic development fluctuates but mainly shows a weak decoupling state. (3) In terms of influencing factors, passenger size and passenger density have the greatest impact on the carbon emissions of tourism transportation.

Despite not being considered a major aeroallergen, some patients report respiratory symptoms upon exposure, with positive skin prick tests (SPT) to Casuarina pollen extract. This study investigates Casuarina pollen dispersal patterns in Sydney, Australia, over a 10-year period, from 2008 to 2018, revealing a bimodal distribution of pollen from September to October (southern hemisphere spring) and February to March (mid-late summer). Analysis of historical SPT data shows 20% of individuals with respiratory allergies reacting positively to Casuarina pollen extract, with almost 90% of these also reacting to grass pollen, suggesting potential cross-reactivity. Notably, there are no exclusive reactions to Casuarina pollen. Understanding the prolonged pollen season underscores the importance of year-round monitoring for accurate characterization. Currently lacking are commercially available skin test extracts or specific IgE assays for Casuarina sensitization, necessitating challenge studies to confirm clinical symptoms directly attributable to Casuarina pollen. By elucidating the seasonal dynamics and meteorological drivers of Casuarina pollen dispersion, alongside the potential allergenicity suggested by skin prick tests, this study paves the way for improved management of Casuarina-related allergies and highlights the critical need for further research on native Australian plant allergens.

More specifically, we investigate evaporation duct shape through a duct shape parameter, a parameter known to affect the propagation of X-band radar signals and is directly related to the curvature of the duct. Relationships between this duct shape parameter and air sea temperature difference (ASTD) reveal that during unstable periods (ASTD < 0), the duct shape parameter is generally larger than in near-neutral or stable atmospheric conditions, indicating tighter curvature of the M-profile. Furthermore, for any specific duct height, a strong linear relationship between the near-surface-specific humidity gradient and the duct shape parameter is found, suggesting that it is primarily driven by near-surface humidity gradients. The results demonstrate that an a priori estimate of duct shape, for a given duct height, is possible if the near-surface humidity gradient is known.

The monthly (from November to January) mean residual meridional circulation (RMC) was calculated for four different combinations of the main phases of ENSO and QBO using MERRA2 reanalysis data. It has been demonstrated that the QBO phase manifests itself in different vertical distributions of ozone in the equatorial stratosphere, as well as in strengthening/weakening of the secondary meridional circulation in the tropics. The enhancement of the RMC from the tropical to the polar stratosphere is stronger at altitudes where ozone is higher in the tropics under El Niño conditions. The RMC modification and intensification are observed from ozone-depleted areas under La Niña conditions. A “cumulative” effect is observed by February under La Niña conditions and the easterly QBO, which is expressed in the lowest ozone content in the polar stratosphere. The numerical experiments carried out using the Middle and Upper Atmosphere Model (MUAM) confirmed tendencies in changes in the meridional transport detected from the reanalysis data for different combinations of QBO and ENSO.

The monthly, daily, and hourly patterns of O3 and particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) are analyzed in this study using on-site data provided by an urban air quality monitoring network. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) method was used to compare differences in pollutant concentrations during different seasons and time periods. The spatial distributions of O3, PM2.5, and PM10 at different time points following interpolation of the air quality monitoring sites have been analyzed. The results show that the O3 concentration from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. was significantly higher than that in the morning and evening, and the concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. were significantly higher than those in the morning and afternoon. The number of qualified days for PM2.5 was less than 30 and unqualified days for O3 was more than 100 in 2019. There is a potential risk of exposure to pollution with associated health risks. Even on the same day, the spatial pollutant distributions at different time points can differ significantly. This study provides a scientific basis for reducing O3 and particulate matter exposure. Outdoor activities in the morning in summer are more beneficial to reduce O3 exposure, and outdoor activities should be curtailed in the evening in winter to reduce particulate exposure. This study provides a scientific basis for the government to formulate public health policies to reduce pollution exposure from outdoor activities.

The pollutant emission characteristics of in-use CNG taxis driving on a typical mountain city before and after three-way catalyst (TWC) replacement was examined using a modular on-board portable emissions measurement system (PEMS), the OBS-ONE developed by Horiba. The results showed that the exhaust NO of CNG taxis equipped with deactivation TWC exceeded the emission limits, even higher than gasoline vehicles. The high emission rate of CNG taxis is mainly concentrated on road slopes between a 2% and 6% gradient and a deceleration rate in the interval of [0.5, 4], respectively, which results in higher emissions from CNG taxis traveling in the mountain city of Chongqing than other cities and vehicles. Moreover, the pollutant emission rates of the in-use CNG taxis were highly correlated with the velocity and the vehicle specific power (VSP). After a new TWC replacement, the emission factors of carbon monoxide (CO), total hydrocarbons (THC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particle number (PN) decreased by 85.21–89.11%, 68.71–85.49%, 60.91–81.11%, and 62.26–68.39%, respectively. Our results will provide guidance for urban environments to carry out the comprehensive management of in-use vehicles and emphasize the importance of TWC replacement for CNG taxis.

In our paper, slant total electron content (STEC) along small-satellite constellation–automatic identification system (AIS) signal rays is used for computerized ionospheric tomography (CIT) over sea areas, and small-satellite constellations can provide more effective signal rays than a single satellite. An adjustment factor δ is introduced to optimize the initial electron density for the multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique (MART). The CIT results reconstructed by a traditional MART and our new method at 00:00 and 06:00, 15 March 2022, are compared, and our new method produces about a 15% and over 40% improvement in average deviation (AD) and root-mean-square error (RMSE). The results show that the bigger the difference between δ and 1, the better improvement will be in the 3D CIT process. The initial electron density is well selected during CIT when δ is approximate to 1, which is the case at 12:00, and the reconstructed 3D electron density, applying the initial ne and the adjusted initial ne, are both close to the true electron density. The small-satellite constellation–AIS signals are valuable resources for electron density reconstruction in sea areas.

However, current characteristics of the period of occurrence of the rainy season in the Eastern Northeast Brazil (ENEB) region demonstrated that maximum precipitation varies substantially depending on the period analyzed. From 1972 to 2002, the rainy season occurred during the June–July–August (JJA) quarter, while from 1981 to 2011, it occurred in the April–May–June (AMJ) quarter. To access how these differences may be due to different patterns of sea surface temperature (SST), using observed precipitation and SST data from NOAA for the period from 1982 to 2018, this study identified the spatial patterns of inter-annual changes in Pacific and Atlantic SST related to the occurrence of the ENEB rainy seasons. We focus on the statistical method of symmetric mean absolute percentage error (sMAPE) for forecasting these periods based on SST information. Our results revealed five different quarterly periods (FMA, MAM, AMJ, MJJ, JJA) to the rainy season, in which MJJ is more prevalent. The sMAPE values of the SST patterns are inversely proportional to precipitation in the ENEB. Hence, it may be concluded that our climate analysis demonstrates that seasonal SST patterns can be used for forecasting the period of the rainy season.

However, due to the scarcity of researchers in this field and the complexity of analyzing the spatial and temporal dynamics of aerosols, there is a gap in research in this area, which we hope to fill. In this study, we constructed a new fusion algorithm based on the V5.2 algorithm and the second-generation deep blue algorithm through the introduced weight factor of light and dark image elements. We used the algorithm to analyze the spatial and temporal changes in aerosols from 2009–2019. Seasonal changes and the spatial distribution of aerosol optical depth (AOD) were analyzed in comparison with the trend of weight factor, which proved the stability of the fusion algorithm. Spatially, the AOD values in the northeastern bare lands and southeastern woodland decreased most significantly, and combined with the seasonal pattern of change, the AOD values in this region were higher in the spring and fall. In these 11 years, the AOD values in the spring and fall decreased the most, and the aerosol in which the AOD decreases occurred should be the cooling-type sulfate aerosol. In order to verify the accuracy of the algorithm, we compared the AOD values obtained by the algorithm at different time intervals with the measured AOD values of several AERONET stations, in which the MAE, RMSE, and R between the AOD values obtained by the algorithm and the measured averages of the 12 nearest AERONET stations in the QTP area were 0.309, 0.094, and 0.910, respectively. In addition, this study also compares the AOD results obtained from the fusion algorithm when dynamically weighted and mean-weighted, and the results show that the error value is smaller in the dynamic weighting approach in this study.

Zonons are wave packets produced by energetic large-scale Rossby–Haurwitz wave modes ‘enslaving’ other wave modes. They propagate westward with the phase speed of the enslaving modes. Zonons can be visualized as enslaving modes’ ‘ringing’ in the enslaved ones with the frequencies of the former, the property that renders zonons non-dispersive. Zonons reside in high-shear regions confined between the opposing zonal jets yet they are mainly attached to westward jets and sustained by the ensuing barotropic instability. They exchange energy with the mean flow while preserving their identity in a fully turbulent environment, a feature characteristic of solitary waves. The goal of this study is to deepen our understanding of zonons’ physics using direct numerical simulations, a weakly non-linear theory, and asymptotic analysis, and ascertain that zonons are indeed isomorphic to solitary waves in the Korteweg–de Vries framework. Having this isomorphism established, the analysis is extended to eddies detected in the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn based upon the observed mean zonal velocity profiles and earlier findings that circulations on both planets obey the regime of zonostrophic macroturbulence. Not only the analysis confirms that many eddies and eddy trains on both giant planets indeed possess properties of zonons, but the theory also correctly predicts latitudinal bands that confine zonal trajectories of the eddies.

While air pollution control systems (APCSs) capture pollutants, the resulting sludge/fly ash (SFA) requires further treatment due to residual PCDEs and other harmful substances. This study investigated a hazardous waste thermal treatment system (HAWTTS) utilizing flameless combustion technology alongside a multistage APCS (scrubbers, cyclone demisters, bag houses). SFA from the APCS was recirculated for secondary combustion. PCDE levels were measured before and after each unit within the HAWTTS. The HAWTTS achieved a remarkable overall PCDE removal efficiency of 99%. However, the incinerator alone was less effective for low-chlorine PCDEs. Scrubbers and bag houses exhibited lower removal efficiencies (17.8% and 30.9%, respectively) due to the memory effect. Conversely, the cyclone demister achieved a high removal rate (98.2%). Following complete APCS treatment, PCDE emissions were significantly reduced to 1.02 ng/Nm3. While SFA still contained some PCDEs, the flameless combustion’s uniform temperature distribution enhanced combustion efficiency, minimizing overall PCDE emissions. This system demonstrates significant potential for mitigating PCDE pollution from incinerators. Further research could focus on optimizing treatment processes to address residual PCDEs in SFA.
