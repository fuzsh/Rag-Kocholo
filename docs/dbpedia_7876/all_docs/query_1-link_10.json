        "text": "PART ONE\n\nYul Brynner is, quite simply, The King... Man and role have long since merged into a fixed image that is as much a part of our collective consciousness as the Statue of Liberty.\n\n— Frank Rich, New York Times\n\nPrologue\n\nWell, here it is, you old rogue elephant: the mystery of your origins and the paradox of your career, revealed by your only son. But this is not only your story, it is also the story of my life with you, because I am the wax in which you left your deepest impression.\n\nWhen I was a little boy I spent many nights sitting in a dark, hushed theater filled with grownups weeping as they watched the death of the King, and I tried to imagine how your life would really end. We used to laugh about the book I'd write someday, recounting your adventures—this very book. Little could we have guessed exactly how this story would end.\n\nI held your hand as you died, Father: it was as close as I will ever come to experiencing my own mortality. Since that night you have challenged me, with all the terrible energy of the dead, to make sense of your far-flung odyssey, weaving together the truths that only you and I knew about your life. And so I climbed my mountain alone, and for a hundred nights I shouted thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls, until my lungs almost burst; but you were not there. Then I cursed you long and loud, shouting Damn your dust, Yul Brynner. Do you hear me? Damn your dust! And a thousand nights I wept.\n\nThat's OK, Dad. Everything is OK now.\n\nIt was in the unfolding of your life that I found the answers I have sought all along this crooked mile: in the story of your childhood there is much that explains my own. I have tried to experience your life as you did, year upon year, without knowing what would happen next. Gradually, events that once had seemed like a series of accidents began fusing together like parts of a plot, and as that plot unfolded, what emerged was a parable of power.\n\nYes, Father, you became King. Six days a week for almost fifteen years you demonstrated your command of the theater. Eight million loyal subjects came to your kingdom to pay homage. The final night of your reign came thirty-four years after the first—few real monarchs last so long. You were King all right, but at such a fearsome cost that no one could envy the Faustian deal you had made with yourself. Ultimately, the price of that ersatz royalty was everything else you held dear. Because all the power you had amassed could not control the terrible consequences of your own arrogance, and all the validation in the world was not enough to satisfy your hunger for praise. This, then, is the story of how a man became an artist, how the artist became King, and how the King became a slave to his own ego.\n\nOld man, I loved you as only your son could. The whole world admired you, but I admired you more. `Yul Brynner's son:' for years this mixed blessing was the central fact of my existence. Truly, I have been among the most fortunate people ever born; but I could not survive as an appendage of your persona, and therefore, I was bound to disappoint you. For that you never really forgave me. Forgiveness was never exactly your forte. Suffering fools gladly was not your specialty, either, and much of my life I have been a fool—I freely confess that at the outset.\n\nYou regarded your only son as the extension of your own soul into the next generation: when I was a child, you loved me the same way you loved yourself. But when it came time to tear myself free from your kingdom, it seemed to you as if your own right arm was rebelling against your authority. I could not hope to survive without an identity—not sober, anyway. Neither could I inherit your power, for we must each make our own.\n\nWhat was the source of your power, and what was its impact on your life? Did your power bring you happiness, or take it away? This is all big game, even for a practiced hunter. But to examine your amazing life from my vantage-point I must aim high, knowing that if I miss I may scar myself for the rest of time. Of course, there is much in our lives and our friends' that I would not write about, out of a taste for discretion as much as a distaste for litigation. No doubt I am revealing much more than you would like: so be it. This book does not tell all: it says what needs to be said. Neither I nor anyone who is reading can judge your soul and all its epic contradictions, but I am compelled to assess your achievements and your failures, in order to get on with my own. You played the hand you were dealt, and it was not a very promising one. With single-mindedness bordering on monomania, as well as with the luck of the draw, you turned that hand into a winner. Like other mortals, when you bluffed, you usually paid a terrible price.\n\nMust there always be a period of conflict between generations, expressed or repressed? Why do parents and children confront each other head-on over the very qualities they share? Our clashes lasted more than a decade before we reached an uneasy truce. Whatever subject we began with, we usually ended up arguing about your right, and the Divine Right of the chosen few, to overlook such fundamental principles of behavior as the Golden Rule. And, at the center of all our duels was whether the hand you dealt me was mine to play, or yours.\n\nAlas, Father, though you wished it so, there is no perfect arithmetic of the spirit, no zero-sum morality. Our transgressions cannot be ignored because of the magnitude of our virtues, and moral complexities cannot be willed into simplicities, even by the toughest gunslinger. In the sloppy, imperfect domain of human affairs, relativism prevails and paradoxes abound. Generosity is repaid with resentment, our loved ones always hurt us the most, and there are liars in public places. Throughout our lives we watch monsters mimic morality, while saints commit atrocities.\n\n`Tis a puzzlement.\n\nFor some twenty years I was your son, your side-kick and your Sancho Panza; that means I learned a thing or two about mending windmills. Living at the edge of your volcano, physically and psychologically, I had to know what was on your mind. So I make no apology for asserting the thoughts and motives behind your adventures—you always made damn sure I knew what you were thinking. It was important to you that your son understand the decisions you made. Growing up with a father who boasted frankly that he had an ego as big as your average-sized aircraft-carrier, I learned a million things I probably would have never discovered otherwise. Most of those lessons have not been especially useful in the world of real people and real problems; still, they were lessons well-learned. As Mark Twain put it, Anyone who's held a bull by the tail knows four or five things more than someone who hasn't.\n\nIf I seem to know your weaknesses especially well, it is because I share them all. Your talent is gone forever, but most of your faults are alive and well, Father, right here with me. I did not inherit your power: just the arrogance that went with it. I've failed myself far more than you failed me.\n\nSo this narrative must serve as our legacy. For more than forty years the world has speculated about your origins. That is because you lied to every major publication in America. The saga of our family was dramatic enough, set in the culture of Dr. Zhivago, to the music of Tchaikovsky, then flung to every corner of the globe. Now, for your grandchildren, and their grandchildren, the truth. Of course, they will know you from your films, but that was only a small part of the whole adventure. And besides, that was not you: it was the King of Siam, or Dimitri Karamazov, or Rameses, Pharaoh of all Egypt. Lest, in your absence, we lose sight of the distinction.\n\nOne day, Father, our eyes will meet again, wearing different faces. That day will come. And I will meet you by the witness-tree...\n\nChapter One—Oriental Enigma\n\n––––––––\n\nSilence.\n\nIn that silence imagine all the magic of fire, its shafts rising to spike the black hood of night. You can see the great bonfire a hundred miles—shalmi versti—dancing against the naked horizon as it lofts cinders like fireworks with every towering draft. Before you come close enough to feel its heat, you can hear the gypsies' guitars, and feel their power in the air.\n\nEvery summer, the Tziganes gathered beside this river to hold court and settle feuds, to trade jewels, gold and horses, and to elect their leader, anointed as if royalty. All through the boastful night, alive with brandy and brawling, the men exchanged their yarns and challenges. Later, the women would welcome them to their tents with fiery whispers.\n\nBut, early on this summer night, the women gathered around the most beautiful girl in the kumpania. Her labor had already begun, so her sisters lashed her to a tree-trunk, as is customary for delivering a firstborn. Her name was Mara, and she kept her eyes fixed on the moon, round and full as her straining belly. At last, she cried out once, and her son was born directly upon the earth, before anyone had even touched him. Swiftly, the cord was cut with a Cossack dagger, won in battle, and, as the manchild exhaled his first breath, the bonfire flickered and expired. An ember leapt past his shoulder, and burned the letters YUL into his skin; from the people, a cheer rose up to the heavens. Then, baptizing the magical infant in the music of his people, a low, dark voice began to sing: Okontchen poots...\n\nIf Yul could have invented his own birth, it might have gone something like that. He would have created himself from thin air, had it only been possible. Through parthenogenesis or some mystical process, he would have had himself erupt from the molten core of the planet, with lava for afterbirth. Frankly, in the polite, repressed atmosphere of the nineteen fifties when his stardom began, he might just as well have come from Mars. At a time when America was acting as if it was one big PTA meeting, Yul Brynner almost constituted a new species. Even his name was a mystery: one cannot confidently guess from which continent those three syllables emerged, for it is neither European nor Oriental. This enigmatic name was the providential first component in Yul's power for self-invention. Then the brightness of his stardom made an opaque riddle of Yul's early life, and cast a shadow across our ancestors. This is also their story, as told by those who knew Yul's grandfather, Jules: it was with his adventurous departure from our Swiss ancestral village that the Brynner odyssey began.\n\nSometime in the 1840s, Dr. Johann Bryner married a young girl named Verena Linck in their hamlet of Möriken-Wildegg, near Zurich. By the late 1840s their sixth child, Jules, had been born. While the family was Swiss-German, and well-educated, they were also poor: the practice of medicine was experimental at best, and the local doctor of a small village was not a wealthy man. According to remnants of family legend, it seems Johann and Verena were unable to afford their youngest son an education. But Jules was not eager for classroom learning, he hungered for adventure, and set out, determined to see the world beyond those land-locked, mountainous vistas. He never looked back, and never lived there again. An independent spirit, Jules was able to sever all emotional bonds to his family, and cut himself off completely from his past. He was fourteen years old.\n\nIn the nineteenth century pirates roamed the seas from the North African shoreline to the Orient. Their swift-sailing schooners with bellying canvass preyed upon the valuable cargo of ships from the Orient: silk from China, spices from Japan, and silver from Manchuria. It was in the galley of a pirate ship that Jules found work. The captain took the boy on and befriended him, promising to deliver him safely to Japan. Periodically, though, during the many months of travel, the pirates would lock young Jules in the galley without explanation. For hours he would sit with the cook, listening to the thunder of cannon above, and the murderous mayhem of search and plunder. Later, with the rest of the crew, he would swab the blood from the decks.\n\nJules was sixteen when the schooner arrived off the coast of Japan, near Yokohama. In America, the Civil War was just ending. Members of the small community of European merchants in and about Yokohama, found Jules a job as clerk to an elderly English gentleman who ran his own export company, mostly from his desktop. In a few months Jules became indispensable and, within a year or two, he was accepted almost as a son. When the Englishman died, Jules became a wealthy and powerful fellow, responsible for a small shipping empire, with offices in ports throughout the Orient. He renamed it the Bryner Company. In only a decade the young adventurer went from a life of poverty in Möriken-Wildegg to prosperity in Japan. He married and had children. Jules Bryner had already lived a full life, but it was only beginning. A few years later, Jules left Japan and abandoned his family there—again, without looking back. He traveled to nearby Vladivostok, in the Russian orient, to expand his enterprises. Vladivostok was a cultured if provincial outpost and Jules soon became a well-respected local figure—and remained there for the rest of his life.\n\nIgnoring his earlier marriage, Jules's married Natalia Kurkutova, the daughter of a Mongolian Prince. Few ever spoke well of her, it seems. Her brother, the Chief Justice of Vladivostok, was widely loved for his sensitivity and compassion: Natalia was not. Whatever qualities she possessed that attracted Jules, an affectionate and subservient nature was not among them. In their photographs, Jules appears more sensitive and refined than the stern, stocky Natalia, whose ancestors were said to be descended from Genghis Khan.\n\nNatalia and Yuli Ivanovich, (as Jules was now called) had six children. Their large house on Svetlanskaya Street came alive with the muted joy of the children playing within earshot of a hostile matriarch and an often-absent patriarch. Natalia seems to have preferred her sons to her daughters; her favorite was Boris, the most handsome.\n\nWhen they graduated from gymnasium, Jules sent all three sons to university in Petrograd, the cultural center, now named Leningrad: Switzerland was not even considered. There, Boris studied mineralogical engineering, with a view toward taking charge of the silver mines that belonged to the family business on the island of Tetuhe, in Siberia. And it was there that he fell in love with Marousia Blagavidova, the daughter of a Russian doctor who also lived in Vladivostok. The Blagavidovs, though not wealthy folk, like the Bryners, were members of the modern intelligentsia. Marousia's father Dimitri was the son of a Jew named Shary, who had taken the name Blagavidov upon his conversion to Orthodoxy.\n\nBoris and Marousia were an attractive couple. Boris was self-centered, willful, with absolutely no ability to manage money, and a number of engineering schemes that sounded downright dreamy. One of his later inventions, however, proved very valuable to the Chinese: a sort of pressboard for light construction that could be made cheaply from vegetable fibers. Marousia, a pretty girl with a sweet soprano voice and a sophisticated sense of humor, had almost completed her studies at the Conservatory of St. Petersberg, when Boris insisted that he could not tolerate having a wife who was an actress. With lasting regret, Marousia renounced her acting career for the sake of marriage. They were married in 1914 in Petrograd, where their daughter was born two years later. They christened her Vera Bryner. Soon after, they returned to Vladivostok and settled in the Bryner compound of apartments.\n\nBoris's brother Felix caused their mother further distress by marrying Marousia's sister, Vera. But events sweeping across Russia soon dwarfed this unpleasantness. Felix accepted a commission as a white officer, to fight the Bolshevik Revolution. In fact, by 1917 Felix was keeping the peace in Petrograd when he tugged a hotblooded speaker, Vladimir Ilyitch Lenin, from a makeshift podium.\n\nOn July 11, 1920, in the presence of her sister, Marousia gave birth to a son. She and Boris Yulievitch agreed to name the child after the family patriarch, Jules, who lived just long enough to see his grandson Yul christened in the Russian Orthodox church. Felix and his wife and their baby daughter Irena had also settled in Vladivostok, in close proximity to the explosive Natalia, who hated the two sisters that had married her sons with a furor that is hard to explain. The old matron spent all her days with her beloved parrot, who called her `Mama,' and for months Natalia taught the parrot to shout, Blagavidova looks like a skinned ferret! She even tried training the bird to fly into the window of one of the sisters' apartment. Instead, to her dismay, the parrot settled for several days on a perch outside Natalia's window, screeching, Mama looks like a skinned ferret.\n\nWhen I was growing up, my mother and I often walked across the campus of Columbia University to the playgrounds on Riverside Drive, and sometimes it dimly occurred to me how very different your childhood was from mine—so different, it seemed, that no comparisons could be drawn at all, and no lessons inferred. When I was seven, you described to me how Cossacks might ride all day, then cut a steak from their horse's flank for lunch—and ride on till sunset. I knew this was not approved practice at the Claremont Riding Academy on Central Park West.\n\nBut strange as you were, I belonged to that strangeness. In some very immediate way I was a part of that exotic background, just as it was part of me, and so I acquainted myself with my heritage the best I could, through the sound of all its languages—Gypsy songs, Chinese provinces, Russian Cyrillics, French poets, British actors. But most of all, it was the songs of the Tziganes, which you sang at every party. I would awake at night to this most powerful, soulful sound - a sort of melodic grief, or tuneful wailing: I would burst in upon the grownups before the first song ended. Those songs represented all the ancestors I would ever know—because that is what they represented to you.\n\nYet, when it came to specifics about your early life, I had trouble piecing together the odds and ends that I picked up from different sources—especially from other members of the family, whose recollections were noticeably lacking in Siberian tiger hunts, gatherings of the Tziganes, or circus acrobats. When I asked you to clarify these inconsistencies, sometimes you just gazed off toward the horizon and replied: The facts of my life have nothing to do with the realities of my existence. Whatever that meant, I knew for certain that you meant it.\n\nBy 1921, the revolution and famine had extended across Russia to Vladivostok: so did the daily threat to wealthy bourgeois families like the Bryners, whose politics were more anti-Bolshevik than pro-czarist. Among wealthy families, one heard stories of revolutionaries abducting children, and smashing babies' heads against walls. The day came when the new proletarian government obliged foreign families to choose between Soviet citizenship or exile. Passionately Russian in their outlook, the Bryners chose Soviet citizenship for the family, and laid aside their Swiss documents. During the 1930s, after all, much of the family's business was in Siberia, although the Bryner Company had offices throughout Northern China, in Harbin, Dairen, Peping, Tientsin and Shanghai. Yet for all the growing horror of the revolution, what happened next caused even greater turmoil within the family.\n\nYul was only four when his father Boris Yulietich fell in love with an actress at the Moscow Arts Theatre. Soon after Boris met Katya, he wrote to Marousia and explained bluntly that their marriage was over: he would devote his life to this enchantress. Boris did not even bother to seek a divorce from his wife. Under emergency statutes of the provisional government, all Boris had to do was declare to the magistrate that, since his wife was nowhere to be found, she was dead or missing.\n\nIn anguish and shame, Marousia left the Bryner compound in Vladivostok with her children Vera and Yul, 8 and 4 respectively. They settled with Vera, Felix, and Irena in a small country house outside of Vladivostok. Her love despoiled, her loyalty desecrated, the grief and chaos conjoined, Marousia never fully recovered from the abandonment. It was almost as if, when her husband had declared her dead, part of her had simply obeyed.\n\nRussia had been savaged. On a trip to Petrograd, the family saw the devastation: in village after village, railroad stations became the residence for thousands of luckier peasants. Boris decided to leave the Soviet Union for good, and settled in Harbin with Katya. Marousia took young Vera and Yul to Harbin as well, where they attended the best school in the region, run by the YMCA.\n\nAs a child, Yul was noted for his creativity, and his musical family heartily encouraged it. At Christmas and other occasions, it was customary for the children to dress up in costume and perform bits of poetry or song, and Yul threw himself enthusiastically into this play. Yul's first performance as an actor was as a squirrel in one of the family's Christmas pageants.\n\nEven as a boy Yul was handsome, but it wasn't just his looks that attracted others. There was a compelling urgency to his needs and demands, and an obsessive tenacity of purpose. When he wanted something, he did not quit till he got it. Though life in Harbin had gradually acquired some degree of normalcy for Yul, at fourteen he was already quite beyond his mother's control.\n\nYul's sister Vera, at 18, was beautiful, passionate, and spoiled. She was also a remarkable singer, as Marousia had been, before Boris ended her career. In 1934, despite Boris's vagaries about financial support, Marousia risked what little stability they had in Harbin and set out for Paris where her daughter could pursue a career as a singer, Yul could have access to culture, and they could all escape the vicissitudes of war.\n\nThe white Russian community in Paris had grown dramatically since the Bolshevik revolution. Its influence reached far beyond the quartier where the Russian orthodox church was located—especially in the evenings. At the theater Stanislavsky's influence was dominant, and there were Georges and Ludmilla Pitoëff, who were often called the Lunt and Fontanne of France, especially by each other. Igor Stravinsky had redefined the orchestra, Diaghliev had rewritten the rules of ballet, and Paris cheered Nijinsky, Anna Pavlova, and the young Serge Lifar. The leading star of opera in France was the great baritone Fyodr Chaliapin, especially in Boris Goudonov. Russian restaurants and clubs, with their spiced vodkas and gypsy music, were the rage. This was the Paris awaiting Yul.\n\nYul and his sister came to know their way around the French capital with the help of the Russian community. Settling in Rue Catule-Mendès, Marousia got in touch with a family friend, whose son was secretary to the dancer Serge Lifar. Through Lifar, arrangements were made for Yul to go to one of the foremost private lycées in France, Moncelle, the Gallic equivalent of Eton or Harrow. Singing classes were arranged for Vera, who had a passionate though unrequited attraction to Lifar, who was bisexual. And Marousia settled in melancholy exile, forever awaiting money from Boris to pay the bills, and struggling to cope with daily problems in a foreign language. Boris hardly ever visited his children, and when he failed to send child support, she received help from Felix and his wife, who, by then, had brought Irena to settle in Switzerland, the land that Jules had abandoned sixty years earlier.\n\nFourteen-year-old Yul, now on the loose in Paris, had charm, guile, and a powerful sense of entitlement toward the fineries of life. Perhaps to compensate for the absence of their father, Marousia spoiled both her children, then tried too late to rein them in. Once she even took her son to consult a psychiatrist: the diagnosis was that he was willful, not disturbed. Yul was energetic, mischievous, clever and uninhibited, even before he met the gypsies. He had already concluded that he was unique enough to merit special privileges. After all the name of his grandfather, the family patriarch, had been handed down to him, as if it were a hereditary title, and he vowed someday to name his own son Yul.\n\nLycée Moncelle was the first environment Yul had encountered that tried to discipline him. The school failed, and everyone suffered in the attempt. Yul's exchanges with his teachers were more often physical than intellectual. He was brilliant but lazy, the extrovert in the back row—the teacher's perpetual bane. In the eighth grade, for example, he persuaded all the students to face the back of the class when the teacher entered the room.\n\nHe had only a rudimentary knowledge of French, at first. Apart from a scattering of Chinese dialects and some schoolroom English, he was fluent only in Russian. But it wasn't languages he was known for. Classmates at Moncelle remembered Yul's strength most of all, not only in schoolyard fights, but in his many feats of endurance. Yul accepted any challenge or dare that involved stamina, pain, and boasting rights. He quickly gained a reputation as one of the roughest kids in school, and he liked it that way. He was not a success in team sports, but excelled in gymnastics, swimming, skiing, and pelote, (Basque jai alai). Having learned some hatha yoga in the Orient, he could hold his breath underwater longer than anyone, including the seniors. In fact, it was generally agreed that Yul could whistle louder, climb higher, run faster and piss further than any kid there. But he did not spend much time on school grounds. He stayed at Moncelle for two school years, but he probably had less than six months in residence, and even then, his attendance record was wretched. For a real education, he kept running away from school—to Paris.\n\nLifar's secretary took Yul and Vera to one of the restaurants where the Tzigani were the star attraction. From the first, Yul felt completely at ease with the Russian gypsies, and, as a teenager who was welcome backstage at a nightclub, his prospects in Paris improved. In short order he acquired a guitar, probably promising his mother he would take singing lessons. This he did and, though memorizing was never his forte, he learned the complete baritone part of Don Giovanni. But instead of playing classical guitar, he found a small gypsy seven-string, and began to learn the songs of the Tzigani—Because, as the gypsies insist: The truth can only be spoken in Rom.\n\nYul had the good fortune to fall in with a family called Dimitrievitch. Of the four main tribes of European gypsies—the Lowara, the Tshurara, the Kalderasha and the Matchvaya—the Dimitrivetich were of that branch of the Kalderash who represented an important tradition in the decadent Czarist years. It was at the Tzigane village of Mokroie, outside Moscow, that the royal family came to drink, gamble, and wench. It was probably true that Ivan Dimitrievitch, the gypsy patriarch, had performed for Rasputin, before moving his clan to Paris in the twenties.\n\nIvan's three children, Aliosha, Valia and Marukha were just"
