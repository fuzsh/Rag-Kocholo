        "text": "In the 1960 western \"The Magnificent Seven,\" elders in an isolated Mexican village are desperate to defend it from an annual raid of marauders that every year leaves the town more traumatized, helpless and poor. The villagers' desperation leads them north of the border, where they recruit seven American vigilantes in the hope that they'll defeat the bandits who have all but destroyed the town's way of life.\n\nStarring Steve McQueen, James Coburn and Yul Brynner, \"The Magnificent Seven\" is, to a certain extent, a celebration of white man as pistol-wielding western hero. What if the vigilantes brought in to protect a Mexican village weren't white outsiders but Mexican natives who had moved to the States in search of work, leaving their towns with a depleted male presence? And what if the bandits weren't the villains of the dusty past, but modern-day drug lords bent on terrorizing and enslaving a town made up primarily of women, children and the elderly?\n\nThen you would have the story of Nayeli, the heroine of Luis Alberto Urrea's novel \"Into the Beautiful North,\" which, adapted for the stage by Karen Zacarias, has its theatrical premiere at Portland's Milagro Theatre beginning Friday, April 29.\n\nDirected by Olga Sanchez and Daniel Jaquez, the theatrical version of \"Into the Beautiful North\" is subtitled \"An Adventurous Quest.\" The adventure belongs primarily to Nayeli, a young woman working in a taco shop in the fictional village of Tres Camarones, a close-knit but struggling Mexican coastal town. Nayeli spends the bulk of her time waitressing and trying to help her aunt, Irma, become the town's first female mayor, but she soon realizes there are more serious issues at foot. Namely, that nearly all of the village's male residents, including her father, have decamped for the U.S. hoping to create better lives for themselves and their families. This mass exodus has left Tres Camarones vulnerable to attack.\n\nDetermined to save Tres Camarones from extinction and inspired by \"The Magnificent Seven\" (itself inspired by Akira Kurosawa's \"The Seven Samurai\"), Nayeli and three friends travel to the States seeking Mexican natives willing to help defend the village against an approaching band of ruthless drug traffickers.\n\nAccording to Vicente Guzman-Orozco of El Hispanic News, the fact that Zacarias (known for her award-winning plays \"Legacy of Light\" and \"Mariela in the Desert\") and Urrea (a Pulitzer Prize finalist) are teaming with Sanchez and Jaquez to tell Nayeli's story is something to celebrate in itself. There's also the fact that \"Into the Beautiful North\" focuses on the very human toll that drug-related violence and immigration have taken on the Mexican people.\n\n\"With all these accomplished individuals together,\" Guzman-Orozco wrote, \"Milagro is preparing a story that is ancient and timely at once, and that may be the most exciting part.\"\n\nDiscussions will follow each Sunday matinee. Panelists include Urrea as well as Portland-area professors and professionals specializing in Latino/Chicano issues.\n\nInto the Beautiful North\n\nWhen: 7:30 p.m. Thursday-Saturday, 2 p.m. Sunday, April 29-May 28\n\nWhere: Milagro Theatre, 525 S.E. Stark St."
