        "text": "Bouncing between the stage and the silver screen throughout his career, Yul Brynner was one of the most versatile actors of the fifties, sixties, and beyond. A Russian-born thespian, Brynner immigrated to the states in 1940, but his career really took off in 1951 when he took the stage as King Mongkut of Siam in The King and I, a performance that would come to define his legacy as an actor. From there, he appeared in such films as The Ten Commandments, The Magnificent Seven, and Anastasia, racking up over forty credits in his four-decade career.\n\nSimilarly to his character in The King and I, much of Brynner's appeal was situated in the juxtaposition between his hard outer shell and the softer, more sympathetic character that lay at his core. The actor was known for his imposing figure as well as his sophisticated air, and the above photo serves as a nice example of his overall style: strongman in a suit.\n\nBut not just any suit. Brynner had to wear a suit that was as striking and dynamic as he was, which is why this suit is adorned not only with jetted hacking pockets (a rare detail in and of itself) and wide lapels, but also dramatic roped shoulders. The exact origins of the roped shoulder — so named because it looks like the sleeve fabric could have been laid over a piece of rope at the shoulder seam — are up for debate. But what is certain is that the style was embraced by some of Italy's finest tailoring houses to complement the more casual, soft-shouldered style popular in the region, and add a period, so to speak, to that overall look.\n\nSee how the sleevehead that sits just a bit higher than the actual shoulder on Brynner's suit in the photo above, making him appear even broader? That's the roping. It's a detail that's big and bold, but also refined and classic — much like the man wearing the suit himself.\n\nGet the Look: Slim fit Donnegal tweed blazer ($995) by Richard James, mrporter.com\n\nJake Gallagher is a writer living in Manhattan.
