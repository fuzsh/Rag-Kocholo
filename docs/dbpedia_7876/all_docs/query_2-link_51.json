        "text": "U.S. law enshrines the protections of the international Refugee Convention, drafted in the wake of the horrors of World War II. The law provides that any person “physically present in the United States or who arrives in the United States … irrespective of such [person’s] status, may apply for asylum...” This means that all people seeking asylum, regardless of their race, national origin, or method of entry, have the legal right to seek asylum in the United States.\n\nDespite this codified right, asylum seekers have faced rapid deportations and push-backs instead of protection for decades—starting with Haitian asylum seekers, and continuing for countless Black, Brown, and Indigenous people in need of safety. People seeking asylum in the United States are fleeing persecution, torture, and sometimes death. But upon their arrival, they face a new odyssey of navigating complex U.S. immigration laws and an increasingly restrictive environment that bars asylum seekers from winning protection. Restrictions include family separation, prosecution under racist laws, rapid processing for deportation, and a sprawling detention and surveillance system.\n\nViolation of asylum protection is no partisan matter, as Republican and Democratic administrations alike have taken turns in curtailing access to protection. NIJC documented a timeline of anti-asylum policies unleashed under the Trump administration. Prior to taking office, President Biden vowed to protect the right to asylum and bring the U.S. into long-awaited compliance with domestic and international obligations. However, the Biden administration has continued recycling restrictive policies first implemented by the prior administration, including asylum bans, summary expulsions, and lightning-fast fear screenings for people who are detained in Border Patrol custody after entering the United States to seek protection.\n\nThe United States has the resources and capacity to protect people fleeing persecution. In the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there was an outpouring of support and political will to welcome Ukrainians forced to flee their homes. The Biden administration adopted a temporary parole program, showing the United States’ capacity to center the dignity and humanity of people in need of protection. But even parole programs cannot replace a functioning asylum system."
