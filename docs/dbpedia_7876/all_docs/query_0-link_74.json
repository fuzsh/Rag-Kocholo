        "text": "On January 30, 2016, Brooke Jaron,\n\n*\n\n*\n\ngave a Rug and Textile Appreciation Morning program on:\n\n*\n\n*\n\nBrooke is a textile historian and artist who will help us interpret the symbolic language of Chinese textiles. Brooke will discuss examples ranging from home-crafted children’s hats and clothing to purses and fan cases by the imperial workshops of Qing dynasty China.\n\nBrooke is also a collector of Asian textiles and antiques. She has lectured and written numerous articles on the subject of symbolism in Chinese textiles. Her latest article on the “year of the Monkey” appears in the January issue of “Textiles Asia Journal.” Recently, she participated in the Textile Museum’s first-ever Pecha Kucha presentation during its annual Symposium, with a talk on the symbols of the Chinese zodiac. She also designs jewelry.\n\nThis is Brooke speaking:\n\n*\n\n*\n\nFor the past 30 years I’ve been collecting Chinese textiles. Most of them were purchased during the more than 40 trips that my husband and I took to China between the early 1980s and the present. I noticed early on that there were images that appeared on many different articles and I began to wonder why it was that there were so many bats, or cranes or odd looking old men with huge foreheads. What started out as curiosity, eventually led me to many years of asking questions, studying whatever material was available, and trying to decipher the hidden meanings in the pieces I gathered in my travels.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe Chinese have for centuries believed that by surrounding themselves with lucky objects and images, they would increase the likelihood of a happy, healthy and prosperous life. Over the years, a language of symbols has evolved, images that we can find repeated in the art they created, the buildings they lived in, the household goods that they used every day, and most particularly in the clothing and ornaments that they wore and carried.\n\nThe Chinese spoken language, Mandarin, is made up of many one or two syllable words with a similar or identical sound, although the written characters are not the same. Many of the symbols are based on these homonyms and when several are combined, they form a rebus. This is an example of a rebus in English.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe eye and the ewe are different words that sound the same as I and you, and the heart is an easily recognized substitute for the word “love”.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nDuring the Qing Dynasty, which stretched from the 17th to the early 20th century, these rebus-based symbols appeared in all areas of daily life. There were also other symbols that were based on folk tales, associations with mythical characters, and the practice of assigning symbolic meaning to various objects, fruits, flowers and animals. These symbols would have been recognized and understood by almost all of the population, and their application was especially appropriate in a society where many people did not read or write.\n\nThe image of five bats is an example of a symbol based on a homonym. The word for bat is bian fu, or fu for short; the word for luck, good fortune or blessing is fu, so identical in pronunciation.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe image of five bats is an example of a symbol based on a homonym. The word for bat is bian fu, or fu for short; the word for luck, good fortune or blessing is fu, so identical in pronunciation.\n\nFive bats represent 5 blessings; the original five: longevity, health, wealth, a virtuous life and a natural death were first mentioned in an ancient text from the Warring States period, approximately 450 BCE.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nLater, the five blessings became less specific, meaning “may every blessing come to you.” Among the possible choices for the five blessings, we’ll look at those most commonly depicted on textiles: good fortune, longevity, prosperity, happiness in marriage and many children.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nMost of the representations of the five blessings/ five bats motif have the Chinese character Shou in the center.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nShou is a decorative variation on the character for longevity. Of the five blessings, long life represents the greatest wish of the Chinese people, so it is not surprising to see a doubled wish for long life in this popular design.*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nA single bat is a symbol of general good fortune and luck.\n\nThe bat is often pictured in a descending pose with head down. The Chinese word for upside down, dao, has the same sound as the word meaning “has arrived,” so an upside down bat means Fu Daole “good fortune has arrived.”\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTwo bats facing each other represent “double luck” Shuang Fu, and may be found on clothing and objects created for weddings.\n\nA bat descending over an ancient coin means good luck before your eyes because the word for the square opening in the old coins sounds the same as the word for eye and the word for “coin” or “money” sounds like “in front of”. So Fu Zai Yan Qian illustrates a popular four character saying meaning “good luck before your eyes”.\n\nThis child’s hat has two bats descending over the ancient coins, as well as many other auspicious symbols for longevity and fertility.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nOn the back of another child’s hat, we see a silver ornament with the same image and meaning “good luck before your eyes”.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAlthough the bat is the most common symbol for good fortune, there are other emblems that would have also been recognized as wishes for good luck.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe dragon, unlike the dragons in western cultures, has always been considered an extremely lucky image in China. The mythical dragon was a creature that inhabited the skies and was believed to be responsible for the bringing of rain, and the resulting good harvest.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThis embroidered panel shows a successful scholar posed in front of a very friendly looking dragon. The four characters in the corner are Fu Gui Ru Long, which mean “Wealth and Honor like the Dragon.”\n\nThe tiger was also considered a lucky animal and a great protector against all types of evil forces.*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nFor that reason, we see many tiger depictions on clothing and hats made for children. *\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe character Wang on the tiger’s forehead means “king,” because in China the tiger was considered the king of beasts.*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe word for “vase” Ping An sounds like the words for safety and peace, so the vase with various things inside of it was popular design motif; here it’s seen on a silk pillow end\n\n*\n\n*\n\nand also shown on a small purse*and a card case both of which would have hung from a man’s belt.\n\nThe top of the ruyi scepter is a symbol meaning “as you wish” so it can appear with other auspicious objects or stand alone to mean “whatever your desire may be, let it be as you wish.” * This child’s hat has a ruyi shape on the back .\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe actual scepter was made of carved wood, various stones, ivory or in this case, gold. It was often given by the emperor to high ranking officials as an acknowledgement of their service.\n\nThe Buddha’s hand citron is a fruit that looks like the hand of Buddha\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe Buddha’s hand citron is a fruit that looks like the hand of Buddha.\n\nThe name in Mandarin is fo shou which is a literal translation of Buddha Hand. It’s similar in sound to Fu, meaning luck and Shou meaning longevity, so because of this, it is a symbol of luck and long life. The foshou is often shown with the peach and the pomegranate .\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe three fruits represent the Three Plenties: Good Luck, Long Life and Many Children.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe desire for a long life ranks high among the five blessings and there are many symbols representing the wish for longevity. As we saw in our examination of the five bats/five blessings images, Shou, the stylized Chinese character for longevity, is often placed in the center of the circle of bats.\n\nShou is also a popular emblem by itself and can be found on many varieties of textiles.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nHere we see a set of belt hangings created in a professional workshop, possibly even made for members of the court. The set includes a pair of scent pouches, a card case, a watchcase and a box for holding a carved stone archer’s thumb ring.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAn eyeglass case was probably once part of an equally elegant and elaborate set.\n\nSometimes instead of using the character shou in a design, the wish for longevity is conveyed by the mythical figure Shou Lao,The God of Longevity. *\n\nHe can be recognized by his large forehead, and white beard. He is usually holding a peach and a tall staff, and accompanied by other symbols of longevity such as the pine tree or deer.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe pine tree and the crane are both popular longevity symbols and they are often shown together.* Ancient pine trees can be found in many parts of China where they are cared for and honored.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe crane with its white feathers was reputed to live for many years.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe pine and crane together form a popular birthday greeting meaning “May you live as long as the pine and the crane”. This motif is also used on wedding gifts as they can also be symbolic of the bride and groom.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe deer is another common longevity symbol; it is the only animal capable of finding the Lingzhi fungus, which is known as the fungus of immortality. The deer and a stylized version of the fungus are frequently shown together.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nIn this embroidered panel we can find three of the most common longevity symbols: the deer, the pine and the crane.\n\nThe peach, which we have already seen as one of the fruits in the Three Plenties, is a longevity emblem that appears alone and also in many combinations. It is found in virtually all areas of Chinese art decorative, including porcelain, wood and ivory carvings, silver ornaments and all types of clothing and accessories.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nIn an ancient legend, the Queen Mother of the West had a heavenly orchard with peaches that ripened only every 1000 years. Eating one of these peaches would insure immortality.\n\nThe image of the monkey with the peach is based on an occurrence in the fantasy adventure novel “Journey to the West” in which one of the characters, the monkey king, stole magical peaches of immortality from the Queen Mother of the West. The novel, which was written in the 16th century, was considered one of the four great classical novels of China and was also widely performed by story tellers, shadow puppet troops and regional opera companies all over China. Because of the popularity of the story, Sun Wu Kong, the Monkey King, was an easily recognized character and a symbol of immortality.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThis is a painted, appliqued and embroidered monkey on the back of a child’s hat. We can identify him as Sun Wu Kong, by the fact that he is wearing a vest and also because of the two very large enormous peaches he is sitting between.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe eight immortals are well known figures of a more serious nature. These seven males and one female figure represent the Daoist ideal of immortality. They appeared in the 13th century as paintings on the ceilings of tombs, but in the Yuan Dynasty, their popularity spread and they have remained, as an easily recognizable group until the present time.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe two sides of this hanging pouch have embroidered depictions of all eight of the immortals.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nSometimes only the attributes of the immortals are shown, but they would also have been familiar to most people in the Qing Dynasty.\n\nThe butterfly is a motif associated with summer and romance. It also has symbolic meaning based on the sound of the word in Mandarin, which is hu die. The second syllable of the name, die sounds the same as the word for septuagenarian.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nIt also sounds like the word for continuous, so as a symbol, the butterfly means “may you continue to enjoy longevity into your 70s.”\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe shrimp is another symbol for long life based on a homonym. Shrimp in Chinese is xia and the word for advanced age is xia, so almost the same, except with a different tone. While the butterfly was a popular motif on gifts for older women, the shrimp was its counterpart for men’s gifts.\n\nIn addition to longevity, prosperity was also one of the primary desires of people in the Qing Dynasty. Consequently there are many symbols for Lu, the Chinese word for prosperity.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAlthough written differently, the word Lu is also the name for deer, so in addition to being a symbol of longevity, the deer is a symbol of wealth and success.\n\nLu literally translates as “official’s salary” because in the Ming and Qing dynasties, becoming an official was one of the only ways for a young man to gain status and wealth. Beginning in the Song Dynasty, a system of national examinations was put in place. A young man from any station in life was eligible, and anyone who could do well on this examination would be awarded a position in the government. Those with the highest scores would even have a place in the government of the Imperial court. There are numerous symbols connected with passing the examinations and bringing honor, prestige and wealth to one’s family and village.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe horse became an emblem for success in the examinations because the winning candidate would often return to his hometown on a white horse.\n\nThere are many depictions on textiles showing a young man, mounted on a horse or resting beside his horse, and often wearing the mandarin’s hat that would identify him as an official.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nOn this purse flap we see five little boys playing together with a military helmet. The helmet kui is a homonym for the word meaning eminent or great, a word that was used to describe the one who placed first in the Imperial Examination.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe five boys refer to the five sons of a scholar who lived in the 10th century and raised five sons who all had the highest marks on the examination.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThis red silk dudou shows a scholar wearing his official’s hat and standing on the head of a mythical dragon-fish, known as an Ao. This was another symbol to describe gaining first place in the final civil service examination. The candidate who captured first place in the exam was known as the one who stood on the head of the ao. A four character saying du zhan ao tou meaning “seizing Alone the head of the Ao” was used to describe this accomplishment.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nI’ve mentioned several four character sayings, known in Chinese as cheng yu. These are similar to our proverbs and many of the symbols represent these well known sayings. Li Yu Tiao Longmen is another cheng yu which means Carp Jumps Over the Dragon Gate.\n\nIn an ancient Chinese myth, a carp that could swim upstream in the Yellow River and jump over the rapids at the dragon gate would instantly be transformed into a dragon. This was a well known metaphor for a scholar passing the Imperial examinations.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe rooster was also several associated with success and prosperity.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe word for rooster in Mandarin is gongji. The first syllable gong sounds like an official rank, “duke’, while the second syllable ji sounds the same as the word for “good luck”.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe crab is yet another symbol for passing the national examination with high marks.\n\nThe word for the crab’s shell jia is the same as the word meaning first place. One crab, yi jia ,means finishing in the group of fist place candidates and two crabs is er jia would be the second group.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe peony is the most popular botanical motif in China. One of the names for this flower is fuguihua, which literally means “wealth and honor flower.” It has been a symbol of success since the Tang Dynasty in the 7th century. It is often combined with other auspicious symbols to form a more complicated and comprehensive\n\nmessage.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe cricket or katydid is a symbol of prosperity and success.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nIt is usually depicted with a cabbage, baicai or lettuce shengcai, both prosperity symbols because cai the second syllable of each vegetable name sounds similar to the word cai which means wealth.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe gold fish is a popular motif in Chinese art. Keeping live fish, either inside the house or outside in ponds is a common practice.\n\nThe name in Mandarin, jinyu is an exact translation: Jin meaning gold and yu meaning fish. A reference to gold creates an obvious emblem of wealth. Yu the word for fish sounds like a word meaning abundance, and yu, with a different tone is the word for jade. So, the goldfish as a symbol is either abundant gold or gold and jade.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nWe’ve seen symbols of high position, wealth, gold and jade in our examination of prosperity symbols, but we cannot forget to mention the humble pig as an emblem of wealth and comfort. During the Qing Dynasty, China was primarily an agricultural society and having a pig in the yard (or in the house) was a guarantee of food for the winter and throughout the year. In ancient Chinese script, the character for home was a pictogram showing a pig under a roof, so it has always had the connation of comfort and abundance.\n\nSo, we’ve covered the first three of the five blessings. These are Luck, Prosperity and Longevity, Fu Lu Shou. They are often represented together as the three star gods, Fu Xing, Lu Xing and Shou Xing.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nNext time you’re n a Chinese restaurant take a close look, especially at the entrance. If you see three statues of imposing Chinese figures you can be pretty sure they’re the three star gods, Fu Lu and Shou.\n\nBeyond the big three, there are several other groups of popular auspicious motifs to be found in Chinese textiles.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe Chinese word Xi represents happiness and most particularly happy marriage. Arranged marriages were the norm in Qing Dynasty China. Marriage was sometimes a way to bind powerful families together for political reasons, or to raise the status of the family by having the daughter marry an official, or is some cases, sadly, just a means of relieving a family of the burden of supporting a daughter. Once a girl left her home to marry, she became a member of her husband’s family and on some cases did not return to the home of her parents. Only a son stayed close to his parents, usually living with his wife and children in the same house.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nYou have probably seen the double happiness characters, Shuang Xi on everything from porcelain to paper cuts. Red cutouts of the double happiness were used to decorate everything connected with weddings.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nA pair of magpies has the same meaning as the Shuang Xi double happiness characters. The name of the bird in mandarin is xi que so literally, the bird of happiness.\n\nIf a magpie is shown on a branch of a plum tree, the message is happiness before your brow, because the word for plum, mei sounds like the word for brow.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThis small hanging may have decorated a wedding bed, or have been suspended from the buttons on a bride’s clothing.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nMandarin ducks are known to mate for life so they are a good example of fidelity and happiness. If the ducks are shown with the lotus, which is a symbol of many children, then the symbolic meaning is a happy marriage blessed with many children. If a magpie is shown on a branch of a plum tree, the message is happiness before your brow, because the word for plum, mei sounds like the word for brow.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe dragon and the phoenix are two mythical animals, both representing good luck. The dragon represents the Yang principal in Chinese cosmology and the phoenix represents Yin. Together they form a balance between Yin and Yang and they also represent the emperor and empress. They were a very common motif for wedding attire in the Qing Dynasty, usually embroidered on a background of red or rose silk, the colors of celebration.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe word for fish yu sounds the same as the word for abundant. A rebus is formed when two carp are shown hanging below a stone chime. The word for an ancient chime, qing, sounds like the word for joy and happiness, so the two fish with the chime would be recognized as “May you have Abundant Happiness and Joy”. * A pair of carp also symbolized love and harmony because they often swim in pairs. The four characters, Fu Gui You Yu, mean “Wealth and Honor in Abundance.”\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe last group of symbols that we’ll look at today are those that express the wish for many children, especially many sons. In Qing Dynasty China it was important to have sons for several reasons. China was mainly an agricultural nation and sons were needed to do the work necessary to maintain a farm. Secondly, in order to advance in society, only a son could hope to study and receive high marks on the Imperial Examinations. The most important reason was that a son would stay with the family after marriage, perpetuate the family name and perform the necessary rites to worship the ancestors.\n\nFruits, especially those with many seeds, provide a large number of symbols for many children.\n\nThe word for seed zi sounds like the word for child, or son, so any fruit with seeds is a symbol of fertility.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe melon, a popular fruit image, is depicted on this little girl’s band hat, and also on the spectacle case. The vine which surrounds the melon is an additional symbol meaning continuous, so the message we can read here is “continuous birth of children (or sons).”\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nGrapes are also a symbol of fertility. In the Qing dynasty, the seedless grape had not yet been developed. Often shown with a rat or squirrel, the grapes and rat are a symbol for many children.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe pomegranate, which is a fruit made up almost entirely of seeds, was perhaps the most popular child related symbol, at least among the fruits.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAs we saw earlier, it is frequently combined with the peach and the Buddha’s Hand citron to form the motif known as the Three Abundances: a hope for many children, many years of life and many blessings.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThis is another set of belt hanging purses. These elegant sets were made in workshops where accomplished embroiderers were employed. All of the work was, of course, done by hand, but there may have been one person doing the embroidery, one stitching up the purses, another adding the trims, fringe and hanging ribbons.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAlthough not a fruit, the lotus has many small seeds, so it is also a symbol for many children. It has additional meaning because the name of the lotus, lian is a homonym for “continuous”. The lotus seeds, called lianzi sound the same as words meaning continuous sons. A child with a lotus has been a popular auspicious motif since the Song Dynasty, the 10th through the 13th century.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThis elaborate and amazing child’s hat has a giant lotus blossom on its crown.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nPerhaps the easiest design motif to interpret, is the depiction of groups of children that symbolize the wish for many sons. A popular theme is 100 Boys, which you may have seen in paintings or on porcelain vases. The number didn’t have to actually be 100 to express the same wish.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe Qilin is a mythical animal which has the body of a deer, the forehead of a wolf, the tail of an ox and the hooves of a horse. It also has either one or two horns and blue or green scales covering its body. It’s a popular subject for sculpture, paintings, silver ornaments and clothing. If you’ve ever visited the Summer Palace in Beijing, you may remember the large statue of a Qilin at the entrance to the park. The qilin is a powerful emblem of good luck, said to appear only when a benevolent and virtuous ruler is in power. In myths and legends, it was the bringer of sons, and not just ordinary sons, but illustrious sons who would bring honor to the family.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nWe’ve now seen examples of the five blessings in many different kinds of textiles. Symbols for good fortune, longevity, prosperity, happy marriage and many children have all been represented. I’d like to close with one of my favorite pieces* a rather humble embroidered pillow cover section, undoubtedly made at home, possibly as part of a bride’s dowry. Although it’s certainly not the most elegant or valuable piece in the collection, I think it has great humor and charm. It reminds me of the British author Roald Dahl’s children’s book “James and the Giant Peach.” It also makes a suitable ending to our exploration because it shows symbols representing all five blessings in one picture. We see a bat which represents good fortune, the giant peach stands for long life, a child expresses a wish for a successful son, the stone chime symbolizes happiness and joy and a pair of fish represent the traditional new year’s wish nian nian you yu “May you have abundance year after year.”\n\nOn February 8th we’ll enter a new year in the Chinese calendar, the year of the monkey. It’s only a little over a week away, so I’d like to be the first to wish you a very happy new year. The Chinese have several greetings for New Year. One is Gong Xi Fa Cai which means “Have a Joyous and Prosperous New Year.” The other is Xin Nian Kuai Le which is just a simple “Happy New Year”.\n\nBrooke took questions and brought her session to a close.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThanks again to her for working with me, after a long hiatus, to let you enjoy this excellent program.\n\n‘Til next time,\n\nR. John Howe\n\nOn February 8, 2020, Gordon Webb Priest, Jr.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n(the above photo is from an earlier RTAM in the former Textile Museum building)\n\ngave an RTAM here at the Textile Museum in Washington, DC.\n\nLori Kartchner, the TM Curator of Education, introduced him, saying that\n\n(click on the image below to get a larger version)\n\n*\n\n*\n\nGordon would be showing us pile rugs, wagireh, khorjin, and yastiks from the late 19th century tribal, village, and nomadic production of Persia, Kurdistan, the Caucasus, and Anatolia, from his collection, and would tell us why each is on his first team.\n\nShe said further that Gordon is a semi-retired Baltimore corporate lawyer and long-time textile collector, now living in Delray Beach, Florida. He has served as President of The Washington Textile Group, and has frequently presented Rug Mornings at The Textile Museum.\n\nShe added that his other interests include doubles squash, wine-collecting, thoroughbred racing, and international travel.\n\nThis is John Howe, intervening after the fact. Gordon has done something unusual in his descriptions of the pieces he brought to this session. He talks about how these pieces came into his collection: something not often shared in these sessions.\n\nGordon began with this piece:\n\n1\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 1 is a complete Qashqa’i (southwest Persia) saddle bag (khorjin) set, acquired at an Alex. Cooper & Sons auction in Baltimore. It is in near mint condition, and I fancy its asymmetry.\n\nFull sets like this are relatively scarce, because at the time these pieces were coming into the western world 100 years ago, they had little commercial or even folk-art value, and were just thrown in with shipments of room-size rugs as sweeteners for the importer. Since freight cost is determined by weight, and the largely unadorned flat-woven backs had little aesthetic interest, they were frequently cut off and discarded, and the 2 pile-woven fronts were shipped off, almost always becoming separated from each other over the decades.\n\nHere is a visual aid I constructed to demonstrate that these are produced on one continuous set of warps:\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe piece is woven from the bottom up. So the bottom red portion is woven first in pile (notice that the design on this section is woven upside down).\n\nThen the lower blue piece which will become one of the backs is woven (usually in flat weave).\n\nNext, the yellow bridge section is woven, including part of the closure system.\n\nThen, the other blue back is produced.\n\nLast, the top pile face is woven, this time with the design right side up.\n\nThe complete bag is assembled by taking the bottom red panel back and up behind the blue back and sewing it up on the sides.\n\nSimilarly, the red top portion is folded back and down behind the upper blue panel and the sides are sewn up.\n\nThe saddle bag will now be complete with the front of the pile sections facing to the back.\n\nIt looks like this:\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe whole assembly is turned around to show the pile front panels of the two pockets and their designs, and we have returned to our first image of this complete saddle bag set from the front:\n\n*\n\n*\n\nBelow is one lower quarter of the upper bag showing the slits in its closure system:\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThen there is a full look at the entire width of the closure system:\n\n*\n\n*\n\nLast, there is a detail of the field of the pile face without its borders; a riotous melange of floral motifs:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n2\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 2 is a Qashqa’i sofreh (bread cloth).\n\nDespite the more limited English translation, these are flat-woven textiles in various sizes for a number of different uses concerning food-production and serving. This example is, in fact, one used to cover and serve bread.\n\nThe embroidered end finishes here are a dynamic contrast to the open field and simple deep indigo border. Procured from an Oregon participant at the legendary annual Buena Vista Motel Oriental Rug Dealer’s Fair in San Francisco’s Marina District.\n\nDetail of 2:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n3\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 3 is a Qashqa’i wagireh (sampler), one of my 5 favorites of any type in my collection; acquired, perhaps 30 years ago, from John Murray, a collectible rug dealer who worked the mid-Atlantic antique-show circuit, and a very nice guy.\n\nIt has 5 different border samples (including the wonderful forest green section on the right center), 3 separate field panels, and a classic 4-armed medallion that serves as the trademark of this tribe.\n\nMurray Eiland and his son have identified in their books 4 types of wagireh:\n\n(1) The most prominent type (of which this piece is an example) presents all design elements necessary for at least one complete rug;\n\n(2) One that has a few of the possible design elements, but is primarily dedicated to reflecting the colors and textures that could be employed in a full rug to be ordered;\n\n(3) A piece that features no designs, but consists of numbered color blocks; and\n\n(4) A precise replica of a full rug (exact designs and colors in the same juxtaposition), but in a considerably smaller scale (which they refer to as a “strike-off”).\n\nDetails of 3:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n4\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 4 is a Bakhtyari (southwest Persia) khorjin face. Good color and attractive asymmetry. Another nicely framing white-ground border. A very good green.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nI was most captivated by the over-lapping waves, or flying bats, in the field; the established term in the rug literature for this element is “split-leaf”.\n\nI’d been keen to acquire one of these, and, coincidentally, about a decade ago, John Murray was liquidating some of his more-treasured inventory to finance a reunion trip to Vietnam to celebrate with the survivors of his Marine Corp company. I was happy to come away with this specimen while supporting his effort.\n\nAnother detail of 4:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n5\n\n(click on the image below to get a larger version)\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 5 is a Bakhtyari wagireh.\n\nTypically, as with this piece, Bakhtyari pile weavings are single-wefted. Possibly the rug world’s most diminutive example of the genre, and in addition, it’s limited to 3 border designs.\n\nOut of the inventory of an Ankara dealer via Rug Rabbit.\n\n*\n\n6\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 6, another khorjin face, is abit of a puzzler; perhaps a Khamseh (southwest Persia), but plenty of room for other opinions.\n\nThe whirly-gigs appear to hover above the darkened sky of the field, and are reproduced in the closure panels. It has significant warp-depression, and thus a fairly stiff handle.\n\nPicked up in a private transaction with Cooper.\n\n6a is a close-up of the whirly-gigs, or pin-wheels:\n\n6a\n\n*\n\n*\n\n6b shows the complementary application in the small spaces between the loop slits at the top:\n\n6b\n\n*\n\n*\n\n6c, below, shows, in close-up, the 4 borders that surround the field.\n\nA white-ground, striped, and instrumented main border is flanked on both its sides by red-blue “checkerboard” minor borders.\n\nOutside that array is a narrow border in which 2-1-2 (“quicunx”) elements alternate with solid-colored squares, each with a contrasting center dot:\n\n6c\n\n*\n\n*\n\n7\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 7 is my most recent acquisition, having been bestowed upon me by the creator and devoted steward of this long-running virtual series, John Howe himself, as a gift of gratitude for our having driven up here from Delray Beach, our Volvo loaded to the rafters with the core of our collection, to make this presentation.\n\nHe’s seen (and photographed) enough of our stock to recognize that it would hit most of my hot-spots — as it does: A tiny jewel with primitive power.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAnd here’s the back, with the same quantity of design, but with sufficient variation from the front to provide an interesting contrast.\n\nBecause it is made of one continuous piece sewn up the sides, there has always been a suspicion that it is a “constructed” piece cut down from something larger. However, its assembly has suggested to most knowledgeable examiners that such is not the case, and that it appears in the mode in which it was originally made.\n\nIt has vibrant natural colors, is woven in very coarse sumak, and its drawing has an undisciplined character that is indicative of Luri (southwest Persia).\n\nHarold Keshishian observed, upon looking closely at it, that he had seen a piece, in quite a similar coarse sumak stitch, which was known to have been from the Chahar Mahal sub-region:\n\n*\n\nTextile 8 is an Afshar (south central Persia) “main carpet”, fairly large, as the name implies, for a “tribal” (as opposed to urban workshop) weaving.\n\nThis is obviously the product of a very experienced and talented weaver, as evidenced by the highly-effective juxtaposition of colors, the uniformity of proportion in the elements, and the corner resolutions.\n\nHow do we know it’s an Afshar? As Harold used to say: “Look at the hubcaps; they scream “Afshar!”.\n\nHe meant the creamy warps, the orange wefts, the midnight blue field, the white-ground main border, the ample use of orange (in this case, in the lattice framing the botehs), the alternating cornflower blue, white, aubergine, and scarlet in the botehs themselves, and the barber-pole selvages.\n\nI’d acquired a significant amount of my collection over the years at Alex. Cooper Sons auction house in Baltimore, and one day about 15 years ago, Jon Levinson, who ran the rug operations, called me up out of the blue and said that their companion retail sales department had just taken on some stuff out of the trunk of an itinerant picker who came by a few times a year, and he wanted me to have the first crack at something he thought would interest me. This was it. He demanded a very fair price, and I closed the deal without a whimper.\n\nFurther detailed images:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n9\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 9 is another textbook Afshar, in this case a khorjin face.\n\nThe 4 latch-hooked diamonds and the whirly-gigs surrounding them seem to float above the midnight blue field that surrounds the central medallion.\n\nLike most Afshars, it has a pleasantly floppy handle (the main carpet, no. 8, has an unusually stiff feel).\n\nThe white-ground main border with the meandering vine dramatically frames the piece. The most distinctly artistic feature, however, is the intricate embroidery in the closure panels, as well as the horizontal multi-color barber poles above and below.\n\nThis was the first of a few pieces I acquired over the years from Peter Papp, who always had very high quality, but priced accordingly. I felt very pleased to get this one at a modest number, figuring it was a get-acquainted deal.\n\nSome detail shots:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n10\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 10 is another khorjin face, with the same size, handle, horizontal orientation, and color combinations as No. 9, placing it firmly within the Afshar lexicon.\n\nThis time, however, the field features an entire barnyard of ornamental fowl, what are referred to as “morge” (presumably in Farsi) when they appear, as they frequently do, in Khamseh rugs and bags.\n\nThis came from a Pacific Northwest dealer at the San Francisco ACOR. I got to the dealers’ fair early, and, in a rare happenstance, the guy had both face halves of the khorjin set, and I had my pick.\n\nAija Blitte, a fellow Hajji Baba Society member, turned up about 20 minutes later and snagged the other half. I was hoping she would attend today, so we could have a side-by-side comparison and note the subtle differences, as we did at an earlier TM Rug Morning.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n11\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 11 is an Afshar chanteh (vanity bag) face.\n\nAs contrasted with khorjin, these bags are more diminutive, and only have a single pile face with a single flat-woven back, normally with some sort of cord-like woven handle, long enough to drape over a shoulder, as with a woman’s purse.\n\nI fancy the asymmetrical treatment of its field design, as well as its Art Deco look. Its white-ground border also frames it effectively. It came from an Istanbul dealer through Rug Rabbit.\n\nDetails of 11:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n12\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 12 is a smaller Afshar chanteh face. This one lacks a border, other than the truncated polygons at the bottom. The dominant kinetic flower form in the field, however, is nearly identical, in this case offset in the northwest corner.\n\nA follow-up sale by the same source as 11.\n\nDetails of 12:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n13\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 13 is a large Kazak (southwest Caucasus) “long rug” (the length roughly twice the width) with the bold coloration typical of rugs from this region.\n\nThis was a fairly recent acquisition from a Cooper auction.\n\nThe multi-toned mother-and-child latch-hooked diamonds in the field give it a lot of energy, and the 2 white-ground minor borders create a pleasing framework.\n\nDetails of 13:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n14\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 14 is another Kazak scored from a Cooper auction recently.\n\nA bit smaller than 13, but with the same vivid tonality and the same duplicative minor white-ground borders (this time with a meandering vine, rather than stars).\n\nI’m a sucker for a diagonal format, particularly here, where the ribbons are over-sized.\n\nThe sense of the borders marking off a random sample snapshot of an infinitely repeating design is a ubiquitous device in the Oriental rug vernacular, and here there is an interesting twist manifested in the bottom of the field, where it’s revealed, by the 90-degree angle, that we’re actually looking at what may be a tilted rectangle.\n\nDetails of 14:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n15\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 15 is a Genje (southwest Caucasus) long rug. Its field features multi-colored renditions of the pear-shaped device, known as “boteh” and ubiquitous throughout the Oriental rug cosmos, particularly so in this Caucasian genre.\n\nI love the bold simplicity of the main border, the white figures on which are highly-abstracted dragons. The yellow inner border is a very attractive contrasting touch.\n\nCheck the many little floaters in the blue field: The oft-observed horror vacuui, but in this case, they don’t distract from the purity of the format.\n\nFrom a Cooper auction about a decade ago.\n\nDetails of 15:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n16\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 16 is a Shirvan (northeast Caucasus), with the characteristic white one-cord edge finish, a floppy handle, almost no warp depression, as evidenced by the flat back, and more squarish dimensions than encountered in the southwest.\n\nOther than the stepped-polygon main border, it is a study in carnations.\n\nThis was my only epic “steal” in decades of collecting. It had come into the large shop of a Baltimore dealer in UK and French furniture, along with a few chests and tables from the same source in West Sussex.\n\nIt was so filthy that one could barely discern the colors and, of course, the proprietor hadn’t a clue what it was. She was content to take a few hundred to get it out from underfoot.\n\nI ran it through the bathtub a few times with Orvus Paste zero-PH textile detergent, and those big white blossoms just exploded off the field.\n\nDetails of 16:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n17\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 17 is a Kuba (northeast Caucasus), with the usual 3-cord selvages, usually in blue or, as here, in red, and a stiffer handle due to more warp depression.\n\nThe dominant elements, and what drew me to this piece, were the powerful “shield” devices (actually, impressionistic pomegranates) arising from the seldom-seen jet-black field, with the white-ground quartered-diamond main border lending a crisp contrast.\n\nAnother Cooper auction.\n\nDetails of 17:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n(top border)\n\n*\n\n*\n\n(side border)\n\n*\n\n*\n\n18\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 18 is a Kuba of the Seychour sub-variety, characterized by the meandering carnations in the inner and outer borders, with the latter on a seafoam green base.\n\nThe unusual bit here is the central field and inner border, as a unit, dropped down like a separate 3-dimensional object on top of what would have otherwise been a much larger field consisting of diagonal ribbons of alternating colors.\n\nThe clueless furniture dealer from whom I acquired it at the Hunt Valley Antique Show had it marked as a Talish, probably because a just-enough-knowledge-to-be-dangerous rug dealer buddy told him that’s what it was based on the entirely open field surrounded by medachyl devices, the sine qua non of those southeast Caucasus rugs.\n\nThis is all wrong, because the structural aspects are Kubaesque, and the piece is also much smaller than the nearly invariable “long rug” dimensions of Talish.\n\nDetails of 18:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n19\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 19 is in the top tier of my inventory. This small-scale gem is a Seychour Kuba of the Bijov sub-subset, characterized by the symmetrical array of abstract floral and leaf designs on a royal blue field. It has a very supple handle.\n\nThe macrame end finishes are typical, but it’s rare for them to have largely survived what may have been 150 years of multiple ownership.\n\nThe simplicity of a single white-ground border creates an impact. The weaver started out with a more elaborate border formulation, but then abandoned it as she moved northward in favor of a straightforward chain of “S” shapes (but in “Z” orientation on the right side), and then in favor of an interlocking “running dog” motif in the top border.\n\nThere is also an interesting amount of abrash in the background of the field. About two-thirds of the way up, she runs out of the royal blue dye lot, and has to substitute a much lighter shade that only carries on for about 3 vertical inches of pile, before that runs out, and there follows several different sections of only a few inches each, culminating in the nearly white stripe all the way at the top.\n\nOf course, it’s frequently the case that these contrasts are accentuated as the colors mellow with age.\n\nI’ve had this one for several decades, acquiring it from Peter Papp. I’d seen it in his inventory twice before, but had not been prepared to pull the trigger on those occasions.\n\nThe third time was at a Baltimore antique show at which he annually exhibited and I figured it was going to get away from me if I didn’t make a move. I avoided paying it any attention, and walked the dog for about 20 minutes asking about other stuff in which I was only mildly interested.\n\nFinally, I gave him an “oh, by the way”, and gestured toward this lot as if I’d never seen it before. Peter was born at night, but not last night. He wouldn’t budge on the price, and I didn’t blame him, as it was a superb piece in and of itself, and my lust for it was way too much for my Oscar-losing performance as “Mr. Casual” to contain!\n\nI was content to consider this as my comeuppance for the good deal he gave me on the Afshar khorjin face (no. 9) a few years before.\n\nDetails of 19:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n20\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 20 is something relatively unusual, a khorjin face from the Caucasus (where most of the pile weavings are rugs). In this case, Karabagh, the historically-embattled, Armenian enclave detached from the main body of that nation and entirely surrounded by predominantly-Islamic Azerbaijan.\n\nThe 2 white guard borders successfully set off the scarlet-ground main border. But the real genius lies in the vivid colors employed in the single Herati motif which constitutes the bag’s focal point on a midnight blue field, the most dramatic of which is the purplish red in the central medallion of the Herati.\n\nMany thousands of tiny beetles called cochineal (and only the females of the species) sacrificed their souls to produce this magical dye-stuff.\n\nA Seattle dealer had this in his booth at the Denver ACOR. Understandably, it got a lot of attention, but he declared it was not on offer.\n\nHe must have been gradually worn down, because on the last day, I pressed him as to whether there wasn’t some price at which he couldn’t afford to hold on to it any longer.\n\nAfter some hemming and hawing, he gave me a number and I coughed it up (wondering to myself how long I was going to have to hide this in the attic to obviate a marital crisis).\n\nAll these years later, I have no regrets, and have had a lot of offers.\n\nDetails of 20:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n21\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 21 is a Bijar (northwest Persian Kurdistan) wagireh, produced in and around the rug-market-center city of that name.\n\nThese are referred to as the “rugs of iron” due to their extremely stiff handle (they can’t be folded, only rolled up) and consequent durability. This structure is the result of employing at least 3 weft shoots, and pounding them down very tightly with a mallet striking a comb-like device resting on the top weft of the set.\n\nThis large-format sampler features 5 border examples and 4 field specimens, with a multiplicity of floral motifs and a bit of the Bijar trademark arabesques (“strapwork”) in the lower left mustard field. There are at least a dozen colors, even though the predominant tonal theme is earthy.\n\nThe provenance was as compelling as the piece itself. It had been in the William Randolph Hearst collection at San Simeon. As was my custom at New York auctions, I dropped a modest absentee bid at the Sotheby’s weekend preview, so as to avoid coming back at mid-week for the sale itself.\n\nI was not optimistic, due to the back-story, so was pleasantly surprised when it succeeded.\n\nDetails of 21:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n22\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 22 is large Kurdish double-medallion khorjin face in a horizontal format. It came from a Connecticut rug dealer who exhibited at the Baltimore Museum of Art Antiques Show about 25 years ago.\n\nAs always, the white-ground inner border provides sharp framing. I have another one in the same format, but with a mustard inner border, and with contrasting medallions (blue on red v. red on blue), and more compartmentalized.\n\nThey are fairly common, and Jim Opie published one nearly identical to it in one of his books. I brought this one instead, because it’s more unusual.\n\nDetails of 22:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n23\n\n(click on the image below to get a larger version)\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 23 is a Saj Bulaq Kurdish mafrash side panel. It also includes about half of what would have been the top (if situated in the tent) or the bottom (if tied to the flank of a pack animal).\n\nThese are 3-dimensional bags that are for transporting and storing bedding. In its complete manifestation, there would have been another side panel more or less identical to this one, and 2 end panels each about half this size but in the same design, and, of course, the flat woven top/bottom.\n\nI acquired it from London/Vienna rug dealer James Cohen at the last Boston ACOR.\n\nI was drawn to the deeply saturated reds, and their contrast with the indigo and yellows; I’m also addicted to aubergine, as featured in the central medallion and some of the border leaves.\n\nThe preponderance of mafrash tend to be entirely plain flat weaves or soumac, so this pile example is more esteemed.\n\nDetails of 23:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n24\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 24 is a Kurdish salt bag, obtained from a Midwestern dealer through Rug Rabbit.\n\nIt’s a garden-variety version of this utilitarian weaving, with a successful use of complementary colors.\n\nDetails of 24:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n25\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 25 is a Kurdish wagireh, bought at a silent auction at the Chicago ACOR, where it had been donated by an upstate New York dealer.\n\nIt’s got thick, lustrous wool, 4 different borders, and an array of field devices, including the striking off-center diamond medallion. The buttery main border and chocolatey field (with some abrash about two-thirds the way up) combine for a very earthy appeal.\n\nDetails of 25:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n26\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 26 is a petite jewel, a Senna wagireh, woven in the Kurdish rug market town of that name, and having the characteristic cotton warps, single wefts, and fairly high knot-count. This gives them a delicate look and feel and the ability to achieve something closer to curvilinear designs, such as the blossoming flowers on the southeast quadrant of this piece.\n\nI got it from a Boston dealer at the Denver ACOR.\n\n27\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 27 superficially presents itself as another wagireh, but it’s far more likely a Kurdish child’s practice piece.\n\nThe 2 diamond and latch-hooked medallions turn out off center, and the stepped polygon on the left gets truncated.\n\nAnd you know she’s working with left-over dye lots, because she runs out of the beige about a third of the way up the top border, and has to swap in the red that had been used in the field.\n\nThe unintended result is something of considerable primitive charm.\n\nI picked it up at the now long-defunct Sloan’s auction house in D. C. It was sitting under a lamp on an end table off in a corner of the preview room, so I doubt many others noticed it, and there was only one other half-hearted bidder.\n\nDetails of 27:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n28\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 28 is a Kurdish khorjin face, purchased at a Cooper auction, featuring a zoom-in on a Mini Khani design.\n\nI was particularly keen on the apricot in the bottom and top blossoms, and the cornflower blue in the center one, all of which popped quite smartly after I gave it a bath.\n\nDetails of 28:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n29\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 29 is the first in a series of Kurdish khorjin faces from the Jaff tribe (predominantly in northeastern Iraqi Kurdistan).\n\nTheir trademark is the multi-colored latch-hooked diamonds, each enclosed by a larger diamond lattice.\n\nIf I had to pick 3 out of the whole collection to go into the coffin with me, this piece would probably get the call (along with 3, Qashqa’i wagireh, and 19, Bijov; and maybe 20 and 43, but I have to leave room for some doubles squash trophies).\n\nIt was also acquired from James Cohen at the most recent Boston ACOR.\n\nIt’s loaded with unusual elements that distinguish it from the typical production of the Jaff canon: The horizontal proportions (most are either square or more vertical); the Carolina blue lattice (I graduated from Chapel Hill, so that grabbed me straight away); the stepped-polygon border in earth tones (most are either floral blossoms or octagons in primary colors); the overall autumnal vibe; and the relaxed irregularity of both the diamonds and the surrounding lattice, which lends it a kinetic quality.\n\nThis was not the work of a master weaver, as evidenced, for example, by the pumpkin latch-hook within the brown diamond on the right side, which gets a bit mangled where it meets the border, but even these flaws contribute to an overall primal power.\n\nDetails of 29:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n30\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 30 is a Jaff khorjin face found in the inventory of a New England dealer via Rug Rabbit.\n\nI like the relatively large and vertically-elongated diamonds, and the unfussy alternating octagon and mini-barber pole border composition.\n\nDetails of 30:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n31\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 31 is the first Jaff khorjin face that I acquired, from a Maine rug dealer at the Baltimore Museum of Art Antique Show.\n\nIt has perhaps the softest and most luxurious wool of any rug I own.\n\nThe proportions of the diamonds and of the piece overall are about average for this type, but note that, when she has to abandon full diamonds as she runs into both the left and right side borders, she eschews the ubiquitous latch-hooks in favor of up to 5 straight-forward half-diamonds within half-diamonds.\n\nAnd then there is the strange vertical line of knots inside the right inner border (but not matched on the left, as if she was more concerned about showing the same portion of disappearing diamonds on the right as appears on the left, even if it meant encroaching on the field with this ham-handed space-filler).\n\nDetails of 31:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n32\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 32, the next Jaff khorjin face, is done entirely in what I think of as Williamsburg pastels, including the powder blue border, which unfortunately would have been more effective in white.\n\nA D. C. rug dealer traded me this for a large Peking rug that he intended to carve up into pillow covers.\n\nIf one looks at a substantial number of these over time, one notices a fair number with a single yellow or gold diamond, at or near the center. Some sort of totemic significance? Who knows?\n\nObserve that the weaver here employed the same diamonds-within-diamonds design, rather than latch-hooks, on the 3 half-elements on the right side, just as was done on 31.\n\nDetails of 32:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n33\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThis Jaff khorjin face, appearing as Textile 33, has the ubiquitous white dots-on-black lattice, but more pronounced here than usual.\n\nThe hexagons in alternating colors, enclosing opposing snakes, elongated on the bottom and top but of uniform proportions on the sides, create a bold surrounding for the field.\n\nDetails of 33:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n34\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 34 is a Melas prayer rug (western Anatolia) and a textbook example of the genre: The bricky red, angular “arrowhead” mihrab, the mustard-ground main border with aubergine floral elements, and the quartered rosettes on the outer minor border.\n\nEven in more exotic incarnations far removed from the prayer theme, the color palate reveals these rugs as Melas from a mile away (I was enamored of a stunner, which I couldn’t afford, in a cane design, that an Oakland dealer had for a few years back in the 90s).\n\nThis came from a Christie’s auction, previewed in New York, but with the sale held at the deceased owner’s Bucks County farm to exploit a Pennsylvania sales tax exemption on dispositions by executors.\n\nIt was primarily of his collection of Americana, including the catalogue cover lot, a pair of mid-19th century hand-painted wooden fire house Dalmations which brought a quarter of a million (back when that was real money).\n\nBut he had accumulated a modest quantity of Oriental rugs, as well, many of admirable quality.\n\nI was delighted to get this on a left bid, but my principal quarry had been a Konya village prayer rug in striking saturated colors and “German” condition. Jim Ffrench told me he hadn’t seen much activity around it, or had many inquires, and opined that an absentee bid modestly above the high estimate might well bring it home.\n\nI did just that, and when we got back from whatever extended weekend trip we were on, I called the Christie’s recording (this was way pre-internet) that would recite the successful bids on all the lots that sold.\n\nWhat I heard was a number about 5 times what I had bid. I was sure it was some sort of clerical cock-up, and called for a warm body the next day to get the real story.\n\nWell, that was the real story. Turns out that Eberhardt Herrmann, a Munich collector who published an annual catalogue of his spectacular world-class acquisitions for about a decade before he ultimately crashed and burned (putting the rug departments of the international auction houses and their consigners on suicide-watch), had taken a shine to the Konya and emerged the winner (as he always did) in a fierce bidding war over it.\n\nDetails of 34:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n35\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 35 is a heybe (the Turkish version of a khorjin) face from Kozak, in the Bergama district of northwestern Anatolia. It came from a down-market country auction in Baltimore County.\n\nThe designs are crudely drawn and poorly aligned, and thus it may be a child’s tutorial piece like 27, but its rustic charm is undeniable.\n\nNote the abrash in the top third.\n\nDetails of 35:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n36\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 36 is the first in a series of 4 faces of yastiks, which are Anatolian cushion covers.\n\nThis one is considerably more impressive than what you’re seeing in these photos, which oddly turned out darker and with a brownish tint, belying the attractive orangey red that actually predominates.\n\nThis piece, unusually long and thus encompassing 4 connected medallions, is likely from central Anatolia.\n\nOut of a Cooper auction.\n\nDetails of 36:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n37\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 37 is a central Anatolian yastik face.\n\nDespite its distressed condition, the juxtaposition of its motifs and the combination of its colors create a whole equal to more than the sum of its parts.\n\nThe yellow-ground border is a stroke of genius through simplicity.\n\nFrom a West Coast dealer on Rug Rabbit.\n\n*\n\n38\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 38 is a Konya (western Anatolia) yastik face, obtained from a Chicago dealer at the last Boston ACOR.\n\nIt’s entirely given over to a highly abstracted manifestation of the frequently-encountered dragon-and-phoenix theme, with the exception of the red bottom and top borders, which are referred to as “lapetts”, in this case with pentagons.\n\n*\n\n39\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 39 is a western Anatolian yastik face, acquired from James Cohen at the last D. C. ICOC.\n\nI was instantly drawn to the contrast of the powder blue and raspberry.\n\nCheck the abrash: She runs out of the blue about three-fourths of the way up, and subs in a seafoam green.\n\nThe circular boteh in diagonal formation lend a sense of tranquility.\n\n*\n\n40\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 40 is a Shahsevan (northwest Persia) long rug, sold by a San Francisco dealer at the Los Angeles ACOR.\n\nThe fascinating aspect here is that it’s in pile, but the weaver was copying the design of one or more plain flat-woven rugs and covers from the area, since all of the devices are drawn at right angles, as is mandated by the structure of such flat weaves.\n\nIt has a very supple handle, and a harmonious range of colors, including cerulean blue, cornflower blue, seafoam green, and 3 shades of yellow. The mordant employed to fix the probable walnut husk dye in the borders has caused a corrosive oxidation that give it a bas relief effect.\n\nDetails of 40:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n41\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 41 is a Shahsevan khorjin face, and what I call my “calamari” rug, in reference to its central medallion.\n\nThe fact that it was woven in pile is unusual, as so many bags from this Turkic tribe appear in soumac. Also seldom seen is this border pattern of boxed-in opposing sets of rabbit ears. Further note the odd outlining of the medallion with a very fine surround of red knots.\n\nBought at a Sloan’s auction in D. C.\n\n*\n\nDetails of 41:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n42\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 42 is a Shahsevan khorjin face, woven in the more characteristic soumac stitch.\n\nVery crisply drawn, and the forest green field is quite compelling as accentuated by the white-ground border.\n\nFound in a Frederick antiques emporium.\n\n*\n\n43\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 43 is a pile Shahsevan khorjin face.\n\nHarold sold it to me about 15 years ago, in part perhaps because of my long-running expression of admiration for Wendel Swan’s very similar piece.\n\nHarold used to opine that the primus inter pares of the 4 rugly virtues is “colora”, and, given the simplicity of the overall pattern, cruciform devices within a diagonal lattice, surrounded by a single white main border, that’s the name of the game here.\n\nEvery one of the diamonds is a separate minute masterpiece of tonality, and a testament to the dyer’s art that preceded that of the weaver, who reveals her own genius in the way the contrasting hues feed off each other.\n\nDetails of 43:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n44\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 44 is a face of a Balouch (Balouchistan) balisht, which is this Central Asian tribe’s (or, more accurately, broad set of tribes’) version of the Anatolian yastik.\n\nIt came to me from a Cooper auction. I felt bad about it, because when I walked into the auction room, a guy who worked there on the sales side, and whom I’d befriended as a fellow collector, asked me what I was after, and when I said “that little balisht”, he looked crestfallen, knowing that he couldn’t bid against a customer.\n\nAs befits the Balouchi lexicon, browns and dull reds predominate, but the blue, orange, and brighter red caught my eye as a deviation from that standard palate.\n\nDetails of 44:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n45\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 45 is a Balouch rug with a “crab” main border and a profusion of stepped polygons on a camel-colored field.\n\nIt has the characteristic 4-cord goat-hair selvages, but what seems quite odd is that, despite its pristine condition, the ubiquitous 3-4 inch flatwoven end finishes are non-extant.\n\nThe wool is luxuriant, and it has a wonderfully floppy handle. It’s the work of a very skillful and experienced weaver, as evidenced by the corner resolutions on the border, and perfect uniformity of size, shape, and spacing of the polygons.\n\nNote particularly the uniformity of the partial polygons as they disappear beneath the framework on the bottom, top, and both sides.\n\nOne of my earliest Cooper auction acquisitions.\n\nDetails of 45:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n46\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 46 is one combination face, back, and closure panel of a Balouch khorjin set.\n\nI have the other half of the set at home. I acquired them as pillows (at a country auction in Baltimore County) , and the reason they have remained together is presumably that they were stuffed many years ago and just moved from hand to hand as companion decorative accessories at either end of a sofa.\n\nIt’s well executed with rich wool, and achieves a bold effect despite the inherently limited palate of rugs from this area.\n\nNote the “zipper” has survived (a rare occurrence), and is presented in the “closed” position.\n\nAlso observe another example of the sculpted effect from corrosion of the mordant in the brown stars.\n\nDetails of 46:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n47\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 47 is a Malayer or Hamadan (northwest Persia) wagireh, sold to me by the late Roger Cavanna at his Jackson Square shop in San Francisco.\n\nIt’s single-wefted, but with a fairly stiff handle. There are 4 different borders, and 4 or 5 field designs, including a quadrant of a large yellow central medallion. The salmon is unusual in the overall rug universe, but more prevalent in this weaving area. Lots of abrash in the cocoa field. Here it is vertically reversed:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n48\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTextile 48 is a pile Camel Caravan long rug from northwest Persia.\n\nI picked it off for next to nothing at an Eastern Shore antiques auction. It’s 4.5 x 9 feet, and most of the red-ground field is unfortunately as distressed as the small bit that’s shown here, but the blue-ground border around all 4 sides (varying from navy to cornflower in hue) is in pretty decent health.\n\nThe only other one like this that I’ve seen was in the flesh at a dealer’s booth at the San Francisco ACOR. It looked like it had just come off the loom, and was magnificent, along with a second-mortgage price tag.\n\nSome of the elongated rectilinear dromedaries have riders, and there are other abstracted animals and humans scattered about. Note the “dice” inner and outer minor borders.\n\nThat concludes the pieces which I’ve brought. Following are those which came in from collectors in the audience. I unfortunately did not take notes on these, and can now only guess at their ethnographic identities based on the photographic images:\n\n49\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAudience piece 49 appears to be a Kurdish long rug, with an unusual and fascinating 5-color border, and a very striking combination of aubergine and emerald in some of the field motifs.\n\nDetails of 49:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n50\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAudience piece 50 appears to be a Malayer wagireh (although it may be a Bijar, but I’m not now able to feel whether or not it has the rug-of-iron structure and handle which would indicate the latter).\n\nThree different borders and a profusion of impressionistic floral designs in the field, but the salient features are, of course, the various surprisingly naturalistic tigers in pursuit of antlered prey.\n\nHere’s the right-side-up version, and then some details:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n51\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAudience piece 51 looks like a Bijar wagireh.\n\nThe absence of any border samples is unusual, but if it is, instead, a fragment, somebody would have gone to a lot of trouble to add the end and side finishes.\n\nWith no tactile or structural insights available, the Bijar case is furthered by the general coloration and floral design elements, including the arabesque “strapwork” in the southeast corner; and I get a hint of tightly-pounded wefts peaking through the worn-down pile along the right side.\n\nThe various shades of madder provide a vivid contrast to the midnight blue field.\n\n*\n\n52\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAudience piece 52 is a small complete khorjin set, a micro-treasure in a state of perfect fitness.\n\nThe multi-color barber-pole side finishes suggest southwest or southern Persia, the latter what the trade calls “Shiraz” when it can’t make a more specific ID.\n\nThe cartoonish animalistic and humanoid figures are quite charming, and I find the border scheme very attractive, reminiscent of the field in the Shahsevan khorjin face, no. 43.\n\n*\n\n53\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAudience piece 53 is an even tinier titan, another full khorjin set, also looking like it had been squirreled away from human and elemental interaction since bestowed as a dowry piece.\n\nI’m again guessing Shiraz, but in any event, the rich colors and geometric figures on a white canvas give it an archaic power.\n\nGordon took questions and brought his program to a close:\n\n*\n\n*\n\nI want to thank Gordon for driving over 1,000 miles, each way, bringing this strong material, and taking us knowledgeably through it. I’ve tried to recognize that a bit by giving him the modest bag he described above and a book he didn’t have on Kurdish textiles:\n\n*\n\n*\n\nI hope you have enjoyed Gordon’s session.\n\n“Til next time”,\n\nJohn\n\nOn September 21, 2019 Steve Price\n\n*\n\n*\n\ngave a Rug and Textile Morning Appreciation Morning program on “Artful African and Asian Garments.”\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTom Goehner, the TM Education Curator, introduced Steve, saying:\n\n“Steve is a collector and the leading editor and technical manager of the textile discussion site Turkotek.com. He written for such textile journals as Hali and Oriental Rug Review, and has given previous RTAMs here at the Textile Museum.\n\nIn his professional life, Steve is Emeritus Professor of Physiology and Biophysics at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond.”\n\nSince he was a professor, Steve felt obliged to give a framing lecturette, but promised that it would be short.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nHe started by taking a step back, saying “Why to we collect textiles?” He suggest that sometimes it is rooted in aesthetics, sometimes it begins when we acquire travel souvenirs, and sometimes it may originate in acquisitive, psychological tendencies best not discussed in public.” But, he continued “a related question is Why do we wear clothes?” He ticked off some of the reasons:\n\nModesty: in most societies it is seen as desirable to hide the genitals\n\nand, with women, breasts.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nProtection from the elements. Also to lessen the impact of surroundings, jungle-like plant life, etc. Below is a Chinese coir raincoat assembly\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAdornment: the wearer’s view of what is “beautiful.” (Steve said that he had selected the shirt he wore to make him look nice).\n\n*\n\n*\n\nHeraldic purposes: a military uniform,\n\n*\n\n*\n\n(above is Prince Charles in one of the military uniforms he is eligible to wear)\n\nA priest’s cassock, or even just a clerical collar.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTalismanic (believed to have occult powers, especially protective). Varies from culture to culture. Materials and designs in costumes and clothing are often used to invoke such powers.\n\nWe didn’t have any African masks in the room, but some like the one below were believed when worn in ceremonies to have such powers.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nChinese garments are often full of symbols thought to make long-life, happiness, good fortune, etc. more likely. Below is a fragment of a Chinese child’s hat the includes many such symbols.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nSteve said that he would present garments that he brought, starting with those from Africa and proceeding to Central Asia and finally, from mainland Southeast Asia.\n\nP1\n\n*\n\n*\n\nP1 is a Nigerian man’s robe, made by the Hausa or Nupe of Nigeria. It is indigo-dyed and embroidered. There would be trousers of the same “stuff” worn loose and flowing.\n\nDetails of P1.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nP2\n\n*\n\n*\n\nEwe people. Motifs on stripes have meaning.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nNotice that the motifs don’t go all the way to the borders.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nP3\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAshante. Note that the motifs go all the way to the borders. This is similar on the back.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nP4\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAshante, 1930 or older. silk and cotton.\n\nSeveral designs suggest a village chief or leader. Motifs are not specific to a locale, but are selected by what the weaver or wearer wants to convey.\n\nDetails of P4.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nNow Steve moved to Central Asia, coats in particular.\n\nP5\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThis coat is an Uzbek ikat coat. It’s for a man, although small by western standards. It’s said that Uzbek warriors were awarded such a coat for each enemy head.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nLined with Russian printed cotton.\n\nOther details of P5.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nP6\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAnother Uzbek ikat coat. This time probably for a woman. It appears to be all silk.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nInside is Russian printed cotton.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAdditional P6 details.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nP7\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTurkmen chyrpy. Embroidered in silk.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nWorn as a mantle, not as a coat. False sleeve hang down the back.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAgain the lining is Russian printed cotton.\n\nAdditonal details of P7.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nP8\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAnother Turkmen chyrpy. Inside Russian cotton {below) is more muted.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nNotice that different printed cottons are used at the inside edges and slits. This seems to be general Turkman usage.\n\nOther P8 details.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nSteve put P8 on to show how it is worn.\n\n*\n\nHere he is with it on front the front.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAnd here is what he looks like with it on from the back.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nNotice the small piece in the image above that connects the two false sleeves.\n\nI said that I collect on a budget and here, below, is as much of a chyrpy as I can afford. 🙂\n\n*\n\n(actual size: H, 5.25 inches, W, 2.25 inches)\n\n*\n\n*\n\nP9\n\n*\n\n*\n\nP9 is a yellow-ground Turkmen chyrpy. Again, the bridge and sleeve extensions are different.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe usual Russian printed cotton lining, with striped designs used at the edges, except for a boteh design at the top and shoulders.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nA question arose about whether chyrpy ground color had meaning.\n\nSome say that chyrpy ground color signals social status:\n\nDark ground – unmarried girls and women\n\nRed ground – married woman\n\nGreen and yellow ground – more mature women, 40-ish.\n\nWhite ground – a woman of at least 60 who is seen to have been a “good citizen”\n\nThe conversation in the Myers Room suggested that this is a market construction and that there is little evidence of it in the literature.\n\nI knew that Elena Tsareva had indicated in Hali, 198, pp. 50-59 that she was engaged in a study of Central Asian garments (a particular ikat coat collection). I thought that she might have or or encountered some information on this chyrpy ground color question and so I wrote her.\n\nShe has responded and agreed to let me quote her:\n\nColoring of chorpy does have meaning.\n\nOn the one side — it was the mark of age: thus, the white ones were used by aged women, no difference the tribe or her family status in the tribe.\n\nGreen (made of yashil keteni) and probably also red ones (of gyrmyzy keteni) were worn by brides since wedding and until 40 years old [Morozova A.S., 1971, p. 216].\n\nThe less studied are the yellow ones, although they are most numerous in Turkmenistan and Russian museums’ collections. One of the reasons is that that yellow chyrpy were out of use in the late 19th century already, so local population sold them rather eagerly to the Russians when the latter started to buy local works of folk art for museums [1] and international exhibitions [2]. Though pretty numerous, yellow head mantels are no way enough studied, and basic reason is the same – people who sold the pieces and gave information about them did not remember their origin and manner of wearing for sure. Thus –Morozova said they were used by women after 40 [3], while Samuil Dudin wrote that yellow chyrpy were made for unmarried girls, and were out of use before the beginning of the 20th century [4]; while general modern opinion is that girls did not wear head mantles at all.\n\nWhat I know is that most of yellow silk chyrpy were mostly made and used by Tekke. Yet another tribe to use yellow silk as a material for female headgear were the Salor: their brides put on a yellow dastor head cover on the second day of wedding, and wore it until 40 years old.\n\nBelow is quotation of my never published cataloque of textile objects from Halili collections.\n\nThe chyrpy under description belongs to the so-called yashyl – green colour – group, though here the shade looks more blue than green. This unclear definition of the tint could have happened because of the age of the piece.\n\nGreen was obtained through a two-baths system of dyeing: the textile was dyed dark blue first, and then with yellow. Depending on the quality of dyeing the pigment could have disappeared with time. On the other hand, in many languages there are no special words to differentiate green and blue (Persian kabu+d, for example), so this peculiarity can be another possibility to explain the case. Still the third variant can be that the name of the whole piece was defined by the colour of the collar, which is of beautiful green shade.\n\nIf compared to the yellow chyrpy in the collection, the piece has slightly different cut, as has additional gores at the sides. This element makes silhouette more fitting at the waist which is a typical feature for green/blue kind of head mantles as a whole. If to speak about chyrpy cut in general the number of small details we see is amazing: possibly there is no other similar complicated piece of clothes in Central Asian costume, with numerous tiny details, made of various textiles and with different finish.\n\nMost visual part of that variety is textiles, here we find blue, green, violet (side gores) and red (details of lining) keteni silk of local work; imported red cloth; urban-produced cotton print of Central Asian and Iranian work. Amazing thing is that all that variety is not accidental, but follows a stable tradition, with none or very little variations from one piece to another.\n\nThis, again, underlines a special ritual meaning of the piece for Turkmen female society which had its own priorities, believes and rituals, not known or very little known to the men. Much of that knowledge is now gone and possibly lost forever as was never described by early ethnographers. The latter were mainly men thus had no chance to talk to women in a pretty much closed Central Asian world, so there is very little hope that we can identify the reasons which rouse Turkmen women to make extremely complicated cuts, follow a very strict order of putting parts of their mantles together, use different linings, and so on.\n\nOne should not forget that all that was made in absolutely inconvenient conditions, and that fine silk is a very difficult textile to work with.\n\n[1] One of the first collections of Turkmen clothes we know was composed by K.P. von Kaufman (1818—1882), first Turkestan General Governor. In 1902 his collections were partly sold, and partly donated to the former Dashkov Ethnographic Museum in Moscow, which museum was broken up in 1930s, and handled to several Moscow and St-Petersburg museums. Turkmen chyrpy from K.P. Kaufman collection now belongs to the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography (Kunstkamera), coll. no. 8761\n\n[2] The first exhibitions which showed Turkmen costume to broad European public were: Russian Ethnographic Exhibition in Moscow, 1867, Turkestan Exhibition in Peterhof, 1869, International Textile Exhibition in ST-Petersburg, 1870, Moscow Polytechnical Exhibition, 1872; International Exhibition in Vienna, 1873 and so on.\n\n[3] Morozova A.S., 1971.

Leningrad, pp. 168—223.\n\nMy thanks to Elena for these indications, some, never before published.\n\nMore recently I happened on to some email exchanges with Peter Andrews and a German friend of his Hermann Rudolf, who collects Turkmen embroidery.\n\nI mentioned this question about whether the ground colors of Turkman chyrpys had social meaning and they both indicated that they did.\n\nPeter spoke first, saying: “\n\n“The information of the colour code to Turkmen chirpis was published decades ago by, I think, Beresneva, and I subsequently repeated it, so far as I remember, in in the Turcoman of Iran catalogue…I remember we repeated it at the TM in Washington when Mugul gave a talk on Turkmen costume some 30 years ago.”\n\nThen Hermann said more specifically: “\n\n“With regard to your query about chyrpys and the meaning of their colours, according to all accounts the various colours – green, blue, red / yellow / white – do have meaning. Chyrpys are worn by married women, and the different colours indicate the woman’s age group. They are therefore a social indicator. I have been told this several times during my stays in Turkmenistan (I was there 12 times, since 1993, about 9 months all in all), and read it in various articles and books.\n\n“This applies to the Teke:\n\n“Green, blue-green, and red chyrpys are worn by newly-married and young women (and older ones, if the woman simply keeps wearing her old chyrpy)\n\n“Yellow ones are worn by women from about 40 years of age onwards\n\n“White ones are worn by women from about 60 years of age onwards\n\n“You can quote:\n\n“Peter A. Andrews: “Crowning the Bride. Some Historical Evidence on Turkmen Women’s Costume (…). With Drawings by Mugul Andrews”.\n\nIn: Folk 33 (1991): 67-106. See p. 101\n\n“Hermann Rudolph: “Schutz und Segen. Abwehr- und Fruchtbarkeitsmagie in der turkmenischen Frauentracht. In: Eothen 4 (2007):303-356. Colours see pp. 325-328.\n\n(Protective and fertility magic in Turkmen women’s costume.)”\n\nThen, Peter spoke again:\n\n“Hermann has it right. There is no need to look further.\n\n“The only things I should add is that the age of 40 is drawn from the Prophet Muhammad’s own marriage, and that the Turkmen appear to regard indigo blue as a variety of green. When the Yomut used the chirpi (they no longer do), it was green, but plain apart from applied silver ornament (see my article cited by Hermann). The Teke ones are invariably indigo.\n\n“Both, so far as I know, are referred to as yashil chirpi, green chirpi. By the way it is a nonsense to use an I and a y in chirpy: the Turkmen letter is a dotless I in both positions, sounding like the e in butter.”\n\nNow Steve moved to southeast Asia.\n\nP10\n\n*\n\n*\n\nP10 was woven in Laos by one of the Thai-speaking people, the T’ai Daeng. It is a head cloth worn by a priestess.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nSnake images. One reason many cultures consider snakes to be sort of magical is their ability to move without appendages.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nP11\n\n*\n\n*\n\nDetails of P11.\n\nLaos. Motifs include what appear to be birds and elephants. Birds are considered special in many cultures because of their ability to fly. Humans can’t even do that badly. The elephant’s power is obvious.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nP12\n\n*\n\n*\n\nLaos, T’ai Hun skirt.\n\nTapestry borders.

Similar to P12.\n\nIt’s Steve’s opinion that the most sophisticated weavings in the world are those of Laotian hill tribes.\n\nDetails of P13.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nP14\n\n*\n\n*\n\nCambodia ikat skirt. Silk\n\nDetails of P14.\n\n(color difference due to camera and lighting)\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nP15\n\n(folded double; it’s twice as wide)\n\n*\n\n*\n\nP15 is another Cambodian ikat skirt.\n\nDetails of P15.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nP16 and P17\n\nTwo large pieces had hung on the front board and Steve moved to treat them next.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nSteve said that he believes these two pieces were used either as temple hanging or as pantaloons. He thinks the patterns suggest that they were temple hangings. Very fine silk.\n\nLet’s treat them one at a time, the one on the right first (we’ll call it P16)\n\n*\n\n*\n\nOne detail of P16.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nP17\n\n(the one on the left above)\n\n*\n\n*\n\nDetails of P17.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nP18\n\n*\n\n*\n\nP18 was shown horizontally. It is Cambodian, silk. It is a type of unisex pantaloon that you might remember seeing in movies like King and I, Kismet, and Alladdin.\n\nDetails of P18.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nSteve demonstrated how this panel was converted into a pantaloon.\n\nFirst the panel is taken behind the wearer’s back and then twisted together in the front.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nNext the twisted part is taken down between the wearer’s legs, brought up in back and tucked into the back.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nMy camera work wasn’t quick enough to capture this pass and tucking. But Steven has given this demonstration before in another session and for clarity I have put it in here.\n\nHere’s a TM volunteer modeling this same hipwrapper. It starts by being put around her, kind of like a horizontal sling.\n\nNext, she holds the two sides together around her waist (I think a clip of some sort was used by the Khmer; she’s holding it closed with her hand).\n\nSteve is holding the ends of the sling, and twists them together to form sort of a rope. The rope then get’s passed through her legs and the end is tucked into the waist at the back.\n\nThis is a unisex garment. Yul Brynner wore one in his role as the King in The King and I.\n\n*\n\nP19\n\n*\n\nI brought five pieces to Steve’s program. The first one I want to show here is African and relates to the mainland SE Asian piece P18.\n\nI own only one, sub-Saharan, African textile,\n\na Dida, tie-dyed, tube skirt from the Ivory Coast. Finger woven from raffia fibers. The Met bought one, a while back, and took out a page in Hali to brag about it.\n\nI showed this piece, recently, in another RTAM and had Julie Geschwind in the audience, who knows such textiles, said that she had another, and a hat that goes with it.\n\nShe also knows how such pieces are made and demonstrated that, a bit, in this session.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nShe had said, previously, that the big toes are important in the way that such pieces are “plaited” (her term).\n\nShe said the plaiter sits on the ground with her legs extended and stretches a cord in a double pass between her big toes. This cord goes around these two toes and forms an oval basis for the beginning of this plaited garment (which is woven as a tube skirt). The plaiter works with strands of raffia plaiting them toward her from this “waist” cord. This plaiting process uses no equipment except the two big toes.\n\nOnce the garment has been plaited, it is tie-dyed in a way that creates a definite external texture on the tube ‘skirt.” (The inside of this garment remains smooth and comfortable to wear.)\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThis garment is put on, initially, as a tube skirt, open at the bottom. But it is not worn in that way. Like the process demonstrated in P18 above the strands at the bottom of the skirt are twisted together taken through the legs front to back and are tucked into the waist in the back, converting the seeming skirt into a pantaloon.\n\nShe said that such pantaloons are worn by both sexes.\n\nI brought a second piece that I think may be African. It could be a garment. It is cotton, woven in six strips and then sewn together. Nice, fresh colors. I think it has no particular age.\n\nP20\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe closest thing I’ve seen is:\n\nAso oke fabric, (Yoruba: așǫ oke, pronounced ah-SHAW-okay) is a hand-woven cloth created by the Yoruba people of west Africa. Aso oke means “top cloth” in the English language, denoting cloth of high status.[1][2] Usually woven by men, the fabric is used to make men’s gowns, called agbada, women’s wrappers, called iro, and men’s hats, called fila.\n\nAso oke is from the Yoruba culture in Ondo, Oyo, Ogun, Ekiti, Lagos, and Osun States in southwestern Nigeria and Ajase in southeastern Benin Republic.\n\nThe way of making the cloth has remained the same for centuries, however new techniques and production methods have been looked into to eliminate the weight and thickness of the aso oke cloth, and to make it more accessible for casual wear.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nBut I’m not sure at all. I don’t think this is an important textile, but I’d be interested to hear from anyone who can tell me more about it.\n\nMy second piece was Chinese and embroidered. It was a decoration for the lower edge of a gown sleeve. The embroidery in silk is very fine.\n\nP21\n\n*\n\n*\n\nDetails of P20. I think it might have some age but to not know. A curator I showed it to said that real collectors collect them in pairs, confirming my lowly place in the textile collector world.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nA second Chinese piece I brought was a mounted and framed fragment of a Chinese child’s embroidered hat.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nYou saw this image at the beginning. Here are some closer details of parts of it.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAn expert on Chinese textiles told me that the face on this part of it indicates that it was likely made by an non-Han embroiderer.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAnother Chinese piece I brought was the one below. It is the front of a child’s rain cape made in rural southwest non-Han China. It is made of raffia plant fibers but looks like a bearskin.\n\nP23\n\n*\n\n*\n\nBelow is a look at its back. It is not woven but instead plaited or knotted.\n\n*\n\nIt is one of my responses to the color, color, color mantra that I use to show that texture can also be important.\n\nI quite like it but my wife would like to see it get out of our apartment.\n\nI brought one Central Asian child’s hat. It was described as Afghan.\n\nP24\n\n*\n\n*\n\nRoger Pratt had brought some SE Asian textiles and we finish with them.\n\nRoger began with a cotton, stole woven in Gujarat, India. He showed an identical piece from a V&A exhibition in Sarasota, Florida.\n\n*\n\nP25\n\n*\n\n*\n\nP25 is a stole quite similar to one featured in the traveling exhibition of The Fabric of India from holdings of London’s Victoria and Albert Museum and private collections that was at the Ringling Museum in Sarasota, Florida from July 7 to October 13 2019.\n\nBoth were the workmanship one of the artisan Dayalal Kudecha in Bhujodi, Kutch, Gujarat circa 2014. (See page 220 of the Exhibition Catalog V&A Publishing 2019, edited by Rosemary Crill, illustrating how traditional techniques are being adapted to a contemporary context).\n\nThis piece was acquired from the artist in Bhuj.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nDetails of P25\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nP26\n\n*\n\n*\n\nP26 is a woman’s ceremonial skirt “pha sin” made by the Tai Nuea people, Sam Nuea region, Laos in silk, cotton natural dyes, weft ikat, supplementary weft weave.\n\nThis is an archaic banded form, alternating between cotton bands of indigo ikat and silk bands of red ikat with highlights of different colors. The red bands contain the serpent motif (nak) viewed from above, while the blue-black bands show the same creature in writhing profile.\n\nSee p. 216 of Textiles of Southeast Asia by Robyn Maxwell, published by Periplus Editions 2003 (HK) for a similar example.\n\nDetails of P26.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nP27\n\n*\n\n*\n\nP27 is a Syrian ikat woman’s jacket (salteh) similar to one recently featured at the exhibition of David and Elizabeth Reisbord Collection at UCLA’s Fowler Museum: Dressed with Distinction: Garments From Ottoman Syria which ran from March 17-August 25.\n\nLate 19th century, silk, cotton, metallic thread, weft faced weave, slit tapestry technique, and metallic embroidery.\n\nHere is a full view of the front.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nDetails of P27.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nBelow is a sleeve extended.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nA really beautiful coat.\n\n*\n\nSteve took questions and brought his session to a close.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTom Goehner announced that he was leaving the Textile Museum and this was his last RTAM.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTom has been with the Textile Museum for 11 years. We wish him well.\n\nHope you have enjoyed Steve’s strong program.\n\nR. John Howe\n\nOn August 6, 2016, Fred Mushkat\n\n*\n\n*\n\ngave a Rug and Textile Appreciation Morning program, here at the Textile Museum here in Washington, DC on the subject of\n\n*\n\nFred said that when he first started to collect textiles he was simply buying the most beautiful things that he could afford. Then he decided that his real interest was ethnographic and this took him to bands and other warp-faced nomad textiles that seemed most likely to have been made for use rather than for sale. Fred’s program also provided a preview of a book that he is writing on such textiles.\n\nIn his work life, Fred is a medical doctor, specializing in emergency medicine. He is also a skilled photographer and is dedicated to making the best cup of espresso he can.\n\nFred began with an illustrated lecture.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nQashqa’i dwellings were rectangular goat-hair tents that did not require tent bands for stabilization. Photo: Julia Bailey\n\n*\n\n*\n\nIn this rare photograph, the roof of the goat-hair tent is adorned with lines of animals and large tufts. Hanging from the front edge of the roof are large tassels of colored wool attached to long braided cords. Sometimes a band with similar braids and tassels would be temporarily attached to the front of the roof on special occasions.\n\n* *\n\nIn this photo, a Qashqa’i woman sits in front of the baggage pile that occupies the rear of the tent along the entire width. The baggage pile is covered with a flat woven textile. On the right side of the tent, a small bag is attached to the pole. These bags often held cooking utensils or weaving tools such as a spindle. Photo: Peter Andrews, 1970\n\n*\n\n*\n\nQashqa’i tents could be quite large and tall, as in this photo of a khan’s tent. Photo: Peter Andrews, 1970.\n\n* *\n\nIn this tent, the floor is covered with carpets. A long gelim, typically woven with weft-faced patterning, covers the baggage pile. Along the front of the roof line hangs a cord attached to which are large tassels. Above the baggage pile, along the rear wall is another group of tassels that may be attached to a woven band. Photo: Peter Andrews, 1970\n\n* *\n\nA long gelim covers the baggage pile with bedding neatly piled above it. The side of the goat-hair tent has been raised to allow ventilation. The white cloth protects woven textiles from being stained with food. In the foreground on the left is a woman in Western clothing, perhaps a visitor. The khan on the right, second from the end, wears the traditional hat of the Qashqa’i Photo: Roland & Sabrina Michaud, 1970.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe baggage pile in this tent is covered by a jajim. This weaving takes less time to make than a gelim. It is neither warp-faced or weft faced, as it is made with a twill weave in which one side of the cloth is warp-predominant, while the other is weft predominant. Reciprocal triangles separate the narrow bands of color; the wider section has a long row of stepped diamonds. Large tassels are attached to the bottom length of the jajim. >Photo: Peter Andrews, 1970>\n\n* *\n\nThe baggage in this photo is placed upon a bed of rocks to keep the bedding bags dry. The baggage (bedding bags) is then covered by an elaborate long gelim with horizontal panels, no two of which appear to be alike. Photo: Peter Andrews, 1970\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThis is the same baggage pile with the gelim folded back to expose the separate bedding bags. Commonly called mafrash, the Qashqa’i refer to these woven containers as marfaj. They are generally woven with various structures of weft-faced patterning. Rarely, these were made with a warp-faced structure. Photo: Peter Andrews, 1970\n\n*\n\n*\n\nDuring transport, the bedding bags, which were made in pairs, were loaded on each side of a pack animal to balance the load. This required the work of multiple men. In this photo a camel is being readied for the day’s travel. Photo, Ullens de Schooten, 1956\n\n*\n\n*\n\nHere the man is loading a donkey in preparation for transit. He is using a plaited cord to secure the load on a donkey. In former times, warp-faced bands were used for this purpose. Photo, MohammadReza Baharnaz.>\n\n*\n\n*\n\nIn order to prevent slippage that would cause the load to be unbalanced, the cord (or band) must be tightened as much as possible.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nDigard, an anthropologist who lived among the Bakhtiyari, drew a schematic for wrapping a load on a pack animal using a cord. In the drawing, there is a buckle that can be used to pull the cord as tight as possible to secure the load.\n\n* *\n\nIn this photo by Roland and Sabrina Michaud, Qashqa’i tribespeople are migrating. Donkeys, mules and camels are the pack animals; horses were considered too special to be used for carrying loads. In this photo from 1970, all of the visible loads are secured with plaited ropes. All of the buckles are intentionally placed on the right side of the baggage load. The buckles on the left and right of the photo appear identical.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nFred then moved on to discuss the various structures used to make warp-faced weavings. The most basic of these structures is warp-faced plain weave, as seen in this slide. Each warp goes over a weft, then under the next weft repeating succession. This gives the fabric the appearance of horizontal ribbing. Image from The Primary Structure of Fabrics, Irene Emory.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nBy comparison, weft-faced weaving creates patterns by moving under and over warps. In this slide, each weft goes over a warp, then under the next, repeating until a color change is desired. This structure is known as slit tapestry weave. At the color change, the yarn reverses direction. This structure creates vertical slits between colors. To improve structural integrity, the vertical slits are minimized in length. Small cruciform designs and stepped triangles are used for this purpose. Note that the background pattern in weft-faced weaving creates a vertical ribbing.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThis structure is warp-faced plain weave with warp substitution. The pattern is created by warps moving over and under wefts, as in warp-faced plain weave, The unneeded warps float on the back of the weaving until a color change is desired to make a given pattern. At that point the different colors change position, with the former now floating on the back while the latter begin moving above and below the wefts. These are one sided cloths, as the pattern is clearly visible on the obverse, while the reverse side shows lengths of warp floats. Image from Woven Structures, Marla Mallett.\n\n* *\n\nThis slide shows a structure known as warp-faced alternating float weave. A warp goes over three wefts then under one. The adjacent warps are one over then one under. The next warp goes under one weft (the middle weft of the three that the first warp traveled over) then over three. Image from The Primary Structure of Fabrics, Irene Emory.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAlternating the float of the warps creates a slotted appearance of the face of the weaving. The Qashqa’i call this structure kalak. The repeating mirror image design of this band resembles the letter “A”placed sideways.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nOn the back side of the weaving, the design can barely be made out.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThis is a detail of a Shahsavan band made with the same structure. The repeating motif is an identical detail to the sideways letter “A” seen in the previous Qashqa’i band. This design, which is rare in any other structure, is a reminder of the common origins of the Shahsevan and Qashqa’i.\n\n* *\n\nThe most common structure for warp-faced bands is warp-faced one-weft double cloth. This structure is two-layered, with a common weft thread that moves from front to back as the weaving progresses. Used for tensile strength to hold loads on animals, this structure is the strongest of all the warp-faced weavings. The strength is derived from the two layers, but just as important, it is the exchange of warps moving from one side to the other that locks the two layers together. A limiting factor to the strength of double cloth bands is the absence of horizontal pattern exchanges, because the warps are not changing position between the layers. This band broke at this place because of a longer run without many such warp exchanges.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nHere the two layers are peeled apart up to the area of a horizontal exchange that covers the width of the field.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nWarp-faced one-weft double cloth creates a textile with the colors reversed between the layers. One side of the cloth “reads” better; in general, the side with a dark ground color in the field has clearer design elements. Light motifs on a dark ground in the top photo are more distinct than the reverse side in the middle photo. A common weaving error in weaving double cloth is “dropped warps on the underside as the weaving progresses. The bottom photo shows multiple areas in which the red warps miss, or drop, a weft on the underside of the band.\n\n* *\n\nThese two photos are the outer and inner sides of a rare marfaj woven in double cloth. Unlike a narrow band, this weave is about a meter wide. When Fred examined this container closely, he noticed that the outer side had dark blue wefts that are most visible between the undyed cotton warps that make up the quadruped (top photo). When he looked at the inside layer of the container, he noticed that the wefts were red (bottom photo). Rather than being one-weft double cloth, this weaving has two wefts, one for each side. This warp-faced two-weft double cloth is not documented anywhere in the textile literature. After finding this structure, Fred began looking at other containers and has discovered the same two weft construction on another marfaj and on a number of Qashqa’i single and double bags. At this time, no other weaving culture in Iran is known to have used this structure.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAt the beginning of the weaving of a band, it is difficult to pack the wefts tightly. The effect of this is to make the band wider, looser and weaker at the start of the weaving. To improve the structural integrity of the band and consequently to minimize breakage, this band had a few rows of wefts woven after which the end of the band was removed from the loom in order to tightly pack the wefts more than could be done on the loom. After the wefts were tightly beaten, the band was reattached to the loom and weaving was continued. Bands that had this treatment were significantly narrower at the start of the weaving, as this slide demonstrates.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nQashqa’i women often marked the start and/or end of the weaving of a band by making one or more rows of weft twining. Typically these rows are in colors that strongly contrast with the rest of the weaving. In this slide, two weft twining rows are spaced a few centimeters apart at the end of the weaving, just before the braided end. Rows of weft twining also appear on gelims, skirts of rugs, and on bands of other groups, including Khamseh and Shahsevan.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nBands are secured by pushing a loop of the body of the band through a hole in the buckle. A wooden peg is put in the loop and the band is tightened. This method makes a securely tight load on a pack animal.\n\n* *\n\nDating of pack-animal bands is problematic. Peter Andrews did research on the Qashqa’i and Shahsevan in the early 1970s and noted that a pack animal band had a lifespan of about ten years. A wooden or forged iron buckle could be removed and placed on a new band. This band may be the only known pack-animal band with a date. There are three places where there may be a date of 1331. In the solar calendar, the date is roughly 1952; in the lunar (hirji) calendar, the date is roughly 1913.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nDesigns on double cloth bands are lim"
