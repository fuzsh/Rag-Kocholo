        "text": "Yuliy Borisovich Briner was born in 1920 in Vladistock, Russia. His mother Katya was an actress with the Moscow Art Theatre. After being abandoned by his father, his family moved to China and then to Paris where he played guitar in clubs and worked in the circus as an acrobat. After a back injury, he and his mother immigrated to America to be with his sister, a singer who was already living and working in the US. During World War II he served as a French speaking radio announcer and trained in acting with Michael Chekhov. He made his Broadway debut in 1941 with a production of “Twelfth Night” directed by Chekhov and featuring many of his students. It played the Little Theatre for 15 performances. Two years later he was back on Broadway in the comedy “The Moon Vine” also starred Will Geer. It was then he started doing television work. His next Broadway outing was “Lute Song,” a musical based on a famous Chinese play. It was directed by John Houseman and Mary Martin starred. Martin's next employer would also be Brynner's: Rodgers and Hammerstein. The pair starred Martin in “South Pacific” while Brynner won the role of King Mongkut in their adaptation of “Anna and the King of Siam” called “The King and I.” The “I” of the title was the far more experienced, but much less musical, Gertrude Lawrence. It opened on Broadway in March 1951, and Lawrence won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her performance. Due to poor health, she missed numerous performances until she finally was hospitalized. While in the hospital, a day before her death, she instructed that Brynner's name to be added to the marquee of the St. James, which previously only included hers. Brynner won the Tony for best Featured Actor in a Musical due to his initial billing. When the film was made in 1956, Brynner suggested producers cast Deborah Kerr, whose singing was dubbed by Marni Nixon. Brynner won the 1957 Oscar for Best Actor. He played the King in the short-lived 1972 TV series “Anna and the King” opposite Samantha Eggar. He took the King back to Broadway in a 1977 revival starring with Constance Towers as Mrs. Anna. He was now so famous in the role that the Playbill merely had a photo of Brynner – no title needed. In 1985 he did yet another triumphant return as the King opposite Mary Beth Piel. The Theatre Wing awarded him an honorary Tony for his 4,625 performances in the role. It is believed to be the most of any performer in a single role. This would be his final appearance on the Great White Way. He did one other show in between “King and I” revivals, a huge failure called “Home Sweet Homer,” a musical about Homer's Odysseus stories. The show was in terrible trouble off-stage as well as on. Brynner and his co-star Joan Diener knew they were in a flawed show and missed many performances. They sued Trader Vics restaurant for $7.5 million claiming they ate 'poisonous ribs' that hampered their ability to work. Brynner tried to get out of his contract, but was threatened with a one million dollar suit for breach if he did so. The show closed on opening night at the Palace, allowing Brynner to return to the role of the King for the rest of his life. A smoker since the age of 12, Brynner had a lung removed before the film version of “The King and I” and although he 'packed up' during the early 70's during his final Broadway engagement got the news that the other lung was riddled with terminal cancer. He filmed an anti-smoking PSA for TV that was shown after his death in 1985. Brynner had been married four times and had five children."
