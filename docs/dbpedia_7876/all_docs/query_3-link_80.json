        "text": "Cheese, chocolate and banks make up many people's view of Switzerland. But what about actor Yul Brynner or philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau?\n\nHistorian Leo Schelbert has been taking aim at some of the clichés surrounding the country, while also trying to explain the diversity and complexity of this small but successful nation.\n\nIt took three-and-a-half years for Schelbert, a Swiss citizen and emeritus professor of history at the University of Chicago at Illinois, to compile his Historical Dictionary of Switzerland, which has been published in the United States.\n\n“It was aimed at the American audience but also beyond, trying to show that the country is not a negligible little thing somewhere with chocolate and some mountains, but a vibrant industrial nation that is involved in all the great and sometimes bad things that happen in the world,” Schelbert told swissinfo from Chicago.\n\nWhile chocolate and cheese do not make it into the book, banking and the Alps most certainly do. We learn for instance that the alpine passes, which connected northern Europe to the south, were central to the formation of Switzerland as a separate nation.\n\nThe peaks, so dominant in Switzerland’s landscape, have become symbols of Swiss independence and neutrality. Folk hero William Tell, he of the apple-shooting feat, was a mountain man.\n\nThere are surprises too: the dictionary reveals that Yul Brynner’s father was Swiss and that the actor most likely attended a school in canton Aargau. Some, associating Rousseau strongly with France, may not have realised that the philosopher was born in Geneva, the son of a watchmaker.\n\nUnfathomable?\n\nBut explaining how multilingual, multi-layered Switzerland works is no easy task. Indeed, the preface points to how Switzerland’s complexity and diversity “make it harder to fathom than most other places”.\n\nOne of the main problems is that most nations, the United States included, are centralist, with one main figure at the head of the country. People only really choose whom they put into government, says Schelbert.\n\nThe Swiss, however, are federalist, meaning that the 26 cantons have a say in running the country. People can also vote on various issues, such as at the end of November when they accepted the government’s policy of prescribing heroin for hardcore addicts.\n\nThe multiparty, seven-member cabinet reaches its decisions by consensus.\n\n“The Swiss system doesn’t even have a president – it’s only a nominal, honorific post with no special powers and the government is an executive. This is not easily understood,” Schelbert said.\n\nNeutrality\n\nAnother area which people find “hard to fathom” is neutrality, described by Schelbert as “Switzerland’s fundamental foreign policy principle”.\n\nNeutrality came under particular fire in the US after the Second World War and again in the early 1990s when Swiss banks were accused of harbouring Jewish gold confiscated by the Nazis and the country of turning back refugees at its borders during the conflict.\n\n“Opponents have called Switzerland’s position of neutrality anachronistic, immoral and selfish; proponents view it as the basis of the nation’s survival as an independent and democratic state and the foundation of its extensive mediating of international Good Offices,” writes Schelbert under the entry for neutrality.\n\nHe argues that the Good Offices – mediation between parties – show how neutrality became tied to solidarity and the promotion of peace.\n\nSwitzerland is also the home of many humanitarian organisations, including the Swiss-run International Committee of the Red Cross, which monitors the Geneva Conventions on the treatment of civilians and combatants in times of war, he adds.\n\n“The dictionary was not aimed at being nationalistic or praising, not at being condemning or critical – it is simply trying to show the richness of Switzerland’s history, its four language regions and its global involvement,” Schelbert said.\n\nA Swiss abroad"
