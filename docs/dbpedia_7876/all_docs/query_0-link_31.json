During the year 1965 the Office of the United Nations High commissioner for Refugees continued its work of protection and assistance, not without considerable anxiety at times because of the proliferation of refugees in some regions of the world. Owing to events, this work has constantly increased in scope, while at the same time its nerve centre has been shifting from Europe towards Africa and Asia.\n\n2. In Europe, fortunately, the situation today seems to be stabilized. From the point of view of material assistance, the problem of the \"old refugees\", to the solution of which so many efforts have been devoted during the last ten years, may now be considered to belong to the past. In the present state of the economies of the host countries, and provided, of course, that there are no new and unexpected upheavals, it can be assumed that it will be possible for those countries, with the modest but effective assistance of the present programme, to cope not only with the inevitable aftermath of the former problems but with the various instances of the limited but constant movement of new refugees. In Europe, therefore, protection is once again assuming the primary place that was originally assigned to it in the activities of the High Commissioner's Office, upon which it lays obligations that are as diverse as they are compelling, since they cover the manifold aspects of advisory, administrative and legal aid, in their broadest sense. It is indeed through this persistent daily effort to mobilize in each country the co-operation and energy required for the solution, from day to day, of the innumerable individual problems connected with the refugee status that the Office is endeavouring to prevent a recurrence of the earlier situation, characterized by the desperate crowding of refugees in the camps and by so much stark misery. Let us remember that in Europe emigration occupies an important place in the solution of the refugee problem. The Office of the High Commissioner has accordingly continued to encourage the countries of immigration to adopt a more and more liberal policy with regard to the admission of refugees, especially handicapped refugees.\n\n3. During the same period there has been a considerable increase in the number of refugees in Africa, which is now approaching 600,000. New groups have appeared in the Central African Republic and Zambia, while the number of refugees whom various countries were already sheltering has itself been increasing. In developing countries which have no large stocks of food and no solid economic structures that would enable them to deal unaided with these sudden influxes of population, the first task of the Office of the High Commissioner has been to see that the essential and immediate needs of refugees are supplied, after which it has worked with the Governments concerned, and at their specific request, to seek ways of overcoming once and for all the problems which affect, in some cases seriously, their social, economic and political balance.\n\n4. The general objectives towards which the Office of the High Commissioner is working in Africa and Asia are no different from what they have always been: freely agreed repatriation when that is possible, failing that, integration on the spot or - and this is much rarer in Africa - emigration to other host countries. Where there is, generally speaking, a difference is in the ways and means of attaining the objective which is most often sought: namely, the establishment of the refugees on land made available to them by the Governments of the countries which have given them asylum. Here it has been necessary to adapt the methods to the individual conditions of each of those countries. Moreover, in drawing up the integration plans the Office of the High Commissioner has naturally sought the technical advice of the various specialized agencies of the United Nations which are concerned, on the spot, with the economic and social development of the countries in question. Their collaboration is even more necessary in cases where the work initiated by the High Commissioner's Office for the benefit of the refugees alone is to be consolidated for the benefit of all the people of the country or zone concerned. Consequently, whether it is a question of protection or assistance, the work of the High Commissioner's Office in dealing with the new refugee problems is fundamentally unchanged: all it needs is to be suitably adapted to the particular needs which arise from the very nature of the environment in which the refugees are to settle.\n\n5. A rapid review of the results achieved brings out two points: the first is that only prompt, flexible and pragmatic action on the part of the High Commissioner's Office can make it possible to circumvent the problems in good time, to prevent the most harmful consequences or developments, and to tackle their practical, and if possible final, solution successfully and constructively. While there have been delays, and even disappointments, here and there, they have been due mainly to circumstances and to the vicissitudes of the internal political life of the countries concerned. Nevertheless, multilateral aid, in the form and the humanitarian spirit that the High Commissioner's Office imparts to it, appears to have proved, once and for all, its value and effectiveness.\n\n6. Another point that the experience gained, especially during the last twelve months, seems to have brought out is that in many cases this action should be somewhat intensified and prolonged if its results are not to be prejudiced or questioned. The necessary support for longer-term assistance for the development of the whole country or region is not something that is easily organized. It requires time, and for the refugees, uprooted as they are, such delays may prove harmful, if not catastrophic. It therefore seems essential that the High Commissioner's action should be continued up to the point at which it can provide a solid basis for the integration of the refugees and for the subsequent action to be taken in the more general framework of the development of the country in question. Moreover, the financing of programmes for regional development covering both refugees and the local population raises a delicate problem which the High Commissioner's Office is making every effort to solve, in co-operation with the Governments and specialized agencies concerned.\n\n7. Thus the events which have occurred in past years and which have brought about the extraordinary geographical expansion of the activities of the Office of the High Commissioner have in no way affected the unity of its work. The example of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where a strong intervention was necessary to prevent the carrying out of an expulsion order in 1964 applying to all the Rwandese refugees who were being sheltered in that country, is enough to demonstrate, if that were necessary, the close interdependence of protection and assistance. In fact, the assistance in connexion with integration of this particular group of refugees had to be interrupted until the necessary guarantees for their establishment there had been obtained. The purely legal function of the Office of the High Commissioner and its social function are more often than not practically inseparable, whatever the theatre of operation may be.\n\n8. Another point to be noted, at the close of this year of intensive work carried on within an increasingly extensive geographical framework which reflects the universality of the mission entrusted to the Office of the High Commissioner, is the increasing support of the international community for the principles governing the Office's activities and the rules established by the Convention of 28 July 1951 on the attitude to be adopted and the guarantees to be granted to refugees by the countries sheltering them. It is encouraging to note the respect that is generally shown, on all continents, to the humanitarian principle of the right of asylum and its corollary of not driving refugees back to their country of origin. Similarly, there is cause for satisfaction in the favourable reactions of many Governments to the draft protocol which was drawn up at the seminar held at Bellagio last year and which is designed to extend the effects ratione personae of the Convention to refugees who are victims of events that have occurred since 1 January 1951.\n\n9. There is still need, however, for a tremendous effort to extend this support still further and to consolidate it, to have it inscribed in the texts and to ensure that it does not remain a dead letter. Only thus will it be possible to create the most favourable conditions for prompt and satisfactory solution of the refugee problem. It is impossible to exaggerate the importance, in this respect, of the action of regional organizations such as the Organization of African Unity, the Organization of American States and the Council of Europe. Praise is also due to the very many voluntary organizations, including the League of Red Cross Societies, without whose generous support the Office of the High Commissioner, which is a non-operational body, would often lack the intermediary it needs for the carrying out its programme. In this context mention should also be made of the role played by national or inter-governmental agencies such as the United States Escapee Programme (USEP) and the Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration (ICEM).\n\n10. In short, it seems that the progress of international co-operation in the refugee question is both real and continuous. It leaves the door wide open for concerted action, corresponding to today's increasing needs, on the part of the various organizations which, whether in the public or private, national or international, sector, take part in the solution of the refugee problem, from a distance or close at hand. Faithful to the demands of its mandate, the Office of the High Commissioner works unremittingly to arouse, stimulate and co-ordinate their action, without ever departing from the neutrality that its purely humanitarian and social mission imposes upon it.\n\nCHAPTER I INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION IN FAVOUR OF REFUGEES\n\nA. General observations\n\n11. In his report to the General Assembly at its twentieth session, the High commissioner stated the importance which he attaches to the motto of International Co-operation Year, \"peace and progress through co-operation\". Another year has since elapsed in which relations with Governments and other organizations have been further developed for the benefit of refugees. The serious problems which nowadays face the Office of the High Commissioner call for the concerted efforts of governmental, municipal and local authorities, and of inter-governmental and non-governmental organizations alike. They also demand the support of the public at large, of the Press, radio and television, and of other media of information which are so important in the humanitarian field. Constant efforts are accordingly being made to utilize every source of goodwill that can be geared to the work of assistance to refugees.\n\n12. The new pattern of co-operation is developing steadily so that whenever a new problem arises, a mechanism of assistance is readily available and can be put into motion at short notice with the co-operation of the authorities and organizations that are, in the circumstances, in the best position to help. Largely through this co-operative effort it has proved possible to launch and implement a number of comprehensive programmes for important groups of refugees, which have been brought to a successful conclusion. Only by maintaining and expanding this effort will it be possible to contain the new problems now facing the international community in the field of assistance to refugees.\n\nB. Co-operation with Governments and local authorities\n\n13. The work of the Office of the High Commissioner continues to depend, very largely, on the support and co-operation received from Governments. This support is playing an increasingly significant role in view of the fact that during the past year, the Governments of over sixty countries were in one way or another connected with the work of the Office. Each of these countries has welcomed refugees who are the concern of this Office. Over fifty-five made financial contributions to the work of the Office in 1965 and, at the time of writing this report, the fiftieth accession to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees was expected in the very near future.\n\n14. The growing interest shown by Governments in the work of UNHCR was highlighted in three resolutions adopted by the General Assembly at its twentieth session. The Assembly decided to dedicate United Nations Day, 1966, to the cause of refugees, invited States Members of the United Nations and members of the specialized agencies to increase their support for the humanitarian action of the High Commissioner's Office and asked them to devote special attention to the problems of refugees in Africa. Since his election in December 1965 the High Commissioner has consulted with a number of Governments on the manifold tasks facing his Office. Visits were made by senior officials of UNHCR to at least twenty countries where the problems of refugees are particularly acute, and where assistance programmes have been put into effect or new problems of refugees are being investigated by UNHCR. Essential governmental support was given in all the countries concerned. Particular mention should be made of the role played by the local authorities. They are in many cases in daily contact with the refugees and are often responsible for the implementation of assistance programmes. Their co-operation is, therefore, an indispensable part of the mechanism of international solidarity for assistance to refugees.\n\nC. Co-operation with members of the United Nations family and other inter-governmental organizations\n\n15. For many years now it has proved essential for the Office to join efforts with other members of the United Nations family and inter-governmental organizations working in the humanitarian, economic and social field, in order to be able to deal with the manifold aspects of the problems of refugees. This co-operation is proving increasingly important as new problems emerge, particularly in developing areas where solutions are closely bound up with the implementation of development projects for the benefit of the refugees and the local population alike. As indicated in chapter III, two projects of this kind have already been put into effect by the International Labour Organisation with the co-operation of experts from FAO and from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). During the past year, an increasing need was felt for co-operation in this particular field as well as in the matter of education, training and health. There has also been an increasing need for the advice of UNDP experts in the field, particularly when new problems arose and solutions had to be worked out at short notice on the spot. Useful contacts are maintained with the resident representatives in many areas of operation of UNHCR and bilateral consultations are conducted on an increasing scale between UNHCR and some of the specialized agencies including, in particular, the ILO, FAO and UNESCO. Close links are also maintained with WHO, UNDP, UNICEF and UNRWA. With regard to practical co-operation in the field, special mention should be made of the World Food Programme which has made a most important contribution to the work of UNHCR by providing large-scale food supplies for thousands of refugees in Burundi, the Central African Republic and the United Republic of Tanzania, and has shown its readiness to continue to provide this indispensable support for the work of UNHCR in these and other areas.\n\n16. The Office has also further developed its contacts with members of the United Nations family through participation in the Administrative Committee on Co-ordination, its Preparatory Committee, its Special Committee on Education and Training and its Working Party on Rural and Community Development, where the Office was able to indicate its particular requirements in these specific fields. The Office has, as heretofore, participated in the meetings of the Consultative Committee on Public Information, which are particularly important in the co-ordination of United Nations public information activities for the benefit of refugees.\n\n17. As indicated in the interim report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Development Decade, the work of UNHCR, though limited to a specific sector, forms part of the over-all United Nations effort in the field of development. It is hoped that the increasing co-operation of members of the United Nations family, particularly in the humanitarian, economic and social field, will contribute to alleviate the plight of refugees and to ease the burden of Governments which have generously granted them asylum.\n\n18. On the occasion of International Co-operation Year, a special effort was also made in furthering the close relations which had already been established between UNHCR and a number of inter-governmental organizations interested in the work of assistance for refugees. As heretofore, ICEM continued to play its important role in the resettlement of refugees through migration to countries where they can establish themselves on a permanent basis. That organization has also been associated with the fund-raising scheme launched by UNHCR under the motto \"Greetings from the skies\", with a view to financing the transportation of refugees. Details of the scheme are given in chapter IV below.\n\n19. The Office continued to receive solid support for its work from the Council of Europe, which actively promotes improvements in the status of refugees in its member countries. Consultations between UNHCR and OECD have continued on the freedom or circulation of refugees taking up employment in other countries. This subject, as well as a number of other legal problems affecting refugees in European countries, have also been considered by a Working Group established by the Commission of EEC and UNHCR. Relations were also established between UNHCR and the International Committee on Civil Status (Commission internacionale de l'état civil), which was set up to co-ordinate administrative practices concerning personal status, in force in various European countries.\n\n20. The Organization of African Unity continued to show its close interest in the status of refugees and considered further action with a view to drawing up of a convention relating to the status of refugees in Africa, as explained in more detail in chapter II below. Its support of the work of UNHCR is of great importance for the activities of the Office in Africa. Close relations continued to be maintained between the Office and the Afro-Asian Legal Consultative Committee which takes a continuing interest in basic principles concerning the treatment of refugees. The Organization of American States, which had already devoted attention to the particular problems of the right of asylum, was also brought into relationship with the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme at its thirteenth session.\n\n21. The joint efforts of members of the United Nations family and other organizations which co-operate with UNHCR are gradually leading to improvements in the position of refugees in many parts of the world. In accordance with its role, which is essentially promotional, the Office will need to rely more and more on the willing co-operation of these organizations in order to be able to deal effectively with the new problems which it is facing.\n\nD. Relations with voluntary agencies and other non-governmental organizations working for refugees\n\n22. The role of the non-governmental organizations continued to be of vital importance in providing assistance to refugees. The gradual shift in emphasis from major aid programmes for assistance to \"old\" European refugees to the various new problems which have emerged on an increasing scale during 1965, has also been reflected in the work of the non-governmental organizations concerned with refugees. Considerable attention to new refugee problems, particularly those which come within the sphere of development aid, was devoted by the International Council of Voluntary Agencies and its General Conference. The Council now groups over eighty-five organizations interested in refugees, migration and development. Members of the Council as well as other voluntary agencies continue to implement a number of projects which form part of the UNHCR programmes. An increasing number of agencies have appointed representatives or established offices in areas where new problems of refugees have arisen in Africa and Asia. The Red Cross continues to be important in certain areas. In several countries, the emergence of a refugee problem gave rise to the establishment of a National Red Cross Society, which is instrumental in implementing assistance programmes for refugees and is also in a position to devote attention to the local population.\n\n23. In many countries which admit considerable numbers of refugees of refugees for permanent settlement, the voluntary agencies interested in refugees and migration are grouped in a Central Committee which acts as a co-ordinator and provides a valuable link between UNHCR and the other organizations concerned. During 1966, a number of European agencies have begun a special effort in raising funds for refugees. They have established a Working Group to prepare for a special fund-raising campaign to be launched in October 1966, as explained in more detail in the chapter on administrative and financial questions (chapter IV below).\n\n24. The non-governmental organizations constitute an invaluable intermediary between the thousands of people who wish to contribute to a humanitarian cause and help the refugees in need. In doing so they not only participate in the work of assistance but they also supplement the limited resources available so that the refugees may receive greater individual attention and a little more than bare subsistence. A list of non-governmental organizations and voluntary agencies which are implementing UNHCR programmes of assistance for refugees, or contributing financially or otherwise to the UNHCR programmes, are listed in annex VIII to the present report.\n\nE. Award of the Nansen Medal for 1965\n\n25. The Nansen Medal for 1965 was awarded to Mrs. Lucie Chevalley of France in recognition of the exceptional service she has rendered to the cause of refugees in France and in a number of other European countries during the past forty-five years. In 1921 she founded the Service social d'aide aux emigrants which under her direction, developed into a large agency and one of the main channels for international assistance to refugees in France. Mrs. Chevalley is still a member of the Council of the Office français pour les réfugiés et les apatrides, the French body which deals with the protection of refugees and stateless persons, and actively participates in meetings to promote solutions for handicapped refugees in France.\n\n26. The Nansen Medal Award Committee also made two posthumous awards in 1965 to Mrs. Ana Rosa de Martinez Guerrero of Argentina and Mr. Jorgen Norredam of Denmark. Mrs. de Martinez Guerrero, until her death in 1964, was associated with many charitable societies and institutions and was a staunch supporter of human rights. She promoted the establishment of a home for aged refugees in Buenos Aires, and her example has led to a growing awareness of the problem of refugees in Argentina and beyond.\n\n27. Mr. Jorgen Norredam rendered dedicated service to refugees in Europe, North, Central and East Africa for many years. In 1965, he lost his life in an air crash in the United Republic of Tanzania where he was directing a programme for the settlement of 3,000 Rwandese refugees in the Mwesi highlands.\n\nCHAPTER II INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION\n\nA. General observations\n\n28. The exercise of the Office's basic function of international protection has continued undiminished in the many areas of the world where it has been carried out during previous years. It has also been extended to those areas where new refugee situations have arisen.\n\n29. The General Assembly, in its resolution 2039 (XX) of 7 December 1965, recognized the increasingly universal character of the refugee problem. It invited Member States to increase their support of the humanitarian action of the Office, and to continue to co-operate in this respect with the High Commissioner, who was requested to pursue his efforts with a view to ensuring adequate international protection of the various groups of refugees within his competence.\n\n30. The Office has endeavoured, within the limitation of its resources, to expand its protection work, particularly with regard to refugees in Africa. In recent years numerous States in Africa have acceded to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, the chief legal instrument for the protection of refugees. Eighteen African States, out of a total of forty-nine, are now parties to the Convention whose application is supervised by the High Commissioner. The Organization of African Unity, at its Conference of Heads of Sate and Government held at Accra in October 1965, specifically requested its member States, if they had not already done so, to ratify the Convention and, meanwhile, to apply its provisions to refugees in Africa.\n\n31. The Office has continued to fulfil its function of promoting the accession to and following up the application of other relevant international instruments which deal primarily with refugees, or contain specific provisions for their benefit. At the request of Governments, the Office has also provided expert advice in assisting Governments in the implementation of the 1951 Convention. It is the continuing task of the Office to strive for the improvement of the status of refugees by encouraging the adoption or amendment of appropriate legislative or administrative measures on the national level. In particular, the drafting of new legislation, the establishment of administrative procedures and the documentation required by refugees have been the subject of discussions between newly independent States and the Office, and Governments, in general, have sought the Office's advice on the revision of existing legislation affecting refugees. In order to facilitate refugee travel, UNHCR has also assisted in the preparation and issuance of uniform travel documents according to the 1951 Convention.\n\n32. As explained below, UNHCR has made efforts to promote action by States to extend the personal scope of the Convention, which is at present limited to persons who became refugees as a result of events occurring before 1 January 1951. A recommendation to this effect had been made by a Colloquium on Legal Aspects of Refugee Problems held at Bellagio, Italy, in April 1965.\n\n33. As stated in chapter I above, close co-operation has been maintained with inter-governmental organizations to ensure that the principles established by the United Nations for the treatment of refugees are adopted generally, and that, where possible, provisions for the adequate protection of refugees are incorporated in regional instruments such as those established under the auspices of the Council of Europe and the Organization of African Unity.\n\n34. The UNHCR legal assistance programme continues to form part of the current programme of the Office, and makes it possible to provide legal advice and aid to refugees in those cases where it cannot be obtained from any other source. The integration or resettlement of refugees has thus been facilitated and in certain cases problems have been solved through legal assistance without there being a need for other UNHCR action.\n\n35. As in previous years, this report can only highlight certain basic activities and developments in the field of protection. The Office has continued its day-to-day work of maintaining close contact with national authorities concerning legislative and administrative measures affecting refugees with a view to safeguarding their interests and improving their legal position. The Office also continues to deal with the protection problems of individual refugees. These can generally be solved with the co-operation of Governments, and frequently raise points of general importance requiring consultations between UNHCR and the authorities concerned.\n\nB. Inter-governmental legal instruments\n\n36. Inter-governmental legal instruments continued to constitute one of the main bases for the international protection of refugees and one of the important means through which their status could be improved in the sense of being brought as close as possible to that of the nationals of their country of residence or their particular problems overcome. The relevant intergovernmental legal instruments may be divided into those which directly and exclusively affect refugees, i.e., the 1951 Convention, the Agreement, signed at The Hague on 30 November 1957, relating to Refugee Seamen and the European Agreement of 20 April 1959 on the Abolition of Visas for Refugees, and those which include clauses relating to refugees or are otherwise of special benefit to refugees. Developments in respect of these legal instruments are given below.\n\n1951 CONVENTION RELATING TO THE STATUS OF REFUGEES\n\n37. At the end of March 1966, forty-nine States were parties to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.1 On 19 July 1965 the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Leopoldville) deposited its instrument of accession to the 1951 Convention with the Secretary-General. On 28 December 1965, the Republic of Guinea made a declaration to the Secretary-General that it considers itself bound by the Convention.\n\n38. In August 1965, UNHCR was informed that the Republic of Zambia considered itself bound by the 1951 Convention, as extended by the United Kingdom to Northern Rhodesia, as by all bilateral and multilateral treaties previously acceded to on its behalf by the United Kingdom. The Office is in contact with many Governments with a view to their acceding to the Convention, and accession is under active consideration in a number of other States.\n\n39. In order to promote the issuance of Convention travel documents by States which have recently become parties to the Convention, the Office has assisted in the preparation of uniform documents, to be delivered to persons who qualify for them under the terms of the Convention or, under recommendation E, to persons who may be excluded in view of the date-line, pending measures to extend the latter.\n\n40. In the High Commissioner's report to the twentieth session of the General Assembly,2 reference was made to a Colloquium on Legal Aspects of Refugees Problems, held from 21 to 28 April 1965 at Bellagio, Italy, under the sponsorship of the Carnegie Endowment. The Colloquium recommended the adoption of a protocol whereby the scope of the 1951 Convention would be widened so as to include refugees at present not covered by its terms owing to the date-line of 1951. The High Commissioner is consulting Governments of States parties to the 1951 Convention and of States members of this Executive Committee regarding measures to extend the Convention's personal scope.\n\nAGREEMENT RELATING TO REFUGEE SEAMEN\n\n41. Through the application of The Hague Agreement relating to Refugee Seamen, to which fourteen States are now parties,3 a solution to the special problems of this group of refugees has been brought nearer. In co-operation with the Netherlands Government, the Office has continued to engage the services of a counsellor who interviews and advises refugee seamen calling at the Port of Rotterdam. Approximately 470 refugees were interviewed in 1965; the great majority have a country of asylum which they may enter although a certain proportion still have not obtained adequate documentation.\n\nEUROPEAN AGREEMENT ON THE ABOLITION OF VISAS FOR REFUGEES\n\n42. The Government of Italy acceded to the European Agreement on the Abolition of Visas for Refugees in June 1965. Italy is the ninth State4 to become a party to this Agreement. It provides that refugees holding \"1951 Convention\" or \"London\" travel documents may travel to the territories of other States which are parties to it, without the requirement of a visa, provided that their visits do not exceed three months and are not for the purpose of taking up employment.\n\nOTHER LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AFFECTING THE POSITION OF REFUGEES\n\n43. On 2 April 1965, Sweden ratified the 1954 United Nations Convention on the Status of Stateless Persons. Uganda did so on 15 April 1965. The Malagasy Republic denounced it on 2 April 1965. It is understood that this denunciation was made with the object of enabling the Malagasy Republic to re-accede to the Convention with certain reservations. As of 31 March 1966, seventeen States were parties to this Convention.5\n\n44. On 29 March 1966, the United Kingdom ratified the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, the first State to do so. The Convention requires six ratifications to enter into force. The Convention will benefit, inter alia, refugees by conferring a nationality at birth on certain persons who would otherwise be stateless.\n\n45. In September 1965, Austria acceded to the Convention of 4 September 1958 on Changes of Surname and First Name. France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Turkey are already parties to the Convention. According to its article 3, changes of name of nationals as well as of stateless persons and refugees resident in a Contracting State shall be effective in other Contracting States.\n\nC. Question of the right of asylum\n\n46. The right of asylum continues to be the cornerstone of the whole work of protection of refugees. As will be seen elsewhere in this report, new problems of refugees emerged in the course of 1965. It is gratifying for the High Commissioner to state that many Governments again gave proof of a liberal asylum policy and admitted considerable numbers of new refugees. The legal aspects of the right of asylum continue, however, to create serious problems. Developments in the context of international action may be summed up as follows.\n\nINTER-GOVERNMENTAL ACTION\n\n47. A draft Declaration on the right of Asylum has been before the General Assembly since its seventeenth session. It had previously been discussed by the Third Committee but, by decision of the General Committee will, in future be considered by Sixth Committee of General Assembly.\n\n48. In resolution 2100 (XX) of 20 December 1965 the General Assembly decided to take up the draft Declaration on Right of Asylum as soon as possible at its twenty-first session with a view to completing the text of the draft Declaration as a whole.\n\n49. Considerable interest in the right of asylum has been shown by the Consultative Assembly of the Council upon the Committee of Ministers to speed up the elaboration of a legal instrument designed to give full legal recognition to the practice of granting asylum in Member States. Pending the adoption of such an instrument, it also invited member Governments to practice a liberal asylum policy in respect of refugees, and to give a liberal interpretation to the concept of refugees, taking into account recommendation E of the Final Act of the Conference of Plenipotentiaries which adopted the 1951 Convention. The problem is under consideration by the Committee of Ministers, which transmitted in to a Committee of Experts on Human Rights for study.\n\n50. The Office was represented by an observer at a Colloquium on the European Convention of Human Rights, held at Vienna in October 1965 under the aegis of the Council of Europe. The UNHCR observer also acted as a representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and submitted a paper on the right of asylum within the context of protection of human rights in regional and municipal law.\n\nCOUNTRY-BY-COUNTRY ACTION\n\n51. An Advisory Council on Asylum (\"Asylbeirat\") was established in Austria. It met for the first time at Vienna on 22 September 1965. This Council, scheduled to meet at monthly intervals or whenever necessary, advise the Austrian Minister of the Interior on questions concerning asylum policy and eligibility. It consists of representatives of the Ministries for Foreign Affairs, of Justice, and of Social Affairs, several members of Parliament, and the representative of UNHCR in Austria.\n\n52. In Denmark, there have been consultations between UNHCR and the authorities on the granting of asylum and the treatment of asylum seekers. A means of co-operation in connexion with the determination of refugee status is being sought.\n\n53. The new United States Immigration Law, passed by Congress on 30 September 1965 and signed by President Johnson on 3 October 1965, includes the following revised provision dealing with protection against the deportation of persons to their country of origin:\n\n\"The Attorney General is authorized to withhold deportation of any alien within the United States to any country in which in his opinion the alien would be subject to persecution for reasons of race, religion or political opinion and for such period of time as he deems to be necessary for such reason\" (section 243 (H)).\n\nThis revision brings the United States law with respect to measures of protection against deportation more into accord with the internationally accepted phraseology of the 1951 Convention and the Statute of the Office of UNHCR.\n\nD. Recognition of refugee status\n\n54. The Office of UNHCR has continued to co-operate with Governments on this question, under procedures which vary from country to country, in determining which persons are entitled to be considered as refugees according to the definition of the 1951 Convention. In some countries, UNHCR participates in the procedure, or is itself entrusted with the determination of refugee status. In others, UNHCR acts in an advisory capacity or as an observer. During 1965, some 10,500 persons were recognized as refugees in these countries.\n\n55. The Office also continued, when necessary, to examine and certify the refugee status according to its statute of persons seeking admission to the United States under the provisions of Public Law 86,648 while that law remained in force. Under the new United States Immigration Law, certification of status under the mandate of UNHCR is no longer required. The Office has also examined and certified refugee status for other resettlement programmes.\n\nE. National Legislation and Bilateral Agreements especially affecting refugees\n\n56. As hitherto the Office of the High Commissioner has encouraged Governments to adopt legislative or administrative measures of benefit to refugees or to insert clauses in existing laws, taking the interest of refugees into account. Action was taken accordingly in several countries as explained below.\n\n57. In Austria, the new Nationality Act, adopted in July 1965, and due to come into force in July 1966, contains a number of provisions specifically favourable to refugees. Thus, while the normal period of residence to qualify for naturalization has been increased from four to ten years, it may be reduced to four years for persons considered refugees under the 1951 Convention. Moreover, the fact that an applicant for naturalization is a refugee under the terms of the 1951 Convention, is to be given special consideration by the authorities dealing with the application. Lastly, refugees applying for naturalization are expressly exempted from the normal requirement of submitting proof of loss of former nationality.\n\n58. A new aliens law in the Federal Republic of Germany was mentioned in the High Commissioner's last report to the General Assembly. It entered into force on 1 October 1965, and UNHCR is being consulted with regard to the implementing ordinance of this law. In particular, UNHCR is seeking to ensure that under this ordinance all asylum seekers in the Federal Republic are given an opportunity to have their applications decided upon by the competent authorities at the federal level, and to promote the resettlement of those asylum seekers who are not permitted to remain in the Federal Republic.\n\n59. In Italy, the Ministry of Public Education has agreed that refugee students may now benefit from scholarships granted by the Ministry on the same conditions as Italian nationals.\n\n60. In the United Republic of Tanzania, a Refugee (Control) Act was passed by Parliament in 1965. It provides for the control of entry, residence and deportation of refugees as well as of access to the areas where they live.\n\n61. Bilateral agreements have been concluded and have entered into force between the Federal Republic of Germany and Switzerland, and between the Federal Republic of Germany and Turkey, on the subject of social security. Each of these agreements contains a protocol according to which the Agreement shall apply, in general, to persons considered as refugees according to the 1951 Convention and normally resident in the territory of one of the Contracting States.\n\nF. Improvement of the rights of refugees within the framework of regional legal instruments\n\nORGANIZATION OF AFRICAN UNITY: DRAFT CONVENTION RELATING TO THE STATUS OF REFUGEES IN AFRICA\n\n62. During 1965, further discussions concerning a draft Convention relating to the Status of Refugees in Africa took place within the Organization of African Unity. The Committee of Legal Experts of the countries of the OAU Commission on Refugees met at Leopoldville in July 1965 to examine the draft Conventions previously submitted to the Council of Ministers of the OAU when it met at Nairobi in March 1965. The Committee of Legal Experts amended this draft text, and subsequently presented its new draft to the OAU Council of Ministers at its Accra meeting in October 1965. The OAU Council of Ministers did not adopt this draft text, but unanimously adopted a resolution which, inter alia, requested those member States of the OAU who had not already done so to accede to the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951 and, in the meantime, to apply its provisions to refugees in Africa.\n\n63. The meeting of the OAU Council of Ministers was immediately followed by a meeting of Heads of State and Government of the OAU. A resolution on the problem of refugees in Africa was adopted on 24 October 1965 which, in terms generally similar to those of the Council of Ministers, expressed appreciation for the assistance provided UNHCR, and requested OAU members to ratify the 1951 Convention relating to refugees and, meanwhile, to apply its provisions. At the same time, member States of the OAU Commission on Refugees were requested to provide legal experts at the highest possible level to re-examine the draft Convention on refugees in Africa, with due regard to the views expressed at Accra.\n\n64. The OAU Heads of State and Government also adopted a Declaration on the Problem of Subversion, which also refers to refugees. The OAU Heads of State and Government pledged themselves not to tolerate subversion against member States and to oppose it in every possible way. Moreover, they resolved strictly to observe the principles of international law with regard to political refugees who were nationals of any OAU member State; to seek to promote the return home of refugees with their consent and that of their countries of origin; and to continue to guarantee the safety of political refugees coming from non-independent territories in Africa.\n\nCOUNCIL OF EUROPE\n\n65. The Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe had already adopted resolution 213 in 1961 on the improvement of the status of refugees in the framework of European integration. At its October 1965 session, it adopted recommendation 435 to the effect that the Committee of Ministers would invite Governments of member countries to incorporate, in agreements and conventions concluded or to be concluded in the context of European organizations, clauses to permit refugees within the mandate of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and lawfully resident in the territory of contracting parties to these instruments to benefit from the facilities granted to nationals of other contracting parties under these instruments.\n\nEUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY\n\n66. A Working Group, comprising representatives of the Commissions of EEC and UNHCR, discussed various problems connected with the participation of refugees resident in States members of EEC in measures of European integration.\n\nORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES\n\n67. The Office was represented at a meeting of the Human Rights Commission of OAS held at Washington, D. C., on 11 and 12 October 1965, when the situation of refugees in the American Hemisphere was discussed. Recommendations were adopted concerning the issuing of travel documents to refugees, and the extension of the scope of the 1951 Convention.\n\nCOMMISSION INTERNATIONALE DE L'ETAT CIVIL\n\n68. A meeting of the Commission interationale de l'état civil was held at Vienna in September 1965, at which ten European countries were represented. The meeting was also attended by a member of the UNHCR Legal Division. The Commission will examine to what extent it could usefully act in favour of refugees, more especially concerning the implementation of articles 12 and 25 of the 1951 Convention. It decided to invite UNHCR to be represented by an observer at its future meetings.\n\nG. Indemnification by the Federal Republic of Germany\n\nINDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT OF 5 OCTOBER 1960 UNHCR Indemnification Fund\n\n69. As previously reported to the General Assembly, the UNHCR Indemnification Fund was closed on 30 September 1964. Final payments from the Fund were effected during the last quarter of 1964. A small reserve was maintained, however, to enable the High Commissioner to make payments in cases where appeals lodged by the applicants proved to be successful, as well as to cover the few outstanding cases. Some further payments have thus been made. By 31 March 1966 nearly $US 12 million had been paid to applicants out of the UNHCR Indemnification Fund. Payments totalling a further $US 20,000 had been approved and were in the process of being completed at that date. Payments made correspond to some 12,500 positive decisions out of a total of over 40,000 applications. A total of 3,652 appeals against negative decisions had been received by 31 March 1966; 150 of these were still being processed at that time.\n\nArticle I of the Indemnification Agreement\n\n70. As of 31 March 1966, the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany had received a total of 23,500 applications under article I of the 1960 Agreement, of which 3,943 had been settled at that date. The number of positive decisions taken was 1,023, and payments amounting to approximately DM44 million had been made. In accordance with paragraph 3 of the protocol to the Agreement, UNHCR has continued its consultations with the German authorities and has endeavoured to achieve speedier decisions on these applications, as well as to solve certain questions which have arisen concerning the qualification of former forced labourers and alleged members of resistance groups to receive indemnification.\n\nFINAL INDEMNIFICATION LEGISLATION\n\n71. The Final Indemnification Law was promulgated in the Federal Republic of Germany on 18 September 1965. The law provides, inter alia, for the establishment of a fund in an amount of DM1.2 billion, to benefit those persons who were persecuted for reasons of race, religion or political opinion and who became refugees after 1 October 1953. The law also incorporates certain provisions of the Indemnification Agreement concluded on 5 October 1960 between UNHCR and the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany (see above), and provides for grants to those national persecutees who, thus far, did not benefit from the law because they did not have refugee status on 1 October 1953. Discussions between UNHCR and the German authorities have taken place with regard to measures of assistance for those national persecutees still not covered under the new legislation. The Office has since been informed by the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany that, because of budgetary considerations, no such measures can be considered for the time being, but it continues actively to follow up this matter.\n\nDEFERMENT OF INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENTS\n\n72. A law for the safeguarding of the German budget (Haushaltssicherungsgesetz) was adopted in the Federal Republic of Germany in December 1965. It reduces the amount of certain payments to be made under the German Indemnification Law in the years 1966 and 1967. This decision gave rise to concern on the part of various organizations, and UNHCR has appealed against this reduction. Although full exemption of indemnification payments from this law has not been granted, payments up to DM5,000 have excluded from these measures. Furthermore, payments to persons who have reached the age of sixty-five will be made in full. Current pension payments are not affected.\n\nCHAPTER III MATERIAL ASSISTANCE TO REFUGEES\n\nA. General observations\n\n73. The UNHCR programmes for material assistance to refugees have again proved to be an indispensable corollary to its basic function of international protection. In Africa there was a further influx of refugees in several countries which had already admitted a considerable number of them and new problems emerged in another three countries, so that in the course of 1965, the total number of African refugees had gone up to 575,000. While the number of non-settled \"old\" European refugees continued to diminish as a result of the implementation of the major aid programmes, there was a slight increase in the number of new asylum seekers in Europe.\n\n74. In the light of these developments, the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme, at its fourteenth session, held in October 1965, decided to adopt a financial target of $3.9 million for the 1966 programme as against the $3.5 million target set for the 1965 programme.\n\n75. In the course of 1965, UNHCR put into effect and partly completed current material assistance projects in a value of over $7 million, in addition to projects included in the last major aid programmes for \"old\" European refugees still under implementation. Nearly half the current projects were financed under the UNHCR current programmes, its emergency fund and trust funds (see annexes III and IV). They benefited a total of over 240,000 refugees as against 175,000 in 1964, the majority, i.e. nearly 210,000, in Africa, where the proportion of refugees assisted constitutes a much higher percentage of the over-all refugee population than in other areas (see annex II).\n\n76. In accordance with the policy whereby the country of asylum has a primary responsibility for assistance to refugees, supporting contributions in a total amount of over $3.5 million were made available from within these countries and from other sources. This amount does not include a certain number of items, the value of which cannot easily be assessed, such as social security benefits, agricultural land, emergency relief and other types of assistance given by governmental or local authorities in certain cases. In addition, large scale bilateral aid was provided by Governments, in particular a substantial part of the food donated by the United States.\n\n77. As previously, contributions were made by Governments, as well as by the non-governmental sector, for essential assistance projects outside the current programme. The total amount of these funds, referred to as trust funds for operations outside the programme, committed in 1965, was close to $560,000 (see annex IV).\n\n78. There has been no fundamental change in the types of solutions provided under the programmes, i.e. voluntary repatriation, resettlement and integration. The fluctuating and often unpredictable character of the problems of refugees was reflected by the fact that a number of those whose repatriation had been anticipated indicated their desire to establish themselves in the countries to which they had been admitted, whereas an important number of others opted for voluntary repatriation.\n\n79. In accordance with the provisions of its statute, UNHCR sought to facilitate the voluntary repatriation of refugees wherever possible, and whenever its attention was drawn to the desire of refugees to return to their homeland. According to information received from various areas of operation, the number of those repatriated in the course of 1965 was in the region of 30,000, the great majority of whom returned to their homelands in Africa. As indicated in more detail in annex II to the present report, a total of 1,271 refugees were thus assisted by UNHCR at a cost of over $21,000.\n\n80. Resettlement through migration in other countries continued to play essential role, particularly in countries of first asylum where the demographic situation is such that new arrivals cannot easily be absorbed into the local economy. The liberal and generous attitude of a number of immigration countries has contributed to easing the burden of those countries which, in accordance with their traditional asylum policy, are called upon to admit new refugees.\n\n81. The settlement of refugees through local integration in their country of asylum or residence has again proved to be the only solution for the great majority of refugees, during the period under review. One of the basic principles of international assistance to refugees, whereby should be \"helped to help themselves\", continued to be applied wherever possible. In several areas of maximum impact of UNHCR programmes in Africa and Asia, a new pattern is gradually emerging. The new problems of refugees and the unpredictable occurrence of natural phenomena, such as droughts and storms, made it necessary at time to provide emergency relief for certain groups. The main trend of the programmes, however, has been to help the refugees to become self-supporting as rapidly as possible. Progress is also being made in areas where programmes have been put into effect only in recent years, such as Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Macao, Nepal, the United Republic of Tanzania and Uganda. In Africa experience has shown that even after the first few harvests, the position of the refugees remains precarious unless they are given an opportunity to undertake additional agricultural activities which may make the difference between a bare subsistence level and a reasonable standard of living. A major problem, also in Africa, stems from the fact that existing rural communities are usually not large enough to absorb newcomers. When a new group of refugees is being settled in agriculture this is usually tantamount to the establishment of a new rural community with all the infrastructure that this entails. It is becoming increasingly necessary, therefore, for refugee settlement areas to be included in more comprehensive development programmes, such as those which are envisaged by the United Nations Development Programme and some of the specialized agencies of the United Nations.\n\n82. Another significant aspect of the settlement of refugees in Africa is the need for educational assistance, to which UNHCR has been called upon to devote more and more attention in close consultation with UNESCO.\n\n83. While the emphasis was fully placed on the achieving of permanent solutions, the provision of emergency or supplementary aid to refugees in need continued to be required on a limited scale. As indicated in more detail in annexes II and III, a total number of 26,772 refugees benefited from these forms of assistance at a total cost of some $105,000 to UNHCR while special contributions for this purpose were made available in the form of special trust funds in an amount of some $28,700.\n\n84. Legal assistance also proved a constructive element in facilitating the permanent settlement of refugees, particularly in certain areas where their establishment is closely bound up with their legal and administrative position in the country. In the course of 1965, a total of 5,719 refugees benefited from this form of assistance at a cost of some $96,400 to UNHCR.\n\n85. Although good over-all progress was made during the period under review, it is clear that further measures of assistance will be required in order to consolidate the results achieved and to assist Governments in dealing with the new refugee problems with which they are confronted. The Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme has accordingly adopted financial target in an amount of $3.9 million for the UNHCR current programme for 1966. The allocations adopted within the programme, and those which will be submitted to the Committee for consideration at its fifteenth session, are given in annex V below. The decisions taken by the Committee on these proposed allocations and on the corresponding modifications in the financial target of the 1966 programme may be found in the report on the fifteenth session of the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme.\n\nB. African refugees\n\nRWANDESE REFUGEES IN BURUNDI\n\n86. The number of refugees from Rwanda in Burundi, which had increased to between 55,000 and 60,000 by the beginning of 1965, decreased by some 6,500 during that year, 4,500 of whom returned to Rwanda and some 2,000 crossed the eastern border of Burundi. Taking into account demographic changes occurring in 1965, their number at the end of that year was estimated at 52,000 including 46,000 in the settlements at Kayongozi, Kigamba and Muramba and in the new settlement at Mugera, and 6,000 scattered throughout the country, a number of whom were expected to move to Mugera during the early part of 1966.\n\n87. In spite of the difficulties which faced Burundi in the course of 1965, it proved possible to continue and intensity the work of assistance to refugees through the concerted efforts of the Burundi authorities, the Fonds Roi Mwambutsa IV, the Association internationale pour le développement rural outre mer (AIDR), the ILO, FAO, the World Food Programme and several voluntary agencies.\n\n88. A number of projects within the 1963 and 1964 programmes, amounting to $130,000 mainly for local settlement and emergency relief, were completed in the course of 1965. In addition, a total amount of over $815,000 was committed under the 1965 programme and from the Emergency Fund, largely for the local settlement of refugees in agriculture in Mugera and towards the ILO/FAO project to consolidate the establishment of the refugees already settled in Kayongozi, Kigamba and Muramba. Some 21,000 refugees are benefiting from the latter project and 25,000 from that in Mugera.\n\n89. Approximately 4,500 refugees opted for voluntary repatriation in 1965, of whom 4,000 returned to their homelands through their own means. In addition, 345 cases, comprising 925 persons, applied for financial aid towards their repatriation. At a cost of some $800, UNHCR assisted in their voluntary repatriation 188 cases, comprising 435 persons, whose repatriation had so far been accepted by the Rwandese Government.\n\n90. As in several other parts of Africa, the exceptional drought which occurred in the autumn of 1965 resulted in a bad harvest. To combat the ensuing malnutrition which affected the refugees and local population alike, additional food and seeds were made available through UNHCR. These measures were financed from special contributions made for this purpose. By the end the year, the situation had notably improved.\n\n91. A number of measures were taken under the ILO/FAO integration and zonal development project at Kayongozi, Kigamba and Muramba, towards which $160,000 was contributed by UNHCR under its 1965 programme. These included the establishment of a vocational training centre, the draining of marshland and the creation of a pilot farm. Medical and educational assistance was also provided at a cost of $15,000 to the programme through the establishment of dispensaries and primary schools, the running of which was subsequently taken over by the Government.\n\n92. The other major project concerns the settlement of some 25,000 refugees in Mugera, in the eastern part of Burundi which, as explained in paragraphs 84 and 85 of the High Commissioner's report to the General Assembly at its twentieth session, was chiefly intended to assist the considerable number of Rwandese refugees who had arrived in 1964 and for whom there was no room in the settlements at Kayongozi, Kigamba and Muramba. Under a tripartite agreement between UNHCR, the Fonds Roi Mwambutsa IV, designated as implementing agency by the Burundi Government, and the AIDR acting as financial trustee of UNHCR, a settlement programme involving a UNHCR contribution of $617,000 was put into effect in 1965.\n\n93. The vast area of Mugera was originally populated by only some 5,000 Burundi. By the end of 1965, 25,000 refugees had settled in the area in sixty-two new villages and had received two hectares of land per family. It was necessary at the same time to establish a basic infrastructure, including access roads, clearance of marshland, and construction of water pipelines to provide the refugees with food and other basic necessities pending their settlement on the land. The allocation of $617,000 is as follows:\n\n$Transportation of refugees to the settlement67,000Emergency relief, including accommodation basic, necessities and medical assistance41,000Transport and local purchase of food305,000Basic infra-structure, including access roads water supply and eradication of tsetse fly63,000Purchase and maintenance of vehicles64,500Settlement in agriculture and cattle breeding40,500Miscellaneous expenditure30,000\n\n94. The World Food Programme made a major contribution to the programme by pledging some 7,000 tons of food valued at $1.6 million for the initial settlement phase in 1965/1966. Difficulties resulting from the unavoidable delay in the initial supply of this food were overcome through a loan of maize by the Burundi Government and local purchases. The above-mentioned amount of $305,000 was allocated for these local purchases and for the transportation of the food, for which the World Food Programme does not assume financial responsibility.\n\n95. A water pipeline 20 km long was completed. Some 70 km of access roads were built and extensive surveys were conducted with a view to clearing a considerable surface of marshland in 1966. Good results have been obtained in the eradication of the tsetse fly through air and ground operations - a prerequisite for the settlement of 3,000 refugees and their cattle. A medical centre, a field laboratory, a dispensary and other medical facilities were provided through the concerted efforts of the Burundi Red Cross and the League of Red Cross Societies, which made available the services of a doctor and medical assistance. A limited amount of educational assistance was also given in the frame of the Mugera project which made it possible to build simple elementary schools for some 2,900 children.\n\n96. Special contributions amounting to nearly $16,000 were received by UNHCR during 1965 for the benefit of Rwandese refugees throughout Burundi. They include over $12,200 which were used to promote secondary school and university education in the academic year 1965/1966, and $3,600 for various other types of educational assistance.\n\n97. Supplementary aid on a limited scale was provided for some 900 needy Rwandese refugees living outside settlements.\n\n98. In 1966 emphasis will be placed on increasing agricultural output in the settlements of Kayongozi, Kigamba and Muramba and on completing the infrastructure of the Mugera settlement as well as further measures for establishment of the refugees in agriculture. Assistance from UNHCR will be required on a scale similar to that in 1965 for the facilitation of individual voluntary repatriation, educational assistance and the provision of supplementary aid.\n\n99. An allocation of $600,000 has been provided in the UNHCR current programme for 1966 by the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme at its fourteenth session, which includes $570,000 for the Mugera settlement.\n\nRWANDESE REFUGEES IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO\n\n100. In the course of 1965, the number of refugees from Rwanda in the North and Central Kivu Provinces of the Congo further decreased from 28,000 to an approximate 25,000 as a result of voluntary repatriation and of the resettlement of 1,700 refugees in Tanzania. In addition to projects amounting to some $210,000 from previous programmes, which were largely completed during 1965, an amount of some $79,000 was committed under the UNHCR programme for 1965, mainly with a view to consolidating the agricultural settlement of the refugees.\n\n101. Of the estimated number of over 1,000 refugees who opted for voluntary repatriation, 278 were assisted, at a cost of $1,275 to the programme, in returning to their home country. Through the generosity of the Tanzania authorities, a further 1,700 Rwandese refugees in the Congo were admitted for resettlement in the Mwesi Highlands of Tanzania during May and June 1965. This brought to 3,000 the total number of refugees who were able to benefit from the airlift set up between Goma in the Congo and Mwesi. Arrangements for their movement were made by UNHCR with the participation of the Tanzania authorities and the Congolese Red Cross Society.\n\n102. The general situation of the Rwandese refugees remaining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo further improved during 1965. Pending the revocation of the expulsion and sequestration decrees, the ILO Integration and Zonal Development Project was maintained in the form of a holding operation mainly with a view to safeguarding the results already achieved in consolidating the rural establishment of some 10,000 refugees. An amount of $78,000 was committed under the UNHCR programme for this purpose.\n\n103. Emergency relief was provided by the High Commissioner in 1965 at a cost of $14,000 to assist those Rwandese refugees in the Kivu provinces whose situation became very precarious following a severe famine in 1964 and devastating storms in March 1965.\n\n104. The refugees also benefited from various projects for education and training, financed from special contributions, in an amount of $14,000.\n\n105. An allocation of $50,000 was included in the 1966 programme to consolidate the settlement of Rwandese refugees in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to consolidate the position of some 3,000 other Rwandese refugees who are living in difficult circumstances on the island of Idjwi in Lake Kivu. Modest educational facilities must also be continued during 1966 as well as supplementary aid for a limited number of individual cases, until a permanent solution has been found to their problems.\n\nRWANDESE REFUGEES IN TANZANIA\n\n106. The number of Rwandese refugees in Tanzania, which amounted to 13,300 at the beginning of 1965, was increased by the admission of a further 1,700 resettled from the Kivu provinces of the Congo in the Mwesi Highlands. At the same time, approximately 1,000 opted for voluntary repatriation, so that at the end of 1965, their number in Tanzania was approximately 14,000, of whom 3,000 were in the Mwesi Highlands, 7,000-8,000 at Muyenzi, 2,000 at Karagwe and an estimated 2,000 were living outside settlements.\n\n107. During 1965, projects from previous programmes, amounting to $165,000, mainly for establishment assistance, were completed. In addition, an amount of $100,000 was committed under the 1965 programme and also for the rural establishment of the 3,000 refugees in the Mwesi Highlands and for the consolidation of the rural settlements at Karagwe and Muyenzi. Whereas the refugees at Karagwe can now be considered as adequately established, the 6,000 at Muyenzi suffered a setback through a bad harvest and were in need of emergency food which was made available by the Would Food Programme and Lutheran World Federation/Tanganyika Christian Refugee Service (LWF/TCRS).\n\n108. In the Mwesi Highlands, satisfactory progress has been made in settling the Rwandese refugees with the active co-operation of the LWF/TCRS.\n\n109. The High Commissioner would like to pay special tribute to the memory of the former programme co-ordinator of LWF/TCRS, Mr. Jorgen Norredam, who lost his life in an air crash at Mwesi at the beginning of 1965.\n\n110. Pending their harvest, the refugees received food rations, most of the food being donated by the United States Government. Sufficiently favourable progress has since been made to justify the expectation that food rations may be decreased in 1966.\n\n111. The refugees, many of whom were undernourished on arrival, recovered extremely well with the help of the LWF/TCRS which arranged for medical care in accordance with the provisions of the programme. They were also provided with educational facilities whereby eight teachers gave tuition to 377 pupils. In addition, the refugees took the initiative of establishing a school of their own, nine teachers having volunteered to give lessons to some 300 pupils.\n\n112. Further assistance will be required under the 1966 programme in order to enable the refugees in the Mwesi Highlands to become self-supporting and also to consolidate the settlement of the refugees in Muyenzi. A 1966 allocation of $160,000 has accordingly been approved by the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme for this purpose.\n\nRWANDESE REFUGEES IN UGANDA\n\n113. Uganda has become one of the countries harbouring the largest number of Rwandese refugees, i.e., some 67,000 at the beginning of 1965; a figure which had grown to 69,000 by the end of 1965. Of these refugees 32,000 found relatives and friends who offered them hospitality and gave them an opportunity to settle among them. The other 37,000, who are scattered over the Ankole, Toro and Bunyoro districts in Western Uganda, receive international assistance. Like other Rwandese refugees, most of them are settling in agriculture; some 6,000 who arrived in Uganda with 10,000 head of cattle are being assisted in cattle breeding.\n\n114. During 1965 settlement projects from previous programmes in an amount of $307,000 were continued and to a large extent completed. As outlined in paragraph 93 of the last report to the General Assembly, these projects are intended mainly to consolidate the rural establishment of refugees in the Ankole and Toro districts, through such measures as the establishment of a clinic, the improvement of the water system and the eradication of the tsetse fly.\n\n115. An amount of $110,000 was committed under the 1965 programme, including $80,000 to further the establishment of Rwandese refugees on the land in Toro and Bunyoro and $30,000 to consolidate existing settlements. Educational facilities were provided on a limited scale from special trust funds.\n\n116. Speaking more generally, the rapid increase in the number of refugees in Uganda has necessarily affected the work of assistance for those who were already in the country. The Government has had to review constantly the measures to be taken in favour of the refugees. In this connexion, it has requested the International labour Organisation to carry out a three months' planning mission to study the possibility of a zonal integration and development project to assist refugees and the local population living in adjacent areas.\n\n117. A task still lies ahead to make the Rwandese refugees in Uganda self-supporting and an allocation of $60,000 was accordingly included in the 1966 programme by the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme at its fourteenth session.\n\nSUDANESE REFUGEES IN THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC\n\n118. At the end of 1964, there were some 300 Sudanese refugees in the area of Obo in the eastern part of the Central African Republic. There was a further influx of refugees during the second part of 1965 and by the end of the year their number had increased to some 18,000, who were located mostly in the Banbouti area, also in the eastern part of the country.\n\n119. An amount of $14,000 was allocated under the 1964 current programme, to provide emergency relief and initial assistance to enable the first group of 300 Sudanese refugees to settle on the land. Implementation of a project was started at the end of 1964. It was hampered by the great distance between Obo and the nearest supply centres and by problems of communication. Added to these difficulties was the fact that some of the refugees did not have an agricultural background. A solution to the problem is being worked out in consultation with implementing voluntary agency.\n\n120. The new arrivals in the Banbouti area found it easier to adapt themselves, as they moved into a familiar tribal pattern with the same language. Furthermore, most of them were farmers by profession. The local authorities, assisted by the Government, provided land, equipment and materials to enable the refugees to build their own accommodation and start work on the land. In November 1965, the Government of the Central African Republic requested the High Commissioner to assist in its efforts to find a solution to the problems of these refugees, for whom both emergency measures, particularly as regards the provision of food and medical assistance and further effort towards settlement were required. In response to this request, the High Commissioner made available an amount of $50,000 from his Emergency Fund and agreed to underwrite a further $40,000 for initial basic assistance projects covering the period from January to April 1966.\n\n121. At the time of writing this report, a concerted international effort was being made towards developing a solution to the problem of these refugees with the participation of the host Government as well as the United States and a number of local and international voluntary agencies. Arrangements have been agreed in principle between the Office of the High Commissioner and the League of Red Cross Societies whereby the League would assume responsibility for the co-ordination of various activities under the assistance programme put into effect for these refugees.\n\n122. Plans for assistance to these refugees will be considered by the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme at its fifteenth session.\n\nSUDANESE REFUGEES IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO\n\n123. By the end of 1964 some 8,000 Sudanese had arrived in the provinces of Ueli and Kibali-Ituri in the northeastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. By the end of 1965 their number had grown to an estimated 20,000 and possibly more. As indicated by the observer from the Democratic Republic of the Congo at the fourteenth session of the Executive Committee, the Congolese Government might request the Office of the High Commissioner to assist in solving the problems of these refugees.\n\nSUDANESE REFUGEES IN UGANDA\n\n124. As of 1 January 1965, there were some 12,000 Sudanese refugees in Uganda located mainly in the Karamoja and Acholi districts. A new influx of Sudanese refugees occurred during 1965 when a further 28,000 were generously admitted by the Uganda authorities, so that by the end of the year, their number had grown to 40,000. It had been thought at one time that a certain number would return to their homeland but this has not so far materialized. Most of the newcomers were in need of immediate assistance, which was provided for them, as far as possible, by the local authorities.\n\n125. As regards the first group of 12,000 refugees, projects in an amount of some $324,000 under the 1964 programme and from the Emergency Fund for immediate relief and subsequent settlement in agriculture, were continued in 1965. Of the 12,000 refugees concerned, 4,500 were settled. The others left the settlement areas when they learned that most of their cattle would have to be slaughtered because they were suffering from a contagious disease. A further allocation of $218,000 was included in the 1965 programme for assistance to these refugees. Educational facilities were provided on a limited scale from special trust funds.\n\n126. Many of the 28,000 refugees who arrived in the course of 1965, are successfully settling in agriculture. With the help provided through the local authorities, some of these refugees have already become self-supporting.\n\n127. In view of the continuing influx of Sudanese refugees, the Government was obliged to review the assistance programme several times in the course of 1965. As soon as their reappraisal of the position is completed, further plans will be worked out for the establishment of the non-settled refugees among the Sudanese in Uganda.\n\nREFUGEES FROM ANGOLA\n\n128. The over 200,000 Angolans who had come to the Democratic Republic of the Congo before 1965 continued to settle in villages inhabited by related tribes. They benefited from assistance by voluntary agencies and from projects, mainly for medical and educational assistance, already included in previous UNHCR programmes.\n\n129. Under a $15,000 allocation in the UNHCR programme for 1965, some 10,000 Angolans were given farming equipment and seeds to assist them in settling on the land.\n\nREFUGEES FROM PORTUGUESE GUINEA IN SENEGAL\n\n130. As reported to the Assembly at its twentieth session, the Government of Senegal requested the High Commissioner in 1964 to provide assistance for some 30,000 refugees from Portuguese Guinea who had arrived in the Casamance area of Senegal. Since then, a further influx of 20,000 had brought their number to some 50,000 by the end of 1965. The first groups of refugees were assisted spontaneously by the local population but as their number continued to increase, it became necessary for the Senegal Government to draw up a plan for their local settlement in agriculture and to enlist the help of the international community towards that end.\n\n131. The settlement plan of the Senegal Government, as outlined in paragraph 97 of the report to the Assembly at its twentieth session, has since been put into effect with the participation of the Government of Senegal and the support of the Governments of France and the United States, of UNHCR and of other organizations. The programme is being implemented by a national committee for refugees, in co-operation with the central and local authorities, the Catholic Relief Services/Secours Catholiques, the League of Red Cross Societies and the Senegal Red Cross.\n\n132. The UNHCR contribution included an amount of $99,000 within the 1964 current programme and some $83,000 under the 1965 programme, the latter including $72,100 for the settlement of refugees in agriculture and $10,500 for health services.\n\n133. Within the framework of the over-all plan for assistance to these refugees, 3,200 tons of food donated by the United States Government was distributed to the refugees in 1965, and the drilling of water wells began. Tracks and light bridges were built in order to provide for access to the areas of settlement of the refugees and at the same time, to facilitate the outlet of their agricultural production.\n\n134. The promotion of agricultural and village settlement under the UNHCR programme included the construction of veterinary posts for the refugees cattle, the distribution of farming equipment and the establishment of a pilot rice farm. A variety of measures were taken in the field of medical assistance and health through the generosity and combined efforts of several Governments and voluntary agencies. A number of simple health and social welfare centres were built in the area of settlement. Mobile health units were established for which three nurses were made available through the League of Red Cross Societies. Vehicles were provided by UNHCR under its 1965 programme.\n\n135. By the end of 1965, the health services were operating at full capacity. The distribution of food to those refugees who had not reaped their harvest will need to continue under the 1966 programme. An allocation of $260,000 has been approved by the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme for assistance to these refugees in 1966.\n\nREFUGEES FROM MOZAMBIQUE IN TANZANIA\n\n136. The number of refugees from Mozambique in Tanzania was approximately 10,000 at the beginning of 1965. Most of these were being settled at Rutamba under the programme outlined in paragraphs 99-102 of the High Commissioner's report to the Assembly at its twentieth session. In the course of the year, there was a further influx of some 3,000 refugees from Mozambique in the Mbamba Bay region. On the other hand, some 1,000 returned to their country of origin.\n\n137. In the course of 1965, good progress was made in settling the refugees on the land at Rutamba through the joint efforts of the Tanzania authorities, the LWF/TCRS and the World Food Programme. An amount of some $213,000 was committed under the 1965 programme as a contribution from UNHCR towards the settlement of these refugees. The refugees built their own accommodation. By the end of the year they had cleared 720 acres of bushland out of the total of 2,000 acres made available to them by the Tanzanian Government. The refugees themselves cleared 500 acres by hand. A good crop may be expected from the newly cultivated land. Furthermore, the refugees are growing their own vegetables. A number of individual refugees left the settlement, mostly to take up work elsewhere. This, however, has hardly affected the work of cultivation at Rutamba.\n\n138. As regards educational assistance, the first three classroom units are under construction, in accordance with the provisions of the programme.\n\n139. Further assistance for refugees from Mozambique in Tanzania will be required in 1966 to consolidate their establishment. An allocation of $192,000 for this purpose has accordingly been approved by the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme at its fourteenth session. Furthermore, a request for international assistance is expected from the Tanzanian Government to assist it in coping with the new influx of 3,000 refugees from Mozambique in the Mbamba Bay area.\n\nREFUGEES FROM MOZAMBIQUE IN ZAMBIA\n\n140. Some 5,000 refugees from Mozambique arrived in the Eastern province of Zambia in December 1965. In response to a request from the Zambian Government, UNHCR first contributed $5,000 from its Emergency Fund early in 1966 to meet the basic needs of the refugees, in particular for food and medical assistance. Subsequently UNHCR received the Executive Committee's approval for an interim allocation of $100,000 to be included in the UNHCR programme for 1966 towards the settlement of 2,000 of the above-mentioned refugees on the land. A proposal for a further limited allocation will be considered by the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's programme at its fifteenth session.\n\nREFUGEES FROM THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO\n\n141. At the beginning of 1965, there were between 50,000 and 60,000 Congolese refugees in various countries in Africa, including 20,000 in Burundi, 3,000 in the Central African Republic, some 2,000 in Tanzania, and some 34,000 in Uganda. During that year there was a new influx of 5,000 into Burundi and between 5,000 and 15,000 into Uganda. A considerable number have since opted for voluntary repatriation so that by the end of 1965, the number of Congolese had decreased to approximately 48,000, of whom 13,000 were in Burundi, an estimated 3,000 in the central African Republic, some 2,000 in Tanzania and some 30,000 in Uganda. Under the UNHCR current programme for 1965, an amount of $2,258 was committed to facilitate the voluntary repatriation of 497 of these refugees.\n\n142. The International Committee of the Red Cross has been assisting the Governments of Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda in the negotiations relating to the voluntary repatriation of the Congolese refugees.\n\n143. In 1965 an amount of over $43,000 was committed from the UNHCR Emergency Fund to provide emergency relief for the Congolese refugees in Burundi and $16,000 to provide measures for initial assistance to Congolese refugees in the Central African Republic.\n\nINDIVIDUAL CASES\n\n144. Supplementary aid on a limited scale was given to forty-eight individual cases of various origins in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Through joint action of the Resident Representative of the United Nations in Dar es Salaam and UNHCR, a number of refugees from South West Africa were assisted to move to Tanzania under a project financed from special trust funds.\n\nC. Assistance to European refugees\n\nASSISTANCE UNDER MAJOR AID PROGRAMMES\n\n145. It will be recalled that the \"old\" European refugees were assisted in achieving permanent solutions to their problems under the UNHCR major aid programmes, drawn up and approved between 1955 and 1963. By 31 December 1965, these programmes had reached a stage when their early completion could be envisaged. As of that date, nearly 150,000 refugees had benefited under the programmes. Over 96,500 had become firmly settled as a direct result of the help provided through UNHCR, and some 43,000 through other means.\n\n146. Of the total cost of more than $100 million involved in these programmes over $56 million were contributed from within the countries where the projects were put into effect. Thus many of these countries, which had generously granted asylum to refugees, also played an important role in contributing to the permanent solution of their problems.\n\n147. Of the 150,000 beneficiaries under these programmes, over 18,000 refugees were assisted in 1965. By the end of the year over 6,750 of them had become firmly settled as a direct result of UNHCR programmes and another 1,700 to 1,800 through other means.\n\n148. Solutions for most of the beneficiaries were achieved through settlement in their country of residence. Some 1,140 were resettled in other countries with the help of the Inter-governmental Committee for European Migration, over 700 of whom came from the mainland of China via Hong Kong. With the continued support of a number of interested countries of immigration, a substantial effort was made to assist members of the sect of \"Old Believers\" among them. Resettlement from a number of countries where the refugees find it increasingly difficult to consolidate their economic and social position was also continued. Physically handicapped refugees, mainly in the Far East and North Africa, benefited from special arrangements for their admission to a number of immigration countries in Europe and overseas. A contribution was made under the programme towards the operation of a protected community at Capua, Italy, and of a psychiatric centre in Belgium, aimed at providing initial rehabilitation measures for the handicapped.\n\n149. As in previous years, an important factor in achieving the local integration of refugees was the provision of housing. Over the past ten years, 10,164 housing units were completed for the benefit of 11,211 refugee households (comprising 35,790 persons). Of these, 434 units were completed in 1965, most of them in Austria, France, Germany and Greece, and the remainder in Italy, Jordan and Latin America. Of the 1,384 housing units still under construction or preparation at the end of 1965, over 920 are in Greece where implementation of the housing projects has been considerably delayed.\n\n150. A further important element in the completion of major aid programmes was the settlement of handicapped refugees and particularly those who need permanent care. Of a total of nearly 900 cases, some 500 were settled in institutions in their country of residence or in other countries, while the others were provided with annuities or accommodated in housing where arrangements are made for them to receive the necessary care. A further 278 handicapped refugees benefited from rehabilitation measures which should enable many of them to become at least partly self-supporting.\n\n151. Other measures undertaken towards the successful integration of the remaining \"old\" European refugees include vocational training and education. Experience has shown that this type of assistance often enables its beneficiaries to settle down successfully in their country of residence. In the course of 1965, some 3,000 refugees also benefited from a variety of other measures aimed at enabling them to become fully self-supporting. The remaining caseload at the end of the year comprised 14,700 refugees, 9,700 of whom were already in the course of settlement, as shown in the following table:\n\nCountry or areaTotal caseload on 31 December 1965In course of settlement on 31 December 1965Far East1,200170Federal Republic of Germany7,1007,070France1,500580Greece2,800750Italy270270Latin America8080Meddle East500250Morocco700Turkey500490Various5040Total (rounded)14,7009,700\n\n152. Further assistance will therefore be mainly required for some 1,200 refugees in the Far East with a view to their resettlement in other countries; for some 800 refugees in France, mostly handicapped, many of whom await the completion of housing with care for the aged or infirm; over 2,000 in Greece who cannot yet be settled in view of the delay in implementing the housing projects in that country, and a group of 1,200 in the Middle East and Morocco who, owing to changing economic and social conditions, had to apply for resettlement in other areas. Final measures of assistance for some of these groups may have to be provided under the UNHCR current annual programmes.\n\n153. The important investment made by the international community in the major aid programmes over the past ten years has not only contributed to alleviating the misery of thousands of refugees, but has also established a basis on which the UNHCR current programme can be operated more effectively and at a reasonable cost. Under projects for housing and institutions for the handicapped, for example, places vacated by the present refugee tenants may be reoccupied by other needy refugees for as long as the need exists. Furthermore, the reimbursement of loans previously made to refugees through implementing agencies in an approximate amount of $12,650,000 is likely to continue at an annual average of $320,000 for a number of years to come. Loans repaid by refugees will thus help towards the financing of the current programmes.\n\nASSISTANCE UNDER UNHCR CURRENT OPERATIONS\n\n154. Whereas the major aid programmes were intended for the non-settled \"old\" European refugees, the UNHCR current programmes are designed to meet the new needs of European refugees, particularly in the case of newcomers who are unable to fend for themselves and require assistance in addition to that which can be granted by the country of first asylum. The number of newly recognized European refugees increased from 9,974 in 1964 to nearly 10,500 in 1965.\n\n155. As in previous years, many of the refugees were young and able-bodied and were able to find resettlement opportunities in other countries or to settle in their country of first asylum without too much difficulty. A number of them, however, including a certain proportion of physically and socially handicapped, were unable to become self-supporting without complementary assistance from UNHCR. This was the case in particular in a few countries in Europe where the increased rate of arrivals exceeded in varying degrees the number of departures for resettlement.\n\n156. Resettlement activities during 1965 had therefore to be geared to the increase in the number of asylum seekers, particularly during the second half of the year, when the transit and processing centres in several countries of first asylum were filled to capacity. Thanks to the full co-operation of the main countries of immigration, USEP and ICEM, a serious accumulation of new arrivals in countries of first asylum was avoided.\n\n157. The resettlement of over 1,150 European refugees was promoted, financed or co-financed by UNHCR under its current programme for 1965. UNHCR assistance included mainly resettlement counselling, the financing of resettlement grants for handicapped refugees, and arrangements for the movement of 234 Turkmenians admitted to Turkey for resettlement.\n\n158. Over 3,400 refugees received assistance towards their integration in their country of residence in several countries in Europe and in Latin America, as indicated in annex IV to the present report. The majority were located in Austria, Germany and Greece. There was also a substantial number in Argentina, France, Italy and Yugoslavia. In certain countries or areas where comprehensive plans for the solution of the problem of refugees had not been put into effect, international assistance continued to be required under the current programme in particular to solve newly emerging needs of refugees who had reached old age or had become sick or infirm before they had been able to achieve permanent settlement.\n\n159. The type of assistance given to refugees who could neither emigrate nor become locally integrated through their own efforts followed the usual pattern and included, in particular, housing, establishment assistance, rehabilitation measures and placement in institutions. As indicated above, a number of refugees were able to benefit from vacancies in housing and institutions in which places had been reserved for refugees under earlier UNHCR projects.\n\n160. Counselling again played an essential role in helping the refugees to choose the most appropriate solution to their problems. As mentioned in the last report to the General Assembly, the question of the extent to which counselling should be provided for under the current programme was considered by the Executive Committee at its fourteenth session when the Committee decided that counselling services for refugees should, as far as possible, be integrated into the framework of the social welfare services in the countries concerned. At the same time the Committee requested the High Commissioner to ensure that sufficient funds were available to provide counselling to those refugees who were unable to obtain the necessary counselling services from the local authorities.\n\n161. In addition to the funds committed for assistance to European refugees under 1965 programme, substantive contributions were received which were earmarked by the donors for projects outside the current programmes. In the course of 1965, an amount of over $391,000 was thus received for assistance to European refugees, including some $143,000 for assistance to refugees in Greece and over $248,000 for projects in other countries (see annex IV).\n\nD. Assistance to other groups of refugees\n\nCHINESE REFUGEES IN MACAO\n\n162. The number of Chinese refugees in Macao, approximately 75,000 at the beginning of 1965, had risen to some 80,000 by the end of that year. The local authorities and voluntary agencies have continued their efforts to provide relief for the new arrivals. During 1965, they also made increasing efforts to help the refugees to become self-supporting.\n\n163. Two important projects begun in 1964 were continued in 1965. Towards these, UNHCR contributed $65,000 during that year. Under one of these projects, UNHCR contributed $55,000 for the building of a causeway between the islands of Taipa and Coloane. The building of the causeway created opportunities for a large number of workers, including a majority of refugees. Under the other project, to which UNHCR contributed $10,000 in 1965, a rehabilitation centre on the island of Taipa was extended so as to provide vacancies for refugees. The project was completed during the period under review. In 1965, over 250 Chinese refugees benefited from treatment at the centre.\n\n164. An amount of $105,000 was committed under the 1965 programme for the construction of housing. Under one project, 242 dwellings will be made available for an equivalent number of refugee households. This project has required considerable efforts, particularly with regard to the reclamation of land from the sea. Under a second project, eighty to ninety individual refugees will be housed.\n\n165. Further assistance for these refugees will be required in 1966, particularly as regards housing and employment opportunities. An allocation of $54,000 has accordingly been approved by the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme for inclusion in the 1966 programme, and a further allocation of between $100,000-$130,000 will be considered by the Committee at its fifteenth session.\n\nCHINESE REFUGEES IN HONG KONG\n\n166. The High Commissioner continued to follow with interest the position of Chinese refugees in Hong Kong who, it will be recalled, are benefiting from large-scale development projects put into effect by the Hong Kong authorities.\n\nCUBAN REFUGEES\n\n167. The number of Cubans in Latin America remained between 20,000 and 30,000 during 1965. Some 950 benefited from UNHCR assistance in their resettlement or integration. Of these 867 were assisted under a $21,000 project in the UNHCR programme while in transit in Mexico and Jamaica, pending their resettlement in the United States of America. Others received limited UNHCR assistance with a view to their resettlement from the United States to various countries in Latin America, mainly for the purpose of family reunion.\n\n168. In Spain, the number of Cubans, estimated at over 10,000 on 1 January 1965, increased by approximately 2,000 through a new influx of some 4,800 in the course of that year. Some 3,000 were able to leave Spain for resettlement so that by the end of 965 approximately 12,000 still remained in Spain.\n\n169. The rate of departures kept pace with the rate of new arrivals during the early part of 1965. Following amendments to the United States Immigration and Naturalization Act, which became effective in December 1965, the rate of Cubans who could emigrate from Spain to the United States decreased considerably during the first two months of 1966. Since March 1966, the number of visas issued has again increased. However, the number was still insufficient to provide resettlement opportunities for the total number of new arrivals wishing to be resettled in the United States.\n\n170. Assistance continued to be provided through a network of governmental and voluntary welfare services and agencies. It was given mainly in the form of promotion of resettlement, assistance towards integration for those who wish to remain in Spain and supplementary aid for the newly arrived.\n\n171. Under the UNHCR current programme for 1965, an amount of $150,000 was committed for assistance to Cuban refugees in Spain, including some $136,000 for assistance towards their integration, $6,000 for resettlement counselling, and $8,000 for supplementary aid to the neediest among them. To facilitate the resettlement of those migrating to other countries, 182 cases faced with particular hardship received assistance towards their transportation costs from funds contributed to UNHCR for operations outside the current programme.\n\n172. The number of Cubans admitted to the United States increased from 225,000 at the beginning of 1965 to 249,000 at the end of the year.\n\nTIBETAN REFUGEES IN NEPAL\n\n173. The number of Tibetan refugees in Nepal at the beginning of 1965 was estimated at be"
