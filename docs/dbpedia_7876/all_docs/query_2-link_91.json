        "text": "by Leonardo Zanatta\n\nIn the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a considerable number of Russians opted to depart from their homeland. Since it can be entered without visa and is just across the Caucasus Mountain range from Russia, Georgia emerged as one of the most popular destinations.\n\nGathering precise numbers on the Russian relokanty (a term used by the Russian émigré community to describe their status) in the country presents challenges, but it is believed that hundreds of thousands of individuals have migrated to the Caucasian republic since the beginning of the war. In the first 9 months of 2022 alone, as estimated by the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs, the number of Russian nationals who arrived in the country totaled 112,000.\n\nA survey by the Centre for East European and International Studies (ZOiS) published in May 2023 states that Russian relokanty in Georgia are predominantly young (average age is about 32.6) and well-educated. A substantial portion of them hails from major Russian cities, is employed in the IT sector and, most importantly, holds a negative view of their home country’s government.\n\nThe migration of Russians to Georgia can be categorized into two significant waves. The initial surge occurred in the early weeks following the invasion and continued throughout the summer. The second surge came after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a ‘partial mobilization’ on September 21, 2022. The first wave was largely driven by individuals holding resentment towards political repression in Russia and the Kremlin’s escalation of the war, while the second wave was arguably mostly composed of individuals seeking to avoid conscription.\n\nIn the meantime, hearing the Russian language has become increasingly common on the streets of Georgian cities. Those Russian relokanty who decided to stay have established new lives in the country, engaging in work, education, childcare, shopping, renting apartments, social gatherings, and leisurely walks in parks. Russian cafes, shops, and similar businesses have also opened.\n\nNevertheless, the first wave of Russians did not receive the warmest welcome in the Caucasian republic. As evidenced by the multitude of antiwar demonstrations, the prominent display of Ukrainian flags adorning the streets and shops of major Georgian cities, and the participation of Georgian volunteers in the Ukrainian army, Georgian people have wholeheartedly supported Ukraine since the beginning of the war. For many Georgians, the Kremlin’s 2022 invasion has evoked painful memory of the 2008 Russo-Georgian war and Moscow’s backing of Georgia’s breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia (which Georgians call “Samachablo”).\n\nDuring interviews conducted by the author and Cesare Figari Barberis in September 2022, some Russian émigrés shared accounts of facing verbal abuse, banking discrimination, losing job based on their nationality, and challenges in finding accommodation. They also reported that some landlords openly refused to rent to Russians, and certain banks and public venues, such as cafés and restaurants, even required them to acknowledge Russia’s occupation of Georgian territory in formal documents.\n\nGraffiti insulting Russians and/or calling on them to leave started to appear on the walls and sidewalks of Georgian cities. Additionally, a narrative portraying these Russian migrants as a potential ‘fifth column’ for the Kremlin, with concerns about a possible invasion under the pretext of defending ethnic Russians in Georgia, began to spread in certain segments of Georgian society. Although the sudden influx of relokanty led to a significant injection of money into Georgia’s economy, it also resulted in a surge in rent prices, further exacerbating existing resentment. Of course, not all the Russian migrants faced the same degree of discrimination, as many Georgians remained neutral or even welcoming.\n\nWhile the Georgian government, led by the Georgian Dream Party, has viewed this process as a new economic opportunity, the opposition has addressed Russian relokanty as an economic and security concern for the country in the long run. The political party Lelo suggested implementing a distinct entry system for Russian citizens, implying issuing of short-term visas at the border and requiring written acknowledgment of Russia’s occupation and Georgia’s territorial integrity. Additionally, the United National Movement, Georgia’s largest opposition party, proposed that Russians entering the country pay an “occupation tax” of 1,000 lari (approximately $350).\n\nIn her Independence Day speech on May 26 of this year, Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili criticized the government’s policies regarding Russian immigrants. She questioned why no measures or regulations had been established for the influx of Russians and their activities. She also noted Georgia’s historical hospitality and tolerance, while cautioning against Russia’s tendency to use Russian speakers in other countries as a pretext for invasion."
