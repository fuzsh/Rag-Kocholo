Yul Brynner was a Russian actor.

Biography[]

Born Youl Briner in Vladivostock, Russia, he and his mother emigrated to the United States in 1940. During the war he worked as a French speaking commentator on radio for the Office of US War Information and made his film debut in 1949, the same year he auditioned for his greatest success, The King and I.

In 1956, he appeared as Pharaoh Rameses II in The Ten Commandments, one of his most memorable roles, and cinema's finest spectacles. He had a long and prolific film career, notably playing Chris Adams in The Magnificent Seven.

Brynner died in 1985.

Singing[]

Though typically a film actor, Brynner made a number of renowned stage appearances, most notably as the titular King Mongkut in The King and I and the later film adaptation, a role he played in several revivals.

He attempted to reproduce his musical success in 1976 by playing Odysseus in Home Sweet Homer, but the show had a troubled production and was declared a flop.
