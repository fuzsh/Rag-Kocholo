        "text": "All good things come to an end: today, we say goodbye to my #DigitalNumber series. For more than three years, I have published my Digital Number series here on LinkedIn, presenting you with interesting facts and figures from studies, surveys, and statistics. We covered a wide range of topics – from e-commerce and AI to digitalization and cybercrime. As it's all about the numbers, a total of 129 posts were created. Today, we say goodbye to my series with the 130th post. I hope you had some enlightening moments and learned something new from the facts and figures I shared. Thanks a lot for reading, commenting, and following.\n\nLast year, cybercrime in online retail significantly increased worldwide. According to LexisNexis Risk Solutions, a U.S.-based provider of data security services, the number of human-initiated attacks on e-commerce transactions rose by 59 percent. These refer to cyber-attacks that are not caused by pre-programmed bots but by human actors. Overall, human-initiated online attacks are estimated at 19 percent. In addition to e-commerce, this figure includes attacks on banking transactions as well as computer and online gambling. According to Lexis Nexis Risk Solutions, most cyber attacks occur in North America. --- #DigitalNumber #eCommerce\n\nIf you think the #Metaverse is yesterday's news, you might be wrong. According to data analysts at Altindex, the metaverse e-commerce has grown by 60 percent in the last three years. Another 30 percent growth of the global metaverse e-commerce is expected in 2024, according to Statista Market Insights. In concrete terms, this would translate into a global turnover of more than 30 billion US dollars this year. Looking ahead, data from Altindex indicates that metaverse e-commerce will be a $200 billion industry by 2030. So, let's see where it's going. --- #DigitalNumber #eCommerce\n\nThis week, my #DigitalNumber proves: Marketplaces are becoming increasingly relevant! In 2023, more than 50 percent of online sales in Germany were generated via online marketplaces, setting a record. This is one finding of the latest HDE-Online-Monitor by Handelsverband Deutschland e.V. (HDE). Another interesting insight is that the smartphone plays a key role in online shopping: In 2023, 55 percent of all online retail sales in Germany (almost 47 billion euros) were generated via smartphones. This represents a new record and shows how important mobile devices have become for online retail. --- #eCommerce\n\nAre Gen AI tools part of your daily work? Well, that's not the case for everyone. 35 percent of German companies do not allow their employees to use GenAI tools. This is one finding of Cisco's latest Data Privacy Benchmark Study 2024. The main reasons? Potential violations of legal and intellectual property rights and the exposure of information. This includes employee data and non-public company information. In comparison, the number of companies worldwide that do not allow the use of Gen AI tools is lower at 27 percent. --- #DigitalNumber #eCommerce\n\nWhich country is leading in total e-commerce sales? Can you guess? According to the ECDB survey, the global e-commerce market is dominated by China: In 2023, total sales (B2C sales of physical goods including VAT) amounted to USD 2,179 billion. The United States comes second with sales of USD 981 billion and the United Kingdom third with sales of USD 157 billion. And Germany? With sales of about USD 113 billion, it ranks sixth. The best-selling product groups in German online retail are clothing, electronics, and telecommunications. --- #DigitalNumber #eCommerce\n\nHave you ever asked yourself: Will AI soon take over my job? According to a survey conducted by Bitkom, 13 percent of German employees believe that they will be completely replaced in their jobs by an AI. However, almost half (45 percent) of those surveyed said they would like to have an AI as a personal assistant at work. So, the question is: Why are opinions about AI so divided? I think, it is important that everyone becomes familiar with the new technology. Companies should support their employees in developing their own AI skills. This helps them to understand the technology better. In the end, this creates openness and trust. --- #DigitalNumber #ArtificialIntelligence\n\nHow do you prefer to shop? Offline, online, or both combined? According to a survey on behalf of Unzer, 41.5 percent of consumers surveyed no longer want to be tied to one shopping channel. So, to combine the best of both worlds, networked retail is the answer. It offers convenience, security, and choice. In this context, 41 percent of the consumers surveyed stated that a single account in which all order details, payment data, and delivery addresses are stored would be the most convenient way for them. While this has been a reality for some companies for some time now, it does not yet seem to be common practice. --- #DigitalNumber #eCommerce\n\nIs the implementation of #ArtificialIntelligence as revolutionary as the introduction of the PC? #DigitalNumber According to a representative survey by Bitkom, 46 percent of German companies say: Yes, it is! What would you answer? The survey led to further interesting findings: 67 percent of the companies surveyed are convinced that AI will simplify routine tasks in business and administrative processes for their employees. And a third (32 percent) believes that AI will significantly increase productivity in these processes. And I fully agree with both aspects. However, the survey also shows that 8 out of 10 companies wait to hear what others have experienced before implementing AI within their own company. This “wait-and-see” attitude, which possibly arises from the uncertainty that still exists around this technology, is preventing companies from leveraging its full potential right now.\n\nWhat do you think is the percentage of EU companies that trade online? Can you guess? #DigitalNumber According to Eurostat statistics, an average of 22.9 percent of enterprises sold their goods and services online in 2022 – slightly more than in 2021. 📈 I find it particularly interesting, that Lithuania ranked first with 38.9 percent, followed by Sweden (38.1 percent) and Denmark (36.7 percent). Germany, with 22.2 percent, was slightly below average and ranked 17th. The lowest proportion of companies trading online was in Romania (12.9 percent). I would be curious to know: Which countries would you have expected to be ranked first or last? Let me know in the comments! ⬇️ --- #DigitalCommerce #OnlineShopping"
