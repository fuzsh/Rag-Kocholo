The concepts of microdosimetry and its techniques were developed almost single handedly by H.H. Rossi. This memorial lecture outlines some of the ideas and some of the work of Harald Rossi that led to microdosimetry. It describes its major impact on radiobiology and, especially, its impact on studies with fast neutrons and on risk assessment. Microdosimetry was primarily designed as a tool for the elucidation of basic mechanisms of radiation action, but it has found its most important applications in the dosimetric measurement techniques that have become indispensable in radiation protection and in the dosimetry for radiation therapy. The advances of molecular biology are now providing new possibilities for a quantitative application of microdosimetry to radiobiology along the lines that Harald Rossi defined.

Thus, any improvements in practice are vital and we suggest that conservation can be enhanced through recent advances in evolutionary biology, specifically advances put forward by evolutionary developmental biology (i.e., evo-devo). There are strong overlapping conceptual links between conservation and evo-devo whereby both fields focus on evolutionary potential. In particular, benefits to conservation can be derived from some of the main areas of evo-devo research, namely phenotypic plasticity, modularity and integration, and mechanistic investigations of the precise developmental and genetic processes that determine phenotypes. Using examples we outline how evo-devo can expand into conservation biology, an opportunity which holds great promise for advancing both fields. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

I argue that this represents an obstacle to a wider appreciation of evo-devo and its integration within a more comprehensive evolutionary theory, and that this situation is causally linked to a limited exchange between theoretical and experimental studies in evo-devo. I discuss some features of current theoretical work in evo-devo, highlighting some possibly concurring impediments to an effective dialogue with experimental studies. Finally, I advance two suggestions for enhancing fruitful cross-fertilization between theoretical and empirical studies in evo-devo: i to broaden the scope of evo-devo beyond its current conceptualization, teaming up with other variational approaches to the study of evolution, and ii to develop more effective forms of scientific interaction and communication.\n\nIn quest of perfection in electron optics: A biographical sketch of Harald Rose on the occasion of his 80th birthday\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nUrban, Knut W., E-mail: k.urban@fz-juelich.de\n\n2015-04-15\n\nThis brief biographical sketch of Harald Rose on occasion of his 80th birthday describes some of the key events in an extraordinarily successful scientific life.

Some Comments on Chomskyâs Analogies between the Biolinguistic Approach and Evo-Devo\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAntonio BenÃ­tez-Burraco\n\n2010-12-01\n\nFull Text Available In some recent papers, Chomsky has suggested some non-trivial analogies between the biolinguistic approach and evolutionary developmental biology (Evo-Devo. In this paper, the point is made that those analogies should be handled with caution. The reason is that the Evo-Devo version chosen by Chomsky in order to build the analogies fully assumes a gene-centric perspective. Although providing genes with a special power fits in well with the Principles-and-Parameters model, it does not agree at all with the reduction of the power attributed to genes that the Minimalist Program has placed on the agenda. Nevertheless, other Evo-Devo approaches exist that seem more accurate than the particular version adopted by Chomsky â approaches therefore which are more promising for fulfilling the minimalist biolinguistic approach.\n\nWhere is, in 2017, the evo in evo-devo (evolutionary developmental biology)?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDiogo, Rui\n\n2018-01-01\n\nAfter the inaugural Pan-American-Evo-Devo meeting (2015, Berkeley), I showed how major concerns about evo-devo (Evolutionary Developmental Biology) research were demonstrated by a simple, non-biased quantitative analysis of the titles/abstracts of that meeting's talks. Here, I apply the same methodology to the titles/abstracts of the recent Pan-American-Evo-Devo meeting (2017, Calgary). The aim is to evaluate if the concerns raised by me in that paper and by other authors have been addressed and/or if there are other types of differences between the two meetings that may reflect trends within the field of evo-devo. This analysis shows that the proportion of presentations referring to \"morphology\", \"organism\", \"selection\", \"adaptive\", \"phylogeny\", and their derivatives was higher in the 2017 meeting, which therefore had a more \"organismal\" feel. However, there was a decrease in the use of \"evolution\"/its derivatives and of macroevolutionary terms related to the tempo and mode of evolution in the 2017 meeting. Moreover, the disproportionately high use of genetic/genomic terms clearly shows that evo-devo continues to be mainly focused on devo, and particularly on \"Geno\", that is, on molecular/genetic studies. Furthermore, the vast majority of animal evo-devo studies are focused only on hard tissues, which are just a small fraction of the whole organism-for example, only 15% of the tissue mass of the human body. The lack of an integrative approach is also evidenced by the lack of studies addressing conceptual/long-standing broader questions, including the links between ecology and particularly behavior and developmental/evolutionary variability and between evo-devo and evolutionary medicine.

Integrating MorphoEvoDevo into molecular EvoDevo and phylogenomics\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAndreas eWanninger\n\n2015-05-01\n\nFull Text Available Morphology, the description and analysis of organismal form, is one of the oldest biological disciplines that has significantly contributed to our understanding as to how animals function and how the overwhelming diversity of phenotypes evolved. The early discovery that comparative studies of morphogenesis add to our understanding of the evolutionary history and interrelationships of organisms led to the formulation of highly influential evolutionary principles, including Haeckelâs theory of recapitulation or Hatschekâs trochozoon-hypothesis, and established the intellectual foundation of a research area today termed EvoDevo. While the rapid integration of molecular techniques into systematics, phylogenetics, and developmental biology from the 1980s onwards made some consider morphology as having little to contribute to evolutionary research, methodological progress together with a revived focus on morphogenesis has resulted in an unexpected renaissance of evolutionary developmental morphology, here termed MorphoEvoDevo. Herein, I briefly summarize some classical landmark contributions and progress achieved by studies using the MorphoEvoDevo approach. I will focus on the role of morphology in modern evolutionary biology, especially with respect to the molecular-driven approaches such as phylogenetics and developmental genetics. I argue that, while MorphoEvoDevo may well survive as an independent field of research, in times of increased competition for funding it will significantly profit from integration of the molecular disciplines into research programs with a strong emphasis on morphology. After all, morphological data are indispensable for reconstruction of phenotypic ground patterns and character evolution, and only a holistic approach incorporating all major subdisciplines of the evolutionary biosciences may ultimately result in a deep understanding, from molecules to ecosystems, of the driving forces that have shaped our organismal\n\nEvo-devo and cognitive science\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nPloeger, A.; Galis, F.; Nuno de la Rosa, L.; MÃ¼ller, G.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nEvo-devo is an approach that integrates knowledge on evolution and development.

This is increasingly the case not only for the origins of evolutionary novelties that permit new functions and open up new adaptive zones, but also for the processes of evolutionary tinkering that occur within the subsequent radiations of related species. Evo-devo has time and again yielded spectacular examples of Darwin's notions of common ancestry and of descent with modification. It has also shown that the evolution of endless forms is more about the evolution of the regulatory machinery of ancient genes than the origin and elaboration of new genes. Evolvability, especially with respect to the capacity of a developmental system to evolve and to generate the variation in form for natural selection to screen, has become a pivotal focus of evo-devo. As a consequence, a balancing of the concept of endless forms in morphospace with a greater awareness of the potential for developmental constraints and bias is becoming more general. The prospect of parallel horizons opening up for the evolution of behaviour is exciting; in particular, does Sean Carroll's phrase referring to old genes learning new tricks in the evolution of endless forms apply equally as well to patterns of diversity and disparity in behavioural trait-space?\n\nComparative Transcriptomes and EVO-DEVO Studies Depending on Next Generation Sequencing\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTiancheng Liu\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available High throughput technology has prompted the progressive omics studies, including genomics and transcriptomics. We have reviewed the improvement of comparative omic studies, which are attributed to the high throughput measurement of next generation sequencing technology. Comparative genomics have been successfully applied to evolution analysis while comparative transcriptomics are adopted in comparison of expression profile from two subjects by differential expression or differential coexpression, which enables their application in evolutionary developmental biology (EVO-DEVO studies. EVO-DEVO studies focus on the evolutionary pressure affecting the morphogenesis of development and previous works have been conducted to illustrate the most conserved stages during embryonic development. Old measurements of these studies are based on the morphological similarity from macro view and new technology enables the micro detection of similarity in molecular mechanism. Evolutionary model of embryo development, which includes the âfunnel-likeâ model and the âhourglassâ model, has been evaluated by combination of these new comparative transcriptomic methods with prior comparative genomic information. Although the technology has promoted the EVO-DEVO studies into a new era, technological and material limitation still exist and further investigations require more subtle study design and procedure.\n\nEndise NATO kÃµrge juhi sÃµnul on Afganistan alliansi proovikivi / Harald Kujat ; interv.

We present here a series of vignettes to illustrate the central role that living collections have played in plant biology research, including evo-devo research. Looking towards the future, living collections will become increasingly important in support of future evo-devo research. The driving force behind this trend is nucleic acid sequencing technologies, which are rapidly becoming more powerful and cost-effective, and which can be applied to virtually any species. This allows for more extensive sampling, including non-model organisms with unique biological features and plants from diverse phylogenetic positions. Importantly, a major challenge for sequencing-based evo-devo research is to identify, access, and propagate appropriate plant materials. We use a vignette of the ongoing One Thousand Transcriptomes project as an example of the challenges faced by such projects. We conclude by identifying some of the pinch-points likely to be encountered by future evo-devo researchers, and how living collections can help address them.\n\nBiological Systematics in the Evo-Devo era\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAlessandro Minelli\n\n2015-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo suggests a distinction between modular and systemic variation. In the case of modular change, the conservation of the overall structure helps recognizing affinities, while a single, fast evolving module is likely to produce a bonanza for the taxonomist, while systemic changes produce strongly deviating morphologies that cause problems in tracing homologies. Similarly, changes affecting the whole life cycle are more challenging than those limited to one stage. Developmental modularity is a precondition for heterochrony. Analyzing a matrix of morphological data for paedomorphic taxa requires special care. It is, however, possible to extract phylogenetic signal from heterochronic patterns. The taxonomist should pay attention to the intricacies of the genotypeâphenotype map. When using genetic data to infer phylogeny, a comparison of gene sequences is just a first step. To bridge the gap between genes and morphology we should consider the spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression, and their regulation. Minor genetic change can have major phenotypic effects, sometimes suggesting saltational evolution. Evo-devo is also relevant in respect to speciation: changes in developmental schedules are often implicated in the divergence between sympatric morphs, and a developmental modulation of âtemporal phenotypesâ appears to be responsible for many cases of speciation.\n\nEco-Evo-Devo: developmental symbiosis and developmental plasticity as evolutionary agents.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGilbert, Scott F; Bosch, Thomas C G; LedÃ³n-Rettig, Cristina\n\n2015-10-01\n\nThe integration of research from developmental biology and ecology into evolutionary theory has given rise to a relatively new field, ecological evolutionary developmental biology (Eco-Evo-Devo). This field integrates and organizes concepts such as developmental symbiosis, developmental plasticity, genetic accommodation, extragenic inheritance and niche construction. This Review highlights the roles that developmental symbiosis and developmental plasticity have in evolution. Developmental symbiosis can generate particular organs, can produce selectable genetic variation for the entire animal, can provide mechanisms for reproductive isolation, and may have facilitated evolutionary transitions. Developmental plasticity is crucial for generating novel phenotypes, facilitating evolutionary transitions and altered ecosystem dynamics, and promoting adaptive variation through genetic accommodation and niche construction. In emphasizing such non-genomic mechanisms of selectable and heritable variation, Eco-Evo-Devo presents a new layer of evolutionary synthesis.\n\nNeutrality and robustness in evo-devo: emergence of lateral inhibition.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAndreea Munteanu\n\n2008-11-01\n\nFull Text Available Embryonic development is defined by the hierarchical dynamical process that translates genetic information (genotype into a spatial gene expression pattern (phenotype providing the positional information for the correct unfolding of the organism. The nature and evolutionary implications of genotype-phenotype mapping still remain key topics in evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo. We have explored here issues of neutrality, robustness, and diversity in evo-devo by means of a simple model of gene regulatory networks. The small size of the system allowed an exhaustive analysis of the entire fitness landscape and the extent of its neutrality. This analysis shows that evolution leads to a class of robust genetic networks with an expression pattern characteristic of lateral inhibition. This class is a repertoire of distinct implementations of this key developmental process, the diversity of which provides valuable clues about its underlying causal principles.\n\nComputational Phenotypes: Where the Theory of Computation Meets Evo-Devo\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSergio Balari\n\n2009-03-01\n\nFull Text Available This article argues that the Chomsky Hierarchy can be reinterpreted as a developmental morphospace constraining the evolution of a discrete and finite series of computational phenotypes. In doing so, the theory of Morphological Evolution as stated by Pere Alberch, a pioneering figure of EvoâDevo thinking, is adhered to.\n\nEvo-devo of novel traits : the genetic basis of butterfly colour patterns\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nSaenko, Suzanne Viatcheslavovna\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe origin and diversification of novel morphological traits is a major research theme in evolutionary developmental biology, or evo-devo.

Because of this, a clear, well-written textbook is always welcome to help students and teachers master this material. Such a book is Thermodynamics and Chemistry, by Howard DeVoe of the University of Maryland. This book is written as a one-semester textbook for senior undergraduates and graduate students who have had a previous course on the topic. This is a long book (400 pages of text, 25 pages of appendices), and it is unlikely that an instructor can cover everything in one semester. On the other hand this length does allow the author to cover topics such as a \"liquid solution in a centrifugal field\" that shorter books would omit. All important topics in chemical thermodynamics are covered. After two introductory chapters, the three laws of thermodynamics are taken up in Chapters 3 and 4. Pure substances, including phase transitions, are treated in Chapters 5 and 6. Chapter 7, \"Mixtures,\" is a long chapter that covers, among other topics, partial molar quantities, activities, and activity coefficients. Chemical reactions are treated in Chapter 8 and there is a detailed discussion of equilibrium in various multicomponent systems in Chapter 9. The book is completed with a discussion of the phase rule (Chapter 10) and a brief chapter on galvanic cells. There are a number of things I like about this book. First, DeVoe takes great care in defining important thermodynamic words such as the thermodynamic state of a system. Similarly, he makes the distinction between process and path understandable, and this allows him to clearly define a reversible process as well as spontaneous and impossible processes. Section 4.1 then contains the sentence \"An irreversible process is a spontaneous process whose reverse is an impossible process.\" This\n\nImplications of Vertebrate Craniodental Evo-Devo for Human Oral Health.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBoughner, Julia C\n\n2017-06-01\n\nHighly processed diets eaten by postindustrial modern human populations coincide with higher frequencies of third molar impaction, malocclusion, and temporomandibular joint disorders that affect millions of people worldwide each year. Current treatments address symptoms, not causes, because the multifactorial etiologies of these three concerns mask which factors incline certain people to malocclusion, impaction, and/or joint issues. Deep scientific curiosity about the origins of jaws and dentitions continues to yield rich insights about the developmental genetic mechanisms that underpin healthy craniodental morphogenesis and integration. Mounting evidence from evolution and development (Evo-Devo) studies suggests that function is another mechanism important to healthy craniodental integration and fit. Starting as early as weaning, softer diets and thus lower bite forces appear to relax or disrupt integration of oral tissues, alter development and growth, and catalyze impaction, malocclusion, and jaw joint disorders. How developing oral tissues respond to bite forces remains poorly understood, but biomechanical feedback seems to alter balances of local bone resorption and deposition at the tooth-bone interface as well as affect tempos and amounts of facial outgrowth. Also, behavioral changes in jaw function and parafunction contribute to degeneration and pain in joint articular cartilages and masticatory muscles. The developmental genetic contribution to craniodental misfits and disorders is undeniable but still unclear; however, at present, human diet and jaw function remain important and much more actionable clinical targets. New Evo-Devo studies are needed to explain how function interfaces with craniodental phenotypic plasticity, variation, and evolvability to yield a spectrum of healthy and mismatched dentitions and jaws.

In particular, the elaborate and complex nervous system of amniotes is correlated with the size of their behavioral repertoire. However, the evolutionary mechanisms underlying species-specific brain morphogenesis remain elusive. In this review we introduce reptiles as a new model organism for understanding brain evolution. These animal groups inherited ancestral traits of brain architectures. We will describe several unique aspects of the reptilian nervous system with a special focus on the telencephalon, and discuss the genetic mechanisms underlying reptile-specific brain morphology. The establishment of experimental evo-devo approaches to studying reptiles will help to shed light on the origin of the amniote brains.

These early-diverging phyla are pivotal to understanding the evolution of bilaterian animals. After the exponential increase in research in evolutionary development (evo-devo in the last two decades, these organisms are again in the spotlight of evolutionary biology. In this work, I briefly review some aspects of the developmental biology of nonbilaterians that contribute to understanding the evolution of development and of the metazoans. The evolution of the developmental genetic toolkit, embryonic polarization, the origin of gastrulation and mesodermal cells, and the origin of neural cells are discussed. The possibility that germline and stem cell lineages have the same origin is also examined. Although a considerable number of non-bilaterian species are already being investigated, the use of species belonging to different branches of non-bilaterian lineages and functional experimentation with gene manipulation in the majority of the non-bilaterian lineages will be necessary for further progress in this field.\n\nReconsidering regeneration in metazoans: an evo-devo approach\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nStefano eTiozzo\n\n2015-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Regeneration of body structures is an ability widely but unevenly distributed amongst the animal kingdom. Understanding regenerative biology in metazoans means understanding the multiplicity of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that lead to the differentiation, morphogenesis and ultimately the development of a particular regenerating unit. In this manuscript we critically assess the evolutionary considerations suggesting that regeneration is an ancestral trait rather than a mechanism independently evolved in different taxa. As a general method to test evolutionary hypothesis on regeneration, we propose mechanistically dissecting the regenerative processes according to its conserved chronological steps: wound healing, mobilization of cell precursors and morphogenesis. We then suggest interpreting regenerative biology from an evo-devo perspective, proposing a possible theoretical framework and experimental approaches without necessarily invoking a common origin or only multiple losses of regenerative capabilities.\n\nEvo-devo como disciplina integradora: la temporalidad de los procesos biolÃ³gicos como estrategia de anÃ¡lisis\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nConstanza Alexandra RendÃ³n\n\n2014-08-01\n\nFull Text Available El objetivo del presente trabajo es profundizar el conocimiento acerca de la naturaleza integradora de la evo-devo (biologÃ­a evolutiva del desarrollo.

This is surprising given the often direct connection between flower color and fitness variation mediated through the effects of pollinators. At the same time, ecological and evolutionary genetic studies have utilized the molecular resources available for the anthocyanin pathway to generate several examples of the molecular basis of putatively adaptive transitions in flower color. Despite this opportunity to synthesize experimental approaches in ecology, evolution, and developmental biology, the investigation of many fundamental questions in evo-devo using this powerful model is only at its earliest stages. For example, a long-standing question is whether predictable genetic changes accompany the repeated evolution of a trait. Due to the conserved nature of the biochemical and regulatory control of anthocyanin biosynthesis, it has become possible to determine whether, and under what circumstances, different types of mutations responsible for flower color variation are preferentially targeted by natural selection. In addition, because plants use anthocyanin and related compounds in vegetative tissue for other important physiological functions, the identification of naturally occurring transitions from unpigmented to pigmented flowers provides the opportunity to examine the mechanisms by which regulatory networks are co-opted into new developmental domains. Here, we review what is known about the ecological and molecular basis of anthocyanic flower color transitions in natural systems, focusing on the evolutionary and developmental features involved. In doing so, we provide suggestions for future work on this trait and suggest that there is still much to be learned from the evolutionary development of flower color transitions in nature.\n\nA ABORDAGEM DO PLURALISMO DE PROCESSOS E DA EVO-DEVO EM LIVROS DIDÃTICOS DE BIOLOGIA EVOLUTIVA E ZOOLOGIA DE VERTEBRADOS\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nWellington Bittencourt-dos-Santos\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper reports the results of a comparative content analysis of three evolutionary biology and three vertebrate zoology textbooks, widely adopted in higher education biology courses in many universities of Latin and Anglo-Saxon countries. Using techniques of content analysis, we performed a quali-quantitative documentary analysis of the textbooks, aiming at investigating the treatment and recontextualization of contents related to evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo and process pluralism. Our findings indicate that the recontextualization of contents associated with process pluralism is still in an initial phase in textbooks of both disciplines, even though in a more advanced stage in evolutionary biology textbooks. Regarding evo-devo contents, recontextualization has already taken place in a more extensive manner, particularly in vertebrate zoology textbooks. These results show differences in the construction of pedagogical discourse related to the structure of academic knowledge and the research targets in these disciplines.\n\nFlower color as a model system for studies of plant evo-devo\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJames M Sobel\n\n2013-08-01\n\nFull Text Available Even though pigmentation traits have had substantial impacts on the field of animal evolutionary developmental biology, they have played only relatively minor roles in plant evo-devo.

Professor zur Hausen considers that the creation of an educational platform on Paediatric Virology is definitely very beneficial for young paediatricians, as this will greatly enhance their knowledge in the field of Virology. He very actively advocates the vaccination of boys for the eradication of HPV infection and emphasises that male HPV vaccination should be included into the current vaccination programmes. He would have certainly considered Dr George N. Papanicolaou (Kyme, Island of Euboea, Greece, 1883 - Miami, Florida, USA, 1962) as an excellent candidate for the Nobel Prize, stating that the contribution of Dr Papanicolaou did not find sufficient recognition in the past.

Fortunately, this situation is slowly changing, with a renewed interest in evolutionary developmental pathology (evo-devo-path) in the past decades, as evidenced by the idea to publish this special, and very timely, issue on \"Developmental Evolution in Biomedical Research.\" As all of us have recently been involved, independently, in works related in some way or another with evolution and developmental anomalies, we decided to join our different perspectives and backgrounds in the present contribution for this special issue. Specifically, we provide a brief historical account on the study of the links between evolution, development, and pathologies, followed by a review of the recent work done by each of us, and then by a general discussion on the broader developmental and macroevolutionary implications of our studies and works recently done by other authors. Our primary aims are to highlight the strength of studying developmental anomalies within an evolutionary framework to understand morphological diversity and disease by connecting the recent work done by us and others with the research done and broader ideas proposed by authors such as Ãtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, Waddington, Goldschmidt, Gould, and Per Alberch, among many others to pave the way for further and much needed work regarding abnormal development and macroevolution.

Reptiles represent the first amniotes. From stem reptiles, extant reptiles, birds and mammals have evolved. Mammal hairs and feathers evolved from Therapsid and Sauropsid reptiles, respectively. The early reptilian integument had to adapt to the challenges of terrestrial life, developing a multi-layered stratum corneum capable of barrier function and ultraviolet protection. For better mechanical protection, diverse reptilian scale types have evolved. The evolution of endothermy has driven the convergent evolution of hair and feather follicles: both form multiple localized growth units with stem cells and transient amplifying cells protected in the proximal follicle. This topological arrangement allows them to elongate, molt and regenerate without structural constraints. Another unique feature of reptile skin is the exquisite arrangement of scales and pigment patterns, making them testable models for mechanisms of pattern formation. Since they face the constant threat of damage on land, different strategies were developed to accommodate skin homeostasis and regeneration. Temporally, they can be under continuous renewal or sloughing cycles. Spatially, they can be diffuse or form discrete localized growth units (follicles). To understand how gene regulatory networks evolved to produce increasingly complex ectodermal organs, we have to study how prototypic scale-forming pathways in reptiles are modulated to produce appendage novelties. Despite the fact that there are numerous studies of reptile scales, molecular analyses have lagged behind. Here, we underscore how further development of this novel experimental model will be valuable in filling the gaps of our understanding of the Evo-Devo of amniote integuments.

Similarly, evolutionary ecology has greatly advanced our understanding of the relationship between the phenotype and the environment. To fully understand the evolution of organismal diversity, a thorough integration of these two fields is required. This integration remains highly challenging because model systems offering a rich ecological and evolutionary background, together with the availability of developmental genetic tools and genomic resources, are scarce. In this review, we introduce the semi-aquatic bugs (Gerromorpha, Heteroptera) as original models well suited to study why and how organisms diversify. The Gerromorpha invaded water surfaces over 200 mya and diversified into a range of remarkable new forms within this new ecological habitat. We summarize the biology and evolutionary history of this group of insects and highlight a set of characters associated with the habitat change and the diversification that followed. We further discuss the morphological, behavioral, molecular and genomic tools available that together make semi-aquatic bugs a prime model for integration across disciplines. We present case studies showing how the implementation and combination of these approaches can advance our understanding of how the interaction between genotypes, phenotypes and the environment drives the evolution of distinct morphologies. Finally, we explain how the same set of experimental designs can be applied in other systems to address similar biological questions. Â© The Author 2015.

There is currently no high-spatial-resolution data available profiling gene expression during wood formation for any coniferous species, which limits insight into tracheid development. RNA-sequencing data from replicated, high-spatial-resolution section series throughout the cambial and woody tissues of Picea abies were used to generate the NorWood.conGenIE.org web resource, which facilitates exploration of the associated gene expression profiles and co-expression networks. Integration within PlantGenIE.org enabled a comparative regulomics analysis, revealing divergent co-expression networks between P.Â abies and the two angiosperm species Arabidopsis thaliana and Populus tremula for the secondary cell wall (SCW) master regulator NAC Class IIB transcription factors. The SCW cellulose synthase genes (CesAs) were located in the neighbourhoods of the NAC factors in A.Â thaliana and P.Â tremula, but not in P.Â abies. The NorWood co-expression network enabled identification of potential SCW CesA regulators in P.Â abies.

They provide an interesting system with which to explore the evolution of development within Platyhelminthes and amongst Spiralia (Lophotrochozoa). Unlike most other flatworms, polyclads undergo spiral cleavage (similar to that seen in some other spiralian taxa), they are the only free-living flatworms where development via a larval stage occurs, and they are the only flatworms in which embryos can be reared outside of their protective egg case, enabling embryonic manipulations. Past work has focused on comparing early cleavage patterns and larval anatomy between polyclads and other spiralians. We have selected Maritigrella crozieri, the tiger flatworm, as a suitable polyclad species for developmental studies, because it is abundant and large in size compared to other species. These characteristics have facilitated the generation of a transcriptome from embryonic and larval material and are enabling us to develop methods for gene expression analysis and immunofluorescence techniques. Here we give an overview of M. crozieri and its development, we highlight the advantages and current limitations of this animal as a potential evo-devo model and discuss current lines of research.\n\nEvoluÃ§Ã£o biolÃ³gica: ECO-EVO-DEVO na formaÃ§Ã£o inicial de professores e pesquisadores\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nThais Benetti Oliveira\n\n2017-07-01\n\nFull Text Available A epistemologia Ã© uma Ã¡rea que fornece aportes para reflexÃ£o sobre a natureza e construÃ§Ã£o dos conhecimentos. No que Ã© referente Ã s CiÃªncias BiolÃ³gicas, o conceito de evoluÃ§Ã£o Ã© entendido como um eixo integrador dessa CiÃªncia e, portanto, deve representar a integraÃ§Ã£o das diversas Ã¡reas da Biologia. Um estudo epistemolÃ³gico sobre evoluÃ§Ã£o permite que identifiquemos uma abordagem recente de pesquisa denominada ECO-EVO-DEVO, a qual apresenta um sincronismo entre desenvolvimento, organismo e ambiente no processo evolutivo e na constituiÃ§Ã£o da diversidade fenotÃ­pica. Entendemos que Ã© de ostensiva importÃ¢ncia que essa abordagem seja discutia durante a FormaÃ§Ã£o Inicial de professores e pesquisadores em CiÃªncias BiolÃ³gicas e, portanto, pretendemos investigar meios de representa-la como uma forma a facilitar sua inserÃ§Ã£o na sala de aula. Para a realizaÃ§Ã£o desta investigaÃ§Ã£o, organizamos um Grupo de Pesquisa em Epistemologia da Biologia (GPEB onde foram propostas discussÃµes acerca da evoluÃ§Ã£o biolÃ³gica a partir dessa abordagem. Desta forma, este artigo Ã© sistematizado por meio de trÃªs principais eixos: 1 as caracterÃ­sticas do conhecimento biolÃ³gico integrado; 2 a epistemologia como parte fundamental Ã didÃ¡tica da biologia; 3 o GPEB como um espaÃ§o formativo por meio do qual pÃ´de-se obter dados empÃ­ricos acerca de possibilidades de didatizaÃ§Ã£o do conhecimento biolÃ³gico e 4 a proposiÃ§Ã£o de diagramas para representar o percurso conceitual da abordagem integrada da evoluÃ§Ã£o. Assim, um estudo aprofundado sobre as compilaÃ§Ãµes contemporÃ¢neas acerca da ECO-EVO-DEVO e da pluralidade de processos que envolvem a evoluÃ§Ã£o biolÃ³gica, as discussÃµes no GPEB e a elaboraÃ§Ã£o de diagramas decorrentes da organizaÃ§Ã£o conceitual engendrada pelos participantes do grupo formam estratÃ©gias metodolÃ³gicas que permitiram exemplificar caracterizaÃ§Ãµes sobre a integraÃ§Ã£o dos nÃ­veis biolÃ³gicos no processo evolutivo\n\nThe excluded philosophy of evo-devo? Revisiting C.H. Waddington's failed attempt to embed Alfred North Whitehead's \"organicism\" in evolutionary biology.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPeterson, Erik L\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThough a prominent British developmental biologist in his day, a close friend of Theodosius Dobzhansky, and a frequent correspondent with Ernst Mayr, C.H. Waddington did not enter the ranks of \"architect\" of the Modern Synthesis. By the end of his career, in fact, he recognized that other biologists reacted to his work \"as though they feel obscurely uneasy\"; and that the best that some philosophers of biology could say of his work was that he was not \"wholly orthodox\" (Waddington 1975c, 11). In this essay, I take Waddington's self-assessments at face value and explore three potential reasons why his work did not have more of a direct impact: Waddington's explicit support for the philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead; a lack of institutional support; and Waddington's occasional marginalization from the core network of American neo-Darwinians. Though excluded from the Modern Synthesis in the mid-20th century, it now appears that Waddington's work does undergird the emerging evo-devo synthesis. Whether this indicates concomitant, if implicit, support for Whiteheadian philosophy is an interesting question not explored here.\n\nLA EVO-DEVO COMO CIENCIA HISTÃRICA DE CAUSAS REMOTAS\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nGustavo Caponi\n\n2009-10-01\n\nFull Text Available ABSTRACT EVO-DEVO AS HISTORICAL SCIENCE OF ULTIMATES CAUSES Having as starting point that a proximal cause is one which effects can be registered in the states of an individual organism, in this work I will argue that what defines an ultimate cause is the fact that its effects can be registered in the evolution of lineages, and not simply in population states. This, on the other hand, not only will allow us to clarify how the developmental constraints can be understood as causes of the evolutionary phenomena; but also it will allow us to point the eminently historical character of Developmental Evolutionary Biology that Wallace Arthur lessened in Biased Embryos and Evolution. Thus, and following this latter reasoning, I will also try to show that, although the action of developmental constraints could happen beyond the limits of a population or a particular species, that does not imply that we are before a comeback of typological thought in Evolutionary Biology. Key Words: Evolutionary Developmental Biology; Typological Thought; Ultimate Causes. Â RESUMEN Partiendo de la premisa de que una causa prÃ³xima es aquella cuyos efectos pueden ser registrados en los estados de un organismo individual, en este trabajo sostendrÃ© que lo que define a una causa remota es el hecho de que sus efectos puedan ser registrados en la evoluciÃ³n de linajes, y no simplemente en estados poblacionales. Esto, por otra parte, no sÃ³lo nos permitirÃ¡ entender en quÃ© sentido los constreÃ±imientos ontogenÃ©ticos deben ser comprendidos como causas remotas de los fenÃ³menos evolutivos; sino que ademÃ¡s nos permitirÃ¡ poner en evidencia el carÃ¡cter eminentemente histÃ³rico de la BiologÃ­a Evolucionaria del Desarrollo que Wallace Arthur menoscabÃ³ en Biased Embryos and Evolution.Â AsÃ­, y siguiendo esta Ãºltima lÃ­nea de razonamiento, tambiÃ©n intentarÃ© mostrar que, aunque la acciÃ³n de dichos constreÃ±imientos ontogenÃ©ticos pueda verificarse mÃ¡s allÃ¡ de los l\n\nQuantifying Mosaic Development: Towards an Evo-Devo Postmodern Synthesis of the Evolution of Development via Differentiation Trees of Embryos\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBradly Alicea\n\n2016-08-01\n\nFull Text Available Embryonic development proceeds through a series of differentiation events. The mosaic version of this process (binary cell divisions can be analyzed by comparing early development of Ciona intestinalis and Caenorhabditis elegans. To do this, we reorganize lineage trees into differentiation trees using the graph theory ordering of relative cell volume. Lineage and differentiation trees provide us with means to classify each cell using binary codes. Extracting data characterizing lineage tree position, cell volume, and nucleus position for each cell during early embryogenesis, we conduct several statistical analyses, both within and between taxa. We compare both cell volume distributions and cell volume across developmental time within and between single species and assess differences between lineage tree and differentiation tree orderings. This enhances our understanding of the differentiation events in a model of pure mosaic embryogenesis and its relationship to evolutionary conservation. We also contribute several new techniques for assessing both differences between lineage trees and differentiation trees, and differences between differentiation trees of different species. The results suggest that at the level of differentiation trees, there are broad similarities between distantly related mosaic embryos that might be essential to understanding evolutionary change and phylogeny reconstruction. Differentiation trees may therefore provide a basis for an Evo-Devo Postmodern Synthesis.\n\n05421 Abstracts Collection - Data Always and Everywhere\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nAlonso, G.; Jensen, Christian SÃ¸ndergaard; Mitschang, B.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nFrom 16.10.05 to 21.10.05, the Dagstuhl Seminar 05421, Data Always and Everywhere - Management of Mobile, Ubiquitous, Pervasive, and Sensor Data, was held in the International Conference and Research Center, Schloss Dagstuhl.

Sweden stood out most consistently among the countries that declared Â their opposition to Chile during the period of the Â dictatorship by continuously denouncing the Â violations to human rights. In this context, Swedenâs Ambassador to Chile, Harald Edelstam, played a very important role in saving the lives of Â hundreds of Chilean citizens and foreign nationals Â who sought refuge from the regimeâs bloody Â repression. Making use of the privileges he enjoyed as a diplomat, Edelstam confronted the Â military authorities to release people wrongfully Â sentenced to the death penalty. As a result, he was Â declared persona non grata and forced to leave Â Chile. This was the beginning of a long and controversial diplomatic relationship that lasted until Â the return of democracy in Chile in 1990. This Â article is a first attempt at understanding how Â human rights violations affected bilateral relations Â between Chile and Sweden with respect to the Â diplomatic efforts of Ambassador Harald Edelstam.Â El golpe de Estado en Chile en septiembre de Â 1973 causÃ³ una gran conmociÃ³n internacional Â debido a las esperanzas que tenÃ­an los gobiernos Â occidentales en las reformas que estaba implementando la Unidad Popular.

All chordates have a notochord, at least during embryogenesis, and there is little doubt about notochord homology at the morphological level. A study in BMC Evolutionary Biology now shows that there is greater variability in the molecular genetics underlying notochord development than previously appreciated.

Comparative embryology aimed at recognizing the basic, primary structure that is shared by all vertebrates, either as an archetype or an ancestral developmental pattern. Modern evolutionary developmental (Evo-Devo) studies are also based on comparison, and therefore have a tendency to reduce complex embryonic anatomy into overly simplified patterns.
