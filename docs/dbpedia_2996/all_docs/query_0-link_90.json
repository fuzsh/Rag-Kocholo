This document outlines the content of an ethics course, including 4 units on the nature and scope of ethics. The first unit discusses the nature of moral intuitionism and how humans intuit ethical principles as they search for self-understanding. It also examines the dynamics of morality, noting that while new situations require new ethical responses, certain fundamentals of ethics remain the same given human nature. The document provides context for understanding the philosophical basis of ethics and how moral principles relate to intuition, experience, and human nature.",
