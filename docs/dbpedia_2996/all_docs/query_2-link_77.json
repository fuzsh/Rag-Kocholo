The concepts of microdosimetry and its techniques were developed almost single handedly by H.H. Rossi. This memorial lecture outlines some of the ideas and some of the work of Harald Rossi that led to microdosimetry. It describes its major impact on radiobiology and, especially, its impact on studies with fast neutrons and on risk assessment. Microdosimetry was primarily designed as a tool for the elucidation of basic mechanisms of radiation action, but it has found its most important applications in the dosimetric measurement techniques that have become indispensable in radiation protection and in the dosimetry for radiation therapy. The advances of molecular biology are now providing new possibilities for a quantitative application of microdosimetry to radiobiology along the lines that Harald Rossi defined.

Professor zur Hausen considers that the creation of an educational platform on Paediatric Virology is definitely very beneficial for young paediatricians, as this will greatly enhance their knowledge in the field of Virology. He very actively advocates the vaccination of boys for the eradication of HPV infection and emphasises that male HPV vaccination should be included into the current vaccination programmes. He would have certainly considered Dr George N. Papanicolaou (Kyme, Island of Euboea, Greece, 1883 - Miami, Florida, USA, 1962) as an excellent candidate for the Nobel Prize, stating that the contribution of Dr Papanicolaou did not find sufficient recognition in the past. In the context of the 3rd Workshop on Paediatric Virology, which will be held in Athens, Greece, on October 7th, 2017, Professor zur Hausen will give his plenary lecture on 'Paediatric Virology and Oncology: Virus persistence and the important first years of life'.\n\nEvelin Ilves jÃ¤i lavalaua vahele kontsapidi kinni / Eve Heinla\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nHeinla, Eve, 1966-\n\n2008-01-01\n\n8. mÃ¤rtsil 2008 toimus PÃ¤rnus Endla teatris Eesti Lions klubide heategevusball, kus osales ka heategevusliikumise \"Saa nÃ¤gijaks!\" aupatroon proua Evelin Ilves.

The Â violence and repression that accompanied the Â military coup produced a worldwide repudiation Â of the military junta. Sweden stood out most consistently among the countries that declared Â their opposition to Chile during the period of the Â dictatorship by continuously denouncing the Â violations to human rights. In this context, Swedenâs Ambassador to Chile, Harald Edelstam, played a very important role in saving the lives of Â hundreds of Chilean citizens and foreign nationals Â who sought refuge from the regimeâs bloody Â repression. Making use of the privileges he enjoyed as a diplomat, Edelstam confronted the Â military authorities to release people wrongfully Â sentenced to the death penalty. As a result, he was Â declared persona non grata and forced to leave Â Chile. This was the beginning of a long and controversial diplomatic relationship that lasted until Â the return of democracy in Chile in 1990. This Â article is a first attempt at understanding how Â human rights violations affected bilateral relations Â between Chile and Sweden with respect to the Â diplomatic efforts of Ambassador Harald Edelstam.Â El golpe de Estado en Chile en septiembre de Â 1973 causÃ³ una gran conmociÃ³n internacional Â debido a las esperanzas que tenÃ­an los gobiernos Â occidentales en las reformas que estaba implementando la Unidad Popular.

These pragmatic or modal particles were first discussed in contemporary German grammars by Harald Weydt. Although the concept itself is clear, it is difficult to include such a category in existing grammars, as is shown by the treatment of such inflexible words in different editions of the standard German grammar, Der Duden. It seems difficult to formulate a description of the word class 'particle' in such a way that it includes pragmatic particles as well as other kinds of particles, such as focus particles. This problem is not new, and I also discuss parallels from the history of linguistics.\n\nKnowledge and time\n\nCERN Document Server\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis is a unique volume by a unique scientist, which combines conceptual, formal, and engineering approaches in a way that is rarely seen. Its core is the relation between ways of learning and knowing on the one hand and different modes of time on the other. Partial Boolean logic and the associated notion of complementarity are used to express this relation, and mathematical tools of fundamental physics are used to formalize it. Along the way many central philosophical problems are touched and addressed, above all the mind-body problem.

The focus is on their heuristic importance. The productiveness of analogies is linked to the systematic depth and breadth of the established connections. Various examples are presented from different periods in the history of science, most notably Galileo; such late-Victorian Maxwellians as George Francis FitzGerald and Oliver Lodge; and Heinrich HERTZ and Niels BOHR. These examples are examined in terms of the specific differing temporal ranges of their claimed validities. They serve as evidence or counterevidence for various systematic analyses of analogies as put forward by various philosophers of science, most notably Francis Bacon, John Stuart Mill, Ernst Mach, Harald HÃ¸ffding, Ernest Nagel, Mary Hesse and Peter Achinstein. The analytic framework for analogies supported here is what the cognitive scientist Dedre Gentner has termed structure-mapping.\n\nA Sorry Excuse for an Apology?\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nVilladsen, Lisa Storm\n\nwhere there seems to be clear parallel instances abroad, Danish authorities have refrained from apologizing. A case in point concerns cases where mistreatment of children who were in government-run care have led to official apologies, e.g. former Australian Prime Minster Ruddâs 2008 apology...... to the âStolen Generationsâ and former British Prime Minister Brownâs 2010 apology to migrant children sent abroad. In 2006 the Norwegian parliament, the government, and King Harald apologized for abusive treatment of children in Norwegian orphanages. Most recently, an âatonementâ ceremony was held in Stockholm...... on Nov. 21, 2011 in the presence of officials and Queen Silvia in response to a government sponsored investigation of mistreatment of children in state-run institutions. In Denmark a report documenting mistreatment of children in Danish state-supervised orphanages from 1945 to 1976 was published in May...\n\nThe Danish School of Interior Architecture: A Visionary Functionalist, a Visionary Aesthete, and their Women Students\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nLytken, Malene\n\n2013-01-01\n\nRecently there has been a growing international interest in the history of interior design. Danish design owes much of its international renown to a few prominent architects and their iconic products. One of them was Finn Juhl, who earned an international reputation mainly through his elegant...... furniture design. However, an important aspect of his work has received virtually no attention: his seminal work as a visionary teacher and leader at the school for professional interior design in Copenhagen in the 1940s and 1950s. Harald Willerup, architect as well, and Juhl's equally visionary predecessor......, had initiated this work in 1934, but has remained largely unknown. This article offers a historiographical mapping of the professional education of Danish interior designers in the period from 1934 to 1955âa subject, which has so far remained unexposed.

At this time, HÃ¸ffding also played an important role in disseminating Charles Darwinâs theory of evolution...... and in discussing the philosophical consequences of an evolutionary worldview. In the late 1870s and 1880s several of Spencerâs works were translated into Danish and Swedish and he became a household name among liberal intellectuals who primarily discussed his views on education and evolution. His most influential...... known foreign thinkers in the general public at the time of his death in 1903. Moreover, in the decades around 1900 Spencerâs thoughts on education were part of the curricula at many colleges of education.

The sixteen contributions in this collection by some of the best contemporary philosophers and physicists writing on Bohr's philosophy today all carefully distinguish his subtle and unique interpretation of quantum mechanics from views often imputed to him under the banner of the âCopenhagen Interpretation.â With respect to philosophical influences on Bohr's outlook, the contributors analyse prominent similarities between his viewpoint and Kantian ways of thinking, the views of the Danish philosopher Harald HÃ¸ffding, and themes characteristic of American pragmatism. In recognizing the importance of Bohr's epistemological naturalism they examine his defence of the indispensability of classical concepts from a variety of different perspectives.

In the arrival hall at the airport outside Haugesund the passengers are today faced with the following words: âWelcome to the Homeland of the Viking Kingsâ. The slogan refers to official regional attraction strategies based on a late modern Viking enthusiasm, used in efforts to increase local identity, to enchant a visitor market and to brand the region, in short, to create pride and glory. In this paper, dynamics of heritage production at Haugesund are examined by emphasising how a popular and commercial past (âthe experience societyâ mediates public debates and conflicts, thus questioning the function experts within the field of archaeology and the cultural heritage management have in local communities.\n\nProceedings of scientific instructional conference on local antibiotic therapy on prevention and treatment of infections in orthopaedics and traumatology.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nOkapa, Robert; MarczyÅski, Wojciech; Kolbuszewski, Andrzej\n\n2013-06-13\n\nProceedings of scientific instructional conference which was held on 7th July 2012 in JÃ³zefÃ³w near Warsaw.

As an example of this a modern Danish hymn by Holger Lissner, \"Cain, where is your brother?\"Â is analysed and it is shown how the poet is able to use two...... and images from the Danish nature are used in the hymns. It isÂ furtherÂ shown that modern poets are reluctant to talk about God as a God of history. As something new, Lars Busk SÃ¸rensen combines biblical imagery with philosophical concepts. It is concluded that biblicalÂ normativity is aÂ challenge: \"To live up...... to the biblical norm it must therefore be required of the theologian and the hymnwriter alike that their reading of the biblical message takes place not only as a repetition of the biblical words, but also as a reception and transformation of them.\"...\n\nOptimized construction of biogas plants; Optimierte Bauweise fuer Biogasanlagen\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nNONE\n\n2012-09-19\n\nWithin the conference of the International Trade Fair for Biogas Plant Technology at 21st February, 2012 in Berlin, the following lectures were held: (1) Optimized dimensions of containers for small systems of liquid manure (Manfred Thalmann); (2) Microferm mini biogas plants (Bart Brouwer); (3) Fermentation of stackable biomass in rural biogas plant - The DeNaBa system (Christian Deterding); (4) The Sauter Biogas System for the fermentation of liquid manure, solid dung, and other residual materials (Stefan Sauter); (5) Bio-electricity: Controllable power generation by means of biogas plants (Matthias Sonnleitner); (6) Reduction of the effort and increase of the yield using UDR fixed bed technology (Alfred van den Berg); (7) Prestressed concrete container for biogas plants: Area of application - quality - options (Harald Feldmann); (8) Corrosion protection of agricultural and communal biogas plants (Michael Normann); (9) Fundamentals of efficient and effective flow generation in biogas plants (Kay Rotalski); (10) Rotary piston screw pistons and eccentric screw pumps (Thorsten Gilles).\n\nDie Entdeckung des Higgs-Teilchens oder wie das Universum seine Masse bekam\n\nCERN Document Server\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIm Oktober 2013 setzte der Nobelpreis fÃ¼r Peter Higgs und FranÃ§ois Englert den vorlÃ¤ufigen HÃ¶hepunkt in der verrÃ¼ckten Geschichte um das sogenannte Gottesteilchen, das Higgs-Boson.

This is the c ase of the so-called curator-author. As Harald Szeemann foreshadowed in 1969, the idea was born scarcely two years after Roland Barthes suggested âthe death of the authorâ. Szeemannâs Tableau hypothesizes the possibility of a direct connection between both events, while it also traces the exchanges that took place between art and mediation under the influence of post-minimalism and the dawn of Post-Fordism. This article also explores the attempts made by Seth Siegelaub and Lucy Lippardin with regards to exhibiting methodologies, amplifying the deconstructionist echo of conceptual art rather than retracting it into author positions. Finally, the text analyzes the outstanding role of the publications issued during an especially fruitful time in art-mediation.\n\nBrief history of the Cambridge STEM aberration correction project and its progeny\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nBrown, L.

Ivor Sandstrom coined the term glandulae parathyroidiae. Vassale and Generali Francesco observed that tetany occurs following parathyroidectomy. Harald Salvesen firmly established the relationship of the parathyroid gland to calcium metabolism. A patient with skeletal disease and a tumor near the parathyroid gland was described by Max Askanazy in 1904. Schlagenhaufer suggested in 1915 that in an attempt to cure bone disease, solitary parathyroid enlargement, if present, should be excised. The term hyperparathyroidism (HPT) was coined by Henry Dixon and colleagues. The parathyroid surgeries on Albert J. and Charles Martell were the first experience with successful parathyroidectomy. From a grossly symptomatic disease of bones, stones, abdominal groans, and psychic moans, HPT has evolved into asymptomatic HPT. Improvements in knowledge about the pathology of parathyroid diseases, including the genetic basis of HPT, and advances in the surgical techniques have brought about changes in the management of HPT over the decades.

Successful Lean leaders appear to use a coaching leadership style that shares underlying principles with servant leadership. There is little information about specific similarities and differences between Lean and servant leaderships. We systematically reviewed the literature on Lean leadership, servant leadership, and health care and performed a comparative analysis of attributes using Russell and Stoneâs leadership framework. We found significant overlap between the two leadership styles, although there were notable differences in origins, philosophy, characteristics and behaviors, and tools. We conclude that both Lean and servant leaderships are promising models that can contribute to the delivery of patient-centered, high-value care. Servant leadership may provide the means to engage and develop employees to become successful Lean leaders in health care organizations.

We discuss different existing methods to manipulate the phase of the electron wave and their limitations. We show how with the help of current techniques the electron wave can already be crafted into specific classes of waves each having their own peculiar properties. Assuming a versatile phase modulation device is feasible, we explore possible benefits and methods that could come into existence borrowing from light optics where the so-called spatial light modulators provide programmable phase plates for quite some time now. We demonstrate that a fully controllable phase plate building on Harald Rose's legacy in aberration correction and electron optics in general would open an exciting field of research and applications. - Highlights: â¢ We offer a review of available phase manipulation techniques. â¢ We demonstrate a method for producing Airy waves through aberration manipulation. â¢ We outline hypothetical applications of arbitrary phase manipulation methods\n\nKes peaks tagama seaduste tÃ¤itmise? / Inge TimoÅ¡tÅ¡uk, Volli Kalm, Maiki Udam ; Ã¼les kirjutanud Ãlo Tikk\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nTimoÅ¡tÅ¡uk, Inge, 1970-\n\n2001-01-01\n\nVene koolidel kÃ¤ib PÃµhikooli- ja GÃ¼mnaasiumiseaduse Â§ 52 teise lÃµike \"Riigi- ja munitsipaalgÃ¼mnaasiumides alustatakse Ã¼leminekut eesti Ãµppekeelele hiljemalt 2007/08.

La razÃ³n la encontramos en los distintos fenÃ³menos polÃ­ticos que viviÃ³ Chile en ese periodo, puesto que Palme coincidiÃ³ temporalmente con tres gobiernos claramente diferenciados: la Democracia Cristiana, la Unidad Popular y el RÃ©gimen Militar. Si las relaciones sueco-chilenas tuvieron su mejor momento durante el mandato de Salvador Allende, el golpe de Estado significÃ³ todo lo contrario. El compromiso que tuvo el embajador de Suecia, Harald Edelstam, por quienes eran perseguidos en Chile le llevÃ³ a su expulsiÃ³n, lo que se tradujo en un claro deterioro de las relaciones y el inicio de una nueva etapa marcada por el gran contingente de exiliados que comenzaron a llegar a Suecia.

The first step, early in 1973, consisted of the development of a programme for the loan of Cf-252 sources to the Member States in support of education, training and some limited research. To date, 14 institutions in 13 Member States have participated in this loan programme. In August last year, the Agency published an instructional syllabus and laboratory manual authored by Professors Eric J. Hall and Harald H. Rossi of Columbia University (Californium-252 in Teaching and Research, Technical Reports Series No. 159). The appearance of this publication, including guidance on the design and construction of a storage and use facility, was the second phase of this programme aimed at providing some support to potential users in the fields of radiation biology and dosimetry. The objective of the programme's third phase - the convening of an Educational Seminar - was to provide a forum to bring together participants in the Agency's loan programme and experts in various scientific fields. Specifically, the Seminar consisted of a series of expert presentations in spectrometry, activation and prompt gamma analyses, on-stream analysis, dosimetry, health physics, radiology and radiotherapy.

Inst. fuer Astronomie und Astrophysik\n\n2013-07-01\n\nHiggs - that is a physicist, a field, a particle. 1964 only the idea of Peter Higgs and some other physicists existed: A theory for specialists of particle physics. Since the 1980th years then in the underground at Geneva the largest machine of mankind was built - consisting of a nearly 27 kilometers long ring tunnel and gigantic detectors. In this enormous facility, called LHC (Large Hadron Collider), particles were accelerated nearly to light velocity. In its collisions they should produce the predicted Higgs particle. Finally in 2012 the detection succeeded - the Higgs particle exists really. And also a Higgs field exists. It penetrates the whole cosmos and mediates to the particles the property of the rest mass. Nearly men have never came to the big bang. And Peter Higgs received 2013 with Francois Englert the Nobel prize of physics. Harald Lesch and his coworkers report from the expensive search for the Higgs particle, the theoretical conditions and consequences for the particle physics. They clarify what it's called ''God particle'' or fears about a black hole arising in the LHC experiment.

All are plagioclase-K-feldspar-biotite granitoids with additional muscovite, garnet and/or hornblende, and are subalkaline and peraluminous. Berg Granite typifies the early Ordovician, Granite Harbour Instrusive (GHI) suite of the Ross Orogen at the Oates Coast. Granitoids from Kartografov Island have higher amounts of Fe+Mg+Ti and an ambiguous Rb-Sr geochronology: they could be either pre-Ross Orogeny in age, or syn-Ross Orogeny and representing a lower structural level of GHI. The Drake Head granite gneiss has a fractionated leuco-granite composition similar to Berg Granite, and is intruded by granite and granodiorite. Rb-Sr ages indicate that all are Neoproterozoic, although the granite gneiss result is probably an errorchron age, reflecting its less uniform nature (granodiorite:649 Â± 30 Ma, initial ratio 0.7065 +/- 6; granite gneiss: 682 Â± 140 Ma, initial ratio 0.7107 Â± 50). These late Neoproterozoic granitoids provide a source for distinctive detrital zircon age components in extensive early Paleozoic turbidites of Australia-New Zealand-Antarctica.

STAM was founded in 2000. In 2005 NIMS took over the management of its peer review and financial systems, resulting in a continuous rise of the impact of the journal. Empa will provide further support for the editorial management of STAM. In particular, it will establish a European office in Switzerland and reinforce the Editorial Board. From this point of view, I am pleased and excited to have new colleagues from Empa on our Editorial Board, and I believe that this collaboration will bring us a remarkable improvement in the international visibility of STAM and increase the number of paper submissions from Europe. It will expand the topics covered in the journal from traditional fields of materials science with a focus on energy and environmental issues to medical and bioengineering applications, where Empa has a significant expertise. I firmly believe that Empa's participation in publishing STAM will reinforce its position as an open-access journal with a global audience. Together with my colleagues, Yoshio Sakka (NIMS) and Shu Yamaguchi (University of Tokyo), I welcome Harald F Krug as the new Co-Editor-in-Chief of STAM. I am also pleased to learn that the year 2014 not only marks the 15th anniversary of STAM, but also the 150th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Japan and Switzerland. Toyonobu Yoshida Advances in materials science are key for the sustainable development of our society. That is why, starting from January 2014, Empa, the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, have engaged in an entirely new field of activity: scientific publishing. As mentioned above, Empa joined NIMS in the publishing of STAM.

From a pragmatic perspective the interrogative structures does not seem to be compatible with the contexts of scientific interaction: scientists do not ask for information, but they offer their own solutions for the problem situations. This is reflected in the extremely low frequency of questions in academic research articles and monographs. Their text frequency works out a little over 2 % of the total number of the text predications and that of direct questions is about 1 %. Therefore, their place in verbalization of scientific knowledge in linguistics is metaphorically characterized in this article as Â«interrogative prohibitionÂ» by analogy with the Â«prohibitionsÂ» of Harald Weinrich who introduced several notions point to rarely used linguistic units: Â«prohibition of authorizationÂ» â das Â«Ich-VerbotÂ», Â«narrative prohibitionÂ» â das Â«ErzÃ¤hl-VerbotÂ»; Â«prohibition of metaphorsÂ»â das Â«MetaphernVerbotÂ». In its turn, low frequency makes the analyzed structures an effective tool to formulate the discussed problems, enables further argumentation, integrate the current text into overall linguistic discourse, control the development of the argumentation in scientific text and finally to draw the recipient's attention to a crucial or unexpected argument.\n\nMonument protection and energy conservation.

A Report produced for the GAMBIT Club\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRodwell, W.R.\n\n2005-11-01\n\nIn order to review the status of understanding of gas migration in bentonite, and particularly the experimental data that provides the basis for such understanding as exists, the GAMBIT Club organised a workshop of invited participants that was held in Madrid during 29-30 October 2003. (The GAMBIT Club is a consortium of radioactive waste management agencies: SKB, ANDRA, Enresa, JNC, Nagra, and Posiva.)

(The GAMBIT Club is a consortium of radioactive waste management agencies: SKB, ANDRA, Enresa, JNC, Nagra, and Posiva.)

However, the quality of the obtained slices depends among other things on artifacts generated by dental restorations as well as orthodontic and prosthetic appliances. The aim of the study was to quantify the artifacts produced by standard prosthetic inlays in CBCT images. The material consisted of 17 standard prosthetic inlays mounted in dental roots embedded in resin. The samples were examined by means of a large field of view CBCT unit, Galileos (Sirona, Germany, at 85 kV and 14 mAs. The analysis was performed using Able 3DDoctor software for data in the CT raster space as well as by means of Materialise Magics software for generated vector models (STL. The masks generated in the raster space included the area of the inlays together with image artifacts. The region of interest (ROI of the raster space is a set of voxels from a selected range of Hounsfield units (109-3071. Ceramic inlay with zirconium dioxide (Cera Post as well as epoxy resin inlay including silica fibers enriched with zirconium (Easy Post produced the most intense artifacts. The smallest image distortions were created by titanium inlays, both passive (Harald Nordin and active (Flexi Flange. Inlays containing zirconium generated the strongest artifacts, thus leading to the greatest distortions in the CBCT images. Carbon fiber inlay did not considerably affect the image quality.\n\nNILU - Annual Report 1995; Norsk institutt for luftforskning - aarsrapport 1995\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nNONE\n\n1996-10-01\n\nThis is the annual report for 1995 from NILU. NILU does research work, develops methods and performs evaluations of all kinds of air pollution. The field of operations ranges from local air conditions (indoors, in streets, and in the local environment) to global problems relating to changes in the ozone layer and climate changes. The institute, which participates in many international research projects, obtained 13 new contracts in 1995. NILU is the coordinator of three EU projects. Unlike the universities, which receive up to 100% financial support from EU, NILU receives only 50% and must provide the rest itself. The report surveys briefly the projects in which NILU is currently involved. These include projects in Poland, Russia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Spain, Botswana, Egypt, Mauritius, China, India, Chile Venezuela. A modern monitoring system for air quality, AirQUIS, was installed in Oslo. NILU is participating in the EUREKA project MEMbrain, which is an emergency system for use in disasters and catastrophes such as for instance nuclear accidents. A new model called FOTOPLUME has been developed, which is a Gaussian dispersion model. It has been used to calculate the effect of the emissions from offshore oil installations on the ozone concentration and the deposition of Nitrogen compounds in areas close to the coast. There is a full list of papers, reports etc. published by NILU in 1995. A notable event in 1995 was the visit to NILU by the Polish president Lech Walesa accompanied by Norway`s king Harald. 31 figs., 1 table\n\nMeissner effects, vortex core states, and the vortex glass phase transition\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHuang, Ming.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThis thesis covers three topics involving Meissner effects and the resulting defect structures. The first is a study of Meissner effects in superconductivity and in systems with broken translational symmetry. The Meissner effect in the superconductors is a rigidity against external magnetic field caused by the breaking of the gauge symmetry. Other condensed matter systems also exhibit rigidities like this: The breaking of the translational symmetry in a cubic-liquid-crystal causes the system to expel twist deformations and the breaking of the translational symmetry in a nematic liquid crystal gives it a tendency to expel twist and bend deformations. In this thesis, the author studies these generalized Meissner effects in detail. The second is a study of the quasiparticle states bound to the vortex defect in superconductors. Scanning-tunneling-microscope measurements by Harald Hess et al. of the local density of states in a vortex core show a pronounced peak at small bias. These measurements contradict with previous theoretical calculations. Here, he solves the Bogoliubov equations to obtain the local density of states in the core and satisfactorily explain the experimental observations. He also predicted additional structure in the local density of states which were later observed in experiments. The third is a study of vortex dynamics in the presence of disorder. A mean field theory is developed for the recently proposed normal to superconducting vortex glass transition. Using techniques developed to study the critical dynamics of spin glasses, he calculates the mean field vortex glass phase boundary and the critical exponents\n\nAlannah Coleman: 1970âA Year at Bonythonâs Sydney Gallery\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSimon Pierse\n\n2018-03-01\n\nFull Text Available When art dealer and entrepreneur Kym Bonythonâs new gallery opened in Sydney in 1967, it was believed to be the largest commercial gallery in the southern hemisphere. In early 1970, Bonython brought Melbourne-born art dealer Alannah Coleman over from London to take on the management of his gallery. Sadly, her appointment was not a success and lasted less than a year. Coleman re-organised the records and accounts along European lines and tried to put the gallery on a firm financial footing, but she met with opposition from staff, artists and Bonython himself. Bonython wanted the gallery as a showcase for new talent and was always on the lookout to spot âthe next goerâ. The opening parties at Bonythonâs deplored by Coleman as âopen slatherâ evenings proved to be significant social events and the focus for cultural exchange, whilst in his solo shows, Brett Whiteley made innovative use of the gallery as a âtheatreâ, combining painting and sculpture with light and sound to transform the exhibition into a completely new synesthetic experience. In 1971, with funding from John Kaldorâs Public Art Project scheme, Swiss curator and gallerist Harald Szeemann used the Bonython Gallery to stage a groundbreaking show of conceptual art that went on to show at the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne. Without a regular external source of sponsorship or support, however, Colemanâs fears for the financial viability of the gallery were eventually proved right when, after several further years of losses, it finally closed in 1976.\n\nColor in present culture of European architecture\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSchindler, Verena M.\n\n2002-06-01\n\nThe influential architect Le Corbusier (1887 - 1965) was also involved in the adventure of contemporary painting, and color occupied half of his day, during twenty years, as he revealed in a study entitled 'Architectural Polychromy' written in the early thirties and recently published in 1997. In the present, contemporary architects in Central Europe are dealing with color in quite a different and exceptional way: most of them engage the artist to collaborate with them in their architectural projects. If painting is concerned with the interaction of color in the two-dimensional plane, architecture is deeply dependent on light and space, and deals entirely with the three- dimensional environment and its human perception. In the 1990s, the way architects and artists employed color in architecture was so striking that color offered a key to larger discussions and opened up an interesting aspect of architectural practice. It must be remembered that recent housing projects, such as the housing estate Pilotengasse in Vienna, Gigon & Guyer's Broelberg in Kilchberg (with Harald F. Muller), next to Zurich, and their Sport Center in Davos (with Adrian Schiess), Jean Nouvel's Cultural and Congress Center in Lucerne, or Sauerbruch & Hutton's Photonic Center and their GSW office building in Berlin have all been contributing to free color from its unconscious and dormant role. These works all impart qualities to color in architecture that were hitherto reserved to other materials and fields: they define the aspects of the interaction of visual and physical space, of materialization of volumes, and of the expression of wealth and luxury.\n\nPÃµhiÃµiguste ja -vabaduste kaitse Riigi InfosÃ¼steemi Ameti jÃ¤relevalve volituste laiendamisel : magistritÃ¶Ã¶ / Helen Ojamaa-Muru ; juhendaja Eneken Tikk ; Tartu Ãlikool, Ãµigusteaduskond, avaliku Ãµiguse osakond\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nOjamaa-Muru, Helen\n\n2018-01-01\n\nEesti korrakaitseÃµiguse ning pÃµhiÃµiguste ja -vabaduste kaitse teoreetilistest alustest, kÃ¼berruumi turvalisust mÃµjutavatest suundumustest, kÃ¼berturvalisuse valdkonnas rakendatavate riikliku jÃ¤relevalve meetmetest pÃµhiÃµiguste ja -vabaduste kaitse seisukohast\n\nBook Reviews\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nYu.
