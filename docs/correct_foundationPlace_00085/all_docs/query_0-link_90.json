        "text": "Brothers Osborne, Dan + Shay with Justin Bieber, Keith Urban, and Morgan Wallen have been added to the list of performers at the 54th annual CMA Awards taking place next week.\n\nJason Aldean, Jimmie Allen, Ingrid Andress, Dierks Bentley, Jenee Fleenor, Little Big Town, Old Dominion, Jon Pardi, Carly Pearce and Lee Brice will also take the stage on 11/11 in Nashville.\n\nBrothers Osborne, Aldean Bentley, reigning CMA Musician of the Year Fleenor, and reigning CMA New Artist of the Year Ashley McBryde will open the show with a tribute to Charlie Daniels. Little Big Town will pay tribute to Kenny Rogers, and Pardi will perform in honor of Joe Diffie.\n\nDan + Shay will be joined by Bieber, making the world television premiere of their three-time nominated “10,000 Hours.” CMA Awards Executive Producer Robert Deaton says, “As safety is our top priority, we have worked tirelessly over the past several months to fully transform Music City Center into a breathtaking setup that resembles the very first ‘CMA Awards Banquet & Show’ from 1967, and ensures our nominees, performers and their guests a fully safe and physically distant environment. We are honored, in this very challenging time, to help provide an escape and deliver a live awards show experience unlike any other this year.”\n\nWarner Nashville’s Ashley McBryde and the CMA Foundation have partnered together to launch Unified Voices for Music Education’s Artist Ambassador program.\n\nThe inaugural program expands the organization’s awareness and advocacy efforts in support of music educators, students and teachers.\n\nAs the first UVfME Artist Ambassador, the CMA Award-winning country star will use her voice to advocate for music awareness throughout the month of November. Prior to stardom, McBryde attended college with hopes of becoming a Band Director.\n\nMcBryde recently appeared on The Kelly Clarkson Show to share details the program before performing her single, “Martha Divine.” Through her involvement with UVfME, she will work with music educators to create original band-specific video lesson plan, discuss challenges faced during this time and share how music education led to her career, among other things.\n\n“Music education has always been a big part of my life and has had an enormous impact on the musician and writer I am today. It is a career highlight to be a small part of a program that will better allow teachers and students a chance to engage with music education during such unprecedented times,” shared McBryde.\n\n“Ashley’s passion for music is evident in her career as a Country artist and her enthusiasm for music education is unmatched. We are excited for her to be involved with the UVfME initiative throughout November, as she finds creative ways to encourage music educators during this time and develops resources for students to access nationwide,” added Tiffany Kerns, CMA Foundation Executive Director.\n\nThe CMA Foundation will continue to provide resources and support music educators through UVfME, with more artist ambassadors to be revealed in the coming months.

His production provides the space for the artist to interpret in their own way.”\n\n\"I'm really excited to be part of such an amazing team they have really made me feel at home and welcomed,” shared Cobb.\n\nCobb is managed by Andrew Brightman at Brightman Music.\n\nPhoto credit: Becky Fluke\n\nGabby Barrett, Luke Combs, Maren Morris and Thomas Rhett are among the first round.

He was 81.\n\nOur dear friend Holly Gleason has written a heartfelt remembrance of the man and his work. \"An almost primitive writer, capable of great poetry and earth-cracking truths, Shaver’s gift was an odd gentleness, a vulnerability that recognized the failings of our mortal coil matched with a hell-raising, take-no-shit kind of reckless good-timing,\" she writes. You can read Holly's soulful essay, \"I'm Gonna Catch Tomorrow Now: Billy Joe Shaver's Rowdy Tonk for Believers,\" in its entirety here.\n\n17-year-old Liam Coleman has inked a management deal with Marathon Talent Agency.

I couldn’t ask for a better team to work with,” shared Coleman.\n\nStrickland added, “When I first saw Liam perform, I was blown away by his voice and how he sounded well beyond his years. His drive for excellence and his passion for music is a perfect fit with Marathon Talent and we look forward to building a long career together.”\n\nThe singer/songwriter plans on spending time in the studio with producer Ken Royster (Luke Combs, Cowboy Troy) early next year.\n\nRCA Nashville/Zone 4’s Kane Brown has been tapped to perform at the halftime show for the Dallas Cowboys’ game against Washington Football Team on 11/26. Brown made the announcement during The Late Late Show with James Corden on CBS.\n\nHeld at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, the televised performance highlights a decades long tradition of supporting The Salvation Army’s Red Kettle Campaign. This year also marks the first time the campaign has kicked off early through digital fundraising efforts to support the need from the pandemic.\n\nMoney raised during the campaign provides shelter and meals for the homeless and hungry, Christmas toys for children and social service programs to millions of people in need. Last year, it raised $126m.\n\n“There were times growing up when my family did not have enough to eat, or a roof over our head, and today, there are so many people in need. 2020 has been a hard year, but every small act of generosity helps,” shared Brown.\n\n“Kane’s music has a way of inspiring hope, and we’re excited to have him on our national stage for an incredible halftime performance this year,” added Charlotte Jones Anderson, EVP and Chief Brand Officer for the Cowboys and former National Advisory Board Chairperson for The Salvation Army.\n\nBrown joins a list of previous performers including Selena Gomez, Eric Church, Luke Bryan, Kenny Chesney, Thomas Rhett, Keith Urban, the Jonas Brothers, Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, Sheryl Crow, Destiny’s Child, Reba McEntire and more.\n\nTo donate, text KETTLE to 91999 or click here.
