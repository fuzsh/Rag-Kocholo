        "text": "Today we are proud to celebrate the opening of Brunson Liberty House with our longtime partner Bridge Over Troubled Waters. This home represents a critical next step in Bridge‚Äôs continuum of support for young people experiencing homelessness. By providing a safe, affordable home for its residents, Brunson Liberty House will enable formerly homeless youth to focus on their education and career, further cementing a path to living independently. The Brunson Liberty House in Brighton, MA is named after Richard Brunson, whose unwavering commitment to supporting young people made lasting impact at Bridge. It will provide a stable and nurturing environment for up to nine young people who have successfully completed other Bridge programs. Congratulations Elisabeth Jackson and the entire Bridge team for your continued commitment to helping young people transform their lives and build fulfilling, meaningful futures. https://lnkd.in/dcafvc2Q\n\nThis week, we welcomed Boston Mayor Michelle Wu to Liberty Mutual Insurance‚Äôs Boston office, where we‚Äôve been headquartered for more than 100 years. We had the opportunity to discuss topics impacting our employees, dive into Mayor Wu‚Äôs inspirational journey to where she is now and discuss our history with the City of Boston. We also discussed our shared commitments to the community that reflect Liberty‚Äôs purpose to help people embrace today and confidently pursue tomorrow. Equitable access to high-quality educational opportunities and safe and secure housing have long been a priority for us. We‚Äôre proud of the work we‚Äôve done through Liberty Mutual Foundation to help individuals move from shelter to housing, and our partnerships that support educational institutions in the city. We have a 50-year partnership with Charlestown High School, where we provide college prep and year-round internships and jobs, and are working with the city to help Franklin Cummings Tech build a state-of-the-art new building in Nubian Square in Roxbury. I‚Äôve also personally had the opportunity to see the work of so many great organizations in Boston ‚Äì including Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program, Community Servings, Women's Lunch Place and Pine Street Inn ‚Äì that are doing herculean work to help some of our most vulnerable communities. Thank you, Mayor Wu, for your work on these important issues and dedication to making the City of Boston a thriving community.\n\nWe‚Äôre proud to support The Sportsmen‚Äôs Tennis & Enrichment Center‚Äîa Boston-based nonprofit that provides free and low-cost tennis instruction, academics and life skills programming to low-income youth. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs such an honor to share that, this year, we‚Äôve aced it! üèÜ The Center has chosen to honor us with their 2023 Community Builder Award. On November 2, Liberty Mutual‚Äôs National Director of Programs, Bryan Spence accepted the award, calling it ‚Äúsuch a privilege for Liberty Mutual to be recognized by our long term partner that is so dedicated to service and helping youth succeed.‚Äù To delve deeper into our Community Investment initiatives, visit http://spr.ly/6041ufOPS. #LifeAtLiberty #WorkAtLiberty\n\nLiberty Mutual Foundation is thrilled to make a $1.5 million grant to HopeWell Inc to support the purchase of a new property in Brighton, MA. This three-unit house will help increase stability for young adults aging out of the foster care system through the expansion of the My First Place‚Ñ¢ program. With nearly 50% of youth aging out of foster care experiencing homelessness within 18 months of exiting the system, this home can change lives by providing safe, reliable housing while helping young people pave pathways to success. Thank you, HopeWell, for your deep commitment to addressing the needs of youth experiencing foster care; we are proud to partner with you! https://lnkd.in/eF9g6Rs6"
