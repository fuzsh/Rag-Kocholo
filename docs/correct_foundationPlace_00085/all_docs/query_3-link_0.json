All contributions are tax-deductible to the fullest extent allowed by law.\n\nBelieve In Tomorrow is proud to adhere to the highest standards of fiscal responsibility. Through rigorous independent annual reviews, Believe In Tomorrow has been certified to meet the highest standards of public accountability, program effectiveness, and fiscal responsibility.\n\nOur Founder and Board\n\nBrian Morrison, Founder and President of Believe In Tomorrow Children’s Foundation, strives to discover creative solutions to meet the needs of children and families undergoing treatment for life threatening illnesses. In 1982, Brian started a volunteer effort to help these children and families, which quickly grew and expanded into a nonprofit organization.\n\nBrian’s vision led Believe In Tomorrow to develop the first and only pediatric respite facilities in the United States in 1986, followed closely by a hospital housing program for families of children receiving treatment at the world-renowned Johns Hopkins Children’s Center. Under Brian’s leadership, the organization also developed the first long-term residential facility for pediatric bone marrow transplant patients and their families.\n\nBeyond the office, Brian is an avid hiker and enjoys hiking adventures in the Grand Canyon, often coupled with a fundraising effort to benefit Believe In Tomorrow programs. A father to five sons, Brian enjoys spending time with them.\n\nBrian has served on a number of national, regional, and community non-profit boards, including the National Association of Hospital Hospitality Houses, Children First – America’s Charities, and Children’s Charities of America.\n\nOfficers:\n\nChairman Richard E.
