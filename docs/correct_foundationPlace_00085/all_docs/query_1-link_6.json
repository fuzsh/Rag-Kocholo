For many, traditional family support was an ocean away, meaning unexpected accidents or epidemics led to shattered families. In 1879, the local business community came together to establish the Island City Protestant and Israelitish Orphans Asylum. The orphanage later dropped its religious affiliation and was renamed the Galveston Orphans Home.\n\nConnect With The Bryan Museum\n\nYou can follow The Bryan Museum on any of our social media pages below.
