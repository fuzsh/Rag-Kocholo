        "text": "The aim of the present paper is to examine, whether the ancient Egyptian kings knew how to read and write. By analysing the textual and iconographical material from various periods of Egyptian history the author argues that most of the Egyptian rulers were indeed literate. This view is supported not only by the sources directly mentioning royal literacy or making clear allusions to it but also by some indirect evidence indicating the literacy of particular rulers (like holding important administrative offices by certain kings prior to their accessions). The author discusses also the problem of the education of the future kings and consequently concludes that royal princes were taught both hieratic and hieroglyphic scripts for practical as well as ideological reasons. As for the kings of foreign origin it seems that, although many of them were not only illiterate but even unable to speak Egyptian, at least some of them could have mastered the Egyptian script.\n\nThe structure of the New Kingdom necropolis at Saqqara and the distribution of individual tombs therein have been the subject of a number of studies. It has been suggested that the location of some tombs depended on family relations and professional association. In the area south of the Unas causeway, a notable clustering of tombs constructed for the higher administrative personnel of the Theban Ramesseum can be observed. The title holders include the (Great) Overseers of Cattle, Overseers of the Treasury, and (Chief) Stewards. This paper presents an overview of the archaeological and textual sources from Saqqara pertaining to these officials; it aims to present a prosopography of the Memphite officials who held office at the Ramesseum, and to address the question why these officials were buried not in the Theban necropolis, but at Memphis.\n\nTomb Painting and Identity in Ancient Thebes, 1419-1372 BCE examines the style, iconography, and symbolism of painting in all extant private Theban tomb chapels decorated during the reigns of Thutmose IV and Amenhotep III. The book studies the ways in which pictorial imagery functioned on behalf of the dead in the afterlife, presented their identity to the living, and revealed underlying religious developments with important societal implications. Various aspects of the pre-Amarna Theban tomb are explored, from the tomb’s purpose as a creative and commemorative vehicle for the deceased to the placement and functional properties of its imagery. The book also discusses the different styles of painting in the chapels of state and religious officials and how these styles reveal workshop organization and “patronage” practices in Thebes. The majority of the book is dedicated to the iconography of the functioning image in the tomb chapel, its reception, and its purpose as a bridge between what was represented and what was signified, between the mundane and the sacred, and between the living and the dead. Particular attention is paid to the iconography on the “western” back walls of the transverse hall in T-shaped tomb chapels, walls that held aesthetic, cultic, and symbolic significance to the ancient Egyptians. On these walls as well as the northern or southern long wall in rectangular tomb chapels, iconography and text commemorated the deceased’s personal and professional identity, projected this identity into the hereafter, and contained key components for the tomb owner’s rebirth. The eternal well-being of the deceased was secured through the iconography of gift giving that also mirrored religious trends that permeated society. Tomb Painting and Identity in Ancient Thebes, 1419-1372 BCE addresses Theban tomb painting and its underlying creative and commemorative properties as a medium of regeneration, preservation, and display on behalf of the tomb owner and the world of which he was a part\n\nThis article examines the interaction between Ay and Horemheb and their attitudes towards one another. Under Tutankhamun, Ay was the fatherly advisor of the king at the court, while Horemheb was the actual governor of all the administration in the country. However, Ay seems to have obtained the title “Vizier,” indicating that he was also capable of governing the country. Ay was indeed on the verge of becoming the successor of Tutankhamun. There was strong antagonism between Ay and Horemheb sometime after Tutankhamun's death. The evidence implies that Horemheb sought to discredit Ay as proper successor to the king. As a result, Ay appears to have excluded Horemheb from greater courtly influence by appointing Nakhtmin not only as his “Generalissimo” but also as “King's Son.” This squabbling even continued after Ay's death as Horemheb endeavored to erase all memory of Ay, his men, and even Queen Ankhesenamun in revenge."
