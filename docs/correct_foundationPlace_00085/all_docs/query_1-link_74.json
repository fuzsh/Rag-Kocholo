Miller Business Quadrangle – home of the Edwin L. Cox School of Business – provides the facilities needed to prepare students for an ever-more collaborative and technologically integrated world. Enter our virtual experience to discover the new classrooms and collaborative spaces in our new facilities.\n\nThanks to our community of donors who are igniting the future of business education, the new and renovated facilities of the Cox School of Business will inspire students, welcome visitors and promote new ways of approaching unique opportunities and thought-provoking challenges. We celebrated our donors during the dedication of the David B. Miller Business Quadrangle on May 3, 2024.\n\nView photos"
