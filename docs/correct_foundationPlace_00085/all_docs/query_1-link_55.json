        "text": "The Community Foundation DeKalb County and you, our donors, have an incredible opportunity in 2024 and 2025. Lilly Endowment Inc., as part of their GIFT (Giving Indiana Funds for Tomorrow) VIII Initiative, has agreed to donate $2 for every $1 donated to the Community Grantmaking Endowment Fund. This is the fund that supports the majority of the quarterly grants to local and regional nonprofits and charitable organizations. If we raise $250,000 then Lilly will match with $500,000 for a total of $750,000 to add to the Community Grantmaking Endowment Fund.\n\nLocal and regional nonprofits work hard to address many community issues like food and housing scarcity, mental health issues, resources for early learning, veterans’ needs, addiction recovery, and so much more.\n\nPlease take advantage of this incredible opportunity and donate to support our nonprofits and our county!\n\nThe Community Foundation provides a way for you to invest in the community’s future by creating permanent support for the charitable programs and organizations you care about. When an endowed fund is created, these gifts are invested for growth and income. Each year part of the fund’s growth is returned to the community in the form of grants for specific initiatives, events, or programs of area non-profit organizations. And each year a portion of the fund’s growth is reinvested to ensure that the fund will remain active forever.\n\nSince the Foundation’s creation in 1996, donors like you have helped build just over $23 million in permanent and non-permanent endowment funds that grant over $889,000 a year to worthy local causes. These grant dollars strengthen our community and make life better for all of us who live, work, and play in DeKalb County."
