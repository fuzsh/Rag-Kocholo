And of the 153 million, many suffer from abuse, neglect, or exploitation—a reality that no child should experience. The Tim Tebow Foundation provides for the physical and spiritual care of children who have been left homeless or abandoned, as well as resources to create strong families and adoption assistance, all to protect children from these vulnerabilities and give them hope for a secure future.\n\nSpecial Needs Ministry\n\n56\n\nCountries We Serve In\n\n625,000+\n\nHonored Guests Celebrated\n\n700+\n\nChildren Receiving Education and Care\n\nIt is estimated that 16% of the world’s population lives with a disability. Considered some of the world’s most vulnerable people, they are often denied the same opportunities as their peers to feel valued as a part of not only the life of their local community but also in the life of the Church. In many countries around the globe, people with disabilities are viewed as a burden, worthless, or even cursed. However, God greatly loves and values these precious people and so does the Tim Tebow Foundation. In this love, TTF is on mission to change the narrative.\n\nProfound Medical Needs\n\n4\n\nCountries We Serve In\n\n110+\n\nOfficial W15H Experiences\n\n10,100+\n\nLife-Changing Surgeries\n\n11,760+\n\nExpressions of Faith\n\n11\n\nTimmy's Playrooms\n\nEven in today’s modern world, there are regions with significantly little access to quality medical care or, in even more places, an inability for families to afford it if it is available. Through strategic, official ministry partnerships, the foundation has helped build and operate medical facilities in the Philippines, Zimbabwe, and the Peruvian jungles. By partnering with pioneers in developing countries to provide spiritual and medical healing, the foundation is able to meet the needs of thousands of vulnerable people every year.\n\nAnti-Human Trafficking + Child Exploitation\n\n16\n\nCountries We Serve In\n\n43\n\nSafe Homes Operating Worldwide\n\n500+\n\nTotal Survivor Capacity Across Homes\n\n3,000+\n\nSurvivors Rescued\n\nWhile statistics are hard to come by, is has been said that there are more than 40 million people around the world being trafficked and exploited through force, fraud, and coercion. Engaged in the global fight against human trafficking and child exploitation, the Tim Tebow foundation is committed to catalyzing awareness and prevention, to enabling the rescue of victims, and to providing restorative care to survivors."
