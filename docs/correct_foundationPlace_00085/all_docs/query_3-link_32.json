        "text": "Policy Proposals (Federal)\n\nIn order to prevent divisive ideological indoctrination in America’s public schools, Congress should:\n\nLimit federal overreach in education, which is rightly within the purview of state and local governments. Congress should allow states to opt out of existing federal education programs, eliminate duplicative and ineffective programs operated by the U.S. Department of Education, and equip parents with more control over how existing education dollars are spent through funding portability so that families can better avoid CRT indoctrination.\n\nOppose implementation of the harmful Equality Act in schools. Around the country, 10 states have explicitly prohibited sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) curricula. Under the Equality Act, if adopted, federal courts could mandate SOGI ideology in schools by prohibiting traditional teachings on sexual morality as “discriminatory.” States should also enact policies that protect single-sex private facilities and athletics. Congress should respect states’ authority in setting curricula, parental rights to the upbringing of their children, and the safety and privacy concerns of all students.\n\nPolicy Proposals (State)\n\nIn order to prevent divisive ideological indoctrination in America’s public schools, state legislators should:\n\nReject, alongside school board officials, the teaching of ethnic prejudice through CRT in academic subjects in their local schools. School board members should adopt civics and history standards that inform students correctly about how the establishment during periods of American history, such as slavery, Reconstruction, and the Jim Crow era, contradicted the principles in the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. These documents contain the national ideals of freedom and opportunity for all, regardless of race or any other immutable characteristic. The current generation—and every generation—must “let the proud fabric of freedom rest” upon the ideas of liberty, “a reverence for the constitution and laws,” and the pursuit of a civil society that offers freedom and opportunity to all Americans, regardless of the color of their skin.\n\nProhibit compelled speech and reinforce the Civil Rights Act of 1964. No public education employee shall compel a teacher or student to adopt, affirm, adhere to, or profess ideas that are in violation of Title VI and Title IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Such ideas include the notions that individuals should be adversely or advantageously treated on the basis of their race, ethnicity, color, or national origin or that individuals, by virtue of race, ethnicity, color, or national origin, bear collective guilt and are inherently responsible for actions committed in the past by others of the same race, ethnicity, color, or national origin.\n\nRequire that public schools make their curricular resources available to the public. Parents should know what is being taught in their children’s K–12 schools. Parents and taxpayers should have access to the material that teachers are using in the classroom. Some charter schools provide models and already make these resources available.\n\nPromote civics knowledge, not diversity training. K–12 and postsecondary school officials are spending significant amounts of taxpayer money on so-called anti-bias training. No public school employee or student should be required to engage in training programs that affirm the idea that individuals bear guilt for actions committed in the past by people of the same race or ethnicity.\n\nOffer alternative procedures for entry into the teaching profession that do not include the ideology of critical pedagogy. Nowhere has CRT permeated curricula and instruction more than in university-based schools of education. Colleges of education have a tremendous reach when it comes to training teachers who populate public and private schools across the country. State lawmakers should end requirements that teachers graduate or receive training from a university school of education, which significantly reduces enrollment in schools of education, and states should allow alternative teacher certification outside colleges of education.\n\nProhibit education officials from requiring public school teachers to participate in diversity training programs as a condition of employment. District and school officials must not be allowed to mandate that public school teachers affirm claims of moral guilt or innocence based on their racial identity in order to remain employed in a public school.\n\nGive families access to school board decision-making processes with respect to the adoption of curricula. More than 14,000 school boards and nearly 100,000 school board members, who constitute the largest body of elected officials in the country, influence everything from districts’ budgets and construction projects to school textbook adoption and collective bargaining processes. School boards oversee much of the policies and practices in the public schools in their districts. Information about the curricula and textbooks used in those schools is opaque. Parents should engage with their local school boards by (1) identifying school board meetings to attend throughout the year; (2) staying up to date on school board activities by reading posted meeting minutes; (3) submitting questions about spending, curricula, and staffing at school board meetings; and (4) reading the school board’s mission statement. If a child’s school is using materials rooted in critical theory, parents should complain to the school’s principal and school board and, at a minimum, be allowed to opt out.\n\nExpand parental choice in education. One of the most important tools for combatting CRT in the classroom is giving families control of where and what their children learn. More than half of all U.S. states offer some form of private school scholarship option for K–12 students; lawmakers in 44 states and Washington, DC, allow the creation of public charter schools; and every state allows parents to homeschool their children. State officials in every state should give students access to private schools, especially when in-person learning is not available at assigned schools because of teacher union strikes or other disruptions. Many states, however, have limits on student participation or the creation of public charter schools. Lawmakers should lift the caps on scholarship programs, increase school choice, and ease the provisions that limit additional public learning options through charter schools.\n\nIn order to give all Americans access to the health care they deserve, Congress should:\n\nRoll back the expansion of government involvement in health care. Since the major provisions of the misnamed 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), known as Obamacare, were implemented in 2014, liberals have continued their mission to have the government take over America’s health care. During the pandemic, millions of Americans were added to the government health care rolls due in part to congressional actions. Congress must reverse course and remove ineligible people from Medicaid, scale back ACA subsidy expansions, and stop harmful administrative actions that stifle innovation, increase costs, and reduce choices for patients, including the imposition of government price controls.\n\nGive states the flexibility to make coverage more affordable. States are better suited and equipped to oversee health insurance markets than the federal government. Rather than centralizing decisions at the federal level, Congress should give states greater flexibility to offer a broader menu of affordable health plans both in and outside federal exchanges to help to bring down costs and expand coverage options for their residents.\n\nOffer patients the ability to use their health care dollars as they want. Patients want greater flexibility in choosing the health care coverage and services that best fit their needs and save for future health needs. To do that, Congress should expand access to patient-owned and patient-directed account-based coverage options, such as health savings accounts, as well as other non-government coverage and care arrangements, such as association health plans, health care–sharing ministries, and individual reimbursement accounts.\n\nRequire more transparency in health care pricing. Americans spend more on health care than any other people in the world. Yet, most have no idea of the actual cost even of the most common medical treatments or procedures. Lack of transparency partially explains the rising costs of health care, and price transparency can help to resolve this problem. Congress should require consumer-friendly information about hospital, insurance, and prescription-drug pricing and allow patients to share in savings from choosing lower-cost options. Furthermore, Congress should reform the way in which it supports health care providers that provide indigent care so that it is more transparent and accountable.\n\nOffer low-income individuals and families private coverage options. Medicaid, the health care safety-net program for low-income individuals and families, locks them into an overstretched, rationed government-run health care program. Instead, Congress should give Medicaid enrollees the option of applying the Medicaid funds to the private health plan of their choice, including employer-based coverage.\n\nEliminate all taxpayer subsidies for, or funding of, abortion. Abortion is not health care. And post-Roe, it is, in fact, illegal in many states. The federal government has no business using taxpayer money to fund abortion. Aborted-fetal-tissue research organizations that perform or advocate abortions, like Planned Parenthood, should not receive any federal funding. Nor should the IRS allow tax breaks for abortion-related expenses.\n\nReform and expand private coverage options in Medicare. Medicare Advantage, the program that gives seniors access to private coverage options, is the fastest growing part of Medicare, because it is superior to traditional Medicare. To stabilize the Medicare program as a whole, Congress should reform the Medicare Advantage payment system to make it more market-based, expand the benefits that health care plans are allowed to offer seniors, allow seniors to share in savings for making less expensive choices, and make the Medicare Advantage program the default option for seniors in the future.\n\nOverhaul the public health bureaucracy. The federal public health bureaucracy failed the American people during the coronavirus pandemic. Congress must use its oversight powers to hold these agencies accountable and make meaningful policy changes to ensure that such failures are never repeated. This entails separating the CDC’s research and policymaking functions and restoring it to its core mission of responding to infectious diseases; reforming the grant-making process at the National Institutes of Health based on merit; and realigning the Food and Drug Administration toward more efficient and effective review and oversight.\n\nIn order to protect unborn children, U.S. policymakers should:\n\nEnact robust gestational limits. Congress should protect unborn children with beating hearts through the Heartbeat Protection Act. While several states have already done so with similar or more robust laws, many others have not. Some states have no gestational limits at all. This status quo—where Texas protects unborn children fully, but California treats them as medical waste—is unacceptable. Congress should use its constitutional authority to protect the youngest and most vulnerable in every state.\n\nLimit the interstate flow of chemical abortion drugs. Congress can, and should protect unborn children, women, and girls from dangerous chemical abortion drugs. Congress should also stop the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from prioritizing the abortion industry over Americans’ health and safety. In the spring of 2021, under the cover of containing COVID-19 and contrary to long-standing safety protocol, the FDA ended the requirement that chemical abortion drugs be dispensed in person in limited health care settings. In 2023, the FDA formally sanctioned telemedicine abortion where a woman can be prescribed abortion pills via video call without a single in-person doctor visit. She can then receive the pills through the mail or in a pharmacy instead of in person from a physician, which was required by previous chemical abortion regulations. In the post-Dobbs landscape, many states have passed new pro-life laws. But abortion-pill pushers, especially in pro-abortion states, undermine these efforts by promoting and trafficking chemical abortion drugs across state lines to pro-life states. As a result, abortion pills are the next pro-life battlefield. Congress should step in. The Support and Value Expectant (SAVE) Moms and Babies Act is a start. The bill bars the FDA from approving any new abortion drugs. For abortion drugs currently approved, the bill reinstates the in-person dispensing requirement, once again disallowing mail-order and telemedicine abortions. The bill also improves post-marketing safety surveillance to better track health complications and adverse events. In practice, the bill would put a stop to the Biden Administration’s reckless disregard for women’s health and safety—just a start on the way to banning these dangerous drugs. Congress should use every tool at its disposal to limit the threats these pills pose to women, girls, and unborn children.\n\nEnd taxpayer funding of elective abortion and the abortion industry. Congress should stop tax dollars from funding elective abortions and supporting the abortion industry once and for all. Rather than relying on a patchwork of “riders” that must be applied to appropriation bills every year, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act would permanently end federal funding for elective abortion or health insurance coverage of abortions. Congress should also end federal funding for the abortion industry and direct funding to centers that provide real health care for women. The Protecting Life and Taxpayers Act would require that groups seeking federal funding certify that they will not perform abortions or fund other entities that do. This would in effect defund abortion providers, such as Planned Parenthood, the International Planned Parenthood Federation, and Marie Stopes International. Federal resources should instead go to pregnancy resource centers and entities that provide high-quality, comprehensive care that is not entangled with the abortion industry.\n\nProtect the lives of abortion survivors. Congress should protect babies who survive abortion attempts. Federal law recognizes that infants born at any stage of development, regardless of the context of the birth, are “persons.” But this law does not specify duty of care for these babies. The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act would require that an infant born alive after an abortion attempt receive proper medical care. It would punish health care providers who do not provide such care, and it would criminalize infanticide. It is known from government sources in the United States and across the world that babies can and do survive abortion attempts. Allowing these babies to suffer death by neglect is utterly unacceptable. Fixing this problem should not be controversial.\n\nEnd “lethal discrimination” against Down syndrome babies. Congress should also protect babies from lethal discrimination in the womb. One way is through the Protecting Individuals with Down Syndrome Act, which would protect a child from abortion because a test result or diagnosis indicates the child has Down syndrome. The bill also prohibits forcing or coercing a woman to abort a child who has or may have Down syndrome. A 2022 Joint Economic Committee report finds that between 60 percent and 90 percent of baby boys and girls diagnosed with Down syndrome are aborted. It estimates that without these selective abortions, “the Down syndrome population would be 217,000 people greater in 50 years, an increase which is greater than the current Down syndrome population.” A dozen states protect unborn children from such lethal discrimination in the womb. The federal government should follow their lead.\n\nProtect conscience rights. Many Americans cannot in good conscience provide, pay for, or refer women for, abortions. Congress protects American citizens and entities from being forced to do so through policies such as the Church Amendments, the Coats–Snowe Amendment, and the Weldon Amendment. (The latter is an annual rider in appropriations bills, not a permanent statute.) If someone believes that his conscience rights have been violated, he can file a complaint with the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). But the current Administration has failed to enforce conscience laws. The Conscience Protection Act would codify the Weldon Amendment and provide Americans with a private right of action for conscience violations. Such a right does not guarantee a certain outcome, but it would allow Americans to have their day in court rather than rely on potentially hostile government bureaucrats for relief.\n\nResist the push for physician-assisted suicide (PAS). Nearly a dozen states allow physician-assisted suicide, and proposals are filed in additional state legislatures each year. Legalizing PAS endangers the weak and vulnerable, corrupts the practice of medicine and the doctor–patient relationship, compromises the family and intergenerational commitments, and betrays human dignity and equality before the law. The experience of countries with PAS and euthanasia suggests that safeguards intended to limit PAS eligibility to the terminally ill or to certify autonomous consent often fail to ensure effective control. Instead of embracing PAS, policymakers should focus on the benefits of palliative care to improve a patient’s quality of life by alleviating pain and other distressing symptoms of serious illness.\n\nTo protect children, parents, businesses, and all Americans from being forced to comply with radical sexual ideology, state and federal policymakers should:\n\nProtect the freedom of all Americans to think, speak, work, and act according to their beliefs about marriage, the innate sexual differences between men and women, and biological reality itself. Americans should be free at school, in the workplace, and in the public square to live according to their moral, religious, and scientific beliefs on these matters. But sweeping bills like the misnamed Equality Act would impose gender ideology as state-sanctioned orthodoxy in all 50 states. In states where similar bills have been enacted, those who disagree with the new orthodoxy may face discrimination charges. “Compromise” solutions, such as the Fairness for All Act and the Respect for Marriage Act, also fail to protect Americans’ freedoms and restrict freedom of expression on marriage and sex to private spaces.\n\nIn contrast, conservatives should push for legislation that recognizes and protects the “decent and honorable” beliefs of all Americans, not just those who agree with government-enforced orthodoxy. Bills like the First Amendment Defense Act or the Civil Rights Uniformity Act would do just that. The first prohibits the federal government from punishing any entity with which it contracts or which it accredits or licenses for affirming that marriage is exclusively between a man and a woman. The second would prevent any executive branch agency from defining “sex” in civil rights code to include “gender identity.” Such laws will ensure that medical professionals, school faculty, religious institutions, and parents can live and act freely without fear of punishment.\n\nPreserve and protect the right of parents to approve what their children are taught and exposed to and to oversee their children’s medical treatment. The Supreme Court has long recognized that parents have the primary right and duty to care for and guide their children. As the Court affirmed in Pierce (1925), “The child is not the mere creature of the State; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations.” Increasingly, however, educators and medical professionals are undermining these rights. In schools, children are secretly taught radical ideology and are bombarded with inappropriate sexual content without parental permission and even contrary to parents’ stated wishes. In some cases, schools have withheld vital information from parents about their children’s mental and physical health. In some states, minors can receive “sensitive” health care, including “gender transition,” without parental consent. All this can profoundly harm minors’ health and development. State and federal policies must protect children by ensuring that parental rights are treated with the strictest respect. Legislators should support bills that require opt ins (rather than opt outs) for sensitive curricula and protect parental consent when it comes to medical and mental health care for minors.\n\nProtect minors from harmful “gender-transition” procedures and “therapies.” Contrary to activists’ claims, the best medical research does not show that “gender transition” improves mental health for minors. The longest-term study found that even adults who fully transition are 19 times more likely than the average person to commit suicide. Moreover, those who transition chemically or surgically experience irreversible damage, such as sterilization, sexual dysfunction, atrophy, loss of bone density, or heart disease. This damage is especially tragic, as among minors who struggle with gender dysphoria, up to 88 percent of girls and 98 percent of boys who are not prevented from going through puberty reconcile with their biological sex. Internationally, the U.K. has closed its only pediatric gender clinic. And the U.K., as well as Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, have now put strict limits on these procedures. In the U.S., as of July 2023, 23 states have passed laws protecting children from experimental “gender transition” procedures. The other states and the federal government should do the same.\n\nAnchor the definitions of sex, male, and female firmly in biological reality. Through administrative rulemaking, the Biden Administration is attempting to legally redefine “sex” to include “gender identity” and “sexual orientation.” To protect their citizens from the threat of these ideological constructs, states should anchor the legal definitions of sex, male, female, man, and woman in biology and oppose the adoption of the “LGBTQIA+” lexicon.\n\nOppose any federal bill and regulation that would enshrine gender ideology in law. Activists have been trying to expand the “discrimination” prohibitions on the basis of sex to include sexual orientation and gender identity. A federal SOGI law like the Equality Act would have a devastating effect on Americans. Tying SOGI language to federal funding or tax-exempt status would curtail religious freedom. Disqualifying all groups that object to the new sexual orthodoxy would cost the federal government some of its best partners in serving the public.\n\nIn addition, bills like the Fairness for All Act and the Respect for Marriage Act are not enough to protect the common good. They wrongly elevate sexual orientation and gender identity to protected categories of civil rights law and contain only narrow religious exemptions for limiting the harms. Indeed, new regulations from the Department of Education and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission would compel millions of Americans to affirm falsehoods or risk losing their jobs and reputations. Short of stand-alone bills, gender activists push for laws and regulations that accomplish the same goal—one word or phrase at a time. Legislators must learn to spot buzzwords that disguise such efforts. These include the use of “gender” to refer to “gender identity,” terms such as “gender minorities,” “sexual minorities,” and “gender equity,” and offensive euphemisms, such as “menstruating individual” or “birthing person” rather than “woman” or “mother.”\n\nAt the United Nations and other international organizations, the U.S. should:\n\nStrengthen the protection of individual human rights and oppose creation of new rights based on gender ideology. Gender activists view the U.N. as a beachhead to advance their social policies in ways that influence American law and policy. The U.S. should promote reform of the U.N. human rights bureaucracy and hold it to its mandate to promote and protect basic freedoms. The U.N. should not be imposing an extreme ideology that is contrary not only to the Western tradition but to the views of every other traditional culture. The U.S. should respect the sovereignty of other U.N. member states in these matters and reject any insertion of SOGI language into negotiated U.N. texts.\n\nWhen President Lyndon Johnson launched the War on Poverty in 1965, he said that its purpose was to strike “at the causes, not just the consequences of poverty.” He added, “Our aim is not only to relieve the symptom of poverty, but to cure it and, above all, to prevent it.”\n\nIn fact, the actual War on Poverty policies had the opposite effect, with devastating consequences for lower-income families. Dramatically increasing government spending and creating an ever-growing number of new welfare programs, the War on Poverty produced a rapid decline in married, two-parent families, a steady growth in non-marital birth rates, a rise in abortions, and the spread of long-term government dependence.\n\nCongress took crucial steps to reverse these negative trends with the enactment of welfare reform in 1996. Welfare reform replaced the primary, failed welfare program called Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) with a new program: Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF). In contrast to other welfare programs, the new TANF program established work requirements and time limits on benefits for recipients. In addition, state governments that wished to expand dependence and welfare spending would be required to finance that expansion with state, rather than federal, funds. Even blue states were reluctant to spend their own funds in that manner.\n\nAround 90 percent of recipients in the AFDC and TANF programs were single parents. The welfare reform law had the explicit goal of reducing out-of-wedlock births and promoting marriage. The new work requirements and time limits were implicitly aimed at strengthening marriage by reducing the economic utility of single parenthood and non-marital births.\n\nMarriage. For more than two decades before welfare reform, the percentage of children residing in married two-parent families fell steadily. In 1970, 85 percent of children lived in two-parent homes; by 1996, the number had fallen to 68 percent. Welfare reform was intended to stop this steady collapse of marriage by limiting the utility of government subsidies to single parenthood relative to marriage. The reform was remarkably successful: The decline in two-parent families halted abruptly. The married family rate has remained stable for nearly three decades. If the pre-reform trend in family disintegration had continued, an additional 9 million children would live in single-parent rather than married two-parent homes today.\n\nAbortion. Some 86 percent of abortions are performed on non-married women. Non-marital births and non-marital abortions are often seen as the opposite ends of a seesaw. In this view, a rise in non-marital births will cause a fall in non-marital abortions. Conversely, a rise in non-marital abortions should cause non-marital births to fall. This view is inaccurate because both abortions and births are driven by a key background factor: the non-marital pregnancy rate (births per 1,000 non-married women). The non-marital pregnancy rate can be viewed like the pivot at the center of the seesaw. When the pivot rises, both non-marital abortions and births will rise together; when the pivot falls, both non-marital abortions and births will fall together.\n\nThe combination of Roe v. Wade and War on Poverty welfare programs led to an explosive growth in the non-marital pregnancy rate. This was a disaster. Before welfare reform, nearly one in 10 non-married women became pregnant each year; this obviously led to high simultaneous levels of non-marital abortions and non-marital births. But with welfare reform, the non-marital pregnancy rate fell for the first time. The shrinkage in non-marital pregnancy reduced both non-marital births and abortions together, resulting in at least 400,000 fewer abortions each year. Altogether, the behavioral and social changes initiated and promoted by welfare reform have led to 9.8 million fewer abortions.\n\nTeen Births. Between the launch of the War on Poverty in the early 1960s and the onset of welfare reform in the mid-1990s, birth rates for unmarried teenage girls skyrocketed. By the early 1990s nearly one in 10 births in the U.S. was to an unmarried teenager. With the onset of welfare reform, this mind-numbing upward trend promptly and sharply reversed; birth rates for unmarried teens plummeted back to levels from the early 1960s. Teen pregnancies and abortions fell at the same precipitate rates.\n\nPoverty and Dependence. Before welfare reform, the poverty rate among single parents was relatively flat. Immediately after reform, poverty among single parents began to decline sharply, falling from 33 percent in 1996 to 11 percent in 2020, due in part to work requirements and time limits on benefits. Furthermore, before welfare reform, nearly one in seven children was receiving monthly cash welfare benefits. More than 90 percent of these recipient children were in single-parent homes, and, on average, these families remained on the program for 13 years. After reform, caseloads plummeted. By 2019, only 3 percent of children were receiving traditional cash benefits, cutting the rate of traditional dependence by nearly 80 percent.\n\nBut welfare reform affected only a small part of the welfare system. While reform did dramatically overhaul the main welfare program for families with children, it left the remaining 90 programs in the welfare state largely intact. Although long-term spending was cut sharply, spending in the rest of the welfare state has grown rapidly.\n\nEven worse, rather than building on and expanding the highly successful and popular reform of the 1990s, conservatives simply walked away from the issue. The principles of successful reform have been abandoned and forgotten. For two decades, there have been no serious efforts to strengthen marriage or work requirements within the remaining vast welfare state. Conservatives have remained largely silent on welfare.\n\nThe Left has taken advantage of this conservative silence. For two decades, it has steadily pushed to overturn welfare reform and dramatically expand the anti-marriage, anti-work welfare state. For example, in 2021, the Biden Administration sought to completely overturn welfare reform.\n\nThe Biden anti-work and anti-marriage plan sought to vastly expand the welfare state with a focus on pumping new cash benefits to non-working single parents. The plan would have provided the largest single-year increase in means-tested welfare spending in U.S. history, adding some $836 billion in new means-tested spending over five years. Having ignored welfare for decades, conservatives were caught off balance and President Joe Biden’s welfare spendathon came two votes short of final passage in the Senate.\n\nAlthough welfare reform in the 1990s dramatically slowed the decline in marriage, the American family remains in a precarious state. Today, some 40 percent of children are born outside marriage. Aside from the TANF program, welfare spending has continued to rise.\n\nConservatives should no longer ignore the issues of work, marriage, and welfare. They should, instead, build on and expand the successes of welfare reform. Congress should inject the time-tested principles of reform into the rest of the vast welfare state.\n\nIn order to allow Americans—consumers, farmers, and business owners—to purchase and grow the food that is right for them, Congress should:\n\nStop paying farmers twice for revenue shortfalls and for price losses in the same year. Agricultural producers can receive support from the Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC) program or the Price Loss Coverage (PLC) program and the federal crop insurance program to cover price declines and revenue shortfalls in the same year. In years during which farmers receive a crop insurance indemnity to help with revenue, the U.S. Department of Agriculture should not also provide an ARC or PLC payment. It is duplicative, unnecessary, and wasteful to force taxpayers to provide those same producers with more than one federal revenue-related payment in the same year.\n\nReduce the premium subsidy rate for crop insurance from an average of 62 percent to 47 percent or lower. Taxpayers should not pay more for the cost of premiums than the farmers who benefit from crop insurance policies are required to pay. The Trump Administration, the Obama Administration, and the Government Accountability Office have recommended reducing the premium subsidy. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has identified reducing the premium subsidy to as low as 40 percent as an option for reducing the federal deficit. When analyzing a 47 percent premium subsidy, the CBO found that it would save taxpayers $8.1 billion over 10 years. It would also have very little impact on crop insurance participation—a reduction in insured acres of just 0.5 percent, and only 1.5 percent of acres with lower coverage levels.\n\nShutter the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). A relic of the New Deal era, the CCC’s statutory authority is deliberately broad and vague, allowing it to function as a de facto agricultural slush fund. This leads to a lack of transparency for the public, a lack of proper control for Congress, and allows abuse by the executive branch. An excellent example is the Biden Administration’s Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities program, which is poised to deliver billions of dollars in corporate welfare benefits based on dubious environmental claims. There is no direct statutory authority for any program along these lines, let alone a program of such size, yet the CCC’s authorizing language is so poorly crafted that the Biden Administration is abusing the program. Congress should end the CCC and only retain programs that Members are willing to reauthorize directly.\n\nEliminate the sugar program. The federal sugar program intentionally drives up food prices by limiting the sugar supply. As would be expected, American sugar prices are consistently higher than world prices, which negatively affects American consumers and workers in industries that use sugar to manufacture goods. The program costs consumers about $3.7 billion a year, and there is a disproportionate impact on the poor because a greater share of their income goes to meeting food needs than in higher-income households. Sugar producers and processors should compete in a free market as other businesses do without price guarantees, supply restrictions, import quotas, and other government interventions.\n\nSeparate food stamps from agricultural programs. For decades, Congress has passed farm bills by combining food stamps with agricultural programs. This unholy alliance has existed entirely for political purposes to promote the enactment of legislation, with rural legislators presumably pushing for farm subsidies, and with urban legislators presumably pushing for food stamps. Real reform requires that these categories be separated because, like food stamps, agricultural policy needs to be addressed on its own merits. Congress should therefore consider food stamps and agricultural programs in two separate bills, and these programs should be authorized on staggered schedules so that there is no potential for overlap in the future.\n\nFree agricultural trade from government intervention. Trade is often discussed in connection with how it affects countries, but trade as a general matter is about the freedom of individuals and businesses to exchange goods and services voluntarily. American farmers and ranchers, like those in other businesses, should generally be free to sell to customers all over the world. Likewise, consumers should generally be free to purchase goods and services that best meet their needs, regardless of national origin. Government-imposed barriers, such as tariffs, undermine these freedoms. To address unfair practices, the United States should rely on the World Trade Organization’s (WTO’s) dispute-settlement system instead of relying on tariffs. One of the most important benefits of membership in the WTO is having a legal venue through which to challenge foreign trade barriers.\n\nStop federal efforts to control or change individual dietary choices. Federal government intrusion into the dietary choices of Americans is growing. Underlying these mandates is the arrogant presumption that the government must guide or even compel the public to make the “right” choices. Congress should respect the most basic and private aspect of Americans’ lives: food choices. This should include stopping the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) overreach in implementing Obamacare’s menu-labeling law. Even though the law applies to “restaurants and similar retail food establishments,” the FDA is using it to regulate grocery stores, convenience stores, movie theaters, and other businesses that no reasonable person would think are the same as restaurants. Congress should also clarify that the FDA’s role in food safety does not include micromanaging nutritional information.\n\nRefrain from blocking food and agricultural innovation. Congress ignored science when it mandated the adoption of misleading food labels suggesting that foods using genetically engineered crops are somehow less safe than their non–genetically engineered counterparts. Efforts at the state and federal levels (including at the FDA) are making it difficult for producers of new products, such as plant-based dairy alternatives and plant-based and cell-based meat alternatives, to convey the nature of their products accurately to consumers. For example, almond milk producers, who have long included the term “milk” in their product name, might no longer be able to use the dairy-related term due to FDA concern over non-existent consumer confusion. Congress needs to repeal the genetically engineered food labeling law and ensure that the government is not creating protectionist schemes, such as name restrictions, to hinder the sale and development of food products that appeal to consumers.\n\nBig Tech is damaging the fabric of the country. A multipronged effort is required to combat its specific harms on children, the digital public square, the free market, and America’s national security. A layered approach at redressing Big Tech’s abuses should expose its negative influence on civil society, promote the principles of federalism through state legislative action, and build platforms that protect freedom of expression. Absent campaigns on every one of these fronts, Big Tech will continue to erode individual liberties, segment the American citizenry, and stunt human flourishing and self-governance.\n\nBig Tech’s practices result in measurable, deleterious effects on young citizens. Researchers are now able to reify a causal link between social media and negative effects on children and teenagers in the Western world. A January 2023 study conducted by neuroscientists at the University of North Carolina found that social media use, particularly “social media checking behaviors,” could be associated with changes in sensitivity to social rewards and punishments in children’s brains. In other words, habitual social media use is rewiring the brains of kids as young as 12 in ways that diminish impulse control, which is vital to life success.\n\nAnother study published by Cambridge University researchers in March 2022 found a direct relationship between social media use and life satisfaction in younger adolescence. The researchers discovered that “higher estimated social media use predicts a decrease in life satisfaction ratings” and that “lower estimated social media use predicts an increase in life satisfaction ratings” during these critical developmental stages. Companies like Facebook are aware of these effects yet continue to double down and expand efforts targeted at children. As Representative Bill Johnson (R–OH) said at a congressional hearing in March 2021: “Big Tech is essentially giving our kids a lit cigarette and hoping they stay addicted for life.”\n\nIn the information environment, Big Tech is leveraging its market dominance to shut off Americans’ direct access to digital information and engage in public information manipulation—often hand in glove with the government—and squelching America’s culture of free speech. As a practical matter, Big Tech companies can now control Americans’ ability to access information. Censorship conducted at the cloud-hosting level or Internet service provider (ISP) level severely curtails direct access to viewpoints and people who run afoul of these providers. By controlling these lower levels of the technical stack on which many other layers (such as digital platforms and applications) depend, a small group of unelected and unaccountable tech executives can pull the plug on entire companies, nonprofits, or even state and local governments—and with very limited recourse.\n\nBig Tech companies have successfully policed the speech of Americans at the behest of the government and manipulated their access to information due in part to anticompetitive practices. Big Tech firms seek to entrench their monopolies by erecting high barriers to entry, engaging in rampant self-preferencing and other anticompetitive practices, and buying and killing innovative young companies. Common behavior includes Apple’s penchant for “Sherlocking” (stealing the core functions of the third-party applications it hosts) and demanding 30 percent commissions on in-app purchases from smaller companies. Amazon effectively requires smaller companies to give it the right to buy massive stakes in those companies for extremely deep discounts rather than at market value. Tech companies also hoard talent by hiring programmers to “work on next to nothing,” in the words of venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, solely to prevent them from being hired by other companies where their skillsets could disrupt the incumbent’s business. Similarly, Big Tech companies are no strangers to the practice of “killer acquisitions” (buying out innovative young businesses just to kill them so they cannot compete with the acquirer in the future). As part of this strategy, Big Tech companies specifically target and terminate the smaller company’s innovation initiatives in order to strangle the future competitor and its incipient ideas in the crib.\n\nOn the national security front, Silicon Valley companies that were built in part through partnerships with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) are reticent to disassociate themselves from the CCP. Apple, for instance, assembles nearly every iPhone, iPad, and Mac computer it produces in China. The country is Apple’s second-largest consumer market, with sales there comprising nearly a fifth of the company’s annual revenue. Apple’s dependence on Chinese engineering, manufacturing, and consumers leaves the company at the mercy of CCP demands. In addition to Apple, most Big Tech companies have few qualms about helping the CCP to preserve their access to the Chinese market. Amazon Web Services, for instance, operates at least five joint operations centers in China. Ten percent of the collective artificial intelligence (AI) research labs of Facebook, Google, IBM, and Microsoft were based in China at the end of 2020. Microsoft has also announced a collaborative AI initiative with ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok.\n\nIn order to preserve affordable and reliable energy for Americans, the U.S. government should:\n\nStop the regulation of greenhouse gases. The Biden Administration has implemented a suite of greenhouse gas emissions regulations and executive orders that have unnecessarily driven up energy prices and eliminated choices while having no meaningful climate impact. Worse are its regulatory efforts to regulate vehicle tailpipe and power plant emissions, that would essentially ban internal combustion vehicles and completely wipe out America’s current energy-producing infrastructure. Future Administrations should direct agencies to reconsider and withdraw most of these rules. However, lasting leadership and change must come from Congress. Congress should prohibit the federal government from regulating greenhouse gas emissions and clarify that the Clean Air Act was never intended to regulate greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide.\n\nMake targeted spending decisions to build resilient infrastructure. Whether carbon-dioxide levels rise, fall, or stay the same, the United States and the rest of the world will experience extreme weather events. Climate and land will continue to change for a wide variety of reasons. Without question, extreme weather and long-term climate changes can adversely affect communities and infrastructure. The federal government (when applicable), state and local governments, and the private sector should address climate-related infrastructure vulnerabilities through site-specific and situation-specific analysis and spending. Federal, state, and local policymakers should use the best available science to prepare more effectively—before storms inflict damage—to maximize resilience and preparedness.\n\nEnd the use of “social cost of carbon” in government cost-benefit analyses. Federal agencies perform cost-benefit analyses for a wide range of regulatory and permitting decisions. Under the Obama Administration, agencies began to incorporate a “social cost of carbon” in these analyses to assess the alleged social costs of an activity emitting carbon dioxide. The statistical models upon which the federal government relies offer significantly different results when using a variety of justifiable inputs; as a consequence, values are essentially arbitrary and are not credible tools for policymaking. Congress should prevent any agency from using regulatory analysis metrics with the “social cost of carbon” and the “social cost” of other greenhouse gas emissions in any cost-benefit analysis or environmental review. If federal courts force regulators to estimate the costs of climate change, they should assess climate effects in terms of global temperature change as a result of the proposed project, using a tool like the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse-Gas Induced Climate Change.\n\nWithdraw the endangerment finding and address the uncertainties in climate science. The Environmental Protection Agency should reconsider its endangerment finding on greenhouse gas emissions, recognizing that greenhouse gas emissions are affecting the climate but that no credible evidence suggests that the Earth is heading toward catastrophic warming. Physicist Steven Koonin, former Undersecretary of Energy for Science in the Obama Administration, proposed a climate “Red Team/Blue Team.” Inspired by the national security community’s Red Team exercise to challenge assumptions, reduce risks and uncertainties, and correct for biases, a Red Team/Blue Team would provide a public, transparent exchange on major issues surrounding climate science.\n\nWithdraw from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The most effective way to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement is to withdraw from the entire UNFCCC, the treaty underlying the Paris agreement. The Paris agreement specifies that any government withdrawing from the UNFCCC “shall be considered as also having withdrawn from this Agreement.” The process for withdrawing from the UNFCCC requires one year, which accelerates the process considerably. Moreover, departure from the UNFCCC would prevent future Administrations from using that framework to avoid obtaining the Senate’s advice and consent in the treaty process. Congress should urge the Administration to withdraw from the UNFCCC.\n\nReject carbon taxes and carbon tariffs. Carbon-based resources account for 80 percent of the energy resources used by Americans. A carbon tax is a tax on energy and, in effect, on the entire economy. Levying a price on carbon dioxide would directly raise the cost of food, electricity, transportation, manufacturing, and nearly every good and service that Americans need and consequently would be regressive, hurting poor Americans—who spend a larger share of their incomes on energy—the most. Similarly, a carbon tariff would impose a carbon tax on imported goods, which would increase prices throughout the economy. Even if Congress implemented a plan to return the revenue to the people and avoid carving out revenue for special interests, Americans would still face higher costs overall and would therefore lose much more than they would gain. Like every other regulatory or subsidy scheme to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions, a carbon tax is by no means a free-market solution, nor would it have any meaningful impact on global temperatures.\n\nIn 2000, the federal budget was balanced, and the national debt stood at $5.6 trillion. In just over 20 years, the annual deficit has climbed to $1.7 trillion for fiscal year (FY) 2023, and the gross debt now exceeds $257,000 per household at $33.7 trillion. Moreover, this mounting debt and deficit are only two of the many symptoms of the dramatically expanding size and scope of the federal government—a government that consumes more and more of the resources produced by the American people.\n\nDriven in part by response to the pandemic, the federal government spent $13.4 trillion in FY 2020 and FY 2021—an unprecedented amount by any metric, especially during peacetime. Federal deficits since the start of the pandemic have increased the federal debt by $10.3 trillion. For perspective, the total debt only reached $10.3 trillion in October 2008. The massive pandemic-era deficit spending spree was a driving force behind the crushing wave of inflation that began in 2021, followed by punishing interest rate hikes as the Federal Reserve seeks to minimize the damage.\n\nTo clarify: Every dollar spent by the government must first be taken from the economy. This money represents real goods and services that are produced by American workers and businesses and then redirected by the government based on the whims of politicians and bureaucrats. Though this growing issue has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related expansion of the federal government, it also is deeply rooted in the largest and oldest federal programs. As the government consumes and redistributes more and more of the economy, it also inevitably stifles growth and destroys opportunities.\n\nIt is equally important to understand the sources of this runaway trajectory. This unsustainable path is the result of exponentially growing entitlement programs, runaway interest costs on the already mountainous federal debt, and Congress’s recent binge spending on new non-defense programs. When federal programs grow at a faster rate than the economy—as they have for decades—the share of all resources consumed by the government increases. That is the definition of an unsustainable budget, as the government cannot extract more in tax revenues to pay for this spending than the economy can produce.\n\nFederal spending represents the volume of goods and services produced by Americans that is either redirected to federal government operations and projects or redistributed among Americans. The federal government had already grown to more than one-fifth of the economy before the COVID-19 pandemic and is now projected to grow to almost one-third of the economy in just over another generation. The Left’s attempt to frame fiscal policy as a matter of dollars in and out of the government intentionally masks this reality. Ultimately, fiscal policy is a determination of the size of the check signed by the taxpayer.\n\nIt is of paramount importance that policymakers remember that the private sector—America’s families, workers, businesses, and innovators—produces the wealth of this society. Government, at best, guarantees law and order to facilitate economic activity, but it is not the source—the American people are. Federal spending beyond its original limited mandate is simply the mechanism by which a government redirects resources and redistributes that wealth.\n\nThe process through which governments raise revenue and then spend it unavoidably destroys productive arrangements in the private sector and then repurposes what real goods and services remain. Taxation directly hurts productivity by disincentivizing activities such as investment, savings, and work, while deficit spending does so indirectly by crowding out private investment. The immediate stifling of economic activity causes ripples into the future in the same way that planting fewer seeds today means smaller harvests tomorrow. Compounding this stagnation, runaway deficits today mean that far higher rates of taxation will be required in the future simply to manage the debt.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that the current fiscal trajectory will bring the debt to one-and-a-half times the size of the economy over the next two decades. Net interest on the debt alone will be the largest federal program, eclipsing the entire national defense budget and the Social Security and Medicare programs. This projected future—in which the largest federal program could be paying interest on money borrowed (in some cases from foreign entities) long ago—is perhaps the starkest reminder of how far the fiscal reality is from what the Founders laid out in the Constitution.\n\nIn order to rein in spending and reduce the debt, Congress should:\n\nLimit federal programs to responsibilities enumerated in the Constitution. For at least the past 100 years, the federal government’s reach has expanded well beyond its constitutional limits, pushing federal spending to unsustainable heights and stifling the freedom and creativity of the American people. All federal spending comes at the expense of some productive private-sector activity, which must be justified by some compensating benefit. It is therefore vital to limit this harm by restricting the federal government’s consumption of resources to what the government requires to fulfill its constitutional role.\n\nReform major entitlement programs to make them fiscally sustainable. Spending on Social Security and major health care programs is driving the unsustainability of the federal budget. The CBO projects that spending for these programs and net interest on the debt will swell to more than total federal revenues in 2046. Left unaltered, these programs—intended to protect Americans from poverty—would increasingly crowd out economic growth and sap the retirement savings of all Americans. On their present trajectory, Social Security and Medicare are expected to deplete their trust funds in 2034 and 2026, respectively. Policymakers cannot resolve this problem of budget unsustainability without also addressing entitlement spending. Fortunately, reasonable policy options are available that would modernize Social Security and health care programs, return control to Americans, and expand their choices of health care and retirement decisions while at the same time saving money. Lawmakers should make entitlement programs more affordable and fiscally sustainable by returning control of health and retirement decisions to the people.\n\nEliminate federal central planning programs that pick winners and losers. Mission creep and the overly expansive scope of federal activity undermine congressional and executive focus on performing core federal functions. This tendency has led to the creation of numerous federal programs that micromanage both private activity and the activity of state and local governments. When Washington creates these programs, it acts as a pass-through, absorbing monies, adding layers of bureaucracy, and redistributing wealth to well-connected and politically favored businesses and other entities. Congress should work toward reducing or ending most spending on welfare, health, infrastructure, education, energy, and other domestic programs. Private entities and state and local governments are best able to manage such activities effectively and efficiently.\n\nReduce the growth of federal spending to less than the growth of the economy. Whenever government spending is set to grow faster than the economy—as it has been for decades—the government is consuming and redistributing an ever-larger share of the goods and services produced by Americans, stifling both innovation and job creation and limiting the freedom of all Americans. Furthermore, government cannot sustainably increase spending faster than economic growth increases over the long run. The only way to ensure the freedom and prosperity of the American people and allow greater innovative investment in the future is to reduce the growth rate of federal spending to less than the rate at which the economy grows.\n\nImplement fiscal controls to ensure responsible long-term balance. The best way to achieve a balanced budget is by reducing spending, not by raising taxes. Caps on federal revenues, paired with controls that keep government spending from increasing faster than economic growth, would ensure that the ratio of debt to gross domestic product decreases to sustainable levels. Left unchecked, the current uncapped nature of federal taxation and deficits could well lead to economy-wrecking levels of taxation and the exponentially increased crowding out of private investment. Congress must focus both on its spending and on how that spending is financed. It is imperative that Congress reduce the footprint and long-term burden of the means by which the federal government raises revenue. The longer Congress waits, the closer the nation gets to a debt crisis, and the harder it will be to implement the needed reforms.\n\nEliminate budget gimmicks and unhelpful accounting practices. Budget gimmicks promote wasteful spending and thrive on a lack of transparency. Congress should eliminate them from the budget process. These gimmicks include creating temporary programs that are designed to force future Congresses to take hard votes to make them permanent, using scoring methods that undercut the true cost of programs rather than dynamic scoring or fair-value estimates, using scoring conventions that create false pay-fors, relying on baselines that assume continuous spending growth, or using shell budgets to ram large spending and tax bills through Congress. These practices and many more obscure the true cost of federal action and the incomprehensible mountain of federal programs: Even Washington lacks a firm accounting of how many federal programs exist. Supporters will claim that these practices bring order to the budget process, but they only help the federal bureaucracy to find new ways to expand itself and the burden borne by the American people.\n\nAdopt an accountable, responsible, and transparent budget process. The 1974 Budget Act provides a timeline to guide completion of the congressional budget process and lays out clear deadlines to ensure that Congress enacts appropriations bills before October 1 of each fiscal year. The budget process allows Congress to evaluate priorities carefully and perform critical oversight of how agencies are spending taxpayer dollars. However, Congress has no will and little incentive to follow the budget process. The last time Congress completed each required step on time was in 1996. The rules intended to keep the process running smoothly are weak and largely ignored by both parties. This has led to a cycle of continuing resolutions, massive omnibus spending bills, and periodic lapses in appropriations. The budget and appropriations process has morphed from what was intended to be an orderly exercise into a continuing series of funding fights as Congress lurches from one crisis to the next. Amid this chaos, any semblance of fiscal restraint has been lost. Returning to the transparent budget process as laid out in law is a crucial step toward the restoration of a federal government that respects the American people.\n\nReject tax increases. While some on the Left look to tax hikes to reduce the deficit, this is an illusion that would simply trade one economic burden for another. Every dollar spent by the government must first be taken from the economy. Whether that dollar is taken through direct taxation, borrowing, or monetization of the debt (printing money just to finance the federal deficit), it is removed in a way that stifles investment and saps the purchasing power of all Americans. Tax cuts and pro-growth reforms, such as those implemented by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, improve the economic outcomes of all Americans by removing disincentives for private investment. These reforms led to the lowest unemployment and fastest real wage growth in 50 years. Tax increases, on the other hand, serve only to destroy productive economic endeavor. Instead of offsetting the true cost of federal spending, they mask the burden while destroying the foundations of the economy. The problem is not that taxes are too low, but that the government spends too much of what Americans earn and produce.\n\nThousands of federal regulations have been eased as a result of the COVID-19 crisis to speed production of protective gear and development of treatment tools. This deregulatory sweep represents explicit acknowledgement that unnecessary regulation undermines public health and well-being. Economic recovery post-COVID-19 likewise requires Congress and the White House to lighten the regulatory burden on employers and investors.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s executive order of May 19, 2020, directs federal agencies to exercise regulatory restraint. But it will require action by Congress as well to ensure that meaningful reform outlasts the current Administration. Conventional wisdom has long held that government regulation is the only way to protect the public interest. We now know better: Forty years of command-and-control regulatory schemes have led to massive, ineffective, and unaccountable bureaucracies and a raft of costly unintended consequences.\n\nMost regulatory intervention embodies the Progressive conceit that government knows what is best for us all. But even well-intentioned central planners cannot possibly possess the vast and ever-shifting knowledge necessary to determine the optimal course of action—especially when global markets are involved.\n\nThe self-interest of entrepreneurs and investors increases the likelihood of success. Consumers and competitors impose penalties for errors in judgment swiftly and stringently. In contrast, political imperatives trigger government action, which is largely insulated from consumer demand, competition, and financial discipline.\n\nGovernment remedies are inherently weak because political concessions are necessary for them to gain acceptance. As economist Richard Stroup noted, “A political solution cannot be purchased—only rented.” Regulatory schemes are also unreliable because neither Congress nor the White House is bound by the actions of its predecessors, except in the granting or sale of private rights.\n\nRegulations also shift labor and capital away from productive activities, such as innovation and job creation, to compliance activities. The burden falls heaviest on new businesses, which inhibits job creation, undermines competition, and secures the dominance of incumbent firms. Unsupportable compliance costs also drive mergers, further consolidating markets.\n\nRegulatory costs are not a problem just for business. Low-income families and fixed-income seniors are also hit hard by government edicts. The costs of compliance increase the prices of products and services across the economy, including soaring energy bills from renewable energy dictates, increased food bills from excessive production standards, restricted access to credit due to some 400 Dodd&hyphen;Frank regulations, and higher medical costs as a result of the inaptly named Affordable Care Act—to name a few.\n\nConservatives rarely shape the debate on environmental policy, too often focusing on regulatory costs rather than on an alternative agenda. But green eyeshades cannot compete for public support against the seemingly selfless agenda of green activists. Americans care deeply about the environment and expect public officials to act. Conservatives must avoid merely opposing the green lobby’s agenda and must put forth a platform for responsible stewardship. As noted in a previous Heritage report, Protecting the Environment: A Free Market Strategy, “While the conservative critique is well known, the conservative agenda is not.”\n\nReform is hindered by the immensity, complexity, and lethargy of the federal regulatory apparatus. A simple repeal requires adherence to a ream of administrative procedures, such as analyzing alternatives and presenting justification for public notice and comment. Litigation is rampant and protracted.\n\nThe need for reform has never been greater. Regulation acts as a stealth tax on the American people and the U.S. economy, and exacts an incalculable toll on individual liberty.\n\nIt is not enough to repeal individual rules or tweak the rulemaking process. A more substantive national debate must address the extent to which it is appropriate for the federal government (or any level of government) to intervene in matters that can be managed by the states and, in many instances, by the private sector, more effectively.\n\nStop the regulation of greenhouse gases. The Obama Administration implemented a suite of greenhouse gas emissions executive orders and regulations under the Clean Air Act1 that have unnecessarily driven up energy prices and eliminated choices, while having no meaningful climate impact. President Trump rightly directed agencies to reconsider and withdraw some of these rules. However, lasting leadership and change must come from Congress. Congress should prohibit the federal government from regulating greenhouse gas emissions and clarify that the Clean Air Act never intended to regulate greenhouse gases.\n\nEnd use of social cost of carbon in government cost&hyphen;benefit analyses. Federal agencies perform cost&hyphen;benefit analyses for a wide range of regulatory and permitting decisions. Under the Obama Administration, agencies began to incorporate a “social cost of carbon” in these analyses to assess the alleged social costs of an activity emitting carbon dioxide. The statistical models upon which the federal government relies offer significantly different results using other reasonable inputs, such that values are essentially arbitrary and are not credible tools for policymaking. Congress should prevent any agency from using regulatory analysis metrics with the “social cost of carbon” and the “social cost” of other greenhouse gas emissions in any cost&hyphen;benefit analysis or environmental review. If federal courts force regulators into estimating the costs of climate change, they should assess climate impacts in terms of global temperature change as a result of the proposed project using a tool like the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse-gas Induced Climate Change rather than using the social cost of carbon.\n\nEliminate subsidies for all energy resources and technologies. In 2015, Republicans and Democrats reached a compromise to extend wind and solar tax credits one more time and put them on a schedule to sunset. Congress should hold to that promise and wind down tax credits for all energy technologies. It should also reform the tax code to allow for immediate expensing for all capital investments. Relatedly, Congress should eliminate Department of Energy (DOE) subsidized research and development for commercial energy technologies. It is neither appropriate for taxpayers nor a necessary role of the federal government to fund or conduct such research. Furthermore, Congress should prohibit any further taxpayer-backed loans to private companies and eliminate the DOE’s loan-guarantee program.\n\nReform offshore energy leasing. America keeps the vast majority of its territorial waters off-limits to energy production, but that has not always been the case. Congress should open America’s coasts for offshore oil, gas, wind, and other energy resource exploration and development. It should eliminate the Department of Interior’s five-year leasing plans and authorize the Department of the Interior (DOI) to conduct lease sales, if interest for development exists, while considering the interests of states that would be most impacted by that development. Such a reform would allow the safe development of energy off America’s coasts and replace the lengthy and unnecessary planning process for a system that is more responsive both to price changes and to the needs and interests of states. Bidding on the leases would not be exclusive to energy companies but open to all parties, including those interested in environmental preservation rather than resource development. Reform should also include transferring environmental review and permitting process to the states, along with at least 50 percent of the revenues generated by onshore oil and natural gas production on federal lands.\n\nEliminate government energy efficiency mandates. Federal efficiency mandates, rebate programs, and spending initiatives too often assume either that all Americans use energy the same way, or that the government knows better how Americans should use energy. Congress should affirm the ability and freedom of Americans and businesses to make decisions that best meet their needs by eliminating all mandatory efficiency regulations and subsidies for vehicles, appliances, and buildings. At a minimum, mandates should be restructured as voluntary standards under which businesses and consumers can choose their level of participation.\n\nOverhaul nuclear energy regulation. The regulatory system that licenses and permits nuclear reactors failed to keep up with technological innovations and overregulates existing nuclear technologies. Instead of addressing underlying government-imposed problems, policymakers have focused on mitigating the cost of those policies through subsidies, leading to a predictable path of failure: While such an approach may spur some commercial activity, that commercial activity is limited only to what is subsidized. Nuclear plants in America today continue to exhibit superior safety performance. Policy and regulations should reflect that track record. Congress should instill regulatory discipline at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), direct the Environmental Protection Agency to right-size radiation-exposure standards, review foreign ownership caps, reform the NRC’s cost-recovery structure, and address the convoluted export regulatory regime.\n\nComplete the review of Yucca Mountain, and introduce market forces into nuclear waste management. Congress has failed either to change current law or appropriate the funds necessary for the NRC to review the DOE’s permit for a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain. This unnecessary limbo has been costly to taxpayers and has created problematic uncertainty for the current and future nuclear industry. Congress should provide enough funding to complete the license review to allow contentions to be adjudicated, and all of the information should be brought together for Congress, the State of Nevada, and the nuclear industry to make prudent decisions about next steps. Ultimately, Congress must introduce market forces in nuclear waste management for it to be a successful, dynamic part of the fuel cycle and nuclear industry. Nuclear waste management should be primarily a business activity, not an inherently governmental activity.\n\nEncourage choice in electricity markets. Competitive electricity markets have served customers well. Some states have accomplished the transition from monopolies to competition more successfully than others, and additional free-market reforms are necessary to spur more entrepreneurial activity in electricity markets. However, when the underlying structure of competition is sound, the benefits to energy consumers are unambiguously positive. Competition in electricity services allows greater customer choice through the power of the consumers’ own dollars rather than through the disconnected votes of a small panel of public utility commissioners. Consumer choice comes not only in the form of resource choice (renewables, conventional fuels, or a mix) but also in the form of financial choices (e.g., fixed rates, risk preferences, indexed rates, or short-term or long-term contracts).\n\nIn the end, because electricity providers have to work for their customers, prices are competitive and quality improves. States should fix anti-competitive energy policies like renewable energy mandates, which have wreaked havoc in the electricity sector by putting politics and special interests over customers. Similarly, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should work vigorously to uphold fuel and technology neutral competition in electricity markets.\n\nRepeal the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). There is near universal agreement among energy, agriculture, food industry, and environmental groups that the RFS is bad policy and that it has had negative unintended consequences. Despite nearing the goal of the mandate to use 36 billion gallons of ethanol by 2022, this policy has proved unworkable. Tinkering around the edges will not rescue it. Moreover, the federal government should not mandate what type of fuel drivers use in the first place. Instead of attempting to reform the RFS, or continually calling on the EPA to waive or negotiate annual mandates, Congress should repeal the RFS to protect Americans from artificially higher food and energy prices, and eliminate unfair subsidies that go to a small set of special interests that benefit from the mandate.\n\nPreserve Social Security for the most vulnerable while restoring to workers more control of their own money. Social Security started out as an old-age social insurance program intended to protect a relatively small number of elderly individuals from living in poverty. Over the decades, however, it has expanded massively in size, scope, and cost to the point that two out of every three Americans pay more in Social Security taxes than they do in income taxes and 42 percent of Americans rely on Social Security for at least half of their retirement income. Social Security’s more than fivefold increase in taxes and its dominant role in Americans’ plans for retirement income leave workers with less control and lower incomes than they otherwise would have. Moreover, the program’s insolvency—which will result in benefit cuts of approximately 25 percent beginning in 2033—threatens workers’ retirement security.\n\nTo ensure that Social Security is there for workers who need it and to increase workers’ incomes both before and during retirement, the program’s eligibility age should reflect rising life expectancies and increased work capabilities. Benefits should better target workers’ needs by shifting to a predictable, poverty-prevention, and modernized benefit structure. Social Security should apply a more accurate inflation measure to annual benefit increases, and workers should have an option to save for retirement outside of Social Security. These changes would make the program solvent over the long run and would allow for a significant reduction in workers’ payroll taxes, enabling workers to spend, save, and invest more of their own money.\n\nImprove Social Security’s Disability Insurance (SSDI) program so that it better serves individuals with disabilities while ensuring efficiency and integrity for taxpayers. The SSDI program has served as a lifeline for certain individuals with disabilities, but its more than tenfold expansion in size and scope since 1970 has produced inefficiencies and inadequacies that prevent it from meeting workers’ basic needs on a timely basis. Because of inefficient and flawed government policies, individuals who receive SSDI benefits must wait an average of well over a year to learn whether they qualify to receive SSDI benefits and during that time receive no support to help them remain at work or get back to work. Those who do receive SSDI benefits face a lifetime of inactivity and government dependence that leads to lower physical, mental, and financial well-being than if they had pursued meaningful work, and nearly a third of SSDI beneficiaries receive benefits that are lower than the poverty level.\n\nA rehabilitated and modernized SSDI system would promote independence and physical and mental well-being by helping individuals with disabilities to receive the assistance they need when they need it and with less stigma and cynicism than are currently associated with the receipt of SSDI benefits. Such a system could be achieved by implementing a predictable, poverty-prevention benefit; providing a needs-based benefit period; eliminating non-medical vocational grid factors; providing an optional private disability insurance component; ending direct payment of SSDI representatives; correcting unintended payments; and improving program integrity and efficiency. These changes would improve the SSDI program for individuals with disabilities and would save taxpayer costs by significantly reducing the payroll tax rate, enabling workers to buy more generous private insurance to meet their needs and to spend, save, and invest more of their own earnings.\n\nImprove Medicare’s quality of care for a rapidly aging senior population while retargeting taxpayer subsidies to those who are most in need. Medicare, created in 1965, provides a guaranteed health care benefit to seniors and some people with disabilities. Over the past 50 years, although it has delivered hospital and physician services and some financial security, Medicare spending routinely has outpaced inflation, growth in the general economy, and growth in the federal budget. Meanwhile, the addition of new benefits and services has been accompanied by progressively tougher price controls and increasingly detailed conditions of reimbursement that have led to more intrusive bureaucracy and costly red tape for doctors, hospitals, and other medical professionals. These changing dynamics leave seniors, health care providers, and taxpayers at risk.\n\nReforms to improve the delivery of care in Medicare should both ensure that seniors have access to quality care and protect taxpayers from bankrupting costs. Such reforms include simplifying the traditional Medicare program, harmonizing eligibility with Social Security, updating premiums and cost-sharing arrangements, building on the success of the competitive and integrated Medicare Advantage plans, and transitioning to a defined-contribution, premium-support model for long-term sustainability.\n\nRestore Medicaid’s strong health care safety net to the most vulnerable while ensuring financial sustainability. Enacted alongside Medicare in 1965, the Medicaid program began as a safety net to provide health care to certain vulnerable low-income populations. Like Medicare, the program has expanded beyond its original core functions, providing additional benefits to larger populations at a significant cost to federal and state taxpayers. The program’s joint federal&hyphen;state design further complicates administration and oversight, creating new and disparate sets of incentives and outcomes. Changing demographic, structural, and fiscal challenges undermine this critical safety net program.\n\nRestoring Medicaid to its original purpose as a functioning safety net would require a major overhaul of its financing structure to realign and reset priorities and incentives for those who need the program the most. Specifically, the financing of Medicaid should be sustainable and realistic, and it should be aligned with the needs of the most vulnerable, which can be accomplished by giving states greater flexibility in managing the delivery of care to those who are in need.\n\nRein in Obamacare to expand health care choices and access while lowering costs. The 2010 Affordable Care Act put in place two new federal health care entitlements and a massive federal regulatory infrastructure, all financed by an unrealistic set of new taxes and cuts in payments to providers in other health care programs. Since its enactment, premiums have climbed, coverage options have dropped, provider networks have narrowed, and many people are left with higher costs, less access, and fewer choices. Moreover, the open-ended ACA subsidies scheme and the ACA Medicaid expansion encourage more spending instead of delivering higher-quality care at lower costs. Fundamental changes are needed to restore choice, improve access, and lower costs. The way to begin is by reining in Obamacare federal spending and mandates, restoring state authority over health care, and making available a wider range of private coverage options that best meet individual needs.\n\nAmericans, regardless of ideology, want a clean environment, but the path to achieving environmental objectives leads to disagreement. Some look to the federal government to promote command and control policies, but the best approach to environmental policy is to recognize the importance of private property rights, state and local innovation, and free markets.\n\nAdvocates of command and control invariably point to federal laws like the Clean Air Act as examples of success. The Clean Air Act has certainly played an important role in the notable improvements in air quality that have been realized over the past 40 years, but these improvements could have been accomplished at far less cost—both economic and social—had lawmakers foregone centralized government control in favor of the transformative power of market incentives and private property rights.\n\nTouting the Clean Air Act as an example of the success of command and control also ignores other foundational environmental statutes from the 1970s that have failed miserably, including the Endangered Species Act. Innovation and investment in new technologies have caused the state of our air and water to improve by leaps and bounds over the past several decades. For policymakers, the question should not be what laws have done in the past, but whether these laws are sound policy for the future.\n\nFederal environmental law is comprised of environmental statutes that are overly broad, unclear, or woefully outdated, failing to reflect current conditions. In addition, almost 50 years of agency implementation of these laws has led to government overreach that is inconsistent with the statutes themselves. The size and scope of the federal role in environmental management are now well beyond what was envisioned with these statutes even as the federal government has become increasingly unaccountable to the people and their representatives in Congress. Congress has delegated much of its power to set environmental policy to executive agencies, which exercise this power through standards, regulations, permitting requirements, and multi-decade management plans. Moreover, while Congress envisioned a cooperative role for states in many of these laws, that role has been eroded over time. Consequently, federal bureaucrats often function as economic planners and local zoning boards.\n\nThe result is sweeping decisions on nuanced issues and increasingly stringent standards that achieve marginal benefits at great cost. Often, these decisions are defended by scientific analyses that present an incomplete picture, are biased toward regulatory action, ignore evidence that contradicts regulatory agendas, and are inaccessible to the public. Regulators argue that they are merely “following the science,” but they are really making policy decisions that reflect their own value judgments.\n\nEven in areas where most Americans would support some measure of continued federal management, current policies are problematic when divorced from principles of limited government, individual freedom, and free-market incentives. National parks are discouraged from employing innovative solutions to raise park revenue, address catastrophic wildfires, and manage invasive species and overpopulation of native species. Laws like the Endangered Species Act disincentivize solutions and partnerships with private property owners. And because of bureaucratic and legislative mismanagement, government nuclear weapons research and development sites that helped the U.S. win World War II and the Cold War remain what may well be America’s greatest unaddressed environmental liability.\n\nThe need to reform the nation’s environmental laws has never been greater. The foundational federal environmental statutes should be changed to apply the lessons learned over the past half-century. They should be modernized to reflect the current environment and to rein in the agency overreach that has expanded beyond the plain language of the statutes and the will of Congress. In general, to the extent that there is a federal role, it should be to ensure that environmental gains achieved over the years are not lost. The responsibilities and the rewards of environmental stewardship belong with property owners and the states, which are more knowledgeable about local conditions than are federal bureaucrats.\n\nA true commitment to the environment means advancing policies that achieve measurable, positive outcomes. The best way to achieve these outcomes is by respecting American values of federalism, the rule of law, and economic freedom. Ultimately, policymakers should never lose sight of the fact that America’s most important, unique, and precious natural resource is its people.\n\nDevolve more responsibility for environmental regulation and federal lands management to the states and the private sector. Congress should allow state programs to function in place of federal leasing, permitting, management, and regulatory programs both to benefit from local knowledge and to free federal resources for issues that are more federal in nature. America benefits from experimentation and innovation that could be cultivated with a more decentralized approach. Some states would doubtless make mistakes in their management by being too restrictive or too lax, but such mistakes would provide lessons to guide future policy decisions and would have far less adverse impact on the nation than would be the case if the same mistakes were made by the federal government.\n\nProhibit the Environmental Protection Agency from abusing cost-benefit analysis to justify costly air regulations (ancillary or secondary benefits abuse). When the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issues a rule to reduce emissions of a certain air pollutant, the direct benefits of reducing those emissions should exceed the costs. However, for years, the EPA has made an end run around this common-sense requirement. Even when a rule’s stated objective has massive costs and few to no benefits, the EPA points to the ancillary benefits (most often from reducing particulate matter) as justification for the rule. This overreliance on ancillary benefits allows the EPA to regulate an air pollutant without making the case that reducing emissions of that pollutant is warranted. This abuse has become so egregious that the EPA has issued major rules without quantifying whether there are benefits associated with their regulatory objectives, instead relying solely or primarily on ancillary benefits from reducing particulate matter.\n\nClean up facilities that are used to manufacture and test nuclear weapons. The facilities remaining from World War II and the Cold War that were used to manufacture and test nuclear weapons may be America’s greatest remaining environmental liability. The U.S. Department of Energy is chiefly responsible for cleaning up these sites at an expected cost to the taxpayers of $406 billion. Cleanup of these sites should not be treated as an everlasting jobs program. The federal government has a legal and moral obligation to clean up these sites, and this mission should receive the commensurate level of attention from Congress.\n\nDefine which waters are covered under the Clean Water Act. Congress should clarify in statute the regulatory reach of the Clean Water Act. The statute currently prohibits the discharge of pollutants into “navigable waters” without a federal permit. It further clarifies that “navigable waters” include “the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.” However, the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers have failed to follow the plain language of the law and have tried to expand their regulatory reach by broadly defining “waters of the United States.” They have also adopted subjective and vague definitions while inconsistently enforcing the law. Congress should define which waters are covered under the Clean Water Act, recognizing the important role that states play in regulating lakes, rivers, and streams. This definition should be narrow in scope and generally consistent with Justice Antonin Scalia’s plurality opinion in Rapanos v. United States (2006).\n\nEliminate the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), established by Congress in 1965 and administered by the U.S. Department of the Interior, allows the federal government to use royalties from offshore energy development to buy private land and turn it into public parks and other public recreation areas. It is the primary vehicle for land purchases by the four major federal land-management agencies: the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Park Service. Congress also uses the fund for a matching state grant program. The federal government cannot effectively manage the lands it already owns, and Congress should not enable further land acquisition.\n\nImprove the Endangered Species Act. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is failing to achieve its fundamental purpose—to protect endangered or threatened species—and this failure is exacerbated by the blocking of important projects and trampling of property rights. To improve the conservation of species under the ESA, Congress should codify the regulatory clarification (consistent with the statute) that threatened and endangered species are to be treated differently when it comes to Section 9’s take prohibition. The listing process should be a distinct process that is separate from whether any regulatory requirements should be triggered. States should be allowed to play a greater role in protecting species, in large part because they are closer than the federal government to any situation that needs to be addressed. Improvements in the ESA should ensure that its costs are borne by society, not by individual property owners.\n\nRequire that Congress make any changes in the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The EPA regularly sets standards for six principal air pollutants: carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ground-level ozone, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide. Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA is required to review the standards every five years and make changes, if necessary, disregarding costs in the development of the standards. The EPA continues to develop stricter standards even as states and metropolitan areas have yet to meet older standards (for example, in the case of ground-level ozone). New standards are also becoming extremely expensive to meet while yielding smaller margins of tangible benefits; in fact, some standards are close to or at background levels. Congress should reconsider the mandatory review process. Congress, not the EPA, should make any decision to tighten standards, given the scope of their impact and the magnitude of success that has already been achieved in improving air quality.\n\nRepeal or limit the scope of the National Environmental Policy Act. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is a 50-year-old procedural law that requires federal agencies to assess the potential environmental impacts of their actions, including permitting for infrastructure projects. NEPA has evolved to serve more as a tool by which to delay and obstruct projects that are unpopular with special-interest groups or politicians than as a way to assure the proper consideration of environmental impacts. Major problems contributing to NEPA delays include differing interpretations of NEPA requirements, nuisance litigation, failed interagency coordination, administrative bottlenecks, and outdated requirements that fail to take into account a dynamic environment.\n\nFar from compromising environmental stewardship, repealing NEPA would provide an opportunity to remove duplication of state and federal environmental requirements. NEPA was America’s first major federal environmental law and was passed before the other numerous federal environmental statutes that now exist. It seems unlikely that NEPA would even be enacted today given that environmental issues are constantly being considered independently of NEPA through other federal environmental laws.\n\nShort of NEPA’s full repeal, reforms should include narrowing the scope of review to include only major environmental issues, mandating time limits and requiring a lead agency on projects, eliminating analysis of greenhouse gas emissions from the review process, and allowing agencies to consider environmental impact analyses conducted under other federal statutes as the functional equivalent of a NEPA analyses.\n\nCompensate property owners for regulatory takings. When the government seizes private property for a public use, it must provide just compensation to property owners. However, there is little to no protection for property owners when the government imposes regulations that restrict the use and enjoyment of property even if most of the property’s value has been lost. These restrictions on property use, while not a physical seizure of property, are still a taking of a specific use of the property. Compensation mechanisms should be created, either within individual federal environmental statutes or in broad-based legislation, to offset the costs borne by property owners because of federal environmental regulation. In addition to improving the protection of private property rights, this change would require agencies to be transparent with respect to the true costs of their regulations and to take those costs into account when establishing agency priorities.\n\nRepeal the Dodd&hyphen;Frank Act. The Dodd&hyphen;Frank Act became law during the Obama presidency when Nancy Pelosi (D&hyphen;CA) led the House of Representatives and Harry Reid (D&hyphen;NV) presided over a near filibuster-proof Senate majority. It was a partisan bill that garnered no Republican votes in the House and just three in the Senate. Dodd&hyphen;Frank was largely a progressive wish list of policies that failed to address, much less fix, what caused the 2008 financial crisis. The more than 800-page boondoggle expanded the failed regulatory approach that helped create the 2008 crisis in the first place, and increased the federal government’s involvement in planning for, protecting, and propping up the financial system, thus enshrining “too-big-to-fail” policy into law. Repealing Dodd&hyphen;Frank would be a good first step—but only a first step—toward protecting taxpayers and allowing private firms to easily provide the financial services that consumers need. In June 2017, the House passed the Financial CHOICE Act, a comprehensive financial regulatory reform bill that would have replaced the core of Dodd&hyphen;Frank. Key provisions in the Financial CHOICE Act would have helped to restore market discipline and reduce regulatory burdens, thus moving the nation’s financial markets in the right direction. The Senate, however, passed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (S. 2155), a tremendously watered-down (compared to the CHOICE Act) bill that failed to repeal a single title of Dodd&hyphen;Frank. (The bill did not even include those reforms that passed the House with strong bipartisan support.)\n\nRather than negotiate a compromise between the two approaches, the Senate forced the House to accept the Senate’s bill, and the President signed S. 2155 into law. The bill left all of Dodd&hyphen;Frank in place, but provided special exemptions to various Dodd&hyphen;Frank requirements for (mainly) smaller banks. While those banks were surely happy to have any regulatory relief, even the new exemptions came with the type of regulations that the CHOICE Act would have eliminated.\n\nProvide an off-ramp style federal financial charter. Although banks are more heavily regulated than other financial firms, virtually all financial companies are subject to extensive restrictions on their activities, capital, and asset composition. Simultaneously, U.S. taxpayers have been forced to absorb more of these institutions’ financial losses in the name of ensuring stability. The result has been a massive substitution of government regulation for market competition, which culminated in the 2008 financial crisis. Fixing this framework requires rolling back both government regulation and taxpayer backing of financial losses, making it possible for private citizens to build a stronger financial system that efficiently directs capital to its most valued uses. Creating a new federal charter for financial institutions that relieves the regulatory burden for those who absorb more of their own financial risks and forgo government assistance would help achieve these goals.\n\nEliminate federal credit subsidies, guarantees, and insurance. Americans collectively shoulder approximately $20 trillion in debt exposure from loans, loan guarantees, and subsidized insurance provided by roughly 150 federal programs. This scheme erodes the nation’s entrepreneurial spirit, increases financial risk, and fosters cronyism and corruption. The programs and subsidies have given rise to powerful constituencies of beneficiaries because any losses are dispersed among millions of taxpayers. The government’s credit portfolio consists of direct loans and loan guarantees for housing, agriculture, energy, education, transportation, infrastructure, exporting, small businesses, and other purposes; federal insurance programs cover bank and credit union deposits, pensions, flood damage, declines in crop prices, and acts of terrorism. Capital for mortgage lending by banks (and non-banks) is provided by government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, while federally-backed deposit insurance creates distortions and risks. Congress should immediately reduce federal deposit insurance coverage and ensure that coverage is provided on a per individual basis. Congress should also phase out government-backed deposit insurance along with all other credit subsidies, guarantees, and insurance.\n\nEliminate Fannie Mae and "
