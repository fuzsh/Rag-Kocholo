        "text": "Dr. Dan Challener, president of PEF said, “PEF is delighted to be able to make a second investment of a million dollars to expand our students’ access to digital fabrication, thanks to an amazing anonymous donation. I’m especially excited that all of the schools chosen in this first round are elementary schools. Imagine what our youngest students will create in these labs.”\n\nThe HCS eLab network currently consists of 23 school-based digital fabrication labs, locally known as “eLabs.” Digital fabrication labs, invented at MIT in 2001, have traditionally been reserved for university students and researchers. However, in 2014, STEM School Chattanooga pioneered a compelling model to integrate the labs in high school. With the expansion of Volkswagen eLabs across HCS (2017-2019), HCS emerged as a global leader with labs now thriving in 23 middle schools and high schools.\n\nDr. Bryan Johnson, superintendent of HCS said, “One of the focus areas of our strategic plan is Future Ready Students, and we believe it is essential for students to have rich learning experiences that will prepare them for the jobs of the future. These eLabs will significantly multiply the number of students who have access to a digital fabrication lab and put them on the path to future readiness.\" With each of the seven new labs opening in elementary schools, this represents the first time in our region that students across the district will have the opportunity to experience these innovative learning environments kindergarten through 12th grade.\n\nHCS eLabs offer students opportunities to develop future-ready skills as they create solutions to real-world challenges. For instance, students design and code custom robotics, create functional prosthetics, build solar-powered go-karts, and design sustainable systems to provide solutions for clean drinking water.\n\n“We already have alumni who are pursuing industry and trade certifications, as well as STEM and computer science degrees as a direct result of their high school experiences in an eLab,” said Michael Stone, vice president of Innovative Learning at PEF. “It is exciting to imagine the impact of today’s kindergartner students engaging in eLabs over the next 12 years!”\n\nThe learning that takes place in these labs empowers students to develop a STEM identity that uniquely equips them to solve the problems of today while they prepare to meet the workforce demands of tomorrow. “Now, more than ever, we need to prepare students to be collaborators, designers and problem solvers. We are excited that our elementary students will have the opportunity to discover new ideas in exciting and meaningful ways in our new eLabs,” said Dr. Jill Levine, Chief of Innovation and Choice at HCS."
