Citizen Designer, Second Edition, attempts to answer this question with more than seventy debate-stirring essays and interviews espousing viewpoints ranging from the cultural and the political to the professional and the social. This new edition contains a collection of definitions and brief case studies on topics that today’s citizen designers must consider, including new essays on social innovation, individual advocacy, group strategies, and living as an ethical designer. Edited by two prominent advocates of socially responsible design, this innovative reference responds to the tough questions today’s designers continue to ask themselves, such as: How can a designer affect social or political change? Can design become more than just a service to clients? At what point does a designer have to take responsibility for the client’s actions? When should a designer take a stand?\n\nExplore\n\nAuthor:\n\nWilliam Myers (Editor) and Paola Antonelli (Foreword)\n\nYear published:\n\n2012\n\nISBN:\n\n9780870708442\n\nFor centuries, designers and artists have looked to nature for inspiration and materials, but only recently have they developed the ability to alter and incorporate living organisms or tissues into their work. This startling development, at the intersection of biology and design has created new aesthetic possibilities and helps address a growing urgency to build and manufacture ecologically. Bio Design surveys recent design and art projects that harness living materials and processes, presenting bio-integrated approaches to achieving sustainability, innovations enabled by biotechnology, and provocative experiments that deliberately illustrate the dangers and opportunities in manipulating life for human ends. As the first publication to focus on this new phenomenon and closely examine how it fits into the history of architecture, art and industrial design, this volume surveys this shift and contextualizes it through comparisons to previous historic transitions in art and design practices, clarifying its implications for the future. A reference for students and teachers of art, architecture, industrial design and engineering, Bio Design will also introduce the subject to a broad audience.\n\nExplore\n\nAuthor:\n\nTom Kelley and David Kelley\n\nYear published:\n\n2013\n\nISBN:\n\n978-0385349369\n\nToo often, companies and individuals assume that creativity and innovation are the domain of the “creative types.” But two of the leading experts in innovation, design, and creativity on the planet show us that each and every one of us is creative. In an incredibly entertaining and inspiring narrative that draws on countless stories from their work at IDEO, the Stanford d.school, and with many of the world’s top companies, David and Tom Kelley identify the principles and strategies that will allow us to tap into our creative potential in our work lives, and in our personal lives, and allow us to innovate in terms of how we approach and solve problems. It is a book that will help each of us be more productive and successful in our lives and in our careers.\n\nExplore\n\nAuthor:\n\nCarlo Vezzoli, Fabrizio Ceschin, Lilac Osanjo, Mugendi K.

However, even if promising,the implementation of DRE systems is not always straightforward.The book analyses, discusses and classifies the promising Sustainable Product-ServiceSystem (S.PSS) business models to deliver Distributed Renewable Energy systems in aneffective, efficient and sustainable way. Its message is supported with cases studies andexamples, discussing the economic, environmental and socioethical benefits as wellas its limitations and barriers to its implementation\n\nExplore\n\nAuthor:\n\nMarko Brajovic\n\nYear published:\n\n2016\n\nISBN:\n\n978-8592822002\n\nThis book does not intend to exhaust conceptual or scientific paradigms or to address specific sustainability issues. It aspires to introduce experimental tools for creative innovation inspired by nature. A mechanical paradigm of our actual society is still mirrored by an architecture based on a pyramidal hierarchy. In the upcoming post-industrial era, social structure is evolving towards a more organic system. I believe that a synergetic and non-centralized society is already emerging and that a new architecture will manifest that evolution.\n\nExplore\n\nAuthor:\n\nChris Anderson\n\nYear published:\n\n2012\n\nISBN:\n\n978-0307720955\n\nWired magazine editor and bestselling author Chris Anderson takes you to the front lines of a new industrial revolution as today’s entrepreneurs, using open source design and 3-D printing, bring manufacturing to the desktop. In an age of custom-fabricated, do-it-yourself product design and creation, the collective potential of a million garage tinkerers and enthusiasts is about to be unleashed, driving a resurgence of American manufacturing. A generation of “Makers” using the Web’s innovation model will help drive the next big wave in the global economy, as the new technologies of digital design and rapid prototyping gives everyone the power to invent — creating “the long tail of things”.\n\nExplore\n\nAuthor:\n\nKlaus Klemp\n\nYear published:\n\n2011\n\nISBN:\n\n978-3899553970\n\nDieter Rams created ten rules of design more than twenty years ago. Sometimes referred to as the ten commandments, they are just as relevant today: Good design is innovative. Good design makes a product useful. Good design is aesthetic. Good design helps a product to be understood. Good design is unobtrusive. Good design is honest. Good design is durable. Good design is consistent to the last detail. Good design is environmentally friendly. Good design is as little design as possible.\n\nExplore\n\nAuthor:\n\nSimon Jimenez, A E Pohlmeyer, Pieter Desmet, Delft University of Technology. Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering.\n\nYear published:\n\n2015\n\nISBN:\n\n978-9461864253\n\nhe Positive Design Reference Guide focuses on the why, what and how of human experience – both in general, and in relation to design for well-being. The guide provides you with a quick entry point into the variety of theories that we believe can be relevant for well-being-driven design. It comprises 29 models, theories and frameworks, separated into two sections. The first section presents a collection of theories drawn from (positive) psychology, and the second section presents a collection of theories and frameworks drawn from (positive) design research. Each theory is introduced with a short summary and a list of key publications that offer more extensive explanations. You are likely to be familiar with some of the theories, but will perhaps also discover some new ones.\n\nExplore\n\nAuthor:\n\nSteven Eppinger and Karl Ulrich\n\nYear published:\n\n2015\n\nASIN:\n\nB00ZYY672W\n\nTreating such contemporary design and development issues as identifying customer needs, design for manufacturing, prototyping, and industrial design, Product Design and Development by Ulrich and Eppinger presents in a clear and detailed way a set of product development techniques aimed at bringing together the marketing, design, and manufacturing functions of the enterprise.

Authors offer their different perspectives coming from United States, Brazil, Colombia, United Kingdom, Turkey, Kenya, India and China. M’Rithaa, former President of WDO saluted the book as “the most important contribution on this field in the last ten years” (cited in the final remarks of his interview in the chapter Design in Africa: I participate, therefore I am). In Brazil the book was awarded twice – initially at the Objeto:Brasil International Design Award in May 2016, and again at the MCB (Museum of the Brazilian Home) 2016 Design Awards. The jury of this later has acclaimed the book as “a theoretical and academic milestone, with potential to change the current practice and understanding of Design.” After the successful launching in Brazil and Portugal in 2015 and 2016, the book was selected in 2017 to the exhibition Brasil: Hoje at MUDE, Lisbon’s Museum of Fashion and Design. The curator, Frederico Duarte, highlighted in the catalogue: “The first and indispensable book on design and development in the Portuguese language.” In 2018 the book was selected in Spain to be part of BID, the Ibero-American Design Biennial, in Madrid. A first e-book edition was launched in Portuguese (2018) and then in English (2019).\n\nExplore\n\nAuthor:\n\nNigel Whiteley\n\nYear published:\n\n1997\n\nISBN:\n\n9780948462658\n\nDesign for Society is not an anti-design book; rather, it is an anti-consumerist-design book, in that it reveals what most people would agree are the socially and ecologically unsound values and unsatisfactory implications on which the system of consumerist design is constructed.

In Designing Design, he impresses upon the reader the importance of emptiness in both the visual and philosophical traditions of Japan, and its application to design, made visible by means of numerous examples from his own work: Hara for instance designed the opening and closing ceremony programs for the Nagano Winter Olympic Games 1998. In 2001, he enrolled as a board member for the Japanese label MUJI and has considerably moulded the identity of this successful corporation as communication and design advisor ever since.

It is simple. It means that your product has been created with the intention of being accessible to as many different users as possible. For a long time, the concept of accessibility has been limited in terms of only defining physical spaces. However, change is afoot: personal technology now plays a part in the everyday lives of most of us, and thus it is a responsibility for designers of apps, web pages, and more public-facing tech products to make them accessible to all.

This new edition (first self-published by the TU Delft in 2014) contains new examples and insights from recent publications.

They are little aware of the opportunities that exist in the next product universe, where money is made from products in use, as well as from a product’s afterlife. These opportunities clearly exist, otherwise they would not be providing an income for so many people.

Our dire predicament, from collapsing social structures to the climate crisis, has been millennia in the making and can be traced back to the erroneous belief that the earth’s resources are infinite. The key to change, says Don Norman, is human behavior, covered in the book’s three major themes: meaning, sustainability, and humanity-centeredness. Emphasize quality of life, not monetary rewards; restructure how we live to better protect the environment; and focus on all of humanity. Design for a Better World presents an eye-opening diagnosis of where we’ve gone wrong and a clear prescription for making things better.\n\nNorman proposes a new way of thinking, one that recognizes our place in a complex global system where even simple behaviors affect the entire world. He identifies the economic metrics that contribute to the harmful effects of commerce and manufacturing and proposes a recalibration of what we consider important in life. His experience as both a scientist and business executive gives him the perspective to show how to make these changes while maintaining a thriving economy.

The larger impact of our fourth and current era is yet to be determined, but this book acts as a blueprint for where design might go next. Design is a catalyst. We cannot speculate, create, and implement on our own. For too long, designers have lived with the misguided belief that only we can do what we do — the false idea that, somehow, designers are unique. In this current phase, ID is powering a new generation of design leaders willing to release the hubris and openly embrace collaboration. In the spirit of collaboration and dialogue, this book assembles six conversations with ID faculty about the issues facing contemporary design and how ID is thinking through them as a community.\n\nExplore\n\nAuthors:\n\nAntoine Picon and Carlo Ratti\n\nYear published:\n\n2023\n\nISBN:\n\n9780300247510\n\nWhat have smart technologies taught us about cities? What lessons can we learn from today’s urbanites to make better places to live? Antoine Picon and Carlo Ratti argue that the answers are in the maps we make. For centuries, we have relied on maps to navigate the enormity of the city. Now, as the physical world combines with the digital world, we need a new generation of maps to navigate the city of tomorrow. Pervasive sensors allow anyone to visualize cities in entirely new ways—ebbs and flows of pollution, traffic, and internet connectivity.\n\nThis book explores how the growth of digital mapping, spurred by sensing technologies, is affecting cities and daily lives. It examines how new cartographic possibilities aid urban planners, technicians, politicians, and administrators; how digitally mapped cities could reveal ways to make cities smarter and more efficient; how monitoring urbanites has political and social repercussions; and how the proliferation of open-source maps and collaborative platforms can aid activists and vulnerable populations. With its beautiful, accessible presentation of cutting-edge research, this book makes it easy for readers to understand the stakes of the new information age—and appreciate the timeless power of the city.\n\nExplore\n\nAuthor:\n\nEllen Lupton\n\nYear published:\n\n2017\n\nISBN:\n\n194230319X\n\n978-1942303190\n\nGood design, like good storytelling, brings ideas to life.

African design is the plural expression of the many cultures that characterise this continent, the expression of its youth, its creativity, extraordinary resources, and incredible future potential. African designers bear witness through their work to the history of their respective countries, and express a combination of African and Western culture. Inspired by everyday objects, they transform them for alternative use. They often work in collaboration with local artisans in the production of concepts. Design thus becomes an act of solidarity, connecting creation, industry, and artisanry. The texts by two co-authors retrace the history of design in Africa, and evoke the emergence of artists and the particularities of the continent. The authors offer their vision of this extraordinary dynamic. Africa is charting its path, and this book will follow that path into the field of design.\n\nExplore"
