        "text": "Associate Professor\n\nBiography —\n\nBryan Mann is an associate professor in the Department of Educational Leadership and Policy Studies. He received his PhD in Educational Theory and Policy from the Pennsylvania State University. Dr. Mann’s research centers on issues of geography and educational policy. This work revolves around a few simple questions that have complex answers with profound implications: Where do children enroll in school and what drives these trends? What policy mechanisms help shape enrollment patterns so they enhance educational and social equity? These motivating questions have led Dr. Mann to conduct research across several areas of education policy, including enrollment patterns as they relate to segregation and diversity, school choice, and alternative models of education. Prior to joining the faculty at the University of Kansas, Dr. Mann was an assistant professor at the University of Alabama. He started his career as a high school English teacher in Monmouth County, New Jersey.\n\nResearch —\n\nResearch interests:\n\nEducational policy & leadership\n\nschool enrollment patterns\n\ngeography and education\n\nsegregation\n\ndiversity\n\nschool choice\n\ncharter schools\n\nalternative models of schooling\n\nSelected Publications —\n\nMann, B., & Dudek, J.
