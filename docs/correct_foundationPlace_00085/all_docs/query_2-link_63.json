        "text": "SACRAMENTO, CALIF. â Sounders FC advanced to the Semifinals of the 2024 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup with a 2-1 win in the Quarterfinals over Sacramento Republic FC on Tuesday evening at Heart Health Park. Josh Atencio and Jordan Morris scored first-half goals, as the Rave Green kept Sacramento from equalizing down the stretch after the USL Championship side pulled one back early in the second half. Seattle advances to the Semifinals for the first time since 2014 and is set to host the winner of tomorrowâs matchup between LAFC and New Mexico United, with exact date, kickoff time, ticket information and broadcast details forthcoming.\n\nBrian Schmetzerâs side turns its attention back to MLS regular season play this Saturday, July 13 with a road fixture at Austin FC at Q2 Stadium (5:30 p.m. PT / Apple TV â Watch Free, 93.3 KJR FM, El Rey 1360 AM).\n\nMATCH NOTES\n\nSounders FC advances to the Semifinals of the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup for the first time since 2014 and is set to host the winner of tomorrow nightâs matchup between LAFC and New Mexico United, with exact date, kickoff time and broadcast details forthcoming.\n\nSeattle is now 26-7-6 all-time in U.S. Open Cup play, including a 5-5-3 record on the road.\n\nJosh Atencioâs goal marked his first career U.S. Open Cup goal and just his second career goal for Sounders FC across all competitions since signing with the First Team in 2020. Earlier this week, Atencio was selected as an alternate for the U.S. Olympic Menâs Soccer Team that is headed to the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.\n\nJordan Morris scored his first career U.S. Open Cup goal with his first-half strike. The Mercer Island native has now scored eight goals in his last 10 games across all competitions.\n\nReed Baker-Whiting recorded his first career assist in Open Cup action on Morrisâ goal.\n\nAndrew Thomas started in goal this evening, continuing his run in 2024 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup. Thomas started each of Seattleâs previous two matches in the tournament against Louisville City SC and Phoenix Rising FC.\n\nThis marked the second all-time matchup between Sounders FC and Sacramento Republic FC in Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup play. Sacramento eliminated Seattle in the Fourth Round of the 2018 tournament with a 2-1 win after extra time.\n\nSounders FC is one of three MLS teams (Chicago Fire, Sporting Kansas City) to have won the U.S. Open Cup four times (2009-2011, 2014). Los Maccabi Los Angeles and Bethlehem Steel hold the all-time record with five titles, although both teams are no longer operational.\n\nMATCH SUMMARY\n\nSeattle Sounders FC 2 â Sacramento Republic FC 1\n\nTuesday, July 9, 2024\n\nVenue: Heart Health Park\n\nReferee: Ted Unkel\n\nAssistants: Fernando Fierro, Stephen McGonagle\n\nFourth Official: Robert Vincze\n\nAttendance: 11,569\n\nWeather: 83 degrees and sunny\n\nSCORING SUMMARY\n\nSEA â Josh Atencio 16â\n\nSEA â Jordan Morris (Reed Baker-Whiting) 31â\n\nSAC â SebastiÃ¡n Herrera (Jack Gurr) 49â\n\nMISCONDUCT SUMMARY\n\nSAC â Nick Ross (caution) 5â\n\nSAC â Cristian Parano (caution) 51â\n\nSAC â Jack Gurr (caution) 56â\n\nLINEUPS & STATS\n\nSeattle Sounders FC â Andrew Thomas; Cristian Roldan â Captain, Yeimar GÃ³mez Andrade, Jonathan Bell, Nouhou; Josh Atencio (Danny Musovski 90â), JoÃ£o Paulo (Alex Roldan 62â); Paul Rothrock (RaÃºl RuidÃ­az 62â), Albert RusnÃ¡k (Jackson Ragen 89â), Reed Baker-Whiting (Obed Vargas 81â); Jordan Morris\n\nSubstitutes not used: Jacob Castro, Pedro De La Vega\n\nTotal shots: 9\n\nShots on goal: 4\n\nFouls: 13\n\nOffside: 5\n\nCorner-Kicks: 4\n\nSaves: 1\n\nSacramento Republic FC â Danny Vitiello; Shane Wiedt (Jonathan Ricketts 84â), Lee Desmond, Jared Timmer; DamiÃ Viader (SebastiÃ¡n Herrera 46â), Luis Felipe, Nick Ross, Jack Gurr; Aldair Sanchez (Blake Willey 90â+5â), Kieran Phillips (Trevor Amann 69â), Cristian Parano (Conor Donovan 90â+3â)\n\nSubstitutes not used: Rafael Jauregui, Jared Mazzola\n\nTotal shots: 11\n\nShots on goal: 2\n\nFouls: 20\n\nOffside: 3\n\nCorner-kicks: 2\n\nSaves: 2\n\n- SOUNDERS FC -"
