        "text": "AZUSA, Calif. â€“ The Colorado State track & field team's multi-events group set the foundation to finish with season-best performances in the heptathlon and decathlon on day one of the Bryan Clay Invitational from Cougar Athletic Stadium on Wednesday.\n\nFreshman Eric Lundgren currently sits in third place in decathlon competition with 3,517 points. Paving the way to his top-three position at the end of day one were performances in his final three events, highlighted by a first-place finish and mark of 46-6.25 (14.18m) in the shot put. The freshman had the best shot put mark of the field by just under five feet on Wednesday. Lundgren followed that with a second-place finish in the high jump (6-2.25/1.89m) and a fourth-place finish in the 400 meters (50.82). Other results for the Cheyenne, Wyo., native included a ninth-place finish in the 100 meters (11.85) and an 11th-place finish in the long jump (20-1.5/6.13m).\n\nSenior Talia Marquez is eighth in heptathlon competition after day one at the Bryan Clay Invitational with 2,923 points. The senior's top performance came in the 100-meter hurdles, where she paced sixth with a time of 15.06. Among the other results for the native of Arvada, Colo., were an eighth-place finish in the 200 meters (25.91, w: 2.1 m/s), a ninth-place finish in the high jump (5-4.25/1.63m) and an 11th-place finish in the shot put (32-0/9.75m).\n\nThe shot put was also a highlight for Gabby Smith, whose fifth-place finish and throw of 37-2.5 (11.34m) highlighted a 2,556-point day one. Along with that mark, the junior's other performances included a time of 26.62 (W: 2.1) in the 200 meters, a time of 17.31 in the 100-meter hurdles and a mark of 4-11.5 (1.51m) in the high jump.\n\nIN THEIR WORDS\n\nColorado State head assistant coach Ryan Baily\n\nOn performances in the heptathlon and decathlon on Wednesday:\n\n\"Everyone's competing well right now. Talia (Marquez) did well and competed throughout. Eric (Lundgren) got off to a little bit of a rough start in the first couple of events but really picked it up over the last three today. He really brought it at the end and had a huge PR in the 400. I think they'll have good days tomorrow, and hopefully with the things we've worked on since our season opener, we can do some special things tomorrow. I'm excited to see how they do.\"\n\nNOTES\n\n- Talia Marquez's high jump mark of 5-4.25 (1.63m) is her best as a member of the Colorado State track & field team, outdoor or indoor.\n\n- Each of Marquez (32-0/9.75m) and Gabby Smith (37-2.5/11.34m) registered their respective outdoor bests in the shot put on Wednesday.\n\n- Eric Lundgren's 400 meters time of 50.82 is a 1.3-second improvement over his previous collegiate best (52.12).\n\n- Lundgren's time of 11.85 in the 100 meters is his best non-wind-aided mark in the event at CSU.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Colorado State track & field team will continue action in the multis at the Bryan Clay Invitational on Thursday, and will be joined by Colorado State distance runners. CSU will also be in competition in the throws at the Pacific Coast Intercollegiate on Thursday."
