        "text": "In May 1943, the Allied Forces determined that a new type of leader was required to win World War II. Operation Jedburgh parachuted three-man teams deep behind enemy lines to win no matter the challenge. Jedburghs lived by the mantra, \"How you prepare today determines success tomorrow.\" Today's leaders are no different. The Jedburgh Media Channel empowers leaders to achieve success on their journey to transform themselves and their organizations. Creator, Host, and Special Forces Green Beret Fran Racioppi interviews the world's most prominent visionaries, drivers of change, and those dedicated to winning no matter the challenge. Each episode is an in-depth discussion with trailblazers whose leadership lessons empower listeners to define success and operate at an elite level, regardless of the task at hand. Join our Jedburgh Team to reach your dreams!"
