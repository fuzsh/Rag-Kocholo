        "text": "‘Hey Mitch, have you tried this new carnivore diet?”\n\nThe question came flying across the table as I dined with members of a mentorship program I’m involved with. We were at a fancy Italian restaurant.\n\nOf course, I said, I had and I’d also heard it was working wonders for some people, but didn’t tell him how I really felt, knowing this gentleman — we’ll call him Roger — was likely looking for validation to do it himself.\n\nLater, I order the bison meatball pasta based on the server’s recommendation, because my approach to fitness allows me to eat my favourite foods in moderation (more on that in a second).\n\nShe makes her way around the table and comes to Roger.\n\n“Just water for me, thanks, I brought my own meal.”\n\nAs soon as the server brings our food, Roger pulls out a Tupperware container with some sort of ice-cold steak, plain, with no side.\n\nNow I’m curious and I ask him how he’s managing to stick to it.\n\n“Oh, the diet doesn’t allow for carbs, so nothing on this menu works. It works fast for weight loss so I’m going to stick to my guns. I don’t mind.”\n\nGreat, I thought, knowing the outcome of this scenario was all too easy to predict.\n\nSure enough, a month later, I asked him in one of our Zoom meetings how it was going.\n\nHe replied “Oh, that carnivore thing? Yeah, I did lose some weight, but I crashed and burned last weekend and went on a carb bender. It was just too restrictive to stick to.”\n\nDING DING DING! Unfortunately, for most mere mortals like you and me, life doesn’t fit the mould of fad diets.\n\nYou think you’ve found the silver bullet, but it doesn’t last, because you’re trying to plan your life around the diet, not the other way around.\n\nNot to mention how awkward and challenging it is carrying around Tupperware with a cold, dry steak at the ready. Believe me, I’ve been there. I was once frisked at the old 4Play sports bar with a chicken breast in my pocket and vowed to never be that extreme again.\n\nThe key to a permanent body transformation is following a diet you enjoy and can stick to, while making small and sustainable sacrifices along the way.\n\nInitially, it might start with having to track your nutrition if you’ve eaten healthy in the past and didn’t see the results you were after.\n\nTracking is the silver bullet most need, but overlook. This doesn’t mean you have to be obsessive about it. And thanks to modern technology, it’s easier than ever.\n\nWhy is this important? Because of the Heisenberg Principle! No, not the infamous character from Breaking Bad played by Bryan Cranston. A now deceased German physicist who wisely identified that what gets measured, gets managed.\n\nHere’s how it works. Picture this: You’ve been a cookie fiend for 20 years, inhaling them like there’s no tomorrow. Now, you decide it’s time for a change. But here’s the twist — instead of going cold turkey and battling the guilt and frustration that follows, you just start tracking your cookie intake.\n\nThat’s it. Count those cookies. Without judgment, track them in an app or by jotting intake down on paper.\n\nMonday: 10 cookies. Tuesday: eight. Wednesday: Oops, 12. Don’t beat yourself up — just observe and jot it down.\n\nAnd here’s where our friend Heisenberg comes in with his principle: the act of observing something changes it. By simply being aware of your cookie consumption, you’re already on the path to improvement, without sweeping changes, fads or extreme measures.\n\nGuess what happens next? Slowly but surely, those cookie numbers start to drop. Not because you’re forcing it, but because awareness is a powerful thing.\n\n“Hmm, I’m eating 1,000 calories worth of cookies, maybe that’s excessive and I should cut back a bit?”\n\nA month later: Down to five per day. Another month: Just one or two a day. Before you know it, you’re shrugging at the cookie jar, thinking, “Meh, I’m good.” And the best part? It was all effortless.\n\nSo, give the Heisenberg hack a try. Track it, don’t attack it.\n\n● ● ●\n\nTracking and the awareness it brings is one thing, but how do you know you’re eating the right amounts? I swear by a simple one-two punch — the CAP Flexibility Framework.\n\nNo more guesswork or wondering why you’re not progressing, despite eating well and exercising. So how do you figure out your numbers? When it comes to calories, that’s the “C” in our acronym, and understanding the basics can be a game-changer. A simple calculation involves multiplying your body weight by a factor of 10 to 12. This provides you with a calorie “range” to aim for, assuming you’re aiming for sustainable weight loss.\n\nSo a 200-pound person would aim to consume between 2,000 and 2,400 calories per day to lose roughly one pound per week (aim for the lower end of the range if you’re less active, and the higher end if you have an active job and exercise regularly).\n\nAdditionally, if you’re looking not just to lose weight, but to specifically target fat loss, multiply your body weight by a factor of 0.8-1. This will give you a protein goal in grams to strive for each day. That’s the “P” in the CAP. This balance ensures you’re fuelling your body right and losing quality weight (not just quantity) sustainably. (If you have 50 pounds to lose, I’d multiple your goal body weight by a factor of 0.8-1)\n\nOnce you have your CAP target, track it for at least two weeks to assess trends and then adjust accordingly depending on what the data (weigh-ins, measurements, photos) suggest is happening.\n\n● ● ●\n\nThe other night, amidst the echoes of splashes at our girls’ swim lessons, I overheard a conversation I couldn’t help but eavesdrop on.\n\nIt was about a fellow parent’s father, battling for life in the ICU with a cocktail of medications just to keep his heart beating and fluid retention at bay.\n\nIt made me pause for a second to reflect. We hustle through our days in an endless pursuit, overlooking the most precious gift we have — our health.\n\nI’ve been wrestling with sleep issues myself and it’s been a journey of ups and downs, as I’ve shared in this space, with no easy solution. But hearing this story, I realized my problems are small in comparison.\n\nBut the reminder I got that night was that health isn’t just about looking good or hitting fitness goals. It’s about being there for our kids’ swim lessons, growing old with our loved ones and living life without the burden of preventable illnesses (not assuming this guy’s was, but you get my point!).\n\nLet’s not wait for a wake-up call to cherish our health. Let’s be grateful for the present, for our body’s strength and for every breath we take. Because in the end, what else do we need? It’s the foundation of all the memories we cherish and the moments we live for.\n\nMitch Calvert is a Winnipeg-based fitness coach who has helped more than 1,400 people transform their bodies and lives over the past decade.
