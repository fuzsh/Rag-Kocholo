        "text": "“Pray at all times—on every occasion, in every season—in the Spirit, with all [manner of] prayer and entreaty. To that end keep alert and watch with strong purpose and perseverance, interceding in behalf of all the saints (God's consecrated people).” Ephesians 6:18 Amplified (Also read Timothy 2:1-4)\n\nThe Apostle Paul exhorted the Ephesians believers to pray with “all prayers\" or \"all manner of prayer.\" Prayer is certainly not a technical issue, so we don't have to fret about how we pray, so long as we are earnestly praying to God.\n\nThat said, it is helpful to examine and practice all types prayers so that we may be more focused and motivated to pray. The scriptures show various types of prayers. Below is brief overview of common types of prayer.\n\n1. Prayer of supplication. 1 Kings 8: 37-40, 54 - 55, Luke 11: 9 - 13, James 5: 17-18\n\nSupplication is a specific request. Theses three scriptures show people were seeking (or asked to seek) for something specific. When you know what is needed, you can offer a prayer of supplication.\n\n2. Prayer of intercession. Genesis 18: 22-33 (Abraham) 1 Kings 18: 41-46 (Elijah) 2 Kings 4: 32-36 (Elisha) Acts 12:1-18 (The early church)\n\nTo intercede means to plead or mediate on behalf of another person. Jesus intercedes for us (Hebrews 7: 25). The Holy Spirit prays for us and through us as we pray in the Spirit (Romans 8: 26 - 27).\n\nWhen we pray earnestly for other people, we enter into the realm of intercession, in which we present people and their needs to God. There is also a dimension to intercession where we \"stand in the gap\" for people for special blessing or protection. (Eze. 22:30)\n\n3. Prayer of faith. Mark 11:12-14, Mark 11:20-25, Luke 7: 1-10, James 5:13-18, Matthew 9:18-26\n\nThe prayer of faith is a supernaturally confident type of prayer, that is absent of doubt. The woman with the issue of blood (Matthew 9) knew that touching Jesus would get her healed. Her faith gave her the strength to press through the crowd. Strong faith and boldness accompany the prayer of faith. This manner of faith releases special blessings and miracles.\n\n4. Prayer of agreement. Genesis 11:1-9, Matthew 18: 19-20, Exodus 17: 8-13, Psalm 133: 1-3, Acts 4:23, Hebrews 10: 24-25\n\nThe prayer of agreement occurs when two or a few people come together (the fewer the better), in agreement with one another and with the Word of God on something God wants to do. The prayer of agreement is connected the authority of God has vested in His church. Prayers of agreement can multiply the effects of God blessings beyond what one can do by oneself.\n\n5. Prayer of praise, worship and thanksgiving. Psalm 100, Acts 16:16-34, Psalm 149:4-9\n\nPraise, worship and thanksgiving can be a form a prayer that brings us into the presence of God. When we praise and thank God, we are affirming our faith in Him. This pleases God and helps our faith. Praise and thanksgiving disarm two of the most deadly enemies to our Christian walk, doubt and fear. No wonder the scriptures call praise a two edged sword (Psalm 149: 4-9)\n\n6. Prayer of Dedication. 1 Kings 8:62-64, Mark 14:36, Acts 7:59, 9:6, 13:3, 14:23\n\nThe prayer of dedication is used to consecrate or dedicate someone or something to God. In the Old Testament, priests, altars, and tabernacles were dedicated by prayer. In the New Testament, Jesus and others dedicated (or ordained) disciples, apostles, elders deacons to the work of God."
