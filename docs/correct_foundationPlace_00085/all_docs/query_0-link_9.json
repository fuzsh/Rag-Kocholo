        "text": "Coming from me who have one sister married and currently lives in 8,550 miles away, one married and lives in 4 hours away by car, and one still studies abroad in America. I just want to say... when you still have the chance to laugh and cry together, have every moments together, and still be able to create a lot of great memories with your family or friends moreover during this special month of the year. Just enjoy it! Because when the time has come, it will be harder and harder to be together. Your small and smaller time with them becomes more and more precious every single time. Hug them tight while you can! ‚ù§Ô∏è and Merry Christmas to all of you and your family! #lovefamily #bekind #greatmoments #familygoals #siblinggoals #mifamilia #lifeadvice #lifelesson #sisterwedding #motivationalquote #motivationalspeaker #precioustime #familyportraits #familytimes #merrychristmas\n\n\"Whatever you want to do, create 1 MEANINGFUL product!\" It was my 1 simple task from my teacher for my final Industrial Design project in University of Washington - Seattle 1 simple instruction that is very difficult to do Really, what does it mean by MEANINGFUL? How can we design a product that is meaningful? I didn't understand it until I just found out the meaning recently when I was wrapping a Christmas gift for a little boy and here's the answer... \"The KEY to a meaningful gift is the LOVE behind it!\" When you love somebody, you empathize deeply with the person You know what they are going through, you understand what they need. You would not go to any marketplace, finding something that you want for a long time with the hope when you give it to the person you love, they'll love it. If you truly understand them, eventually, you'll end up producing or purchasing something that they probably like or need and they'll perceive this act as being MEANINGFUL. The same thing goes for our business or product that we design \"The KEY to a meaningful business or product lies on how much we understand our customer or user\" Our business or design is our gift to the world! Never start designing it with \"what can I sell?\" but, start with \"what do they need?\" If the other people choose JUDGING, you choose UNDERSTANDING. So, entrepreneurs / designers, what meaningful gift you want to give to the world? #meaningfulwork #merrychristmas #understandingothers #giftgiving #businessadvice #designthinking #designchallenge\n\nUpon reflecting on what could have we done without social media, I decided to step away from any of it for these past 6+ months and using it for important matters only. Today, here's what I got mostly: üíö I spent 3x more time with my family and friends (seriously though, let's count how many minutes we spend when we use social media while we are having dinner with our friends / family üòâ) üíö I have around 2 hours extra for sleep or work or do anything that I want üíö In a day, I can meditate 30 minutes in the morning and exercise around 1 - 2 hours in the evening üíö I have learned 9+ new hobbies and skills üíö I have read 4 new books (10 - 30 minutes a day and I can read 2x faster now) And many more... In short, I realized that we have used countless hours living in Social Media. Meanwhile, living in the real world, it's not so bad. We can sharpen our focus more towards our career, self-development, and goals. We can improve our health, mentally and physically. We can have more time sharing moments with lovely people around us. We have such a limited time that we never know when it ends. Please, live mindfully and live a life we'll remember. üòä Have a wonderful day! #happysaturday #saturdaymood #saturdaythoughts #mental #mentalhealth #mindset #lifelessons #physicalhealth #exercise #gotothegym #socialmedia #socialmediapause #instagrambreak #takeabreak #comeback\n\nAround a year ago, I decided to go back to Indonesia for good. Since then, it has been a super interesting year and here's the 6 reasons why: üîª starting my new adventure with: totally lost myself, a lot of friends, even lost my best bestfriend... and got depressed, feeling lonely. (at that time, I wasn't able to answer \"who am I?\", \"what's my hobby?\", and even my favorite color.. it's a very weird feeling) üî∫Ô∏è found my new life here in Indonesia, reconnected with a lot of my old friends, gained more bestfriends, got my Lasik surgery done üîª invested my money in some companies and failed. Almost, ran out of my personal money üò¨ (but, at least, I have learned some valueable lessons from these experiences üòâ) üî∫Ô∏è With my friends, building Bakool, a startup in Indonesia that provides fresh produces from farm to table as the operations and marketing lead. üîª experienced the tough years for startup, ended up pivoting Bakool and quited around the same time. Went back to square one, looking for jobs! üî∫Ô∏è Started this August 2023, I decided to come back to my hometown, taking care of my parents and leading my family business, MAX Indonesia as the CEO. Giving a new look, color, and soul to the business! I'm not sure if it's a crazy or a great move. But, what I'm sure is I'm one step closer to my dream to create a better world for us that's truly believe in kindness by creating some innovative and meaningful companies, the dreams that I used to be laughed at so often. And... now, I'm just getting started üòâ At the end, everything happened within this whole year is shaping me to be a better person. It's great and I'm grateful for it! I know my next journey is not going to be sprinkles and rainbows only. But, I know if we want to have something good, most of the times, we need to go through something painful first. üòä And one more thing, like Walt Disney once said, \"all our dreams can come true if we have the COURAGE to pursue them\" Have a Magical day! ‚ú®Ô∏è #lifejourney #adventure #castmember #disneylife #motivation #goal #disneyquotes #lifelessons #entrepreneurlife #career\n\n\"You already have an amazing degree from a great school in the U.S., why don't you just stay there? Why did you decide to come back to Indonesia?\" I got this question quite often from big family, friends, and some people I've met through work. To be honest, if you asked me when this picture was taken, I wouldn't be able to answer you too. This is me, 3 and a half years ago, contemplating the same question. Why come back? Why not continue living in the states? At that time, U.S. has been my home for 7 years, I've met a lot of amazing friends, experienced a lot of things. I'm already comfortable to live there. But, there was a little sparks in me, telling me that I'm scared. I'm afraid if I'm just too comfortable there because U.S. is my safe zone now. Meanwhile, there are still a lot of challenges in Indonesia that I can help, make impact. I know, from the bottom of my heart, I want to create something big, impactful, meaningful, and innovative for Indonesia and the world. I love risk and challenges because that's what make us grow. Hence, after multiple sleepless night, I decided to come back to Indonesia. I'm still not sure where this leads me to. But, one thing I'm sure, as long as I'm always prepared, do my best, and don't give up. There's always something great ahead of us. #storyofmylife #motivation #makeimpact #unitedstates #immigrant #forgood #sanfrancisco #menmodel #yellowcar #goldengate #fortpoint #photoshoot #travel\n\nLearning flows in everywhere. From teacher to student, student to teacher, and sometimes, it can goes from teacher to \"Super Boss\". In designx.company , I made friendship with my co-worker, a Toy Design teacher lead, Ruihong Jiang . She is amazing in making plush toys and she really loves to call me, \"Super Boss\" (Yes, I still don't know where it comes from too üòÑ). I still remembered the day i told her, \"one day, I want to be able to make a plush toy like you\". She did teach me after that. During my break, she invited me to sit next to her, showed me how to sew basic toys, and let me do it by myself. She also inspired me to make a half-fruit half-animal toy. So, that's where my Koinana come to life. A half-banana half-Koi fish. Again, she showed me the basic pattern and after I knew how to make it, I love to take it further, challenged myself. Koinana has 3 layer fleece to make the banana part. It burned my brain when I need to assemble it. But, I'm glad that I could get it done with the help from Rui too. Thank you, Rui! I can't do it without you! #design #thankyou #learning #friendship #coworking #business #toydesign #industrialdesign"
