        "text": "Our History\n\nThe Bryan Museum arose from humble beginnings. At age ten, J.P. Bryan acquired his first two pieces, a Moore’s Patent Front Loading Revolver and a Sharps Patent Four-Barrel Derringer. Both firearms still reside in the collection today.\n\nIn October 2013, J.P. and Mary Jon Bryan purchased the old Galveston Orphans Home in Galveston, Texas. After a careful restoration of the historic structure, The Bryan Museum opened in June 2015. With 20,000 square feet of exhibit space and lush, manicured grounds, it has become a Texas destination.\n\nFrom there, the collection expanded both rapidly and eclectically. With a focus on artists who lived during the West’s Golden Age or when “the dust was still settling,” the museum’s art collection presents a unique opportunity for visitors to personally experience that period of history.\n\nWhile attending the University of Texas, Bryan started a rare book and printing business with a friend. It was during this period that he began focusing his collecting on Texana. He started with rare books, in which he had a keen interest. Bryan’s uncle, Judge Lewis Wilson of Brazoria County, willed his impressive collection of Texas literature to Bryan, providing him with a strong foundation."
