        "text": "Target’s Ask\n\nTarget employees expressed a desire to enhance the communities in which they live and work.\n\nTarget saw this as an opportunity to amplify their Environmental, Social and Governance goals, specifically in the value they bring to their communities. They were looking for a partner who could scale thoughtful, high-impact local projects across the entire nation.\n\nArbor Day Foundation’s Answer\n\nNot every community has the same need — which is why the Arbor Day Foundation worked with Target to identify key necessities in the areas they wanted to plant.\n\nStretching across America from Philadelphia to Santa Barbara, our local network helped plant trees that served a variety of needs — including low-income neighborhoods with low-canopy coverage, food desert communities that needed sustenance, and cities damaged by wildfires and natural disasters.\n\nChurch & Dwight’s Ask\n\nWith heritage in conservation efforts, Church & Dwight launched their mission in 2017 to achieve carbon neutrality by 2025.\n\nHowever, after two years of energy reduction initiatives, they were searching for opportunities to reach carbon neutrality in a more economically viable way.\n\nTheir next frontier was focused on offsetting, primarily through forestry carbon credits and renewable energy credits (RECs) — and they needed a partner to help them navigate the path forward.\n\nArbor Day Foundation’s Answer\n\nTo ensure Church & Dwight would meet its target, the Arbor Day Foundation examined the source of their carbon offset challenges — finding fossil fuels and corporate travel as the primary culprits. And since RECs fail to offset fossil fuels, the Arbor Day Foundation created a program that filled the gap.\n\nThe Arbor Day Foundation used Church & Dwight’s offsetting program to not only reinforce their long-time support of wildlife conservation — but also target an area of high need: restoring degraded crop lands in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley.\n\nWilliams-Sonoma, Inc.’s Ask\n\nAs the world’s largest digital-first, design-led and sustainable home retailer, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (WSI) is committed to using responsibly sourced wood in their furniture.\n\nIn January 2021 Pottery Barn, a premier specialty retailer under Williams-Sonoma, Inc. partnered with the Arbor Day Foundation to plant 3 million trees by 2023. The success and impact of Pottery Barn’s planting efforts prompted several other brands in the WSI family (Pottery Barn Kids, Pottery Barn Teen, West Elm, Rejuvenation, and Williams Sonoma Home) to join the cause. Working as a team, these brands committed to doubling their planting efforts, resulting in an expanded goal of 6 million trees planted by 2023.\n\nArbor Day Foundation’s Answer\n\nIn its first year alone, Pottery Barn’s campaign planted 1.5 million trees in forests with the most need, spanning from Indonesia to Oregon.\n\nWith the groundwork already in place for the initial campaign, the Arbor Day Foundation was able to quickly scale its efforts to accommodate the profound new goal and get WSI’s home-furnishing brands — six in all — up to speed. The increased participation along with the Arbor Day Foundation’s experience and world-wide network of planting partners, ensured that we could help WSI grow its efforts twofold."
