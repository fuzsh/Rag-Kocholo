        "text": "Four years ago, I started my journey as a medical student in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at the University at Buffalo. My medical education started with the toughest course of all. Anatomy! And my worst nightmare came true during my first exam for the course. My laptop battery died in the middle of the exam. I had to stop taking the exam in order to find a suitable charger. Rather than focusing on the answers to difficult human anatomy questions, I kept hoping and praying that my battery on this old and dying laptop would last till the end of the exam.\n\nDefinitely not the best way to start the most challenging year at the medical school, where the amount of information that gets thrown at you is considered equivalent to drinking from a fire hose. Now imagine doing that, with limp hands and useless legs, on a paralyzed body, stuck in a motorized wheelchair. And do you care to know how that happened?\n\nAt the age of 21, I suffered a spinal cord injury, after being hit by a drunk driver on my neighborhood road. Following many months of rehabilitation, I returned to the community with a heart full of hope, but soon I realized how difficult it is for a quadriplegic person to thrive in this society, designed for and ruled by able-bodied individuals. But what made me still hang on to my dream of becoming a doctor was the love and support I received from my friends, families and even strangers who believed in me.\n\nOne such wonderful support came from the Travis Roy Foundation, dedicated to improving the lives of individuals with spinal cord injuries. It was the laptop I received from the foundation that put an end to that nightmare for good, and allowed me to take subsequent medical school exams with peace of mind. It was a great support at that time, as I embarked on a journey through an already expensive academic pursuit. The laptop has helped me during my basic science courses, especially to take exams, as well as my clinical rotations in the hospitals and outpatient clinics.\n\nSo now after four years, upon my graduation from the medical school, I want to convey my heartfelt gratitude to all the members of the foundation who work tirelessly to make the world a better place for individuals like me. And to all those great souls who provide their unconditional support for the great cause of this foundation. You may not get to see the smile you put on all of our faces, but know for sure that all you do every day has a tremendous impact on our happiness and success!\n\nThank you!\n\nFarzana\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\nMay 15, 2020\n\nWell it‚Äôs been six months and a pandemic since we finished the kitchen but I finally got a picture for you with the Travis Roy sign. This is our son and his best friend James cooking. Prior to the pandemic, James came every Friday night to cook with Spenser. It was sooooo hard for them to do it in our old galley kitchen. This new kitchen is a dream!! Thank you and the Travis Roy foundation for your co tribute on to help make this happen!! We are blessed and forever grateful!!\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\nApril 10, 2020\n\nI‚Äôm so excited and so grateful and thankful for this grant. I have had an incredible experience at Spaulding and will be eternally grateful to them for the care and expertise of traumatic spinal cord injuries. I feel very blessed for the opportunity of applying for the Travis Roy Foundation Grant. I felt it was a long shot, but I‚Äôm so glad I applied. I can‚Äôt thank you enough! Thank you Travis Roy for all the good you do on making a difference in people‚Äôs lives. I continue to work towards getting home. The ramp has been installed and I am looking forward to using it in the very near future and gaining my independence back. üòä\n\nGod bless you all!\n\nAlways in faith, love, peace, joy and eternally grateful ‚Ä¶Susan\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\nJanuary 28, 2020\n\nI‚Äôm blessed and Highly favored by God, to have been awarded to be a recipient of this most gracious and prestigious Grant by the Travis Roy Foundation. I‚Äôm humbled and thankful, to say the very least. This is amazing!! My family is ecstatic!!! We‚Äôre extremely appreciative for your generosity.\n\nI haven‚Äôt taken my van back for the repairs yet, but at least now I‚Äôll be able to receive the services needed. I‚Äôm also thankful the grant can be used over the course of 1 yr, instead of having to use it all at once.\n\nAgain, thanks from the bottom of my heart‚ô•Ô∏è\n\nRhett\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\nJanuary 27, 2020\n\nOn behalf of my father, James, my husband and I want to thank the Travis Roy Foundation for the grant for his power chair. His life has changed for the better, as a result. Upon delivering it to him, he said, ‚ÄúI was dreaming about my chair and that looks just like it did in my dream!‚Äù Since receiving his chair, he has been getting out of bed and getting dressed every day. He leaves his room for meals, goes to the lobby to poke outside for some fresh air and goes down the hall to engage in his wellness exercises. He has traveled to MassGeneral to meet with some specialists who will be part of his rehab team. He was able to get to Journey-Forward for a tour and is planning to attend their program for his rehab, as well. And, for Christmas, he went on a home visit for the first time in 15 mos. since his injury! It was the best gift. He now realizes he can make more progress, all as a result of receiving his power chair and gaining some more independence. We are very grateful. Thank You, beyond words.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\nJanuary 17, 2020\n\nI am writing this letter to express my sincere gratitude for awarding me a grant for a\n\nnew computer.\n\nThank You, because, with this new computer, I will embark on a journey for\n\nindependence! It will open great opportunities for me, and for that I am grateful. I will\n\npursue my interest in creative arts and music entrepreneurship. Without this grant\n\nthat wouldn‚Äôt be possible.\n\nI also want to thank the Trustees who were sympathetic and took my request under\n\nConsideration.\n\nIt‚Äôs an amazing feeling to have been fortunate enough to be considered and\n\nAwarded.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJonathon\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\nJanuary 5, 2020\n\nThank you so much for my daughter‚Äôs new bed. It arrived on Christmas Eve. We took a picture with her in her new bed. Please find it attached.\n\nAgain, thank you so much! You made my little girl very happy!!! And it couldn‚Äôt have arrived on a better day.\n\nGod Bless you,\n\nHappy New Year!!!\n\nAngie\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\nNovember 14, 2019\n\nToday is day 2 after discharge. We went for a walk of our neighborhood. That is possible thanks to you and the Foundation. Without it we would have had to move. Now due to the ramp we can stay in our apartment and focus on moving forward versus moving homes. Thank you.\n\nJosh\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\nJune 13, 2019\n\nI thank you and the Travis Roy Foundation for the grant. The wheelchair Smart Drive Power Assist Unit has made an improvement in my daily activity and less painful. Also it has given me more independent living.\n\nThis helps me assist patients with spinal cord injuries at Hospital and Acute Rehabilitation Facility as a Peer Mentor.\n\nVictor\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\nJune 4, 2019\n\nMe, Jennifer, and my family would like to thank the Travis Roy Foundation for giving us the donation to put in a ramp. It makes my life more accessible and easier. Now I can go places without being scared to come out. Thank you all for the help.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJennifer\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\nMay 18, 2019\n\nI just want to thank you for the generosity you have displayed by granting me funds so I can adapt my vehicle.\n\nSince my spinal cord injury it has been difficult adjusting to this new lifestyle. Being able to modify my vehicle gave me the opportunity to drive my car again. It has done so much for me. It allowed me to return to work but more importantly, it gave me the feeling of being able to live a normal life again. Words can‚Äôt express my gratitude.\n\nJason\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\nApril 16, 2019\n\nWe cannot thank you enough for your support. The generous donation was put towards an elevator that provides Ryan freedom of movement throughout our home.\n\nBest wishes for the continued success and generosity of the Travis Roy Foundation. You make big positive impacts on the lives of people in need.\n\nKen\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\nApril 11, 2019\n\nOn July 22, 2018 when I was competing in Montana‚Äôs Big Sky State Games in a mountain bike event, I went over the handlebars of my bike, breaking my neck at the C6 and C7 level and sustained a substantial spinal cord injury leaving me a quadriplegic. I underwent surgery to stabilize my neck, spent ten days in intensive care and four months in rehab at Craig Hospital.\n\nWhen I got out of the hospital and back to my old bed, I realized how uncomfortable it was and I was very concerned about getting pressure sores. With the Travis Roy Foundation Grant that I was awarded, I was able to purchase a Purple 3 mattress with an adjustable base. My Purple 3 mattress was built using technology specifically designed to prevent pressure sores and skin break down. The mattress is soft enough that I am finally able to get a comfortable night sleep and it is firm enough that I do not sink down and I am able to move around to reposition and transfer myself. The adjustable base is a great feature allowing me to raise and lower my head and feet into multiple positions which is nice for circulation and comfort. It is hard to put in words how much I appreciate the Travis Roy Foundation for their financial help and making my life so much better.\n\nTHANK YOU,\n\nBryce\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nApril 5, 2019\n\nHi!!!!\n\nI received assistance from your foundation a year ago and I just would like to say how thankful I am of all your help. It‚Äôs because of you I‚Äôm on my feet standing tall again. I just would like to say thanks a million times and I will be forever grateful of your support!!!!! If there is anything else I can assist with please contact me as soon as time permits!!!!\n\nThanks,\n\nKarsten\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\nMarch 18, 2019\n\nThank you! Thank you! Thank you!\n\nChuck and I would like to thank you for your generous gift of a seat elevator for his new wheelchair. This will greatly improve Chuck‚Äôs independence.\n\nMay God bless you richly,\n\nLove, Chuck and Rene\n\nDavid Baggett\n\nThank you for your compassion and understanding and helping keep Christopher moving forward, focusing on getting stronger, independent and hopefully one day to walk again.\n\nChristopher, Charles, and Belinda Cameron\n\nMarc Carignan\n\nMary & Martin Muench\n\nI wanted to take this opportunity to thank you and all of those responsible for the financial assistance. The van that I purchased back in April 2014 would probably still be sitting in my garage without your help, It had a lift on it already but was not set up so I could drive it. I needed power door openers, a power seat base, and hand controls to be able to drive it independently.\n\nI picked up my van from having the additional modifications made on June 20. What a change over the 1985 van that I had been driving! I‚Äôve owned and driven that van since it was new. The van I bought in 2014 was a 2011 model with only 18,000 miles. Oh what a difference a 26 year newer vehicle makes!! Although the 1985 has been like one of the family.\n\nI know thank you just doesn‚Äôt seem like nearly enough! My deepest heartfelt thanks for your assistance in helping me to keep my independence.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDavid B. Horsfall\n\nDear Travis Roy Foundation,\n\nI would like to thank you for the grant you have given me for my computer. As you know, the complications that come with a spinal cord injury do not stop a few months after being injured; they are life long and new ones come and go. Recently, over the past few months, I have been experiencing severe stomach pains and have not been comfortable enough to attend school nor have I been comfortable enough to enjoy the things that I like to do.\n\nThe computer that your Foundation as purchased for me will allow me to catch up on my high school work and allow me to move on to college where my computer will continue to help me to progress into my future with confidence.\n\nThough my stomach pains are temporary (I hope), the love and understanding I feel when working at my computer will always be there and I thank you so much for what your foundation does for people with spinal cord injuries. My accident was life changing and so is this computer (in a great way). My hopes and dreams for a better than normal life and career, will now be easier to achieve.\n\nThank you\n\nDavid\n\nI just finished my first year of medical school at the University of Wisconsin. It was a year full of challenges and triumphs, and I am convinced that medicine is my true calling.\n\nThank you to your organization for support students who have overcome spinal cord injuries. I hope to serve as a mentor for students with disabilities who want to become doctors. Again, Thank You.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJeff Mahlum\n\nDear Travis Roy Foundation,\n\nThank you so much for awarding me a grant for an iPod for my medical education. This technology will be invaluable for studying purposes, and I am so grateful for this. Your support truly means a lot. I finished my first semester of medical school, and I started the second semester last week. It has been going really well, and I am excited for gross anatomy this semester. Again, thank you so much for your support!\n\nSincerely,\n\nJeff Mahlum\n\nDear Travis Roy Foundation,\n\nI would like to thank Travis Roy Foundation for their generous gift that will allow me to continue leading an active and independent life. Spinal cord injury puts all sorts of limitations and challenges in people‚Äôs lives, and I am very grateful that with your help I will be able to overcome one of these challenges. Installation of hand controls in my car brought self sufficiency back into my life and will make my unlimited mobility possible.\n\nMarina\n\nDear Travis Roy Foundation,\n\nThank you very much for the grant, [for] the computer and dragon software. They are both going to be very helpful for school which I‚Äôm sure you know is more difficult. My family and I have appreciated your support and help through out this. Hope all is well.\n\nDan Waite\n\nDear Travis Roy Foundation,\n\nThank you so much for your kindness. The computer will be very helpful to Kelly. You have made a difficult year that much better.\n\nThank you.\n\nMary Ann ‚Äì Kelly Dwyer‚Äôs Mother\n\nDear Travis Roy Foundation,\n\nThank you very much for the grant to pay for my platform lift. It has truly changed my life. I was not able to get out of my house by myself, and now I can get out anytime I need or want to.\n\nOnce again, thank you very much. Words cannot express the gratitude I have for your organization. People with SCI are blessed to have you to help out in our time of great need.\n\nThank you\n\nGary Shandera\n\nDear Sirs and Madams\n\nI‚Äôm writing this note to express how grateful I‚Äôm for having receiving your charitable gift which is a new laptop computer. In fact, it is more than a computer that I got. It is the materialization of the love and care of the noble Travis Roy Foundation towards vulnerable people.\n\nHappiness is an understatement!\n\nThanks so much!\n\nBlaise\n\nDear Travis Roy Foundation,\n\nWe are truly grateful for your commitment and dedication to helping family‚Äôs like ours who are adapting and living fully in the setting of a spinal cord injury. On October 27, 2012, we were stunned with the unimaginable, a football injury resulting in a catastrophic spinal cord injury to our son, Sterling Thomas. We found ourselves in need of your support and you came through for us.\n\nWith your grant of $2467, a shower chair has been purchased and delivered to Sterling. Thanks to you, Sterling is able to luxuriate in what most of us take for granted‚Ä¶a steamy, warm shower! Yes, Sterling is glad to have a shower chair which allows him to perform his personal care with greater independence and dignity.\n\nAgain, thank you, Travis Roy Foundation, so much for helping Sterling and our family to ‚ÄúMove Forward‚Äù.\n\nSterling Thomas and family\n\nThank you for awarding me this amazing grant for a computer. I am very excited to receive it in the next few weeks and be able to independently do school work. I am very excited that I will have some assistive technology to help me maneuver the computer so that I can be successful in completing my work. Having this computer will help me be one step closer in achieving my goal to becoming an accessibility and sustainability consultant in the design field. Thank you!\n\nKelley Gaddu\n\nAt this time around Thanksgiving, we are reminded of all the blessings we‚Äôve received thru the year‚Ä¶.. The greatest blessing was the grant given to my brother Karl Seitz, from your generous Foundation. He is loving the amazing computer he recently received. It will allow him to communicate with his doctors to keep them updated in his daily care. Most of all, it connects him to the bigger world and he will be able to feel productive and less isolated.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äù thank you from the bottom of our hearts. You are an angel sent from above to help others in need.\n\nJulie Hello\n\nI just broke down in tears, the happiest tears out of any of my daily tears over the past 6 months. Please extent mine, and my sister‚Äôs enormous gratitude to the foundation. I don‚Äôt even know what to say, I‚Äôm very taken back in relief, tears and overwhelmed that someone is going to help her. God Bless You and The Foundation ‚Äì please let me them know that gratitude isn‚Äôt a big enough word, there are no words.\n\nKimberly Friedson\n\nIt‚Äôs 7p.m. CDT and I AM SPEECHLESS. God bless you and the Board and I may have understated just how much of a ‚Äúblessing‚Äù this is. I have slept on a recliner since my accident and the last time I tried a mattress was when forced to evacuate during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. I laid down for perhaps an hour and had to sleep in the motel chair. THANK YOU so much and I should overcome this shock by tomorrow and will work on new estimates to keep the price at or under $700. I will be in touch with you before Thursday and thank you again. I thought the Board had voted by now and had given up hope.\n\nSheryl\n\nOMNI Behavioral Health wishes to thank the Travis Roy Foundation for the generous grant to help install a wheelchair ramp for an individual we work with in the small rural town of Ithaca Nebraska. With the new ramp, which will be installed next week, he will be able to enjoy more activities with his family and regular trips to church and out to eat, and attend his regular doctor appointments in Omaha. In the next few weeks I am sure you will be hearing from his guardian and other family members also about the newly installed ramp. We appreciate the fact that there are organizations that are willing to support the disabled individuals in our nation to live their lives fully and completely to the best of their ability. Thank-you for allowing this to be accomplished in a timely manner.\n\nDeborah Monfelt BFA, MFA, Extended Family Home Coordinator\n\nWe are sooooo appreciative of the grant to help us out with the ceiling lift. It is truly so much help for me when I am putting Bill in the bed at night, and getting him up in the morning. He weighs around 250 and even though we transfer on a slide board I am doing at least 60% of the work. The lift makes it so much easier.\n\nThank you and the Travis Roy family and Foundation. What a wonderful gift you are giving.\n\nLove, Susie Gurley\n\nDear Travis Roy Foundation:\n\nThank you for the Grant for the Dell Computer. I just wanted to share with you what the grant will do for me and my future. First I would like to give you a little background on myself. I have been paralyzed from a swimming accident since June of 1990 and I have worked extremely hard to not let my paralysis dictate my life, or my dreams, for that matter. I have two children that I had after my accident. I have a daughter Britt she is 15 this upcoming April and my son Tyler is turning 12 Feb 13th. They are the reason I keep fighting the fight so to speak.\n\nI have been successful at virtually everything I have set my mind to doing from raising my children to working countless hours at my previous corporate career with AT&T. I believe each and every one of us has what it takes to accomplish the dreams we have. I decided to go to school after being laid off during the rough economy. I had numerous setbacks that financially put me in a position that I was not sure if I could afford to go to college. I realized that I needed some help to get through the temporary issues. So I started researching and came across your foundation and it has truly been a blessing. I will be able to complete my education in a timely manner and continue to support my family. Thank you again for having such a wonderful foundation. If there is anything I can ever do in the future for the foundation please don‚Äôt hesitate to contact me.\n\nSincerely, Jason Lindahl\n\nMany thanks to Travis Roy and to each of the trustees of this extraordinary foundation for your dedication to helping improve the lives of so many. I am a recent beneficiary of your kindness and generosity, having received a grant to purchase a standing frame, which will undoubtedly have profoundly positive effects on my physical and psychological health.\n\nFrom the bottom of my heart, I thank you.\n\nRebecca Tripp\n\nHello Travis Roy Foundation, I want to thank you for everything your Foundation has done for me. I have the best computer set-up anybody could ask for. I get compliments from visitors walking by my room.\n\nThanks again.\n\nMATTHEW BLAVAT\n\nI would like to express my sincerest gratitude to the Travis Roy Foundation for the generous grant awarded to me. Because of this grant I am on my way to a more independent life!\n\nThanks Again,\n\nBen Goss\n\nTo the Travis Roy Foundation\n\nI cannot express how much we thank you for the money you have donated to the Jackson Family They have are the appointment for the wheelchair lift to be installed.\n\nYou have provided hope when there was none to find. Thank you to your staff, board members, and the Travis Roy Foundation for what you have done.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSheila Matson (Marvin Jackson Family)\n\nDear Friends,\n\nWe write to express our appreciation and gratefulness on behalf of Ed and Carol Gregory. Ed is a quadriplegic cared for at home by his wife Carol since 2009. The Foundation approved the purchase of a $2100 shower chair in Dec 2011. The chair is a God-send and makes it immensely easier to bathe Ed and keep him clean. When told of your approval of the chair, he said, ‚ÄúYou mean I can now get a shower?‚Äù Since sponge baths has been his lot for two years and more, he was elated, as was Carol. So thanks to your donors for opening their hearts and wallets to those who suffer and are in great need. Thanks to the Board for choosing Ed as a recipient of not-enough-funds to go around for the many requests from which you must choose. Thanks to your very helpful and efficient staff which interfaces with the public. God bless you all beautifully.\n\nHazel and Gary Bovard (friends of Ed and Carol)\n\nDear Travis Roy Foundation,\n\nI am writing to you all at the Travis Roy Foundation to express my sincere and deepest appreciation for your help fixing my kitchen.\n\nThe difference you made in my daily life is so incredible and my life has become much easier. There really are no proper words except on the bottom of your stationery ‚ÄúHelping others move Forward‚Äù. I have to say that does say a lot and you all have given me a chance to move forward and be so much more independent.\n\nI will forever be grateful and will send you photographs in a a few weeks.\n\nSincerely,\n\nNoel Cariere\n\nTo the Travis Roy Foundation!\n\nThank you for the grant to help me be able to get my new wheelchair! Ya‚Äôll are a life saver‚Ä¶.\n\nThanks so much,\n\nTeresa A. Myer\n\nDear Travis Roy and Foundation,\n\nI would like to thank you for your kind and generous grants I applied for in 2011. Your grants allow me to live as independently as I can. My new computer is running and my environmental control unit in my apartment is just great. Also the grant for my new wheelchair necessities has allowed me to get rid of my broken and unrepairable wheelchair.\n\nThanks again,\n\nBrian Kandal\n\nTo the Trustees of the Travis Roy Foundation and staff:\n\nAs we all gather for Christmas and the New Year with family and friends, I will be reflecting on all that brings meaning and joy to my life. I will be thinking of all the new friends that I have made through my new life‚Äôs journey. I want you to know that I am so proud and grateful to the Travis Roy Foundation for the great gift to help me continue my new life. This door opener will allow me to get in and out of my house by myself, and let me have more freedom then before. The Travis Roy Foundation has gone above and beyond by helping people get back to a better level of life.\n\nAt this time of the year, we have been taught that it‚Äôs ‚Äúbetter to give then to receive‚Äù. I have always been a giver, but this is one gift that I‚Äôm very happy to receive. This just goes to show me about how my life has touched so many others. It is true; I am having ‚ÄúA WONDERFUL LIFE‚Äù through good times and bad! Your donation shows me that I must be here to make a difference on my life or influence someone else‚Äôs life. Even through a tragedy, you must keep your head up, because you don‚Äôt known how you may affect others.\n\nAgain, Thank You, and I will keep you in my prayers.\n\nMERRY CHRISTMAS and HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!\n\nMay you all have many more. Please keep up the great work!\n\nDale H. Steuer\n\nDear Travis Roy Foundation,\n\nThank you for the grant of 5,000.00 for van modifications. You have gave me the gift of independence of a life time. I have been able to volunteer in my community, work and have a social life. And for that, I thank you!\n\nRecently, I volunteered for the city cleanup sweep. I wore a shirt that said, ‚ÄúWe matter We contribute‚Äù. I think it‚Äôs important to show awareness of the disability community. I hope it inspires people to realize.. if she can contribute in a wheelchair, I can too!\n\nIt‚Äôs only possible for me to help others, because you helped me!\n\nGod Bless you, Have a Merry x-mas & Happy New Year!\n\nToni Martin\n\nI know I have expressed in previous e-mails for the graciousness of this grant and how it would allow me to pay it forward and hopefully as the bills shows I spent this money frugally.\n\nI can‚Äôt imagine how many applications come in each month and what an arduous task that must be for the Board of Directors to make difficult decisions on disbursements.\n\nSometimes in life, things happen too fast. Every day we face interruptions, delays, changes, and challenges; when we are feeling overwhelmed, one simple concept that can get us through the most stressful of times is gratitude! It‚Äôs the gratitude that comes from the Travis Roy foundation that give others the wherewithal and fortitude to carry on. I believe Travis and his foundation have truly epitomized the word‚Äù SELFLESSNESS‚Äù\n\nDan Iagatta III\n\nI heard about Travis Roy long before my brother Daniel Iagatta‚Äôs c4 injury in 2004 and I certainly didn‚Äôt know, at the time, that it would impact us in a positive way.\n\nHe is 48 years old. He has been driving for 5 or 6 years now and when he received his new chair he wasn‚Äôt able to do as much and he wasn‚Äôt getting around as much. I would love to thank the Travis Roy Foundation, on behalf of myself and Dan‚Äôs family, for retrofitting his new chair to his van in order to gain his independence back.\n\nAs a master plumber of 23 years, paramedic,pt firefighter , he has given so much to the community and now the community has given him so much in return. Thanks to this foundation he can continue to deliver meals to the homebound for ‚ÄúMeals on wheels‚Äù, teach religious education for Saint Mary‚Äôs in Foxboro and most recently he just landed a teaching job! Thank you again for giving him back his freedom. üôÇ\n\nMarilyn Iagatta Kristenson\n\nYou have made our day, month and year. What a wonderful surprise it was to get your note. We are trying to save more money to do the full conversion and appreciate the year of time to reach that goal. Hopefully we will reach it sooner than later ‚Äì this grant really helps us get on our way! I look forward to sending pictures of me in the van with my three little girls. I will keep you posted. Please extend my deepest gratitude to all in your organization and to the trustees. I wish you all could be here today to feel the joy we are feeling. Words do not do my feelings justice. THANK YOU! Your grant has not only changed today, but many days in the future.\n\nTruly, Sam Russell\n\nThank you so much for negotiating this and sorry if it was any hassle. I have had the wheels now for 4 months and without them I would not have had the independence I enjoy now. Not to mention they are kind of fun. I can wheel for miles and it is a breeze!\n\nTravis Roy did a talk at the prep school I attended, Brooks School, when I was there around 2003 or 2004. I never thought years later that I myself would face his challenges and I remember him to this day. In this light, the grant the Foundation has awarded me is even more special. I am both touched and extremely grateful that there are people out there who understand my needs and are willing to help out! I will send you all a photo of me with my wheels in the near future.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDaniela Schirmer\n\nI would like to thank you for helping realize my dream. You played such a huge role in this entire process. Thanks to you I have obtained a huge degree of independence. I appreciate all of your time, energy, and effort that you have invested in order for me to obtain my dream computer.\n\nGod bless you and your family,\n\nEli Alvarado\n\nI received my new ultralightwieght wheelchair today and I just can‚Äôt thank you enough for allowing me to keep my independence. Its been along time since a smile that big has been on my face, and thanks to you I can keep up with the best of them. As I stroll down the road I enjoy my freedom, and the outside world and now I have the wheelchair to do it all in style. You are no doubt my angel, and as far as I know I can‚Äôt thank you enough for how grateful I am that there was someone like me out there to understand my situation. So again a lifetime of thank you‚Äôs, and god bless. Sincerely, David Curtin\n\nTo Everyone at Travis Roy,\n\nI would like to say thank you for the funding that you provided which allowed me to get the lift for my pick-up truck so I can take my power wheelchair outside of the 4 walls of my home. Your generosity means so much to me and has given me new hope. I can now go places I hadn‚Äôt been able to in years ‚Äì including my appointments!\n\nYou‚Äôve made my life so much easier and joyful. I would never have been able to afford this on my own.\n\nGod Bless you All. Thanks Again,\n\nCarl Clark\n\nThank you for helping others move forward!!!\n\nTravis Roy Foundation,\n\nThank you so much for getting me the funds for the head mouse. I am still learning to use it but it is giving me something to do with my time! Living at a nursing home is hard, but this helps make it better.\n\nMark Hosking\n\nI just wanted to say thank you to everyone at Travis Roy (Foundation) for allowing me to keep my independence by helping me purchase an ultralight wheelchair. I can honestly say what would I have done without a caring Foundation like the TRF. I got the call from Brenda on Monday and all I could do was cry happy tears when I received the message that I got my grant. Never give up the battle for those that are suffering from a spinal cord injury, I know I haven‚Äôt. Thanx again. David\n\nTo all at Travis Roy,\n\nI recently received funding from the Travis Roy Foundation to pay for modifications to my van to make it wheelchair accessible. The van came out great! I‚Äôm happy with it. The new conversion done by HDS of GA, has a 9‚Ä≥ cut in the floor, making my driving from a power chair easy, comfortable, and safe.\n\nSpecial thanks to the Travis Roy Foundation for understanding the issue of independence and assisting people that can then help themselves and others.\n\nI am forwarding some pictures of the van. Investing in people with disabilities returns us to productivity. We are all in this together.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBart Brophy\n\nMr. Roy,\n\nThere are no words to say thank you for your wonderful gift of independence, as I am sure you are aware, how important that is in daily living. You and the Foundation are inspirational to all of us who live this challenging life. Also, I would like you to know how wonderful Mrs. Taylor and the Morse‚Äôs are ‚Äì you chose well, and I am so blessed for getting the opportunity to get to know them. I hope that if you are ever on the Cape, that I have a chance to meet you and thank you in person.\n\nSincerely,\n\nInez\n\nThank you so much for everything you have done for Grace and our family. Thank you so much for your generosity, kindness, and awesomeness. We will cherish your kindness for now and forever. Words cannot express our gratitude!\n\nWith Love,\n\nThe Meek Family\n\nMy name is Christopher Miller and I would like to thank the Travis Roy Foundation for the grant of $1400 for a new computer, printer and portable hand controls for a car. I don‚Äôt know how I could have got this without the foundation. I would like to thank all at the Travis Roy Foundation for what they have done for me. Thank You and god bless the Travis Roy Foundation.\n\n-Christopher Miller\n\nPost spinal cord injury my ‚Äúlife‚Äù has changed. Maneuvering around home is always a formidable task. My wife constantly picks-up after our two daughters (ages 5 & 9), but it is like shoveling during a snow storm‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.minimal results. My girls fill the house with love and joy, but continually litter the floor with books, toys, shoes. All of which make wheelchair mobility rough. Fortunately, we are now able to utilize our downstairs (family room, toy room, kitchen) due to a newly constructed ramp. I can now roll around my property far more efficient. This foundation provided me the ability to acheive further independence, without their aid and support this could not have happened. Thanks for all your much needed support.\n\nThank You,\n\nEric Shairs\n\nTo the Travis Roy Foundation:\n\nI would like to offer my sincerest thank you for the funding that you provided that allowed me to purchase an Easystand Evolv Standing Frame.\n\nThroughout my life I have always made my health and physical fitness a top priority. Since my skiing injury and associated quadriplegia I have realized even more so how extremely important it is to take care of my body. I regularly go to physical therapy to work on my strength and conditioning, eat a healthy balanced diet, and maintain an active lifestyle. This was all great in maintaining what strength I did have in a wheelchair, but did little to challenge my body in an upright position. The only way I could do this was with the purchase of a standing frame, something that was financially far outside my budget.\n\nThis is where your foundation was so helpful. By providing me the funding to purchase a standing frame you have given me the perfect piece of equipment to help challenge my body and build fitness in ways that I could have never done before. My balance has improved, I feel lightheaded less often, and the psychological feeling of being tall again is so incredible it‚Äôs hard to explain.\n\nThank you! Thank you, for providing me with a piece of equipment that makes me healthier. And, thank you for being an organization that helps people challenged by this disability.\n\nSincerely, Michael Chasse\n\nBoard of Travis Roy Foundation,\n\nThank you so much for the grant for my bathroom. We moved in a few weeks ago. What a treat to have this wonderful bathroom that I can use. You have helped me so much and given me even more independence. I‚Äôll never be able to thank you enough. But again thank you for helping me and other people in my position.\n\nSincerely,\n\nChristopher Chaput\n\nOH MY GOSH!!!!! I cannot tell you how happy you just made our family!!\n\nWhat a blessing! I am ecstatic!!\n\nTHANK YOU ‚Ä¶.. THANK YOU‚Ä¶.. THANK YOU!!!\n\nGod bless you all!\n\nThank you so much,\n\nKristy Adcock\n\nI just wanted to say ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù! We are so grateful that you and your staff chose us for this grant. When we started this project, we did it on a wing and a prayer! We hope the enclosed pictures do the job justice. Thanks again, to each of you who helped my dream come true!\n\nSincerely,\n\nMalcolm, Dione, & Roy Broadwater and Debbie Bettner\n\nI greatly appreciate your response, in helping me acquire my Truck Lift. It takes people that care to make things happen! Ones that can see past the chair and sees a person with a need and purpose. Having the independence will truly enhance my life. With a helping hand you made my life‚Äôs journey possible. I could not have done it without you and for that I Thank You!\n\nThank You and God Bless,\n\nDon Porter\n\nOn behalf of my brother George King (Geo) and his family, we wish to sincerely thank you for the Travis Roy Foundation grant. It really means a lot to our family and George at such a difficult time. We feel honored; and plan someday to help others like Travis and the Foundation have helped George.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeo King & Family\n\nRecently my son was given one of your grants for a ceiling lift. We just wanted to say how much we appreciate the gift. It has made life a whole lot easier for myself and Kevin, my son, he has been able to sit on the couch with the family and is able to get out of the wheelchair for a little while and feel like a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person. Again THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\n\nTara Taglianetti-Chambers\n\nDear Travis Roy Foundation-\n\nThank you so very much for the grant that my husband and I received! We were so surprised to be awarded that money! The pocket door that was installed has made all the difference for my husband to be able to get in and out of the bathroom with ease in his wheelchair. We are so thankful that there are foundations around like yours that help individuals who really need it. We can‚Äôt thank you enough!\n\nLots of love,\n\nRyan and Maggie Stevenson\n\nWe would like to take the time to thank you once again for the great donation to my daughter. She loves the computer and wheelchair ramp. It has made all our lives much better. Thanks once again to the great people you are.\n\nMark Culpepper / father\n\nThank you so much for granting me the funds for the truck lift that I requested. This is a huge deal to me; I would never have afforded this without your help. My family and I want to thank you from the bottom of our hearts. This will improve life tremendously for my wife, son, and I. Thank You.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEric, Teresa, and Shawn Williamson\n\nHello There!\n\nI just wanted to send a Ginormous THANK YOU to all of you at the Travis Roy Foundation. The $7000 grant you awarded us to have a Tas Lift seat installed in our truck has been a HUGE blessing for our whole family immediately. It‚Äôs so nice to be able to get out and about without having to coordinate with any friends/family/neighbors who are hopefully available to help my wife get me in and out of the truck! Last night my wife & I were actually able to go out on a ‚Äòdate night‚Äô to the movies ‚Äúon our own‚Äù and had a WONDERFUL time. It‚Äôs impossible to explain how much this meant to us. Our three daughters are excited too because Daddy will never miss another school play or dance recital again. So once again, THANK YOU THANK YOU & THANK YOU!!! üôÇ\n\nMark Hall\n\nDear Travis Roy Foundation:\n\nCory and I would like to thank the Travis Roy Foundation for its generous gift to enable us to have the floors on the main level of our home modified. The floors are beautiful and Corey has no trouble getting around on the main floor now. Words cannot express our gratitude for this grant money. Please extend our thanks to the other members of this foundation. Without foundations such as the Travis Roy Foundation, people in Cory‚Äôs situation would not have the opportunities to make such necessary changes or improve quality of life and independent mobility.\n\nGod Bless you all and thank you with all our heart.\n\nSincerely,\n\nTina & Cory Ferguson\n\nDear Board Members:\n\nPlease find enclosed a picture of my beautiful new computer as well as myself! I just wanted to let you all know how wonderful it is to run my small business with these. With such high functioning equipment my life has greatly changed. Not having to worry if I can receive a fax where of my computer will crash again, is priceless.\n\nLiving life with a severe disability is truly hard‚Ä¶ but please know that you have given something to me that makes it A LOT better! I will never take it for granted nor will I forget what you‚Äôve done for me.\n\nThank you.\n\nMarci Boone\n\nTo the Board Members of the Travis Roy Foundation:\n\nI want to thank you very much for accepting/choosing me to receive a Koran from the foundation. My bathroom looks great and works great for me and my home health aides. It is hard to put into words how grateful I am. Please let Travis know what a wonderful foundation he has.\n\nThanks again! God Bless you all!"
