        "text": "If you want to join the JLLC as a community member, you must fill out the JLLC portion of the IU housing application and pay your housing fee. Look for the JLLC in the housing application under “Living Learning Centers & Learning Community Preferences.\"\n\nIU opens housing applications on February 1. The JLLC priority deadline for submission is May 1 May 15. You can continue to apply and your applications considered until June 1. After June 1, you risk not being considered for the JLLC community.\n\nGet started on your IU housing application.\n\nYou should complete your IU housing application and pay your housing fee as soon as possible once the application opens February 1. The JLLC priority deadline for submission is May 1 May 15, and you are strongly encouraged to apply before May 1 May 15. However, you can continue to apply until June 1.\n\nPlease familiarize yourself with the IU housing priority group timelines. Students who complete their IU housing application late (including late fee payment) aren't likely to get their first choice of housing. Get started as soon as possible!\n\nThe JLLC team reviews each application throughout the spring semester. If you complete your JLLC application before the deadline, you will receive an Advanced Review communication to verify your application has been received and is under consideration. This does not mean that you’ve been selected to live at the JLLC.\n\nDecisions for the JLLC are released on May 24 June 3.\n\nIf you have already submitted your housing application and have decided that you would like to apply for the JLLC, simply log back into your housing application and update your preferences to include the “Jellison Living Learning Center.”\n\nJLLC community members must participate in a business-centered events focused on personal, academic, and professional development. Community members must also enroll in a 1 credit hour course during the fall and spring semesters:\n\nBUS-X 180 JLLC Community Development (fall)\n\nBUS-X 190 Hot Topics in Business (spring)\n\nA $200 fee ($100 per semester) is required for all members of the JLLC. This fee covers some of our events and programs, which support your personal, academic, and professional development.\n\nThe JLLC cannot consider applicants that have not completed the IU Intent to Enroll (due May 15 June 1). We encourage you to complete your IU housing application and apply to the JLLC at your earliest opportunity.\n\nReminder: In addition to fully completing your IU housing application, your application is only complete when you pay the $200 nonrefundable application fee. The IU Intent to Enroll also requires a $100 enrollment deposit. Both your IU housing application and IU Intent to Enroll are considered incomplete without payment of these fees. Students who received an application fee waiver will not be prompted to submit these payments.\n\nWe encourage you to give thoughtful consideration to each question before organizing and forming your response (150–200 words per question). All essay responses must be submitted via the IU housing application.\n\n1. The JLLC is a place where students have the talent to succeed, the humility to grow, and the tenacity to persevere. Please describe a single moment in which your talent, humility, or tenacity led to an unexpected learning moment in your life.\n\n2. Describe an issue you are passionate about, and explain why you are passionate about it.\n\n3. Identify a person you admire and explain what you have learned from this person’s life. Please do not select someone to whom you are related.\n\n4. (Optional) What else would you like us to know about you? With your answer, please help us identify you as one of the best potential contributors in our community.\n\nThe JLLC is located in McNutt Residence Center in the Northwest neighborhood of residence halls on the IU campus.\n\nThe best way to reach the JLLC staff is via email at ksbllc@indiana.edu. If you have an immediate question, please call us at 812-855-0791.
