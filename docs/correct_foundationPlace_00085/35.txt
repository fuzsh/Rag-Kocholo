The Galveston

Orphan’s Home

Like many busy seaports, Galveston attracted a substantial immigrant population in the late 1800s. For many, traditional family support was an ocean away, meaning unexpected accidents or epidemics led to shattered families. In 1879, the local business community came together to establish the Island City Protestant and Israelitish Orphans Asylum. The orphanage later dropped its religious affiliation and was renamed the Galveston Orphans Home.
