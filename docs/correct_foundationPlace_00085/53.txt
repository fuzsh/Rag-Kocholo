The freshman had the best shot put mark of the field by just under five feet on Wednesday. Lundgren followed that with a second-place finish in the high jump (6-2.25/1.89m) and a fourth-place finish in the 400 meters (50.82). Other results for the Cheyenne, Wyo., native included a ninth-place finish in the 100 meters (11.85) and an 11th-place finish in the long jump (20-1.5/6.13m).

The shot put was also a highlight for Gabby Smith, whose fifth-place finish and throw of 37-2.5 (11.34m) highlighted a 2,556-point day one. Along with that mark, the junior's other performances included a time of 26.62 (W: 2.1) in the 200 meters, a time of 17.31 in the 100-meter hurdles and a mark of 4-11.5 (1.51m) in the high jump.

IN THEIR WORDS

Colorado State head assistant coach Ryan Baily

On performances in the heptathlon and decathlon on Wednesday:

"Everyone's competing well right now. Talia (Marquez) did well and competed throughout. Eric (Lundgren) got off to a little bit of a rough start in the first couple of events but really picked it up over the last three today. He really brought it at the end and had a huge PR in the 400. I think they'll have good days tomorrow, and hopefully with the things we've worked on since our season opener, we can do some special things tomorrow. I'm excited to see how they do."
