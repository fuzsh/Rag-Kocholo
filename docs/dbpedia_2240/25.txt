Jerry Lee Roberts, age 74, of Ontario, passed away early Monday morning, March 25, 2024, at his home.

He was born April 5, 1949, in Logan County, West Virginia, to the late Ethel (Grimmett) and Corby L. Roberts. Growing up in a large family of 12 children, he learned the value of hard work and determination. Jerry kept his feelings quiet but he loved deeply. He was so proud of his boys and adored his family. Jerry enjoyed playing golf, mowing the yard and washing and waxing his vehicle to a pristine shine. He found not just warmth, but peace, in being outside in the sun.

Left to cherish his memory are his wife, Sheryl Anton Roberts, whom he married on November 13, 1976; two sons, Ryan (Jennifer) Roberts of California and Christopher Roberts of Florida; two precious granddaughters, Isabelle and Sahara; five brothers, Larry (Patty) Roberts, Donnie (Lynn) Roberts, James (Jean) Roberts, Ronnie (Kaye) Roberts and Roy Roberts; three sisters, Janice (Norville) Blankenship, Cindy (Billy) Caudill and Lindy (Joey) Caudill; a brother-in-law, Gregg (Lisa) Anton; two sisters-in-law, Connie (David) DeVault and Lori (Rick) Ackerman; and many nieces, nephews and friends.

In addition to his parents, he was preceded in death by two brothers, Pete and David (Fay) Roberts; and a sister, Betty (James) Grimmett.

There will be no visitation or services at this time. Wappner Funeral Directors-Ontario is honored to serve the family.
