        "text": "Memorial services for Jerry Ray Roberts, 83, of Archibald, LA will be held at a later date at Cedar Baptist Church under the direction of Brown-Holley Funeral Home, Rayville, LA.\n\nMr. Jerry was born June 4, 1936 in Archibald and passed away Thursday, March 26, 2020 in Monroe, LA. He is preceded in death by his parents, Doss and Myrtis Miller Roberts; and six half sisters and four half brothers.\n\nSurvivors include his wife of 60 years, Thelma Free Roberts of Archibald, LA; brother-in-law, James Free of Bastrop, LA; sisters-in-law, Dorothy Stakes of Crowley, LA and Alice Gildersleeve of Leesburg, VA; and a host of nieces, nephews, and cousins.\n\nJerry was a former member of the Archibald Water Board, Oder of the Eastern Star Mangham Chapter #152, and committee member for the Archibald Beautification Program, also he was a member of DMA Senior Citizen’s Group. He is a member of the W. M. Baker Masonic Lodge #388 in Mangham, LA.\n\nJerry had a great love and concern for people, and one of the ways he expressed this concern was by visiting the nursing homes and hospitals and also he visited the sick and shut-in’s at their homes. He always received as big a blessing from visiting the people as they received from his visit.\n\nFor fifty years Jerry was a brick layer, and taught others the trade. He always took great pride in his work because he wanted it to look good. After retiring from laying bricks he became a custodian for the Mangham Elementary School. He enjoyed this job very much, because he got to visit with people. He was recognized for his good job by being chosen Outstanding School Support Employee for a year, and was recognized by the State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (BESE) in Baton Rouge, LA.\n\nMost recently Jerry was honored by Cedar Baptist Church for his good and faithful service to the church and community. Jerry will be greatly missed by all that knew and loved him."
