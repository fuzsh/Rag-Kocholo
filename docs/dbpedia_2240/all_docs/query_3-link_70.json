        "text": "It’s not transmitted through the air like the flu.\n\nAccording to public health authorities, the only way a person can get Ebola is by coming into direct contact with the body fluids (urine, saliva, sweat, feces, vomit, breast milk and semen) of someone who is already showing symptoms.\n\nIf the person does not have symptoms, they are not contagious.\n\nAn Ebola Update from Dr. Anthony Fauci\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, infectious disease chief at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), explains how Ebola spreads and what we’re doing to address it in the U.S. and in West Africa.\n\nFAQs\n\nIn response to frequently asked questions about Ebola, here's what our public health officials are saying.\n\nQ: What is Ebola, and what are the symptoms?\n\nA: Ebola virus is the cause of a Ebola virus disease. Symptoms include:\n\nFever\n\nHeadache\n\nJoint and muscle aches\n\nWeakness\n\nDiarrhea\n\nVomiting\n\nStomach pain\n\nLack of appetite\n\nAbnormal bleeding\n\nSymptoms may appear anywhere from 2 to 21 days after exposure to Ebola virus though 8-10 days is most common.\n\nQ: How is Ebola transmitted?\n\nA: Ebola is transmitted through direct contact with the blood or body fluids (urine, saliva, sweat, feces, vomit, breast milk, and semen) of an infected symptomatic person or though exposure to objects (such as needles) that have been contaminated with infected secretions.\n\nQ: Can I get Ebola from a person who is infected but doesn’t have any symptoms?\n\nA: No. Individuals who are not symptomatic are not contagious. In order for the virus to be transmitted, an individual would have to have direct contact with an individual who is experiencing symptoms or has died of the disease.\n\nVisit the CDC website for more information on Ebola.\n\nIn March 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported an outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the West African country of Guinea. Additional cases have since been reported in the countries of Liberia and Sierra Leone, as well as Nigeria and Senegal. To date, there have been more than 22,500 reported Ebola cases in West Africa, with more than 8,900 deaths. At home, U.S. medical teams have treated 12 Ebola patients — all but two recovered.\n\nSince the start of the outbreak, the United States has sent more than 3,000 DOD, CDC, USAID, and other U.S. health officials to Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea to assist with response efforts, as part of a 10,000-person U.S.-backed civilian response. With their help, the U.S. government has:\n\nConstructed 15 Ebola treatment units in the region\n\nProvided more than 400 metric tons of personal protective equipment and other medical and relief supplies\n\nOperated more than 190 burial teams in the region\n\nConducted aggressive contact tracing to identify chains of transmission\n\nTrained health care workers and conducted community outreach\n\nWorked with international partners to identify travelers who may have Ebola before they leave the region\n\nThanks to their efforts, and the work of countless others from around the world, the number of people who are contracting Ebola has declined sharply from peak levels.\n\nThe decline in cases is encouraging, but just one case can lead to flare-ups of the disease that could prolong the outbreak in West Africa and endanger Americans on our shores. As we move into the next phase of our government-wide and worldwide response to Ebola, the U.S. will continue to focus on protecting against cases at home and getting to zero cases in West Africa.\n\nSince early October, CDC and Department of Homeland Security personnel have conducted entry screening to detect signs of Ebola or potential exposure among all passengers arriving in the U.S. at the following airports, which now receive nearly all travelers coming in from countries affected by the outbreak:\n\nJohn F. Kennedy International Airport - New York, NY\n\nWashington Dulles International Airport - Washington, D.C.\n\nNewark Liberty International Airport - Newark, NJ\n\nChicago O'Hare International Airport - Chicago, IL\n\nHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport - Atlanta, GA\n\nA total of 7,700 adults and children have been screened. Each traveler has his or her contact information forwarded to state and local public health authorities, and is subjected to 21 days of compulsory monitoring to ensure any signs of Ebola are detected early. If an individual displays symptoms, they are isolated, rapidly diagnosed, and treated.\n\nIf there is a need to treat an Ebola patient in the U.S., the CDC and HHS have led efforts to ensure that our health system is prepared to spot, diagnose, transport, and treat the patient effectively without infecting others. Prior to October 2014, there were only three facilities that were officially able to contain and treat Ebola: Emory University Hospital, University of Nebraska Medical Center, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center. Now, we have a network of 51 Ebola treatment centers in 16 states and D.C., with 72 available beds.\n\nOn top of expanding the network of hospitals that can assess, respond, and treat patients, the U.S. government is enhancing our domestic preparedness in these key ways:\n\nIncreasing the number of Ebola testing labs throughout the U.S. that can quickly and safely screen a potential Ebola specimen\n\nEducating more than 150,000 health care workers on how to identify, isolate, diagnose, and care for patients under investigation for Ebola\n\nDeveloping countermeasures — including the first Ebola vaccine to progress to Phase 2 testing — to prevent and treat Ebola\n\nConverting at least 10 of the Ebola Treatment Centers into long-term Regional Ebola and Pandemic Treatment Centers for long-term readiness for years to come\n\nHelping state and local public health systems accelerate and improve their operational readiness and preparedness for Ebola or other infectious diseases\n\nRead here for more details on our continued domestic preparedness efforts.\n\nThe U.S. strategy to combat the Ebola outbreak abroad consists of four key goals:\n\nControlling the epidemic at its source in West Africa\n\nMinimizing the secondary impacts of the epidemic that aren't directly caused by the disease\n\nLeading a coordinated international response\n\nBuilding a robust global health security infrastructure so we're prepared over the long run to confront epidemics such as the Ebola epidemic\n\nThe United States has already committed more than $921 million toward fighting Ebola in West Africa and convened a special U.N. Security Council on the epidemic. We will continue to pursue an adaptable strategy that meets the evolving conditions on the ground until there are zero cases of Ebola in the region. With the significant progress we’re making toward that goal, the U.S. is planning for the return of the majority of the troops deployed in Operation United Assistance by April 30, though more than half of our troops are already back in the U.S. About 100 military personnel, working with regional military partners, will remain to support our response efforts.\n\nAs we welcome our troops home, we will increase the strength of our civilian response. With more than 10,000 civilians engaged in this effort with U.S. support, we will contain the virus, launch recovery efforts to strengthen health systems, prepare for future infectious disease outbreaks, and build stronger global health security. This fight is far from over, but our sustained engagement in the region will help bring an end to the epidemic -- and will help health workers reopen their doors to treat for malaria, immunize more children, and keep pregnant mothers healthy.\n\nRead here for more details on the next phase of our international response to Ebola.\n\nLooking for ways to help fight the global spread of Ebola? Regular Americans across the country are helping in a variety of ways right now.
