        "text": "History\n\nMercer University was founded in 1833 in Penfield by Georgia Baptists. The school, under the leadership of Baptist minister and spiritual father Adiel Sherwood, was named for Jesse Mercer, a prominent Baptist leader and the first chair of the Mercer Board of Trustees.\n\nJosiah Penfield gave the $2,500 that prompted the Georgia Baptist Convention to begin plans to open a school. Many Georgia Baptists gave matching funds for Penfield’s gift. The school opened under principal Billington Sanders.\n\nInitially a malepreparatory school named “Mercer Institute,” the school at its founding consisted of a red clay farm and two hewed log cabins, valued at approximately $1,935. Enrollment for the first term was 39 students.When the school opened, there were considerably fewer and others came over the first few weeks. Tuition was $35 for the year. Board was provided at $8 per month, and each student was required to supply his own bedding, candles and furniture.\n\nFrom its humble beginnings in Penfield, Mercer today is a dynamic and comprehensive center of undergraduate, graduate and professional education. The University has more than 9,000 students; 12 schools and colleges – liberal arts and sciences, law, pharmacy, medicine, health professions, business, engineering, education, theology, music, nursing and professional advancement; campuses in Macon, Atlanta, Savannah and Columbus; two regional academic centers in the state; a university press; five teaching hospitals; an educational partnership with Warner Robins Air Logistics Complex; an engineering research center in Warner Robins; a performing arts center in Macon; and a NCAA Division I athletic program.\n\nThe institution’s reputation for exceptional academics in an engaged learning environment continues to grow. In 2018 the University was reclassified as a doctoral university with high research activity (R2) and is ranked in the top tier of national universities by U.S. News & World Report. Mercer has also earned a Community Engagement classification by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and is one of only 286 institutions in the country to shelter a chapter of The Phi Beta Kappa Society.\n\n1833\n\nMercer Institute, the forerunner of Mercer University, is founded by Georgia Baptists in Penfield as a manual labor school for boys.\n\n1838\n\nMercer’s first Board of Trustees is elected and Mercer Institute becomes known as Mercer University.\n\n1839\n\nFirst college classes begin.\n\nFemale Seminary is approved by the Mercer Board of Trustees.\n\n1841\n\nFirst college class is graduated.\n\n1843\n\nPrincipal college building at Penfield is destroyed by fire.\n\nEarly 1860s\n\nMercer is one of the few colleges in the South and the only one in Georgia to remain open during the War Between the States.\n\n1870\n\nDuring the April 1870 Georgia Baptist Convention (GBC) meeting, the decision is made to move Mercer away from Penfield.

Obear and the City Council that Macon has been chosen and “that the proposition on their part to pay you the sum of $125,000…in bonds of the city of Macon, and a site to cost not over $25,000 … was accepted.” On Oct. 28, President H.H. Tucker reports that a six-acre site, adjoining Tattnall Square, has been selected.
