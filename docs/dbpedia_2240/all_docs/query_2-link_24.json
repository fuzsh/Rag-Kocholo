        "text": "ROCHESTER, N.Y. – Roberts Wesleyan University pole vault standout Brynn King will receive the Jerry Flynn College Female Athlete Award given by the Rochester Press-Radio Club.\n\nKing and 13 other local sports figures will be honored on June 11 at the Press-Radio Club's Celebration of Champions prior to the Rochester Red Wings game against the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Rail Riders at Innovative Field.\n\n\"Brynn has enjoyed unprecedented success since arriving at Roberts Wesleyan University and we are grateful to the Rochester Press-Radio Club for recognizing her outstanding accomplishments as a student-athlete,\" Roberts Wesleyan University Executive Director of Athletics Bob Segave said. \"Her commitment to excellence in the pole vault and in the classroom is inspiring. She is humble, coachable and an outstanding teammate. We look forward to watching her continue to soar as a Redhawk and beyond.\"\n\nKing, a native of The Woodlands, Texas, has made history throughout her first year on the Roberts campus. She broke the NCAA Division II women's indoor pole vault record in her first meet as a Redhawk on Dec. 1 and capped the indoor season by becoming Roberts' first NCAA Division II champion with another record-setting performance (4.65 meters, 15-feet, 3-inches) on March 8 in Pittsburg, Kan.\n\nA transfer from Duke University, King had the best pole vault by any woman at any level of NCAA competition during the indoor season. A first-team All-America selection, she set the NCAA Division II record eight times and was named the 2024 East Coast Conference Indoor Track and Field Women's Athlete of the Year, the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association Division II East Region Women's Field Athlete of the Year and the Division II National Indoor Field Athlete of the Year by the USTFCCCA. She owns nine of the Top 10 jumps in NCAA Division II indoor pole vault history.\n\nKing is also off to a fast start in the outdoor season. She has broken the NCAA Division II record twice and set the current mark (4.68 meters, 15-4 ¼), a meet and personal record, while winning the Texas Relays on March 30. She also broke a 13-year-old meet record at the Kansas Relays on April 19.\n\nKing is the sixth Roberts athlete to be honored by the Press-Radio Club. She joins Joe Rebisz (2001, men's basketball), her pole vault coach Jenn (Stuczynski) Suhr (2004, women's basketball/track and field) and Judy Wright (2005, women's basketball) as winners of the Local Amateur Athlete of the Year Award. Marissa Sell (women's soccer, basketball and lacrosse) was named Local Athlete of the Year in 2014 and Lindsey Brinkel (women's lacrosse) won the Jerry Flynn College Female Athlete Award in 2022.\n\nFor ticket information visit www.pressradio.org and click on the Celebration of Champions link.\n\nPlayers Mentioned"
