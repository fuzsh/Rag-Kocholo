        "text": "On This Day - 25th March\n\n1199 King Richard I was wounded by a crossbow bolt while fighting in France, leading to his death on 6th April. Richard spent very little time in England and lived in his Duchy of Aquitaine in the southwest of France, preferring to use his kingdom as a source of revenue to support his armies. He produced no legitimate heirs and acknowledged only one illegitimate son, Philip of Cognac. As a result, he was succeeded by his brother John as King of England.\n\n1609 English navigator Henry Hudson (Hudson Bay in Canada was named after him) set off on his third voyage in an attempt to find the north west passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean.\n\n1736 The death of Nicholas Hawksmoor, British architect. Sir Christopher Wren heard of Hawksmoor's 'early skill and genius' for architecture and took him as his clerk, aged 18. Hawksmoor worked with Wren on projects including Chelsea Hospital, St. Paul's Cathedral, Hampton Court Palace and Greenwich Hospital.\n\n1807 The Slave Trade Act received the royal assent, eventually bringing an end to the slave trade. British merchants transported nearly three million black Africans across the Atlantic between 1700 and the early 19th century. The 1833 Slavery Abolition Act outlawed slavery itself throughout the British Empire but slaves did not gain their final freedom until 1838.\n\n1876 The first football international between Wales and Scotland took place in Glasgow. Scotland won 4 0.\n\n1897 The birth of the actor John Laurie. He went to school at Dumfries Acadaemy (see picture) and performed a wide range of film and theatre work (particularly in Shakespearean roles). In spite of his acting versatility he is probably best remembered for playing the part of Private Frazer in the TV sitcom Dad's Army (1968â1977).\n\n1940 The United States agreed to give Britain and France access to all American warplanes for the war effort.\n\n1949 The film Hamlet, starring Laurence Olivier, won five Oscars. It was the first British film to win an academy award.\n\n1957 Six European nations signed the Treaty of Rome thus establishing the Common Market. They were Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Holland and Luxembourg.\n\n1969 John Lennon and new wife Yoko Ono staged their ‘Beds in Peace’ at the Amsterdam Hilton. It lasted until 31st March and each day they invited the world's press into their hotel room, between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. It was Yoko’s idea to get over their peace message while on honeymoon. Although the press were expecting them to be having sex, the couple were sitting in bed, in John's words 'like angels', talking about peace, with signs over their bed reading 'Hair Peace' and 'Bed Peace'.\n\n1975 The National Front marched through London protesting against integration with Europe.\n\n1980 Robert Runcie was enthroned as the 102nd Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\n1989 For the first time, both the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race crews entered the event with women coxes. The race was won by Oxford.\n\n1999 The 13 year old singer Charlotte Church became the youngest artist to enter the American top 30 album chart.\n\n2002 The death of Kenneth Wolstenholme, football commentator for BBC television in the 1950s and 1960s. He is perhaps most noted for his commentary during the 1966 FIFA World Cup which included the famous phrase 'Some people are on the pitch...they think it's all over....it is now!', as Geoff Hurst scored England's fourth goal.\n\n2014 The death, aged 93, of Captain Raymond \"Jerry\" Roberts, the last surviving member of the small Bletchley Park team of cryptographers who broke the Nazis’ top-secret Lorenz code. Historians believe that the Bletchley Park codebreakers may have saved hundreds of thousands of lives, shortened the Second World War by between two and four years and that the outcome of the war itself would have been uncertain without the codebreakers' work."
