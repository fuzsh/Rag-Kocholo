        "text": "NEWS & EVENTS\n\nFayette County Celebrates Multi-Use Path, Roundabout Completion\n\nFayette County, GA – Fayette County celebrated the construction of a 1.5-mile new multi-use path along Redwine Road and a new roundabout and associated multi-use paths and crosswalks at the intersection of Redwine Road, Bernhard Road, and Peachtree Parkway. The ribbon cutting took place on August 22 at 4:15 p.m. The projects were jointly funded by the federal aid program through the Atlanta Regional Commission and local match, most significantly the 2017 Transportation SPLOST program.\n\nMarshal’s Office, Cub Scout Pack 70 hold Boating and Fishing Safety Event\n\nFayette County, GA – The Fayette County Marshal’s Office and Cub Scout Pack 70 from Evergreen Church sponsored an Introduction to Boating and Fishing Safety event at Lake Horton on August 18, 2024. Deputy Marshal Brian Hitchcock, Deputy Marshal David Colley, and Sargent Bryan Clanton attended the event to answer questions about the Marshal’s Office's use of boats to patrol the waterways of Fayette County and to educate the Cub Scouts on boating safety issues frequently encountered by the Marshals. The Marshals explained some of their law enforcement duties such as the enforcement of hunting and fishing laws. The Cub Scouts also learned basic fishing skills from their Cub Scout leaders and the Marshals. Though the event was cut short due to a sudden Severe Weather Warning, the Cub Scouts were able to enjoy a short amount of time fishing along the shores of Lake Horton. For information on Marshal's Office educational events for youth, email them at marshaloffice@fayettecountyga.gov or call 770-320-6070.\n\nFayette County Unveils Redwine Road Roundabout\n\nFayette County, Georgia – August 12, 2024 – Construction of the roundabout and associated multi-use paths and crosswalks at the intersection of Redwine Road, Bernhard Road, and Peachtree Parkway is complete. The project was fully funded with local 2017 SPLOST dollars.\n\nThe purpose of the project was to improve the operational efficiency of the former all-way stop, which often experienced failing “level-of-service” during AM and PM peak hours and during school traffic. Other project goals were to improve safety and optimize the interaction of pedestrians and golf cart users with vehicles in and around the intersection. The roundabout is expected to significantly reduce delay, as well as the frequency and severity of crashes. For pedestrians and golf carts, illuminated crosswalks were installed on each leg of the intersection. The crosswalks are provided with refuge areas so users can cross one lane of traffic at a time and were set away from the roundabout to reduce the number of decisions and potential conflict points a driver experience while navigating the intersection.\n\nThe project was designed by Croy Engineering and constructed by McLeroy, Inc. Design and construction challenges included the integration of path users with vehicles, a large number of utilities in the work zone, “existing” conditions topography that required the use of a modular block retaining wall, and trying to minimize impacts to the traveling public and private properties.\n\n“Construction of this project was difficult as we balanced the conflicting goals of minimizing traffic impacts while still controlling project schedule and cost. Courtney Hassenzahl, Assistant Director of the Environmental Management Department said. “I’m proud of the way it turned out. I personally use the intersection often and see an improvement with nearly continuous traffic flow and safer crossings for students to going to or from school.” She said.\n\nCitizens are encouraged to visit the County’s webpage for the latest updates on all 2017 SPLOST projects: https://www.fayettecountyga.gov/splost-2017/. Contact Fayette County at 770-320-6010 or SPLOST@fayettecountyga.gov for more information.\n\nRedwine Road Multi-Use Path Officially Opens\n\nFayette County, Georgia – August 12, 2024 – Fayette County is pleased to announce that the construction of 1.5 miles of new multi-use path along Redwine Road is complete. The project was jointly funded with federal aid programed through the Atlanta Regional Commission and local match, most significantly the 2017 Transportation SPLOST program.\n\nThis was the 5th path project along Redwine Road and furthered the long-term goal of providing a safe and comprehensive path network for multiple communities in the area. The project expanded the connection to Starr’s Mill School Complex by installing 4,300 feet of path between Birkdale Drive and Newhaven Drive and 3,600 feet of path between Preserve Place and Foreston Place. In addition to the path, the project also provided drainage improvements and a pedestrian hybrid beacon for at-grade crossings of Redwine Road near the Birkdale Drive and Quarters Road intersection.\n\nAlthough completion of this project is a major step in connecting homes to the school complex, users will notice a large gap in the path south of Robinson Road. This is to accommodate the installation of a tunnel under Redwine Road. The tunnel project will complete the gap along the east side of Redwine Road and construct an additional 800 ft of path along Robinson Road from the tunnel to Holly Grove Road. Construction for the tunnel and additional paths will start in the next few months.\n\n“The delivery of this project is the result of over a decade’s worth of planning, funding requests, design challenges, procurement issues, land acquisition, utility relocations, and construction. I’m thankful to all the people who have supported the project, including the Atlanta Regional Commission, the Georgia Department of Transportation, the project engineer (Heath & Lineback Engineers), the contractor (Helix Group, Inc.), county staff, the Board of Commissioners, and especially the public. They have been very patient and cooperative over the life of the project,” Phil Mallon, County Engineer, said.\n\nCitizens are encouraged to visit the County’s webpage for the latest updates on all 2017 SPLOST projects: https://www.fayettecountyga.gov/splost-2017/.

High demand conditions exist when there are ten or more consecutive days of 90-degree temperatures and no measurable precipitation. Over-irrigating contributes to depletion of our water resources. “We are asking all customers to voluntarily limit irrigation activities to three days a week,” said Vanessa Tigert, Water System Director. As responsible stewards of our water resources, we all have a role to play in ensuring the sustainability of our water supply.\n\nWhy Efficient Irrigating Matters\n\nDuring periods of high demand, such as during hot weather or droughts, water supplies can become strained. Excessive water use during peak times can overwhelm the water distribution system, leading to problems like decreased water pressure. By limiting water use, we can help ensure that there is enough water available for essential needs, such as drinking, sanitation, and emergency services. With limited precipitation, it is crucial that we all contribute to conserving water to help maintain our supply for essential demand.\n\nHow You Can Help\n\nCustomers with odd-numbered addresses are asked to water on odd-numbered days, while those with even-numbered addresses are asked to water on even-numbered days. Fayette County encourages all our customers to join us in these conservation efforts. By making small changes in our daily routines, we can collectively make a significant impact.\n\nThis Georgia Water Stewardship Act allows daily outdoor watering for purposes of planting, growing, managing, or maintaining ground cover, trees, shrubs, or other plants only between the hours of 4 p.m. and 10 a.m.\n\nFor more information on water conservation tips and resources, please visit https://epd.georgia.gov/watershed-protection-branch/water-conservation.\n\nFayette County Safety Action Plan Underway\n\nPublic Meeting Scheduled on Tuesday, August 27\n\nJuly 30, 2024 - Fayette County secured a Safe Streets and Roads for All (SS4A) grant to develop a Safety Action Plan following the recent announcement of the program by the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT).

The Fayette County Building Safety Department has issued a warning regarding the risks associated with engaging unlicensed individuals to perform construction work, emphasizing the importance of obtaining the necessary permits and complying with building codes and regulations.\n\nOne of the primary concerns highlighted by the Building Safety Department is the potential financial penalties for failing to obtain permits. Homeowners need to understand that these penalties can be substantial, and retroactively obtaining permits could result in doubling the costs. This emphasizes the significance of thorough planning and responsibility in construction projects.\n\nWhile minor, aesthetic alterations such as replacing doors and windows, applying wallpaper, and changing carpets or fixtures may not require a permit, structural or electrical modifications, such as in-ground pools, patio covers, garage conversions, water heaters, and HVAC replacements, necessitate mandatory building permits.\n\nThe department wants to raise awareness about the possibility of homeowners being misinformed about permit requirements, especially when they opt to conduct the work themselves or engage unlicensed contractors. Individuals lacking licensure undertaking the work may disseminate inaccurate information or attempt to circumvent compliance with safety regulations and adherence to prescribed codes.\n\nA pertinent scenario for homeowners' comprehension revolves around completing work without requisite permits. For instance, imagine an unfinished basement that a homeowner finishes without obtaining the required permit and completing the inspection. Should an electrical fire occur in the finished basement area, the insurance company, during its investigation into the fire's cause, will determine whether the basement work was legitimately permitted. In most cases, lack of proper permitting constitutes substantial evidence for the insurance company to decline compensation for property losses.\n\nLeslie Nieber, the Building Official for the Fayette County Department of Building Safety, has stressed the importance of understanding permit requirements. She advises homeowners to research the specific permit requisites for their projects before starting work. Homeowners are encouraged to seek clarification from their local building department if there's any uncertainty. The department is committed to providing guidance and support, ensuring homeowners feel reassured and supported.\n\nNieber shares valuable advice, emphasizing that seeking clarity on permit requirements is always preferable to proceeding with uncertainty. The Building Safety Department is unwavering in its commitment to assisting homeowners, aiming to ensure project safety and compliance with mandated standards. It is readily available to address any queries or concerns related to permitting, making homeowners feel valued and important.\n\nAdditionally, the recent increase in permits for metal garages and sheds has posed challenges for homeowners. Before finalizing the installation of a metal building or any other structure, verifying the pertinent permitting requirements is imperative. Nieber places great emphasis on refraining from disbursing down payments or half of the building costs until it is determined what is needed for building construction plans, which should include a foundation plan. Vendors often come back, communicating to homeowners that the request by Fayette County will come with an additional cost, which is problematic for Nieber.\n\nThe Fayette County Building Safety Department's warning against unlicensed contractors and the risks associated with undertaking construction work without proper permits serves as a critical reminder for homeowners to prioritize due diligence and compliance. The department urges Fayette County homeowners to adhere to building permit requirements and to be cautious when engaging contractors for construction projects, ensuring that their chosen contractors are licensed and compliant with safety regulations. By doing so, homeowners can protect themselves from potential financial liabilities and ensure the safety and integrity of their construction projects. If you need anything or have any questions, please contact the Department of Building Safety at 770-305-5403.\n\nFayette County Library Summer Reading Challenge a Magic Success\n\nFayette County, Georgia The Fayette County Library concluded its Summer Reading Challenge with a dazzling magic show finale.

She went on to say, “Fayette County is currently experiencing extremely dry soil conditions due to limited precipitation received over the last month. These conditions are reminiscent of the 2019 flash drought the Southern Crescent experienced.”\n\nThe current outdoor water use schedule required under the Georgia Environmental Protection Division Drought Management Rule remains in place. It limits outdoor water use, including irrigation activities, year-round to the hours after 4 p.m. and before10 a.m. and water waste activities such as continuous leaks.\n\nOther ways our customers can conserve water include checking for and repairing leaks on your property, and avoiding activities that require large amounts of water such as car or pressure washing.\n\nWater conservation information is available at https://epd.georgia.gov/watershed-protection-branch/water-conservation .\n\nFAYETTE COUNTY EVALUATED AND IMPLEMENTED 77% OF NEW SHELTER LIST, REPORT SAYS\n\nFayette County, GA - A report by the Fayette County Board of Commissioners shows that 77% of the improvements suggested during recent meetings were evaluated and implemented.

Additionally, State Law allows the use of consumer fireworks on January 1 from 12:00 AM (midnight) to 1:00 AM.\n\n* Outside of those specific days, the use of consumer fireworks is permitted under Georgia Law beginning at 10:00 AM and ending at 11:59 PM on any day unless such use violates the local jurisdiction’s general noise ordinance. That law further stipulates that such ordinance must be a general noise ordinance that does not apply solely to fireworks and must have been adopted on or after July 01, 2018. If you live within the city limits of Peachtree City, Fayetteville, or the Town of Tyrone, please check their official website or contact them directly for additional information.\n\n* Fireworks cannot be used within any park or other County property without a permit, which we offer only as part of a County-partnered special event.\n\n* Fireworks cannot be used within the right-of-way of any public road, street, highway, or railroad.\n\n* Please be respectful and courteous to your neighbors who may not enjoy fireworks, may suffer from PTSD, or may have pets that are frightened by them. Also, remember that not everyone has Independence Day off from work and may be trying to sleep. If you plan to use fireworks, we encourage you to talk with your neighbors ahead of time and try to accommodate their needs.\n\n* If you are someone who does not like fireworks, please remember that Georgia law does allow those over age 18 to use them within the hours noted above. If a neighbor who plans to use fireworks comes to talk with you ahead of time, be respectful of their rights under the law and keep in mind that they are talking with you out of courtesy.\n\nIf you notice fireworks being used outside of the allowed times, please call us while it is happening. We cannot really do anything after the fact. To report possible unlawful use of fireworks, please call the non-emergency line at 770-461-4357, and provide as much detail as possible with respect to your location and where you believe the fireworks are being used.\n\nAbove all, please be safe and treat one another as you would want to be treated.\n\nFAYETTE COUNTY’S PUBLIC WORKS CLUB EARNS NATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT AWARD\n\nFayette County, GA – June 17, 2024 Fayette County’s Public Works Club has been recognized with a 2024 Achievement Award from the National Association of Counties (NACo). The awards honor innovative, effective county government programs that strengthen services for residents.\n\nThe Public Works Club is a partnership between Fayette County Government and the Fayette County School System. The club is designed to teach students about local public works career opportunities.\n\n“This was an introduction to job opportunities in Public Works,” Steve Hoffman, Director of Fayette County’s Road Department said. “Public Works departments that are involved are Road, Environmental Management Department, Fleet, Engineering, and Water System,” he said.\n\nStudents learned about what each department does to serve the county. Bradley Klinger, Assistant Director of the Road Department, said he hopes the students will appreciate the experience.\n\n“We hope high school students will look into Public Works jobs when they complete their schooling as an alternative to retail and service industries. These available jobs can be from local governments such as Fayette County or one of the many private sector companies,” Klinger said. “The students will understand these skills are learnable and do not require a college education,” he said.\n\nSocial Studies Teacher Kenneth James said the club offers in-depth learning about various careers in Public Works.\n\n“The goal of the club is twofold. The first is to provide students with an insight into potential career opportunities that aren't traditionally pushed in high school. The club will give students an opportunity to learn about a variety of topics in Public Works including the operation of large construction equipment and how it relates to video games, underground utilities, GIS (digital mapping) with drone technology, surveying, equipment, and large truck repair, how drinking water is purified and transported from the facility to homes and customer service,” James said.\n\nStudent Esteban Guzman, 18, said the first meeting of the Public Works Club exceeded his expectations.\n\n“I thought it was going to be something basic like going up there and cleaning up the road but it’s way more fun than that: it’s three times better than I expected,” he said.\n\n“I’m proud of the effort Mr. Klinger and others have put in to develop this program and the success it is having as demonstrated by this National Recognition,” ,” Phil Mallon, Public Works Director said. “Fayette County is excited to continue this program into the 2024/25 school year and is looking for ways to increase participation and expand the opportunities presented to students,” he said.\n\nEach year, NACo’s Achievement Awards recognize outstanding programming in 18 categories aligned with the vast, comprehensive services counties provide. The categories include children and youth, criminal justice and public safety, libraries, management, information technology, health, civic engagement and more. Launched in 1970, the program is designed to celebrate innovation in county government. Each nominated program is judged on its own merits and not against other applications.\n\n“The Achievement Awards recognize excellence in county government and effective public service,” said NACo President Mary Jo McGuire. “This year’s winners have delivered results for our residents and demonstrated innovative efforts to strengthen our communities.”\n\nFor more information about the Public Works Club, call 770-320-6010.\n\nNELAMS-KENT WINS GOLD LINE SCHOLARSHIP\n\nJune 14, 204 Fayette County Communications Training Officer Cieara Nelams-Kent was awarded a Gold Line Telecommunicator Continuing Education Scholarship. The scholarship, endowed by NENA (National Emergency Number Association), provides travel, registration and stipend to the NENA Annual Conference and Expo in Orlando, Florida. NENA is a non-profit organization whose vision is to make the public safer by 911 services delivered by highly trained emergency-communications professionals and powered by the latest technologies.\n\n“I hope to network with different people from all over the country. I want to elevate my skills and grow my career as a dispatcher. The conference has classes on different topics and skills that I may not be able to learn while working,” Nelam-Kent said.\n\n“Cieara is one of our most valued trainers. She maintains a high standard for herself while motivating others who are new to the field. I am always impressed by her work product and am thrilled she is being recognized on a national level for her efforts,” Katye Vogt, Fayette County 911 Communications Director said.\n\nBEST PRACTICES FOR FAYETTE COUNTY SWIMMING POOL OWNERS\n\nJune 13, 2024 Fayette County, GA – Swimming pools often become a hot topic as the temperature rises, and you may start exploring ways to beat the heat. Whether you're considering an inground or above-ground pool, it's important to remember that safety requirements should be a crucial part of your planning, not an afterthought. Fayette County is here to guide you through ensuring safety when you plunge into the world of aquatic vessels.\n\nFayette County follows the International Code Council's International Swimming Pool and Spa Code (ISPSC), which is a model code that regulates the minimum requirements for the design, construction, alteration, repair, and maintenance of swimming pools, spas, hot tubs, and aquatic facilities. This includes public swimming pools, public spas, public exercise spas, aquatic recreation facilities, unground storable residential pools, permanent unground residential pools, permanent residential spas, permanent residential exercise spas, portable residential spas, and portable residential exercise spas.\n\nQ: What should I consider when selecting a contractor?\n\nA:Ask if the price will include all the compliance requirements, including ISPAC-approved fence/barrier and window/door alarms. If the pool barrier does not meet the approved plans and window and door alarms are not installed, your pool will not pass the final inspection.\n\nQ: The contractor asked me, as the homeowner, to pull my permit. Is this normal?\n\nA: This would not be recommended for any homeowner as you're assuming full responsibility for the permit and completing all required inspections, and this can be stressful.\n\nQ: Why are permits required?\n\nA: A permit is required to review the location of the aquatic vessel, fence, pool equipment, size, and additional features such as spas or elected add-on features. When the plans examiner with the Department of Building Safety reviews the documents for approval, they look at every detail, including electrical, plumbing, and safety compliance.\n\nQ: How do I know when my pool has been completed?\n\nA: The permit holder, generally the contractor, should give you a Fayette County Certificate of Occupancy, which certifies the aquatic vessel has completed the inspection process.\n\nFayette County Building Safety wants to give you a few safety tips for pool owners:\n\nEnsure the pool barrier is always secure, with gates closed and properly latched to prevent access.\n\nDon’t assume all guests can swim; ask and observe.\n\nAssign an adult always to watch children at all times.\n\nAlways keep a phone within reach as every second counts if 911 services are needed.\n\nEnsure one adult supervising activity around the pool is trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training.\n\nClean and clear pool water is essential for a safe pool. If the bottom of the pool or spa floor can't be seen, the pool should not be considered safe for swimming.\n\nDo not leave toys or float devices around the pool during unsupervised times. These items may entice little ones to want to explore.\n\nFayette County Building Safety is always available to answer any code-related questions, so feel free to contact us at 770-305-5404 or at FayetteCountyGA.gov\n\nFAYETTE COUNTY KICKS OFF SUMMER READING CHALLENGE\n\nFayette County, GA - June 6, 2024Fayette County Public Library hosted its Summer Reading Kick-off Monday, June 3.

The audit, which was part of a statewide mandate, was carried out efficiently and concluded in a single day, well within the state’s allotted timeframe of May 30-31, 2024.\n\nThe Secretary of State’s Office rolls a 10-sided dice to randomly select which batches of ballots will be chosen for the audit. Once the batches of ballots are chosen, county election officials start auditing them to confirm the accuracy of the most recent vote. The contest that was audited for this RLA was the Supreme Court Judge (Pinson) contest.\n\nThe RLA saw the participation of 16 dedicated auditors and included representation from each political party's county representatives, ensuring a transparent and bipartisan process. The event underscored the commitment of Fayette County to maintaining the integrity and accuracy of its electoral process.\n\n“Last week 16 of our neighbors stepped up to help with the statewide mandatory audit of last month's primary election. Along with our election staff, they hand counted the specified ballots to double check their accuracy. The results were exactly as expected. Well done Team Fayette,” Gary Rower, Election Board Chairman said.\n\nThe statewide mandate for the RLA aimed to enhance voter confidence by verifying the accuracy of election outcomes through rigorous and systematic checks using the Secretary of State's processes. Fayette County’s prompt and efficient handling of the audit stands as a testament to the county’s electoral preparedness and organizational excellence.\n\n\"Our election staff were excellent, demonstrating remarkable skill in carrying out our plans and adjusting as needed. This thorough review underscores our unwavering commitment to transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement. Together, we have ensured that our operations set a strong foundation for the future and will meet the highest integrity of the voting processes,\" Brieanna Garrett, Elections and Voter Registration Director said.\n\nNotices of Assessment Mailed June 4, 2024\n\nThe Fayette County Assessors’ Office mailed Notices of Assessment on June 4, 2024. They were mailed somewhat later this year due to conversion to a new software system that will save the County thousands of dollars. We apologize for any inconvenience.\n\nBy State law, the Assessors’ Office is required to value properties at fair market value for tax purposes. If you would like to appeal your assessment, you have until July 19th to do so. There are four bases on which you can appeal: value, uniformity, taxability, and denial of exemption. Most appeals are based on value. Please remember that tax bill amount, though an estimate is shown on the notice, is not a basis for appeal. Your tax bill amount is a mathematical computation using assessed value and millage rate. And because provision of County services requires a set level of funding, a reduction in property value results in an increase in millage rate and/or a shift in tax liability.\n\nThe Assessors’ Office is available to answer any questions related to property valuation. Please feel free to contact us at 770-305-5402. Questions regarding tax bills and exemptions should be directed to the Tax Commissioner’s Office at 770-461-3652.\n\nFire and Emergency Services Smartphone App\n\nFayette County, GA - May 23, 2024 The Fayette County Department of Fire and Emergency Services is excited to announce the release of a new smartphone application.

Gaining this knowledge and experience will help me better serve our employees and the citizens of Fayette County. I appreciate this opportunity and look forward to continuing to take classes to widen my understanding of County government,” she said.\n\n\"Lifelong learning stands as a vital pillar within our association,\" said Executive Director Dave Wills. \"Through collaboration with the Carl Vinson Institute of Government, we offer a diverse array of training and development opportunities, aimed at equipping county officials to navigate the challenges inherent in local government.

Created with input from county commissioners who identified courses based on the issues and decision-making challenges they faced regularly, it is a unique adult education program that provides county officials with a tailor-made learning experience to assist them with governing at the local level. To ensure the course requirements and curriculum remain relevant and engaging, the ACCG Lifelong Learning Committee – which comprises county commissioners and staff from both ACCG and CVIOG – meet regularly to review the curriculum and adjust accordingly. The Lifelong Learning Academy has been successful in equipping county officials with the necessary skills to meet the current needs of their constituents thanks to the collaborative approach undertaken by ACCG and CVIOG.\n\nFayette County Names Garrett New Elections Director\n\nFayette County, GA - Brieanna Garrett is the new Elections Director for Fayette County.

He had called me on my company cell phone and I was able to use my personal cell phone to call 911 at 8:13. I advised the Clayton County 911 operator that I needed to be transferred to Fayette County 911 because my employer visiting from Germany was in his hotel room having a heart attack,” she said.\n\n“I still had Knut on my company cell phone and was talking to him to keep him alert and at 8:18 I heard the paramedics enter the room. They immediately started asking Knut questions and he was still alert to answer,” Singletary said.\n\nWhen the paramedics were taking Zinnacker to the ambulance, he told them he felt like he was going to get sick.\n\n“One of the medics said, ‘we can't do that’ and started to sing, yes, sing an Elvis Presley song in German and it calmed me,” Zinnacker said.\n\nZinnacker was quickly transported to Piedmont Fayette Hospital. A medical team from Piedmont Fayette was waiting on the ambulance. Zinnacker was taken to the Heart Cath Lab and a stent was placed in a right artery from the heart that was 100% blocked and the artery was opened.\n\n“At 9:46 I notified the owner of our company in Germany of Knut's heart attack. I told him that a stent was placed in the artery and Knut was alert and talking. We were waiting to see him,” Singletary said.\n\nZinnacker and Singletary visited Station 4 to thank the First Responders who saved his life.\n\n“You all saved my life on Tuesday last week. I don’t have any cardiology (disease) history, no one in my family does,” Zinnacker said as he began to recount the events of the morning.\n\n“All this emergency chain you are doing here is impressive. You should all be blessed. Thank you very much for what you’ve done,” he said.\n\nLt. Joe Hartley was leading the Fire and EMS team of paramedics who helped Zinnacker. He said seeing Zinnacker again was a happy and rare opportunity.\n\n“It was nice to see Knut in the aftermath of the call and shake his hand. We don’t always get to see a patient come back so it was nice to see him up and walking and healthy. Sometimes patients have to be in rehab for a while. It’s nice to see him make a full recovery this quickly. I’m glad he gets to go back home to Germany,” Hartley said.\n\n“The survival chain in Fayette County has been trained on, practiced with our service partners, and deployed with great success for many years,” said Fire Chief Jeffrey Hill.\n\n“Fayette County Fire & Emergency Services is proud to have such strong relationships with our partners at Fayetteville Fire Department, Piedmont Fayette Hospital Emergency Department, and the Cardiac Cath Lab within the hospital. This system works like a well-oiled machine and the survivability statistics in Fayette County speak for themselves. If any part of this chain breaks, the outcomes are impacted. We are blessed to have the full support of our Board of Commissioners and County Administrator to operate a progressive and stellar level of emergency services in this county, he said.\n\nFAYETTE COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR STEVE RAPSON HONORED AS 2024 ACCG LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT ADVOCATE OF THE YEAR\n\nATLANTA, Ga.

Rapson’s leadership underscores Fayette County’s commitment to investing in the professional development of its county workforce.\n\n“Leadership is easy when you have a group of Department Heads who are at the top of their game.

I’m humbled to be recognized for my part of the senior leadership of what makes Fayette County great,” Rapson said.\n\nWater System Staff Wins Second Place in Statewide Competition\n\nFayette County, Georgia – Fayette County Water System water operators won second place in the Georgia American Water Works Association Top Ops Competition.

Roberts ran the Northside BeltLine 5K event 2 hours before winning her climb.\n\n“Last year was my first time competing and participating in the climb. It was a fun event to do with friends and coworkers that also raised money for a good cause,\" she said.\n\n\"I choose to do it for my personal health and fitness but also for some family members that have died from lung cancer. This year was just as fun as last year. Thank you to the County for the support. I’m looking forward to competing again next year,\" Roberts said.\n\nSarah Baxter won first place female in her age group.\n\n\"I am proud of the continued success of this annual event and the participants from our department who contribute their time and talent to the climb. Respiratory disease and associated cancers are among the leading causes of firefighter deaths throughout their careers and into retirement. The toxins firefighters are exposed to throughout their careers, make them more than twice as likely as the general population to develop such cancers and illnesses. Firefighters and other first responders climb to show support and respect for others with lung disease who are literally fighting for every breath. Congratulations to Capt. Anderson, FAO Roberts, and FF/AEMT Baxter on their awards this year. They participated in this event just as they operate on duty every day, with success in mind,\" Hill said.\n\nANIMAL SHELTER STATEMENT\n\nFayette County, GA – Fayette County heard the community’s concerns and implemented a solution. Staff removed the wall separating adjacent kennels, along with the kennel separating wall to create a L-shaped large kennel. This allows enough space for a medium or large dog to have a bed, water and move around before they are adopted. Additionally, staff removed the kennel separating wall in the smaller kennel to double their living space. This reduces the total number of kennels from 32 to 24, which is still 50% more space than what was in our previous kennel. There is overflow capacity in the isolation room that contains 10 larger kennels used primarily for isolation and observation. The overall kennel can be “right-sized” up or down with by existing staff based upon our capacity needs at the shelter. Our focus will now shift to implementing the additional on-sight improvements for walking trails and a livestock building. Fayette County remains committed to working with the community, animal advocate partners and volunteers to ensure we have a master plan that meets our growing needs in the future.\n\nAbout the Fayette County Animal Shelter: The Fayette County Animal Shelter has been dedicated to serving the community for close to 40 years. Our services include assistance to animals with public safety as the number one priority. To learn more about our services and to get involved with our work, please visit FayetteCountyGa.gov\n\nOAKHILL DRIVE CLOSURE\n\nFayette County, Georgia – April 12, 2024 – Oakhill Drive in the Kenwood Forrest Subdivision has been closed for the replacement of a failed stormwater culvert.

This 2017 Transportation SPLOST/Federal-Aid project expands the existing path system and provides convenient and safe transportation alternatives along Redwine Road. An important component of the project is the installation of a hybrid beacon and pedestrian crossing near the intersection of Redwine Road, Quarters Road, and Birkdale Drive. The crossing and beacon will be the same as those used in Peachtree City for similar at-grade crossings.\n\nThe Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices defines a hybrid beacon as a pedestrian traffic control signal used to warn and control traffic at an unsignalized location to assist pedestrians and golf carts in crossing a street at marked crossings. The Hybrid Beacon traffic control device consists of the signal sections and sequencing shown below.\n\nSimilar to a traditional traffic signal, vehicles approaching the hybrid beacon are required to stop during the steady red cycle. Vehicles may proceed through the crossing during the alternating flashing red cycle after a complete stop and if the crossing is clear of pedestrians, bicyclists, golf carts, etc. The below links provide additional information on using pedestrian hybrid beacons.\n\nIowa Department of Transportation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kum6w2BH1zc\n\nFederal Highway Administration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hObFU7RyA0A&t=1s\n\nFor questions or more information please contact Fayette County Public Works at 770-320-6010 or SPLOST@fayettecountyga.gov.\n\nMarch 12, 2024, Presidential Preference Primary\n\nOfficial and Complete Results\n\nElection Summary Report\n\nRODGERS WINS VFW AWARD\n\nFayette County, GA – Fayette County 911 Communications Officer Nicolette Rodgers received the VFW Georgia 911 Dispatcher of the Year award.

The box is located at Fayette Care Clinic on Bradford Square in Fayetteville. The box is open and accessible to the public at any time.\n\n“Fayette County is not immune to the opioid overdose epidemic our Nation is currently enduring. This is evidenced by the number of opioid related emergencies our units routinely respond to. Our crews, and law enforcement officials, have been successful in reversing the effects of opioids in many of these incidents by administering naloxone (Narcan). Unfortunately, there are patients whose condition deteriorates to respiratory failure, and eventual cardiac arrest before the medication can be administered,” Scott R. Roberts, Assistant Chief and EMS Director said.\n\n“Naloxone is proven to be effective in reversing overdoses caused by opioids, including synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. The key to the effectiveness of this medication is early administration during an overdose. This can be achieved by bystanders who have acquired Naloxone through one of the resources available. However, due to the stigma associated with drug use, cost of the medication at pharmacies, denial of addiction, and other reasons, a small percentage of the high risk to overdose population have it available,” he said. “The addition of the Naloxone box at the Fayette Cares Clinic, provides people who are high risk to opioid overdose a resource to the life-saving medication 24/7, in a discreet location. The hope is many will take advantage of this resource and have naloxone available to administer as soon as an overdose is suspected, drastically increasing the chance of survival. We are honored to have partnered with In Ryan’s Name, Fayette Cares Clinic, and Georgia Overdose Prevention in combating the opioid epidemic by providing this valuable resource,” Roberts said.\n\nThis live map has locations listed of where to find other boxes. Doreen Barr, In Ryan’s Name founder and president will insure the box remains stocked with the medication.\n\nCamp Creek Phase 1 Ribbon Cutting\n\nThe Fayette County Board of Commissioners marked the completion of the Camp Creek Phase 1 Path Project with a ribbon cutting.

The project, kicked-off February 1st , is expected to be completed at the end of 2025 with help from the installation contractor, Pedal Valves, Inc.\n\nAs part of the metering system upgrade, customers can access an application, Eye0nWater, a user-friendly phone or computer application that allows access to water usage data on an hourly basis. The new tool allows customers to set up notification alerts for potential leaks or excess water usage to help avoid water loss leading to unexpectedly high bills. Ultrasonic meters have no moving parts increasing the longevity and accuracy of this infrastructure.\n\n“The Fayette County Board of Commissioners chose to allocate a portion of the County’s American Recovery Plan Act funding to this multi-million-dollar infrastructure investment that benefits most County residents for decades to come. We remain vigilant in meeting the challenges of source water protection, water conservation and community education while continuing to provide safe drinking water to everyone in the community,” Vanessa Tigert, Water System Director said.\n\nProject notification letters are being sent to all Fayette County Water System customers in advance of the meter installation. Water System staff are working closely with the contractor to ensure a seamless customer experience during the meter upgrade.\n\nThis project will improve water usage, billing, and potential leak notifications to residents and businesses. In addition to supporting environmental stewardship, this project will enable Fayette County Water System to provide enhanced customer service and improve operational efficiencies.\n\nFor more information about the project and the capabilities of the new meters, we invite you to visit our website at www.fayettecountyga.gov/water.\n\nFayette County, GA - What are the responsibilities of a planning commission?

Roundabouts are a proven safety countermeasure over stop-controlled intersections with lower vehicle speeds, less delay, less conflict points, and a reduction in air pollution due to less idling time. When compared to traditional signalized or stop-controlled intersections, roundabouts have been shown to substantially reduce severe and fatal crashes by an average of 80 percent.\n\nManeuvering roundabouts is as easy as 1-2-3 – Slow Down, Look Around, and Be Ready to Yield. For all vehicles and bikes, the traffic flows counterclockwise in a roundabout and traffic already in the circle of the roundabout has the right-of-way. Slow down on approach and watch for pedestrians, bicycles, and golf carts. Yield to any traffic, including bikes, already in the roundabout and then be prepared to yield to pedestrians and golf carts in the crosswalk as you exit the roundabout. The Federal High Administration’s (FHWA) \"Rules of the Roundabout\" video is available here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peUf2NRdWxs.\n\nAdditional work for the multi-use paths is ongoing, no additional detours or lane closures are expected. Exercise caution going through the area as drivers adjust to the new traffic control.\n\nCounty Tag Office Celebrates Renovation\n\nThe Fayette County Tag and Tax Commissioner’s Office held a ribbon cutting ceremony for its remodeled offices on January 11.

A couple recently got the chance to thank the medics and fighters who saved their baby's life.\n\nOn Nov. 12, Fayette County received a 911 call about a 7-week-old premature baby who was not breathing and was possibly in cardiac arrest.\n\nThe firefighters arrived to find the baby turning blue and not moving or breathing.\n\nThe team got to work immediately and was able to quickly resuscitate the infant and rush him to the hospital.\n\n\"There is never a more intense emergency call than when a child’s life is threatened,\" the Fayette County Department of Fire and Emergency Services wrote on Facebook. \"We are just glad these professionals were there and gave this story a happy ending.\"\n\n“This is a great story to highlight the work our responders perform everyday for the community,” said Jeff Hill, Fayette County’s Fire Chief.\n\nAfter the baby boy had recovered, the family reached out to thank the crews for saving their son's life and had the chance to meet the group again.\n\nFayette County Construction Updates\n\nInstallation of an all-way stop at Old Greenville and Goza Road\n\nThe intersection of Old Greenville Road and Goza Road was converted to an all-way stop intersection on November 30, 2023. The change was made to address the trend of increasing crash rates at the intersections over the past few years. Signs, rumble strips, and paint marking were installed to help alert drivers of the change. This improvement was successfully completed in house by Fayette County’s Road Department. Staff will continue to monitor and track crash rates as well as the impact of the all-way stop on traffic flow.\n\nActivation of traffic signal at Tyrone Road and Flat Creek Trail\n\nThe existing all-way stop at Tyrone Road and Flat Creek Trail was converted to a traffic signal on December 8, 2023. No new turn or thru lanes were added. The intent of the project is to improve traffic flow on Tyrone Road, especially during the AM and PM peak hours. Although additional turn lanes may be required in the future, Fayette Count elected to implement this relatively fast and low-cost improvement to address the growing traffic volumes through the intersection. The project (17TAL) was funded through the 2017 Special Purpose Local Option Sales Tax (SPLOST).

Recipients were presented with their achievement certificates during the 2023 ACCG Legislative Leadership Conference at the Jekyll Island Convention Center in Glynn County. Commissioner Charles Oddo was honored for successfully completing the Intergovernmental Relations specialty track requirements in the Lifelong Learning Academy. Anita Godbee, Parks and Recreation Director, completed the Quality of Life/Social Issues track. Jeff Hill, Fire Chief and Katye Vogt, 911 Director, completed the Public Safety track.\n\n“I am pleased to have accomplished another level in the continuing education provided by the Association of County Commissioners of GA. ACCG programs provide a source of real-life, professional experience that participants can draw on to better their own public service skills. Since being elected, I have been proud to be a proponent of continuing education not only for our Commissioners, but for our staff as well. The insight we all gain from participating translates into better service to our Community, which in the final analysis is our purpose for what we do,” Commissioner Oddo said.\n\nACCG and the Carl Vinson Institute of Government at the University of Georgia have collaborated for more than two decades to provide county officials with supplemental training and educational tools in the Lifelong Learning Academy. With abundant courses from which they may choose, every county official has a tailor-made learning experience that allows them to excel in specific areas of expertise.\n\n“The Lifelong Learning Academy is critical to educating county officials about the challenges they may encounter in public service,” said Dave Wills, ACCG Executive Director. “County leaders who prioritize furthering their education are better equipped to address those challenges and are assets to their communities. I commend Oddo for his unwavering dedication to understanding his community.”\n\nThe Lifelong Learning Academy was created with input from county commissioners who identified courses based on the issues and decision-making challenges regularly faced by county officials. To ensure the course requirements and curriculum remain relevant and engaging, the ACCG Lifelong Learning Committee – comprised of county commissioners and staff from both ACCG and the Carl Vinson Institute of Government at the University of Georgia – meet regularly to review and adjust accordingly. Through this collaborative approach, the Lifelong Learning Academy has been successful in equipping county officials with the necessary skills to meet the needs of their constituents.\n\nFayette County Animal Shelter wins Friends Animal Society Award\n\nFayette County, GA – The Fayette County Animal Shelter was awarded the \"We are a NO-KILL Shelter\" award from the Best Friends Animal Society in recognition of achieving a 90% save rate or more of the animals in the shelter. To be considered “No Kill,” a shelter or rescue must have a live release rate of 90%.\n\n\"We have been “No Kill” by definition since 2018. Fayette County Animal Control maintains a 96-98% live release rate annually,\" Jerry Collins, Director, said.\n\n\"Fayette County has a small shelter compared to other organizations surrounding us. Our current shelter has space for 26 dogs and 40 cats. Keeping the high-live release rate has been a community achievement, thanks to the many rescues, volunteers, and the hard-working staff at Animal Control,\" he said.\n\n\"Staff has been very creative in utilizing the space available and working within the policies and procedures set forth to keep animals safe and in a clean environment. Since 2018 the Fayette County Board of Commissioners and Administration have been strong supporters of Animal Control with increased funding in key areas such as medical and cleaning supplies. They even set up a special fund to pay for spay and neuters of any animal that leaves the shelter so that any animal adopted from our shelter is already spayed or neutered. They also have funded the building of a new shelter which should be complete in early 2024,\" Collins said.\n\n\"I know that this success would not have happened without all the hard work of all involved. I often say it takes a village to achieve great things. From where I stand, the village is strong and successful,\" he said.\n\nBest Friends Animal Society is a leading animal welfare organization founded in 1984. They work to end the killing of dogs and cats in America’s shelters by 2025.\n\nRoad Closures Scheduled for Intersection of Redwine Road, Bernhard Road, and South Peachtree Parkway\n\nOctober 19, 2023 - Beginning Monday November 6, 2023, portions of the Redwine Road, Bernhard Road and South Peachtree Parkway intersection will be closed to thru traffic. Road closures are required due to the amount of grading and storm pipe installation needed for construction of a roundabout. Depending on the travel direction, drivers may have to follow a detour around the closed segment(s). The detour period is expected to last approximately four weeks, weather permitting. To minimize traffic impacts, the closures are planned in two phases, each having its own detour.\n\nPhase 1 is scheduled to begin on November 6, 2023. During this stage Bernhard Road and the southern leg of Redwine Road will be closed to all traffic. The other approaches to the intersection (Redwine Road north and S. Peachtree Parkway) will remain open. The posted detour around the closed segment of Bernhard Road is approximately 8.5 miles and follows SR 85, Harp Road, and Redwine Road. The posted detour around the closed segment of Redwine Road is approximately 3.5 miles and follows South Peachtree Parkway, Robinson Road, and Redwine Road. Please see the attached Phase 1 Detour map. Phase 1 has an expected duration of 14 days.\n\nPhase 2 is scheduled to begin November 27, 2023. For Phase 2, approximately 500 feet of South Peachtree Parkway will be closed to all traffic. The other approaches to the intersection (Redwine Road north, Redwine Road south, and Bernhard Road) will remain open to traffic, although there may be intermittent lane closures which may cause delays. The posted detour around the closed segment of South Peachtree Parkway is approximately 3.5 miles and follows Robinson Road and Redwine Road. Please see the attached Phase 2 Detour map. Phase 2 has an expected duration of 14 days.\n\nIf the work proceeds as planned, all legs of the intersection will be open (no detours) during the week of Thanksgiving.\n\nAccess will be maintained to all properties during the detour period, including One Church, located at the southeast corner of Redwine Road and Bernhard Road. In addition, the contractor plans to maintain passage for pedestrians and golf carts using temporary gravel paths.\n\nOnce complete, the roundabout and new path crossings will reduce traffic delay and improve safety. During construction the road closures and associated detours will be impactful to drivers and neighboring communities. Please allow extra time when driving through the area and use caution to help protect the workers, pedestrians, golf carts, bicyclists, and other drivers. The school system is aware of the pending detours and is making plans for their buses. We are working closely with the contractor to provide current and accurate information to the public and will issue updates as appropriate. For questions, please contact Fayette County Public Works at 770-320-6010 or publicworks@fayettecountyga.gov.\n\nThis project (17TAL) is funded with Fayette County’s 2017 Special Purpose Local Option Sales Tax (SPLOST) program.

The new location will be open for business on September 11, 2023 at 8 a.m..\n\nThe Fayette County Elections and Voter Registration Department will be fully operational at 140 Stonewall Ave. West, Suite 208, Fayetteville, GA, 30214 until September 8, 2023.\n\n“Our new facility offers us the opportunity to better serve our voters,” Brian Hill, Director of Elections and Registration, said. “We look forward to continuing to serve our county’s election needs and work at our new location.”\n\nSecretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced the successful audit of Fayette County’s election infrastructure\n\n(Fayetteville, GA) – Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced the successful audit of Fayette County’s election infrastructure, both software and hardware, in preparation for the 2023 municipal elections and 2024 Presidential elections. In coordination with the Fayette County election office, the Secretary of State’s office recently conducted health checks of the voting system, finding that Fayette County’s election infrastructure remains secure, unaltered, and fully functioning as Georgia heads into a major election cycle.\n\nThese health checks are in conjunction with Secretary Raffensperger’s Four-Point Secure The Vote Plan for the 2024 election. That plan includes:\n\nTesting before the election (Logic and Accuracy Testing)\n\nEach and every piece of voting equipment, in all 159 counties, is tested to assure each contest is voting properly, by testing every candidate and ballot position on the Ballot Marking Devices, and that all scanners are reading ballots properly.\n\nTesting during the election (Parallel Monitoring)\n\nLive election equipment will be randomly selected and tested during the active voting period, every day of voting from the start of early voting through Election Day. This testing will detect any active, ongoing threat.\n\nVoter review and accountability\n\nSince 2020, Georgia voters have had the ability to review their own ballot for accuracy before turning it in for tabulation. In 2020, the University of Georgia conducted a study of Georgia’s live elections and found that more than 80% of Georgia’s voters review their ballots.\n\nTesting after the election (Risk Limiting Audits)\n\nWith the passage of HB 316 and SB129, Georgia now has robust post-election audit procedures in place to detect any anomalies in the outcomes of elections.\n\nThese election equipment health checks are part of the greater election security initiative launched by the Secretary of State Raffensperger’s office to administer the most secure elections in the Country. Georgia’s election system consists of multiple layers of security, robust audit procedures, and thorough function and diagnostic testing prior to any election. The Secretary’s top priority is election security, with 100% voter-verified paper-based elections, 100% photo ID, and a 100% commitment to accurate and trusted elections.\n\nAdditionally, the Secretary of State’s office is partnering with the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies to ensure that all 159 county election offices are safe, secure, and held to the highest physical security standards possible.\n\nFAYETTE COUNTY ANNOUNCES ROUNDABOUT CONSTRUCTION\n\nFayette County, G.A. – Fayette County started the construction phase of the roundabout project at the intersection of Redwine Road, Bernhard Road, and Peachtree Parkway.\n\nThe intersection, currently an all‐way stop, will be a single lane roundabout with multi-use paths along all approaches to the intersection. Each approach will have a pedestrian/golf cart crossing. The purpose of the project is to improve safety and traffic flow for vehicles, pedestrians, bicyclists, and golf carts.\n\nThe initial phase of construction includes clearing and utility relocations. This work is underway and will continue through May 29, 2023. Periodic lane closures may be necessary, but no major traffic delays are expected during this phase.\n\nPhysical construction of the roundabout and multi-use path system will begin on or after May 30, 2023, and will continue through early 2024. No full road closures are anticipated during construction of the roundabout; however, travel delays and occasional, temporary lane closures should be expected when traveling through the work zone. Motorists are asked to exercise caution, reduce speed, and allow for additional travel time for trips in the area. Temporary traffic control signs will be in place advising drivers of construction work, traffic shifts or restrictions.\n\nThis project, along with the adjacent path project currently under construction along Redwine Road, are funded by the 2017 SPLOST.\n\nFor additional information, please contact Fayette Cou"
