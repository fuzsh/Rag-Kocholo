        "text": "A new Gator’s Dockside location opened in Jonesville on Monday.\n\nThe new family-friendly, sports-themed restaurant, at 14126 W. Newberry Road, Ste. 10, is 6,100 square feet with an indoor/outdoor bar lined with 42 high-definition televisions playing sports channels.\n\nJerry Roberts, owner of the new Jonesville restaurant, said with the growth the community has displayed recently, he also thought it would make for a good location for the sports-themed restaurant.\n\nBecome A Member\n\nMainstreet does not have a paywall, but pavement-pounding journalism is not free. Join your neighbors who make this vital work possible.\n\n“I’ve lived in Gainesville and the Jonesville area for a really long time,” Roberts said. “I always wanted a restaurant closer to my house, and I just really knew this area would continue to grow.”\n\nRoberts and his wife, Sabrina, are the only franchisees in the company, according to a press release. They currently own five Gator’s locations.\n\nThe opening kicked off with an invite-only pre-opening and fundraiser for Tyler’s Hope Foundation, giving 50% of alcohol sales to the nonprofit’s mission to advance research for dystonia.\n\n“We had people pulling on the door every day trying to see if they could get in,” Roberts said. “But it was really awesome overall. The kitchen did great, the front of the house. Lots of positive, five-star reviews on Google, so overall it was just a great weekend.”\n\nRoberts said he wants Gator’s to remain involved in the community with other fundraisers, and with sports sponsorships for local teams.\n\nThe Gator’s Dockside menu ranges from burgers and sandwiches to ribs, seafood, salad, desserts and fried gator tail. The restaurant highlights its chicken wings with 20 sauce options, including mandarin orange, Dr. Pepper BBQ, chipotle honey BBQ and more.\n\nRoberts said the bar was designed to allow an open flow between the indoor and outdoor portions, and the large floorplan allows for plenty of seating. The restaurant leans a little into a technology angle, displaying the computer that runs the televisions, both as a feature and to keep it out of the kitchen area.\n\nThe restaurant is open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday-Thursday and 11 a.m.-11 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. To-go orders can be placed online at docksidetogo.com or by calling 352-888-4002."
