        "text": "The funeral service for Jimmy Eugene “Bo” Anderson will be 1 p.m., Saturday, August 17, at Pinebluff Baptist Church with burial in the church cemetery. Visitation is from 11 a.m. until the time of the service. Riverwood Family Funeral Service is in charge of arrangements.\n\nJimmy “Bo” Anderson, 86, of Crystal Springs, MS, went to be with his Savior August 9, 2024. Bo was born in Dentville, MS on December 12, 1937. He was one of eight children born to Edwin Anderson, Sr. and Vera Strong Anderson.\n\nHe was married to Lois Kay Anderson on June 16, 1967, and they had two children, Paul Anderson and Susan Kay Anderson. He was pawpaw to Emmalee Kay Anderson and Walker Bo Anderson.\n\nBo retired from Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 619. He was a welder and pipefitter.\n\nUntil he had a stroke, he was an active member of the Pinebluff Masonic Lodge.\n\nPinebluff Baptist Church has been his church family all his life.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his parents, Edwin and Vera Anderson; brothers, Edwin Anderson, Jr., Percy “Buck” Anderson, Frank Anderson, and Billy “Pill” Anderson; and sisters, Julia Mae Anderson, Doris Barnett, and Trixie Parrett.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Lois; son, Paul Anderson (Christy) and daughter, Susan Kay; and grandchildren, Emmalee and Walker Anderson.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorials may be made to Pinebluff Dentville Cemetery Foundation, P.O. Box 51, Hazlehurst, MS 39083.\n\nThe funeral service for Mary Michelle Furr Smith will be 1 p.m., Monday, August 12, at Riverwood Family with burial in Union Hall Baptist Church Cemetery. Visitation is from 11 a.m. until the time of service at Riverwood.\n\nMary Michelle Furr Smith, 48, peacefully passed away at her home on Thursday, August 8, 2024. Born in McComb, MS, on July 4, 1976, to Charles Earl Furr and Jean Quinn Furr, Michelle was a proud Brookhaven Academy graduate, Class of 1994. Known affectionately as \"Firecracker,\" a nickname that reflected her bicentennial birthday and her fiery, never-give-up spirit, Michelle brought joy and energy wherever she went.\n\nMichelle’s greatest joy came from being a devoted wife and mother. She relished every moment spent raising her two young sons and took immense pride in her role at home. Her affection for her pets: Miss Kitty and Miss Dixie, the cats, Lani the dog, and her pig, Sir Oinks A Lot, was a testament to her warm and loving nature. When she wasn’t tending to their animals, Michelle could often be found in her garden or behind the lens of her camera, capturing the nature and beauty of their land.\n\nMichelle's bravery extended beyond her family and friends. She became a beacon of hope and inspiration at the University of Mississippi Medical Cancer Center. Her participation in research trials for brain cancer was marked by an extraordinary spirit that even inspired her oncologist to remain in the field rather than switch careers. Michelle's courage and determination were truly inspiring, and her humor and zest for life were contagious.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her father, Charles Earl Furr, and her father-in-law, Philip Eugene Smith Sr., as well as other cherished family members who will be celebrating her spirit from afar.\n\nMichelle leaves behind her loving husband of 29 years, Philip Eugene Smith Jr.; her sons, Cason Lee Smith and Charles “Charlie” Elliott Smith; her mother, Jean Quinn Furr; her brother, Charles Brian Furr; her mother-in-law, Phyllis Smith Hobbs; her sister-in-law, Jennifer Smith Heffner; and many nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, and cousins. Her circle of friends was vast and filled with significant individuals fortunate to have shared in her life.\n\nThe family also extends heartfelt thanks to the Dignity Hospice team, especially nurses Amy Wiley, Kristi Wilson, Sherri Brooks, and Nova York, for their compassionate care.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family invites contributions to a trust for her sons, Cason and Charlie, to be sent to Philip Smith, 495 Mallalieu Drive SE, Brookhaven, MS 39601\n\nMichelle’s vibrant and enduring spirit will continue to inspire and bring joy to those who knew her, and she will be dearly missed.\n\nThe funeral service for Troy Lamar Floyd is 2 p.m., Tuesday, August 13, at Bethel Temple Church with burial in the church cemetery. Friends and family will have a time of visitation from 11 a.m. until the time of the service for Mr. Floyd.\n\nTroy is a lifelong resident of Lincoln County. He was truly “one of a kind”. He was a devoted Christian and a career lawman. He wholeheartedly loved protecting and serving. Troy could witness of God’s love for you, quoting scripture, while putting on the handcuffs. His love for people and a call to protect them led him into law enforcement and politics. Troy graduated from Brookhaven High School in 1993 and began his career in law enforcement in 1996. As a career law man, Troy has proven leadership, strong criminal enforcement, effective crime prevention, and established partnerships in the community and state that has made Lincoln County and the surrounding areas stronger.\n\nTroy’s credentials include Mississippi Law Enforcement Officers Training Academy, Federal Law Enforcement Training Center Instructor, Civilian Response to Active Shooter Instructor, certifications in School Resource Officer, DARE Instructor, and Canine Officer, Interview and Interrogation Training, Raid Planning Training, Drug Interdiction Officer (which included Motor Vehicles and Commercial Vehicles), specialized training with the Mexican Cartels by the DEA, Certified Agent with Mississippi Department of Corrections (specializing in high risk offenders and sex offenders), former Assistant Police Chief of Wesson, Drug & Human Trafficking Interdiction, ALERRT Active Shooter Instructor, STAR Program Instructor, and a Mentor at Camp Shelby for troubled youth. He was also a Lincoln County Jailer and a full time Deputy. These are just a surface listing of his many accomplishments. To name everything would take far too many pages.\n\nTroy was genuinely liked by most people and loved by many more. Everyone that knew Troy probably has a funny story to tell. He could be a little skiddish at times, depending on his current location and/or present company. With all his quirks aside, Troy was a loving husband and a doting dad and Papa. He truly loved his family and was loyal to his friends. This is only a brief synopsis of an all too brief life, but if you asked Troy what was most important to him, I believe he would tell you it was his salvation.\n\nTroy is preceded in death by his parents, Eddie and Hilda Ray Floyd; his maternal great grandparents, Eugene and Hattie Pennington; paternal grandparents, Sam Floyd and Johnnie Sanchez; and grandparents, Cliff Givens and Helen Shaheen.\n\nHe is survived by his wife of 10 years, Sage Floyd; children, Raiden Floyd (Shelby) of Sandyhook, MS, Carlyanna Nicholoson (Brayden) of Wesson, MS, and Jacob Floyd of Brookhaven, MS; brother, Eddie Floyd, Jr. of West Monroe, LA; sisters, Cristi Montgomery (Mike) of Union, MS, Terry Hedgepeth of McComb, MS, Missy Freeman (Mark) of Brookhaven, MS; two grandchildren, Morgan Floyd and Brancin Floyd; and a host of other loving family members, friends, law enforcement officers, and faith family members.\n\nLincoln 8 out!\n\nThe funeral service for Eunice Daughdrill Clark will be 11 a.m., Wednesday, August 7, at Riverwood Family with burial in Springhill Baptist Church Cemetery. Visitation is from 9 a.m. until the time of the service.\n\nMrs. Clark, 84, of Wesson, died August 1, 2024, at her residence. She was born in Sontag, MS, July 31, 1940, to Eugene Daughdrill and Ollie Belle Stephens Daughdrill. She was a loving wife, mother, and grandmother, she cared for her family deeply and leaves a legacy of faith and grace. She was a member of Springhill Baptist Church and served there for many years in many ways, including Sunday School teacher for youth, singing in the church choir, and ministering to the residents at the nursing homes. She enjoyed playing her piano and singing. She was an avid bowler and was in a bowling league for many years. Among her favorite pastimes were tending to her rose garden, sewing and quilting. Mrs. Clark will be greatly missed by her family as well as her faith family at Springhill.\n\nShe is preceded in death by her parents; brother, Denver Daughdrill; and sisters, Gennie Allen, Charlene Wallace, and Gladys Cobb.\n\nThose left to cherish her memory are her husband of 68 years, Jimmie Clark; children, Marilyn Phillips (Flip), Michael Clark (Ann); brother, Billy Daughdrill; sisters, Maggie Russell, Louise Savoie, Ruth Sills, and Lilly Hedgepeth; five grandchildren, Jennifer Crapps, Jessica Dowd, Chris Phillips, Staci Phillips, Joseph Clark; 12 great grandchildren, Laynee, Rowan, Ryleigh, Ainslea, Harper, Naomi, Noah, Ady Rose, Karly Kay, Maddie Jo, Kyle, and Braxton. She is also survived by a special friend, Hazel McLendon, as well as other loving family members and friends.\n\nApril 5, 1959 – August 3, 2024\n\nA memorial service for Sonja will be held Thursday, August 8, at 10:30 a.m., at Providence Baptist Church. You may pay your respects to the family beginning at 10 a.m. A small graveside service will follow. Riverwood Family is in charge of arrangements.\n\nSonja Marie DeWitt Grayson was born April 5, 1959 to Roscoe and Dixie DeWitt. Joining her older brother, Tommy, their family was complete. Born with grace and an extra dose of grit, there was never a question if a task would be completed, if Sonja was involved, she always gave her best with every endeavor she encountered. Sonja’s philosophy was to do a job that would make everyone, including yourself, proud.\n\nIn her early years, throughout college, and on into adulthood, Sonja was known for her outstanding athleticism. Whether on a softball field or the court of a gymnasium, Sonja was in her element and her talent shined. Sonja came to know Christ as a young girl, and even through the troubles and trials of life, she would return to seek the love and guidance of her Savior.\n\nSonja married Randy L. Grayson, Sr. on April 2, 1988. With their union, Sonja was blessed with Kristen, Randy Jr., and Brandy and she became “Mama Sonja”. Years later their family would be complete when Randy and Sonja’s son, Jordan DeWitt Grayson was born. At this time, Sonja would add the title of “Mama” to her ever-growing list, but this title was one she was beyond proud of. During her adult years, Sonja could be found in her community serving others. Whether it was coaching a ball team, serving through different avenues with her church family, or simply helping others; Sonja could be found exhibiting what it was to truly be the hands and feet of Christ.\n\nAnyone that knew Sonja, knew three things about her. First, she was a true Ole Miss Rebel- through and through. Secondly, family was everything to Sonja. She stated on multiple occasions, “if you don’t have family, you don’t have anything”. This was evident in Sonja’s life as she was fiercely close to her cousins, so much that she was known as “Aunt Sonja” to all their children. Later in life, Sonja gained yet another title, “MawMaw”. This was by far her favorite title to date. Lastly, of all the titles she held- Mama, MawMaw, Rebel fan, Aunt, Sister, Cousin, Friend- there was one that she still held closest to her heart. Sonja was a child of God and she was quick to share her story with others. A story with a few bumps in the road, and even a few wrong turns; She was always fast to share her redemption story-one she credited her one and only Savior.\n\nOn August 3, 2024, Sonja was called into Glory, surrounded by her family at her own piece of Heaven on Earth- a small farm in Beat 3 she called home. While our hearts ache, we rejoice in the promise that she was greeted by Jesus and all the loved ones that went before her as well as the reassurance we will see her again one day.\n\nSonja DeWitt Grayson was preceded in death by her parents, Roscoe and Dixie DeWitt, and her brother, Tommy DeWitt.\n\nThose left to cherish her memory include her husband, Randy Grayson Sr., her son, Jordan Grayson (Lindsey), stepchildren: Kristen Ready (Derek), Randy Grayson Jr., and Brandy Carney (Corey), 10 grandchildren, Hendrix Grayson, Myles Grayson, Macy Carney, Rylea Carney, Reagan Carney, Daytin Ready, Adley Ready, Caden Grayson, Claire Grayson, Callie Grayson; 2 great grandchildren, Kohen Grayson, Kollins Grayson and a host of special cousins, nieces, nephews, and friends.\n\n“To be absent from the body, is to be present with the Lord.”\n\n2 Corinthians 5:8\n\nAngela Caye Spencer, 68, of Brookhaven, left her earthly home on July 31, 2024, surrounded by her family. She was born December 15, 1955, to Proby and Peggy Castilaw. Angie enjoyed her family and the friends that she made throughout her life. She was a devoted wife of 49 years, a loving mother, a sister, a cousin, and also a friend but she was happiest being “Nana”. The people who brought her the most joy and were the best part of life, according to her, were her 10 grandchildren.\n\nShe is preceded in death by her parents; her sisters, Carolyn Logan and Laurie Burnett; mother and father-in-law, Perry C. and Loretta Spencer; sister-in-law, Sue Errington; and her brother-in-law, Doyle Waldrop.\n\nShe is survived by her husband, Bruce Spencer; children, Casey Waldrop (Brad), Grant Spencer (Gayla), and Jessi Claire Stringer; grandchildren, Tanner (Carly), Emma and Payne Waldrop, Cole and Kyndal Spencer, Charli Jane, Kirtland, Abigail, Hank and Ada Perry Stringer; and sister, Iris Waldrop.\n\nFriends and family are invited to gather and celebrate Angie’s life on August 3rd, 2024, at Riverwood Family Funeral Service in Brookhaven MS. Visitation will begin at 9:00 AM with memorial service at 11:00 AM, and graveside services at Heuck’s Retreat Baptist Church to follow immediately after."
