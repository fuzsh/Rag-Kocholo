        "text": "William N. Twombly was born on October 20, 1933, and died on August 5, 2024.\n\nBill was born to Eli and Ethel in Trenton, Florida the second of four children. He graduated from Trenton High School, and attended Pacific Union College and Southern Adventist University. He lived in Angwin ,Ca., Tacoma Park, Md., and Collegedale.\n\nHe was drafted into the Army during the Korean War and volunteered for Operation Whitecoat, a medical research program at Fort Detrick. The goal was to develop and test the effectiveness of vaccines and treatments for viruses and bacteria anticipated in biological attack. The R&D resulted in treatments for yellow fever, hepatitis, Q fever and others. Later in life he developed Interstitial Lung Disease which the VA determined was a direct result of his participation in the Whitecoats. The Whitecoats offered him the opportunity to serve in a way that was consistent with his deeply held convictions and his status as a conscientious objector.\n\nHe was active in his church having worked four years at the General Conference of Seventh-Day Adventist and 28 years at Southern Adventist University. He helped establish three churches, served as a deacon, elder, and youth leader.\n\nHe was a member of the Ooltewah-Collegedale Kiwanis Club for 14 years serving as president for one term. He was proud to serve three different times as commander of the Desmond T. Doss American Legion Post 257 and as a member for 21 years.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, brother, Clarence, sister, Helen, son, David, and son-in-law, Layton Wilson and is survived by his wife, Sandra, brother, Kenneth, daughter, Kari Wilson, son, Kenneth, stepson, Raymond (Kimmi) Peet, eight grandchildren, six great-grandchildren, and many nieces and nephews.\n\nFuneral services will be held at 11 a.m. on Monday, Aug. 12, in the Valley View Chapel of Chattanooga Funeral Home with Pastor Jerry Arnold and Pastor David Smith officiating. Burial will follow in the Chattanooga National Cemetery with military rites being conducted.\n\nThe family will receive friends from 2–4 p.m. and 6–8 p.m. on Sunday, Aug. 11, at the funeral home.\n\nPlease share your thoughts and memories online at www.ChattanoogaValleyViewChapel.com\n\nArrangements are by Chattanooga Funeral Home, Valley View Chapel, 7414 Old Lee Highway, Chattanooga, Tn. 37421."
