        "text": "KAUKAUNA, Wis. â Nearly one-fourth of adults aged 65 and older are considered to be socially isolated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIt is not unusual for many to live alone, lose family or friends, or have a chronic illness.\n\nOutagamie Countyâs ElderMatch Program is working to change that.\n\nJerry Roberts is a retired record-keeper of sorts. For 26 years, Roberts worked as a high school librarian.\n\nThis retired âkeeper of storiesâ now listens to tales of yesteryears as a volunteer with ElderMatch.\n\nâRight now, I have a 102-year-old woman who was a WAC (Womenâs Army Corps) during World War II, and that was a program for women who were involved during the war,â Roberts said.\n\nElderMatch volunteers form connections with seniors through phone calls and letters. Roberts said he loves in-home visits.\n\nâItâs like visiting your grandpa, your grandma, and if you are fortunate to be able to socialize with them, which most people can, then you can socialize with another person. Itâs just talking. Itâs conversation, and you learn stuff,â Roberts said.\n\nMany elders canât or donât want to leave the comfort of their home.\n\nBecky Reichelt is the executive director at St. Paul Elder Services in Kaukauna. Reichelt said the ElderMatch program offers a compassionate twist to assisted living.\n\nâMaybe itâs, you know, playing cards that they havenât been able to play with somebody in the past. Maybe itâs reading their favorite book, but their vision is impaired now, and someone can help to read those stories to them. So the impact has been great with the participants in the program,â Reichelt said.\n\nThe program is a partnership between St. Paul Elder Services and Outagamie County. Itâs for the countyâs residents who are 60 and older.\n\nKali Erickson is the coordinator of the Outagamie Aging Unit.\n\nâWe know that thereâs seniors in the community who are independent. Maybe they have a physical disability thatâs causing them to be homebound. Maybe they donât have friends and family in the area who are checking on them or able to make that connection. So thatâs where our program can come in,â Erickson said.\n\nRoberts said his time with seniors is like reading a book. With the turn of a page, he discovers something new about his senior clients.\n\nâI feel good when I get done talking to them because you donât know if youâre going to learn anything from them or not, but you usually do,â Roberts said."
