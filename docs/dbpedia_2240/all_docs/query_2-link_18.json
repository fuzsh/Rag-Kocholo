        "text": "A memorial service commemorating Raymond \"Jerry\" Roberts - a World War Two Bletchley Park codebreaker - has been held.\n\nCapt Roberts, from Liphook, Hampshire, was part of a group that cracked the German high command's Tunny code at the British codebreaking centre.\n\nTheir decrypts made it possible to read Hitler's own messages during the war.\n\nThe service took place at St Martin-in-the-Fields in Trafalgar Square, London, at 11:00 BST.\n\nCapt Roberts, who died in March following a short illness, joined Bletchley Park as a German linguist and was among four founder members of the Testery section - named after its head Ralph Tester.\n\nTheir target was to crack a system known as Tunny, which carried the messages of Hitler's top generals and the Fuhrer himself.\n\nThe system used four times as many encryption wheels as the famous Enigma machine - which carried military communications."
