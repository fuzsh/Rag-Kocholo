        "text": "by Rebekah Bresee\n\nEditor-in-Chief\n\nWhitworth is ranked 11 out of 21 in College Niche’s “2016 Top Party Schools in Washington.” The rankings are based on student opinion of a school’s “party scene and access to bars,” according to the website.\n\nBased on a response of 80 students, Whitworth scored a three out of ve for the party scene and a “A-” on access to bars. Pacific Lutheran University, Northwest University and Seattle Pacific University are ranked 14, 16 and 18 respectively. Perhaps the party scene at Whitworth is not as “lame” as some people may believe.\n\nOne of “The Big Three” explicitly prohibits the possession, consumption or distribution of alcohol, illegal drugs/mood-altering substances or controlled medication without a prescription, according to the student handbook. Residence Hall leadership collaborates with their residents to create “community building standards” which usually decided how late and how loud residents can be.\n\nThose factors, and the fact that Whitworth does not have a Greek system, means the “party scene” on Whitworth campus is slim to none. Those regulations force parties beyond the pinecone curtain.\n\nHouse parties—which the Whitworthian defines as an off campus event where alcohol is present, there is music and people are inebriated—near Whitworth are often held on the weekends. One party host said the purpose of their parties are to hang out with friends and have a fun time.\n\nThe occurrence and locations of parties are usually spread through social media or word of mouth. The party host gets people to his or her house by telling friends to come. Students have to know the right people, according to a review of the Whitworth party scene on College Niche.\n\nEspecially with a smaller community, it is often easy to identify where the party is located based on the number of people surrounding the house and loud music playing.\n\n“Usually, I will set up beer pong with water in a common area and start playing music on the speakers,” a party host said about preparing for a party.\n\nBeer pong and other drinking games are a common occurrence at those parties. Music is usually always playing for atmospheric effect and at least one group of people can be found dancing.\n\nIt is the volume of the music that often causes local law enforcement to get involved.\n\n“Sometimes [the cops show up]; it depends on the location,” a party host said. “If so, they usually just ask to keep the noise down.”\n\nAbout 50 to 100 people usually attend the parties, and they typically start at 10 p.m. and end at 2 a.m., the host said.\n\nIt seems Whitworth friendliness and decency is maintained at those parties, for the most part. The party host said the people attending their parties do not get particularly crazy. However, if people do get out of control, the party host said they would talk to whoever was acting up.\n\nA party can end multiple ways. Sometimes the police show up and scare people away. Other times, word gets around that another party is occurring close by and people will leave to check it out or the host may decide it is time for the party to end and kick everyone out.\n\n“The best part is socializing and making great memories with your friends and the worst part is having to clean up the following day,” a party host said. “I would rather attend [a party].”\n\nWhile the party scene at Whitworth may not be as ”friendly and vibrant” as University of Washington or Washington State University—ranked one and two on College Niche’s “2016 Top Party Schools in Washington,” respectively—it is nonetheless present and active."
