        "text": "Our Mission\n\nWhitworth University is a private, residential, liberal arts institution affiliated with the Presbyterian church. Since 1890, Whitworth has provided its diverse student body an education of mind and heart, equipping its graduates to honor God, follow Christ and serve humanity. This mission is carried out by a community of Christian scholars committed to excellent teaching and to the integration of faith and learning.\n\nOur Core Themes\n\nSince 1890, Whitworth University has held fast to its founding mission to provide its students an education of mind and heart characterized by rigorous and open intellectual inquiry and the integration of Christian faith and learning. Anchored in the Reformed tradition and enriched throughout its history by strong evangelical and ecumenical currents, Whitworth's mission is carried out by a diverse community of dedicated Christian scholars and staff members who are called to a variety of vocations to serve and support students. Whitworth believes that the best learning occurs in the context of relationship – inside and outside of the classroom – where faculty and staff members alike invest in the lives of students. Whitworth is committed to modeling the highest standards of integrity and fairness and to being a trusted and valued member of the community.\n\nWhitworth's three core themes flow from our mission statement and guide our community. As a comprehensive and residential Christian liberal arts university, Whitworth strives to fulfill our mission through the following:\n\na community of Christian scholars integrating faith and learning and promoting worldview development in our graduates;\n\nan academically excellent education firmly rooted in the liberal arts and sciences equipping our graduates for reflective lives, careers, and professions; and\n\nan inclusive university community fostering in our graduates intercultural competencies and civic engagement for lives of service in an increasingly diverse world.\n\nOur Heritage\n\nIn 1853, George Whitworth, a minister in the Ohio Valley, convinced 15 families to join him in a wagon train heading from St. Louis to the West. Whitworth's was the only family to complete the brutal five-month journey and reach the Puget Sound area.\n\nAn ordained Presbyterian minister, Whitworth had initially set out on the Oregon Trail to follow his calling to serve as a missionary. He would go on to found at least 15 Presbyterian churches across the Pacific Northwest. He also served as president of the University of Washington and as superintendent of schools in Thurston and King counties.\n\nIn 1883, Whitworth opened Sumner Academy in the village of Sumner, in Washington Territory, under the charge that \"No effort will be spared to elevate the character of the school and to make it an institution of learning of the highest grade.\" On Feb 20, 1890, the school's trustees signed resolutions to increase the curriculum and stature of the academy, which would be known as Whitworth College.\n\nThe catalog from 1890 defined the vision for Whitworth College: \"It is intended to give both sexes a thorough course of education...ever directing them in pursuit of that learning and culture of mind and heart that make the finished scholar....While it is denominational, it does not aim to be sectarian, opening its doors to all lovers of truth and learning.\"\n\nIn 1899, the college had outgrown the rural community of Sumner and moved to Tacoma. Fifteen years later, Whitworth moved a final time: In September 1914, classes began in Spokane at its current campus. In 2007, after 117 years as Whitworth College, the board of trustees approved changing the school's name to Whitworth University. The change was prompted by trends in the higher-education marketplace that led the board to clarify Whitworth's standing as a four-year liberal-arts institution.\n\nScott McQuilkin, Ph.D., became the 19th president of Whitworth University in 2022. An alumnus and longtime employee of the university, McQuilkin earned undergraduate and graduate degrees at Whitworth and has dedicated his professional life to the university and its enduring mission.\n\nIn response to present-day opportunities and challenges, Whitworth, under McQuilkin's leadership, is implementing a strategic plan that focuses the university's work for 2023-28. The plan contains 22 objectives organized under four broad goal areas: Innovation & Learning; Human Flourishing; Financial Flourishing; and Story. Through the execution of this plan, Whitworth will hold fast to its Christ-centered identity while advancing in a host of programmatic, systematic, relational and financial ways.\n\nAs a community, we move forward together with anticipation and confidence in advancing our service to our students, our faculty and staff, our alumni and supporters, our external constituencies, and to the God in whom we have our life, breath and being.\n\nAccreditation\n\nInstitutional Accreditation\n\nWhitworth University is a member institution with the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU). Whitworth's accreditation status is \"Accreditation Reaffirmed.\" The NWCCU's most recent action on the institution's accreditation status on July 24, 2018, was to reaffirm accreditation. NWCCU is an institutional accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA).\n\nAccreditation of an institution of higher education by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities indicates that it meets or exceeds criteria for the assessment of institutional quality evaluated through a peer review process. An accredited college or university is one which has available the necessary resources to achieve its stated purposes through appropriate educational programs, is substantially doing so, and gives reasonable evidence that it will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. Institutional integrity is also addressed through accreditation. Accreditation by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities is not partial but applies to the institution as a whole. As such, it is not a guarantee of every course or program offered, or the competence of individual graduates. Rather, it provides reasonable assurance about the quality of opportunities available to students who attend the institution. Inquiries regarding an institution's accredited status by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities should be directed to the administrative staff of the institution.
