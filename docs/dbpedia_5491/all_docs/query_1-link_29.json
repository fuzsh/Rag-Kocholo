        "text": "Bill Robinson to present keynote speech at Governor's Prayer Breakfast Feb. 26\n\nWhitworth ranks No. 39 on Kiplinger's list of 50 best values in private universities\n\nWhitworth now the highest-ranked school in the Pacific Northwest\n\nWhitworth University has once again captured a top 40 spot on Kiplinger's annual rankings of the 100 best values among private liberal arts colleges and universities in the United States. The university joins some of the most elite schools in the country on the magazine's 2009-10 rankings. It is one of the smallest to appear on the list, yet it is the highest-ranked school in the Pacific Northwest and ranks ahead of all other private universities on the West Coast, with the exceptions of the California Institute of Technology, Stanford University and the University of Southern California.\n\nThe list is posted to the Kiplinger website and appears in Kiplinger's Personal Finance magazine. The magazine ranks the 50 best values among private liberal arts colleges and the 50 best values among private universities separately but based on the same criteria of academic quality and affordability, with academic quality accounting for two-thirds of the formula.\n\nThe California Institute of Technology tops Kiplinger’s list of best university values, followed by Princeton, Yale, Rice and Harvard. West Coast schools joining Whitworth (No. 39) in the top 50 are Stanford University (No. 11), the University of Southern California (No. 33), Santa Clara University (No. 43), and Gonzaga University (No. 50). Whitman College is ranked 20th on the list of best liberal arts college values. The complete rankings can be accessed online at http://www.kiplinger.com/tools/privatecolleges/.\n\n\"Being recognized by Kiplinger's in its 2010 rankings of the best values among private universities is yet another indication of Whitworth's academic quality,\" says Fred Pfursich, vice president of admissions and financial aid at Whitworth. \"Whitworth's top 50 national ranking in this impressive list of private universities clearly acknowledges our commitment to offering a top-tier academic environment along with an excellent financial aid program.\"\n\nThe academic quality measures in Kiplinger's rankings include the percentage of applicants granted admission; the percentage of 2008-09 freshmen who scored 600 or higher on the verbal and math sections of the SAT or 24 or higher on the ACT; student-faculty ratio; and four- and five-year graduation rates.\n\nWhitworth's admissions rate has remained highly selective as the number of applications to the university has grown from 1,115 in 2000 to nearly 6,000 for the fall 2009 freshman class. The average SAT score for incoming freshmen also has climbed steadily, reaching 1790 for the fall 2009 class, compared to the national average of 1510. Whitworth has maintained a 13-to-1 student-faculty ratio even as undergraduate enrollment has grown from 1,878 in 2000 to 2,331 in 2007 (the latest year for which enrollment data was available for the rankings).\n\nThe financial aid measures factored into Kiplinger's rankings include total costs for the 2009-10 academic year, cost minus the average need-based aid amount (excluding loans), the average percentage of a student's financial need met by the school's aid package, the percentage of the average aid package that comes from grants or scholarships, the cost for a student with no demonstrated need after subtracting the average non-need aid amount (excluding loans), the percentage of all undergraduates without need who received non-need-based aid, and the average amount of debt owed by a graduate who took out an educational loan.\n\nWhitworth provided more than $31.3 million in grants and scholarships to undergraduate students in 2009-10. Nearly 98 percent of incoming freshmen receive academic scholarships, which average $9,308 per student.\n\n\"Whitworth is not only a great value but a great investment,\" Pfursich says. \"When students invest in themselves at Whitworth, they can expect personalized attention from faculty, small classes, and abundant opportunities to be involved in athletics, performing arts, clubs and other extracurricular activities. And they can expect to be prepared for successful careers and lives of purpose.\"\n\nLocated in Spokane, Wash., Whitworth is a private liberal arts university affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA). The university, which has an enrollment of 2,700 students, offers 55 undergraduate and graduate degree programs.\n\nContacts:\n\nFred Pfursich, vice president of admissions and financial aid, Whitworth University, (509) 777-4348 or fpfursich@whitworth.edu.\n\nGreg Orwig, director of communications, Whitworth University, (509) 777-4580 or gorwig@whitworth.edu.\n\nWhitworth Wind Symphony to present spring concert tour, March 20-27\n\nExpert on religion and politics in Russia to present lecture at Whitworth March 11\n\n>> Listen to Podcast\n\nAlthough the Cold War ended two decades ago, the United States' relationship with Russia remains complex, and Americans still have much to learn about life in a land long cloaked by the Iron Curtain. Christopher Marsh, Ph.D., an expert on religion and politics in the world's largest country, will present the second lecture in the 53rd annual Great Decisions Lecture Series at Whitworth University. The series features five speakers who focus on current political, cultural and economic subjects of interest to the international community. The public is invited to attend the lectures free of charge. Marsh will present \"Russia and the 'Near Abroad'\" on Thursday, March 11, at 7:30 p.m. in the Robinson Teaching Theatre in Weyerhaeuser Hall at Whitworth University. For more information, please call (509) 777-3270.\n\nMarsh is director of the J.M. Dawson Institute of Church-State Studies and a professor of political science and church-state studies at Baylor University. His expertise centers on religion and politics in Eurasia, with a particular focus on Russia and China. His interests include religion and ethnic conflict, religious liberty in transition societies, and the dialogue between the sociology of religion and the field of church-state studies. He has written or edited eight books, including Orthodoxy, Islam, and Church-State Relations in Russia, and he has written a variety of articles in publications such as Religion, State & Society; Nationalism and Ethnic Politics; Society; and Journal of Church and State. His lecture at Whitworth will draw from the content of his forthcoming book about Russia and the \"near abroad,\" which is a term that refers to the non-Russian countries that once were part of the USSR.\n\n\"Dr. Marsh is a world-class scholar who understands that the countries of the Eurasia region are interdependent and that important forces such as culture and religion play a profound role in their politics,\" says Andrew Hogue, an assistant professor of political science at Whitworth who studied under Marsh at Baylor. \"I can attest firsthand to his engaging style and piercing insight, and we're looking forward to learning more about his research on this extremely significant region.\"\n\nIn addition to the March 11 lecture, Great Decisions lectures will take place on March 18, April 8, and April 22. The lectures will begin at 7:30 p.m. and will be held in Weyerhaeuser Hall's Robinson Teaching Theatre. For information on upcoming lectures, please call (509) 777-3270. Great Decisions 2010 is sponsored by the Whitworth Political Science Department.\n\nLocated in Spokane, Wash., Whitworth is a private liberal arts university affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA). The university, which has an enrollment of 2,700 students, offers 55 undergraduate and graduate degree programs.\n\nContacts:\n\nBarbara Brodrick, academic program assistant, political science department, Whitworth University, (509) 777-3270 or bbrodrick@whitworth.edu.\n\nEmily Proffitt, public information officer, Whitworth University, (509) 777-4703 or eproffitt@whitworth.edu.\n\nWhitworth launches new course on Latinos in the U.S. in response to rising number of Latino students, growing interest in Latin American culture\n\nWhitworth to expand study abroad opportunities with new Costa Rica Center\n\nClasses for up to 30 students will begin this fall in an ideal location offering access to cloud forests, service learning, home stays\n\nLess than an hour's bus ride from Costa Rica's bustling capital of San José, up a scenic mountain road to the edge of a large rain forest lies Whitworth University's newest classroom building and residence hall.\n\nWhitworth's first international study center will begin offering classes in September for up to 30 students, advancing a long-term university goal to increase cross-cultural learning opportunities for students while also adding affordable capacity for anticipated enrollment growth.\n\n\"We've found a site that is ideal for providing students the life-changing, cross-cultural experience afforded by international study,\" says Michael Le Roy, vice president for academic affairs and dean of the faculty at Whitworth. \"Through our Costa Rica program, students will witness the tensions between economic development, conservation, and the global distribution of wealth in the Central American context. These connections are much clearer when students have the opportunity to immerse themselves in a culture and to cultivate a broader understanding of what it means to love one's neighbor.\"\n\nBuilding on Whitworth's more than 30 years of experience leading study programs in Central America, the Costa Rica Center initially will offer courses that meet general education requirements for students in any major. Courses will include intensive Spanish language at various levels; history, culture and civilization of Central America; ecology of Costa Rica; and Core 350 – the capstone course in Whitworth's worldview studies program.\n\nThe center also will offer a special Jan Term Latin American studies program for freshman students admitted with honors, intensive language training for participants in Whitworth's popular Central America Study Program, and other major-specific programs still in the planning stages. In addition, students will participate in service learning, family home-stays, internships, cultural activities, and will travel to cloud forests, volcanoes and other regional sites.\n\nWhitworth Professor of Spanish Lindy Scott will serve as director of the center, and his wife, Assistant Professor of Spanish Dinorah Scott, will teach Spanish and coordinate service-learning and family home-stays for students. The Scotts bring 20 years of experience living in and leading university study programs throughout Latin America to their roles at the center. Lindy Scott also served in the 1990s as academic dean of the Comunidad Teologica, a consortium of seminaries in Mexico City. He says he's excited about the combination of curricular and co-curricular programs to be offered at Whitworth's Costa Rica Center.\n\n\"Our courses in Latin American history and Costa Rican ecology will join together great classroom teaching by expert professors with on-site explorations of the topics, whether it be fauna or democracy,\" Scott says. \"I am especially excited about offering our Core 350 course, which will equip students to look at Christian values and public policy issues in a Latin context. All of this will be permeated with an emphasis on service-learning projects, internships, and family home-stays where students will experience cultural differences and similarities first hand.\"\n\nScott also notes that students who participate in Whitworth's Costa Rica program will significantly affect campus life when they return. \"At any given moment,\" he says, \"we will have more than 100 students on campus who will have experienced life from a Latin American perspective. This will enrich and give flavor to every academic department and class on campus.\"\n\nWhitworth's Costa Rica site includes two buildings that are undergoing remodeling and are very well suited for the university's needs. The 27-acre property also features a spring-fed stream that spills into two small ponds, a second-generation rain forest, and broad lawns where one can easily imagine Whitworth students playing Ultimate Frisbee.\n\nThe main building, formerly a French restaurant frequented by Latin American heads of state, includes space for two or three classrooms, food service, a student lounge and study areas, and an attached apartment for the on-site director. A small adjacent hotel building can accommodate up to 30 students when they're not in home stays or traveling.\n\nJust to the north of the property lies Costa Rica's renowned Braulio Carrillo National Park, which features a dense virgin cloud forest that is home to hundreds of plant, bird and mammal species as well as the 9,534-foot inactive Barva Volcano. A short bus ride to the southwest is the city of Heredia, which has a population of about 110,000 and hosts the main campus of Costa Rica's largest university.\n\nLe Roy says that Whitworth's longer-term plans call for the possible establishment of international centers in Africa, East Asia and Europe as growth continues in faculty expertise, on-the-ground experience and student demand for study in those regions. International centers will allow Whitworth to expand enrollment without comparable expansion of facilities and population on its home campus. Le Roy and Scott also believe Whitworth is responding to a growing student interest in cross-cultural experience.\n\n\"Studies show that after September 11, 2001, there has been a growing desire in North American youth to know more about the larger world,\" Scott says. \"Students want to live, work and serve side by side with our international neighbors. That means speaking their language, learning about their history and customs, playing their sports and appreciating the yearnings of their hearts. An overseas study opportunity is so valuable for learning about and loving our neighbors as we gradually overcome some of our ethnocentrism.\"\n\nLocated in Spokane, Wash., Whitworth is a private liberal arts university affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA).
