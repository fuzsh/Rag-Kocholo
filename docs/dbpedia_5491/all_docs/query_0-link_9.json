        "text": "Whitworth University is pleased to announce it has been selected as one of the best colleges in the West by The Princeton Review.\n\nThe education services company lists Whitworth in the Best West section of its “2024 Best Colleges: Region by Region” web feature. It features 630 colleges that are considered “academically outstanding” in seven zones: Northeast, South, Southwest, Midwest, Mid-Atlantic, West and International. Seventy-nine institutions made this year’s Best West list.\n\nUnlike college rankings that focus exclusively on academics and that are derived from institutional data and administrator peer reviews, The Princeton Review rankings are based on student reports of their experiences at their own schools. Students are given an 85-question survey and asked to rate their professors, administrators, financial aid, campus amenities, school services and other aspects of life.\n\nHere are just a few of the responses given about Whitworth:\n\n• “Academics at Whitworth University are challenging to the point that students are kept engaged, but not so hard to make them feel helpless.”\n\n• “The university simply provides a very supportive community with a positive attitude.”\n\n• “There is an emphasis on Christianity in the classroom and among professors as well.”\n\n• “The faculty is wonderful, personable, and extremely knowledgeable. Teachers are seemingly always available for extra help and will work independently to create meaningful relationships that prove to last beyond college.”\n\nWhitworth was also recently recognized as a 2023 Best College in America by Money magazine. Each year, Money analyzes data points at more than 2,400 colleges and universities in the country. Its methodology focuses on three categories: quality of education (30 percent), affordability (40 percent), and outcomes (30 percent), which include earnings after college. Seven hundred thirty-six colleges made the list this year.\n\nAbout Whitworth University:\n\nLocated in Spokane, Wash., Whitworth is a private liberal arts university affiliated with the Presbyterian church. The university, which has an enrollment of about 2,500 students, offers more than 100 undergraduate and graduate degree programs.\n\nContacts:"
