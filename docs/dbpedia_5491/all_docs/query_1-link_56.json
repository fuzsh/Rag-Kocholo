        "text": "The WSU Press is teaming up with Whitworth University to launch a new publishing imprint dedicated to bringing more visibility to the scholarship of the region.\n\nPines Press – a first-of-its-kind collaboration giving faculty at the Spokane-area private college a new avenue to have their academic works put to print – was conceived by WSU Press Editor-in-Chief Linda Bathgate and Amanda Clark, Whitworth’s dean of the library and special programs.\n\nAfter serving on her college’s research and faculty development committee, Clark noticed academic projects undertaken during sabbaticals or with support from university grants were often unfinished.\n\n“I realized there must be so many manuscripts sitting in dusty bottom drawers of desks, and one reason for that is because no one teaches faculty how to publish,” Clark said.\n\nKnowing how to turn academic projects into published works is especially vital for younger faculty in the humanities, who need publications in order to receive tenure and promotions. And before Pines Press, Whitworth faculty had to go to large academic presses or face the daunting process of pitching to for-profit presses to get their works printed.\n\n“Because we are an academic press, we’re keenly focused on the content and its quality while considering the value its publication will bring to the region and its stakeholders,” Bathgate said. “Having a publisher affiliated with your university helps the institution share its scholarship and promote the kinds of work it believes in or feels is important to spread to the community.”\n\nThe opportunity to name a new print imprint doesn’t come along often, and Clark was reluctant to name it simply after the college. Instead, she and her colleagues came up with Pines Press, which draws inspiration from the campus’ iconic Ponderosa Pines. The imprint’s logo of a pinecone flanked by book pages is symbolic of the seeds of learning that Bathgate and Clark hope germinate as a result of their press’ publications.\n\nPines Press is expected to publish its first project early next year."
