        "text": "In December 2021, Students for Life of America’s (SFLA) Demetree Institute for Pro-Life Advancement released its Christian Schools Project, investigating all 784 Christian schools across the country to identify any ties these Christian institutions have to the nation’s largest abortion vendor, Planned Parenthood.\n\nClick here to read the full research findings.\n\nAnother goal of the Christian Schools Project was to encourage and identify schools which also support pregnant and parenting students on campus. SFLA is proud to introduce the Christian Schools Standing with You Scholarship Competition where we pick three Christian schools that are doing outstanding work for women on campus.\n\nIt’s time to highlight the amazing pro-life efforts of students who attend Christian colleges and universities across America who are setting the standard for great Christian schools. These groups have a passion for helping pregnant and parenting students on their Christian campus, and SFLA wants to award them for their efforts—with your help! By evaluating each school’s friendliness and support for parenting students on campus, we have narrowed it down to our top ten school groups, and now it’s up to you to help us choose the winner.\n\nCheck out one of the schools that made it to the top ten below: Whitworth University in Washington\n\nWhitworth University is one of ten student groups competing to be in the top three of all Christian Schools that will earn a scholarship for pregnant and parenting students on campus and an award for their group activities for the upcoming year.\n\nWhitworth University, a Presbyterian institution, was rated an “A” during the Christian Schools Project for not promoting Planned Parenthood to their students. The SFLA group at Whitworth University is currently working with SFLA’s Standing With You initiative to help their campus establish pregnant and parenting student parking on campus as needed. They have also started advertising lactation rooms on campus and have participated in pro-life activities throughout the year.\n\nHere are some accomplishments of the Whitworth University group:\n\nThe group has posted fliers for the local pregnancy resource center in the Whitworth University medical center and chapel.\n\nThey also hosted the See Me Now Tour on campus to foster conversations about abortion with the student body.\n\nThe group annually participates in National Pro-Life Chalk Day and attends the National Pro-Life March in Washington D.C.\n\nThey also host trainings with the local pregnancy resource center on campus.\n\nIn the long term, they are planning to set up a scholarship fund for pregnant and parenting students.\n\nYou can vote for this school to receive a $1,500 scholarship for a pregnant or parenting student on their campus and up to $500 to help their group activities for the upcoming year. Click HERE to vote for Whitworth University (Wash)!\n\nAnd that’s not all, either—each of these three groups will also get to send two representatives to the National Leaders Collective. This is SFLA’s weekend of pro-life activism training for student leaders within our movement. At the National Leaders Collective, these two representatives will receive their award.\n\nCAST YOUR VOTE BELOW!"
