        "text": "Do I need to have a bachelor's degree to participate?\n\nParticipants are not required to have an undergraduate degree in order to enroll in the Institute of Leadership; however, current Whitworth undergraduate students are not eligible. Professional business experience is required. If you decide to matriculate into a graduate program, a bachelor's degree would be required, but the graduate-level credits earned from the Institute of Leadership would apply toward that program.\n\nDo I need to have an affiliation with Whitworth to apply?\n\nNo prior Whitworth affiliation is required to participate in the Institute of Leadership, including current enrollment in a degree program or alumni status. The Institute of Leadership is open to all members of the community.\n\nDo I need to practice Christianity in order to participate?\n\nNo. Whitworth University is an inclusive Christian liberal arts institution, inviting all members of the community to ask questions of faith and explore different points of view, no matter their background."
