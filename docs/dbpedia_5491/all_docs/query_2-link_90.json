        "text": "http://www.whitworth.edu/admissions\n\nOur primary goal in the admissions process is to identify students who demonstrate the academic promise and personal traits to succeed at Whitworth University. A college preparatory curriculum is recommended for entrance, though no specific classes are required. The relative strength of each student’s academic performance is strongly considered in admissions decisions.\n\nWhitworth admits students without regard to age, race, color, religion, national origin, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation or disability.\n\nFirst-Year Application Process\n\nStudents entering college directly from high school, including those participating in Running Start programs, are considered first-year students and should follow the procedures in this section.\n\nApplication\n\nYou may apply online at www.whitworth.edu/apply or through the Common Application at commonapp.org. No fee is required.\n\nTranscript\n\nWe require a high school transcript that shows courses taken, grades earned and your current cumulative grade-point average. Whitworth weights the GPA of honors, AP, IB and Cambridge classes for students whose high schools do not provide a weighted GPA.\n\nOptional ACT/SAT/CLT Exams\n\nWhitworth is a test-optional school, and applicants may choose to apply without standardized test scores. For students who would like their test scores reviewed in the application process, we will consider the applicant's SAT, ACT or CLT superscore (composite of the highest subscore of each section of the test ­– potentially from multiple test dates). There is no preference for one test over another.\n\nOptional Academic Recommendation\n\nAcademic recommendation(s) are accepted but not required for admission. Students may request that a teacher or counselor submit a recommendation letter to admissions@whitworth.edu.\n\nTransfer Application Process\n\nStudents who have completed a full term of coursework at an accredited college or university after graduating from high school should apply with the Whitworth Transfer Application (www.whitworth.edu/apply) or Common Application for Transfer (apply.transfer.commonapp.org). No application fee is required.\n\nTransfer applicants should submit transcripts from all colleges attended. Academic recommendation(s) are accepted but not required. Students may request that a professor or advisor submit a recommendation letter to admissions@whitworth.edu. In some situations, we may contact applicants for transfer admission and request a high school transcript.\n\nInternational Student Application Process\n\nQualified students who are not citizens or permanent residents of the United States are encouraged to apply for admission. International students should complete either the Freshman Common Application (commonapp.org), Transfer Common Application (apply.transfer.commonapp.org) or the Whitworth Application (www.whitworth.edu/apply). No application fee is required. Students should include with their application transcripts in the original language and certified English translations of transcripts. Academic recommendation(s) are accepted but not required for international student admission.\n\nWhitworth requires standardized test scores to prove English fluency. We are test flexible, and students may submit official results from any one of the following tests: ACT, SAT, IB SL or HL exams, O Level exams, TOEFL or IELTS. Minimum scores or grades are as follows: SAT reading/writing subscore of 500; ACT English 24; IB SL English grade of 5; IB HL English grade of 4; O Level English B or higher; ibTOEFL 79; IELTS 6.5; PTE 56; or Duolingo English Test score of 110.\n\nUpon admission to Whitworth, international students are required to provide certification of finances and an official bank statement showing funds available, no more than three months old. For more information, please visit www.whitworth.edu/international-admissions.\n\nAdult Degree Programs/Continuing Studies\n\nSee Adult Degree Programs.\n\nEvaluation and Acceptance\n\nEach application is carefully and holistically reviewed before a prospective student is granted admission to the university. Grade-point average, course rigor, test scores (if provided), teacher/counselor recommendations (if provided), quality of writing sample (if provided), extracurricular participation and leadership are all considered in the decision process.\n\nFirst-Year Application Deadlines\n\nStudents interested in Whitworth University are encouraged to apply for early action admission (nonbinding). There are two early action deadline dates. Early Action I is Nov. 15 and Early Action II is Jan. 15. Students who submit all documents prior to either one of the early action deadlines will be notified of Whitworth’s admissions decision within three weeks. The priority deadline for regular admission is March 1.\n\nTransfer Application Deadlines\n\nTransfer students interested in Whitworth University are encouraged to apply for early action admission (nonbinding). There are two early action deadline dates. Early Action I is Jan. 15 and Early Action II is March 1. Transfer applicants who submit all documents prior to either one of the early action deadlines will be notified of Whitworth’s admissions decision within three weeks. The priority deadline for regular transfer admission is July 1.\n\nEnrollment Deposit\n\nTo accept Whitworth’s offer of admission, please submit your enrollment deposit at www.whitworth.edu/deposit. This deposit will hold your place in the new class, and students who deposit earlier may receive priority consideration for housing and class registration.\n\nAll enrolling first-year students are required to submit a final official high school transcript to the admissions office upon completion of high school. Official transcripts are also required for coursework completed at any college or university.\n\nReturning Whitworth Students\n\nStudents applying to return to Whitworth after withdrawing from the university may do so online at www.whitworth.edu/apply. Submit to the admissions office official college transcripts from each college attended during your absence from Whitworth. Students with an academic restriction (probation or suspension) should contact the Whitworth Academic Affairs Office (509.777.3203), and students with financial holds on their accounts should contact Whitworth Student Accounting Services (509.777.3209).\n\nAlternative Credit\n\nA maximum of 32 alternative semester credits (48 quarter credits) may be counted toward graduation. Alternative credit includes Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB) degree courses, College Level Examination Program (CLEP) credit, and DANTES credit, based on completion of advanced work, portfolios, and credit for military service and schools. Alternative course credit is calculated as part of the transfer-credit limit of 94. Contact the registrar’s office for more information.\n\nRunning Start Policy\n\nDual enrollment credits are college credits that have been earned prior to graduation from high school, on the campus of either a college or a high school (in partnership with a sponsoring college or university). Running Start is an example of a dual enrollment program, though similar programs have different names in many states. High school students with dual enrollment credits are considered first-year students as long as they attempt no university-level coursework after high school graduation. Students with dual enrollment credits must meet first-year application deadlines and Whitworth's first-year admissions requirements, and qualified students will be eligible to receive a first-year University Scholarship. Dual enrollment and Running Start credits are accepted as transfer credits based on receipt of official academic transcripts from the college attended or the college sponsoring the course. Courses in which a student has received a grade lower than \"C,\" vocational/technical courses, non-college-level courses and incomplete courses are not transferable. A maximum of 64 semester credits (96 quarter credits) may be transferred from dual enrollment credits.\n\nDeferred Admission\n\nStudents may apply for admission during any academic year, and, if admitted, may defer their admission and attendance at Whitworth for up to two semesters. If students delay longer than the two semesters, they must submit a new application for admission. Deferment is granted on a case-by-case basis. If you attend another institution and earn college credit during your deferment period, you must reapply to Whitworth with the Whitworth Transfer Application or the Common Application.\n\nAdmission of Part-Time Students\n\nStudents enrolled for fewer than 12 semester credits (undergraduate) or six semester credits (graduate) are considered part time. The part-time-student classification can be on a credit or audit basis. Students seeking a graduate degree or planning to complete an undergraduate degree on a part-time basis (usually through courses taken in the evening) should contact the Whitworth Graduate & Continuing Studies Office for information on degree options and admission procedures. Part-time undergraduate students not seeking a degree from Whitworth may not be required to complete the formal admission process; please contact the registrar’s office to be directed to the appropriate department.\n\nCampus Visits"
