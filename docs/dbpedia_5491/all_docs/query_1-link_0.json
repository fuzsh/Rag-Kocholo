        "text": "http://www.whitworth.edu/financial-policies\n\nWhitworth University is an independent institution, and, like most such institutions, it receives minimal support from public funds. Each student is charged tuition and fees that cover approximately three-fourths of what it costs the university to provide its services. The balance of these costs is met by income from the endowment and by gifts from trustees, alumni and other friends of the university. All details for payment of current charges must be finalized and a financial agreement signed before students begin classes. Payment in full is due at the beginning of each semester. Students and their parents may also choose to use the monthly payment option that spreads payments over a five-month period each semester (July-November for fall, January-May for spring).\n\nCosts for the 2024-25 Academic Year\n\nCosts Item Cost Tuition $51,500 Housing and Food $14,300 Associated Student Body Fee $300 Campus Facility & Technology Fee $635 Student Mandatory Accident Insurance $130 Health & Wellness Fee $315 Total $67,180\n\nA full-time academic course load is 12 to 16 semester credits in the fall and spring semesters. Academic credits over 16 will be considered overload and subject to additional tuition charges. Students will have one week after the start of the term to drop overload credits for a 100% refund. All matriculated day students will be charged a flat $385 fee for credits taken in Jan Term for 1-5 maximum credits.\n\nHousing and food charges do not cover regular university vacation periods in the fall break, Christmas Break and Spring Break where additional housing charges are applied. In addition, only students registered for on-campus classes may utilize housing and food during Jan Term. The above rate provides for a double room and 21 meals per week. Several other meals-per-term plans are available. Students in private rooms pay approximately 36 percent additional room rent.\n\nThrough our campus Health Services, the Health and Wellness Fee helps cover most healthcare visit costs, including basic labs and x-rays. Federal law requires all domestic full-time day students carry health insurance. As there are many low cost options available under the Affordable Care Act, Whitworth does not offer health insurance. Students who need health insurance should visit HealthCare.gov and/or Washington HealthPlanFinder. All international students, regardless of academic program, are required to participate in the university’s international student health insurance plan. All international students, undergraduate and graduate, must have insurance to meet visa requirements.\n\nAdditional expenses for books, supplies, personal items and transportation will vary with each student and are a necessary consideration when planning total costs. Since financial aid disbursements will arrive after the term has begun, they should not be included in a student's plan for initial expenses.\n\nSince fees are published several months in advance of the academic year, the Whitworth University Board of Trustees reserves the right to change this fee structure as necessary from year to year.\n\nMiscellaneous Costs (2024-25)\n\nPart-Time Day School\n\nFor students enrolling in less than a full-time academic load, tuition is charged by semester credit.\n\nMisc. Costs Item Cost Per semester credit $2,146\n\nExcess Semester Credits\n\nFor semester credits in excess of 16 for fall and spring semesters\n\nMisc. Costs Item Cost Per semester credit $1,390\n\nAudit Fee\n\nMisc. Costs Item Cost Per semester credit $1,200\n\nSchool of Continuing Studies Programs\n\nMisc. Costs Item Cost Evening traditional semester courses, per semester credit $575 Audit only, per semester credit (permission required) $345 Accelerated-format courses, per semester credit (includes books and course materials; not available for audit) $575\n\nGraduate program rates are included in each program's bulletins.\n\nSpecial Courses/Fees\n\nSeveral courses (in art, physical education and music, among others) carry special fees to cover extra costs. These classes and their fees are listed in the course schedule for each semester.\n\nGraduation fee\n\nAll students will be charged a mandatory graduation fee. The fee covers administrative costs related to graduating the student.\n\nMisc. Costs Item Cost Matriculated day $125 Master of Business Administration $125 Master of Arts in Theology $125 Continuing Studies and Graduate Studies in Education - see advisor\n\nTranscript Fees\n\nOfficial: $13\n\nUnofficial: Free\n\nUnofficial transcripts may only be obtained in Self-Service or in person with photo ID in the Whitworth Registrar's Office.\n\nTranscripts and diplomas are released only when financial accounts are current and all holds on a student's record have been removed.\n\nMiscellaneous Fees\n\nA more detailed list of miscellaneous fees is available from the Whitworth Student Financial Services Office. All are subject to change without notice.\n\nFees for off-campus and international-study programs vary according to the program. For additional information, check with the Whitworth Off-Campus Programs Office.\n\nPlease note: Class fees are subject to change without notice.\n\nTuition and Fees Refund Policy\n\nAll refunds must be claimed through proper application to the Whitworth Student Financial Services Office. Students must secure class-drop and withdrawal forms from the registrar’s office. The refund/withdrawal date will be established by the form’s receipt date, recorded by the registrar’s office.\n\nThe published refund schedule is available in the student financial services office. Withdrawal and refund schedules for graduate and nontraditional undergraduate degree programs are available in the student financial services office.\n\nA student who officially drops or withdraws from classes during the course of the term is eligible for an adjustment of charges as follows:\n\nRefunds Withdrawal/Drop Refund Applicable to First & Second week 100 percent Tuition and fees, room and board Third week 75 percent Tuition, no fees, room and board Fourth week 50 percent Tuition, no fees, room and board Fifth week 25 percent Tuition, no fees, room and board Sixth week 0 percent\n\nPlease contact student financial services if you need to discuss how to appeal Whitworth financial policies.\n\nAppeal of Financial Policy\n\nStudents who feel their charges were not applied correctly can complete an appeal and a committee will review for potential adjustments.\n\nEmergency Event Refund Policy\n\nThe university’s first priority is to ensure its students’ safety, health and well-being. In the event students are required to vacate their residence hall due to a public-health mandate (or similar) after the fourth week of a semester, a prorated credit or refund for the unused portion of housing and food will be issued, up to a maximum of 50 percent of the amount paid by the student. (The university incurs contractual obligations for the full academic year that limit the amount of credits or refunds it is able to provide.) If the event takes place within the first four weeks of the semester, housing and food refunds will follow the published schedule of refunds for the academic year, which can be found at www.whitworth.edu. Students receiving financial aid that may have been based, in part, on housing and food costs should refer to the financial aid refund policy to determine whether they would be obligated to return any financial aid funds. Tuition and fees refunds will follow the normal refund schedule tied to the number of weeks of the semester, also published on the same website.\n\nMontessori Programs Located in Oregon\n\nMaster of education in Montessori educational programs delivered to students residing in Oregon are subject to Oregon state refund policies. After classes begin for a term, a student who withdraws from a course is eligible for a partial refund through the middle week of the term. Refunds shall be based on unused instructional time and shall be prorated on a weekly basis for the semester.\n\nWithdrawal from Whitworth University\n\nIn order to avoid additional charges to their account, a student must notify the registrar’s office regarding withdrawal or cancellation of enrollment from Whitworth University before the beginning of the term. All withdrawals and cancellations made after the beginning of the term must follow the withdrawal process in the registrar’s office. Refund calculations will be made as outlined above."
