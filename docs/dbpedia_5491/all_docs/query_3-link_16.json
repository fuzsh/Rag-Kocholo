        "text": "Seeley G. Mudd Chapel\n\nChapel & Hosanna\n\nChapel meets Tuesdays and Thursdays from 11-11:30 a.m. in the Seeley G. Mudd Chapel and is livestreamed on YouTube on the Whitworth Campus Ministries channel. Hosanna meets at 9:45 p.m. on Tuesdays in the chapel.\n\nA Message About Worship at Whitworth\n\nWelcome to the campus ministry webpage at Whitworth University. Campus ministry at Whitworth exists to help everyone in the Whitworth community have opportunities to know and follow Jesus more in their time at Whitworth. We believe that no matter how extensive one's background is with the Christian faith, we all have the same foundational spiritual need, namely to know, understand, and experience the truth and reality of Jesus. When that happens, God draws us to himself, transforms us, brings new life in us, and invites us to participate in his redeeming work in the world by the Spirit.\n\nAt Whitworth, we believe that people grow in their relationship with God primarily through human relationships, worship and service. We help foster relationships through our Ministry in the Halls Program and our Wednesday night Awake ministry (8 p.m., HUB MPR). We provide campus-wide worship opportunities through our weekly Tuesday and Thursday Chapel Community Worship services (11-11:30 a.m., livestream and in the chapel) and Tuesday night Hosanna worship experience (9:45 p.m., in the chapel). Our worship aligns with our worship principles as we acknowledge that God is God and we are not. We provide service opportunities through a variety of important student leadership roles as well as encouraging and enabling service to the community both near and far.\n\nWe have a wonderful team of committed staff and student leaders who are committed to providing a welcoming, safe, encouraging and edifying presence as we get to know individual students and come alongside them in their journey. We are a resource as you ask questions about Jesus, Christianity or life in general. If you come to Whitworth or are a part of the Whitworth community, please say hello when you see us around campus or at a campus ministry event. We look forward to meeting you, worshipping God with you and being a part of your journey.\n\nEvery blessing in Christ,"
