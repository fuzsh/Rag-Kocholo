        "text": "Key Takeaways:\n\nUniversity of Washington Seattle Campus is the top affordable college in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nReed College in Portland, OR, ranks as the second-best value college in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nThe rankings are based on academic quality, outcomes, net price, and financial aid, highlighting affordable options in the region.\n\nThe Pacific Northwest is a great place for college students. It is made up of Oregon and Washington and is known for its misty pine forests. With eclectic cities like Portland and Seattle and rocky, wildlife-rich coast, it is one of the most alluring regions in the United States.\n\nHowever, it’s also one of America’s most expensive regions. For those looking to spend four years kayaking in the Pacific, skiing on Mt. Baker, or enjoying all that this lively place has to offer, we’ve researched and put together a list of the 30 most affordable colleges in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nMethodology:\n\nOur editors started by putting together a list of all of the four-year colleges in Oregon and Washington. We included all non-profit public and private institutions. Finally, we consulted College Data for up-to-date, 2019-2020 tuition costs for each college and university on our list.\n\nThe top 30 most affordable schools in the Pacific Northwest are profiled below.\n\n1. Central Washington University\n\nEllensburg, Washington\n\nWebsite\n\nTuition: $7,361 (in-state) or $22,342 (out-of-state)\n\nCentral Washington University is home to approximately 11,500 students. A majority of these students are undergraduates. CWU offers many degrees in the liberal arts, business, education, and the sciences. The university is one of the emerging Hispanic-serving institutions.\n\n2. Eastern Washington University\n\nCheney, Washington\n\nWebsite\n\nTuition: $7,461 (in-state) or $24,957 (out-of-state)\n\nEastern Washington University is in Cheney but has regional locations all around the state. Founded in 1882, it offers more than 100 degree programs. These include 55 grad programs, 10 master’s programs, and seven graduate certificates. Eastern Washington University has placed in the 201 Best Colleges for the Real World three times. Consumers Digest ranked it as one of the “Top 50 Best Value” schools in the country.\n\n3. The Evergreen State College\n\nOlympia, Washington\n\nWebsite\n\nTuition: $7,674 (in-state) or $26,184 (out-of-state)\n\nThe Evergreen State College’s motto is “Let it all hang out” — or Omnia Extares in Latin. It’s not so surprising this public liberal arts college is non-traditional. It was founded in 1967 as an experimental college.\n\nToday, Evergreen is home to approximately 4,000 students. Instead of traditional majors and minors, Evergreen encourages students to study several disciplines by offering only a Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Arts and a Bachelor of Science. Instead of grades, students receive a narrative evaluation of their work.\n\n4. Western Washington University\n\nBellingham, Washington\n\nWebsite\n\nTuition: $8,132 (in-state) or $23,544 (out-of-state)\n\nFounded in 1893, Western Washington University has enjoyed a long history (and six different names!). Today, it’s one of Washington’s six public universities. It acts as the educational home to approximately 15,000 students. The university offers many undergraduate degree programs in the different colleges:\n\nbusiness and economics\n\nfine and performing arts\n\nthe humanities, and social sciences\n\nsciences and engineering\n\nThe school also offers a variety of master’s degree programs. In fact, Western Washington University was ranked by U.S. News & World Report as the best school in the Pacific Northwest for master’s degree programs. Uniquely, Western Washington University also ranks as one of the top mid-sized colleges for Peace Corps volunteers.\n\n5. Eastern Oregon University\n\nLa Grande, Oregon\n\nWebsite\n\nTuition: $8,362 (in-state) or $19,682 (out-of-state)\n\nFounded in 1929, Eastern Oregon University is one of seven four-year public schools in the state. Thanks in part to its location in the heart of the Blue Mountain range, the university is well known for its academic programs associated with the outdoors. These include a one-of-a-kind outdoor leadership program, agricultural science, and military science, to name but a few.\n\nApproximately 3,700 students are currently enrolled at Eastern Oregon University, about 3,500 of whom are undergraduates.\n\n6. Portland State University\n\nPortland, Oregon\n\nWebsite\n\nTuition: $9,105 (in-state) or $27,060 (out-of-state)\n\nLocated in downtown Portland’s University District, Portland State University is Oregon’s only public university to be located in a major city.\n\nThe university’s approximately 28,000 students have a whopping 240 undergraduate and postgraduate degree programs from which to choose, including those in business administration, education, social work, public affairs, computer science, and liberal arts, among others.\n\nPortland State University has been named a “College With a Conscience” by The Princeton Review and has also been included among the publication’s rankings of the “Best in the West” and the Top 100 MBAs.\n\n7. Western Oregon University\n\nMonmouth, Oregon\n\nWebsite\n\nTuition: $9,540 (in-state) or $26,415 (out-of-state)\n\nLocated in the town of Monmouth, Western Oregon University is home to approximately 6,000 students, about 4,600 of whom are undergraduates. A variety of bachelor’s degrees are available, while master’s programs are offered in education, criminal justice, music, rehabilitation counseling, and management and information systems.\n\nWestern Oregon University has been ranked by U.S. News & World Report as the 77th best university in the West.\n\n8. Southern Oregon University\n\nAshland, Oregon\n\nWebsite\n\nTuition: $9,615 (in-state) or $25,545 (out-of-state)\n\nStudents interested in a public liberal arts college in the Pacific Northwest would do well to look into Southern Oregon University. Founded in 1926, this university offers degree programs in a variety of subjects, including business, criminology, natural and environmental science, theater arts, and even Shakespearean studies.\n\nThe university has been ranked by U.S. News & World Report as one of the top 100 universities in the West.\n\n9. Oregon State University\n\nCorvallis, Oregon\n\nWebsite\n\nTuition: $11,166 (in-state) or $30,141 (out-of-state)\n\nStudents looking for a large state school would do well to consider Oregon State University (OSU). With a total student population of nearly 31,000, OSU offers more than 200 undergraduate degree programs. OSU is considered a “selective” school, and as such, is no stranger to the national and international rankings systems.\n\nU.S. News & World Report lists Oregon State as the 143rd best college in the nation, but the 71st best public university. Meanwhile, the Times, Forbes, and the Academic Ranking of World Universities also consider OSU to be one of the best universities in the country.\n\n10.
