        "text": "http://www.whitworth.edu/evening\n\nWhitworth School of Continuing Studies provides higher education opportunities for adult students in an environment that cultivates student success, critical reflection and professional development. We uphold Whitworth’s mission of an education of mind and heart by treating all students with dignity; by providing avenues for spiritual, as well as intellectual, rigor; and by serving each individual with compassion and integrity. Our evening, accelerated-format courses are ideal for students with work and family obligations.\n\nOur Mission: We provide lifelong learning opportunities so that curious, passionate and motivated adults can achieve their wildest dreams.\n\nOur Vision: We envision education for adults that is responsive, relational and reachable.\n\nOur Values: We embody and promote the values of transformation, relationship, excellence and care.\n\nSchool of Continuing Studies Admissions\n\nThe Whitworth School of Continuing Studies is designed for adult learners (ages 23 and above) who, because of work and family obligations, need to attend the university on a schedule that fits their busy lives. Applicants to the School of Continuing Studies will:\n\nSubmit an online application that includes a personal essay, reference forms and a résumé (required only for teacher certification programs); an additional writing sample may be requested based on prior academic and/or professional experience.\n\nSubmit official transcripts from previously attended colleges and/or universities to the School of Continuing Studies Office. If no prior college/university credit has been earned, high school transcripts or GED will be required.\n\nMeet with an academic advisor.\n\nDue to the expectation that students contribute knowledge gained in the work environment to the collaborative learning taking place in class, each applicant to the School of Continuing Studies under the age of 23 must also have:\n\nFamily or work responsibilities that would prevent her/him from attending a traditional daytime university program\n\nA two-year transfer degree, or substantial previous college experience, preferably with a 2.75 or higher GPA\n\nThree years of full-time employment history, documented by submission of a résumé\n\nPrograms across the School of Continuing Studies may have additional admissions requirements. These are outlined in their subsequent sections of the catalog.\n\nAdmission Evaluation and Acceptance\n\nEach application is carefully reviewed before the admissions committee grants a prospective student admission to the university. The following criteria may be considered in the admission-decision process: transfer-credit grade-point average, academic advisor meeting, availability of appropriate academic program(s), prior coursework and pattern of coursework completion, professional and academic references, and demonstration of college-level writing competency. Applicants will receive notification of their admission from the School of Continuing Studies.\n\nApplicants not meeting the minimum GPA or other admission requirements may be offered provisional admission and may be required to complete certain classes specified by the academic advisor.\n\nBachelor's Degree Requirements\n\nCompletion of Whitworth shared curriculum requirements\n\nCompletion of 36 semester credits of upper-division courses (numbered 300 or above)\n\nCompletion of a writing-intensive “W” course in the major\n\nCompletion of an approved major (with a cumulative grade-point average of 2.0 or higher)\n\nCompletion of at least 32 semester credits in a degree program at Whitworth\n\nCompletion of 126 total semester credits, including those transferred from other institutions.\n\nA cumulative grade-point average of 2.0 in all Whitworth courses\n\nCompletion of 32 of last 40 credits for the degree at Whitworth\n\nCompletion of all degree requirements within six years of matriculation\n\nStudents must declare their intent to graduate by completing an application for graduation during their senior year (or the year prior to their completion of all degree requirements) by the application deadline set by the registrar's office. To participate in commencement, students must complete all degree requirements by the end of that year's summer term.\n\nWhitworth Policies\n\nFor additional Whitworth policies, please see the section on Academic Information.\n\nShared Curriculum Requirements\n\nStudents enrolled in the School of Continuing Studies must complete the university's shared curriculum requirements as specified in the Shared Curriculum Requirements section of the academic catalog. The School of Continuing Studies has modified requirements, different than the traditional undergraduate programs.\n\nCourse Enrollment Limits for Continuing Studies Degree Programs\n\nA student may choose to enroll in up to three credits of non-accelerated evening courses each semester (fall, spring and summer) in addition to their accelerated-format schedule. Tuition for each course will be charged at the current applicable tuition rate. Continuing studies students may not enroll in more than 16 credits during each continuing studies accelerated-format term, including regular-semester course registrations that overlap into a portion of any accelerated-format term. An exception to the 16-credit limit is only allowed with registrar and advisor approval.\n\nContinuing Studies Change in Program\n\nStudents moving from a continuing studies program to a traditional day program must complete the day program’s requirements for shared curriculum. Continuing studies students who have completed 90 credits or more in their program may not transfer to a traditional day-program major unless this transfer is approved by the dean of the School of Continuing Studies, the academic department in which the major is housed, and the associate provost of academic affairs. Students attending Whitworth as matriculated-day students who want to cease attending during the day, change their major and enroll in a continuing studies program must not have attended Whitworth for at least one full calendar year prior to applying to the School of Continuing Studies. In addition, they must apply and be accepted for admission to the School of Continuing Studies, major in a program offered by the School of Continuing Studies, and fulfill all continuing studies shared curriculum requirements.\n\nContinuing Studies Academic Warning\n\nA student receives an academic warning when, during any fall, spring or summer semester, their semester GPA falls below 2.0 while the cumulative grade-point average is 2.0 or above.\n\nContinuing Studies Academic Probation\n\nStudents are placed on academic probation at the end of any semester in which their semester cumulative grade-point average falls below 2.0 and they are currently on academic warning, or both their semester and cumulative GPAs are below a 2.0. Students remain on probation until their cumulative GPA reaches the minimum 2.0 standard.\n\nContinuing Studies Academic Suspension\n\nStudents may face academic suspension at the end of any semester or term in which their semester GPA falls below 1.0, or if, after being placed on probation, they fail to earn at least a 2.0 GPA for the succeeding semester or term. Academic suspension will be noted on the transcript.\n\nContinuing Studies Appeal Process\n\nIf there are mitigating reasons for unsatisfactory progress that results in suspension, students may appeal in writing to the Educational Review Board through the Whitworth Academic Affairs Office. Reinstatement after any semester or sequence on suspension is dependent upon written application to the Educational Review Board through the academic affairs office. If the student is reinstated, a notation of reinstatement will be noted on the transcript. Students who are receiving financial aid should refer to satisfactory academic progress policies and appeals processes.\n\nTransfer of Community College Applied Associate Degrees (A.A.S. or other)\n\nThis program allows a student to complete an applied associate degree at a regionally accredited institution and subsequently enroll at Whitworth for completion of a bachelor of arts degree in the School of Continuing Studies. Total credits needed (shared curriculum, major, upper-division and electives) at Whitworth will vary depending on credits transferred.\n\nApplied Associate Degree Credits Accepted by Whitworth\n\nWhitworth will accept credit from applied associate (A.A.S. or other) or technical degrees meeting the following criteria:\n\nEarned at a regionally accredited institution\n\nEarned within the last 10 years (transcripts for applied associate degrees older than 10 years will be evaluated on a course-by-course basis and/or the application will be assessed by the School of Continuing Studies admissions committee on the applicant's current use of the degree in the applicant's profession)\n\nIncludes at least 90 quarter or 60 semester credits\n\nStudent chooses to apply that credit toward a bachelor's degree offered through the School of Continuing Studies"
