        "text": "üåü Exciting Insights from the Rennie Center's \"Rethinking Education: Condition of Education\" Event üåü We want to thank the Rennie Center for yesterday‚Äôs event, celebrating the release of their 2024 Condition of Education report, entitled ‚ÄúRethinking Education: Reimagining when, where, and how learning happens.‚Äù We enjoyed hearing about the Condition of Education initiative, which serves as a cornerstone in developing a coherent vision for public education. It aims to guide efforts in putting every child on a path to success in college, careers, and life. This year's series spotlighted broader patterns in Massachusetts‚Äô public schools, providing research-backed recommendations for action in key areas. A significant focus was on equitable outcomes for all students. The event featured a comprehensive Data Dashboard, showcasing state-level indicators of school performance, illuminating both areas of success and those needing improvement, from early learning to workforce development. The Action Guide with research-informed recommendations for statewide actions, including policies and best practices to bridge performance gaps and foster broad improvements in student outcomes, was also a highlight. We left yesterday's Rennie Center event feeling incredibly energized! The \"Condition of Education\" discussion was not only enlightening but also invigorating. It was fantastic to network with colleagues, share ideas, and feel united in our goal of reshaping education in Massachusetts for the better. Join us in this journey towards rethinking and reshaping education in Massachusetts. Together, we can create a brighter future for our children and communities! #RethinkingEducation #ConditionOfEducation #MassachusettsEducation #EducationForAll üìòüí°\n\nJoin us this #CommunityCollegeMonth as we embark on a journey to reimagine the future of postsecondary education. Marty J. Alvarado our VP of Postsecondary and former leader in the California community college system, knows firsthand the transformative potential of these institutions. But it's time to move beyond mere reform and embrace true transformation. ‚ÄúRather than proposing yet another silver bullet solution that risks overpromising and underdelivering, JFF will pioneer a different model.‚Äù Read our latest blog to discover how we're pioneering new approaches, from agile learning modalities to AI-driven strategies for the future of education workforce. Let's dismantle outdated paradigms and rebuild a system that empowers all learners and institutions to thrive in an ever-changing world >> https://lnkd.in/dC4tVBwg #TransformWorkandLearning #ReimagineEducation #FutureofWork #InnovationInLearning\n\nThis piece in the The Chronicle of Higher Education highlights the challenges facing #highereducation when adapting to the ever-evolving landscape. During the altMBA (shout out to cohort 7 Ravens!), we learned to lean into constraints. \"What used to be seen as guardrails and hurdles, becomes the edges that push our creativity forward. Everything has a cost. None of us have unlimited resources. That's okay. Accepting it and learning to work with those limitations, helps us see which ones we can change, and which we need to embrace to help make our goals real, tangible, and possible.\" It's clear that #highered is at a critical juncture where the old ways of doing things no longer serve our students, faculty, institutions or community. But how can #higheredleaders usher in a new era of innovation and progress? Here are some thoughts on NON-INTUITIVE ways to embrace change in higher ed: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Foster Intrapreneurship: Encourage faculty and staff to think like entrepreneurs within the institution. This means empowering them to take calculated risks, experiment, and create solutions from within. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Diverse Perspectives: Actively seek out and value diverse perspectives. Different viewpoints can lead to innovative ideas that can reshape higher education for the better. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Fail Forward: Promote a culture where failure is seen as a stepping stone to success. Embrace the concept of \"failing forward\" and use setbacks as opportunities for growth. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration: Encourage collaboration between traditionally separate academic disciplines. Some of the most groundbreaking ideas emerge at the intersection of diverse fields. 5Ô∏è‚É£ Leverage Technology Thoughtfully: Embrace technology not as a replacement for traditional education but as a tool to enhance the learning experience and expand access. Change is not just about adopting new technologies or curricula; it's about transforming our mindset and culture. We must become change leaders who inspire, motivate, and guide our institutions toward a brighter future. Let's start a conversation! Let's connect and develop other non-intuitive strategies to help higher ed institutions thrive in these changing times? Together, we can shape the future of education! #HigherEducation #Innovation #ChangeLeadership #FutureOfLearning\n\nThis is SO GOOD. Ian Symmonds lays out the problems with the independent school model clearly and inspires ways to think differently. To survive, schools need to take the bull by the horns and put a stake in the ground on their mission, values, and point of view. They need to offer programs that students simply cannot get elsewhere. They need to go WAY out of the box to innovate on program, budgeting, and human resource allocation. Creativity wins here. All the research in the world will not solve for these challenges. I welcome your thoughts about this! https://lnkd.in/gdg5XPcT\n\nTo those in my network who are part of intentional \"talent development\" work in the education sector - it's exciting to see states who have adopted (or are adopting) legislation aligned (or at least in support of) Jobs for the Future (JFF)'s work on \"The Big Blur\". https://lnkd.in/e4nAGRu5 Public policy is one of many key implementation drivers to this important work. Wisconsin's \"Education for Employment\" legislation (11/2015) has been a catalyst to a number of key initiatives across the state. But it is certainly a long game and requires purposeful collaboration between many disparate systems and networks. https://lnkd.in/eWcRwAvn. Wisconsin Policy Forum. I was lucky to have been asked to take a leadership role in this transformational initiative alongside Joe Garza and his team at the School District of New Berlin. I am proud of our collective efforts in this space and am happy to see our progress sustained for the benefit of the students they serve. üìå Education for Employment Planning: https://lnkd.in/ekD5waZw üìå College and Career Readiness: https://lnkd.in/eXR-qFAH üìå Dual Enrollment: https://lnkd.in/eR9KXykr. This work can only take root with the support of local school boards who commit to include both College AND Career Readiness in their graduate profile. This puts students at the center of planning for their life after high school so that every learning experience is relevant to the future they envision for themselves: https://lnkd.in/eiigV_d Wisconsin Association of School Boards (WASB), Dan Rossmiller Karin Smith #educationleadership #collegeandcareer Colorado is the most recent state to move in this direction. Thanks for sharing Kyle Hartung. Congrats to the Colorado Department of Education, Colorado Department of Higher Education, and the Colorado Workforce Development Council on the release of their recommendations: https://lnkd.in/eyn-ZiNW #educationleadership #relevance #futureofwork #studentsuccess\n\nOn May 5, 2014, I wrote this opinion piece below. It is sad to say that 10 years later we are still facing the same problem, maybe even more so given the current attacks on DEI programs and offices. With layoff of 100 faculty and staff of DEI, it begging the question of the impact on the Intellectual Entrepreneurship Consortium (IE) at the University of Texas, one of the three most successful programs in addressing the issue of diversity. With the retirement of Rick Cherwitz as well as that of Freeman Hrabowski at the University of the Maryland Baltimore County and that of Isiah Warner at Louusiana State University who is going to step into their shoes. Not that one can not be replaced, but will someone step forward and be provided the necessary resources tocontinue the success of all three, given the current enviroment that exist today. These three individuals were part of a unique group of individuals who not only had the desire, but the WILL and fortitude to make it happen, and I have often said ‚Äúspeak truth to power no matter what the consequences. Below is one of my evergreen piece that discusses the three programs. What is an evergreen piece? It is a puece that refers to any topic with an always-on level of interest or relevance. I have, unfortunately, written over 100 of these."
