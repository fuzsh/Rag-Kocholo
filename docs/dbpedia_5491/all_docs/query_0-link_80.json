Our mission—to create caring places that enrich the lives of seniors—is purposefully specific. By focusing on enhancing the lives of our residents, we’ve achieved unity of purpose both in the day-to-day operations of our staff and in our long-term planning for our communities. Being person-centered isn’t a catchphrase or marketing language to us, it’s core to what we do and it’s why our two communities exist.\n\nOur staff places a premium on active listening and interaction so that we can better get to know and adapt to each resident and their needs. By really connecting with residents and families, we form important bonds that facilitate a more caring environment. And we take pride in knowing that we have served three generations of families, and we look forward to the generations to come."
