Advocates have urged the university to be more affirming of the LGBTQ+ community, inspired in part by a New Yorker profile of a gay Whitworth professor who described what it was like to come out at a university that did not explicitly support LGBTQ+ students and employees.\n\nIn the email to students, official explained that the board had been mulling the decision to add sexual orientation as a protected class for over a year and had consulted a range of stakeholders throughout the process."
