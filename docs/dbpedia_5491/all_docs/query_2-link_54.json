        "text": "My academic advisor just doesn't do their job, have been met with the exact words \"I don't know the answer to that\" with no resources to point me toward, isn't that your whole job? My initial advisor left for maternity leave before my freshman year even started, I was just not told and literally had to apply for a new advisor myself. The professors exist to keep peace, was told this week that I should \"lower my standards and fit in\" when complaining my group was doing nothing for a project, with... Read More evidence. The Wi-Fi on campus is terrible and unreliable unless you're in the library or cafe, the campus has constant loud large trucks going up and down the sidewalks for hours, and personally, in my dorm, it does not get cleaned like it should, this year and last year. Underwhelming, I expected a lot more. The education you get is pretty standard, so you can definitely find a better school. Just my opinion.\n\nRead Less\n\nWhitworth University provided an excellent opportunity for me to not only gain a fulfilling career, but also to identify as a lifelong learner. This Christian University is the perfect place to grow in your faith while having plenty of space to develop understanding of who you are as a person. Professors challenge, guide, and nurture students along while preparing you to become the best in your field. I enjoyed my undergraduate experience so much, I couldn't help but return to pursue a Masters at... Read More this university.\n\nRead Less\n\nThe professors in my field (biology) were amazing. I gained a ton of knowledge and what I think was a very full circle education which has prepared me for whatever next steps I want to take. I will say though, that I absolutely hated the social aspects of Whitworth. This is not true of everyone, but as a non-Christian person with a less than conventional moral outlook, Whitworth was horrible. I encountered a couple teachers who were horribly narrow minded (not in the biology department, thankfully)... Read More and only barely tried to disguise their dislike for my opinions. If you don't want to listen to all the chatter that comes with a \"Christ-centered\" education, you may want to stay away. I stuck it out because the biology program really is great & the scholarships I received were good too. In hindsight though I may have enjoyed my undergraduate career more had I gone somewhere else. Like I said, this was just my experience personally.\n\nRead Less\n\nWhitworth's music program is stellar and prepared me (as much as school can) for life as a musician and for pursuing a master's degree in music. The professors were kind, personable, and took time to get to know their students individually. Whenever I needed help outside of class, they were always more than willing to accommodate me. The music department at Whitworth University is exceptional and home to a lot of talent, both the students and faculty. I felt inspired by my peers in all areas. The... Read More music department is very friendly and feels like a big family, which can be hard to find in other music departments. Competition was always friendly, if nonexistent. I loved my time at Whitworth, especially in the music department, and would recommend the school to anyone.\n\nRead Less"
