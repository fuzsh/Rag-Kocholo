Enter the information you are looking for, and follow the appropriate links. Also, many sites have a site map or a-z index, which may allow you to find items more easily than navigating.\n\nLook for admissions requirements for transfer students or general transfer information. This should give you general requirements such as number of credits required to be considered a transfer student, minimum grade point average (GPA), foreign language requirements, transferability of credits from other colleges, etc. Foreign language requirements are best met at Pierce College, therefore it is important to know those requirements for admission, graduation, and for your major.\n\nLook for equivalency tables or guides for Pierce College. Several universities have these now, including the University of Washington and Bastyr to name a couple.\n\nTransfer policies vary. Some universities in Washington will accept all coursework if you complete a recognized transfer degree (like Pierce College's Associate of Arts); example: The Evergreen State College. Some will accept for the most part, only courses they have deemed transferable, like the University of Washington (which includes almost all of the academic classes at Pierce College).\n\nTransfer students should make contact with an admissions advisor - look for such contact information under \"admissions.\"\n\nLook for programs or majors offered by the college. This is often found under \"academics.\" Transfer students should also make contact with an advisor in the program/department of their major, to make sure they are meeting requirements for admissions to their chosen major or area of concentration.\n\nIf you need assistance with transfer questions, please come see an advisor at Pierce College.\n\nPublic Colleges and Universities in Washington State\n\nCentral Washington University\n\nCWU Transfer\n\nCentral Washington University, Pierce County Center at Ft.
