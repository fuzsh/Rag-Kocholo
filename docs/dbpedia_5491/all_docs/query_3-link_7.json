        "text": "Many applicants for our staff and faculty positions are unfamiliar with this type of statement, and even those who have written one in the past may feel uncertain about what we expect. For more than a century, Whitworth's vision has been the pursuit of intellectual and spiritual development. Through decades of change, this fundamental purpose has remained firmly centered in the person of Jesus Christ. Our understanding of Christ is based on Scripture, the inspired and trustworthy record of God's self-disclosure and our final rule for faith and practice. As a university affiliated with the Presbyterian church, Whitworth stands within the historic Reformed tradition, but we do not expect all employees will have the same denominational affiliation or theological outlook. Christians from Protestant, Catholic and Orthodox traditions, are welcomed at Whitworth and find a place to live out their vocational call. Believing that God is the ultimate source of all truth and is to be loved with \"all our mind and heart,\". Therefore, we equip our diverse student body to honor God, follow Christ and serve humanity, working for redemption and healing in a broken world. We seek qualified candidates who embrace the historic Christian tradition and demonstrate a commitment to integrating their Christian faith into their work at Whitworth.\n\nWatch the video below from our Dean of Spiritual Life Forrest Buckner describing Whitworth's Christian identity.\n\nIn a one-page essay (approximately 300 words), describe your Christian belief and its influence on your life."
