        "text": "Patricia Schechter\n\nProfessor of History\n\nPortland, OR\n\n\"Before working with College Funding Systems, our family was very concerned about selecting and paying for college for our youngest child. With my husband's recent passing, we were very emotional and uncertain about the future. I attended a free College Financial Planning Webinar with College Funding Systems and was immediately impressed with Chris Gray and his team. Chris brings a wealth of tried and true knowledge to the college funding process. When I enrolled in the program, my family suddenly felt like we had a team behind us. We felt much less alone. Our son got immediate access to a personal counselor who helped with his applications. We got regular and consistent advice about exactly what to do and how to set priorities. There are so many unknowns in the college admissions process. After working with College Funding Systems, I KNOW our family was able to put our best foot forward. I am confident that my son will not be penalized because I did not know about this rule or that deadline. Thank you, Chris and team!\"\n\nChad & Sara Slocum\n\nDentist / Dentist\n\nEdmonds, WA\n\n\"Before working with College Funding Systems our family was overwhelmed with everything involved in the daunting college application process. Our son wanted to only apply to private colleges. College Funding Systems helped us to analyze many of the options out there. Chris and his team really helped us to realize the value of merit scholarship money available at many colleges that we had overlooked. It was a huge weight off our shoulders to not have to fill out the FAFSA and CSS and submit them to schools with all of the other things we had to do in the application process. We utilized all of their services.\n\nWe greatly appreciated the realistic financial planning, my son was coached on how to successfully interview at schools, he took the quizzes to help him decide what schools to look at, and had his Common Application essay reviewed and edited. We also recently had the financial aid award evaluation meeting. Chris and College Funding Systems made this stressful period in our life so much easier and it helped so much to have a partner in the process. We will definitely partner with College Funding Systems when our second son is going through the college application process.\n\nStudent Graduates: 2020 – Santa Clara University\"\n\nKen & Jeanie Spiering\n\nTeacher / Teacher\n\nValleyford, WA\n\n\"My wife and I were essentially adrift about how to plan for all the things that needed to be put in place regarding our daughter’s desire to go onto college. She had done the hard work as a great student and athlete in her high school career, and we wanted to help her as best we could. A real stroke of luck happened when I decided to attend an informational meeting about FAFSA and what college hopefuls need to know to embark on their journey in that direction..\n\nAs the presenter, Chris Gray was clear, easy to follow, and truly helped me understand the importance of taking charge of planning for our daughter’s future. I have always been the suspicious one when it comes to the motive behind this kind of presentation like they might be wanting to sell us a timeshare. However, the information was precise, the invitation was to attend further conversations regarding our daughter’s plans, and with my wife joining me at the individual meeting with Chris, we mutually felt like we found a knowledgeable guide to lead the way through the morass..\n\nWe are both teachers, my wife, a private school teacher, and my teaching Art part-time. As such, financing our daughter’s college plan was certainly intimidating, to say the least. To make a financial commitment to help with the planning stages was also difficult, first to trust, and secondly to pay for. Surprisingly, we found Chris’s information and directions so helpful, that it was clear we made a sound financial decision to rely on College Funding Systems..\n\nOur daughter has been very good about maintaining good grades through her diligence to her homework and studies. My wife, as a 2nd Grade teacher, is either sleeping, teaching, grading papers, or working in her classroom, getting it ready for the upcoming season. As a part-time Art teacher and with another career as a professional artist, I couldn’t imagine taking on anything more, especially something as involved as doing Financial Aid Forms, college applications, and all the rest. In the first couple of months, we came to fully trust Chris and College Funding because they did what they promised in timely and complete ways, and kept in touch with us regularly about what was being done and the next steps that we needed to take..\n\nChris provided us a lifeline, and his professionalism and thoroughness have given us as much stability as one can have to help their daughter leave the nest. We paid for and received that professional help. It wasn’t inexpensive, but it certainly has been a bargain! Chris gifted us with peace of mind in doing all this!.\n\nStudent Graduates: 2020 – Grand Canyon University\"\n\nRodney and Cheryl Robert\n\nTeacher / School Secretary\n\nPortland, Oregon\n\n\"Before working with College Funding Systems our family was concerned about putting 2 kids through college. Where would we find the money? How would we finance this? The folks at College Funding Systems provided us with a clear description of systems that would help us use our financial resources to accomplish our goal. By the time our daughter was ready to begin school we had a plan for how we would pay the tuition each semester. Every year when it is time for the FAFSA to be submitted, we have great peace of mind that College Funding Systems is taking care of it. Our regularly scheduled meetings with Stuart has helped reassure us of our continued path as our daughter has progressed through College. Whenever questions arise, we know there will be a friendly, helpful voice on the other end of the line.\n\nNow as our second child is beginning college and our oldest is beginning her final year in college, we are very relieved that we have had the support and guidance of Stuart Grossman and his team.\n\nStudent Graduates: 2016 – Linfield College-McMinnville\n\nStudent Graduates: 2019 – University of Puget Sound\"\n\nJohn and Cindi Patterson\n\nElectrical Engineer / Office Manager\n\nLynnwood, WA\n\n\"I am excited about College Funding Systems. I think that not only will your company help us save money, but you will help us navigate the barrage of information and focus on what the really important tasks are. I am also so pleased that you have advisors to help make sure Alicia is on track with her college applications and doing what she needs to do to maximize her placement (and also qualify for more grant & scholarship money).\n\nThanks, John\n\nStudent Graduates: 2020 – Dublin City University\"\n\nRobert and Corina Vickers\n\nOperations / Medical Field\n\nSnohomish, WA\n\n\"During my son's Junior year of High School, we decided to start the college application and selection process. In the fall of that year we sat in on several presentations from organizations offering to help you navigate the college financial planning and application process. We cut the list of firms we were interested in partnering with down to three and after a short family discussion we chose Grossman College Funding Systems.\n\nStuart and team helped guide us through the application process and provided fantastic tools to help with everything from information management and standardized testing preparations to the FAFSA completion. Grossman College Funding Systems made this time consuming process much simpler. Their pricing is extremely competitive, with installment options available and you have access to them for the 4 years of College. I'd highly recommend Stuart and the team at Grossman College Funding Systems.\n\nRobert Vickers\n\nStudent Graduates: 2019 – Whitworth University\"\n\nJerry and Dawn Goertz\n\nTruck Driver / Hematology Division Supervisor\n\nMedical Lake, Washington\n\n\"We wanted to share and give you an update on what is going on with Megan. Since she graduated as Co-Salutatorian at Medical Lake, she has been working part-time at Zips Restaurant in Airway Heights waiting to start Whitworth this fall.\n\nAll of us have been busy filling out all the required paperwork and forms and she been assigned a dorm. She plans on doing a double major in Biology and Education and hopes to play in the Whitworth Wind Symphony which is planning on going to China this next year. The main thing we wanted to share with you was her updated Financial Aid Award. She has received over $42,000 dollars in scholarships and counting towards school. She did take out a Federal direct unsubsidized loan for $5,500 to help her build credit which we will pay off ASAP.\n\nWe received the first billing from Whitworth and after it was all said and done we only owed a total of $14,638.63 for the first year. This was HUGE, because for the price of going to a state school such as Eastern she can attend a private school like Whitworth.\n\nStudent Graduates: 2019 – Whitworth University\"\n\nTonia Steed\n\nAccount Manager\n\nSeattle, Washington\n\n\"Before working with College Funding Systems, our family was worried that we did not have enough information about the college application process to make truly informed decisions and manage our time wisely.\n\nWithin the first two to three months of getting enrolled in the program, these are the things that improved in our family’s life:\n\nWe felt more in control of the process, and that Chris Gray and our contacts at College Funding Systems were our allies as we took this important journey with our only child.\n\nWe had tools at our disposal to recognize more fully the range of choices that we had, both in terms of financing college and the colleges themselves. Eventually, this allowed us to narrow the choices down to make them more manageable and allow us to make the smartest decision for all of us.\n\nInformative webinars, access to resources, and communication with responsive and knowledgeable individuals at College Funding Systems helped ease stress tremendously. College Funding Systems provided us with excellent comparative tools, timetables for college entrance exams and applications, assistance with the formidable FAFSA and financial planning, generous tips for completing applications, applying for and appealing for scholarship money, assessing value of college programs and offers, and understanding the perspective of college admissions decision-makers. This was invaluable.\n\nI'm so glad we have been working with College Funding Systems, because today our family’s life is on track to embrace the next exciting phase of our daughter's life: college. We would like to express special appreciation for Chris Gray, and Angie Sausedo, who were consistently helpful, responsive, patient, and generous in sharing informed insight. I would highly recommend that anyone facing the complicated and stressful college admissions process work with College Funding Systems and reduce that stress significantly.\"\n\nBrian & Andrea Rosenbaum\n\nNone / Personal Trainer\n\nTualatin, Oregon\n\n\"Thanks to Stuart, Chris and the friendly team at College Funding Systems (CFS), who have proven their worth many times in the past year. The process of finding and funding a college career can be complicated, tedious and rife with pitfalls. As we have learned, it is important to have solid financial strategies and access to the critical information needed to efficiently navigate the myriad forms and processes the schools demand. The webinars, online tools, weekly tips, periodic one-one meetings, reference materials and research information CFS provides have been tremendously valuable.\n\nThe advice and coaching provided directly to our daughter have been helpful too. There is no doubt they’ve saved us money, time and pain, and with the assistance of CFS we are confident that we are making good decisions. Bottom line - CFS has helped make our journey much easier. I have recommended them to others already and would do so again without hesitation.\n\n…Brian\n\nStudent Graduates: 2019 – Westmont College\n\nStudent Graduates: 2022 -\"\n\nMike & Kathleen Gommi\n\nSenior Living Administration / Pre-school teacher\n\nPuyallup, Washington\n\n\"Before working with College Funding Systems, our family was very concerned and anxious about our ability to pay for college for our three boys. We always knew that we would want our children to pay a percentage of their college (around 20%), but that still left an enormous amount for us to handle. Couple that with having a few years when two kids would be in college at the same time, and it felt insurmountable.\n\nWithin the first two to three months of getting enrolled in the program and beginning to work with Stuart Grossman and his staff, there was a tremendous emotional weight lifted as we put together a plan and began to realize that we could make this happen. College Funding Systems has at their disposal some very powerful financial tools and strategies that have made it possible for us to pay for college without turning our lives completely upside-down.\n\nI'm so glad we have been working with College Funding Systems, because today we have peace of mind about something that was haunting us since the birth of our first child. Now we don’t even have to think about it at all thanks to Stuart and his staff.\n\nThank You,\n\nMike & Kathleen Gommi\n\nStudent Graduates: 2019 – University of Washington\n\nStudent Graduates: 2017 - University of Washington\n\nStudent Graduates: 2023 -\"\n\nMike & Debbie Helmersen\n\nFacilities Engineer / Building Manager\n\nPasco, Washington\n\n\"Before working with Grossman & Associates our family was completely lost. We had no idea where to even begin preparing for college. Grossman & Associates was so helpful in calming all our fears and helping us through each step.\n\nWithin the first two to three months of getting enrolled in the program, these are the things that improved in our family’s life. We felt more secure in making decisions about our children's future. We had enough information to make informed and wise decisions to prepare for what was coming.\n\nI'm so glad we have been working with Grossman & Associates because today our family’s life is moving toward a more secure future. They have assisted us in getting one child all the way through a master's degree and we are moving forward with the next one. We feel confident in working with Grossman & Associates and know that they have our best interest in mind.\n\nThank You,\n\nStudent Graduates: 2016 – Walla Walla University\n\nStudent Graduates: 2020 -\"\n\nKendra & Josh Birnley\n\nTeachers\n\nPortland, Oregon\n\n\"Before working with College Funding Systems our family was feeling quite anxious about the college application process and worried about how we would afford our son's tuition. We also have a unique experience in that I have recently gone back to school as well, so we'll have two people in our house in college at the same time.\n\nWithin the first couple weeks of getting enrolled in the program, our worries started to diminish. It's definitely still a large and intimidating process but having someone on our side to guide us and answer our questions really put us at ease. The test prep materials were also quite helpful for our son; his SAT score went up over 100 points after he completed the prep, and it put him in the top 25th percentile for the schools he applied to.\n\nI'm so glad we have been working with College Funding Systems because it has given us more financial stability than we had before. Even with one of us in school in addition to our son, my partner and I are more knowledgeable about how to invest and save our money, and we feel more in control of our future than we did before. We have a solid plan in place not just to pay for college, but also to have funds set aside for other spending adventures we might take on in the future.\"\n\nJerry, Dawn and Megan Goertz\n\nTruck Driver & Hematology Division Supervisor\n\nMedical Lake, WA\n\n\"My wife Dawn and I feel that the service that Chris and College Funding Systems has provided to us has been very helpful. Before working with them we were very concerned about this process and how we were going to pay for it. We were provided information, and support to fully understand all of our options. They have provided us timely support and a very easy web-site to get all the information in and submitted for the FAFSA form, right the first time, on-time and guidance and support in optimizing our daughter Megan’s financial package. They also showed us how important it was for our daughter to have good grades, and good ACT and SAT scores and how this all fits together. We never would have believed that we could afford a private school like Gonzaga or Whitworth vs a State school such as Eastern Washington. The support of Chris and College Funding Systems provided us with significant peace of mind that, given our hectic life, nothing would fall through the cracks. The staff has all been courteous, well organized, supportive and accommodating.\n\nIn the end our daughter Megan was able to attend Whitworth University with just over $2,000 out-of-pocket difference vs Eastern Washington University.\n\nI highly recommend this service.\n\nThank you for making her dreams come true.\"\n\nNorm & Yolanda Ward\n\nGeneral Manager / Assistant Manager\n\nKennewick, WA\n\n\"Before working with College Funding Systems our family was anxious and concerned that we would complete the FAFSA incorrectly.\n\nWe also were concerned about our children understanding the process of preparing and applying for college. The counselors and administrators have been very helpful with our children, and with us. Especially when we did not understand specific information regarding this daunting process.\n\nWithin the first three months of getting enrolled in the program these are the things that improved in our family life. We finally had a plan, and a time frame that helped us feel like we were getting things prepared for our children’s college, which limited less stress for us and them.\n\nWe are so glad we found this program, we would highly recommend them to others. Their support and patience has limited our stress in preparing for college for our children.\n\nWe would like to thank the staff for all they have done for us.\"\n\nThomas and Haechong Kwiat\n\nEngineering Manager / Food Service Worker\n\nGig Harbor, Washington\n\n\"Prior to signing on with College Funding Systems, we had a rather vague understanding of how the college financial aid process works. Once we ascertained what Stuart's team has to offer, we became convinced that it was in our interests to partner with Stuart and company. And we are very glad that we did.\n\nStuart and his staff have exceeded our expectations in a number of ways. Everyone knows the business and can explain what we need to know in a courteous, professional and responsive manner. In particular, the CSS Profile can be quite daunting. The online account module allows you to input your data in draft form, then Stuart's team performs a quality check to make sure everything is complete and accurate prior to formal submission. This approach eliminates the guess work, increases reporting accuracy, and reduces anxiety levels. We also have appreciated Stuart's review of all the financial aid award letters to make sure we were getting a fair deal. All in all, this service is well worth the relatively modest cost.\"\n\nBritney Carpenter\n\nIT Specialist\n\nPortland, Oregon\n\n\"Before working with College Funding Systems our family was extraordinarily concerned about figuring out the best way to actually pay for college - where will all this money come from? We also felt the entire system has become much more complicated than when we went to college, making the need for specialized advice much higher in our circumstances.\n\nWithin the first two to three months of getting enrolled in the program there were some very specific things that improved in our family’s life. We felt we were given very helpful information, with real specifics as to what we were facing and how our kids could benefit from this program. There are so many avenues of support within College Funding Systems' plan.\n\nI'm so glad we have been working with College Funding Systems, because today our family’s life is set on a course where we understand the plan and what we need to do to pay for college. The support from Chris has been stellar and we are looking forward to continuing this journey.\"\n\nJeff Merrill\n\nDoctor\n\nBothell, WA\n\n\"Stuart, Chris, Matt, Charlie and other wonderful CFS folks,\n\nThank you very kindly for your kind card and your gift for Ben. If he hasn't sent you a big thank you note by now then he's in trouble! We are very grateful for all your help and patience and time over this past difficult year! Ben is very excited about attending PLU and it certainly seems like the right school for him in so many ways.\n\nI'm going to try to send you a couple of his grad pics - they might be too big for Email. If so I'll write back and see if you have Dropbox or something.\n\nAlso, my other son Dylan (21) is considering returning to Community College (Cascadia here in Bothell) Winter Quarter. If he takes another step or two in that direction then I might be asking you folks to move the data from the FAFSA for Ben and his Mom to a new FAFSA for Dylan, hopefully that wont occupy much of your time.\n\nThanks!\"\n\nKevin Poteet\n\nIT Program Manager\n\nLynnwood, Washington\n\n\"Hello Grossman & Associates,\n\nI want to thank you for everything that you have done to help me as a single parent and first time college parent navigate the complex college funding process...your guidance has been very much appreciated and worth the investment.\n\nAttached is a photo of my youngest daughter Madison in the t-shirt you sent her...Go Cardinals!!\n\nMany Thanks,\"\n\nMark McFall & Cynthia Villines\n\nRetired/ Para Professional Secretary\n\nSpokane, Washington\n\n\"The college application, selection, and funding process has become complicated, difficult, and intimidating. With no current experience to guide us through all of this, we could not take the chance on making any mistakes or missing any opportunities as our first daughter / granddaughter Robyn was preparing to apply for college.\n\nWe’re thankful and fortunate that we found College Funding Systems. Chris Gray and Stuart Grossman helped us to understand the entire process and provided invaluable guidance and assistance on all aspects of it. Kathy's interview of and SAT preparation for Robyn was also most helpful. We are very satisfied with the outcome and highly recommend their services.\n\nWe will also be partnering with Grossman's College Funding Systems for Robyn’s two younger brothers when their time comes.\"\n\nMarkus Flury and Joan Wu\n\nUniversity Professor/ University Professor\n\nPuyallup, Washington\n\n\"We assume a busy career and demanding schedule, and filing FAFSA for two college students in a timely manner is a daunting task on our already-full plate. Stuart Grossman and his staff have been very helpful to us. They not only send reminders prior to each and every deadline but also review and finalize all the documents before promptly submitting the filing on our behalf.\n\nStuart and his team have also provided valuable suggestions and advice on how to diversify our assets and investment. We are grateful to them for their dedicated help and service.\"\n\nMaya Koduri\n\nStudent at Savannah College of Art and Design\n\nSavannah, GA\n\n\"Dear Mr. Grossman-\n\nThank you so much for the wonderful gift and for all your help this year! 🙂 With your team's help, I'm able to go to a great college. Again, thank you and I can't wait to wear the T-shirt at SCAD.\"\n\nKeith and Patty Meadows\n\nStudent at The Art Institute of Seattle\n\nSeattle, WA\n\n\"Just a quick note to say thank you for the shirt. Katie is pretty picky about her clothes and you got it right. She wears this one quite a bit.\n\nKeith, Patty and Katie\"\n\nMichelle Tong\n\nStudent at University of California, Los Angeles\n\nLos Angeles, CA\n\n\"Hi Mr. Grossman,\n\nI received the UCLA sweatshirt that College Funding has sent me in the mail and I just wanted to thank you for making the college application process easier for my family and me!\"\n\nBen Merrill\n\nStudent at Pacific Lutheran University\n\nLos Angeles, CA\n\n\"Stuart and folks,\n\nThanks so much for helping my dad and I throughout the whole college process. It was truly a peace to us to be able to rely on your guidance.\n\nI'm so glad we were successful in finding and paying for the right college!\"\n\nMike and Sue Dillard\n\nEngineer / Parks and Recreation Instructor\n\nAuburn, Washington\n\n\"We attended a seminar to learn about College Funding Systems because we knew we needed help with the process of getting our daughters the right education. The two biggest reasons for us to seek help was to get scheduling discipline to keep us from missing any important milestones and deadlines, and to learn what vehicles were available for financing. Stuart Grossman and his team were with us every step of the way. Our family was provided counseling and tools for choosing careers and schools, preparing for SAT exams, applying to colleges, and even advice on writing good essays. The assistance for FAFSA preparation relieved us of a lot of stress.\n\nOur first daughter was accepted into Boston College, and our out-of-pocket expenses after financial assistance are not that much more than we would have paid for attending our state school. Now our second daughter is getting ready for her journey to college. We would recommend Grossman and Associates’ College Funding Systems to every parent who wants to make a good college experience a reality for their child.\"\n\nAnna Jacobsen\n\nInsurance Agent\n\nSnohomish, Washington\n\n\"As a single parent I was concerned and anxious about the process of navigating two FAFSA submissions for my daughters and the completion of the forms. I met the College Funding Team with Grossman and Associates in 2015, at my daughters’ high school. I was very impressed with the services they had to offer, and the information they provided about planning for college.\n\nAfter enrolling in the program, an enormous amount of pressure was eliminated, knowing I had the support and skills of a professional team to assure my FAFSA documents were properly completed and submitted within days of the October 1st enrollment period. With my financial situation I was overwhelmed with the desire to submit my application as quickly as possible to hopefully provide me the opportunity to acquire as much financial assistance as possible.\n\nChris and his team at Grossman and Associates, exceeded all my expectations. They provided a service that I would highly recommend to my family and friends. I personally would like to say THANK YOU, job well done. Your efforts have allowed my girls to attend their number one college choice.\"\n\nRobin DeLorenzo\n\nRegistered Nurse\n\nRichland, WA\n\n\"As we prepared to send our daughter to college we became more and more frustrated and anxious about costs and the right plan to take. We attended their workshop and were immediately intrigued that this may be the answer we were looking for. Chris and the team at College Funding Systems had solutions that we didn't know were possible. We immediately found information that was meaningful and helpful to get us going.\n\nChris and his team helped us put together information and submit the FAFSA on time and accurately ensuring that my daughter's needs would be outlined for us in order to make a solid decision. Within the first couple of months of enrollment in the program we had a step by step plan of what needed to be done next, which really improved our family's peace of mind. We could concentrate on entrance tests, college tours and exploring degree options rather than worrying about the financial aspect.\n\nWe are forever grateful to Chris and The College Funding Systems team, because today we enjoy hearing the successes our daughter is having in the school she chose, and not stressed if we made the right choice. Because of the knowledge learned from Chris and his team we were able to assist our friend with critical information as well. We love sharing in others' happiness, and thank College Funding Systems for that peace of mind to do so. We so appreciate the non-pressurized approach Chris uses when we meet. We get information, he listens to what is going on in our family at that time and provides feedback and options we hadn't considered. This is definitely one of the BEST decisions our family has made in decades.\n\nThank You Chris and College Funding Systems. I highly recommend this program.\"\n\nJoni Rivera\n\nBusiness Consultant\n\nBoise, Idaho\n\n\"Before we met Chris from College Funding, we were overwhelmed with the process of applying to different colleges, searching for grants and student loans that are available, filling out the FAFSA form and most importantly, how we were going to pay for ours son's college education. Because the task was so daunting, we didn't do anything until the last minute and time was of the essence.\n\nWithin the first couple of months of working with College Funding, we had a plan in place. We were given a road map with how to maneuver each task that was required. We found a college, we received help with filling out the information for government funding and had a financial plan to pay for college tuition.\n\nWorking with College Funding was one of the best decisions we've made. Today our son is thriving in his college life as we continue to receive coaching and guidance from College Funding. I highly recommend this service, it has paid off tenfold.\"\n\nVictoria F. Taladoc\n\nReceiving Associate, Burlington Coat Factory\n\nMountlake Terrace, WA\n\n\"My son’s senior year in high school was a thrilling time yet also a worrisome one. Though I was ecstatic to see my son’s acceptance letters come in, I worried about how we would be able to afford the next four years. As a single mother, finances have always been a challenge and at first, I wasn’t sure if joining College Funding Systems was worth its initial upfront investment.\n\nWe are about to go into his 3rd year in College, and thanks to help from Chris Gray and College Funding Systems, we have yet to pay a single cent for tuition. College Funding Systems has helped us in all our financial decisions, and aid applications. They know how to maximize our financial situation to help us get the help we need. The peace of mind knowing that my son will complete his education without drowning in debt is a feeling that is priceless.\n\nNow when my son comes home, we focus on his achievements in school and what exciting pathways he’ll be following next. His job at school is enough of a challenge already, it’s great we don’t have to worry about finances limiting his potential. I feel safe and secure that Chris Gray and College Funding Systems will continue to help us in the next couple years and I look to the future with optimism and hope.\"\n\nPaul Singleton\n\nDirector of Retirees NALC Letter Carriers Branch 442\n\nSpokane, WA\n\n\"Fall is here and your youngest daughter comes to you and says, \"Can you help me complete my FAFSA application?\", panic sets in and then you realize that you are a client of College Funding Systems located in Spokane, WA. I picked up the phone and got scheduled right away with Chris Gray who is an associate advisor for CFS. Appointment time came and I'm in his office going over financial date held in my folder on my lap. Chris seamlessly guided me through the questions and answers I needed to complete the FAFSA.\n\nUpon arriving home under his leadership I obtained the missing pieces to our college FAFSA puzzle and got on line with their convenient website and added the pieces to the FAFSA. I dropped off hard copies of things to Chris along with a phone call from him and guess what, CFS and Chris Gray had guided me through the obstacle course and I wasn't stressed out and I could report to my daughter that CFS had come through for us and the FAFSA was on its way.\n\nIf you want to avoid the stress related with the FAFSA and other college funding mysteries, then give Chris Gray a call at College Funding Systems-You'll be glad you did. Their motto is true, \"Proudly Helping Students Pursue Their Educational and Career Goals\".\"\n\nKathryn Foss\n\nSales Rep\n\nTukwila, WA\n\n\"Before working with College Funding Systems, I was nervous about how to pay for college for my daughters. I attended their workshop, and was sold on their College Planning process! There were so many parents with similar concerns as mine, and I left that night feeling that I was not alone, and that they would be able to get us on the right financial path!\n\nWithin the first two to three months of getting enrolled in the program, I had many conversations with Chris Gray, and the staff at College Funding Systems, and they took the frustrations I had with how to make this process work for me and turned it around with knowledgeable help, guidance, literature, helpful books etc. They saved my sanity!\n\nI'm so glad we have been working with College Funding Systems, because today our family’s life is no longer financially a mess. The FAFSA no longer is a daunting chore. We know how to make the process work for us. My oldest daughter just graduated from WSU and my youngest is set up for the next 4 years at college with the supportive help of Chris and his awesome staff. They are only a quick call or email away when I have questions. I highly recommend their service!!\"\n\nKatie Kladar\n\nHomemaker\n\nHayden, Idaho\n\n\"Working with Chris at College Funding Systems has taken away the stress and frustration of filing the required annual FAFSA forms. It's such a relief knowing it will be taken care of every year for all 5 of our children. Having this piece of mind is worth every penny. Also, working with the college advisor, Kathy, was very helpful. I frequently recommend College Funding Systems to friends.\"\n\nJenny and Donny Gochanour\n\nTeacher/Groundskeeper\n\nWhidbey Island, WA\n\n\"We are so grateful to Stuart Grossman and his College Funding Systems team! They were tremendously helpful to us in organizing our financial situation and planning for the future, both college expenses and beyond. By helping us prioritize and budget, we were able to increase the amount of money we put away for college expenses. Besides financial strategies and advice, CFS provided excellent SAT preparation resources, student career counseling, and financial aid projections relative to average students at the colleges on our daughter's list of options. CFS's weekly \"Tip of the Week\" emails and informative webinars were also wonderful resources, especially for those of us going through this college process for the first time. Their advice with the FAFSA process also made the daunting paperwork a little less stressful and kept us on track with timely reminders of FAFSA due dates. The CFS team is knowledgeable, informative, and helpful, and their clear and valuable specialty is helping families through the college financial planning process.\"\n\nLorraine Shaw & Paul Giacomini\n\nBookkeeper, Warehouse worker\n\nSpokane, WA\n\n\"Our family was intimidated by the college enrollment process. The high school was giving very little help, if any.\n\nWith the help of Chris and College Funding Systems, the entire process was made simple and easy to understand. There was someone there to guide us and answer our questions. Having tools to walk us through the FAFSA information and submit it on our behalf PERFECTLY was a HUGE help. Chris is very good at giving us clear financial options and helping us to make the right decisions for our situation. We felt very little stress in the entire college application and funding process.\n\nWe are very confident in the decisions we have made and continue to make with Chris's help. Compared to the cost of college, the investment in College Funding Systems is more than worth it. Money well spent. We feel as if we have gotten more than our money's worth for all the help we received and avoiding potentially costly mistakes.\"\n\nElisabeth Beresford-Wood\n\nHomemaker\n\nPost falls, Idaho\n\n\"Working with College Funding Systems has been an incredibly helpful experience. Before working with Chris, our family was very overwhelmed and had little to know idea where to begin our college journey. With the assistance from Chris and the rest of the team, my daughter was able to find which colleges she would be best fit for and helped us develop a financial package that was just right for our needs. Thanks to College Funding Systems and specially Chris Gray, we can move forward with a confident college decision and be financially prepared.\"\n\nCrystal Lewis\n\nAssociate Project Manager, Avista Corporation\n\nSpokane, WA\n\n\"Working with Chris at College Funding has been a pleasure. Trying to tackle the very daunting tasks of college applications and essays, financial aid, and understanding the whole process was overwhelming.\n\nChris was very positive and stepped right in and guided us through the process, taking care of us the entire way through high school graduation, college selection, understanding financial aid, and helping prepare us for the financial aspects of higher education. Knowing we have a plan and Chris's support for the current and upcoming college years gives us peace of mind and is priceless.\n\nThanks again Chris for your guidance.\"\n\nTim and Connie Wood\n\nBoth Teachers\n\nRathrum ID\n\n\"We were concerned about paying for our son's college education and still be able to have some money for retirement. Stuart answered all our questions at a college seminar we attended locally. He helped us re-direct money we were spending to start an excellent financial plan to pay for college. Now we are encouraged and hopeful in what the future has for us financially.\"\n\nDavid E. Lytle\n\nEverett, WA\n\n\"Stuart Grossman and his associates have been a huge asset to me and my family. With three daughters in three different colleges at the same time and each school having different requirements has made having Collage Funding System on my side an absolute requirement. Stuart and his staff are extremely knowledgeable, and have made my FAFSA experience tolerable. I have had many questions and issues with the schools, and Stuart and his staff have pulled me through each issue, and my girls and I are all the better for it. The service that College Funding has offered has been well worth the cost and I would highly recommend them to anyone facing the challenge of paying for college and all the red tape associated with completing the FAFSA.\"\n\nRex & Chris Kerbs\n\nTeacher & Para-educator\n\nAuburn, WA\n\n\"Stuart Grossman and the team at College Funding Systems are a welcome asset for families as they deal with the rising costs of a college education in today’s world. They are very knowledgeable about all of the aspects of a student entering college; from academic advising and selecting schools to developing financial plans. They developed an individualized plan for us that avoids huge amounts of debt for our family and for our student. Now, as our daughter has completed her freshman year of college, the plan is working smoothly and successfully. Everyone in the office has been helpful and friendly, whenever I called with questions and needed help or assistance. My wife and I have the peace of mind that we are on the right track, with one daughter in college and another daughter entering college in two years. Thanks Stuart and the entire College Funding System team!\"\n\nChris & Jacqueline Devries\n\nCasper, Washington\n\n\"With this being our first experience shopping for a university, College Funding made the overall journey a lot less intimidating. With their knowledge of funding, we were able to add schools to our list that would have otherwise been considered unaffordable. Thanks to College Funding our daughter is going to her number one choice school, out of state and private for roughly the same price as an in state public university. College Funding also made filling out the FAFSA easy and stress free.\"\n\nSpencer Donnelson\n\nStudent at Gonzaga University\n\nSpokane, WA\n\n\"A Savior through the Storm\" - College is one of the greatest experiences during some of the best years of one’s life. However, while it’s full of new people, a taste of independence, and the thrill of being exposed to the real world, there are some heavy stressors that go hand in hand with the fun. This includes the burden high school seniors carry a majority of their graduation year, uncertain of which university will be the best fit for them. And with the commitment deadline lurking closer each day, they and their families are going in blind with no sense of direction in regards to money, finances, and frantically making sure every available scholarship has been accessed. Luckily, these difficult aspects can be tamed into structured plans with no uncertainties as to what college costs will look like for you and your student throughout this college odyssey. College Funding Systems has the knowledge, skills, and all-around genuine team members who will walk with you every step of the college process to control and carve a clean route of travel which is custom to every family they work with. They are the savior in this storm of hectic decisions, numbers, and time.\"\n\nAl Hodges\n\nPolice Officer\n\nLakebay, WA\n\n\"Stuart GROSSMAN showed me how I can pay for my child’s college and save money when I thought, “No way can I find extra money for this”. Well Stuart did it! I now save about $1600 a month and I can pay for college, wow! Thank you Mr. GROSSMAN I look forward to working with you while we get Nolan through school.\"\n\nMike & Linda Fay\n\nPhysician’s Assistant\n\nSeattle, Washington\n\n\"College Funding Systems takes the guess work out of the college application and financial aid process, making it easy to focus on what's important... my family's future!\"\n\nDan & Lori Veloski\n\nLaw Enforcement | Para Educator\n\nSpokane, Washington\n\n\"College Funding Systems opened up an opportunity to look at colleges we thought were out of our price range. Our daughter attended Seattle University for the same price as what it costs to go to a state college. She was also able to spend a semester in Italy studying abroad and we even had enough funds to go visit her! College Funding Systems helped us thru the entire 4 years. They were there for us whenever we had questions or needed help. Simply put, we couldn't have done this without them.\"\n\nKeven & LeAnn Winter\n\nTeacher | Dentist\n\nEverett, Washington\n\n\"Not only has College Funding Systems smoothed the way through the college financial aid process, but they have helped us establish a plan to pay for college in a comfortable manner while being able to continue saving for our retirement.\"\n\nCraig & Amy Gracyalny\n\nRadiologist | Teacher\n\nSpokane, Washington\n\n\"College Funding Systems guided us through the college financial aid process and took care of all the details.

His program has provided much help in outlining all the steps necessary searching for the proper schools for both our daughters. Having graduated from college some 40 years ago, it appears much has changed. Mr. Grossman showed us many college financing options we were not familiar with, and helped us align our financial statement that showed true value. The program not only helped find the best fit for the schools that matched our wants and needs, but also formatted a strategy for acceptance to said schools. The College Funding System made the daunting task of finding a college education a pleasant endeavor.\""
