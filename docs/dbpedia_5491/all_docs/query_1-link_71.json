        "text": "by McKensey Richmond\n\nHistory of gender ratios in universities\n\nTotal enrollment figures of universities show that female students outnumbered male students for the first time in the late 1970s, and have steadily increased their numerical advantage ever since, according to Forbes magazine.\n\nWhitworth University fits the trend of significantly more females than males enrolling in universities. In the early 1890s, the founding years of Whitworth, Whitworth had an enrollment of 37 percent females and 63 percent males, according to the Catalogue of Whitworth College. The gender ratios of the early 1890s starkly contrast 2016’s female-dominated university enrollment of 57 percent female and 43 percent male enrollment.\n\nAccording to Whitworth’s institutional research archives, 1942 was the first year female enrollment outnumbered male enrollment, only by one female. In 1943-1945, male enrollment plummeted, with an average of 22 percent male enrollment and 78 percent female enrollment.\n\nOther than that time period during World War II, Whitworth’s enrollment fits the trend of females significantly outnumbering males in universities starting in the late 1970s.\n\nNationally for the last few years, public universities have an average imbalance of 43% male and 64% female enrollment, while private schools have an even greater imbalance of 40% male and 60% female enrollment, according to Forbes magazine.\n\nSince Whitworth falls within the current national average for non-profit university attendance, the imbalanced gender ratio does not cause concern, said Marianne Hansen, director of Whitworth admissions.\n\n“If we ever were to drop below 40 percent (male enrollment) then it would be a concern and we would need to shift our gears as to how we are recruiting males,” Hansen said.\n\nReasons for Whitworth having higher female ratios\n\nThe gender imbalance at Whitworth, as a Christian private school, may be greater than that of a state school, said Greg Orwig, vice president of admissions and financial aid.\n\n“Based on institutional type, the gender ratio is even more out of balance,” Orwig said. “Being a Christian liberal arts school, we track the most disproportionately female pool.”\n\nWhile Whitworth admissions isn’t actively trying to enroll more males, “some of the things that help us (have less disparity between gender ratios) is we are strong in our STEM programs and we have a football team,” Hansen said.\n\n“Some of the Christian colleges that don’t have some of the things that pull male students into their campuses are seeing a larger disparity between the two genders,” Hansen said.\n\nThe institutional type contributes to Whitworth having a larger female population, but the average for all universities shows the same trend of increasingly more female enrollment.\n\nReasons for the shift across U.S. universities and colleges\n\nHealth science professor Robin Pickering said reasons for the shift to more female attendance in college include the powerful feminist figures in the 1970s who provided options for women to pursue careers and higher education.\n\n“Also looking at the timing of the shift, birth control was introduced in 1960, allowing women to postpone pregnancy and pursue other things outside the home,” Pickering said. “Then we began seeing more women in professional roles.”\n\nHigh-paying employment opportunities in manufacturing and manual labor available to males right out of high school may be a factor for the shift to fewer men attending college, Orwig said.\n\n“I don’t think the same lucrative opportunities tend to be there for women,” Orwig said. “We are moving towards more of a knowledge economy than a manufacturing economy, and women can compete just as well, or better, in the knowledge economy for jobs.”\n\nImpact of the gender imbalance in universities\n\nWhitworth students Nathan Ayala and Elisabeth Shaughnessy said they see the gender imbalance affecting classroom dynamics. Ayala said the class discussion and topics in his mostly female sociology class tend to be more female oriented.\n\nIn Shaughnessy’s sexuality and society class with only one male student, “it is hard not hearing the male perspective on topics,” she said.\n\nWhitworth students Kyndra Sherman, Kionte Brown, Ayala, and Shaughnessy said they did not consider gender ratio when applying to colleges. While gender ratios may not have an affect on a prospective students’ decision-making process, research suggests the gender ratio imbalance in universities and colleges may affect dating culture.\n\nAccording to research done by the author of “Date-onomics: How Dating Became a Lopsided Numbers Game,” “When men are in oversupply, the dating culture emphasizes courtship and monogamy. But when women are in oversupply—as they are today at most U.S. colleges and universities, there tends to be more of a casual hookup culture.”\n\nCoinciding with that idea, the associate director of counseling and wellness services at New York University, which is 61 percent female, said, “This gender imbalance on college campuses discourages traditional dating and promotes casual sex,” according to Money magazine.\n\nSherman said no matter what school, there are always people that only hook up, some that don’t date at all, and some who date long-term.\n\n“If there are a lot more of one gender, then people may not be pushed to value a relationship, because the climate makes it easier to hop from person to person,” she said. “From what I’ve seen, I would say about 40 percent of Whitworth students would date long-term, and the rest of students are those that don’t want to date at all and those who just have casual hookups.”\n\nIf those numbers are accurate for Whitworth, the gender imbalance could be reason for why there is either casual hookups or long-term committed relationships in the direction of marriage, and no in-between of dating to get to know each other, Orwig said.\n\nHaving a higher ratio of females to males has both positive and negative aspects, Pickering said. A positive aspect is an increased respect for women because they are pursuing higher education. A negative aspect can be people have little knowledge of sex education and there is shame associated with sex, so people turn to the media for sex education, Pickering said. “Couple that with the fact there are less men available, then women feel they aren’t enough and they get competitive,” Pickering said.\n\nShaughnessy agrees with Pickering. “The higher percentage of females brings that competitiveness out sometimes, to where you see relationships soon fall apart because the initial attraction was based off competition,” Shaughnessy said.\n\nThis idea of competition with a small dating pool and less males contributes to why there may be an increased hookup culture at colleges with significantly more females than males enrolled, Pickering said.\n\nHuman sources\n\nWritten by: McKensey Richmond 805.245.9189mrichmond18@my.whitworth.edu\n\nRobin Pickering, Associate Prof, Health Science 509.777.4734 rpickering@whitworth.edu\n\nMarianne Hansen, Director of Admissions 509.777.4347mhansen@whitworth.edu\n\nGreg Orwig, Vice President, Admissions & Financial Aid 509.777.4580 gorwig@whitworth.edu\n\nKyndra Sherman, Whitworth Student, Junior 360.929.7215ksherman18@my.whitworth.edu\n\nNathan Ayala, Whitworth Student, Junior 509.638.9260nayala18@my.whitworth.edu\n\nElisabeth Shaughnessy, Whitworth Student, Senior 425.387.5579 eshaughnessy17@my.whitworth.edu\n\nKionte Brown, Whitworth Student, Seniorkbrown17@my.whitworth.edu\n\nLinks to sources/public records\n\nhttps://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d15/tables/dt15_303.10.asp?current=yes\n\nHarriet Cheney Cowles Memorial Library > Whitworth University Archives, Institutional Research.

Both are Christian non-profits providing a holistic approach to helping impoverished members of the Spokane community.\n\n“People hang out here to eat and get coffee,” said assistant director of The City Gate, James Gulbranson. “I think they come here because it’s a safe place, too.”\n\nWhile The City Gate works with low-income and homeless people of all ages, Cup of Cool Water ministers specifically to teens experiencing homelessness. An Eastern Washington University study discovered that Spokane was home to 3,000 such teens in 2015, but executive director Mark Terrell said the number is even higher. The study failed to include teenagers outside of school and the actual number could be as high as 4,500, Terrell said.\n\nTerrell’s ministry specifically works with many of the teenagers who aren’t in school. Cup of Cool Water offer a space to get haircuts, do laundry, and hang out together.\n\n“We try to create a space of peace and hope and love,” Terrell said. “It’s all about developing healthy relationships.”\n\nAccording to their website, Terrell created Cup of Cool Water after being continuously reminded of two homeless teens he met while studying at Whitworth University. He elected to start an organization to help teens like the two he met, and after over 20 years Cup of Cool Water is still attempting to carry out that mission.\n\nTerrell said he wanted the ministry to be built on relationships. Despite the occasional “one step forward, two steps back” nature of the work, he thinks their message is successful due to the mentoring relationships Terrell said Cup of Cool Water tries to foster.\n\nThe importance of those relationships is not lost on Gulbranson. Four years ago he moved into the Alberta House, The City Gate’s low-rent housing. The family atmosphere is one of the reasons he’s still drug-free and sober today, he said.\n\nGulbranson says he ran away from home at age 13 and didn’t move in to the Alberta House until he was 34, so he understands the plight and promise of many teenagers who go to The City Gate.\n\n“Every family who comes here has one child who’s going to make a difference in this world,” Gulbranson said.\n\nBoth Cup of Cool Water and The City Gate are reliant on donations. Terrell and Gulbranson said God provides the money and other donations they use to minister to Spokane’s homeless teenagers.\n\n“God’s been incredibly faithful,” Terrell said.\n\nCup of Cool Water received many of the donations, and its public tax record for 2014 showed an average of roughly $260,000 in donations per year from 2011-2014. The total revenue listed in 2014 was $298,286. The organization also utilizes many volunteers, who give their time performing various services, Terrell said.\n\nCup of Cool Water used its revenue to provide food, laundry and other services. The donations also pay the organization’s rent and the salaries of eight staff members, including Terrell’s listed salary of $51,528.\n\nThe City Gate’s website said its gifts come in many forms from clothes to food to money to volunteers. They listed several grocery stores that donate food for their kitchen, the main daily service they provide. Whitworth provides help as well, in the form of clothing and volunteers.\n\n“We’re grateful for help,” Gulbranson said, “Whitworth has been awesome to us.”\n\nAccording to numbers provided on the school website, Whitworth has spent enough money on campus renovations over the past five years, the school could have purchased 4,024 new sports cars.\n\nSince 2011, over twenty upgrades costing more than $100 thousand have been made to the 200-acre campus, currently home to 2,685 undergraduate students. Those renovations, according to the University website, include the addition of $32 million science building built in 2011 and a $13.5 million addition and revamp to the Cowles Music Center, completed this year.\n\nTo put that number into some perspective, Lewis and Clark College, a 134-acre private institution home to 2,209 undergraduate students, only mentions two recent renovations on their school website, without any mention of the cost of those upgrades.\n\nIn addition, Whitman College, a 117-acre college with 1,470 undergraduate students, mentions only three renovations occurring since 2008 on its official website. While it mentions an $11 million library renovation, money is not largely emphasized in reference to the changes occurring on those campuses.\n\nGonzaga University, a 152-acre a private, four-year institution of higher education with a slightly larger student body, 7,691 students, had their last renovation projects in 2009, according to the school’s website. The university spent over $18 million on upgrades to three of their buildings, but has not done any substantial renovations in the seven years since.\n\nSince the unveiling of Whitworth’s 10-year vision and strategic plan, “Courage at the Crossroads,” the university website has provided a list of each project along with the total cost of each, which in total is $123 million. Over $100 million has been spent on upgrading facilities on campus since 2011.\n\nWhile the school aims for the majority of the money for these “longer-term projects comes largely from fundraising and endowment funds,” said Kris Zimbelman, a senior accountant of the university, it is not “enough to cover the costs in their entirety.”\n\n“My friends and I always joke when we see construction on campus that we can feel our wallets getting smaller,” Whiworth junior Kennedy Chambers said, “we always just assumed the money spent on that stuff came solely from our tuition.”\n\nAccording to Whitworth’s 2015 Form 990, an IRS form that provides the public with financial information about nonprofit organizations, the school’s total revenue in 2015 was $124 million. In one year, Whitworth took in roughly $1 million less than the amount spent on renovations over the past five years.\n\nLewis and Clark’s Form 990 states that the college’s total revenue in 2015 was nearly $46 million more than Whitworth’s and yet it spent only one-twelfths the amount Whitworth has on renovations.\n\nJunior Sarah Dixit says she can see the benefit these improvements have on potential students every day when she gives campus tours for potential students. Dixit said, “Parents and students always comment on tours how nice and inviting the campus looks. It is a big selling point for the university and it shows that the investment on construction is working.”\n\nOn the other hand, some are slightly unhappy with the school’s transparency about funds. Student Celia Larson said so much talk about money on the school’s website is somewhat “off-putting” in her opinion.\n\nThe school’s website states that it plans to continue a number of renovations into the year 2021. There are master plans to add parking to campus, tear down the Village to replace with a new dorm and even include an expansion and upgraded theatre and performing arts center.\n\nBackground of women in collegiate sports\n\nIn the last 50 years the number of women enrolled in college has drastically changed, and with it the number of women in college sports.\n\nAccording to an article written in the Sports Journal and published by the United States Sports Academy, the first college women’s teams to play were Berkley and Stanford in 1896 in a basketball game.\n\nHowever, the vast majority of early sports opportunities for women were intramural, unlike men’s sports at the time.\n\nWhen the Nineteenth Amendment was passed in 1920, there was another push for better opportunities for women in sports.\n\nThough setbacks occurred as a result of the Depression because “the expectations of society were that a woman’s place was ‘in the home,’ which pushed aside the idea that there were psychological and physiological benefits to be gained from involvement in sport.”\n\nAs the Civil Rights Act of 1964 came into effect, the voice and status of women were raised and women continued to seek more equal opportunities in sports.\n\nAccording to USA Today, the history of women’s college sports really got going when the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics was formed in 1971. In 1972, Title IX was passed. This led to the NCAA abandoning their rule of prohibiting female students from participating in athletics in 1973.\n\nToday women playing sports at the professional and college level is a widely accepted part of life, but it is not without drawbacks. For example, professional women’s athletes make significantly less money than their male counterparts.\n\nSports and women at Whitworth University\n\nWhitworth University is a Division III school with 20 varsity sports. Even at this small private school, gender roles and pay gaps are present.\n\nAccording to the Equity in Athletics Database, all ten of the men’s sports and half of the women’s sports are coached by males. This is up from 2011 when only two female head coaches at Whitworth were female.\n\nOff of this issue, Whitworth women’s soccer coach Bryon Olson brought up the fact that out of 400 Division III teams, only one men’s team has a female head coach.\n\nOlson attended Whitworth University and played on the men’s soccer team from 2006 to 2009. He admitted that there is an obvious gender gap in coaching, even at Whitworth, but in the last 10 years the Whitworth athletic department has been focusing on not just equality but hiring the best candidates for the job. “I think it’s good to ask questions, but the mission of the athletics department is to hire amazing people that have a heart for the Lord, a heart for people and to realize that this is bigger than sports,” Olson said.\n\nOlson has coached both men’s and women’s soccer at a high school level and at Whitworth but he said that “If I could pick any job in the world, I would pick being a women’s soccer coach at Whitworth.”\n\nHe acknowledged that the women’s team doesn’t always feel like they get the respect the men’s team does, despite how hard they work. Whitworth junior and soccer player Katie Bischoff said that “it’s hard, because sometimes we aren’t as fun to watch, but we put in so much work and want to be respected.”\n\nWhitworth Senior Mackenzie Kraemer almost played soccer at Whitworth but then didn’t because of a knee injury. She spent a season training with the women’s team. “I wasn’t on the team for the actual season, but I went to the games because I love soccer and I love the girls, and it would piss me off how many people-like students we go to school with, would write the women’s team off without even watching them, just because they were women.”\n\nOlson admits that it can be hard on team moral to play the same sport as the men’s team and not have as many people support you. He said that a quote he likes is “comparison is the thief of all joy.” Olson added that to him it’s more than wanting people to come watch the women play because of the sport, he wants people to come because of how they “use their gifts, resources and talents to the best of their abilities, and are amazing, hardworking and relational.”\n\nIn regards to Olson as their coach Bischoff said, “his perspective is really different and insightful, and he is so affirming. He cares so much and pours everything he has into us which makes us want to give so much back and everything we have into the program which has created the amazing bond we have this year as a team.”\n\nAlthough the soccer season is over, moral of the team ended on a high note, and both players and coach Olson look forward fighting hard on the field and off as they continue to combat negative stereotypes by building an relational atmosphere of hard work, care and respect.\n\nSPOKANE, Wash.—The holiday season is here and Project Beauty Share, a local nonprofit, will use a $1.8 million donation to give to women who need it most this winter.\n\nProject Beauty Share is a nonprofit that accepts beauty products and personal hygiene items and distributes them to 15 other nonprofits in the Spokane area. The nonprofit operates as a middle man, distributing supplies to nonprofits that take care of women and children.\n\n“We’re kind of like the Food Bank,” said Marianne Bornhoft, president of the Project Beauty Share executive board. “The beauty product bank.”\n\nJulie Farley founded Project Beauty Share in 2010 to instill confidence in women by distributing beauty products such as makeup, lotion, personal hygiene items, and hair products, the organization’s website said.\n\nProject Beauty Share partners with organizations like YWCA, Union Gospel Mission, Cup of Cool Water, and Hope House, Bornhoft said.\n\n“We give women the help that most people don’t realize they need,” Bornhoft said.\n\nBornhoft oversees all committees, board members, as well as the structure of the nonprofit. Aside from Project Beauty Share, she is a full-time real estate agent.\n\nProject Beauty Share, unlike many other nonprofits, runs entirely on volunteers and monetary donations. There are no paid employees. The organization prides itself in the fact that no one is paid, Bornhoft said.\n\n“It’s very near and dear to my heart to know that every dollar we raise goes right back out to the community,” Bornhoft said. “It’s not like it stays in anyone’s pocket.”\n\nProject Beauty Share handles a budget of $15,000 per year, 501(c)3 forms filed with the Washington Secretary of State reported. Most of the budget goes towards operations, rent, utilities and various other expenses. While financial donations do not vary much from year to year, product donations for the 2016 year are down, Bornhoft said.\n\n“Unfortunately, this year, our donations are down, besides this hair product—which isn’t normal,” Bornhoft said.\n\nIn June, Project Beauty Share received a donation worth $1.8 million from a California hair salon owner. The man, whose identity could not be revealed by Bornhoft, closed a salon, leaving a trove of D’Cinque hair product. The donation filled the computer-tech office turned warehouse at Project Beauty Share’s operations center.\n\nThe salon owner originally intended to throw away the left-over hair product, but his accountant insisted the product be donated to Project Beauty Share. Project Beauty Share immediately gave large quantities of the hair product to the Hope House and various transitional living homes.\n\nDespite that million-dollar donation, Project Beauty Share lacks basic products for the upcoming Christmas season.\n\n“We just had to buy mascara—no one donated mascara this year so we had to go pay money, which just kills me. It takes away from other things we could do,” Bornhoft said. “The women will use these products all year long until the next year or the next time we give something to them.”\n\nProject Beauty Share lost several product supporters in the last year. Large beauty companies bought out local beauty companies and former suppliers, stifling the number of donations. Before, the makeup companies provided the nonprofit with discontinued items that could longer be sold in stores. Losing those partnerships has dramatically affected the amount of product donations, and therefore, the amount Project Beauty Share can distribute, Bornhoft said.\n\nDonations from makeup companies are limited, so Project Beauty Share now relies more on individuals to fund the needs for the organizations the nonprofit supports.\n\nProject Beauty Share has six applicants pending right now, in addition to the 15 the nonprofit already supplies, seeking services. Organizations pending include World Relief and Salvation Army, which Project Beauty Share does not currently have the capacity to provide for, Bornhoft said.\n\n“I challenge any other nonprofit in Spokane, or anywhere, that does the most good for that little amount of money,” Bornhoft said.\n\nWindermere Real Estate and the Kalispel Tribe of Indians both gave financial donations to help with the holiday gift bags Project Beauty gives out every year. Project Beauty Share will need more reliable sources of financial donations to sustain its level of giving and to, potentially, grow, Bornhoft said.\n\nProject Beauty Share is looking for donations of time, products, and money this holiday season. Donations of new or gently used makeup and personal hygiene make a tremendous difference in a woman’s confidence and boost their dignity, Bornhoft said.\n\n“Not all these women are a product of mental instability. Some of them are in major abusive relationships or just down on their luck and trying to make a better place for themselves and no one will help them,” Bornhoft said.” Just a little bit of help makes all the difference. And that’s our tagline: the beauty is in the giving.”\n\nDonations to Project Beauty Share can be mailed to or dropped off at 216 North Bernard St., Spokane.\n\nContact Rachel Rogers at Rrogers18@my.whitworth.edu"
