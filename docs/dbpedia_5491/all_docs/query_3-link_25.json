        "text": "Something that many Whitworth students appreciate is that the university offers a strong campus ministry program with a relational atmosphere but does not require students to participate. Whitworth Campus Ministry provides many worship and ministry opportunities because everyone worships and views faith differently. Whitworth wants all students to be comfortable on campus and with their faith, so campus ministry leaders create a ministry experience that is optional and based on interests. Here are some of the activities and events that happen on campus.\n\nChapel: Tuesdays and Thursdays from 11-11:30 a.m.\n\nChapel Community Worship is offered twice a week. At the Tuesday chapel service, the worship band leads a few songs and then a campus pastor gives a sermon based on the chapel theme for the semester. On Thursdays, the chapel service starts off with the worship band, followed by a testimony from a student or faculty member and communion. Whitworth does not schedule any classes during chapel, so all students can come if they would like.\n\nHosanna: Tuesdays at 9:45 p.m.\n\nHosanna is an hourlong, student-led worship service that is full of worship music, prayer, and an activity to help students connect with God and grow in their faith.\n\nAwake: Wednesdays at 9:15 p.m.\n\nAwake is a great way to get to know other students at Whitworth. At Awake, students meet for an hour to play games, sing worship songs, listen to student testimonies, and study a Bible message. The structure is very similar to a traditional church youth group, and all students are invited to attend.\n\nLife Groups: Weekly each semester\n\nAt the beginning of every semester, students have the opportunity to sign up for Life Groups. This activity is a time to meet with people who want to grow in their faith through creating connections with a faculty or staff leader, fellow students and God. It is an eight-week program that includes talking about life experiences, participating in a small Bible study and praying together.\n\nMinistry Opportunities\n\nWhitworth Campus Ministry offers many ways to become involved in ministry, including by serving as a campus ministry coordinator or leading worship for chapel and Hosanna. Although many of these positions are not open to first-year students, Campus Pastor for Discipleship & Residence Hall Ministry Lauren Taylor says there are still other ways for first-year students to get involved.\n\nTaylor says helping with Awake is a great way to get started and get to know other people in campus ministry. “You could just walk up to any one of the leaders in Awake and say, ‘Hey, I’d love to play guitar. I’d love to help lead worship for a week sometime,’” Taylor says. “And they will plug you in right away.” She also suggests connecting with your residence hall’s campus ministry coordinator to help lead your hall’s small group or worship nights.\n\nCheck out the chapel website to learn more about campus ministry at Whitworth.\n\nWritten by Denali Herrick ’24"
