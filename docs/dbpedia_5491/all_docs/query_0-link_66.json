        "text": "Whitworth University has a crosstown agreement with Washington State University - Pullman—Det 905. Typically, this means you’ll be enrolled as a full time student at Whitworth University and take your ROTC classes each week at Washington State University - Pullman—Det 905.\n\nWhitworth University will provide a Whitworth Room and Board Scholarship (SRB) for any AFROTC cadets who receive a scholarship that covers Whitworth's University's full tuition and fees. The Room and Board Scholarship for on campus students covers 100% of room and board charges not to exceed the cost of a double occupancy room shared with a roommate plus actual board costs. If a student chooses to live in a theme house and signs up for a meal plan, the Room and Board Scholarship will cover the actual room and board charges up to the standard maximum ($12,500). If a student chooses to live off campus, the student will receive a Room and Board Scholarship that equals the standard room and board allowance that Whitworth uses for students living off campus ($10,647). If a student chooses to live with his or her parent, the student will receive a Room and Board Scholarship that equals the standard room and board allowance that Whitworth uses for students living at home with parents ($3,519).\n\nHost School\n\nWashington State University - Pullman—Det 905\n\nThis is a private school."
