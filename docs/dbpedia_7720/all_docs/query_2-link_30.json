        "text": "Crosscut Saw\n\nOne of the few advantages of being older is that I did get to see many of my musical heroes before they were taken from us. Jimi, Miles, Albert....I can't find the word to describe the effect of seeing and hearing these giants in the flesh!\n\nI wore out my 45 of this song many years ago, but it has lost none of its power...\n\nThanks Albert!\n\nAlbert King songs, people should leave alone, nobody does them justice with the notable exception of Nina Simone.\n\nThis send shivers down my spine.\n\nLet me add to that Mike Bloomfield's version of \"Don't throw your love on me so strong\"...\n\nETA: I know it's not an AK original, but MB's version is based more on AK's version/arrangement rather than T-Bone's original IMO\n\nRegarding which one of the Three Kings is my favorite, I can't really say, any one of them could be my favorite on any given day...\n\nBut I guess I listen to Albert and Freddie the most...(in that order)image removed\n\nThis was a part of my signature pic over at MLP for a while...\n\nAlbert King is still my all-time favorite show, Winter of '78-'79 in Boston at The Paradise.\n\nHe came with a Big Band - Horns, Keys, Everything.\n\nMy Brother and I were walking to The Club, the bus, Albert's Bus - if I ever win a Jackpot I'll be on the lookout for that bus and I'll do a full restoration because it's Albert's - anyways there's Albert sitting in the driver's seat with the window open and both our jaws dropped simultaneously and he greeted us and we got to talk for a couple of minutes. After the show Albert was in the lobby and greeted everyone, shook hands with everyone just like Church and told EVERYBODY to take their time driving Home because it was icy.\n\nTo this day I've never met a single Soul who has known the name Albert King\n\nand not spoken of him with a fervor.\n\nMy Dad and I listened to \"I Wanna Get Funky\" just about everyday when he had the congestive heart failure, we loved that record. Still do.\n\nMy Dad and I listened to \"I Wanna Get Funky\" just about everyday when he had the congestive heart failure, we loved that record. Still do.\n\nGreat record! I've got that on vinyl somewhere in the basement. Isn't that the one where Albert is playing a Strat on the cover?"
