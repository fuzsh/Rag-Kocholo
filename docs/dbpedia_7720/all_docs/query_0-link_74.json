        "text": "(1923–92). U.S. blues musician Albert King created a unique string-bending guitar style that influenced three generations of musicians and earned him the nickname “Godfather of the Blues.” King, who was left-handed, taught himself to play a right-handed guitar upside down. By pulling the strings down, he coaxed distinctive wailing sounds out of his trademark Gibson Flying V guitar—named “Lucy”—that were widely imitated by such contemporary blues-rock performers as Jimi Hendrix, Joe Walsh, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Eric Clapton.\n\nBorn Albert Nelson on April 25, 1923, in Indianola, Mississippi, King was one of 13 children born to an itinerant preacher and his wife. When he was 8 years old, his widowed mother moved the family to eastern Arkansas, where he worked as a farmhand on a cotton plantation and later as a bulldozer operator. In the early 1950s, King moved to Gary, Indiana, joined the Chicago, Illinois-based music scene, and made his first recording, “Bad Luck Blues” (1953), for the Parrot label. In 1956, he moved to St. Louis, Missouri, in the hopes of achieving better financial success with a different record label.\n\nKing’s career took off in the 1960s after he joined Stax Records in Memphis, Tennessee, and released such acclaimed albums as Born Under a Bad Sign (1967) and Live Wire/Blues Power (1968). His music appealed to African American blues audiences as well as to white rock-music fans, who were beginning to develop an interest in blues. In the 1980s King captured a new generation of fans with the albums San Francisco ’83 (1983), Laundromat Blues (1984), and I’m in a Phone Booth, Baby (1984). He was inducted into the Blues Foundation’s Hall of Fame in 1983.\n\nKing continued to tour throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. He was preparing to start a major European tour when he died of a heart attack on December 21, 1992, in Memphis. King was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013."
