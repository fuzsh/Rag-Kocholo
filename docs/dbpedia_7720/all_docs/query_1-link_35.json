        "text": "Mississippi Blues Trail\n\nThe Mississippi Blues Trail marker commemorating Albert King is located in Indianola, Mississippi.\n\nThe front of the marker reads:\n\n“ALBERT KING – Albert King (1923-1992), who was billed as the ‘King of the Blues Guitar,’ was famed for his powerful string bending style as well as for his soulful, smoky vocals. King often said he was born in Indianola and was a half-brother of B.B. King, although the scant surviving official documentation suggests otherwise on both counts. King carved his own indelible niche in the blues hierarchy by creating a deep, dramatic sound that was widely imitated by both blues and rock guitarists.”\n\nThere is another marker a block away commemorating B.B. King’s corner.\n\nThe Albert King marker is located near the corner of 2nd Street and Front Avenue in downtown Indianola. Here is a map showing the location of the marker:\n\nHere is a Google Street View image of the Albert King marker:\n\nHere are some Albert King videos:\n\nOh Pretty Woman & Blues Power, Fillmore East, September 1970\n\nSwedish TV appearance, 1980\n\nTV appearance with Stevie Ray Vaughn, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada on 6 December, 1983\n\nMontreux Festival, 1989\n\nWould you like to leave a comment or question about anything on this page?"
