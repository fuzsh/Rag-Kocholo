        "text": "Recommend me some essentials. I have a few albums that I really like, but especially with BB, there is so much out there I don’t know where to go next. Typically if I see an Albert King LP in good shape I just buy it.\n\nI own:\n\nBB King - Live At The Regal\n\nBB King / Clapton - Riding With The King\n\nAlbert King - The Big Blues\n\nAlbert King - Born Under A Bad Sign\n\nAlbert King - Live Wire / Blues Power\n\nAlbert King - San Francisco ‘83\n\nAlbert King / SRV - In Session\n\nYou need Albert King \"I'll Play The Blues For You\" without a doubt as it is a totally essential title IMHO. Get the old non-remastered CD. I like the sound/mastering better than the expensive OOP SACD hybrid disc.\n\nYes, the Years Gone By album is solid Albert from 1969.\n\nALSO:\n\nThese two live albums were recorded at the same time as Live Wire/Blues Power:\n\nI recommend BOTH.\n\nI'd recommend the following...\n\nAlbert King:\n\n1967 Born Under A Bad Sign\n\n1968 King Does The King's Things (an Elvis Presley salute)\n\n1969 Years Gone By\n\n1972 I'll Play The Blues For You\n\nB.B. King:\n\n1961 My Kind of Blues (a relaxed quartet album, no horns)\n\n1962 Easy Listening Blues (an instrumental LP)\n\n1963 Blues In My Heart\n\n1968 Blues On Top Of Blues\n\n1968 Lucille\n\n1969 Live & Well\n\n1969 Completely Well\n\n1970 Indianola Mississippi Seeds\n\n::::-::Those three from 1969 and '70 were produced by Bill Szymczyk, who did a great job of raising B.B. King's profile.\n\n::_:::Dave Crawford produced the album below:\n\n1973 To Know You Is To Love You\n\nB.B. King continued to record prolifically into the 21st Century. He worked with a variety of producers and musicians, including Joe Sample of the Crusaders. He did a good job of keeping a toehold in contemporary music... a rarity for a blues artist. I don't rate the later albums that he did with Dave Crawford, but that first one from 1973 is very good and features Stevie Wonder.\n\nThere have been many compilations of his early recordings on the Bullet, RPM, Kent and Crown labels, as well as of his early-60's recordings on ABC-Paramount. A good comp is certainly worthwhile. I really enjoy the first three CD's from the box set, Ladies & Gentlemen... Mr. B.B. King. Unfortunately, those are not available individually. The rest of that box cherry-picks a few songs from each and every album through the decades that followed; not a winning formula, to my ears."
