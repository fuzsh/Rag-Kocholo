        "text": "Andreas GÃ¤bel came into contact with the music business at an early age. In 1985 he already played with musicians from Rias Big Band and other bands of the (West) Berlin music scene, from 1986 he regularly took part in studio recordings. He names Kenny Burrell, Wes Montgomery, Joe Pass, Pat Martino Albert King and B.B. King but also Frank Sinatra, Jimi Hendrix, Miles Davis, the Beatles and Johann Sebastian Bach as his musical role models and influences.\n\nRole models, but never copy templates: Andreas plays a style that is characterized by imaginative improvisations and pulsating grooves, but never neglects the melody or the musical context. He sees itself as a modern traditionalist who interprets his standard jazz repertoire in a modern way but would never sacrifice the authenticity of the music to modernity.\n\nCareer\n\nIn 1988 he started studying (classical) guitar with Laurie Randolph and Carlo Domeniconi at the HdK.-Berlin (today UdK.) He took jazz guitar lessons from Coco Schumann and Michael Gechter and received private lessons from Attila Zoller, Mike Stern, Mark Elf in New York in 1992 and from Joe Pass in Hamburg in 1992. Andreas has been working as a freelance guitarist since the beginning of the 90s, and since then has worked with artists such as Eartha Kitt, Udo JÃ¼rgens, Caterina Valente, Dionne Warwick, Roger Cicero and many others. Since 2002 Andreas has been playing regularly with his bands STAND-ARTS, JazzAgoGo and Nats Corner in clubs and at festivals."
