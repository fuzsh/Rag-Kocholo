        "meta_description": "In the big family tree of the history of blues guitar after BB King comes Albert King. When I was starting out I discovered BB first then Stevie Ray Vaughan but I was quickly informed that if I liked SRV then I really needed to listen to Albert Kingbr/>br/>And thats exactly right. I couldnt believe it: it was all the Stevie Ray licks but recorded in the 60s. Albert was the indisputably the master of bending building on what BB did and doing what no one had done before. You can hear his influence everywhere including Eric Claptons solo on Strange Brew being lifted from Alberts Pretty Woman.br/>br/>Albert King was a larger than life presence literally that well try to capture here. Up next well check out a performance in his style.",
