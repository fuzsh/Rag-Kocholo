        "text": "Right you are, mojosman. I don't even remember how many times he came to SF during the sixties, but it was several. I saw him at Fillmore West, I don't know how many times. I saw a King it had to be a dozen or more times. I would go multiple nights when I liked an act.\n\nHe wasn't tired and worn out back then. And he brought it all to the stage. I was always up front, and went away totally confused about how in the hell he could play the guitar like that. The first few times I saw him, I got caught up in the music and paid no attention to the technical stuff. Or I was with a hot date. Or something like that.\n\nHe really put on a great show and cooked all the way through. His band was always tight. I couldn't even tell you if it was the same band every time I saw him. Or the other Kings for that matter. But, they all were standouts. I didn't care what the first name was after I had seen them all. I would have shown up to hear Billie Jean King yodel by that time.\n\nI saw him in San Francisco... Filmore West, as I recall. Late 60's. I don't remember much detail about it... we went to concerts at Avalon Ballroom, Filmore, then Filmore West almost weekly, it seems... lots of concerts. (And we were feeling quite euphoric much of the time, I must admit.) Those were the days when Bill Graham was really growing the concert biz. I saw Bill introduce dozens and dozens of bands back then. Amazing times and music. I was 18 years old in 1968 and lived in the SF Bay Area. Bill Graham brought an incredible number of great bands to SF... in addition to showcasing the great bands that lived in SF!\n\nIn the late sixties, early seventies Albert King was really popular in the burgeoning rock scene, often on bills with British bands and San Francisco bands. He was my favorite of the Kings, for sure. I must have played his version of Crosscut Saw (the entire Born Under A Bad Sign album) enough to wear out the vinyl. Find these tracks on Spotify or YouTube or somewhere.. they are goodies. The Live Wire/Blues Power album is fantastic as well. Those are the two Albert King albums I listened to regularly back then."
