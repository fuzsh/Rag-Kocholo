        "text": "The theme was “pink” on May 16, when more than 10,000 fans turned out for the 10th annual Pink Knights game, presented by Charlotte Radiology and Belk, Inc. Complimentary pink baseballs were given to the first 2,500 ladies who arrived at the BB&T Ballpark. The Charlotte Knights also wore special pink jerseys, which were auctioned off during the game. While raising awareness for breast cancer prevention and early detection, the event also raised $18,225 to benefit diagnostic breast cancer services at Levine Cancer Institute.\n\n“The passion and support for such a worthy cause could be felt all around the stadium, said” Katie Robbins with Charlotte Radiology. ​\n\nSince 2011, Carolinas HealthCare System’s Levine Cancer Institute has partnered with Charlotte Radiology to provide preventative and diagnostic breast cancer screenings for uninsured women in the Charlotte area, a collaboration known as Project Pink.\n\nPhotos courtesy of L.
