(Bringing Awareness, Screening & Education to improve Survivorship) 4 Life improves access to cancer screenings, treatment and education in rural populations across our region.\n\nWe have two mobile CT scanning units – also known as “lung buses” – that travel to community sites to provide free screenings for lung cancer and head and neck cancer. Participants also receive one-on-one support from a nurse navigator, as well as help quitting tobacco use, if needed.\n\nTo qualify for a free screening, participants must:\n\nBe between the ages of 55 and 80\n\nBe uninsured, underinsured or have Medicaid coverage\n\nHave a 20 pack-year smoking history (equal to 1 pack a day for 20 years, or 2 packs a day for 10 years)\n\nCurrently smoke or have quit smoking within the last 15 years\n\nYou do not need to be an Atrium Health patient to qualify.\n\nFirefighters have higher rates of cancer than the general population due to exposure to hazardous materials on the job. Code T.O.M. (Taking on Melanoma and other high-risk cancers) is a free cancer education, screening and prevention program that aims to raise awareness and help firefighters protect their health.\n\nCode T.O.M. travels to firehouses across the region to host workshops that include:\n\nEducation about the risk factors, signs and symptoms of cancer\n\nTips for communicating with doctors about cancer risk\n\nAccess to free screenings that can catch cancer early\n\nThe program was created in honor of Tom Robinson, a dedicated husband, father and firefighter who died from advanced melanoma in 2013. His son, James Robinson, an Atrium Health teammate and volunteer firefighter, co-founded Code T.O.M. with LCI in 2016."
