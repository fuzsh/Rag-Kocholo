        "text": "If you or a loved one has recently been diagnosed with breast cancer, you aren't alone. According to the American Cancer Society®, breast cancer is the most common form of cancer detected in women.1\n\nWhile any cancer diagnosis can be unsettling, there are a number of practical tips and strategies that you can use to support your physical and mental health and keep you strong on your cancer journey.\n\n1. Connect With Your Feelings\n\nAnger. Fear. Sadness. Hope. A breast cancer diagnosis can bring up a range of emotions. Taking time to become more in tune with your feelings and emotions can help you navigate them as you start your cancer journey.2\n\nTrying to maintain an optimistic outlook may provide a beneficial boost to your health.3 But it's also important to know that it's normal and expected to feel periods of grief, frustration or worry.2 Talking about your feelings with friends, family and your cancer care team can help you process the emotions as well as help those around you try to understand how to support you.2\n\n2. Make Time for Mindfulness\n\nCancer can be stressful. From the shock of the initial diagnosis to treatment and the impacts on day-to-day living, making time to slow down and be mindful of small joys and simple pleasures can have a big impact on your mental outlook. Mindfulness has been shown to decrease stress, anxiety and blood pressure and improve emotional regulation.4\n\nMindful practices include any activity that cues our senses to pay attention to what's happening both inside us and around us. Some ideas:\n\nBreathing exercises\n\nSpending time in nature\n\nGoing for a walk\n\nCaring for plants\n\nChewing food slowly\n\nSavoring sight, sounds or smells you enjoy\n\nFocusing on any single task completely\n\n3. Lean on Your Tribe\n\nWhile you may pride yourself on your self-reliance, a breast cancer diagnosis may eventually make it difficult to maintain some elements of your previous lifestyle. Turning to your tribe of friends and family can help with tasks of all kinds:\n\nShopping\n\nMeal preparation\n\nHousehold tasks\n\nTransportation to and from appointments\n\nPicking up medications\n\nCaring for pets\n\nWhether it's your childhood BFFs or a collection of neighbors, colleagues, cousins or college friends, leaning on your network during times of trial can not only help lighten your load but also empower them to support you during your cancer journey.2\n\n4. Join a Support Group\n\nWhile your friends and family may offer valuable support, a breast cancer support group can put you in touch with people who truly understand what you're going through since they are going through it, too.\n\nThere are a variety of breast cancer support group options to choose from, including groups for those: 5\n\nRecently diagnosed\n\nExperiencing a recurrence\n\nUndergoing certain kinds of breast cancer treatment\n\nOf a certain gender or age group\n\nFrom tips and advice to hearing stories of hope and survival, a support group can provide both practical and psychological support to help you stay positive.5\n\n5. Prioritize Self-Care Practices\n\nFor some, a breast cancer diagnosis, reactions to treatments and whether or not the cancer spreads can feel like a loss of control. While manicures and bubble baths won't take any of that away, they can help boost your mood and support your resilience. Self-care practices like journaling, music, massage, aromatherapy or beauty treatments have been found to help reduce stress, improve mental outlook and remind patients what they have power over.6\n\n6. Consider Professional Counseling\n\nA breast cancer diagnosis not only impacts your physical health — it can also impact your family, finances, career and friendships. Seeking professional counseling or therapy can provide a safe space to share your feelings as well as learn strategies to implement to support you as you navigate the far-reaching changes that cancer can have.5\n\nWhile many individuals can benefit from such counseling services, if you have the following symptoms or moods that persist for more than two weeks or concern you, contact your healthcare team for a referral:2\n\nFeelings of sadness or hopelessness\n\nSleep issues\n\nFatigue\n\nHeart palpitations\n\nDifficulty concentrating\n\nDisinterest in hobbies or activities you normally enjoy\n\n7. Maintain Healthy Habits\n\nIt may be tempting to throw healthy habits out of the window in frustration if you've been diagnosed with breast cancer, but nutritious foods and regular exercise are important keys in providing your body with the physical energy to handle cancer treatments and the mental reinforcements to keep your mind positive.7\n\nFor some people, cancer and its treatments can make eating more difficult or less enjoyable, so you may need to adjust your diet to ensure you are getting adequate protein, fat, carbs, vitamins and minerals.7\n\nStaying physically active after a cancer diagnosis can also offer a number of benefits to help your body and mind deal with the side effects of treatment:8\n\nBuild stamina\n\nImprove sleep quality\n\nDecrease anxiety and depression\n\nStrengthen the immune system\n\nIncrease appetite\n\n8. Strengthen Your Spiritual Practice\n\nWhile science hasn't found that spirituality or prayer can cure cancer, studies have suggested that strengthening your spiritual practice may result in reduced stress and anxiety and a more positive outlook in dealing with a breast cancer diagnosis.9\n\nOne study reported that 92% of participants who had higher levels of spirituality demonstrated by participation in religious services, prayer and belief in a higher power showed improved mental health benefits.9\n\n9. Find a Cancer Mentor\n\nWhile you may have only heard of mentors for spiritual or career growth, a cancer mentor can provide invaluable one-to-one assistance with emotional support, practical tips, resource suggestions and a true understanding of what you are going through.\n\nAccording to the National Cancer Institute, cancer patients who utilize one-to-one mentors are more likely to complete cancer treatment, have higher survival rates, have lower recurrence rates and report an improved quality of life. 10\n\nSome organizations and networks you can use to help find or become a mentor include:\n\nAfter Breast Cancer Diagnosis\n\nImerman Angels\n\nOncoLink\n\n10. Spend Time With Pets\n\nSpending time with your favorite furry friend may have benefits for your mental outlook after a breast cancer diagnosis. According to the American Psychiatric Association, 86% of both cat and dog owners report that pets have a positive impact on their mental health, including reducing stress, increasing a sense of calm and providing support and companionship.11\n\nWhile furry friends can offer a number of stress-reducing benefits, pet owners recently diagnosed with breast cancer may want to discuss pet safety with their healthcare team. Some pets may put cancer patients at an increased chance of exposure to viruses or infections. Certain cancer treatments like chemotherapy may also endanger pets who nose through the trash or sneak drinks out of the toilet.12\n\nHaving a plan in place for taking care of a pet if you are away from home for treatment or too ill to care for them can help you feel at ease knowing your beloved pet will be taken care of.12\n\n11. Seek Out Survivor Stories\n\nAnother way to boost your morale after a breast cancer diagnosis is to seek out stories of breast cancer survivors. Research suggests that hearing stories, tips and advice from others who have navigated through a breast cancer diagnosis and treatment can help improve an individual's outlook on their own cancer journey, as well as provide valuable resources and practical coping strategies.13 Breast cancer survivor stories can be found online at Breastcancer.org, Susan G Komen or the National Cancer Institute, among others.\n\nManaging Health and Wellness Costs With the CareCredit Credit Card\n\nIf you are looking for an option to help manage your health and wellness costs, consider financing with the CareCredit credit card.
