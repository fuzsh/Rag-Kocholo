Knowledge is power, and Pink Hope gave me the power to take control of my health journey and I’m so glad they did.\"\n\nWendy\n\n“My message to other young women is you need to be your own health advocate and to do that you need to know your own body. You can read as many symptoms as you like but they are not the same for everybody. Take the time to get to know your own body and if something doesn’t feel right know that it probably isn’t.\n\nI am living proof that breast cancer and ovarian cancer do not just affect old people.\"\n\nMonika\n\n“My biggest piece of advice and my biggest lesson through this journey is to always, always, always trust your instincts – pressure your doctor, don’t take no for an answer and make sure you get the medical attention you need and deserve. I tell my girlfriends that it doesn’t matter the size of your breasts, your age, your family history even your health, breast cancer will find you if you don’t find it.\"\n\nMelinda"
