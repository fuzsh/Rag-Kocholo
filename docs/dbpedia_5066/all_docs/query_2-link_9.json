        "text": "Pink in colour and a recognised symbol of hope, the ribbon represents the millions of people around the world who have been affected by this disease and its many types.\n\nWith over 2.3 million cases reported in 2020, breast cancer became the most diagnosed cancer worldwide. The diversity of this disease, however, continues to be underappreciated.\n\nAt Roche, we believe that a single shade of pink is not representative of the many stories and distinct journeys of people affected by this disease. Each person has a unique story and deserves her own shade of pink to reflect it.\n\nWe wish to highlight the vast diversity of backgrounds and unparalleled experiences endured by people affected by breast cancer all around the world.Â\n\nWe wish to amplify every personâs voice.\n\nWe wish to make it known that breast cancer is not a one-size-fits-all disease.\n\nTherefore, each person deserves the best approach to diagnosis possible, leading to Â a tailored and personalised treatment plan that reflects their own personal journey with breast cancer, no matter the type or stage of this disease."
