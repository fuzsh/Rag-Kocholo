        "text": "(Montgomery, AL) – In solidarity with Breast Cancer Awareness Month, the Montgomery Regional Airport (MGM) held a unique initiative to raise awareness and support for those affected by breast cancer with its PINK POWER DAY.\n\nThe one-day event is an opportunity for MGM to symbolize its commitment to the fight against breast cancer. As part of this initiative, passengers traveling through the airport will be greeted with an array of pink-themed treats, cookies, and buttons designed to bring attention to this vital cause.\n\nBreast Cancer Awareness Month is a powerful reminder of the strength and resilience of those facing this disease and the importance of early detection and prevention. MGM is honored to participate in this awareness campaign alongside survivors, caregivers, and advocates worldwide.\n\n“We are proud to go pink in support of Breast Cancer Awareness Month,” said Brittney Jones-Dabney, Communications and Marketing Manager at MGM. “By offering pink treats to our passengers, we hope to spark conversations and increase awareness about this critical issue. Together, we can make a difference in the lives of those affected by breast cancer.”\n\nPassengers can expect to find an assortment of pink-themed cookies, buttons and resources from the Joy to Life Foundation available at the Information Desk within the airport. There will also be a chance for passengers to take a photo with the life-sized breast cancer ribbon balloons provided by Brooke Ashley Ballons. Brooke, the company’s owner, says she plans to donate a portion of the proceeds to reputable cancer organizations.\n\nMGM encourages all travelers, employees, and stakeholders to join this important cause. Through collective efforts, we can impact the lives of individuals and families affected by breast cancer.\n\nMontgomery Regional Airport (MGM) is a key gateway to the capital city of Alabama, connecting passengers to daily flights offered by American Airlines and Delta Airlines to Atlanta, Georgia (ATL); Charlotte, North Carolina (CLT); Dallas, Texas (DFW), and Washington, D.C. (DCA) and endless connections worldwide. With a commitment to excellence in customer service, safety, and community engagement, MGM strives to provide a seamless and enjoyable travel experience for all passengers.
