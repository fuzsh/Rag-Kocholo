        "text": "Did you know the Medicare numbers for prophylactic surgeries related to breast and ovarian cancer risk are the same as those used when patients have surgery after a cancer diagnosis? Eg. if you have your ovaries removed for risk reduction or ovaries removed after an ovarian cancer diagnosis - the same Medicare number is used. Same for mastectomy. So it's really hard to find data for patients who are having risk reduction surgeries. This is one of the reasons we are collecting data from the hereditary cancer community. We want to get a National picture of the experiences and decisions people in our community are making so we can tailor our support, education and resources better. With information and data, we can advocate for changes and improvements for those with hereditary cancer risk. Please encourage your patients/friends/family members to complete this important survey. Every experience is different and we want to hear about all of them. #hereditarycancer #BRCA #PALB2 #CHEK2 #RAD51C #ATM #familycancerhistory #Lynchsyndrome #pinkhopeaus Sarah Powell\n\nYour experience matters: take our Hereditary Cancer Survey! We are conducting a national survey to understand the experience and challenges of our community impacted by hereditary cancer. Who should participate: ‚û°Ô∏è Individuals with gene mutations related to breast, ovarian, and/or prostate cancer. ‚û°Ô∏è Those with a significant family history of these cancers. Why participate: ‚û°Ô∏è Shape our future: Your insights will shape our support services and advocacy efforts. ‚û°Ô∏è Share your story: Every experience is different; we want to hear them all. How to participate: ‚û°Ô∏è Take the survey: It's anonymous and only takes between 10-20 minutes. ‚û°Ô∏è Spread the word: Share the survey and assist others in completing it. Help us drive change for your family, and families like yours. Survey closes on 2 June, take the survey now: https://lnkd.in/guDNUkJe #survey #hereditarycancer #positivechange #pinkhopeaus Sarah Powell Lisa Caterina Robyn Smith Charlotte Durazza Carol Leung Georgia Elliott Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre Genetic Support Network of Victoria Australian Genomics Eugene\n\nYesterday, our collaborators from The Institute of Cancer Research and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust presented groundbreaking data at #ASCO24. In a study of 78 patients with breast cancer (23 TNBC, 35 HER2+, 18 HR+ and 2 unknown), our ultra-sensitive NeXT Personal¬Æ assay found that 100% of patients with undetectable residual disease in repeat testing did not have cancer recurrence. ctDNA detection correctly identified disease recurrence with a 15-month median lead time in all 14 patients that relapsed. NeXT Personal demonstrated 100% sensitivity and specificity across repeat testing.

Breast cancer in men is unusual, but men with a BRCA mutation have as high as a one in 20 chance of developing breast cancer. Because of this, men with BRCA variants should perform breast self-exams every month starting at age 35 and should discuss their family history with their doctor. Men with a family history of breast cancer should consider Hereditary Cancer Risk Screening to help detect BRCA mutations. Men who have a BRCA1/2 inherited gene mutation can also have an increased risk of prostate cancer. üîó Learn more about Hereditary Cancer Risk Screening here: https://ow.ly/34n150Q0PLG #BreastCancerAwareness #EarlyDetectionSavesLives #BreastCancerSupport\n\n‚ùó#DYK It‚Äòs not just women who can be diagnosed with breast cancer.

Watch here ‚û°Ô∏èhttps://lnkd.in/gjTTYnAM In this short video, Michelle Morand ‚Äì Precision Cancer Medicine Advocacy specialist ‚Äì explains the main difference between standard genetic testing and tumor DNA sequencing‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶And why all patients should be getting comprehensive sequencing done if they want to access the most effective treatment for their cancer.

This area of study holds immense potential, not just in understanding the intricacies of individual cancer cells but also in charting the course for future treatments. A standout quote from the article beautifully encapsulates this hope: ‚ÄúSingle-cell research has the potential to revolutionize cancer research, particularly for rare cancer patients. By studying a single cell, researchers can observe its unique characteristics, such as genetic mutations and other biomarkers, that may distinguish it from other cancers.‚Äù Delve into the details and stay informed about the strides being made in the fight against rare cancers: https://lnkd.in/gUyUV_4z We encourage you to read, reflect, and share this piece. By staying informed, we strengthen our collective resolve and empower our community to continue pushing the boundaries. #RareCancerResearch #SingleCellResearch #RareCancerWarriors #JediRareCancerFoundation #rarecancerisntrare #rarecancertreatment #donatetoday\n\nüéó Breast Cancer Statistics: A Global Perspective üåç Did you know? ü§îThe top ten countries for breast cancer rates are 90% European. Shockingly, when it comes to breast cancer deaths, the stats are 100% non-European, with 4 of the 10, including the top spot, being Caribbean.üìâ This disparity highlights the urgent need for specialized research to understand the genetic factors that impact this demographic, specifically in the Caribbean. At CariGenetics, we're committed to bridging this gap. üî¨Our ongoing research delves deep into the unique genetic makeup of individuals of Caribbean descent to better diagnose, prevent, and treat breast cancer more effectively.üß¨ Join us in this crucial mission. Together, we can shed light on these disparities and work towards a healthier future for everyone!üí™üèæ #BreastCancerStatistics #BreastCancerDeathRate #CaribbeanAncestry #CariGeneticsResearch #CaribbeanCancerResearch #CariGenetics #BreastCancerResearch #CaribbeanCancerResearch #Didyouknow #Bermuda #breastcancerawarenessmonth #cancerresearch #breastcancerresearch #caribbeanwomen\n\nBack in November, the GCI hosted a seminar on \"Knowledge Mobilization to Extend the Impact and Access of Evidence-Based Gynecologic Cancer Interventions in BC\" at the BC Cancer Summit 2023. With incredible speakers from across Canada and North America, the session highlighted several of the most promising #gynecologiccancer interventions to date. The session used a #knowledgemobilization lens to ignite engaging conversations regarding existing barriers to access and implementation, and how collaborative work can be used to overcome them. These interventions include: üíú Cervical Cancer Self-Collection üíú Molecular Stratification for Endometrial Cancer üíú Identification and Stratification of Vulvar Cancer Pre-cancerous and Invasive Lesions üíú Opportunistic Salpingectomy üíú Genetic Testing for Ovarian and Endometrial Cancer Learn more about these interventions and future directions through our GCI seminar recap article below! - #gynecologiccancer #gynecancer #interventions #cancerintervention #ovariancancer #endometrialcancer #uterinecancer #vulvarcancer #vaginalcancer #cervicalcancer #hpvtest #cancerprevention #cancerrisk #bisalp #opportunisticsalpingectomy #womenshealth #bccancer"
