        "text": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide and the second-most common cancer overall. In 2015, an estimated 231,840 cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. alone. Many nonprofit organizations are dedicated to researching, supporting affected families, and working to find a cure for breast cancer. However, breast cancer is a large issue that requires multiple social impact organizations to combat the disease in different ways.\n\nIn honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we’ve found 11 nonprofit organizations that are fighting this disease from different angles. All of these organizations provide a variety of programs, but we’ve highlighted the special initiatives that help them stand out.\n\n1. Bright Pink\n\nBright Pink is the only national nonprofit organization focused on prevention and early detection of breast cancer and ovarian cancers in young women. They aim to reach the 52 million young women in the United States between the ages of 18 and 45 with their innovative, life-saving breast and ovarian health programs, with the hopes of empowering this and future generations of women to live healthier, happier, and longer lives.\n\nBright Pink offers Brighten Up ® Educational Workshops to educate and inspire young women to be proactive advocates for their health. Facilitated by a certified Bright Pink education ambassador, these 20-minute presentations, delivered at workplaces, faith-based institutions, community centers and other gathering places, ground participants in the basics of breast and ovarian health, introduce them to the idea of different lifetime risk levels, provide early detection and prevention strategies, and equip them with life-saving knowledge that will inspire them to take action.\n\n“In just 20 minutes, Brighten Up® Workshop equips women with life-saving tools. Since launching in the Summer of 2013, the Brighten Up® Workshops have educated more than 30,000 people (more than 50,000 by the end of 2015).” – Erin Williams\n\nBright Pink also has an annual FitFest – a fitness marathon to save lives from breast and ovarian cancers. FitFest is a one-of-a-kind event that gives participants the chance to directly impact how these cancers are prevented. Each dollar raised goes to life-saving breast and ovarian cancer prevention programs for young women and the medical community who cares for them.\n\nGet more information on how education encourages women to be proactive about their health.\n\n2. Breast Cancer Research Foundation\n\nThe Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF) is a nonprofit organization committed to achieving prevention and a cure for breast cancer. They provide critical funding for worldwide cancer research to fuel advances in tumor biology, genetics, prevention, treatment, metastasis and survivorship. Since their founding in 1993 by Evelyn H. Lauder, BCRF has raised over half a billion dollars in lifesaving research. In 2014-2015, BCRF will award $47 million in annual grants to more than 235 scientists from top universities and medical institutions around the globe.\n\nBecause breast cancer is a complex disease with no simple solution, BCRF is dedicated to having their researchers tackle it from every angle. Areas of focus include:\n\nTumor biology\n\nHeredity and ethnicity\n\nLifestyle and prevention\n\nTreatment\n\nSurvivorship\n\nMetastasis\n\nThe Breast Cancer Research Foundation fundraises in a variety of ways. Individual donors can give online through one-time or monthly payments. There is also the opportunity to create your own fundraiser, attend a signature event or purchase a product from one of BCRF’s partners.\n\nLearn more about how you can provide critical funding for cancer research.\n\n3. National Breast Cancer Foundation\n\nThe National Breast Cancer Foundation (NBCF) is dedicated to helping women now by providing help and inspiring hope to those affected by breast cancer. Their focus is on early detection, education and support services. With increased healthcare costs and a rapidly increasing percentage of uninsured women, many unfortunately cannot afford the cost of screening tests. That’s why NBCF provides free mammograms to women in all 50 states through their network of hospitals.\n\nNBCF is a stabilizing force in the lives of hundreds of thousands of women who have reached a crossroad in their lives and need help crossing the bridge. NBCF offers free, innovative programs that differentiate them from other nonprofit organizations combating breast cancer. These programs include:\n\nNational Mammography Program – Free mammograms and diagnostic breast care services\n\nBeyond The Shock – Comprehensive video series about breast cancer\n\nEarly Detection Plan – Tool to receive reminders to do breast self-exams and schedule your clinical breast exams and mammograms\n\nBreast Health Awareness – In-person training sessions, materials provided at events, online training modules\n\nPatient Navigator Program – Locate medical facilities in NBCF’s network\n\nLearn how to provide a mammogram for a woman in need.\n\n4. Lynne Cohen Foundation\n\nThe Lynne Cohen Foundation serves women facing increased risk for ovarian and breast cancers. With education programs and comprehensive care clinics, they arm these women and their families with the knowledge, tools, and clinical support needed to take action early, survive, and thrive. There are three main areas of focus including prevention, education and connection.\n\nPrevention\n\nPreventive care clinics house multi-disciplinary teams of doctors and specialists dedicated to assessing a woman’s risk, implementing a management plan, and supporting her along the way.\n\nEducation\n\nEducational opportunities provided by the Lynne Cohen Foundation range from the clinic to the living room, and provide women with the knowledge, tools and insights needed to feel aware, safe and supported. They deliver health education and cancer awareness to women who need it. Initiatives like The Peony Project bring people together in living room settings to learn from top medical specialists and lifestyle experts, to ask questions, to express hopes and fears, and to connect with one another.\n\nConnection\n\nKickin’ Cancer ® events provide a way to get sweaty for the cause, make new friends and celebrate life. Kickin’ Cancer® events raise breast cancer awareness, contribute life-saving knowledge on a community level, and promote a fundraising for an event.\n\nLearn more about how you can support the foundation.\n\n5.

We meet young people where they are, try to take the stigma out of the language and empower them with the education to make the best personal choices.

By developing the “Free Check Yourself App”, supporters can learn the techniques needed to perform a monthly self-exams and set a reminder to do so. They encourage their supporters to post their “breast” selfie on social media and share with others that early detection is key.\n\nThey can do this by:\n\nSelfie: Snap a selfie with three fingers to your breast, symbolizing your monthly commitment to checking yourself.\n\nChallenge: Challenge three friends to take the pledge by tagging them and letting them know why it’s important to you.\n\nShare: Share your photo on social media and tag it with #CHECKYOURSELFIE\n\nWith this simple pledge, so far 50,058 videos have been viewed, 15,536 apps have been downloaded, and 4,959 selfies have been taken.\n\nLearn how you can #CHECKYOURSELFIE.\n\n6.
