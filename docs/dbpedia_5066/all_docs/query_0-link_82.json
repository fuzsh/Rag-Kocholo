        "text": "Cancer\n\nWhat is cancer?\n\nCancer is a large group of diseases that can start in almost any organ or tissue of the body when abnormal cells grow uncontrollably, go beyond their usual boundaries to invade adjoining parts of the body and/or spread to other organs. The latter process is called metastasizing and is a major cause of death from cancer. A neoplasm and malignant tumour are other common names for cancer.\n\nWhat are the most common types of cancer?\n\nLung, prostate, colorectal, stomach and liver cancer are the most common types of cancer in men, while breast, colorectal, lung, cervical and thyroid cancer are the most common among women.\n\nWhat causes cancer?\n\nCancer arises from the transformation of normal cells into tumour cells in a multi-stage process that generally progresses from a pre-cancerous lesion to a malignant tumour. These changes are the result of the interaction between a person's genetic factors and three categories of external agents, including:\n\nphysical carcinogens, such as ultraviolet and ionizing radiation;\n\nchemical carcinogens, such as asbestos, components of tobacco smoke, aflatoxin (a food contaminant), and arsenic (a drinking water contaminant); and\n\nbiological carcinogens, such as infections from certain viruses, bacteria, or parasites.\n\nWhat are some of the risk factors for cancer?\n\nTobacco use, alcohol use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and air pollution are risk factors for cancer (and other noncommunicable diseases). Some chronic infections are risk factors for cancer. This is a particular issue in low- and middle-income countries. Approximately 13% of cancers diagnosed globally were attributed to carcinogenic infections, including Helicobacter pylori, human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and Epstein-Barr virus. Hepatitis B and C viruses and some types of HPV increase the risk for liver and cervical cancer, respectively. Infection with HIV substantially increases the risk of cancers such as cervical cancer.\n\nHow can we reduce the cancer burden?\n\nBetween 30% and 50% of cancers can currently be prevented by avoiding risk factors and implementing existing evidence-based prevention strategies.\n\nThe cancer burden can also be reduced through early detection of cancer and appropriate treatment and care of patients who develop cancer.\n\nMany cancers have a high chance of cure if diagnosed early and treated appropriately.\n\nHow can we prevent cancer?\n\nCancer risk can be reduced by:\n\nnot using tobacco;\n\nmaintaining a healthy body weight;\n\neating a healthy diet, including fruit and vegetables;\n\ndoing physical activity on a regular basis;\n\navoiding harmful use of alcohol;\n\ngetting vaccinated against HPV and hepatitis B if you belong to a group for which vaccination is recommended;\n\navoiding ultraviolet radiation (which primarily results from exposure to the sun and artificial tanning devices);\n\nensuring safe and appropriate use of radiation in health care (for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes);\n\nminimizing occupational exposure to ionizing radiation; and\n\nreducing exposure to outdoor air pollution and indoor air pollution, including radon (a radioactive gas produced from the natural decay of uranium, which can accumulate in buildings — homes, schools and workplaces).\n\nEarly detection\n\nCancer deaths can be reduced if cases are detected and treated early. There are two components of early detection:\n\nEarly diagnosis\n\nWhen identified early, cancer is more likely to respond to treatment and can result in a greater probability of survival and less morbidity, as well as less expensive treatment. Significant improvements can be made in the lives of cancer patients by detecting cancer early and avoiding delays in care.\n\nEarly diagnosis consists of three components:\n\nbeing aware of the symptoms of different forms of cancer and of the importance of seeking medical advice if you are concerned;\n\naccess to clinical evaluation and diagnostic services; and\n\ntimely referral to treatment services.\n\nEarly diagnosis of symptomatic cancers is relevant in all settings and the majority of cancers. Cancer programmes should be designed to reduce delays in, and barriers to, diagnosis, treatment and care.\n\nScreening\n\nScreening aims to identify individuals with findings suggestive of a specific cancer or pre-cancer before they have developed symptoms. When abnormalities are identified during screening, further tests to establish (or not) a diagnosis should follow, as should referral for treatment if needed.\n\nScreening programmes are effective for some but not all cancer types and in general are far more complex and resource-intensive than early diagnosis as they require special equipment and dedicated personnel.\n\nPatient selection for screening programmes is based on age and risk factors to avoid excessive false positive studies. Examples of screening methods are:\n\nHPV testing for cervical cancer;\n\nthe PAP cytology test for cervical cancer;\n\nvisual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) for cervical cancer; and\n\nmammography screening for breast cancer in settings with strong or relatively strong health systems.\n\nQuality assurance is required for both screening and early diagnosis programmes.\n\nTreatment\n\nA correct cancer diagnosis is essential for appropriate and effective treatment because every cancer type requires a specific treatment regimen. Treatment usually includes radiotherapy, chemotherapy and/or surgery. Determining the goals of treatment is an important first step. The primary goal is generally to cure cancer or to considerably prolong life. Improving the patient's quality of life is also an important goal. This can be achieved by support for the patient’s physical, psychosocial and spiritual well-being and palliative care in terminal stages of cancer.\n\nSome of the most common cancer types, such as breast cancer, cervical cancer, oral cancer and colorectal cancer, have high cure rates when detected early and treated according to best practices. Some cancer types, such as testicular seminoma and different types of leukaemia and lymphoma in children, also have high cure rates if appropriate treatment is provided, even when cancerous cells are present in other areas of the body.\n\nPalliative care\n\nPalliative care is treatment to relieve, rather than cure, symptoms caused by cancer and to improve the quality of life of patients and their families. Palliative care can help people live more comfortably. It is particularly needed in places with a high proportion of patients in advanced stages of cancer where there is little chance of cure.\n\nRelief from physical, psychosocial and spiritual problems through palliative care is possible for more than 90% of patients with advanced stages of cancer. Effective public health strategies, comprising community- and home-based care, are essential to provide pain relief and palliative care for patients and their families. Improved access to oral morphine is strongly recommended for the treatment of moderate to severe cancer pain, suffered by over 80% of people with cancer in the terminal phase."
