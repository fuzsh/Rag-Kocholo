        "text": "Cancer is a leading cause of death in the Americas. In 2022, cancer accounted for 1.4 million deaths, 45.1% of which occurred in people of 69 years-old or younger.\n\nThe number of cancer cases in the Americas in 2020 is estimated in 4.2 million cases, and it is projected to increase to 6 million in 2045, representing an increase in 59.3%.\n\nAbout a third of all cancer cases could be prevented by avoiding key risk factors. These include tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity. Vaccination and screening programmes are effective interventions to reduce the burden of specific types of cancer. Many cancers have a high chance of cure if detected early and treated adequately.\n\nKey facts\n\nIn the Region of the Americas:\n\nThe most frequently diagnosed types of cancer in men are: prostate (8.6%), lung (11.7%), colorectal (10.2%) and bladder (5.9%).\n\nThe most frequently diagnosed types of cancer in women are: breast (30.7%), lung (10.3%), colorectal (9.6%) and uterus (6.4%).\n\nThe types of cancer with the highest mortality rates in men are: lung (20.6%), prostate (14.5%), colorectal (10.6%), pancreas (7.0%) and liver (6.6%).\n\nThe cancers that cause the highest number of deaths in women are: lung (18.4%), breast (17.5%), colorectal (10.6%) and pancreas (7.2%).\n\nAlmost 500,000 new cases of breast cancer and more than 100,000 deaths from breast cancer were registered in the region.\n\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean:\n\nMore than 56,000 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer in Latin America and the Caribbean and more than 28,000 lost their lives.\n\nFact sheet\n\nAll people, both collectively and individually, can contribute to reducing the cancer burden.\n\nIndividually, people can:\n\nTalk to their doctor about their risk of cancer and how to reduce it\n\nParticipate in cancer screening and early detection programs\n\nAdopt healthy lifestyles to reduce cancer risks\n\nAdvocate for better access to cancer screening and treatment services\n\nIf they or a loved one has had cancer, share their experiences with others\n\nSupport people living with cancer\n\nUnderstand that early detection and early treatment save lives.\n\nCollectively, we can:\n\nPrevent cancer\n\nDetect cancer early and improve treatment results\n\nCreate health-promoting public policies to reduce cancer risk factors\n\nEnsure palliative care policies and access to pain medications\n\nImprove access to cancer care and cancer treatments\n\nDemonstrate the need to invest in cancer detection, treatment and research\n\nBetter understand the causes and risk factors of cancer and how to prevent it\n\nTrain health professionals to join the fight against cancer\n\nEducate and inform the public about cancer.\n\nPAHO Response\n\nPAHO is working with countries in the Americas to reduce premature deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including cancer, by 25% by the year 2025. Through PAHO's NCD plan of action, launched in 2013, PAHO promotes the reduction of tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol, promotes healthy diet and increased physical activity, supports the introduction of HPV vaccines and HPV testing to prevent cervical cancer, and promotes improvements in quality and access to early diagnosis of breast cancer. PAHO also supports improvements in radiotherapy services and access to affordable essential chemotherapy drugs; and promotes the expansion of palliative care policies, programs and opioids for pain relief and symptom management.\n\nStrategies proposed by PAHO/WHO to reduce the risk of cancer and other noncommunicable diseases include:\n\nIncreasing taxes, restricting access, and warning about the dangers of tobacco and harmful use of alcohol\n\nPromoting public awareness about healthy diet, physical activity and healthy weight\n\nImmunizing infants against hepatitis B to prevent liver cancer, and immunizing girls against human papillomavirus to prevent cervical cancer\n\nOrganizing screening programs for cervical cancer and breast cancer to detect them at early stages, when they are more amenable to treatment"
