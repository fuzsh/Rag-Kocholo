        "text": "Breast Cancer Awareness Month has been celebrated every October since the nineties. It is called 'Pink October' as people around the world adopt the pink colour and display a pink ribbon to raise awareness about breast health.\n\nWhat is Breast Cancer Awareness Month?\n\nBreast Cancer Awareness Month has been celebrated every October for the last 90 years. It is called \"Pink October\" as people around the world adopt the pink colour and display a pink ribbon to raise awareness about the importance of prevention and routine screening for the early diagnosis of breast cancer, now the second most commonly diagnosed cancer globally.\n\nDiscover UICC’s Breast Cancer programme and its activities for breast cancer control.\n\nBreast cancer prevention and symptoms\n\nAn estimated 30% of breast cancer cases are attributed to modifiable risk factors, understand what you can do to reduce your breast cancer risk.\n\nReduce your risk of breast cancer by making better behavioural choices which include:\n\nmaintaining a healthy weight\n\nstaying physically active\n\navoiding harmful use of alcohol\n\nbreastfeeding\n\nquitting tobacco use and avoiding exposure to tobacco smoke\n\navoiding the prolonged use of hormones\n\navoiding excessive exposure to radiation\n\nIf you think you have one or more of the above symptoms, seek medical care immediately. Although these could be caused by a non-cancerous mass, an exam is required for proper diagnosis.\n\nSymptoms of breast cancer include:\n\nchange in nipple appearance or alteration in the skin surrounding the nipple (areola)\n\nbloody or abnormal nipple discharge\n\na lump or thickening in the breast\n\nchange in breast colour\n\npitting of the breast skin\n\nbreast or nipple pain\n\n1 in 12 women are predicted to be diagnosed with #breastcancer in their lifetime. How will you help raise awareness this #BreastCancerAwarenessMonth? @uicc\n\nSource: IARC\n\nEvery 50 seconds, somewhere in the world a woman dies from #breastcancer. Systematic improvements are needed in breast health promotion, early detection, timely diagnosis and treatment. @uicc\n\nSource: Globocan\n\nIn 2022, there were an estimated 669,418 deaths from #breastcancer, with a disproportionate number of these deaths occurring in low-resource settings. Raise your voice this #breastcancer awareness month! @uicc\n\nSource: Globocan\n\nDid you know that breast cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer across the globe? Let's stand together and raise awareness. Our collective efforts can change the trajectory of this disease. #breastcancer @uicc\n\nSource: Globocan\n\n23% of breast cancer cases are preventable. Taking steps such as maintaining a healthy weight, limiting your alcohol intake and quitting smoking, can help reduce the risk. #breastcancer @uicc\n\nSource: CRUK\n\nBreast cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide and the leading cause of cancer deaths among women. The goal: reduce breast cancer mortality by 2.5% per year.\n\nHow?\n\nDiagnose breast cancer at an early stage\n\nDeliver a diagnosis in 60 days\n\nEnable patients to access multimodal treatment\n\nOver a 20-year period this could save 2.5 million lives. #GBCI @uicc\n\nSource: GBCI\n\n#Breastcancer deaths disproportionately affect individuals in low- and middle-income countries. In high-income countries, the five-year survival rates exceed 90%, while they remain at 66% in India and 40% in South Africa. @uicc #GBCI\n\nSource: GBCI\n\nSince the 1980s, there has been a 40% reduction in #breastcancer mortality in high-income countries. This has yet to be achieved in the majority of low- and middle-income countries. @uicc #GBCI\n\nSource: GBCI\n\nDownload the social media cards\n\nBreast Cancer Awareness Month videos\n\nUICC members during Breast Cancer Awareness Month\n\nDiscover previous Breast Cancer Awareness Month campaigns from UICC members. They aimed to raise awareness around breast cancer through multiple channels and regions:\n\nIn China, the Global Chinese Breast Cancer Organizations Alliance organised the hybrid event “Building lives with miracles” (with translation in English) and they intended to break a world record with a fitness challenge.\n\nIn Ivory Coast, Hope Life organised Slam Rose, a contest of urban poetry to grow awareness about breast cancer in the younger population.\n\nIn Egypt, Baheya lit the pyramids in pink and launched the “30 days in Pink” campaign.\n\nIn Mexico, Fundación CIMA launched a virtual sportive event in which participants could walk, run, swim, bike and more, to support breast cancer patients.\n\nIn Lebanon, the Bread Exam is a bread recipe that implicitly teaches women how to self-check for breast cancer.\n\nTo learn how to design messaging and campaigns that appeal to the public based on design-thinking principles and hear from past campaigns of UICC members, you can watch the Virtual Dialogue on “Rethinking Pink October – how to increase engagement with the public virtually”.\n\nPlease share your own BCAM campaign through the ICCP portal and view other campaigns from UICC members on the ICCP resource library.\n\nBreast cancer is the second most diagnosed cancer globally.\n\nIn the last decade, UICC has launched a series of initiatives to encourage early detection and improve access to treatment and care.\n\nThis page regroups resources on breast cancer control such as infographics, videos and articles.\n\nUICC’s Breast Cancer programme is designed to respond to the urgent need to accelerate progress in breast cancer.\n\nLast update\n\nWednesday 07 February 2024\n\nShare this page"
