        "text": "From colder weather to browning leaves, October is a time where change is all around us. October is also Breast Cancer Awareness Month, a time where we focus our attention on creating change for those affected by the disease.\n\nWhile getting involved in the efforts to support the month-long initiative might look a little different this year, there are still plenty of ways to raise awareness, even while you're at home. Bobbie Thomas has rounded up all of the items you can shop across categories like beauty and lifestyle that are raising funds for a number of different breast cancer organizations, programs and support efforts in big ways.\n\nSome brands are donating 100% of proceeds from certain items to organizations, while others have pledged to make donations of up to $100,000 long after October draws to a close.
