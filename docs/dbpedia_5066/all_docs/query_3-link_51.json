        "text": "Due to social, environmental, and economic disparities, historically neglected and underrepresented communities are at increased risk of developing or dying from cancer. Gilead’s Toward Health Equity Oncology Grant™ (THE Oncology Grant) was established to advance health equity for people impacted by cancer, with new funding announced annually on World Cancer Day. In 2024, Gilead announced the commitment of $5 million in grant funding to support additional health equity programs globally.\n\nIn the U.S., Gilead is awarding a total of $3 million to two coalitions, made up of seven community partners, working to increase clinical trial access and participation in communities of color. Historically, there has been an absence of adequate representation in and access to oncology clinical trials from underserved and disinvested communities in the U.S. This gap leads to the generation of inapplicable data and hinders equitable access to treatment. To address these issues, there is a necessity for community-based approaches that utilize population-specific strategies, aiming to enhance access and representation in clinical trials. The U.S. THE Oncology Grant awardees are coalitions composed of organizations that are intentionally inclusive. These locally focused groups will provide services that are designed to address and overcome challenges with innovative practices and a plan for sustainability.\n\n“This funding from Gilead supports our efforts to advance health equity in oncology and enables AHS to offer participation in cancer clinical trials, deepen learnings from these trials, improve outcomes, and advance our mission of Caring, Healing, Teaching and Serving all.” - James Jackson, Chief Executive Officer, Alameda Health System (AHS).\n\nIn Australia, Canada and Europe, Gilead is providing a total of $2 million to 29 grassroots organizations that support people impacted by metastatic breast cancer (mBC). The diagnosis rates of mBC globally underscore the ongoing challenges in early detection and effective management of this advanced stage of breast cancer. While the global incidence of mBC varies across regions, the same factors – access to screening, economic disparities, support resources – impact the care and outcomes for mBC patients.\n\nThe grants in Australia, Canada and Europe fund projects based on three pillars:\n\nPerson-centered care to improve health literacy and shared decision-making, and to provide community-based social support.\n\nOrganizational capacity-building to help improve disease awareness and the ability of impacted communities to provide critical support.\n\nSupporting caregivers to improve their ability to support people living with mBC.\n\nTo date, Gilead has awarded more than $18 million in health equity-related oncology grants for programs that advance health equity for disinvested communities, including Black, Hispanic, Jewish, Native American and LGBTQ+.\n\n2024 THE Oncology Grant Recipients\n\nUnited States\n\nAlameda Health System in collaboration with UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center and Umoja Health\n\nGeorgetown University in collaboration with Nueva Vida, The African Women's Cancer Awareness Association and The Center For Black Equity\n\nAustralia, Canada, Europe\n\nAHOP (Austria)\n\nAlliance of Women with Breast Cancer (Czech Republic)\n\nAmigas do Peito – Humanitarian Association to Support Women with Breast Cancer (Portugal)\n\nBnai Zion Medical Center (Israel)\n\nBreast Cancer Now (United Kingdom)\n\nChaim Sheba Medical Center (Israel)\n\nCzech Medical Society (Czech Republic)\n\nDialog Jessenius ops (Czech Republic)\n\nEUROPA DONNA Schweiz (Switzerland)\n\nEVITA (Portugal)\n\nFamilienhoerbuch gGmbH (Germany)\n\nFondazione IncontraDonna (Italy)\n\nHaemek Medical Center (Israel)\n\nHalsartan Foundation (Israel)\n\nHelgahilft (Austria)\n\nInfluCancer (Austria)\n\nKrebsliga Zürich (Switzerland)\n\nLook Good Feel Better (Switzerland)\n\nMaggie’s Cancer Centre (United Kingdom)\n\nMake 2nds Count (United Kingdom)\n\nMamazone e.V.
