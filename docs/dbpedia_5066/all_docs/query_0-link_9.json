Choice\n\nPink Hope will not use or share the personal information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without first letting you know and offering you a choice. As previously stated, we will also provide you the opportunity to let us know if you do not wish to receive unsolicited direct marketing materials from us via a tick box on each form and we will do everything we can to honour such requests.\n\n12. Access to and correction of your personal information\n\nPink Hope strives to keep your personal information accurate. Please contact us (using the contact details at the end of this Privacy Policy) if you would like to access or correct the personal information, we hold about you.\n\nWe will generally provide you with access to your personal information (subject to some exceptions\n\npermitted by law) but may charge an access fee to cover the cost of retrieving the information and supplying it to you.\n\nWe will generally provide you with access to your information, including making every effort to provide you with online access to your registration data (where possible) so that you may view, update or correct your information.\n\nTo protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access or enabling you to make corrections. To access your personal information, return to the web page where you originally entered it and follow the instructions on that web page.\n\nCertain areas of Pink Hope’s website may limit access to specific individuals through the use of passwords and through providing personal information on the member/login page.\n\n13. Security\n\nPink Hope is committed to ensuring the security of your information. To prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. For example, we use encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive data.\n\nPlease note that links to third-party websites on the site are provided solely as a convenience to you. If you use these links, you will leave the Pink Hope site. Pink Hope has not reviewed all of these third-party sites and does not control and is not responsible for any of these sites, their content or their Privacy Policy.\n\nPink Hope does not endorse or make any representations about them, or any information, software or other products or materials found there, or any results that may be obtained from using them. If you decide to access any of the thirdparty sites linked to this site, you do so at your own risk.\n\n14. How Pink Hope uses cookies\n\nA cookie is a piece of text asking permission to be placed on your computer’s hard drive. If you agree, then your browser adds the text in a small file. The purpose of a cookie is to help us analyse web traffic or let us know when you visit a particular site.\n\nCookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies. Cookies allow a web application to respond to you as an individual. By gathering and remembering information about your preferences, the web application can tailor its operation to your needs, likes and dislikes. For example, when you visit an electronic store, a cookie makes it easy to shop by allowing you to drop things into a shopping cart; the cart itself is not the cookie, the cookie is placed on your hard drive and keeps track of your cart versus others in use at the same time.\n\n15. How we use cookies\n\nPink Hope uses traffic log cookies to identify what pages are being used and which ones aren’t. This helps us aggregate and analyse data about webpage traffic and make improvements to our website (pinkhope.org.au) to better meet our visitor, contact and client needs. Pink Hope uses this information only for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.\n\nThat is the case of many of our support and information-sharing pages and forums. Denial of a traffic log cookie should not prevent you from using one of these sites.\n\nA few pinkhope.org.au pages use temporary cookies as part of the customer web navigation experience, tracking unique IDs for that particular website session only.\n\nExamples are newsletter registration sites. This cookie, by itself, only tells us that a previous pinkhope.org.au visitor, contact or client has returned. If you deny the cookie, you can still use the site anonymously.\n\n16. Your choice about cookies\n\nOverall, cookies help us give you a better website to use, by letting us monitor what’s working and what isn’t through site traffic analysis. Pink Hope wants to be sure you understand that accepting a cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any personal information about you, other than the data you chose to share with us. This practice is strictly enforced.\n\nMost web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your settings to prevent that, such as by having your device warn you each time a cookie is being sent or choosing to turn off all cookies. On the Pink Hope website, you will be able to disable all cookies other than mandatory cookies. This can be done through your web browser settings, and because each browser is different, you should look at your browser’s “Help” menu to learn how to modify your cookie settings. There are also online resources that may help you learn more how to opt out of targeted behavioural advertising from many major thirdparty network advertisers. If you do disable cookies from your browser, you may not be able to access certain sections of the website that use essential cookies, and this may make your experiences on the Site less efficient.\n\nWe know that a lot of people have concerns about cookies, but in talking with many of our visitors, contacts and clients, we believe that the benefit we both gain from their proper use is worthwhile.\n\nYou may set your web browser (Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator) to notify you of cookie placement requests or decline cookies completely. You can delete the files that contains cookies; those files are stored as part of your internet browser.\n\n17. Complaints\n\nPlease contact us (using the contact details at the end of this Privacy Policy) if you have any concerns or complaints about the manner in which we have handled your personal information. We may ask you to put your complaint in writing and provide details about it. We will inquire into your complaint and respond to you in writing within 30 days. If you are not satisfied with our response, you can contact us to discuss your concerns or lodge a complaint with the Australian Information Commissioner (www.oaic.gov.au).\n\n18. Changes to this Privacy Policy\n\nWe may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time at our discretion. Amended versions will be posted at https://www.pinkhope.org.au/privacy.\n\n19. Contact details"
