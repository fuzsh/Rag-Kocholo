        "text": "Flint, MICH -- Getting through breast and other cancers is a journey and having supportive family and friends to take that walk with patients can be extremely helpful. In fact, it can be a lifesaver.\n\nWe meet some women who are sharing and caring and trying to stay cancer-free.\n\nThey have \"Pink Hope.\"\n\n\"Probably in one word, survivorship, just being there for each other,” said Teresa Fowler, breast and thyroid cancer survivor.\n\nThat's why these breast cancer survivors and one caregiver meet weekly at Ascension Genesys Hospital Hurley Cancer Institute.\n\nThey share and try to embrace positive thoughts to overcome the challenges of cancer.\n\nTeresa is the one who guides this support group.\n\n\"I can remember back in 2011, when I first stepped into a breast cancer support group, I was scared,” said Teresa.\n\nThe Genesys Hurley Cancer Institute is a place that brings breast cancer patients and survivors together to talk about their breast cancer journey and it's also a place for them to find hope.\n\nJill Hendrix, a survivor, is at the institute to embrace hope. She beat breast cancer, which showed up in 2014, and leukemia, that tried to derail her four years later.\n\n\"All these classes, just the balance that it gives you and the insight and companionship of the people you meet to support, to be supported by is, I just can't say enough about it,” said Jill.\n\nThese women feel fortunate to have survived the grips of the disease.\n\nThe Garden of Hope at the Institute is there to honor the memories of those who tried to stay optimistic, but ultimately lost their battle against cancer.\n\n\"Life is a journey, just like cancer is a journey. and it doesn't matter what you plan or what you think the outcome is going to be, you just have to balance yourself, believe, turn to your faith, turn to your friends, turn to your family and you'll get through it,” added Jill.\n\nStaying happy, healthy and alive is encouraged in this group, in spite of the fear the cancer will come back, painful treatment they've had to endure, and other challenges brought on by the disease.\n\n\"We survived that storm. We made it through to the other side. not everybody gets to say that,” said Teresa.\n\nHalf of this group of women soon will be going to Stowe, Vermont, for what is described as a life-changing survivors conference.\n\nTeresa has a reminder: visit your doctors and get your mammograms,\n\nShe says she is the one in eight who are diagnosed with cancer, but she is a survivor because of regular checkups."
