        "text": "“I remember being in the grocery store one day with my breast cancer awareness shirt on,” says Dawn Herzog, supervisor of the Blessing Breast Center. “A woman stopped me to say, ‘Just seeing your shirt lifted my spirits. I know I’m not alone.’”\n\nThat’s a powerful piece of apparel.\n\nBeyond the power to lift spirits and offer hope, though, the pink merchandise and community events related to Breast Cancer Awareness Month have an even greater purpose. Money raised from apparel sales and fundraisers for the Blessing Foundation can be a lifesaver.\n\nSupporting Patients in Need\n\nThe Blessing Breast Services Fund, one of more than 60 funds managed by the Blessing Foundation, supports breast cancer patients who are struggling financially. Donations to the fund help pay for unmet needs, including medication, prosthetics, wigs, medical supplies, transportation and living expenses.\n\nThe fund also ensures women who can’t afford mammograms have access to them.\n\n“Treatment options are so much better the earlier you detect it,” Herzog says, emphasizing the vital importance of mammograms to catch breast cancer in its earliest stages. “Donations to the Foundation help eliminate the financial barriers so we can make that early diagnosis.”\n\nIn 2018, the fund granted $47,200 to local patients in need.\n\nDonations to the Breast Services Fund also support community education, allowing Blessing staff to spread the message about risk factors and early detection at health fairs and other events.\n\nPink Apparel\n\nThe Blessing Breast Center Apparel Store got its start in 2006 with one “Think Pink” design on a short-sleeve T-shirt. It has grown to include multiple designs with different inspirational messages each year and a wide array of apparel: short- and long-sleeve tees, sweatshirts, hoodies, shorts, tank tops, leggings, sweatpants, and more.\n\nArea residents flock to the store for a few days each October to stock up on pink apparel and support the cause.\n\nThe store has been in various locations. This year, it will be open for four days – October 2-5 – at the Oak Street Mall, 4937 Oak, in Quincy.\n\nHours are:\n\n10 a.m.-6:30 p.m. Wednesday, Oct. 2\n\n10 a.m.-6 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 3, and Friday, Oct. 4\n\n9 a.m.-2 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 5\n\nIf you miss buying pink apparel in the store, don’t worry. You can stop at the Blessing Breast Center year-round to browse the inventory. The Breast Center is in Suite 320 of the Blessing Health Center East, 927 Broadway.\n\n“You can’t go anywhere without seeing Breast Center apparel,” Herzog said. “It’s a visible reminder, ‘Hey, I’ve got to get my mammogram.’”\n\nPink. Pass It On in the District\n\nQuincy’s downtown businesses support the Breast Services Fund with an annual 5K walk, “Pink. Pass It On in the District,” which is in its 13th year.\n\n“It’s an emotional event,” Herzog says. “Women come out to support other women and each year a survivor shares her inspirational journey.”\n\nThis year’s walk is Saturday, Oct. 26, starting and ending in Washington Park. Registration begins at 8:30 with the featured speaker at 9:30 a.m., followed by the walk. Click here or stop at the Blessing Breast Center or any of The District sponsors for a registration form. Registration must be received by Oct. 23 to guarantee a walk T-shirt.\n\nSlide title\n\nWrite your caption here\n\nButton\n\nSlide title\n\nWrite your caption here\n\nButton\n\nPink Fundraisers at Work, School and in the Community\n\nQuincy area businesses, schools, churches, and other organizations are amazing supporters of the cause, finding unique ways to give back.\n\nThe Tangerine Bowl is a longtime supporter, holding a “Strike Out Breast Cancer” bowling fundraiser every April since 2010. It’s grown into a two-day event with more than 80 teams. Participants bowl three games, dress up in costumes, buy raffle tickets, compete for prizes, have fun – and raise a lot of money!\n\nThis year’s bowling event raised $11,600 for the Breast Services Fund.\n\nIn 2014, the Quincy University Women’s Volleyball team established a “Pick Me Up” fund within the Breast Services Fund to give breast cancer patients something to lift their spirits and bring some joy, like dinner and movie, a manicure or pedicure, massage, housecleaning services, or a family night out.\n\nLocal firefighters get involved, too, with the Quincy Fire Department and Tri-Township Fire Department creating their own breast cancer awareness T-shirt designs and taking orders from community members, with all proceeds benefiting the Breast Services Fund.\n\nThose are just three examples of community fundraisers – Blessing is fortunate and grateful that numerous other businesses and organizations take time to make a difference. We encourage you to support their efforts in October and throughout the year!\n\nSlide title\n\nWrite your caption here\n\nButton\n\nSlide title\n\nWrite your caption here\n\nButton\n\nPink\n\nNights\n\nAthletic teams throughout the region – from the junior high level through college – host Pink Nights to raise money for the Foundation’s Breast Services Fund. Teams wear pink on game night and sell T-shirts with a special “pink” design to family, friends, and fans. They organize bake sales, raffles and other fundraisers.\n\nIt’s a tradition that got started in 2006, when Laurie Laaker, then a Breast Center employee, had a daughter on the QND Girls Basketball team. Laaker approached Coach Eric Orne with the idea, and he was immediately on board.\n\nSince then, the Pink Nights have expanded to dozens of schools and nearly every sport.\n\n“It’s awesome to see the kids getting involved and be so excited about it,” said Laaker, who now works at the Blessing Cancer Center. “They’ve come up with fun ways to support the Foundation, and it’s also a great way to raise awareness.”\n\nOf course, you can donate directly to Breast Services Fund any time of the year.\n\nNo matter how you decide to offer support – by buying a T-shirt, attending a walk, getting a bowling team together, supporting your favorite athletic team’s pink night, or simply sending cash – you know that\n\n100% of your donation is going to help someone in need.\n\nThose simple acts of giving make a tremendous impact on patients going through their breast cancer journeys.\n\n“You’ve given them the world,” Herzog says. “You’ve given them hope, knowing they’re not in this alone. They’ve got the support of the community.”\n\nDonate Now\n\nChemotherapy is No “Piece of Cake”\n\nPeople who have gone through it, and those who love them, know that chemotherapy is no “piece of cake.” But for Doug McPeak and Ansel Niemeyer, both of Bowling Green, MO, chemotherapy came with a piece of pie at the Blessing Cancer Center’s Infusion Center."
