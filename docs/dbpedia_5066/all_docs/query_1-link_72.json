        "text": "Sweet Dreams & Shared Strength: Warwick Welcomes Warriors for a Day of Renewal for Breast Cancer Patients and Survivors\n\nWARWICK, R.I., Feb. 27, 2024 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ — United Breast Cancer Foundation (UBCF) is pleased to announce the “Gifts of Comfort and Hope” Mattress & Pink Bag Event in Warwick, Rhode Island. Imagine sinking into a cloud of comfort, knowing deep down that somewhere, amongst a community of warriors, hope and support are blooming this spring. This dream becomes reality for breast cancer patients and survivors on Saturday, April 27th, 2024. In collaboration with Good360 and fellow breast cancer organization, the Gloria Gemma Breast Cancer Resource Foundation, UBCF is excited to welcome breast cancer patients and survivors throughout the day to gift 160 queen size restorative and therapeutic mattresses and other pampering items at no cost.\n\nWhy does a mattress matter in the breast cancer journey? For those navigating the often challenging path of breast cancer, a good night’s sleep can feel like a distant luxury. Treatment side effects like fatigue, pain, and anxiety can wreak havoc on sleep quality, further impacting physical and emotional well-being. According to the CDC, lack of sleep can lead to serious problems for people with cancer such as lower quality of life, depression, and difficulty managing daily tasks. Studies have shown breast cancer patients experience the highest rates of insomnia compared to other cancers. Sleep helps strengthen your immune system and keeps your mind sharp – allowing your body to refresh, replenish, and rebuild itself. This is where a supportive, pressure-relieving mattress becomes more than just a comfortable place to rest; it becomes a powerful tool for healing.\n\nLack of sleep can lead to serious problems for people with cancer.

Attendees will also receive a Pink Bag gift curated with care. Additionally, the event attendees will have the opportunity to connect with fellow breast cancer warriors and thrivers, swap stories, and find solace in knowing they are surrounded by others who understand their journey.\n\nUBCF is proud to work with fellow breast cancer organizations, creating a space for camaraderie and collaboration, not competition. Partnering with the Gloria Gemma Foundation amplifies the outreach of the event, ensuring that those in need are aware of the resources and support available to them.\n\nStephanie Mastroianni, UBCF’s Executive Director shared, “It brings me great joy to partner with the Gloria Gemma Foundation, as both of our organizations honor amazing women who passed after battling breast cancer: Gloria Gemma, and my mother, Audrey Beverly Mastroianni.” Stephanie continued, “My mother is from Rhode Island, and we spent many summers on the shores making beautiful memories that will live in my heart always. Now as a mom myself, I am adding to those precious memories with my own children. Working with the Gloria Gemma Foundation is like a homecoming – building on the legacy of two very special women, and I look forward to future collaborations.”\n\nBryan Sawyer, Gloria Gemma’s Chief Operating Officer said, “UBCF’s mission and values align with ours, and we have been collaborating with them since 2022. The Gloria Gemma Foundation has been helping the cancer community for 20 years, and this event is one more way we are providing comfort to the people we serve.”\n\nThe UBCF Mattress and Pink Bag Event is open to breast cancer patients and survivors, regardless of gender. To ensure a personalized experience and fair distribution of resources, attendance is required on the day of the event. People are welcome to apply from anywhere in the United States, however, approved applicants are responsible for picking up items on the day of the event. Items cannot be stored or shipped.\n\nAbout UBCF\n\nThe United Breast Cancer Foundation is a non-profit founded in 2000 with a mission to make a positive difference in the lives of those impacted by breast cancer.
