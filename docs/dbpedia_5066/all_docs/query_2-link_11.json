        "text": "While the pink ribbon is a well-recognized symbol of breast cancer awareness and support, many different awareness ribbons, representing many different types of cancers, exist. You might be surprised to learn that more than 50 ribbons represent different cancers and their survivors and caregivers today.\n\nBut where did it all start? Awareness ribbons initially sprang from a 1970s tune, “Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree,” which inspired the wife of a hostage in Iran to tie yellow ribbons around trees in an effort to heighten awareness and bring her husband home. In the 1990s, AIDS activists brought the red ribbon to life. Since the 1990s, ribbons have decorated the chests and homes of many cancer patients, families, and friends as an outward show of support and compassion.\n\nRibbons of all hues\n\nIn addition to pink for breast cancer, a rainbow of ribbons mark months of awareness and action for other types of cancers. According to the National Cancer Institute, there are over 100 types and subtypes of cancer. Some subtypes of cancer even have their own awareness months and ribbons. Several common types of cancers and their awareness months and ribbon colors are listed below.*\n\nAppendix Cancer (August): Amber\n\nBladder Cancer (May): Yellow, purple, and navy\n\nBlood Cancer (September): Red\n\nLeukemia (September): Orange\n\nHodgkin Lymphoma (September): Violet\n\nNon-Hodgkin Lymphoma (September): Lime green\n\nMyeloma (March): Burgundy\n\nBone Cancer (July): Yellow\n\nBrain Cancer (May): Gray\n\nBreast Cancer (October): Pink\n\nBreast Cancer (October): Pink\n\nMetastatic Breast Cancer (October): Pink, teal, and green\n\nInflammatory Breast Cancer (October): Hot pink\n\nMale Breast Cancer (October): Pink and blue\n\nChildhood Cancer (September): Gold\n\nColorectal Cancer (March): Dark blue\n\nGallbladder & Bile Duct Cancer (February): Kelly green\n\nGastric Cancer (November): Periwinkle\n\nGynecological Cancer (September): Purple\n\nCervical Cancer (January): Teal and white\n\nOvarian Cancer (September): Teal\n\nUterine Cancer (September): Peach\n\nVaginal and Vulvar Cancers (September): Purple\n\nHead & Neck Cancer (April): Burgundy and white\n\nKidney Cancer (March): Orange\n\nLiver Cancer (October): Green\n\nLung Cancer (November): Pearl or white\n\nPancreatic Cancer (November): Purple\n\nProstate Cancer (September): Light blue\n\nSkin Cancer (May): Black\n\nTesticular Cancer (April): Purple\n\nThyroid Cancer (September): Purple, teal, and pink\n\n*Not an exhaustive list of all cancer types and subtypes\n\nExamples of different cancer ribbons\n\nRibbons can be combined to represent multiple cancers, and lavender is sometimes used to recognize cancer as a whole. They can be worn anytime to send love to someone in need, share your commitment with others, and inspire action for awareness and treatment.\n\nIn a world where cancer affects so many lives, the diverse colors of awareness ribbons unite us in a shared pursuit: to raise awareness, promote early detection, and support the patients and survivors in our lives. Together, we stand as a powerful force, offering hope and compassion to all those impacted by cancer of any kind.\n\nRead more about the history and meaning of the breast cancer pink ribbon.\n\nInterested in learning more?"
