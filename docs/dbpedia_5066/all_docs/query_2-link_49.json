        "text": "Cancer Treatment Financial Resources for Clients Ineligible for BC3NP Medicaid Treatment Act\n\nOptions for uninsured U.S. citizens diagnosed with cancer\n\nIf not eligible for BC3NP Medicaid Treatment Act (MTA), apply for Medicaid at your local Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).\n\nIf initially rejected for Medicaid for a reason other than \"over income,\" then carefully review the application and reapply.\n\nContact local hospitals and ask to speak with a social worker or financial counselor to find out if they have any charity care/financial hardship programs.\n\nContact a community health clinic for free or sliding-fee services.\n\nA final option would be to make payment arrangements with a physician willing to see you on that basis. For medical bills already incurred, the client will need to find out if that facility/provider has a financial assistance program.\n\nOptions for uninsured non-U.S. citizens diagnosed with cancer (Note: The availability of financial support for non-U.S. residents is extremely limited, depending on their status.)\n\nResident aliens who possess a green card may apply for Medicaid 5 years after they have been in the U.S. If they apply prior to the 5 year period, they will be granted Emergency Services Only (ESO) coverage, which covers emergency treatment in an Emergency Room. No routine health costs are covered.\n\nSome clients may find the care they need through clinical trials. Additional information to make an informed decision about the clinical trial may be limited depending on the person's status. The patient, the family or the physician can inquire about currently recruiting trials and their locations at the following web sites: www.nih.gov (National Institutes of Health), www.cancer.gov (National Cancer Institute), or www.clinicaltrials.gov (National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials).\n\nOther options:\n\nContact a community health clinic for free or sliding fee services.\n\nInquire about making payments with a physician willing to see the client on that basis. For medical bills already incurred, the client will need to find out if that facility/provider has a financial assistance program.\n\nImmigration Terms to Know\n\nA general summary of U.S. immigration terminology follows, as defined by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). (Please Note: This is not an all-inclusive list or summary. Questions regarding a client's status should be directed to Venetta Tucker, Quality Analyst for Medicaid and the BC3NP MTA, at TuckerV@michigan.gov.)\n\nAlien:\n\nAn individual who is not a U.S. citizen or U.S. national.\n\nLegalized Aliens:\n\nCertain undocumented women who were eligible to apply for temporary resident status under the legalization provision of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. To be eligible, women must have continuously resided in the United States in an unlawful status since January 1, 1982, not be excludable, and have entered the United States either 1) illegally before January 1, 1982, or 2) as temporary visitors before January 1, 1982, with their authorized stay expiring before that date or with the Government's knowledge of their unlawful status before that date. Legalization consists of two stages â€” temporary and then permanent residency. In order to adjust to permanent status aliens must have had continuous residence in the United States, be admissible as an immigrant, and demonstrate at least a minimal understanding and knowledge of the English language and U.S. history and government.\n\nLawful Permanent Resident Alien (LPRA):\n\nAn alien who has been lawfully afforded the privilege of residing permanently in the U.S.\n\nPermanent Resident Alien:\n\nA person that enters the country with an immigrant visa or adjusts his status after entering as a nonimmigrant, refugee, or asylee. Persons with this status are entitled to live and work in the U.S. and collect entitlement benefits, if qualified.\n\nThere are two tests for whether someone is classified as a resident alien:\n\nThe green card test.\n\nThis applies to someone who has U.S. permanent or conditional residence, or a green card. The person is a citizen of another country who is authorized to live and work in the U.S. on a permanent basis (or, in the case of a conditional resident, for two years that may then be continued into a permanent stay). By the very nature of the requirements placed upon permanent residents, they spend most of their time living in the United States. To keep a green card, the person must not make their primary home in another country, nor remain outside the U.S. for more than one year. (People who plan to remain outside the United States for more than one year can, however, apply for a re-entry permit before leaving, in order to preserve their green card.)\n\nThe substantial presence test.\n\nEven without having a green card, a person who spends 31 days in the United States during the current year and 183 days during a three-year period that includes the current year and the two years immediately before that, is considered a resident alien. This affects many people who are in the U.S. on temporary, otherwise known as nonimmigrant, visas. There are various exemptions, such as for time the person spent in transit (less than 24 hours in the U.S.), time during which the person couldn't leave because he or she required medical treatment, as well as for teachers and students (on an F, J, M, or Q visa) who haven't stayed in the U.S. beyond a certain period of time.\n\nNon-Resident Alien:\n\nA person spending some time in the U.S., but does not meet (or is exempt from) either the green card or the substantial presence tests. Students and teachers are often classified as non-resident aliens in the early years of their U.S. stay.\n\nAlien Registration Receipt Card (also known as a \"Green Card\"):\n\nAn INS document that certifies lawful permanent resident status, commonly called the \"green card,\" older versions may be green or blue/white. Newest versions are now rose/off-pink. It carries the INS form number I-151 or I-551.\n\nUndocumented Alien (same as \"Illegal Alien\"):\n\nAn alien who entered the United States illegally without the proper authorization and documents, or who entered the United States legally and has since violated the terms of his or her visa or overstayed the time limit. An undocumented alien is deportable if apprehended.\n\nImmigrant:\n\nAn alien who has been lawfully afforded the privilege of residing permanently in the U.S. with the right to eventually obtain citizenship. This status allows authorization for work and entitlement benefits. (See also the definitions for lawful permanent resident alien and permanent resident alien, which are terms used interchangeably with this term).\n\nNonimmigrant:\n\nAn alien who has been granted the right to reside temporarily in the United States. Each nonimmigrant is admitted into the U.S. in the nonimmigrant status that corresponds to the type of visa issued.\n\nAliens in some nonimmigrant statuses are permitted to be employed in the United States, and others are not. Some nonimmigrant statuses have strict time limits for the alien's stay in the U.S., while others do not.\n\nEach nonimmigrant status has rules and guidelines, which must be followed in order for the nonimmigrant to remain \"in status.\" A nonimmigrant who violates one of these rules or guidelines will fall \"out of status.\" A nonimmigrant who remains \"out of status\" for at least 180 days is deportable and will be unable to re-enter the United States for 3 years. A nonimmigrant who remains \"out of status\" for at least 365 days is deportable and will be unable to re-enter the United States for 10 years.\n\nMigrant:\n\nA person who leaves his/her country of origin to seek residence in another country.\n\nRefugee:\n\nAny person who is outside his or her country of nationality who is unable or unwilling to return to that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution. Persecution, or the fear thereof, must be based on the alien's race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\n\nRefugees are subject to ceilings by geographic area set annually by the President in consultation with Congress and are eligible to adjust to lawful permanent resident status after one year of continuous presence in the United States.\n\nU.S. National:\n\nAn individual who owes his sole allegiance to the United States, including all U.S. citizens, and including some individuals who are not U.S. citizens.\n\nFor tax purposes, the term \"U.S. national\" refers to individuals who were born in American Samoa or were born in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands who have chosen to be U.S. nationals instead of U.S. citizens.\n\nU.S. Citizen:\n\nAn individual born in the United States.\n\nAn individual whose parent is a U.S. citizen.\n\nA former alien who has been naturalized as a U.S. citizen.\n\nAn individual born in Puerto Rico.\n\nAn individual born in Guam.\n\nAn individual born in the U.S. Virgin Islands."
