        "text": "Vulvar cancer is such an important focus at City of Hope that our Atlanta, Chicago and Phoenix hospitals have a Gynecologic Cancer Center, focusing on the treatment of women with cancer of the reproductive organs.\n\nOur gynecologic oncologists are experienced and trained in diagnosing, staging and treating all stages of vulvar cancer. They will work with other oncologists, specialists and clinicians in developing a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to your individual needs. Each patient’s treatment plan also includes supportive care therapies designed to help manage the side effects of cancer and its treatment and support the patient’s quality of life.\n\nThis overview will cover the basic facts about vulvar cancer, including:\n\nWhat causes vulvar cancer?\n\nWho gets vulvar cancer?\n\nVulvar cancer types\n\nVulvar cancer symptoms\n\nDiagnosing vulvar cancer\n\nVulvar cancer treatments\n\nDiagnosis and treatment options at our City of Hope Gynecologic Cancer Centers\n\nIf you believe you may be experiencing symptoms of vulvar cancer and want to schedule an appointment for diagnostic testing, or if you’re interested in a second opinion on your vulvar cancer diagnosis and treatment plan, call us or chat online with a member of our team.\n\nAt City of Hope, we recognize that vulvar cancer, like other cancers of the female reproductive system, affect women in unique ways. That’s why we created the Women’s Cancer Center at our Atlanta, Chicago and Phoenix hospitals, located around the country. At these specially designed centers, our multidisciplinary team of doctors and clinicians are singularly focused on screening, diagnosing and treating breast cancer and gynecologic cancers with a sense of urgency. Our supportive care services are designed to help address symptoms and side effects, to help you have the strength and stamina to continue your treatment and the quality of life to help you continue everyday activities throughout your cancer journey.\n\nWithin each Women’s Cancer Center, we offer patients with vulvar and other gynecologic patients even more specialized care at our Gynecologic Cancer Centers, where our care teams treat each patient’s specific cancer using standard-of-care and, when appropriate, innovative precision medicine treatments.\n\nOnce your diagnostic tests are complete, your multidisciplinary team of vulvar cancer experts will meet with you to discuss your results, answer your questions and recommend treatment options. Your personalized care plan is based on your unique vulvar cancer diagnosis and needs. Your care team will take into account your medical history, personal goals and preferences, then work with you to create a comprehensive treatment plan.\n\nThey also share the ways supportive care services may be incorporated into your plan. Treatments for vulvar cancer may cause side effects such as fatigue, weakness, nausea and lymphedema. They may also cause pain and pelvic floor weakness that may trigger sexual health challenges. That’s why each City of Hope Gynecologic Cancer Center offers both sexual health counseling and oncology rehabilitation exercises that are designed to help you restore function and overcome relationship challenges."
