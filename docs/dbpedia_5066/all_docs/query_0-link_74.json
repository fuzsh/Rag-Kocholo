        "text": "A cancer is a group of cells that have grown in an uncontrollable way, damaging healthy tissues. A group of growing cancer cells forms a lump, which is called a tumor. If the tumor is in the breast, it is called breast cancer. Breast cancer is a malignant growth that begins in the tissues of the breast.\n\nTYPES OF BREAST CANCER\n\nWhether your cancer is non-invasive or invasive will determine your treatment choices and how you might respond to the treatments you receive. The main types of breast cancer:\n\nNon-invasive cancer\n\nDuctal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)\n\nLobular Carcinoma In Situ (LCIS)\n\nInvasive cancer\n\nInvasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)\n\nInvasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC)\n\nNon-invasive cancer (Carcinoma in situ)\n\nWhen abnormal cells grow inside the lobules or milk ducts but have not spread to the surrounding tissue or beyond, the condition is called carcinoma in situ. The term \"in situ\" means \"in place\" and is used to describe this condition because the abnormal cells are still \"in place\" inside the lobules or ducts where they first developed. There are two main categories of carcinoma in situ: ductal carcinoma in situ and lobular carcinoma in situ.\n\nDuctal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)\n\nMainly originates in the milk ducts of the breast. It is the most common form of non-invasive breast cancer (90%).\n\nLobular Carcinoma In Situ (LCIS)\n\nMainly originates in the lobules of the breast. It is less common and considered a marker for increased breast cancer risk.\n\nThe cells involved in the different carcinomas in situ are not fully cancerous because they have not developed the ability to invade out of the ducts or lobules and metastasize. They are often referred to as pre-cancerous conditions because they can either develop into or raise the risk of invasive cancer.\n\nInvasive cancer\n\nInvasive breast cancer is not the same as metastasis.\n\nMetastasis occurs when the cancer cells break away from the primary tumour and spread into organs in other parts of the body through the bloodstream or the lymphathic system. Most invasive cancers are either ductal or lobular in nature. If\n\nthe cancer cells spread outside the ducts or lobules of the breast into the surrounding tissue, this is called invasive breast cancer.\n\nInvasive cancer cells sometimes spread outside the breast area to other parts of the body. They do this by moving through blood vessels, such as veins, or through lymphatic vessels. Lymphatic vessels are next to veins in the body, and are connected to lymph nodes (glands). Lymph nodes collect normal fluid and dead cells from the lymphatic vessels.\n\nInvasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)\n\nAccounts for about 80% of all breast cancers. Invasive means that it has \"invaded\" or spread to the surrounding tissues. It is ductal because the cancer began in the milk ducts—which are the \"pipes\" that bring milk from the lobules to the nipple.\n\nInvasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC)\n\nAccounts for about 10%–15% of all breast cancers, in which the cancer has spread from the lobules to the surrounding tissues. It is often found in multiple sites in the breast and can be difficult to detect by physical examination or mammography.\n\nOTHER TYPES OF BREAST CANCER\n\nMedullary Carcinoma\n\nIt is a rare cancer of ductal origin, accounting for 5% of breast cancers. Distinctive features include large size at detection, soft texture on palpation, mobility due to lack of invasion and the presence of immune system cells at the edges of the tumor. The outlook, or prognosis, for this kind of breast cancer is better than for other types of invasive breast cancer. But these are often hard to distinguish from infiltrating ductal carcinoma and are treated the same way.\n\nPaget's Disease of the Nipple\n\nIt is rare, slow-growing cancer producing changes in the nipple and accounts for only 1% of all cases of breast cancer. This type of breast cancer starts in the breast ducts and spreads to the skin of the nipple and then to the areola, the dark circle around the nipple. The skin of the nipple and areola often appears crusted, scaly, and red, with areas of bleeding or oozing. The woman may notice burning or itching. Paget disease may be associated with in situ carcinoma or with infiltrating breast carcinoma. If no lump can be felt in the breast tissue and the biopsy shows DCIS but no invasive cancer, the prognosis is excellent.\n\nMucinous Carcinoma\n\nThis rare type of invasive breast cancer is formed by mucus-producing cancer cells. The prognosis for mucinous carcinoma is better than for the more common types of invasive breast cancer. Colloid carcinoma is another name for this type of breast cancer.\n\nInflammatory carcinoma\n\nThis uncommon type of invasive breast cancer accounts for about 1% to 3% of all breast cancers. It makes the skin of the breast looks red and feels warm and gives the skin a thick, pitted appearance, mimicking an inflammation with no evidence of a lump. Doctors now know that these changes are not caused by inflammation or infection, but by cancer cells blocking lymph vessels or channels in the skin.\n\nPhyllodes tumor\n\nThis very rare breast tumor develops in the stroma (connective tissue) of the breast, in contrast to carcinomas, which develop in the ducts or lobules. Phyllodes (also spelled phylloides) tumors are usually benign but on rare occasions may be malignant.\n\nBenign phyllodes tumors are treated by removing the mass and a narrow margin of normal breast tissue. A malignant phyllodes tumor is treated by removing it along with a wider margin of normal tissue, or by mastectomy. These cancers do not respond to the usual treatments for invasive ductal or lobular breast cancer. In the past, both benign and malignant phyllodes tumors were referred to as cystosarcoma phyllodes.\n\nTubular carcinoma\n\nIs another special type of infiltrating breast carcinoma, in which the cells looks like a tubular under the microscope. Tubular carcinomas account for about 2% of all breast cancers and have a better prognosis than infiltrating ductal or lobular carcinomas.\n\nNot having children (parity) or late pregnancies\n\nWomen who have had no children (nulliparity) or who had their first child after age 35 have a higher breast cancer risk.\n\nBreastfeeding\n\nHaving multiple pregnancies and becoming pregnant at an early age reduces breast cancer risk. This is because when women breast feed their babies their oestrogen level reduces, hence reducing the possibility of breast cancer risk.\n\nAnother theory is that pregnancy changes the lobules (the milk producing glands) inside the breast, and that the lobules of women who have carried a pregnancy to term differ from those of a woman who has not been pregnant. Thus, it may be that breast-feeding reduces breast cancer risk by changing the mammary gland in specific ways. And another theory is that breast-feeding reduces breast cancer risk because it stops ovulation (that's why women rarely become pregnant while breast-feeding). This theory is supported by the studies that have found that the fewer times a woman ovulates, the lower her risk for breast cancer.\n\nOne study concluded that having more children and breast-feeding longer could reduce the risk of breast cancer by half.\n\nOral contraceptive use\n\nStudies have suggested that women using oral contraceptives have a slightly greater risk of breast cancer than women who have never used them. What matters is the dose of oestrogen in the tablet, and modern pills now contain much lower doses than earlier pills. Women who stopped using oral contraceptives more than 10 years ago do not appear to have any increased breast cancer risk.\n\nAlthough there may be a small increase in risk in long-term use, the benefits of the pill, which include protection against ovarian cancer, still outweighs the risk. When considering using oral contraceptives, women should discuss the risk factors for breast cancer with their doctors.\n\nHormone replacement therapy\n\nLong-term use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) after menopause, particularly oestrogen and progesterone combined, may slightly increase your risk of breast cancer.\n\nIf you still have your uterus (womb), doctors generally prescribe oestrogen and progesterone (known as combined HRT). Oestrogen relieves menopausal symptoms and prevents osteoporosis (thinning of the bones that can lead to fractures). But oestrogen can increase the risk of developing cancer of the uterus. Progesterone is added to help prevent this.\n\nIf you no longer have your uterus, oestrogen alone can be prescribed. This is commonly known as oestrogen replacement therapy (ERT). This probably does not increase the risk of breast cancer very much, if at all (although it was linked to an increased risk of stroke).\n\nThe decision to use HRT after menopause should be made by the woman and her doctor after weighing the possible risks (including increased risk of heart disease, breast cancer, strokes, and blood clots) and benefits (relief of menopausal symptoms, reduced risk of osteoporosis), and considering each woman’s other risk factors for heart disease, breast cancer, osteoporosis, and the severity of her menopausal symptoms.\n\nAlcohol\n\nUse of alcohol is linked to a slightly increased risk of developing breast cancer. Compared with nondrinkers, women who consume 1 alcoholic drink a day have a very small increase in risk, and those who have 2 to 5 drinks daily have about 1½ times the risk of women who drink no alcohol. Alcohol is also known to increase the risk of developing cancers of the mouth, throat, and esophagus.\n\nObesity and high-fat diets\n\nObesity (being overweight) has been found to be a breast cancer risk factor especially for women after menopause. Although the ovaries produce most of the oestrogen, fat tissue makes a small amount of oestrogen as well. Having more fat tissue can increase your oestrogen levels and increase your likelihood of developing breast cancer.\n\nThe connection between weight and breast cancer risk is complex, however. For example, risk appears to be increased for women who gained weight as an adult but is not increased among those who have been overweight since childhood. Also, excess fat in the waist area may affect risk more than the same amount of fat in the hips and thighs. Researchers believe that fat cells in various parts of the body have subtle differences in their metabolism that may explain this observation.\n\nStudies of fat in the diet have not clearly shown that this is a breast cancer risk factor. Most studies found that breast cancer is less common in countries where the typical diet is low in total fat, low in polyunsaturated fat, and low in saturated fat.\n\nOn the other hand, many studies of women in the United States have not found breast cancer risk to be related to dietary fat intake. Researchers are still not sure how to explain this apparent disagreement. Many scientists note that studies comparing diet and breast cancer risk in different countries are complicated by other differences (such as activity level, intake of other nutrients, genetic factors) that might also alter breast cancer risk.\n\nMore research is needed to better understand the effect of the types of fat eaten and body weight on breast cancer risk. But it is clear that calories do count, and fat is a major source of these. A diet high in fat has also been shown to influence the risk of developing several other types of cancer, and intake of certain types of fat is clearly related to heart disease risk. We recommend you maintain a healthy weight and limit your intake of red meats, especially those high in fat or processed.\n\nPhysical inactivity\n\nEvidence is growing that physical inactivity increases the risk of breast cancer. People who regularly exercise have a lower chance of breast cancer. Exercise as little as 1.25 to 2.5 hours per week of brisk walking reduced a woman’s risk by 18%. Walking 10 hours a week reduced the risk a little more.\n\nJust how common is it?\n\nIn men, breast cancer is a rare disease. There are about 300 cases diagnosed each year in the UK, compared with almost 42,000 cases of breast cancer in women. That's about one man for every 140 women diagnosed.\n\nShould the information be the same?\n\nSome men with breast cancer feel that the information available is biased towards women. That is understandable, but when you look at the figures, you can see why breast cancer information is aimed at women.\n\nThe important thing is that most of the information men with breast cancer need is the same. The symptoms, diagnosis and treatment are all very similar to women with breast cancer. The risks and causes do vary slightly and we've covered that below. Obviously there are areas where women need different information to men - on reconstruction or the different types of breast shapes (prostheses) available. As with women, some of the treatments can affect men's fertility and sex life. There is information in our living with cancer section on the effect of cancer treatment on sex for men and women. There is important information below on finding support, as this can be much more difficult for men with breast cancer, simply because there are fewer of them around.\n\nFor all other information areas, men with breast cancer should be able to use this whole section freely, picking and choosing where they feel the information will be of use to them.\n\nRisks and causes\n\nAs with women, the single biggest risk factor for male breast cancer is increasing age. Most cases are diagnosed in men between the ages of 60 and 70. Other risk factors are:\n\nHigh oestrogen levels\n\nExposure to radiation\n\nFamily history or recognised breast cancer gene in the family\n\nA rare genetic condition called Klinefelter's syndrome\n\nAll men produce some oestrogen. This is perfectly normal. But high oestrogen levels have been linked to breast cancer. High oestrogen levels can occur in\n\nObesity –oestrogen is partly made in the fat (adipose) tissues of the body\n\nChronic liver conditions, such as cirrhosis\n\nGenetic conditions\n\nMen who have been exposed to radiation repeatedly, over a long period of time, are more likely to develop male breast cancer. This is particularly true if they were young when the radiation exposure took place.\n\nThere is an increased risk of breast cancer in men with women in their family who have already been diagnosed with breast cancer. This is particularly true if the women are close relations (mother or sisters). And if the women were diagnosed at a young age (below 40). Men, as well as women, can inherit faulty genes that can cause breast cancer. Between 5 and 10 out of every 100 (5 – 10%) breast cancers diagnosed in women are thought to be due directly to an inherited faulty gene. In men, this may be more common. We think that between 10 and 20 out of every 100 diagnosed (10 – 20%) are due to inherited faulty genes.\n\nKlinefelter's syndrome is a rare genetic condition where a man is born with an extra female chromosome. So he is XXY instead of XY. Men with Klinefelter's are about 20 times more likely to get breast cancer than the average man. This makes their breast cancer risk the same as for the average woman.\n\nSymptoms\n\nThe commonest symptom for men with breast cancer is a lump in the breast area. This is nearly always painless. Other symptoms can include\n\nOozing from the nipple (a discharge) that may be blood stained\n\nSwelling of the breast\n\nA sore (ulcer) in the skin of the breast\n\nA nipple that is pulled into the breast (called nipple retraction)\n\nLumps under the arm\n\nDiagnosis\n\nThe tests used to diagnose breast cancer in men are much the same as for women. You may have a painless scan using sound waves, called an ultrasound. Or you may have a mammogram. If your scan shows up a suspicious area, your specialist will want to take a sample (biopsy) of breast tissue for examination under a microscope. If these tests show you have breast cancer, you will probably have other tests to make sure the cancer has not spread. These are covered in the page on further tests for breast cancer.\n\nThere are different types of breast cancer. The commonest type of breast cancer in both women and men is invasive ductal carcinoma. The early, precancerous condition called 'ductal carcinoma in situ' (DCIS) is diagnosed in men quite rarely. DCIS means that there are cancer cells in the breast. But they are all still contained inside the ducts of the breast and cannot spread. Inflammatory breast cancer and Paget's disease are also found rarely in men.\n\nTreatment\n\nThe same treatments are used for breast cancer in men as for women. These are all covered in detail in the CancerHelp UK section on treating breast cancer. Treatment is decided by the stage of your cancer. This means how far the cancer has grown by the time it is diagnosed. The staging for men's breast cancer is the same as in female breast cancer.\n\nTo treat your cancer, you may have\n\nSurgery\n\nRadiotherapy\n\nHormone therapy\n\nChemotherapy\n\nMastectomy is the most common operation. There is not very much breast tissue in men, so it isn't usually possible (or desirable) to leave any behind. Usually, you will have the lymph nodes removed from under the arm on the same side. This is to check them for cancer cells.\n\nAs the cancer will always be close to the chest wall in men (because there is so little breast tissue), your specialist is likely to suggest radiotherapy after surgery. This is to reduce the risk of the cancer growing back in the chest wall in the future.\n\nChemotherapy and hormone therapy treat the whole body – the drugs circulate through the bloodstream and will attack breast cancer cells wherever they are. Both these treatments can be used to try to lower the risk of the cancer coming back. Or to treat breast cancer that has spread.\n\nYour specialist will arrange tests on your cancer cells when you are first diagnosed. This will show if they have hormone receptors on the surface of the cancer cells. If they do, the breast cancer is likely to respond to hormone therapy. Breast cancer cells can have oestrogen receptors or progesterone receptors. You may seen 'hormone receptor status' written as ER or PR positive. Most male breast cancer cells do have hormone receptors. The commonest drug specialists prescribe is the same as for women - tamoxifen. The side effects are much the same as in women. Tamoxifen can make you feel sick when you first start taking it, but this usually wears off quite quickly. The commonest side effect for men and women is hot flushes. There are also reports of weight gain, difficulty sleeping, low mood and depression. In men, tamoxifen may also cause a loss of sex drive. This has been reported in up to 3 out of 10 men taking tamoxifen. There is information about how to cope with the effects of cancer treatment on your sex life in the section of CancerHelp UK on living with cancer.\n\nThere are other hormone therapies that are used to treat advanced breast cancer. These are covered in the hormone therapy pages of our secondary breast cancer section.\n\nYou may have chemotherapy if there are cancer cells in your lymph nodes. Or if your cancer does not have hormone receptors and so is not thought to be sensitive to hormone therapy. You may also have chemotherapy if your cancer is advanced and has spread to another part of your body.\n\nFinding support\n\nOf course it is difficult for anyone diagnosed with breast cancer. But it can be particularly difficult for men, as they may feel very confused and isolated. It is so common to hear about breast cancer in women. But not at all common to hear about it in men. So it can be difficult even to believe that the diagnosis is right. As male breast cancer is rare, men are often treated in large, specialist centres where there is expertise in dealing with the disease. So your consultant may know other men with breast cancer that you could talk to about it. Or you could try the charity Breast Cancer Care. They have male volunteers you can talk to on the phone. Or you could try one of the web-based contact networks, such as MyWavelength. This is a free support network where you can get in touch with other people with the same cancer type as you.\n\nA\n\nAbscess:\n\nA localized collection of pus that forms in tissues, organs or confined spaces as the body tries defending itself against infection-causing germs.\n\nAdjuvant therapy:\n\nA treatment given in addition to the primary treatment (usually surgery) to make treatment more successful.\n\nAntibody:\n\nA substance made by the body to fight infection.\n\nAreola:\n\nThe circular area of coloured skin surrounding the nipple.\n\nAspiration:\n\nRemoval of fluid from a cyst or cells from a lump, using a needle and syringe.\n\nAtypical hyperplasia:\n\nCells that are both abnormal (atypical) and increased in number.
