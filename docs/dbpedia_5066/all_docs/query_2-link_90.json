        "text": "LISBON — Irondale residents Bert and Roxy Kelly were among the vendors participating in this years’ Hoppel’s Rodeo.\n\nThe annual event takes place in Lisbon, with this year’s rodeo being held July 5-6.\n\nThe Kellys are returning vendors. They sign up every year to sell their specials to the crowd, including their popular wings. Roxy aptly entitled her food truck, Roxy’s Country Kitchen.\n\nAfter setting up shop, Bert Kelly approached those selling tickets for the evening’s 50/50 drawing.\n\nCathy Woods, one of the rodeo’s committee members, was in charge of selling the tickets.\n\nWoods recalled how when Bert purchased his ticket, he informed her that he would donate his winnings to the featured sponsor of the night, should he win the contest.\n\nThe event’s first night’s sponsor, Operation Flags of Freedom, celebrated the rodeo’s theme, Veteran’s Night. They also purchased a trailer with more than 400 American flags for event officials, who used them throughout the grounds.\n\nApproximately 350 flags were placed along state Route 518 and beside the driveway leading to the arena.\n\nThe second night’s sponsor was Tough Enough to Wear Pink, which focused on Wrangler’s Breast Cancer Awareness Night.\n\nAgain, Bert Kelly purchased 50/50 tickets from Woods, telling her he would donate his winnings to the night’s cause, should he win.\n\nTrue to his word, Kelly won and donated all $806 of his winnings back to the rodeo. The money was to be used toward breast cancer awareness, he announced.\n\n“We thought we were lucky,” Woods commented. “But really, the lucky ones were the organizations who benefited because of both his and our combined donations — Glimmer of Hope and the Pink Eraser Project. They help those battling breast cancer to get the help they need on their journey.”\n\nWoods explained during Veteran’s Night, a skydiver landed on an “X” placed in the center of the arena. She said as he was falling through the sky, he carried with him an American flag.\n\nUpon landing, he folded the flag as the announcer informed the crowd the meaning behind each fold and what it represents.\n\nPrior to the skydive, Woods had selected a veteran from the evening’s audience. He would be the recipient of the flag. The skydiver then presented the flag to the veteran which Woods selected.\n\nIt was a true surprise for the veteran.\n\n“It was a very emotional moment, indeed,” Woods said.\n\nWoods noted her appreciation to those who helped make this year’s rodeo a success, the audience who attended and the Kellys for their generosity.\n\nParticipants such as the Kellys are the ones who make not only the rodeo, but the world, a much better place in which to be a part of, officials stated."
