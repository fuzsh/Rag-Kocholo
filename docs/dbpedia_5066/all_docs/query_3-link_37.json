HEARING “YOU HAVE CANCER” CHANGES EVERYTHING.\n\n“I scheduled a mammogram because I thought it was something you did at 40. I didn’t have any signs or symptoms. Quickly, I was lost in a world of appointments, tests and decisions.

However, what I am grateful for are the amazing heroes that I would never have met without cancer. Countless incredible people that have come into my life and changed it forever. Those that teach you the true meaning of life: people, relationships, living in the moment, and genuine love for each other.”\n\nHEATHER SALAZAR, President and CEO PRG\n\nTHOSE BATTLING CANCER WILL ALWAYS BE OUR HEROES. BUT SO ARE THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN OUR MISSION AND HAVE JOINED THE PRG FAMILY.\n\nFeel good about your donation knowing that you’re making a big difference during someone’s cancer journey. Just knowing someone is out there supporting them might be exactly what is needed to find the strength to fight another day."
