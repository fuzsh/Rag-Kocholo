You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some parts of our Services. Unless you have adjusted your browser settings so that it will refuse cookies, our Services may use cookies.\n\nFlash Cookies. Certain features of our Services may use local stored objects (or Flash Cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences or your activity on our Services. Flash Cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as those used for Browser Cookies.\n\nWeb Beacons. Certain sections of our Services and our emails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of a certain section and verifying system and server integrity).\n\nFor more information about the cookies we use and your choices regarding cookies, please visit our Cookies Policy.\n\n5.

We will however take all necessary measures to protect your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.\n\n6. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?\n\nIn short: We are not responsible for the safety of any information that you share with third-party providers who are featured on, but are not affiliated with, our Website.\n\nThe Website may contain sponsorships from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to other websites, online services, or mobile applications. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy.

HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?\n\nIn short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless otherwise required by law.\n\nWe will only keep your Personal Information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).\n\nWhen we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymize such information or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.\n\nWe will also retain Additional Information for internal analysis purposes. Additional Information is generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our services, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.\n\n8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?\n\nIn short: We aim to protect your Personal Information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.\n\nWe have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any Personal Information we process. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls. All sensitive personal data is stored on a secure database, to which only a limited number of relevant personnel have access. It is deleted when no longer needed by us and is never shared with third parties, except as expressly set forth herein. Payment transactions and related information are processed by third-party payment processors all of which adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS. Within NBCF, we undertake regular reviews of who has access to information that we hold to ensure your information is only accessible by appropriately trained staff, volunteers, and contractors.\n\nHowever, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Information, transmission of personal information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only access the Website within a secure environment.\n\n9.

You have the right to withdraw your consent on using your Personal Information. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide you with access to certain specific functionalities of the Services.\n\nIf you are a resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your Personal Information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm.\n\nIf you are a resident in Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection authorities are available here: https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html.\n\n11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES\n\nMost web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates with your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.\n\n12. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?\n\nIn short: Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your Personal Information.\n\nCalifornia Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year.
