        "text": "Young adults with breast cancer are defined as adults who are diagnosed with breast cancer when they are under the age of 45. For these young people, the disease comes at a time when they often have the most family and social responsibilities and also are working to establish financial independence. The disease, treatment and recovery can all impact both their physical and mental health.\n\nThis website serves as source of helpful resources and tools for young adults with breast cancer (including metastatic cancer), as well as their caregivers, health care providers, and others who are interested in learning more about the disease and helping them improve their quality of life."
