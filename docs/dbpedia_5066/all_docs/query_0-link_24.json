        "text": "These awards give us an opportunity to celebrate our most outstanding volunteers – the individuals who go above and beyond to support Cancer Research UK. Every year, I am hugely inspired by your incredible achievements. Volunteers are the backbone of our charity and we simply couldn’t make the progress we do without your support. I wish to personally thank each one of you for everything you do.\n\nTogether we are beating cancer.\n\nMichelle Mitchell\n\nWe have 14 award categories which recognise volunteers from across Cancer Research UK for their outstanding achievements and commitment.\n\nThe Honorary Fellowships recognise individuals who have shown outstanding loyalty and dedication to the cause over many years, championing the charity in their community. An Honorary Fellowship is the highest accolade that Cancer Research UK can bestow on a volunteer.\n\nThis year, we were delighted to award a special Honorary Fellowship to the outgoing Chair of Cancer Research UK, and previous Flame of Hope Patron, Sir Leszek Borysiewicz.\n\nMarie took part in our very first Race for Life event an amazing 30 years ago, and has been a stalwart fundraiser, ambassador and campaigner ever since. Following her own cancer treatment, Marie’s voice and actions speak volumes, and have reached thousands of people undergoing their own experience. She is living proof that a cancer diagnosis doesn’t mean that you can’t go on to live life to the full and provide hope to others. Marie’s energy is infectious, she inspires and motivates everyone who comes in to contact with her. As she says herself: I realise how lucky I am to be alive, but it’s not just luck, it’s the importance of life saving research!\n\nWhen you think of the words CRUK Ambassador, no one comes more strongly to mind than Patrick. Since joining the Campaigns Ambassador programme in 2013, after losing his wife to cancer, Patrick has passionately backed numerous campaigns, including standardised tobacco packaging, Junk-Free and NHS workforce campaigns. He has developed outstanding relationships with key stakeholders around Wantage and Oxford, including his MP, as well as engaging with thousands via his twitter platform. He has recruited and mentored other ambassadors, helped to create and deliver training sessions and spoken at countless events. In addition, he is a prolific fundraiser, taking part in numerous physical challenges and raising thousands of pounds for the cause. CRUK are incredibly lucky to have him.\n\nPink Events is a true family affair of strength, love, commitment, passion, and community to raise vital awareness of breast cancer research and support in the local Leeds Community. The group, founded in 2005, have reached an astonishing fundraising milestone of £100,000 for Cancer Research UK and continue to hold exciting, fun, and successful events. Pink Events truly deserves this award as Community Organisation of the Year for their togetherness, bravery, boldness, and strength to raise vital funds and champion awareness of breast cancer research, early diagnosis, treatment, and support.\n\nRiverside & Cronton College has organised eight of their own Race for Life events with their fundraising now totalling £30,000. The students’ drive to raise funds for life-saving research is unwavering - organising each event in their own time, requiring minimal support.
