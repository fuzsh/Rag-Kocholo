        "text": "Governor Kathy Hochul today announced that multiple landmarks and bridges across New York will be illuminated in pink, teal and green to recognize Metastatic Breast Cancer Awareness Day. The event focuses on those living with breast cancer that has spread to another part of the body, most commonly the bones, lung, brain, or liver. Metastatic breast cancer is also called Stage IV breast cancer.\n\n“Like many New Yorkers, I’ve witnessed first-hand the devastation of cancer on families,” Governor Hochul said. “As we recognize Metastatic Breast Cancer Awareness Day, I encourage all New Yorkers to join us in supporting survivors and those still living with cancer, remembering those lost to cancer, and celebrating the health care providers who work every day to help individuals in their battle against cancer.”\n\nNew York State Department of Health Commissioner Dr. James V. McDonald said, “October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month and we are reminded about the seriousness of metastatic breast cancer, the need for continued research, new treatments, and hope for a better future for those living with metastatic breast cancer.”\n\nBreast cancer can come back in another part of the body months or years after the original diagnosis and treatment. The cancer that has spread is still breast cancer and does not become bone cancer or liver cancer or lung cancer. Under a microscope, the tumor cells still look and act like breast cancer and are treated as breast cancer. Researchers at this time can’t explain why this metastatic disease occurs, but they’re working on finding answers. While there is no cure for metastatic breast cancer, treatment may control it for a number of years.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, besides skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer among U.S. and New York women. One in eight women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime, and in New York State, nearly 16,700 new cases and 2,500 deaths from breast cancer are recorded each year. The risk of breast cancer increases with age and varies across racial groups. Black females are more likely to have breast cancer diagnosed at an advanced stage and die from the disease.\n\nThese 15 landmarks and bridges will be illuminated in pink, teal and green:\n\nOne World Trade Center\n\nGovernor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge\n\nKosciuszko Bridge\n\nThe H. Carl McCall SUNY Building\n\nState Education Building\n\nAlfred E. Smith State Office Building\n\nEmpire State Plaza\n\nState Fairgrounds – Main Gate & Expo Center\n\nNiagara Falls\n\nThe “Franklin D. Roosevelt” Mid-Hudson Bridge\n\nAlbany International Airport Gateway\n\nMTA LIRR - East End Gateway at Penn Station\n\nFairport Lift Bridge Over the Erie Canal\n\nMoynihan Train Hall\n\nWalkway Over the Hudson State Historic Park\n\nMammograms are the best way to find breast cancer early, when it may be easier to treat and before there are any signs or symptoms of a problem. New York State has some of the most aggressive laws to remove financial barriers to mammography. New Yorkers with health insurance policies covered by NYS law do not have to pay any out-of-pocket costs for breast cancer screening and diagnostic imaging. Learn more here.\n\nFor individuals who do not have health insurance, the New York State Cancer Services Program offers free breast cancer screening and diagnostics services to eligible individuals. Call (866) 442-2262 to find a CSP near you."
