        "text": "Family and friends\n\nFamily and friends (especially spouses, partners and children) often play key roles in supporting those they love through the tough times of a breast cancer diagnosis and treatment [1].\n\nHowever, breast cancer can strain relationships. Some people notice a withdrawal of emotional support from close friends and family members [2]. At a time when they are needed most, the people close to you may be less supportive than usual, even if they want to help. This can happen to anyone, for many reasons. Talk with those close to you and tell them what you need from them.\n\nIt’s important to seek support from others if you need it. Even when close relationships are not strained, other sources of support, such as support groups, can help.\n\nFind a list of local, online and telephone social support.\n\nSupport groups and one-on-one therapy\n\nSupport groups can be an important resource for people with breast cancer. They help increase your support network.\n\nSupport groups vary in their focus. Some groups mainly provide information and education. Others focus on emotional support.\n\nThere are in-person support groups and online support networks. Some people prefer to meet one-on-one with a counselor.\n\nLearn more about support groups and how to find one that’s right for you.\n\nLearn more about counseling and how to find a therapist.\n\nSpiritual and religious organizations\n\nSpiritual and religious faith can be a source of strength and help some people cope with a breast cancer diagnosis [3].\n\nReligious communities offer a close-knit and supportive environment, and some host support groups for people living with cancer.\n\nSocial support may be linked to improved quality of life for people diagnosed with breast cancer [1,4-10]. However, study findings on social support and survival are mixed [11-18].\n\nCohort studies suggest women with breast cancer who have more social support have better survival than those with less support [11-14]. Randomized controlled trials, however, suggest no survival benefit from support groups [15-18].\n\nThe difference in findings may be due to the types of social support studied.\n\nCohort studies have mostly studied the social support people get from social networks, such as friends and family. Randomized trials have mostly studied social support from strangers, such as cancer survivor support groups.\n\nMore studies are needed to know whether there’s a difference between these types of social support and breast cancer survival.\n\nHealth care providers (including patient navigators and social workers), hospitals and religious organizations (such as churches and synagogues) can help you find a local support group.\n\nJoining a support group (in-person, online or telephone) that’s linked to a hospital or other health organization is a good way to be sure the information about breast cancer you get is correct.\n\nThe Komen Breast Care Helpline 1-877 GO KOMEN (1-877-465-6636) can help you find local, online or telephone support programs.\n\nSusan G.

There’s no right or wrong way to discuss your diagnosis with your children, but it’s important to tell them. Even small children can sense something is going on. If you don’t talk with them, children may fill in the gaps with their imagination and misinformation.\n\nLet you children know there will be times when you are tired and times when you are sad.\n\nYou want to give your children information and support. Your children may have a strong emotional response to your breast cancer diagnosis. Find a quiet time to talk with them when you’re feeling in control of your emotions so you can give them the support they need and answer any questions they may have.\n\nKeep in mind children need to [20-21]:\n\nBe told about the diagnosis in a way that’s suited to their age and state of mind.\n\nBe involved in family discussions about a parent’s breast cancer.\n\nFeel comfortable asking questions about breast cancer\n\nShare their emotions.\n\nBe watched for signs of emotional distress.\n\nSome children may benefit from a support group for children who have a parent with cancer.
