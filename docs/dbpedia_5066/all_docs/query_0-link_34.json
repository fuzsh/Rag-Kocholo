        "text": "Radiation therapy is integral in the management of early-stage, locally advanced, and metastatic breast cancer cases. It is utilized in approximately 87% of breast cancer patients3 – accounting for more than 25% of cases in most departments4.\n\nOver the last two decades advances in technology have dramatically improved treatment techniques and accuracy. This has allowed minimized doses to organs at risk (OAR) while maintaining excellent local control5. We should all be proud of the advanced treatment techniques and technologies that have made those improvements possible.\n\nHowever, the projected number of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases is expected to grow by over 40% by 2040, which is about 3 million cases per year. This is a challenge for many countries that need to improve access to quality diagnosis and treatment. The impact of COVID-19 in different world regions remains largely unknown. But, reports show an increase in the diagnosis of node-positive and stage III breast cancer after an interruption in screening services. WHO is making global efforts to target the whole continuum of breast cancer control to tackle the overall burden of this disease6.\n\nThis accessibility challenge is at the core of Accuray’s Vision: To expand the curative power of radiation therapy to improve as many lives as possible.\n\nVitalHold technology is a collaborative innovation born out of the partnership between Accuray and C-RAD, a renowned leader in SGRT technology. C-RAD’s proven Catalyst+ HD SGRT technology perfectly fits the Radixact System’s ultra-precise capabilities. And C-RAD’s mission is a perfect match for Accuray, as we both strive together to develop products that enable clinicians to deliver superior treatment outcomes to all patients. Catalyst+ HD projects visual guidance directly on the patient’s skin, continuously tracking and correcting for patient movements — without any tattoos, markers or fiducials.\n\nClinics can now deliver DIBH treatment workflows that they’re used to. Giving patients greater comfort and a less-disruptive treatment option, all within a 10-minute time slot.\n\nMany of the advances in cancer treatment have introduced specialty technologies to treat complex irradiated volumes. The reality is that patients have limited access to these technologies, as it’s simply not economically practical for many radiotherapy clinics to invest in multiple specialty tools.\n\nAccuray developed the Radixact System to address this challenge, creating a single system that can deliver precision for the full spectrum of cases. The addition of VitalHold will dramatically extend the usability of the Radixact system — and significantly strengthens the business case for radiotherapy clinics to make the investment in the Radixact System. VitalHold will enable clinics to treat a high volume of DIBH cases without making compromises between treatment precision and clinical efficiency. It enables clinicians to deliver a range of treatment volumes from simple to complex on the very same system.\n\nThe Radixact System delivers some of the most sophisticated breast cancer treatments available today. The world’s first helical radiotherapy platform, gives clinicians the flexibility to adapt radiation therapy to any breast cancer patient’s anatomy, delivering optimal coverage to target volumes with minimized cardiac dose and organ at risk exposure. Fully integrated daily imaging gives clinicians confidence in accurate patient set-up and the ability to reduce margins.\n\nThe humbling statistics around the incidence and impact of breast cancer give us a needed jolt of awareness. Vigilant screening and early detection are the first line of defense. But continued progress in treatment keeps death rates on a downward trajectory. This gives breast cancer patients more hope than ever for better outcomes.\n\nAt Accuray, we’re proud to continue our legacy of leadership in breast cancer treatment with the introduction of VitalHold. Now, clinics don’t have to choose between precision, efficiency and versatility. The Radixact System with VitalHold is intended to give clinicians the ability to treat the full spectrum of breast cases. Without compromise and with maximum patient comfort in mind to help improve patient outcomes.\n\nLearn more about VitalHold for the Radixact System here."
