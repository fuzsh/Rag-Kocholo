        "text": "Our CEO, Sarah Powell, shared insights from the international study she leads at ESMO - European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Madrid. The study focuses on the challenges women with breast cancer face when seeking genetic testing and counselling. We continue to see increases in people accessing our support and online information, and from the study, 38% of patients turn to patient support groups like Pink Hope. This shows that peer support and informed options are important for people navigating the complex world of genetic testing. You can read more about the study results here: https://lnkd.in/ehaPr6Fb and https://lnkd.in/exusKJPA #pinkhopeaus #informeddecisions #cancerrisk\n\nAlejandro wanted to make a difference. Believing his Mexican-American ancestry would add diversity to Mayo Clinic's broad population DNA sequencing study in the Fall of 2021, he agreed to participate. Study participants received screening for three highly actionable conditions: familial hypercholesterolemia, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (BRCA1/2) and Lynch syndrome. Alejandro's screening unexpectedly revealed he had Lynch syndrome when a PMS2 gene mutation was identified. As Alejandro's team of genetic counselors from Mayo Clinic educated him about Lynch syndrome, he learned his blood relatives could also carry the mutation. They also needed to undergo genetic testing to see if they were at an increased risk of the cancers known to be related to Lynch syndrome, including colon, uterine, stomach, small bowel, kidney and other cancers. After educating Alejandro about Lynch syndrome, his Mayo Clinic team scheduled a colonoscopy for him. In Alejandro's words, \"...that's when my doctor found a 30mm cancerous tumor in my colon. Thankfully, it was caught early. If I had not received genetic testing, at some point, I would have noticed symptoms. But by then, it probably would have been too late....I was lucky. I feel very, very thankful to have participated in the research study.\" Stories like Alejandro's add support to continuing discussions about the need for universal germline genetic testing--especially in genes which are known to result in cancers that can be preventable/actionable. March is National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, and Lynch Syndrome Awareness Day is March 22nd. I challenge everyone to spread awareness about colorectal cancer and Lynch syndrome this month--your actions just might save a life!

Take action, Take control as a campaign focuses on genetic screening for changes or mutations in two key genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, as well as others. The hospital and Canadian Cancer Society estimate that BRCA mutations predispose people to a higher lifetime risk of cancers compared with the average lifetime risk in the general population: Breast cancer: 70% vs. 13% Ovarian cancer: 20-40% vs. 1.4% Prostate cancer: 35% vs. 12% Researchers say Black people are vastly underrepresented in their Screen Project program, making up for only 1.5% of participants since it‚Äôs launch in 2017. The screening can be done through blood tests, cheek swabs or saliva samples. The Screen Project is also promoting saliva based self-test kits for a fee and results take up to eight weeks. While many provincial programs cover the testing and genetic counselling depending on immediate family history, other people with a less direct connection to cancer may choose to pay out of pocket for direct-to-consumer testing, which provide results alone and may not include genetic counselling.

Myriad Genetics, Inc., a leader in genetic testing and precision medicine, revealed new nationwide survey results indicating widespread confusion and misconceptions about ovarian cancer screening among a majority of women. The survey results indicated that nearly three out of four women (71%) falsely believe annual pap smears include testing for #ovariancancer. The results further underscored the dire need to break down any confusion about ovarian cancer, including symptoms and screening, to help women better understand their cancer risk and how to take appropriate preventative measures. https://lnkd.in/e5ZBTAUX #cancerresearch\n\nEverything Genetic's 12 Gene Breast Cancer Panel Gains Momentum! Since the launch of our own brand genetic testing service in April last year, we're pleased to share that the Everything Genetic 12 Gene Breast Cancer Panel has rapidly gained widespread acceptance, now available in over 45 hospitals and clinics across the UK. Leading the charge in integrating this ground-breaking genetic testing service into clinical practice was our Medical Director, Dr James Mackay. Dr Mackay shared his insights on the overwhelming positive response from the healthcare market: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pleased to see the widespread acceptance of our 12 Gene Breast Cancer Panel within the UK healthcare community. Beyond its targeted genetic insights, the panel offers an industry-changing combination of a UK-based service, fast results turnaround, and an accessible price point. In a field where time is critical, our commitment to delivering timely genetic information empowers healthcare professionals to make informed decisions for their breast and ovarian cancer patients swiftly, ultimately improving patient outcomes. The feedback I have had from my patients I have recommended this test to has been very positive. Together, we're reshaping the landscape of cancer diagnostics for a brighter and healthier future.‚Äù If you'd like to learn more about our 12 Gene Breast Cancer Panel, feel free to: Visit our website: https://buff.ly/4b1a3NY Call us: +44 (0) 1270 623 179 Email us: cancertesting@everythinggeneticltd.co.uk #EverythingGenetic #GeneticTesting #BRCA1 #BRCA2 #CancerDiagnostics #Oncology #HereditaryCancer #BreastCancerTreatment\n\nA new report was published late last year in JAMA Oncology on the potential of including genetic screening information to aid in identifying women at lower risk of breast cancer. In this case-controlled study of over 25,000 women, approximately 9% were classified as having low genetic risk for breast cancer (based on polygenic risk score). These women exhibited significantly proportionally fewer cancers, indicating a potential to individualize screening plans for women based on risk. Check out this concise, valuable resource for understanding the importance of using both high- and low-risk genetic screening strategies for risk stratification, underscoring the value of genetics in individualizing the onset of breast cancer screening: https://lnkd.in/g9f-jrST #KnowYourRisk #meded #bcsm #FOAMed"
