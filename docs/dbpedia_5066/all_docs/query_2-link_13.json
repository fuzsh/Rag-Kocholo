        "text": "üå∏ October: Embrace Pink for Breast Cancer Awareness üå∏ Breast cancer, impacting 1 in 8 women in the US and 2.3 million worldwide, is a battle that touches the lives of many. However, it's a fight we can win through early detection and unwavering support. During this Breast Cancer Awareness Month, let's stand together to disseminate knowledge, promote screenings, and inspire early detection and hope. Our mission is crystal clear: empower everyone to recognize the significance of early detection. At Dhiti Omics, we firmly believe in the power of knowledge when it comes to your health. Genetic testing is a pivotal tool that enables you to comprehend your unique risk factors, including those related to breast cancer and other health conditions. Join us in supporting those affected by breast cancer and advocating for a healthier world. Together, we can strive for a future where breast cancer is better understood and preventable. Explore Dhiti Omics for more information. Contact us for details.

The new guideline makes evidence-based recommendations on how to identify and manage familial and genetic risk of ovarian cancer.üî¨ The guidance suggests several changes to current practice, which includes: - Changing the testing requirements. Having only one relative with ovarian cancer will now make you eligible for testing. - People who are Ashkenazi Jewish,Sephardi Jewish and Greenlander will automatically be eligible for testing. - All with invasive epithelial ovarian cancer are eligible for testing. Read our blog post about the new NICE guideline here to learn more - https://lnkd.in/eZKAEn9Z\n\nHow can we improve cancer prevention and empower high-risk individuals? Kirsty Wydenbach, our Head of Regulatory Strategy, will be joining the ever popular BioTuesday event next week to discuss oncology precision prevention treatments and the expected impact on people with high-risk conditions. Sarah Blagden will kick off the event with a 30-minute keynote, followed by a 60-minute chaired discussion where Kirsty will be joined by Anna Fry, Catherine Pollard and Glen Clack to explore the exciting field of precision prevention ‚Äì using biological insights to tailor cancer interventions to those most at risk. Here at Weatherden, we're committed to accelerating the development of new treatments, and precision prevention holds immense potential for saving lives. We can‚Äôt wait to dig into some of the most exciting innovations in cancer prevention trials and how they could improve the lives of those affected by a high-risk condition.

Did you know that hereditary factors play a significant role in prostate cancer risk? This type of cancer affects around 52,300 men every year, which accounts for 27% of all new cancer cases in males in the UK. We are dedicated to empowering individuals with knowledge about their genetic predispositions. Our Hereditary Cancer Testing Service provides insights into a person‚Äôs risk factors, including those related to prostate cancer. Early detection and proactive management are key in the fight against all cancer types. Visit our page: https://bit.ly/43ppT1D, to learn more about our testing service and how it can help you make informed choices. #ProstateCancer #HereditaryCancer #InformedGenomics #CancerRisk #CancerAwareness #ProstateCancerUK Prostate Cancer UK\n\nThe World Ovarian Cancer Coalition, IGCS.org, and International Gynecologic Cancer Advocacy Network partners have released a Global Call to Action to reduce disparities in Uterine Cancer. Read the consensus statement, available in 9 languages: https://bit.ly/ucam-cs Uterine cancer affects women of all backgrounds, but disparities persist in detecting and treating the disease based on race, ethnicity, income, region, and access to care. To improve the lives of patients and slow the rising number of cases, especially in underserved populations, we need to act now. We must all work together to increase awareness and advocate for early diagnoses, better treatments, and improved support for survivors. #UterineCancer #WombCancer #EndometrialCancer #UterineCancerAwarenessMonth\n\nüåçüéóÔ∏è Today is #WorldHeadandNeckCancerDay üéóÔ∏èüåç and at Loma Therapeutics, we're proud to be part of the global fight against this challenging disease. Head and neck cancers, particularly those associated with HPV, are a significant health concern. Did you know that the incidence of HPV-positive head-neck cancer is growing in the US and most European countries, and that the cases per year have surpassed cervical cancer in these countries? Our team at Loma Therapeutics is dedicated to progressing our therapies to provide hope and improved outcomes for patients battling HPV-positive head and neck cancer. Join us in raising awareness, supporting ongoing research, and celebrating the strides being made in the fight against head and neck cancer. #HPV #CancerResearch #HealthcareInnovation #LomaTherapeutics #FightCancer #PatientCare\n\nMore than 3 in 4 colon cancers occur in people with no known risk factors1 ‚Äì meaning that generally good health or a lack of family history can‚Äôt guarantee protection from colon cancer. Regardless of risk level, with colon cancer incidence rates rising in individuals under 552, it‚Äôs more important than ever to get screened early and often. CheckIt4Andretti is proud to partner with Polymedco in the effort to improve access to top screening solutions, including annual FIT screening with OC-Auto FIT. Follow Polymedco and support their efforts to save more lives through early detection 1.Who is at risk for colon cancer? Colon Cancer Coalition.

Rare cancers represent a complicated constitute an unmet need with limited therapeutic options and fewer trials. Although rare cancers, are by definition, uncommon, as a group rare cancers constitute ~22% of the cancer burden. As there are limited approved lines of therapy for every type of cancer and biomarker-driven subtype, adaptive clinical trials of novel design including pantumour trials, platform protocols and initiatives such as the Omico PrOSPeCT study take centre stage for rare cancers.\n\nThis fall, I had the privilege to work with the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network team lead by the fabulous Jodi Lipe, as a consulting creative director on their Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month campaign, which kicked off this week. PanCAN partnered with pancreatic cancer survivor Maria Menounous to spread the word about this deadly disease. Besides our spot with Maria, posted below, we also interviewed other pancreatic cancer survivors and family members to create spots to share their stories. Special shout out to creative partners Amy Webber at PAIDEIA and Azin Shamma at Little Tiger as well as Donna Queza, Doug Barasch, Allison Garrison, Julie Vasquez, and Jillian Scholten and everyone on the PanCAN team. Pancreatic Cancer is a serious disease. I did not know a lot about it before the project, but I learned a lot in a short period of time. Bottom line, it's important to know your risks, your family history, and to understand the symptoms. To learn more go to PanCAN.org."
