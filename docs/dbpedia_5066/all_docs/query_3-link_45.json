        "text": "Welcome to Ribbon of Hope\n\nOur mission is to be a financial, informational and emotional resource for individuals with breast cancer in Northeastern Wisconsin. Ribbon of Hope assists breast cancer patients regardless of age, gender, race or religion.\n\nThe Ribbon of Hope Foundation is thankful for the the continued and generous support of the Favre4Hope Foundation\n\nRibbon of Hope\n\nRibbon of Hope was founded in 2003 by a small group of passionate and energetic breast cancer survivors (and one very loving spouse) who wanted to support area individuals on their breast cancer journeys. Their strong desire to offer emotional, informational, and financial support, coupled with strategic fundraising and generous friends and family, allowed us to fund $13,000 in support during our inaugural year. Since then, our ties within the community have strengthened, our fundraising efforts have expanded, and the need for support has grown exponentially.\n\nToday, we continue to be a fully volunteer organization with the same mission as when we began. We are governed by a Board of Directors and supported by dozens of committed volunteers, hundreds of generous friends, and a request committee that reviews applications for financial support.\n\nWe offer emotional and informational support to any person diagnosed with breast cancer who contacts our office. We offer financial support, in the form of grants, for treatment-related expenses."
