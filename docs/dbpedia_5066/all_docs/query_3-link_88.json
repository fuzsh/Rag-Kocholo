        "text": "Hope Connections fills an unmet need in DC, Maryland, and Virginia by providing, in a homelike setting (and also virtually), free programs of support, education, and hope for people with cancer and their loved ones. Hospital support groups focus on those under clinical care whose needs vary as much as their diagnoses do. Support is also there for those just out of treatment who suffer from the long-term downstream effects of the disease or the treatment. As survival rates improve, more people also need long-term emotional support and groups for individuals with cancer and their caregivers are available for as long as the participant needs them. Educational workshops, stress reduction programs, mind-body activities like yoga, pink pilates, and meditation, and social gatherings  all are a real lifeline. As one participant put it, HC is the glue that holds my life together.\n\nHeadquarters: MD-Montgomery County\n\nWhere They Operate: MD-Montgomery County\n\nAge Groups Served: Young adult (18-24); Adult (25-49); Seniors (50+)\n\nEthnic Groups Served: African American; Asian American; Caucasian; Latino/Hispanic; Other\n\nPopulation(s) Served: All\n\nNotes: The Wellness Community is located in Bethesda, MD, and serves people with cancer and their loved ones throughout the Greater Washington region.
