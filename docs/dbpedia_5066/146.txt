Pink is Just a Color

People wear pink in October to show support to those diagnosed and living with breast cancer. Have you ever thought about those that will never recover from this disease and will be in treatment for the remainder of their lives? To these people, pink doesn’t seem like enough.

“Thank you! Thank you for Twisted Pink. What a truly great organization you have created.

Unfortunately, many people don’t understand the true gravity of what a diagnosis of metastatic disease really means. As you know, I lost my wife at the young age of 45. She was diagnosed at 33. Twelve years. That’s an eternity. Those twelve years brought many great memories. Those twelve years mean my 3 kiddos will always remember their mother. Those twelve years mean they are who they are today and tomorrow because their mother helped mold them into compassionate, well rounded, and, for lack of a better term, good human beings. If it wasn’t for an organization like Twisted Pink, Jenny may not have lived anywhere close to another 12 years. A good part of her perseverance was her strong will, her determination, and her love of her children. However, without dollars being funded towards research which is earmarked for metastatic disease, Jenny and many other women and men like her, would have no hope. They would have no options to give them the opportunity to allow their children the privilege of knowing who they are, of allowing them the ability to live another day. Thank you!”
