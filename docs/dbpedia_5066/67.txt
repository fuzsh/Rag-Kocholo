Another cracking week at Pink Hope. It started with some education for many wonderful Ovarian Cancer Australia Teal nurses, about hereditary cancer risk and the information and support we provide to patients. Then a community catch up in Sydney on Friday night with women with hereditary cancer risk. On Saturday we held the last of our 2024 Information and Support days in Sydney. It was great to have provided evidence-based information (straight from the experts) to over 40 people, who will now be able to make informed decisions about managing their cancer risk. Thanks to our panel members for giving up their time to support this import event: Dr Shweta Srinivasa, Dr Jemma Gilchrist, Bernard Riley, Dr Kylie Snook, Dr Greg Gard, Dr Ceri Cashell and Dr Devora Lieberman. And because we don't do things in halves at Pink Hope, we got up bright and early this morning to take on the City to Surf with a team of over 80! Special mention to Caitlyn who organised all of her family and friends to participate. And the guy in the photo holding the camera (Glenn Nicholls). He has been supporting us with exquisite photos for years. Today, Glenn and his colleague Robert Nixon stood for hours snapping people in Pink Hope tops during the run - look out for the reel! And the last piccy is of the cake I (later regretted) eating on Saturday night before the run - who doesn't üíï a photo of cake. While I was eating regret cake, Pink Hope CEO Sarah Powell was busy at the Human Genetics Society of Australasia - HGSA conference where she's presenting the MAGENTA study which she led. We can't do any of this without support, so thanks to everyone who made these activities successful. #informeddecisions #genetics #hereditarycancerrisk #citytosurf Charlotte Durazza Sarah Powell

Robyn, our Programs and Advocacy Manager, and Charlotte, our Events and Fundraising Coordinator, attended the 2024 Essential Health Summit hosted by the Australian Primary Health Care Nurses Association (APNA) and Australasian Society of Lifestyle Medicine last week.

Our heartfelt thank you to our community members who participated in Project Shirley; a nationwide research initiative for breast cancer patients. The survey has uncovered invaluable insights into the challenges faced by our community impacted by breast cancer. Among these challenges are the fear of recurrence, the difficulty in fully understanding the risk of recurrence and potential treatment options, and more. We also found that some respondents felt that the perception of early breast cancer as the 'good' cancer prevented them from discussing their fears and challenges openly. The study highlights an urgent need for emotional support, evidence-based resources, and services to better understand their options while living with breast cancer. We are in the process of publishing these critical insights from Project Shirley next year. If you participated in Project Shirley and are comfortable sharing your voice even further, including in the media, please DM or email us at info@pinkhope.org.au Thank you for being the #voice of #ProjectShirley. This survey was conducted by Elbow Insight and Strategy on behalf of Pink Hope and a Pharmaceutical Company. #research #study #breastcancer #advocacy #pinkhopeaus

We had an impactful weekend in Melbourne, starting with a relaxing dinner at our Community Catch Up last Friday. It was wonderful to see such a great turnout and connect with both new and familiar faces. The evening was filled with lively conversations, delicious food, all while sharing experiences and discussing the needs and challenges within our community. Then we had an insightful afternoon at our Information and Support Day on Saturday. We were privileged to hear from a brilliant panel of experts who delved into essential topics such as genetic testing, cancer risk management, screening programs, mental health, menopause, IVF/PGD, and the latest research. A special thank you to our panel and to Belinda, our community member, for sharing her powerful story and message of support. Sunday morning brought perfect weather for Run Melbourne. It was a joy to lace up our running shoes and hit the streets alongside our community member Louise in stunning sunshine. A special shoutout to Louise for her incredible fundraising efforts! We extend our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who made this weekend possible. Special thanks to AstraZeneca for supporting our educational events. Thank you to Sue and Lynette from My Breast Cancer RISK (MyBRISK) NHMRC Centre of Research Excellence for generously hosting and supporting our event. A big thanks to The Cupcake Queens for their delicious cupcake donation that fuelled our Saturday.
