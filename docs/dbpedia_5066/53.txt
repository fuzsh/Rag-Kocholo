COPPERAS COVE, TX â€” According to the American Cancer Society, more than 1 million new cancer cases will be diagnosed this year alone. The disease is often grueling for the mind, body and wallet. However, a local organization is working to offer cancer survivors a day of relief to combat the pain.

Runway of Hope is dedicated to giving cancer survivors a day they deserve after all they've been through.

Pink Warrior Angels of TX is looking for cancer survivors of all ages, cancer types and genders to hit the runway and strike a pose.

Their first ever Runway of Hope will kick off October 18th at 6:30 p.m. at the Killeen Civic and Conference Center.

Pink Warrior Angels of Texas was founded by Julie Moser, a breast cancer survivor who felt extremely alone during her treatments. At the time, she and her family had no one to turn to who had actually experienced cancer first hand.

Runway of Hope is just one of many events she has created to make sure cancer survivors and thrivers are equipped with resources to help them throughout their journey.

"You know to be able to feel whole and like a woman again, is so important. So with Runway of Hope, what we're bringing in is a day of pampering, a day of empowerment for all the cancer survivors of any age, male, female to know that what they have been through, you have accomplished something huge," said Moser.

She came up with the idea after participating in a New York Fashion Week runway show for cancer survivors not too long ago.

Tickets for the event are on sale now and sponsorship opportunities are still available. The event will also feature dinner, entertainment and live auctions.

"We have to beat this, and [this is] the way we can beat it. This organization helps families, survivors, the ones who went on to be angels. We need it. We need your support," said Tyra Charmant, a breast cancer survivor who will participate in the event.

All proceeds go toward providing direct support for cancer survivors.
