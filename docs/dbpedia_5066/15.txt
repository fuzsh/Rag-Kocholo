Welcome to Pink Hope!

Pink Hope was born out of a personal (family) experience with breast cancer. Jeff felt that the needs of a person with breast cancer are unique. Therefore, great attention to details where essential in meeting this need.

The environment is extremely important. Even though insurance companies use codes and refer to mastectomy products as DMEs (durable medical equipment) undergoing breast cancer is extremely personal and we understand the respect our customers deserve.

Pink Hope stands out as the leading boutique in Wilmington. We hope that you visit our boutique in person and yes, we are open during these difficult times. Whether you are going through breast cancer yourself or know someone who is, we have products to help support everyone.

The lady that helped me wad Kathy. Her knowledge and phenomenal compassion is the absolute best. She made me feel so comfortable....and had this way of assuring me that things will be better!! The world could use a few million more ladies like Kathy at Pink Hope . She goes above and beyond to help. I will travel 6 hours to go back to this shop... If Kathy is there!!! God bless you and thank you so much for your kindness and knowledge.

Pink Hope is simply the best! Yvonne and her team truly care about their customers and see them as more than a client, but as beautiful women sensing to regain their sense of self. Every interaction with Pink Hope was warm and personal. Their office in Wilmington felt more like a spa than a "waiting room". My mother loved the pink and uplifting, yet private environment. Every step of the process from consultation, to fitting was simply outstanding. Yvonne gave my mother the much needed comfort and care she needed in this difficult time. She will definitely recommend to all her friends and family in need of this valued service.
