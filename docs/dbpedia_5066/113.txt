Pink Power is a 501(c)(3) organization that raises money and awareness for local breast cancer patients in need and brings people together to celebrate survivors and share stories of hope.

Since its inception in 2017 and as of December 2023, Pink Power has raised an astounding $877,000 and has donated $802,000 to our beneficiaries- WellSpan Cancer Center, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Penn State Cancer Institute, and Pink Ink Project. Our mission would not be possible without the generosity and extraordinary support from our community.Â

âI come from a long line of breast cancer warriors in my family, who taught me the importance of helping others and to use my life as an opportunity to give back. I am grateful for the generosity and support of our community who makes our mission possible. It is extremely rewarding knowing that together, we can make a difference.â

The highlight of our annual event is celebrating our survivors. We raise a glass to the gift of life as we inspire and give hope to our survivor sisters. Please consider making a donation to Pink Power so we can continue to help our fellow breast cancer patients in need.
