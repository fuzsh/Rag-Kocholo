        "text": "Enacted Legislation\n\nWise was the primary sponsor of 2 bills that were enacted:\n\nH.R. 2848 (101st): Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act Amendments of 1989\n\nH.R. 3082 (100th): Methanol and Alternative Fuels Promotion Act of 1987\n\nView All »\n\nDoes 2 not sound like a lot? Very few bills are ever enacted — most legislators sponsor only a handful that are signed into law. But there are other legislative activities that we don’t track that are also important, including offering amendments, committee work and oversight of the other branches, and constituent services.\n\nWe consider a bill enacted if one of the following is true: a) it is enacted itself, b) it has a companion bill in the other chamber (as identified by Congress) which was enacted, or c) if at least about half of its provisions were incorporated into bills that were enacted (as determined by an automated text analysis, applicable beginning with bills in the 110th Congress).\n\nVoting Record\n\nMissed Votes\n\nFrom Jan 1983 to Dec 2000, Wise missed 622 of 9,434 roll call votes, which is 6.6%. This is much worse than the median of 3.0% among the lifetime records of representatives serving in Dec 2000. The chart below reports missed votes over time.\n\nWe don’t track why legislators miss votes, but it’s often due to medical absenses, major life events, and running for higher office.\n\nShow the numbers...\n\nTime Period Votes Eligible Missed Votes Percent Percentile 1983 Jan-Mar 43 1 2.3% 13th 1983 Apr-Jun 182 1 0.5% 4th 1983 Jul-Sep 130 5 3.8% 48th 1983 Oct-Nov 143 6 4.2% 38th 1984 Jan-Mar 53 2 3.8% 37th 1984 Apr-Jun 223 17 7.6% 60th 1984 Jul-Sep 96 6 6.2% 60th 1984 Oct-Oct 36 0 0.0% 0th 1985 Jan-Mar 36 5 13.9% 77th 1985 Apr-Jun 154 10 6.5% 68th 1985 Jul-Sep 101 3 3.0% 42nd 1985 Oct-Dec 148 4 2.7% 42nd 1986 Jan-Mar 61 4 6.6% 54th 1986 Apr-Jun 128 11 8.6% 89th 1986 Jul-Sep 202 0 0.0% 0th 1986 Oct-Oct 60 1 1.7% 37th 1987 Jan-Mar 39 0 0.0% 0th 1987 Apr-Jun 187 9 4.8% 57th 1987 Jul-Sep 95 7 7.4% 77th 1987 Oct-Dec 167 17 10.2% 72nd 1988 Feb-Mar 49 3 6.1% 61st 1988 Apr-Jun 161 8 5.0% 60th 1988 Jul-Sep 152 7 4.6% 56th 1988 Oct-Oct 89 5 5.6% 63rd 1989 Jan-Mar 14 1 7.1% 57th 1989 Apr-Jun 105 5 4.8% 64th 1989 Jul-Sep 128 9 7.0% 87th 1989 Oct-Nov 121 12 9.9% 85th 1990 Jan-Mar 60 0 0.0% 0th 1990 Apr-Jun 150 7 4.7% 70th 1990 Jul-Sep 183 5 2.7% 48th 1990 Oct-Oct 143 5 3.5% 54th 1991 Jan-Mar 62 4 6.5% 79th 1991 Apr-Jun 139 9 6.5% 79th 1991 Jul-Sep 81 3 3.7% 49th 1991 Oct-Nov 162 5 3.1% 60th 1992 Jan-Mar 66 3 4.5% 57th 1992 Apr-Jun 185 15 8.1% 84th 1992 Jul-Sep 196 15 7.7% 84th 1992 Oct-Oct 41 3 7.3% 66th 1993 Jan-Mar 127 3 2.4% 52nd 1993 Apr-Jun 190 12 6.3% 76th 1993 Jul-Sep 164 4 2.4% 62nd 1993 Oct-Nov 134 5 3.7% 74th 1994 Jan-Mar 95 4 4.2% 65th 1994 Apr-Jun 219 6 2.7% 62nd 1994 Jul-Sep 142 7 4.9% 72nd 1994 Oct-Nov 51 0 0.0% 0th 1995 Jan-Mar 279 4 1.4% 54th 1995 Apr-Jun 189 10 5.3% 82nd 1995 Jul-Sep 232 5 2.2% 58th 1995 Oct-Dec 185 3 1.6% 45th 1996 Jan-Mar 110 1 0.9% 35th 1996 Apr-Jun 182 19 10.4% 94th 1996 Jul-Sep 163 4 2.5% 57th 1997 Jan-Mar 71 4 5.6% 77th 1997 Apr-Jun 174 11 6.3% 87th 1997 Jul-Sep 232 6 2.6% 62nd 1997 Oct-Nov 163 6 3.7% 63rd 1998 Jan-Mar 89 4 4.5% 71st 1998 Apr-Jun 185 11 5.9% 83rd 1998 Jul-Sep 199 6 3.0% 64th 1998 Oct-Dec 74 6 8.1% 85th 1999 Jan-Mar 77 4 5.2% 77th 1999 Apr-Jun 184 8 4.3% 76th 1999 Jul-Sep 204 11 5.4% 83rd 1999 Oct-Nov 146 22 15.1% 97th 2000 Jan-Mar 95 7 7.4% 75th 2000 Apr-Jun 277 74 26.7% 98th 2000 Jul-Sep 130 33 25.4% 97th 2000 Oct-Dec 101 89 88.1% 98th"
