        "text": "Fun facts.\n\n1. If Alejandro G. Iñárritu wins Best Director at the DGA, he will make history not only by becoming the first Mexican-born director to win two DGA awards, but also the first director ever to win two DGA awards in consecutive years. And with Alfonso Cuaron winning the previous year, it would be the third straight year a Mexican-born director has taken the DGA.\n\n2. If either Adam McKay or Tom McCarthy win the DGA, it will be only the third time an American-born director has won since 2009 (the others are Kathryn Bigelow and Ben Affleck). If either wins the Oscar for directing, he’ll be the first American director to win since 2009, breaking a five-year streak — the longest in Oscar history — that no American-born director has won. Technically, Ang Lee is Taiwanese-born but according to most sources he is a naturalized American citizen.\n\nThis is the strangest Oscar race I’ve seen a while, maybe since 2000. Usually there are two movies pushing through to the top of the heap, sometimes three. This year, we have four. The major wins thus far have been split up all over the place. Stats can’t tell us what’s going to happen. They can only tell us what has happened in the past. How rare are splits? Pretty rare. Do winners sometimes pop up out of the blue? Sometimes. Let’s take a look at where we are so far in terms of precedents.\n\nFirst, the stats that count as we know them (focusing only on industry awards):\n\nGoing back to 2012, no film has won Best Picture or Best Director without at least a BAFTA nomination in Picture or Director.\n\nYou have to go back to 2004 to find a film that won without either, though they changed their voting in 2012 so really we can only look at recent history, which is too small of a sample to be reliable.\n\nGeorge Miller and Mad Max: Fury Road are missing both Picture and Director nominations at BAFTA.\n\nSince 2012, the Best Director winner at either the DGA or Oscar also had BAFTA/DGA/Oscar nominations — even in 2013, when Ang Lee held the distinction of being nominated for Best Director across the board, Ang Lee ended up winning the Oscar. This year, only Alejandro G. Iñárritu and Adam McKay have that honor.\n\nGoing all the way back to 1989, when Driving Miss Daisy won, no film has won Best Picture without getting an ACE Eddie nomination. Spotlight is missing the ACE Eddie nomination, and is also missing the BAFTA nomination for Best Director.\n\nGoing back to 2006, no film has won Best Picture without first winning the Producers Guild Award. Additionally, ever since the PGA switched to the preferential ballot, no film has won Best Picture without winning at the Producers Guild first. The Big Short has won this year’s Producer Guild Award.\n\nIn all of SAG/PGA/DGA/Oscar history, no film has ever lost the Producers Guild, won the SAG Awards Ensemble, then won DGA or the Oscar for Director. Both films that won with just a SAG Ensemble win — Shakespeare in Love and Crash — were surprise Best Pic winners with ACE Eddie nominations and a strong Best Director frontrunner/film to compete with. Steven Spielberg won everything for Saving Private Ryan, Ang Lee won everything for Brokeback Mountain. You could even add in Oliver Stone for Born on the Fourth of July, which kept winning Best Director while Driving Miss Daisy won Best Picture without a Best Director nomination. Spotlight is in a much better position to win Best Picture than it is Best Director.\n\nAll films that have won the PGA and the ACE Eddie only have gone on to Best Picture. The Big Short is the film that has ticked the first two boxes this year.\n\nThe DGA often determines the final tilt toward Best Picture or Best Director. It’s rare that a Best Director will win the DGA but then his film doesn’t win either Best Picture or Best Director at the Oscars. It happened in 2000 (Ang Lee again, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), in 1995 (Ron Howard, Apollo 13), and in 1985 (Steven Spielberg for the Color Purple).\n\nWhomever you pick for DGA, it should be someone you’re also predicting for Best Director Oscar or Best Picture Oscar.\n\nLet’s look at how many times since 2009 PGA and DGA matched:\n\n2009-The Hurt Locker PGA/DGA/ACE/WGA\n\n2010-The King’s Speech PGA/SAG/DGA\n\n2011-The Artist PGA/DGA/ACE\n\n2012-Argo PGA/SAG/DGA/ACE/WGA\n\n2013-Gravity PGA/DGA, 12 Years a Slave PGA\n\n2014-Birdman PGA/DGA/SAG\n\nOnly once since 2009 did the PGA and DGA not match, and that was with Gravity in 2013, where there was an historic tie between 12 Years a Slave and Gravity. Why was there a tie? There was clear support and motivation to push 12 Years a Slave to the top of the ballot, just as voters did at the Oscars.\n\nNow, you have to look seriously at The Big Short and ask yourself why you think Adam McKay can’t win the DGA. Here are some reasons you might be thinking:\n\n1) There are more virtuoso directors with popular movies next to him. True, but we’ve seen years where relative unknowns beat respected virtuoso directors, like Tom Hooper beating David Fincher, Michel Hazanvicious beating Martin Scorsese, and Ben Affleck beating both Ang Lee and Steven Spielberg.\n\n2) He’s not well-known enough (see Number 1)\n\n3) Many people apparently had trouble understanding The Big Short’s plot at first. Well, that may be. The film has made $60 million at the box office, which isn’t too shabby for a movie that some say is confusing. It also has an A- CinemaScore, which polls your average moviegoer as they leave the theater. Five minutes after the credits roll, if they had not understood or enjoyed The Big Short, we would expect to see it have a lower score. In contrast, both Mad Max: Fury Road and The Revenant have B+ Cinemascores, which is low for a Best Picture winner. The Martian has a solid A. Spotlight probably would have an A if it had been tested.\n\nLet’s table the Oscars for the moment and look just at the DGA. If you’re predicting a unification of Picture/Director at DGA and Oscar, your best options are:\n\nAdam McKay, The Big Short – It won the PGA. That ups its chances considerably. It also won the ACE Eddie (Comedy). Pairing PGA and ACE has resulted in a DGA win 12/14 times in PGA history [please note: for many years, the ACE announced well after PGA and DGA, thus the results are a tad suspect if we’re trying use them to predict the DGA], even if that film doesn’t eventually go on to win Best Picture (Saving Private Ryan). The ACE Eddie is such a big deal, in fact, that Braveheart and Crash all won the Eddie before winning Best Picture in an upset. While Shakespeare in Love didn’t win the Eddie, it did have a nomination there. This is probably your best bet for DGA right now.\n\nAlejandro G. Iñárritu, The Revenant – Since 2009, all of the films that won the DGA won the PGA as well. Before 2009, Martin Scorsese for The Departed (won ACE) and Clint Eastwood for Million Dollar Baby were the two most recent DGA winners whose films didn’t win the PGA. Iñárritu could make history by becoming not just the first Mexican-born director to win two DGA awards, but the first in all of their history to win two in back-to-back years.\n\nGeorge Miller for Mad Max: Fury Road – The thing that keeps him atop the list is that Mad Max won the ACE Eddie (Drama), but also so many pundits are predicting him. Anne Thompson was one of the few to call Ang Lee for Life of Pi early on. She has sort of done the same thing for Miller and Mad Max.\n\nTom McCarthy, Spotlight – This won the SAG Awards Ensemble, which means it finally won a (plurality) consensus vote with a large group. No film has ever lost the PGA, won the SAG, and then won the DGA. This year might be the first time ever.\n\nRidley Scott, The Martian – Although it’s probably the most popular film with mass appeal in the lineup and Scott is a popular director who has never won before, The Martian lost momentum when it didn’t get an Oscar nod for Best Director. ]\n\nStatswise, The Big Short is poised to take the whole race because it has won the Producers Guild Award and ACE Eddie. But Spotlight may have gained some fresh momentum from its SAG-AFTRA win. The ballots haven’t even gone out yet, which gives the Spotlight team plenty of time to rally voters. I could be wrong but I think both The Revenant and Mad Max: Fury Road will likely split the voters inclined to epics at the DGA, leaving the race between the two Irish brothers from another mother, McKay and McCarthy.\n\nWe here at AwardsDaily mostly stick to stats and history. We’re not big on making blind guesses based on hunches with nothing to back them up — but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t. The Gold Derby gang, right now, are almost uniformly predicting George Miller for Fury Road to take the DGA — and I think that’s a good prediction. My only snag is that it didn’t get either a Best Picture or Best Director nomination at BAFTA. It’s just extremely rare for that to happen — one or the other might have shown up. It only got tech nominations in the UK. Gravity, in contrast, had acting, writing, directing in addition to tech nominations at BAFTA. Iñárritu is in, we think, a slightly better position to be the lone director in a split, although he would also be making history as well, winning Best Director in back-to-back years.\n\nThe only people I know who are predicting the The Big Short to win the DGA would be Kris Tapley, our own Statsgasm’s Marshall Flores, and a few users over at Gold Derby. We’re predicting it because it has the best odds to win based on stats, reviews, popularity of director, popularity of film (box office) and most of all, that it won the PGA, which we feel significantly improves its chances. Winning the PGA nowadays is like winning Ohio if you’re running for President — it’s a reliable bellweather. The DGA is more like the Iowa caucuses — it’s good and all, and it’s better to win it than lose it, but it’s not as rigid a stat.\n\nOne more time:\n\nBut a hunch is a hunch is a hunch, and there is a first time for everything. Anything can happen on Saturday and turn the race in a different direction.\n\nDespite the lack of a BAFTA nods for Mad Max, the pundits are very strong on George Miller — and they turn out to be a right a lot of the time. Just saying.\n\nThe DGA Awards\n\nwon DGA | won Oscar\n\n*film nominated/+ won Best Picture at the Oscars\n\n2014\n\nAlejandro G. Inarritu, The Revenant Alejandro G.
