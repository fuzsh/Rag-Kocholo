        "text": "If any address has the glitziest ring to it in Los Angeles, it might be 2222 Avenue Of The Stars. That marks the location of Century Towers, an iconic I.M. Pei-designed high rise built in 1964, where indeed, notable stars have lived. Academy award-winning Robert Wise, the famous late director of The Sound of Music and West Side Story, was one of them. A true Hollywood legend, Wise also served as president of the Directors Guild of America from 1971-1975 and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (aka the Oscars) from 1985-1988. Now, this corner unit he called home is for sale asking $4.95 million.\n\nAccording to Mansion Global, the icon picked up his Century Towers apartment in 1980 and held onto it until his death in 2005. Falling into the hands of his granddaughter, Alex Conrad, it was she who extensively expanded the condo to make it what it is today. By combining three units on the 23rd and 24th floors, this 4,335-square-foot home in the sky was born.\n\nEvery inch of it is sleek and bright, looking out to stunning city and ocean views. While the hills you can see are of the Hollywood variety and far from the von Trapps, they still seem to sing and could quickly become one of a new ownerâ€™s â€˜Favorite Thingsâ€™ about the spread.\n\nBreaking down the luxurious floorplan, the 24th floor holds the primary bedroom suite, encompassing a spa-like bathroom and closet, an office, and a balcony. Then, on the 23rd floor, open living areas with coffered ceilings and a kitchen provide a relaxed ambiance for entertaining. Three more bedrooms and three bathrooms, as well as a laundry room, round out this level."
