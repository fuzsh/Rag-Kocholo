        "text": "It is a common phenomenon for people in using pragmatics in their daily communication. People tend to express themselves implicitly with intention which is discussed in illocutionary acts. The intention are such as commanding, informing, expressing themselves and so on. Illocutionary acts that was developed by Searle (1976) has five types, representative/(assertive), directive, commissive, expressive and declaration. One of the types that often be used is directive which is classified into few classes such as command, beg, advise and request. This research was aimed to analyzed the classes and the frequency of directive speech acts that are uttered by the characters in”Cinderella” movie. This research was analyzed by applying descriptive qualitative method which is explained in words, phrases and sentences. The data will be collected from the characters’ utterance in “Cinderella” movie. The researcher used observational method, non-participatory and note taking technique method in c...\n\nThe way people speak is influenced by their own style. It is easier for the addressee to understand the addresser’s idea if he or she is familiar with the addresser’s language style. In stylistic approach, style can be seen in figurative language through figures of speech. Thus, the aims of this research are to describe the types of figures of speech and to find out the functions of figures of speech in Les Miserables. This research employed descriptive qualitative approach. The data were in the form of utterances (words, phrases, clauses, and utterances) spoken by the characters in Les Miserables movie. The main instrument of the study was the researcher herself. The researcher employed some steps during the data collection: watching the movie, finding its script, making data sheet, and categorizing the data. In conducting the data analysis, the researcher passed some steps, identifying, classifying, and making interpretation. To gain the data trustworthiness, the researcher asked ...\n\nPeople rarely know the function of the language used in the film. This study analyzes speech acts in a dialogue film entitled Merry Riana: Dreams of a Million Dollars. This research is a qualitative descriptive study. Data were analyzed from the form of speech acts consisting of direct and indirect speech acts in the form of declarative, imperative, and interrogative. The type of speech act analysis uses Searle&#39;s theory of representative, directive, commissive, expressive, and declaration. The result of this research is that direct speech act in interrogative form is 43.63%. Direct speech acts in the declarative form are 95 (43.18%), direct speech acts in the imperative form are 24 (10.90%), indirect speech acts in the imperative form are 2 (0.9%), indirect speech acts in imperative form as much as 2 (0.9%). interrogative form is 2 (0.9%), and indirect speech act in declarative form is 1 (0.45%). Furthermore, 74 utterances are analyzed into five types of speech acts. The most do...\n\nThis study is aimed to explain the classifications and to explain the contribution of directive speech acts analysis in the \"The Message\" by Moustapha Akkad to EFL learner in understanding the expression of giving the command. This study used descriptive qualitative which the writer interprets of utterances that contain the types of directive speech acts in this movie and the contribution of this research in EFL Classroom. The result of the study showed that 213 utterances of the directive of speech acts were successfully identified. There are command (182 data or 85.44 %), order (2 data or 0.94 %), request (10 data or 4.70 %), and suggestion (19 data or 8.92 %). So it can be concluded that the dominant directive is a command because this movie contained many commands of the Prophet Muhammad and his friends in the battle of Badr and Uhud. This result of this research is suggested for students. Teacher as a facilitator can use this movie as learning media. By watching this movie, the student can observe the expression of giving a command. Expression of giving command was found in basic competence (3.4 and 4.4).\n\nThe utterance that contains performative verb explicitly has subject pronominal I, present simple tense, and direct object . The meaning of performative verb contains declarative, representative/assertive, expressive, directive, and commisive meaning. The method used in this research is a descriptive method. According to Djajasudarma (1993 : 8), a descriptive method aims to make description s ; make picture s , paint a systematic, factual and accurate picture of the information o r data, properties, and phenomena under study. The steps of this research we re: (1) literature review, (2) the collection of data, (3) data analysis, and (4) conclu sions . The data was taken from conversation on ‘Gladiator’ and ‘A Few Good Man’ Movies. The results show that the performative verbs in the movies are ‘warn’, ‘assume’, ‘admit’ which are categorized into representative /assertive meaning, ‘promise’, ‘bet’, ‘reject’, ‘swear’ whose meanings are commisive,’order’, ‘ask’, ‘advise’, ‘beg’, ‘comman...\n\nThe aims of this research are to find the types of expressive utterances produced by the characters in the movie entitled “Dead Poets Society” and to find the linguistic variability of the expressive utterances. This is a pragmatic research, which is a form of qualitative research. The source of the data of this research is the transcript of the movie. “Dead Poets Society” is an American drama movie that was released in 1989 and was directed by Peter Weir.The result of this research showed that there are 40 expressive utterances in the movie which cover : 20 utterances of thanking (50.00%), 9 utterances of apologizing (20.00%), 6 utterances of welcoming (15.00%) 4 utterances of congratulating (7.50%), 2 utterances of condoling (5.00%), and 1 utterance of deploring (2.50%). This research provides some empirical uses of expressive speech acts and their linguistic variability which can be used in English teaching and learning activity. Keywords : expressive utterance, pragmatics, conte...\n\nThe main aim of the study is to ascertain contrastively, in English and Spanish, how directive speech acts are represented in film discourse. For the purpose of the investigation, the directive speech acts of 24 films, 12 in English and 12 in Spanish, were extracted and analysed. A classification taxonomy, inspired by previous research, was created in order to categorize the different types of directive speech acts and determine their level of (in)directness. The results show that indirectness is more widely represented in the English than in the Spanish film scripts, thus confirming the assertion that being indirect is a distinctive feature of English native speakers (Grundy, 2008). This research makes a valuable contribution to the exploration of speech acts in filmspeak and informs the existing local grammar descriptions of the linguistic patterns of directive speech acts."
