        "text": "Jim Owen - February 1, 1949-May 8, 2020\n\nOften obituaries are written to reﬂect on the lives of one we love dearly. We can easily recall special memories, conversations, funny moments, vacations, endearments. But every single trip down memory lane of Jim, leads me to the road of his unbelievable love for his family. Please don't misunderstand me. Jim's life is full of things anyone would be proud of. Jim served\n\nin the Navy from January 1969- August 1971 in Fighter Squadron 102 at Oceana Naval Air Station. He was an Aviation Support Equipment Technician while there. He worked many years (1971-2014) at PSI/Duke Energy and loved his job and the people he worked with. Jim faithfully served in his church. He had a great passion for his Bible studies, he wanted to fulﬁll\n\nGod's purpose for his life. He loved his cats and his dog Jax. He loved bluegrass music. When Jim found something he felt was worth doing he put his whole heart into it. He loved reading, ﬁshing, he taught gun safety/shooting instructor for Sullivan County 4H, he was a NRA certiﬁed instructor, he liked computer programming, he studied the Bible daily and took Hebrew and Latin classes, he was in the band The Tweeds and played the guitar and harmonica. He was gifted in so many areas, but his life, almost from the day he set eyes on her, wasn't about him anymore. It was always her. If Sharon was in the room, his attention was on her. If she wasn't he was talking about her. No matter how many books he read or movies he watched, his and Sharon's would always be his favorite love story. Please listen young women, there really is a man that God made just to love you, one that will be stationed at Virginia Beach in the Navy and will drive to Indiana every chance he gets just to see you. There is a man who will borrow his grandma's car to take you on a ﬁrst date because you aren't allowed to ride on his motorcycle. He will still take you when your dad says he has to take your two little sisters as well. And he will still come back for a second date after your sisters drip ice cream all over the seats in his grandma's car. There is a man who will do yard work, put in a pool and go to the beach even though he hates it and smile the whole time because you're smiling. There is a man that will dote on you and look at you like you are still 21 even after 49 years of marriage. So don't settle for less. There is a man who will love God in such a way that he will be a living example of Christ like love. There is a man who will see you as the greatest blessing of his life. He will pray for you and with you. He will speak to your children and grandchildren as though they are the wisest, kindest, most beautiful, most capable people to ever walk the earth and you can watch it come to fruition because of his faith in them and his example. Jim ﬁlled his children and grandchildrens' lives with a limitless resource of love and conﬁdence in their abilities and worth. That's why he was never surprised by what they accomplished, but always beaming.\n\nWhile we would give anything for one more good day or conversation, he never left one I love you unsaid or a grandchild unhugged or unkissed. Jim did small things with great love always.\n\nA graveside service will be held Tuesday, May 12, 2020 at New Vermillion Cemetery: 4164 W Sanford Ave, West Terre Haute at 1pm, with Pastor Tom Savage officiating. Arrangements are under the direction of Fitzpatrick Funeral Home, 220 North 3rd St., West Terre Haute, IN.\n\nJim was preceded in death by: Viola May Bannon Wise (Mother), Robert Owen (Father), Melvin Wise (Stepfather), William “Bill” Wise (Brother), Melvin Wise (Brother), Ava G.
