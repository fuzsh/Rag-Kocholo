        "text": "Dede Allen Receives Guild's Fellowship and Service Award\n\nThe Motion Picture Editors Guild has selected veteran film editor Dede Allen, ACE, to be the recipient of the Guild’s prestigious Fellowship and Service Award.\n\nThe Guild created this award to acknowledge a member who exhibits not only exemplary skill in the craft of editing, but also a set of values, which include professionalism, collaboration, mentorship, generosity of spirit and commitment to the labor movement. The distinguished honor will be presented to Allen at the Editors Guild’s annual Board of Directors Installation Dinner on January 5, 2008 at the Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel in Santa Monica, California.\n\n“Throughout her career, Dede Allen has truly exemplified each of the values represented by the Fellowship and Service Award. She has continuously shared her knowledge and experience with her crews, nurturing a plethora of apprentice and assistant editors. I’m thrilled to announce that she is this year’s recipient,” said Editors Guild President Lisa Churgin, ACE. “She is a true pioneer among women editors in the modern era. While there were a number of prominent so-called ‘lady-editors’ in the 1930s and 1940s, Dede has expanded the previously held notion that a woman could be a leader and an innovator in the cutting room.”\n\nRead full article here...\n\nDEDE’S DEVOTEES: Some Words from Her Admirers\n\nEditing a Lifetime in ‘The Final Cut’: Dede Allen, Robert Brakey and Omar Naïm More About Dede Allen\n\nDede on Digital: An interview with Dede Allen by Mia Goldman Part 1\n\nDede on Digital: An interview with Dede Allen by Mia Goldman Part 2\n\nA Conversation with Dede Allen"
