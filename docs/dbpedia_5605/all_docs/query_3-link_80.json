        "text": "“In a sense, he was the Steven Spielberg of his time.” – Martin Scorsese, on Robert Wise\n\nDirector and editor Robert Wise behind West Side Story and The Sound of Music died Wednesday. He was 91. The following includes excerpts from the LA Times.\n\n“He was always treated with great deference and it was not for what he accomplished in films, but for who he was as a human being,” Lawrence Mirisch said a family family and a motion picture agent.\n\nMichael Apted, president of the Directors Guild of America, said in a statement that Wise’s ” … devotion to the craft of filmmaking and his wealth of head-and-heart knowledge about what we do and how we do it was a special gift to his fellow directors.”\n\nEarning a reputation as a disciplined and impeccable craftsman, he worked in virtually every genre — from high drama and romantic comedy to film noir and the supernatural.”\n\nAmong Robert Wise’s best-known 40 films:\n\n“Somebody Up There Likes Me” (1956)\n\n“The Day the Earth Stood Still” (1951),\n\n“I Want to Live!” (1958)\n\nThe Haunting” (1963)\n\n“The Sand Pebbles” (1966)\n\nIn 1998, the modest and self-effacing filmmaker became the 26th recipient of the AFI’s life achievement award, joining the ranks of fellow directors John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock and Welles in receiving what is widely considered the film industry’s highest career honor."
