Safeguarding nature and reducing pollution will improve people’s health and long-term security of food production. Accelerating progress towards circular economy will save resources and help secure critical raw materials. There are still many very good reasons to continuing and accelerating the green transition in Europe as it supports our security, competitiveness and people’s well-being."
