He married Wilma Jean Haas on November 29, 1953 at Maywood Community Church.  Bob owned White Church Barbershop at 8420 Parallel for many years before it was taken to widen Parallel.  Bob could tell more stories about the barbershop than one can imagine.  There was always entertainment and cavorting going on.  Some stories were almost too crazy to believe, but they really did happen.  His customers jokingly referred to him as the Mayor of White Church. Many came in for the social happening, not always to get a haircut. When the road took the barbershop, he was forced to find other employment and went to work at Great Lakes Container Corporation eventually becoming a salesman in Kansas City.   He was promoted to General Manager and transferred to Tulsa, Oklahoma in the early 1980’s.  Bob served on the school board of Piper USD #203, the Wyandotte County Farm Bureau Board, Maywood Church Board, and was Treasurer of Piper City.  He was a 50 year member of the Delaware Masonic Lodge, and a member of the Maywood Community Church.  Bob was preceded in death by his Parents Charles and Eva Wise, Brothers, Charles Wise and Gary Wise.  He is survived by his wife, Wilma Jean Wise of the home, son, Mark Wise and wife Penny, of Basehor, Kansas, and daughter, Sheri Eberth and husband Dennis of Basehor, Kansas.  He is also survived by a sister, Doris Mogle of Basehor, Kansas.
