        "text": "The Fablehaven books get better as you read through them, and I learned that by reading book two. It starts at Kendra’s school when a new kid named Case arrives. He was extremely repulsive but no one seemed to notice but Kendra. After everyone at school seems to act like he’s royalty, Kendra realizes something is wrong. She meets a man named Errol Fisk one day, who claims to be a friend of Coulter Dixon, a friend of their grandparents, and discovers what Case is (which if you want know then read the book). Seth and Kendra then have to steal an artifact from a blix (and if you want to know what that is then I suggest you read the book). Afterwards, they get summoned to their grandparents’ house to see Grandpa Sorenson, who broke his leg, and for other reasons…\n\nKendra is still as smart as ever and also pretty brave, and Seth is still as stupid- I mean brave as ever. There are some new characters introduced in the book. Tanu is a potions master and is a friend of Grandma and Grandpa Sorenson. He travels the world to find ingredients for his potions. Coulter, yes, Coulter Dixon, is a magical item collector. He has a glove that can turn him invisible if he stands still, as well as other magical artifacts. Vanessa knows magical creatures and keeps many of them. At one point in the story, a group of them gets loose: the drummants.\n\nBrandon Mull really did let his imagination run wild with this book, thinking up new magical creatures like drummants. Fantasy books don’t have enough original creatures, mainly fairies, pegasai, dragons, that sort of thing, but nothing that is created by the author, so I’m glad that we can discover new creatures rather than hear about old ones.\n\nI know that in the Book 1 review I complemented Brandon Mull’s writing skills but I can’t talk about it enough. He really tells you everything you need to know. He describes emotions wonderfully, and you can really feel what the characters are feeling and understand them. He makes it so that you can understand the challenge of what they’re doing. I enjoy reading his books because of this and the way he writes is just so wonderful and pleasing to read. The story doesn’t get going too fast or too slow and he gradually explains the critical events of the last book.\n\nAnyway, I think that this was a good sequel to the first one and is possibly even better. I hope that Fablehaven Book 3 is just as good and with such a wonderful plot-line and author I don’t think it will let me down."
