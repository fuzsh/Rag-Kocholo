        "text": "Hello All! So, I have decided to start a new feature on my blog titled “Signature Saturday”, where, each Saturday, I will showcase one book from my collection of autographed books. But first I need YOUR help picking an official banner for it.\n\nToday’s Signed book: The Beyonders: A World Without Heroes – By Brandon Mull.\n\nMy VERY first signed book, Beyonders holds a special spot on my Signed Book Shelf, and I’ll never forget the day I got to meet author Brandon Mull. He was so incredibly nice! Before the Q&A (at a local library), he just sat on the edge of the stage, chatting with all his fans about whatever, then, in the signing line for the release of his newest book BEYONDERS: A WORLD WITHOUT HEROES (the first book in the Beyonders series) he took time to talk to each person, take pictures with them, etc.\n\nThough he is most well-known for his Fablehaven books, the Beyonders series, were the books he always meant to write. They were the reason he knew he had to become an author, so that he could tell that story. Beyonders is more mature than Fablehaven, not in a bad way or anything. Fablehaven is written for a middle-grade age group, and Beyonders is written for a YA age group. If you haven’t read the Beyonders trilogy yet, I HIGHLY recommend you do. They’re so amazing! You’ll love them. :)\n\nTitle: Chasing the Prophecy (Beyonders, #3)\n\nAuthor: Brandon Mull\n\nSummary: Jason and Rachel were not born in Lyrian. They did not grow up in Lyrian. But after all of the battles and losses, the triumphs and adventures, and most of all, the friendships forged in this fantastical world, Lyrian has become home to them in a way they never could have imagined.\n\nAnd so, armed now with the prophecy of a dying oracle, they have gone on their separate quests—each surrounded by brave and powerful allies—knowing that the chance for success is slim. But Jason and Rachel are ready at last to become the heroes Lyrian needs, no matter the cost.\n\nGenre/Pages: Fantasy/512\n\nRating: ★★★★★★(6 of 5)\n\nMy Review: Okay, so I know I say this a lot, but this is different. This book is amazing. Probably one of the best fantasy books I’ve ever read. This book exceeded my wildest expectations. It pulled me in. Had me entranced, involved, emotional, tense, and left me having learned something. And this may sounds cheezy, but Beyonders is a book with good morals, not just good fun.\n\nIt’s been a little over a year since I last read the 2nd book in this series, so I had a bit of a rough start getting into this one, but after I was in far enough in to be able to remember everything that’d happened earlier, I loved it. Sent on different quests, many of the favorite characters were split up, and the 3 parts of the rebellion were being told from different POV’s. Sometimes this can lead to confusion, and frustration, but Mull did an incredible job with it. Timing everything perfectly for maximum suspense.\n\nThis book really pulled you in. There was no boredom, just fast-paced adventure. The characters were great; there was so much character development, and absolutely zero last-book-let-down. The plot was fantastic, and kept me guessing. I’m going to miss this series. I’m gonna miss these characters. This is Gregor and the Code of the Claw all OVER again! Chasing the Prophecy had me in tears, more than once. Dang, this book is beyond incredible, beyond fantastic, it’s electrifying. I’m going to miss Lyrian.\n\nContent Advisory: Quite a few deaths. A lot actually. Some very unpleasant deaths, and some violence. Nothing really blood-guts-and-gore type. Nothing you’d find in an adult book, but still, some pretty unpleasant stuff.\n\nTo Sum it up: In Rick Riordan’s words: “An irresistible mix of adventure, humor, and magic.” I 100% agree, but it goes above and beyond that, this is one of those books that you’ll remember forever, and Brandon Mull creates a world you’ll love to go back and visit. Beyonders: Chasing the Prophecy is a book you won’t regret reading, and, I recommend it for ages 11+.\n\nHave you heard of this book before? Have you read it? Did you like it?\n\nTitle: The Candy Shop War: Arcade Catastrophe\n\nAuthor: Brandon Mull\n\nGenre/Pages: Fantasy/416\n\nRating: ★★★★☆ (3.5 of 5)\n\nSummary: The long-awaited sequel to The Candy Shop War! In The Candy Shop War, friends Nate, Summer, Trevor, and Pigeon met the evil magician Belinda White, whose magical confections enabled the kids to do incredible feats of strength and magic. In the sequel, Nate and his friends meet Mrs. White s brother Mr. White who owns Arcadeland, a local amusement center. At Arcadeland, kids can play games and earn thousands of tickets, which are redeemable for one of four kinds of stamps jets, tanks, subs, and racecars. Could it be true that these stamps allow kids to fly through the air? Or breathe underwater? Or run faster than a car? But Mr. White is hiding a secret: when all four clubs are filled, he will be able to retrieve perhaps the most powerful talisman ever. For Nate and his friends, it will take more than candy to fight and win this war!\n\nMy Review: Honestly? I went into this book expecting it to be a lame attempted follow-up on, what I considered a great book. I should’ve known better. I mean, seriously, this is Brandon Mull we’re talking about! Long story short? I liked this one MUCH better than The Candy Shop War.\n\nFirst off: The powers in this book are much cooler. What more can you ask? :P Anyway, I. Love. Brandon Mull’s writing style. It really pulls you in, and makes you want to keep on reading. He makes it funny, yes, but his characters are also, in some ways, down to earth. (Well, aside from when they’ve been sucking on a Moon Rock, but…you know, I’ll just stop right now ;) )\n\nYeah, I realize that these kids are running at super speeds, and have super strength and stuff, but he still makes the characters believable. Sure they have super speed, but they still get tired. Yeah, they might be able to fly, but they still have to be careful with their turns, etc. He makes it fun, and, in some ways, believable. That’s what I love about Brandon Mull and his characters. No matter how crazy the world he created is, it’s believable. Get what I mean? Anyway…\n\nTo Sum it up: This is a great fun-for-all-ages book to read with children, or just to read on your own! A great, fun, relaxing book, and I loved it! Recommended ages: 5+"
