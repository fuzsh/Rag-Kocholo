        "text": "A few years ago, one of my granddaughters got her hands on a copy of Brandn Mull’s “The Candy Shop Wars” and was smitten.\n\nCan you blame me? Just look at this book trailer:\n\nAt her request, I read it, and soon, I too was hooked. In the book, Mull weaved a tale of children who eat candy that gives them temporary super powers. Think Willy Wonka’s chocolate bars meets up with Stan Lee’s superheros. The book was fantastic, and even as an adult, I was entertained by its premise. Shortly after that, Mull did a book signing at a local book chain, so we were able to meet him. She was so star-struck, she could hardly speak once she was in front of her newfound favorite author.\n\nThe big green witch on the front, illustrated by Brandon Dorman, might have been enough to keep me from cracking open Brandon Mull’s “Fablehaven” when I was young. However, it seems that children are not as spooked as they used to be. Today they are fearless and will seek out the spookiest-looking books to read. The scarier, the better!\n\nNot that these books are too scary, mind you. They do have places that will cause some goosebumps, but most kids should enjoy the adventures inside without being overly-terrified.\n\nAs I was reading this book, I thought back to the adventures I had when I would visit my grandparents in the summer.\n\nI don’t think I ever had to drink anything special to see fairies instead of butterflies, or wandering out into the forest in search of the ugly green witch, but I do remember making forts with blankets and picnic table parts and having my own adventures. Now, that I think about it, I did love daydreaming about catching my own fairies….but that’s another blog post.\n\nThe story of “Fablehaven” is about discovering who you never realized you were under it all. Take away the city life and throw in a crisis. Who are you? What strength do you possess? Kendra and Seth have to find themselves and work together to solve their problem before their parents come back for them from vacation, so their time is limited…and Grandpa is missing.\n\nThe wonderfully fantastical characters that are spun in this book lead the imagination of today’s children, who tend to be content to sit dormant and watch the television. I haven’t witnessed them jumping up and acting out the book as I have seen them do with others, but I have had them begging for the next one in the series!\n\nWhat a spectacular trip beyond the mind’s boundaries! Any of the Fablehaven books are sure to bring an afternoon of reading enjoyment for any kid. My personal favorite Fablehaven book is still “The Candy Shop War” but I haven’t finished the rest of “Fablehaven: Rise of the Evening Star” yet.\n\nWhat is your favorite?"
