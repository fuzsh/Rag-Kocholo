Mull has also written The Candy Shop War. Because many young readers are interested in his books, Brandon crosses the country talking to students, with the message that \"imagination can take you places.\" In an interview, Brandon Mull said\n\n\"I've been trying to pull off a writing career, dreaming of it since high school and trying sincerely since college, which has bee quite a few years already, so.\"\n\nThe greatest inspiration for his stories are J. R. R. Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, and J. K. Rowling.\n\nAs an author\n\nBrandon Mull is also spearheading a seven-book series called \"Spirit Animals.\" Each book will be written by a different author, but he was given the charge to create the fantasy world where the characters will live, and all the books will be based. The first installment, written by Brandon, is called \"Wild Born\" and was released in September of 2013.\n\nAnother series Brandon Mull has authored is called \"Five Kingdoms.\" The first book is subtitled Sky Raiders and was released March 11, 2014. The second installment will arrive the following October od 2014. Of this series, Brandon Mull says, \"It'll be for the kind of readers who liked Fablehaven. A Halloween spook alley turns out to be a front for slave traders taking kids into another world. It'll be cool, promise.\"\n\nOn Mull's Facebook page he mentioned that he is planning a second Fablehaven series, but wouldn't get serious about it until some of his other projects are finished, like Spirit Animals, possibly not until 2015. Brandon annouced at the lauching of \"Spirit Animals\" that there is a very good plan for the Fablehaven sequel series to be published in 2016.\n\nFablehaven is currently optioned by Schaffer Studios. The movie is in the beginning/planning phase as described in a radio interview Brandon Mull Clark Schaffer in June 2013."
