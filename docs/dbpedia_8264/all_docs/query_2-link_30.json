        "text": "Brandon Mull is an American writer who is best known as the author of the Fablehaven fantasy series, which is a New York Times bestseller. Mull is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, sometimes casually called the Mormon Church or LDS Church.\n\nMull, a Brigham Young University graduate who served an full-time mission in Chile, says growing up in Connecticut surrounded by forest provided inspiration for the fantasy series. Mull attended Rochambeau Middle School as a student, and also where the Fablehaven series takes place.\n\n“For as long as I can remember, I’ve spent a lot of my free time daydreaming and making up stories,” he said. “Sometimes I would daydream about strange creatures in the woods. The idea of secret wildlife refuges for magical creatures came to mind, and a story gradually took shape” [1]\n\nThe Fablehaven series has sold more than one million books since its 2006 release, and each volume has appeared on the New York Times bestselling children’s book list. Mull says that by the end of 2010, the series will be available in 20 languages. The remarkable success of Fablehaven has captured the attention of Hollywood, with Avi Arad, producer of Spiderman and Iron Man, purchasing the rights to make a Fablehaven movie.\n\nMovie rights have also been purchased for another of Mull’s books, The Candy Shop War. The book was originally meant to stand alone, but because so many fans had been asking for more, Mull released a sequel, Arcade Catastrophe, in 2012.\n\nWith the release of Dragonwatch: Wrath of the Dragon King in 2018, Mull had sixteen titles on the New York Times bestseller list.\n\nBooks by Brandon Mull\n\nFablehaven, published by Shadow Mountain, 2006\n\nFablehaven: Rise of the Evening Star, Shadow Mountain, 2007\n\nFablehaven: Grip of the Shadow Plague, Shadow Mountain, 2008\n\nFablehaven: Secrets of the Dragon Sanctuary, Shadow Mountain, 2009\n\nFablehaven: Keys to the Demon Prison, 2010 (final book of the series)\n\nThe Caretaker's Guide to Fablehaven, 2015\n\nDragonwatch: A Fablehaven Adventure, Shadow Mountain, 2017\n\nDragonwatch: Wrath of the Dragon King, Shadow Mountain, 2018\n\nDragonwatch: Master of the Phantom Isle, Shadow Mountain, 2019\n\nDragonwatch: Champion of the Titan Games, Shadow Mountain, 2020\n\nDragonwatch: Return of the Dragon Slayer, Shadow Mountain, 2021\n\nDragonwatch: Legend of the Dragon Slayer, Shadow Mountain, 2021\n\nThe Candy Shop War, Shadow Mountain, 2007\n\nThe Candy Shop War: Arcade Catastrophe, Shadow Mountain, 2012\n\nPingo, Shadow Mountain, 2009\n\nPingo and the Playground Bully – Prequel to Pingo, Shadow Mountain, 2012\n\nThe Beyonders: A World Without Heroes, Aladdin, 2011\n\nThe Beyonders: Seeds of Rebellion, Aladdin, 2012\n\nThe Beyonders: Chasing the Prophecy, Aladdin, 2013\n\nFive Kingdoms: Sky Raiders, Aladdin, March 2014\n\nFive Kingdoms: Rogue Knight, Aladdin, November 2014\n\nFive Kingdoms: Crystal Keepers, Aladdin, March 2015\n\nFive Kingdoms: Death Weavers, Aladdin, March 2016\n\nFive Kingdoms: Time Jumpers, Aladdin, March 2018\n\nSpirit Animals: Wild Born, Scholastic Multiplatform, 2013\n\nSpirit Animals: Tales of the Great Beasts (special edition, with other authors), 2014\n\nSpirit Animals: Tales of the Fallen Beasts (special edition, with other authors), 2016\n\nSmarter than a Monster: A Survival Guide, 2019"
