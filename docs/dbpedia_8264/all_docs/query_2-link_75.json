        "text": "Author: Brandon Mull\n\nPublication: June 7th 2006 by Shadow Mountain\n\nPages: 351\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nGoodReads\n\nFor centuries mystical creatures of all description were gathered into a hidden refuge called Fablehaven to prevent their extinction. The sanctuary survives today as one of the last strongholds of true magic. Enchanting? Absolutely. Exciting? You bet. Safe? Well, actually, quite the opposite.\n\nKendra and her brother, Seth, have no idea that their grandfather is the current caretaker of Fablehaven. Inside the gated woods, ancient laws keep relative order among greedy trolls, mischievous satyrs, plotting witches, spiteful imps, and jealous fairies. However, when the rules get broken — Seth is a bit too curious and reckless for his own good — powerful forces of evil are unleashed, and Kendra and her brother face the greatest challenge of their lives. To save their family, Fablehaven, and perhaps even the world, Kendra and Seth must find the courage to do what they fear most.\n\nI rarely talk about Middle Grade novels in my Blog but with the current The Adventures through Wonderland Readathon hosted by A Touch of Whimsy and Middle Grade Monthly, I thought it would be perfect opportunity to join the fun and dive back into some memorable Middle Grade books. One novel in particular which i enjoyed when I was younger would be Fablehaven. I am not sure what intrigued me, the overall mysterious and eerie aura of the book or the hidden fantasy realm, but I was instantly hooked the second I picked it up and couldn’t stop reading. Now when I picked it up to read after all these years, I realize why my younger self enjoyed these types whimsical books – Who wouldn’t want to stumble across a hidden, magical world?\n\nThe build up to the world of Fablehaven was very well done. I felt the author carefully laid out clues for the reader to decipher along with Kendra and Seth and together we go on this eerie journey to unlock the secrets of their Grandfather’s preserve. Both our main leads had very diverse personalties; Kendra, who is curious but rational and Seth who outspoken and can be a bit reckless. With these two personalities, they are able to balance each other out but it also makes way for some crazy and witty banters.\n\nI also appreciated that the magical creatures within this world were given their own personalities and history. It really helped to make the world more believable. In addition, the author’s writing also served as another world building technique since he was able to masterfully paint the scenes in which we can visualize them very well. It was also interesting to see the twists and turns as well as how the past storylines weaves into the current times.\n\nOverall, I thought this was a great storyline for the first book in a middle grade series. Since this is a reread, I found that I had forgotten a lot of the details from when I originally read it but it was interesting to dive back into the world and recover them again.\n\nHave any of you read Fablehaven? What were your thoughts on it?\n\nUntil next time, keep reading and I will see you all soon with another bookish post!"
