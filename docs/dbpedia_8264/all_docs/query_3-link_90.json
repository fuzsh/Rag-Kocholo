        "text": "Last spring, my favorite bookseller, Tami, at Fundamentals Bookstore in Delaware, Ohio, called to ask if I wanted to go to dinner with children’s book author Brandon Mull. Not having read his Fablehaven, Candy Shop Wars or Beyonders series books, I didn’t know what to expect, but I definitely had an amazing time!\n\nBrandon is an amazing author; I can’t put down the Beyonders series and am psyched to hear that he has recently created the upcoming Spirit Animals series that has another Vocab Gal favorite author Maggie Stiefvater penning the first book! He even has epic authors Orson Scott Card and Rick Riordan singing his praises regarding his action-packed and character-rich novels.\n\nAdditionally, Brandon was in a comedy troop in college, so he is hilarious in person, and I think he channels his humor through his main character Jason in the Beyonders series. Plus, he is just a really nice, humble guy who was happy to give me his thoughts regarding words. I love what he says and encourage you to check out his novels!"
