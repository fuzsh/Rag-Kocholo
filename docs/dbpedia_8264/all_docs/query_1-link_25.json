        "text": "Fablehaven: Rise of the Evening Star\n\nThis book “Fablehaven: Rise of the Evening Star” is written by Brandon Mull. Brandon Mull is an American author best known for his children’s fantasy series, Fablehaven, as well as Dragonwatch, The Candy Shop War, the Beyonders trilogy, and the Five Kingdoms series. He also began the Spirit Animals series. He was inspired by J. R. R. Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, and J. K. Rowling. Brandon Mull went to Mt. Diablo Elementary School in Clayton, California, United States. Mull then attended Pine Hollow Middle School as a student, and then attended Clayton Valley. He currently lives in Alpine, Utah and is a graduate of Brigham Young University in Utah. While at BYU Mull led the sketch comedy group Divine Comedy. Mull served a two-year mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Chile. As a child, Mull was known for a strong imagination. He would sometimes spend hours in his bedroom, without toys just imagining and acting out stories that were in his head. In school, his constant day dreaming sometimes irritated teachers while others encouraged his imagination."
