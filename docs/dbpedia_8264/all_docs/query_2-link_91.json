        "text": "Four Stars out of Five\n\nI became an ardent fan of Brandon Mull’s Fablehaven years ago and couldn’t help but feel sad when the final novel in that series, Keys to the Demon Prison, was published in 2010. It was a fantastic ending but, as is the case when it comes to books that grow close to my heart and imagination, I secretly hoped there would be more adventures either focused on the same characters or set in the same story world. In 2017, I got my wish when Dragonwatch was published as the first book in a spin-off series. But is Dragonwatch worth diving into, or is it a carbon copy of its sister series?\n\nThere are five novels that make up the Dragonwatch series, which was penned by Brandon Mull: Dragonwatch, Wrath of the Dragon King, Master of the Phantom Isles, Champion of the Titan Games, and Return of the Dragon Slayers. Plot-wise, the series as a whole focuses on Kendra and Seth Sorenson, the chief heroes from the Fablehaven series. This time around, while the threat of a demonic apocalypse has been averted, a new danger has emerged. Being the inherent adversaries of demons, the dragons now feel it is time to regain their freedom from their sanctuaries and become powerful masters of a new age for mankind and fairykind. In order to prevent an impending disaster and certain doom, Seth and Kendra are called upon once again to utilize their unique magical gifts in order to keep the dragons at bay. However, a dark enemy threatens to breach the heroes’ ranks and ensnare one of their own. Will Kendra and Seth be strong enough to weather the coming storm, or will they, their friends, family, and all of fairykind, fall forever?\n\nThe world of Fablehaven and its level of detail are staggering, as I noted in my review of that series. It functions very much like a sandbox environment where readers get to explore every nook and cranny of the fairy and fantasy realm right along with the main characters. Which is why it was ripe for a spin-off as there is so much to explore regarding its unique locations and in-depth lore. Here, readers spend quite a bit of time away from Fablehaven, which I think was a smart move. In this way, Dragonwatch avoids becoming a redundant carbon copy of its predecessor. Instead, each of its entries is constantly on the move, showcasing new locales not explored in Fablehaven as well as new characters, both friends and foes, alongside old favorites. Some of these new additions include Knox and Tess, Seth and Kendra’s cousins; Calvin, a nipsie who indentures himself to Seth; and Ronodin, Bracken’s dubious cousin. As expected, Dragonwatch assumes readers are familiar with and have read the Fablehaven series in full; so this isn’t a series for newcomers. However, to that end, I would simply encourage curious readers to dive into Fablehaven first before checking out Dragonwatch.\n\nAs was true with Fablehaven, the individual novels of Dragonwatch retain a brisk pace with a balanced narrative that features quiet moments of character development/reflection alongside chapters of adventurous action mixed with good humor. While this series is aimed at middle grade readers (and possibly young teens, due to the protagonists’ ages), adults can enjoy it, too, for its continuation of the first series’ clever world-building, fun characters, and philosophical insights regarding the nature of morality as well as good and evil. In terms of the latter, Dragonwatch retains its sister series’ underlying worldview that while there are moral absolutes concerning what is right and wrong, sometimes the choices people make are not always black and white nor are they easy.\n\nConcerning the series entries themselves, Dragonwatch serves as a good opener. In this novel, it doesn’t take long for Seth and Kendra to find themselves facing a new life-endangering task as well as a potentially world-changing mission – to serve as the caretakers of Wyrmroost, which has been in an uproar. Around the world, dragon sanctuaries are been stirred into a frenzy, and it’s only a matter of time before the conflict breaches the human world. This initial entry sets the series’ overall tone and pace nicely, as well as establishes the main players, both the heroes and the villains. While some of the newer characters don’t possess the same spark as the original cast, I enjoyed the inclusion of Calvin, a tiny hero, and the Somber Knight, a fearsome warrior who fights for the side of good. The new villains become Celebrant, the dragon king, and a dark unicorn named Ronodin. I will admit there isn’t much of a plot in this novel as it’s primary purpose is to set up the macro-plot’s focus and central players. Much like Fablehaven‘s own titular first novel, Dragonwatch takes some time getting to the heart of the action; however, it’s by no means a weak entry. Instead, I’d consider it a solid appetizer to the rest of the series.\n\nThe follow-up novel, Wrath of the Dragon King, picks up where Dragonwatch leaves off, though the latter doesn’t end on an annoying cliffhanger. While there is a high degree of tension in this novel, especially as relations between the humans and the dragons erode further, this novel is essentially a “Point-A-to-Point-B” story. Characters – and there are several – are constantly on the move with good reason; however, much of the action consists of “on-the-road” moments with characters traveling to destinations, laying low, then venturing onward again. That being said, the last few chapters pick up in terms of action and end on a devastating note. I will refrain from revealing spoilers, so all I will say is that one of the leads has something life-altering happen and is, unbeknownst to them, taken under the wing of one of this series’ baddies. Overall, while Wrath of the Dragon King feels repetitive in places, it is bolstered by an energetic momentum, the expansion of realms within Wyrmroost itself, and the promise of even higher stakes to come.\n\nThe third novel, Master of the Phantom Isles, eventually moves the action away from Wyrmroost and ventures to a yet unexplored magical preserve where Seth and Kendra are separated. Seth in particular is given an emotional arc that elevated this entry’s story for me as opposed to the first two books that seemed more focused on an adventure/quest narrative. There is a strong adventure vibe here, but the chapters involving Seth’s journey balance these out as they function more as moments of internal conflict rather than external action. As readers discovered in Fablehaven, Seth is a Shadow Charmer and is gifted with abilities more associated with darkness than light, very much unlike his fairykind sister, Kendra. Thus, Seth struggles with how to view his gifts in light of what he knows about good and evil, and there are characters who take full advantage of his doubts. Overall, I enjoyed this novel more so than the first two books in the series, and I do have to say that this entry contains probably two of my favorite moments concerning Seth and Kendra individually.\n\nChampion of the Titan Games serves as the penultimate entry that is a sizeable read and initiates a plethora of plot threads. While this makes for exciting reading and a swift pace, it can be slightly a bit much to keep track of in the long haul. Thus, the book shows its size about halfway through in this regard, though its climax more than makes up for it. Once more, this novel introduces yet another unexplored realm, Titan Valley, which is inhabited chiefly by giants. Also, some of the best twists in this particular series come in the book’s final act and serves as a solid appetizer for the final novel. While the reliance on more exposition here does cause the plot itself to slow down in places, the information is necessary in terms of a set up for the finale.\n\nLastly, Return of the Dragon Slayers closes out the series and is easiest the largest book not only among the other Dragonwatch entries but also out of both Dragonwatch and Fablehaven, clocking in at a little over 600 pages. There are numerous plot threads and characters that have to be wrapped up, but surprisingly (though maybe not surprisingly, as I have great faith in Brandon Mull as an author), no loose threads are left dangling by the end of the story. To be honest, this is probably the most ambitious novel in both series as far as the amount of plot that requires resolution and characters who require their individual and collective threads to be concluded. However, without divulging spoilers, I can say that this novel contains a satisfying ending that put a smile on my face and that provides 99.9% closure for all the main characters.\n\nNaturally, one might wonder if Dragonwatch was a necessary addition to the Fablehaven universe, and to that I’d say both yes and no. (I know that’s not really an answer, but let me explain.) In truth, Fablehaven stood well on its own and ended in a conclusive way that felt finalized. That being said, given such a large story world, it was all but asking for some sequels. Thus, I think Dragonwatch justifies its existence by not being a carbon copy of its sister series but, instead, introduces readers to new realms, new friends, new foes, and new depths of in-world magic.\n\nAccordingly to Mull himself in the author’s note in Return of the Dragon Slayers, he admitted that, “I didn’t want to write Dragonwatch unless it would build upon what Fablehaven started in a way that felt important….I feel like Dragonwatch is the second half of a sweeping story and that without these five books, the adventures of Kendra and Seth would be incomplete….I have found an end to the story of Kendra and Seth that feels right to me.” While Mull hints at possible future stories, for now Dragonwatch seems to serve as the conclusion to Kendra and Seth Sorenson’s individual and collective arcs. Thus, Dragonwatch serves as a continuation of the same story and isn’t an intentional cash-in, which I respect. And, when one thinks about it, both Fablehaven and Dragonwatch reflect a ten-year effort, which is impressive in and of itself, especially regarding Mull’s dedication to his story’s world and characters.\n\nSo to that, I give him a hardy thumbs up:\n\nOverall, the Dragonwatch series is worth diving into if you’re a Fablehaven fan hankering for more of that series’ characters, creatures, world, and lore. While I confess that some of the middle novels possess some repetitive plot features and the larger books can show their size at times in their quieter moments, I can’t fault the series too much for that as everything serves a purpose and falls into place by the series’ end. While Fablehaven remains my favorite between the two series, Dragonwatch is no slouch and deserves to be checked out for more quests and adventures. Both series are good, uplifting, and edifying reads that deserve to be devoured by readers of all ages searching for imaginative, immersive fantasy.\n\nContent:\n\nLanguage – None, other than some sporadic name-calling.\n\nViolence – Most of the violence involves magic or magical objects as opposed to weapons (aside from swords or knives) and mimics the sort of adventure peril contained in the Fablehaven books. Characters find themselves in dire situations and, in some cases, characters are killed in non-graphic ways or else escape and/or are injured. Dragons are a central threat as they plan to inflict destruction upon the human world. There is also talk of demons and how they also wished to overthrow the human world. It’s later revealed that demons and dragons are enemies, so one side wishes to fight the other. While there is plenty of magical action and some fight/battle scenes, nothing turns gory or graphic. Elsewhere, Seth has a penchant for being recklessly immature, though his actions usually come out of a spirit of taking risky measures in desperate or dangerous situations. However, his character has aged, so some said risks are less foolhardy this time around. Some beings and creatures characters face might be frightening or creepy to a younger audience, but nothing becomes horrific. Lastly, while the series upholds a sense of moral absolutes, the concept of light and dark being required to balance each other out crops up at times. However, to their credit, none of the novels praise darkness or questionable ethics as the good, right, and true ultimately prevail.\n\nSexual Content – None. Kendra and Bracken share an attraction to each other, but it’s innocent, and they do eventually share a chaste kiss."
