        "text": "Fablehaven is the first book in the Fablehaven series. It was Brandon Mull's first published work, released on July 30, 2006.\n\nPublisher's summary[]\n\nFor centuries mystical creatures of all description were gathered into a hidden refuge called Fablehaven to prevent their extinction. The sanctuary survives today as one of the last strongholds of true magic. Enchanting? Absolutely! Exciting? You bet! Safe? Well, actually, quite the opposite... Kendra and her brother, Seth, have no idea that their grandfather is the current caretaker of Fablehaven. Inside the gated woods, ancient laws keep relative order among greedy trolls, mischievous satyrs, plotting witches, spiteful imps, and jealous fairies. However, when the rules get broken—Seth is a bit too curious and reckless for his own good—powerful forces of evil are unleashed that cause Kendra and Seth to find the courage to do what they fear most.\n\nPlot[]\n\nSent off by their parents to Grandma and Grandpa Sorenson's house for seventeen days while their parents go on a cruise, Kendra and Seth share feelings of disappointment on the car ride there. When they get to the house, they say their goodbyes to their parents before Grandpa Sorenson tells them that their grandmother is visiting their dying Great Aunt Edna and introduces them to Lena, the half-Asian housekeeper, and Dale, a man who helps Grandpa Sorenson tend to the grounds. Once Seth and Kendra's parents are gone, Grandpa Sorenson establishes two rules: they must keep out of the woods, and they cannot go in the barn.\n\nThey visit their attic bedroom, and much to Kendra and Seth's delight, it is filled with a surplus of toys and activities to keep them busy, as well as a pet chicken named Goldilocks. Before he leaves, Grandpa Sorenson gives Kendra three keys, leaving the pair to figure out what they unlock if they wish. The next day, Seth and Kendra go swimming, the latter bringing a mirror to shine light in Seth's eyes. When she leaves it out, hoards of butterflies, bumblebees, and hummingbirds flock over to it. When Kendra and Seth flip over the mirror, the obsessed critters flip it back over again, leaving the siblings puzzled.\n\nLater, Kendra finds that the biggest key unlocks a jewelry box full of costume jewelry, and the smallest key unlocks an armoire inside the dollhouse. In the armoire is a piece of chocolate shaped like a rosebud, and a small golden key, bigger than the key that opened the armoire but smaller than the key that opened the jewelry box. Kendra searches a telescope that stands near a window for keyholes but finds nothing. She is about to turn away when she sees Dale carrying something in both hands. When she goes to the yard to confront him, it turns out that it is just milk. Dale tells Kendra that their milking cows make a little extra milk than they need, so he puts it out for the insects while telling her to not tell Grandpa Sorenson in case he disapproves. Meanwhile, Seth disobeys rules and wanders the woods, stumbling upon a creepy old lady in an ivy shack. He ran back to the yard upon noticing her appearance and strange hospitality as she had continuously invited him inside. Back at the house, Kendra finds the Journal of Secrets with 3 keyholes, but none of the keys she has fits except the golden one she found in the dollhouse. Seth shows Kendra a hidden pond with gazebos, a boardwalk, and a boathouse. That night at dinner, Grandpa asks a rhetorical question, stating, \"What do you suppose makes people so eager to break rules?\" When Seth says that they weren't afraid of ticks, Grandpa tells them the real reason why they have to stay out of the woods: He really runs a preserve full of endangered, poisonous animals. Seth goes into lawyer mode and manages to worm out of trouble. Since they have disobeyed his orders, they have to stay inside the house until their parents come to get them, but luckily, Kendra talks him out of it and they get partial punishment as a warning.\n\nSoon after, Kendra figures out how to open the journal completely, and inside all she finds is a single phrase, 'drink the milk'. Deciding that she needed a guinea pig to test the milk that Dale claimed to be hazardous, Kendra dared Seth to drink the milk. When Kendra drinks the milk, the insects flying around suddenly turn into fairies. Grandpa explains that his property is not a preserve for endangered animals, but for magical creatures such as fairies, trolls, and centaurs. This piece of information would completely turn their visit around, though not at first. Seth made a bad choice concerning a fairy and was turned into some sort of mutated walrus. Luckily, Muriel, the old lady Seth found in the woods, managed to sort him out, but at a high price to his family."
