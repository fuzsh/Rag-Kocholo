        "text": "A Cape Fear series reimagining the 1962 and 1991 thrillers of the same name is in the works with Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese as executive producers, reports Deadline.\n\nThe show comes from creator, executive producer, and showrunner Nick Antosca, who has worked on series like Hannibal and the Hulu true crime anthology The Act.\n\nDescribed as a “tense, contemporary thriller that examines America’s obsession with true crime in the 21st century,” the series centers around a pair of married attorneys who are set for a showdown with an infamous killer from their past, who has just gotten released from several years in prison.\n\nThe 1962 Cape Fear movie was based on John D. MacDonald’s 1957 novel The Executioners and directed by J. Lee Thompson from storyboards created by original director Alfred Hitchcock. It starred Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum, and Polly Bergen.\n\nRelated Video\n\nMeanwhile, the 1991 remake was directed by Scorsese and starred Robert De Niro, Nick Nolte, and Jessica Lange. In both films, only the husband was the lawyer.\n\nThe Cape Fear series marks the first TV collaboration between Scorsese and Spielberg. Interestingly enough, the 1991 Cape Fear remake was originally developed by Spielberg while Scorsese was working on Schindler’s List. They ended up swapping projects, with Spielberg staying on as a producer on Cape Fear through his company Amblin Entertainment."
