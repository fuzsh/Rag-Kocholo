        "text": "One of my projects for this year is to finally watch every film in Martin Scorsese’s filmography. Last week we got to “Cape Fear,” his 1991 thriller and immediate follow-up to “Goodfellas.” But before watching Scorsese’s “Cape Fear,” I wanted to watch the original 1962 film, starring Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum, Polly Bergen and Martin Balsam and directed by J. Lee Thompson.\n\nBoth films are wonderful, with rich performances and powerfully thrilling sequences. The 1962 film is a fairly straightforward noir, anchored by an electrifying Mitchum, who brings a touch of John Milton’s Satan to his performance: charming, charismatic and dangerously insincere. Scorsese’s take on the story is much more psychological and much more interested in the demons and desires that drive the main characters. One need only see the visuals — lurid and voyeuristic in a way that’s more reminiscent of Brian De Palma than Scorsese — to get a sense of the vibe.\n\nWatching the movies back to back in this way was incredibly fruitful because they’re excellent films and because they comment on each other in interesting and revealing ways.\n\nBased on the 1957 novel “The Executioners,” both releases of “Cape Fear” tell the story of Sam Bowden, a lawyer who is responsible for sending Max Cady to prison for rape. Upon his release, having served a lengthy sentence for his crime, Cady stalks and terrorizes Bowden, his wife and his daughter. When the police fail to stop Cady — who has worked carefully to avoid breaking the law — Bowden takes things into his own hands.\n\nHe hires a private investigator to track Cady (and find anything incriminating to use against him), and even goes as far as to hire paid goons to attack and injure him, in hopes of forcing Cady to flee. When none of this works, Bowden and his family escape to their houseboat on the Cape Fear River. Cady follows, and the two men square off against each other in a final confrontation.\n\nIn the 1962 film, Gregory Peck’s Bowden is an upstanding member of his community, a respected lawyer who, years earlier, testified against Cady after witnessing and stopping an assault. Like so many of Peck’s characters from this period, Bowden is the archetypal white American patriarch, secure in his status and confident of his ability to defend his home and hearth. Cady stands as a direct challenge to Bowden’s masculine dominance — their first encounter in the film, for example, is when Cady shoves his hand into Bowden’s car and turns off the ignition. The story of this film is the story of Bowden affirming his status as patriarch, of showing his family — and the world — that he can defend them from any threat that might emerge.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
