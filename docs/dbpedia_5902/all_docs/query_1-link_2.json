        "text": "Positive Role Models\n\nvery little\n\nOn the face of it, Sam is a family man who takes his job as a lawyer seriously. However, it soon emerges that he is on the cusp of having an affair with a colleague -- it's also suggested he has been unfaithful in the past -- and has also buried some evidence in an earlier court case. He also behaves aggressively towards his wife and daughter as the pressure of his situation gets to him. Max is a convicted rapist. He is violent, manipulative, and obsessed on exacting revenge on Sam. Leigh is a strong woman who despite having a difficult relationship with her daughter, Danielle, would do anything to protect her. Danielle is depicted as being rebellious, smoking pot and going against her parents wishes. A police officer suggests to Sam that he should use (illegal) force to stop Max. The housekeeper, Graciela, is Latino, which plays up to racial stereotypes. A confederate flag bumper sticker is seen.\n\nViolence & Scariness\n\na lot\n\nPlenty of bloody violence with the threat of sexual assault never far away. Characters hit with pistols, pipes, and chains leaving bloody wounds and severe bruising. A character is brutally assaulted in their bed. They are handcuffed, have their arm broken, a part of their cheek bitten off, and are repeatedly punched -- the latter seen in silhouette form through a window. It emerges they were then raped. A character's throat is slit with a piano wire before being shot -- they are seen lying in a giant pool of their own blood. A family dog is poisoned. Multiple references and suggestions of rape. In one scene, a character is about to be forced to watch the rape of their spouse and child, but the perpetrator is set on fire before they can do so. A parent grabs their teenage child by the face in an aggressive manner. A married couple shake each other in an act of aggression. Various fight scenes with headlocks, headbutts, punches, head stamping, and people being hit with rocks. During a storm a boat crashes into rocks and subsequently falls apart. Character drowns.\n\nDid you know you can flag iffy content?

It is a remake of the 1962 movie of the same name. Convicted rapist Max Cady (De Niro) blames his former lawyer, Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte), for his incarceration and is determined to make him pay. The violence is bloody and involves guns, bike chains, pipes, rocks, and a piano wire used to cut someone's throat. A woman is brutally assaulted in her bed by Max after drunkenly meeting him at a bar. She has her arm broken and part of her cheek bitten off leaving a nasty wound. She is then repeatedly punched, a scene witnessed in silhouette form. It is then revealed that Max raped her. She in part wrongly blames her drunkenness for the assault. In another scene, Max is about to rape both Sam's wife, Leigh (Jessica Lange) and daughter, Danielle (Juliette Lewis) in front of him while he's tied up. However, Danielle throws a flammable liquid on Max causing his cigar to set him on fire. Many characters smoke, with Sam taking up smoking during the course of the movie. Danielle also smokes some pot given to her by Max. There is strong language throughout including multiple use of \"f--king\" and \"son of a bitch.\" Both De Niro and Lewis were Oscar nominated for their roles.
