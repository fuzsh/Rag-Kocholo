        "text": "Cape Fear Script - Dialogue Transcript\n\nVoila! Finally, the Cape Fear script is here for all you quotes spouting fans of the movie directed by Martin Scorsese starring Nick Nolte, Robert De Niro, Juliette Lewis, Jessica Lange, etc. This script is a transcript that was painstakingly transcribed using the screenplay and/or viewings of Cape Fear. I know, I know, I still need to get the cast names in there and I'll be eternally tweaking it, so if you have any corrections, feel free to drop me a line. You won't hurt my feelings. Honest. Swing on back to Drew's Script-O-Rama afterwards for more free movie scripts!\n\nCape Fear Script\n\n\"My Reminiscence. \" I always thought that for such a lovely river, the name was mystifying: \"Cape Fear. \" When the only thing to fear on those enchanted summer nights... was that the magic would end, and real life would come crashing in. Okay, Cady, the moment you've been waiting for. Any people comin' for you, Cady? What about your books? Already read 'em. Gracias. ! Hola! Hi. How are you? ? Cómo está usted? Bien, bien. ? Es ropa limpia? No, no. That means clean. These are dirty. The idea is to resolve the tension. I need to find a motif that's about movement. Not the most mind-blowing concept for a travel agency, but what the hey? Like an arrow, maybe? Yeah, like an arrow. Maybe. But then the other aspect is stability, a company that you can trust. If you can balance those ideas in a way that's pleasing to the eye, then you got a logo. Okay: Movement, stability... and an arrow. Okay, I'll think of something for that one. Benjamin. They switched babies on me at the hospital, didn't they? How'd you do in there? I got the judge to postpone the alimony hearing for days. Oh, great. I've got till Monday to find out which S&L, in which municipality... my son-in-law stashed all that money. Right, right. But I thank you and my daughter thanks you. You're welcome, Tom. Here's... Daddy! Good-bye, junior! ! Adiós! ! Hasta luego! Sayonara! That's very creative, junior! He liked me. All this time, he actually liked me. You can't go in! Your father's making a TVappearance for his campaign! Jack, let me talk to you. What is this? This smoke? Excuse me... Excuse me. Let's move our seats. All right, just get the hell outta here. I'm making a goddamn campaign. Okay, then I quit as your son! Do you believe that annoying, loser guy? Dad, you should've punched him out. Punched him out? What do you mean? You box. You could've shoved him, shut him up. Yeah, yeah. I could take you. That's who I could take. You could've kicked him in the face. Kicked him? Yeah, you know how to fight dirty. You do that for a living. Real cute, Leigh. How much do I owe you? It's taken care of. Taken care of? Who? There. Girls, girls. Come on, let's sit inside. Whoa! Mr. Perfect form! No, no, I don't. Look, you gotta snap your wrist on the backhand. Usually I like a little music at this point. Sam, I want to play in this lifetime. All right, all right. You gotta snap your wrist. Tag. You know, we should stop doing this for awhile. Doing what? We're not doing anything. I know that. Yet. Okay, fine. Maybe you're right. Does your wife mind? My wife doesn't even know you exist, which most certainly is for the best. Why's that? Lori, you know why you have to ask that question? 'Cause you've never been married. Is marriage synonymous with deception? No, no, no. It's just that when two people... When two people get married... and they live together for a long time, it's uh... I like hanging out with you, so sue me. You're funny and you're cute, and we talk about the courts... and which judge is senile... and which one wears a gun under his robe. You know, Lori, another time, another place. Who knows, you know? Tomorrow? Yeah, it's a light docket. No, no. I've won two out of three. Let's make it the best out of five. That's good, actually, because today I let you win. - Sure you did. - See ya. Hey! Free as a bird, apparently. You go everywhere you want with whomever. That much freedom could get a fella into trouble. I'd like my keys. Could it be you don't remember me? Sure, I remember you. You were at the movie house. Oh, I'm disappointed. I'm hurt. I would like my keys. Max Cady. You look the same. Maybe pounds heavier. But they say the average man gains a pound a year... Oh, come on. Gains a pound a year till he's about . Me, I dropped a pound every year of my sentence. Atlanta, ' . You got it. July. Fourteen years since I held a set of keys. You look good, healthy. Thank you, 'cause it's a struggle to stay healthy in the joint. But you wouldn't know about that, would ya? If you were me, they'd stick you with the white trash. They don't strike a lick of work all day. This little ol' cigar is my only vice. I needed a vice in the joint to remind me I was human. What brings you to New Essex? Oh, the climate. Boy, the south. I'm thinkin' of settlin' here in New Essex, Counselor. Have you been following me? It's a small town. Everywhere you turn, we're gonna run into each other. Take care, Mr. Cady. You too. You're gonna learn about loss. What? Dad, could you... hmm? Sorry, Danny. What're you working on? It's English. We're supposed to read Look Homeward, Angel, which is a kind of reminiscence, and we have to attempt something in the same style. What's it about, your reminiscence? The houseboat. Oh, the houseboat. It's not even July rd yet. We ought to take two weeks off and go up to Wilmington... like the old times, down to the houseboat. I wanted to in early June. You said you didn't have time. I probably don't. Now I don't, either. Danny's got summer school till labor day. She can't miss two damn weeks? You know, the alternative was to expel her. Maybe this drama teacher from the college... will get her excited about something. About him, probably. Why'd they have to make such a stink, like she was on heroin or something? I mean, what's marijuana? You and I smoked dope in our time. In some cultures, it's considered almost a sacrament. I realize in ours it's forbidden. Right up there with incest and necrophilia and bestiality... Honey, honey, honey. Worship of idols, cannibalism. Do that again. What? Do that again. Sam, somebody's out there! What? Leave the light off. Leave it off. I saw him when the fireworks went off. What? I think I talked to him this afternoon. You know him? I want you the hell off my property! He's gone. He said, \"I'm gonna make you think about loss, \" or \"I'm gonna make you learn about loss. \" Something like that. That's very poetic. Who is he, and where did he come from? He's from... Leigh, get the dog off. Ben, get down. He doesn't mind me at all. It's your dog. Come on. He shouldn't be up on the table. You're gonna have dog hairs in your tea. Get down. Where's he from? He's from the hills, Pentecostal crackers. What was he in prison for? I think it was battery. You think it was battery? Did he batter a man? Did he batter a woman? I don't know. It was years ago. You know, it's kinda... I really don't remember. What does he want with you? He's just tryin'to bug us. Just messin'around. He's an ex-con, so he's just... You know, he's probably upset at the lawyer. Yeah, your clientele. Yeah. Bye, Dad. Bye, Danny. You look tired. Thanks. I needed that. I don't want to alarm her, but I'd rather Danny didn't wander alone... on her soul-searching walks in the woods, at least till I've started a few things. What if she takes Benjamin with her? Ben, our guard dog? What's he gonna do, lick him to death? Just tell her. I hardly know anything about the man. I don't mean his biography, just there's some creep around. If you see him again, call the cops and then call me. What about a weapon? In case things get exciting around here. Would you feel more secure with a loaded gun in the house? We'd end up using it on each other. Or Danny would. He's not gonna do anything. He just got out of prison. He doesn't want to go right back. Call Lee Heller. Lee's a colorful character, but he's still the best criminal lawyer in the state. Good. Get me Lee Heller. You defended this guy, right? Right. So what makes you think he wants to harm you? Yesterday I was getting in my car. The guy comes up. We have a conversation. He says to me, \"You're gonna learn about loss. \" That'd hardly qualify under the terrorist threat statutes. Come on, Tom! The guy's an ex-con! You know as well as I do what that means. Last night, there he was behind our house. - Attempted b and E. - No, not exactly. He was sitting on a wall that bounds our property. That's not even trespassing, Sam. What can I say? Get a restraining order. I filed one this morning. The hearing's in ten days. Good. Anything I can do. Tom, years ago... in this case, I had a report on a victim. It was a rape case. That's right, rape and aggravated sexual battery. I had a report on this victim, and it came back that she was promiscuous. And, uh... I buried it. Whew. Anybody else know? No, I buried it. I didn't show it to the client, to the prosecution. But if you had seen what this guy had done to this girl... \"In every criminal prosecution, the accused shall have... the assistance of counsel for his defense. \" I know the th Amendment, but I believe in the th Amendment. That's why I left the public defender's office. Some folks just don't have the right to the best defense? Of course they deserve the best defense! But if you had seen what he did to this girl... Buried the report. If it was your own daughter, Tom... Buried the report. Jesus, Sam. Oh, God. But I don't see how he could know that. He was illiterate. I had to read everything to him: The probable cause affidavit, the arrest reports, everything. There's no way he could know that. Danny, it's so quiet out here and the light's so perfect. Why don't you get your book and come out here and read? Why? I told you why. Well, is it because he's like a flasher or just a peeper? What do you know about that? A flasher? You don't think I've been flashed before? I didn't mean to insult you. I'm sure you've been flashed. If you want to come out, come on out. Do whatever you want. Oh, but don't go outside. Afternoon, Counselor. What do you want, Mr. Cady? Mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm! They're great at that age, ain't they? All those discoveries ahead of them. You're lucky, Counselor. My own daughter, she don't even know me. After I went inside, her mama told her I was dead. Which, in a way, I was. Look, Mr. Cady, I realize that you suffered. I understand your problem, but I mean, why me? I was your lawyer. I defended you. Why not badger the D.A. Or the judge? \"Badger\"? Why not them? Badger. Why not? Best I remember, they was just doin' right by their jobs. I didn't do my job? Is that right? I pleaded you out to a lesser included offense. You could've gotten rape instead of battery. I'd have been up for parole either way in seven years. Rape is a capital offense. You could've gotten life. You could've done death. You could be sittin' on death row right now. I learned to read durin' my stretch. First, Spot Goes to The Farm, then Runaway Bunny, then law books, mostly. Did you know that after I discharged you, I acted as my own attorney? Applied several times for an appeal. No, I didn't know that. Mm-hmm. So, here we are... two lawyers, for all practical purposes, talkin' shop. How much do you want, Mr. Cady? How much do I want what? How much money do you want? Money? Counselor, do I look destitute to you? I'm open to discussion, within reasonable limits. You ever been a woman? A what? A woman. Some fat, hairy, ugly hillbilly's wet dream. I realize that you suffered. There's no question about that. You don't know what sufferin' is, Counselor. Like it says in Galatians : \"Have ye suffered so many things in vain?\" I learned from the get-go in the joint... to get in touch with the soft side of myself, the feminine side. Well, I'm open to some sort of discussion... on compensation. What shall be my compensation, sir, for being held down and sodomized by four white guys? Or four black guys? Shall my compensation be the same? What is the formula for compensation, sir? How about $ in cash? Do I... Let's just break that down. That figure just came to the top of my head. Let's break it down. For argument's sake, let's say $ $ . I'll tell you what, let's say $ . $ into years. Fourteen years times days... I'd say is about days. You divide that by $ and that's like $ a day. That's not even minimum wage! To say nothing about the family that I lost, the respect. I don't think you really, really understand... what we're talkin' about here. Fourteen years. Whoops! Uh-oh! Gotta git. I'm late for another appointment. Sam, my man, I got some good news. I got the bank, the account number. I'll call your son-in-law's lawyer. Mr. Bowden? Your wife's on line one. Ask her to hold. I gotta make a call. I wouldn't make that call. The way I'd handle... Mr. Bowden, she says it's urgent. Yeah? These kind of horrible, high-pitched howls. They sounded like he was screaming. And then Danny came running in, and... I called the vet. And then it was so weird, because... it was like he was winding down, just winding down like an old clock. And then all of a sudden he just stopped. He had this kind of... his eyes just wide open, and this kind of... surprised look. And then... And then he died. He just died, before the vet even got here. What'd the vet say? That he was poisoned. Poisoned? What kind of a poison? I don't know what kind of poison. Jesus, Leigh! I told you not to let him out! - I didn't let him out! - Then how? I've got an English Setter, so I don't cotton to dog killers. Trouble is, poisoning a dog is just a fine. But if he's unemployed, he's gotta have money or we'll bust him for vagrancy. We'll give him a full-body strip search. Jerk a knot in his tail. All right. We got so many ways on the books to lean on an undesirable. He'll feel about as welcome around here as a case of yellow fever. - Hands against the wall. - Spread 'em! That him? One-way mirror. He doesn't know you're here. Yeah, that's him. Get the shirt off. Come on, hurry up. Just pass it over to him. Hand it to me. Knock off the shoes. Hand 'em to the other officer. Pass 'em to him. Come on. Let's put the arms out. Put the arms out straight. - Roll your palms. - Do what he says. Turn around, slow. Sheesh. I don't know whether to look at him or read him. Stand still. One more step for you. You know the routine. Against the wall. We searched his apartment. His car registration, everything's in order. There's no guns or any weapons, but we found these. Cady's savings account. $ ? His mother died, the farm got sold. He got the proceeds. Well, he's got money. Where does that leave us? We nail him for the dog. What happened? You let the dog out. Cady abducted him. No, uh... we didn't let the dog out. Cady came into your house? That's illegal entry with intent! No, no, no. But he didn't come into the house. I don't know exactly how he did it, I just know that he did it. That's not good enough, Mr. Bowden. You're a lawyer. You damn-well know that. Get off the pants. He's gonna screw up. The Sheriff assured me that they always do. He's gonna get the message in no uncertain terms. I'd still like to kill him. Danny, how come you didn't join up with them? You can tap. You can do that. You can tap. Dance. I wanted to once, but I don't know. Son-of-a-bitch! What? He's staring at you. What are you talking about? What the hell are you doin'? Mmm, hot as a firecracker on the th of July. You're damn lucky to have her, boy. Son-of-a-bitch! - Where the hell did he go? - Son-of-a-bitch! Watch my arm. It might be broke. What's with you, buddy? You have no right to be pushin' me around. I was just watchin' the parade. Son-of-a-bitch! What are you gettin' so upset about? You're lucky I don't sue you. All right, all right! Settle down! I'm settled down. Sam, what are you doing? It's nothing. Who was that? Let's go. The fellow with the tie. His wife took him away. I think he really hurt his arm. Mom. That's a strong drink you've got there. You said it. Just put a goldfish in it and you'll be fine. You seem to be having a good time. I've been practicing. Practicing for what? How to fall on the floor? A life of debauchery. Debauch... Debauchery. It's a three-syllable word. Making fun of me? That's okay, no problem. I made you blush. Blush? You're now the color of your shirt: Scarlet. I had no business getting stuck on a guy who was married. You certainly did not. I don't know what I was thinking. God only knows. Aren't I the bozo on this bus? Lest you think that I slept with this particular... That's your business. That's not mine. I don't want it to sound like I've been through... a bus load of'em. That's the way it sounded to me. He was the first. Oh, yeah. He was, I swear. Tell it to the judge. Actually, the rat stood me up today. Did he? What a shame. I know. Now it's my turn. Where are you from? Where am I from? You're gonna love this. I'm from, uh... Georgia State Correctional Facility. You think I'm jokin'. I just got released from prison. Oh, my God. This is the way my day's been turning out. Actually, it reminds me of a joke. Do you want to hear it? Tell me. Liven up the night. An unmarried woman, uh... wait, that's not it. Get the joke straight, darlin'. Shut up! An unmarried woman, she meets a guy, and he tells her he just got out of prison. \"What'd you do?\" She asks. \"I hacked my wife into pieces with a chain saw. \" She says... She says, \"So, you're single?\" That's even funnier! Thank you. Could I ask you something? What did you do? I knew you were gonna ask. I hacked my wife into pieces. I was afraid you were gonna say that. I'm a very small person, so maybe... Well, maybe I can hack you into pieces. What did you do, really? No, really, but what did you do? There was this protest march on this nuclear power plant. And so when they came to arrest us, this macho sheriff got rough with the lady behind me, so I popped the bastard. So they gave me a little time for it. I'm drinking a Sea Breeze. I hope you can afford them. You gotta stay sober. If you ain't sober, you're takin' your chances. 'Cause I'm just one hell of an animal. Yeah? Do tell. Get you on this side, doll. Let's do this. Who is Loretta? That's the love of my life. She's no longer with us. I thought I was the love of your life. Chopped her into pieces. He hurt you like this, that married guy? No. He hurt you like this? We never did anything. Like this? Oh, scandal! He's a rough one. How's this feel? Oh, my God. Am I under arrest? Not quite, darlin'. Officer, I swear, it's all a mistake. That married guy hurt you like this? 'Cause what he did to me hurt a lot worse than this! No! Ahhh! I've got you now, bitch! Danny, when did this key stop working? What? Oh. I don't know. No wonder. A wire's missing. Piano wire is missing. Was somebody fooling around with the piano? What? Yeah? Mr. Bowden, I think we might could have a little break here. Good, good. I can be there in a half-hour. All right, fine. Who was that? Cady raped another girl. Rape? You said it was battery. The case was a wobbler. I got it reduced. I remember those days, \"old slippery Sam. \" I just didn't want to alarm you or Danny. How old was that girl? Sixteen. Sixteen? What? Well, my birthday is coming up. Neighbors heard screams and called us. When the perp drove off, somebody made his plate. Max Cady. Great. We got one bitty problem. Girl's scared. She's claiming she fell down some stairs. Sam... don't... don't look at me. Oh, my God. You two know each other? Um... Yeah, we work together. I'll be outside. I'm so stupid. Oh, Lori, don't. You stood me up at the club the other day, and then you didn't call. And by last night I was feeling... pretty reckless. I thought about what you said, you know, that your wife... That she didn't know I existed. And I felt like... I was gonna show you. I guess I showed you, all right, didn't I? I guess I really showed you! Lori. Lori, listen to me, okay? Now look. This guy, Cady, he's done this kind of thing before. Now, he's gonna do this over and over again... unless you testify... and we take him to court... No. And press charges and testify. No, no. Sam, I know how it works. I see it every day. Only this time I'm on the other side. I don't want to explain why I was in a bar, and how much I had to drink, and what I was wearing; not by the people I work with. Not by the guys that I see cross-examine... other people on the stand. Just crucify 'em. They just laugh about it later. They'll even ask about you. Lori, listen to me. I don't care about that. Well, I care about that. I'm sure you do, too. I'm... I'm... I'm terribly sorry, Lori. I'm just terribly sorry. If this is something personal between you and the girl and Cady... Personal? Come on, lieutenant. All right, what are you implying? Only that there are some things that are better handled quietly, not by the police. Cady is planning to rape my wife, but it's not your problem. I can't bust someone for planning to rape your wife. You know that damn-well! Thanks all the same. The way I'd handle it... File a restraining order? Just think of this Cady as a tiger. Get him out of the brush. How do we do that? Stake out a couple of your goats and hide in a tree. What are you suggesting? That I use my family as bait? And then what? Hope that this psychopath attacks my wife and child? And then blow his head off? I'm a law officer. It would be unethical of me to advise a citizen... to take the law into his own hands. So, I suppose you must've misunderstood me. I guess I must've. Well, pardon me all over the place. And he's been harassing my family. He's clever, cleverly so that the law can't touch him. I believe he's able to slip into the house undetected. Although, is he out? I can't tell. He's either out or in. I'm not sure. I can't see through walls. I'm not askin' you to see through walls. Why can't anybody do anything for me? What good are cops and laws... Sam, Sam, calm down. Let me explain something. The system is set up to handle generalized problems... like burglary and robbery. But if some lone creep targets you for some obscure reason, the system's slow and skeptical. It's pathetic, even. What's your connection with this fellow? I was his lawyer, his public defender. But you shafted him somehow. Well, at least that's the way he perceives it. I don't care what you did. What did he do? He raped a -year-old girl. Do you have a daughter around ? She's . I'll do a background check, follow him for a week, and write you up a risk assessment. Great, great. Now the cops... I can find him. Just take it easy, stay calm. All right. Danny, you can just relax because... your daddy has a private investigator on the payroll. Isn't that right? What's your feeling about him? What, Sam Spade? Mickey Spillane? Peter Gunn? Dirty Harry? Perry Mason? No, Perry Mason was for lawyers. The minute I walked in this guy's office, I felt relaxed. This guy's totally in charge. Kersek deals with these types for a living. He looked like he was gonna enjoy... - Yes? - It's me. After you left, I had this conversation with a C.O. At Statesboro Prison. Seems our man Cady had a job in the kitchen. Right. There was this other inmate working there with him. Right. Hated Cady's cigar smoke, and was always moanin' about it. They found him with his neck broke and his tongue bit off. - Oh, Jesus. - Yeah. They never could place Cady near the scene of the \"accident,\" if you want to call it that. But the parole board, they kept him in for another seven years. Uh-oh, subject's on the move. Get a good night's sleep. Who was that? Our private eye. I thought we were relaxed now. New essex county Hospital. Room please. One minute, please. All right. Hello? Hi, Lori. It's me, Sam. Lori, I just feel god-awful you got dragged into this. It's not your fault. If I had any idea that Cady would hurt you to get at me, I would've warned you. Yeah, I know. I'm glad you called. Yep, yep. I'm so sorry about this. I feel the same way. Well, are you really determined about... movin'back to Connecticut? I've thought about it a lot. I think it's probably the best thing. I thought that maybe I could go back to school. I'm really gonna miss you, though. Excuse me, Lori. That sounds real good. Yeah? That's gonna work out fine. I'll get back to ya. All right, bye. Well, I just don't know what I hate more, that insipid tone or your stupid, sophomoric infidelities. Who was that, huh? The girl that got beat up? Yes, Lori Davis. I already told you. She works at the County Courthouse. And what? You're fucking her? Oh, no. Interesting choice, Sam. Calling from our bedroom phone. Why is it that whenever... I have a private phone conversation, you assume that I'm fucking someone? That's why that psychopath chose her, right? Yes, that's why he chose her. But I'm not fucking her in any way. Uh-huh. You sleazy son-of-a-bitch! You son-of-a-bitch! Damn it! You son-of-a-bitch! Stop it! Leigh! Danny's right downstairs. Oh, honey, there's nothing the matter. Yeah, I can see, Dad. You promised to leave that shit in Atlanta. What shit? Christ, what a waste. The humiliation we went through confessing our dirty secrets... in those horrible sessions with Dr. Hackett. We talked that one damn incident to death. Why did you bother? Because you asked me... I mean, why did you bother? Why did you bother! Why did you bother with you and me? With the marriage? Uprooting me and Danny, moving? That's what we decided to do! You said you wanted to get out! You don't get it. What is it I don't get? - What don't I get? - Why put us through that! Nadine? It's Danny. Nothing. I'm just losing my mind here. You don't have the balls to walk out, if that's what you wanted. Like I was gonna split with you acting the way you act. Acting? You did some acting. I don't remember doing any acting. You don't remember? Let me refresh your memory. Do you remember not taking any work? Not fixing any meals? I'm not on fucking trial here! Do you remember crying every morning and evening? Do you remember that? I scared you, huh? What did you think, Sam? You thought maybe I was gonna kill myself? Over you? Well, who else? You pompous ass! You wouldn't leave the bedroom! I wish you could say the same. Isn't this what Dr. Hackett talked about? Diggin' up the past. The relevant issue is whether I've been messin' around, and I have not been. As far as this girl goes, she's just a kid. That shouldn't stop you. She's a baby! You gravitate to people in the same profession. You gravitate to women. I'm a lawyer, she's a clerk. She looks up to me! She's just infatuated. I can't help that! Look, Leigh. I'm scared. This whole thing has... I keep feeling that there's some animal out there, stalking us. I think he wants to hurt us in the worst way. And that's got me frightened to death. You really are scared, aren't you? Oh, yeah. Somebody finally got to you. Look, Leigh, I think that this guy beat and raped her... because he knew that she wouldn't testify, that she wouldn't press charges. Because she knows the system. I mean, she works in it. She knows that she'd be on trial. And then, because she wouldn't testify, you would assume that there was something going on between us... and it would cause a rift. And that we'd be much more vulnerable to him. I'm glad we talked about this, because we can work together. We can beat that son-of-a-bitch, the two of us, together, working as a team. Oh, boy! Jesus. Oh, yeah, this is great. This is somethin' else. Oh... shit! And here you go. I'm sorry. I haven't ordered yet. That fellow over there sent this over, paid for. Which one? That guy that's just leaving. Excuse me. Hey, Cady! Come here. Wait a second. I've been in a real bad mood lately. You know what you can do to brighten my mood? - No. - Get the hell outta here. I don't mean this town. I mean the whole state. I don't wanna see ya, hear ya, and i don't wanna smell ya. Are you my friend? No, I'm not your friend. I thought maybe you were my friend, because I like to plan my comin's and goin's with friends. But if you're not my friend, I'd call that presumptuous. I'd call it downright rude, 'cause I ain't your porch-baby. Well, gee-golly-gosh. I sure am sorry I offended you, you white-trash piece of shit. Ooh, I got the all-over fidgets on that one! You've really shaken me up. I'm shiverin' all over. It's not necessary to lay a foul tongue on me, my friend. I could get upset. Things could get outta hand. And then in self-defense, I could do somethin' to you that you would not like. You feel squirrelly. You just jump. You threatenin' me? - You threatenin' me? - You catch on fast. 'Cause I'm well within my rights to be here. And if I stay here, what you gonna do? I don't give a rat's ass about your rights. You watch your step. What you gonna do, arrest me? You a cop, or were you not good enough to remain on the force? That's the feelin' I'm gettin' here. Hope you enjoyed your breakfast. Ma'am, this belong to you? Can I help you? I just found it. Thought you might need it back. If a dogcatcher comes across a dog without a license, he's liable to think it's a stray... and do God-knows-what to it. You know, um... Our dog is... He passed away. What a shame. Yeah. A man's best friend. A woman's, too. Even without closin'my eyes, I can picture him... Big, friendly, shaggy, asleep at your feet. Keepin' you company while you're tryin' to finish up... those pesky, little sketches. Oh, you're Max Cady, aren't you? Get the hell outta here before I call the police! I'm not doin'nothin'. I'm just givin' you back your dog collar. You want to look around? Go ahead, Mr. Cady, take a good look. Nice house. Yeah, it is a nice house. You satisfied now? Or is there more, huh? Is that it? There is gonna be more, isn't there? You won't stop until you're happy. How can I be happy, Leigh, when you're not happy? You don't know anything about me. I know what I see, ma'am. Yeah? Mm-hmm. I wanted to know what you looked like. I've been waitin' to see your face, but now that I see you, you are just repulsive. I understand. I'm not your type. No. All that prison time made me coarse. Guess I'm covered in too many tattoos. There's not a whole lot to do in prison... but desecrate your flesh. It didn't have to be that way for either of us... if your husband hadn't betrayed us both. Who knows? We might've been different people. We might've been happy, Leigh. - Mom, someone's on the phone! - Danny, don't come out here! Hey, Sam! Yo, Sam! I thought I'd catch you here. Well, that little smart aleck made me. He what? It wasn't my fault. He was lookin' to be covered. There is a lot of cutsie-cutsie in that little prick. I told ya. You know where he was? At the public library reading Thus Spake Zarathustra, by Friedrich Nietzsche. He's this German philosopher. Said that God is dead. We can keep goin' this way, but it's gonna get expensive. I'm not so concerned about days. Stay on him a few more nights. Do you really want to resolve this situation? I'd love to resolve it. Then I've got a suggestion. There's men that can be hired, by me, to do a little hospital job on Cady. What are we talkin' about here? Two pieces of pipe, a bicycle chain. Sam, he won't be so scary after that. Are we agreed that I'm a lawyer? Maybe years ago we'd have taken this guy and stoned him to death. I can't operate outside the law. The law's my business. I'm home! Where is everybody? In here. Evenin', ladies. Oh, chicken. How is everything? Is everything okay? Yeah. Good, good. He was here today. Hello? Hello, Danielle? Is this Miss Danielle Bowden? Yeah. This is your new teacher callin'. From English or drama? Drama. How ya doin'? Fine. I'm just goin'down the list, greetin'my summer students. You sound kinda down. No... Um, there's just been stuff going on around here. Anything I can do? I doubt it. Shit happens, you know, like the T-shirt says. Yeah. You know, Danielle... all that negativity, you can use that. What do you mean? I'm the kind of teacher that takes a personal interest in his kids. Everything you're going through, it's okay. The awkwardness you feel when you're walkin' down the street... and some leerin'fool's makin'fun of your sexuality. The turmoil you feel... when that time of month comes around. The anger that you feel that your mom and dad... won't let you just grow up and be a woman. Don't suppress or deny it. Use it in your life and your work. Okay. I mean, uh... That's... I'll have to think about all that. So, class is tomorrow in room right? No, it's been changed to the theater. What better place for drama, right? Yeah. And remember, Danielle, you can use all those fears to draw upon and learn. You know this little tune? # If you wanna do right # # All day... # # Woman # # Woman, you gotta be A... # # Do-right man # # All-night man ## You can trust in me, 'cause I'm the do-right man. Okay? 'Night now. Okay. Good night. Honey, I think maybe I should walk you in. No, it's okay, Mom. There's a lot of people here. I'll be right here at : to pick you up. Okay. Bye... Hi! I didn't think summer session was gonna be so crowded. They're just having a meeting about next fall's chorus program. I have to go downstairs for drama. Okay. Bye. Hello? Nadine? I'm here for the drama class. Hi. Oops. Am I busted? No. I hope not. You can't smoke grass in school. Privilege of the professional. Eases inhibitions. You down here for drama? Yeah. Are you the drama teacher? And you're... let me guess. Cecile James? No. I'm, uh... Danielle Bowden. Danielle? Oh, we spoke last night. Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry. How rude. It's okay. Um... # I think we're alone now # Okay. Hmm. Thanks. Here. I'm gonna give this to you. Ow. Little trick I learned. Take it. You know, when we spoke on the phone last night? Mm-hmm. Um... you really made sense to me and... I thought a lot. Those are human truths, darlin'. That's what it's all about. That's what we deal with here. See the book you have, Thomas Wolfe? It's all about self-discovery, the inner voyage. I like the end where, um... Eugene's journey... It was really, uh, mystical, you know. And it was almost like a pilgrimage? Almost like a cop-out, if you ask me. Those were the facts of Wolfe's life. The novel is what you would call a \"roman a clef. \" You know what that is? I'm not sure. Nonetheless, you can't escape your demons just by leaving home. Although writers do find new freedom when they relocate abroad. Take Henry Miller. Have you read his trilogy? \"Plexus, Nexus, and Sexus. \" No. You haven't read that? You're missin' something. Well, you know what? I did read Tropic of Cancer. Just parts of it though, 'cause, uh... I had to sneak it off my parents' shelf, you know? But, his descriptions are pretty vivid, I would say. Yeah. In one of the novels, I don't recall which, he describes an erection as a piece of lead with wings on it. I didn't read that part. Of course not. You're not allowed. Your parents don't want you to achieve adulthood. That's natural. They know the pitfalls of adulthood, all that freedom. They know it only too well. Temptation to stray, deflecting their guilt and anger onto you... for a crime that's not even a crime... for smokin' grass. Wh... Wait a second. Um... where are you from? Where am I from? Yeah. Where do you think I'm from? I don't know, but... If I told you, you gonna get mad at me? No. I'm from a black forest. That's funny. You're not the drama teacher, are you? Maybe I'm the big, bad wolf. Um... So, you're that guy that's been hanging around the house? You're the one that killed my mom's dog? Your mom's dog was killed? Yeah. I didn't even know anything about that. That's a shame. That's a damn shame. Yes, it was. What kind of dog was it? Um... I don't know. He was just... He was fluffy and... Fluffy? Mm-hmm. So you didn't do that? Of course I didn't do that. Okay. I wouldn't do that. So, what are you doing here then? Well, I came to meet you, to be honest with you. Why? 'Cause... I wanted to meet you, see what you were like. I see you're a nice person. That's all. You're not gonna hurt me, are you? No, I'm not gonna hurt you at all. There's no hurting here, Danielle. 'Tween us there's no anger... nothin'. Just a search for truth. I mean, did you judge me, did you get angry at me... when you caught me smokin' the grass? Hmm? No. But your parents, they judged you. They got plenty angry at you, didn't they? Yeah. Mm-hmm. They punished you for their sins. What did they do? They, uh... My dad... They just yelled a whole lot and, um... My mom cried... and my dad said I couldn't drive the Cherokee. I'd say they punished you for their sins, and you resent that, and you should resent it. But Professor \"Do-Right\" has a little advice for you. You shouldn't damn 'em. Don't judge 'em. Just forgive 'em, for they know not what they do. Well, um, why do you hate my father? I don't hate him at all. Oh, no, I pray for him. I'm here to help him. I mean, we all make mistakes, Danielle. You and I have. At least we try to admit it. Don't we? Yeah. Mm-hmm. But your daddy, he don't. Every man Carries a circle of hell around his head like a halo. Your daddy too. Every man... Every man... has to go through hell to reach his paradise. You know what paradise is? No. Salvation. 'Cause your daddy's not happy. Your mommy's not happy. And you know what? You're not happy. Are you? No, I'm not. You thought about me last night, didn't you? Um, yes, I did. I know. You know, I think I might have found a companion, a companion for that long walk to the light. Do you mind if I put my arm around you? Um... Um... It's okay. No, I don't mind. Okay. Kersek, where have you been? He came at my daughter at school. You asked me to watch him nights, I'm watching. What happened? My wife, Leigh, found marijuana in one of Danny's schoolbooks. We don't know if Cady gave it to her or what, 'cause she's scared and won't talk. This has gone far enough. It's gotta stop. Did you phone the cops? No, I didn't phone the cops. What'd you call them? Slow, skeptical, pathetic. Danny. Leigh, that's all right. Hold on a minute. Uh, Kersek, I want to hire those three guys. Remember the hospital job? Consider it done, the sooner the better. Three men's gonna cost you a grand. I know that's not chicken feed, but you don't want to go with less than three. - It's better to overdo it. - You'll have money by morning. We'll be on for tomorrow night. And, Sam, you feel good about this. Uh... all right. You notice these young people? They don't look very happy. They're committed to their professions and ambitions, but not to each other. Cady, shut up and listen. If you don't leave, if you don't leave my family alone and get out of here, you're gonna be hurtin' like you never dreamed. Could you repeat that? I said, if you don't get out of here, you're gonna be hurtin' like you never dreamed. A threat? Yeah. You bet your ass that's a threat. I have thought of relocatin'... somewhere where I'd be more appreciated... California perhaps. I could teach earthquake preparedness. But then it hits me. I love New Essex, Counselor. I mean, where else could I casually confer with an old colleague? We're not colleagues. Do you understand that? We're not colleagues. You think you're better than me. I don't think I'm better than you. That's not the point. Good. 'Cause if you're not better than me then I can have what you have. - And what do I have? - A wife, a daughter. I'm gonna teach you the meaning of commitment. Fourteen years ago, I was forced to make a commitment... to an eight-by-nine cell. Now you're gonna be forced to make a commitment. You could say I'm here to save you. Fine. Check out the Bible, Counselor... The book between \"Esther\" and \"psalms. \" Danny? Danny! You all right? What? Is everything all right? Yeah. This isn't gonna work, you know. What isn't gonna work? Locking us in, hiding us from the world. Don't be so dramatic, Danny. - Making me stay out of school. - You're going back tomorrow. Put some clothes on. You're not a little kid anymore. Why am I going back to school tomorrow? What are you gonna do? That's none of your concern, Danny. Dad, he didn't force himself on me, you know. I know you'd like to think that he did. But I think he was... I think he was just trying to make a connection with me. Now, Danny, I want you to listen to me, all right? No. You understand? No. There will never be any connection... between you and Max Cady. You understand that? Huh? Did he touch you? What? What are you laughing about? Why are you smilin'? I'm asking you a question. Did he touch you? Wipe that smile off your face! Did he touch you? C'mon. Oh, wait, Danny. I'm sorry. No. No, I'm sorry. Wait, honey. I'm sorry. Get out of here! Get out of here! Oh, Max. C'mon. C'mon. Counselor? Counselor? Is that you? Counselor? Come out, come out, wherever you are. I ain't no white-trash piece of shit. I'm better than you all! I can outlearn you. I can out-read you. I can outthink you. And I can out-philosophize you. And I'm gonna outlast you. You think a couple whacks to my guts is gonna get me down? It's gonna take a hell of a lot more than that, Counselor, to prove you're better than me! \"I am like God and God like me. \"I am as large as God! \"He is as small as I! He cannot above me nor I beneath him be. \" Silesius, th century. Counselor? Counselor? Could you be there? Could you be there? Counselor? I wonder if you're here? Ah, fuck it. If you're here, what the fuck's the difference. Fuck it! I've got Mr. Kersek on one. Good, I'll take it. Tom. Sam, you look tired. You get that writ? No, we've got to get into that. Let me just grab this. I'm sorry about last night. That son-of-a-bitch could survive a nuclear strike. Hang on a second. Tom, I'm not doin' it. I pulled a fast one. It's come back and bit me on the ass in a major way. What you did was dumb. What I'm asking is no big deal. This is my daughter! It's perjury. It's bullshit and I'm not doin' it. Now, excuse me. I'll be in my office. Who was that top criminal lawyer? Lee Heller. We need to talk. Kersek? Word gets out how Cady bushwhacked those bastards, it's gonna be a bitch to line up new guys. No more guys, hear me? Mr. Heller, it's Sam Bowden from Broadbent and Denmeyer. Tom speaks highly of you. He says you're the best and the best is what I need. We froze our butts together in Korea. How can I help you? It's a simple petition for a restraining order, but there's complications. This is short notice, but I need this injunction. There's an ex-convict, Max Cady. He's been harassing my family. I'm sorry, Mr. Bowden. I can't continue this conversation. Is there a more convenient time? The damn thing is, I have a conflict. What would that be? Mr. Cady retained my services as of yesterday. He what? In fact, I see on my phone sheet Mr. Cady called this morning. So, I'm sure he'll... Wait, Lee, look. This man is a psychotic. It appears I'll be seein'ya at that hearing after all. Could you repeat that? I said, if you don't leave, if you don't leave my family alone and get out of here, you're gonna be hurtin' like you never dreamed. A threat? Yeah, you bet your ass that's a threat. You need only glance at my client... to know that Mr. Bowden made good on his... heinous and cowardly threat. Just as God arose to judgment to save the meek of the earth, I hope and pray you will do the same, sir. Your honor, Mr. Cady wouldn't have surreptitiously taped our meeting... unless he knew that... This court does not condone... feuds, vendettas, or vigilantism. Let me quote our great Negro educator, Mr. Booker T. Washington. \"I will let no man drag me down so low... as to make me hate him. \" Yes. I will grant the restraining order, not to validate the malice between you, but in the interest of Christian harmony. You may not come... within yards of... Mr. Maximilian Cady... until such time as the court... may lift the injunction. King Solomon could not have adjudicated more wisely, Your Honor. I am so offended... by the Philistine tactics of Mr. Bowden, I petitioned the A.B.A. For his disbarment... on the grounds of moral turpitude. Now, if you will excuse us, my client... C'mon, son... is due back at the hospital... for the results of his numerous X-rays. Kersek, I want a gun. I need a gun. I want a gun. You want a gun? Yeah. You know anything about guns? No. I don't believe in 'em. I never had them around the house. I'll get you a gun. What kind you want? Now, calm down. Something simple, something I can handle. Let me see what fits you. Forty-five... Let me see your hands. Okay. A. snub-nosed special. All right, good. I can teach you how to use it. Great. The first lesson is: Don't think of it as shooting a man or trying to kill him. Think of it as an extension of your fist, reaching out and knocking a man down. Boom! Boom! All right. Later, we'll go out and shoot some trees. That'd be great. Good. Uh... What is it? What? Sam, I give you a gun, you pull it on Cady, it's gonna dawn on you that shootin' a man is different than blowing holes in trees. Next thing, you don't have my gun. Cady does. No, no. I'd know how to handle a gun. He won't take it away from me. Best-case scenario: You kill Cady dog-dead. Fifteen years to life, do you realize that? Oh, Jesus! It's all fucked up, Kersek! The law considers me more of a loose cannon than Max Cady! Some big-shit attorney's whipped the A.B.A. Ethics Committee into a frenzy. There's an emergency session in Raleigh over the assault. How'd they link that to you? I went to warn Cady. I thought it was the decent thing to do. Maybe I'd scare him. He was wired. Goddamn fools! This hearing, it's real important? Only if I want to continue to practice law. Yeah. - Cady isn't expected there? - No, no, no, no. Mr. Cady, he's beyond reproach. But you're required to be there? Yeah. When is this hearing? Thursday morning, nine o'clock. The torture begins and lasts for two days. Mmm. You have to fly up the night before? Right. Cady's an opportunist. If he thinks you're gonna be outta town for two days, that's gonna be as tempting to him as shit is to a fly. If Cady breaks into your home... he can be killed... justifiably. But he won't show unless he's real sure you're not gonna be there. Have a good trip. All right. Bye-bye. Call us tonight. All right. I didn't miss the : to Raleigh? I'm afraid you did. But there's a : . Oh, it's not that. I have important papers for Samuel Bowden. Was he on the : ? We can't give out that information, sir. I just... I guess I could send it to him overnight... but he might be back, for all I know, tomorrow morning. And I... See, my... My wife and I have been in an accident and he's our lawyer. If I don't get in touch with him, we could lose this case. We've already lost our daughter, Danny. Is... Is there any way I can find out if he was on that flight and when he's comin' back? It'd really, really help us. He'll be back the day after tomorrow, sir. Bless your heart. Go on. Go on in. Get down, Sam. Leigh, give me a cigarette. You better slow down. You're outpacing me -to- since you started smoking again. Just keep track of how many I owe you. How'd it go at the airport? We did our thing. But we don't know if he saw us. We don't know if he was there. Well, we'll set the trap and we'll see. - What if we don't wanna see? - Danny! What? Maybe he poisoned the dog. Sam, watch out for the windows! You're not allowed to stand up, Dad. Remember? Didn't Cady go after her? You don't know Danny. If she finds a palmetto bug in her bedroom, she takes it outside. She could never kill anything. Even a six-foot palmetto bug? Oh, God! What is that? It's monofilament line. Got it from Sam's fishing gear. What I do is stretch it across the windows and doors, and tie it to Danny's teddy bear. If the bear moves a quarter of an inch, I know if the holy ghost is sneakin' in. What are you reading? Why, did Kersek quit? No. It's just that Cady said... You want some answers. Me too. I'd like to know just how strong we are... or how weak. But I guess the only way we're gonna find that out... is just by going through this. Cady said to read the book between Esther and Psalms. Which is which one? The book of Job. Job was a good man. He believed in God. And God tested his faith. He took away everything he had, even his children. It's hideous, this plan. I mean, barbaric. They're crazy. My dad's turned into some kind of... I don't know what. Barbaric. Vamos, Danny. Ocúpate de tus propios asuntos, eh? Listen to your father. Do what they say. What else you can do? Leave. We could go to the houseboat and get lost in any inlet. Danny, come on. Don't stay outside. You wanna know... what really disturbs me? Is killing this guy. I mean, taking a man's life. I don't know if I can live with that. You may have to. Sam, just remember the plan. I know the plan. Damn, it's premeditated. It's, uh... It makes me an accomplice, an accessory, an abettor. It's also excessive force. The only thing excessive we could do to Cady... would be to gut him and eat his liver. Well, that might be excessive. Jesus Christ, Kersek. I'm serious. No, you're scared. But that's okay. I want you to savor that fear. The South evolved in fear;, fear of the Indian, fear of the slave, fear of the damn Union. The South has a fine tradition of savoring fear. What's the matter? Don't look! Don't look. She's making me nervous. What would she normally do... if Sam wasn't around to run her home? - She'd stay over. - Then she stays over. What? Leigh? I know how the dog died. - Sam, are you dreaming? - No. I just had the weirdest feeling he was already in the house. Can't sleep, huh, Miss Graciela? Yeah, it's hot. I think it's the humidity. That's what makes us so thirsty. Excuse me. You know, my pop was a cop... years. This was his favorite drink when he was on stakeout. I learnt that in prison. You like? White-trash piece of shit! Stay here, Leigh. Kersek? Kersek? Danny! Danny, go back to your room. Go back to your room. Lock the door. Kersek? Don't go down there, Sam. It's all right. Kersek? Sam! Don't look. Danny, don't look. Oh, my God, Graciela! Don't look. Don't look. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! It's the piano wire. Sam! Oh! I'm gonna get this son-of-a-bitch! Sam, no! No! No! No, Sam! Son-of-a-bitch! Tell him to stop! Sam, he might be out here! He might be out here! I've got Kersek's gun with me... and you're gonna find the piano wire that Cady used in the house. Yeah, I know how this looks. I know it. You're not supposed to flee a murder scene. Listen, Lieutenant, you may know this and you may not. In the law there's a thing called force majeure. It means an unforeseeable act of God. It cancels all promises and obligations. Legally speaking, all bets are off. You find Max Cady... and we'll come back. What did he say? He said we're fugitives. What does that mean? That means we're doing something right. Where's that old mongrel dog of yours, Mrs. Bowden? Tomorrow I'll catch some fish. You don't have to. I've got enough food to last us a week. Well... But it'd be nice. Good. It's only rain... a sheet of rain. What was that? Just a squall. I'll go check the anchor. Wait, Dad. Don't go out. Danielle, look. Everything is okay. We're on the river now. It's just a squall kickin'. Graciela has a brother. I mean, she had... had a brother. Oh, sweetie. We'll get in touch with him right away. Sam? We're making some tea. Sam! Dad? Can't hear you. It's windy out. What's that? Are we moving? Sam! Good evenin', ladies. My husband has a gun. - Not this gun. Is it this gun? - Where is he? Restin' up. Had a long, difficult day. Danielle, I told you, you can't escape your demons just by leaving home. I didn't. My parents brought me here. Of course. Where's Sexus? Back at the house. Shame. I had hoped we could read aloud from it together. Well... I, um... I memorized some for you. Did you? Yeah. Did you? Yeah. Well, I'm impressed. Which part? The part... You know what part. You know. Tsk, tsk, tsk. I don't think you did your homework. I did. What parts was that? The good parts? Yeah, they were... Were you a good girl? I was. I knew you'd follow me here. You know me pretty well, don't you, darlin'? Yeah, I do. You gonna get to know me a lot better too. No! Are you offering me somethin' hot? Let's get somethin' straight here. I spent years in an eight-by-nine cell, surrounded by people who were less than human. My mission at that time was to become more than human. You see? Grandaddy used to handle snakes in church. Granny drank strychnine. I guess you could say I had a leg up, genetically speakin'. I'm gonna forgive you, Danielle, honey. But I know that wasn't the real you, the true you. But I would like you to wait in the hold. Danielle? Danielle, get in the hold! Danielle. Stop! No! Oh, no! Ready to be born again, Mrs. Bowden? A few minutes alone with me, darlin'... and you'll be speakin' in tongues. Excuse me, Mrs. B. Please don't take umbrage, but in the plan I have formulated, there's much more to it than just you and I makin' love. I mean, that's just so commonplace and dreary. You will now have an opportunity. \"What is that opportunity?\" You ask. Why, here and now, we have an opportunity... to depict and dramatize... Oh, no! Both the heights and the depths... of a mama's true love of her daughter, if y'all get my meaning. C'mon out, babe. Let's go. Get out! Get up here. This is between you and me. Leave them out of it. This is my night, Counselor. Don't you step on my lines. Stop! Stop! Yes, Leigh? Listen to me, Max. Listen to me. You know, Max, since all this started, I've thought about you all the time. I've tried to imagine what it must have been like for you... all those years locked up in jail. I've tried to imagine you, and even your crimes, and how you must have felt in those moments that you did them. See... I know about laws, Max. I know about losing time, even losing years. And I know it doesn't compare to jail, but I can understand... and I could share this with you. Because of that, whatever it is that you've got planned, I want you to do it just with me, not with her. Because... we have this connection. What do you think, Counselor? No! That was real eloquent, Leigh. Brave too. I wanna thank you for conveying to me your very powerfullest emotions. 'Cause... I'm gonna enjoy this all the more. Oh, my God! The people call Samuel G. Bowden! Do you swear to tell the truth, so help you God? Somebody's got to man the boat. Did you swear? - I'll do it. - Sit, Danielle. Don't make light of your duty. You're the jury. I swear to tell the truth. What do you want to know? Was a prior sexual history ever prepared in connection with my defense? Was a prior sexual history ever prepared in connection with my defense? It's... I'm sorry, Your Honor. I agree. That was argumentative. An investigator did prepare a prior sexual history... on the alleged victim, true? I can ask leading questions. He is a hostile witness. Would you care to tell the court what the gist was of this report? It was years ago. I can't remember that. How can he answer when you're hitting him! 'Cause he's perjuring himself. He knows exactly what it said! Don't you? It said that she was promiscuous. It said that she had three lovers in one month. At least three! And did you show this report to the D.A.? - No. - No, I had to. I only discovered it after I petitioned to represent myself. Six years into my sentence! There it was in the court file! But back in ' you buried it! Would you care to tell the jury why? Would you care to tell the court why? Because I know he brutally raped her and beat her. Talk to me! I'm standing here! Just because she was promiscuous didn't give you the right to rape her. You bragged to me that you beat two prior aggravated rapes! You were a menace! You were my lawyer! That report could have saved me years! - You're probably right. - You self-righteous fuck! I'm Vergil and I'm guiding you through the gates of hell. We are now in the th Circle, the Circle of Traitors. Traitors to country! Traitors to fellow man! Traitors to God! You, sir... are charged with betrayin' the principles of all three! Quote for me the American Bar Association's Rules... of Professional Conduct, Canon Seven. \"A lawyer should represent his client... \" \"Should zealously represent his client within the bounds of the law. \" I find you guilty, Counselor! Guilty of betraying your fellow man! Guilty of betraying your country and abrogatin' your oath! Guilty ofjudging me and selling me out! With the power vested in me by the kingdom of God, I sentence you to the th Circle of hell! Now you will learn about loss! Loss of freedom! Loss of humanity! Now you and I will truly be the same. Get down on your knees. Both of you, take off your clothes. - Down on your knees now! - No, no, no! Take off your clothes! Down on you knees! No! Don't! Now... take off your clothes! You, Leigh. Take off your clothes. Now! Now! No, no, no. C'mon. Get it, get it! You're gonna learn to be an animal! To live like one and die like one. Give me your hand! No, Dad! Go! Go! Ahhh! Aaah! Forget about that restrainin' order, Counselor? You're well within yards! Well, here we are, Counselor. Just two lawyers... workin'it out! I'm gonna kill you! You already sacrificed me, Counselor! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Glory be to God. Hallelujah! # On Jordan's stormy banks I stand # # Oh, who will come with me # # I'm bound for the promised land I... # # I'm bound for the promis... # # Land, I am # # I'm bound for the promised land # We never spoke about what happened. At least, not to each other. Fear, I suppose... that to remember his name, or what he did, would mean letting him into our dreams. And me, I hardly dream about him anymore. Still, things won't ever be the way they were before he came. But that's all right. Because if you hang on to the past, you die a little every day. And for myself, I know I'd rather live. The end.\n\nSpecial help by SergeiK"
