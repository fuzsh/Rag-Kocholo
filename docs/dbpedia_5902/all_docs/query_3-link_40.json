        "text": "In her frank, illuminating and very entertaining memoir I Blame Dennis Hopper, the actor Illeana Douglas writes, “I’ll be at an airport with guards going though my bags, making sure I’m not a threat, and suddenly one of the TSA folks will look at me very earnestly and say, Can I ask you something? And I think it’s going to be about my illegally stashed weapon, or the pot brownie someone planted on me, and instead he or she will say, ‘Hey! What’s it like to get your face bitten off by Robert De Niro?'”\n\nDouglas can be light-hearted about it — although she discusses the process of the scene with revealing, serious candor as the chapter goes on. But the scene in 1991’s Cape Fear in which De Niro’s Max Cady — an ex-convict hell bent on revenge against the family-man lawyer who helped send him up the river 14 years prior — rapes and mutilates Douglas’ character, with whom Nick Nolte’s Sam Bowden has been having an affair, is the elephant in this movie’s room. Coming less than 40 minutes into a plump two-hours plus movie, it still has the power to shock. At the time of its release in 1991, it inspired the conservative pundit George Will to pontificate on the decadence of Hollywood (Will insisted on pronouncing the director’s name as “Score-seeze”) and Terrence Rafferty, then film critic for The New Yorker, pronounced the movie “a disgrace: an ugly, incoherent, dishonest piece of work.”\n\nI don’t agree, but I do consider Cape Fear, now on Netflix, one of the director’s more jarring —dare I say “problematic”?— films. The movie is a remake of a 1962 picture directed by J. Lee Thompson and starring Robert Mitchum as the sadistic, vengeance-driven convict Max Cady, Gregory Peck as beleaguered lawyer Sam Bowden, Polly Bergen as his wife and Lori Martin as their teen daughter. The movie was relatively daring for its era, but Scorsese’s film ups the ante in every conceivable way.\n\nIn part that’s due to the script by Wesley Strick, who delivered an expanded (and tricksy) version of the movie’s storyline — complete with villain-that-cannot-be-killed fripperies that include the near-superhuman Cady hitching a ride with the Bowdens by hanging on to their car’s undercarriage as they flee to their houseboat. The new version was supposed to have been directed by Steven Spielberg, which would be the first time he would work with star Robert De Niro. But it was then decided that De Niro would be better matched with his old collaborator Scorsese, with whom the actor had reunited with Goodfellas in 1990 after a long layoff.\n\nInheriting one of two roles that made Robert Mitchum such an iconic villain (the other, of course, being that of the murderous preacher Harry Powell in 1955’s The Night of the Hunter), De Niro trades in Mitchum’s laconic menace for something more variable and eccentric. Laying on an almost ridiculously thick cornpone accent, festooned with gnarly Biblical tattoos, De Niro’s Cady —giant stogie protruding from his maw as he laughs at your timid lying morality— often comes across like a kind of live-action cartoon. But as his character manipulates Bowden and his family, De Niro can turn on the psychological subtlety on at a moment’s notice, as in the legendarily icky scene in which, posing as a drama teacher, he very nearly seduces Juliette Lewis, stunning as the Bowdens’ daughter Danielle, in a squirm-inducing spider-and-the-fly pas de deux.\n\nThe marital arguments between Nolte’s Sam and Jessica Lange’s Leigh are Cassavetes-like in their unrelenting intensity. Even before the Cady threat makes itself known, these two are constantly pushing each other’s buttons. Rationalizing the daughter’s experimentation with marijuana, Lange’s Peggy provokes Nolte’s Sam to class it with other cultural taboos such as incest and necrophilia! The escalation is as unrelenting as the lying. Sam deceives his family, most of his colleagues, and law enforcement about his relationship to Cady, with the rationale that he’s protecting them, when in fact he’s being entirely self-serving. The varied ambiguities don’t want to hand the audience an easy rooting interest.\n\nThis Cape Fear is opposed to presenting itself as a genre thrill ride. There’s a sense in which the rape scene’s extreme brutality breaks a tacit contract with the audience; viewers who think they’ve signed up for a conventional studio thriller are likely to be repelled. Is Scorsese expressing a subconscious hostility to mainstream film, as well as to mainstream audiences, by including the explicit violence? It’s possible.\n\nBut Illeana Douglas implies the idea came more from De Niro: The tireless researcher had studied a number of crimes committed by fellows like his character, and that particular detail struck him as one that could contribute to the scene’s verisimilitude. And the followup is devastating, and still pertinent today: asked by Nolte’s character to testify against Cady, Douglas’ character, a lawyer herself, confesses her fears: “I know how it works, I see it every day — only this time I’m on the other side. I don’t want to explain why I was in a bar, and how much I had to drink, and what I was wearing…”\n\nStill, the movie’s mixed messages, the way it tries to balance the conventions of studio filmmaking of the moment and Scorsese’s own way of seeing things, do make it a confounding proposition to “what is the guy trying to say” types. Rafferty’s complaint of incoherence is not entirely legless, when you come down to it. Nevertheless, it’s a movie filled with charged moments, and if the finale is a boat ride too far, it makes Strick’s future hiring to reboot A Nightmare on Elm Street a kind of foregone conclusion.\n\nAnd that said, this Fear is not without its ostensibly fun components: Mitchum, Peck, and Martin Balsam (who played a cop in the first film) all show up in roles that are more than cameos, with Mitchum contributing one of the picture’s most memorable line reading with “Well, pardon me all over the place.”\n\nWe can let the director himself have the last word on this effort. Reflecting on the movie in the interview book Scorsese on Scorsese he said, “Ultimately, I doubt very much if I could make a true ‘B’ picture or ‘genre’ film.”\n\nVeteran critic Glenn Kenny reviews‎ new releases at RogerEbert.com , the New York Times, and, as befits someone of his advanced age, the AARP magazine. He blogs, very occasionally, at Some Came Running and tweets, mostly in jest, at @glenn__kenny."
