        "text": "Culture | Film\n\nMartin Scorsese’s longest films ranked, as latest movie will be ‘nearly four hours long’\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon could be the longest Scorsese epic of all\n\nMartin Scorsese, 80, is one of the most acclaimed film directors of all time\n\nGetty Images\n\nWilliam Mata4 April 2023\n\nMartin Scorsese’s films appear to be getting longer as the director, 80, ages — with his new movie reportedly having a run time of close to four hours.\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon will star Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro and Lily Gladstone, and is naturally one of the year’s most anticipated releases. The film will be released via AppleTV+ but it has not been confirmed if it will also be in cinemas.\n\nMovie, TV and celebrity content website IMDb says the plot revolves around members of the Osage tribe being murdered under mysterious circumstances in the 1920s. This sparked an FBI investigation involving the legendary J Edgar Hoover.\n\nAnd it will play out at some length with the run time reported, depending on sources, to be at least three hours and 20 minutes or up to four hours. If this is to be believed, it will be even longer than Scorsese’s other latter-day epics — which have regularly broken the three-hour barrier.\n\nHere are all of Marty’s films ranked in length, from numb bum to deep vein thrombosis.\n\nMartin Scorsese at the premiere for The Irishman, his longest film... so far\n\nPA Archive\n\nBoxcar Bertha (1972) - 1 hour 28 minutes\n\nHigh on violence, Scorsese’s second film was short on run time.\n\nWho’s That Knocking at My Door (1967) - 1 hour 30 minutes\n\nScorsese’s first film has an average run time and a short sprint by his standards to watch.\n\nAfter Hours (1985) - 1 hour 39 minutes\n\nA relatively short and simple comedy about a date gone wrong.\n\nThe King of Comedy (1982) - 1 hour 41 minutes\n\nThe follow-up to Taxi Driver has become a cult classic after disappointing box office returns at the time.\n\nMean Streets (1973) - 1 hour 52 minutes\n\nThe first of many Scorsese-De Niro collaborations is a gangster classic.\n\nAlice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore (1974) - 1 hour 52 minutes\n\nScorsese showed his more romantic side in this drama starring Ellen Burstyn and Kris Kristofferson.\n\nRobert De Niro: A frequent collaborator with Scorsese\n\nEvan Agostini/Invision/AP\n\nTaxi Driver (1976) - 1 hour 54 minutes\n\nThe classic story of Vietnam veteran turned taxi-driving vigilante Travis Bickle.\n\nThe Color of Money (1987) - 2 hours\n\nPaul Newman and Tom Cruise star in the sports drama.\n\nBringing out the Dead (1999) - 2 hours 1 minute\n\nThe Nicolas Cage collaboration is not one of Scorsese’s best known.\n\nHugo (2011) - 2 hours 1 minute\n\nThe only entry aimed at children, but not a short one.\n\nCape Fear (1991) - 2 hours 8 minutes\n\nThe remake that re-introduced the world to Max Cady.
