        "text": "Generally, I respect the law and think itâs a system thatâs largely fair and reasonable in affecting our daily lives. Yet, it is not at all inconceivable that breaking the law can be the morally right thing to do. It’s only a shame we canât hold our heads up when doing so; we have no choice but to hide â and whoever is on the other side has the upper hand. The reason I like Martin Scorseseâs Cape Fear so much as a remake of the 1962 original, is because of its advanced, morally complex plot thatâs in sync with a modern audience that needs more than a traditional âgood vs. evilâ film.\n\nSam Bowden (Nick Nolte) is a well-to-do lawyer defending Max Cady (Robert De Niro) who’s being tried for the rape and battery of a young woman. Being illiterate, Cady depends completely on Bowdenâs commitment to the law. When Sam sees the photos of the woman and the level of violence Cady inflicted on her, his morals come into conflict with his profession and he decides to hide evidence of the victimâs promiscuity in order to make sure Cadyâs sentence isnât reduced.\n\nThe young woman being promiscuous has no real connection to the crime itself â and connecting the two strongly suggests sexism against women in the criminal justice system. Bowden abandons his professional commitment to defend his client to the best of his abilities and Cady is essentially sent to prison by his own defence lawyer.\n\nFourteen years later Cady is released from prison. While locked up, he learned to read and write, studied law, and when he pays a quick visit to Bowden, he indicates heâs learned about him burying the evidence. Thus begins the Bowdenâs family nightmare with Cady subjecting them to persistent harassment that gets progressively worse and violent. Bowden has to fear not only for his own safety, but his unhappy wife Leigh (Jessica Lange) and his rebellious teenage daughter Danielle (Juliette Lewis).\n\nScorsese puts a strong emphasis on Cady becoming a born-again Christian in prison. Heâs exacting religious justice on the Bowden family, frequently quoting from the Bible and claiming he doesnât actually hate Sam Bowden â he prays for him. Only Martin Scorsese could confirm what he wanted to say with these character opposites; but morality from Christian texts is placed against an innate sense of justice in Cape Fear. Cady is portrayed as a solid character of absolute certainty while Sam Bowden is undoubtedly flawed and yet guided by his own personal instincts of right and wrong.\n\nAs a suspense-thriller, Cape Fear is a prime example in Scorseseâs work that he can trespass on Brian De Palma territory and deliver the goods. The camera movement conveys tension constantly by almost nervously moving from face to hand, from hand to door handle â and who knows whatâs behind the door?\n\nThe cinematography is stylish and vivid throughout; De Niro sitting on the garden wall of the Bowden family with the intense 4th of July fireworks in the background is just one of the memorable over-the-top scenes in the film. The characters are gritty and realistic, as opposed to the perfect image of the nuclear family in the original; Juliette Lewis is especially superb as Danielle, whose difficult relationship with her father makes her dangerously receptive to Cadyâs grooming.\n\nThereâs plenty of subtext to unpack in Cape Fear. The subject of religion plays a role throughout; Max Cady appears to possess super-human abilities at times, and prior to the last confrontation, Bowden talks about the âforce majeureâ defence, which in law is defined as an unforeseeable act of God."
