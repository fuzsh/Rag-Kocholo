        "text": "My reminiscence.\n\nI always thought\n\nthat for such a lovely river...\n\n...the name was mystifying:\n\nCape Fear.\n\nWhen the only thing to fear\n\non those enchanted summer nights...\n\n...was that the magic would end\n\nand real life would come crashing in.\n\nOkay, Cady, the moment\n\nyou've been waiting for.\n\nAny people coming for you, Cady?\n\n- What about your books?\n\n- Already read them.\n\nHi. How are you?\n\n- ?Cmo ests?\n\n- Bien.\n\nThis ropa limpia?\n\nNo, that means \"clean. \" These are dirty.\n\nThe idea is to resolve the tension.\n\nI need to find a motif\n\nthat's about movement.\n\nNot the most mind-blowing concept\n\nfor a travel agency...\n\n...but what the hey?\n\n- Like an arrow, maybe?\n\n- Yeah, like an arrow.\n\nMaybe.\n\nBut, see, then the other aspect\n\nis stability...\n\n...a company that you can trust.\n\nSo if you can balance those ideas...\n\n...in a way that's pleasing to the eye\n\nthen you got a logo.\n\nOkay:\n\nMovement, stability...\n\n...and an arrow.\n\nOkay, I'll think of something for that one.\n\nBenjamin! Yes.\n\nThey switched babies on me\n\nat the hospital, didn't they?\n\nHow'd you do in there?\n\nI got the judge to postpone\n\nthe alimony hearing for another 21 days.\n\nGreat.\n\nI've got till Monday to find out\n\nwhich S and L and which municipality...\n\n- ... my son-in-law stashed all that money.\n\n- Right.\n\n- Anyway, my daughter and I thank you.\n\n- You're welcome, Tom.\n\nHere's Daddyl\n\nGood-bye, Juniorl\n\n!Adios!\n\nYes, that's very creative, Junior.\n\nHe liked me.\n\nAll this time, he actually liked me.\n\nYou can't go in. Your father's making\n\na television appearance for his campaign.\n\nDad, I've got to talk to you.\n\nWhat the hell are you doing here?\n\nI'm about to go on the air.\n\nWhat is this smoke?\n\nExcuse me.\n\nCome on, let's move seats.\n\nOkay, then I quit as yourson.\n\nDo you believe that annoying loser guy?\n\nYou should have just punched him out.\n\nWhat? Just punched him out?\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nYou boxed. You could've\n\nshoved him around, shut him up.\n\n- I could take you.\n\n- Careful.\n\n- That's who I could take.\n\n- You could've kicked him in the face.\n\nKicked him in the face?\n\nYou know how to fight dirty.\n\nYou do that for a living.\n\nReal cute, Leigh.\n\n- Let's sit outside.\n\n- How much do I owe you?\n\n- It's taken care of.\n\n- Taken care of? Who?\n\nThere.\n\nGirls, come on, let's sit inside.\n\nYeah, let's sit inside.\n\nMr. Perfect Form.\n\n- Look.\n\n- What?\n\nYou gotta snap your wrist\n\non the backhand.\n\nUsually I like a little music\n\nat this point, Sam.\n\nSam, I want to play in this lifetime.\n\nAll right.\n\n- You gotta snap your wrist.\n\n- Tag.\n\n- We should stop doing this for a while.\n\n- Doing what? We're not doing anything.\n\n- No, I know that.\n\n- Yet.\n\nOkay. Fine. Maybe you're right.\n\nWhy? Does your wife mind?\n\nMy wife doesn't even know you exist,\n\nwhich, most certainly, is for the best.\n\nWhy's that?\n\nGod, Lori, you know why you ask\n\nthat question?\n\n- 'Cause you've never been married.\n\n- Why?\n\nIs marriage synonymous with deception?\n\nIt's just that when two people...\n\n...get married and live together\n\nfor a long time...\n\nI like hanging out with you, so sue me.\n\nYou're funny, and you're cute,\n\nand, I don't know...\n\nWe talk about the courts\n\nand which judge is senile...\n\n...which one wears a gun under his robe.\n\nOh, God. You know, Lori,\n\nanother time, another place...\n\n...and who knows?\n\n- Tomorrow?\n\n- Yeah, it's a light docket.\n\nNo, I won two out of three.\n\nLet's make it best out of five.\n\nAll right, that's good, actually,\n\nbecause today I let you win.\n\n- Sure you did.\n\n- See ya.\n\nFree as a bird. You go wherever you want\n\nwith whomever.\n\nThat much freedom\n\ncould get a fellow in trouble.\n\n- I'd like my keys.\n\n- Could it be you don't remember me?\n\nI remember you.\n\nYou were at the movies the other night.\n\nI'm disappointed. I'm hurt.\n\nI would like my keys.\n\nMax Cady.\n\nYou look the same.\n\nMaybe 15 pounds heavier.\n\nBut they say the average man\n\ngains a pound a year till he's about-\n\nCome on.\n\nGains a pound a year till he's about 60.\n\nMe? I dropped a pound every year\n\nin my sentence.\n\n- Atlanta, '77.\n\n- You got it. July.\n\nFourteen years since I held a set of keys.\n\nWell, you look good, healthy.\n\nThank you. It's a struggle\n\nto stay healthy in the joint.\n\nBut you wouldn't know about that,\n\nwould you?\n\nThey would stick you with\n\nthe white trash. They don't work all day.\n\nIn fact...\n\n...this little old cigar is my only vice...\n\n...'cause I needed a vice in the joint\n\nto remind me I was human.\n\nWhat brings you to New Essex?\n\nOh, the climate.\n\nBoy, the South.\n\nI'm thinking of settling down here\n\nin New Essex, Counselor.\n\nHave you been following me?\n\nIt's a small town.\n\nWe're gonna run into each other.\n\n- Well, take care, Mr. Cady.\n\n- You, too.\n\n- You're gonna learn about loss.\n\n- What?\n\nDad, could you...\n\nI'm sorry, Dani.\n\n- What're you working on?\n\n- It's English.\n\nWe're supposed to read\n\nLook Homeward, Angel...\n\n...which is a kind of reminiscence...\n\n...and we have to attempt something\n\nin the same style.\n\nWhat's it about, your reminiscence?\n\nThe houseboat.\n\nIt's not even July 3 yet.\n\nWe ought to take two weeks\n\nand go to Wilmington...\n\n...like the old times, dock the houseboat.\n\nI wanted to in early June.\n\nYou said you didn't have time.\n\n- I probably don't.\n\n- Yeah, now I don't, either.\n\nBesides, Dani's got summer school\n\ntill Labor Day.\n\nIs it really that critical\n\nthat she can't miss two damn weeks?\n\nYou know,\n\nthe alternative was to expel her.\n\nMaybe this Drama teacher from the college\n\nwill get her excited about something.\n\nYeah, about him, probably.\n\nWhy'd they have to make such a stink,\n\nlike she was on heroin, or something?\n\nI mean, what's marijuana?\n\nYou and I smoked a little dope in our time.\n\nIn some cultures,\n\nit's considered almost a sacrament.\n\nI realize in ours it's forbidden.\n\nRight up there with incest\n\nand necrophilia and bestiality.\n\nHoney.\n\n- Worship of idols, cannibalism.\n\n- Do that again.\n\n- What?\n\n- Do that again.\n\n- Sam, somebody's out there!\n\n- What?\n\nLeave the light off. Leave it off.\n\nI saw him when the fireworks went off.\n\nWhat?\n\n- I think I talked to him this afternoon.\n\n- You know him?\n\nI want you the hell off my property!\n\nHe's gone.\n\nHe said,\n\n\"I'm gonna make you think about loss. \"\n\nOr, \"I'm gonna make you learn about loss. \"\n\nSomething like that.\n\nThat's very poetic.\n\n- Who is he? Where did he come from?\n\n- He's from...\n\nCome on, Leigh, get the dog off.\n\nBen, get down.\n\nHe doesn't mind me at all.\n\nIt's your dog. Come on.\n\nNo, he shouldn't be up on the table.\n\n- You'll have dog hairs in the tea.\n\n- Get down.\n\nWhere's he from?\n\nHe's from the hills, Pentecostal crackers.\n\nWhat was he in prison for?\n\n- I think it was battery.\n\n- You think it was battery?\n\n- Who did he batter? A man? A woman?\n\n- I don't know.\n\nIt was fourteen years ago.\n\nYou know, it's kind of...\n\nI really don't remember.\n\nWhat does he want with you?\n\nHe's just trying to bug us,\n\njust messing around.\n\nHe's an ex-con, so he's just...\n\nYou know, he's probably upset\n\nat the lawyer.\n\n- Yeah, your clientele.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- 'Bye, Dad.\n\n- 'Bye, Dani.\n\n- You look tired."
