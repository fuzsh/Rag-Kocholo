        "text": "The Avenue Entertainment Robert De Niro may be the quintessential American movie star. His performances are intimately evocative and span different genres, proving him quite the virtuoso actor. He’s played iconic American gangsters like Al Capone and Vito Corleone, embodying the criminal persona as a symbol of power and corruption with an undeniable allure. De Niro’s characters often hold such dynamic tension: as Max Cady in “Cape Fear,” audiences found him at once chilling and captivating. As the small-town steelworker-turned-soldier in “The Deer Hunter,” he captured extremes of both courage and dread. His characters embody a strong sense of authentic humanity even in roles where De Niro is an “average” man–from the football-obsessed father in “Silver Linings Playbook” to the married man falling for Meryl Streep in the romance “Falling in Love.” Heralded for his immersive, intensive acting style, De Niro studied under the wing of famed acting teachers Stella Adler and Lee Strasberg and learned the “method” of immersing himself in his characters entirely. He’s altered his appearance by gaining and losing weight and even paid thousands to have his teeth sharpened for “Cape Fear.” He’s mastered languages and the talents of his characters, such as the Sicilian dialect of Corleone, the skills of the saxophone player in “New York, New York,” and the methods of actual bounty hunters for “Midnight Run.” A recipient of the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award for Lifetime Achievement, De Niro has garnered seven Academy Award nominations throughout his career, winning Best Supporting Actor (“The Godfather: Part II”) and Best Actor (“Raging Bull”). He frequently collaborates with director Martin Scorsese; they worked together on nine films, creating iconic characters like the unhinged Travis Bickle from “Taxi Driver” and the gangster Jimmy from “Goodfellas.” To find out which of De Niro’s films stands out among the rest, Stacker found the top 50 Robert De Niro movies based on IMDb user ratings. Feature films and TV movies in which he had an acting role were considered. Cameo appearances, voice-over roles in documentaries, and films that have yet to be released to the public were not considered. Among the top 50, De Niro frequently represents the spirit of the American gangster, but as this list shows, he also shines in more minor roles and comedic turns, demonstrating his vast range.

Killer Elite (2011) Omnilab Media – Director: Gary McKendry – IMDb user rating: 6.4 – Metascore: 44 – Runtime: 116 minutes As the co-star in this Jason Statham action vehicle, De Niro plays Hunter, a lifelong mercenary pulled back into a tangle of murder and its necessary getaways. Hunter is the wizened mentor to the younger agent, and like most heroes in such thrillers, he finds it hard to escape a life of special ops and violence. De Niro makes a spry actioner despite playing the elder operative. #49. Guilty by Suspicion (1991) Warner Bros. – Director: Irwin Winkler – IMDb user rating: 6.5 – Metascore: 64 – Runtime: 105 minutes This drama depicts the hearings of the House Un-American Activities Committee during McCarthyism and the Red Scare of the 1950s. Here, De Niro plays a blacklisted Hollywood film director who must name his friends and colleagues or suffer the consequences. De Niro brings a sense of righteousness to the role of a man faced with doing the right thing under pressure. #48.

New York, New York (1977) Chartoff-Winkler Productions – Director: Martin Scorsese – IMDb user rating: 6.6 – Metascore: 64 – Runtime: 155 minutes In his third collaboration with director Martin Scorsese, De Niro stars as a saxophone player who falls in love with a nightclub singer (Liza Minnelli) in 1945 in the Big Apple. The film was a box-office disappointment that failed to live up to the hype of “Taxi Driver,” released the year before. Nonetheless, De Niro’s performance is sure-footed and charming.

Last Vegas (2013) CBS Films – Director: Jon Turteltaub – IMDb user rating: 6.6 – Metascore: 48 – Runtime: 105 minutes De Niro leans into his role as a cranky widower on a jaunt to Vegas with his childhood pals, still friends as senior citizens. The stellar ensemble also stars powerhouses Kevin Kline, Michael Douglas, and Morgan Freeman as men in need of some comedic adventure. Old-age gags give the romp a presentation of confident, elderly masculinity. #44. Joy (2015) Fox 2000 Pictures – Director: David O. Russell – IMDb user rating: 6.6 – Metascore: 56 – Runtime: 124 minutes “Joy” brings together the actors and director of “Silver Linings Playbook,” but without the same captivating sublimity of the previous hit. David O. Russell directs De Niro again, this time as the father of a mop inventor (Jennifer Lawrence) with Bradley Cooper co-starring as the executive who gives her a chance.

Adapted from a stage play, “Marvin’s Room” is filled with scenery-chewing emotional scenes between the fighting sisters and Leonardo DiCaprio as Streep’s mentally ill son. As the doctor who diagnoses a devastating illness, De Niro offers charm and humanity in a role that departs from his gangster persona. #41. Backdraft (1991) Imagine Films Entertainment – Director: Ron Howard – IMDb user rating: 6.7 – Metascore: 38 – Runtime: 137 minutes This melodrama poses fire as a kind of antagonist character out to challenge the cast of firefighters that include Kurt Russell, Scott Glenn, and William Baldwin. De Niro plays a fire expert, a man who knows the intricate ins and outs of fire science and forensics. He understands the force as a worthy foe with a soul for destruction. De Niro delivers the line, “[Fire] is a living thing. … It breathes, it eats, and it hates,” with dramatic gravitas. You may also like: 100 best international movies of all time #40.

Billy Crystal stars as the straight-man shrink who counters De Niro’s schtick. #38. Bang the Drum Slowly (1973) ANJS – Director: John D. Hancock – IMDb user rating: 6.8 – Metascore: 80 – Runtime: 96 minutes Adapted from a classic novel, this tear-jerker was De Niro’s first major film role and catapulted him to prominence as an actor of inimitable force. De Niro stars as a baseball player with Hodgkin’s disease. His teammate (Michael Moriarty) won’t let the team release his friend, despite his limitations. De Niro shines as the doomed ballplayer. #37. Great Expectations (1998) Art Linson Productions – Director: Alfonso Cuarón – IMDb user rating: 6.8 – Metascore: 55 – Runtime: 111 minutes This stylized adaptation of the classic Charles Dickens novel sets the action in contemporary New York instead of 19th-century London. De Niro plays the mysterious and brutal convict whom the hero, Finn (Ethan Hawke), helps out when he’s a child. Later, the convict returns an icon of both benevolence and corruption, two traits perfectly captured in De Niro’s performance. #36. The Score (2001) Paramount Pictures – Director: Frank Oz – IMDb user rating: 6.8 – Metascore: 71 – Runtime: 124 minutes “The Score” centers on another “one-final-heist” scenario with De Niro as an older criminal ready to retire after a big job. Edward Norton plays the young upstart who thinks he can outwit the older robber. Notably, Marlon Brando stars in a small role as a black marketeer for stolen goods. It was Brando’s final film and brought together the two acting legends who played Vito Corleone in the “Godfather” franchise. You may also like: 50 best WWII movies of all time #35. Cop Land (1997) Miramax – Director: James Mangold – IMDb user rating: 7.0 – Metascore: 64 – Runtime: 105 minutes De Niro sports a mustache and a desk-jockey outfit as Moe Tilden, the internal affairs investigator probing a town of corrupt cops. De Niro’s character acts as the moral center for the others (an ensemble comprised of Sylvester Stallone, Harvey Keitel, Ray Liotta, and Robert Patrick) in this acclaimed neo-noir about uncovering malfeasance. #34. Meet the Parents (2000) Universal Pictures – Director: Jay Roach – IMDb user rating: 7.0 – Metascore: 73 – Runtime: 108 minutes In this box-office smash, De Niro puts his persona as a hardwired wise guy to hilarious comic effect when his usual bruiser type goes up against his daughter’s hapless fiance, Greg. Ben Stiller plays Greg as the perfect foil for De Niro’s Jack, a former CIA operative determined to run his future son-in-law through the wringer. #33. Everybody’s Fine (2009) Miramax – Director: Kirk Jones – IMDb user rating: 7.1 – Metascore: 47 – Runtime: 99 minutes Proving he’s an actor adept at any genre, De Niro plays a widowed father in this Christmas dramedy. De Niro’s Frank takes a cross-country trip to visit each of his children after they cancel on him right before the holidays. De Niro’s heartfelt performance was considered the highlight of this film with a tepid critical response and disappointing box office. #32.

Mean Streets (1973) Warner Bros. – Director: Martin Scorsese – IMDb user rating: 7.2 – Metascore: 96 – Runtime: 112 minutes “Mean Streets” marked the beginning of the collaboration between De Niro and director Martin Scorsese in a stylish film that matches cinematic flourish with gritty realism.

De Niro plays Max Cady, a man set on terrorizing the defense attorney (Nick Nolte) who had him sent to prison.

True to his craft, the actor even went as far as to spend $5,000 to have a dentist “ground down” his teeth for the character. #23. The Mission (1986) Warner Bros. – Director: Roland Joffé – IMDb user rating: 7.4 – Metascore: 55 – Runtime: 125 minutes This action-adventure set in 1750s Spain follows a missionary (Jeremy Irons) who tries to convert Indigenous Paraguayans to Christianity.

Midnight Run (1988) Universal Pictures – Director: Martin Brest – IMDb user rating: 7.5 – Metascore: 78 – Runtime: 126 minutes In this box-office hit, De Niro teams up with Charles Grodin in a buddy comedy about a bounty hunter tasked with delivering an accountant.

Sleepers (1996) Astoria Films – Director: Barry Levinson – IMDb user rating: 7.5 – Metascore: 49 – Runtime: 147 minutes He may be playing the priest Father Bobby in “Sleepers,” but De Niro brings his signature tough-guy swagger.

Jackie Brown (1997) Miramax – Director: Quentin Tarantino – IMDb user rating: 7.5 – Metascore: 64 – Runtime: 154 minutes In Quentin Tarantino’s third film, adapted from an Elmore Leonard novel, De Niro is cast against type. He’s still a gangster, but in this story, he’s a criminal character without the confidence and finesse of the gangsters he usually plays. He’s still a cold-hearted ex-con, but one without his usual charisma. #18. Stardust (2007) Paramount Pictures – Director: Matthew Vaughn – IMDb user rating: 7.6 – Metascore: 66 – Runtime: 127 minutes In a gender-bending turn with a touch of the whimsical, De Niro plays Captain Shakespeare in this Neil Gaiman fantasy about a lad who promises to retrieve a fallen star who happens to be a woman.

Russell – IMDb user rating: 7.7 – Metascore: 81 – Runtime: 122 minutes As the football-obsessed dad of a grown man with bipolar disorder (Bradley Cooper), De Niro steals each scene in which he appears.

The King of Comedy (1982) Embassy International Pictures – Director: Martin Scorsese – IMDb user rating: 7.8 – Metascore: 73 – Runtime: 109 minutes After the success of “Raging Bull,” director Martin Scorsese collaborated again with De Niro in this dark comedy that garnered a tepid box-office response (perhaps due to its misunderstood satire), despite resonating with critics. De Niro plays another psychopath, Rupert, who is not unlike the damaged men he played in “Taxi Driver” and “Raging Bull.” Rupert kidnaps a famous talk-show host, Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis, who reportedly received the role over Johnny Carson), to get a spot on the show. #14. Awakenings (1990) Columbia Pictures – Director: Penny Marshall – IMDb user rating: 7.8 – Metascore: 74 – Runtime: 121 minutes De Niro was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for his sensitive and immersive portrayal of a man “awakened” from a catatonic state by an experimental drug.

The two actors also collaborated on the screenplay adapted from a one-man stage play written and performed by Palminteri. #12. The Irishman (2019) Tribeca Productions – Director: Martin Scorsese – IMDb user rating: 7.8 – Metascore: 94 – Runtime: 209 minutes In this Martin Scorsese-directed flick, adapted from Charles Brandt’s nonfiction book “I Heard You Paint Houses,” truck driver Frank Sheeran (De Niro) becomes involved with Russell Bufalino’s (Joe Pesci) Pennsylvania family and entrenched in crime. The story follows Sheeran’s life as an army veteran in World War II through his rise as a powerful crime member for the Bufalino family and for teamster Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). Brandt’s book title was later changed to match the movie’s name. #11. Brazil (1985) Embassy International Pictures – Director: Terry Gilliam – IMDb user rating: 7.9 – Metascore: 84 – Runtime: 132 minutes Here, De Niro plays repairman Harry Tuttle in Terry Gilliam’s surrealist reverie about the bureaucratic nightmares of a future world. De Niro infuses the smaller part of Harry with an absurdist intensity in a comedic turn enhanced by the character’s strange tools, bizarre eyewear, and taste for insurrection.

The Untouchables (1987) Paramount Pictures – Director: Brian De Palma – IMDb user rating: 7.9 – Metascore: 79 – Runtime: 119 minutes De Niro gained weight to play the infamous and pugnacious gangster Al Capone in “The Untouchables,” a film that aestheticizes violent crime in its opulent style. “You’re nothin’ but a lot of talk and badge,” De Niro’s Capone repeats over and over in the scene where he’s finally brought down by Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner). #9. The Deer Hunter (1978) EMI Films – Director: Michael Cimino – IMDb user rating: 8.1 – Metascore: 86 – Runtime: 183 minutes De Niro stars as Mike, a Pennsylvanian steelworker shipped off to war, in this meditation on the lasting effects of combat for the Vietnam generation.

De Niro portrays Mike’s intense grit in the infamous scene where they’re forced to play Russian roulette against each other. #8. Raging Bull (1980) Chartoff-Winkler Productions – Director: Martin Scorsese – IMDb user rating: 8.2 – Metascore: 89 – Runtime: 129 minutes De Niro won the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of boxer Jake LaMotta in his fourth film with director Martin Scorsese, while Joe Pesci plays Jake’s brother, Joey. De Niro’s iconic performance displays his method genius as he embodies the eruptive rage and bitter loneliness of the real-life middleweight champ. #7. Casino (1995) Universal Pictures – Director: Martin Scorsese – IMDb user rating: 8.2 – Metascore: 73 – Runtime: 178 minutes De Niro teams up again with “Goodfellas” director Martin Scorsese and co-star Joe Pesci in this epic drama about gangsters in Las Vegas.

Taxi Driver (1976) Columbia Pictures – Director: Martin Scorsese – IMDb user rating: 8.2 – Metascore: 94 – Runtime: 114 minutes “You talkin’ to me?” De Niro says the iconic line into a mirror while practicing pulling a gun on various “screwheads” and “scum.” He plays Travis Bickle, a paranoid veteran consumed with saving a child prostitute and assassinating a political candidate.

Like all male heroes of the noir genre, McCauley can’t escape his innate corruption–though a life of love lived abroad beckons him. Al Pacino stars as the cop determined to bring him down. When their characters meet in a coffee shop, the actors give a master class on the simmering pleasures of high-stakes stress as they discuss “heat.” #3. Joker (2019) Warner Bros. – Director: Todd Phillips – IMDb user rating: 8.4 – Metascore: 59 – Runtime: 122 minutes In “Joker,” De Niro’s Murray Franklin is the legendary talk-show host on Gotham’s “Live! With Murray Franklin.” Franklin pays homage to his role as Rupert Pupkin from the ’80s flick “The King of Comedy.” A not-so-funny routine of Arthur (Joaquin Phoenix) grabs Franklin’s attention, prompting him to invite Arthur to appear on his show. Franklin is completely unaware that Arthur is battling inner turmoil and is in an unhinged state due to his lack of success as a stand-up comedian. Arthur then admits to murdering three Wayne Enterprises executives on a subway train, yet, instead of stopping the televised program, Murray attempts to provide some guidance to the troubled comedian who lashes out in a way that leaves watchers in horror than laughter. #2. Goodfellas (1990) Warner Bros. – Director: Martin Scorsese – IMDb user rating: 8.7 – Metascore: 90 – Runtime: 145 minutes In another of his collaborations with Scorsese, De Niro plays Jimmy in this film that spans 35 years in the lives of mobsters, inhabiting his confident, casual malevolence. When the gang starts to fall apart, the audience shares the character’s suspicions about whether they can trust Jimmy or not. De Niro gives a masterful portrayal of a deceptive, fearless wise guy. #1. The Godfather: Part II (1974) Paramount Pictures – Director: Francis Ford Coppola – IMDb user rating: 9.0 – Metascore: 90 – Runtime: 202 minutes De Niro auditioned to play hotheaded Sonny Corleone in “The Godfather,” the oldest son of the mafioso Vito, but the role went to James Caan. The loss of that role left the actor open to play young Vito in the franchise’s second installment–a sequel considered as good as, or better than, the first film. He won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for the role, sharing with Marlon Brando the distinction of being the only two actors to win Oscars for playing the same character.
