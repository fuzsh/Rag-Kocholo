        "text": "By 1991, Martin Scorsese was the most distinctive and talented film-maker working at the peak of his powers but had still never quite had the mega-hit which would give him the Hollywood clout to go along with his abilities.\n\nAs a payback to Universal for supporting his tricky Last Temptation of Christ project, Scorsese unashamedly applied himself to a big-scale quickie thriller, built on the skeleton of the well-remembered 1962 suspense thriller. Scorsese enters into the spirit of the thing, reusing Bernard Herrmann's score to melodramatic effect, calling upon Saul Bass for a suitably ominous credit sequence, and respectfully casting the stars of the earlier film (Robert Mitchum, Gregory Peck, Martin Balsam) in telling cameos.\n\nNolte and DeNiro are superb as the antagonists, a compromised lawyer and a self‑educated white trash supervillain, and Juliette Lewis and Jessica Lange are outstanding as Nolte's imperilled family.\n\nThe first hour presents a quietly scary logic as Max, barely breaking the law, reduces Sam's life to shreds. However Scorsese abandons subtlety with an all‑stops‑out gothic finale in a swamp that finally answers the question of what a Friday The 13th movie would look like starring and directed by Academy Award nominees.\n\nThe suspense rises in a crescendo as the demented Cady - certainly the most loathsome character DeNiro has ever played - invades the Bowden houseboat during a storm, finally transformed into a Freddy-faced monster as he is burned and battered but keeps crawling out of the waters to attack again, and finally dragged under while speaking in tongues."
