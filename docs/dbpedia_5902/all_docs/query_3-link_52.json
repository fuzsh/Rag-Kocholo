        "text": "A COLD-BLOODED, calculated build-up of sadistic menace and shivering dread is accomplished with frightening adroitness in J. Lee Thompson's melodrama \"Cape Fear,\" which clubbed its way into the Victoria and the Trans-Lux Eighty-fifth Street yesterday. And the word on it is: don't take the children. If you want to be horrified, that's your business. But don't expose the youngsters to the ordeal of watching this film.And an ordeal it is, from the moment that Robert Mitchum as a bird just out of jail shoves his big, ugly face in the window of the automobile of Gregory Peck and informs him, a well-regarded lawyer, that he is going to get even with him for having been put in jail. It seems Mr. Peck was the key witness against Mr. Mitchum for a criminal assault.From that moment on until the climax, when the two antagonists fight and flail in the murky waters of the Cape Fear River, trying to split each other's skull or hold the other under water until he gurgles and drowns, it is a long-drawn succession of brute harassments of the lawyer, his wife and little girl by this diabolic ex-convict who seems just on the edge of being insane.The scoundrel first prowls around their residence, he slyly poisons their dog and makes obscene insinuations that he means to ravish the child. As an indication of his intention, he does just that to a cheap barroom girl who makes the mistake of dating him and taking him to her room.The police can do nothing to stop him or divert the harassment campaign. James R. Webb, who wrote the screen play from a novel by John D. MacDonald, has seen to that. They have no real case against the vagrant (who has plenty of money in the bank), and the girl he molests is too frightened to press a charge against him. So it's just a matter of Mr. Peck and his family sweating out the increasing war of nerves until that final, perilous, agonizing showdown in the lonely, dismal waters of the Cape Fear.Technically, it's a good job. Mr. Webb has prepared a tough, tight script and Mr. Thompson has directed in a steady and starkly sinister style. There is no waste motion, no fooling. Everything is sharp and direct. Menace quivers in the picture like a sneaky electrical charge. And Mr. Mitchum plays the villain with the cheekiest, wickedest arrogance and the most relentless aura of sadism that he has ever managed to generate.Mr. Peck is taut and tenacious, Polly Bergen is jittery as his wife and Lori Martin does some admirable racing through a couple of real displays of screaming terror as the child. Martin Balsam as a tough police official, Barrie Chase as the barroom girl and Jack Kruschen as a Philadelphia lawyer for the villain are terse and colorful.But this is really one of those shockers that provokes disgust and regret. There seems to be no reason for it but to agitate anguish and a violent, vengeful urge that is offered some animal satisfaction by that murderous fight at the end.\n\nThe CastCAPE FEAR, screen play by James R. Webb, based on the novel \"The Executioners,\" by John D. MacDonald; directed by J. Lee Thompson and produced by Sy Bartlett for Universal-International.
