        "text": "“Counselor! Come out, come out, wherever you are!”\n\nJoin us on Thursday, August 17 for a double feature that celebrates actor Robert De Niro (on his birthday!) and includes two of our favourite performances from his many collaborations with filmmaker Martin Scorsese – TAXI DRIVER and CAPE FEAR.\n\nWith 1991’s CAPE FEAR, master filmmaker Martin Scorsese did something he wasn’t really known for – crafting a wickedly pulpy remake. Originally released in 1962, J. Lee Thompson‘s white knuckle neo-noir CAPE FEAR starred Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum, the story of an attorney (Peck) being stalked by a vengeful former client (Mitchum). Some 30 years later, Scorsese’s version ups the cinematic camp, horror, and violence with his muse De Niro taking centre stage as the chilling psychopathic ex-con Cady to Nick Nolte’s legal counselor, Bowden.\n\nWhen attorney Sam Bowden (Nolte) knowingly withholds evidence that would acquit violent sex offender Max Cady (De Niro) of rape charges, Max spends 14 years in prison. But after Max’s release, knowing about Sam’s deceit, he devotes his life to stalking and destroying the Bowden family. When practical attempts to stop Max fail, Sam realizes that he must act outside the law to protect his wife and daughter in Martin Scorsese’s remake of the classic 1962 thriller. With Jessica Lange, Juliette Lewis, Illeana Douglas, Robert Mitchum, Gregory Peck.\n\n“Stay away if you’re squeamish but, if you do, you’ll miss an essential work by one of our masters, as well as two of the year’s most accomplished performances, those of Mr. De Niro and Ms. Lewis.” (New York Times)\n\n“(De Niro) had played a tough guy before, but never quite like this: a very sinister, very jagged, very dangerous character… put that together with Martin Scorsese at possibly the peak of his powers, and it’s a delightful if slightly scary film.” (BBC.com)\n\n“Martin Scorsese wasn’t supposed to remake the 1962 thriller, but when he did, he brought along his longtime muse and infused the story with an overwhelming amount of trademark chaos…” (The Ringer)\n\n“Ever shot reminds you that a consummate artist is having a great time remaking a kinky minor classic.” (Boston Phoenix)\n\nThursday, August 17\n\nMovie 9:15 pm *As this film is screening as part of a double feature, this is an approximate start time. Please arrive on time.\n\nAdvance tickets HERE\n\nWhy not make it a De Niro Double Bill with TAXI DRIVER pm for one sweet price HERE\n\nCAPE FEAR (Marin Scorsese, 1991 / 18A / 128 mins) A convicted rapist, released from prison after serving a fourteen-year sentence, stalks the family of the lawyer who originally defended him."
