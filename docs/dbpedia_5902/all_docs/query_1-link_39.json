        "text": "Reviewed by Colin Jacobson (June 4, 2024)\n\nWith 1962âs Cape Fear, we get a thriller that paired Hollywood legends Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum. Max Cady (Mitchum) serves eight years for rape and emerges from prison.\n\nFirst item on Cadyâs agenda? Track down Sam Bowden (Peck), the lawyer he holds responsible for his incarceration.\n\nCady slowly insinuates himself into Samâs world, with an emphasis on teen daughter Nancy (Lori Martin). The ex-con determines to make the attorneyâs life miserable as revenge for his imprisonment.\n\nGoing into a 2017 screening of Fear, I didnât recall if I ever saw it previously. Like many, I took in the 1991 remake from Martin Scorsese, but I canât remember if I ever went back and gave the 1962 original a shot.\n\nIâm guessing I didnât, partly because I didnât much like the Scorsese version. I plan to reappraise that film, but my initial 1991 screening left me unimpressed and unlikely to seek out the original.\n\nThough Iâve not seen the 1991 version for years, I remember one prominent negative: Robert De Niroâs scenery-chewing turn as Cady. Iâm happy to see that Mitchum does much better here, as he creates a substantially more believable villain.\n\nAs I recall, De Niro went so broad as Cady that he created a laughable caricature, whereas Mitchum makes the part more real. Mitchum gives Cady the oily charm, intelligence and charisma he needs for aspects of the tale.\n\nHe delivers the threat and darkness required as well. Mitchum creates an antagonist with depth and cruelty who also feels wholly realistic â and that makes him even scarier.\n\nPeck gets the less interesting part but he does fine. The actor spent 1962 in attorney roles, as he also starred in To Kill a Mockingbird that year.\n\nPeckâs work as Bowden shows some shades of Atticus Finch, but he broadens for Fear. While Bowden allows Peck some of the nobility found in Finch, he gets to show more anger. Peck gives the part a good sense of frustration and outrage as he attempts to fend off Cadyâs insidious threat.\n\nAs directed by J. Lee Thompson, Fear manages a nice pace and also maintains a consistent tone of menace. The filmâs world keeps the viewer on edge, though not through obvious theatrical tricks.\n\nInstead, the movie feels tense in a general sense. It boasts anger that usually remains below the surface.\n\nItâs that understated sense of cruelty that makes Fear so engaging. Rather than play events for overt scares, the film keeps matters subtler. That pays off and turns this into a compelling tale.\n\nMaybe Iâll change my mind when I rewatch the 1991 version, but right now I think the 1962 Cape Fear walks all over it. This edition produces a tense, menacing tale that works nicely.\n\nCape Fear appears in an aspect ratio of approximately 1.85:1 on this Blu-ray Disc. Overall, the transfer largely held up well.\n\nFor the most part, sharpness looked solid. A few slightly soft images materialized, but not a lot. Instead, I thought the majority of the flick boasted nice clarity and delineation.\n\nI noticed no issues with jagged edges or shimmering, and edge haloes remained absent. A couple small specks popped up but print flaws stayed modest.\n\nThough I suspect some grain reduction came into use here, it seemed minor. Much of the movie exhibited a good layer of grain.\n\nBlack levels were pretty strong, as they presented good depth and dimensionality along with nice contrast. Shadows were also fine. In the end, the movie looked good.\n\nCape Fear featured a perfectly adequate DTS-HD MA monaural sound mix, one that seemed typical of efforts from the era. The audio was somewhat dull and lacked detail, but I found it to also be clear and easily comprehensible.\n\nMusic lacked much punch, as dynamic range appeared limited. Speech was a little flat â and held back by some lackluster looping â but seemed intelligible and without edginess.\n\nI was pleased to note that no substantial distortion occurred during the track. The soundtrack delivered little spark or life, but it's more than acceptable based on the age of the movie.\n\nHow did the Blu-ray compare to the DVD from 2001? The lossless audio seemed a bit warmer, though there wasnât much room for improvement given the vintage of the material.\n\nVisuals showed the usual format-based improvements, as the Blu-ray appeared better defined and more cinematic. This turned into a satisfying upgrade.\n\nThe Blu-ray repeats the DVDâs extras, and we get a featurette called The Making of Cape Fear. It runs 27 minutes, 59 seconds and includes comments from producer/actor Gregory Peck and director J. Lee Thompson.\n\nâMakingâ covers the source novel and its path to the screen, story/characters, cast and performances, Peckâs dual role as actor and producer, Thompsonâs approach to the material and Hitchcockâs influence, shooting black and white and art direction, sets and locations, score, censorship issues and the 1991 remake.\n\nOn the surface, the inclusion of only two participants sounds like a weakness, but âMakingâ overcomes potential pitfalls. Both Peck and Thompson prove to be chatty and informative, so they cover a nice array of topics. Itâs too bad they didnât sit for a commentary, as they add a lot of good notes about the movie.\n\nIn addition to the filmâs trailer, we find a collection of production photos. This gives us a four-minute, 49-second montage that mixes stills with film clips.\n\nThe inclusion of the movie snippets perplexes me, and the photos themselves donât seem especially great, though the ads/posters add some value.\n\nLed by excellent lead performances and taut direction, the 1962 Cape Fear works as a strong thriller. It delivers an involving tale with enough twists to keep the viewer on edge. The Blu-ray offers mostly positive picture and audio as well as supplements led by an engaging featurette. Expect a solid drama here.\n\nTo rate this film, visit the prior review of CAPE FEAR"
