        "text": "8 pages, 12-pt Times New Roman, double-spaced.\n\nIn 1991, director Martin Scorsese remade J. Lee Thompson’s Cape Fear (1962). Like with any remake, there are vast similarities and parallels, as well as changes in style, mood, and audience expectations. As Scorsese is a graduate of NYU Film School as well as a “movie brat,” his version of Cape Fear is as much of an homage to the original as it is a remake. This paper will focus on a scene from the film in which Max Cady is taken into the police station. In the original version, this scene occurs right before the Bowden’s dog is poisoned; in the remake this scene occurs right after the dog is poisoned. In both versions, he is forced to do a strip search, as well as have his finances examined while Sam Bowden and police officers try to charge Cady with alternate crimes.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious difference between the two films is the color scheme: the original is in black and white, and the remake is in color. As a result, each film’s mise-en-scene takes vastly different approaches; however, they both achieve similar results. For example, Max Cady’s clothing in both versions is carefully crafted to draw the audience’s attention to him. Robert Mitchum’s Max Cady would not look out of place on a cruise in his white clothes, white shoes, and white Panama hat. Given the film’s color scheme and heavy use of shadows, our eyes are instantly drawn to Max Cady, even before he says a single word.\n\nLikewise, DeNiro’s Max Cady is hard to miss in his Hawaiian shirts. Such an item of clothing would be rendered almost useless in a black and white film, but color film stock enhances the louder aspects of Cady’s outfits. The interrogation scene in the remake could have easily conveyed in black and white, given its muted tone composed of fluorescent lighting, gray walls, and the neutral-colored clothing of the other actors. However, it is DeNiro’s Cady that brightens the scene with his numerous tattoos, which could not have shown up properly on black and white film. (Let us not forget that he also wears a rather outré pair of undergarments in this scene too!)\n\nMax Cady’s interaction with Sam Bowden and the police differ vastly in each version. In Thompson’s version, Cady is cooperative, talkative, and downright charming at times. He freely interacts with Sam Bowden and the police officers. In Scorsese’s version, Cady barely utters a word, and communicates mostly through his tattoos and furtive glances. He is mostly isolated behind the one-way mirror. Mitchum’s Cady undresses without anyone pressing him further, while DeNiro’s Cady is at the will of the police officers.\n\nThe space of the interrogation room is also set up differently in both scenes. They look similar in certain respects: the harsh overhead lighting and the bare walls. In the original version, the room is smaller, and everyone in the scene occupies the same space. Cady and Sam Bowden even converse with each another at a close distance. In the remake, the interrogation space is much larger and more realistic looking, given the police uniforms, one-way mirror, and line-up wall. Cady and Bowden do not speak to each other in this scene, as they cannot see each other, but the last two shots are identical in their framing and eyeline matches. One gets the feeling that one character is acutely aware of the other’s presence, even if they occupy separate sides of the same room.\n\nAnother notable difference between the scenes is in its sound design. The film has a very famous score by Bernard Hermann, and was barely rearranged by Elmer Bernstein for the remake. In Thompson’s version, the sound design is sparse in this particular scene, and the most notable sound is that of Cady’s Southern drawl. There are other noises as well, such as footsteps, closing doors, and rustling papers. Music is only heard at the end of the scene as it dissolves into the next, foreshadowing the dog’s death.\n\nHowever, in the parallel scene in the Scorsese version, the film’s main musical theme is used repeatedly as Bowden and Cady become more aware of each other’s presence. The score is first heard in the scene as Cady enters the room and gets louder when the camera focuses on him. The music is not as obvious as in other scenes, but the sound is clear and sets the mood for the rest of the film. This scene uses a similar soundtrack as the original scene, also composed of footsteps and creaking doors.\n\nThe cinematography in the original Cape Fear is much less flashy than in its remake. In this particular scene, the camera’s main focus is unquestionably on Mitchum, even though he never gets a shot alone or in close-up. The camera remains static for the most part, but moves occasionally to follow Cady as he stands up. Occasionally, he will get tighter framings when paired with other characters in the same space. In these scenes, he is almost always in the center or in the foreground of the frame, if not both, and our eyes are naturally drawn to him He is the only character with obvious movement, as he removes his clothing while the other characters have little or no movement. Peck, for example, does little else except lean against a wall.\n\nThis scene also has an ASL of 29.2 seconds. However, it is the second shot in the scene that is nearly two minutes long, and this shot raises the ASL significantly. (The first shot in the scene is only three seconds long.) During this second shot, Cady interacts with both Bowden and Dutton, constantly referring to himself “a cooperative guy,” and proving to the police that his finances are in order. This is done to emphasize Mitchum’s acting and body language, as he uses his upper body as well as his facial expressions to convey his threatening presence to Bowden.\n\nHowever, the cinematography of the 1991 version of Cape Fear draws much more attention to itself. The camera is rarely static, as it follows characters down hallways, around the interrogation room, and even along Cady’s body. It frequently tracks and zooms, framing close-ups even more tightly. The camera explores the space of the interrogation room much more freely than in the Thompson version. The space feels large, and the use of wide-angle lenses helps to exaggerate the sense of depth in the room. In this scene, the camera is used in this way as to highlight the distance between Bowden and Cady, even though they have two parallel close-ups at the end of the scene. The zooms are also used in this scene (and frequently throughout the rest of the film) to highlight the fear and emotion in Bowden’s face. However, the first zoom in on Bowden’s face in the scene is used as he identifies Cady, conveying a false sense of confidence on Bowden’s part.\n\nThe framings are also much tighter in this scene, as it employs numerous close-ups and extreme close-ups. Part of the reason for this comes from the rise of home video and films being aired on television more frequently during the 1980s. As such, framings in many films became much tighter, as many audience members became more likely to see a movie on television instead of the theatre. Many directors use such shots in order to look better on television and to make the film easier to cut.\n\nAnother result of such framings is actors using their facial features to express emotion and less of their entire body, although DeNiro’s Cady frequently gestures wildly, much like Mitchum’s Cady. However, during the interrogation scene, his face is the main means of expression emotion. Although his tattoos communicate information to the audience, his facial expressions are a better gauge of his emotions than his tattoos. We clearly see the disgust and sheer menace on his face.\n\nThe editing styles in both versions of the film are also quite different. The original employs classical Hollywood editing techniques that does not draw attention to itself, and it never breaks the axis of action, and matches-on-actions are frequently used to connect the shots together visually. Here, we get a clear sense of space, as well as where the characters are placed throughout the scene.\n\nThe editing in the remake is flashier, but it probably would not be as noticeable the average film-goer. The ASL for this scene is 6.15 seconds, much shorter than the original. In this scene, the axis of action is broken a couple of times, and we see Bowden and Elgart on opposite sides of the frame. This is another stylistic choice Scorsese uses to exaggerate the space of the interrogation room, as well as to make clear character placement and blocking less obvious.\n\nExtreme close-ups are employed primarily when showing Cady’s tattoos. We can see some of them under his clothes earlier in the film, but this is the first time the audience—as well as Bowden—gets a good look at them. The shots are long enough as to be able to read them, and the camera moves slowly enough as to make this task easier for the audience. They convey Cady’s religious views and knowledge of the Bible, merely one area in which he is well versed as he learned to read while in prison. They also convey Cady’s strength and high threshold for pain, and we will see this ability later in the film when the men Bowden hired try to beat him up, as well as in the last scenes of the film.\n\nThe use of axial cuts is also a product of post-1970s filmmaking. In the original scene, Cady’s finances only get talked about, and we do not see any physical evidence of them. Instead, Cady tells the police officers to call his bank for proof of his legitimately gained money. Instead of using tighter framings, Thompson uses Mitchum’s body as a way of conveying information, as Cady gestures smugly and points to his checkbook, gladly proving the police wrong when they try to charge him with different crimes.\n\nHowever, axial cuts are used in the remake as to show the audience the physical evidence of Cady’s savings account, instead of just telling them. During these cuts, we can very clearly see the specific numerical amounts, and the handwriting on Cady’s deposit slip. They are also conveyed as shots from Bowden’s point of view. We discover this information at the same time Bowden does, and these shots are further used to highlight Bowden’s frustration toward Cady, as this tactic to try to legitimately charge him with a crime (and to make the charge stick) fails as well. A similar extreme close-up is also used when showing Cady’s rap sheet, but it is much harder to read, and the clearest thing that the audience sees is earlier mug shots of Cady.\n\nIn the scene before the interrogation scene in the original version, the police pick up Cady at a bar, and he blatantly flirts with a woman that he will later assault. During the interrogation scene, we become less sympathetic to Cady, as he is portrayed as an alcoholic womanizer from the very beginning of the film. Meanwhile, in the scene in the remake before the interrogation room, Bowden has just found out that his dog has been poisoned. He knows Cady is responsible for the crime, but he only has a hunch and no hard evidence. However, he implicitly blames his wife Leigh for the crime, and they begin to fight. At this point, we become less sympathetic to Bowden, as it seems unfair of him to blame his wife for something she is clearly not responsible for. Although his projected frustration is realistic, it still works in such a way as to make the audience further question Bowden’s status as a good family man and ethical lawyer.\n\nThe camera work and editing in this scene of the remake are used in such a way as to make Bowden sympathetic and redeem him to the audience after the previous scene. Scorsese’s Bowden and Thompson’s Bowden are much less alike than the two versions of Max Cady. In the original, Bowden is morally unambiguous, and his family is as wholesome as can be. In contrast, the Bowden family in the remake is anything but. In the original version, we never need to question Bowden’s ethics and choices, while in the remake we do so constantly. The interrogation scene provides a temporary redemption for Bowden until the next scene at the parade, a scene in which Bowden’s emotions get a hold of him, and he punches Cady after he makes an unsavory comment about Leigh.\n\nDuring this scene, the audience hopes to find Cady guilty and to find some justice for Bowden and his family, as well as to redeem Bowden for being nasty to his wife for an incident that clearly was not her fault. Although we never see Bowden and Cady together physically during this scene, it is shot in such a way as to show Bowden’s reflection in the mirror, superimposed in front of Cady. This is done in order to cast Cady and Bowden as morally alike, for morality and lack of ethics is a major theme in the remake. In the original version, there is no moral ambiguity—Cady is pure evil and Bowden is nothing but innocent. Since this scene takes place within the first half hour of a roughly two-hour film, Bowden’s reflection is used in such a way as to establish a pattern that will be seen later on in the film.\n\nThis scene is also interesting for reasons beyond Scorsese’s stylistic choices. It references Mitchum in a number of different ways. First, there is his role as Lieutenant Elgart, a man trying to help Bowden catch Cady. His role is larger than that of a cameo appearance, but what makes his presence unusual is the fact that he works on the opposite side of the law in the remake. Gregory Peck also has a role in the remake, and he too, makes a moral role reversal from his previous role in the original. He plays a lawyer in this version as well, but instead of trying to catch Cady, his Lee Heller defends Cady instead of Bowden. By casting the two main stars of the original version, Scorsese is clearly paying his respects to the original, as well as further signifying to the audience his in-depth knowledge of film history, a character and directorial trait he is well known for.\n\nCady’s tattoos in the remake echo Robert Mitchum’s other famous psychopath, the preacher Harry Powell from Charles Laughton’s The Night of the Hunter (1955). In that film, Harry Powell is a murderer masking as a preacher, and he has the words “LOVE” and “HATE” tattooed on his knuckles, an important motif throughout the film. This bit has been referenced numerous times in other movies and television, but they take on a certain significance in the Cape Fear remake, given both Powell and Cady’s religious bents, similar cadences in their voices, and commanding personas. In fact, DeNiro’s characterization of Cady could be seen as an homage to Harry Powell, as Mitchum’s Cady does not have the same religious proclivities that his revived persona does.\n\nAudiences and critics may get frustrated with remakes, claiming that Hollywood has run out of ideas and there is no reason to mess with the classics. However, in the hands of a skilled director like Martin Scorsese, an original film can be reworked into something equally impressive and challenging. By using different stylistic devices, characterization, and thematic tone, a film and its remake can become two entirely different experiences for viewers. Remakes like Cape Fear also respect film history through citation and homage, providing viewers with another level on which to enjoy the film."
