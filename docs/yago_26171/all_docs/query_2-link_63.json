        "text": "The mortal remains of Francis' wife Adelgunde are interred in the far right pillar of the Ferdinandsgruft. On the pillar is an inscription listing the names of the sixteen members of the House of Habsburg interred there; Adelgunde's name and her birth and death years can be seen on the third line.\n\nTomb of Queen Adelgunde\n\nUntil 1960 Queen Adelgunde's sarcophagus was in the Toskanagruft with that of her husband. 3 In that year, however, it was decided to reduce the number of sarcophagi in that room. Some sarcophagi were placed in the newly built Neue Gruft, while others (including that of Queen Adelgunde) were placed in niches in the wall of the Ferdinandsgruft. Later the arches of these niches were plastered over, so that today one can only see the plain wall with the name plaque.\n\nSarcophagus of Empress Maria Anna of Austria\n\nOn the right side of the Ferdinandsgruft is the sarcophagus of Empress Maria Anna of Austria (daughter of King Victor and younger sister of Queen Mary III and II). On the front and back ends of the sarcophagus are the Austrian coat-of-arms. The left side is decorated with an IHS monogram (for Jesus) encircled in a wreath and two lion faces; the right side is similarly decorated with an MR monogram (for Mary). The top of the sarcophagus is surmounted by a cusion on which sits the Austrian imperial crown. Below this is a crucifix and a wreath encircling a Latin inscription:\n\nSarcophagus of Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria\n\nIn the centre of the room is a stone dais on which rests the similarly decorated sarcophagus of Maria Anna's husband, Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria. On the front of the stone dais is a Latin inscription:\n\nOn the back of the stone dais is Ferdinand's motto in Latin:\n\nRECTA · TVERI I have governed rightly.\n\nThe crypt is open daily from 9.30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. (closed November 1 and 2; entrance fee € 4,00).\n\nTelephone: 512-68-53-16; official website.\n\nNotes\n\n1 To the right of Francis' sarcophagus is the sarcophagus of Archduke Anton Victor of Austria; to the left is a very simple sarcophagus (perhaps that of Archduke Ludwig Joseph or Archduke Ferdinand Karl).\n\n2 The text of this inscription is taken from Alois Jahn, Die Grabstätten der Habsburger und der mit Ihnen Verwandten Häuser in Österreichs Kirchen, Das Haus Habsburg, Band II, Teil 2 (Privately printed, 2001).\n\n3\"Die Ferdinandsgruft\", Die Kaisergruft in Wien, http://www.kaisergruft.at/kaisergruft/ferdigr.htm.\n\nImage 1 (Facade of church): unknown source.\n\nImage 2 (Sarcophagus of King Francis I): © Noel S.
