        "text": "Hello, Winter!\n\n\"Christmas in America\" by Alphonse Mucha I can't believe December is already here! I'm one of those people who absolutely love Christmas and anything associated with it. I'm also so excited it is finally cold- really cold! As we start our countdown to Christmas, here are some names to keep your holiday spirits up. Wintery Names: Eira - Welsh, \"Snow\" Nicholas Lumi - Finnish, \"Snow\" Frostine Haukea - Hawaiian, \"white snow\" Natalie - \"Christmas Day\" Rudolph Bora (b) - Albanian, \"snow\" Fannar - Icelandic, \"snow drift\" Decima/Decimus Noelle/Noel Isolde - Possibly \"ice battle\" Zuzu - Nickname for Susan; daughter in \"It's a Wonderful Life\" Yuki - Japanese, \"snow\" Hollis - English, \"holly trees\" Gwyneira - Welsh, \"white snow\" Vetr - Norse personification of winter Nieves - Spanish, \"snow\" Words: Icy Winter/Wintry Frost\n\nOn My Mind: 12/1/14\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer as Isabeau in \"Ladyhawke\" I sabeau - I watched a bit of \"Ladyhawke\" the other day, the cheesy fantasy film with Michelle Pfeiffer and Rutger Hauer. I love fantasy films, especially the ones made in the 80s and 90s. Isabeau is the name of Michelle Pfeiffer's character, and one I've seen thrown around a lot on name forums. In the film it is said \"EE-sah-bo\", though it can also be said \"IZ-uh-bo\". For a historical figure, there is Isabeau of Bavaria, who was Queen of France from 1385-1422. Manu - I first came across this name on actor Manu Bennett of \"Spartacus\" fame, who is of Maori descent on his father's side. He says it is a Maori name meaning \"bird\", and that it is in honor of his uncle who was the Bishop of New Zealand. Fernway - Going through Lena Horn's filmography, I came across this unusual choice. I'm really loving it, and I think it would make an especially grea\n\nNames Taken from Lord Frederic Leighton\n\n\"Pavonia\" by Lord Frederic Leighton Lord Frederic Leighton was an English artist who lived from 1830 to 1896. He was also the bearer of the shortest lived peerage ever; it was a hereditary title, and he had it only one day before he died. Female: Phoebe May Actaea Clytie Psamathe Acme Venus Persephone Nausicaa Andromache Ida Pysche Antigone Sibyl Electra Clytemnestra Andromeda Iphigenia Hero Pavonia (A genus of plants) Male: Icarus Daedalus Septimus Elijah Richard Frederic Dante Perseus Henry Cymon Hercules Agamemnon Alcestis Jonathan David\n\nManon\n\nOrigin : French Gender : Female Meaning : Diminutive of Marie Pronunciation : muh-NOH, muh-NAWN, MAN-on Other forms : N/A This is one of those names where I can't decide my feelings on it. I like the way it looks, I like that it is unusual and French, but I'm not sure if I'm keen on the pronunciations. I think the first time I heard it said aloud was when Damian Lewis was talking about his daughter Manon, and he used the \"MAN-on\" pronunciation, which sounded nice when he said it, but I sound very stilted when I attempt it. Manon is a diminutive for Marie, and is used in France and the Netherlands. The first Manon I think of is from \"Manon of the Spring\" or \"Manon des Sources\", the sequel to the critically acclaimed \"Jean de Florette\". It is about Jean de Florette's daughter who is named Manon after her mother's favorite opera role, \"Manon Lescaut\". The opera was adapted from the 1731 book by Abbé Prévost, wh\n\nMayflower Names\n\n\"Landing of the Pilgrims\" by Michele Felice Cornè *I totally forgot to post this yesterday, so here it is a little late. Happy Thanksgiving! Today the post is some of the names of passengers on the Mayflower, both those from the Holland congregation and the London one. Isaac Allerton - Mary Allerton (wife) - Bartholomew Allerton (7, boy) - Remember Allerton (5, girl) - Mary Allerton (3, girl; She was the last passenger of the Mayflower to die) William Brewster - Mary Brewster (wife) - Love/Truelove Brewster (9, boy) - Wrestling Brewster (6, boy) Moses Fletcher Degory Priest Desire Minter Stephen Hopkins - Elizabeth Hopkins (wife) - Giles Hopkins (12, boy) - Constance Hopkins (14, girl) - Damaris Hopkins (1-2, girl) - Oceanus Hopkins (Born during the voyage) William White - Susanna White (wife) - Resolved White (5, boy) - Peregrine White (Boy, born on board in Cape Cod) Humility Cooper Jasper More Elias Storey Roger Wilder\n\nThe Siblings of C.C. van Asch van Wijck\n\n\"Cox in the Atelier of Toon Dupuis\" C.C. van Asch van Wijck was a Dutch artists' model and sculptor, and had many siblings who had amazing names. C.C. herself was Lady Cornélie Caroline, and was called \"Cox\". She was named for her aunt, Countess Cornelia van Limburg Stirum. She was the fourth of the five children of Lord Hubert Willem van Asch van Wijck and Countess Wilhelmina Philippina \"Wim\" van Limburg Stirum. The others were as follows: Constance \"Conny\" Maurits \"Maus\" Cecilius \"Cecil\" C.C. Wilhelmina Adolphina \"Dolph\" C.C. died after giving birth to her son, Johan Adolph \"Dolph\" Volcker, at the age of thirty-one.\n\nA List of Names Taken from French Royal Mistresses (2)\n\nAgnès Sorel as \"Madonna Surrounded by Seraphim and Cherubim\" by Jean Fouquet Continuing on... Agnès Sorel - Charles VII - Sorel was the first officially recognized royal mistress in France. She was called \"Dame de beauté\", and had three daughters by Charles, Charlotte de Valois, Marie de Valois, and Jeanne de Valois. She died at the age of twenty-eight after giving birth to her fourth child. She was believed to have been poisoned using mercury, and theories state it was Charles' own son who did it. Antoinette de Maignelais - Charles VII - Antoinette was Agnès' cousin and replaced her as mistress after her death. She had two daughters believed to have been sired by him. One was named Jane. Phélisé Regnard - Louis XI Marguerite de Sassenage - Louis XI Françoise de Foix, Comtesse de Châteaubriant - Francis I Anne de Pisseleu d'Heilly, Duchess of Étampes - Francis I Mary Boleyn - Francis I (Disputed) Diane de Poitiers - Henry II Janet\n\nA List of Names Taken from French Royal Mistresses (1)\n\nOdette and Charles VI by François Guizot I have a fascination with royal mistresses, with the power they gained and held, rivaling only the Queen's, who very often aware of them. They often had quite interesting names, and their children did as well, having the freedom to go a bit more adventurous with them than the royals did. Without further ado, starting all the way back in Clovis' reign from 509-511, here is the first batch of names. Evochilde - Clovis I Waldrada, Princess of the Lombards - Chlothar I Valtrude of the Lombards - Chlothar I Arnegundis - Chlothar I Merofleda - Charibert I - Had a daughter by him named Berteflede. Clothilde - Charibert I Marcovefa - Charibert I - Had a daughter by him named Clothilde. Theogilda - Charibert I Fredegund d'Ardennes - Chilperic I - Later became Queen. Persuaded Chilperic to divorce his first wife and send her to a convent; however he then married Galswintha, who Fredegund strangled. Her daughter with Ch\n\nSilent Star Names\n\nI've been entranced by silent films ever since I saw the 1926 \"The Scarlet Letter\" starring Lillian Gish and Lars Hanson early one morning. I loved the heavy makeup and the over the top performances, the glamor and the fashion. The names are also really great, especially the women's, which were really spunky. I tried to feature a lot of the more prominent stars of the time so we could get an idea of what was popular, but a few of the more unusual names of lesser known stars slipped in! If you comment, please let me know what your favorite silent film is! Ladies: Anita Page Lila Lee Jobyna Ralston Madge Bellamy Betty Bronson Renée Adorée Madlaine Traverse Nita Naldi Billie Dove Marguerite De La Motte Leatrice Joy Texas Guinan Zena Keefe Lillian and Dorothy Gish Bessie Love Teddy Sampson Anna May Wong Theda Bara Mae Marsh Alta Allen Francelia Billington Minta Durfee (real name was Araminta) Louise Brooks ZaSu Pitts Clara Bow Marion Davies\n\nThe Children of Joachim of Denmark\n\nPrincess Marie and Prince Joachim of Denmark Prince Joachim of Denmark, Count of Monpezat was born Joachim Holger Waldemar Christian to Margrethe II of Denmark and Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark . He first married Princess Alexandra of Denmark, later Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg who was born Alexandra Christina Manley. Their children are: Nikolai William Alexander Frederik, \" Prince Nikolai of Denmark, Count of Monpezat \" Felix Henrik Valdemar Christian, \" Prince Felix of Denmark, Count of Monpezat Then he married Princess Marie of Denmark , who was born Marie Agathe Odile Cavallier. Their children are: Henrik Carl Joachim Alain, \" Prince Henrik of Denmark, Count of Monpezat \" Athena Marguerite Françoise Marie, \" Princess Athena of Denmark, Countess of Monpezat \"\n\nLively Names\n\n\"Allegory of Life\" by Pierre Puvis de Chevannes There are more names with meanings relating to \"life\" than just Vita; from the Albanian Luljeta to the Thai Suchart, here are lively names from all over the world. Girls: Asha (Swahili name meaning \"life\") Liv (Means \"life\" in Swedish) Enid (Welsh name meaning \"soul\" or \"life) Zoe (Greek name meaning \"life\") Luljeta (Albanian name meaning \"flower of life\") Hiwot (Amharic name meaning \"life\") Bizitza (Means \"life\" in Basque) Boys: Bion (Greek name meaning \"life\") Chayyim (Hebrew name meaning \"life\") Vitale (Italian name meaning \"of life, vital\") Suchart (Thai name meaning \"born into a good life\") Zoticus (Greek name meaning \"full of life\") Beathan (Scottish name meaning \"life\") Unisex: Vivo (Esperanto name meaning \"life\") Chinwendu (Igbo name meaning\n\nThe Children of Johann I Joseph of Liechtenstein\n\nJohann I Joseph of Liechtenstein Johann I Joseph, Prince of Leichtenstein was born Johann Baptist Josef Adam Johann Nepomuk Aloys Franz de Paula to Franz Joseph I and Leopoldine von Sternberg .

I do understand some of the hate, but I also think there are some exceptions. I also love it when the maiden name is used, either as a first or middle. If my own surname sounded nice enough for a name, I would use it in a heartbeat; unfortunately it doesn't. But here are some that I think wear especially nice on little girls. Baker Fifer/Pfeiffer Abbott Weaver Foster Shaw Lane Fontaine Silva English (Guilty pleasure!) Joplin Painter Madigan Winslet Marlowe Golightly Draper Foley Blanchett Munro Paige/Page Sayer Hart Fisher\n\nRyan Gosling and Eva Mendes Reveal Daughter's Name\n\nEva and Ryan The secretive couple have finally released the name of their new baby - Esmeralda Amada.

It is about an Iranian man named Nasser-Ali Khan who is a talented musician. After a fight with his wife, who breaks his violin, he decides to die. It is based on the graphic novel by Marjane Satrapi, who co-directed the film with Vincent Paronnaud. Parvine - I think this is a form of Parvin, which means \"the Pleiades\" in Persian. The Pleiades are a group of stars, closest to earth and most visible. They are named for seven sisters, companions to the Goddess Artemis, daughters of Atlas and Pleione. Nasser - Naseer, a form of Nasir, means \"helper\" in Arabic. I especially like the female version, Nasira. Irâne - This one was the most unusual to me. In the subtitles it is simply Iran, however she is credited as Irâne. I wonder if it is just the French version of Iran? If any one has any info, please let me know. Cyrus - I've liked this name for\n\nMila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher Have a Girl\n\nMila and Ashton After months of waiting to find out what they would name their baby, the time is finally here.

Here I have compiled a list of names that are still flying under the radar, and have yet to be dusted off.

In honor of fall finally arriving, I'm going to do a post on names that remind me of fall and relate to it. *I wanted to thank my sister, Abby, for helping with this list! Autumnal Names: Luna - Harvest Moon Aurelia/Aurelius - \"Golden, gilded\" Orabela -\"Golden-beautiful\" Autumnus - Latin form of autumn Demeter - \"Earth mother\", Goddess of agriculture Oisín - \"Little deer\" Todd - \"Fox\" Pepita - Diminutive of Joseph and feminine variants; name for pumpkin seeds Flavius/Flavia - \"Golden\" or \"yellow-haired\" Zibiah - \"Roe, deer\" Arista - \"Ear of Corn\" Golda/Goldie Kaede - \"Maple\" Aiman - \"Beauty of the mo\n\nThe Children of Victoria Louise of Prussia\n\nPrincess Victoria Louise of Prussia Princess Victoria Louise of Prussia was born Viktoria Luise Adelheid Mathilde Charlotte to William II, German Emperor and Empress Augusta Victoria .

Idris comes from the Welsh udd meaning \"lord\" or \"prince\" and ris , \"ardent, impulsive, enthusiastic\". Mr. Elba is really Idrissa Akuna Elba; His father, Winston, is from Sierra Leone and his mother, Eve, is from Ghana. Although Idris is rather rare, there are other namesakes, including poet Idris Davies, Malaysian footballer Idris Abdul Karim, Saint Idris the Prophet, and a female example, Idris the Tardis from \"Doctor Who\". Idris Gawr, or \"Idris the Giant\", was a King of Meirionnydd who was said to have won a battle against the Irish on the mountain Cadair Idris (known locally as Cader Idris), which means \"Chair of Idris\". Other legends state that there actually was a giant named Id\n\nWatery Names\n\n\"Miranda - The Tempest\" by John William Waterhouse I am simultaneously afraid and fascinated by the ocean.

Other forms : Oiá The Goddess Oya represents the warrior-spirit of the wind, lightning, fire, magic, and fertility. She guards the Underworld, and creates hurricanes and tornadoes, which are said to be her twirling skirts as she dances. She is also the spirit of change, and the changes that come from destruction. Oya wears every color but black, and she sleeps at the gates of cemeteries. She is not only a Goddess, but an Orisha, which is an elemental spirit, her element being lightning. She holds the power to call forth the spirit of death, or even send him back. Oya is the protector of women, and her knowledge of magic makes her associated with witches. When she dances, she is said to have a horse tail, and she can transform into a water buffalo. Some of her favorite offerings are shea butter, eggplants, rum, pennies, masks, and wind instruments. She is called \"the one who uses a\n\nThe Children of Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha\n\nPrincess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha was born Sibylle Calma Maria Alice Bathildis Feodora to Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Princess Victoria Adelaide of Schleswig-Holstein .

I've liked the name Vale for a really long time, though I actually prefer it for a boy. A vale is a poetic word for a valley, which comes from the Old French val , which was derived from the Latin vallis or vallem which meant \"valley\". I'm sure a few of you have even heard of the \"vale of years\" from \"Othello\", and the \"vale of tears\" saying. I think Vale is a really lovely and obscure nature name, that doesn't seem overly hippie.\n\nWonderously Welsh\n\nAngharad Rees Girls: Seren Rhosyn Lleucu Heledd Angharad Olwen Enid Ceridwen Gwenllian Myfanwy Eysllt Gwyneira Tesni Mabyn Sioned Llinos Afanen Gwendolen Eluned Briallen Ffion Morwenna Rhiannon Boys: Taliesen Vaughn Gruffudd Emrys Ioan Llyr Aneirin/Aneurin Geraint Hopcyn Cai Islwyn Owain Llywelyn Rhys Siarl Uther Emlyn Idris Cadfael Eifion Dafydd\n\nA Collection of Names Taken from Roman Empresses (Part Four)\n\nMaria Megale Komnene Final one!

Redgrave was born in Greenwich in 1937, to actors Sir Michael Redgrave and Rachel Kempson, Lady Redgrave. Laurence Olivier famously announced her birth at a performance of \"Hamlet\", in which her father played Laertes, by saying that \"tonight a great actress has been born\". Initially the tall Vanessa planned on being a dancer, but eventually turned to acting, her family's profession of choice; her brother and sister are the late Corin and Lynn Redgrave. Her first starring role was in \"Morgan: A Suitable Case for Treatment\", for which she was nominated for an Oscar, a Cannes award, a Golden Globe award, and BAFTA Film award. In 1962 Vanessa married Tony Richardson, and had two daughters, actresses Joely and the late Natasha Richardson. The marriage ended in 1967 when Tony left her for Jeanne Moreau.

She was discovered on a sidewalk in New York, and the next day had a shoot with Irving Penn. Richard Avedon called her \"the most remarkable and unconventional beauty of her time\". Garnet - I love seeing names deemed as \"feminine\" on men, as it is so often the opposite. Garnet Wolesely was named after his father, a Major. Angharad - I'm currently reading \"The Blue Sword\" by Robin McKinley. The main character is Angharad \"Harry\" Crewe, an orphan who is sent to live in Istan, a military outpost, and eventually becomes a warrior of Damar. Angharad is of Welsh origin and means \"more love\". Oberyn - Oberyn Martell was one of the most popular characters on the last season of \"Game of Thrones\". Oberyn is most likely a form of Oberon, which Shakespeare used for\n\nInterview Over At Waltzing More Than Matilda\n\nI had so much fun doing this interview , please go and check it out!\n\nA Collection of Names Taken from Roman Empresses (Part One)\n\nMilonia Caesonia I absolutely love Roman names, so this was a real treat to write and research.

Although more usual for boys, it reminds me of River Song of \"Doctor Who\" and River Tam of \"Firefly\" and \"Serenity\". d'Artagnan - I really enjoyed the premiere of \"The Three Musketeers\" last night on BBC. I've always loved how romantic d'Artagnan sounds, and I wonder how it would work on a real person. Gamora - I'm really excited for \"Guardian of the Galaxy\". Zoe Saldana plays Gamora, the last of her kind and reputedly \"the most dangerous woman in the galaxy.\" Bran - Bran, really Brandon, is one of the Starks in \"Game of Thrones\", a name that I think will, or should, catch on. It's short, simple, but undeniably masculine. It means \"raven\", and in Irish mythology it was the name of a mariner. In Welsh mythology Bran the Blessed was the son of the God Llyr.

Frequently compared to \"Fleetwood Mac\", the girls grew up on 70's rock and had a family band, in which their father Mordechai \"Moti\" played drums and their mother Donna played the guitar. The name Este was a real surprise to me, but a pleasant one. Este could be a form of many different names, from the Basque Esti to the Hungarian Eszti, but I think it is more than likely a form of Estee, a Jewish diminutive of Esther. Reeve - I'm totally addicted to \"Penny Dreadful\" on Showtime, on which one of the main characters is Dorian Gray, played by actor and musician Reeve Carney. It is a surname, and is an occupational name for a steward or bailiff. Vivendel - This name means \"honeysuckle\" in Norwegian, and is pronounced \"VEE-ven-dell\". I at first thought it was a Tolkien name, reminiscent of Rivendell,\n\nThe Children of Marie José of Belgium\n\nPrincess Marie José of Belgium Princess Marie José of Belgium was born Marie José Charlotte Sophie Amélie Henriette Gabrielle to Albert I of Belgium and Elisabeth of Bavaria .
