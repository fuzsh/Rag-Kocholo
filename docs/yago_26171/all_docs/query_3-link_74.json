        "text": "Marie Hedwig Auguste of Sulzbach (German: Marie Hedwig Auguste von Sulzbach; born: 15 April 1650 in Sulzbach; died: 23 November 1681 in Hamburg) was a Countess Palatine of Sulzbach by birth and by marriage, Archduchess of Austria and by her second marriage, Duchess of Saxe-Lauenburg.\n\nEarly life\n\nHedwig was a daughter of the Duke and Count Palatine Christian August of Sulzbach (1622â1708) from his marriage to Countess Amalie of Nassau-Siegen (1613â1669), daughter of Count John VII of Nassau-Siegen.\n\nFirst marriage\n\nShe was married on 3 June 1665 per cura in the court chapel of Sulzbach to Archduke Sigismund Francis of Austria-Tyrol (1630â1665), who after his brother's unexpected death had resigned from his ecclesiastical positions in order to marry. The marriage was never consummated: while travelling to meet his bride, the Archduke fell seriously ill and died in Innsbruck twelve days after the marriage.\n\nSecond marriage\n\nHedwig's second marriage, in Sulzbach on 9 April 1668, was with Duke Julius Francis of Saxe-Lauenburg (1641â1689). Her father had a memorial stone erected in the Sulzbach parish church to commemorate the event.[1] Hedwig had been assured an annual income of 20000guilders at her first marriage; Julius Francis made a deal with the imperial court, in which Hedwig would receive a lump sum instead.\n\nDeath\n\nHedwig died in 1681 and was buried in the White Castle at Ostrov (German: Schlackenwerth).\n\nIssue\n\nHedwig from her second marriage had the following children:\n\nAnna Maria Theresia (1670â1671)\n\nAnna Maria Franziska (1672â1741)\n\nmarried firstly in 1690 Count Palatine Philip William of Neuburg (1668â1693)\n\nmarried secondly 1697 Grand Duke Gian Gastone de' Medici of Tuscany (1671â1737)\n\nSybille (1675â1733)\n\nmarried in 1690 Margrave Louis William of Baden-Baden (1655â1707)\n\nReferences and sources\n\nTheologische Quartalschrift, vol. 50, H.
