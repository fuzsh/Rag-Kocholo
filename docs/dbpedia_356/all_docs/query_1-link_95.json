Operators can thus determine the status of the production equipment and wells by visually checking the sensing devices.\n\nthe sensor devices connected to critical equipment are usually wired directly or through electromechanical relays to shut off control devices which can interrupt the operation of non complying equipment or shut off the whole production facility if dangerous conditions occur.\n\nthe operator has to read the various gages or sensor devices and make the appropriate manual adjustments an well valves, production equipment controls, etc. to maintain the oil or gas well or field within acceptable operating parameters.\n\nthe number of sensor and control devices is a function of the\n\na further level of automation is added when servo controls; i.e.\n\nElectric motors pneumatic activators, rheostats, etc.\n\na remote location i.e. the panel room\n\nMore sophisticated installations use control theory techniques and open or closed loop circuits to drive, with a function of the output of the sensor device or devices, the servo systems controlling the equipment until the value of the condition monitored returns to acceptable levels.\n\nSCADA Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition\n\nSCADA Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition\n\nsensors which report to a central monitoring location through a communication satellite link.\n\nSCADA Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition\n\nthe sensor and control devices must be programmed on site.\n\nthe output of the on location sensor is relayed, via satellite, to the central monitoring location.\n\na processor or the human element makes a decision on a corrective action which is then relayed, again via the satellite link, to the remote location servos.\n\nthe outputs of commercially available or custom analog or digital sensors are connected to one or more commercially available programmable logic units.\n\nthe outputs of the logic units are connected to either commercially available or custom servo mechanisms which respond to the output of the logic units as a function of the output of the sensor devices and thus can take action on the monitored equipment to comply with the preprogrammed instruction.\n\nthe operator can program both the compliance intervals for each sensor and the desired response by each servo from a commercially available control computer and software which is connected to the programmable logic units either through a telephone link or a digital data link.\n\nthe programmable logic units will be capable of both monitoring and automatically\n\nthe programmable logic unit can be programmed to report the event both on site and in the\n\nthe programmable logic unit is also capable of reporting system status on a recurring basis and log the output of all sensor devices for later analysis. Given the almost total flexibility in the number and type of sensor devices, servo devices and the programmability of the interaction between the two sets of services, the system is capable of monitoring and controlling automatically essentially all phases of an oil or gas production facility.\n\nOne object of the invention is to monitor the operating parameters of an oil or gas production facility and control its operation through the use of existing sensors, servo devices and programmable logic units.\n\nAnother object of the invention is to allow the operator the\n\na further object of the invention is to receive status reports on the operation in an efficient and economical manner.\n\nAn additional object of the invention is to be able to change the operating parameters of the installation from a remote location through commercially available software and hardware.\n\nSensor devices with analog output meeting the standard 4-20 mA output or on/off sensor devices are installed conventionally throughout the oil or gas production according to operating and safety requirements.\n\nthe output of such devices is connected to a local programmable logic unit (\"LLU\") such as the Novar Controls Corporation Executive Processor or Controller.\n\nLLU local programmable logic unit\n\nthe LLU is equipped with a number of input ports which can interface with the output of the sensor devices. As shown in Fig. 1 each sensor devices axe connected to a corresponding input port of the LLU.\n\nLLU remote logic units\n\nthe LLU is equipped, among others, with internal clock, RCM memories for its management and RAM memories for the acceptance of operational instructions (setting of RAM logic states) which can be, inputted, via an internal telephone module or a data link, from a control computer typically located at the home office.\n\nthe control computer such as the Engineering Support System of Novar Corporation, is a personal computer or mini computer containing proprietary interface equipment and software capable of loading the operational parameters required by the\n\nthe instruction for the RAM memories of the RLUs is transferred from the control computer to the LLU RAMs which then transfers the instructions to the RLUs RAMs via the RS485 bus.\n\nRLUs can thus communicate back and forth with the LLU but not directly with the control computers.\n\nthe LLU and the RLUs can thus be programmed to perform the following function:\n\nthe LLU and RLUs read the output of the sensor devices, store it and can transmit the data, via the communication link to the control computer.\n\nthe data is also available on site through a control panel and display installed on the LLU.\n\nBoth the LLU and the RLUs can be programmed to detect a fault condition which exists when the output of a sensor device falls outside a preprogrammed allowable range. When a faulty or non complying condition is detected, the unit detecting the non complying signal, will respond according to the programmed instruction by activating one of its outputs connected to the appropriate servo device.\n\nthe local and remote logic units are capable of two types of output:\n\nthe on/off a.c. voltage can be used to activate a servo, such as a shut-off pneumatic valve to shut off the well or a cut off switch to kill an engine if the non complying condition requires such action.\n\na servo such as a shut-off pneumatic valve to shut off the well or a cut off switch to kill an engine if the non complying condition requires such action.\n\nthe pulse modulated a.c. voltage is a function of the value of the sensor output and thus can be utilized in a closed loop circuit to drive a servo mechanism which will act on the process until the sensor output has returned within the allowed operating range.\n\nthe local logic unit can be programmed to report to the control computer, via the communication link, either at preset time intervals or upon occurrence of a non complying condition, the status of the system. Both the on site operator and the operator of the control computer can poll the LLU to determine system status.\n\nFig. 1 Is a block diagram of an. installation including all types of input and output which can be included in the system.\n\nFig. 2 Is the representation of an actual installation in the field.\n\nFig. 3 Is the flow chart of the control logic activated by one of the sensors.\n\nFig. 1 is the block diagram of the interconnection of a typical system showing the basic system components according to the preferred embodiment.\n\nControl Computer 1 is a commercially available computer, such as the Novar Corporation Engineering Support System which contains buffer hardware and specialized software to control the system.\n\nthe control computer is connected to a video display 2 and, if desired, can be connected with a compatible printer 3.\n\nComponents 1,2, and 3 can be located anywhere access to a telephone line is available.\n\nthe control computer is connected, via a telephone link 4 to the balance of the system which is installed on the location to be monitored and controlled.\n\nLLU 5 which is a commercially available logic processor, is connected, via an internal modem and link 4, to the control computer 1.\n\nLLU 5 may also be connected, via an RS485 bus 6, to one or more RLUs 7.\n\nRLU units which are commercially available programmable logic units, such as the Novar Corporation Input/Output modules, allows the system to be expanded to handle all of the monitoring and control functions necessary in the installation.\n\nBoth the LLU and RLU units are connected, via input buses 8 with monitoring sensors 9.\n\nthe sensors are installed on the equipment to be monitored.\n\nthe number of sensors which can be connected to each unit is typically limited to eight. Said sensors can either be of the on/off type or commercially available 4-20 mA output analog sensors.\n\nthe LLU and RLU units are also connected via output buses 10 to servos 11. These commercially available devices can be on/off devices or proportional analog devices.\n\nthe servos are also installed on the equipment. Depending en the instructions received from the LLU or the RLUs, they either shut off or alter controls or settings on the controlled equipment.\n\nthe LLU may also be connected, via a data bus 12 to a local printer.13.\n\nthe logic level settings in the control computer are then loaded into the LLU 5 via telephone link 4.\n\nthe LLU transfers the logic levels to the RLUs via data bus 6.\n\nthe installation is then fully programmed and operational.\n\nthe LLU and RLUs need no further instructions from control computer 1 and will perform all monitoring and controls unattended.\n\nthe LLU will report system status to control computer 1 on demand or at set times, as programmed from the control computer.\n\nFig. 2 is the physical installation diagram of an actual system and is representative of a typical medium size installation.\n\nthe installation consists of one LLU 101 and 4 RLUs (102,103,104, and 105) in Fig. 2.\n\nthe installation also includes thirteen sensors.\n\nthe sensors are numbered 105 through 113 in Fig. 2.\n\nthe installation utilizes five servos numbered 119 through 123 in Fig. 2.\n\nSensor 106 is a temperature sensor which is installed at the glycol feed into the glycol tower. It is a 4-20 mA output device, such as an Omega Inc. K Thermocouple. Sensor 107 is a fluid level sensor with 4-20mA output (Omega LV1101).\n\nSensor 108 is a flow meter used to meter the oil delivered out of the stock tank.\n\nSensor 109 is an overflow sensor (4-20mA output) capable of detecting when the stock tank is full and cannot store additional oil.\n\nSensor 110 is a fluid level sensor (4-20 mA) capable of detecting the level in the salt water tank of the salt water used for injection into the formation.\n\nSensor 111 is a pressure sensor (4-20 mA), such as Omega PX714, measuring the pressure of the water being injected into the formation. It is installed at the output of the injection pump.\n\nSensor 112 is a 4-20 mA sensor installed in the engine lubrication loop to monitor engine oil pressure.\n\nSensor 113 is a temperature sensor (4-20 mA), such as TX-72 by Omega Inc., installed on the treater to monitor treater temperature.\n\nSensor 114 is a 4-20 mA overflow sensor, such as LV3001 by Omega Inc., installed on the treater to sense an overflow condition.\n\nSensor 115 is an overheat sensor, such as TX-72 by Omega, installed on the treater to detect an overheating condition.\n\nSensor 115 is a pressure sensor (4-20mA) installed en the treater.\n\nSensor 117 is installed on the flare scrubber. It is a level sensor, such as LV1101 by Omega, determining the fluid level in the scrubber tower.\n\nSensor 118 is a temperature sensor (4-20mA) measuring the temperature of the flare.\n\nServo 119 is a 3 way mixing valve by NATCO Corp, driven by a 1/2 horsepower electric motor which can mix hot and cold glycol to achieve the desired temperature before it is sent to the glycol tower.\n\nServo 120 is a cut off switch which shorts the magneto of the salt water pump engine.\n\nServo 121 is a pneumatic valve Installed on the wellhead which can turn the oil flow off.\n\nServo 122 is a heater heating the treater unit .\n\nServo 123 is a relay which drives the lighting facilities at the Installation.\n\nthe operating range of the sensors and the response of the servos is loaded into the LLU and the four RLUs from the\n\nControl Computer The operation, operating ranges for the sensors and servos' responses are as described below.\n\nthe glycol heater temperature sensor 106 is connected to RLU 102.\n\nthe allowed operating range is 185F plus or minus 3F. As the temperature fails outside the normal range the electric motor of servo 119, activated by RLU 102, adjusts the 3-way mixing valve and the mix of hot and cold glycol to maintain the desired glycol temperature in the glycol tower.\n\nLiquid level sensor 107 is connected to RLU 103 and reports an empty oil tank condition.\n\nTurbine flow meter 106 measures the oil delivered out of the stock tank. Once delivery takes place RLU 102 monitors the delivery and the pre-loaded program converts the flow into barrels. The amount delivered is printed on site and relayed to the control computer.\n\nLevel overflow sensor 109 is installed on the stock tank and is connected to RLU 103.\n\nthe RLU is programmed to allow a maximum oil level of 15ft. When the oil level exceeds the allowed maximum, RLU 103 activates the engine cut off switch 120 and water injection in the field is discontinued. RLU 104 also activates the well head pneumatic valve 121 and shuts in the well. An alarm is printed on the printer connected to the LLU 1 and the LLU informs the control computer of the condition.\n\nthe operation of the salt water injection system is monitored and controlled by the salt water level sensor 109 and pressure sensor 110.\n\nthe pre-loaded program allows the tank level to be in a specified range. If the output of sensor 110 is within the pre-established limits, the injection pump is operating. If the sensor output is outside the defined range RLU 103 will shut off the injection engine by activating shut-off servo 120 which grounds the engine magneto.\n\nInjection pressure 111 is a pressure reading servo with 4-20 mA output. The allowed pressure range in psi, is pre-programmed. If operating injection pressure is within the allowed range operations are normal. If the injection pressure falls outside the allowed range, RLU 103 again activates shut off servo 120 and gives an alarm to the operator.\n\nthe treater is monitored by four sensors; 113,114,115 and 116. Sensors monitor are all 4 to 20 mA sensors and monitor temperature, overheat, overflow and pressure. The allowed range for the temperature sensor is 147 to 150 F.\n\nRLU 104 will activate servo 122 (heater) and the heater will operate until sensor 113 has an output within the allowed range. The heater is then turned off. If an overflow or an overheating condition is detected by 114 or 115 respectively, then the heater is turned off by RLU 104 and the LLU will give a written alarm to the operator.\n\nPressure sensor 116 monitors the pressure in the treater tank and alerts operator if pressure exceeds the preset allowed limit.\n\nthe flare scrubber has a level sensor 117. If liquid is detected above the allowed level, the well is shut in by the activation of well shut off servo 121 connected to RLU 104. The operation of the flare temperature sensor described in more detail in the description of Fig. 3.\n\nFig. 3 is the logic flow chart of the operation of one of the sensors, specifically the flare temperature sensor 118 of Fig. 2.\n\nthe flow chart indicates the interaction between the temperature sensor, the program logic loaded in the LLU and the RLU and the applicable servos consisting of the wellhead pneumatic valve (121 in Fig 2) and the site lighting system.\n\nthe flow chart details the system operation, at flare start-up which is the more complicated procedure.\n\na simplified flow chart applies during steady state operation.\n\nthe flare is ignited (Block 201).\n\nthe system automatically waits for a preprogrammed period of approximately S minutes to allow the flare temperature to heat up (Block 202).\n\nthe RLU 105 to which the flare temperature sensor is connected monitors the temperature (Block 203). If the temperature is within range no further action is taken (Block 205). If the temperature is not in range the flare is pulsed and after one minute (Block 204) the temperature is monitored again by the RLU for temperature increase (Block 206). If temperature is increasing it is checked again for proper range (Block 205) and if it is within range the system takes no further action. If the temperature is not within range the process is repeated. If temperature is not increasing the RLU activates three servos.\n\nServo 121 (wellhead pneumatic valve) is activated and shuts the well in (Block 208).\n\nthe location lights are turned on if the emergency occurs at night (Block 209) and the injection pump engine is shut off.\n\nthe RLU via the LLU also informs (Block 210) the control computer (Block 213) via telephone (212), and prints the emergency condition locally for the operator (Block 211). Similar logic flow diagrams would be applicable for the other sensors and servos.\n\nLandscapes\n\nEngineering & Computer Science (AREA)\n\nLife Sciences & Earth Sciences (AREA)\n\nGeology (AREA)\n\nMining & Mineral Resources (AREA)\n\nEnvironmental & Geological Engineering (AREA)\n\nPhysics & Mathematics (AREA)\n\nFluid Mechanics (AREA)\n\nGeneral Life Sciences & Earth Sciences (AREA)\n\nGeochemistry & Mineralogy (AREA)\n\nTesting And Monitoring For Control Systems (AREA)\n\nSelective Calling Equipment (AREA)\n\nAbstract\n\nAn oil/gas field system for monitoring certain characteristics in an oil and/or gas field and for controlling certain operating equipment in the field containing: a sensor (9) measuring the characteristic and for generating a signal (8) corresponding to a value of the characteristic; servo devices (11) for controlling the operation of the equipment; programmable logic (5) connected to a certain number of said sensors (9) for receiving the signals (8) of the sensors (9), the logic device (5) having outputs connected to the servo devices (11) for automatically changing the status of said equipment controlled by the servo devices when the input electrical signals are outside some allowed range remedy a non-complying condition of the equipment; and control computer remote from but connected to the logic for establishing the allowed ranges in the logic and for establishing control signals in the logic device for controlling the output of the logic device to the servo means.\n\nDescription\n\nMONTTORING AND CONTROL OF OIL/GAS FTELDS\n\nBackground of the Invention\n\nThe present invention relates to an site and remote monitoring and control of oil and gas operation.\n\nOil and gas production installations are typically monitored and controlled by installing an site standard sensor devices, such as pressure gages, flow meters, overflow indicators, vibration switches, etc. on the equipment. Operators can thus determine the status of the production equipment and wells by visually checking the sensing devices. The sensor devices connected to critical equipment are usually wired directly or through electromechanical relays to shut off control devices which can interrupt the operation of non complying equipment or shut off the whole production facility if dangerous conditions occur. During normal operation the operator has to read the various gages or sensor devices and make the appropriate manual adjustments an well valves, production equipment controls, etc. to maintain the oil or gas well or field within acceptable operating parameters.\n\nThe number of sensor and control devices is a function of the\n\ncomplexity of the installation, operating requirements, the prevailing operating practices of the field operator and the need to comply with statutory safety requirements.\n\nIt is relatively common, even in the simplest installations, to have a number of cut-off sensors (such as stock tank overflows, engine oil level and pressure, etc.) which disable or turn off some of the equipment or shut off the well when the parameters monitored exceed critical levels. In more sophisticated installations the outputs of some or all of the sensor devices are brought to a central panel where the operator can monitor the operation of the field and the equipment. This avoids the need to gather information on location and the operator can perform his duties more rapidly by only going to the locations or equipment needing intervention.\n\nA further level of automation is added when servo controls; i.e.\n\nelectric motors, pneumatic activators, rheostats, etc., are added to key equipment or wells and can be activated by the operator from a remote location (i.e. the panel room) and bring the operation of the equipment into compliance. More sophisticated installations use control theory techniques and open or closed loop circuits to drive, with a function of the output of the sensor device or devices, the servo systems controlling the equipment until the value of the condition monitored returns to acceptable levels.\n\nMuch more complex and expensive monitoring control systems are also in use. SCADA. (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems available commercially and utilized mostly in off-shore operations are capable of monitoring remote operations through sensors which report to a central monitoring location through a communication satellite link. In a SCADA installation the sensor and control devices must be programmed on site. In case of a non-complying condition, the output of the on location sensor is relayed, via satellite, to the central monitoring location. At the central location a processor or the human element makes a decision on a corrective action which is then relayed, again via the satellite link, to the remote location servos.\n\nIn the present invention the outputs of commercially available or custom analog or digital sensors are connected to one or more commercially available programmable logic units. The outputs of the logic units are connected to either commercially available or custom servo mechanisms which respond to the output of the logic units as a function of the output of the sensor devices and thus can take action on the monitored equipment to comply with the preprogrammed instruction. Once the monitoring devices are connected to the inputs of the programmable logic units and the servo mechanisms are connected to the output of said programmable logic units, the operator can program both the compliance intervals for each sensor and the desired response by each servo from a commercially available control computer and software which is connected to the programmable logic units either through a telephone link or a digital data link. The programmable logic units will be capable of both monitoring and automatically\n\ncorrecting the non complying condition or shutting down the equipment without need of operator intervention or the need to communicate with a remote control location such as in the SCADA system. The system is thus immune from failure in the communication link and greatly improves safety and reliability. Once the programmable logic unit has taken an action, it can be programmed to report the event both on site and in the\n\ncommunication link to the control computer. The programmable logic unit is also capable of reporting system status on a recurring basis and log the output of all sensor devices for later analysis. Given the almost total flexibility in the number and type of sensor devices, servo devices and the programmability of the interaction between the two sets of services, the system is capable of monitoring and controlling automatically essentially all phases of an oil or gas production facility.\n\nSummary of the Invention\n\nOne object of the invention is to monitor the operating parameters of an oil or gas production facility and control its operation through the use of existing sensors, servo devices and programmable logic units.\n\nAnother object of the invention is to allow the operator the\n\nflexibility of changing operating parameters by making changes through a software program without need to change the hardware installation on the production facility.\n\nA further object of the invention is to receive status reports on the operation in an efficient and economical manner.\n\nAn additional object of the invention is to be able to change the operating parameters of the installation from a remote location through commercially available software and hardware.\n\nIn the preferred embodiment, the foregoing objects are achieved by the means described below.\n\nSensor devices with analog output meeting the standard 4-20 mA output or on/off sensor devices are installed conventionally throughout the oil or gas production according to operating and safety requirements. The output of such devices is connected to a local programmable logic unit (\"LLU\") such as the Novar Controls Corporation Executive Processor or Controller. The LLU is equipped with a number of input ports which can interface with the output of the sensor devices. As shown in Fig. 1 each sensor devices axe connected to a corresponding input port of the LLU. Given the physical input bus limitation which exist in the LLU, if additional sensor devices need to be monitored, the system is expanded by connecting, via a standard RS485 connector, the LLU to one or more remote logic units (\"RLU\") such as the Novar Input/Output modules. The\n\npossibility of adding RLUs allows to increase the number of monitored points and the number of control devices to handle even the most complex installations.\n\nThe LLU is equipped, among others, with internal clock, RCM memories for its management and RAM memories for the acceptance of operational instructions (setting of RAM logic states) which can be, inputted, via an internal telephone module or a data link, from a control computer typically located at the home office. The control computer, such as the Engineering Support System of Novar Corporation, is a personal computer or mini computer containing proprietary interface equipment and software capable of loading the operational parameters required by the\n\ninstallation into the RAM memories of the LLU. In larger installations requiring RLUs, the instruction for the RAM memories of the RLUs is transferred from the control computer to the LLU RAMs which then transfers the instructions to the RLUs RAMs via the RS485 bus. RLUs can thus communicate back and forth with the LLU but not directly with the control computers. The LLU and the RLUs can thus be programmed to perform the following function:\n\n1.) Data Logging. The LLU and RLUs read the output of the sensor devices, store it and can transmit the data, via the communication link to the control computer. The data is also available on site through a control panel and display installed on the LLU.\n\n2.) Fault Detection. Both the LLU and the RLUs can be programmed to detect a fault condition which exists when the output of a sensor device falls outside a preprogrammed allowable range. When a faulty or non complying condition is detected, the unit detecting the non complying signal, will respond according to the programmed instruction by activating one of its outputs connected to the appropriate servo device.\n\n3.) Corrective Action. The local and remote logic units are capable of two types of output:\n\na. on/off a.c. voltage.\n\nb. pulse modulated a.c. voltage.\n\nThe on/off a.c. voltage can be used to activate a servo, such as a shut-off pneumatic valve to shut off the well or a cut off switch to kill an engine if the non complying condition requires such action.\n\nThe pulse modulated a.c. voltage is a function of the value of the sensor output and thus can be utilized in a closed loop circuit to drive a servo mechanism which will act on the process until the sensor output has returned within the allowed operating range.\n\n4.) Reporting Function. The local logic unit can be programmed to report to the control computer, via the communication link, either at preset time intervals or upon occurrence of a non complying condition, the status of the system. Both the on site operator and the operator of the control computer can poll the LLU to determine system status.\n\nSince the system does not depend an the functionality of the\n\ncommunication link to operate once it is programmed and all decisions are made an site by the LLU or the RLUs, reliability and safety are greatly improved.\n\nThe system capability to accept both digital (on/off) or analog inputs and to be programmed for both on/off and analog (proportional) output signals makes it possible to essentially monitor all phases of the operation and take all manners of corrective action for a total or partial operation management, as desired by the operator.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nFig. 1. Is a block diagram of an. installation including all types of input and output which can be included in the system.\n\nFig. 2 Is the representation of an actual installation in the field.\n\nFig. 3 Is the flow chart of the control logic activated by one of the sensors.\n\nDESCRIFTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT\n\nFig. 1 is the block diagram of the interconnection of a typical system showing the basic system components according to the preferred embodiment. Control Computer 1 is a commercially available computer, such as the Novar Corporation Engineering Support System which contains buffer hardware and specialized software to control the system. The control computer is connected to a video display 2 and, if desired, can be connected with a compatible printer 3. Components 1,2, and 3 can be located anywhere access to a telephone line is available.\n\nThe control computer is connected, via a telephone link 4 to the balance of the system which is installed on the location to be monitored and controlled.\n\nLLU 5, which is a commercially available logic processor, is connected, via an internal modem and link 4, to the control computer 1. LLU 5 may also be connected, via an RS485 bus 6, to one or more RLUs 7. The addition of RLU units, which are commercially available programmable logic units, such as the Novar Corporation Input/Output modules, allows the system to be expanded to handle all of the monitoring and control functions necessary in the installation.\n\nBoth the LLU and RLU units are connected, via input buses 8 with monitoring sensors 9. The sensors are installed on the equipment to be monitored. The number of sensors which can be connected to each unit is typically limited to eight. Said sensors can either be of the on/off type or commercially available 4-20 mA output analog sensors.\n\nThe LLU and RLU units are also connected via output buses 10 to servos 11. These commercially available devices can be on/off devices or proportional analog devices. The servos are also installed on the equipment. Depending en the instructions received from the LLU or the RLUs, they either shut off or alter controls or settings on the controlled equipment. The LLU may also be connected, via a data bus 12 to a local printer.13. Once the installation is complete, the operator sets the normal operating parameters for ail sensors in the control computer. This sets the complying and noncomplying output range for all the sensors in the installation. Next the operator sets the desired response for all servo units 11 as a function of the output of sensors 9. Thus the total response and interaction of sensors and servos is established. The logic level settings in the control computer are then loaded into the LLU 5 via telephone link 4. The LLU transfers the logic levels to the RLUs via data bus 6. The installation is then fully programmed and operational. The LLU and RLUs need no further instructions from control computer 1 and will perform all monitoring and controls unattended. The LLU will report system status to control computer 1 on demand or at set times, as programmed from the control computer.\n\nFig. 2 is the physical installation diagram of an actual system and is representative of a typical medium size installation. The installation consists of one LLU 101 and 4 RLUs (102,103,104, and 105) in Fig. 2.\n\nThe installation also includes thirteen sensors. The sensors are numbered 105 through 113 in Fig. 2. In addition the installation utilizes five servos numbered 119 through 123 in Fig. 2.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF SENSORS\n\nSensor 106 is a temperature sensor which is installed at the glycol feed into the glycol tower. It is a 4-20 mA output device, such as an Omega Inc. K Thermocouple. Sensor 107 is a fluid level sensor with 4-20mA output (Omega LV1101).\n\nSensor 108 is a flow meter used to meter the oil delivered out of the stock tank. Sensor 109 is an overflow sensor (4-20mA output) capable of detecting when the stock tank is full and cannot store additional oil. Sensor 110 is a fluid level sensor (4-20 mA) capable of detecting the level in the salt water tank of the salt water used for injection into the formation. Sensor 111 is a pressure sensor (4-20 mA), such as Omega PX714, measuring the pressure of the water being injected into the formation. It is installed at the output of the injection pump. Sensor 112 is a 4-20 mA sensor installed in the engine lubrication loop to monitor engine oil pressure. Sensor 113 is a temperature sensor (4-20 mA), such as TX-72 by Omega Inc., installed on the treater to monitor treater temperature. Sensor 114 is a 4-20 mA overflow sensor, such as LV3001 by Omega Inc., installed on the treater to sense an overflow condition. Sensor 115 is an overheat sensor, such as TX-72 by Omega, installed on the treater to detect an overheating condition. Sensor 115 is a pressure sensor (4-20mA) installed en the treater. Sensor 117 is installed on the flare scrubber. It is a level sensor, such as LV1101 by Omega, determining the fluid level in the scrubber tower. Sensor 118 is a temperature sensor (4-20mA) measuring the temperature of the flare.\n\nSERVOS DESCRIPTION\n\nServo 119 is a 3 way mixing valve by NATCO Corp, driven by a 1/2 horsepower electric motor which can mix hot and cold glycol to achieve the desired temperature before it is sent to the glycol tower. Servo 120 is a cut off switch which shorts the magneto of the salt water pump engine. Servo 121 is a pneumatic valve Installed on the wellhead which can turn the oil flow off. Servo 122 is a heater heating the treater unit . Servo 123 is a relay which drives the lighting facilities at the Installation.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF OPERATION\n\nThe operating range of the sensors and the response of the servos is loaded into the LLU and the four RLUs from the\n\nControl Computer. The operation, operating ranges for the sensors and servos' responses are as described below.\n\nThe glycol heater temperature sensor 106 is connected to RLU 102. The allowed operating range is 185F plus or minus 3F. As the temperature fails outside the normal range the electric motor of servo 119, activated by RLU 102, adjusts the 3-way mixing valve and the mix of hot and cold glycol to maintain the desired glycol temperature in the glycol tower.\n\nLiquid level sensor 107 is connected to RLU 103 and reports an empty oil tank condition.\n\nTurbine flow meter 106 measures the oil delivered out of the stock tank. Once delivery takes place RLU 102 monitors the delivery and the pre-loaded program converts the flow into barrels. The amount delivered is printed on site and relayed to the control computer.\n\nLevel overflow sensor 109 is installed on the stock tank and is connected to RLU 103. The RLU is programmed to allow a maximum oil level of 15ft. When the oil level exceeds the allowed maximum, RLU 103 activates the engine cut off switch 120 and water injection in the field is discontinued. RLU 104 also activates the well head pneumatic valve 121 and shuts in the well. An alarm is printed on the printer connected to the LLU 1 and the LLU informs the control computer of the condition.\n\nThe operation of the salt water injection system (secondary recovery) is monitored and controlled by the salt water level sensor 109 and pressure sensor 110. The pre-loaded program allows the tank level to be in a specified range. If the output of sensor 110 is within the pre-established limits, the injection pump is operating. If the sensor output is outside the defined range RLU 103 will shut off the injection engine by activating shut-off servo 120 which grounds the engine magneto. Injection pressure 111 is a pressure reading servo with 4-20 mA output. The allowed pressure range in psi, is pre-programmed. If operating injection pressure is within the allowed range operations are normal. If the injection pressure falls outside the allowed range, RLU 103 again activates shut off servo 120 and gives an alarm to the operator.\n\nThe treater is monitored by four sensors; 113,114,115 and 116. Sensors monitor are all 4 to 20 mA sensors and monitor temperature, overheat, overflow and pressure. The allowed range for the temperature sensor is 147 to 150 F. At startup RLU 104 will activate servo 122 (heater) and the heater will operate until sensor 113 has an output within the allowed range. The heater is then turned off. If an overflow or an overheating condition is detected by 114 or 115 respectively, then the heater is turned off by RLU 104 and the LLU will give a written alarm to the operator. Pressure sensor 116 monitors the pressure in the treater tank and alerts operator if pressure exceeds the preset allowed limit.\n\nThe flare scrubber has a level sensor 117. If liquid is detected above the allowed level, the well is shut in by the activation of well shut off servo 121 connected to RLU 104. The operation of the flare temperature sensor described in more detail in the description of Fig. 3.\n\nFig. 3 is the logic flow chart of the operation of one of the sensors, specifically the flare temperature sensor 118 of Fig. 2. The flow chart indicates the interaction between the temperature sensor, the program logic loaded in the LLU and the RLU and the applicable servos consisting of the wellhead pneumatic valve (121 in Fig 2) and the site lighting system. The flow chart details the system operation, at flare start-up which is the more complicated procedure. A simplified flow chart applies during steady state operation.\n\nAt start-up the flare is ignited (Block 201). The system automatically waits for a preprogrammed period of approximately S minutes to allow the flare temperature to heat up (Block 202). After such time the RLU 105 to which the flare temperature sensor is connected monitors the temperature (Block 203). If the temperature is within range no further action is taken (Block 205). If the temperature is not in range the flare is pulsed and after one minute (Block 204) the temperature is monitored again by the RLU for temperature increase (Block 206). If temperature is increasing it is checked again for proper range (Block 205) and if it is within range the system takes no further action. If the temperature is not within range the process is repeated. If temperature is not increasing the RLU activates three servos. Servo 121 (wellhead pneumatic valve) is activated and shuts the well in (Block 208). The location lights are turned on if the emergency occurs at night (Block 209) and the injection pump engine is shut off. The RLU, via the LLU also informs (Block 210) the control computer (Block 213) via telephone (212), and prints the emergency condition locally for the operator (Block 211). Similar logic flow diagrams would be applicable for the other sensors and servos.\n\nThe preferred embodiment of the invention has been described above, but variations and modifications within the spirit of the invention may occur to those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains.\n\nClaims\n\nWHAT IS CLAIMED IS:\n\n1.
