        "text": "US manufacturer of building automation systems\n\nAlerton (sometimes misspelled \"Allerton\") is a United States company based in Lynnwood, Washington. It is a manufacturer of building automation systems for heating, ventilation and air conditioning HVAC equipment.\n\nThe company was founded in 1981 in Bellevue by three entrepreneurs from whom the company's name was derived: Al Lucas, Clair Jenkins and Tony Fassbind.[3] Lucas was Jenkin's father-in-law; Fassbind was the company's chief executive officer and chief technologist; while Jenkin's succeeded Lucas as president after his retirement, and serviced as the lead business developer.[3]\n\nAlerton's entry into the building automation systems market was through the application of direct digital controls in their products, a technology which had in the early 1980s been largely overlooked by the market's major players.[3] The company developed their own control protocol, Ibex, and transitioned to using the license-free BACnet protocol beginning in 1995; in adopting BACnet, the company became the first to implement this protocol across an entire product line in the controls industry.[3]\n\nAlerton was acquired by the UK building supplies company Novar in 2003; as part of the acquisition, \"Alerton Technologies\" became \"Alerton\", a wholly owned subsidiary of Novar Controls and part of Novar's Intelligent Building Systems division.[4][5] The acquisition was aimed at being a growth opportunity for both firms, and Novar recognized Alerton as \"a pioneer in the development of the BACnet protocol\".[4]\n\nAlerton became part of Honeywell in 2005 when its parent company, Novar, was acquired.[6][7] In Honeywell, Alerton is part of the company's Automation and Controls group.[8]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Alerton, Inc.: Private Company Information\".
