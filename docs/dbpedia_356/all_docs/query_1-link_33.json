        "text": "N2 ASC – This product line has been the Metasys field controller offering to the market since 1990. Its simplicity, expandability and reliability is what made this product the popular choice for so many contractors and End Users over the years. Because of this, Metasys is one of the largest installed systems in the market, and if you haven't come across this system yet, you will!\n\nBACnet MS/TP – As the HVAC industry progresses, \"Open\" protocol systems have become the \"norm\". Johnson Metasys now offers, for both new construction and retrofit, the next level of field controllers. Features never offered before by both Johnson Controls or their competitors, along with technologies of today, are brought together for what clearly is now the new standard for control hardware and software for the industry. If you want cutting edge, power and price, you'll find it all in the new Metasys Field Equipment Controllers(FEC).\n\nSupervisory Controllers – Reqardless of the Metasys field controllers used, a common Supervisory Controller is used. The Network Automation Engine (NAE), and its little brother, the Network Control Engine (NCE), are the \"Windows\" into your system. Web Browser technology makes it simple and effective to access your system locally or remotely, via dial-up or Internet. The NAE is the direct replacement for all legacy Supervisory controllers manufactured by Johnson Controls such as the NCM, NCU, Companion, Facilitator or N30/N31.\n\nN2 ASC – This product line has been the Metasys field controller offering to the market since 1990. Its simplicity, expandability and reliability is what made this product the popular choice for so many contractors and End Users over the years. It is also compatible with FX Supervisory Controllers for a Web Browser experience.\n\nBACnet MS/TP – The new \"PCG\" series field controllers are actually a re-branded Metasys FEC Field Controller. This means they've been proven for years, but now allow for complete integration with Tridium Supervisory Controllers offered by JCI called FX! Features never offered before by both Johnson Controls or their competitors, along with technologies of today, are brought together for what clearly is now the new standard for control hardware and software for the industry.\n\nSupervisory Controllers – Regardless of the field controllers used (N2, BACnet), a common Supervisory Controller is used. The new FX Supervisory Controllers are engineered with the PCG controllers to provide an integrated BAS solution like no other. Web Browser technology makes it simple and effective to access your system locally or remotely, via dial-up or Internet. The FX is the direct replacement for all legacy Supervisory controllers manufactured by Johnson Controls such as the NAE, NCM, NCU, Companion, Facilitator or N30/N31. The FX can also be used to replace competitive systems using their proprietary protocol. Systems such as Novar, American Automatrix, Barber-Colman and Siemens for example can all communicate with an FX Controller and provide the Web Browser interface you've been after."
