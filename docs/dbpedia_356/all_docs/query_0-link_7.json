        "text": "Opus Magnum Supervisor is an enterprise application designed to connect thousands of building level automation systems into a single Opus Magnum BAS.\n\nOpus Magnum Supervisor includes data collection services to collect BAS alerts and point histories with batch functionality that enables central management of system parameters. Opus enables you to initiate control setting and schedule changes across an entire portfolio in minutes.\n\nThe Opus Magnum Data Aggregator enables the collection of data from 3rd party or other Non-Opus devices into the Opus Magnum Supervisor.\n\nAfter successful import, alarm and history data will be collected from Logic One devices and then made viewable from the Opus Magnum Supervisor. Advanced functionality, such as batch set-point and schedule changes, is also possible.\n\nTypically required for larger deployments with higher data collection requirements or for the management of energy meters, Opus Magnum Data Manager helps provide scalability in deployments by managing alarm, history and energy data.\n\nOpus Magnum Data Manager (ODM) is designed to offload functions related to managing alarms, history and energy data from the Opus Magnum Supervisor. ODM collects data directly from Opus Magnum Executives in addition to compatible Modbus TCP/IP meters and\n\nwrites the data to the designated database(s)."
