Historically, facilities managers have worked with distinct systems to manage properties. However, buildings have become so large and the underlying technology so complex that overseeing all of the different components has been difficult. Facilities managers have been searching for more integrated approaches toward delivering services to tenants. Building automation technology ties all of the different elements (e.g., building management systems; heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC); energy management; lighting; security) into a cohesive whole. The goal of this report is to provide an understanding of the market factors, state-of-the-art developments, and economic influences driving the building automation market. The study analyzes the different components of the industry, the influence of networking technology on building automation, and the impact of the different components in various world markets such as Europe, North America, Asia (including Australia), and the rest of the world.\n\nThe study contains information that is useful for planning production and the targeting of market efforts for the delivery of building automation systems as well integration with other systems. Trends in building automation are investigated, particularly the increasing emphasis on energy management, the growing need for security systems, and the impact of computer technology on facilities management. Attention is focused on markets for buildings larger than single-family homes. Projections are provided for the total building automation market through 2016, along with estimates of the market in terms of dollar revenue for each type of automation (i.e., building management system (BMS), HVAC, energy management, lighting and security) alone and the cumulative totals for the market overall. Forecasts are provided to quantify the differences between revenues for equipment (e.g., hardware, software, networks) and for consulting services, which include such facets as design and consultation work, installation, training, commissioning, operations, and maintenance.\n\nTraditionally, the equipment portion of these sales represented the largest opportunity. Currently, however, suppliers have been focusing more on services, which provide ongoing revenue streams, as opposed to equipment sales, which represent one-time purchases.\n\nREASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY\n\nSeveral forces are driving trends toward increasing levels of automation of systems that provide essential services in buildings, as well as the centralization of controls for these systems. Higher levels of automation are essential for maintaining the profitability of commercial buildings, controlling the operating costs of all buildings, and ensuring competitiveness of buildings in areas where tenants have other options for residence. The development, proliferation and flexibility of microprocessor-based controls, interface devices, distributed actuators, standardized network protocols, computerized interfaces, and wireless communications have presented an opportunity for highly automated centralized building control systems.\n\nBuilding automation systems are usually installed at the onset of construction in new buildings, and integration suites are becoming increasingly common in major renovations where new systems such as structured cabling are being put into place. This study explores national and international building codes and standards, the major manufacturers of building automation equipment and component systems, and the technologies involved in those systems.\n\nStandardized network protocols, interfaces, personal computers (PCs), handheld wireless devices, and distributed touch pads are providing the primary human interface elements for building automation systems. The strength of the world building automation market relies on the health of local or regional construction markets. This, in turn, depends on world, regional, and national economies.\n\nConsequently, sales of these BMS products have been largely seen in the world's more advanced business epicenters: Europe, the U.S., China and Japan. This study analyzes the most prominent markets for these systems and breaks it down into four sections: Europe, North America, Asia (including Australia), and South America and Africa. The market's economic potential is framed in the context of the construction market for each area examined and then consolidated to provide a complete picture of the market. The total market is segmented into four building types: office buildings, industrial buildings, multi-tenant housing, and retail properties, including hotels.\n\nExtensive investigations have also been carried out to quantify the size of the market in five areas: HVAC, lighting, energy management, security, and BMS. This was done to aid marketers, manufacturers, system integrators, contractors, and other parties involved in the building automation industry to better direct their efforts at presenting their products and services to the most promising markets.\n\nSCOPE OF REPORT\n\nBuilding automation systems for commercial, office, institutional, and high-rise residential buildings involve a suite of components that include (in alphabetical order):\n\nBMS systems.\n\nEnvironmental controls (HVAC).\n\nEnergy management.\n\nLighting management.\n\nSecurity and access control.\n\nThis report examines technologies, markets, and factors influencing the markets for integrated control systems and systems that integrate the controls of various subsystems. Markets are forecast on the basis of historic activity and current opportunities, government initiatives and policies, and the status of the construction and renovation industries in specific nations.\n\nThe forecasts presented are for the total available markets. Some discussion is provided that compares actual revenues with market potential on various continents. Markets are broken down on a geographic basis and discussed within the context of the trends in construction activity, regulatory initiatives, and the revenue potential associated with building automation systems.\n\nThe bulk of the revenue comes from the world's three largest markets: Europe, North America, and Asia. A detailed analysis of the building automation market potential in these geopolitical economic regions is used as a basis for estimating world markets for these products. Thorough analyses are carried out on construction industry practices in the target regions. Trends toward the uptake of building automation products and costs are examined, along with associated laws, regulations, and common practices.\n\nIdentification has also been made of the prime party in the project chain that makes the decision on which and to what extent a building automation configuration is selected for a building project. Geographic and environmental factors influencing requirements for the systems are examined, as are national and international responses to global environmental challenges.\n\nINTENDED AUDIENCE\n\nThis report was prepared for individuals who are interested in the building management system market. Those individuals could include vendors involved in the research, development, manufacturing, or marketing of these products. The report will help these individuals evaluate market trends and respond to market changes so that they can perform more effectively in their organizations. In addition, commercial facilities managers may find the report useful because they can use the information to determine the steps they need to take to ensure that their services remain competitive. Lastly, financial analysts can benefit from the report. They will be able to determine the market potential for various products and evaluate the performance of various vendors in this space.\n\nMETHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES\n\nBoth primary and secondary research methodologies were used in preparing this report. Information was obtained from a wide variety of sources, including interviews with manufacturer executives, inventors, engineers, and marketers; government legislators and regulators; construction industry representatives; purchasing officers; building management firm representatives; and real estate development company representatives. Much of the market research numbers came from company financial reports and interviews with suppliers who outlined various market trends and company initiatives. Extensive use was made of the Internet, industry trade publications, and print media. Digital and printed statistics were gathered to quantify and help verify trends in the level of activity within the various market sectors.\n\nThe approach taken to quantify the world markets for integrated business management systems involved several steps. Primary among these was delineating the technologies involved in building automation and the companies that produce them. The focus is on systems that have been tied together in some way rather than stand-alone building automation systems. Because the market is evolving, clear boundaries among various categories can be difficult to discern. Autonomous product categories have been shifting, as suppliers have been trying to deliver a more cohesive and integrated approach to building management. In addition, vendors have been broadening their product lines, such that many offer products in numerous categories. In some cases, vendors bundle systems together to entice potential developers; therefore, categorizing the revenue from different types of products can be difficult. Consultations with various companies and industry experts helped to break those categories down as finely as possible.\n\nAnother step involved developing a quantitative understanding of the characteristics of nonresidential construction industries in different regions of the world. In addition, assessments were made of regulatory policies governing each region with respect to requirements for building automation systems. This was done with varying degrees of granularity, keeping in mind that special codes are enforced in different nations. The intrinsic goals of regulatory encouragement of such buildings are fourfold:\n\nMinimization of environmental demands of the building.\n\nMaximization of the productivity of persons using the buildings.\n\nCost control through labor reduction and energy-efficient operation.\n\nValue enhancement for building owners.\n\nA summary understanding of the markets was developed for component systems of various building automation systems. With this information in hand, trade publications and Internet searches were performed, along with interviews with industry representatives, regulators, and legislators to discern trends in the extent of implementation of fully-integrated building automation systems.\n\nAttention was also paid to activity in the markets for systems that integrate disparate component systems. In this regard, networking and data transfer capabilities of the product lines of various component system vendors were taken as an indication of manufacturers' thrust toward integrated, or integratable, systems.\n\nRevenue from the various building automation products comes from two sources. New construction is one source. Analysts estimate that building automation elements account for 2.5% to 3.5% of the total construction project value for new buildings. The revenue includes both equipment and services. In addition, owners decide to renovate their buildings to make them more attractive to current and potential customers. Because new building construction is such an expensive proposition, the bulk of the revenue from building automation comes from renovations. For this report, building automation revenue was divided into equipment sales and consulting services associated with these projects. The market for these products is shifting, with equipment accounting for a smaller percentage of a vendor's revenue and consulting services accounting for a higher percentage. Consequentially, suppliers are not only trying to develop strong products, but they are also building up their distribution channels.\n\nThe world economy has become increasing complex, volatile, and difficult to forecast. The financial numbers in this report came from projections from various economic monitoring groups, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the CIA World Fact Book. Input from these various sectors was used to complete the five-year market projections. All revenues are expressed in U.S. dollars.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund projects that worldwide revenue will increase from about $79.0 trillion in 2011 to $103.4 trillion in 2016, representing a growth rate of 4.6%. However, the numbers will be distributed quite unevenly. The Asian, South American, and African markets will demonstrate the highest growth rates. At 8.2%, China's growth is reshaping the world economy as well as the BMS market. Vendors are aggressively moving into that marketplace to take advantage of the high growth.\n\nABB has a joint venture with Xiamen Electrical Co., which was founded in 1993. Xiamen Genway is a leading player in China's intelligent building industry, producing intelligent door entry and control systems and home automation systems. ABB is working with Xiamen Genway Security Technology Development Co. to provide advanced door entry systems to businesses worldwide.\n\nEchelon Corp., a pioneer in control networking and a supplier of technology used with the LonWorks control networking platform, works with Tsinghua Tongfang Co. Ltd., one of China's largest supplier of building automation and network integration solutions. The two have worked together to deliver Tsinghua Tongfang's branded building automation products and solutions in China based upon Echelon's technology.\n\nCarrier Corp. signed a joint venture agreement with Sinostride Technology Co. Ltd., a leading extra-low voltage (ELV) contractor in East China serving the building automation market. The company has played a key role in projects such as the China Petro Building, Zhejiang University, the Suzhou Modern Building, the Chongqing International Exhibition Center, and Kunming International Airport.\n\nHoneywell, one of the world's largest building management companies, and Haier Group, a Chinese home appliance supplier, are collaborating on developing high-energy-efficiency solutions. The two global giants are working to develop building automation, home energy management, and mass transit that is \"more efficient and cleaner.\"\n\nIn addition, new and emerging markets are showing high growth as governments try to become more industrialized in order to increase income and raise their standard of living. The U.S. market continues to grow, but at a slower rate (3.6%) than the world overall, according to the IMF. The European marketplace is plodding along, with a 2.5% annual growth rate, according to the IMF. Consequently, the old guard BMS suppliers need to be on watch. They need to expand into new markets while continuing to serve their traditional customers.\n\nThe long-term projections are extremely tenuous. The world economy has become much more interconnected and much more volatile than it was in the past. Problems, such as the solvency issue in Greece, ripple throughout other countries' economies. Many possible problems loom on the horizon. In addition, there is concern that high-flying markets, such China, may slow and force suppliers to take erasers to their business plans. Terrorism also remains a worldwide concern. Any future attack will probably have an adverse impact on the world's gross national product (GNP). Therefore, while the forecast is for a growth of 4.3%, that number could possibly be lower, depending on how world events unfold.\n\nANALYST CREDENTIALS\n\nWith more than two decades of experience, Paul Korzeniowski is a market research analyst and building automation consultant.
