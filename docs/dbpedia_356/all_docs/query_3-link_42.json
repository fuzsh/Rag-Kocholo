        "text": "Honeywell International, the diversified manufacturer that is the world's top maker of cockpit electronics, agreed yesterday to buy Novar, a British industrial holding company, in a deal that was expected to be about £798 million ($1.53 billion), according to individuals close to the deal.\n\nNovar, a small conglomerate, had faced a hostile takeover of £745 million from Melrose, a smaller rival based in London.\n\nNovar executives had rejected the Melrose offer and had sought another buyer.\n\nAs part of its defensive strategy, earlier reports said that Novar would consider selling shares in the United States of its check-printing business if it was unable to sell the group.\n\nThe Sunday Telegraph in London said that Honeywell had been one of four contenders for Novar, which included the German industrial giant Siemens; the French group Schneider Electric; and General Electric, the American industrial giant."
