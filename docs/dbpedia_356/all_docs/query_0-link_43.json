        "text": "Upfront Cost Savings:$53,000\n\nBuilding Floors:9\n\nEmployees In Building:1,700\n\nLEED Certification:Silver\n\nWhen Quintiles Transnational Corporation, the world’s largest pharmaceutical services company, built their new headquarters building, they selected Piedmont Service Group to provide mechanical services and building automation systems for LEED certification.\n\nSome unique energy efficient features of the building include an optimized waterside economizer, energy recovery units and integration of computer room precision cooling units into the BMS system. Quintiles earned an additional LEED point by installing an energy recovery ventilator (ERV) unit in lieu of dedicated CO2 monitoring equipment. The ERV recaptures heat using an air-to-air heat exchanger, saving energy in the facility; it reduced upfront installation costs by $53,000. Piedmont also equipped the building with a BACnet open protocol web-based energy management system. This allows facilities staff and mechanical engineers to remotely monitor and troubleshoot the building systems and communicate with equipment and lighting control systems.\n\nSq. Foot Facility :97k\n\nVaccine Doses/Month:10M\n\nContinuous Monitoring System:TREND\n\nMedicago recently built a new facility in Research Triangle Park (RTP), North Carolina. This Virus-Like-Particle plant-based vaccine facility includes a fully automated greenhouse, customized infiltration systems, and a state of the art extraction and purification unit. The 97,000-square-foot facility is targeted to produce 10 million doses of pandemic influenza vaccine per month. Medicago partnered with Piedmont Service Group to install the facility's mission critical greenhouse and office area HVAC systems as well as a TREND building automation & energy management system. In addition, Piedmont Service Group provides ongoing maintenance services to Medicago to ensure these systems operate as efficiently and effectively as possible.\n\nAnnual Gas Savings:20%\n\nBuildings In Complex:8\n\nArea (Square Feet):264k\n\nThe B/E Aerospace facility is an eight-building complex in North Carolina taking up more than 264,000 square feet of manufacturing floor space. Housing the company’s Seating Products and Design Studio division, the needs of this manufacturing are constantly changing.\n\nExisting equipment was already 20 years old when they elected to partner with Piedmont for equipment maintenance over 10 years ago. 80% of the original equipment is still under contract and operating today (at 30 years old!). With every retrofit project, B/E Aerospace has recognized significant energy and operational savings. Automated Facility Solutions (AFS), a division of Piedmont Service Group, designed and installed a flexible HVAC control and energy management system using a single type of controller, keeping upfront costs to a minimum. As the aging HVAC equipment is replaced, B/E Aerospace maintenance staff can easily modify the controllers to reflect the new energy management and control strategies.\n\nAnnual Energy Savings:$11,200\n\nAnnual Energy Savings:20%\n\nReturn On Investment:16.5%\n\nENERGY STAR Rating:87\n\nEagle Transport has been a long term partner with Piedmont since 1990 and the service agreement has been self-funding since year one. The journey began with a service contract on the HVAC equipment.\n\nIn 1996 the pneumatic control system was replaced with a Novar Logic One full building control system. In 2010, the HVAC equipment serving the building was 23 years old and still running well. Piedmont performed an energy survey of the building to identify potential energy improvements. Faced with the opportunity to reduce their energy bills by 20%, Eagle Transport decided to replace the aging rooftop units with newer, high efficiency, environmentally friendly units. A lighting study was also performed to measure the lighting levels and density. Based on the results, Piedmont’s solution was to do a complete lighting retrofit and adjust the layout to better meet the current lighting requirements. As a result of these changes and improvements over the years, Eagle Transport scored an 87 on Energy Star.\n\nBuildings Across The State Of NC:100+\n\nService To Insure Uptime:24/7\n\nPlanned Energy Reduction:30%\n\nPNC Financial Services, headquartered in Pittsburgh, PA, is a diversified international financial services company. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. serves corporations, government and not-for-profit entities, middle-market companies, and institutional and retail clients through its branch network, call centers, and online banking channels. When PNC was looking for someone who could provide a comfortable and efficient environment for their customers and employees in the North Carolina area, they turned to Piedmont Service Group to maintain over 100 branches across the state.\n\nSignature Forbes 5 Star Hotel:5 Star\n\nLuxury Rooms:150\n\n5 Diamond Award:AAA\n\nGreen Plus Certification Since 2010:Green+\n\nThe Umstead Hotel and Spa is a AAA Five Diamond rated luxury located in the heart of the triangle. They offer unparalleled luxury in an environment that expresses an appreciation for the arts and embraces the wonders of nature. The six-story hotel, nestled against a 3-acre lake, resides on 12 acres and is surrounded by plush gardens. It was only natural that when The Umstead was looking for a company to maintain all of their HVAC, Chilled Water, and Building Automation Systems, that they would look to Piedmont Service Group.\n\nIndustrial & Office Space:101k sq. feet\n\nForward & Backward Compatibility :TREND Controls\n\nLiberty Property Trust was struggling with a failing controller on their existing automation system. PSG developed a solution involving TREND Controls, which provided the customer the ability to access their BAS from any computer with an internet connection. It also eliminated their dependency on Trane products as the Trend solution is an open protocol system. This solution will also help LPT reduce their future capital outlay for the facility because the Trend Controls are forward & backward compatible which won't require replacement due to obsolescence or software compatibility\n\nLiberty Property Trust (NYSE: LPT) is a $8.8 billion real estate investment trust which owns 101 million square feet of industrial and office space throughout the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nBuilt In:1978\n\nSq.Ft.:38,000+\n\nHenrico Medical Office Building, located in Richmond Virginia, was experiencing diculties with their aging HVAC equipment. After 30 years, parts were beginning to fail. Unable to shut down their building for extensive repairs Henrico MOB needed a company who could complete the renovations and replacements with little or no downtime. Piedmont Service Group was up to the challenge and completed the project to the highest standards.\n\nHenrico Medical Offce Building is part of Henrico Doctor’s Hospital which is a 340-bed community hospital with the latest in advanced technology, a combination that enables us to deliver exceptional results.\n\nOver 1M Sq. Ft.:5 campuses\n\nMaintained By Piedmont:JCI BAS system\n\nProviding 24/7 Services:FT staff\n\nWake Tech serves more than 66,000 students annually with five campuses, two training centers, community sites, and online learning. It is the North Carolina's second-largest community college, offering 180 associate degrees, diplomas, and certificates to prepare students for employment or university transfer. Wake Tech also offers non-credit workforce training and business support, basic skills (including high school equivalency preparation), and more. In order to maintain an indoor environment conducive to learning, Wake Tech hired Piedmont Service Group to provide them with their facilities services needs. Piedmont has full time employees onsite providing ongoing maintenance and repair services for the campus HVAC systems, electrical equipment, plumbing , building automation systems, and kitchen hoods.\n\nEnergy Reduction:51%\n\n3 LEED Gold Campus Buildings:Gold\n\nLEED Silver St.Francis School:Silver\n\nThe Catholic Community of St. Francis of Assisi has occupied the Raleigh site since 1983. The campus sits on 30 acres and includes educational as well as religious facilities. The parish consists of 5,000 families and employs 140 people. School enrollment includes 680 students from kindergarten through eighth grade and another 200 preschoolers. During the construction project, more than 20% of all materials used in the buildings came from sources within 500 miles of the campus. A key element in the buildings achieving LEED Gold certification is their superior performance in the area of energy efficiency. Each of the new buildings is designed to use at least 51% less energy than a comparable building. The new buildings’ HVAC system, which was installed and maintained by Piedmont Service Group makes use of outside air recirculation, humidity control and zoning that can be controlled centrally from a laptop computer."
