The company’s name was derived from the initials of these three entrepreneurs. Lucas, who was Jenkins’ father-in-law, was president after his retirement. Fassbind was the chief executive officer and technologist, while Jenkins took on the role of lead business developer.\n\nAlerton entered the building automation systems market by incorporating direct digital controls into its products. Major players in the market only widely recognized this technology during the early 1980s. The company developed its control protocol called Ibex and later transitioned to using the license-free BACnet protocol in 1995. Alerton was the first in the controls industry to implement this protocol across its entire product line.\n\nIn 2003, the UK building supplies company Novar acquired Alerton. As a result of the acquisition, “Alerton Technologies” became a wholly owned subsidiary of Novar Controls and part of Novar’s Intelligent Building Systems division. The acquisition was seen as a growth opportunity for both companies, with Novar recognizing Alerton as a pioneer in developing the BACnet protocol.\n\nIn 2005, Honeywell acquired Novar, making Alerton a part of Honeywell. Within Honeywell, Alerton is now part of the Automation and Controls group.\n\nOverview:\n\nAlerton Controls is a leading provider of Building Automation Control Systems, specializing in HVAC controls and energy management solutions.
