        "text": "Cleveland Honeywell announced Tuesday a new rental program through its Novar division called FlexStart to help commercial national account customers benefit from smart-grid ready building controls and energy management systems technology.\n\nWith FlexStart, multi-site businesses rent -- rather than purchase -- Novarâs Opus family of smart-grid ready building controls and energy management systems (EMS) technology to gain immediate savings without having to make an upfront capital investment.\n\nâWith Novarâs FlexStart rental program, multi-site businesses can become cash-flow positive in month one,â said Dean Lindstrom, president, Novar. âWe developed the FlexStart rental program to help customers improve operations and reduce their energy spend while enjoying flexible payment terms with no up-front capital investment.â\n\nThe FlexStart program is available for new installations and upgrades of existing building controls and energy management systems, which include HVAC, lighting and refrigeration systems."
