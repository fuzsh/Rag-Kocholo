        "text": "Liberty Supply accepts returns up to 90 days after the date of invoice for domestic transactions. All returns must be issued an RMA number. RMA requests can be made by emailing support@libertysupply.com. International transactions are non-returnable and non-refundable.\n\nNo restocking fee will be imposed on items authorized for return within 30 days if they are in the original, unopened packaging and not subject to a manufacturer-imposed restocking fee. Certain products are subject to a restocking fee. This fee is determined by the specific rules set by the product's manufacturer.\n\nItems opened and returned prior to 90 days after the date of invoice are subject to an additional 20% re-stock fee as long as they are in unaltered, saleable condition. Previously used/installed items cannot be returned unless covered by warranty.\n\nReturns for special order items or items that have been modified (such as an impeller trim) are assessed on a case-by-case basis. If a return is allowed, special order items will incur a variable re-stock fee of up to 50%.\n\nCustomers have the option to ship authorized return items back to Liberty Supply or have Liberty Supply arrange for a pick-up. Return shipment costs paid by Liberty Supply will be subtracted from the credited amount if we are not at fault.\n\nAll product warranties implied are the manufacturer's liability. If an item is returned under the manufacturer's warranty, Liberty Supply will forward the returned goods to the manufacturer for inspection and determination, which may take up to five (5) weeks. The final decision for warranty is solely at the manufacturer's discretion."
