It is something altogether different to draw up a scheme for a battle on the actual field, to put it into effect and to improve and amend it when all the passions are racing.” Tempelhoff 1783\n\nwww.warlordgames.com\n\nIntroduction\n\nW\n\nelcome to The Last Argument of Kings, a supplement for Warlord Games’ Black Powder rules that covers the period of warfare from around 1700 to the end of the Seven Years’ War, an era when all of Europe seemed to be at war at one time or another. For the wargamer, few other periods provide such a wide variety of troops (from Highlanders to pandours, sepoys to Native Americans, Prussian grenadiers to Turkish janissaries), fighting in such a wide variety of locations (from the snows of Sweden to the Caribbean, from Russia to the Americas, from Flanders to Constantinople). This supplement provides a potted history of each of the main conflicts along with an overview of the armies that each of the main protagonists fielded, and suggests how to replicate these forces on the battlefield using the Black Powder rules. Within these pages, you will find army lists designed to capture the flavour of this period’s armies and to reflect how they fought historically, as well as special rules that represent the unique nature of eighteenth century warfare. This book also includes a variety of scenarios that allow you to recreate the most famous or dramatic conflicts of this era. Each presents players with a different challenge, and they have been selected to best represent the strengths and weaknesses of the armies involved. Even if you do not intend to set your games during, for example, the Great Northern War or the Austro-Turkish Wars, these scenarios can all be adapted to suit any war fought during this period and will provide interesting and challenging games.\n\n2\n\n1688: The War of the League of Augsburg, or the Nine Years’ War, begins in Europe\n\nContents Warfare in the Age of Reason\n\n4\n\nDressed to

Glorious Revolution in England as William of Orange lands and King James flees\n\n3\n\nWarfare in the Age of Reason The beginning of the eighteenth century saw a huge change in how wars were fought. The first and most dramatic development was the universal use of the musket by professional European armies. This change in weaponry demanded a complete rethink of the tactics employed on the battlefield by all three arms of infantry, cavalry and artillery. This was an age of experimentation, when new ideas could lead to sweeping victory or crushing defeat. By the time of the Seven Years’ War, in the middle of the century, the practice of linear tactics had reached their zenith, with practically all European armies organising and training along similar lines to an agreed set of principles. This chapter provides a general introduction to early eighteenth century armies, how they fought and how they were led. It is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather to be a gentle introduction and also to rationalise some of the special rules you will see later in this book that will give this period its unique flavour. As you will see, this is an age of poor command, ponderous manoeuvre, pistol-firing cavalry and ineffective artillery. Anyone approaching these battles as ‘Napoleonics with tricornes’ will quickly come a cropper.\n\nGenerals and Command In these days of professional army officers and generals it seems strange to us that in the eighteenth century the lives of thousands of men could be placed in the hands of a complete buffoon. Such was often the case, however. High rank in all European armies owed more to birth and social standing than to competence or ability. The British army retained its tradition of selling commissions until the end of the century, whilst in the French army certain youths of noble birth were given rank automatically because of who they were. Duffy notes that “the young men from powerful court families could reasonably expect to become subalterns at around fifteen, captains at eighteen and colonels at twenty-three.” Marshal Saxe had to put up with many such generals: “Because of their high birth, the princes of the blood automatically claimed the high rank of lieutenant general…the incapacity of four of them was general knowledge.” The Comte de Clermont was so incompetent that Louis XV forbade him from giving any orders to the troops of his brigade, while the Comte d’Eu was not allowed to interfere with the deployment of the artillery\n\nthat he commanded! Other armies were not well served either. The Dutch general, Schlippenbach, says of his colleagues that “Of the four major generals commanding the Dutch cavalry, one was so old he could hardly sit a horse, a second was of such unwieldy proportions that he gave his orders from the window of a berlin, another was such a hypochondriac that at times he was out of his mind, while the fourth was an invalid.” Prussia was the first army to promote on ability, but even here Frederick liked all his officers to be from noble families. That said, this was the best army to get promoted within if your ability was greater than your lineage. However, this age also produced some of the greatest generals ever to command an army. Chief amongst them must be John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, who surely has a claim to being Britain’s best ever general. The age also produced Frederick of Prussia, Prince Eugene of Savoy, Marshal Maurice de Saxe… The list could go on and on. The point is this: armies in the early eighteenth century were still semi-feudal, and command lay with those who were born to it or could afford to buy into it. Some of these commanders were exceptional and were capable of great things. Most did their best. Some were buffoons. Do not expect all of your miniature brigade commanders to perform well or do as they are told. You have been warned.\n\nRaising & Training Your Regiment So if you imagine you are a member of a noble house who has the funds and the necessary permission from the king to go about the raising of a regiment, how would you go about it? It is widely held that all the soldiers in the armies of the eighteenth century were the dregs of society, the “scum of the earth” as Wellington rather famously described them. It is often said that men were forced into service by the press-gangs or that the prisons were swept of undesirables who were put into uniform. Nothing could be further from the truth. In most armies, the troops were volunteers to a man. It is true that some volunteered due to hunger or unemployment – a life in the army offered them the only real alternative to death in poverty. However, for the average eighteenth century youth, the army offered three square meals a day, clothes on your back and a roof over your head, all of which, in those hard times, were far from certain in civilian life.\n\n“The brutal Comte de Lugeac drew up the Grenadiers a Cheval, of whom he was in command, and addressed them, ‘Gentlemen. I am aware that a number of you have conceived some grievances against me. If anyone has a genuine cause for complaint, let him step forward and I will be ready to hear him.’ At that the company moved forward almost as one man. Lugeac cried halt and hastened to begin the drill.” Story related in Duffy, Military Experience in the Age of Reason\n\n4\n\n1690: Battle of the Boyne between William of Orange and King James II of England\n\nThe army also offered, to those of a more adventurous nature, the opportunity for travel, to see the world and not toil all your life and die in the same village in which you were born. Those who stepped up to take the king’s shilling included tradesmen, such as blacksmiths, cobblers or tailors, who could continue to practice their skills for their comrades or their regiment to supplement their meagre wage. Of course, there were pressed men and conscripts in European armies, especially in the Prussian army as it struggled to replace its casualties as the Seven Years’ War dragged on. However, these men were not always welcome, as they were the first to desert and were not brave under fire. They were often the first to be discharged when peace returned. The age of the men in the ranks varied wildly. Drummer Christopher Kearney was just eleven as he marched into battle in 1745 with Lally’s Irish Regiment, whilst Private John Tovey of Monro’s 37th Foot was fifty-nine when he had his jaw shot away at Culloden in 1746. For many, the army became their life, and they could imagine no life outside it. Indeed, in the Russian army, enlistment was for life! There was no workable pension scheme to look forward to in any of the European armies at the time. Although some enlightened establishments existed (Les Invalides and the hospital at Chelsea) it was for the lucky few, with most injured or old soldiers reduced to a beggar’s life when they left the army. Some armies did try to look after their own, and invalid battalions existed that were used for garrison duty or overseas. Pay was poor, especially after stoppages were removed for clothing and equipment. The French army allowed its soldiers to hold another job during times when it was billeted, as long as they were back in camp by nightfall. Others were less fortunate, especially if posted overseas, but soldiers in every army always found a shilling or two to get drunk when the opportunity presented itself. Some things, as they say, will never change. Having found your 500 or so likely lads, clothed them in bright\n\nuniforms at your own expense and issued them musket and ball, what next? Training was not standard in any of the European armies until at least the middle of the century. How each battalion manoeuvred, marched and prepared for battle lay entirely at the discretion of its colonel. Words of command were often different, whilst in some armies, such as the Austrian, they were not even in the same language! It is interesting to note that the British order, “Make ready! Present! Fire!” did not include the word “Aim!” as this was not considered necessary or desirable – volume of shot was more important than accuracy. Usually, a few NCOs with some experience were recruited to drill the men into shape. These were often veterans of other regiments, brought in to stiffen the ranks. It would be wrong to assume that just because a regiment carried the title ‘Guards’ or ‘Grenadiers’ that it was automatically better than its line equivalent. Units such as the Gardes Francais, for example, were recruited from the districts of Paris and had no special training. Only their expensive uniforms told them apart from the normal fusiliers, and their performance was sometimes dubious at best. Grenadier companies within battalions were made up from the bravest, most experienced or steadiest men, and, as a result, composite grenadier battalions (the grenadier companies of a number of different battalions brought together in a single battalion) were better than their line equivalent and were often given the toughest jobs to perform. So having drilled your men, identified your NCOs, and selected the most reliable men to be in your grenadier company, it is off to war you go!\n\nGoing to War Warfare in Europe during the eighteenth century consisted more of complex marching and counter-marching than it did actual fighting. The various kingdoms and states had too much invested in their armies to risk losing them on the battlefield.\n\nWho’s afraid of General Wolfe? “The Major and I…were employed in begging and ordering the men not to fire at too great a distance, but to keep it until the enemy should come near us: but to little purpose. The whole fired when they thought they could reach them, which had liked to have ruined us. We did very little execution with it. As soon as the French saw we presented, they fell down, and when we fired they got up and marched close to us in tolerable good order, and gave us a brisk fire, which put us into some disorder and made us give way a little. However, we soon rallied again, and attacked them with great fury which gained us a complete victory and forced the enemy to retire in great haste.” James Wolfe, Dettingen, 1743\n\nThe smoothbore musket was the standard arm of every eighteenth century army (English musket from the collection of James Gunn)\n\nThe LasT aRGumenT of KinGs Rather, the generals marched their armies around in a constant battle of wits and manoeuvre, taking towns and fortresses and cutting supply lines until one or the other army was forced to retreat. Generals such as Frederick, Marlborough or Eugene were unusual in their desire for battle to quickly end a campaign. Some generals could have very successful careers without ever once taking the field of battle. And what a lot of troops they had to march around! It was calculated that during the Seven Years’ War, each battalion in Prince Ferdinand’s army in Germany had six military wagons to carry food, spare arms and equipment, and was allowed to press a further four from the countryside should it need to carry extra blankets or equipment. The four-horse army wagons combined with the officers’ chargers and battalion horses meant that 113 horses accompanied every battalion. Behind the battalions came the field hospitals, the field bakeries with their mobile ovens, as well as the provision train of 900 six-horse wagons and all the camp followers and traders who brought their own wagons and horses. Combined with the cavalry, it was estimated that Ferdinand had with him 56,000 horses to move and supply his army, and his was the smallest force taking part in the campaign that year! Things were not helped by the generals, lords and royalty commanding the armies, who inevitably brought with them all the baggage and attendants they felt they needed to live the life to which they were accustomed. When Louis XV entered the field at Fontenoy in 1745, it was with “chamberlains, gentlemen in waiting, Swiss Guards, almoners, provosts, masters of ceremony, valets de chambre, barbers, tailors, cooks, chaplains, physicians, surgeons, apothecaries and even the Royal Clockwinders” – all of whom would need food and tents. As the army approached the field of battle, it generally moved with great slowness, as the battalions and brigades jostled into position and deployed from columns into lines. Kit and\n\n6\n\nequipment was left with the wagons, wives and girlfriends were kissed goodbye as they retreated to the rear, and the NCOs bullied and bawled at the men to get them into position.\n\nThe infantry Battle In the seventeenth century, infantry of all nationalities had carried the pike as its primary weapon, supported by increasing numbers of firearms. As the enemy approached, firearms were discharged before the musket men retired, leaving the mêlée to be decided at ‘push of pike’. The increased effectiveness, both in the accuracy and rate of fire, of the flintlock musket led to most armies doing away with the pike altogether (with some notable exceptions, such as the Swedes). Instead, firepower was now to be the order of the day. It was the army that could bring the most muskets to bear firing accurately and rapidly that would win the day. This is the ideological point were our period begins, when black powder began not only to dominate the battlefield physically, but also military thought. There were those who still advocated the use of the bayonet, such as Marshal de Saxe, but these became the voices in the wilderness, with most other military doctrine emphasising firepower as being the battlefield winner. Broadly, the doctrine was as follows: 1. form your troops into a line facing the enemy Forming from a column of march into an organised line was the most difficult of early eighteenth century manoeuvres. By the start of the Seven Years’ War, the Prussian army had perfected the technique and could form lines for battle on the head of their columns almost without missing a step, whilst their enemies would still be milling around in disorder. At Fontenoy in 1745, it took the British army three hours to form from column to line in order to attack the French positions, all the while under artillery fire!\n\n1691 Battle of Aughrim effectively ends the war for the British Crown in Ireland\n\nWaRfaRe in The aGe of Reason\n\nEARLY ALLIED FIRING LINE (SCOTS AND DUTCH TROOPS)\n\nWhilst it was recognised that placing your troops in a line was the best way to bring as many muskets to bear as possible, how many ranks of soldiers should make up this line was the subject of heated debate throughout the century. Some nations, such as the British, practised a two or three rank system, with the front rank kneeling and reserving its fire, whilst the other ranks took it in turns to fire and reload. The French, certainly in the early part of the century, had as many as four ranks. In this case, the front rank would kneel (and subsequently lie down to reload), the next rank stoop, the next stand, and those behind would fire through the gaps between their comrades in front. This inevitably led to friendly fire incidents. An Austrian officer noted, “Our troops kept up an orderly and aimed fire. Yet many a brave lad fell dead of wounds inflicted from the back, without ever having turned tail to the enemy…it transpired that these mortal wounds had been delivered by men of the rearward ranks who carelessly mishandled their muskets in the heat of the fire.” It was for this reason that the kneeling rank generally reserved its fire until absolutely necessary. Having fired, these men were in no hurry to stand up to reload! 2. march your line up to the enemy line This was done by ‘advancing the colours’. The colour party, bearing the regimental or company flags, would march several paces out in front of the line. All those on the left of the colours would look slightly to their right, so they could see the colour party, whilst those on the right would look left. Using the colour party as a guide, the line would advance, keeping pace and distance with the colours. Of course, it was not as easy as this. There was clearly a lot of pushing, with both sides of the line tending to drift towards the colours, inevitably leading to ‘bunching’ in the centre. This was made worse when under fire, as gaps in the line were to be filled (in theory) by the ranks behind. In less well-disciplined armies, men were understandably loath to fill a gap just created by a friend who has just had his head carried away by round shot. The response to the NCOs’ cries to “Close up!” was to do just that, with the files moving together, again causing men to ‘bunch’ around the colours. This meant that invariably, the advancing line had to be regularly stopped to reform. Well-\n\ndisciplined armies, such as the Prussians, could maintain their ranks and files whilst advancing under fire to the point where they would stop and give effective return fire. Less well-trained armies would more easily become disordered under fire, often having to stop to reorder their ranks. This delay prolonged the time the troops spent under fire and so further disrupted their lines and eroded morale, eventually forcing them to retire or break in flight. One general wrote, “Is it credible that, having sustained several volleys from the enemy, a battalion will be in any condition to open fire when it finally desires to do so? Will it be in any state to withstand a charge, or launch a charge of its own against a fresh and intact enemy?” 3. firing at the enemy Having marched your brave chaps across the open ground under constant artillery fire, your line would eventually arrive within a few hundred paces of the enemy line. The men would then raise up one arm, bent at the elbow to create the necessary room to fire. They would then wait for the order. The flintlock musket had an effective range of 450 paces or 300 yards, but would be unlikely to hit the proverbial barn door at this range. The best results could be obtained at distances of 100 yards or less, with real execution being done at 75 paces or 50 yards. At the command “Load”, the private brought his weapon down from his shoulder and held it suspended across his chest with his left hand while he pulled the lock back to the half-cock position with his right. Reaching into his cartridge box, he would pull out a cartridge, a twist of stiff paper containing a lead ball weighing just over an ounce, and seven drams of black powder. Biting off the end furthest from the ball, and tasting the bitter charcoal, he would shake a little of the powder into the pan of his musket, close the pan and drop the butt of the musket to the ground. He then poured the remainder of the powder down the barrel, followed by the ball and finally the paper (which prevented the ball rolling out of the barrel again). Taking his wooden (or, as the century progressed, iron) ramrod from its position below the barrel, he would ram home the ball and wad to seat it securely. Looking along the line he may very well see old veterans knocking the butt of their musket firmly on the ground, rather than draw the ramrod, to save time. He would then replace his ramrod and return his musket to his shoulder.\n\n1692: French defeat the Allies at the Battle of Steenkerque\n\n7\n\nThe LasT aRGumenT of KinGs\n\nBeginner’s Luck\n\nFrederick the Great was once dissatisfied with the performance of his artillery. He dismounted, adjusted the aim of a cannon and hit the target with the first round. “There you are,” said the king, ”you don’t bother to aim properly.” When a veteran gunner asked if the king could show them again, the king lined up the cannon again, but this time the ball followed a completely different path!\n\nAt the command “Present”, the soldier would point his musket at the enemy. NCOs would shout at the men to aim low, usually around the knees, as the kick of the musket would cause the barrel to rise dramatically and inexperienced units often fired their shots well over the heads of the enemy. The final command would be “Fire”, or in the early days “Give Fire”, after which, in the blinding white smoke and noise of the other ranks or platoons firing in order, the private would go through the loading process again. Well-trained units could expect to fire two or three rounds a minute. The first shot given by the line was widely considered to be its best. This was the shot loaded carefully whilst in camp and fired with new flints. Prolonged firefights led to a breakdown in fire discipline, blunted flints, and badly loaded weapons being fired through a pall of gun smoke. For this reason, the ‘first fire’ was husbanded by colonels, with some even believing that the army which fired first would lose the fight, as it would allow the enemy to advance closer to give their first fire. The distance you chose to give fire at was not always your choice, however. Panic would often take hold in even the most disciplined of armies, with the soldiers giving fire at long range or even before the enemy appeared. A French observer with the Prussian army noted how “at Hohenfriedberg, part of the left wing opened fire without seeing anything of the enemy – the spring was wound up and platoons on the right and centre loosed off, and the others followed in a mechanical way.” This was the reason why soldiers advanced with their musket upright against their shoulder. Those who advanced with their musket levelled facing the enemy were prone to fire too soon (and often accidentally shot or stabbed the man in front into the bargain).\n\ndivided into platoons that fired out of sequence, but you get the general idea). This had more of a shotgun effect on the enemy line as each section fired in turn. The effect on the enemies’ morale was greater, as more hits were scored in a localised area of their line, making their opponents’ fire appear more effective than it probably was. Whatever the firing system chosen, it all appears to have broken down once in contact with the enemy. Colonel Russell of Duroure’s Regiment wrote that his regiment at Dettingen “were under no command by way of Hyde Park firing, but the whole three ranks made a running fire of their own accord. The French fired in the same manner, without waiting for words of command, and Lord Stair did often say he had seen many a battle and never saw the infantry engage in any other manner.” 4. Winning and Losing Winning the firefight very often came down to which side could maintain their fire whilst ignoring their own casualties for the longest time. Soon after firing commenced, the soldiers would be surrounded in a pall of smoke. Around them would be their wounded and dead comrades, whilst from the front would come a hail of lead from the enemies’ firing accompanied by roundshot or canister from their artillery. All of the soldiers’ senses would be overwhelmed. The noise of firing, screams and shouts would be tremendous, the stench of casualties and powder would be overpowering, whilst little could be seen through the smoke. Confusion would reign, and only the veteran or most disciplined troops could stand it for long. Often, one side would give way and start to fall back or reach a tipping point when they would simply break and run. This could well be achieved by firing alone, such as at Quebec, but often when one side saw the other begin to waver, the order would be given to charge. A line of screaming men coming forward with bayonets fixed was usually enough to convince a wavering enemy to leave. Although mêlées did occur, they were usually short-lived affairs as most men dreaded being stabbed by a bayonet. This was not the attitude of all armies during this period, however. The Swedes believed in one volley followed by a determined charge to see off the enemy, which usually worked. The Highland Scots employed a similar tactic – their pursuit of the defeated Government forces after Prestonpans was considered barbaric. The armies of the Turks lacked the training, discipline and quite often the firearms to win a firefight, and relied entirely on a wild charge to carry the day.\n\nThere was further debate about which was the best firing system. Some armies fired by ranks. Quite simply, this consisted of all of the back rank firing all along the battalion, then the middle rank and then, if appropriate, the front, by which time the back rank would have reloaded and be ready to fire again. This caused a thin smattering of bullets to strike the enemy along the full length of their line.\n\nIt was recognised that hand-to-hand combat was still necessary to defeat an enemy ensconced behind earthworks or in prepared defences. Grenadier companies were issued with grenades to assist with this task, and were often grouped together in ad hoc grenadier battalions to assault such positions. There was a place for carrying the enemy at the point of a bayonet, but it was not a widely held doctrine. The winning side would then advance and occupy the ground just vacated by the enemy, order their ranks and treat the wounded. This was, after all, the beginning of the Age of Reason, and there was no need for undue cruelty towards a defeated foe.\n\nPlatoon firing was first developed by the Prussian and Dutch armies, but was developed into an art form by the British. This involved dividing the line into a number of ‘firings’, where the whole platoon would fire in sections along the line. For example, in a British regiment of ten companies, all three ranks of the first company would fire, then all three ranks of the next and so on, creating a rolling fire along the line. By the time the last company had fired the first would be ready to fire again. (It was actually not as simple as this, as each company would be\n\nThe wounded men of both sides had little hope of full recovery. Most doctors and surgeons who followed the army were unskilled in their work and badly educated in the ways of medicine. Some did not think it necessary to clean a wound or remove all foreign matter before stitching a wound closed. Although the antiseptic qualities of vinegar were recognised, they were not understood, and even minor wounds could lead to a patient’s death through infection. The musket ball often caused compound fractures in bones that could not be repaired\n\n8\n\n1693: French defeat the Allies at the Battle of Landen (or Neerwinden)\n\nWaRfaRe in The aGe of Reason by eighteenth century medicine, and amputation was the only option. A surgeon would cut around the limb to be removed with a sharp knife, peel back the flesh and then cut through the bone with a saw designed for the purpose. This procedure was usually undertaken without anaesthetic. Prior to battle, soldiers were often badly fed and had marched for miles. They would then have to fight through the physically and mentally exhausting experience of battle and, if injured, may have had to lie on the field awaiting assistance for hours. To then undergo surgery when the body was already weak makes it a wonder that any survived at all! Adequate aftercare was practically non-existent, and sometimes victorious armies\n\nhad to leave their wounded on the battlefield to be cared for by their enemy as their own resources were wanting, such as happened to the British wounded after Dettingen. The Prussian medical services were often the death of many of their own soldiers. After the Battle of Torgau, one Prussian soldier wrote: “The cold killed off most of the wounded, as usually happens in the Prussian service, where the hospitals are so badly served and so malodorous that the soldier considers himself dead once he enters the portals. I have it on good authority that the hospital directors and surgeons were under orders to let men die if they were wounded in such a way that they would be incapable of serving after they were healed.”\n\nFRENCH TROOPS EXCHANGE FIRE WITH THE DANES\n\nSPANISH AND FRENCH TROOPS ADVANCE\n\n1694: French General Vauban defeats an Allied amphibious landing at the Battle of Camaret\n\n9\n\nThe LasT aRGumenT of KinGs\n\nPRUSSIAN DRAGOONS AT THE CHARGE\n\nCavalry versus infantry In the centuries immediately preceding our period, the widespread effective use of the pike by infantry cancelled out the dominance of the armoured heavy cavalry of the past. No longer could infantry be ridden down by armoured knights, and the reputation of cavalry as the battle-winning arm was on the wane. The pike forced cavalry to rethink how best to tackle infantry, as the head on charge was no longer an option. Instead, cavalry learned to approach at the trot and fire pistols or carbines at the infantry. If the infantry were not disordered or forced back by the fire, the cavalry would retire, reload and come on again. Successive waves of cavalry performing this action became known as ‘caracoling’. By the beginning of the eighteenth century, the pike had almost disappeared. In its place, infantry carried the newly invented bayonet. At first this was a blade on a piece of cork that was pushed into the barrel of the musket to make an improvised pike. The problem with the ‘plug’ bayonet was that, once fitted, you could no longer fire your musket. Very often, the infantry could not get the bayonets back out again, making the musket useless for the rest of the battle. The socket bayonet came into widespread use in the early 1700s and immediately made infantry more effective. Now they could fix their bayonets and present a wall of spikes against advancing cavalry whilst still allowing ranks to fire and reload. During the early eighteenth century, infantry generally faced cavalry in line. However, by the time of Napoleon, infantry would not dare face cavalry in any formation other than square, for fear of being ridden down. What was the reason behind this change in tactics? Cavalry had, for many years, trained to face pikes and, as such, had moved away from headlong charges into infantry. The cavalrymen no longer trained to do it and, more importantly, the horses were not trained to do so. At Blenheim, for example, French cavalry were still approaching at the trot firing pistols, hoping to disrupt the enemy before then closing in. Even the word ‘charging’ was often a misnomer, as cavalry could manage little more than a fast trot whilst maintaining their ranks and files, even when closing with other cavalry. Well-trained infantry 10\n\ncould lay down enough fire to stop all but the most determined cavalry unit attempting to close with them. One British general wrote: “If a body of foot have but resolution to keep their order, there is no body of horse dare venture within their fire.” The most famous example of this happening occurred at Minden in 1759, when six battalions of British infantry and three of Hanoverian Guards advanced against and shattered three lines of French cavalry, but examples exist in most other battles of the period. Even if the cavalry did force their way through the barrage of fire and manage to get amongst the infantry, the resulting mêlée did not always go their way. At the battle of Dettingen in 1743, the French Gendarmes and Chevaux-Legers came on at a full trot towards the allied left flank, where Campbell’s Royal Scots Fusiliers were stationed. The French cavalry fired their pistols with their swords hanging from their wrists by the sword knots. Despite the heavy fire, the cavalry came on and broke through the line. The fusiliers lay down and let the cavalry pass over them. One officer attempted to stand up, but a veteran NCO told him to keep his head down, as the French sabres could not reach men on the ground. When the French had passed, the regiment stood up again, turned about and fired a volley into the French rear, just about destroying them. Later, King George II (God bless him) shouted at Sir Andrew Agnew, who commanded Campbell’s: “I saw the cuirassiers get in among your men this morning, colonel.” “Oh aye, your Majesty,” replied Sir Andrew, “but they dinna get oot again.” This was not to say that squares were never formed. Far from it. The end of a line was very vulnerable, and if one’s own cavalry had been chased off, then nothing remained but to form a square or be outflanked. At Fleurus in 1690, for example, the Dutch foot formed a vast square of sixteen battalions after the flight of their cavalry, and successfully withdrew to Charleroi. Equally, at Elixheim in 1705, during the Passage of the Lines of Brabant, ten battalions under the command of the Comte de Caraman formed a square and successfully fought off the attacks of Marlborough’s cavalry whilst retreating to the safety\n\n1700: The Great Northern War begins. Sweden wins the Battle of Narva\n\nWaRfaRe in The aGe of Reason of Louvain. Cavalry was at its most effective when charging infantry in the flank or rear. A line attacked in the flank was lost, as it could not fire or face the enemy, and could quickly be rolled up. This was the abiding fear of all generals in this period, and turning an opponent’s flank was every general’s aim. The Duke of Marlborough was one of the first generals to insist that cavalry should go back to its role of charging headlong with the sabre. On campaign, he only issued three bullets to each cavalryman with strict instructions that they should only be used whilst on piquet duty. As the years progressed, cavalry eventually divided into two arms. Dragoons (who were mounted infantry, trained to fight with the musket, hold ground and perform a light cavalry role) and the ‘horse’ or heavy cavalry, whose job it was to defeat the enemy cavalry and ride down the infantry. By the middle or late part of the century, cavalry was once again being trained to charge home on infantry. Heavy cavalry was deployed in depth to help punch through lines, and citizen armies, such as the Revolutionary French or Prussian Landwehr, could not be relied upon to stand against it. Forming a square became the only option.\n\nThe Cavalry Battle The job of light cavalry and dragoons was to forage, scout and perform piquet duty for the army. In the case of dragoons, they had a battlefield role that involved them swiftly taking ground and holding it until the infantry came up. They could also dismount to hold difficult ground that would disorder formed infantry, or to defend earthworks. Dragoons and light cavalry were generally mounted on smaller horses than the heavier cavalry units, and many of these were not trained to charge into infantry or other cavalry. This put them at a huge disadvantage in a cavalry mêlée. As the century went on, the dragoons lost their mounted infantry role and increasingly became heavy horse, so that by the end of the century there was no difference between ‘dragoons’ and the front-line heavy cavalry. As wargamers, we should remember which era our game is set in, and deploy our dragoons appropriately. How you use your dragoons in 1701 will not be how you use them in 1815! The ‘horse’ were heavy cavalry units. Some retained the cuirass, worn under their coat, whilst some wore steel caps to protect their heads under their tricorne hats. At the beginning of the century it was possible to see some heavy horse units still wearing full-face lobster pot helmets and armour, although they became increasingly rare as the years went by. Usually deployed on the flanks, the role of the horse was first and foremost to beat the enemy horse. Having done so, it was then to assist in the destruction and pursuit of the enemy infantry. Simple really. The tallest men were recruited for the ‘horse’, and were mounted on larger horses than the light cavalry and dragoons. They generally carried a straight sabre and most continued to carry pistols, although the use of these firearms by cavalry diminished as the century progressed.\n\nartillery Although there were master gunners in most armies since the arrival of the first artillery pieces, the art of the ‘guns’ was a mysterious one for most people during this century. To begin with, there was little coordination in the manufacture of guns, and some armies could have a bewildering variety of different guns of differing size and calibre. This caused a logistical nightmare in terms of supply, with some guns often being\n\nsupplied with the wrong-sized ball! There were few professional gunners. Most armies had an officer class who looked after the siting of the guns and the construction of defences at sieges and before battle. However, the job of transporting the guns to the battlefield was usually undertaken by hired labour or in some cases by local peasants pressed into service. Once on the battlefield, the guns were manned by soldiers from the infantry or engineers. As a result, artillery was not a hugely effective arm at the beginning of the century. It was useful for softening up opponents, especially if they were in defences, but lacked the manoeuvrability to perform a close support role. The Duke of Marlborough famously took great interest in the siting of his guns, and his artillery commander, Colonel Blood, was an expert in moving the guns in support of the infantry. However, this was the exception rather than the rule. At Fontenoy in 1745, the hired labour ran off as soon as the battle started and took their carts and horses with them, forcing the British to abandon the guns as they retreated at the end of the battle. Generally, the guns fell into three categories. First were the light guns, sometimes called ‘battalion guns’. These were 4-pounders at most. They were dragged along by the infantry battalions and could be used to provide close support if they could keep up. Sometimes they were hooked up to horses for quick deployment around the battlefield, such as the ‘Swedish’ 3-pounders introduced into the French army by Marshal de Saxe. However, boggy ground or woods could prevent the artillery being moved effectively, and subsequently these guns were very far removed from the horse artillery that would be available by the end of the century. Next were the 6- to 9pounder medium guns, which were deployed in batteries and were the common calibre for ‘battlefield’ guns. These were placed at the start of the battle and usually did not move again until the battle was over. The final category consisted of the heavy, or siege guns. 12-pounders at minimum, they also comprised the unfeasibly large guns deployed by the Turks. These were rarely used on the battlefield due to their slow fire rate and ponderous speed, but were required by all armies to reduce walls or defences during a siege.\n\nTough Love Cornet Wortley acted as an aide-de-camp to General Sinclair at the battle of Fontenoy in 1745, and as such was in the middle of the action all day. He wrote to his father when the battle was over to let him know he was alright: “I received a shot in my clothes and had my shoulder notch shot off (and musket) shots clattered on my furniture behind me and against my pistols before me. Some were, I suppose, partly spent. I was twice thrown from my horse by a cannon ball…when I got up I was a good deal stunned, either from my fall or the wind of the ball or both! The ball was so near to me that everybody was surprised to see me alive.” His mother was, however, unimpressed. She wrote to his father: “I am obliged to you for the account given to me of my son, but as I have too long experience of his idle vain way of talking of himself, I do not much regard what he says on any subject. I have heard the wind of a cannon ball will dismount a man and that may be his meaning, tho’ it is possible it may be entirely invented.” Eighteenth-century mothers were evidently difficult to please.\n\n1701: The War of the Spanish Succession begins\n\n11\n\nDressed to Kill The Uniforms of the Eighteenth Century It is impossible, given the space available, to describe all of the different uniforms, their colours and variety, which appeared throughout the eighteenth century. However, there is a great deal of information concerning uniforms of this period from all sorts of different publishers (see the bibliography at the end of this book). Anyone considering taking up eighteenth century wargaming will not be stuck with the endless greens and browns of the WWII gamer. Oh no! Wargaming in the Age of Reason provides a vast array of uniform potential, from eastern hussars to North American Indians, from Turks and elephants to Highland rebels, from marines and sailors to cuirassiers and household cavalry. However, some items of clothing remained fairly common in their use and appearance throughout the century, and what follows is a general guide for those new to the period who are not sure what their troops should look like on the wargames table. Most infantry soldiers of this period wore the ubiquitous tricorne hat that makes this period so instantly recognisable. It was often made from felt and was worn turned up on three sides from the beginning of the eighteenth century. However, the material was not very hard wearing, and after a downpour of rain or a few weeks’ hard wear in the field, it looked like a shabby floppy hat. During the time of Marlborough, it was common to see infantry with hats turned up on only one side, or with floppy hats more akin to the English Civil War than to the eighteenth century.\n\nthe more distinguished gentlemen. The rank and file either tied their hair back or wore it cut short. As the period progressed, the powdered wig began to become more fashionable, and was in general use by the time of the War of the Austrian Succession. The officers’ wigs were powdered white, curled at the sides and had a small ‘pony tail’ at the back, which was generally tied up with black silk. The men were required to scrape their hair back, held in place by all manner of slimy concoctions, and tie their hair in a similar manner before having it powdered white for parades. Whether soldiers bothered to powder their hair on campaign is a moot point, but it seems unlikely. However, from the wargamer’s point of view, hair can be undercoated with a dark colour before being drybrushed white, with the bow and ‘tail’ at the back painted black. This is certainly a quicker method than painting individual hair colours! Moustaches were popular in German and Austrian armies, but not beards. In the French army, only grenadiers were allowed to sport a moustache, which was the sign of their rank. Moustaches were not encouraged in the British army, although the famous prints by Morier of grenadiers from all of the British regiments, which were painted in the 1740s, show grenadiers with beards. Rules may well have been relaxed on campaign, and it is hard to imagine any British drill sergeant without a well-curled moustache.\n\nEven by the time of the American War of Independence, the British tricorne hat rarely appeared as it should. Only officers and generals would appear on the battlefield with impeccably turned out hats, often braided with gold or feathered edges. The soldier’s tricorne was edged with worsted tape that was often white in colour. However, in some armies, such as the French, the hat’s edging colour related to the colour of the buttons and braid. When buttons were brass or gold, the hat would generally be edged in yellow (or gold for officers), with white used if the buttons or braid was silver (or edged silver for officers). The cockade varied in colour, but was generally white or black. In the British Isles, black was used by the British army, but the Jacobite rebels chose to adorn their hats with white cockades, which became a symbol for Jacobites across Europe. In the French army, cockade colour could vary according to regimental preference, as it could with the Prussians. Due to the similarity in coat colour amongst many units in opposing armies, often troops resorted to putting green sprigs in their hats or some other form of identifying mark to try to ensure that they were not the victims of friendly fire.\n\nThe coat at the beginning of the century was generally a full one with large, turned back cuffs. Turning back the cuffs and, in some regiments, the hem revealed the coloured lining of the coat that helped to identify the regiments. Different nationalities adopted set colours for the uniforms of their armies – the British used red, the Prussians blue, the French white, etc. Obviously, there were variations within each country’s army, which is what makes this period so pleasing to the eye, and what holds such appeal for wargamers. At the beginning of the century, the coats were full length, coming down to cover the thighs, and were made of heavy wool material for which the troops were thankful in cold weather. Even units that usually turned the skirts of the coat back as standard, such as those in the British army after Marlborough, would drop them back down in inclement weather or on campaign. As the century wore on, it became fashionable to follow the Prussian style of outer coat. This was a much smaller coat that barely covered the torso and was cut away to reveal more of the waistcoat underneath. Whilst it does look more dashing, this style of uniform was incredibly unpopular with the troops, as it was useless in wet or cold weather and provided little comfort for the soldier on campaign.\n\nThe other form of headgear worn during this period was the mitre cap. At the beginning of the century, this was little more than a stocking cap with a stiff front piece that displayed the regimental arms. However, as the century wore on, the mitre front became larger and more decorative, with a shaped back to it. Originally issued to grenadiers, as the tricorne hat interfered with the throwing of grenades, it was also worn in a smaller version by fusiliers and by musicians in some armies.\n\nUnderneath the coat, a waistcoat was worn. Often, the waistcoat was simply the previous year’s coat with the lapels and cuffs removed and cut shorter. Troops serving overseas are sometimes depicted without their heavy woollen coats, but instead wearing ‘waistcoats’ that have sleeves. This would be the previous year’s coat ‘recycled’. In some armies, such as the Prussians, the waistcoat was of a different colour to the heavy coat and so recycling was not possible.\n\nHairstyles did not change a great deal during the century. At the turn of the century, it was fashionable for the upper classes and officers to shave their heads and wear elaborate wigs (this had as much to do with head lice and other hair related diseases as to fashion). These could be a variety of colours, even grey for\n\nSoldiers’ trousers were short in the leg, generally coming to the knee. Socks or stockings were worn to cover the lower leg. Early in the century, it became commonplace for the soldiers to be issued gaiters to cover their stockings and trousers on campaign. The gaiters were thigh length and generally white for parades\n\n12\n\n1701: Prince Eugene defeats the French at Battle of Chiari\n\nHungarian infantry in distinctive trousers\n\nPrussian infantry in their short infantry coats\n\nFrench infantry in full coats with large cuffs\n\n1702: William of Orange dies after a fall from his horse\n\n13\n\nThE LasT argUmEnT of Kings\n\nThe very stylish Musketeers Noirs\n\nand martial displays. Most armies also issued another, darker pair of gaiters for use by soldiers when they were undertaking manual labour or marching on campaign. Artillery troops were commonly issued only with black gaiters, as they could never keep white ones clean. Some Prussian and Austrian units are always depicted in black gaiters, and occasionally different colours appeared depending on what was available. In a painting of the Battle of Culloden commissioned very soon after the battle, the Inniskillings are shown wearing greencoloured gaiters – wear and tear could often make all gaiters look brown or dark grey. On campaign, especially in the American colonies, many units replaced their gaiters with Indian leggings – for example, the Highlanders wore leggings under their kilts to protect their legs from the undergrowth. Shoes were generally black with a buckle on the front for tightening and fastening. Soldiers’ shoes were never of high quality and quickly wore out on campaign, and were one of the items most often requested by army quartermasters in the field. Whilst they did come in different sizes, they did not differentiate between left and right, being a square-toed one shoe fits all. Cavalry uniforms tended to follow all of the above general rules for infantry. Cavalrymen often had the benefit of a cloak or cape for bad weather, which was rolled when not worn and stored on the saddle behind the rider. Cavalry boots were generally better made and of higher quality than infantry shoes, but were difficult and clumsy to run in or to walk any distance. For this reason, dragoons, who still fought for most of this\n\nperiod as mounted infantry, preferred to wear shoes and gaiters rather than cavalry boots. Cavalry were generally armed with a sabre, two pistols and, in some regiments, a carbine. The lance was not popular outside Eastern Europe and the Ottoman Empire. Cavalry retained their armour for the first part of the century, with some cuirassier regiments wearing their back and breastplates and ‘lobster pot’ helmets throughout the Wars of the Spanish Succession. By the middle of the century, heavy cavalry were protected by just a breastplate under their coat, with a metal skullcap often worn under the tricorne to protect them from enemy sabre cuts. Increasingly effective muskets made even the best armour obsolete, but the retention of the bow and lance by Turkish troops made the Russian and Austrian armies in the east retain their armour right up to the Napoleonic wars. It is possible to generalise about the equipment issued to most armies during this period. The widespread adoption of the flintlock musket went hand-in-hand with the adoption of cartridge boxes for pre-prepared rounds that made the act of loading and firing quicker. Gone are the ‘apostles’ style cartridge belts so common in the English Civil War and Thirty Years’ War. However, irregular troops are often portrayed with powder horns and musket balls in a bag or in their pockets, especially in conflicts in North America. The number of cartridges held in a box varied between armies and also between boxes, with some holding as few as twelve and others as many as twenty.\n\n“Gentlemen of the French Guard, fire first!” A French officer, Count d’Anterroches replied, “Gentlemen, we never fire first, fire yourselves.” Sir Charles Hay, Foot Guards, Fontenoy 1745 (according to Voltaire)\n\n14\n\n1702: English with Native American allies beat the Spanish with Native American allies at Flint River (in the present-day US state of Georgia)\n\nDrEssED To KiLL Whilst all armies issued backpacks or similar large knapsacks to the infantry for transporting essential gear, such as tents, cooking utensils, spare uniform, etc., these were rarely carried into battle. The march of armies to the battlefield and the long drawn out deployment process made surprise battles very rare. The soldiers’ gear was often stowed on the regiments’ wagons or with their wives and camp followers before the battle. The troops would march into the fight with just what they needed, with only their water bottle and a little food squirreled away in their pockets or cartridge box for emergencies. The loss of an army’s supply train in such circumstances would be devastating, as the soldiers would literally have lost everything. On campaign in India or America, the soldiers may well have carried their backpacks into battle, especially if a large supply train was not available. From the wargamer’s point of view, this makes our models less cluttered with the various straps and cross belts which a soldier with a great deal of kit is obliged to wear. Most figures will display two belts, crossing on the soldier’s chest, which will lead to a cartridge box on one hip and a water bottle or small satchel on the other. The only other item of equipment the model might carry is the hanger for the bayonet or, in some armies, a short sword issued for close combat. It is interesting to note how armies adapted whilst on campaign. The French army issued a small hatchet to all its troops for use in chopping firewood and making defences, yet during the French Indian Wars in America this hatchet was often worn tucked into the trooper’s belt whilst the short sword disappeared from use. The ideal soldier in the middle of the eighteenth century would be well turned out in a tricorne hat, pressed uniform, powdered hair and white gaiters. On campaign, he was more likely to be unshaven, with unpowdered hair, a shabby floppy hat, a coat with lapels and skirts folded down to keep out the wind and rain, and with black or dirty brown gaiters covered in mud. How you paint your army is up to you, but one thing you will not be short of is choice. Enjoy.\n\nThe Greatest British Cavalry Charge? The Duke of Cumberland once again faced Marshal de Saxe at the Battle of Laffeldt in 1747. This time the allies were defending villages that the French were forced to attack. After four hours, the Dutch troops on the allied left gave way. De Saxe moved up all of his reserve cavalry and deployed them to attack the collapsing left wing. The threat was made doubly worse, as the allies’ line of retreat would be cut if the French overran the left rear of the allied army. Acting quickly, General Sir John Ligonier gathered around him the dragoon regiments of Rich, Rothe, Cumberland, the Queen’s Dragoons, the Inniskillings and the Scots Greys, amounting to about sixty squadrons. Wheeling them into line, he personally led the charge against over 140 squadrons of the enemy, a force that included the household regiments and the gendarmes. The British cavalry crashed into the French with such force that they entirely defeated them, rolling them back and capturing five standards. The Duke of Cumberland sent a message to Ligonier requiring him to retire and save the cavalry. Ligonier wheeled the British cavalry about and reformed them, only to be ordered back to the attack again by Cumberland, as the infantry had only just begun to disengage. Ligonier once again led forward his brave but tired cavalry squadrons. This time the French cavalry were prepared for the British, who charged to their doom amongst the rallied squadrons. Ligonier was surrounded by some French carabiniers to whom he offered his purse and watch. The gallant French cavalryman declined, requiring only his sword as he led Ligonier into captivity. As Ligonier was being led away as a prisoner, an arrogant French officer stepped out of the Regiment of Navarre and said to him, “Sir, there is the finest regiment in Europe!” to which Ligonier replied, “I know, I saw them taken prisoner at Blenheim.” Horace Walpole pronounced the charge “an act of desperate gallantry,” whilst de Saxe described Ligonier as “a man who has defeated all my plans by a single glorious action.”\n\nFirst Battalion, the Royal Scots\n\n1703: A great storm hits England, lasting eight days and killing over 10,000\n\n15\n\nSpecial Rules for the Period the rules provided in the Black Powder core rulebook cope admirably with the majority of situations presented during this period. however, there are a number of issues that need to be addressed, especially with regard to armies at the beginning of the century. With nearly a hundred years of war to discuss here, it is difficult to cover everything. however, a little common sense and agreement before the game will resolve most issues. the rules amendments presented here are suggestions, and players are encouraged to experiment with them to find out what works best for them.\n\nFormations all the formations for regular troops listed on page 14 of the Black Powder rulebook are allowed during this period except the attack column. this was the era when linear tactics ruled supreme and armies did not attack in column in the way they did during the later napoleonic period. in addition, march columns may only change formation into line by turning to their left or right. in other words, turn the bases or miniatures in the column to the left or right (depending on which direction they want to form a line in), thereby forming a line. Players need to be aware that they will have to present the flank of a column to the enemy before making a right or left turn into line. for this reason, a unit should perform this manoeuvre well away from danger, because if it is charged in a flank whilst in column it will be in very deep trouble! only Prussian armies of the seven Years’ War may form lines on the leader or front base at the head of a column (see page 18 of the Black Powder rulebook). in this case, the colours at the head of the column remain in place and the other bases form a line alongside the colours. the ability to form line whilst advancing towards the enemy was a huge advantage that often caught frederick’s enemies by surprise.\n\nInterpenetration eighteenth century armies were slow to move into formation, and these formations were easily disrupted when crossing obstacles or difficult terrain. Being interpenetrated by friendly units caused disruption, especially if one side was retreating in haste, and both units would often have to pause to reform before moving on. to maintain the feel of the period, you may want to rule that a unit that interpenetrates or is interpenetrated by a friendly unit loses half its move (e.g. 6\" for infantry, 9\" for cavalry, etc.). if a unit has insufficient movement to pass through, it must stop as soon as it reaches the rear of the unit it hoped to interpenetrate, although it can try to interpenetrate again during its next turn. refer to page 33 of the Black Powder rulebook for the full rules for interpenetration\n\nMoving and Firing a feature of the Black Powder rules is that they are fast moving and tend to encourage aggressive play. if you roll well when issuing your orders, it is possible for a unit to move forward three times and then fire. during the eighteenth century, many armies attempted firing by introduction. in this system, one rank would advance and fire, and whilst it was reloading, the next rank would interpenetrate it, advance and fire. the third rank would then move through, and so on. the ranks would be constantly marching towards the enemy whilst still firing as they went. a similar system was used when retiring facing the enemy, only in reverse. there is no real problem with units in the game moving and still being allowed to fire. however, units defending a position can find themselves standing watching whilst the enemy moves three times and then still gets to fire at them before they have fired a single shot, which is arguably ‘not very eighteenth century’. if both sides agree, you may introduce a simple rule that no infantry unit that has moved more than once can fire. this encourages units to wait for support and not to outrun their artillery, which is in keeping with the feel of the period.\n\nPlatoon Firing a particular feature of the war in europe, particularly during the Wars of the spanish and austrian successions, was the developing use of platoon firing by some armies, as discussed in a previous chapter. We reflect this in Black Powder by giving those units who use platoon firing one extra dice when firing against those who do not. obviously, in battles set during the later seven Years’ War both sides may well be employing platoon firing or a version of it, in which case the effect is negated and you should revert back to the base stat line for both armies. the extra dice reflects the more effective platoon firing system, and is especially effective when combined with the first fire special rule. note that platoon firing may not be used by shaken or disordered troops.\n\nGrenades!\n\nPrussian grenadiers of the seven Years’ War\n\n16\n\nin the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, grenadiers in certain armies were issued with grenades (the clue is in the name i suppose…). during this period, a grenade took the form of the classic round ball with a fuse sticking out of the top which the grenadier lit with a slow match before hurling it at the enemy. these weapons were most often used when\n\n1703: Swedes beat the Saxons at the Battle of Pultusk\n\nstorming fortifications. for this reason, the grenadier companies were often detached from their battalions and formed into ad hoc grenadier battalions for particularly difficult tasks, such as being first into a breach or leading the attack on defences. this can be reflected in the Black Powder army lists by giving grenadier units better stamina or shooting values than normal infantry battalions. however, in battles where ad hoc grenadier battalions were formed in order to storm fortifications (such as the British grenadiers at the schellenberg, or the dutch at fontenoy), you can use the following rules: a unit attacked in hand-to-hand combat by a combined grenadier regiment or shot at by one within 6\" gains no morale dice modifier from cover and only a +1 modifier if it is occupying a building or behind fortifications (see Black Powder page 47). this simulates the close range use of grenades and the élan of the grenadiers. it also encourages players to form combined grenadier battalions to storm fortifications as their historical counterparts would have done.\n\nPikes, Butts and Bayonets at the turn of the eighteenth century some armies were still employing the pike. the swedish used it throughout the great northern War, and it was still making an appearance at the end of the century in the armies of irish rebels fighting in 1798. Plug bayonets may have been used as early as sedgemoor in 1685, but we know some armies were still issuing fire before turning their muskets upside down and using them as clubs.\n\nPlatoon Firing there is a lot of debate about whether platoon firing was more effective than the rank firing system. at the Battle of Malplaquet in 1709, a regiment of irish infantry in British service, using platoon firing, came up against an irish regiment in french service that were still using the volley fire system. Captain Parker wrote: “When we had advanced within a hundred paces of them, they gave us a fire of one of their ranks; whereupon we halted, and returned them the fire of our six platoons at once; and immediately made ready the six platoons of our second fire, and advanced upon them again. they then gave us the fire of another rank, and we returned them a second fire, which made them shrink; however, they gave us the fire of a third rank after a scattering manner and then retired into the wood in great disorder: on which we sent our third fire after them, and saw them no more… We had but four men killed and six wounded, and found nearly forty of them on the spot killed and wounded.”\n\nMusket from the collection of James Gunn\n\nrather than invent a myriad of different rules to cover all the different armies of the period, only one thing needs amending: the hand-to-hand value of the units involved. if historical precedent shows that one side’s pikes were very effective in mêlée then by all means raise their hand-to-hand value by one or two dice, whilst lowering their shooting value by one or two dice to compensate for the fact that fewer men were firing. if a unit has no bayonets then it has two less dice in mêlée than those that do. if the unit has pikes and no muskets, such as irish rebels, then you might consider representing it on the tabletop as Warband infantry (see Black Powder, page 176).\n\ntheir colours and would go to great lengths to retain them. to lose even one or two colours during a battle was considered to be a disgrace, making the 129 infantry colours and 171 cavalry standards taken by the allies at Blenheim remarkable.\n\nfor the early period, such as the nine Years’ War, realistic results are gained by not allowing cavalry to charge any steady infantry frontally who have at least 20% pike in the unit.\n\na unit which has captured a colour and which is subsequently beaten in mêlée later in the game may lose the captured standard as it is taken back by a brave soul.\n\nthe only rule that does need to be enforced concerns plug bayonets. once fitted, quite often they could not be removed again. for this reason, the owning player may declare that his unit is ‘fitting bayonets’ before a charge (at no cost in movement or orders) or as a response to a charge (in which case he issues only one die when performing closing fire, if allowed to do so). Mêlée is carried out in the usual way. however, the unit with plug bayonets now fitted cannot issue any fire again for the rest of the game! note that the owning player may choose to receive a charge or make a charge without fitting bayonets, in which case his unit is treated as using their muskets as clubs and will lose hand-to-hand dice as described above.\n\nfor example, a British infantry unit is advancing against Blenheim village when it is charged by french cavalry and soundly broken. the french player rolls a d6 and gets a 6, so the colours fall into enemy hands. the same french cavalry unit is then charged by British dragoons in the next turn, beaten in mêlée and is forced to retire. the British player rolls two dice and gets a 12 – the colours are recaptured and the honour of the infantry restored.\n\n“Capture the Colours!” during the eighteenth century, the number of enemy colours captured, along with artillery pieces, began to become a measure of victory. regiments were ferociously protective of\n\nif a unit is surrounded and forced to surrender, its colours are captured automatically. if a unit breaks and is destroyed in mêlée, the victor may roll a die. the roll of a 6 results in the capture of a colour. if a unit is beaten in mêlée and retires, the victor may roll two dice. a double six results in the capture of a colour. Capturing colours is difficult but not impossible.\n\nif a unit has its colours taken, remove the base with the colours on it from the unit and place it behind the enemy unit that captured it. the colours accompany the capturing unit for the rest of the game. units with no colours get -1 on their Break tests until their colours are recovered. if a game is drawn, whoever captured the most enemy colours gains the moral victory. the colonel of a regiment that lost its colours in battle will undoubtedly be sent into his tent with some brandy and a loaded pistol to do the honourable thing…\n\n1704: Marlborough wins the Battle of Blenheim\n\n17\n\nThe LasT arGuMenT oF KInGs defeated, such as Manteuffel’s command of the Prussian army, which was badly cut up by russian cavalry at Zorndorf in 1758. there are also examples of cavalry getting in amongst the infantry with little result, such as the leibgarde Battalion of infantry regiment 15 of the Prussian army, which was charged by the hesse-darmstadt dragoons who got in amongst them and forced the infantry to lie down for safety. having carried off the battalion guns and thinking they had destroyed the battalion to their satisfaction, the dragoons retreated, only to see the infantry pick themselves up, reform their ranks and continue the advance with drums and fifes playing!\n\naustrian ColuMns MarCh to the front\n\nDragoons. during the early part of the eighteenth century, many armies employed dragoons as piquets, foragers or scouts. When the enemy appeared, dragoons were often used more as mobile infantry than as battlefield cavalry. Where the dragoons special rule is shown in the army lists, apply the following. dragoons may ‘dismount’ automatically at the end of their move or on the spot if they have not moved without having to be ordered to do so and at no movement penalty. dragoons may fire whilst mounted, but do so with a -1 modifier. this simulates the dragoons riding to seize a position and dismounting quickly to hold it, or dismounting to fight when the enemy appear. note that the dragoons do not have to dismount and that this is the player’s choice. once dismounted the dragoons must either deploy in skirmish order or in line. in most cases the dragoon unit may have to be treated as a ‘small unit’ as they are often smaller than an equivalent infantry unit. While the unit is dismounted, it’s a nice touch to replace the cavalry figures with an equivalent number of infantry models. You might like to place horse holder figures with riderless horses behind the unit, to remind you that the infantry are dismounted dragoons. to get back on their horses, dragoons must receive a successful order to remount. it costs them half their movement to do so. this simulates the longer period required to bring up the horses, remount everyone and reform as a cavalry regiment.\n\nCavalry Charging Infantry Cavalry generally did not do well when they charged infantry to the front. this is partly due to training, as horses quite rightly did not relish the prospect of charging onto a line of bayonets. it was also, in some armies, due to outmoded tactics, where cavalry would advance at the trot and discharge firearms at the enemy line, hoping to disorder it and wheeling away if the fire failed. however, in many cases it was the disciplined fire of the infantry line that brought down the front ranks of the horses and sent the rear ranks into disorder and confusion, forcing them to retire. the best example of infantry defeating cavalry is Minden, where advancing British and hanoverian infantry tumbled the charging french cavalry to ruin, but other examples exist at fontenoy in 1745, and also the austrian regiment Botta at Kolin in 1757, which destroyed the attacking Prussian dragoons. Yet for every example where the infantry was victorious, there are just as many examples where it was 18\n\ninfantry did form squares during this period, but only when isolated or when about to be flanked, and this gives us the key. When infantry had secure flanks, they were happy to face cavalry, who could not lap around the exposed flanks and roll up their line. it is wrong to suggest that cavalry should not be allowed to charge formed infantry, as they obviously did. instead, we propose the following rules: during the resolution of combat results, infantry may count a secure flank as a +1 bonus against cavalry, even if the flank is not being supported by a friendly unit. the flank could be secured by a building, a redoubt or even terrain impassable to cavalry. the idea is, if cavalry cannot get round the infantry unit’s flank, count a +1 bonus for each secure flank. the infantry will obviously get the +1 bonus for any infantry supports to its rear or on other flanks as normal. in addition, any dice rolls of 6 thrown by the infantry during closing fire will disorder the cavalry and force them to use any remaining movement to retire directly back to their rear where they will be disordered. this represents the first rank of cavalry falling and causing the ranks behind to lose momentum and retire. Cavalry cannot close with steady infantry if disordered by closing fire but may always close with shaken or disordered infantry or skirmishers. these rules encourage the infantry to advance in ranks, supported in the rear and flanks, and to advance slowly, keeping pace with their battalion guns, which ensures that cavalry stay away. however, infantry that become isolated will be fair game to charging cavalry, and rightly so! it is important that all of these minor rule changes maintain the period flavour. this is not napoleonics after all!\n\nelephants in ancient and medieval battles, the elephant was the tank of its day, causing huge amounts of damage to units it charged whilst being impervious to many of the weapons used against it. the increased use of muskets, and more especially cannon, made the elephant obsolete, as a single ball or volley of muskets could fell one of these great beasts more easily than a hundred arrows. Yet elephants continued to appear in battle until the end of our period, particularly in india. We use the following rules to represent elephants on the wargames table. • depending on which scale you are using, you should have up to three models in a unit of elephants, which would provide a frontage roughly equal to a battalion. single elephants may be deployed on board but should be treated as a small unit, with a reduction in hand-to-hand and shooting values. • a single elephant model can benefit from being in march column if it is so declared by its owner, and suffers as such if contacted by an enemy. elephants may never move more than twice, and move as infantry (12\"). • Battalion guns may be mounted on some elephants, and may fire as such if the elephant has moved only once during its\n\n1705: An English fleet occupies Barcelona\n\nsPeCIaL ruLes turn (allowing the crew to reload, aim, etc.). an elephant’s crew armed with small arms may fire no matter how often the elephant has moved. • elephants always gain the heavy Cavalry +d3 rule (cavalry doesn’t come much heavier than this!). • Cavalry suffer a penalty of -1 to any break tests as a result of losing a mêlée against elephants. • armoured elephants increase their Morale save by one pip against muskets, but not against cannon. Whether armoured or not, elephants have a 3+ Morale save against any infantry armed only with mêlée weapons. • if a unit of elephants breaks as a result of a break test, it stampedes directly away from the enemy for two moves (24\"), interpenetrating all units in its way. the elephants are then removed from play. units interpenetrated by stampeding elephants immediately take a break test with a -1 modifier.\n\nGun Batteries and Battalion Guns for the first half of the eighteenth century, guns were not very manoeuvrable and once placed were difficult to move again, unlike the artillery of the later napoleonic period. to reflect this, we have one simple rule. foot artillery, once deployed, may not move other than to traverse right or left to fire at targets. artillery that comes on board limbered may move to the location the player wants, but once deployed must remain there for the rest of the game. it may not be limbered again or be manhandled forward. this may seem a little mean, but the use of artillery was still in its infancy and to allow the artillery too much rein in this period will negate the developments in the later eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. note that some armies, such as the Prussians, are allowed horse artillery, and others, such as Marlborough’s, have special rules that do allow artillery to move.\n\nMany of the armies in europe during the eighteenth century issued light battalion guns to each infantry battalion to provide close fire support. these guns were generally manhandled forward by the infantry as the battalion advanced. Whilst it is tempting to allocate another die of firing to units with battalion guns, this can make the number of dice excessive if used with the first fire special rule or with platoon firing. We suggest instead attaching one gun model to every three battalions. this model should be a light gun that can be manhandled forward by its crew (rules for manhandling artillery are on page 34 of the Black Powder rulebook. ranges for battalion guns are on page 54 of the rulebook). in all other respects, simply treat the model as an artillery piece using the normal rules. two battalions advancing abreast, with the third behind providing support and the battalion gun between the front two, presents dangerous firepower to the front and is remarkably durable in mêlée.\n\nThe army Lists throughout this supplement, we provide army lists for some of the more popular armies of the eighteenth century. We apologise wholeheartedly if, for reasons of space, your favourite armies or units are not represented. the aim of the lists is firstly to guide wargamers who are new to the period and give them an idea about how their army should look, and secondly as a check for more serious-minded gamers who need to make sure the sides are fair. at Black Powder, we tend to go for scenario-based games where we use as many figures as possible, and where fun is the name of the game. however, two gentlemen down at their club could quite happily pick two armies from the lists and make sure the sides are about even to save any cries of foul play when one side soundly thumps the other. the percentages given for certain troops types are suggestions only, and provided only to give the newcomer to the hobby a benchmark on which to build his army.\n\nA Conspicuous Act of Gallantry at the battle of dettingen, June 1743, the french Maison du roi cavalry regiment was advancing to charge the British infantry. two companies of Bland’s dragoons were ordered to countercharge, which they did to great effect, cutting through the french and out the other side, where they were met by a volley from waiting french infantry. they were forced to retire back through the ranks of the reforming french cavalry. trooper Brown saw the regiment’s guidon lying on the ground and bent down to retrieve it, but an enemy cut two fingers from his bridle hand and made off with the colour. Browne followed, killed the man and then single-handed fought his way back through the french to safety. his citation reads: “he had two horses killed under him, two fingers of ye bridle hand chopt off and after retaking the standard from ye gend’arms, whom he killed, he made his way through the lane of the enemy exposed to fire and sword, in the execution of which he received eight cuts in ye face and neck, two balls lodged in his back, three went through his hat and in this hack’d condition he rejoined his regiment who gave him three huzzas on his arrival”. at the end of the action, only two officers and a quarter of the men were fit for duty. Brown was knighted on the battlefield by King george ii (god bless him) and was the last man ever to be given this honour. his wounds were too severe to return to the regiment and so he retired with a pension of thirty pounds a year, which he used to drink himself to death over the next few years, dying in January 1746.\n\n1705: Swedes win the Battle of Warsaw\n\nMetal flask from the collection of James Gunn\n\n19\n\nThe War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714) it is difficult to imagine a more powerful king in 1700 than the sun King, louis Xiv of France, who had ruled over the most powerful state in europe for 57 years. victor in a number of european wars, his armies were the largest and most proficient on mainland europe. The only power that could hope to stand up to the louis Bourbon dynasty was the hapsburg dynasty in Austria. emperor leopold vi ruled over the Austrian empire, which included the German states of the holy roman empire and lands in hungary. Arguably, the next largest and most wealthy state in europe was spain. King carlos of spain was “more of a medical curiosity than a man”, so deformed was he by his family’s years of inbreeding. he defied all of his doctors by living into adulthood, but he had no offspring, and when he died in 1700, he left all of spain’s substantial lands to Philip, duc d’Anjou, the grandson of King louis Xiv of France. France was already the largest power in europe, and the thought of adding spain’s substantial lands in europe and overseas to the Bourbon empire terrified the royal heads of the other european powers. however, no one wanted another war in europe, and louis’ assurance that the two crowns of spain and France would never be united was taken at face value. despite his promises, the actions of the French king soon betrayed his intentions. French troops marched into the fortresses of the spanish netherlands, threatening the dutch republic, while spain quickly gave trading concessions to French merchants in its colonies and excluded other powers from its lucrative slave trade. The Austrian hapsburgs were forced into war to check louis’ ambition, and so began the War of the spanish succession. The British sided with the holy roman empire and joined its dutch allies in Flanders to begin a war with France. While the Austrians fought spain in its territories in italy, spain descended into civil war. The war was fought not only in europe but also the West indies and colonial north and south America where the conflict became known to the english colonists as Queen Anne’s War. Although there were now a number of allied states arrayed against France, victory was very far from assured. in fact, the war started badly for the allies and, by 1704, vienna was under threat from a Franco-Bavarian army. if it fell, Austria would be\n\nforced out of the war. it was at this time that a new British commander-in-chief, John churchill, duke of marlborough, was given an opportunity to try something daring. marching his Anglo-dutch army from Flanders to the danube in what was one of the greatest military achievements of its time, he was able to join forces with the imperialist army under Prince eugene of savoy and deliver a decisive defeat to the French at Blenheim. The duke then went on to deliver a series of defeats to the French which, combined with Prince eugene of savoy’s success elsewhere, forced louis to the negotiating table. The war was concluded by the treaties of Utrecht (1713) and rastatt (1714). As a result, Philip v remained King of spain but was removed from the French line of succession, averting a union of the two kingdoms. The Austrians gained most of the spanish territories in italy and the netherlands, whilst Britain gained vital trade concessions and overseas territories. France’s hegemony over continental europe was ended. The War of the spanish succession provides the wargamer with some of the largest battles fought during the eighteenth century, as well as numerous smaller encounters. This was one of the first wars where troops appeared in clearly identifiable uniforms and where the pike was no longer carried by the armies involved. linear tactics were just beginning to develop, and cavalry once again beginning to be used as ‘shock’ troops rather than as a mobile firing platform. in this war we see the beginning of black powder warfare that would reach its zenith during the napoleonic wars a century later. This was a war of ponderous manoeuvre when generals often opted for sieges and slow progression rather than risk everything in battle. however, this war was fought all across europe and in the colonies, and provides a great deal of wargaming potential. The period also provides great modelling opportunities, as this is a time when the colonels of regiments, in all of the armies involved, still had a great deal of influence in how their regiments were clothed, trained and what colours and weapons they carried. As a result there were units in a variety of different colours and facings within every army, which led to a good deal of confusion for the participants, but provides endless opportunity for painting and modelling your armies.\n\nThe Allied Army AdvAnces\n\n20\n\n1706: Marlborough wins the Battle of Ramillies\n\nJohn Churchill, Duke of Marlborough John churchill surely has a claim to be one of, if not the, greatest British general of all time. he was a page at the stuart court and gained an ensign’s commission in the 1st Foot Guards in 1667. he served overseas with the French army against the dutch (rather ironically), and rose to a position of prominence through his bravery and skill. he was second-in-command of the Government forces during the monmouth rebellion in 1685 and thus helped James ii secure his throne. however, marlborough saw which way the wind was blowing in 1689 when he abandoned James and offered his services to the new king, William of Orange, during the Glorious revolution. Although he served William well, marlborough could not help but keep in contact with the stuart court in exile, and was briefly imprisoned in the tower for his perceived treachery. marlborough’s wife, sarah, was friend and confidante to Queen Anne, and when she came to the throne he was once more restored to a position of power. When the War of the spanish succession began, Anne put marlborough forward as commander-in-chief of the allied armies in Flanders. For the next ten years, marlborough was to inflict defeat after defeat on the French at Blenheim (1704), ramillies (1706), Oudenarde (1708), and malplaquet (1709), and at numerous sieges and smaller actions such as the schellenberg in 1704. he managed to do this despite constant political backstabbing from Parliament at home, and all the while holding together a discordant coalition through consummate diplomatic skill. By 1711, his victories had made a march on Paris a reality, but the failure of peace talks with France were to be his undoing. he was accused of prolonging the war for his own ends, and he and his wife fell out of favour at the royal court at home. he was dismissed as captain General in disgrace, his enemies at court and in parliament having finally succeeded in blackening his name.\n\nAfter the war was over, he was returned to his position of captain General by the new hanoverian dynasty, and oversaw the 1715 rebellion in this post. marlborough died of a stroke in 1722. it is widely accepted that his victories over France raised england’s status in europe and thrust her onto the world stage. marlborough always looked after his men, who adored him in return, nicknaming him corporal John. They were proud to boast that he had never lost a battle and never failed to take a town he besieged.\n\nSpecial Rules Strategic Genius The duke of marlborough was an excellent strategist and always seemed to be able to move troops to where they were needed most to break the enemy’s line. if the duke of marlborough is represented in your game as an army commander, the following rule may be used: in the first turn of the game, the British player may place the duke of marlborough with any single brigade in his army. Orders are declared for this brigade as usual, but no dice are rolled. The brigade automatically gains three initial moves as though its controller had rolled the best score possible for orders (see page 24 of the Black Powder rulebook). Thereafter, the duke is treated as a normal army commander, with a staff rating of 9. This rule reflects marlborough’s strategic ability, and should allow the player to catch his opponent napping. Important Individual marlborough is a very important individual and his loss is too disastrous to contemplate. For this reason, he may never lead a unit into mêlée and cannot join a mêlée. if marlborough is captured or killed during the course of the battle, the best result the allies can obtain will be a draw, no matter how well they thump the Frenchies!\n\n1706: Sweden defeats Russia at the Battle of Grodno\n\n21\n\nThe LaST aRGumenT of KInGS The British army of the eighteenth Century Whilst the British army grew in size throughout the eighteenth century, it was never very large when compared to its continental neighbours. The British parliament was suspicious of a large standing army, fearing that the king could use it to enforce his rule. Obtaining funding for the army and maintaining its strength during peacetime was a constant battle and one that the army very often lost. A British regiment consisted of one battalion made up of ten companies of a hundred men, with one company designated as a grenadier company. it was common at the time of marlborough to combine grenadiers from a number of different regiments into one grenadier battalion, but this was not common practice by the time of the War of the Austrian succession, and was rarely used thereafter. instead grenadiers were posted either on the right of the line (the position of honour) or on both ends of the battalion line to stiffen the resolve of the new recruits. Although the battalion would number 1,000 men on paper, it was rare for a battalion on campaign to number more than 500. Battalions were named after the colonel who paid for them to be raised clothed and outfitted, and who ensured their daily upkeep. Under marlborough, for example, battalions are referred to as Bligh’s, mordaunt’s or handyside’s. in 1747, reforms were carried out by the duke of cumberland that required the regiments to be numbered in order of seniority. The royal scots, being the oldest regiment in the army, were named 1st Foot, and so on. regiments often retained a nickname or other name that identified where they were from. By the time of the seven years’ War, regiments are being referred to as the 42nd Black Watch, or 8th liverpool regiment, for example. At the beginning of the century, each company carried a flag or standard to identify itself, with the company colour and battalion flag being carried together by the first company of the battalion. initially, the battalion flags were based on the coat of arms of the colonel who controlled the battalion, and there were no regulations as to what could be depicted on the regimental standards. Following the 1747 regulations, however, all regiments had to carry one Union Flag and one regimental colour, which was to be the same colour as the regiment’s facings and was to have a small Union Flag in the corner next to the flagstaff. Throughout the century, regimental badges and distinctions were added to these new flags, which often incorporated badges unique to the regiments that carried them. company colours were often still carried by some regiments to assist with identification on the battlefield. At Fontenoy in 1745, for example, the royal Welch Fusiliers carried the Union Flag, the regimental colour and nine other company colours into battle. company colours had largely disappeared by the time of the seven years’ War. light infantry companies, although they were used during the war in canada, did not come into official use until 1770, when it was suggested that the tenth company of each of the line regiments be composed of light infantry. This is not to say that the notion of light infantry tactics was unknown to the British. Far from it. The Black Watch were deployed as light infantry during the Flanders campaign of 1745, for example, whilst light infantry and ranger companies were used in America during the French indian Wars. however, the British army was slow to realise the permanent need for specialist light infantry within formed battalions, but by 1770 every battalion had a light company. They were issued with distinctive leather caps, 22\n\nwere given shorter jackets and issued with lighter muskets, bayonets and hatchets. They were often detached to fight in separate battalions of light infantry. What this means for the wargamer is that a British regiment of twenty figures should contain two figures representing grenadiers (usually based together so you can detach them if necessary), with a central command group comprising of an officer, drummer and two standard bearers. One standard bearer should carry the regimental colour, which will usually be the same colour as the battalion’s facings. To his right, the other should carry the Union Flag or King’s colour. After 1770 you can include two figures to represent light infantry, again based together so they can be detached should you wish. British cavalry was split into two types: the ‘horse’ that represented all heavy cavalry, whose main role was to crash into the enemy and drive them off, and the dragoons that performed a light cavalry role as well as having the dual role of dismounted infantry. dragoons regularly dismounted and fought as assault troops during marlborough’s wars, but this practise declined as the century progressed, with the dragoons taking on more of a light cavalry role and eventually that of normal line cavalry. The ‘horse’ wore breastplates under their red jackets from 1707, but this was discontinued later on. most retained a steel skullcap worn under their tricorne to protect them against sword cuts. Although the duke of cumberland maintained a regiment of hussars during the Jacobite campaign of 1745, hussars, lancers and other exotic mounted regiments did not appear in european British armies of this period. cavalry regiments carried standards throughout the eighteenth century, but they had largely stopped doing so by the time of the napoleonic wars. dragoon regiments ca"
