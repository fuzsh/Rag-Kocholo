        "text": "Introduction\n\nEven before the Deportation of the Acadians from Acadia between 1755 and 1762, the deteriorating political situation had caused significant movements of the population. Toward the end of the 1740s, many families had already left English Acadia to settle on Ile-Saint-Jean. After the war of the Austrian Succession in 1748, a number of Acadians, accused by the English of collaboration with French forces, went to French territory. With the foundation of Halifax in 1749, the neighboring Acadian villages, Mirligouèche and Chezzetcook, were abandoned. By 1750, most of the inhabitants of Cobequit and almost half the families of the neighboring village, Pigiguit, had abandoned their houses and their lands and crossed the Red Sea (Northumberland Strait) to settle on Ile-Saint-Jean. Others went to Ile-Royale. In the spring of 1750, following orders given by French authorities, the village of Beaubassin was burned, obliging nearly a thousand Acadians to leave their lands in English Acadia to go to French territory, on the other side of the Mésagouèche River. A few months later, the Acadian villages of Nanpan, Maccan, Les Planches, La Butte, Ouechkok, Hébert and Menoudie were in turn burned and the inhabitants were also obliged to relocate in French territory. Thus, even before the deportations carried out by the English, the Acadian population had undergone migrations, even forcible ones.\n\nThe deportation of 1755 systematically emptied the Acadian villages of English Acadia. On October 13, seven English ships transported Acadians from the region of Chignectou toward exile. The inhabitants of Les Mines (Grand-Pré, Rivière-aux-Canards and Pigiguit) were deported aboard 14 ships on October 27, with supplementary deportations on December 13 and 20 on four other ships. The population of Annapolis Royal was deported on six ships on December 8. The Acadians of Cap-Sable followed their compatriots to exile in 1756 and again in 1758, this time along with men, women and children captured during the raids on the Saint-John and Petcoudiac Rivers.\n\nSeveral hundred Acadians who had escaped these deportations by fleeing toward the north, to Bouctouche, to Richibouctou, to the Miramichi and the Baie de Chaleurs, were obliged, because of the lack of provisions, to go to Québec or to Ile-Saint-Jean. For the same reason, many were sent on from the latter place to Québec.\n\nIn 1755, Acadians mainly from Nova Scotia, with some from what is now New Brunswick, were dispersed along the American coast, from Massachusetts to Georgia. In the spring of 1756, those deported to Virginia, numbering more than 1,100, were sent on to England. Other Acadians, deported to Georgia and South Carolina, tried to return to Acadia and at least three groups headed north by boat early in 1756. Only the first group of five families succeeded in returning to Acadia, arriving in June,1756. The other two groups were stopped in the colonies of Massachusetts and New York respectively. At the same time, many men among the 160 that were deported from Chignectou to Georgia and South Carolina without their wives and children also tried to escape and return to Acadia. At least two groups, for a total of 33 men, succeeded in 1756. Others arrived in Canada from Georgia and South Carolina in the 1760s to rejoin their families.\n\nIn 1758 the deportation of the Acadians of Ile-Saint-Jean and Ile-Royale took place. Because, unlike the Acadians of Nova Scotia, these were subjects of the king of France, they were transported directly to France. The voyages of these ships across the Atlantic were therefore much longer and more dangerous than those of the ships sent along the American coast in 1755. Three of the 1758 ships sank, with the loss of about 850 Acadian lives. Because of very difficult conditions for passengers traveling over long distances on a winter sea, the death rate, especially among children, had been very high when the boats arrived at their ports of destination in France.\n\nAmong the Acadian refugees who remained along the shores of the Baie des Chaleurs, many were brought to Halifax in 1760 and deported to Massachusetts in 1762. Among them were Acadians from the St. John River who had returned from Canada to Acadia after the fall of Québec in 1759. But this time, the government in Boston refused to accept them and sent them back to Halifax. These deportations from 1755 to 1762 set off a series of migrations, displacements and wandering which, for some, lasted until 1816.\n\nAt the end of the Seven Years War in 1763, the Acadian population had been scattered widely. In Acadia, there were still almost 3,000 Acadians refugees in Halifax, at Fort Edward (Pigiguit), at the Baie des Chaleurs, at Ristigouche, on Ile-Saint-Jean and on Ile-Royale. In Canada (Québec) there were also nearly 2,000, but they were soon ravaged by an epidemic of smallpox. In the American colonies there were more than 5,000 Acadian exiles. In England, of the 1,100 persons who had arrived in 1756, there remained only 753 survivors of another smallpox epidemic, to which were added some children born in England. And in France there were only about 2,000 survivors of the more than 3,000 deported from Ile-Saint-Jean, from Ile-Royale and from Halifax.\n\nFinally free to move, the Acadians detained in the Anglo-American colonies dispersed and during the next few years there were major migrations of these Acadian exiles. While some chose to stay where they had been deported, especially in Maryland and Pennsylvania, the great majority left, usually to go to the closest French territory. Whereas the Acadians detained in New York and the southern colonies went mostly to the French Antilles, a first small group of 21 people left Georgia to settle in Louisiana. Other Acadians, who had gone to settle in the Antilles after 1763, followed them there later. However, a few families deported to South Carolina succeeded in making the trip to Philadelphia and even as far as Canada around 1760. On the other hand, the Acadians detained in the northern colonies mostly went to Canada, which was still French-speaking and Catholic, even if now under English rule, and to the French territory of Saint-Pierre- et-Miquelon. Some families, especially among those who were in Massachusetts, returned to Acadia, sometimes by way of Miquelon. Many of the Acadians who had managed to remain in Acadia, or to return, also went to Miquelon. Others, a group of about 600 Acadians who had been detained at Fort Edward, at Fort Beauséjour and in Halifax, rented boats to go to the Antilles and then on to Louisiana. The Acadians in England were repatriated to France.\n\nFor many Acadians, such as those who went to Canada, their major travels were over. For others, these continued for several decades. In France, the Acadian refugees were wards of the State in the Atlantic seaports. Two great projects to implant them in France were attempted. The establishment of Acadians on Belle-Ile-en-Mer had the more success, but even there only one third of the 78 Acadian families who received concessions remained permanently. That of la Ligne acadienne was to settle Acadians on farms in Poitou. Though it attracted nearly 1,400 Acadians, the majority soon abandoned it because the land was poor and the promised conditions had not been provided. Other projects to settle the Acadians who were in France had even less success. Acadian families were sent to South America to colonize Guyana and the Falkland Islands. In the first group, the rate of mortality was very high; the second group returned to France shortly after. Some Acadian families settled permanently in the French ports, especially in Bretagne. Others began to return to Acadia or to Canada in the 1770s. However, the majority left France to go settle in Louisiana in 1785.\n\nThe Acadians who underwent the most deportations were those of Miquelon. In 1767, the French government sent them to France because the arrival of so many Acadian refugees had overpopulated the colony. Rather than go to France, a few Acadian families chose to return to Acadia. The following year, when the French government revoked its decision, the majority of these Acadians deported to France returned, only to be deported once again to France by the English in 1778 and in 1794. A few people underwent up to four deportations, one of whom was Marie-Blanche LeBlanc. In 1755 she was deported with her parents to South Carolina from where her family returned to Acadia to go to Ile-Saint-Jean in 1756. In 1758, they were deported again by the English, this time to France from where Marie-Blanche returned to Miquelon. She underwent the deportations from Miquelon in 1778 and in 1794. Finally she settled in Québec. It is only in 1816 that the Acadians of Miquelon, who had been deported in 1794, had the right to return to Miquelon. Their return constitutes the last great migration of Acadians caused directly by the Deportation more than 60 years earlier.\n\nACADIAN ODYSSEY: DEPORTATIONS AND MIGRATIONS (1755 - 1816)\n\n1755\n\nJune 16, 1755\n\nCapture of forts Beauséjour and Gaspareau (the next day, June 17) by English forces.\n\nJuly 3, 1755\n\nAcadian representatives go to Halifax, but all refuse to take an unconditional oath of allegiance.\n\nJuly 13, 1755\n\nThe lieutenant governor, Charles Lawrence, in a letter to Lt.
