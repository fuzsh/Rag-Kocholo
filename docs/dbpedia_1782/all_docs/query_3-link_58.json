        "text": "The Royal Navy.\n\nThe Royal Navy made Britain's trade boom and prosper,\n\nit sustained its colonies and reshaped its politics.\n\nThe sailor enjoyed greater popular respect than the soldier.\n\n.\n\nThe Royal Navy made Britain's trade boom and prosper, it sustained its colonies and reshaped its politics. The sailor enjoyed greater popular respect than the infantryman, artillerist or the cavalryman. King George III in Speech From the Throne addressed the assembled Houses of Parliament and said: \"... my Navy is the principle article of our natural strength, it gives me much satisfaction ...\"\n\nThe navy enabled England to avoid prolonged land wars on the European Continent. The English Channel has often enough proved to be British army's salvation. After failed expedition the troops would retreat on the island and lick their wounds. In comparison the European territories, populaces and armies were exposed to repeated and unabated invasions by the enemy. Against England there was no broder just to be marched across. Isolation gave the opportunity to enter wars and intrigues selectively. The geography matters, it makes people who they are.\n\nThe British fleet greatly increased in size, from about 500 in 1793 to approx. 950 vessels in 1805. The principal royal dockyards were in Woolwich, Plymouth and Portsmouth and they worked on all cylinders. Portsmouth had been the embarkation point for some of the Royal Navy's greatest victories but also its worst defeats.\n\nThe British navy empolyed leading shipwrights from other countries, particularly after the French Revolution caused many royalists to flee from France. For example Marc Brunel carried out many improvements in the British dockyards, Barrallier designed several warships for the Royal Navy. The Royal Navy had paid particular attention to French prizes and many improvements in hull design had come from them. The French warship Courageaux was directly copied many times.\n\nDanish ships were occasionally influential, like the captured Christian VII.\n\nThe largest British ships-of-the-line:\n\n- Caledonia - 120 guns\n\n- Ville de Paris - 110-114 guns\n\n- Hibernia - 110 guns\n\n- Victory - 100-104 guns\n\nOn Victory : on forecastle 2 very heavy 68pdr (Carronades) and 2 12 pdrs\n\non Quarter Deck 12 12pdr, on Upper Deck 30 12pdr, on Middle Deck 28 24pdr\n\nand on the Lower Deck 30 32pdr\n\n.\n\nVictories and defeats of the Royal Navy 1680-1815.\n\nFrom the beginning of the 19th century until well into the\n\n20th century it was the most powerful navy in the world.\n\nFrance and Britain were in war for several centuries. France had to divide its military and financial power between land and sea, while Britain could direct its main strength onto the world's oceans. A series of victories over the French marked the naval wars: Russell's at Barfleur and La Hogue in 1692, Anson's off Cape Finisterre in 1747, Hawke's at Quiberon Bay in 1759, and Howe's on the Glorious First of June in 1794.\n\nThe wars of the 18th century produced a series of tactically indecisive naval battles between evenly matched fleets (British and French) in line ahead, such as Malaga (1704), Rügen Island (1715), Toulon (1744), Minorca (1756), Negapatam (1758), Cuddalore (1758), Pondicherry (1759), Ushant (1778), Dogger Bank (1781), the Chesapeake (1781), Hogland (1788) and Öland (1789). Although a few of these battles had important strategic consequences, like the Chesapeake which the British needed to win, all were tactically indecisive.\n\nMany admirals began to believe that a contest between the two fleets could not produce a decisive result. The tactically decisive actions of the 18th century were all chase actions, where one fleet was clearly superior to the other, such as the two battles of Finisterre (1747), Lagos (1759), Quiberon Bay (1759) and Cape St. Vincent (1780).\n\nIn 1793 at French Royalists invitation, British and Spanish forces occupied Toulon, the main French naval base on the Mediterranean. Bonaparte first made his name here as a young officer of artillery, by spotting an ideal place for his guns to be set up in such a way that they dominated the city's harbour. Once this was done (by means of a sharp assault on an enemy position), the British Navy ships under Admiral Hood and the Spaniards under Juan de Langara were compelled to withdraw, and the resistance crumbled.\n\nBritish naval innovation was retarded by an unseemly dispute between two admirals in the aftermath of the Battle of Toulon. The British fleet under Admiral Mathews had been unable to draw level with the French fleet, and Mathews ordered an attack anyway, intending all the British ships to attack the French rear. He had no signals by which he could communicate his intentions, and the rear squadron under Vice Admiral Lestock, his rival and second-in-command, obtusely remained at the prescribed intervals in line ahead, far to the rear of the action.\n\nA subsequent series of courts martial, in which political influence was brought to bear by Lestock's friends in Parliament, punished Mathews and those captains who had supported him in the battle, and vindicated Lestock. In several future actions, Admirals who were tempted to deviate from the Admiralty's fighting instructions were reminded of Mathews's fate.\n\nNelson made his name with his contribution to Jerviss victory over the Spanish at Cape St.Vincent in 1797. It was one of the opening battles of the Anglo-Spanish War (17961808), as part of the French Revolutionary Wars. The British fleet (15 ships-of-the-line and 5 frigates) defeated the Spanish (27 ships-of-the-line and 7 frigates) under Admiral Don José de Córdoba y Ramos. Admiral Jervis sent a squadron under Nelson into the Mediterranean the following year. That squadron e-established British command of the Mediterranean at the Battle of the Nile.\n\nIn 1797 however the Spanish fleet heavily defeated Nelson at the Battle of Tenerife. Nelson's expedition counted 400 guns and 4,000 men. The Spaniards were led by Antonio Gutierrez, a two-time victor over the British. They had hastened to prepare a defence following the British raid in April. In the battle the Spanish suffered only 70 dead and wounded. Nelson withdrew with the loss of several hundred casualties and his arm. The British never again tried to capture Santa Cruz de Tenerife.\n\nThe French Revolution of 1793 halted the French naval revival and the professional skills of French naval personnel declined. This created an opportunity for the remarkable successes of the Royal Navy in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. In 1798 Rear Admiral Horatio Nelson (14 ships-of-the-line) defeated the French (13 ships-of-the-line and 4 frigates) at Aboukir Bay. French casualties have been estimated to have been as high as 2,300 dead and wounded, and 3,000 captured. British losses were 895 dead and wounded. News of the victory was delayed reaching Britain as Leander, returning home with Nelson's dispatches, was captured after a fierce battle by the surviving 74-gun Le Généreux. The battle of Aboukir Bay established British naval superiority during the remainder of the French Revolutionary Wars.\n\nIn 1801 the French troops in Egypt comfortably returned in British ships to France,\n\nfree to serve again, in accordance with the terms of an earlier convention.\n\nIn August 1805 the best French admiral, La Touche-Treville suddenly died and Napoleon replaced him with Pierre Villeneuve. The tensions between the French and Spanish admirals were high - the French commander Villeneuve accusing the Spanish commander Gravina of cowardice the night before the fleet sailed from Trafalgar. Villeneuve did indeed predict Admiral Nelson's attack quite accurately, yet he was at a loss to respond.\n\nThe British gunners were better trained than their Spanish and French counterparts, and\n\nthe use of new signaling methods by the British played a significant role in the combat.\n\nThe Battle of Trafalgar, which began at midday, was terminated about five. The Royal Navy lost 1.690 men killed and wounded incl. Admiral Nelson who was killed by a French sharpshooter. Hastily carried below so as not to be seen by Victory's crew as they fought on, Nelson was taken down to the cockpit where he died 3 hours later. Before he died he said: \"They have done for me at last\" said Nelson \"my backbone is shot through !\" The Bellerophon's captain also received a fatal shot from a French sniper.\n\nThe casualties of the French and Spanish fleets were very heavy, they lost 4.500-7.000 men and many ships-of-the-line. The decisive British victory at Trafalgar ended Napoleon's power on the sea and made any French invasion of Britain virtually impossible. Following the battle, the British navy was never again seriously challenged by the French fleet in a large-scale engagement.\n\nAlthough the British navy dominated the high seas after Trafalgar, the \"coast war\" was far from being over. It was the permanent concern of the British, to harm France by preventing any merchant ships other than those of Britain from reaching continental ports. And it is the permanent concern of the French, commanding the land, to prevent British vessels entering those same ports.\n\nFurthermore, although Napoleon's invasion of England never materialized, he could freely campaign \"deep into Spain, Austria, and Russia, leaving his coasts lightly garrisoned by second-line troops, without much worry over a British invasion.\" ( - Esposito & John Elting, USA )\n\nIn March 16th 1807 the Royal Navy and 5,000 troops invaded and occupied Alexandria in Egypt to cause \"a very great degree distress to the Constantinopole\". Whatever was the motivation, \"the attack on Alexandria could be viewed diplomatically only in the worst possible light.\" It backfired as this action ended in failure as the native forces crushed British infantry inflicting \"almost 1,400 casualties\". It forced the British troops to abandon the idea of expanding the conquered territory, and they were confined only to the city.\n\nIn September 1807, British ambassador from Constantinopole, Arbuthnot, had already pressed for warships to be sent to bully the Turks. Admiral Collingwood sent number of ships to the Dardanelles and shortly after this the British Cabinet decided to send Vice-Admiral Duckworth with more ships to the Turkish capital \"to demand the immediate surrender of the Turkish Fleet , together with that of supply of naval stores from the arsenal ...\"\n\nThe Turks however showed no signs of being intimidated. They cannonaded the British forcing them to a hastily retreat on March 3rd. The British barely escaped being battered by 300 cannons. This action ended up in humiliation for the Royal Navy.\n\nDespite the loss of many ships in the Battle of Copenhagen in 1801, Denmark-Norway still maintained a considerable navy. In 1806 the majority of the Danish army was at this time defending the southern border against possible attack from the French. There was concern in Britain that Napoleon might try to force Denmark to close the Baltic Sea to British ships. The British believed that access to the Baltic was important to Britain for trade and that it gave the Royal Navy access to help Britain's allies Sweden and (before Tilsit) Russia against France. Britain's Foreign Secretary, Lord Howick, had tried unsuccessfully to persuade Denmark into a secret alliance with Britain and Sweden. British troops under General Wellesley defeated a Danish force of militia at Køge, south of Copenhagen.\n\nThe Danes rejected British demands to surrender, so the British fleet under Admiral Gambier bombarded the city from 2 to 5 September 1807, killing 2,000 civilians and destroying 30 % of the buildings. Then during armistice they carried off the Danish fleet and \"all the naval stores in the arsenal.\"\n\nIn 1808 according to the Convention of Cintra the French troops with all its equipment and plunder (!) were again transfered safely on British ships. This time from Portugal to France. (In 1801 the French troops in Egypt returned in British ships to France.)\n\nIn 1808, the British fleet and expeditionary force sent to help Sweden against Russian aggression proved powerless to prevent the Russian conquest of Finland. The British navy gained control of the Baltic Sea, but - as in 1715-1721 - could only parade impotently without seriously hindering Russian operations. Sweden capitulated in September 1809.\n\nIn 1809 a Portuguese-British naval squadron took French Guiana for the Portuguese Empire.\n\nWith the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1814 the region was handed back to the French.\n\nIn 1812 war broke out with USA after disputes made worse by the blockade. Despite having their coastline blocked by the British warships, the American raiders who eluded the Royal Navy net caused considerable damage to Britain's trade. By mid-1814, more than 800 British vessels had been taken, forcing the Royal Navy to escort trade convoys. Furthermore, in several small naval battles the American warships defeated the schooners, sloops and other smaller vessels of the fearsome Royal Navy.\n\nFor example in October 1812 the 44-gun United States, took on the British 38-gunner Macedonian off Madeira. Bombarding from long range, the United States pulverised the enemy ship and forced it to surrender. To add insult to British injury, the Macedonian was repaired, reflagged and fought again - this time for America.\n\nIn December a duel between two frigates (American Constitution and British Java) took place off Brazil and, once again, ended in an American victory. It took two hours, but the Java was left a wreck and its captain forced to surrender. However, the Americans had no ships-of-the-line, thus by the end of the Napoleonic Wars the Royal Navy was still unchallenged mistress of the oceans.\n\nPS.\n\nIn the second British-Dutch War several major battles took place, nearly all of them on English territory. It was during this period that the battle of Chatham (1667) took place, arguably the worst naval defeat in English history until this very day.\n\n.\n\nRoyal Navy's contribution to\n\nWellington's victory in Peninsula.\n\nWithout the Royal Navy, Britain's campaign in Spain\n\nand Portugal could never have been waged.\n\nWithout the Royal Navy, Great Britain's campaign in Spain and Portugal could never have been waged and certainly not with the success that was eventually achieved. Gates writes, \"As well as ferrying troops to and from the war zone, the fleet transported virtually all the gold, equipment, food and munitions used by the Allied armies and guerillas. ... Moreover, whereas the lack of any naval support of their own confined the French to moving via the appalling Peninsular roads, the Allied forces could frequently transport men and material by sea; a method that was invariably safer, cheaper and quicker.\n\nThis provided them with enormous advantages in the fields of logistics and strategy. ... Eternally threatened with landings on the sea-shore, their [French] army had to detach thousands of badly needed troops to patrol beaches, garrison ports and man coastal batteries. In 1810, for example, two Allied squadrons - based on Ferrol and Corunna - tied down some 20,000 Imperial soldiers along the Biscay coast. A further 20,000 soldiers were needed to invest the naval base at Cadiz, and several thousands more spent their time fruitlessly chasing Allied detachments that constantly embarked and disembarked along the Andalusian coast. Very few of these men ever saw an enemy ship or soldier, but they had to be deployed to counter the possible threat of attack. Furthermore, the sea-shore guards frequently became targets in themselves. Required to patrol enormous lengths of coastline, they were invariably thin on the ground and easy prey for amphibious forces composed of thousands of men.\" (Gates - \"The Spanish Ulcer\" p 29)\n\nDuring 1811 the British-Portuguese army did not share the fate of that of Massena, was almost entirely the responsibility of the Royal Navy. In sharp contrast to the Allied army, the French supply network was constantly disrupted by guerilla bands and the rebellious population.\n\nConsequently, the operations of the French army were repeatedly undermined or delayed by shortages of such basic equipment as munitions, horses, weapons and money. Unable to rely on their forces being adequately supplied by convoy, French marhsals had to resort to extracting provisions locally - much to the annoyance of the populace.\n\nThe total British naval dominance lasted until 1812, when the USA interfered, albeit indirectly, on the side of the French. In 1812 the war with USA broke out and American privateers arrived on European and African coast. The Royal Navy was forced to devote hundreds of warships to a blockade of the American coast. \"Then the American privateers, being unmolested, ran down the coast of Africa, intercepted the provision trade from the Brazils, one of the principal resources of the army, and emboldened by impunity infested the coast of Portugal, captured 14 ships loaded with flour off the Duoro, and a large vessel in the very mouth of the Tagus.\" (Napier - Vol IV, p 185)\n\nThe French naval vessels, backed by a powerful force of privateers and American ships, instigated a relentless campaign againt British vessels, and by summer 1814, about 800 merchantmen had been sunk, damaged or captured, many of them in home waters. Gates writes, \"With ships like USS 'Argus' rampaging up and down the English Channel, Wellington's formerly smooth supply system was appreciably disrupted.\"\n\nMiscellaneous.\n\n(Royal Navy's rivals and allies.)\n\n.\n\nComparison of naval strength in 1808-1809:\n\n- Great Britain: 113 ships-of-the-line\n\n- France: 45\n\n- Spain: 45\n\n- Russia: 34\n\n- Denmark: 21\n\n.\n\nSpanish Navy (Armada Española).\n\nIn 19th century the Spanish navy was in decline.\n\nAt Trafalgar many of the Spanish crews were land soldiers,\n\nrecently press-ganged beggars and peasants, with some not\n\neven having fired a cannon on board of a rolling warship.\n\nThe Spanish navy is responsible for notable achievements in history such as the discovery of America, the first world circumnavigation, and the discovery of a maritime path from the Far East to America across the Pacific Ocean (Urdaneta's route). The Spanish navy reached its zenith in the 16th Century. Since then until the Seven Years War it was one of the most powerful navies in the World. Although the Seven Years War was not a positive experience for the Spaniards, their navy did a good job in the 18th century given the fact that they were outgunned and outmanned by the British. The results speak for themselves.\n\nSpain was able to successfully maintain her vast American empire vitually intact despite frequent British Navy attacks. It was only when revolutionary movements in her American empire that Spain lost most of her territories and not because of British actions.\n\nIn 1588 the Spanish Armada (22 galleons and 108 armed merchant vessels) sailed against England under the command of the Duke of Medina Sidonia. The English navy had 34 warships and 163 armed merchant vessels. The Spanish fleet reached and anchored outside Gravelines, but, while awaiting communications from Parma's army, it was driven out by an English fire ship attack. In the ensuing battle, the Spanish fleet was forced to abandon its rendezvous. The Armada managed to regroup and withdraw north, with the English fleet harrying it for some distance up the east coast of England. The commander decided that the fleet should return to Spain; it sailed around Scotland and Ireland, but severe storms disrupted it. More than 24 vessels were wrecked on the western coasts of Ireland. Of the fleet's initial 130 ships, about 50 never returned to Spain.\n\nThe following year Elizabeth I launched the English Armada, or Counter Armada, under Sir Francis Drake, but it was unsuccessful in its goals, resulting in Phillip II retaining some naval superiority. Spain's navy quickly recovered and shipped a greatly increased amount of precious metals from the Americas.\n\nFor a very long time the Spanish Empire remained a major target of British navy. In 1704 Admiral Rooke captured Gibraltar which became the major British base in the western Mediterranean. When war broke out in 1739, Admiral Anson took a squadron to prey on Spanish trade.\n\nIn 19th century the Spanish navy was in decline and suffered several defeats. In 1805 forced to the battle by Napoleon, the Franco-Spanish fleet was defeated at Trafalgar. The battle exposed the futility of using inexperienced crews against the veteran British sailors. Many of the Spanish crews were land soldiers, recently press-ganged beggars and peasants, with some not even having fired a cannon on board of a rolling ship, in contrast to the heavily drilled British crews who had seen many actions by this time. This had come about by the loss of many experienced sailors to an epidemic of the yellow fever in 180204, as well as being a traditional cost saving measure. The French admiral ignored the pleas of the Spanish captains - who had long experience in breaking blockades (and held no illusions about the state of their fleet) to wait for better conditions in which to leave the port.\n\nThe largest ship of the Spanish fleet during the Napoleonic Wars was the Santissima Trinidad with 130 guns (!) Actually it was the largest ship-of-the-line in the world. The second largest was British Caledonia with 120 guns. Santissima Trinidad in fact repressented a very old fashioned idea of ship design and it sailed very badly. Even the Spanish admiral recommeded that she be used only for the defence of Cadiz harbor.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe French Navy (Marine nationale, La Royale).\n\nFrance was not a maritime nation in the same as Britain, Portugal\n\nor Spain, and her navy always took second place to the army.\n\nPre-revolutionary officers had been aristocratic, professional and\n\nwell trained. The Revolution however caused them to flee the country.\n\nAnglo-French rivalry was fuelled by the two nations' desire to control colonial trade. The French government condemned the \"oceanocrats\" and claimed to be the defender of maritime freedom and the protector of neutral nations. French ships typically fired their cannons on the upward roll of the ship, disabling their opponents but doing little damage to the enemy ships or their crews. British and Dutch ships, by contrast, tended to use the opposite tactic of firing on the downward roll into the enemy hulls, causing a storm of flying splinters that killed and maimed the enemy gun crews. The French frigates were excellent, while their ships-of-the-line not so. It was however the French navy that made possible the American victory in the American Revolution.\n\nPre-revolutionary officers had been aristocratic, professional and well trained. The Revolution however caused them to flee the country. Many ended up in Britain. During the Napoleonic Wars the French warships were blocked in port by the Royal Navy. Frequent gun practice while under sail gave the British navy's gunners an advantage over the blocked French. Another advantage was the new flintlock firing mechanisms that allowed for more accurate sighting on the cannon. In battle the French aimed at the rigging rather than the hulls of their opponents. It resulted that British casualties were often remarkably light compared with those of the French.\n\n\"Trafalgar permanently crippled the Spanish navy, but the French soon recovered.\n\nEven as the English maneuvered to intercept Villeneuve, the Rochefort squadron put to sea in a long, destructive raid. Napoleon strengthened his Brest and Rochefort fleets, rebuilt the Toulon fleet, and began constructing a new one at Antwerp. Antwerp - a \"pistol pointed at the heart of England\" - was an ideal base for a cross-channel attack. The Boulogne flotilla was kept until 1811; Napoleon also made considerable efforts to develop an effective Italian navy, but without success. ... (Esposito & Elting - \"A Military History and Atlas of the Napoleonic Wars.\") This is interesting that already in 1813 the French navy was back at its pre-war strength.\n\n\"Although Napoleon 'lost' the war at sea effectively from 1805, his naval strategy against Great Britain remained surprisingly effective. ... By keeping his surviving squadrons ready for sea (or capable of being rapidly made so) at Brest, Rochfort, or Toulon, he kept the Royal Navy at full stretch on blockade duties, and the task of hunting down a small French break-out force was incommensurately expensive in terms of vessels and effort.\" (Chandler - \"Dictionary of the Napoleonic Wars\" p 177)\n\nThe French corsairs of the Napoleonic Wars enjoyed numerous successes against the British ships. Many captains made names for themselves - L'Hermitte, Leduc and Troude, for example. St.Malo, Nantes and Marseille were one of the premier corsair ports. Their activities caused a considerable panic in British commercial circles.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe Russian Navy.\n\nAlthough Britain was Russia's ally against Napoleon,\n\nthe British were concerned about the Russian fleet's\n\ngrowing strength in the Mediterranean.\n\nBritain was especially troubled by Russia's newly-\n\nattained strategic position in the Ionian Islands.\n\nThe Russian navy was one of the youngest of European navies. In 1696 Tsar Peter the Great issued order about forming the Navy on Azov Sea. The next year was opened Naval School in Moscow, afterwards it has been moved to Azov.\n\nIn 1798, the Russian fleet was officially divided into two formations:\n\n- on Baltic Sea were: 45 ships-of-the-line and 19 frigates\n\n- on Black Sea were: 15 ships-of-the-line and 10 frigates\n\nThat same year new navigation schools were established to replace the \"navigator's companies.\" In St. Petersburg and Nikolayev maritime academies were opened for shipbuilding.\n\nIn 1798, Russia and Turkey became unlikely allies after the French seized Malta and Napoleon began his Egyptian campaign. Vice-Admiral Ushakov's squadron passed through the Dardanelles and, after joining Turkish Admiral Kadyr Bey, headed for the French-occupied Ionian Islands. The allied fleet numbered 11 Russian and 4 Turkish ships-of-the-line, 6 Russian and 4 Turkish frigates, and 3 Russian and 8 Turkish gunboats.\n\nFrom September to November, detachments of Ushakov's fleet seized French fortifications on the islands of Cerigo, Zante, Cephalonia, and Saint Mauro. In addition, Ushakov made a landing on Corfu and delivered the first blow to Vido Island. The Russian fleet now possessed a strategically located base in the Mediterranean. Russian warships were dispatched from Corfu to attack French supply routes and assist Allied forces in Italy. In 9 days Sorokin's detachment took the towns of Brindisi, Mola and Bari, and Vice-Admiral Pavel Pustoshkin's squadron blockaded Ancona. On 3 June 1799, the Russians joined the Naples troops in the liberation of Naples.\n\nNow the Russian goal was Malta which was under siege by the British without any noticeable success. Although Great Britain was Russia's ally against Napoleon, the English were concerned about the Russian fleet's growing strength in the Mediterranean. England was especially troubled by Russia's newly-attained strategic position in the Ionian Islands. The British began to delay operations on Malta, not accepting Russia's offer of assistance.\n\nDuring this time a detachment of 4 Russian frigates and 10 gunboats, joined the British fleet off the coast of Egypt. Although Russia had no plans for involvement in the Egyptian campaign, Nelson attempted to dispatch Ushakov and his Russian forces to Egypt. A compromise was reached, and it was decided to send only the squadron of Kartsov. Ushakov was senior to Nelson in rank, and in the anticipated operations on Malta the British would have to follow the Russian officer's orders, an arrangement that further rankled the British. In any event, the Malta campaign did not materialize. In late December 1799, Ushakov received an order to cease action in the Mediterranean and return with his fleet to the Black Sea. Only a few Russian vessels remained on Corfu, while the Ionian Islands became a republic under Russian control. (Source: \"The History of Russian Navy\")\n\nIn 1803 Russian fleet consisted of:\n\n- 27 ships-of-the-line and 26 frigates on Baltic Sea\n\n- 21 ships-of-the-line and 8 frigates on Black Sea\n\nIn early 1806 Vice-Admiral Senyavin entered the Ionian Sea with a large squadron. Within a year Senyavin had under his command 16 ships-of-the-line and 7 frigates as well as numerous small transports. The port of Corfu served as an operational base while the admiral commanded an infantry division for land operations against the French. In May at the request of the French, the Austrians, detained several Russian merchant vessels at Trieste. Senyavin rushed without delay to rescue his compatriots, taking 3 ships-of-the-line and 1 frigate. He demanded the release of the vessels within one hour, and, indeed, they were set free.\n\nIn February of 1807, after being informed of the outbreak of war with Turkey, Senyavin departed from Corfu for the Aegean Sea with the main body of his fleet and a number of ground troops. According to the Tilsit Treaty, Russia made its departure from the Mediterranean Sea to the relief of the French and the English.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe American Navy.\n\nThe Americans were very frustrated with Great Britain.\n\nIn August 1807 USA president Jefferson wrote to T Leiper:\n\n\"I never expected to be under the necessity of wishing\n\nsuccess to Bonaparte. But the English being equally\n\ntyrannical at sea as he is on land, ... I say, down with England.\"\n\nThe American Navy traces its origins to the Continental Navy, which was established during the American Revolutionary War (17751783) and was essentially disbanded as a separate entity shortly thereafter. In the beginning of the American Revolutionary War, the establishment of a navy was an issue of debate in Congress. Supporters argued that a navy would protect shipping and defend the coast. Detractors countered that challenging the British Navy was a foolish idea. George Washington commissioned 7 cruisers to interdict British supply ships, and reported the captures to the Congress. This effectively ended the debate as to whether or not to \"provoke\" the British navy by establishing a Navy as Washington's ships had already captured British ships, somewhat a provocation. The american navy achieved mixed results; it was successful in a number of engagements and raided many British merchant vessels, but it lost 24 of its vessels.\n\nDepredations against American shipping by Barbary Coast pirates in the Mediterranean Sea (today Tunis, Morocco, and Algiers) spurred US Congress to pass the Naval Act of 1794 ordering the construction and manning of six frigates. It included three frigates with 44 guns and based on the most advanced designs: the Constitution, the President and the United States. They were 20 feet longer than their British opponents and 3 feet wider in the beam. They also had one continuous upper deck, instead of the usual forecastle and quarterdeck joined by two gangways, which allowed the Americans to mount 20 or so carronades in addition to the 30 24pdrs in the deck below. They were fast and outclassed the British frigates.\n\nIn 1812 war broke out with USA after disputes made worse by the blockade. Despite having their coastline blocked by the British warships, the American raiders who eluded the Royal Navy net caused considerable damage to Britain's trade. By mid-1814, more than 800 British vessels had been taken, forcing the Royal Navy to escort trade convoys. Furthermore, the Americans were victorious in numerous single-ship duels with the fearsome Royal Navy.\n\nFor example in October 1812 the 44-gun United States, took on the British 38-gunner Macedonian off Madeira. Bombarding from long range, the United States pulverised the enemy ship and forced it to surrender. To add insult to British injury, the Macedonian was repaired, reflagged and fought again - this time for America. In December a duel between two frigates (American Constitution and British Java) took place off Brazil and, once again, ended in an American victory. It took two hours, but the Java was left a wreck and its captain forced to surrender.\n\nUS Navy drove all British forces off the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain. Despite this, the U.S. Navy was unable to prevent the British from blockading American ports and landing troops on American soil. After the war, the U.S. Navy again focused its attention on protecting American shipping assets, sending squadrons to the Caribbean, the Mediterranean, South America, Africa, and the Pacific.\n\n\"We ought to begin a naval power ...\"\n\nThomas Jefferson, US President\n\nThe British Army.\n\n\"... the English army was absurdly under-rated in foreign countries and\n\nabsolutely despised in its own ... the ill-success of the expeditions in\n\n1794 and 1799 appeared to justify the general prejudice. \"\n\nEngland, both at home and abroad, was in 1808 scorned as a military power ...\"\n\n(Napier - History of the War in Peninsula 1807-1814 p 21)\n\n.\n\nThe British army came into being with the merger of the Scottish Army and the English Army, following the unification of the two countries' parliaments and the creation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. Under Oliver Cromwell, the army had been active in the re-conquest, settlement and suppressing revolts in Ireland.\n\nJohn Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough's leadership of the allied armies during the Nine Years' War and the War of the Spanish Succession consolidated Britain's emergence as a front-rank power. Throughout ten consecutive campaigns during the Spanish Succession war Marlborough held together a discordant coalition through his sheer force of personality and raised the standing of British army to a level not known since the Middle Ages. Although in the end he could not compel total capitulation from his enemies, his victories allowed Britain to rise from a minor to a major power, ensuring the country's growing prosperity throughout the 18th century.\n\nThe British army and navy, in building the Empire, fought numerous wars with Netherlands, Spain, and France for supremacy in the world. The regular and colonial troops also battled many native tribes in Africa and in North America. In 1790s and early 1800s the bulk of the British field army was engaged in Europe against France.\n\nThe most successful British campaigns of the Napoleonic Wars were the Peninsular Campaign 1808-14 and Waterloo Campaign in 1815. The British troops under Wellington won several battles, including Rolica, Vimeiro, Salamanca and Vitoria. Hailed as the conquering hero by the British, Wellington was created \"Duke of Wellington\", a title still held by his descendants. Although Wellesley spent nearly six years driving the French Army from Spain and removing Joseph Bonaparte from the Spanish throne, he has received little recognition in Spain. In the Spanish-speaking world the war is known as the Guerra de la Independencia Española, or the Spanish War of Independence.\n\nAt Waterloo in 1815 the French army under Napoleon was defeated by Wellington's British, German and Netherland troops combined with a Prussian army under the command of Blücher. It was the culminating battle of the campaign and Napoleon's last.\n\nSeveral other British operations were a failure: British troops invaded Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) to suppress a slave rebellion but are forced to withdraw; Flanders in 1793-94; Holland in 1799; Buenos Aires twice; Holland in 1809; the Dardenelles in 1807; Egypt in 1806; Spain in 1808-1809 (Sir John Moore); Sweden in 1808; Naples and Hanover in 1805; and Spain and Italy in 1800. During the Peninsular War, General \"Suchet defeated two British amphibious expeditions launched from Sicily against Spain's east cost ... \" (J Elting - \"Swords Around a Throne\" p 152)\n\n1.\n\nIn 1793-1794 the British troops in Holland received \"scathing criticism from foreign military observers and Allied commanders. There were damning comments on the appalling behaviour of officers, their lack of care for their men and their generally drunken demeanour. The Army as a whole showed up badly in the field. The drill manuals were out of date, the battalions were of poor quality ...\" (Haythornthwaite - \"Wellington's Infantry (1)\" p 6)\n\nAt Tourcoing in 1794 French Generals Souham and Moreau with 70,000 men defeated British-Austrian force of 75,000 men. The French suffered 3,000 killed and wounded, while the British and Austrians lost 5,500 killed, wounded and prisoners. The Duke of York, separated from his command, narrowly avoided capture and was obliged to wade a deep brook to escape. This ended the battle.\n\n2.\n\nThen came the defeat at Buenos Aires. After a relentless 2-day fight with the Buenos Aires and Montevideo militias in August 1806, the British infantry were defeated and forced to capitulate. Beresford had to surrender, remaining prisoner for 6 months; in the end, he managed to escape and arrived in England in 1807.\n\n3.\n\nIn March 16th 1807 the Royal Navy and 5.000 redcoats under General A. Mackenzie Fraser invaded and occupied Alexandria in Egypt. The aim was to secure the port as a base for Mediterranean operations and to prevent the French from taking advantage of it. The action however not only alienated Russian allies but was also a military catastrophe, with Fraser losing two battles at Rosetta (modern Rashid) on 29 March and 21 April. The crushed battalions suffered \"almost 1.400 casualties\". It forced the British to abandon the idea of expanding the conquered territory, and they were confined only to the city. Agreement to leave Egypt was signed in September, 1807.\n\n4.\n\nIn 1809 the British corps under General Sir John Moore fled before the French to the coast. The track was littered for mile after mile with discarded equipment and knapsacks, and the forlorn dead and dying.\" (Haythorntwaite - \"Wellington's Infantry (1)\" p 36) Moore's force was defeated by Soult's corps at Corunna, General Moore was killed, and the Britsh were forced to embark and leave Europe. \"\n\n5.\n\nIn 1815 at New Orleans approx. 11,000 British troops (incl. many veterans of Napoleonic Wars) were soundly defeated by 4,500 American regulars and militia. The outcome of New Orleans is good evidence of a good army being led badly.\n\nFrench and British military activities in Europe in 1807.\n\n.\n\nStrength, organization and\n\ndeployment of the British army.\n\nFrance was not separated by water from her enemies and was forced to field massive land armies. In contrast, the British could simply disengage from the conflict on the continent, embark their troops and leave. And this is what they did so many times. For the hit-and-run strategy one doesn't need a huge field army, a small force of volunteers will do even better. The volunteers enjoyed several advantages over the recruits, with higher morale being one of them.\n\nThe British Army was not large enough to operate on its own against the French, and without strong allies, Britain had been forced to withdraw from Europe. Anyway, it played only secondary and/or supportive role and usually campaigned on the fringes of Europe (Portugal, Holland, Denmark, southern Italy). The popular uprising in Spain encouraged the British to commit substantial forces once again.\n\nThe British played an important role in Peninsula. But lets keep on mind that, for example, in 1810, of the 325,000 French forces in the Peninsula, only about 1/4 of them were involved in the actioons against Wellington - the rest [3/4] were required to contain the Spanish insurgents and regulars. The British played a major role during the Waterloo Campaign in 1815. However of Wellington's 26 infantry brigades at Waterloo only 9 were British.\n\nPicture: British Soldiers Embarking for the Napoleonic Wars. Picture by Charles Green.\n\nOne of the barriers to recruitment was the British army's fearsome reputation for loss of life. For example, the failing campaigns in Caribbean in 1790s caused thousands of redcoats to perish through disease.\n\nThe British people distrusted and disliked the armed forces, considering them to be the weapons in the hand of the King. This led to the Bill of Rights 1689, which reserves authority over a standing army to Parliament. (No standing army may be maintained during a time of peace without the consent of parliament.)\n\nIn 1790s the British army consisted of :\n\n- 88 infantry battalions (7 guard and 81 line)\n\n- 30 cavalry regiments (3+7 guard, 6 dragoons and 14 light dragoons)\n\n- 4 foot artillery battalions and 1 Invalid Battalion (all 10 companies each),\n\n- 2 artillery companies in India, 6 field and 1 invalid companies of the Royal Irish Artillery\n\n- 2 troops of the Royal Horse Artillery were in the process of organizing\n\nIn January 1805 the British field army consisted of 160,500 regulars:\n\n- 124,500 infantry\n\n- 20,000 cavalry\n\n- 16,000 artillery\n\nand engineers\n\nThese forces were deployed in many places around the world:\n\n- 70,000 stationed in England\n\n- 35,000 in Ireland\n\n- 22,500 in East Indies and Ceylon\n\n- 15,500 in West Indies and Jamaica\n\n- 6,500 on Malta\n\n- 4,500 in Gibraltar\n\n- 4,500 in Canada\n\n- 2.000 other\n\nThe threat of invasion of Great Britain was high, after the rise of Napoleon. In order to improve the country's defences, volunteer regiments were raised in many counties from yeomen.\n\nThe word \"yeoman\" refers to small farmers who owned the land they cultivated as opposed to peasants, but the officers were drawn from the nobility and many of the men were their tenants. These regiments became known collectively as the Yeomanry (ext.link). Members of the yeomanry were not obliged to serve overseas without their individual consent.\n\nIn 1808 the British army consisted of :\n\n- 170,000 infantry and 6,000 Foot Guards\n\n- 30,000 cavalry\n\n- 15,000 artillery\n\nAccording to William Napier, of these, approx. 55,000 were employed in India,\n\nthe reminder were disposable, \"because from 80 to 100,000 militia, differing from\n\nthe regular troops in nothing but the name, were sufficient for the home duties.\"\n\nPS.\n\nIn early 1800s several excellent British regiments was send to Canada and used against the Americans. In June 1812 began war between USA (population 6 millions) and Great Britain (18 millions). Napoleon said: \"If this rupture had occurred earlier it might perhaps have contributed to keep Tsar Alexander inside the Continental System !\" And in fact an American army will shortly - if not very successfully - be invading British Canada. The British extensively used the Indian tribes (Shawnees, Creeks, Delawares, Chippewa, Fox, Sauk, Miami, Ottawa, Kickapoo) led by chief Tecumseh with great effect against the American regulars and militia. The Indians knew the land and were excellent scouts. The warriors even took part in several pitched battles between the British and American troops.\n\nDuring this war British troops set fire to many public buildings in Washington (incl. the White House.) This attack was in retaliation for the American burning and looting of York (now Toronto) in 1813, and the burning down of the buildings of the Legislative Assembly there. The last battle of this war took place in 1815 near New Orleans. Approx. 4,500 American regulars and militia under Andrew Jackson defeated 11,000 British troops, including many veterans of the Napoleonic Wars. The battle boosted the reputation of Andrew Jackson and helped to propel him to the White House. \"The 8th of January\" became a traditional American fiddle tune the melody of which was used by Jimmie Driftwood to write the song \"The Battle of New Orleans\" (ext.link). It also misrepresents the British forces as being cowards.\n\n.\n\nQuality of the British army\n\nBecause the French couldn't disengage from a conflict on the continent as easily as the British, they were forced to fight one war after another, and often had no time to properly train their recruits. \"Unlike the British trooper who received a minimum of 6 months' training most French troopers received after 1805 a bare 2 to 3 weeks, being lucky if they were taught basic horsemanship and drill.\" (- P.J.C. Elliot-Wright)\n\nFrench General Foy described the British troops campaigning in Peninsula in great detail. He wrote, \"The English were looked upon by the French as sea-wolves, unskilful, perplexed, and powerless, the moment they set their foot on land. ... (However) \"The French soldiers, who had returned from Egypt, talked to their comrades of the indomitable valour of the English; moreover, it was easy to suppose that enterprise, capacity, and courage render the possessors fit for other purposes than the duties of the sea service.\n\nTheir skill and intrepidity in braving the dangers of the ocean have always been unrivalled. Their restless disposition, and fondness for travelling fit them for the wandering life of the soldier; and they possess that most valuable of all qualities in the field of battle  coolness in their strife.\"\n\n\"The glory of the British army is based principally upon its excellent discipline, and upon the cool and sturdy courage of the people. Indeed we know of no other troops as well disciplined. The principal cause of their pre-eminence in this respect, would, if applied to the French army, most likely produce an effect diametrically opposite. Varieties of character and condition, require the employment of different means to obtain the same end.\"\n\n\"The English NCOs are excellent; but their courage and their talent are not encouraged by promotion to higher grades. They are nominated by the commander of the regiment, and cannot be broke but by the sentence of a court-martial. Their authority is extensive, comprehending the minute details of inspection, of discipline, and of daily instruction - duties which, in other armies, would not be committed to them.\"\n\n\"In the British army will not be found either the strong sympathy between the leaders and the soldiers, the paternal care of the captains, the simple manners of the subalterns, nor the affectionate fellow-feeling in danger and suffering which constituted the strength of the revolutionary armies of France; but unshaken patriotism, and tried and steady bravery, are to be met with everywhere amongst them.\"\n\nThe British Baker rifle was probably the most accurate of all firearms during the Napoleonic Wars. On the training ground and under perfect conditions 100 % (!) hits were recorded at 100 paces. Furthermore, the British could afford high ratio of practice rounds per soldier in life fire training:\n\n1. British 'Rifles' - 60 rounds and 60 blanks per man\n\n2. Prussian jägers and Schützen - 60 rounds per man (in 1811-1812)\n\n3. British light infantry - 50 rounds and 60 blanks\n\n4. Prussian fusiliers (light infantry in line regiments) - 30 rounds\n\n5. British line infantry - 30 rounds\n\n6. Austrian line infantry - 10 rounds (in 1809)\n\n7. Austrian line infantry - 6 rounds (in 1805)\n\n8. Russian infantry - 6 and less rounds\n\nDue to very high ratio of volunteers, good training, talented commander, the right tactics, and good weapons, the British army of the Napoleonic Wars was one of the best armies of all times. Before the Peninsular War, however, British military operations on mainland Europe had been marked by bungling half-measures and a series of failures. The British army was not regarded as equal to some continental armies. William Napier writes, \"... the English army was absurdly under-rated in foreign countries and absolutely despised in its own ... the ill-success of the expeditions in 1794 and 1799 appeared to justify the general prejudice.\"\n\n\"England, both at home and abroad, was in 1808 scorned as a military power ...\" (Napier - History of the War in Peninsula 1807-1814 p 21)\n\n.\n\nDiscipline in the British Army.\n\n\"... an unflogged soldier was a\n\nmonstrously misplaced being ...\"\n\nFor the British soldier himself discipline was invariably harsh and enlistement was for long time. Some French deserters who joined the British Army in the Peninsula promptly deserted from it because they found discipline too severe. Some punishments included riding the wooded horse a sharp-backed frame on which the offender sat astride, sometimes with weights attached to his feet to increase discomfort.\n\nGenerally offenders were flogged on the bare back for a variety of offences, and shot or hanged for more serious ones. According to Wellington flogging was absolutely essential to control \"the scum of the earth.\" He defended the harsh discipline, arguing that the army contained a proportion of blackguards who could not be kept in line in any other way, while reformers maintained that it dishonoured both the victim and the army in which he served. Britain was not alone in this aspect. Discipline in the Prussian army (until 1806), and the punishment in the Russian army were also severe.\n\nDuring march the discipline in the British troops was strict, the soldiers were only allowed to quit the ranks if they were ill or if they needed to relieve themselves. Before doing so they had to obtain a ticket, or certificate, from the sergeant on approval of their company commander.\n\nCostello described the punishment of the popular Tom Plunket. \"He was brought to a regimental court-martial, found guilty, and sentenced to be reduced to the ranks, and to receive 300 lashes. Poor Plunket, when he had recovered his reason, after the commission of his crime, had experienced and expressed the most unfeigned contrition, so that when sentence became known, there was a general sorrow felt for him throughout the regiment, particularly on account of the corporal punishment...\n\nThe sentence was read by the adjutant in a loud voice. Poor Tom, who had the commiseration of the whole regiment, looked deadly pale... Happily this wretched scene was destined to a brief termination: at the 35th lash, the Colonel ordered punishment to cease, and the prisoner taken down.\" (- Costello, pp 12-14)\n\nAfter the Napoleonic Wars was published an article about the punishment in the British army. \"Corporal punishment does not exist in the French, the Prussian, and several of the minor armies. Even in Austria, where the greater part of the recruits consist of semi-barbarians, there is an evident desire to do away with it; thus the punishment of running the gauntlet has recently been struck out from the Austrian military code. In England, on the contrary, the cat-o'-nine-tails is maintained in its full efficiency - an instrument of torture fully equal to the Russian knout in its most palmy time.\n\nStrange to say, whenever a reform of the military code has been mooted in Parliament, the old martinets have stuck up for the cat, and nobody more zealously than old Wellington himself. To them, an unflogged soldier was a monstrously misplaced being ...\" (\"The Armies of Europe\" in Putnam's Monthly, No. XXXII, published in 1855)\n\nPicture: Lieutenant-General Sir John Moore\n\nSir John Moore discarded the then existing disciplinary system,\n\nlargely maintained through fear and brutality which, in his view,\n\nalso stifled individual initiative, and replaced it with a system\n\nbased more upon self-discipline, mutual respect and trust.\n\n.\n\nDuring the headlong retreat to Corunna in 1809, many British units' discipline cracked. Everywhere, French advance guard encountered evidence of the enemy's mounting demoralization; the roads were littered with wagons, supplies, equipment, weapons and scores of stragglers who were captured at every turn.\n\nSullen, the British treated Spain like a hostile country. Moore writes, The people run away, the villages are deserted ... Almost every village which the British infantry passed, a cavalry officer of the rearguard reported, exhibited melancholy proofs of the shameful devastation committed by the infantry which had preceded us; we observed in flames whilst we were at a considerable distance, and it was still burning when we passed through it. The inhabitants shouted Viva los Francesces ! and we overtook some stragglers who had been stripped and maltreated by the Spaniards.\n\nThe officers were quite unable to control their men. Except of the rearguard and a few of the more ordely regiments such as the Guards, the discipline no longer existed. One officer wrote: In the end Vilafranca was literally plundered, and the drunkenness that prevailed among the troops led to the most shameful incidents. Down by the river the artillery destroyed all their stores, and lighting big fires burnt all their ammunition wagons, which they broke up for the purpose. They also threw all their ammunition into the river.\n\nBembibre exhibited all the appearance of a place lately stormed and pillaged. Every door and window was broken. Wagon after wagon was abandoned and even the headquarters' supply of ready cash had to be thrown into a ravine. At Bembibre, the French dragoons rounded up hundreds of drunken British soldiers, and at Villafranca, British deserters were found to have looted their own army's depots !\n\nCaptain Gordon wrote: \"They [British stragglers] were soon overtaken by the French horse chasseurs who treated them most unmercifully, cutting to their right and left, and sparing none who came within reach of their swords.\" A few maimed and lacerated survivors made the safety of the British column, their injuries arousing howls of horror, pity, and outrage. Moore made public exhibits of them, in the hope that their shocking wounds might deter others from quitting the colours. The retreat remains a dark chapter in the history of the British army.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\"... the clumsiness of their movements.\"\n\n\"If you knew the composition of the British Army and its\n\nhabits better, then you would not talk to me about that.\"\n\nWith the exception of the Light Division the British army was considered as one of the slower armies in Europe. (In summer 1812 the Light Division started in full marching order, and arrived at the front on the day after the Battle of Talavera having covered 62 miles in 26 hours !) The British carried not only tents. During the years of 1808-1809 inexperienced officers, unaware of the hardships to come, had permitted a very large number of women to accompany the army. Their plight was one of the most tragic aspects of the whole retreat to Corunna. (Approx. 50 years before Napoleon the French army was also considered as being slow on the march. The French carried lackeys, courtesans, chaplains, and valets, chests full of perfumes and umbrellas.)\n\nJohn Mills of British Regiment of Coldstream Guards writes, \"Their (French) movements compared with ours are as mail coaches to dung carts. In all weathers and at all times the French are accustomed to march, when our men would fall sick by hundreds ...\"\n\nIn the very end of the battle of Waterloo, Wellington and Blucher decided together that the Prussians alone would continue the pursuit. This decision is usually explained by citing the exhausted condition of Wellington's infantry, but Blucher's were surely no less tired. More likely the choice reflected the plodding management and slowness of movement that characterized British troops. [Professor A. Barbero]\n\nIn the beginning of the 1815-Campaign the Prussians got 3/4 of their men to the right place at the right time, Wellington only 1/3 of his total forces. Prussian officer Müffling asked Wellington why the British advance so slowly and Wellington explained: \"Do not press me on this, for I tell you, it cannot be done. If you knew the composition of the British Army and its habits better, then you would not talk to me about that. I cannot leave my tents and supplies behind. I have to keep my men together in their camp and supply them well to keep order and discipline.\" [Peter Hofscshroer]\n\nDuring the Peninsular War the Spaniards reproached the British for the tardiness of their marches. French General Thiebault wrote that the scattered state of the French army in Spain rendered its situation desperate, and that the slowness of Sir Arthur Wellesley saved it several times.\n\nWellington once made comment on the supply issue: \"It is certainly astonishing that the enemy [French] have been able to remain in this country so long; and it is extraordinary instance of what a French army can do. ... With all our money and having in our favour the good inclinations of the country, I assure you that I could not maintain one division in the district in which they have maintained not less than 60,000 men and 20,000 animals for more than two months.\"\n\nThe French troops were known for their skills of extracting provisions locally - much to the annoyance of local population. David Gates writes, \"In contrast, the Allies, particularly the British, seem to have been peculiarly inept at surviving without plenty of supplies. Even in times of minor food shortages, indiscipline erupted on a vast scale. The British divisions went to pieces in the lean days after Talavera for example - and as late as the Waterloo campaign of 1815, we find Wellington commenting to his Prussian friends that 'I cannot separate from my tents and supplies. My troops must be well kept and well supplied in camp ...\" (Gates - \"The Spanish Ulcer\")\n\nThe Russian soldiers were the extreme opposite to the British. \"They subsist well on black bread: few cattle are seen following the army. Their commissaries have little to do; and the great burden of managing the commissariat, which is so irksome to a British commander on service, seems perfectly light to a Russian chief.\" (- British General Sir Charles Stewart)\n\n\"Clumsy, unintelligent, and helpless as the British soldier is when thrown upon his own resources, or when called upon to do the duty of light troops, nobody surpasses him in a pitched battle where he acts in masses. ... This solidity and tenacity in attack and defense, form the great redeeming quality of the British army, and have alone saved it from many a defeat, well-merited and all but intentionally prepared by the incapacity of its officers, the absurdity of its administration, and the clumsiness of its movements.\" (\"The Armies of Europe\" in Putnam's Monthly, No. XXXII, published in 1855)\n\n\"Historians will say that the British army ... carried on war\n\nin Spain and Portugal until they had eaten all the beef and\n\nmutton in the country, and then compelled to withdraw.\"\n\n(- Larpent April 1813, in Longford's \"Wellington\")\n\nPS.\n\nNot only the British were considered being slow marchers. The old-fashioned attitudes of Austrian and Russian officers also contributed to the slowness with which their armies moved. \"In the middle of the century the aristocratic officer had always maintained a lifestyle in the field that was consonant with his social position. This meant transporting large amounts of gear such as tents, and even porcelain, accompanied by the necessary servants to look after them.\n\nThe Duke of Cumberland, for example, travelled around with 145 tons of baggage. This was not looked on as showing off, but rather as necessary for a man of high position, and to do otherwise would have brought contempt rather than admiration. While everybody else did the same thing, it had little effect on the army's performance, but once the enemy started to do things differently, it had grave consequences, as an Austrian noted:\n\nAlmost every day our army loses half a march to the French. Their soldiers carry the same load as our men, but what an effort it takes us to get under way ! The French officer accompanies his troops on foot, and if necessary he carries his pack himself. In our army on the other hand, every company had a whole tail of carts just to transport the officers' baggage. If possible, these gentlemen would like to bring along warm stoves and arm-chairs as well.\n\nThe slowness with which the army moved was probably also a consequence of slow decision-making on the part of the commanders ... Bonaparte himself provides an illustration of their bewilderment with an anecdote concerning the early part of his 1796 campaign. It is taken from his memoirs, which were written in the third person:\n\nNapoleon, in his nightly rounds, encountered a bivouac of prisoners, where there was a garrulous old Hungarian officer, whom he asked how matters went on with them. The old captain could not deny that they went on very badly. 'But' he added, 'there is no understanding it at all. We have to do with a young general who is in this moment before us, then again behind us, then again on our flanks - one does not know where to place oneself. This manner of making war is insufferable and violates all usage and custom'.\n\nThis was rather like the cry of a gentleman who had gone to fight a duel in the proper ritualised fashion, and found an opponent who insisted on firing before he was told to, and his behind trees to make a more difficult target. Unfortunately, in this case there was no umpire. This no doubt paints a rather negative picture of the Austrian officer class, but the better officers should not be forgotten. ... If they had still been fighting Frederick the Great they might well have done much better,\" (Boycott-Brown - \"The Road to Rivoli\")\n\nIn 1805, one Austrian general informed Marshal Murat, Napoleon's cavalry commander, that his troops desperately needed a rest, and therefore requested him not to advance on Vienna too rapidly. :-)\n\n.\n\nThe noble men (officers) and\n\n\"the scum of the earth\" (privates).\n\nThe French were surprised by the rigid class lines\n\nthat divided the British soldiers from their officers.\n\nThe soldiers of Moore's army were described as \"They were all, however, volunteers The average age of the soldiers was 23, and their average height 5'6\". Most had been farm labourers, many from impoverished villages of Ireland and Scotland. They were paid 1 shilling per day, and led by an officer corps of aristocrats and gentlemen, many of whom had simply bought their commissions\" (Summerville - \"March of Death\" p 26)\n\nThe soldierly profession, badly paid and subject to the harshest discipline, was not greatly appreciated in England - was, in fact, a decidedly proletarian vocation. It was no accident that a high percentage of those who enlidsted were Irish since Ireland, overpopulated as it was with a deeply impoverished peasantry, had always been one of the major providers of cannon fodder to His Majesty's army. Irishmen generally made up between 20 % and 40 % of the infantry that Wellington marshaled at Waterloo.\n\nThe French were surprised by the rigid class lines that divided the soldiers from their officers and generals. Majority of the officers were all upper-class, some were sons of clerks or shopkeepers, and the soldiers, who were from the working class, obeyed them without question. (Barbero - \"The Battle\" p 22)\n\nAccording to Philip Haythorntwaite there is a record of Wellington coming upon aristocratic officers making their men carry them over a river. Wellington ordered the soldiers to drop them on the spot.\n\nDuring campaign the emotions of British soldiers were divided between the hatred and contempt officially directed at the French and Buonaparte\" by British newspapers and public opinion and the admiration they felt for the French emperor in their hearts, almost in spite of themselves. Captain Mercer of the Royal Artillery admitted that deep down he \"had often longed to see Napoleon, that mighty man of war - that astonishing genius who had filled the world with his renown.\"\n\nPS.\n\nHistorian David Chandler wrote on page 115 in Atlas of Military Strategy that the Duke described his soldiers as \"the scum of the earth\" when he recounted their looting spree after the battle of Vitoria.\n\n.\n\nThe Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany\n\nWhen he was sixteen the King sent him to Berlin\n\nto study the art of war under the famous king and\n\nmilitary leader Frederick the Great.\n\nThe Duke of York was born in London in 1763. King George III decided that his second son (and favorite child) would pursue an army career. When he was sixteen the King sent him to Berlin to study the art of war under the famous Frederick the Great. In 1795 the Duke of York took command of the British Army.\n\nAs a commander, the Duke of York presided over the unsuccessful campaign against the French troops in the Low Countries, during the conflict which followed the French Revolution. Because of the failed campaign Flanders, the Duke was destined to be pilloried for all time in the rhyme \"The Grand Old Duke of York\", which goes:\n\n\"The grand old Duke of York,\n\nHe had ten thousand men.\n\nHe marched them up to the top of the hill\n\nAnd he marched them down again.\n\nAnd when they were up, they were up.\n\nAnd when they were down, they were down.\n\nAnd when they were only halfway up,\n\nThey were neither up nor down.\"\n\nLater the Duke made amends for his military setbacks during the late 1790s by reorganising the army. Actually he was more administrator and reformer than commander in the field. For example he restored the discipline and morale in the British officer corps, manual exercises were revised, medical services were improved, he reduced the number of infantry regiments but made the battalions of uniform strength, formed depot companies etc.\n\nIn 1809 due to indiscretions by his mistress who had been corruptly selling commissions, the Duke of York was forced to resign. He was replaced with Sir David Dundas, who was old and much less effective in office than the Duke. The Duke of York was reinstated in 1811. The Duke also founded the renowned military college, Sandhurst, which promoted the professional, merit-based training of future commissioned officers.\n\n.\n\nArthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington\n\nWellington raised the reputation of the British\n\nto a level unknown since Marlborough.\n\nUntil his early 20s, Arthur showed no signs of distinction. His mother placed him in the army, saying \"What can I do with my Arthur?\" He became a nobleman playboy, carousing and gambling. In 1787 his mother and his brother Richard purchased for Arthur a commission in the 73rd Regiment if Foot. After receiving military training in Britain, he attended the Military Academy of Angers in France. (ext. link) Arthur also learned fluent French there.\n\nWellesley then campaigned in India, Netherlands, Denmark, Spain, Portugal and France. He rose to prominence eventually reaching the rank of field marshal. He raised the reputation of the British to a level unknown since Marlborough. Wellington won over French marshals at Salamanca and Vittoria. Several times however he was forced to full retreat, and some of his sieges failed.\n\nHe was the almost perfect response to the aggressive French strategy and tactics. Some Frenchmen thought Wellington was the modern Fabius the Cunctator (ext. link). The Duke earned reputation among his enemies for being a very cautious general who only fought defensive actions from positions of overwhelming advantage. This is not really correct as Wellington fought also several ofensive actions (for example Oporto, Salamanca, Vitoria).\n\nAt Salamanca in 1812 Wellington defeated Marshal Marmont. French General Foy wrote in his diary, \"This battle is the most cleverly fought, the largest in scale, the most important in results, of any that the English have won in recent times. It brings up Lord Wellington's reputation almost to the level of that of Marlborough. Up to this day we knew his prudence, his eye for choosing good positions, and the skill with which he used them. But at Salamanca he has shown himself a great and able master of manoeuvring. He kept his dispositions hidden nearly the whole day: he allowed us to develop our movement before he pronounced his own: he played a close game; he utilised the oblique order in the style of Frederick the Great.\".\n\nJac Weller, an admirer of Wellington, describes in great detail his campaigns and battles. Weller however claims that \"none of Wellington's battles in Spain can be called \"great.\"\n\nAt Salamanca he failed to exploit his success and the enemy quickly recovered. The battle of Fuentes de Onoro and especially at Talavera were near disasters. According to Jac Weller the Battle of Busaco was \"a technical defeat although claimed as victory\" and the allignement of troops at Talavera was not very well thought. Weller wrote that \"if Talavera was a victory because the French withdrew then Busaco was a defeat because the British were forced to withdraw.\" The siege of Burgos was a very costly defeat.\n\nAs strategist Wellington was one of the best. Striking north, he surpised Soult and drove him into the interior. With Portugal in revolt all around him, Soult seemed doomed, but escaped by a daring march through the mountains to Orense. Wellesley then turned on Victor and advanced up the Tagus River together with Cuesta. Victor retired to Talavera, where Joseph joined him with the French reserves. Wellesley repulsed Victor in a 2-day battle, but had to retreat hurriedly when Soult, Ney, and Mortier emerged from the mountains to his left rear.\n\nUnder Wellington the British army became one of the most successful armies of the Napoleonic Wars. It was especially efficient when fed and supplied sufficiently (to keep the discipline) and deployed on a strong defensive position. French General Foy writes, \"Well posted, as Wellington knows how to post it, and attacked from the front, I consider the English infantry to be impregnable ...\" On the importance of supplies for the British army click here.\n\nWellington was the most successful British general of the Napoleonic Wars. With one or two exceptions British commanders failed in independent command. Even General Sir John Moore lost his campaign. He was driven into the sea by the French, then killed at Corunna, and his troops fled to Britain. As a general Wellington is often compared to the Marlborough, with whom he shared many characteristics, chiefly a transition to politics after a highly successful military career. He served as the Tory Prime Minister on two separate occasions, and was one of the leading figures in the House of Lords until his retirement in 1846.\n\nAccording to Andrew Roberts \"Wellington was perhaps one of the worst prime ministers in the Great Britain.\" His opposition to reform caused his popularity to plummet to such an extent that crowds gathered to throw missiles at his London home. On Waterloo Day he survived an attempt to drag him from his horse, a hail of stones in Holborn, and tried to take shelter at Lincoln's Inn, only to be chased by the mob when he emerged again.\n\nThere was time when the Duke feared for his life. The ground floor windows of his Apsley House were protected by iron shutters, and, when travelling, he carried loaded firearms in his carriage. \"The iron shutters may have originally given rise to the sobriquet 'the Iron Duke.\" (Christopher Hibbert - \"Wellington\")\n\nIn September 1852, the Great Man was seized with an epileptic fit, became speechless, and died."
