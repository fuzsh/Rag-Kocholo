        "text": "How happy I feel, when surrounded By so many preparations Against England, My respected friend doctor franklin will easily conceiveâ There is nothing to be found in france which might offer to me so delightfull a prospect, as those ships, troops, warlike stores of all Kinds which are Getting Ready for to visit our good neighboursâEvery thing will be soon provided for and we shall be able within these few days to set of at a momentâs warningâso that our expedition will go on very well on the part of the Army, and we entirely depend on Mr dâorvilliers and his naval circumstances.\n\nThe Army is about thirty thousand strong, all in good spirits and will, I am sure, behave in the most Glorious mannerâBesides this number we have a Van guard of light infantery and Grenadiers under a reputed General Officerâ1 Heavy pieces of artillery are embarkâd with usâthere is a Great proportion of engeneers. The more we shall be masters of the Channel the More I think will be undertakenâ What I believe to be Certain, is that the Ministry are in Earnest, and I want if possible to give the ennemy some stroke or other before the end of the Campaignâ on the other hand I hear that the British fleet is getting strong, and our future motions must as yet be very uncertain.\n\nBut if Gibraltar is Besieged, if jamaÃ¯ca was attakâd, doânt you believe, my dear doctor, that some thing must succeed, or that at least the ennemy must run the greatest dangers and support an enormous expense.\n\nTheyr succes in Virginia2 tho not very important I Cant however help lamentingâ Suppose as it is reported fort pitt was taken and Mk intoch drove off,3 that state would be caught at once by the sea side and the back country, which Might good deal distress the trade by theyr cruizing off and destroying in the harbour, and distres the people by those enraged Bands of indiansâ The Ennemy will Carry on that low pillaging Kind of war, but I donât Believe them in situation of Carrying on a serious and Military Campaignâ Any intelligence you may have from that beloved Country, and from my dearest friend gal washington I beg you would Communicate to me. Pray, My dear sir, let me know if you have any good opportunity of writing to Americaâ how was the paper when Your last news have been dispatchâd to you? For I understand you have Receivâd some letters.\n\nI wish Spain would declare independency, and send of a frigatte to Bostonâ that will have A good effect, and I think some intelligences of that kind will be very welcome and very timely in the present instanceâ\n\nFor my part, my dear doctor, however pleasâd I May be with this expedition, my warmest desire is to serve again with My fellow soldiers of the American Armyâ Whenever my Country and yours will Believe that My going there is more useful than my staying here, I shall immediately set of with the sincerest and highest pleasure.\n\nLet me know, my dear doctor, how far is our little Book advancâd.4 I like the idea extremely well, and want it to be soon Brought to the light.\n\nFarewell, My dear friend, I hope I will ever possess a large part in your friendship, and that I deserve indeed by the affection, By all the tender sentiments and high Regard I have the honer to be with dear sir Yours"
