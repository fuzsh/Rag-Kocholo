        "text": "This is the chronicle of a young 18th-century German musician shipped to America as a musketeer in the Anspach-Bayreuth military forces sent to aid Britain in her effort to quell the rebellion of the \"Thirteen Colonies.\" With the initial focus on the 1st Anspach Regiment, it follows the movements of the Margrave's troops at their departure from Ansbach in March of 1777 through the conflict until their capture at Yorktown in 1781...it continues through their dreadful incarceration for virtually two years. Yet, just following their long awaited release and prior to their embarkation for return to the Fatherland in 1783, the captivating story of the young soldier unfurls as he embraces the \"new experiment,\" remains in Philadelphia, assimilates into the local population, becomes one of the earliest professional musicians of the early Federal period and, ultimately, meets his untimely demise in the capital city's horrific Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1793.\n\nThis thesis investigates British amphibious operations in the American War of Independence between the outbreak of war in 1775 and the Peace of Versailles in 1783. It assesses the strategic, operational and tactical context of the efforts of Great Britain to impose a settlement on the rebellious colonists by use of expeditionary warfare techniques. Particular attention is given to command decision making, both local and national, with reference to the North American theatre of war. The response of the military and government to the entry into the war of France and Spain is investigated. Fighting techniques and operational art are also evaluated. The findings are compared with secondary writing to determine whether traditional narratives adequately explain the failure of the ‘British Way of War’ in this insurgency conflict.\n\nThis article forms part of my larger effort to write about my family’s history. Consider Tiffany was a scion of the early Tiffany settlers in the colonies of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. Tiffany’s particular fame lies in his manuscript, “The American Colonies and the Revolution [c. 1600-1795],” a history of the American colonies from their founding through the Revolution from a Tory’s point-of-view. He divided his manuscript into nine books. Here, I have transcribed and annotated Book VI which covers the Revolution from 1780 to 1783. Book VI includes new information on the capture and execution of Nathan Hale."
