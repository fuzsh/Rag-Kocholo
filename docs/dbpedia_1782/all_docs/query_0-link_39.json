        "text": "Citation preview\n\nPLACE NAMES OF ATLANTIC CANADA\n\nWindows on the history and culture of the region, the toponyms of Atlantic Canada have attracted attention and interest for centuries. Almost a millennium has passed since the Norse first landed in Vinland, but even earlier the Amerindian and Inuit people bestowed their own place names on Atlantic Canada. Many of these have survived not only the centuries and a variety of translations but also several attempts at cultural assimilation. There followed names from Basque, Portuguese, French, British, and other sources. Information about the evolution of place names is never static; new archaeological, historical, and linguistic sources are always being discovered. In Place Names of Atlantic Canada, William B. Hamilton provides a wide-ranging overview of the origin and meaning of hundreds of regional place names to reveal the colourful history of the area. Some element of selectivity was needed in the compilation of the book; there are currently 62,880 officially approved Atlantic Canadian place names recorded by the Canadian Permanent Committee on Geographical Names. In Newfoundland alone more than 200 distinct features incorporate the word 'Green.' Hamilton concentrates on three broad categories; size - the major centres of population and most important physical features; history - those locations that have had an impact on the evolution of the Atlantic region; and human interest - those place names most likely to provoke the question 'Where did they get that name?' Based on archival research supplemented by field studies, Place Names of Atlantic Canada is the first volume to approach this topic from a regional perspective. Hundreds of cross references lead the reader to related information in all four provinces. The book also breaks new ground in tracing the evolution of names of important undersea features on the Grand Banks and off the Nova Scotia coastline. An ideal reference book with more than 2,000 entries arranged alphabetically by province and aided by five maps, Place Names of Atlantic Canada will appeal to anyone interested in place naming in general and in the culture and social history of Atlantic Canada. WILLIAM B. HAMILTON is professor emeritus in the Faculty of Social Sciences at Mount Allison University. A former chair of the Toponymic Research Committee of the Canadian Permanent Committee on Geographical Names, he has written extensively on place names. His books include Local History in Atlantic Canada and The Macmillan Book of Canadian Place Names.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nWILLIAM B.

He kept a detailed journal of his travels, which remains, after the passage of two centuries, a vivid portrayal of local life and lore. In an age when most ranks 'below decks' were illiterate, Thomas displayed evidence of a good education, and a keen eye for the off-beat incident and for what he described as the 'whimsical.' High on the list of the latter were place names. This interest led him to search out unusual examples and to speculate on their meaning and origin. Thus, in a very real sense, the Newfoundland Journal of Aaron Thomas was the first in a long line of books to touch on the toponymy of the region. Since Thomas, numerous others have mined the place-name lode of Atlantic Canada. Individuals such as Howley and Seary, in Newfoundland; Brown and Fergusson, in Nova Scotia; Ganong and Rayburn, in New Brunswick; and Douglas and Rayburn (again), in Prince Edward Island, are among those who have made noteworthy contributions to the understanding of regional place names. However, each generation, while benefiting from what has gone before, must recognize that information concerning the evolution of place names is ever changing. New archaeological, historical, and linguistic discoveries are constantly being made, and previously lost documents, maps, and records being uncovered; revised interpretations inevitably result. Perhaps the most significant example may be the recent research relating to the sixteenthcentury Basque presence in Atlantic Canada. Thanks to the work of Selma de Lothbiniere Barkham, we are now able to pinpoint with some accuracy the not inconsiderable Basque contribution to the toponymy of Atlantic Canada.\n\nviii Preface It is inevitable that the process of compiling any work of this kind must be brutally selective. To put the matter in context, it is worth recording that, at the time of writing, there were 62,880 officially approved Atlantic Canadian place names on the computer list maintained by the Canadian Permanent Committee on Geographical Names (CPCGN). The vast majority of these names are descriptive in nature, and many are repetitious. To illustrate: in Newfoundland and Labrador there are more than 200 distinct features that incorporate 'Green,' including 20 with the name Green Cove. Nova Scotia is not far behind. It boasts some 130 variants of 'Green,' numbered among them 25 locations known as 'Green Island/ With this aspect of place names in mind, three broad categories were used as selection criteria in determining whether an entry would be included, (i) Size: The major centres of population and the most important physical features - rivers, mountains, lakes, and so on - qualified. (2) History: Those places that have had some significant bearing on the historical evolution of Atlantic Canada also appear, for example, Cape Degrat, Newfoundland; Port Royal, Nova Scotia; Maugerville, New Brunswick; and Abells Cape, Prince Edward Island. (3) Human Interest: This category includes place names that are most likely to provoke the question: What is the origin or meaning or significance of that name? Naked Man Hill, Newfoundland; Musquodoboit Harbour, Nova Scotia; Barony, New Brunswick; and Duvar, Prince Edward Island, are examples. In some cases the human interest may stem from the name itself; in others it may be based on the life of a famous person or event associated with the location. Whatever the focus, there has been no shortage of such entries in all four provinces. Throughout Place Names of Atlantic Canada, the spelling adopted in the most recent of the provincial gazetteers issued by the CPCGN has been followed. A few of the place names included are found locally but not sanctioned by the CPCGN or the provincial naming authorities. In these instances, the accepted community spelling has been used. The reader is forewarned that the spelling of some place names in this book may conflict with that used in other sources. Some examples: In Newfoundland, 'Meelpaeg Lake' and not 'Moelpoeg Lake' is the authorized spelling; Torbay' denotes the community, although 'Tor Bay' is still officially prescribed for the bay. In Nova Scotia, 'Caribou/ rather than 'Cariboo,' is the accepted version for the ferry terminal near Pictou. One important exception is found in chapter 2. The reasons, historical and otherwise, for using the form 'St. John River' instead of 'Saint John River' are indicated in the entry for the former. Generally, New Brunswick French/\n\nPreface\n\nix\n\nAcadian place names include the hyphen, as in 'Saint-Franc.ois-deKent/ while Newfoundland place names normally do not, as in 'Isle aux Morts.' However, there are some exceptions in Labrador, where 'L'Anse-au-Diable' and 'L'Anse-au-Loup' may be found. Both forms are also used in Nova Scotia; thus, the hyphen is included in Tetit-de-Grat' but not in 'Ste. Anne du Ruisseau/ It should be noted that there are only two recognized dual bilingual place names in Atlantic Canada - Grand Falls/Grand Sault and Caissie Cape/Cap de Caissie, both in New Brunswick. The period after 'St.' and 'Ste/ appears in all officially approved Canadian place names and is used throughout this text. The apostrophe has fared less well; although still commonly retained in Newfoundland, it is authorized in only a few place names elsewhere in the region. Examples in Nova Scotia include St. Mary's Municipality, St. Peter's, and Clark's Harbour. Throughout the text, small caps are used to indicate that additional information will be found in entries for these toponyms. The maps are intended to assist readers, especially those unfamiliar with the region. The county or regional divisions are noted here; precise locations can then be found in a provincial atlas. Maps of the three Maritime provinces show their respective county divisions. In Newfoundland and Labrador, where there are no county divisions, the five regional sectors used by the provincial government - Avalon, Eastern, Central, Western, and Labrador - are shown. Another map shows the major fishing banks off the Atlantic Canadian coastline. For those who live near the sea, locations such as Banquereau Bank and Georges Bank are as important as their inland counterparts. Numbered among the former are some of the oldest toponyms within the region. Place Names of Atlantic Canada approaches toponymy from the historical, cultural, and regional perspective. It reveals that, through the evolution of place names, important links of commonality may be found within Atlantic Canada. Chapter i, 'Windows on History and Culture,' sets the stage for what follows by pointing to some of these connections, and by summarizing the many insights revealed by toponymy. It also provides an opportunity to discuss place names found in more than one part of the region. For the sake of convenience, entries are arranged alphabetically by province; however, frequent cross-references will lead the reader to additional interprovincial associations. Readers with an appetite for more historical detail are directed to the appropriate sections of the Bibliographical Essay. My gratitude to those who have previously written on the subject and\n\nx\n\nPreface\n\nrelated themes is expressed in the Bibliographical Essay. Further, I am indebted to Jacynth Hope-Simpson, Sherborne, Dorset, literary executor of the Sir John Hope Simpson papers, for permission to use the quotations on pages 231, 263, and 268. (A selection of the Hope Simpson correspondence, edited by Peter Neary, was published in 1996 by the University of Toronto Press under the title White Tie and Decorations.) Appreciation is also extended to Thorn Peppard for his assistance in drafting the maps. I have relied heavily on primary source material, and a special note of appreciation must go to the personnel at the National Archives of Canada, the National Map Library, and the Canadian Permanent Committee on Geographical Names, all in Ottawa; the four provincial archives, in Fredericton, Halifax, Charlottetown, and St. John's; Mount Allison University Archives; Acadia University Archives; the Maritime Conference Archives, United Church of Canada; Parks Canada; the New Brunswick Museum, Saint John; the Prince Edward Island Museum and Heritage Foundation; the Institute of Island Studies, at the University of Prince Edward Island; and the Centre for Newfoundland Studies, at Memorial University. In addition many librarians and museum personnel in all corners of Atlantic Canada were helpful in responding to specific enquiries. One side-benefit of my research was the necessity to travel extensively throughout the region. During these field trips many people contributed insight and information. Throughout this entire enterprise, Gerald Hallowell, University of Toronto Press, has been both supportive and helpful, offering editorial advice and assistance. A full measure of gratitude must be extended to my copy-editor, Beverley Beetham Endersby, who fulfilled the arduous task of reviewing and editing a complex text with thoroughness and sensitivity. As time goes on, new information on the place names of Atlantic Canada will inevitably surface. I would be pleased to hear from readers with comments to share. These may be forwarded to me in care of the publisher. It is appropriate that this preface is being written on Queen Victoria's birthday. A search of the record reveals that no other monarch is more firmly etched on the place-name canvas, not only of Atlantic Canada, but of her 'other realms and territories' around the world. 24 May 1996\n\nPLACE NAMES OF ATLANTIC CANADA\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n1\n\nWindows on History and Culture\n\nThe Far Horizon, 1000-1700 To examine the place names of Atlantic Canada is to recognize that they encompass, in the broadest of outlines, a history of the region. It is also to conclude that they shed valuable light on the cultural evolution of the people who, during the far, middle, and nearer horizons of history, wrested a living from a sometimes inhospitable landscape. As windows reflect the passing scene, so, too, do the place names assigned by those who once inhabited these shores. The first place names on the far horizon were bestowed by the original inhabitants, the Amerindian and Inuit peoples. It is a testimonial to the innate knowledge of geography of Canada's aboriginal peoples that many of these names have survived, not only time and a variety of translations, but also more than one attempt at cultural assimilation. Even the comparative absence of such place names, as on the island of Newfoundland, is a telling commentary on one of the most tragic chapters in our past: the extinction of the Beothuk people. While variants of many Mi'kmaq/Maliseet names are still in use, it is important to recognize that others have become lost. The Mi'kmaq name for the region today described as the Maritime provinces was Megamaage or Megamage, translated by the Reverend Silas T. Rand (1804-1889) as 'land of the Mi'kmaq.' It is possible that Megamage is the 'ancestor' of MIRAMICHI, and, if so, the latter may well be one of the oldest place names in Atlantic Canada. The Mi'kmaq territory was divided into seven distinct districts, each with a chief and its own local government. The chiefs met annually with other representatives in a form of a 'Grand Council' to discuss matters of mutual interest. Rand, who served among them as a\n\n4\n\nPlace Names of Atlantic Canada\n\nmissionary, may be credited with virtually saving the language. Besides translating much of the Bible into Mi'kmaq, he compiled both a grammar and a dictionary of the language, as well as writing extensively on many aspects of the culture.1 History has not recorded the name of the first European to visit Atlantic Canadian shores. Could it have been the sixth-century Irish monk St. Brendan; or perhaps the legendary Prince Henry Sinclair, who reputedly sailed from the Orkney Islands to reach what is present-day Nova Scotia in 1398? More familiar are the legends and the supporting archaeological evidence that the Norse not only explored the eastern seaboard, but established a settlement on the northern tip of Newfoundland, at L'ANSE AUX MEADOWS. Discovered by the Norwegian explorer Helge Ingstad and his archaeologist wife, Anne Stine, in 1960-1, this location has been designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. For Atlantic Canada, it provides irrefutable evidence that the Norse settled on the coast of Newfoundland nearly five hundred years before Columbus. Down the centuries there has always been conjecture concerning the original sites of Helluland, Markland, and Vinland, all mentioned as landfalls in the Norse sagas. For obvious reasons, their exact locations will probably never be known, although the weight of evidence would suggest that Helluland, the land of stone slabs, was contemporary Baffin Island; Markland, the wooded land, the coast of Labrador; and Vinland, their name for Newfoundland. A review of the literature concerning possible Norse sites is of little help in the quest for their specific locations. A classic example of the problems surrounding original Norse sources is found in the story of the Vinland Map, discovered in 1957 and the subject of a book published by Yale University in 1965. If genuine, it would have filled many gaps in Canadian cartography.2 Over time, Vinland has been attached to portions of the North American coastline ranging all the way from Newfoundland to Florida. The most reasonable explanation is provided by Ingstad, who theorizes that Vinland was probably a more northerly site than previously thought, and that it referred to present-day Newfoundland. There was an inclination among the Norse to select attractive names for new locations, for example, Green land. It is Ingstad's conclusion that Vinland falls into this category. He also points out that 'nowhere in the sagas or in other Icelandic sources is it said that the name Vinland has any connection with grapes ... the Norse voyageurs probably made wine from wild berries, of which there abound many kinds along the [Newfoundland] coast.' Ingstad also quotes the opinion\n\nWindows on History and Culture\n\n5\n\nof Swedish philologist Sven Soderberg to the effect that the vin in Vinland does not refer to grapes but is the old Norse word for 'grazing land' or 'meadow/ as it exists in Norway today in names such as Vinas and Vinje.3 Despite a lack of specificity as to location, and the fact that the names Helluland, Markland, and Vinland have vanished, they lurk in the background of European nomenclature in Atlantic Canada. What, then, is the oldest surviving place name of European origin in Atlantic Canada? In seeking an answer it is necessary to move to a study of early maps and the documentary evidence provided by the first explorers. Yet, once again, a note of caution must be struck, as the ongoing scholarly dispute concerning the exact 1497 landfall of John Cabot verifies. Predictably the anniversaries of Cabot's voyage have given rise to reruns of the debate, as Cape Breton, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland advance rival claims. Such was the case nearly a century ago, in 1897, and a renewal of the controversy may be anticipated in 1997-4 As a prelude to the disputes that were to follow, the Newfoundland government was successful in 1886, with the concurrence of the governor general of Canada, the Marquess of Lansdowne, to have the strait separating Newfoundland and Cape Breton styled on the Admiralty charts as Cabot Strait. The name was subsequently approved by the Geographic Board of Canada. It achieved general acceptance and remains in use. Later, to mark the four-hundredth anniversary of Cabot's arrival in 1897, Newfoundland issued a set of postage stamps with the dual purpose of commemorating both this event and the concurrent Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria.5 In the 19305 and 19405, the government of Nova Scotia managed to alienate Newfoundlanders by erecting a monument near CAPE NORTH, on Cape Breton Island, to mark Cabot's landfall, designating the magnificent 3OO-kilometre highway that circles the northern portion of the island as the Cabot Trail and establishing Cabot Landing Provincial Park. Not to be outdone, the government of Prince Edward Island named a tract of land, fronting on MALPEQUE BAY, Cabot Provincial Park. Controversy and legislative decrees aside, it is apparent that the claim put forward by Newfoundland is historically much stronger than those of its rivals. Following exhaustive documentary and cartographic research, and an aerial and sea reconnaissance of the Atlantic Canadian coastline, American naval historian Samuel Eliot Morison (1887-1976) concluded that Cabot's landfall was at CAPE DEGRAT, on the northern peninsula of Newfoundland.6 Regrettably, although Cabot made both a globe and a map depicting\n\n6 Place Names of Atlantic Canada his discoveries, neither has survived. As William Francis Ganong (18641941), perhaps the leading authority on Atlantic Canadian nomenclature, once observed: 'How wonderfully would the not impossible discovery of a Cabot map illuminate these matters!'7 Meanwhile, Morison's careful research of all extant evidence, plus his reasoned rebuttal of competing theories, lends credence to the Cape Degrat landfall. Morison bases his case, in part, on information contained in an important letter by John Day, a West Country entrepreneur and wine importer who resided in Seville. Discovered in the Spanish archives at Simancas, in 1956, the letter was undoubtedly written by Day to Christopher Columbus.8 The importance of the Day letter, in Morison's view, lies in its navigational data. He uses this information, along with an unrivalled knowledge of the sea and fifteenth-century seamanship, to buttress the argument in favour of a Newfoundland landfall. If Morison's thesis is accepted, then the entry dated 10 August 1497, in the Privy Purse expenses of King Henry VII - 'to hym [Cabot] that founde the new isle £10' - and the 30 September 1502 item in the Daybook of King's Payments - 'to the merchauntes of bristolle that have bene in the newe founde launde £2o'9 - achieve great significance. Both references lend proof that the Newe founde lande, and its later linguistic variations Terra Nova (Portuguese), Tierra Nueva (Spanish), and Terre Neuve (French), is the oldest existing place name of European origin in Atlantic Canada. In the evolution of regional place names, three of the earliest, Labrador, Acadia, and Cape Breton, make an appearance on the far horizon. Most authorities credit the origin of the name Labrador to Joao Fernandes, a Portuguese explorer and llavrador, 'land holder/ from the Azores. At first, the name Labrador was applied to what was then thought to be a continuous mainland from Greenland to Newfoundland. Later, when it became clear that Greenland was separated from the North American coast by Baffin Bay and Davis Strait, the name Labrador 'shifted' to indicate the neighbouring mainland coast. Historians acknowledge one Jean Alphonse de Saintonge, whose actual name was Jean Fonteneau, as the discoverer of (or first to document), in the mid-sixteenth century, 'that part of the Atlantic between Labrador and Greenland, and as the first to recognize that [the twol were not continuous.'10 A further transfer of the name Labrador has been noted. Writing in 1829, the Nova Scotia historian and author Thomas Chandler Haliburton pointed to a connection between this place name and BRAS D'OR LAKE in Cape Breton. The Lazaro Luis map of 1563, which reflected the\n\nWindows on History and Culture 7 voyages of Joao Alvares Fagundes in the 15205, 'applied the name La Terra doo Laurador to Cape Breton Island and mainland Nova Scotia. The name reappeared in 1672 in the form Lac de Labrador, given to the great salt water lake of Cape Breton ... which survives as the present Bras d'Or lake/11 Earlier, Nicolas Denys used the same name when describing the neighbourhood of his fort at ST. PETER'S, on Cape Breton Island: That which is called Labrador is a stretch of the sea, cutting in half the island of Cape Breton, with the exception of eight hundred paces or thereabouts of land which remain between the Fort of Saint Pierre and the extremity of this Sea of Labrador.'12 As is often the case in Atlantic Canadian nomenclature, the appearance this far to the south of the name Labrador may, in all probability, be credited to mapping errors. Happily, the mistake resulted in the euphonious place name BRAS D'OR LAKE. Another early regional shift name, Archadia or Arcadia (later 1'Acadie or Acadia), was first applied in 1524, by Giovanni da Verrazzano, to the present-day U.S. mid-Atlantic coastline. According to the Dictionary of Canadian Biography, Verrazzano was the first European to sail the coast of North America from Florida to Newfoundland. Alan Rayburn has cited the source of Verrazzano's 'name [as] a popular book of the time by Jacopo Sannazzaro, entitled Arcadia.'^ The name itself refers to the mountainous region of ancient Greece, traditionally presented in literature as a haven of pastoral peace and contentment. Over the years a second theory has emerged, suggesting that Acadia may be traced to the suffix cadie common in Mi'kmaq place names. The Mi'kmaq word quoddy or cady meant 'a piece of land or territory.' In the final analysis, there seems little evidence to substantiate this explanation, and the similiarity of cadie to Acadia is probably coincidental. Several maps, beginning with that of Gastaldi (1548), use the name Larcadia and, by 1585, the name had moved northward and was being used as a designation for today's peninsular Nova Scotia. As time went on, the French version, 1'Acadie, prevailed to eventually become Acadia, the name of the easternmost French colony in the New World. A few kilometres northeast of the French fortress at Louisbourg lies CAPE BRETON, the most easterly point on the island of the same name. Low lying and exposed to the full force of the north Atlantic, this landmark was long known to fishermen from western Europe. The first hint of the name is found on an anonymous Portuguese map of 1516-20. The entrance to the Gulf of St. Lawrence was also indicated on this map, and opposite was placed the inscription 'the land which was discovered by\n\n8 Place Names of Atlantic Canada the Bretons/ C. Dos Bretoes appears for the first time as a place name on the Miller map of approximately 1521. By the end of the sixteenth century, there was cartographic agreement that Cape Breton was the name not only for the cape, but also for the island. On the far horizon, names of western European origin start to appear by the end of the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Soon the bold promontories and dangerous shoals, and the safe harbours, bays, and inlets, became known and named, as was necessary in order to stake out territorial claims and to create landmarks for the developing fishery. Numbered among these early 'name makers' were the Portuguese, Spanish, Basque, West Country English, and French. Among the last, the Normans and Bretons were especially prominent. Many of the first maps of the north Atlantic were the result of Portuguese cartography, giving clear indication of a Portuguese presence on the northeastern seaboard. Names such as CAPE SPEAR, the most easterly point on the continent, CAPE RACE, and CAPE FOGO are illustrative of this influence.14 The Spanish impact on local place names was less pronounced. Two probable examples in Newfoundland are SPANIARD'S BAY and SPANISH ROOM. PLACENTIA and CARBONEAR have also been cited by some authorities as of possible Spanish origin; however, both may stem from other sources. It is apparent that the contribution of the Portuguese and Spanish, while initially important, fades with the decline of their colonial ambitions in the north Atlantic. Since it was the lot of France and England to settle the ultimate fate of the northeastern section of the continent, their imprint on place names was inevitably greater. However, such was the inaccuracy of early maps that it would be rash to equate some of these early names with exact locations. Until comparatively recent times cartography was an inexact science. Thus, for nearly the whole of the sixteenth century, it was thought that Newfoundland was an archipelago! Of special significance is the fact that Jacques Cartier, on his 1534 voyage, already knew the names for several prominent features on the Newfoundland and Labrador coast. Also, on this first voyage, while exploring the STRAIT OF BELLE ISLE, near Bonne Esperance in contemporary Quebec, he encountered 'a large ship from La Rochelle that in the night had run past the harbour where she intended to go and fish ... we went onboard with our longboats and brought her into another harbour one league further west/15 What is particularly noteworthy about this account is that Cartier did not regard such a chance meeting as anything unusual. Obviously, many sixteenth-century visi-\n\nWindows on History and Culture 9 tors had a vested interest in both transatlantic travel and remaining anonymous. Archaeological research has revealed a strong Basque presence on the south coast of Labrador. The location known to the English as RED BAY to the French as Havre des Buttes, and to the Basques as el puerto de Buytres had a thriving Basque whaling station by the 15405.l6 Despite this early beginning, an understanding of the extent and importance of the Basque fishery is a recent historiographical development. Thanks to studies conducted by linguists, historians, and archaeologists, there is now a more complete picture of this early chapter in the history of eastern Canada. Labrador, Newfoundland, and Nova Scotia bear traces of Basque place names. Thus, Samedet on the Labrador coast evolved into EAST and WEST ST. MODESTE. Cape Degrat, PORT AU PORT, and INGORNACHOIX BAY on Newfoundland are of Basque origin, as are PETIT-DE-GRAT ASPY BAY, and SCATERIE ISLAND in Nova Scotia. In addition, Baccalieu, derived from the Basque bakailua, for 'codfish/ was sometimes used as a designation for Newfoundland itself.17 It still survives in BACCALIEU ISLAND, off the east coast of Newfoundland, and in BACCARO, Nova Scotia. It was the contention of economic historian Harold Innis (18941952) 'that the French arrived on the [north Atlantic! fishing grounds at about the same time as the Portuguese ... possibly as early as 15O4/18 Thus, longevity and the three strategic voyages of Jacques Cartier helped embed an early French imprint on Atlantic Canadian place names. During his first voyage in 1534, Cartier explored the eastern coastline of Newfoundland and Labrador from the Cap de Bonne Vista (BONAVISTA) to the Bale des Chateaux (CHATEAU BAY). From there he reconnoitred the present-day Gulf of St. Lawrence, assigning names as he went along. The river was discovered on 10 August 1535, St. Lawrence Day, and the name was eventually to be applied to both the gulf and the river. Although many of Carder's place names have disappeared, those that survive underscore the importance of the French presence. Contemporary place names in this category include CAPE ROUGE, GRAND QUIRPON, and Chateau Bay (Newfoundland and Labrador); lie Brion and Cap St. Pierre (Magdalen Islands); and BAIE DES CHALEURS (New Brunswick). Another prominent coastal name, of probable French origin, but not associated with Cartier, is the Bay of Fundy. Undoubtedly the bay was visited by western European fishermen from the early 15005 onward. The name was formerly thought to be of Portuguese origin, from fondo,\n\n10 Place Names of Atlantic Canada meaning 'deep/ However, Fundy is more likely an English corruption of the French fendu, applied first by the French to the modern Cape Split at the tip of the Blomidon peninsula. For a time during the early seventeenth century, the location was known as La Baye Franqaise. In 1604 Lescarbot noted upon leaving Port Mouton, on the south shore of Nova Scotia, 'we ... weighed anchor in order to explore the interior of a bay some forty leagues in length and fourteen, or at most, eighteen in breadth, which was called French Bay/19 Following the capture of Port Royal in 1614 by the English, under Sir Samuel Argall, it was known briefly as Argall's Bay. However, this name did not achieve wide currency and soon disappeared. Throughout the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, various spellings appear: Baye Foundy (Thornton map 1688) and Fundi Bay (Moll 1720). By the middle of the eighteenth century, the contemporary spelling, 'Bay of Fundy/ was in common usage. The earliest place names of English origin in Atlantic Canada, with the exception of the 1497 naming of Newfoundland, were all translations of earlier designations by the Portuguese and French. It is the opinion of Dr. E.R. Seary that 'the first original English name, unique in a nomenclature otherwise seemingly Portuguese, is Bay of Bulls' (now known as BAY BULLS).20 This place name dates from the Hood manuscript map of 1598. Only after 1610 and the establishment of the colony at CUPIDS did English place names such as the AVALON PENINSULA, CALVERT, and BRISTOL'S HOPE begin to dot the map of Newfoundland. In other parts of Atlantic Canada, it was not until after the watershed Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 that the assignment of English toponyms becomes commonplace. One place name on the far horizon marks Scotland's first venture in colonization. It began on 29 September 1621, when Sir William Alexander (1570-1640) received a grant of 'the lands lying between New England and Newfoundland ... to be known as New Scotland or Nova Scotia/ Three years later, in 1624, the Knights Baronet of Nova Scotia were created, largely as a scheme to raise money for the proposed colony. The prospective baronets, on paying for their title, were spared the inconvenience and expense of crossing the Atlantic to claim their lands; a portion of the Edinburgh Castle esplanade was officially designated 'Nova Scotia/ Standing on this plot of ground, which is marked today by a nearby plaque, the baronets were enabled to take their oaths. Alexander issued a prospectus extolling the virtues of New Scotland and included a map of the new colony, liberally sprinkled with Scottish\n\nWindows on History and Culture 11 place names. Present-day Nova Scotia was to be the province of Caledonia; contemporary New Brunswick and the Gaspe Peninsula, the province of Alexandria. The ST. CROIX RIVER was renamed the Tweed, and the ST. JOHN RIVER was to be the Clyde. With the exception of Nov Scotia, to be revived following the Treaty of Utrecht, all of Alehxander place names have disappeared. By 1632 the territory was ceded back to France, and the Scottish colonial dream was over. Today, the coats of arms of the Knights Baronet decorate the walls of the Nova Scotia Commemorative Room in Menstrie Castle, birthplace and ancestral seat of Sir William. The name Nova Scotia, and the armorial bearings granted by King Charles I in 1626, forming the basis for the distinctive Nova Scotian flag and coat of arms, are the only permanent legacies of this early effort at Scottish colonization. (See the entries for PORT ROYAL and BALEINE in chapter 4.) The far horizon is also marked by the appearance of a number of early names that are 'held in common' by more than one part of Atlantic Canada. The most ancient is Atlantic, for the ocean that touches the shoreline of the region. The word may be traced to the sixth century B.C., to the Greek historian Herodotus, who wrote of a sea called 'Atlantis' that reputedly lay beyond the Pillars of Hercules, now the Strait of Gibraltar. A number of other early Atlantic Canadian names delineate sea features rather than land locations. The famous north Atlantic fishing banks extend in a rough line from Newfoundland to the waters off Nantucket Island and Cape Cod, Massachusetts. One of the oldest and the most important is the Grand Bank, to the southeast of Newfoundland. This vast continental shelf is equal in area to that of France and has been at the centre of international controversy down to the present day. There can be no question but that 'anonymous' western European fishermen had discovered these rich fishing grounds before Cabot's first voyage in 1497. However, it was Cabot who reported fish so plentiful that they could be scooped out of the water in baskets. Knowledge quickly spread of what was, until recent times, the world's largest and most productive fishing grounds. Because of the passage of time and lack of documentation, it is virtually impossible to pinpoint the origin of this descriptive name. It appears in various translations on sixteenth-century maps and was well established by the 15805. This is confirmed in the writings of, among others, the English geographer Richard Hakluyt. Marc Lescarbot recorded in his Histoire de la Nouvelle France the pleasure of the Poutrincourt expedition upon reaching le grand bane aux morues on 22 June 1606. He provided the following description:\n\n12 Place Names of Atlantic Canada The Grand Bank is a chain of mountains seated in the deepest ocean, and lifting their tops to within thirty, thirty-six or forty fathoms of the surface. Once past it there is no bottom on either side until the land is reached. When the ships reached the Grand Bank, the sails were furled, and the crews fished for cod ... with infinite joy and contentment because of the fresh meat, of which we had our fill, after being so long in want of it. [Some crew members] passed their time in gathering the hearts, tripes, and the most delicate portions of the innards of the said codfish, which they hashed small with bacon, spice, and the flesh of the cod, whereof they made as good a white pudding as could be made in Paris and we ate of them with right good will.21\n\nThe Grand Bank, because of its size, sometimes overshadows three nearby banks - Burgeo Bank, due south of the Burgeo Islands; St. Pierre Bank, to the south of St. Pierre and Miquelon; and the Green Bank, off Placentia Bay. The first two take their names from locations on land; Green Bank, originally known as bane am vers or verde (Levasseur 1601), was named by Breton or Norman fishermen. A century later its economic potential was still being stressed by William Taverner (16801768) in his 1713-14 survey of the south coast of Newfoundland. He commented: 'Bane Verte and the other banks lyeing about the coast of Chapeauxrouge should be surveyed ... severall of the French inform'd me that Bane Verte was the finest bank for codfish in the world, and a great many of their ships loaded fish yearly upon it/22 Within the centre of the Grand Bank, there is an area known as the Virgin Rocks. It is a series of rocky ridges only 3.6 metres, or 2 fathoms, deep. In all probability this name does not have religious connotations, as it was a common designation for isolated rocks or shoals off the Newfoundland coast. It is also an older name, being clearly marked on the Augustine Fitzhugh chart of 1693. m ^9^4 an expedition from Memorial University and the College of Fisheries in St. John's undertook an underwater exploration of the Virgin Rocks. During the course of their investigations, three divers, Hugh Lilly, John Snow, and Calvin Trickett, made history as the first men to walk on the floor of the Grand Bank. On 23 June 1964, at 46° 28' latitude, 50° 48' longitude, they fastened a plaque on an underwater rock to mark the event. By the 19705 and 19805 Canada began to awaken to the realization that the once plentiful north Atlantic fish stocks were being depleted. For many years the French, English, Spanish, Portuguese, Atlantic Canadian, and U.S. fleets had fished these waters. Following the Second World War, other nations, large and small, most notably Japan and the\n\nWindows on History and Culture 13 former USSR, began serious fishing on the banks off Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. Reasons for the decline in fish stocks are many, and although there is no single explanation for the phenomenon, there is agreement that major contributing factors were the technological advances which led to overfishing and the presence of the so-called factory ships on the Banks. On i January 1977, Canada declared a 2OO-mile fishing zone and established quotas for the amount of fish that could be taken. A particular problem has centred around jurisdiction of the 'straddling stock' on the Nose and Tail of the Grand Bank, and on the Flemish Cap off the eastern edge of the Grand Bank. The situation was made more difficult since all three areas lie outside Canadian territorial waters. The Nose and Tail are descriptive names that denote projections in the boundaries of the Grand Bank. Tail of the Bank was officially approved as a designation in 1970; while Nose of the Bank, although in common usage, awaits official sanction. The Flemish Cap is a reminder that fishermen from Flanders were once active in this area. In 1607 Marc Lescarbot reported sighting in the mid-Atlantic as many as '13 Flemish ships bound for Spain' and, closer to the Grand Bank, of 'falling in with a Spanish ship well manned with Englishmen and Flemings.'23 Jurisdiction over the straddling fish stocks of the the Nose and Tail of the Grand Bank became the focal point for an international dispute between Canada and Spain in 1995. It should be noted that 'Grand Banks' is sometimes used as a collective term for all fishing banks located southeast of Newfoundland. Another group of fishing banks are found in the Labrador Sea. Unlike those just described and others to the south of Nova Scotia, these are extensions of the mainland and not separated from the coastline. All are named for adjacent land features, and their origins may be found in chapter 3. From north to south these are: SAGLEK, NAIN, MAKKOVIK, HARRISON, HAMILTON, and BELLE ISLE BANKS. The Nova Scotia banks are separated from those of Newfoundland by the 97-kilometre-wide Laurentian Channel. This name is an adaptation of the Latin Laurentia, applied to features associated with the St. Lawrence River and Gulf. There are also four smaller fishing banks situated within the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The largest and most important encircles the Magdalen Islands. The banks directly off the Nova Scotia coast were grouped together in the Paul Ollivier chart of 1624 as bancq d'accadie; however, this name did not survive. Instead, the names of nearby land features were applied, as in: CANSO, SABLE, SAMBRO, BACCARO, ROSEWAY, and LAHAVE. Banquereau\n\nTHE NORTH ATLANTIC FISHING BANKS\n\nWindows on History and Culture 15 Bank, to the southeast of Canso Bank, is probably a variation of the French bane or banque. Banquereau Bank appears as Banquereaux on the Champlain map of 1632, and from the late seventeenth century onward the contemporary spelling is consistent. Banquereau is separated from St. Pierre Bank by a deep channel. Also of French origin is Misaine Bank, situated northwest of Banquereau. This name is derived from an old French word which meant 'foresail/ Sable Bank takes its name from the island (see Nova Scotia entry for origin). Emerald Bank, west-southwest of Sable Island, is undoubtedly a descriptive name. The precise origin of Browns Bank, at the western end of the Nova Scotia banks, is not known. It is listed on the Charles Morris 1755 Chart of the Peninsula of Nova Scotia; however, it is probably much older. Georges Bank, off the southwestern tip of Nova Scotia, is a shared jurisdiction with the United States. First known as Gorges Bank, the origin of the name may be traced to Sir Ferdinando Gorges (ca 1566-1647). A military commander and colonizer, Gorges was a native of Somerset, England. Confidant and associate of Sir Humphrey Gilbert, Sir Walter Raleigh, and Sir Francis Drake, Gorges was a fascinating character who deserves to be better known. An active member of the Plymouth Company and the promoter of the 1607 Popham colony, he is sometimes referred to as 'the father of Maine.' Although he never crossed the Atlantic, Gorges became an enthusiastic supporter of the settlement and development of New England. Shortly before his death in 1647, he published his Briefe Narration of the Originall Undertakings of the Advancement of Plantations into Parts of America. His enthusiastic description of the economic potential of the fishing bank extending from Cape Cod to the Bay of Fundy caused it to be known as Gorges Bank. Over time this name was first corrupted to St. Georges Bank, and later shortened to Georges Bank. The Middle Horizon, 1700-1815 The opening years of the eighteenth century mark a shift in the perspective provided by the windows of history and culture as the far horizon recedes to permit a focus on the middle horizon. The early 17005 also signal a turning-point in the fortunes of France in eastern North America. Although the colony of Acadia dated from the Gua de Monts expedition in 1604-5 and the subsequent founding of PORT ROYAL, serious colonization did not begin until the 16303 and 16405. By the time of the 1671 census, there were some 70 distinct families in a population of\n\n16 Place Names of Atlantic Canada about 500. Thereafter, there was little emigration from France; thus, the majority of Acadians, even today, are direct descendants of these founding families. A high birth rate and low infant mortality soon contributed to a rapid rise in population. By 1707 their numbers had grown to 1,400 and were to reach approximately 13,000 by 1755-24 In reality there were two Acadias, one the area settled and developed by the Acadians, the other much larger and claimed as French territory. Gradually the Acadians moved up the Riviere au Dauphin (ANNAPOLIS RIVER) through to the Bassin des Mines (MINAS BASIN), where they established one of their largest and best-known settlements at GRAND PRE. Soon their villages ringed the basin, from Pisiquid (WINDSOR) to NOEL, to Cobeguit (TRURO), and stretched on beyond Havre a 1'Avocat (ADVOCATE HARBOUR) around Cap Dore (CAPE D'OR) to Beausejour and the Tintamarre (TANTRAMAR) Marshes. From here settlement proceeded eastward along the coast to BAIE VERTE, Remsheg (WALLACE), and TATAMAGOUCHE. This settlement pattern evolved from the Acadian preference for locations where, through the building of dykes, they might farm the fertile marshlands that follow the coastline. For many, their homeland was the west coast of France, where the estuaries, marshes, and tidal waters were similar to those of Acadia. The place names cited in this expansion mark an important trend in the toponymy of the middle horizon. Acadian place names were a mixture of distinctively French names with others of Mi'kmaq origin. It is worth noting that, in almost every instance, the latter indicated important topographical features. The Mi'kmaq, in common with the Maliseet and Passamaquoddy, were good geographers. They possessed an inherent respect both for features of the landscape and for the total physical environment. In addition, a close bond developed between the Mi'kmaq and Acadians. Dating from the days of the great chief Membertou (?-i6n), the Mi'kmaq became not only Acadian allies in war, but also their guides in peacetime exploration. It was no accident that, during the darkest days of their expulsion in 1755, numbers of Acadians found a safe haven among the friendly Mi'kmaq. Although the relationship between later settlers of British origin and the Mi'kmaq and Maliseet was never close, the practice of utilizing existing Amerindian place names continued unabated. Thus, the vast majority of important rivers in the region, such as the MIRAMICHI, RESTIGOUCHE, and MADAWASKA, to cite but three examples, have retained their original names. Later, James DeMille (1833-1880), poet and novel-\n\nWindows on History and Culture 17 1st, waxed eloquent concerning the retention of Amerindian names in his poem 'Sweet Maiden of Quoddy': MEDUXNAKAEG's waters are bluer; NEPlSIQUTT's pools are more black; More green is the bright OROMOCTO, And browner the bright PETITCODIAC; But colours more radiant in autumn I see when I am casting my hook In the waves of the Skoodowabskoosis Or perhaps the SKOODOOWABSKOOK.25\n\nIn 1710, Port Royal, which had passed from French to British hands and back again on many occasions, surrendered for the last time, and France gave up its claim to Acadia by the Treaty of Utrecht, signed in 1713. In the words of the treaty: 'All Nova Scotia or Acadia with its ancient boundaries as also the city of Port Royal, and all other things in these parts which depend on the said lands and islands ... are yielded and made over to the Queen of Great Britain and to her crown forever.' It soon became clear that the phrase 'ancient boundaries' would be given widely different interpretations. The British reverted to Sir William Alexander's claim of 'the land between New England and Newfoundland'; the French, not surprisingly, were unwilling to accept such a sweeping definition of territory. From their standpoint Acadia meant the southerly portion of peninsular Nova Scotia and no more. In the end, although they were forced to give up mainland Nova Scotia, they retained Ile-Saint-Jean (Prince Edward Island) and Cape Breton Island, which they renamed Ile-Royale. Almost immediately the French began the erection of a massive fortress at LOUISBOURG, to be named the capital of the colony of Ile-Royale in 1719. A further indication of the impact of France on the nomenclature of the region can be found in the designation French Shore, once applied to a large portion of the coast of Newfoundland. In the late seventeenth century, the French settlement at Plaisance (PLACENTIA) was fortified to strengthen a claim to a portion of the Newfoundland coastline, and to provide shelter for France's fishing fleets. The English countered by erecting fortifications to protect the harbour at ST. JOHN'S, by this time well-established rendezvous for their fishermen. The wars of 1689-97 and 1702-13 saw a number of raids on rival settlements, with the French occupying St. John's for a time in 1708. By the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713,\n\n18 Place Names of Atlantic Canada France ceded Newfoundland to Britain and, notwithstanding a later attempt at capture during the Seven Years War (1756-63), it was to remain in British hands. After 1713, many of the resident and migratory French fishermen located on the south coast of Newfoundland moved to lle-Royale. Briefly stated, the French Shore26 referred to the section of the coast where the French were granted fishing and curing rights from 1713 through to the Anglo-French Convention of 1904. The territory was first defined as north from CAPE BONAVISTA, on the east coast, to POINT RICHE, on the west. This was confirmed by the Treaty of Paris in 1763, the same treaty which ceded St. Pierre and Miquelon to France. A further adjustment took place by the Treaty of Paris in 1783 through its redefinition of the boundary from CAPE ST. JOHN to CAPE RAY. Following the 1783 treaty, the Americans were given the right to land and dry fish on the coast of Labrador, a right that was reaffirmed in 1818. Taken together, the French and American fishing rights proved to be a serious handicap to the development of Newfoundland. Although France lacked the right to make permanent settlements on the French Shore, the migrant fishermen left behind an impressive list of place names. Examples of contemporary names which may be traced to this period include CAPE NORMAN, CASTORS RIVER, CONCHE, CROQUE, FALAISE POINT, FLEUR DE LYS, GROAIS ISLAND, and LA SCIE. During the heyday of the French migratory fishery the Northern Peninsula was known as the 'Petit Nord/ Following 1713, in the new British colony of Nova Scotia, little was to change beyond the substitution of flags. The renaming of Port Royal as ANNAPOLIS ROYAL was the only outward sign of the new order. Few efforts were made to encourage colonization, with the result that the Acadians became a clear majority by mid-century. Sporadic attempts were made to extract an oath of allegiance from the Acadians; however, they strongly resisted. Their sole concession was a promise of neutrality and a pledge not to bear arms against either France or England. Only a small number accepted French enticements to vacate their fertile lands and move to lle-Royale, Ile-Saint-Jean, or the area around FORT BEAUSEJOUR, erected in 1750 to guard the Isthmus of CHIGNECTO. Meanwhile the supposedly impregnable fortress of Louisbourg fell to a force of New Englanders, only to be restored by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chappelle in 1748. Ironically, the fortress was designed to withstand an attack from the sea; however, on this occasion, and again in 1758, it was to be captured by land, where its defences were weakest.27 The middle of the eighteenth century witnessed an awakening of\n\nWindows on History and Culture 19 interest in Nova Scotia by Britain. In 1749, HALIFAX was founded as a counterbalance to Louisbourg, and the capital was moved there from Annapolis Royal. Immediately on the heels of this action, some 2,700 German- and French-speaking 'Foreign Protestants' were encouraged to settle in Nova Scotia. In 1753 the majority were eventually to locate in and around LUNENBURG. Some of these settlers and their descendants eventually scattered to many parts of the region, but it is here that their distinctive accents and customs are still to be found. Beyond the Lunenburg area, two communities in northern Nova Scotia, TATAMAGOUCHE and RIVER JOHN, were resettled by the 'Foreign Protestants/ Originally a people of the land, they were transformed in a few generations into some of the most successful sailors and fishermen of the Atlantic coast.28 With the outbreak of hostilities in the mid-i75os, Fort Beausejour was captured by the British on 16 June 1755. Simultaneously, FORT GASPEREAU, a French supply depot on BAIE VERTE, fell. Six weeks later, on 25 July 1755, the governor and council of Nova Scotia reached a decision to expel the Acadians from the province and to disperse them 'in such a manner as may best answer our design in preventing their reunion/ From the historical standpoint not only was the 'design' unsuccessful, but many pre-expulsion Acadian place names have survived to mark the lands they once occupied. LAHAVE, PORT JOLI, PORT LATOUR, BEAR RIVER, Port Royal, PARADISE, PEREAU, CANARD, NEW MINAS, Grand Pre, NOEL, DEBERT, MASSTOWN, ADVOCATE HARBOUR, CAPE D'OR, and AULAC are but a random sample of locations that are now occupied by the descendants of others, but remain as toponymic sentinels of old Acadia.29 In the late 17505 and the 17605, lands vacated by the Acadians were immediatedly snapped up by emigrants from New England. Two groups were involved in this migration. The first group was attracted by the rich Acadian dykelands at Annapolis, Minas, and Cobequid, and on the Isthmus of Chignecto. The Oxford English Dictionary defines 'Planter' in its eighteenth-century context as simply one who 'planted' or founded a colony. There were also New England Planter settlements in the St. John River valley, especially in the MAUGERVILLE area. Still another group, composed largely of fishermen, took up lands on the south shore of Nova Scotia, mainly in communities such as YARMOUTH, BARRINGTON, and LIVERPOOL. This relocation placed them closer to the lucrative fishing banks off the coast of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. All too frequently the influence of the New England Planters has been\n\n20 Place Names of Atlantic Canada overlooked or obscured by the later and more numerous Loyalist migration.30 In common with other emigrant groups, especially the Loyalists, they did revive a few New England place names such as Yarmouth, CAMBRIDGE, and CHESTER. More pronounced was their inclination to incorporate Planter surnames in new community names, for example, ATWOODS BROOK, COFFIN ISLAND, LOCKEPORT, SHEFFIELD MILLS, STARRS POINT, TUPPERVILLE, and WALTON. The importance of the Planter migration from New England goes beyond numbers and place names. They came during a formative period in the history of Nova Scotia and took effective possession, imparting to their new homeland many distinctive characteristics. Steeped in the tradition of self-government in church and state, they and their descendants were to help end religious, political, and educational privilege in the province and, by example, elsewhere. Finally, the New Englanders had not experienced the bitter uprooting of the Loyalists. Their parting with their homeland was by choice; as a result, they were to exert a moderating influence on the anti-Americanism characteristi of many Loyalists. Following the Seven Years War (1756-63), the two remaining French colonies in the region, Ile-Royale and Ile-Saint-Jean, were ceded to Britain. Six years later, the latter was designated as the separate colony of St. John's Island. Subsequently, in 1799 its name was to be changed to Prince Edward Island in honour of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent. Meanwhile, the Acadians began the long and painful process of resettlement. On 11 July 1764 an order-in-council was passed, making it legal for Acadians to return to British territories, provided they were willing to take an unqualified oath of allegiance. Many had endured exile in the Thirteen Colonies, to the south, or overseas, in France and England. Still others were prisoners of war at Halifax, Annapolis Royal, Windsor, and Fort Beausejour; a smaller number, who had escaped deportation by living with the Mi'kmaq, now reappeared on the scene. One group took up lands in the ST. MARY'S BAY region, soon to b named the district of CLARE. Acadians who had lived in the PUBNICOS, where their lands had not been resettled, returned home. This area was later known as the district of ARGYLE. The eastern and northern coast of contemporary New Brunswick and the upper St. John River valley attracted the largest number of Acadian settlers. In another area, the MEMRAMCOOK VALLEY, a number of Acadians had escaped deportation, and thus retained their old lands. There was also a general return of Acadians to St. John's Island, ISLE MADAME, and the CHETICAMP\n\nWindows on History and Culture 21 region of Cape Breton. The territorial limits of the new Acadia, particularly north of the Isthmus of Chignecto, can be traced through the names of their communities, such as GRAND-SAULT, SAlNT-FRANgoiSDE-MADAWASKA, RIVIERE-VERTE, SAINT-LEONARD, GRANDE-ANSE, BAIE-\n\nSAINTE-ANNE, SAINT-ANTOINE, and BARACHOIS. Interspersed were a large number of older and distinctly Mi'kmaq place names: CARAQUET, SHIPPAGAN, TRACADIE, RICHIBUCTO, BOUCTOUCHE, and SHEDIAC. Very quickly these locations, and others nearby, took on the character of their new inhabitants to become, in the public mind, identifiably Acadian. A direct result of the British victory in the Seven Years War was the impetus given to the cartography of eastern North America. If Britain was to successfully administer her newly won territories, accurate maps and charts were essential. In turn, three famous surveyors - J.F.W. DesBarres (17217-1824), Samuel Holland (1728-1801), and James Cook (1728-1779) - were destined to play key roles in the mapping of much of the coastline of Atlantic Canada.31 Details of their careers may be gleaned from entries for locations named in their honour: DESBARRES POINT and HOLLAND COVE, in Prince Edward Island, and COOKS HARBOUR, in Newfoundland. In 1764 DesBarres was responsible for naming the stretch of water that separates Prince Edward Island from mainland Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. He called it Northumberland Strait, after HMS Northumberland, the flagship of Rear Admiral Lord Colvill (1717-1770), the commander-in-chief of British naval forces in the North Atlantic from 1767 to 1770. Originally, the strait had been named Baie de Lunario by Jacques Cartier, who entered its northern end on i July 1534, the day of St. Lunarius. For a time it was also known by the descriptive 'Red Sea.' Holland reported 'the sea is frequently of a red hue ... by many people called the Red Sea.' On the occasion of the four-hundredth anniversary of Cartier's first voyage, in 1934, a campaign was launched by the Ligue des Interets Nationaux to rename the strait in honour of its discoverer. Following a lengthy debate and extensive archival research, it was revealed that Cartier had not sailed through the strait and, further, that he had mistaken it for a 'bay.' This point, combined with lack of local support for any change, caused the Canadian Board on Geographic Names to affirm the name Northumberland Strait. If for no other reason than geography, the outbreak of the American Revolution was bound to have a profound impact on Atlantic Canada. Economic ties with New England were close; both regions formed part of a natural north Atlantic trading unit, and more than half the population of Nova Scotia was of New England stock. For a time it appeared\n\n22 Place Names of Atlantic Canada that Nova Scotia might well be the fourteenth colony to rebel. In the end, a combination of circumstances prevailed to keep the province apart from the revolutionary cause. As yet a scattered and comparatively new population, Nova Scotians were deterred by the British presence in Halifax, and more so by British naval superiority. No help was forthcoming from the other thirteen colonies, and the majority of New England Planters, labelled 'His Majesty's Yankees/ attempted to remain neutral. The only serious pro-revolutionary outbreak occurred on the Isthmus of Chignecto and was led by Jonathan Eddy (1726/7-1804), a onetime MLA for CUMBERLAND. It ended in failure, and the Eddy Road that still crosses the AMHERST MARSH serves as a reminder of what might have been. Subsequently, Eddy returned to New England, where he received a grant of land near Bangor, Maine. It was named Eddington in his honour. As the revolution wore on, few ports along the Atlantic Canadian coast were spared raids by American privateers, so that any lingering support for the revolutionary cause was swept away. Examples of such incidents may be found in the entries for Liverpool and Lockeport, in Nova Scotia, and WRIGHTS CREEK, on Prince Edward Island. Even locations farther away, such as ANTELOPE HARBOUR on the Labrador coast, reveal an association with this war. Following the American Revolution the region received a major increase in population through the migration of some 30,000 Loyalists. Most coastal communities in Nova Scotia, Cape Breton, and St. John's Island gained settlers; however, the numbers reaching Newfoundland were small by comparison. The chief areas of settlement were, temporarily, at SHELBURNE, Nova Scotia; north of the Bay of Fundy; and along the St. John River Valley. Between May and November 1783, approximately 14,000 to 15,000 people came to the river valley. The next year, the new province of New Brunswick was created. The official partition took place on 10 September 1784, and the name was chosen as a compliment to King George III, who was descended from the House of Bruns wick. Earlier proposals for naming the new province were New Ireland, suggested by William Knox, then under-secretary of state, but rejected because Ireland was out of royal favour, and Pittsylvania, for William Pitt, then prime minister. In the same year, Cape Breton was created a separate colony, remaining apart from Nova Scotia until 1820. As with other emigrant groups the Loyalists left their imprint on the nomenclature of the region. Sometimes this is evident in transplanted place names such as HAMPSTEAD, KINGSTON, LINCOLN, and WESTFIELD, in New Brunswick; ALBANY CROSS and WESTCHESTER, in Nova Scotia; and\n\nWindows on History and Culture 23 BUNBURY, on Prince Edward Island. By virtue of the Loyalists' status as prominent landholders, their patronymics were frequently incorporated in community names. This explains, by way of example, BLISSFIELD, GIBERSON SETTLEMENT, and SHAMPERS BLUFF, in New Brunswick; BARTON, in Nova Scotia; and LINKLETTER and HASZARD POINT, on Prince Edward Island. The settlement patterns of Loyalists may also be traced in other, less obvious ways. CHARLOTTE COUNTY, New Brunswick, settled principally by Loyalists, was named in 1785 for Queen Charlotte, consort of King George III. In 1784 some 190 Quaker Loyalists founded a community they called Bellevue, now Beaver Harbour, on the Fundy coast. Lack of fertile soil and a disastrous forest fire forced them to move to the plateau behind the settlement, which they named Penn's Fields, later PENNFIELD RIDGE, for William Penn, the famous English Quaker.32 Many Loyalists had strong ties with the military, and a number of grants were made for meritorious service during the revolutionary war. Although first founded by New England Planters, the largely Loyalist settlement of WEYMOUTH, Nova Scotia, became associated with the remarkable military career of Lieutenant-Colonel James Moody (17441809), who saw service on the British side during the war. In like fashion, the many place names associated with Sir Guy Carleton, Lord Dorchester (1724-1808), who played a pivotal role during the revolution, and his brother, Thomas Carleton (1735-1817), the first lieutenantgovernor of New Brunswick, are important historical signposts on the middle horizon of Atlantic Canadian toponymy. Other military ties may be seen in names associated directly or indirectly with regiments or ships that saw service during the revolution. Thus, PRINCE WILLIAM, New Brunswick, although it honours the future King William IV (17651837), was named for him because he was patron of the Kings American Dragoons, a prominent regiment in the war, whose disbanded members received land grants in the area. Similarly, DIGBY, Nova Scotia, was named for Admiral Robert Digby (1732-1815), commander of HMS Atlanta, flagship of the convoy which brought Loyalist settlers to the Digby area. BIRCHTOWN, adjacent to the important Loyalist settlement of Shelburne, points to yet another important facet of the Loyalist migration. During the American Revolution an offer of freedom was made to any slaves who might flee their masters, cross to the British lines, and fight for the British king. As a result, in the summer of 1784 a brigade of some 1,500 arrived to take up lands on the northwest arm of Shelburne harbour. The settlement was named Birchtown in honour of Brigadier-\n\n24 Place Names of Atlantic Canada General Samuel Birch, the British commandant at New York, their port of embarkation. Other black Loyalists were settled at Digby, Annapolis, PRESTON, and GUYSBOROUGH COUNTY, all in Nova Scotia. Time and historical neglect have obscured the role of these Loyalists; however, recent research has drawn attention to their role on the British side in the revolutionary war.33 Although the Loyalists had a considerable impact on the nomenclature of the middle horizon, their other more intangible contributions are also worthy of note. Particularly in New Brunswick, they provided the nucleus of a ruling elite and quickly assumed positions of leadership in church and state. Esther Clark Wright has summarized their overall impact: ... loyalty to the British crown meant respect for law and order and for orderly procedure, it meant unwillingness to resort to violence, and willingness to wait for years rather than to jeopardize ultimate victory by depending on [revolutionary] methods ... As the Loyalist developed into New Brunswicker this was the most valuable contribution he made to the new province and the nation of which it ultimately became a part.34\n\nMeanwhile, Newfoundland was being gradually transformed from 'an island moored for the convenience of the fishery' to the status of a colony. Although for some time anti-colonization policies had been in effect, these were singularly unsuccessful in preventing permanent settlement. One illustration of these regulations is found in the terms of the Palliser Act of 1775, which sought to force the annual return to Britain of fishermen, sailors, and others at the end of each fishing season. It was named for Sir Hugh Palliser, who acted as adviser to the government upon his return to England from service as governor of Newfoundland from 1764 to 1769 (see PALLISER POINT). Since no effective provision was made to enforce the laws forbidding settlement, fishermen went ahead and established year-round residence. Thus, as early as the 17605, the word Newfoundlander, as a descriptor for permanent residents, began to appear in print.35 Thirty years later, in 1793, Chief Justice John Reeves (17527-1829) could say with assurance to the British government: The consequence of [your policies] has been that Newfoundland has been peopled behind your back ... you have abandoned it to be inhabited by anyone who chooses.'36 Although this admonition rings true, by the middle horizon, a distinctive pattern of colonization was beginning to develop in Newfound-\n\nWindows on History and Culture 25 land. For the English, settlement was confined largely to the coastal area from CAPE BONAVISTA to CAPE RACE. By the mid-eighteenth century, in addition to ST. JOHN'S, the following locations had a substantial year round population: BAY BULLS, WITLESS BAY, RENEWS, FERMEUSE, FERRYLAND, OLD PERLICAN, TRINITY, CARBONEAR, and BAY DE VERDE. It is estimated that the summer population of St. John's and immediate vicinity, including QUIDI VIDI, TORBAY, and PETTY HARBOUR, was about 3,000 in the 17505. By the time of the American Revolution, this figure had doubled; however, the permanent winter population was still slightly fewer than half of the total. Farther afield, and northward from GREENSPOND, FOGO ISLAND, and TWILLINGATE, English settlers were being attracted, and some became full-time residents. Following the Treaty of Utrecht, a permanent English presence was beginning to emerge on the south Newfoundland coast, particularly in the area of PLACENTIA BAY. From FORTUNE BAY westward, prior to the American Revolution, numbers dwindled to approximately 600 in the winter months. Who were these people who were willing to brave the elements and extreme isolation to live year-round in Newfoundland? The permanent population during the years 1713 to 1815 was largely drawn from two basic strands: West Country English and Irish, with the latter mainly from Ireland's southern counties. By 1730 many fishing ships en route to Newfoundland called at ports such as Waterford and Cork, providing opportunity for the recruitment of Irish emigrants. Inevitably immigration and settlement were tied to the mercantile and commercial interests then active in Newfoundland. It has been shown by Handcock and others that the territorial expansion of this period was dominated by West Country merchants, especially from Poole, in Dorset. Other contributing factors were the growth of the seal and salmon fisheries and the desire to pursue the inshore cod fishery.37 Another group to have a demographic impact during this period came from the Channel Islands. By the eighteenth century Channel Islanders, especially from Jersey, were active along the south coast of BURIN PENINSULA, which became known as the 'Coast of Chapeau Rouge,' and at Carbonear, HARBOUR GRACE, and CONCEPTION BAY. Their presence can also be pinpointed in place names on the southern coast such as HERMITAGE BAY, JERSEYMANS HARBOUR, JERSEYSIDE, and RENCONTRE BAY. During the same period, Channel Island mercantile interests were also active in Nova Scotia (see entries for ARICHAT, ISLE MADAME, JANVRIN ISLAND, and POINT TUPPER).38 One final category of place names requires mention before we leave the middle horizon of Atlantic Canadian toponymy. By an order-in-\n\n26 Place Names of Atlantic Canada council dated 17 August 1759, the colony of Nova Scotia was divided into five counties, ANNAPOLIS, CUMBERLAND, HALIFAX, KINGS, and LUNENBURG. All were larger than the contemporary divisions of the same name, and all were destined to be further subdivided. For example, by the proclamation of 7 October 1763, Cape Breton Island was formally annexed to Nova Scotia and became part of Halifax County. Two years later, the island was set apart as a separate county. Following a brief existence as a colony (1783-1820) and subsequent reannexation to Nova Scotia, it was again named CAPE BRETON COUNTY. Still later, three additional counties - RICHMOND, INVERNESS, and VICTORIA - were to evolve on the island. In 1765, surveyor Samuel Holland was responsible for the allocation of the three counties - KINGS, QUEENS, and PRINCE created on St. Johns Island (later Prince Edward Island). Within New Brunswick, eight counties were established by legislation in 1786: CHARLOTTE, KINGS, NORTHUMBERLAND, QUEENS, SAINT JOHN, WESTMORLAND, and YORK. The seven new counties created after 1786 were to be carved from the original eight. Details surrounding the origin of county names are provided in the individual entries for each. In the chapters dealing with New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island, county divisions have been included with the entries as a guide to geographical location (see maps on pages 42, 280, and 424). In lieu of county divisions in Newfoundland, the five regional sectors - Avalon, Eastern, Central, Western, and Labrador - established by the provincial government have been substituted as a locational aid (see maps on pages 152 and 153). The Nearer Horizon, i8i5~Present While posterity may not agree with the opinion of The Times of London that 'nothing in ancient or modern history equals the effect of the victory at Waterloo,'39 there is agreement that it was a major historical landmark. The decisive defeat of the French under Napoleon on 18 June 1815, and the victory of the British and their allies, led by the Duke of Wellington, had repercussions far beyond the boundaries of Europe. So complete was the triumph that even today the very word Waterloo has not lost its meaning as a synonym for the most crushing defeat. Predictably the battle and the name of the 'Iron Duke' found a firm niche in the toponymy of Atlantic Canada. Both Newfoundland/Labrador and Prince Edward Island have a WELLINGTON and a WATERLOO POINT. In New Brunswick there is a WATERLOO CREEK, LAKE, and STATION, plus two WELLINGTONS, two WELLINGTON BROOKS, and a LAKE WELLINGTON.\n\nWindows on History and Culture 27 Nova Scotia claims three WELLINGTONS, a WATERLOO LAKE, and a WATERLOO RIVER. The peace that followed Waterloo ushered in a tide of emigration from the British Isles, particularly to the three Maritime provinces. In Nova Scotia, recently disbanded soldiers, including some who served in the War of 1812 between Britain and the United States, received land grants in several parts of the province (for examples, see entries such as ALDERSVILLE and NEW ROSS). During the 18205 and 18305, successive waves of Scots, Irish, and to a lesser extent English and Welsh emigrants came to Nova Scotia. In 1815 the population stood at approximately 75,000; by 1827 this figure had grown to more than 150,000 and was to reach 200,000 a decade later. The largest proportion of the new settlers came from Scotland. In a five-year interval between 1815 and 1820,1,674 immigrants entered through the port of PICTOU alone.40 This Scottish migration had begun in the previous century with the arrival of the ship Hector from Loch Broom, Scotland, on 15 September 1773. The flood-tide of emigration reached its peak in the early decades of the nineteenth century when thousands of Scottish Highlanders were forced to seek refuge overseas. The dream of Sir William Alexander was being fulfilled in an unexpected manner as Nova Scotia became New Scotland in fact as well as in name (see entry for BRORA LAKE, Nova Scotia). The course of this nineteenth-century Scottish settlement of northern Nova Scotia is easily traced through place names: SCOTSBURN, LOCH BROOM, NEW GLASGOW, GAIRLOCH, SUNNY BRAE, GLENGARRY, GLENCOE, GLENELG, KNOYDART, ARISAIG, DUNMAGLASS, LOCHABER, and LOCH KATRINE tell their own story. The Scottish immigrants, whether because of homesickness, innate clannishness, or a sense of history, were more prone than any other group to impose names reminiscent of their homeland. A glance at the map of Cape Breton bears eloquent testimony to this point. Here may be found BARRA GLEN and BARRA MENS COVE; BEN EOIN and BEINN BREACH; LOCH BAN and LOCH LOMOND; PIPERS COVE and PIPERS GLEN; INVERNESS and IONA; SKIR DHU and SKYE GLEN; ULVA and USIGNE BAN FALLS.\n\nIn 1815 the Loyalists and their descendants still constituted the core of New Brunswick's population. However, they were rapidly being outnumbered by new immigrants, chiefly Irish and Scots, many of whom entered the province on timber ships returning from Britain. As a result, SAINT JOHN and sections of the Miramichi Valley began to acquire a decidedly Celtic cast. By 1815 the Irish in Saint John were sufficiently numerous to petition the legislature for aid in building a church.\n\n28 Place Names of Atlantic Canada Although fewer Scots emigrated to New Brunswick than did to Nova Scotia, they left their imprint on the map of the province, as one cluster of Scottish place names in Restigouche County will verify: ATHOLVILLE, BLAIR ATHOL, GLENCOE, GLENLIVET, BALMORAL, and DUNDEE. The population of New Brunswick continued to increase in the early years of the nearer horizon. From 25,000 in 1805, it grew to 74,000 in 1824. Ten years later, it was just under 120,000, and by mid-century was close to the 200,000 mark. Much of this increase can be accounted for by emigration from the British Isles. By the 18205 society on the Miramichi which 'had always been voluble and explosive' was augmented by 'a powerful Irish ingredient which appreciably increased these qualities/41 The Irish settlement of this region is epitomized in the legendary DUNGARVON RIVER and the fact that an Irish Festival is held annually to remember an extraordinarily storied past. Elsewhere the Irish presence is indicated by scattered place names, such as LONDONDERRY, WATERFORD, SHANNON, SHANNON VALE, INNISHANNON BROOK, IRISHTOWN, and IRISH SETTLEMENT. A number of former soldiers, including members of the New Brunswick Fencibles, fresh from service in the War of 1812, received land grants in what was to become Victoria County. The Royal West India Rangers gave their name to RANGER SETTLEMENT, located south of Grand Falls/Grand Sault. The New Brunswick and Nova Scotia Land Company, organized in London in 1832, was responsible for placing a number of British immigrants in York County. Communities such as STANLEY and TEMPERANCE VALE date from this period. From its institution in 1767, the settlement of Prince Edward Island was dominated by the tortuous debate that surrounded the 'land question.' A final resolution to the problem was not reached until 1878 (see entries for EGMONT BAY, CENTRAL LOT l6, ABELLS CAPE, and HAY RIVER).\n\nIn 1800 the total population was under 5,000; by 1827 it had risen to 23,226. Thereafter there was a slow but steady rise, from 32,392 in 1832 to 94,021 in 1871, just prior to the province's entry into Confederation in 1873. As was the case in northern Nova Scotia and Cape Breton Island, the majority of new immigrants to Prince Edward Island came from Scotland. Place names of Scottish origin are to be found in all three counties; however, Queens, which attracted the majority of Scottish settlers, has the largest number. Thus we find place names such as MONTROSE and ELLERSLIE in Prince County; BREADALBANE, STRATHGARTNEY CLYDE RIVER, DUNSTAFFNAGE, ARGYLE SHORE, KEPPOCH, and UIGG in Queens; and ANNANDALE, ROCK BARRA, and DUNDEE in Kings. One\n\nWindows on History and Culture 29 example of the Scottish sense of nostalgia and history may be found in the proliferation of place names flowing from from the Jacobite Rebellion of 1745 and the attempt by Prince Charles Edward Stuart to claim the British crown. Prince Edward Island alone has a GLENFINNAN, CULLODEN, GLENCORRADALE, SCOTCHFORT, KINGSBORO, and MILTON, all names with strong Stuart associations. Remarkably, these names and many others, throughout Atlantic Canada and beyond, were bestowed long after the death, both of the prince and of his cause.42 During the nineteenth century the Irish ranked next to the Scots in the demographic mix that was Prince Edward Island. Arriving later than the Scots, they settled in the interior of Prince and Queens counties and along the border of Queens and Kings counties. Their toponymic footprints may be traced in such place names as EMERALD JUNCTION, EMYVALE, KELLYS CROSS, and KINKORA. It is not surprising to find that place names of English origin constitute the largest classification of names assigned in the nearer horizon, from 1815 to the present. During the first half of the nineteenth century, place-naming was largely the prerogative of the colonial governor and council. The majority of governors and other administrative officials either were English or were educated in England. Most had seen service in the British army or navy, and this was to colour their recommendations concerning place names. By way of illustration, the first two lieutenant-governors of Nova Scotia following 1815, Dalhousie and Kempt, were both veterans of Waterloo. As new settlement took place during the nineteenth century, names of English origin and of the governors themselves were assigned with amazing frequency. Among the many governors who managed to enshrine their names or have them enshrined were: (Newfoundland) Sir Charles Hamilton, Sir Anthony Musgrave, Sir John Glover, Sir Alexander Bannerman, Sir Cavendish Boyle, and Sir Ralph Campney Williams; (New Brunswick) Thomas Carleton, Sir Howard Douglas, Sir Archibald Harvey, and Sir Edmund Head; (Nova Scotia) Sir John Wentworth, Sir John Sherbrooke, Earl of Dalhousie, Sir John Kempt, and Sir Peregrine Maitland; (Prince Edward Island) J.F.W. DesBarres and Sir Henry Vere Huntley. Usually the surname was used; however, in some instances, as with Sir Edmund Head and Sir Cavendish Boyle, the baptismal name became the place name. The award for bestowing the largest number of names in the shortest span of time must go to the Earl of Dalhousie, who served as lieutenant-governor of Nova Scotia from 1816 to 1819. Within this short period nine locations and a university were to be assigned his name,\n\n30 Place Names of Atlantic Canada including DALHOUSIE, EARLTOWN, and LAKE RAMSAY. Later, when he became governor-in-chief of Canada (1819-28), he did not lose interest in place-naming. The parish of DALHOUSIE in New Brunswick, along with the town and two other nearby features (by association), bear his name, as does Dalhousie Station in the Soulanges district of Quebec. To round out the honours, there is a Dalhousie Township; two Dalhousie Lakes, and a Dalhousie Mills in eastern Ontario, plus a Port Dalhousie that is now part of St. Catharines, Ontario. During the mid-nineteenth century, the Crimean War (1853-6), fought by Britain and France against Russia, was to inspire a number of place names. INKERMAN, HAVELOCK, MALAKOFF, FLORENCEVILLE, and\n\nALMA, in New Brunswick, and KARSDALE, PORT WILLIAMS, FENWICK, WILLIAMSDALE, and ALMA (again), in Nova Scotia, all have Crimean associations. Following Confederation in 1867, the expansion of the railway system and postal service led to a widespread assignment of new names or the replacing of names frequently duplicated elsewhere. Dozens of place names in all parts of Atlantic Canada mark the name of the first postmaster (see EVERETT, HATFIELD POINT, LAGRACEVILLE, and THOMASTON CORNER, in New Brunswick). Provincially, the adoption of free school legislation began in Nova Scotia in 1864-5 and soon expanded to the other two Maritime provinces. The definition of school-section boundaries, especially in rural areas, led to the adoption of new names, many of which were destined to become community names. Often the latter were selected by popular vote and sometimes commemorated a local person or incident. Prince Edward Island examples include FARMINGTON, HARMONY, KILMUIR, and NEW ACADIA. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, governments began to recognize that a formalized procedure was necessary in order to bring direction and consistency to the field of nomenclature. On 18 September 1897 an order-in-council was passed establishing the Canadian Board on Geographic Names. Its lineal descendant, the Canadian Permanent Committee on Geographical Names, dates from 1961. Membership on the committee is drawn from all federal authorities with an interest in nomenclature, along with representatives from the provinces and territories, and the academic community. Its responsibilities and functions are broadly defined as relating to 'all questions of geographical nomenclature dealing with Canada,' and the undertaking of 'research into the origin and usage of geographical names/43 In 1904, Newfoundland created a Nomenclature Board with the power 'to recommend ... the name or renaming of any town, village or\n\nWindows on History and Culture 31 settlement or any geographical feature in Newfoundland/44 In the evolution of Newfoundland place names there had been a great deal of repetition, often resulting in identical or similar names. Thus, Broad Cove, Conception Bay, became ST. PHILLIPS; Broad Cove, Trinity Bay, SOMERSET; and Broad Cove, south of Ferryland, CAPPAHAYDEN. PORTUGAL COVE, Trepassey Bay, was renamed PORTUGAL COVE SOUTH to distinguish it from the other PORTUGAL COVE, on Conception Bay. Many of the 'Seal Coves/ or variants thereof, were replaced; for example, Seal Cove, Bonavista Bay, became PRINCETON. Similarly, several Tickle Harbours were changed, as in Tickle Harbour, Trinity Bay, which became BELLEVUE. In addition to these necessary changes, there were others of a more controversial nature. The late Victorian-Edwardian era of the nearer horizon was a time of place-name reform remarkably akin to the 'politically correct' linguistic campaigns of the 19905. Examples of place names that fell by action of the Newfoundland Nomenclature Board were Cuckolds Cove, which became DUNFIELD; Turks Gut, MARYSVALE; Grand River Gut, SEARSTON; Famish Gut, FAIR HAVEN; Pipers Hole, SWIFT CURRENT; and Scilly Cove, WINTERTON. Not all of the edicts of the board were accepted. SIBLEYS COVE was renamed Prowsetown in honour of historian D.W. Prowse, only to revert to its original name. However, the name Prowsetown is still used occasionally for this village southwest of Bay de Verde.45 It is worth noting that, while Famish Gut was to disappear, nearby PINCHGUT POINT survived place-name reform, as did TURKS GUT LONG POND. Likewise, DILDO was successful in overcoming several attempts at expurgation. The ghosts of surveyors James Cook and Michael Lane, responsible for some of these unusual and 'whimsical' names, would approve. Place-naming in the most recent part of the near horizon, the twentieth century, followed patterns already well established over time. Descriptive names, evocative of some aspect of the land or sea, continued to dominate place-naming. Surprisingly, the First World War, with its epic battles in which Newfoundlanders and Canadians played significant roles, inspired few Atlantic Canadian place names. One exception was the Battle of Saint Quentin, an important Allied victory in the last year of the war. In 1919 the name of Andersons Siding, New Brunswick, was changed to SAINT-QUENTIN in recognition of this battle. In 1931, Passchendaele, scene of a major engagement by the Canadian army in 1917, was adopted as a post-office name in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia. This area is still called Passchendaele by older residents. Perhaps as a substi-\n\n32 Place Names of Atlantic Canada tute for community names, many streets throughout Atlantic Canada commemorate First World War battles. Thus there is scarcely a town or city, large or small, that does not have a Vimy Street or Avenue. The Second World War battle of DIEPPE, 19 August 1942, is remembered in the town adjacent to Moncton, New Brunswick. Two Newfoundland locations have direct links with this war: BANTING LAKE and the HOGAN TRAIL. While their names stem from other sources, GOOSE BAY, Labrador, and GANDER, Newfoundland, became internationally recognized during the Second World War for their role in the aerial defence of the north Atlantic. The names of the famous, and sometimes the not so famous, have always inspired place names. CHURCHILL, Prince Edward Island, named for Winston Spencer Churchill (1874-1965), was assigned as early as 1900 for his exploits as a correspondent in the Boer War. More controversial was the decision by Newfoundland premier J.R. Smallwood to rename Hamilton Falls and River for the revered Second World War British prime minister (note the entry for CHURCHILL FALLS). Sir John Hope Simpson (1868-1961), a member of the Newfoundland Commission of Government in the early 19305 is remembered in PORT HOPE SIMPSON, Labrador. One major interest of Simpson's, a land-resettlement scheme for the unemployed, reached back to the Norse MARKLAND as a name for its most successful project. LUMSDEN DAM and MOUNT McCURDY, both in Nova Scotia, and SEARY PEAK, in Newfoundland and Labrador, continued the trend of naming features for individuals. New Brunswick has honoured a wide variety of people, both from the historical and more contemporary fields. This is particularly notable in the names of peaks in the Geologists, Historians, and Missionaries ranges, and the Naturalists Mountains. In 1964 a unique approach to mountain-naming was put forward by Arthur F. Wightman, the New Brunswick representative on the CPCGN. Adjacent to North Pole Stream was NORTH POLE MOUNTAIN. This inspired Wightman to recommend the names of St. Nicholas's reindeer, drawn from the poem by Clement Moore, for the surrounding peaks. The range is now generally known as the CHRISTMAS MOUNTAINS, a name first used by David Folster, a New Brunswick journalist. In 1964 an unsuccessful attempt was made to rename SEVOGLE, New Brunswick, 'Mount Kennedy,' for U.S. president John F. Kennedy, assassinated on 22 November 1963. It is now the official policy of the CPCGN not to bestow place names for non-Canadians, thus closing a once popular source of names. Upon occasion names from the historical past have been utilized in\n\nWindows on History and Culture 33 later place-naming. In 1962 the stretch of water between Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick was designated Abegweit Passage, after the MV Abegweit, one of the Marine Atlantic ferries traversing this route. Rand suggests that the name is derived from the Mi'kmaq Abahquit, lying parallel with the land/ or Epegweit, 'lying in the water/ The word is also 'freely' translated as 'cradled on the waves.' It was once applied to the entire island, one of the seven Mi'kmaq districts of the Maritimes. In recent years a concerted effort has been made to restore original Inuit names for features in Labrador (see KAUMAJET MOUNTAINS, KILLINIQ ISLAND, and KIKKERTASOAK ISLAND). The naming of MOUNT CAUBVICK in 1981 is an illustration of the appropriate use of historical names. At the very least, indigenous place names are seldom repeated elsewhere! An important category of contemporary names has resulted from municipal amalgamations. If the number of units to be combined is small, original names are frequently joined, as in PERTH-ANDOVER, New Brunswick, or CHANNEL-PORT AUX BASQUES, Newfoundland. Sometimes this becomes impossible, as in 1980 when nine Newfoundland communities were combined to form CONCEPTION BAY SOUTH. For the same reason MIRAMICHI became the name, in 1995, of the newly amalgamated city on the Miramachi River in New Brunswick. In other instances new names are sometimes selected by voters in a special plebiscite. STRATFORD, Prince Edward Island, came into being i April 1995, when a group of communities on the eastern edge of Charlottetown united to form a new town. In the late twentieth century, many suburban areas were systematically amalgamated or annexed to adjacent towns and cities. Despite the passage of years, a number of these 'absorbed' place names are still in common use. Thus, ROCKINGHAM, ARMDALE, and SPRYFIELD remain as widely used local names within the city of HALIFAX. By reason of their longevity and current usage, many such names have been included in this book. At the time of writing, Cape Breton Regiona Municipality is the designation for the 1995 union of all municipal units in Cape Breton County. In like fashion, Halifax Regional Municipality is the 'working title' for Halifax, DARTMOUTH, BEDFORD, and adjacent areas amalgamated in 1996. Within the enabling legislation, there is a provision for changing this name, at the discretion of the new council elected 2 December 1995. Why do place names, such as many of those cited in this chapter, endure? Can the claim be made that they are windows on the history and culture of Atlantic Canada? One answer is provided by New Bruns-\n\n34 Place Names of Atlantic Canada wick scientist and historian William Francis Ganong, who wrote: 'Place names form a permanent register or index of the events or course of a country's history; they are fossils exposed in the cross section of that history, marking its successive periods; and so lasting are they that records in stone or brass are not to be compared with them for endurance.'46 It is a long way back to the place names first implanted on Atlantic Canadian shores. Almost a millennium has passed since the Norse first discovered Vinland; but even before that time the Amerindian and Inuit people were here, as their toponymic traces testify. By the late fifteenth century, place-naming as a territorial landmark by west Europeans had became an accepted practice in the New World. There then followed nearly two centuries of conflict, largely between France and England, for supremacy on the sea and control of the land. When the dust of battle had settled, many of the place names first noted on the far horizon remained, demonstrating that endurance so eloquently inferred by Ganong. Not even cataclysmic events, such as le grand derangement, the expulsion of the Acadians in 1755, was sufficient to erase the record. The late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries saw a succession of migrations to various sections of Atlantic Canada, and with each wave of people scores of new place names were added to the map. In the transition from the middle to the nearer horizon, a succession of people pass before our eyes: New England Planters and exiled Acadians drawn back to their homeland; the 'Foreign Protestants' from central Europe, and Loyalist refugees from the Thirteen Colonies to the south; famine-weary Irish and displaced Scottish Highlanders; disbanded English soldiers and Lowland Scot and Welsh adventurers; West Country merchants and Channel Island entrepreneurs - to name but a cross-section. Through their place names, all were to join other settlers in enriching the heritage of the region. While it is not being suggested that every aspect of the past of Atlantic Canada may be interpreted through toponymy, it is fair to advance the claim that place names provide a series of illuminating windows on the history and culture of the region. NOTES\n\ni Rand was also responsible for compiling a list of Mi'kmaq place names with appropriate translations. See Silas T. Rand, Micmac Place Names in the Atlantic Provinces (Ottawa: Queen's Printer 1919). The Mi'kmaq form of government is discussed in Daniel N. Paul, We Were Not Savages: A Micmac\n\nWindows on History and Culture 35 Perspective on the Collision of European and Micmac Civilization (Halifax: Nimbus Publishing 1993); note particularly chs. i and 2. 2 See R.A. Skelton, Thomas E. Marston, and George D. Painter, The Vinland Map and the Tartar Relation (New Haven: Yale University Press 1965) and R.A. Skelton, The Vinland Map and the Tartar Relation,' Geographical Magazine 38/9 (1965-6), 662-8. Canadian cartographer T.E. Layng has placed the question of possible Norse maps in perspective: 'It is very unlikely that the rugged Vikings of the generations that frequented our shores ever produced anything on durable material which we would recognize as a map. Considering that the earliest extant chart of the Mediterranean world dates from the 14th century, it surely would be a matter of wonder if the Norsemen, without a compass and without any fixed idea of orderly exploration, had left a pattern of their voyages': T.E. Layng, ed., Sixteenth Century Maps Relating to Canada (Ottawa: National Archives of Canada 1956), vii. A new and expanded edition of The Vinland Map and the Tartar Relation was issued by Yale University Press in 1996. Recent scientific evidence shows that the ink used on the map, previously thought to be of the twentieth century, is fifteenth century in origin. Whether the map, drawn by an unknown cartographer, was actually based on records or traditions of the Norse explorers will, however, continue to be a matter for scholarly debate. Fortunately, since the first edition in 1965, we now have archaeological proof of the Norse presence in Newfoundland. See also Brian Cuthbertson, 'Voyages to North America before John Cabot: Separating Fact from Fiction,' paper read before the Royal Nova Scotia Historical Society, 15 November 1994. 3 Helge Ingstad, Westward to Vinland (Toronto: Macmillan of Canada 1969), 75 4 At the time of writing, planning for the 1997 anniversary of the Cabot voyage is well under way on both sides of the Atlantic. The Newfoundland Department of Tourism has already targeted the potential of this historic event with advance advertising. Overseas, at Redcliffe Quay in Bristol, a replica of Cabot's ship, the Matthew, is under construction, at a cost of $2 million Canadian. It is scheduled to sail to Newfoundland in June 1997. In view of the uncertainty surrounding Cabot's precise landfall, it is hoped that Matthew II will also visit Cape Breton and Prince Edward Island. 5 The stamps issued by Newfoundland were a two-cent rose stamp, bearing a portrait of Cabot (or, rather, a suggested likeness, since no known portrait exists); a ten-cent brown stamp, with a sketch of the Matthew; and a sixtycent black stamp, depicting Henry VII. In 1949, when Newfoundland entered Confederation, Canada issued a four-cent stamp, also showing a picture of the Matthew. The depiction of Cabot's ship used on both stamps was a reprint of an American issue of 1893, when the same sketch appeared on the\n\n36 Place Names of Atlantic Canada three-cent stamp as the 'flagship of Columbus.'
