Capt. Frederick Marryat RN (1792–1848)\n\nT\n\nhe year 2008 marked the 250th anniversary of the capture of the French fortress of Louisbourg on Isle Royale, now Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, by a British naval-military expedition. Many of the ‘‘Britons’’ who helped secure this notable victory were born in North America. The ﬁghting around the fortress in 1758 was, however, only one element of a well-planned and concerted four-part campaign designed to seize Louisbourg. For the ﬁrst six months of the campaign, Royal Navy ﬂeets and squadrons carried out their part by patrolling eastern Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Nova Scotia waters to prevent France’s relief efforts reaching Isle Royale. These enabled the fourth part, in which another ﬂeet, led by Adm. the Hon. Edward Boscawen (a direct ancestor of the author), put Maj. Gen. Jeffery Amherst, Brig. James Wolfe, and over 13,000 soldiers ashore in an amphibious assault landing under ﬁre.∞ The ‘‘joint’’ naval-military force, the largest deployed by Great Britain in that era, then laid siege to Louisbourg, a key marketplace for France’s Newfoundland Grand Banks ﬁsheries and Atlantic trade, a privateer base, and, many\n\nxiii\n\nxiv\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nthought, the barbican protecting the St. Lawrence River and heartland of French Canada.≤ After forty-nine days under siege, Louisbourg’s Vauban-style defenses were breached, their guns mostly dismounted, and all but two of the ships of the line of the French navy (la Marine) in the harbor had been destroyed. Admiral Boscawen sent in ﬁfty-one boats by night and captured the remaining vessels: Prudent was aground and set alight, a dramatic scene later painted by Richard Paton (ﬁgure 1). Seeing scaling ladders in the British trenches, the garrison sought honorable terms but were forced to accept the status of prisoners of war. French ofﬁcers felt strongly that they deserved better. Great Britain’s previous record in joint or amphibious warfare was poor (as Captain Marryat’s quotation above, which neatly summarizes the 1741 Cartagena attack, suggests). Richard Harding deﬁnes such operations as ‘‘a mode of action in which a military force, capable of being fully maintained at sea, is despatched to accomplish speciﬁc objectives on enemy territory.’’ In 1759 Capt. Thomas More Molyneux, in his Conjunct Expeditions, calculated that only seven out of thirty-four ‘‘Great Armaments’’ (joint expeditions more than 4,000 men strong) between 1603 and 1758 had succeeded. Only that led by Commodore Peter Warren and Maj. Gen. William Pepperrell at Louisbourg in 1745 was of notable size. Failures had occurred at Cadiz (1702), Quebec (1711), St. Augustine (1740), Cartagena (1741), Pondicherry (1748), and Rochefort and Louisbourg (1757)—most of these are analyzed later. Smaller ventures fared better: twenty-three out of thirty-four such operations succeeded, including Gibraltar (1704) and Porto Bello (1739). Molyneux cites poor intelligence, illcoordinated planning, and ‘‘want of a system and a general insufﬁciency in this kind of war’’ as reasons for these failures. One might add personality problems, ill health among troops and sailors, and inadequate resources as common factors. The lesson was clear. ‘‘If it be true that a house divided cannot stand,’’ Col. James Stanhope wrote in 1702, ‘‘I am afraid it is still more true that an army and ﬂeet, each divided against itself, and each against the other, can make no conquests.’’≥ Victory at Louisbourg followed three years of military embarrassments. To ascribe success merely to the fact that Admiral Boscawen and General Amherst worked aﬂoat and ashore ‘‘with great harmony, industry, and union’’ as James Wolfe, energetic and successful during\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nxv\n\nthe siege, wrote is to overlook the fact that events there were but one part of the larger campaign: such an assertion also ignores the strengths and limitations of the leadership and morale as well as the plans, preparations, actions, and logistics of the British joint forces and their French opponents.∂ Britain’s war minister, William Pitt, brought an impressive set of talents together in 1757, gained agreement on ﬁnancial and military priorities, identiﬁed competent commanders, and launched powerful forces to different areas of the world in timely fashion to achieve linked objectives in 1758. The British fought a campaign that took note of lessons from previous expeditions, capitalized on administrative work done in the 1740s, and made good use of recent intelligence. The Navy Board, Victualling Board, and Board of Ordnance had supported Adm. Edward Vernon and Brig. Thomas Wentworth’s 1740–42 Caribbean expedition, but the 1757–58 Louisbourg campaign was much larger and more complicated. Innovation was evident in the assumptions, headquarters staff, and joint decision making—no timeconsuming ‘‘councils of war,’’ where commanders reached decisions in committee, were held. When the British force assembled in Halifax, a hard-edged professionalism was evident in the development of amphibious-landing techniques, in uncompromising training ashore and aﬂoat, and in arranging care for the sick and wounded. Once the army landed at Louisbourg, the Royal Navy committed hundreds of men, and heavy guns, to the siege while maintaining blockade and supply operations. The experience gained during this campaign shaped Britain’s amphibious capability, which Pitt used subsequently to construct a trading empire. The book looks at the naval and military commanders, experienced, carefully chosen, and harmonious on the British side, but by contrast fatally divided and reactive in the French fortress and naval squadron. The levels of war at which commanders operated were not as well deﬁned then as they are today—as described below—and the exercise of command was inﬂuenced greatly by personalities. This examination looks as closely at the French side as the British—and although French interservice relations and morale were poor at Louisbourg, overall la Marine proved in 1758 that it still had considerable capability. Command, decision making, and the navies and armies of Britain and France changed in the decades after Louisbourg. Chapter 1 sketches the situation in 1757–58 together with the strategic\n\nxvi\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nbackground, the essential context for the campaign. The growth of Louisbourg, European siege warfare, and the successful 1745 AngloAmerican siege are described in chapter 2. Previous experience and the 1758 expedition’s planning and mounting are covered in chapter 3. France made huge efforts to supply and reinforce Louisbourg; these, and the actions of the British squadrons harrying them, which have hitherto received little attention, are analyzed in chapters 4 and 5. The subsequent ﬁve chapters record how the regiments were brought together and trained for the fourth part of the campaign (chapter 6), the assault landing (chapter 7), and the siege at Louisbourg itself (chapters 8–10). Chapter 11 covers the operations following the siege and the effect of the news in Europe. The 1758 Louisbourg campaign is little-known today. To use one rough yardstick, probably only three ﬁgures who fought there are commemorated with statues today, though none of them for their 1758 achievements. James Wolfe, hero of Quebec, stands in Britain and Capt. James Cook, a warship’s master at Louisbourg and a circumnavigator and explorer in the 1760s–70s, is depicted in England, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand; Lt. Jean Vauquelin, the only French sea ofﬁcer to hinder British efforts seriously at Louisbourg, has a statue in Montreal. A fourth ﬁgure, the thirteen-year-old African slave Olaudah Equiano, was a servant in the British ﬂagship, HMS Namur, at Louisbourg: later a leading abolitionist in England, he is becoming better known than those commemorated in bronze.∑ Admiral Boscawen and General Amherst, honored by their generations, have their memorials, but it is hard to ﬁnd even portraits of their French counterparts, Augustin de Boschenry, chevalier de Drucour, governor of Louisbourg, and his principal commanders, Capitaine de Vaisseau (senior captain) Marquis Desgouttes and Lt. Col. Marchant de La Houlière (who reappeared as a general during the French Revolutionary War). Yet it was individual people, most now forgotten, who either fought as commanders or in ships’ companies or regiments and platoons ashore around Louisbourg or shared as noncombatants the burdens of suffering. Descriptions of ﬁghting in the American wilderness and of eighteenth-century sea battles exist in print, but there are few accounts of sieges despite their prevalence: during the period 1680– 1748, more major sieges (167) were conducted in Europe than land engagements (144). Histories of eighteenth-century naval-military\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nxvii\n\noperations are rare. This work attempts to explain what it was like to ﬁght or to labor in these complex and hazardous enterprises.∏ Some deﬁnitions are valuable in a Campaigns & Commanders work. In the military sense the word ‘‘campaign’’ describes a set or series of actions or operations following a common overall intent directed by commanders, who may be political or military leaders. The set of actions in a campaign should contribute directly to high-level objectives in a conﬂict. Campaigns are usually fought within a deﬁned geographical area (theater of war) and sometimes within a speciﬁed time period (perhaps a season). The set of actions may be identiﬁed, then or later, as a distinct part of a conﬂict. Campaign actions today may include activities not just in the land, naval or maritime, and air environments but also in the areas of ideas, beliefs, or other nonmilitary spheres such as popular support or resources. Since ‘‘campaign’’ entered dictionaries in the early 1600s, conﬂict and the exercise of command have been stratiﬁed into levels. At the lowest level, ‘‘tactics’’ traditionally refer to the methods and interaction of individuals involved in ﬁghting, though the numbers engaged in decisive eighteenth-century ﬁghting ranged from hundreds to tens of thousands. The results of the actions of individuals or small groups in skirmishes or larger battles inﬂuenced the outcomes of wars, or what became known in the nineteenth century as the ‘‘strategic’’ level. There was also, and still is, a tier of military action equating to a campaign or theater of war, which in the later nineteenth century was described as the ‘‘operational’’ level. Some ambiguity surrounds the word ‘‘operational,’’ however, for it can mean both the fact of ﬁghting (as opposed to training and exercises) and the range of military action between the strategic level, normally associated with national, alliance, or coalition aims, commanders, and resources, and the tactical. The second area for deﬁnition is ‘‘generalship,’’ an art tempered by science that provides command of ﬁghting formations comprising various arms (infantry, artillery, or engineers, for example) in war. Lt. Gen. Jonathon Riley recently described generalship in Napoleon as a General; many of his principles also apply to more junior commanders.π Although Napoleon commanded forty years after Louisbourg, and the French Revolution changed some aspects, principles of generalship altered little. ‘‘In the Napoleonic period, just as now,’’\n\nxviii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nGeneral Riley states, ‘‘the general had to be the man in a military organisation who could recognise any problem at issue, in its entirety; deﬁne those things which were likely to be decisive (very rarely that one event or action only); and having done this, change the situation to advantage in order to win.’’ Generals—commanders herein, since the Louisbourg campaign involved navies and armies— may be judged by their ability to ‘‘command,’’ a function combining leadership, control and management of men and resources, and decision making; by their grasp of the political dimension that their operations inﬂuence; and by an understanding of people, thought processes, and perceptions. ‘‘Leadership’’ involves the motivation of people: Field Marshal Viscount Montgomery deﬁned it as the ‘‘will to dominate, together with the character which inspires conﬁdence.’’ Courage (both physical and moral), willpower, the ability to communicate, the human touch, professional expertise, loyalty, a willingness to accept responsibility, and being able to make the principle of cooperation (with other services, allies, and civilians) a reality are timeless components of leadership; for junior commanders leadership and command are almost indivisible. The senior commander’s decision-making ability is critical and involves a balance between intuition and systematic thought processes together with developing and maintaining the intricate relationship with his staff ofﬁcers, who provide him with information and develop his intentions into detailed plans. Many secondary sources describing the struggle for eighteenth-century North America are well known. Robert Beatson, who served at Rochefort (1757), and Thomas Mante, who fought at Havana (1762), both published Anglo-centric Seven Years’ War histories later in the century, but it was the acclaimed Francis Parkman, a New England historian with a romantic—and often partisan—view together with expansive prose, who researched widely and chronicled the struggle for the American ‘‘forest,’’ as he called it, a century later. Parkman memorably described ruined Louisbourg’s grassy solitude dotted with a few grazing sheep and a ﬁshing hamlet. J. S. McLennan’s Louisbourg from its Foundation to its Fall, published in 1918, was the authoritative account for many years. His full text, however, has not been reprinted and suffers from dated scholarship and patchy source attribution. Several sets of historians mention Louisbourg, including Lawrence Gip-\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nxix\n\nson and Douglas Leach, accomplished historians of empire; naval strategists, including Capt. Alfred Mahan, Sir Julian Corbett, and Adm. Sir Herbert Richmond; their ‘‘navalist’’ successors, Richard Pares and Gerald Graham; military historians, including Stanley Pargellis; and Guy Frégault, who presented a French perspective in 1966. More recently, Fred Anderson, Brendan Simms, and others have addressed North American and European conﬂicts. Eighteenth-century navies and armies have received attention from Nicholas Rodger, Daniel Baugh, Michael Duffy, James Pritchard, Jonathan Dull, John Childs, John Houlding, Alan Guy, Stephen Brumwell, René Chartrand, Ian McCulloch, Marcel Fournier, and Alexander Campbell; David Syrett and Richard Harding have published ﬁne works on amphibious operations. Richard Middleton and Marie Peters both offer valuable perspectives on William Pitt and his direction of the war. John McNeill has placed Louisbourg in the context of France’s Atlantic empire; George Rawlyk has described the 1745 ‘‘Yankee’’ siege of Louisbourg; and while John Johnston has published a ‘‘biography’’ of Louisbourg as a colony, John Grenier has outlined the conﬂict in Nova Scotia. Few, however, have assessed the 1758 events at Louisbourg in a campaign context using English and French sources, both ofﬁcial documents and private journals. The personalities involved thus deserve reappraisal using the wealth of material available now. The Royal Navy’s recordkeeping was excellent—every captain, lieutenant, and ship’s master maintained a journal in a standard format. On land the accounts of General Amherst, his brother Capt. William Amherst, and Lt. William Augustus Gordon; the letters of Maj. Alexander Murray, Lt. the Hon. Henry Hamilton, and, on the French side, the Chevalier de Drucour, Louis Franquet, and Capts. FrancisClaude-Victor Grillot de Poilly, deputy engineer, and François Philibert Morot de Grésigny have proved invaluable; their stories can usually be corroborated. Admiral Boscawen’s daily letters to General Amherst during the siege, now in the Amherst Papers in the Centre for Kentish Studies, provide a wealth of material (unfortunately I could not ﬁnd the replies). Less reliable testimonies, by colorful characters including the spy Thomas Pichon, the renegade Jacobite James Johnstone, Capitaines de Vaisseau de Marolles and de Tourville, and French reports submitted after the defeat, have been checked carefully with other accounts.\n\nxx\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOne source, An Authentic Account of the Reduction of Louisbourg by a Spectator, published soon after the siege, has recently been reprinted in facsimile. The anonymous author mentions being present at the siege but took no part in the action. He acknowledges ‘‘the concurrent Accounts of several Gentlemen’’; similar passages appear elsewhere. J. S. McLennan has identiﬁed the ‘‘spectator’’ as Valentine Neville, purser of HMS Orford in 1758. Neville wrote an epic poem, The Reduction of Louisbourg, in August 1758, published by W. Owen in London at the same time as the Authentic Account. ‘‘Spectator’’ was evidently in Admiral Hardy’s squadron, which included Orford, during the ‘‘close watch.’’ As purser and captain’s secretary, Neville would have had occasional access to ofﬁcers ashore.∫ Campaigns and their commanders should be judged in terms of the aims, ways, and means of the day. This book sets out to describe a campaign in its context, but two areas are covered only in outline. William Pitt’s political career has been well covered by Richard Middleton and Marie Peters. I have attempted only to judge Pitt’s involvement as a war leader from the evidence of 1756–58 and to suggest the lessons he drew from the campaign. The second area of omission concerns campaign funding. It is very difﬁcult to cost military operations even today. In the eighteenth century some accounts relating to military activities were presented or settled a decade or more afterward. There are questions as to whether the relevant servicemen would have been enlisted and their equipment paid for in ‘‘peacetime’’ or just during conﬂict, whether the net additional costs of military operations can be isolated and estimated, how losses and pensions can be evaluated, and how credits from ‘‘prizes and booty,’’ including captured ships, cannon, and military stores, and trade gained and lost affected balance sheets. John Brewer’s The Sinews of Power, James Riley’s The Seven Years War and the Old Regime in France: The Economic and Financial Toll, James Pritchard’s Louis XV’s Navy: A Study of Organization and Administration, Patrick Crowhurst’s The Defence of British Trade, 1689–1815, John McNeill’s Atlantic Empires of France and Spain: Louisbourg and Havana, 1700–63, and David Syrett’s Shipping and Military Power in the Seven Years War: The Sails of Victory are illuminating. The important questions relate to the effectiveness of state ﬁnancial systems and their ability to sustain government and\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nxxi\n\nmilitary operations for extended periods, rather than to the estimation of individual costs. Moreover, although Louisbourg was affected by the corruption endemic in New France’s administration, which so burdened Louis XV’s ministers of la Marine in the 1750s, this did not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the outcome of the 1758 campaign. I have therefore only mentioned it in passing. Louisbourg was partially rebuilt in the 1960s, following an enlightened Canadian government economic-regeneration initiative, and a great resource for interpreting Canada’s past was created while, ironically, numerous derelict Newfoundland Grand Banks ﬁshing schooners rotted on mudﬂats in the River Rance above St. Malo, France. The Fortress of Louisbourg National Historic Site of Canada includes a quarter of the town and its fortiﬁcations, rebuilt to their appearance in 1744, when war between Britain and France was imminent and the town had not been battered by New England siege guns. A short battleﬁeld guide is therefore included (Appendix A) for those wishing to ‘‘walk the ground,’’ the rocky coast and bogs with which the besiegers had to contend.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nM\n\ny original interest in Louisbourg stemmed from Richard Paton’s painting of ‘‘the burning ship’’ (see ﬁgure 1); later I researched the siege for my undergraduate dissertation at the University of Bristol. I have worked on Louisbourg at various times since I ﬁrst started research in 1975, and many people have helped me over the years. I am grateful to the library staffs of the Universities of Bristol and London, House of Commons, National Archives (formerly the Public Record Ofﬁce), National Register of Archives, and Centre for Kentish Studies; and most recently to Louise Clarke, archivist of the Suffolk Record Ofﬁce, Ipswich; Paul Evans, librarian at the Royal Artillery Historical Trust; Eva Major-Marothy, senior curator of the Portrait Gallery of Canada; and Chris Hobson, librarian of the Joint Service Command and Staff College at the Defence Academy, Shrivenham, and his ever-efﬁcient assistant, Sue Barrett. I am also grateful to National Army Museum staff for their assistance over many years. Particular thanks are due to William Reid, the director when I began my research. I have since been assisted by the current director Dr. Alan Guy, David Smurthwaite, Peter Boyden, Philippa Casimir-Mrowczynska, Marion Harding, David Rowland, Jennifer Spencer-Smith, Michael Baldwin, and the late Peter Hayes. Thanks are also due to the staff of the National Maritime Museum’s Caird Library, again over many years, including Alan Pearsall, archivist at the outset of my work, and Roger Knight, the late Edward xxiii\n\nxxiv\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nArchibald, Peter Ince, Pat Blackett-Barker, Elizabeth Wiggans, Gervaise Vaz, and recently Kate Jarvis. As an undergraduate I was particularly grateful for the encouragement given by many people at these institutions. My thanks are due to Prof. John Cannon, who supervised my original dissertation, and to Delia Higgins, Gareth Davies, the late Serena Booker, Jane Affham, and my fellow undergraduates. I am also grateful for advice given by Charles George QC and later by Sir John Keegan and Richard Holmes of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst as well as to various commanding ofﬁcers of the 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards for a few days’ study leave. Historians at the Fortress of Louisbourg National Historic Site Research Centre have given generous assistance. I am most grateful to Gilles Proulx, Eric Krause, Sandy Balcom, and William O’Shea, without whose help and constructive comments I would have found it hard to continue my research. The careful work on the archives by Dilys Francis, Julian Gwyn, Patrick Crowhurst, and others in the 1960s, now lodged in Louisbourg’s Research Centre, was invaluable. Thanks are due also to Michel Wyczynski, senior archivist, Political Archives Section, at the Library and Archives Canada for his help as well as that of his colleagues, including Lorraine Gadoury; Michel wrote a fascinating thesis on Grillot de Poilly and an article on the Cambis Regiment in 1758. Eric Krause has continued Louisbourg research in his retirement, and his ﬁndings, currently available at www.Krausehouse.ca, offer a rich resource to historians. I would like to thank Valentia Grant-Dalton for her generous permission to quote from the letter book of HMS Orford and the Honourable Evelyn Boscawen for kindly allowing me to quote letters sent by Frances (‘‘Fanny’’) Boscawen to her husband, Admiral Boscawen. I would also like to thank the Earl of Albemarle for permission to reproduce extracts from an anonymous letter, now in the Suffolk Record Ofﬁce, describing the siege. Weather data temperatures derived from the Nova Scotia and Bay of Fundy Pilot and the St. Lawrence Pilot are reproduced by permission of the Controller of Her Majesty’s Stationery Ofﬁce and the UK Hydrographic Ofﬁce. The passage from Ronald Hopwood’s poem ‘‘Our Fathers’’ (1913) is used by permission of John Murray (Publishers) Limited. I also wish to thank those who have helped me recently. The list includes, notably, Dr. John Houlding, who has unstintingly given me\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nxxv\n\nwise advice and information on army commissions and who introduced me to Prof. Greg Urwin of Temple University, Pennsylvania. I am also indebted to Profs. Richard Holmes, Nicholas Rodger, and Roger Knight; to Dr. Alan Guy; and to Stephen Wood for their help. I am most grateful to John Gilkes for drawing such ﬁne maps and to Gareth Davies for his ship sketches. My sincere thanks also go to Prof. Peter Foot; René Chartrand; Air Commodore Neville Parton; Mick Crumplin; the late Prof. Colin White; Christopher Eimer; Daniel Marston; Andrew Cormack; Robert Andrews; Prof. Kathleen Wilson; Capt. Malcolm Farrow RN; Maj. Mark Chynoweth; B. BruceBriggs; Shirley Burkett; Philip Winterbottom, deputy head of the Royal Bank of Scotland Archives; James Kochan, who kindly lent me an anonymous siege diary; Eddie Edwards, Worcesters and Sherwood Foresters Museum; Serena Vivian-Neal; David Cox; Lt. Col. Ian McCulloch; Robert Maguire; Frederick Lapham III; Col. Nick Quarrelle of the Royal Artillery Institute; Ian Harte; and Alexander Campbell. I would like to express my gratitude to the staff of the University of Oklahoma Press, who have shown great enthusiasm, courtesy, and professional expertise during the various stages of this book, and notably to Professor Greg Urwin, general editor of the Campaigns & Commanders series, together with Charles Rankin, Alice Stanton, Emmy Ezzell, and their colleagues. I am also indebted to Kevin Brock for his wise advice and hard work in so deftly editing a work on naval and military operations that will be read on both sides of the Atlantic. Thanks are also due to my family. My grandmother, the late Margaret, Dowager Viscountess Falmouth, lent me her notes on Admiral Boscawen. I am grateful to my father, Robert Boscawen, and to my cousin, Evelyn Boscawen, for their assistance. Finally, I would like to pay unreserved tribute to my wife, Alexandra, who read many documents at Louisbourg. She has generously supported the project for a long time and given me valuable encouragement as I reexamined the events of 1758 in Europe and North America.\n\nA Note on Conventions\n\nDates Great Britain adopted the Gregorian calendar, aligning its dates with most European countries, in 1752. From 1700 to 1752, English ‘‘old style’’ (Julian calendar) dates were eleven days behind its continental European counterparts. Dates herein are given in Gregorian style unless otherwise stated.\n\nCurrency The British pound (sterling) comprised twenty shillings of twelve pence (each subdivided into four farthings): sums were rendered as £1 2s 3d or as £1/2/3 until 1971. In 1717 the value of the guinea was ﬁxed at twenty-one shillings. France’s equivalent, the livre (tournois), was an ofﬁcial currency used for accounts; the value of coins, including louis d’or, was linked to the livre by royal edict. The livre was worth around ten or eleven British pence during the period 1730–80s: one pound (sterling) equated to twenty-two to twenty-four livres. The livre was divided into twenty sous, or sols, each of twelve deniers. Various dollars were in use at this time, particularly among troops in North America and Nova Scotia. In 1754 the New York dollar equated to eight shillings (sterling); the Nova Scotia dollar was valued xxvii\n\nxxviii\n\nA NOTE ON CONVENTIONS\n\nat ﬁve shillings (sterling). The commander in chief set the military ‘‘par of exchange’’ in 1754.∞\n\nWeights The French pound (or livre, weight) was about 8 percent heavier than the British pound (or 489.5 grams in one livre compared to 453.5 in one British pound). A quintal was 100 livres; a British hundredweight (cwt) 112 pounds. The French (maritime) ton (tonneau de mer) equated to 2,159 British pounds; the British ton was 2,240 pounds.\n\nMeasures One French foot (pied ) equated to 1.066 British feet, or just over 12.75 inches. A fathom, used to measure depth (and sometimes distance) at sea, equaled 6 British feet.\n\nTitles In Britain, titles in the ‘‘Peerage’’ (duke, marquis, earl, viscount, and baron) were complemented by King James’s creation of baronets in 1611; their titles were similar to knights but hereditary. Baronets are styled, for example, Sir William Pepperrell, Baronet (abbreviated to Bt). The son of a duke, marquis, or earl is styled ‘‘Lord’’ with his or her Christian name and surname as a ‘‘courtesy title’’—for example, Lord George Sackville (son of the Duke of Dorset)—as distinct from an actual peer—for example, Gen. Jeffery Amherst, who was created a baron but known as Lord Amherst and only styled Baron Amherst on formal occasions; it is incorrect to call him Lord Jeffery Amherst. ‘‘The Honourable’’ (abbreviated to ‘‘the Hon.’’) is a courtesy title for the son or daughter of a viscount or baron, as in Adm. the Hon. Edward Boscawen. A nobleman’s wife gained the courtesy title on marriage: thus Frances Glanville became the Hon. Mrs. Edward Boscawen. Captains of His Majesty’s Ships (HMS) were, of course, sea ofﬁcers in the Royal Navy. Some warships maintained by the American Provinces were commanded by Royal Navy ofﬁcers. Such ofﬁcers (and sea ofﬁcers serving ashore) are styled ‘‘RN,’’ as in Capt. John Rous RN of the Massachusetts Province Ship Shirley.\n\nA NOTE ON CONVENTIONS\n\nxxix\n\nShips Ships in the Royal Navy and la Marine were often named after classical ﬁgures, places, or animals or bullish abstract nouns; captured ships often fought for their new owners under their original names. While the abbreviation HMS, for His (or Her) [Britannic] Majesty’s Ship, became commonplace only in the early 1800s, the terms ‘‘HM Ship’’ and ‘‘HM Sloop’’ were widely used in the mid-eighteenth century in ofﬁcial correspondence. In addition, in 1752 Admiral Lord Anson classiﬁed warships into rates according to the numbers of guns mounted. For clarity, therefore, Royal Navy ships will be rendered as HMS Namur 90, the number signifying the guns in their armament (and therefore their rate and size), when they are ﬁrst mentioned; warships in la Marine are set as Prudent 74.\n\nRegiments British army regiments were known by traditional titles (‘‘the Royal Regiment of Foot’’) or their colonel’s name (for example, ‘‘Amherst’s’’) until about 1742, when numeric designations were allocated. The practice of using numbers to describe regiments caught on only slowly, and both the colonel’s name and regimental number were often used, as in Amherst’s 15th [Regiment of] Foot. In 1751 the use of colonels’ names was discouraged, but the practice continued for several decades. Some second battalions of regiments of foot fought at Louisbourg—for example, the Royals, designated herein as 2/1st (2nd Battalion of the 1st or Royal Regiment). Two battalions of the Royal American Regiment, 60th Foot, also served at Louisbourg, and although the names of colonels commandant were often used without numerical designation for these battalions, Monckton’s 2nd and Lawrence’s 3rd battalions are denoted as the ‘‘2/60th’’ and ‘‘3/60th’’ for clarity. County titles for infantry regiments were not introduced until 1782.≤\n\nMaps\n\nS tr\n\nait\n\ns of\n\nBel le I sle\n\nNorth America, 1758\n\nAnticosti Island Isle aux Oeufs\n\nC ha\n\nay rB leu Île Madeleine\n\nIsle St. Jean\n\nR.\n\nMira m i c\n\nQuébec Ottaw aR\n\nTrois Rivières Montréal\n\nt.

Pitt’s portfolio covered southern Europe (including France and Spain), trade, intelligence, colonies, and countries farther aﬁeld, but in practice his primary responsibility was to direct policy for the war with France, later known as the Seven Years’ War in Europe and as the French and Indian War in North America. Within a few weeks, however, Pitt received depressing reports from America regarding the campaigns he had initiated while secretary of state (November 1756– April 1757) in the Duke of Devonshire’s government. News that VAdm. Francis Holburne’s ships had only reached Halifax in mid-July, halfway through the campaigning season, and that they and Lt. Gen. John Campbell, Earl of Loudoun’s troops had not sailed for Louisbourg three weeks later was ominous. Pitt realized that the expedition was unlikely to take the French fortress that year. In mid-August, therefore, Newcastle, Pitt, and other senior ministers discussed the British contributions to the 1758 European and American campaigns: the most signiﬁcant was to be another attempt to seize Louisbourg. The government coalition was led by two talented individuals who tolerated and respected rather than liked each other. Newcastle, competent if not outstanding, had considerable experience of diplomacy and solid support in Parliament through control of patronage and parliamentary seats. Pitt, the ‘‘Great Commoner,’’ offered a 3\n\n4\n\nTHE CAPTURE OF LOUISBOURG, 1758\n\nﬁne intellect, determination, oratory, and ability to inspire public conﬁdence. He lacked foreign-affairs experience, however, and King George II, who disliked him intensely, had dismissed him from ofﬁce only two months earlier. While ambitious and overbearing, Pitt endured poor health, including depression and ailments he called ‘‘gout,’’ which sometimes prevented him from attending to business. He was very conscious of the legacy of two years of failure and the need to produce results: the operations against Louisbourg were extremely important to him politically.∞\n\nBritish Foreign Policy British foreign policy had focused on continental Europe for over a century. In 1688 William of Orange, stadtholder of the Dutch Republic, challenged King Louis XIV of France’s ambitions for European mastery, and when he ascended the English throne as William III alongside his wife Mary in 1689, England joined the struggle. The government’s priority was to balance the interests of the Holy Roman Empire and Bourbon powers—France and Spain—for reasons of security, ‘‘liberty,’’ and Protestantism. Overseas possessions were secondary issues, important for trade, although three-quarters of England’s, later Britain’s, commerce was with Europe until 1780. Some have described the rivalry and conﬂicts of the ‘‘long’’ eighteenth century (1689–1815) as a ‘‘second Hundred Years War’’: Britain was at war with France for just over half that period. Following the victories of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, and his ally, Prince Eugène of Savoy, in the War of the Spanish Succession (or Queen Anne’s War), the new United Kingdom of Great Britain (from 1707) was a major power, its red-coated troops having won respect on European battleﬁelds. The accession of Prince George of Hanover, one of nine Holy Roman Empire electors, to the British throne in 1714 as George I added Hanover and its defense to Britain’s interests, alongside trade and the security of the Spanish, later Austrian, Netherlands and Dutch Republic, potential bases for invading Britain. Protecting Hanover meant committing British troops or hired German soldiers whenever the electorate was threatened, which prompted suspicion in Parliament and the press over the motives and Anglo-Hanoverian policy alignment of George and his son, George II (king, 1727–60), although\n\nWILLIAM PITT AND LOUISBOURG\n\n5\n\nBritain gained continental European inﬂuence and markets from its Hanover connection. George II’s dislike of Pitt, originating in 1736, deepened when Pitt called Hanover a ‘‘despicable electorate’’ in 1742 and opposed sending troops to defend it.≤ Before 1756 Pitt had shown little interest in America—he never visited the colonies—but he knew that European conﬂicts were carried over into the colonies and trading posts that Britain, France, and other powers possessed in the New World, South America, and India, where local as well as national aims inﬂuenced events. As secretary for the Southern Department, he had responsibility for the colonies and appointed ofﬁcials; colonial governors reported to him. Colonial and commercial policy direction, however, was vested in the Board of Trade and Plantations, a Privy Council ‘‘subcommittee’’ lacking political inﬂuence. The president of the board occupied himself with trade issues. George Dunk, Earl of Halifax (president, 1748–61) tried to increase the board’s inﬂuence but only entered the Cabinet Council in 1757. Until then ‘‘the Board of Trade knew everything . . . about the colonies,’’ Fred Anderson suggests, ‘‘but had no power to translate its knowledge into policy. The Secretary of State . . . had executive authority over the colonies but no real knowledge of them, and little reason to inform himself on colonial affairs.’’ The policies and actions of British governments, therefore, often varied from colonial intentions. Ministers, like their French counterparts, sometimes had little idea of realities in territories overseas, and their perspectives were open to distortion and lobbying by, for example, City of London ﬁnanciers more interested in trade and privateering than frontier land disputes.≥ Pitt faced several American issues in 1757. The ﬁrst concerned Louisbourg itself. Under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, which ended the Anglo-French element of the War of the Spanish Succession/Queen Anne’s War, Louis XIV retained New France, centered on Quebec and Montreal, but ceded Newfoundland and southern Acadia (modern Nova Scotia and parts of New Brunswick and northern Maine) to become Nova Scotia. France kept l’Île du Cap Breton—Cape Breton Island—on the western shore of the Cabot Strait, which separates Nova Scotia from Newfoundland; Isle St. Jean (Prince Edward Island); the Gaspé peninsula; and St. Lawrence River. France retained rights to ﬁsh for cod on the Newfoundland Grand Banks but lost the settlements, including Plaisance (Placentia, New-\n\n6\n\nTHE CAPTURE OF LOUISBOURG, 1758\n\nfoundland), that supported its ﬁshing ﬂeets. Having proﬁted greatly from the ﬁsheries, which also provided a ‘‘nursery’’ for training seamen, within a few months French ofﬁcials occupied l’Île du Cap Breton, renaming it Isle Royale, and founded a ﬁshing ‘‘factory,’’ named Louisbourg for Louis XIV, beside the harbor. Versailles directed JeanFrançois de Verville to design defenses for Louisbourg following Marshal Sebastian Le Prestre de Vauban’s system; France’s home naval bases were similarly protected. (The fortress is described in chapter 2.) Despite an inhospitable climate, the factory prospered. Since French transatlantic navigators could ﬁnd Louisbourg reasonably easily (it lay on the same latitude as Rochefort), the port also developed as an entrepôt where cargos were transshipped for carriage through the hazardous waters to Quebec (cabotage) or across the Atlantic or to other colonies.∂ In 1723 Jean-Frédéric Phélypeaux, comte de Maurepas became Ministre de la Marine, responsible for France’s colonies as well as the navy. He suggested to Louis XV’s advisers that Louisbourg could become the barbican defending the St. Lawrence and New France; British expeditions had threatened Quebec in 1690 and 1711. Although Louisbourg could shelter a naval squadron, the Cabot Strait was seventy miles wide, and Maurepas did not base warships in the colony or plan to reinforce it if threatened, nor did he recognize the limitations of an isolated fortress. The perception of Louisbourg’s capability, though ﬂawed, was not challenged until 1745. Louisbourg did not become an international issue until France declared war on Britain in 1744 (War of the Austrian Succession, or King George’s War) when de Maurepas encouraged the governor to commission privateers to seize British merchantmen in North America and the West Indies. An expedition from Louisbourg then seized Canso and attacked Annapolis Royal (Nova Scotia). Objections by merchants in America followed, and Gov. William Shirley of Massachusetts organized an expedition that, supported by a Royal Navy squadron, successfully besieged Louisbourg (April–June 1745).∑ The capture of a European-style fortress by Provincial amateurs spurred the British government to pursue military operations in Europe with renewed vigor. Britain had declared war on Spain in 1739 over trade issues (including the case of Capt. Robert Jenkins, who had lost his ear ﬁghting Spanish coastguards in 1731), but Louisbourg’s capture, one of few British victories during the war, projected\n\nWILLIAM PITT AND LOUISBOURG\n\n7\n\na colonial issue into European considerations. This rare occurrence was reﬂected in 1748, when France exchanged Louisbourg for evacuation of the Low Countries under the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, an event of great signiﬁcance to the security of Britain, the Dutch Republic, Hanover, and Britain’s ally, Austria; France also returned the trading post at Madras, India. The treaty nonetheless provoked outrage and feelings of betrayal in America, the House of Commons, and British press.∏ By contrast to Isle Royale, Britain invested little in nearby Nova Scotia during the thirty-ﬁve years after the capture of Port Royal (1710) and the ceding of Acadia. Annapolis Royal was established but remained underdeveloped. Successive Nova Scotia governors tried to persuade the largely neutral French Acadian population to swear allegiance to the British Crown, fought off Maliseet (St. John River valley) and Mi’kmaw (Nova Scotia and Isle Royale) Indian raids, and resisted occasional interference from the loose Wabenaki Confederacy (Abenaki Indians from northern Maine and Acadia with the Maliseet and Mi’kmaw nations) in the 1740s. In 1749, however, prompted by French use in 1746 of the great harbor of Chebucto, Nova Scotia, Col. the Hon. Edward Cornwallis founded a settlement on that site, naming it for Lord Halifax, president of the Board of Trade; the British garrison from Louisbourg arrived shortly afterward. Britain now had a sheltered anchorage, if little more, to support operations in the area. In 1750, British troops built Fort Lawrence at Beaubassin in northern Nova Scotia; France responded with Fort Beauséjour across the nearby border and a blockhouse at Gaspéreau on Baie Verte in the Northumberland Strait. When Fr. Jean-Louis Le Loutre again encouraged Maliseets and Mi’kmaqs to attack settlements in 1754, the British government took a ﬁrmer line against the disruptive elements.π The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle left many issues unresolved, including the conﬂicting claims to the Ohio country. From 1748 to 1755 an armed truce existed in the area south of the Great Lakes and upper St. Lawrence and west of the Allegheny (central Appalachian) Mountains. French ambitions to link their Canadian settlements to the Mississippi River and Louisiana via the Ohio River reemerged: the prospect of penning British provinces behind the Appalachians was attractive too. Benjamin Franklin echoed British American sentiments, however, when he asserted that the colonies should have ‘‘room enough’’ to support their fast-expanding populations. Penn-\n\n8\n\nTHE CAPTURE OF LOUISBOURG, 1758\n\nsylvanian and Virginian aspirations to establish trading posts where the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers meet at the ‘‘Forks of the Ohio’’ were countered by Ange Duquesne de Menneville, marquis Duquesne, New France’s expansionist governor general (1752–55), who built four ‘‘defensive’’ forts between Lake Erie and the Forks, the southernmost named for himself. This signaled a policy of confrontation: little consideration was given to reactions in the colonies, London, Paris, or among the Iroquois Confederacy—the political union of the Iroquois Six Nations—which claimed the area as hunting grounds and held the balance of power there at the time.∫ In 1754 the British government directed Provincial governors to use force to counter French and Indian encroachments on the frontiers, which led to Maj. George Washington’s Virginia militiamen skirmishing with Troupes de la Marine in the Ohio country and his defeat at Great Meadows (Fort Necessity) in July 1754. News of Washington’s surrender reached Britain two months later and eclipsed diplomacy relating to the Holy Roman Empire. Distrust and trade rivalry were affecting relations between Britain and France in Europe, and ﬁghting in Ohio could not be ignored in London or Paris. If France reacted by sending troops to New France, they could only arrive via the St. Lawrence, and Louisbourg would be pivotal. That in turn might reawaken the outcry in America and Britain—Pitt’s voice had been prominent in this—against Isle Royale’s return in 1749 and provoke calls for action against the fortress.Ω The Duke of Newcastle regarded France as an inveterate rival, if not an inevitable enemy, and was wary of French intentions in Europe and America. Henry Fox, the hawkish ‘‘secretary at war,’’ and the Duke of Cumberland, captain general of the army, shaped Britain’s response to Washington’s defeat. In late 1754 they persuaded the cabinet to send two regular regiments to America under an ambitious plan to secure the safety of navigation and commerce, the colonies, and territories claimed by the Crown, including the Ohio country. This action might escalate the crisis, but there was no apparent intention then to seize territory or create an ‘‘empire,’’ a term usually applied to the Holy Roman Empire. Cumberland selected Maj. Gen. Edward Braddock to be commander in chief in North America and directed him to seize Fort Duquesne, while Gov. William Shirley, as a regular major general, attacked Fort Niagara near the portage between Lakes Ontario and\n\nWILLIAM PITT AND LOUISBOURG\n\n9\n\nErie. At the same time Maj. Gen. William Johnson would lead troops north from the New York frontier to destroy Fort St. Frédéric (Crown Point) on Lake Champlain, while Lt. Col. Robert Monckton seized Fort Beauséjour on the Nova Scotia border, thus resolving the main Anglo-French disputes in North America in a clean sweep. Shirley and Sir William Pepperrell had raised regular regiments in America in 1745 and were again asked to recruit troops. Henry Fox destroyed the hope that regiments could be dispatched as a low-key signal to Versailles when, to Newcastle’s fury, he announced related issues in the London Gazette.∞≠ France’s secretary of state for war, the comte d’Argenson, soon after organized reinforcements for New France in response, while Louis’ diplomats opened negotiations with Austria in order to undermine Newcastle’s ‘‘system’’ of European alliances. Early in 1755 Adm. Emmanuel-August de Cahideuc, comte du Bois de La Motte ﬁtted out fourteen ships to transport 3,650 troops to America. When reports reached Britain, many, including Pitt, then paymaster general to the forces (a junior government post), called for action. Royal Navy guard ships were ordered to ﬁt for sea, and George II informed the House of Commons that he had ordered increases in the strength of the army and navy.∞∞ In April 1755 Newcastle’s cabinet ordered VAdm. Edward Boscawen, with ten ships of the line, to intercept de La Motte off Nova Scotia; he was to do his best to take possession of the French ships or, if necessary, capture and destroy them. Part of Boscawen’s ﬂeet encountered three French ships off Newfoundland on 7 June and captured two, Alcide 64 and Lys 64. The Earl of Hardwicke, lord chancellor (head of the judiciary), who was keenly interested in foreign policy, commented, ‘‘we have done either too much or too little.’’ Louis XV recalled his London ambassador but, needing time for diplomacy and mobilization, did not declare war.∞≤ Mixed results followed. Braddock organized and trained his troops to ﬁght in the American backwoods, but lacking Indian scouts and local intelligence, they encountered French troops and Indian warriors beside the Monongahela River near Fort Duquesne on 9 July 1755, and a confused, three-hour ‘‘meeting engagement’’ ensued. Once Braddock was wounded, his troops, reduced two-thirds by casualties, retreated. British plans had been seriously ﬂawed: ‘‘it is notorious,’’ Stanley Pargellis has written, ‘‘that Great Britain undertook\n\n10\n\nTHE CAPTURE OF LOUISBOURG, 1758\n\nan offensive war for which she was utterly unprepared and which she did not understand.’’ Pitt’s scathing criticism of Newcastle’s government led to his dismissal, but he was to inherit the legacy of its misjudgments.∞≥ Britain did, however, achieve some successes. General Johnson and Provincial troops defeated the baron de Dieskau’s French and Indian force near Lake George on 8 September. Five hundred miles northeast, Capt. John Rous RN and Lieutenant Colonel Monckton, with a mixed regular and Provincial force, took Fort Beauséjour after a short siege in June; Monckton renamed it Fort Cumberland. Farther east, Fort Gaspéreau surrendered without a ﬁght. British impatience at the Acadians’ refusal to swear allegiance and abandon support for French aggression contributed to the decision to deport over 6,000 Acadians to Quebec, France, Britain, and the colonies. La guerre sauvage—the war of the savage—in which both sides ignored the conventions of European warfare, may have inﬂuenced events, but this large-scale deportation—le Grand Dérangement—was shocking. Signiﬁcantly, it meant that by 1756 Isle Royale had lost an important source of food as well as her neutral western ﬂank, although many Acadians evaded capture and fought a guerrilla campaign for another ﬁve years.∞∂ Across the Atlantic, meanwhile, the Royal Navy waged undeclared war on French shipping in the Western Approaches, seizing about 350 vessels and 7,500 seamen (15 percent of those registered for naval service) in six months while la Marine tried to mobilize. At Versailles Louis XV’s Conseil d’État (council of state) believed that their ﬂeets could not defeat the Royal Navy and therefore resolved to threaten British security by again occupying Hanover and the Austrian Netherlands. Louis’ diplomacy then delivered a notable success. In January 1756 George II and his nephew Frederick of Prussia signed the Convention of Westminster to preserve peace in the empire and safeguard Hanover. Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria was furious that the convention failed to guarantee the neutrality of the Austrian Netherlands. Resentful of Frederick’s continuing occupation of Silesia (southwest Poland), she abandoned the longstanding Anglo-Austrian alliance and concluded the (ﬁrst) Treaty of Versailles with Louis XV on 1 May 1756. This reversal of alliances followed a rapprochement between Vienna and Empress Elizabeth of Russia, who joined the Franco-Austrian entente, as did Sweden, an important source of naval\n\nWILLIAM PITT AND LOUISBOURG\n\n11\n\nsupplies. France, Austria, imperial territories (including Saxony), Russia, and Sweden now confronted Frederick of Prussia, whose only allies were Hanover, Britain, and a few German states.∞∑ France moved troops to her northern coast to ‘‘threaten’’ an invasion of Britain in 1756 before launching a counterstroke in the Mediterranean in mid-April. Adm. Roland-Michel Barrin, marquis de La Galissonière and Marshal Louis-Armand du Plessis, duc de Richelieu landed on British-held Minorca and besieged Fort St. Philip above the Port Mahon naval base. On 18 May France declared war. Two days later the hastily dispatched VAdm. the Hon. John Byng failed to drive off the French ﬂeet and raise the siege; Gen. William Blakeney and the garrison held out for seventy days before surrendering. The outcry in Britain was immense. ‘‘We have provoked before we can defend,’’ Pitt thundered in the House of Commons, ‘‘we have neglected after provocation, and in every quarter of the world we are inferior to France.’’ Newcastle, sensitive to another defeat, this time at sea and in Europe, was determined that Byng should be court-martialed. Disaster followed at Calcutta in June where forty-eight Europeans suffocated in the infamous ‘‘Black Hole,’’ though this had less consequence in Britain than the Minorca defeat. In New France Louis-Joseph, marquis de Montcalm-Gozon de Saint-Véran, Dieskau’s successor, attacked Fort Oswego beside Lake Ontario in August. Montcalm refused to offer the garrison the honors of war after a resistance lasting only two days and made the defenders prisoners of war. Worse still, Indian warriors killed or kidnapped up to one hundred British and Provincial captives immediately afterward.∞∏ Newcastle’s government collapsed in November 1756. The Duke of Devonshire formed a new government, and Pitt took ofﬁce in an inexperienced administration that lacked support in Parliament. Although he ostensibly rejected Newcastle’s European-focused foreign policy, Pitt had recently conﬁded to Lord Hardwicke his support for the maritime and colonial war in America and, signiﬁcantly, for the defense of the Hanover if it was attacked on account of its links with Britain. In late 1756, therefore, as secretary of state, Pitt envisaged diplomatic action and subsidies for Frederick II in continental Europe and a diversionary raid on the French coast (at Frederick’s suggestion). He declared that the war in America was his ﬁrst priority, and Lord Loudoun, the new commander in chief, planned two offensives with 17,000 regulars. Maj. Gen. Daniel Webb would advance north from\n\n12\n\nTHE CAPTURE OF LOUISBOURG, 1758\n\nAlbany, establishing a position at the northern end of Lake George, and besiege Fort Carillon (Ticonderoga) if possible. Loudoun himself, with most of the regulars, would undertake the main offensive against Quebec. Neither Cumberland nor Loudoun, however, fully appreciated the capabilities and limitations of naval power. Pitt maintained that any Quebec expedition should not bypass Louisbourg, which lay too close to the St. Lawrence to be ignored, and as Admiral Boscawen’s recent experience showed, operations in those waters offered no guarantees. Loudoun agreed to attack Louisbourg. Events soon rocked the administration, however. A court-martial in December 1756 found Admiral Byng guilty of ‘‘failing to do his utmost to take or destroy the enemy’s ships’’ off Minorca and awarded him the recently mandated death sentence for this offence. Pitt inclined toward mercy, though some of his supporters did not; public clamor was loud but divided. The king rejected the clemency plea submitted by Richard, Earl Temple, ﬁrst lord of the Admiralty, and Byng was shot on his own quarterdeck in March 1757, witnessed by Admiral Holburne’s ships as they prepared to sail for Louisbourg. Separately, in March George II pressed Cumberland to accept command of the Hessian-Hanoverian ‘‘Army of Observation’’ intended to guard Hanover against a French attack. Cumberland, whose parliamentary supporters were managed by Henry Fox, Pitt’s rival, accepted on condition that he did not have to take orders from Pitt, then secretary of state. George II dismissed Pitt and Temple from ofﬁce in April 1757, but Fox was unable to form an administration. For three months Britain had no effective government.∞π\n\nGovernments and Colonies, Navies, and Armies: Great Britain In June 1757 the Duke of Newcastle led his government as ﬁrst lord of the Treasury, as was becoming customary, and conducted business through a Cabinet Council of ten ministers. The smaller Secret Committee of the Privy Council discussed secret or sensitive issues: membership included the ﬁrst lord of the Treasury, lord chancellor, secretaries of state—the Northern Department secretary of state handled domestic issues and relations with northern Europe—ﬁrst lord of the Admiralty, captain general of the army (Cumberland from 1754 to 1757), and (from late 1757) the army’s commander in chief. From the early 1700s, secretaries of state (generally the Southern Department\n\nWILLIAM PITT AND LOUISBOURG\n\n13\n\nsecretary) had been responsible for planning naval and military operations, assisted by the Admiralty and military ofﬁcers. Secretaries of state drafted instructions for the monarch to sign following Secret Committee deliberations and issued instructions to commanders for reasons of operational security; the Admiralty and War Ofﬁce then added amplifying orders.∞∫ In mid-July 1757 the Secret Committee, including Pitt, rejected Frederick II’s requests for British troops in the Army of Observation and a Royal Navy squadron in the Baltic, but the committee accepted the idea of a raid on the naval base at Rochefort in order to divert troops from Germany, which Pitt had considered the previous December. Lord Hardwicke, who had resigned as lord chancellor in 1756, returned to the cabinet and Secret Committee to advise on foreign affairs. Hardwicke contrived the reappointment of Admiral George, Lord Anson, his son-in-law, dismissed in November1756, as ﬁrst lord of the Admiralty. Although Newcastle and Pitt initially distrusted Anson due to the 1755–56 naval failures, they soon came to respect his professional advice; he was a popular hero following his 1740–44 circumnavigation. The Secret Committee discussed Rochefort on 15 July, and although Pitt was regarded as the architect of the raid—it was very much ‘‘his’’ operation and leaked to the public as such—the capable Gen. Sir John Ligonier, lieutenant general of the ordnance, did much of the detailed planning. On 8 September Adm. Sir Edward Hawke sailed for Rochefort with a sizeable ﬂeet and over 7,000 troops commanded by Lt. Gen. Sir John Mordaunt.∞Ω When Pitt heard in September of the delay to Admiral Holburne and Lord Loudoun’s Louisbourg expedition, the Secret Committee capitalized on previous discussions and agreed the broad campaign priorities for 1758 in Europe, which were overall largely defensive, and America (these are described in chapter 3). On 21 September Lord Anson wrote to Holburne directing him to leave eight ships to winter in Halifax, the ﬁrst innovation in military plans over which Pitt presided. The Royal Navy The Royal Navy provided Great Britain’s ﬁrst line of defense against invasion—France lay only a few hours sail across the English Channel—and protected its overseas possessions and trade. While the navy also supported troops in continental Europe and protected trade\n\n14\n\nTHE CAPTURE OF LOUISBOURG, 1758\n\nin the Channel, invasion threats in 1744–46, 1756, 1757, and 1759 dominated public attention, tied down warships, and sometimes allowed la Marine to seize the initiative (as at Minorca), thus imposing limitations on the navy’s available strength.≤≠ Since 1744, however, Adms. Edward Vernon and Lord Anson had been developing the concept of a squadron in the Western Approaches (or ‘‘the Soundings’’) to watch French bases at Brest and Rochefort and to prevent ships from Mediterranean ports joining invasion attempts. Known as the Western Squadron, these warships also harassed French merchant shipping, including vessels bound for New France. The concept grew from a ‘‘watch’’ on ports (vessels able to alert supporting squadrons if enemy ships emerged) to a ‘‘close watch’’ (involving more warships that would engage enemy vessels), though neither were fully effective in preventing French ships from sailing; the stronger concept of ‘‘blockade’’ dates from Admiral Hawke in 1759. Advances in preserving provisions—and thus seamen’s health—and dockyard capabilities allowed warships to stay at sea longer and made such operations practicable. Close watch, wherever it was undertaken, demanded signiﬁcant endurance from ships’ companies and a supply system; squadrons also needed bases at a reasonable distance for reﬁts. In Nova Scotia, Halifax provided a base for British ships watching Louisbourg. In February 1758 Pitt could call on a Royal Navy of 102 ships of the line and 151 smaller warships in commission manned by 72,713 ofﬁcers and seamen. The Western Squadron comprised about 20 percent of the ﬂeet; thirty vessels (12 percent) were on Home Service or in the Downs, off southeastern Britain, where merchantmen awaited winds for sailing into either the Thames or English Channel. With the ﬂeet mobilized, about 9 percent of the navy was in the Mediterranean while 16 percent cruised the Caribbean ‘‘Plantations’’ (colonies) protecting trade. Six frigates (‘‘station ships’’) were assigned to the American colonies for commerce protection, supported by Provincefunded warships, often commanded by Royal Navy sea ofﬁcers. Eight ships and three frigates (4 percent) were in the East Indies. Signiﬁcant battleﬂeets could be deployed in addition: Admiral Boscawen commanded twenty-one ships and twenty-one frigates and smaller vessels, or 17 percent of the navy, at Louisbourg. Nevertheless, twothirds of the ﬂeet were usually in the Soundings or in Mediterranean waters; watching mainland French bases enabled success overseas.≤∞\n\nWILLIAM PITT AND LOUISBOURG\n\n15\n\nThe Admiralty Board provided political representation and direction for the navy. Admiral Anson was ﬁrst commissioner, or ‘‘ﬁrst lord,’’ from 1751 to 1756 and from 1757 to 1762. Six junior lords, one usually an experienced ﬂag ofﬁcer—Admiral Boscawen was a lord of the Admiralty from 1751 to 1761—formed the board, which was administered by the secretary, a post John Clevland ﬁlled from 1751 to 1763. Three nominally subordinate boards supported the Admiralty: the Navy Board (responsible for ship design, building and repair, dockyards, wage payments, and chartering transport shipping), the Victualling Board, and the Sick and Hurt Board. The Board of Ordnance, which reported to the master general of the ordnance rather than the Admiralty, supplied guns and ordnance stores to the navy and the army.≤≤ The Royal Dockyards employed about 10,000 people in the 1750s and carried out ship maintenance mostly at Portsmouth and Plymouth. When ‘‘three hours of battle or thirty of tempest’’ might lead to three months in the dockyard, the Navy Board provided an effective system to support the ﬂeet. British ships were designed to keep at sea for extended periods and were better constructed than French vessels, but changes to conservative designs occurred when the Duke of Bedford was ﬁrst lord (1744–48): prizes from the ﬁrst battle of Cape Finisterre in 1747, including the French Invincible 74, which carried larger cannon than similar British ships, prompted much comment. By 1755 fourth-rate 50-gun ships were no longer regarded as ‘‘line of battle ships’’—they were too small to ﬁght the 64and 74-gun ships then entering service—though they were used as such overseas.≤≥ During the 1744–48 war, the Royal Navy also captured some useful smaller prizes. Capt. Edward Boscawen took Medée, France’s newest frigate, in 1744. The lines of the fast French privateer Tygre were later copied for HMS Unicorn, HMS Lyme, and twenty frigates of the 28-gun Coventry class in the 1750s. Three of Boscawen’s Coventry-class vessels at Louisbourg—Boreas, Shannon, and Trent— were built of ﬁr rather than oak; these cheap, ‘‘hostilities only’’ warships proved their worth.≤∂ In 1750, however, two-thirds of the navy’s ships were suffering from wood rot, which the Admiralty successfully concealed from Parliament. Ships generally lasted twelve to sixteen years before requiring major reﬁts, and after rebuilding they could last sixty years or\n\n16\n\nTHE CAPTURE OF LOUISBOURG, 1758\n\nmore. In the 1740s, however, ships were needing reﬁts after eight years, probably due to the exceptionally warm weather of the 1730s affecting the seasoning of timber. John, Earl of Sandwich (ﬁrst lord, 1748–51) and then Anson managed the problem carefully, matching French shipbuilding in the 1750s. When war approached, construction was increased by commissioning vessels from private yards as well as the Royal Dockyards. Anson judged that the navy could only mobilize ﬁfty ships in the ﬁrst year of a war; in 1755 the Navy Board listed exactly ﬁfty ships ‘‘ﬁt for service.’’ In 1758 twelve of the twenty-one ships and eight of the fourteen 50-gun ships and frigates in Admiral Boscawen’s ﬂeet were ten years old or less, testament to Anson’s careful management. Five of Boscawen’s ships and eight frigates were two years old or less, and four ships and two frigates had been built or reﬁtted during the period 1749–54; four ships, one frigate, and two reﬁtted ships dated from 1744–48. Timber for spars was as important, however, as ‘‘compass timber’’ for frames. The Royal Navy procured pitch pine from Baltic states and later New Hampshire and Nova Scotia; la Marine often had inferior spar timber.≤∑ Overall, the Royal Navy derived strength from sea time, gaining worked-up performance as ships’ companies and squadrons, and experiencing all weathers and types of action. In 1758 it had experienced, professional ofﬁcers largely promoted on merit; reasonably new ships; good seamanship and gunnery skills; improving shipboard hygiene, health, and diet; and a dockyard system. Many sea ofﬁcers who patrolled North American waters during King George’s War served there again in the 1750s. The navy nonetheless relied on individual ﬂag ofﬁcers for operational development rather than a central body; Vernon, Anson, Hawke, and Boscawen all helped develop the ‘‘close watch’’ and moreﬂexible tactics than those in the doctrinal ‘‘Fighting Instructions.’’ This policy by default of talented individualism led to an ethos Nelson later summarized as ‘‘in case Signals can neither be seen or perfectly understood, no Captain can do very wrong if he places his Ship alongside that of an Enemy.’’ A positive, ﬁghting service with some devolved decision making resulted, but the emphasis lay more on ship handling than ﬂeet evolutions. The navy’s performance during the periods 1739–48 and 1755–57 was often lackluster, however, partly due to the selection system for senior commanders. Following\n\nWILLIAM PITT AND LOUISBOURG\n\n17\n\nthe Minorca action, Admiral Byng was convicted of ‘‘failing to do his utmost’’; Voltaire’s comment, ‘‘in [Great Britain] it is thought good to kill an admiral from time to time, to give courage to the others,’’ was apposite and may indeed have had a salutary effect on the navy’s ofﬁcers.≤∏ The British Army The army was structured very differently to the navy. Many believed that standing armies were a threat to liberty or recalled with horror the slaughter at Malplaquet (1709). Following wars, governments often reduced regiments to near-cadre strength or disbanded them: the army, 40,000 strong in 1748, shrank to 8,000 men by 1751, although in 1758 about 88,370 regular troops were on the payroll. Regiments of marching foot (infantry) based in Britain generally had one battalion and were funded (‘‘established’’) for 1,000 soldiers and about thirty commissioned ofﬁcers in ten companies. Several regiments and some independent companies were stationed in Ireland and overseas; while on the Irish ‘‘Establishment’’ (with 360 men per battalion) and in the colonies, units were hidden from the Westminster Parliament’s scrutiny.≤π The army inherited leadership, discipline, tactical innovation, and a pay system from Gen. Thomas Fairfax’s 1640s ‘‘New Model Army’’ and gained campaign experience and skilled infantry in the wars after 1689. Parliament assigned the king the authority for the promotion of ofﬁcers, although secretaries of state recommended some appointments. Both George I and II, experienced soldier-kings, took a close interest in promotions and exercised their prerogative to appoint commanders. From 1745 to 1757, George II’s son, the Duke of Cumberland, captain general and a distinguished army reformer, inﬂuenced appointments. Purchase of commissions was the norm, except in ‘‘scientiﬁc corps’’—artillery and engineers—though around a third of vacancies were ﬁlled without purchase, particularly on operations. Colonels controlled commissions in their regiments; with inspections, it was not in their interest to allow incompetents to command. They and their civilian agents managed the ﬁnancial administration of regiments. Long-service professional ofﬁcers and noncommissioned ofﬁcers maintained the army’s effectiveness. In 1759, captains commanding companies of marching foot had on average ten years’ service and their battalion commanders seventeen\n\n18\n\nTHE CAPTURE OF LOUISBOURG, 1758\n\nyears, ﬁgures close to British army norms 250 years later. Nevertheless, rather than a cohesive, centrally directed force, the army at home—in Britain and Ireland—resembled a collection of individual regiments comprising full-time professional soldiers run by proprietary ofﬁcers who received public money for clothing, weapons, equipment, and subsistence for soldiers.≤∫ Since no police force existed, the army at home was routinely employed in peace and wartime ‘‘in aid of the Civil Power’’ against affray in the countryside and towns as well as coastal smugglers. During such duties, cavalry and infantry regiments were split into squadrons and companies, even sometimes into small, local detachments, but the army had the leadership and discipline that allowed this fragmentation of units with a low risk of desertion.≤Ω In the 1750s Cumberland standardized training with his 1748 ‘‘Regulations.’’ Troops practiced basic drills wherever they were and, in England, regularly encamped so that regiments could train together, particularly before overseas deployments. Senior ofﬁcers inspected regiments in camp on the king’s behalf. Military handbooks complemented these regulations: Lt. Gen. Humphrey Bland’s Treatise of Military Discipline was reprinted frequently after 1727, while Capt. Thomas Binning’s 1708 publication, A Light to the Art of Gunnery, was reissued in 1744. Handbooks covered drills and administration rather than leadership, tactics, and campaigning, but professional treatises were published too.≥≠ In North America, including Nova Scotia, regiments and companies were often dispersed in garrisons. Service on the frontiers provided operational experience, but lack of initiative, basic diets, sickness, and limited opportunities to train above company level imposed limitations on their effectiveness. Raising regular regiments in America met mixed success: the 62nd (later 60th) Royal American Regiment, recruited in New York and Pennsylvania in 1755, succeeded due to some exceptional ofﬁcers, but Shirley’s 50th and Pepperrell’s 51st Foot were unable to train so well before being attacked at Fort Oswego in 1756. Leadership as well as training counted during operations. Good leaders could, the Duke of Wellington said later, win battles even with ‘‘the mere scum of the earth’’ enlisted for drink. The inference, perhaps following Gillray’s 1790s lampoons, that the army comprised\n\nWILLIAM PITT AND LOUISBOURG\n\n19\n\nmarionettes led by donkeys or martinets who swindled their men does not stand up to scrutiny. Regiments serving in the ‘‘American Army’’ in the 1750s (covered in chapter 6) provide a good case study. When ordered overseas, regiments recruited soldiers and received drafts from other regiments; they also attracted many American-born recruits, who formed 30–40 percent of their strength by 1763. Regular troops, when trained and led by ofﬁcers like John Forbes, Henry Bouquet, John Bradstreet, George Scott, Alexander Murray, and James Wolfe, adapted well to ‘‘backwoods’’ conditions. Commanders studied French and Indian tactics, adjusted training and uniforms, and showed a commendable ability to analyze performance and apply lessons; they also created good supply and medical organizations. From 1757, regular regiments in America were supported by large numbers of Provincials on lines of communication and specialized tasks, including ‘‘ranging and wood service’’—patrolling and ﬁghting in hilly, wooded terrain. ‘‘Light infantry’’ companies were raised and also learned ‘‘ranger’’ skills. There was plenty of incentive: the price of tactical failure was not imprisonment and exchange as in Europe but scalping, torture, or enslavement by Indians—or a ransom if very lucky. Dr. Samuel Johnson’s judgment, ‘‘depend upon it, sir, when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully,’’ applied as much to British troops as anyone: they needed little inducement to improve their skills in America.≥∞ Was the army available to Pitt (formerly a junior ofﬁcer in Cobham’s 2nd Dragoons) ‘‘ﬁt for service’’? A small War Ofﬁce existed but had no staff for army development, yet systems for regulating training and inspections existed, as did processes for staffwork in the ﬁeld, where orders were issued through majors of brigade. These systems often failed to reach frontier garrisons, however. The army’s structure, peacetime size, and training constraints militated against continuous effectiveness, but its campaign record in America (and Germany) suggests that it had the professional ofﬁcers who could train it, over time, for success against both regular troops and irregulars in close country. The attitude maintained by some that European methods would invariably prevail and that Provincial ofﬁcers’ opinions could be ignored remained, however, and led to setbacks, some serious, between 1755 and 1764—and again after 1775.\n\n20\n\nTHE CAPTURE OF LOUISBOURG, 1758\n\nGovernments and Colonies, Armies and Navies: France Two monarchs of extraordinary longevity dominated French political life for much of the eighteenth century. Louis XIV died in 1715 after a ﬁfty-ﬁve-year reign; Louis XV had ruled for nearly twenty years when Louisbourg was attacked in 1745. Louis XV adopted his greatgrandfather’s absolute system, but despite intelligence and judgment, he lacked self-conﬁdence and was unassertive. His colonial policies were based as much on prestige as on economic or military considerations; their inconsistencies sometimes sealed the fate of overseas possessions.≥≤ Ministers of state discussed government issues and foreign affairs in Louis XV’s council of state. Secretaries of state headed government departments and wielded effective power but were not always members of the council. After 1743 Louis coordinated policy with individual secretaries—decisions depended on their relations with the king, and government policy became fragmented. Departments suffered from lack of money: France’s Achilles heel lay in its inability to harness its economic resources effectively. Taxation was inequitable and avoided by many. The government could raise loans, but at higher interest rates than in Britain. France enjoyed modest economic growth in the 1750s, but the decision in 1755–56 to fund the war with loans and credit had far-reaching consequences. Louis was interested in foreign affairs, but his use of personal agents, the ‘‘secret du Roi,’’ meant that secretaries of state were sometimes confused by inconsistent policies and priorities. Louis XIV had striven to develop France’s power through dynastic alliances, but Louis XV had to contend with emerging European powers: the Russia of Peter the Great and his daughter, Elizabeth Petrovna (empress, 1741–61), and Prussia of Frederick William I and Frederick II (king, 1740–86), who by 1763 was challenging Austria for leadership of the German states. European developments inﬂuenced French actions in its colonies. While settlements were well established in America, the West Indies, and India and trade was increasing signiﬁcantly by midcentury, French colonies and commerce took second place to European issues. New France’s population was small, 65,000 in 1760, mostly soldiers, traders, and ofﬁcials, while at this time the island of Martinique alone had 17,000 free men and 57,000 slaves. Louisbourg,\n\nWILLIAM PITT AND LOUISBOURG\n\n21\n\nimportant for the ﬁsheries and trade, cost more to maintain and defend than it earned. Ten percent of France’s total spending on colonies was devoted to Isle Royale in the 1720s; this doubled by the 1740s. Although overseas trade grew from 40 million livres in 1716 to 204 million in 1756, Louisbourg’s annual cod exports in 1750 were only worth about 3 million livres, which with cabotage, worth another 3 million, represented only 3 percent of French trade receipts. West Indies sugar, by contrast, accounted for 20 percent of France’s trade in the period 1700–50.≥≥ The French Army France’s professional army, created by Louis XIV in the 1660s, was preeminent in defending the kingdom’s military interests. The secretary for war was inﬂuential in the council of state but constrained by vested interests, and the army suffered from a rapid turnover in ministers in mid-century. Marc-Pierre de Voyer, comte d’Argenson (minister, 1743–57) was replaced by his lightweight nephew, Marc-René de Voyer, marquis de Paulmy. During this time, power lay with Marshals de Belleisle and d’Estrées and the ﬁnancier Pâris du Verney. De Belleisle succeeded de Paulmy in March 1758; a distinguished soldier, he proved an indifferent minister. Frederick II’s impetus in the 1740s led to land warfare becoming more mobile. French foot soldiers, Marshal Maurice de Saxe noted, lacked the discipline, ﬁrepower, and mobility of Prussian and British infantry. While de Saxe defeated a combined British, Hanoverian, Austrian, and Dutch army at Fontenoy in 1745, French continental armies failed to win any other important battles until Valmy (1792). By 1756 the army ‘‘was but a shadow of its former self.’’ Commanders occasionally refused to support each other: ‘‘the camp like the Court,’’ one ofﬁcer wrote, was ‘‘full of intrigues, jealousies and bad faith’’—not a sound basis for high morale. French engineers, experts in siege warfare and fortiﬁcation, were widely respected, but the French artillery corps, linked to the engineers from 1755–58, was unimpressive.≥∂ Four types of French troops would ﬁght at Louisbourg in 1758. The garrison included Compagnies Franches (Troupes) de la Marine, long-service regulars recruited in France with ofﬁcers mostly from the colonies, who served in independent companies either aboard ship or in the colonies: both types were represented at Louis-\n\n22\n\nTHE CAPTURE OF LOUISBOURG, 1758\n\nbourg. The Compagnies Franches learned ﬁeld craft, movement skills, and tactics from their Indian allies. The regular Troupes de Terre comprised regiments with between one and four battalions, each of 31–36 ofﬁcers and 525–685 rank and ﬁle; battalions had a grenadier company and 12–16 fusilier companies around forty strong. Battalions of the Artois and Bourgogne Regiments arrived at Louisbourg in 1755: the 2nd Battalion, Cambis Regiment reached the fortress just before the siege. Troupes de Terre were trained in Europeanstyle maneuver and the defense of fortiﬁcations. The Volontaires Etrangers, part of France’s corps of foreign troops, many of them German speaking, formed the third element. Finally, militiamen—les Volontaires Bourgeois—also fought at Louisbourg. Militia service was well established in the St. Lawrence valley, and militiamen often made tough and capable troops: Isle Royale militia, however, had less training. French irregulars and their Mi’kmaw allies, led by Capt. Charles Deschamps de Boishébert, also played a role at Louisbourg during the siege.≥∑ Some Troupes de Terre commanders had experience of ﬁghting European irregulars—croats, pandours, and hussars—and, like the Compagnies Franches, were open-minded about their methods. In America French ofﬁcers understood the need for proﬁciency in both European warfare and Indian-style raiding, the latter based partly on terror tactics, including scalping and torture. Various ofﬁcers, including Pierre de Rigaud, marquis de Vaudreuil de Cavagnial (governor general, 1755–60), a Compagnies Franches ofﬁcer, encouraged la guerre sauvage. Links with Indian allies, based on cultural relationships and inducements, made a combination that British and Provincial troops often found hard to defeat. Others, notably de Montcalm, opposed la guerre sauvage as uncivilized and unacceptable. The war of the savage hardened attitudes among British and Provincial ofﬁcers and politicians. A corrosive ‘‘Indian hating’’ phenomenon grew despite efforts by Europeans like William Johnson, British superintendent of Indian affairs, who traded with and lived alongside American natives. Counterterror tactics—scalping by Provincials and British regulars—and reprisals followed. Indian hating had consequences for surrendering troops, including Louisbourg’s garrison, and contributed to a serious revolt, Pontiac’s Rising, in 1763.≥∏ Indifferent commanders and outdated tactics resulted in defeat for the French army by Frederick of Prussia in Europe. Troops at\n\nWILLIAM PITT AND LOUISBOURG\n\n23\n\nLouisbourg fought a largely European siege battle very different from the tactics used on the frontiers and were well-enough trained for this, but their senior commanders proved uninspiring. La Marine The Ministère de la Marine directed policy for overseas possessions (Outremer) as well as administering the navy, colonies, and ﬁsheries, but its minister (secretary of state) lacked inﬂuence at Versailles and tended to execute rather than formulate naval policy. Some secretaries were not even admitted to the council of state. Colonies tended to develop as much as a result of ambitious individuals— New France’s governor generals provide examples—and trade expansion as direction from home. Unlike the British system, in which governors ruled through local assemblies, French ofﬁcers directed colonies through bureaucracies mirroring those at home. Nevertheless, while colonies appeared peripheral to France’s priorities, the council of state perceived Louisbourg to be valuable and thus made major concessions to reclaim it in 1748. Louis’ council did not regard la Marine as critical to France’s defense, however, and consequently the ﬂeet often struggled to protect the nation’s overseas possessions. De Maurepas (minister, 1723–49), although capable, was unable to inﬂuence Louis’ policy of concentrating resources on the army at the navy’s expense. He had fortiﬁed Louisbourg but had failed to provide an adequate garrison in 1745, and he contrived not to hold an inquiry into the duc d’Enville’s disastrous 1746 Nova Scotia expedition. Antoine-Louis Rouillé, comte de Jouy succeeded Maurepas and oversaw a shipbuilding program before moving to foreign affairs in 1754. Jean-Baptiste de Machault d’Arnouville, formerly controller general of ﬁnances, followed Rouillé and applied stringent economies to la Marine before being replaced in 1757 by François-Marie Peyrenc de Moras, who was initially both controller general of ﬁnances and minister of marine. He too concentrated on the department’s debts: he sent ships to Louisbourg in 1757 but found that no money was available for operations in 1758. In May 1758 Louis XV appointed the marquis de Massiac, a sea ofﬁcer, minister but excluded him from the council of state. Blamed for the loss of Louisbourg, de Massiac was replaced by Nicholas-René Berryer, a ﬁnancial ofﬁcial keen to eradicate corruption in the colonies and home arsenals.≥π\n\n24\n\nTHE CAPTURE OF LOUISBOURG, 1758\n\nThe ministry of marine, created by Jean-Baptiste Colbert, relied on senior ofﬁcials (premier commis), some of whom had little experience of maritime issues, to run eight departments: ‘‘police’’ (port administration, shipbuilding, ordnance, and arsenals), funds, colonies, commerce, naval conscription, the hydrographic bureau, archives, and accounts. In 1747 de Maurepas took charge of the ofﬁciers d’épée (seagoing and Troupes de la Marine ofﬁcers) and established the Bureau des Ofﬁciers. Divisions between ofﬁcers and ofﬁcials affected professional and social relationships: ofﬁciers d’épée often quarreled with ofﬁciers de plume (administrators). Many sea ofﬁcers were commissioned in 1755–57, which meant inexperienced junior seagoing watch-keepers; some aristocratic ofﬁcers refused to take their duties aboard ship seriously. Acrimony between noble ofﬁciers rouges and humbler ofﬁciers bleus, who were only allowed to command small warships, exacerbated the problems and denied the navy some successful privateer captains: Jean Vauquelin set an outstanding example at Louisbourg and Quebec.≥∫ Seamen in la Marine ate a monotonous diet and placed little emphasis on ship cleanliness. Scurvy and typhus were endemic aboard French warships at this time. Brest suffered periodic typhus outbreaks, but the 1757 epidemic, which devastated comte du Bois de La Motte’s ships returning from Louisbourg, spread to the town, the arsenal, and the region with a mass destructive effect; Brest took decades to recover. Disease affected the manning of ships; many gunners in Marshal Conﬂans’ ships were landsmen rather than seamen when they fought Admiral Hawke’s ships in Quiberon Bay in 1759. Naval arsenals were sophisticated industrial sites employing similar numbers to British dockyards, but inadequate resources constrained their output. By 1750, France had four dry docks, but none were fully functional. Rouillé’s shipbuilding program was short lived, although between 1748 and 1758, French dockyards built ﬁfty-two ships of the line. British shipwrights criticized French construction methods, but French ships were often faster and mounted larger guns, which gave them theoretical advantages over British vessels. La Marine also purchased commercially built frigates, including Vauquelin’s Aréthuse in 1757. The navy was critically short of guns, however: after 1755 many ships sailed without full complements of cannon. Jean Maritz, director of the army’s foundry at Lyon, modern-\n\nWILLIAM PITT AND LOUISBOURG\n\n25\n\nized naval gun founding, but cannon shortages plagued la Marine for years. Guns could not be replaced as quickly as they were lost in 1758–59.≥Ω While no professional naval institute existed, signiﬁcant names in la Marine and naval administration, anxious to identify the reasons for British success and d’Enville’s failure, founded l’Académie de Marine at Brest in 1752. Members applied scientiﬁc examination to ship design and construction, navigation, signaling, astronomy, hydrography, health, and provisioning along the lines of l’Académie des Sciences. This largely academic maritime society failed, however, to identify a key weakness in the French navy: the lack of time ships’ companies spent at sea.∂≠ Shortage of resources made long-term planning very difﬁcult in la Marine. Nevertheless, despite a lack of seamen and collective seagoing experience, the navy successfully commissioned sizeable squadrons in 1755 and 1757, a ﬂeet that kept Admiral Byng away from Minorca in 1756 and made signiﬁcant efforts to supply Louisbourg in 1758.∂∞\n\nEighteenth and Twenty-First Century Concepts of Strategy In August–September 1757 William Pitt discussed foreign policy and military campaign proposals in the Secret Committee. He has often been described as a ‘‘strategist,’’ although Dr. Johnson did not deﬁne ‘‘strategy’’ in his 1755 Dictionary of the English Language; indeed as Nicholas Rodger observes, the word on"
