Much fine work has been written by numerous other scholars on a subject which is not easy to encompass briefly. In order both to seek brevity and to offer a distinctive account, this study has been given a particular theme. European warfare is seen not only in terms of conflict in Europe, but also in conflicts that have involved European peoples, and due attention is devoted to the latter outside the confines of the continent, because oceanic and transoceanic conflict between European powers was of central importance in global history. British victories over the French on the waters of the world and in India and North America played a crucial role in the history of these areas, and more generally in both global and European history. Secondly, warfare between European and non-European peoples was largely responsible for the shift in power towards the former in this period. This shift took various forms: the alteration in the balance between “West” and “East” as the Turks were driven back in the valley of the Danube from 1683 was very different in its causes and consequences from the first European settlement in Australasia just over a century later. The common theme was the ability of European powers to deploy strength effectively. Warfare also played a fundamental role in what can be seen as a third theme: the creation of independent transoceanic states by peoples of European descent. At the same time that the power of European states was being extended in the New World—on the Pacific seaboard of North America—the vast colonial territories that had been claimed and fought over since Columbus set foot in the Bahamas in 1492 were collapsing in the face of successful rebellions: the thirteen British colonies on the east coast of the modern USA viii\n\nPREFACE\n\nin 1775–83; Argentina in 1810; Venezuela in 1811–21; and Peru in 1821–4. Thus the significance of European warfare can only be grasped if it is seen in a global context. This has the additional advantage that it ensures that naval forces and warfare are not marginalized, but are, instead treated as an integral aspect of European military power. This book is an attempt to offer an account that complements a number of fine studies still in print. In particular, it takes forward Geoffrey Parker’s excellent The military revolution. Military innovation and the rise of the West 1500– 1800 (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1988) which had relatively little to say about the period after 1660.

When the Indians opened fire, Watson “began such a fire upon them, as I believe they never before saw, and soon silenced their batteries, and the fire from their grabs [ships]”. The five-hour bombardment also led to the destruction ofTulaji Angria’s fleet, which was set ablaze with shells. On 13 February the warships closed in to bombard the fort at pistol-shot distance in order to make a breach for storming. This led to its surrender. British casualties were slight: 10 dead and 17 wounded; and Watson noted, “the hulls, masts and rigging of the ships are so little damaged, that if there was a necessity we should be able to proceed to sea in twenty four hours”. The episode was significant for a number of reasons. It reflected the confidence of the British in their naval power. The previous autumn, Watson, who had been delighted to show his flagship HMS Kent to the Nawab of Arcot, had emphasized the rôle of his warships as artillery-vessels: “if I can come near enough to batter… I shall make no doubt of success, but if by the shoal water, the large ships cannot come within distance to do execution, it will be doing of nothing”. The resources at the disposal of the British were also clear: George Thomas noted “We in [HMS] Salisbury fired 120 barrels of powder”. Watson was supported by a body of troops under Robert Clive and by the Bombay marine under Commodore William James. The previous year James’ flotilla had similarly forced the surrender of Angria’s bases at Severndaroog and Bankot. Help that had been promised by allied Marathas did not, however, materialize. George Thomas’s conclusion was redolent of confidence in European superiority: “A fine harbour…in the hands of Europeansmight 1\n\nEUROPEAN WARFARE AND ITS GLOBAL CONTEXT\n\ndefy the force of Asia.” Yet the episode also pointed in another direction. Watson noted, The walls are very thick, and built with excellent cement, and the best stone I ever saw for such a purpose. We found upwards of two hundred guns here of different sizes, twenty three of which are brass, and six of them new field pieces with elevating screws, so that Angria was not without European friends, notwithstanding he was so common an enemy. There were also six brass mortars…and a sufficient quantity of ammunition of all kinds…had the garrison been provided with men of spirit and knowledge it must have been a much dearer purchase to us. Watson reported that Angria had been building a 40-gun warship. Angria’s weaponry indicated the extent to which European military technology could be adopted in order to create a potentially formidable opposition different from that posed by campaigning outside Europe. More specifically, the destruction of Angria’s power cut short the development of an (admittedly small) Indian naval power. Such power was a rare occurrence in the period 1660–1815,1 although the Omani Arabs were a formidable naval power in the later seventeenth century, with large and well-armed ships able to contest Portuguese power in the western Indian Ocean. As Britain established its power in India in the eighteenth century, clashes occurred with native naval forces. In February 1775 two British warships encountered a Maratha squadron “of five large ships and two ketches with some gallivats”. The five large ships mounted 26–40 guns, the ketches two guns. The Maratha ships scattered and the British ships engaged the largest. It was fired on from within pistol range by our “great guns and small arms, some few of both were returned by the enemy, but far short of what might reasonably have been expected from a vessel of her force”. Maratha hopes of boarding a British warship were thwarted by its gunfire, and the Maratha ship blew up with no British casualties. In December 1780 Rear Admiral Sir Edward Hughes found the fleet of France’s ally, Haidar Ali of Mysore, off Mangalore. Covered by gunfire from British warships and in the face of fire from coastal positions, the ships’ boats of the British squadron moved in and successfully boarded the two leading Mysore warships, boats of 26 and 24 guns. In 1783 John Macpherson, a senior official of the British East India Company, wrote that British forces had taken ports belonging to Mysore, “in some of which we have found the materials and great advancement of a very considerable naval power”. Mysore, however, was very much a land power, its fleet was lightly gunned and small, and Britain rarely encountered serious naval resistance from Indian rulers.2 The particular characteristics of European strength on a world scale werenot 2\n\nTHE ROBERTS THESIS\n\nso much the use of gunpowder weaponry as the “organisational cohesion and staying power of their state and corporate organizations”,3 and the ability to deploy, entrench and maintain power in distant continents; a function of naval dominance and of the resources and priorities that entailed. Initially, this meant the Iberian powers, Portugal and Spain, but, from the late seventeenth century, it was increasingly true also of the clash between Britain and France. The rise of European states to a position of power across the oceans and around much of the globe was the military/political change that most deserves the description of a military revolution but, when the thesis was advanced, it was one that was neglected in favour of changes in European land warfare.\n\nThe Roberts thesis The single most influential concept in studies of early modern warfare has been that of a military revolution. It was based on a lecture by Michael Roberts delivered in 1955 and published the following year. Roberts argued that there was a mutually sustaining relationship between the professionalism required by tactical changes and the rise of larger and more permanent military forces of the state. Roberts stated that changes in tactics, strategy, the scale of warfare and its impact upon society, which had their origins in the United Provinces (the modern Netherlands) at the end of the sixteenth century and culminated in the Sweden of Gustavus Adolphus (1611–32), deserved the description “revolutionary”. They led, in the short term, to the creation of a Swedish army that brought striking military success in the Thirty Years’War (1618–48), and, in the long term, to the creation of armies that were an effective force of statecraft, both domestically and externally. These are believed to have facilitated the development of “absolutist” states by shifting the balance of domestic military power towards sovereigns and away from their subjects.4 Thus, the thesis of the military revolution can be characterized not only as a “statement of technological determinism”, but also as a repetition of “the Whiggish notion that gunpowder blasted the feudal order at the behest of the centralized state”.5 Tactical changes pioneered in the Dutch army were crucial to the thesis. The rise in infantry firepower in the sixteenth century with the development of hand-held firearms led Count Maurice of Nassau (1567–1625) and his cousin, Count William Louis, to put into practice the notion of using a volley technique in order to maintain constant fire. This was related to a standardization in Dutch weaponry, and the creation of a disciplined field army.6 3\n\nEUROPEAN WARFARE AND ITS GLOBAL CONTEXT\n\nGustavus followed in having his troops fight in line, but he also stressed the importance of attack. He used the countermarch (the manoeuvre by which musketeers rotated their position by moving through the ranks of their colleagues, so that, having fired, they could retire to reload while others fired) offensively, the other ranks moving forward through stationary reloaders. He also trained his cavalry to charge in order to break the opposing formation by the impact of the charge and the use of swords, rather than to approach more slowly and fire guns from horseback. Firing by rank and more complex manoeuvres required more discipline and training, and these could best be ensured by maintaining permanent forces, rather than hastily hiring men at the outbreak of wars. The new ar mies tur ned infantr y firepower into a manoeuvrable winning formula, and thus enhanced the value of larger armies over fortifications, but these more substantial forces required a level of administrative support, in the supply of money, men and provisions, that led to new governmental institutions and larger financial demands. Roberts also argued that armies enhanced monarchical power sufficiently to ensure that in most states an effective royal monopoly of power was created. This monopolization furthered and was furthered by a militarization of society that owed much to military service, including the growth of noble officership and of conscription, and to the centrality of military needs in government. Military requirements and ethos integrated society and the state. Thus, the modern art of war, with its large professional armies and concentrated yet mobile firepower, was created at the same time as—and, indeed, made possible and necessary by—the creation of the modern state. Roberts’ theory was useful in offering a conceptual framework within which early modern warfare could be discussed. It provided an alternative to a narrative account, and one that at once addressed the central questions of change (or, its opposite, continuity) and the causes and consequences of change. The concept was also fundamental in that it addressed narrow military questions, particularly about tactics and training, in a fashion that apparently directly brought out their wider implications for issues of governmental and political development. This was crucial because the relationship between military innovation and “state formation”, or at least domestic political history, is one that has to be put alongside the more conventional account of the military aspects of inter-state competition. Furthermore, the thesis of a military revolution was well suited to the approach towards “state formation” that was dominant in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. This approach emphasized coercion and force and thus focused on qualitative and quantitative developments in the armed forces at the disposal of central governments and the consequent ability of these governments to establish absolutist regimes. In the 1980s, however, both absolutism and 4\n\nTHE ROBERTS THESIS QUESTIONED\n\nearlymodern European state formation have been redefined, for example in William Beik’s Absolutism and society in seventeenth-century France (Cambridge, 1985), away from an emphasis on coercion and, instead, towards one on a greater measure of consensus, at least within the elite. This has important implications for the study of early modern military history, not only because the purpose of military change requires re-examination, but also as its process needs re-consideration. The extent to which more effective military forces reflected not more autocratic states but rather crown-elite co-operation is more apparent. The use of the concept of a military revolution in the early modern period was redated by Geoffrey Parker to the period 1450–1530,7 and subsequently greatly advanced in his The military revolution. Military innovation and the rise of the West, 1500–1800, for with valuable insights based upon incredibly wideranging knowledge, Parker located European developments in the wider global context of “the rise of the West”, although, as he made clear, this was far from being a smooth process in military terms. Parker’s work was even more valuable because most of the work on the rise of the West, not least Immanuel Wallerstein’s thesis in his Modern world system (New York, 1974, 1980) of relationships based on zones of exploitation, adopted a somewhat crude economic causation that neglected military factors or treated them as a necessary consequence of other power relationships.\n\nThe Roberts thesis questioned The Roberts thesis is, however, questionable on a number of grounds, both methodological and empirical, more particularly as a description and analysis of what happened in 1560–1660 and because of what Roberts implies about the periods on either side. Indeed, an analysis of these periods lends additional force to a critique of Roberts’ thesis. As is now becoming clearer, medieval European warfare was not static and unchanging; quite the contrary, it can be seen as evolving and modernizing steadily, or an emphasis can be placed on a number of important shifts. Clifford Rogers has recently drawn attention to what he terms “the Military Revolutions of the Hundred Years’ War”. 8 Conversely, it has been argued that in the case of medieval Kano, now part of Nigeria, “it is possible to discern a steady development over several centuries in the complexity and variety of weapons, tactical innovations, state structure, and military organization”.9 A military revolution is only conceivable against preceding stasis or limited change. Gunpowder clearly brought significant change to fourteenth-century warfare and change continuedthereafter at 5\n\nEUROPEAN WARFARE AND ITS GLOBAL CONTEXT\n\nvarying rates, but gunpowder did not introduce change to medieval European warfare. As far as contemporaries were concerned, it was, however, the spread of gunpowder weaponry that was most obviously revolutionary, and this interpretation was maintained in subsequent centuries. In 1761 the British writer Campbell Dalrymple had no doubt that his readers would understand what he meant when he argued that contemporary criticism of firepower and calls for the use of cold steel in its place, might “produce another military revolution, and send us back to the arms in use before the invention of gunpowder”.10 An emphasis on the development and diffusion of gunpowder weaponry in Europe would, however, lead to a stress on the period before that highlighted by Roberts. Roberts’ thesis can also be queried by considering the subsequent 130 years. In focusing, in my A military revolution? Military change and European society 1550–1800 (London, 1991), on the period after 1660, I was motivated by a sense that this had been neglected, not only in terms of what happened then, in both a qualitative and a quantitative sense, but also of the significance of these developments. An examination of this period, most commonly known as the ancien régime, throws light both on the previous century and on the subsequent period of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars of 1792–1815. If the themes of change and continuity are to be addressed in studying 1560–1660 and 1792– 1815, then it is crucially necessary to consider ancien regime warfare, as claims of change are often made for 1560–1660 and 1792–1815 in the context of misleading assumptions about the stagnation, indecisiveness and conservatism of ancien régime warfare. These assumptions are only a part of a more general historiographical neglect of change in the ancien régime that rest in part on the ver y conceptualization of that period, and indeed on the connotations of its linguistic description. In crude terms, the general model is of a resolution of the mid-seventeenth-century crisis in the shape of absolutist states and societies, the subsequent stability of which was a crucial component of the ancien régime, but one that was faced in the late eighteenth century by a new general crisis, the most obvious manifestation of which was the French Revolution.11 Thus the chronology of military change is apparently matched by a more general political chronology, although there has been no attempt to relate the two. This analysis is, however, problematic in both ways. If too static an interpretation, in both political and military terms, is adopted for the ancien régime, then major change must be sought and explained in the late eighteenth century. Conversely, if the emphasis is rather on a more dynamic, fluid or plastic ancien régime or early modern period, then it is less necessary to focus on change or the causes of change in the late eighteenth century.12 6\n\nTHE ROBERTS THESIS QUESTIONED\n\nThis dynamism can indeed be demonstrated by arguing that the earlymodern military revolution requires reconceptualization. Rather than adopting the notion of a single revolution (the Roberts thesis), it is more accurate to suggest that, if early modern changes can be described in terms of revolution, there were two “revolutions”, one in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, and the other in c. 1660–c. 1720. The first has been ably described by Parker, with his emphasis on firearms and the trace italienne, but because he both failed to break free from Roberts’ model and neglected to consider the post-1660 period, he gave the misleading impression that the Roberts thesis could be sustained and amplified by his own emphasis on the preceding period. Instead, it is apparent from a consideration of seventeenthcentury warfare that the major changes took place after 1660, and it can be argued that Roberts’ century was in relative terms one of limited change between two periods of greater importance. There are, however, problems in using the term “revolution” to describe the kinds of changes that took place over many decades. Many of the changes that occurred between 1660 and 1720 were gradual and furthermore there were differences between states. Thus the Dutch Republic strengthened its naval forces, but also strongly neglected its land forces. They paid dearly for this when the French invaded by land in 1672. Contemporary writings do not suggest remarkable differences in warfare for the decades on either side of 1660. Nevertheless, relative domestic peace and stability after 1660 increased revenues and allowed for expansion in military and/or naval organizations. The principal changes in c. 1660–c. 1720 were both qualitative and quantitative. The replacement of the pike by the newly developed socket bayonet, the substitution of the matchlock musket by the flintlock, and the development of the pre-packaged cartridge increased infantry firepower and manoeuvrability. It led also to a decline in the relative importance of cavalry in most European armies. The development of the socket bayonet, of the flintlock musket, and of improved warship design brought about qualitative changes in warfare at least as important as those of Roberts’ period, and arguably more so, with their consequence of a rise in the tactical importance of massed firepower in both land and naval warfare. The corresponding quantitative changes— considerably larger armies and fleets—confirm the conclusion that the later period has been unduly neglected. Navies provide some of the best indicators of change in the period 1660– 1720. The development of line-ahead tactics greatly altered naval warfare, not only tactically, but also by increasing the importance of heavily gunned ships of the line, and thus of the states able to deploy and maintain substantial numbers of such ships. In 1639, at the Battle of the Downs, the attack in line-ahead was first executed in European waters and the Dutch won a major victory over 7\n\nEUROPEAN WARFARE AND ITS GLOBAL CONTEXT\n\nSpain. The English fleet was ordered in 1653 to use the line-ahead formation pioneered by the Dutch. The new fighting instructions for the Dutch fleet issued in 1665 laid down that fighting be done in a single line of battle. In 1666 the signal for forming line of battle was added to the general signal book, thereby completing the adoption of line-ahead tactics by the Dutch navy. Qualitative changes, i.e. line-ahead tactics, were accompanied by, indeed required, due to the stronger emphasis on gunnery, greater specialization in warships, so that, with the exception of privateers and the heavily armed East Indiamen, merchantmen were no longer used as warships. As battles played a larger rôle in naval conflicts in the period 1652–77 than earlier in the century, there was a greater stress on the fighting power of the large warships that dominated battles. In the 1660s really large two-deckers, ships with a displacement tonnage of 1,100–1,600 tons, largely armed with 24-pounders, were constructed in numbers. The Dano-Swedish war of 1675–9 was the last in European waters in which armed merchantmen were used to any considerable extent in the main battle fleets: armed only with 12-pounders, the Swedes found them obsolete. There was also a shift from bronze to cast-iron guns, as advances in cast-iron technology provided cheap and dependable heavy guns. Furthermore, there were significant developments in the size of several navies, as a number of western European states invested heavily in naval power. The Dutch, English and, from the 1660s, the French, substantially increased the size of their fleets in the 1650s–80s and the power of their gunnery also rose appreciably. New bases were created, for example, by the French, at Lorient, Rochefort and Brest, while Dunkirk and Toulon were enlarged. Advanced shipbuilding techniques were introduced and in about 1680 the French engineer Renau d’Elicagaray developed the bomb-ketch, a very useful warship for attacking positions on land. A professional naval officer corps was developed. Under an ordnance of 1689 calling for larger and more powerful ships, France launched ten warships in 1691, all of at least 88 guns. 13 The strongest navy Sweden had hitherto possessed was constructed in the 1680s and 1690s. Accounts of the English navy make it clear that, although there had been appreciable developments in the sixteenth century, they were dwarfed in terms of numbers of warships, tactics and naval organization by those in the second half of the seventeenth century. 14 In the early eighteenth century these developments were followed by the launching of Russia as a naval power under Peter the Great and the dramatic revival of Spanish naval strength and organization under Philip V.15 Thus larger “standing navies” were a feature of the late seventeenth century. There are major problems in producing aggregate totals of European warships: the lists in George Modelski and William Thompson’s Seapower in global politics, 1494–1993 (London, 1988) exclude 8\n\nTHE ROBERTS THESIS QUESTIONED\n\nseveral important second-rank naval powers, most obviously Denmark and Sweden, and revise upwards the number of guns required for a ship to be counted. J.Glete’s study is more thorough and comprehensive, although it is necessary to exercise care in using his figures, especially because of the issue of effectiveness. For example, he gives the number of Swedish “battleships and cruisers” in 1800 as 24, but a contemporary memorandum noted, “24 ships of the line whereof 18 are serviceable. The others are old and out of repair but may serve as guard or block ships”. It is, nevertheless, clear that, despite falls in the naval strength of particular powers (for example, the French navy in the 1710s), aggregate numbers rose appreciably in the late seventeenth century, and then again in the eighteenth.16 On the eve of the French Revolutionary Wars, there was a vast naval arms race in the 1780s which involved every would-be sea power from Naples to Russia, as well as the established powers: Britain, France, Spain and the Dutch. In 1790 the ships of the line of Britain, France and Spain had a combined displacement tonnage of 729,000 compared to 550,000 in 1775. These large, permanent naval forces and their increasingly sophisticated administrative and logistical support systems were a critical factor in enabling European powers to secure their overseas empires. As in the age of Portuguese and Spanish expansion (1490–1550), but now even more so, no non-European power could match this force and the systems that created and, crucially, sustained it. Similarly, larger standing armies developed in the century after the Roberts period. The bulk of the growth occurred in the later period and it was of such an order that it cannot be described simply in terms of the continuation of already established patterns of growth. Again there are problems with counting numbers and, in particular, effectives, 17 and it is necessary to exercise considerable caution even when using oft-cited figures. One of the most useful, and necessarily collective, projects that military historians could engage in would be the production of an authoritative data bank on army strengths in the early modern period. Contemporaries had no doubt that the rise of armies was exaggerated and that many units were incomplete. Thus, the theoretical size of the Portuguese army in 1761 was 31,000; the actual numbers were 16,500.18 Accepting these caveats, it is, nevertheless, clear that the army sizes of the major powers rose dramatically in the period 1660–1720, particularly during 1680–1710. This was certainly true of Austria, France and Russia, and was also true of second-rank powers, particularly Britain, Prussia and Savoy-Piedmont. The French army was cut after the War of the Spanish Succession finished in 1714, but in the period 1720–80 the size of the Austrian, Prussian and Russian armies continued to grow appreciably although this was nottrue of that of Sweden, while a number of German states, including Bavaria and Saxony, had smaller peacetime armies in the late eighteenth century than they had had at its 9\n\nEUROPEAN WARFARE AND ITS GLOBAL CONTEXT\n\nstart. The army of Savoy-Piedmont did not maintain its earlier growth. Indeed, the expansion of c. 1680–c. 1710 was such that many states in the subsequent period of peace were badly affected by indebtedness; a major consequence of this was a retraction in army strength. In contrast, the subsequent prominence of Prussia owed much to its ability to maintain its growth in army size. Larger armies and navies encouraged the development of more professional officer corps. There were also important improvements in 1660–1720 in military and naval administration, especially in the ways in which armies and navies were trained, equipped, paid and controlled by their governments. The French19 and Prussian armies were obvious examples, although it would be a mistake to exaggerate the administrative sophistication and standards of the period, not least in the French army. This administrative dimension was the one in which many of the most important changes occurred. Better administration allowed the recruitment and maintenance of larger armies. Thus, though there were technological changes in the per iod, it can be suggested that the most significant developments (expansion of armies and navies and greater state monopolization of violence) were not essentially technologically driven, but more social and political in their nature. Thus, on both land and sea, and in both qualitative and quantitative terms, there were major changes in the period after 1660. Whether they deserve description in terms of a revolution is of course subjective: there are no agreed-upon cr iteria by which military change, especially qualitative development, can be measured or, more significantly, revolution discerned. If simply quantitative criteria are to be addressed then it is difficult to compare aggregate and percentage increases. Again, different aggregate figures can point to different results. With ships, for example, tonnage, and number and weight of guns, can provide different results. Eighteenth-century British warships were less impressive than their Bourbon counterparts. French and Spanish ships were better designed and generally faster. In 1744 Admiral Mathews complained about the British warships under his command and provided an indication of the danger of judging naval effectiveness in terms of the number of guns per warship, Nor can ships which cannot make use of their lower tiers of guns, though they mount ninety and eighty guns, do the duty expected (by the ignorant) against the 74 and 64 gun ships of France who can fire theirs…there is no proportion of metal, our lightly gunned ships having but twelve and six pounders, whereas some of the enemy’s seventy-four gun ships carry forty, eighteen and nine pounders…the rest of them, thirty two, eighteen and nine; their ships of sixty four guns have twenty 10\n\nTHE ROBERTS THESIS QUESTIONED\n\nfour, eighteen and nine pounders, which makes even them better men of war than our eighty gun ships that cannot make use of their lower tiers which they will ever seldom be able to do… I have now but two ships of ninety and three of eighty guns, that can make use of their lower tiers of guns, if it blows a cap full of wind… not in [my] power to engage the enemy, when he is superior to them, nor to escape when he is inferior.20 In counting numbers of guns, it is also necessary to note that the ability to use them varied: the regular gun-drills of the British navy enabled their ships to maintain a heavier and more accurate fire for longer. Clearly, therefore, numbers were not the sole factor. This was also the case on land, most spectacularly during the earlier Spanish defeat of the empires in the New World. The Aztec and Inca empires were overthrown by tiny forces and only a small portion of the armed forces of the European powers were used outside Europe and the North Atlantic world over the following three centuries. Indeed, it is at the level of global significance that the importance of the changes in the post-1660 period should be considered. Obviously, there are problems in considering European and extra-European warfare as parts of a whole. The physical conditions, the size of the forces involved and the problems of central control of them were all very different in the two areas. Yet an assessment of revolutionary impact requires such a perspective. In terms of the global reach of seapower, the balance had swung towards the European powers long before 1660, but that was not true on land. The post-1660 period was, unfortunately, neglected by Parker; indeed, his book carries misleading dates, for it principally deals with 1500–1650 and not the following century and a half. This is especially unfortunate because it is related to a stress on the clash between transoceanic European forces and nonEuropean powers, and a consequent lack of emphasis on Europe’s land frontier: the border with the Turks and, further east, with Persia. Indeed, whereas Parker mentions the siege ofVienna, 21 it is disappointing, in light of the valuable attention he focuses on relations between European and non-European powers, that he subsequently neglects Austro-Turkish warfare.22 The same is also true of its Polish-Turkish23 and Russo-Turkish counterparts, and of Russian warfare with Persia and in Central Asia.24 Yet it is in this sphere that change can most obviously be noted. For centuries European powers had been under pressure from the east, with essentially settled societies resisting the inroads of partly nomadic peoples. Such an assessment can be taken back to the last centuries of Imperial Rome (Persian attacks on Classical Greece were somewhat different), and then the successive attacks made by Arabs, Magyars, Seljuk Turks, Mongols, Ottoman 11\n\nEUROPEAN WARFARE AND ITS GLOBAL CONTEXT\n\nTurks andTimur (Tamerlane), although the pressure from the east was not continuous and the Crusades were an important example of European powers applying pressure in the opposite direction. It was the Ottoman Turks who finally conquered the Balkans and in 1453 overthrew Byzantium. In the sixteenth century, thanks in part to the effective use of firearms and cannon, Turkish power expanded even further. Selim I defeated the Safavids of Persia at Caldiran (1514) and pushed Turkish frontiers eastwards. Victories at Marj Dabia (1516) and al-Raydaniyya (1517) led to the conquest of the Mameluke Empire, their cavalry falling victim to Turkish firepower. The frontiers of Christendom were also pushed back. In the Mediterranean, Rhodes fell in 1522 and Cyprus in 1570–1, and all of North Afr ica except Morocco acknowledged Turkish lordship. The Turks also advanced from the Balkans into central Europe. Belgrade fell in 1521, and the decisive victory of Mohacs (1526) was followed by the conquest of most of Hungary by Suleiman I (the Magnificent). The Turkish advance was held—a series of unsuccessful sieges (Vienna 1529, Corfu 1537, Reggio 1543 and Malta 1565) marking the limit of advance—but that did not end the Turkish threat to Christian Europe. The Turkish state was one of the most populous in Europe, and its military system the most sophisticated in sixteenth-century Europe. The Austro-Turkish war of 1593– 1606 revealed the logistical strength of the Turkish army.25 It was fortunate for the European powers that the Turks devoted so much energy to their long wars against Safavid Persia: that of 1578–90 led to a welcome reduction in the threat to Habsburg Europe. In the mid-seventeenth century Turkish power suffered a decline, but there was then a revival of strength and energy under the first two grand viziers of the Köprülü dynasty. They benefited from the end of the war with Persia as this revitalized the Turkish state and enabled the Turks to take a more active rôle in Europe: the long conflict with Venice over Crete (1645–69) was brought to an end successfully with the fall of Candia. Turkish authority in Translyvania was made more effective as a result of a war in 1658–61, and the Turks were left in complete control there after a brief war with Austria in 1663–4. A war with Poland during 1671–6 led to the acquisition of Podolia, a large territory stretching from the Dniester to the Dnieper, which increased their ability to intervene in Poland and the Ukraine. The disturbed state of the latter encouraged the Turks to attack Russia in 1677–81, although that war brought them no gains. In 1682 Imre Thököly, the leader of the anti-Habsburg rebels in the section of Hungary ruled by Austria, agreed, in return for Turkish help, to become a vassal of the sultan, and in 1683 the Turks advanced on Vienna. Thus the Turks were still very much a dynamic force in the late seventeenth century. Indeed, in so far as there was a military revolution either in the 12\n\nTHE ROBERTS THESIS QUESTIONED\n\nRoberts period or earlier, it had not hitherto led to a decisive shift in the military balance or movement in the frontier between Christendom and Islam, a point that was further underlined by the peripheral nature of the Christian military impact on North Africa.27 This situation was to change radically by 1718, so much so that by 1730 there was no doubt that the British dramatist Henry Fielding was being satirical in his play The coffee-house politician when he had the ridiculous and news-obsessed Politic repeatedly express his concern about Turkish intentions, culminating in his fear that we should see Turkish galleys in the [English] Channel…it is possible for the Grand Signior to find an ingress into Europe.—Suppose, Sir, this spot I stand on to be Turkey—then here is Hungary—very well—here is France, and here is England—granted—then we will suppose he had possession of Hungary—what then remains but to conquer France, before we find him at our own coast…this is not all the danger…he can come by sea to us.28 There had been a dramatic reversal. The Turkish defeat at Vienna (12 September 1683) was followed by substantial Austrian advances. The siege of the strong fortress of Buda in 1684 was unsuccessful, and disease decimated the Austrians, but that of 1686 ended with a successful storming in which the Austrians used their bayonets with effect. The year 1687 brought a decisive Austrian victory at Berg Harsan (Nagyharsany) and the deposition of Sultan Mehmed IV; and 1688 saw the fall of Belgrade (8 September). The collapse of the Turkish position in the Balkans and an Austrian advance into the world of the Orthodox appeared imminent. The Austrians developed links with rebellious elements among the Bulgarians and Serbs and began negotiations with the prince ofWallachia, a Turkish client-ruler. In 1689 the main Turkish army was defeated south of Belgrade, and the Austr ians seized Nish, Vidin, Pristina and Skopje and reached Bucharest. The Serbian patriarch of Pec was persuaded to take an oath of loyalty to Leopold I, who on 6 April 1690 issued an appeal for the support of all Balkan peoples against the Turks and promised liberty under their lawful ruler himself as King of Hungary. The Austrian victories reflected the improvements introduced by Count Raimondo Montecuccoli, Commander-in-Chief and President of the War Council 1668–80. The Austrian army became larger and more mobile and this was subsequently furthered by the introduction of flintlocks. Flintlocks and bayonets gave the Austrian infantry an important tactical advantage over the Turks, who had neither, while the Austrian cavalry improved considerably. Logistics, however, remained a major problem. 13\n\nEUROPEAN WARFARE AND ITS GLOBAL CONTEXT\n\nThe late 1680s may have represented the best opportunity for driving the Turks out of all or most of the Balkans until the nineteenth century, but Turkish resilience should not be underrated, while from 1688 the Austrians were distracted by the outbreak of war in western Europe (the Nine Years’War or War of the League of Augsburg, 1688–97). In addition, the Orthodox populations of areas now open to Catholicization by the Austrians were becoming restless. The chaos that greeted Suleiman II (1687–91) was quashed, and a new grand vizier from the Köprülü family, Fazil Mustafa (1689–91), restored order to army and government. In 1690 he took Nish and Belgrade, the latter after only a six-day siege, but in the following year Fazil and the Turkish hopes of recapturing Hungary were both killed at the major defeat at Zalánkemén (18/19 August), a hard-fought battle that left a third of the Austrian army dead or wounded, but the Turks routed. Conflict over the next few years was indecisive and difficult, because of Austrian commitments against Louis XIV and, in the battlezone, improved fortifications, the depletion of local sources of supply and the problems of fighting in undrained and fever-ridden marshy lowlands. Matters moved towards a climax as a result of the accession of the energetic Mustafa II (1695– 1703) and the end of the war in Italy in 1696, which enabled the Austrian ruler, Emperor Leopold I to transfer more troops and his rising general, Eugene of Savoy, to Hungary. The Turks had some success in 1695–6, but Eugene routed Mustafa at Zenta in 1697, the latter suffering possibly 30,000 casualties. The eventual peace settlement at Karlowitz (January 1699) saw Austria gain Transylvania and the whole of Hungary except the Banat of Temesvár (Timisoara), while her allies Poland and Venice acquired Podolia and the Morea. Conflict was resumed in 1716, the Austrians winning crushing victories at Peterwardein (Petrovaradin) (1716) and Belgrade (1717) and captur ing Temesvár (1716) and Belgrade (1717). The Peace of Passarowitz (1718) left Austria with the Banat of Temesvar, Little (Western) Wallachia and northern Serbia. These victories indicated the increasing vulnerability of Turkish mass formations to the firepower of disciplined Austrian units; but, aside from differences in firepower, Turkish discipline and drill were also poor. The shift in the balance of military advantage between Austria and Turkey was also significant, as the best way to put a definite temporal boundary on the Military Revolution (in Parker’s valuable globalist sense of the term) is to isolate the period when Europeans became militarily superior to peoples who in the past had been their equals or superiors, most notably the Turks. In contrast to the receding frontier of Europe in the sixteenth century, there was expansion in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries: the military balance between “West” and “East” had reversed. 14\n\nTHE ROBERTS THESIS QUESTIONED\n\nAustrian victories were part of a more general shift in European warfare away from speed, mobility and primal shock-power and towards defensive tactics based on infantry firepower, a shift that was already apparent among the major European powers during the first half of the sixteenth century. It was this shift that led also to the defeat of “Gaelic” forces in Britain, culminating at the killing field at Culloden in 1746, 29 while better-equipped and bettertrained Austr ian armies defeated more mobile Hungarian opponents at Nagyszombat (1704) and Zsibó (1705) during the Rakoczi rebellion. More generally, the period from 1660 onwards, up to the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, saw the victory of armies emphasizing the concentrated firepower of disciplined infantry and their supporting artillery over more mobile forces that stressed the use of shock-power in attack. This theme links both a number of otherwise disparate campaigns and, more generally, the struggle between established governments and rebellious “marginal” forces (for example, the Cossacks and Jacobites) and that between European Christian states and their Islamic neighbours. As with all theses, this one must not be pushed too far: the Turks were essentially a settled people, and the western Europeans had also been settled long before the “military revolution”, but without enjoying military superiority over their more mobile opponents. A similar contrast between the more specialized and organized forces of essentially settled peoples and their more mobile, and often nomadic, opponents was scarcely new and can be seen elsewhere in the period 1660–1815, for example in the struggles between the Turks and the Bedouin, Mughal India and invaders from Afghanistan, Safavid Persia and the same invaders, and Manchu China and the peoples of lands conquered between 1691 and 1760, such as the Khalkhas of Eastern Mongolia and the Dzungarians of Western Mongolia. Similarly, in 1811, a Turko-Egyptian army invaded the Hejaz, capturing the port of Yanbo in 1811, Medina in 1812 and Mecca in 1813. The more specialized forces generally enjoyed the advantages of numbers and firepower, but other factors could be decisive: Safavid Persia was overthrown at the battle of Gulnabad (1722), although a contrary result “ought not to have been in much doubt”, in large part because the Afghan forces were better led.30 Nevertheless, in the period 1660–1815 the success of the major European states in creating effective forces able to use concentrated and disciplined firepower in order to defeat opponents was very important in global terms. The success of these forces against opponents armed with guns was particularly significant. In short, it can be argued that the qualitative European military changes already noted—the bayonet, the flintlock musket, accurate and mobile grape—as well as canister-firing field artillery, and warships firing a greater weight of metal—were crucial in that they opened up a major gap in capability 15\n\nEUROPEAN WARFARE AND ITS GLOBAL CONTEXT\n\namong armies and navies armed with firearms. Thus Mughal India lagged in the adoption of the flintlock and in improvements in field artillery. At Patna (1764) the Indians were armed with matchlocks and pikes. The men on the Maratha warship destroyed by the British in February 1775 were armed with matchlocks.31 In addition, while earlier European conquests (America, the Philippines, Portuguese coastal gains in Africa and Asia) could in most cases rely on superior technology (for example, gunpowder, fortifications and steel), those of the period 1660–1815 reflected not only superior technology but also a superiority in military technique (broadly conceived to include drill, cartography, logistic and financial institutions, as well as tactics) which was more difficult to transfer or replicate than technology, resting as it did on the foundations of centuries of European social and institutional change. The American Indians who took part in Pontiac’s Rising (1763–4) captured a number of British forts and successfully ambushed British forces, but they had no source of firearms other than captures, were unable to capture major positions such as Detroit and Niagara, and found it difficult to sustain long conflicts; in 1764 they were obliged to submit. It would be misleading to imply that European forces were invariably successful. The successes of European ar mies against non-Europeans demonstrated a widespread European superiority in tactics and firepower. It did not guarantee victory. Hardly any European power concentrated its military and naval resources against non-European opponents. Russia, the one major power that did, did not possess the most advanced military organization in Europe, and, in any case, not only fought other European powers but also had to be always prepared to do so. A recent study of India stresses the rôle of problems of terrain and supply in order to emphasize that “though the new artillery/infantry combinations of the Europeans were clearly superior in the best of circumstances, they were not—at this point—invincible”. At the battle of Buxar (1764), one British officer noted the Indians kept “up a very severe cannonade…in general their guns were well pointed” and again that Indian grapeshot was “severe”, did “great execution” and stopped the advance of British sepoys (Indians trained by the British and in their service). Another officer commented on “a very heavy cannonade” and wrote that the 150 cannon captured by the British were in “good condition”. Both officers also noted the severity of the Indian cannonade at the Battle of Patna (1764). In western India the British were drawn into struggles between the Maratha leaders in the 1770s. A slow-moving British army advanced from Bombay into the difficult terrain of the Ghats, but was surrounded at Wadgaon (February 1779) and forced to accept terms. Another army, however, marched overland from Bengal to Surat safely, and its rapid breaching of the walls of Ahmadabad showed the effectiveness of British artillery. The British and the Marathas 16\n\nTHE ROBERTS THESIS QUESTIONED\n\nfought again inconclusively in 1781–2. In 1780 Haidar Ali of Mysore invaded the Carnatic, destroying a force under William Baillie at Pollilore (10 September). The performance of the Marathas in 1803 in the Second AngloMaratha War revealed a high level of “infantry and especially artillery capability”.32 There were a number of prominent failures by European forces, including PrinceVasily Golitsyn’s campaigns in the Crimea in 1687 33 and 1689, the Russian siege of Azov of 1695, Peter I’s campaign against the Turks in 1711, and Austrian campaigns against theTurks in 1739 and 1788. The British navy was driven back by the Dardanelles batteries in 1807. A less well-known failure was the encirclement and annihilation of a Russian force on the bank of the river Sunja in 1785 by North Caucasian Muslims taking part in the holy war launched by Sheikh Mansur.34 The Russians also found it difficult to impose control among the Chukchi and Koryaks of north-east Siberia. 35 In North America, in 1802, the Aleuts destroyed the recently founded Russian base of Mikhailovsk. American Indians were able to fight “European” Americans to a standstill almost to the end of the eighteenth century. This was true both near the eastern seaboard, where, for example, theYamasee nearly destroyed the British colonies in the Carolinas in 1715, and along the northern border of French expansion from Louisiana and Spanish expansion north from Mexico. The French suffered defeats at the hands of the Chickasaws in the late 1730s, although the use of devastation—destroying villages and crops—forced them to terms in 1752. The Spaniards attempted to create an impregnable cordon of presidios (fortified bases), but the Indians travelled between them with no difficulty. The Apaches, Comanches and other Plains Indians were well mounted and armed, their firearms coming from trade with British merchants and with Spanish Louisiana, where there was a policy of trying to win them over by trade. The Indians were also able to respond to Spanish tactics. Spanish expeditions, such as those against the Apaches in 1732 and 1775, were hindered by the fact that there were few fixed positions for them to attack. The Yuma rebellion of 1781, in which Spanish positions were destroyed, thwarted plans of expansion through the Colorado Valley and into central Arizona. In contrast, the Indians on the Pacific coast lacked both guns and horses, so that Spain expanded her power in California rapidly in the 1770s, although in 1775 the Ipais were able to burn the mission at San Diego.36 There were also setbacks for European powers in North Africa. Spanishheld Oran resisted attacks in 1667, 1672, 1675 and 1688, Ceuta and Melilla Moroccan sieges in 1720–7 and 1732, and 1774–5 respectively; but the English abandoned Tangier in 1683, the Spaniards lost Oran in 1708, recaptured it in 1732 and evacuated it in 1792, the Portuguese lost 17\n\nEUROPEAN WARFARE AND ITS GLOBAL CONTEXT\n\nMazagam to Morocco in 1765, and major Spanish attacks on Algiers in 1775, 1783 and 1784 were repelled. The Spaniards suffered heavy casualties in 1775 as their exposed troops were subjected to heavy fire while their artillery could not be deployed speedily on the coastal sand. A French attempt to land at Larache in Morocco in 1765 failed in the face of heavy fire. The Bey of Tunis in 1741 seized the offshore island of Tabarca, which the French had purchased from the Lomellino family, defeated a counterattack by a small French force in 1742 and sacked the French Afr ica Company’s base at Cape Negre. Elsewhere in Afr ica, the attempt by the Portuguese to expand their influence up the Zambesi into modern Zimbabwe in search of the reputed gold and silver mines of Monomotapa, was defeated by fever and by a widespread tribal rising in 1693–5, by natives armed with spears. Serious doubts have been raised about the benefit of firearms for the Portuguese in Angola and Mozambique in the period 1575–1680:37 their inaccuracy and low rate of fire were major disadvantages when confronting the dispersed formations common in southern Africa. In addition, by the seventeenth century, the African armies had taken up muskets and these supplanted bows as the general missile weapon in Angola at about the end of the century. In Angola “there was no automatic or overwhelming technical or organizational superiority” on the part of the Portuguese. They quickly accepted African tactics and organization for their army, which was largely manned by Africans, and the attempt to conquer the kingdom of Ndongo ended in stalemate in the early 1680s; while on the Gold and Slave Coasts in West Africa, the Europeans’ rôle as suppliers of mercenaries did not give them much power.38 It has also been argued that on the north-west coast of North America and in Alaska the limitations of firearms and the nature of native warfare were such that firearms were not necessarily superior to traditional weapons.39 In 1810 a Portuguese force under Governor Villas Boas Truâo was destroyed at Boromo on the Upper Zambesi. In 1698 the leading Portuguese base in East Africa, Mombasa, fell to the Omani Arabs—who had captured Muscat from the Portuguese in 1650, developed a formidable navy with well-gunned warships, and sacked Diu in 1668. The Arabs had no siege artillery and the guns they had captured did little damage, but the Portuguese in Mombasa were badly hit by beri-beri and other diseases which led to the death of nine-tenths of the garrison. The siege began in 1696, when the garrison consisted of only 50 Portuguese soldiers and a force of loyal coast Arabs, but it was strengthened by relief forces brought by sea in late 1696 and September 1697. Regained, after a mutiny by African soldiers against Omani control, in 1728, Mombasa and the attendant suzerainty over the Swahili islands and states of East Africa—Pate, Pemba, Zanzibar and Malindi— 18\n\nTHE ROBERTS THESIS QUESTIONED\n\nwere lost again, in 1729: again the besiegers had no artillery and very few firearms, but the garrison capitulated as a result of low morale and problems with food supplies. In 1769 the Portuguese Governor of Mozambique failed to reconquer Mombasa.40 The French did not control Madagascar from the coastal base they established at Fort Dauphin in 1748, a post they had earlier been driven from, in 1674. On the other hand, the Dutch settlers in southern Africa defeated the Xhosa on the Fish River in 1781. The Xhosa, however, offered more serious resistance to Dutch expansion than the Khoi of the Cape region had done. In South Asia, Louis XIV’s intervention in Siam (Thailand) was unsuccessful, as was the attempt by both the British and the French to benefit from the Burmese civil war in the 1750s. The governor of the Portuguese base of Goa in western India was badly defeated by the Marathas at Ponda in 1683. An alliance of Goa and the British of Bombay was unable in 1721 to capture Culabo (Colabo) the principal base of the Angrias. In 1737–40 Goa was involved in a disastrous war with the Marathas which led to the loss of the Portuguese “Province of the North”: Bassein fell after a siege in 1739 and Goa nearly fell the same year. The British settlement of Balambangan in Borneo was destroyed in 1775 by a local uprising. In 1792 the British prudently refused a request from the Rajah of Nepal for assistance against Chinese military pressure, although the Ch’ing intervention cut off Tibet-Bengal trade and closed Bhutan to the British. Similarly, the decision was taken not to offer the Rajah of Kedah (in modern Malaysia) assistance against Siam even though the British had obtained Penang in 1786 by offering the prospect of such assistance. 41 Penang, like many European overseas bases, was not a powerful military position. Fort Louis on the Senegal River in West Africa was described in 1758 as “of no strength…the wall built with clay and soft brick plastered over…only embrazures for twelve [guns]”. Three years later, the British garrison there was decimated by disease.42 It is therefore possible to suggest the marginality of European military pressure in Africa and Asia. Many of the non-European states were powerful and aggressive. Even when the Europeans made gains they were not always preserved. In 1685 and again in 1686 the Chinese successfully besieged the Russian fortress of Albazin, and in 1689 Russia acknowledged Chinese control of the Amur Valley by the Treaty of Nerchinsk. In 1722 Peter the Great advanced along the Caspian Sea. Darband and Resht were occupied in 1722, Baku in 1723, and in 1723 Shah Tahmasp of Persia was persuaded to yield the provinces along the southern and western shores of the Caspian. A Persian revival and the loss of many soldiers to disease, however, led the Russians to abandon their gains by the Treaties of Resht (1729, 1732) and Gence (1735). Yet if the global territorial position in 1792 is compared with that in 1660, 19\n\nEUROPEAN WARFARE AND ITS GLOBAL CONTEXT\n\nthe gains of territory between European and non-European powers are overwhelmingly to the benefit of the former, and the land frontier between Christian and non-Christian Europe had changed dramatically. This was of crucial importance for Christian Europe. Up to 1683 the tide had flowed in the opposite direction. The Austr ian conquest of Hungary was the precondition of Austrian strength in the eighteenth century; indeed, the Austrian successes in the 1680s marked a major shift in the European balance of power against Louis XIV. Similarly, Russia was able to act effectively in part because its southern question had been radically altered: the issue was now how far it would be possible to advance. The successes against the Turks were crucial triumphs for the European “land powers”. As major contests between land powers, they were a reasonable test of military capability. The failures listed earlier were overwhelmingly those of amphibious power. Small settlements with limited maritime connections with distant home bases were only rarely the basis of imperial expansion in the eighteenth century, but the rationale of most of these positions was commercial rather than territorial, and indeed they were frequently controlled directly by trading companies. The Europeans faced serious difficulties when they sought transoceanic territorial expansion, but it would be mistaken to underrate their military power. In part their very difficulties, as in North America, came from the borrowing of European weaponry and, although to a lesser extent, tactics by their opponents. Native Americans learned to repair muskets, cast bullets and make gunflints.43 The Arab siege of Mombasa in 1698 was helped by Leonardo Nunes, a Portuguese gunner who deserted.44 The Omani fleet had already benefited from the use of European mariners and Portuguese captives, as well as from the assistance of Dutch and English navigators, gunners and ammunition. Europeans sold steel, iron, guns, arms, nails, anchors, fir-masts, copper and lead at Muscat.45 In West Africa in the eighteenth century almost all muskets, powder and shot were imported. Guns and related goods were an important trade good in purchasing slaves in particular, but also sometimes for cattle, gum arabic and grain, and as customs payments. There is little evidence that Europeans provided real training in the use of firearms, although Latsukaabe, the founder of the Geej dynasty in Senegambia in the 1690s, sought to borrow advisers to train soldiers in the use of firearms. Kings in the region showed a keen interest in seeing European troops and their local auxiliaries exercise in formation. The local auxiliaries were probably the key figures in the transfer of expertise. Since they worked seasonally for Europeans and were trained to use firearms in the riverboat convoys, they had ample opportunities to sell their expertise to local rulers. A similar transfer probably occurred all along 20\n\nTHE ROBERTS THESIS QUESTIONED\n\nthe West African coast, since all European forts and settlements employed local mercenaries or “castle slaves” as soldiers. For the kingdom of Kajoor in the Senegal Valley and some other West African states, including those on the Gold Coast, there is good evidence that troops ar med with muskets “exercised” and trained in formation. West African blacksmiths could make copies of flintlock muskets. They had little incentive to do so during the eighteenth century, but did in the nineteenth century during resistance to the colonial conquest. In both periods, the use of cannon was mainly confined to ships owned by African merchants on the Senegal and Niger. There are a few cases of Africans capturing European cannons and putting them to use, but field pieces were not sold to them. Casting cannon probably exceeded the capacities of local craftsmen, so that there was a European monopoly everywhere except on the river systems.46 European weaponry was also adopted elsewhere. In 1734 Nadir Shah was loaned Russian artillery and engineers disguised as Iranians, for the siege of Ganja.47 In 1787 the dynamic Bo-daw-hpaya, King of Burma, negotiated with the French at their Bengal base of Chandernagore in his search for Western arms. 48 In the early 1790s Jezzar Pasa of Palestine was reported to have obtained British arms, including field artillery, from the British Consul in Alexandria, for his effective army49 When in 1816 an American force attacked a base used by Creek Indians and fugitive slaves on the Apalachicola River in Florida they found a regularly constructed fortification built under the direction of a British colonel mounting 10 cannon with 3,200 firearms in the arsenal.50 Firearms were introduced to the north-west coast of North America by European and American traders in the 1780s and the willingness to trade firearms led the American Indians to substitute them for bows and arrows. The use of firearms was then spread by intertribal trade and the American Indians, who rapidly became expert in their use, used them for warfare among themselves and against whites as well.51 Similarly, firearms were introduced to New Zealand by European traders, and then used extensively by the Maoris in intertribal warfare in the early nineteenth century: the direction of influence was shown by the visit of Hongo Hika, a Maori chief, to Britain in 1820, in order to obtain muskets and a double-barrelled gun.52 Nevertheless, despite the borrowing of European techniques by nonEuropean peoples, the European colonial powers still had considerable success. The Indians and others who adopted European military methods did not do so with full success: there was a major difference between technology, which was relatively easy to acquire (though less so to copy proficiently), and technique, which was culturally based and therefore very difficult to adopt. This was particularly so in the case of tactical developments. In India, at least, when the Europeans ran into trouble, it was usually with local forces that had 21\n\nEUROPEAN WARFARE AND ITS GLOBAL CONTEXT\n\nadopted technique as well as technology. The willingness of Indian rulers to tur n to European military methods provided careers for a number of European soldiers. The most spectacular was George Thomas (c. 1756–1802), an Irishman who deserted from the British navy in 1781 and rose by 1799, through military command in Indian armies, to independent control of a substantial region between Delhi and the Punjab, including Hansi, Hissar and Sirsa. De Boigne, the French commander of the forces of Mahadji Shinde, who dominated Rajastan and Delhi in 1790–4, was given a large personal estate. The forces he trained in European methods were 24,000-strong with 130 cannon in 1792, and the cannon were used to destroy the military effectiveness of fortresses.53 Thomas’s state was to collapse under the onslaught of attacks from neighbouring Indian rulers, including European-officered forces, but there was no equivalent in Europe of a non-European adventurer being able to rise so high: there was no military need and the political culture was different. The closest equivalents were in Turkey: in this state, geographically part of Europe but culturally, socially and politically different, largely as a result of Islam, foreigners could rise very high. The cosmopolitanism of Christian Europe ensured that foreigners could rise, but this did not extent to non-Christians. The Russians, in particular, employed foreign experts, but these had to be Christians and there was no possibility of them gaining independent power. Military skill and success could, however, lead to rapid social ascent, most obviously in the forces of Revolutionary and Napoleonic France. Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte rose from being an ordinary soldier to the position of a Marshal of France (1804) before becoming heir to the Swedish throne (1810) and King Charles XIV (1818–44). The gap between Turkey’s military capability and that of its European rivals was such that in the eighteenth century there was considerable episodic interest in acquiring the latter’s expertise. Claude-Alexandre, Comte de Bonneval (1675–1747), a French noble who had fallen out successively with Louis XIV and Prince Eugene, converted to Islam and sought to Westernize the Turkish army in the 1730s. Significantly, he also sought to modernize the manufacture of munitions and in 1734 opened a military engineering school. The conservatism of the Turkish military, however, finally nullified his efforts. Other foreign advisers were brought in by Sultan Abdulhamit I (r. 1774–89), who did not require them to convert and adopt Ottoman ways. Baron François deTott (1730–93), a Hungarian noble who had risen in the French artillery, was influential in the 1770s; however, he did not convert to Islam. In 1774 he established a new rapid-fire artillery corps, and he also built a modern cannon foundry and a new mathematics school.54 In south-east and south Asia the European colonial powers had important 22\n\nTHE ROBERTS THESIS QUESTIONED\n\ngains. The Dutch East India Company was not invariably successful, but it did succeed in extending considerably its territorial powers in Java, in part through the co-operation of local rulers,55 although control there was only established in the nineteenth century. Elsewhere in Indonesia, despite the financial problems of the Dutch Company, it was still able to hold its own: in 1759 Rajah Muhammad of Siak destroyed the Dutch post at Pulau Gontong, but in 1761 a Dutch punitive expedition avenged the massacre and placed the Rajah s brother on the throne. In 1784 the Bugis’s siege of Malacca was unsuccessful: the Dutch relieved their post, captured Riau and forced the Sultan of RiauJohor to become in effect their vassal. Dutch expansion was aimed at maximizing profits, not at occupying territory. The idea was to control by indirect rule, or by deterrence, and to prevent competitors from taking over. A minimal military presence, and the use of local levies and allies, was usually sufficient. Occasionally the situation turned out otherwise, and a punitive expedition was sent to restore Dutch authority. In south-east Asia as a whole the use of firearms by non-Europeans was very extensive, but the volley technique was not adopted: the war elephant, pikes, swords and spears being still the dominant weaponry, firearms made little impact on tactics, and by the eighteenth century the south-east Asians had abandoned the attempt to keep pace with new developments in the production of both firearms and gunpowder. Thus wheel lock and flintlock mechanisms were not reproduced in south-east Asian foundries.56 Developments in India were more dramatic. The British succeeded in becoming the dominant power in both Bengal and South India, regions where the combined population far exceeded that of Britain. Small forces, composed of British troops and, more numerous, British-trained Indians, defeated vastly larger numbers of Indians at Plassey (1757), Patna (1764) and Buxar (1764). At Patna (3 May 1764) British grapeshot halted the advance of hostile infantry and when a cavalry attack was launched by the Indians, “a severe fire of artillery soon drove them back…we lost few men, but the enemy’s loss was very great”. At Buxar (23 October 1764), Sir Hector Munro and 7,000 men of the East India Company army, including 1,500 Europeans, defeated Mir Kasim, the Nawab of Bengal, the Mughal Emperor and the Wazir of Awadh, and a force of 50,000. The Indian army had more cannon and used them to considerable effect, but British firepower was superior and grapeshot and bayonets blocked the Indian cavalry. The Indians were driven from the field, although the battle lasted three hours and Munro’s force lost heavily: 733 killed, wounded and missing, including 69 Europeans. The victory was followed by the Treaty of Allahabad (1765) by which the British position in Bengal, Bihar and Orissa was recognized. British military power led to a clear sense of superiority, as in 1788 when 23\n\nEUROPEAN WARFARE AND ITS GLOBAL CONTEXT\n\nthe Commander-in-Chief and Gover nor-General, Charles, 2nd Earl Cornwallis, proposed to pursue Britain’s claim to the Circar of Guntur (Guntoor) against the Nizam of Hyderabad by force, using diplomacy simply to secure the settlement: it will be most expedient that our troops should march into the Circar on Captain Kennaway’s arrival at Masulipatam; and that our present Resident Meer Hussein should about ten days before inform the Nizam of our intention, giving the most positive assurances that our design was entirely limited to the taking possession of the Circar as our undoubted right by treaty. This was very much the language of a general confident of his power, and the result justified Cornwallis’ optimism. The value of the European model of warfare was shortly afterwards to be demonstrated again in both Indo-China and southern India; although the British also encountered major problems, both with the artillery of the Marathas in 1803 and with the strength of popular resistance in the rebellion of the Palassi Raja in Wynad, a conflict in which mobile British columns sought to suppress guerrilla warfare, succeeding in 1806 only after eight years of conflict.57 The problems of France, already in political and serious financial difficulties, prevented her government in 1788 from fulfilling treaty commitments to send forces to the assistance of Nguyen Anh (1762–1820), son of one of the claimants to Cochin-China (the area around the Mekong). Nguyen Anh, who was initially dependent on Chinese pirates and Cambodian mercenaries, captured Saigon in 1788. In place of royal forces, he received only French arms and a small number of advisers, hired with the help of French merchants. Nevertheless, in 1789–92, the advisers trained his troops in European methods of war and helped Nguyen Anh to conquer Cochin-China. Olivier du Puymanel was responsible for the army, Jean Marie Dayot for the navy. The Tay Son capital at Hué was captured in 1801. By 1802 the whole ofVietnam had been united under one ruler for the first time in its history, and Nguyen Anh proclaimed himself Emperor Gia-long ofVietnam.58 In southern India, another dynamic power, Mysore, was crushed by the British in 1791–2 and 1799. The ability of Britain to do so was an indication not only of the global reach of its power, but also of the flexibility of European forces in the period. The British army succeeded in combining the firepower that was so effective against Mysore’s fortresses with a reasonable degree of mobility. Cornwallis had stressed the value of mobility from the outset. In January 1787 he wrote, “no man in India can be more convinced than I am of the importance of cavalry to our armies”, and later that year he added: 24\n\nTHE ROBERTS THESIS QUESTIONED\n\nI found, in the extensive field in which I acted during my command in the Southern provinces of America, very great advantage from mounting about eighty or an hundred men on ordinary horses, to act with the Cavalry; By this means I could venture to detach my cavalry and strike an unexpected blow at a very considerable distance from my army. It occurs to me, that in case of an invasion of the Carnatic, you might find a corps of this sort picked from your European infantry… very useful. It would not only protect the cavalry when detached in their camp or quarters, and assist them when harassed by swarms of irregular horse in the field, but it would enable you frequently either by surprise at night, or ambuscade, to punish considerable parties of plunderers, who are employed in laying waste the country.59 Once war had broken out with Tipu Sultan of Mysore in 1790, Cornwallis stressed the importance both of cavalry and of bullocks to move the artillery,60 themes voiced earlier by Sir Eyre Coote in the Second Mysore War (1780–4). Britain’s failure to obtain victory in the First Mysore War (1768–9) was attributed to a lack of cavalry. Like Coote, Cornwallis was also well aware of the logistical problems. He wrote to the Prime Minister, William Pitt the Younger, “it is no easy task to provide for the subsistence of vast multitudes in a distant desert”. 61 The Marathas and the Nizam of Hyderabad provided important assistance, especially in cavalry and supplies, but their forces were less valuable than had been anticipated, in part because the Marathas did not wish to see Mysore crushed. Cornwallis was not able to rely on their support and there was criticism of the quality of their cavalry and artillery.62 Cornwallis’s success can be compared with that of the Russians in the Russo-Turkish wars of 1768–74 and 1787–92. In both conflicts the Russians were able to overrun the Turkish possessions north of the Danube, seize their major fortress, and cross the river. In 1791 Russian victories over the Turks in advances across the Danube at Babadag and Machin revealed the vulnerability of Sultan Selim III; his army was largely destroyed and he accepted Russian peace preliminaries. The following year Captain Sidney Smith was sent by the British government to Constantinople on a secret mission in order to report on the Turkish military position and “to consider the means which the Russians may appear to him to have of making an impression upon Constantinople, or any other part of the Turkish Empire, by any attack made from the Black Sea, either by their naval force, or by an army landed near to Constantinople, and acting in concert with their fleet”.63 The “Eastern Question” had certainly begun. The extent of the Russian military achievement has been challenged. Gunther Rothenberg has argued, with reference to campaigns in 1789–90 and 25\n\nEUROPEAN WARFARE AND ITS GLOBAL CONTEXT\n\n1794, that “Suvorov’s reputation rested on his victories over the poorly disciplined and rather backward forces of the Ottoman Empire and Poland … His strategy was primitive, calling for an attack on the enemy wherever he was found, and his tactics, based on the cult of the bayonet, were outdated and wasteful when delivered against troops relying on fire”. This analysis, however, underrates the problems of campaigning in eastern Europe and mistakenly implies that there is a clear continuum of achievement in military method in the light of which it is readily possible to assess what was “primitive”. Detailed studies of Russian warfare have been more positive. Russian military success has been attributed to grasping the necessary interrelationship of “tactics, operations, and logistics”, in order to pursue a “strategy of annihilation” furthered by the use of compact mobile forces drawing on advanced bases and supply magazines, by reliance on stor ming fortresses rather than on conventional sieges, and by a “credible offensive formation”: the battlefield use of mutually supporting squares, attacking in an articulated fashion and benefiting from crossfire. Similarly, it was “gun-power that decided the issue” between Russian and Turkish naval forces near Ochakov in 1788: larger Turkish fleets were defeated by more heavily gunned Russian ships.64 In his History of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire (London, 1776–88), the greatest historical work of the century, the British historian Edward Gibbon claimed that civilization had led to science, and that “cannon and fortifications now form an impregnable barrier against the Tartar horse”. In an interesting recent comparison of Roman frontier operations in 4th-century Gaul and those of the British on the north-west frontier of India in 1878– 1919, Hugh Elton focuses on similar issues. He argues that neither the Romans nor the British possessed a technological edge of any value until, during the Third Afghan War (1919), the British were able to use portable radios, air power, lorries, armoured cars and mobile machine guns.65 The combination of mobility and firepower was also crucial in the eighteenth century: the distances to be covered to the north and west of the Black Sea or in India were immense, and certainly different from those covered by most European armies campaigning in Germany, Italy and the Low Countries between 1660 and 1779. The scholarly focus on European warfare in that period has always been on those regions, and it is not surprising that this has led to a less than full appreciation of warfare in the period. In particular, there has been a neglect of the more mobile warfare that was characteristic of eastern Europe and of extra-European offensive operations. This is possibly a reflection of a historiographical bias in favour not only of western and central European warfare but, more markedly, in both German works and those of Anglo-American scholars heavily influenced by German suppositions, in favour of the notion that Frederick II represented the highest point of ancien régime 26\n\nTHE ROBERTS THESIS QUESTIONED\n\nwarfare. Arguably, this is misleading in terms of the European forces competing in western and central Europe in the Frederician period, not least through leading to a relative neglect of the French under Saxe and the Austrians under Daun. It also underrates the potential diversity of warfare in western and central Europe, a diversity that was to be underlined from 1792 as Frederician linear tactics were shown to be at a disadvantage in the face of troops fighting in open order in the enclosed and wooded country of the Austr ian Netherlands and eastern France. Furthermore, such a notion also leads to a treatment of warfare outside this region as largely peripheral. However, if the global and military significance of the second stage of the early modern “military revolution” is to be grasped, it is necessary to look at that warfare. It has to be considered both on land and on sea, for scholars mostly concerned with Frederician warfare and more generally with that of the eighteenth century have tended to neglect the naval side—and yet it is clear that the concept of a military revolution must address it. As yet much of the work necessary for a general re-evaluation of extraEuropean warfare in the period has not been carried out, but a number of points emerge from a preliminary consideration. First, it is necessary not to assume that success is measured simply through the conquest of territory: as ever, it is important to consider the purposes of military force(s), not least their cost-effectiveness. In evaluating the degree of success of seventeenth-and eighteenth-century extra-European warfare it is necessary to note that the ambitions of the European powers were generally limited in scope and their commitment of military resources commonly slight, not least in comparison with the deployment of such resources in Europe. For example, the French military rôle in their new colony of Louisiana can be presented as impressive. In 1699 Biloxi Fort (Fort Maurepas) was constructed to guard the access to the Mississippi. It had four bastions constructed of logs, three of them mounted with cannon. The following year more artillery was added and Fort Mississippi was constructed and in 1702 Fort Louis (later Mobile) was laid out with bastions and batteries. Yet Fort Mississippi, which had no real fortifications—only a 15-man garrison with a small cannon on an elevated bank—was abandoned in 1706–7; Fort Maurepas, which had had 12 cannon and 12 swivel guns by the end of 1700, was also abandoned; the disease-ridden colony’s garrison was no more than 45 in 1706, and in 1710 the wood at Fort Louis was so rotted by humidity and decay that the cannon could not be supported. The garrison suffered from an absence of fresh meat, from insufficient swords, cartridge boxes, nails, guns, and powder, from demoralization and desertion, and no hospital; and the survival of the colony rested on acceptance by local Indians. Further afield, the French in 1715 sent a garrison of only 20 to Michilimackinac and planned only ten for 27\n\nEUROPEAN WARFARE AND ITS GLOBAL CONTEXT\n\nDetroit.66 In 1719 a French force of seven captured theTexan mission of San Miguel de los Adaes, whose sole Spanish soldier was unaware that the two powers were at war, and the 25 Spanish soldiers in East Texas abandoned it. The force that recaptured it in 1721 was the largest Spain would ever send into Texas: about 500-strong. Over the following century Apache raiders of Spain’s frontier positions in North Amer ica enjoyed numer ical super ior ity. Nevertheless, the by then 800-strong French force in Louisiana succeeded in crushing the Natchez Indians in 1729–31.67 There was a general emphasis on trade, profit and influence, rather than on the “white man’s burden” imperialism of much of the nineteenth century with its stress on territorial control. The latter itself sometimes ended in military disaster despite even greater technological superiority over less advanced adversaries, as with the British defeat by the Afghans in 1842, by the Zulus at Isandlwana (1879), and by the Maoris (1845–7, 1860–72); the Italian defeat by the Ethiopians at Adowa (1896); the French defeat in Indo-China at Lang Son (1885); and the Spanish defeats in Morocco at Anual (1921) and Sidi Messaoud (1924). Secondly, military effectiveness could also be demonstrated in defence, a point that is often overlooked. Fortified strongholds and warships ensured that the structure of European trade and control outside Europe had considerable defensive strength. It is also important to direct attention to extra-oceanic struggles between European powers; and, in the case of the Thirteen Colonies, peoples. It is readily apparent, for example, that the strength and flexibility of the Spanish system in the New World has been underrated. This was in part demonstrated by the advance of New Spain: against the Araucanian Indians in Chile, in the modern south-west of America, and in the Yucatan, where in the 1690s the Mayas were brought under Spanish control. The ability of Spain to resist the pressure of other states, particularly Br itain, was a clearer demonstration of the strength of the Spanish position. In the New World, Spain created a generally successful defensive system based on regular army units and fortifications supported by militia, to which blacks were increasingly recruited from 1764.68 This was a system well adapted to the logistical, environmental and ecological problems of warfare in the tropics; and when Spain gained Louisiana after the Seven Years’War the colony’s defences were reorganized accordingly. Spanish control over the production of firearms was also important. In 1780, for example, at Arequipa in Peru it was superior firepower that led to the defeat of local rebels armed with lances, sticks and the traditional Andean weapon, the sling. Superior firepower was also important in 1811 in the defeat in Louisiana of the largest slave revolt to take place in the United States: the rebels were largely armed with agricultural implements. Nevertheless, non-European forces could succeed in 28\n\nTHE ROBERTS THESIS QUESTIONED\n\nthe New World, as with the failure of Spain in the 1770s to subdue the Guajiros Indians of the Guajiro Peninsula of modern Columbia.69 Despite the problems of controlling regions of difficult terrain, the major challenges to Spain’s military position in the New World came from other European powers and, increasingly, from her own subjects. These were both thwarted in the eighteenth century, but were to be more effective in the early nineteenth century.70 The Spanish base of Havana was the site of an important naval dockyard. The navios and frigates built there from the durable local cedar and mahogany woods proved strong and long-lasting ships. Furthermore, the Spanish military system in the New World was also effective in attack, as was demonstrated with the conquest of British West Florida during the American War of Independence.71 Consideration of the Spaniards in the New World is valuable because it underlines the flexibility of European military models. The same point also emerges from consideration of warfare in North America, before, during and after the War of American Independence.72 The flexibility of the Americans in using their colonial exper ience of warfare is the point commonly underlined, but it is also the case that the British varied their tactics. A more open, less packed, two-deep line was adopted in the middle colonies because of the relative unimportance of cavalry. In the South the British under Cornwallis sought to make their forces more mobile. Tarleton’s infantry advanced to the Waxhaws on horseback and attacked “cavalry and infantry blended”. 73 The eventual British failure atYorktown in 1781 has distorted the analysis of the campaigns in the South. Lieutenant-Colonel Archibald Campbell’s rapid capture of Savannah in 1778, General Augustine Prevost’s success in routing a North Carolina force at Briar Creek in 1779 by attacking it from the rear and his advance on Charleston in 1779, General Sir Henry Clinton’s encirclement and successful siege of Charleston in 1780, and General Earl Cornwallis’s success at Camden that year and his march across North Carolina in early 1781, were evidence of British flexibility and mobility, as was Clinton’s flanking manoeuvre at Brandywine in 1778. In the West Indies in 1794–5, during the French Revolutionary War, the British used specially raised units of slaves, with European commanders, capable of moving rapidly and acting as light infantry. The notion that mobility on campaign and the value of the attack in battle were not rediscovered until the Revolutionary Wars is, therefore, misleading. It does not describe adequately campaigning in western and central Europe, where there were striking examples of mobility. John, Duke of Marlborough’s march to the Rhine in 1704 is the best known, but there were other instances of rapid movement over considerable distances, for example some of the movements of Frederick II and Prince Henry of Prussia during the Seven 29\n\nEUROPEAN WARFARE AND ITS GLOBAL CONTEXT\n\nYears’ War. The improvement of European roads during the century further aided mobility; when the use of crushed stone to create a durable, all-weather road surface was developed. As already implied, the ability of European forces to solve the tactical and strategic problems of warfare a world away from the parade-ground conventions of western and central Europe was instrumental in the decisive driving back of the Turks and in the establishment of Britain as a territorial power in India. It is therefore pertinent to stress innovation, change and impact when considering warfare in the period 1660–1792. The destruction of Cossack independence by the Russians in the Ukraine was symptomatic of this process. What was until then, in effect, an independent warrior people was brought under control by the “Westernized” military units of Peter I’s army. In 1709 the Cossack headquarters at Stara Sich was destroyed.74 The Cossacks were permitted to establish a new centre at Nova Sich, but that was also destroyed, in 1775, and the whole of Zaporozhia was made part of an imperial province known as New Russia. In this case, military strength was indeed linked to centralization and state expansion, a crucial theme in the early modern “Military Revolution”. Change and impact must also be stressed in the case of naval power. In 1788 Cornwallis wrote, with reference to a proposed attack on the French in India, “unless we have a fleet capable of looking the enemy in the face, we must not hazard a considerable body of troops”. Naval power was crucial to imperial expansion and consolidation, and in military terms there was a significant expansion in amphibious capability, the basis of imperial expansion in the nineteenth century. Amphibious operations faced serious problems,75 many of which were not resolved, but nevertheless substantial forces were sent considerable distances, as when the British captured Manila in 1762 or New York in 1776. 76 The crucial nature of ar my-navy co-operation was demonstrated in theYorktown campaign of 1781, the reach of naval power by the establishment of the first European settlement in Australia in 1788. Two years later, during the Nootka Sound controversy, as earlier during the War of American Independence, the British considered far-flung attacks on the Spanish empire. They established a base on the Andaman Islands in 1789. The French were also active, charting the coast of Asia in the 1780s and sending naval expeditions into the Indian and Pacific oceans, while this was also a period of Spanish activity in the Pacific and of the expansion of Russian power on North America’s Pacific littoral.77 Major naval changes in the 1750–90 period were significant in this context. Substantial increases in the size of warships and also in their width in relation to their length made them far more seaworthy and hence much more able to undertake operations across the oceans. It was thus possible to have so many fleet battles in Caribbean, North American and Indian waters during the War of 30\n\nTHE ROBERTS THESIS QUESTIONED\n\nAmerican Independence; and also to continue operations in European waters into the winter months when the first and second rates had had to be laid up in the past. The coppering of hulls made warships more seaworthy, enabling them to operate over longer distances and for longer periods. By vastly reducing the need for frequent hull repairs and refits, this substantially increased the size of the operational (in proportion to the nominal) fleets. Other infrastructural developments had similar effects: the great expansion of the naval dockyards at Portsmouth and Plymouth between 1763 and 1790; the further expansion of those of Spain under Charles III, the development of systems of overseas naval bases; and the far greater concern shown for the health of crews (including the building by the British and Spanish of vast naval hospitals). All these increased the ability to keep ships and crews at sea and increased the intensity of naval warfare. There were already significant developments in signalling thanks to British admirals Kempenfelt and Howe, even before these reached their culmination in the 1790s, which increased the control admirals had over their squadrons. The naval changes of the period 1750–90 were more important than those of 1793– 1815, which largely saw the working out of the former. The British campaign against the native Caribs of St. Vincent in the West Indies in 1772–3 provided an indication of the global potential of European power. It was not easy for European forces to operate in St. Vincent. Major General William Dalrymple wrote to the Secretary at War at the start of the campaign: Your Lordship is doubtless too well acquainted with the natural and uncommon strength of this island to doubt that a vigorous opposition may be expected. The fatality attending the climate at this season particularly joined with the numbers of the savages, present difficulties only to be overcome by our utmost diligence and perseverance. By the end of the year Dalrymple had reached the end of the existing road: “no white man has ever been in their concealed places of retirement… neither guides nor intelligence can be procured…this fatal climate”. Yet, despite losses through ambushes and by “the neglect of a villainous set of surgeons”, Dalrymple obtained a satisfactory treaty. The British had 636 casualties, 394 of them “sick”, but what was striking was their ability to deploy a force of over 2,000 effectives. Troops had been moved from North America and from elsewhere in the West Indies, their returns indicated that they were armed with good, new flintlocks and that Britain could afford the cost of the expedition.78 In 1795 the Caribs rose in response to encouragement from the Revolutionary French, but in 1796 they were defeated and forcibly expelled from St. Vincent after bush-fighting and the destruction of their homes and provision grounds.79 31\n\nEUROPEAN WARFARE AND ITS GLOBAL CONTEXT\n\nThe potential gap between European military capability and that of nonEuropean peoples was demonstrated most clearly in the Pacific, not only in Australia but also in eastern Indonesia. Captain John Blankett sailed through the Moluccas in December 1790 and found “the natives…were all armed with spears and shields, and all on horseback”. He was, however, unimpressed by the Dutch fort on Timor that he visited: “a miserable band, composed of a few German deserters and Malays compose a sort of garrison”. Blankett noted that the Dutch preserved their position by exploiting the rivalries of the rulers of Timor. 80 This was scarcely a picture of unrivalled European supremacy, but Blankett’s very voyage demonstrated that the European powers were taking the initiative. Similarly, in central Amazonia in the 1760s and 1770s, the Portuguese were unable to defeat the guerilla attacks of the mobile Mura with their ambushes of Portuguese canoes and their attacks on isolated settlements. The Muras did not learn the use of firearms, but were very effective with their bows and arrows. Nevertheless, the Muras could not defeat the Portuguese and the peace they sought in 1784 appears to have reflected the need to reach an accommodation with colonial power. 81 In 1765–9 the Portuguese were also successful in conflict with native tribes in south Mozambique. To conclude, the “revolutionary” periods were c. 1470–c. 1530, c. 1660– c.1720 and (primarily because of the levée en masse rather than tactics) 1792– 1815. Roberts’ emphasis on 1560–1660 is incorrect. Equally, though 1660– 1720 and 1792–1815 might be per iods of fairly dramatic change, the intervening era was not static and unchanging, neither on land nor at sea. Historians, with the obvious exception of Parker, have tended to neglect the significance of European conflict in the wider world. The significance of the lessons of colonial warfare, however, were often lost on contemporaries in Europe. Leaving aside the wider historical significance of European overseas expansion in the eighteenth century, the military impact on the way European wars were fought was often slight.
