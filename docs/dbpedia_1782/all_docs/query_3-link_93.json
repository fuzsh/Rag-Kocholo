        "text": "Citation preview\n\n‘An excellent, accessible and highly lucid account of the vital role played by the Royal Navy in British success during the Seven Years War. It situates naval and maritime power firmly at the centre of British grand strategy in this, the first truly global conflict.’ – Jeremy Black, Professor of History, University of Exeter ‘The Seven Years War proved a major turning point in the Royal Navy’s rise to the dominant position it secured in the age of Nelson. The naval achievements in this long war are often overlooked because there was no single decisive battle at sea. Martin Robson fills this gap for the general reader by providing a clear picture of the scale and sweep of naval operations and the impact of naval power during the conflict. Drawing on recent work in this field and on his own incisive insights, Robson offers a highly readable and vigorous interpretation of the Royal Navy’s extraordinarily wide-ranging contribution to the war. The hazards of war, the challenges of command, and the effort required to stage joint operations are graphically described. He is very effective in linking naval activity of many different kinds to the larger question of what strategic objectives naval power served. Robson stresses the vital role played by the navy in enabling Britain to defeat the French in North America and India and establish itself as a truly global imperial power. By blending together the overall political purposes of deploying naval forces with vivid accounts of naval actions, Robson succeeds in introducing the reader to a dynamic, successful and probably decisive period of British naval history.’ – Bruce Collins, Professor of Modern History, Sheffield Hallam University\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 01_Seven_Years_War_Prelims.3d Page 5 of 24\n\nvi\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 01_Seven_Years_War_Prelims.3d Page 6 of 24\n\nList of Illustrations I.1 I.2 I.3 I.4 1.1 1.2 1.3 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7\n\n2.8 3.1\n\nThe execution of Admiral Byng, 14 March 1757 (NMM/RMG) The death of General Wolfe (National Gallery of Canada) William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham (Government Art Collection) The Duke of Newcastle (Government Art Collection) Admiral Edward Boscawen (NMM/RMG) The capture of the Alcide and Lys, 8 June 1755 (NMM/RMG) Lord Anson (NMRN) Admiral Byng (NMRN) The Battle of Minorca: Byng’s Fleet, led by the Deﬁance, closing with the French (at the top of the plan) (NMRN) About 14:30 and the van of the British fleet has failed to close with the French (NMRN) About 15:00 and Byng’s fleet has divided in two (NMRN) The fleets about 17:00.

Often it has been the principal – sometimes the only – means of defending British interests around the world. In peacetime the Royal Navy carries out a multitude of tasks as part of government policy – showing the flag, or naval diplomacy as it is now often called. In wartime, as the senior service of Britain’s armed forces, the navy has taken the war to the enemy, by battle, by economic blockade or by attacking hostile territory from the sea. Adversaries have changed over the centuries. Old rivals have become today’s alliance partners; the types of ship, the weapons within them and the technology – the ‘how’ of naval combat – have also changed. But fundamentally what the navy does has not changed. It exists to serve Britain’s government and its people, to protect them and their interests wherever they might be threatened in the world. This series, through the numerous individual books within it, throws new light on almost every aspect of Britain’s Royal Navy: its ships, its people, the technology, the wars and peacetime operations too, from the birth of the modern navy following the restoration of Charles II to the throne in the late seventeenth century to the war on terror in the early twenty-first century. The series consists of three chronologically themed books covering the sailing navy from the 1660s until 1815, the navy in the nineteenth century from the end of the Napoleonic Wars, and the navy since 1900. These are complemented by a number of slightly shorter books which examine the navy’s part in particular wars, such as the Seven Years War, the American Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars, World War I, World War II and the\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 01_Seven_Years_War_Prelims.3d Page 15 of 24\n\nxvi\n\nThe Seven Years War\n\nCold War, or particular aspects of the service: the navy and empire, the Women’s Royal Naval Service, the Royal Marines, naval aviation and the submarine service. The books are standalone works in their own right, but when taken as a series present the most comprehensive and readable history of the Royal Navy. Duncan Redford National Museum of the Royal Navy The role in Britain’s history of the Royal Navy is all too easily and too often overlooked; this series will go a long way to redressing the balance. Anyone with an interest in British history in general or the Royal Navy in particular will find this series an invaluable and enjoyable resource.

Geoff Till’s conceptual work on seapower remains a valuable theoretical way into any period of naval history. Once again, the thinking power of the ‘Corbettians’ of the Corbett Centre for Maritime Policy Studies, notably Greg Kennedy, Jon Robb-Webb, Andrew Gordon, Tim Benbow and Harry Dickinson, helped over a number of years to clarify my thinking about the way to approach writing about seapower and naval history as implemented in this book. The passion of Niall Barr and Chris Tuck for all things related to the land aspects of the Seven Years War have provided a useful tonic for balancing out a naval viewpoint. My former PhD supervisor, Andrew Lambert, the Laughton Professor of Naval History at King’s College London will always be a source of much inspiration. At the University of Exeter Jeremy Black and the Academic Director of the Strategy and Security Institute, Patrick Porter, have provided much stimulating discussion regarding concepts of ‘grand strategy’.

Here the patience, advice and insightful comments of my series editor, Duncan Redford has been invaluable. Seventy thousand words is not much to cover the world’s first truly global conflict and his steady hand on the tiller has helped me to separate the vital from the mere interesting. Of course, any errors that remain are my own. Today, when so much that the Royal Navy does happens out of sight of the general public, it is a hard task to convince people that navies matter. As a society we forget that states did, and still do, build navies to fight and, as Carl von Clausewitz reminds us, that is about violence, bloodshed and killing. We are, thankfully, a world away from the character of global conflict of two and a half centuries ago. Writing about such events can become all-consuming as one wrestles with problems with sources, interpretation, structure and even missing footnotes. Inevitably at such times Charlotte, Horatio and Lysander provide much welcome support, inspiration and perspective. This book is dedicated to them with much love and heartfelt thanks.\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 01_Seven_Years_War_Prelims.3d Page 18 of 24\n\nMap 1.

It was inscribed ‘The Hon. John Byng, Esqr. Died March 14th 1757’. The Honourable John Byng, Member of Parliament for Rochester and Vice Admiral in the Royal Navy was not dead, at least not yet. Later that morning Byng came on board the Monarch, wearing a light grey coat. Just before 12:00 he was on the quarterdeck. Byng threw his hat to the ground, knelt down on a cushion sodden from the rain and tied a white handkerchief over his eyes before dropping a second white handkerchief from his right hand. At this signal, a party of Royal Marines in their scarlet uniforms a mere six feet away unleashed a volley of lead into Admiral Byng. Even at such close range, one ball missed its target. Monarch’s log for that Monday states: ‘at 12 Mr Byng was shot dead by 6 Marines and put into his coffin.’1 Byng had been sent to save the British garrison on Minorca from a French expedition but the entire effort to relieve Minorca was implemented in a hasty fashion. Byng’s ships were compromised by other operational pressures, for his expedition played second fiddle to the desire of the First Lord of the Admiralty, Admiral George Anson, to keep a strong force in home waters. Nevertheless, Byng had enough ships to make an impact and he engaged a French fleet, but the action was tactically mishandled. Byng then lost his nerve and retired to Gibraltar. That decision allowed the French fleet covering the invasion force to leave unmolested. As a direct result Minorca fell to the French. The public had expected a more glorious outcome to the naval battle, and when his dispatches were published by the government they were carefully edited to lay the blame upon Byng. The result was a political 1\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 02_Seven_Years_War_Intro.3d Page 1 of 10\n\n2\n\nThe Seven Years War\n\nFig. I.1. The execution of Admiral Byng, 14 March 1757\n\nand public outcry. Byng was court martialled and although cleared of personal cowardice he was found guilty of ‘failing to do his utmost’ to engage the French. The mandatory sentence was death. With friends in high places Byng could expect some leniency, but fanned by the public, press and government the situation had developed a momentum of its own. Hung out to dry by the politicians and the subject of scorn from the general public, Byng met his fate with quiet dignity. ‘It is thought good to kill an admiral from time to time to encourage the others’ quipped Voltaire.2 Byng had certainly not been dealt the best hand, but his unwillingness to bring about a second fleet action was the reason he was found guilty. This is important. A contemporary of Byng’s was Admiral Edward Boscawen who wryly wrote of Byng’s failure at Minorca: ‘I find courage of more worth than I thought it, but if a chief does not show example, the cause will hardly ever succeed’. A nation that was reliant upon a favourable position at sea for its economic well-being needed aggressive naval actions to negate the threat posed by enemy fleets. That required men who were up to the job, who displayed the moral courage to take aggressive action.3 The loss of Minorca and Byng’s execution coincided with apparent naval ineptitude, for between 1755 and 1757 the war went badly for\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 02_Seven_Years_War_Intro.3d Page 2 of 10\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nBritain with much of the blame falling on the Royal Navy. In contrast, the French achieved much success, capturing Minorca and deterring a British attack on Louisbourg in 1757. Not only would French success at sea raise the perennial threat of an invasion of the British Isles, it would also hit Britain where it hurt most: in the pocket. The smooth running of the British Empire, British overseas commercial interests and the whole British war effort during the Seven Years War were dependent upon the success of the Royal Navy. But by the time Byng was executed on HMS Monarch, British success in the war seemed a very distant prospect. In order to understand why that came about it is important to assess what the Seven Years War was actually about for Britain and the Royal Navy. From the Hugli river to the St Lawrence, from Manila to Havana, from the Coromandel Coast to Canada, for Britain the Seven Years War was fought on a global scale across four continents: North America, Europe, Asia and Africa. The war has often been labelled as the first global conflict, but this is only in part true. It was only the AngloFrench conflict (and from 1762 the Anglo-Spanish conflict) within the wider Seven Years War that was fought on a global scale. For the other key protagonists in Europe or for indigenous peoples in North America or India it was a more localised conflict. But, in that sense, it was a localised conflict which was enabled or influenced by the character of the wider Anglo-French war. The European theatre, which witnessed some of history’s famous battles such as Leuthen, Rossbach and Minden, often takes centre stage in assessing the conflict. Moreover, mention of the Seven Years War inevitably, and usually very quickly, leads to discussion of the campaigns of Frederick the Great and Prussia’s existential struggle with Austria, Russia, France and Sweden which tends to dominate the historiography of the war. Even within this historiographical centre of gravity, the subsidiary operations of an army, British-funded and eventually containing British troops, in Germany under Ferdinand of Brunswick often seems far less important. Yet for British statesman that was not the case – the operations of Ferdinand’s army and support to Frederick were two parts of the same strand of British grand strategy to protect the electorate of Hanover from France. This was the prime British war object in Europe, for French possession of Hanover would entail the exchange of colonial territory to\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 02_Seven_Years_War_Intro.3d Page 3 of 10\n\n4\n\nThe Seven Years War\n\nobtain its freedom at a peace table, comprising Britain’s wider global interests. In 1754–6 Britain was a country that was still very much ‘European’ in outlook. By 1763 that had changed, Britain was an ‘imperial’ power trying to balance European and colonial concerns. The war was, therefore, for Britain about ‘the great contest for maritime empire’ and it relied on the Royal Navy.4 In European and colonial theatres the key factor in the British approach to fighting the war, and hence Britain’s wider imperial development, was the Royal Navy. Closely related to Britain’s development as an imperial power are two further considerations. The first is to place the operations of the Royal Navy in their European and colonial contexts. But this is only part of the story, for while what the Royal Navy did is important, the crucial aspect is why that mattered. In other words, what role did the Royal Navy play in British success in the war? That entails an assessment far beyond a ‘naval’ context, involving British policy, diplomacy, economics and strategy as well as the operations of the British armed forces. This final point is very important, for the three most famous ‘British’ battles of the Seven Years War, Plassey (1757), Minden and Quebec (in 1759 the Annus Mirabilis or Year of Victories), at first seem very much army-centric. Minden, fought by Ferdinand’s army in Germany, appears the most landlocked, but as we shall see Ferdinand’s operations were very much supported by the Royal Navy. The second, Plassey, gave the British control of Bengal and laid the foundations for the expansion of British India. In fact, the context of Robert Clive’s battle was not only set by the Royal Navy, but his operations were dependent upon naval superiority. Finally we come to James Wolfe and Quebec, often seen as a victory for the British army led by Wolfe’s inspirational leadership. The log of HMS Lowestoft for 13 September 1759 reads: At 7.0 anchored in 9 fathoms low water [...] Landed all the troops on the north shore. At 10.0 our troops began a general action with the French [...] At 11.0 was brought on board the corpse of General Wolfe.\n\nLowestoft had anchored in the St Lawrence river, off Quebec, and recounts perhaps the most famous British action of the war: Wolfe’s\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 02_Seven_Years_War_Intro.3d Page 4 of 10\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nFig. I.2. The death of General Wolfe\n\naudacious storming of the Plains of Abraham, the resultant battle and his death.5 The fact that Wolfe, perhaps the most famous British army officer of the war, was fighting and eventually dying in North America is not just evidence of the truly global nature of the Anglo-French conflict, but points to something more. Wolfe’s army was able to capture Quebec due to the wider strategic situation shaped by British diplomacy and the Royal Navy, the operational effectiveness of Royal Navy fleets in securing and exploiting control of the sea, and the tactical skill and expertise of Royal Navy officers and sailors. The fates of Admiral Byng – executed by firing squad on his own quarterdeck – and General Wolfe stand in stark contrast to what many will think of the Seven Years War when set against what the great maritime historian and theorist Julian Corbett called ‘the subordinate campaigns of Frederick the Great’.6 At sea there were relatively few ‘classic’ naval actions, the most famous being Quiberon Bay off the coast of France. Yet that does not mean that the Royal Navy did not contribute much towards eventual British success in the wars. It did, and in many ways that are less obvious than fleet battles and amphibious operations: protecting trade while attacking that\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 02_Seven_Years_War_Intro.3d Page 5 of 10\n\n6\n\nThe Seven Years War\n\nof the enemy, providing defence against invasion, blockading enemy warships and merchantmen. Moreover, the direct, operational and tactical integration of army and navy displayed at Quebec is far more typical of British operations during the war than the battles of Minden and Plassey. For the Seven Years War can be seen as a crucial step in the development of a distinctly British approach to conducting conflict, a ‘British way in warfare’ perhaps, of which the key element was the integration of army and navy in amphibious power projection. Here, both army and navy learned from failures by implementing a truly joint approach to operations, and which contrasts with the lack of coordination so evident in French operations. British strategy in the Seven Years War was inherently maritime based upon the Royal Navy. In fact, assessing the Royal Navy’s contribution to British success is an incredibly valuable and important exercise as it goes beyond pure naval battles to provide a more nuanced understanding of the importance of maritime power to the British state. British war aims Tactics, operations and military strategies are just the ways employed to achieve political ends, so any talk of success in war must involve a method to judge that success. The issue here was that British war aims developed according to the context. Perhaps the most obvious example of this is that while an Anglo-French conflict had actually begun in the Ohio Valley, North America, in 1754–5, statesmen on both sides of the Channel were very keen to prevent it escalating to Europe. So the initial aim of both France and Britain was to determine, in their respective favour, territorial, trading and access rights (the last of these being particularly important with regard to the Newfoundland fisheries) in North America. For Britain that was a defined and limited war aim, defensive in appearance, based around a concept of ‘security’ but manifested in an aggressive manner, for British North America could never be safe with the French in possession of Canada. However, the policies and strategies employed to achieve this end contributed to the conflict spreading to a European tinderbox ready to be set alight. Moreover, British war aims in North America escalated into the larger\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 02_Seven_Years_War_Intro.3d Page 6 of 10\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nobject of the conquest of Canada due to the wider context of the war and a degree of opportunism. In Europe, for commercial and strategic reasons – particularly the danger of an invasion launched from the sheltered waters of the Scheldt estuary – British policy tended to concentrate on the security of the Low Countries (the Austrian Netherlands), but that region was consciously excluded from the conflict (a major strategic mistake by French policy makers). Instead, British concerns focused on King George II’s electorate of Hanover. Hanover was important for domestic policy reasons, as British statesmen would have to ensure its protection for their sovereign, but also because its capture by the French would entail swapping some overseas colonial gain for its freedom during eventual peace talks. British strategy in Europe was, therefore, essentially defensive, defeating, or keeping bottled up in port, the French navy. Further overseas, in the West Indies, India and Africa, British policy was based around trade and access, but that often involved aggressive operations to take enemy territory and positions. This not only denied France overseas revenue and added that revenue to British coffers, but also provided useful bargaining counters which could be traded for the freedom of Hanover, if it came to that. So for Britain at least the Seven Years War was fought on a global scale, and that inherently involved the ability to control and exploit sea access. While the sea can be a barrier it is also a highway, connecting different parts of the globe together into a maritime whole. That is how William Pitt viewed the war – as an exercise in global grand strategy. For Britain there were inherent linkages between all the theatres of operations, but despite that, British ministers did try to keep any conflict in North America separate from Europe. The problem was that their actions made the spread of conflict to Europe almost inevitable: it was impossible for them to separate the two even though their initial aims were to do exactly that. Given British global and European interests it is, therefore, impossible for the historian to separate the ‘continental’ from the wider Anglo-French imperial global conflict. Several British statesmen, and Pitt in particular, understood that fundamentally British war aims were very much maritime in their nature.7 So for Britain, the struggle was primarily with France (and then Spain from 1762), and was fought for colonial pre-eminence on a global scale.\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 02_Seven_Years_War_Intro.3d Page 7 of 10\n\n8\n\nThe Seven Years War\n\nFig. I.3. William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham (1708–78)\n\nThat required a careful balancing of grand strategy in order to achieve British aims in both Europe and overseas. It would be no use conquering North America to have to give it up to free Hanover. Realising that aggressively separating France from North America would ruin French trade, in Pitt’s view British seapower and the Royal Navy were central to his strategic vision. He was not the only one. Just one year after the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle had brought the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–8) to a close, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Hardwicke, wrote to the Secretary of State, the Duke of Newcastle, noting that France had been keen for peace in 1748 to give sufficient opportunity for the French navy to recover. Hardwicke argued that no expense should be spared to increase the Royal Navy both in terms of ships and available seamen. This would act as a deterrent to possible French aggression in Europe, as France ‘knows that her trade and colonies must always be in the power of\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 02_Seven_Years_War_Intro.3d Page 8 of 10\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nFig. I.4. The Duke of Newcastle\n\nthe superior force at sea’.8 Newcastle pointed to the danger of a France freed from continental concerns, as in any future conflict with France the Royal Navy’s supremacy at sea, which would be the defining factor in British strategy, would be inherently linked to a continental dimension of the conflict to keep France from devoting all her energies to a maritime war. Navies, as Newcastle intimated, do not operate in a strategic bubble. They have a purpose and that purpose is defined by political objects. Maritime war was (and is) more than just the operations of naval forces. Maritime war is about maritime trade, finance, shipping and insurance, in fact the mobilisation of a maritime fiscal economy. It is about more than just projecting power at sea; it is about projecting power from the sea. That is more than just amphibious operations; it is about influencing the course of conflict on land in the widest sense. Only with this wider strategic\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 02_Seven_Years_War_Intro.3d Page 9 of 10\n\n10\n\nThe Seven Years War\n\nvision can the role of the Royal Navy in British success in the Seven Years War be fully understood. But it is also necessary to identify British strategic priorities, and how they developed according to the wider context, and then how policy makers battled with often competing objects and ultimately assigned resources. In a maritime imperial context, the two main protagonists, Britain and France, were essentially competing for formal empire (the control of imperial possessions) and informal empire (control of markets and entrepôts). So, despite the conflict between Prussia on one side and Austria and Russia on the other, for Britain the Seven Years War was really about whether Britain or France (and from 1762 Spain) would be the pre-eminent global empire.9 It did not, however, start that way. In fact the first global war started with British attempts to ensure disagreements with France about territorial rights in the Ohio Valley did not escalate into a wider conflict. While this political and strategic aim was certainly noble, the problem was with the ways and means to achieve it.\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 02_Seven_Years_War_Intro.3d Page 10 of 10\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\n‘Voilà, the war begun’ The Countdown to War, 1754–6\n\nThe year 1756 is a very ‘European’ date for the start of the Seven Years War, for it ignores an ongoing situation between France and Britain in North America where blood had already been spilt. The continued problems in North America between Britain and France had their roots in the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle which had, supposedly, ended the War of the Austrian Succession in 1748. The treaty had settled nothing, and imperial competition and eventual conflict in North America was the result. French possessions in North America were concentrated in the south around New Orleans, and the north-east around Montreal and Quebec. With British possessions along and inland from the Eastern Seaboard the potential for Anglo-French disputes to turn into conflict were therefore concentrated into three distinct areas around Nova Scotia, New York and the Ohio Valley, though it must be pointed out that the proximity of New Orleans to the British West Indies islands was also seen as a cause for concern. With the Royal Navy’s presence at sea, the only way for France to link up her disparate possessions was via the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, then via Lakes Erie and Ontario. The journey between the Ohio and Lake Erie was overland and this area of territory, home to the Iroquois Confederation of Native Americans, was the direct cause of conflict erupting in North America between Britain and France. In Versailles, 11\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 03_Seven_Years_War_Chapter_1.3d Page 11 of 26\n\n12\n\nThe Seven Years War\n\nFrench intentions were not necessarily to block westward expansion of the British colonies, but that is what was happening on the ground. It was certainly perceived that way in London. Initial skirmishes between the French and British colonial forces had seen the British rebuffed, and in 1754 the French completed Fort Duquesne where the Ohio forks into the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers (the former heading north towards Lake Erie). The events of 1754 show that conflict could be a reality outside of formal declared war between European states. Eighteenth-century statesmen recognised the concept of ‘reprisal’ in the colonial sphere, tit-for-tat small wars fought by colonial forces over disputed territory. It did not always involve a state of war between European powers. The problem would arise when formal regular troops, either from colonial possessions or sent from Europe, tipped the balance one way or the other, usually leading to the other side sending out regular reinforcements, thereby creating a cycle of escalation. The other manner in which escalation could occur would be if recognised territorial possessions were attacked. It is, therefore, important to point out that France and Britain were both transatlantic powers (albeit of different scale and importance) with interests in North America and Europe (and beyond for that matter). Three Navigation Acts in the 1650s and 1660s created a transatlantic ‘maritime imperial system’ for Britain based upon trade and shipping, and this generated wealth that allowed for the more effective management of public finance than her continental neighbours. By 1755 nearly half of all shipping sailing from English ports was long-distance oceanic, and this provided a pool of skilled seamen to man merchantmen in time of peace and warships in time of conflict. While Britain did have interests in Europe, separated from Continental Europe by the Channel and the Royal Navy, the foundation of her power was a clear head start in the transatlantic economy. On the other hand, while possessing North American colonies and a growing merchant marine, in 1754 France most certainly was still more a Continental European power. For Britain, any power fighting France in Europe would also distract French resources away from a maritime colonial conflict. So while it might be a neat historical division to treat the war for empire and the power struggle in\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 03_Seven_Years_War_Chapter_1.3d Page 12 of 26\n\nThe Countdown to War, 1754–6\n\n13\n\ncentral Europe as separate entities, the reality was much more complex and challenging.1 The British government was keen to respond to the setbacks of 1754, but without provoking escalation into a wider European war. The British domestic political scene was, however, entering a period of uncertainty which influenced policy and strategy. When Prime Minister Henry Pelham died on 6 March 1754 he was succeeded by his brother the Duke of Newcastle. The Newcastle administration would receive much criticism for its policies until replaced by the Pitt–Devonshire ministry on 16 November 1756. This arrangement lasted until May, when it in turn fell from office after the loss of Minorca and the execution of Admiral Byng. There followed a period where there was no effective government until the formation of the Pitt–Newcastle ministry of 25 June 1757. That lasted until the death of George II and the accession of his grandson, George III, which saw another change in the political make up with the rise of his favourite, the Earl of Bute.2 Upon coming to power in 1754 Newcastle’s main foreign policy focus was North America and how to prevent conflict spreading to Europe. The recent past showed how difficult that might be. The War of the Austrian Succession, begun as a colonial conflict between Britain and Spain in 1739, served as a recent example of the near impossibility of preventing colonial conflict spreading to Europe. Moreover, the situation in Europe in 1754 was distinctly unfavourable for British interests. Although the Bourbon family compact, which tied together France and Spain, was waning a little due to the precarious state of Spanish finances, British aggression might lead to the implementation of a Franco-Spanish alliance. This would add Spanish colonial resources and, importantly, Spanish warships to the forces that France could assemble to take the war to Britain. It was important, therefore, for Britain not to be seen as an aggressor.3 Another issue was the relationship between Prussia and France. This was based around a military agreement of 1741 whereby France paid for 20,000 German troops to be at the disposal of Frederick of Prussia. In 1754 London did not know what Prussian intentions were, while talk of Germany raised the question of King George II’s electorate of Hanover – a vexing security complication. Newcastle argued for the exertion of British influence through alliances to deter aggression and to preserve the peace;\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 03_Seven_Years_War_Chapter_1.3d Page 13 of 26\n\n14\n\nThe Seven Years War\n\nthe main object of Newcastle’s ‘system’ was to prevent the invasion of Hanover, not by France but by the apparently aggressive and ambitious Frederick of Prussia. If Hanover fell into enemy hands, then its freedom would have to be secured by giving up colonial conquests or possessions, an option that might work with regards to France but not with Prussia. The danger posed by France or a French ally to Hanover was a contributory factor to the British wartime policy of seizing French overseas territory in case a territorial exchange was needed. So, as much as British politicians would like to limit war to North America in order to limit the threat to Hanover, if war with France did spread to Europe it would likely involve colonial and European operations.4 In that regard the prospects for keeping France occupied in Europe to give Britain a free hand overseas as exalted by Newcastle were not that good. Moreover, Hanover in the hands of the French had the potential to give the French navy access to the North Sea. This was important for the final area of concern to Newcastle: the Austrian-controlled Netherlands. The security of British colonies ‘depended on the integrity of the Mother Country’s naval position in the Narrow Seas’; French access to the North Sea, especially from both Antwerp and the Texel, would fundamentally undermine the cornerstone of British naval policy: stationing the Royal Navy’s Western Squadron in the western approaches to the English Channel. For Britain, any price was worth paying to prevent Continental Europe’s most powerful military power possessing deep water, accessible ports on the North Sea, as this threatened invasion. Preventing the French from obtaining access to the Low Countries, and the Scheldt estuary in particular, was the main British security concern in Europe. Versailles could assemble an army of over 300,000 men for military operations, way beyond the British ability to muster a mere 80,000 men. France also possessed the world’s second largest navy and a growing economy.5 Set against such an unfavourable European situation, British diplomacy initially seemed successful. Discussions with smaller German states led to the hiring of mercenaries to provide an army to defend Hanover. Talks with Russia, where the Tsaritsa displayed a pathological hatred of Frederick, were designed to deter Prussia from attacking Hanover by prompting a Russian army to invade Prussia from the east. With somewhat cordial relations between London and Madrid, Spain seemed\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 03_Seven_Years_War_Chapter_1.3d Page 14 of 26\n\nThe Countdown to War, 1754–6\n\n15\n\ndetermined on neutrality, which was good news for British ministers as Spanish belligerence would immediately alter the balance of naval forces. In June 1756 the French could muster 62 ships of the line and 38 frigates, compared to the Royal Navy’s 89 ships of the line. The Spanish navy possessed 39 ships of the line, which could tip the balance of naval power. War with Spain would raise issues of Mediterranean security, in particular the safety of Gibraltar, as well as the security of Portugal and its excellent harbour at Lisbon; it would also raise the spectre of a joint invasion attempt of the British Isles. Overseas, a Franco-Spanish alliance might see the Royal Navy unable to guarantee the protection of West Indian islands and trade.6 That left Austria, which might yet be persuaded to stay out of an Anglo-French conflict. But Vienna was still seething at Frederick’s seizure of Silesia in 1740, adding further potential for a European conflagration of exactly the type the Newcastle ministry desperately wished to avoid. Talks between London and Versailles to avoid conflict stalled; the latter wanted an armistice, the former a definite treaty on North American territory. The Newcastle ministry, faced with the need to keep conflict in North America from spreading to Europe, were desperate to avoid the appearance of British aggression. But, while acting on the strategic defensive, in order to achieve the aim in North America some kind of operational and tactical offensive had to be implemented. In response to the setbacks in the Ohio Valley in September 1754, the Newcastle government decided to secretly reinforce North American garrisons. As Newcastle himself noted, if the French were not brought into line ‘All North America will be lost’. With this decision ‘1754 must be considered the year in which the global Seven Years War between Britain and France began’.7 The reinforcement would consist of two British regular infantry regiments, the 44th and 48th Foot, under Major General Edward Braddock; this would show Versailles how serious the British were taking the French incursion. If the French backed down, all well and good, if not then there was nothing left but to forcibly remove the French from Fort Duquesne. In that case, wrote Newcastle, ‘We then begin the war’. What was needed was a quick British victory to nip French ambitions in the bud and deter Versailles from further escalation.8\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 03_Seven_Years_War_Chapter_1.3d Page 15 of 26\n\n16\n\nThe Seven Years War\n\nThe initial object of the Braddock expedition was limited to the removal of the French from forts in the disputed Ohio territory. It was not an attack on recognised sovereign territory. But in a case of ‘mission creep’ it was expanded to include attacks on other French positions on Lake Ontario and in Nova Scotia. This was far too much for Braddock’s force, so he was vested with the command of all British regular forces in North America. Wider aims gave greater prospect for escalation; even worse, secrecy was lost. The French knew something was afoot and would surely respond, creating an escalatory cycle of the kind the Braddock expedition was meant to forestall. Sailing from Cork on 16 January, still in time of peace, Braddock’s force was escorted by the 50gun ships Centurion, flying the flag of Commodore Augustus Keppel, and Norwich. Braddock arrived in Hampton Roads on 19 February 1755, with his troops following on 10 March.9 The problem with Newcastle’s strategy was that it ignored the very linchpin of any strategy to isolate North America, or anywhere else overseas: the Royal Navy’s Western Squadron. In time of peace, getting the Western Squadron to sea might deter Versailles. In war its task was not to blockade French ports in a strict sense, but rather to cruise off Ushant and keep a watch over the French Atlantic ports, in particular Brest. So placed, it would prevent any invasion attempt of the British Isles. It would also interdict French ships carrying reinforcements for North America, but that entailed intercepting them in European waters – precisely the kind of aggressive action that might add a European dimension to the conflict. The next-best option was to interdict French forces when they arrived in North American waters, as that would appear more akin to imperial defensive measures. The need to do this became more acute when the French, fully aware of Braddock’s reinforcements, decided to up the game. By April 1755 they had collected 14 ships of the line containing around 3,000 troops at Brest. On 10 April 1755 the British Cabinet, prompted by the French stance in ongoing negotiations and the obvious naval preparations at Brest, rubber-stamped the decision to send a squadron of seven ships of the line to be stationed off Louisbourg. It was contrary to the principle of concentrating force in home waters to protect British interests overseas, but uppermost in the minds of British ministers was the desire to keep any\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 03_Seven_Years_War_Chapter_1.3d Page 16 of 26\n\nThe Countdown to War, 1754–6\n\n17\n\nFig. 1.1. Admiral Edward Boscawen\n\nconflict confined to North America. The Royal Navy officer tasked with the job was Admiral Edward Boscawen. His object was made patently clear: If you fall in with any French ships of war or other vessels having on board troops or other warlike stores you will do your best to take possession of them. In case resistance should be made, you will employ the means at your disposal to capture and destroy them.\n\nFollowing a further French claim to the entire extent of the disputed territory, the size of Boscawen’s squadron was increased to 11 ships of the line and he sailed on 27 April 1755. It had, however, proved difficult to procure seamen for the fleet and many of his ships were undermanned while many of those sailors he did have were already suffering from sickness.10 The French expedition, now numbering 19 ships of the line and six frigates, sailed on 3 May under Admiral Emmanuel-Auguste de la Motte.\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 03_Seven_Years_War_Chapter_1.3d Page 17 of 26\n\n18\n\nThe Seven Years War\n\nAlthough six of the French sail of the line were only to accompany the expedition 600 miles out into the Atlantic before turning back for Brest, the apparent scale of the French achievement prompted a swift response from Anson. On 11 May six sail of the line under Admiral Holburne were sent to reinforce Boscawen. This drew ships away from home waters at a time when Newcastle wanted the Western Squadron under Admiral Edward Hawke to cruise off Brest as a visible show of British naval strength. Preparing Hawke’s fleet for sea was delayed by the desire to get Boscawen and Holburne to sea first; once that was completed Hawke could start manning and victualling his ships. There was a dilemma, however, and it was best summed up by Newcastle. While tentative discussions to avoid conflict between London and Versailles dragged on, it would be very unseemly of Britain to act against the French fleet or French trade. It would seem duplicitous to all across Europe and might, Newcastle feared, bring Spain into any conflict in support of France. It mattered not if the war began in Europe or North America, but what was important was to prevent the French benefitting from any delay in hostilities. Instead, if Hawke’s Western Squadron was used aggressively as a deterrent: we should intercept all their trade, disable them, from being in a condition to make any considerable appearance at sea for some time, strike such a stroke at first upon their trade, that would make the whole Kingdom of France cry out against war, and by that means either prevent a war, or begin it with great advantage to ourselves.\n\nIf Hawke could get to sea he could start seizing French sailors, reducing the pool of experienced seamen available to the French navy. Newcastle got to the heart of the matter, for firm action would damage the French capacity to wage war and might even prevent it, but there was a risk that decisive action also might escalate the situation. Either way, delay would place France in a stronger position once her trade and sailors came in. Newcastle, Lord Chancellor Earl Hardwicke, Anson and other key figures met and discussed the matter. Opinion was split. Nevertheless, on 9 July the King assented to sending Hawke to sea with the Western Squadron.11\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 03_Seven_Years_War_Chapter_1.3d Page 18 of 26\n\nThe Countdown to War, 1754–6\n\n19\n\nBraddock and Boscawen After gathering his troops Braddock headed for Fort Duquesne in the disputed Ohio Valley. His column was within ten miles of the object on 9 July 1755 when it was ambushed by a Franco-Indian force. The resulting Battle of the Monongahela was a complete disaster. Braddock’s advance guard was driven back on to his main body. With unseen assailants peppering the British force with musket balls, targeting conspicuous officers in particular, the force inevitably lost cohesion. Braddock’s force resisted for around three hours until he was mortally wounded. Word spread and men began to run for it. Retreat turned to blind panic as the redcoats expected a massacre. The survivors took a total of seven days to make it back to their starting point at Fort Cumberland.12 The old saying goes that worse things happen at sea. By the time of Braddock’s defeat they already had. Boscawen arrived off Newfoundland on 3 June to find French ships already in the area. In foggy conditions off the Grand Banks on 10 June 1755, Captain Richard Howe in the 60-gun Dunkirk chased down and spoke to the captain of the French 64-gun Alcide who insisted that the two nations were still at peace. Hoisted on Boscawen’s flagship the Torbay was, however, the signal to engage as the French ship would not shorten sail. Around midday Howe engaged the Alcide, and with Boscawen bearing down in the Torbay the Frenchman struck after an action lasting ten minutes. It was short, but bloody; Dunkirk losing nine men killed and 29 wounded to the fully armed Alcide whose losses were considerably higher, 54 men killed and 50 wounded. Alcide had been accompanied by the 64-gun Lys, armed en ﬂûte (her heavier, lower deck guns had been left behind in Brest so she could accommodate troops). Lys ran for it but was captured after a two-hour chase by the Deﬁance and Fougueux. A third French ship, the fast-sailing Dauphin Royal escaped. The entire French fleet had, in fact, become scattered in the fog, which had probably saved them from a major action with Boscawen. By 13 June the remaining French ships carrying the reinforcements had made it to Louisbourg or had passed on to make passage for Quebec. Holburne arrived to join with Boscawen on 21 June.13 Boscawen’s action is a classic example of a tactical success that is not translated into the desired strategic and political outcomes. By engaging\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 03_Seven_Years_War_Chapter_1.3d Page 19 of 26\n\n20\n\nThe Seven Years War\n\nFig. 1.2. The capture of the Alcide and Lys, 8 June 1755\n\nthe French ships but not dealing their fleet a crushing blow, Boscawen had failed to pre-empt French ambitions. The loss of 3,000 regular infantry and their escorting warships would have been a crushing blow to Versailles. It could not have failed to highlight the virtual impossibility of waging war in North America for an inferior naval power. Instead, the actions of the ministry and Boscawen threatened the very escalation that British ministers so wished to avoid. He had commenced the war at sea but had not done enough to force France into making concessions. In fact, France had, despite the losses, achieved the strategic object making it less likely Versailles would back down. When news of Boscawen’s attack reached Versailles diplomatic relations were severed. Britain was clearly the aggressor; ‘Voilà, the war begun’ Lord Chancellor Earl Hardwicke wryly observed.14 The British attempt to ‘win’ the war in North America had utterly failed. Boscawen had simply not been given enough ships to either intercept de la Motte on the way out or to lock him up in North America. A critical lack of frigates made it hard to find the French fleet in an area renowned for poor visibility. Only once Holburne’s force arrived on 21 June did Boscawen have sufficient superiority to guarantee destroying the French, but by then it was too late. Boscawen had gone on to position\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 03_Seven_Years_War_Chapter_1.3d Page 20 of 26\n\nThe Countdown to War, 1754–6\n\n21\n\nhis fleet off the St Lawrence river, but his crews were sickly and he was barely able to maintain a blockade. Boscawen and Holburne would sail for England in October 1755 leaving a squadron to winter at Halifax under Commodore Richard Spry.15 French ire had been roused. With only 8,000 German mercenaries hired to defend Hanover, and France and Prussia in alliance, the European situation was unfavourable to say the least. It was perhaps with more than a little trepidation that British statesmen now viewed the impending conflict. Pitt was sounded out to join the ministry, making clear what he thought the object of the war should be: ‘the support of maritime and American war, in which we are going to be engaged, and the defence of the King’s German dominions.’ At the Admiralty Anson was expecting the French to launch a privateering campaign in the Channel and was desperate to get Hawke to sea.16 Stationing Boscawen in North America had been a somewhat necessary dispersal of Royal Navy force, but in trying to achieve a number of different objects the French had also dispersed their forces, with warships in North America and her Brest fleet split into three parts. While Boscawen had been busy in North American waters, in June Admiral Duguay had sailed from Brest with nine sail of the line to cover inbound French trade. Despite being ordered to limit his offensive activities he captured the 20-gun frigate HMS Blandford on 13 August. In London ministers knew the Brest fleet was out, apparently heading south, perhaps to Spain – heightening suspicions as to Spanish intentions. The question for ministers was, without formal war being declared, what to do next? Escalation Delays of a material nature, related to manning and victualling, and of a political nature, concerning a desire to avoid a confrontation with the French in home waters, had prevented Hawke from sailing. But with Duguay’s French fleet at sea something had to be done. Utilising Hawke’s fleet to shadow the Brest fleet was the obvious answer. Although Hawke’s first consideration was to protect British trade, ministers had learned from the Boscawen episode. Hawke was ordered not to engage single\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 03_Seven_Years_War_Chapter_1.3d Page 21 of 26\n\n22\n\nThe Seven Years War\n\nFig. 1.3. Lord Anson\n\nFrench ships, frigates or merchantmen. Instead his object was to intercept ‘the French squadron, or French men of war of the line of battle’. If an action occurred, this would guarantee that it would be a major naval battle with much prospect for defeating the French. If Hawke found the French committing any acts of hostility, Anson told him that ‘you are then to commit all acts of hostility against the French, and endeavour to seize and take by every means their ships and vessels’. Flying his flag in the 90-gun St George, Hawke’s Western Squadron sailed on 28 July with 16 ships of the line but only one frigate and a sloop. The lack of ‘eyes for his fleet’ would critically hamper his search for Duguay, as would the foul weather which delayed his arrival off Cape Finisterre until 23 August. He then retired to a point half way between there and Ushant.17 With events in North America and the taking of the Blandford further souring Anglo-French relations, on 23 August Hawke received orders to take any French warships, merchantmen and privateers he found. The order was widened on 27 August to include all Royal Navy commands; clearly Britain and France were now at war in all but name. This was a\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 03_Seven_Years_War_Chapter_1.3d Page 22 of 26\n\nThe Countdown to War, 1754–6\n\n23\n\ncrucial step in ministers’ minds, for the best chance the Royal Navy had to hoover up valuable French seamen was with the arrival in European waters of the incoming French trade from the West and East Indies. At sea, in the foul weather experienced during September, Duguay managed to avoid Hawke’s fleet and slipped back into Brest. Hawke, his ships battered and his crews sickly, gave up his station in September, heading to Spithead. De la Motte, evading Boscawen’s by now ineffective blockade of the St Lawrence, crossed the Atlantic and also made it into Brest shortly after Hawke had been forced off station. The French did hand back the Blandford in an attempt to calm matters down, but it was little more than a token gesture. During the course of the year the French had achieved tactical, operational and moral success, but they had not really changed the wider strategic picture – the French navy was still numerically inferior at sea.18 The Western Squadron was not ready to sail again until 14 October. With Hawke on a leave of absence, the Admiral in command during its second cruise of the year was John Byng. In awful weather and with crews becoming sickly and ships wearing out, Byng seized and detained over 300 French ships, including the 74-gun Espérance on 13 November, and captured 6,000 French seamen. Byng’s unglamorous but important cruise would have long-term repercussions for French naval power.19 While the Newcastle ministry already viewed war as inevitable, Versailles had spent late 1755 caught in a strategic impasse, missing a glorious opportunity for aggressive action against British interests at sea. In North America events had gone rather well for the French, with the loss of Braddock’s force and the resultant blow to British prestige among the Indian tribes. Their naval position in home waters had improved, with Duguay and de la Motte back in Brest. Not even the Royal Navy’s actions in the autumn of 1755 brought forward a French declaration of war, even if by the end of 1755 Versailles viewed war as inevitable. While war had not been formally declared, in North America and at sea war was a reality.20 British interests in Europe were looking increasingly exposed to French attack; lengthy talks with Austria and the Dutch yielded little progress with regard to the security of the Low Countries, and the safety of Hanover remained a problem. But, as at sea, no French attack came.\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 03_Seven_Years_War_Chapter_1.3d Page 23 of 26\n\n24\n\nThe Seven Years War\n\nOnce again, strategic paralysis struck Versailles at the very time the Low Countries were ripe for picking; they were probably more vulnerable in 1755 than at any other time between 1689 and 1815. While in financial terms the prospects of a successful war in 1755 were good, France was suffering from a combination of strategic pressures. Domestically the country was riven by internal problems between the church and its secular opponents, while Louis XV was very much under the influence of Madame de Pompadour. There was also a desire to get overseas trade in during the autumn to bolster the coffers. French diplomacy had failed to win over Spain; instead Madrid had been insulted by French machinations. Versailles was also caught in the very quandary facing British ministers, namely how to balance European and overseas interests. The question was how to use military might and a growing navy against British interests in North America and Hanover. French North American policy had been given added impetus by the Admiral the Comte de Galissonière, who had argued that unless France acted Britain would obtain a lead over her that would never be closed. British control of North America would ‘very certainly give them superiority in Europe’. France was allied with Prussia, though that agreement was scheduled to expire in May 1756. So while British ministers feared aggressive action might spark a European war, a French invasion of Hanover might also spark a wider European war, distracting Versailles from the ongoing hostilities with Britain. Finally, there were growing suspicions that Frederick might leave France in the lurch once he had achieved his objects in any conflict. To Frederick, France appeared a weak and indecisive ally. 21 Britain had promised Russia £100,000 per year to keep 55,000 Russian troops on Frederick’s eastern border. In time of war the terms would increase by a factor of five. That would, it was hoped, secure Hanover from the Prussian threat. The treaties were approved in December 1755. Frederick got wind of the discussions and, faced with the growing threat from Russia, with his only ally appearing spineless and less than friendly, acted with utter ruthlessness. He approached London for an alliance. Never mind offering not to attack Hanover, he offered to help defend it against aggression. At a stroke London’s main object in Europe could be safeguarded and the resulting Treaty of Westminster was signed on 16 January 1756. In assuring that both countries would assist one another\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 03_Seven_Years_War_Chapter_1.3d Page 24 of 26\n\nThe Countdown to War, 1754–6\n\n25\n\nto keep foreign forces off Hanoverian soil, it was a remarkable volte-face in Prussian and British policy.22 In January 1756 the French sent an ultimatum to London, which seemed to be backed up by another round of naval preparations at Brest, intelligence of which arrived in London. On 27 February 1756 Hawke was ordered to sea to convoy three East India ships to westward of Ushant before taking up station in the western approaches. By 19 April Hawke was 15 leagues off Ushant but he was back in port by May for a period of rest, leaving Boscawen in command of the Western Squadron. Hawke had, however, not arrived home empty handed, for he had fallen in with a French convoy and taken eight valuable West Indiamen as prizes.23 On 1 May 1756, in another remarkable diplomatic volte-face, France and Austria, perpetual enemies, signed a defensive alliance. On the surface the treaty seemed to provide France with a free hand to wage war against Britain without a continental entanglement. France would help Austria if she were attacked but Versailles, thinking war in Europe was unlikely, made a monumental strategic blunder promising not to invade the Low Countries. Moreover, Austria was not committed to helping France in her conflict with Britain, instead the focus for Vienna was clearly the danger posed by Frederick’s Prussia and Austria’s burning desire to recover Silesia.24 So conflict between Britain and France which had started in the Ohio Valley had indeed escalated and transferred to Europe. On 18 May Britain declared war on France. Versailles now looked to deal Britain a heavy blow to disrupt her grand strategy, procure a bargaining counter and maybe even force London to peace negotiations. On 8 June Hawke’s rest period ashore was interrupted by urgent orders to respond to a crisis in the Mediterranean and the controversial actions of Admiral John Byng.25\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 03_Seven_Years_War_Chapter_1.3d Page 25 of 26\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 03_Seven_Years_War_Chapter_1.3d Page 26 of 26\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\n‘What a scandal to the Navy’ The Mediterranean, 1756–8\n\nTo shock London into making an early peace, France had two options. The first was the perennial threat of invading the British Isles (including Ireland). The second was to take advantage of dispersed Royal Navy deployments, seize local command of the sea and use it to achieve a startling success. Both were dependent upon the French navy. After 1748 the French navy had embarked on a building programme, and by the end of 1755 possessed 57 ships of the line and 31 frigates, with a further seven sail of the line and six frigates to be launched in 1756. The majority were based in the Atlantic ports to maintain communications with North America and threaten an invasion of the British Isles. This effort had, however, exhausted domestic and imported naval supplies, and with the Royal Navy’s desire to stop French trade, building more or maintaining those ships it had built was unsustainable. As a result, the French tended to avoid battle to preserve their fleet ‘in being’, and the French navy was a factor in the war until 1759. Madrid had also been making good the losses of the 1739–48 war, launching 38 new ships of the line by 1756. With her colonial resources and bases Spain posed more of a threat in the Caribbean than France. By 1755 in tonnage terms the Bourbon powers of France (162,000 tons) and Spain (113,000) had achieved parity with the Royal Navy (277,000).1 The fundamental problem for the French remained finding sufficient experienced sailors to man their ships. The loss of 6,000 experienced seamen in 1755 before war had been officially declared delayed the mobilisation of French naval power; only 28 sail of the line were ready for 27\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 04_Seven_Years_War_Chapter_2.3d Page 27 of 44\n\n28\n\nThe Seven Years War\n\nsea by 1 June 1756. Further losses in 1756 and 1757 would see the French lose between 10,000 and 12,000 men from a pool of around 60,000: France did not have the sailors for a long maritime war. Unable to mount a sustained challenge to the Royal Navy, many French seamen decided to join privateers, again reducing the available manpower pool for the navy.2 The Mediterranean, 1756–8 Nevertheless, between 1756 and 1758 the French put their navy to good use. Faced with obvious French naval preparations in early 1756, the question facing ministers in London was what were the French up to? In December 1755 Anson had thought French preparations at Toulon would be directed against the British Isles. Further weight was given to this in early 1756 when Newcastle received intelligence that preparations were taking place for an invasion, but the French were assembling naval forces in Toulon which raised a number of potential targets from the West Indies to the British Isles to the Mediterranean. Desperate to avoid a continental conflagration but unable to challenge British seapower, France used her navy not to fight the Royal Navy but to achieve specific mission-oriented objects. In January 1756 two squadrons went to the West Indies to escort the valuable trade back to France, and one of these succeeded in taking the 64-gun HMS Warwick. In early April another squadron sailed, carrying troops to help bolster Canadian defences. Sending squadrons across the Atlantic was a risky but necessary part of French plans for a defensive war.3 With France also moving troops towards the Atlantic ports, such naval activity heightened British uncertainty. One thing that was obvious was the French naval preparations in Toulon. By 4 April nearly 15,000 French troops under the Duc de Richelieu were ready to embark upon 173 transports escorted by 12 ships of the line. With their sailing delayed by a storm, on 17 April the French expedition dropped anchor off the Mediterranean island of Minorca (taken by Britain from Spain in 1708). Four days later the French troops were ashore.4 With the danger of a French invasion of the British Isles and a focus on the conflict in North America, British Ministers had been caught flatfooted by the speed and purpose of the French expedition. Anson had decided\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 04_Seven_Years_War_Chapter_2.3d Page 28 of 44\n\nThe Mediterranean, 1756–8\n\n29\n\nthat the Western Squadron took priority over any reinforcements to the Mediterranean, where Commodore George Edgcumbe’s squadron was still at peacetime levels, consisting of the 58-gun Princess Louisa and the 50gun ships Deptford and Portland plus four frigates: the 20-gun Phoenix, Experiment and Dolphin and the 14-gun Fortune. His three ships of the line were stationed at Minorca when the French expedition arrived and they wisely fled to Gibraltar to raise the alarm.5 Minorca was important for the Royal Navy to project power into the Mediterranean. Its particular value was the close proximity of the excellent harbour at Port Mahon to the French fleet base at Toulon, some 180 miles to the north. Along with Gibraltar, Minorca provided a frontline of defence against any French moves to use their Toulon fleet to leave the Mediterranean and either sail for North America or the Caribbean, or to head into the Channel. Minorca did, however, require a permanent garrison and secure maritime communications for it imported much of its food. Alongside its strategic value to Britain, if the French captured Minorca it could be used to offset British colonial success in future peace talks. Finally, coming on the back of events in North America, the loss of Minorca would have serious domestic repercussions for the Newcastle administration. Minorca must be saved. The key position in the defence of Minorca was St Philip’s Castle; sited high on rocky ground, it commanded Port Mahon and the anchorage. The island’s garrison was understrength, mustering 2,860 men, and suffered from a lack of senior officers. Four regimental colonels, the commandant of the Port Mahon fortress, the general in charge and even the governor were all on leave in England and would have to sail with a relief force. Command of the defenders lay with the formidable 84-year-old Major General William Blakeney. Despite all this, taking St Philip by regular siege methods would be tricky and lengthy, many in the French expedition predicted failure. Having escorted the expedition to Minorca, Admiral Galissonière’s role was now to save his ships by heading back to Toulon if the Royal Navy appeared in strength. That became a reality on 18 May when 13 ships appeared on the horizon.6 In February the British had received intelligence reports that the French preparations at Toulon might be directed against Minorca, and this was corroborated in early March as reports reached London from Madrid. It\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 04_Seven_Years_War_Chapter_2.3d Page 29 of 44\n\n30\n\nThe Seven Years War\n\nwas believed France would take the island and offer it to Spain in order to draw that country into the war against Britain. With Minorca threatened, swift and decisive action was needed to drive off the French fleet, isolate the French army on Minorca and bolster the British garrison. The Admiralty had concluded as early as 9 March that ‘as strong a squadron as can be spared from hence should be got ready to send into the Mediterranean’. Anson allocated ten ships of the line to be commanded by Admiral John Byng to be made ready to sail to Minorca. Although Byng was delayed by attempting to find sufficient sailors to man his ships, by the time he sailed from Portsmouth on 6 April his fleet was sufficiently manned. After battling contrary winds, Byng arrived off Gibraltar on 2 May.7 Initially Byng was outnumbered by the French, for he would be taking his ten sail of the line into action with 12 enemy fully equipped with their heavier guns. When intelligence arrived stating the French force was larger than originally thought, Anson did not send additional ships to Byng. Moreover, the possibility that the Western Squadron, now under Boscawen, could reinforce Byng was not considered by Anson. Instructed by the government to reinforce Byng, Anson dispatched four ships from Portsmouth, delaying their arrival in theatre. Uppermost in the mind of Anson was the need to keep the Western Squadron strong, even if that strategy compromised other interests. While Anson was probably right in naval and strategic terms, what was at stake was the loss of Minorca – and in the climate of 1756 that was more of a political problem than a strategic one. Yet this does ignore one further factor, for at Gibraltar Byng found Edgcumbe’s force, minus a frigate, which he took under his command. This gave him 13 ships of the line and four frigates to take on 12 French ships of the line and four frigates. Moreover, while many of his ships were certainly not brand new, neither were they old and worn out. Simply put, the resources assigned to Byng by Anson, who had many other strategic concerns to balance, were enough to secure the object to which he had been assigned.8 One cannot help but feel that Byng thought he was being sent on a fool’s errand. His orders made no mention of bringing the enemy fleet to decisive action: ‘If you find any attack made upon that island [Minorca] by the French, you are to use all possible means in your power for its relief.’ If they were not there he was to blockade Toulon, but his overriding\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 04_Seven_Years_War_Chapter_2.3d Page 30 of 44\n\nThe Mediterranean, 1756–8\n\n31\n\nFig. 2.1. Admiral Byng\n\nobject was to safeguard Minorca and Gibraltar ‘from any hostile attempt’. This might seem a set of confused orders, but in an age of slow communications it was normal for the Admiralty to provide broad guidance to officers sailing overseas. Micro-management from London was impossible. So while Byng’s object was clear – to prevent the French taking Minorca – the ways and means for achieving this were not made clear. He seems to have prepared himself for a simple task of landing reinforcements before cruising off Toulon. Aware that the French had indeed landed, he would have to fight an aggressive naval battle. Despite his success in taking French ships in 1755, Byng was an unimaginative officer who needed specific instructions to stir him into aggressive action. Anson and the Admiralty did not provide this. Nevertheless, in the hands of an aggressive and capable officer, the force sent should have been enough to frustrate French plans.9 Byng’s pessimism and unwillingness to take the initiative became increasingly evident when he arrived at Gibraltar and failed to implement orders to take with him 700 men drawn from the garrison. Instead, the\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 04_Seven_Years_War_Chapter_2.3d Page 31 of 44\n\n32\n\nThe Seven Years War\n\nviews of Lieutenant General Fowke, who argued that St Philip’s was doomed, seemed to reinforce Byng’s own belief that Minorca was all but lost and that Gibraltar might be next. This defeatist tone infused his correspondence with the Admiralty. Byng’s dispatch of 4 May explaining his conduct at Gibraltar led George II to declare ‘This man will not fight’. The fate of Minorca now lay in the hands of Byng.10 Battle of Minorca, 20 May 1756 Nearing Minorca on 19 May, Byng sent a frigate ahead of his main fleet to converse with the garrison but it was driven off by the French. Both sides prepared for action but the wind was very light. Next morning, as the fog lifted around 09:00, Byng found himself 12 miles off the French fleet to the south-east. Forming a line of battle, Byng’s fleet was divided into two divisions: seven ships in the van under his personal control and six ships in the rear under Admiral Temple-West, giving his fleet 13 ships of the line. Galissonière’s 12 ships were organised into three divisions, with the commander in the centre. The two fleets closed with each other, both desperate to obtain the weather gauge until at around 12:30 the wind direction changed, throwing the French into some confusion and giving Byng his chance. He failed to take advantage and the fleets continued to close at an acute angle. Byng’s intent was not to bear down on the French fleet and subject his ships to raking fire until the two fleets were very close. His original plan had designated the rearmost ship of his line, Deﬁance, to lead the attack, but there were clearly problems with communication. Byng’s flagship, the 90-gun Ramillies, made frantic signals but the Deﬁance failed to respond to his orders. The attack was turning into a shambles and Byng’s fleeting opportunity was passing. At around 14:30 he finally took the initiative, ordering Temple-West’s division, now in the van, ‘to engage to bring on the action, and to empower those ships to fire respectively as they got within proper distance’.11 Temple-West’s division immediately bore down on their respective enemies and a close range gunnery duel commenced. Temple-West’s 68gun Buckingham drove her opponent off within half an hour, and within another hour the French van had been driven to leeward. Byng’s division\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 04_Seven_Years_War_Chapter_2.3d Page 32 of 44\n\nFig. 2.2.

About 14:30 and the van of the British fleet has failed to close with the French\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 04_Seven_Years_War_Chapter_2.3d Page 33 of 44\n\n34\n\nThe Seven Years War\n\nwas, however, lagging behind, sticking to his original plan. His ability to exert command and control over the battle was hampered by his distance from the action, around two miles. As he finally started to close his division nearly ran foul of the much-damaged Intrepid from Temple-West’s division. This further slowed Byng’s advance and although Ramillies, the most powerful ship present, opened fire at around 15:00 she did not come within effective range for a further two hours. As a consequence not only had Byng failed to bring his division into action to support Temple-West, he had also wasted his best resource. Even worse, a dangerous gap had opened up between the two British divisions.12 Galissonière had the intellect to act upon such a glorious opportunity and a coherent body of ships under his direct command with which to take advantage of poor British fleet management. Galissonière signalled his centre and rear to cut the British line and fall on the unengaged side of Temple-West’s division, thereby defeating the British van in detail. The plan was noble and bold, but the timing was off for the opportunity had in fact already passed. Byng managed to finally shake out his division and intercept Galissonière, who wore off to leeward. It was about 17:30 and the action petered out. Byng later stated that, given the damage to his ships, he felt it unwise to renew the action; he felt his priority was to maintain his fleet in being rather than to make further efforts to destroy the French. He was convinced there was ‘no further possibility of bringing the enemy to action again, as they declined it, without I had a sufficient force and superiority to enable me to make the general signal to chase’.13 So far there had been nothing too much out of the ordinary for a fleet battle in the age of sail. Command and control problems were everpresent, the wind and weather liable to change and plans thrown into confusion by unexpected events – they had all contributed to what was a tactically indecisive action. Losses in the British fleet were 43 killed and 168 wounded; the French had lost 38 killed and 175 wounded. Some indication of the nature of the fighting can be gleaned from the fact that the majority of the British casualties were in the van – the last five ships of Byng’s fleet, including his powerful Ramillies, suffered no casualties at all.14 It was the decision making that followed which turned the battle of Minorca into a British disaster. For the next four days, while Byng’s fleet\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 04_Seven_Years_War_Chapter_2.3d Page 34 of 44\n\nFig. 2.4.

The fleets have separated and Byng starts his controversial decision making process\n\nmade running repairs, there was no contact between his fleet and the garrison. On 24 May Byng called a council of war. The questions were heavily loaded by Byng’s pessimism, and the council resolved on a course of action the Admiral was already convinced of: to retreat to Gibraltar to continue repairs and thereby preserve the fleet. It was a shockingly inept decision. All Byng had to do was maintain his fleet in theatre, thereby posing a constant danger not just to Galissonière but also to his communications with Richelieu’s army ashore until reinforcements arrived. That would tip the balance decisively in Byng’s favour and allow him to destroy or at least drive off Galissonière’s fleet. Instead Byng considered Minorca as lost. Byng’s fleet arrived at Gibraltar on 19 June where he found four ships of the line and a further 50-gun ship needed to deal with Galissonière. After taking on water Byng lingered, seemingly unwilling to take further offensive action.15 On 3 July Hawke arrived. His orders were a model of clarity. First, he was to replace Byng and take all the ships under his command. Second, Hawke was to inquire into the conduct of the captains that had served under Byng and if he found any who had not ‘acted with due spirit and\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 04_Seven_Years_War_Chapter_2.3d Page 36 of 44\n\nThe Mediterranean, 1756–8\n\n37\n\nvigour’ he was to send them home. The next part of his orders was dependent upon the situation in Minorca. If St Philip still held out, he was to waste no time in sailing for the island and do whatever was needed to secure its relief. If St Philip had fallen, Hawke was to ‘endeavour by all means to destroy the French fleet in the Mediterranean’. In the meantime he was to use cruisers to isolate the French garrison on the island and generally ‘to employ the utmost vigilance and vigour to annoy and distress the enemy everywhere within the extent of your command and by every method and means in your power’. The orders were unequivocal; the Admiralty would not countenance a repeat of Byng’s timidity in the face of the enemy. Hawke sailed for Minorca, and on 15 July fell in with a number of French transports carrying the Minorca garrison to Gibraltar – clearly the island had fallen. Hawke arrived off the island on 20 July but Galissonière had already fled for Toulon.16 On Minorca the defenders of St Philip, under the tenacious Blakeney, had continued to hold out despite being abandoned by Byng. Many in Richelieu’s force became ever more despondent, and fire from the besieging forces could only be maintained when a supply of shot and powder arrived on 22 June. If Byng had maintained his fleet in theatre this shipment, along with others, could have been intercepted, forcing the French to abandon the siege. Thinking that the Royal Navy would inevitably return and cut his communications with the fleet, Richelieu resolved to bring matters to a head and storm the fortress on 27 June. Despite making some inroads, the attack was a failure and Richelieu, desperate to take St Philip, offered extremely generous terms. In the face of French attacks, lacking officers to lead the men and seemingly abandoned to their fate by the Royal Navy, Blakeney accepted. On 28 June Minorca surrendered.17 With Spain determined to remain neutral, despite the French offer of Minorca, the loss of the island was not a major strategic blow for the British war effort. Anson’s concentration on the Western Squadron was therefore, in naval and strategic terms, the correct decision. The British war effort could cope with the loss of Minorca, but a French invasion attempt of the British Isles or moves to reinforce the key theatre of North America were a different matter. The problem for Anson’s thinking was that military action does not operate in a vacuum: it is there\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 04_Seven_Years_War_Chapter_2.3d Page 37 of 44\n\n38\n\nThe Seven Years War\n\nto serve policy, and policy is made by politicians. Here the loss of Minorca had major repercussions, not just for Byng but for the British government. Byng was placed under arrest shortly after he arrived at Portsmouth on 26 July, in part to protect him from the anger of the general public who blamed him and the administration for the loss of Minorca. The administration was more than happy for Byng to be blamed. His dispatch, dated 25 May 1756, was published in the London Gazette in a heavily edited form and gave the impression that Byng had run away from the French. The process dragged on until a court martial could be convened on 28 December 1756. It lasted for four weeks. Acquitted of personal cowardice, Byng was found guilty of not supporting his ships already engaged, which contravened the 12th Article of War and carried the death penalty. The court asked for leniency but the Admiralty refused and the death sentence was passed.18 The Admiralty sent notice of the sentence to the King, who was advised it was not illegal. With Byng also a Member of Parliament the furore was inherently political in nature. Parliament was against the penalty but the House of Lords rejected a bill that would have allowed the members of the court martial to speak openly about their findings. In a growing political storm, on 14 March 1757 Byng was executed. He was not greatly mourned; indecisive and pessimistic, his tactical and operational culpability was writ large as was his failure to grasp the strategic outcome of his inability to deal with Galissonière. When news had arrived in England in 1756, the Whig politician and pamphleteer, the Earl of Bath fumed ‘all the world is calling our admirals rascals and cowards’. Admiral Boscawen summed it all up: ‘What a scandal to the Navy that there should be premeditated cowards that have been so long bred to arms. I should think for the future that no man should command that had not given proof of his courage.’19 Byng’s conduct made him an easy scapegoat, but his fears over the condition of his ships and the problems in manning them must be seen in a wider context as they were part of a chronic problem facing the Royal Navy in 1756. On paper, in January 1756 the Royal Navy had 168 ships in commission. But due to new ships needing crews and ships requiring repairs, refits or cleaning, of the 71 ships in home ports, the\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 04_Seven_Years_War_Chapter_2.3d Page 38 of 44\n\nThe Mediterranean, 1756–8\n\n39\n\nAdmiralty estimated that only 13 could be made ready for active service. In all the navy was 13,641 men short of the number it needed. At Portsmouth not only was Byng 899 men short of his requirements, of those already on the books 740 men were not present. In addition, hampering the manning of his ships was Anson’s focus on home defence rather than overseas service, and his ordering Byng to ready four ships of the line and a couple of frigates for the Channel before manning his ships to sail to Minorca. Byng did bring his ships up to complement by the time he sailed from England, but he would later state they were the worst manned in the Royal Navy, and this was crucial in his reasoning not to re-engage the French at Minorca. His complaint was about the quality, or lack of it, of the seamen, rather than the numbers.20 In the political arena, the fallout from the loss of Minorca was the catalyst for the demise of the Newcastle ministry, with Newcastle, Anson and Hardwicke all resigning. The resulting political inertia inhibited the British war effort until Newcastle and Pitt returned to office in June 1757 with a ministry that would shape British grand strategy.\n\nFig. 2.7.

The French had preserved their Toulon fleet and might use it elsewhere to good effect, but instead they demobilised and for the rest of 1756 and 1757 it remained in port. The Royal Navy, operating out of Gibraltar, could keep a careful watch over the entrance and exit of the Mediterranean. It might seem, therefore, that the Mediterranean was a relatively peaceful theatre. This is not the case, for there was an ongoing small war – a war of commerce protection and commerce raiding. With the French unwilling to come out of Toulon to engage his fleet, Hawke resolved to free the St George, a British privateer that had been detained in Leghorn. Hawke detached the 60-gun Jersey and 50-gun Iris to escort British merchant ships out of the port. Captain William Burnaby of the Jersey informed the port authorities that he was authorised to use force to ward off any attempt to prevent the merchant ships and the St George sailing; all were successfully escorted out. Less successful was an attempt by Hawke to free a British merchantman, captured by a French privateer and now held at Algeciras under protection from Spanish batteries. The Spanish, supposedly neutral, rejected a call to force the privateer and her prize out of the port. When British boats attempted to retrieve the merchant ship the combined fire of the privateer and the Spaniards inflicted 150 casualties on the attacking force, but the ship was retaken. In August Hawke had detached the Iris to cruise off Benidorm. She came across a ship flying English colours and, suspicious, fired upon her. At this point French colours were hoisted and she struck and was briefly taken. Hawke, keen not to push things too far with Madrid, ordered the ship to be left ‘to avoid giving offence to the Spanish court’.21 In April 1757, while awaiting the return of his new sloop the Fortune, the enterprising William Hotham decided upon a cruise in the Syren, a sixth rate of 20 guns. He attacked and drove off the larger 26-gun Télémaque. Then taking over command of the Fortune, during convoy escort duty he closed with and boarded a French privateer. The following\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 04_Seven_Years_War_Chapter_2.3d Page 40 of 44\n\nThe Mediterranean, 1756–8\n\n41\n\nyear the Hampton Court attacked the 36-gun Nymphei, driving her ashore on the Majorcan coastline. This ‘small war’ continued until 1758 when the Mediterranean again became a focus for fleet action.22 Battle of Cartegena, 28 February 1758 The lull in fleet activity had not been for want of trying. In late March 1757 Rear Admiral Charles Saunders, who had by now replaced Hawke in command of the Mediterranean squadron, heard that French ships were finally at sea. This was a small squadron of four ships of the line and a frigate, which were ultimately destined for Louisbourg. On 2 April Saunders sailed from Gibraltar with the 74-gun Culloden, 64-gun Berwick, 60-gun Princess Louisa, and the 50-gun ships Guernsey and Portland. Three days later, in the early evening, Saunders found his prey, and although brought to engagement range, during the night the French slipped away. In May Vice Admiral Henry Osborn, bringing out reinforcements, assumed command.23 Osborn’s squadron would play an important role in a wider strategy, which included naval activity by the Western Squadron in the Channel and naval operations in North America, to prevent the French Mediterranean fleet from reinforcing their position in Louisbourg. While deploying to fulfil this primary task Osborn had an important job to protect British trade from French warships and privateers and to take the war to the enemy, destroying their seaborne trade and raiding coastal areas. In this latter role, the coastline of Provence was attacked, disrupting French preparations at Toulon. This was important, for the French were about to send their Toulon fleet to sea and, they hoped, evade Osborn before heading across the Atlantic. Admiral de la Clue could only muster enough sailors to man six ships of the line when he weighed anchor at Toulon on 8 November 1757. With the onset of the bad winter weather, Osborn had already fallen back upon Gibraltar. When de la Clue found his route out of the Mediterranean blocked he ran for Cartagena. With Spain neutral, Osborn was unable to implement a rigorous blockade and instead, using the facilities at Gibraltar for repair and victuals, deployed his frigates to keep a careful watch over de la Clue while stationing his ships of the line either at Gibraltar or out to\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 04_Seven_Years_War_Chapter_2.3d Page 41 of 44\n\n42\n\nThe Seven Years War\n\nsea. This provided much scope for de la Clue to be tempted out and hopefully destroyed at sea.24 The relief of Louisbourg was the prime French aim for 1758 and, bottled up in Cartagena, de la Clue served no strategic purpose. Admiral Duquesne was sent with five ships of the line to join with de la Clue, allowing the French fleet to force its way past Osborn and head across the Atlantic. Facing the possibility of an enemy fleet concentration but lacking sufficient force to watch the Straits of Gibraltar and Cartagena, Osborn, hearing that de la Clue was at sea on 9 February, cruised to the west of Gibraltar. In fact, de la Clue picked up two of the ships of the line from Toulon then headed back to Cartagena. He now possessed a respectable eight ships of the line with three more expected. Showing a highly professional understanding not only of the strategic context but of wind and weather, Osborn placed his entire squadron between Cartagena and the expected Duquesne. The wind allowed Osborn to reach Cartagena before Duquesne and if it turned, they would be able to beat de la Clue to the Straits.25 The plan was perfectly conceived and executed apart from one vital point: Duquesne had left Toulon and reached Cartagena on 25 February. Here fortune intervened. For three days de la Clue and Duquesne had argued over precedence, and just as they had resolved the dispute Osborn arrived in the nick of time as a gale blew Duquesne into his path. The French ships scattered and Osborn detailed specific ships to chase them down while he took the remainder of the fleet to ensure de la Clue could play no part in what followed. The 50-gun Oriﬂamme was chased and run ashore by the 74-gun Monarch and 64-gun Montagu but she was now on neutral Spanish territory so nothing more could be done. The fast-sailing 26-gun frigate Pleiade escaped but two other French ships were not so lucky. Around 19:00 the 64-gun Orphée was engaged by the 64-gun Revenge, the latter soon supported by the 80-gun Newark and 50-gun Preston. After a short fight the French ship struck. The final success that day was harder fought, involving as it did the French 80-gun Foudroyant carrying the flag of Duquesne heading out to take command at Louisbourg. She was chased by the 64-gun Monmouth, followed by the 70-gun Swiftsure and 64-gun Hampton Court. In the gloom Monmouth’s Captain Arthur Gardiner brought his much superior opponent\n\nI.B.Tauris – Seven Years War\n\nData Standards Ltd, Frome, Somerset – 8/12/2015 04_Seven_Years_War_Chapter_2.3d Page 42 of 44\n\nThe Mediterranean, 1756–8\n\n43\n\nFig. 2.8.

Gardiner had been Byng’s flag captain at Minorca and was determined to seek out glory to eradicate the stain on his and his former admiral’s honour. The action was hot and fought at close range. Gardiner was killed by a musket ball around 21:00. In four and a half hours Monmouth fired 1,546 round, 540 grape and 165 double-headed shot using up 80 barrels of gunpowder. Both ships had their mizzen masts shot away in quick succession, the loss of Foudroyant’s being greeted by loud ‘Huzzas’ as Gardiner’s first lieutenant Robert Carkett continued the fight into the night. Sometime between 00:30 and 01:00 the next morning fire from both combatants died down. They had fought each other to exhaustion. Now the arrival of the Swiftsure sealed the victory. Fired upon by the Foudroyant, one and a half fresh broadsides from the Swiftsure saw the Frenchman strike. It was certainly a bloody fight, Monmouth had lost 28 killed and 79 wounded to the Foudroyant’s 134 killed and 90 wounded.26 Coming after a run of naval failures, in taking two French warships and running another aground Osborn had certainl"
