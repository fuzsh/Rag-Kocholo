In 1807 she was involved in the Battle of Montevideo (1807) in the Rio de la Plata. On 6 January 1807 Pheasant was in company with Leda and Leda at the capture of Ann, Denning, master.\n\nIn 1808 she was stationed with the Channel Fleet. On 8 May she captured the French privateer vessel Tropard, formerly Flying Fish. Then on 20 October 1808, Pheasant was in company when Brilliant captured and destroyed the French privateer Ponte du Jour.\n\nOn 4 November 1809 Pheasant recaptured Traveller.[5] On 16 November 1809 she re-captured the brig Trust, in company with Rhin.\n\nLater on 3 February 1810, she captured the privateer lugger Comte De Hunebourg from St Malo. Pheasant, under the command of Captain John Palmer, lured the privateer close, with the privateer firing the first shot. The two vessels exchanged fire but it took a four-hour chase before Pheasant was able to make the capture. Comte De Hunebourg, of about 80 tons (bm), had been armed with 14 guns, which she threw overboard during the chase, and had a crew of 53 men. She was three days out of Isle of Bas on her second cruise, but had not yet captured anything.\n\nIn October Pheasant recaptured London, of London, which a French privateer had taken. London arrived in Plymouth on 19 October. Pheasant also recaptured Elizabeth, Aiken, master, which had been captured while sailing from Lisbon to Bristol. She arrived in Plymouth on 19 September.\n\nOn 17 June 1811, Pheasant captured Héros.\n\nOn 1 May 1812 Pheasant, with Semiramis and Scylla, was involved in the detention of the American ship Jenny.\n\nLater in 1812 Pheasant was repaired and refitted in Plymouth at a cost of £11,587 (equivalent to £758,050 in 2018). As soon as she was seaworthy, she was back in action and on 14 December 1812 captured the American schooner Hope.\n\nOn 12 March 1813, Pheasant and Warspite captured the schooner William, a U.S. privateer. On 23 April she was in company with Whiting and Scylla. After a chase of over 100 miles, the British vessels captured the American 8-gun brig Fox, which threw two of her guns overboard during the chase.

She was launched on 17 April 1802, and saw active service in the East, but in 1806 a British squadron under Sir John Borlase Warren captured her off La Palma in the Canary Islands. The Admiralty commissioned her into the Royal Navy as HMS Belle Poule. She was sold in 1816.\n\nCapture of the 'Gypsy', 30 April 1812: left to right: HMS Belle Poule, Gypsy, and HMS Hermes, by Thomas Buttersworth\n\nFrench Navy service\n\nIn March 1803, she joined the fleet of Rear-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Léon Durand Linois, whose mission was to re-take the colonies of the Indian Ocean, given to English at the peace of Amiens. The fleet included the 74-gun ship of the line Marengo, the frigates Atalante, Belle Poule and Sémillante, troop ships and cargoes with food and ammunition.\n\nOn 15 June 1803 Belle Poule landed troops at Pondichéry in India. The French fleet however, left the next day and the troops surrendered in September.\n\nAt the beginning of November, the division set sail for Batavia to protect the Dutch colonies. En route, Linois destroyed the English counters in Bencoolen, capturing five ships, and sailed for the South China Sea, where the China Fleet of the British East India Company was expected. The fleets met in the Battle of Pulo Aura, but the greater numbers and aggressive action of the British East Indiamen, some of whom flew Royal Navy flags, drove the French away. Linois returned to Batavia. He dispatched Atalante and Belle Poule to the Gulf of Bengal, where Belle Poule captured a few ships before returning to Ile de France. Among the ships was Althea, which Atalanta and Belle Poule captured on 17 April 1804.\n\nHMS Amazon pursuing unnamed French vessel, possibly the Belle Poule, by Nicholas Pocock\n\nIn 1805 and 1806, Belle Poule and some other ships of the division cruised the African coast between the Red Sea and the Cape of Good Hope, capturing some ships. At the Action of 13 March 1806, Linois met with the division of Vice-Admiral Sir John Warren, with seven ships of the line (including the 108-gun London, the 82-gun Ramilles and Repulse, and the 80-gun Foudroyant), two frigates (including the 48-gun Amazon) and one corvette. After a fierce duel with London, Marengo struck her colours; Belle Poule battled against Amazon and later against Ramillies, and had to surrender as well.\n\nAt the time of her capture Belle Poule was armed with forty 18-pounder guns, had a crew of 320 men, and was under the command of Captain Brouillac. Marengo and Belle Poule had lost 65 men killed and 80 wounded. The British on London and Amazon had 13 officers and men killed and 26 officers and men wounded.\n\nRoyal Navy service\n\nAdriatic\n\nThe capture in 1809 of Var by HMS Belle Poule at Valona harbour off Corfu\n\nShe entered service under the same name in 1808 under captain James Brisbane, joining the forces operating in the Adriatic campaign of 1807-1814 off Corfu, successfully blockading the island. In February 1809 Brisbane captured the storeship Var in a raid on the harbour at Valona. Var was anchored under the guns of two fortresses that nevertheless did not fire their guns, leaving Belle Poule free to concentrate her fire on the French vessel. Var was pierced for 32 guns but only had twenty-two 9-pounder guns and four 24-pounder carronades mounted. She had a crew of 200 men and was under the command of Capitaine de Frigate Palin, however Brisbane was unable to ascertain her losses as her crew abandoned her as she struck. She had been sailing from Corfu for any port in Italy that she could reach. The British then used Var as a storeship too.\n\nBetween 2 and 12 October of the same year Belle Poule was involved in the invasions of the Ionian Islands of Cerigo, Cephalonia, and Zante, and would share in the booty captured there.\n\nOn 10 March 1810 Belle Poule captured Charlotta.\n\nThen a British force attacked the fortress of Santa Maura, which was a French strongpoint off Greece's west coast. Belle Poule's marines formed part of the assault on the enemy's lines; the fortress surrendered on 16 April 1810. Belle Poule had one man, Lieutenant Morrison, of the Royal Marines, wounded at this time. In all, during the siege of Santa Maura, from 31 March to 10 April, Belle Poule suffered six men wounded.\n\nOn 21 August 1810 Belle Poule captured Saint Nicholo. Then on 11 December, Belle Poule captured the brig Carlotta, pierced for 14 guns but with only 10 mounted. She had a crew of 100 men and when captured was sailing from Venice to Corfu. The Royal Navy took her into service as HMS Carlotta. Montague and Acorn shared in the prize money for the hull. At around the same time Belle Poule also assisted at the capture of a French schooner on the Dalmatian Coast.\n\nOn 30 January 1811 Belle Poule, Leonidas, Victorious, and Imogen shared in the capture and destruction of the Italian man-of-war schooner Leoben. Leoben was sailing along the Albanian coast from Venice to Corfu with a cargo of ordnance stores when the British caught her. She was armed with ten guns and a crew of 60 men. Her own crew set her on fire and she subsequently blew up.\n\nFrom 4–5 May 1811, Belle Poule participated with Alceste in an attack on Parenza (Istria). They chased a French 18-gun brig into the harbour but the ships could not close enough to bombard her. Instead, the two vessels landed 200 seamen and all their marines on an island nearby. They then landed two 9-pounders and two howitzers that they placed in one battery, and a field piece that they placed farther away. Eventually, they and the French in Parenza engaged in five hours of mutual bombardment, during which the British were able to sink the brig. They then returned men and cannons to their ships. In the action Belle Poule had one man killed and three wounded and Alcestehad two men killed; all casualties occurred onshore.\n\nBelle Poule then returned to Britain to join the Channel Fleet. On 22 December 1811, Belle Poule and Medusa captured and destroyed two chasse marees.\n\nLines & Profile (ZAZ2722)\n\nWar of 1812\n\nDuring 1812 Belle Poule patrolled the Western Approaches, capturing numerous American merchant vessels and privateers. On 27 January she detained and sent in the Spy from New York. Then she captured Prudentia on 31 January and Don Roderick on 16 February. At the capture of Don Roderick, Belle Poule was in company with Achates, Dryad and Lyra.\n\nOn 30 April 1812, Belle Poule and Hermes captured the American privateer schooner Gipsy or Gipsey, out of New York, in the middle of the Atlantic and after a three-day chase. Gipsey surrendered twice to Hermes and twice got away again before Belle Poule caught her. Gipsey was of 300 tons and was armed with twelve 18-pounder carronades and an 18-pounder gun on a pivot mount.\n\nOn 26 May, Belle Poule captured General Gates while in company with Dryad and Abercrombie. Armide shared by agreement. Three days later Armide captured Purse, and Belle Poule shared by agreement.\n\nIn September 1812 George Harris replaced Brisbane and over the next year Belle Poule captured several American vessels, including four privateers. Warspite and Belle Poule captured Mars and her cargo, on 26 February 1813. On 11 March, Belle Poule and the privateer Earl St Vincent captured the American ship John and Francis, of 220 tons, two guns and 16 men. She was sailing from Bordeaux to New York with a cargo of brandy and wine.\n\nOn 3 April 1813 Belle Poule took Grand Napoleon after a chase of nine hours. She was 29 days from New York, carrying a valuable cargo to Bordeaux. She was a new vessel of 305 tons, pierced for 22 guns but carrying only four, and had a crew of 43 men. Harris described her as \"copper-fastened, and in every respect one of the finest vessels I ever saw.\" That same day Dispatch captured the Prussian vessel Enigheidt. Briton, Belle Poule and Royalist shared by agreement. Belle Poule also captured the American schooner Napoleon, which may have been a different vessel than the Grand Napoleon. With respect to the Napoleon, Belle Poule was in company with Briton and the hired armed cutter Fancy, with Dispatch and Royalist sharing by agreement.\n\nBelle Poule and Pyramus on 20 April 1813 took the 10-gun letter of marque schooner Zebra and her crew of 38 men. Zebra was sailing from Bordeaux to New York. At the time of the capture Andromache was in sight. The navy took Zebra into service as Pictou\n\nOn 11 May Belle Poule took Revenge after a chase that lasted from 5 p.m. the previous evening until 2am. Revenge was a new vessel, sailing from Charleston to Bordeaux. She had a crew of 32 men and was pierced for 16 guns but carried only four long 9-pounders.\n\nOn 20 September Belle Poule captured two French chasse marees. the first was Rose, of 32 tons and five men, sailing from Bordeaux to Nantes. The second was Ambition, of 25 tons and three men, sailing from Bordeaux to Rochelle.\n\nLastly, on 14 December Belle Poule took the brig Squirrel, which was sailing from Arcasson, in the Gironde, to New York. The brig was of 169 tons, armed with two guns and had a crew of 17 men. Belle Poule was in company with Castilian and Tartarus.\n\nIn 1814 Belle Poule was under Captain Edward Williams. Then she entered the Gironde in Southern France. Before 9 April, a landing party of seamen and marines from Belle Poule, under Captain George Harris, marched 50 miles, successively entering and destroying the batteries of Pointe Coubre, Pointe Nègre, Royan, Soulac, and Mèche. In all, the landing party destroyed forty-seven 36-pounder guns and seventeen 13\" mortars. On his return from this expedition, Harris organized the siege of the fortress at Blaye. Rear Admiral Penrose then had Belle Poule sail up the Gironde, \"in advance of the advanced squadron\".\n\nFollowing a request from the Duke of Wellington, Belle Poule was commissioned as a troopship in June under Captain Francis Baker. She was fitted for that role in August and September. On 15 August she was in Plymouth, having come from Portsmouth with the 93d Regiment of Foot. On 17 September she embarked troops before sailing for Bermuda the next day and then on to New Orleans. The 93rd would then serve at the Battle of New Orleans, where they would take heavy casualties.\n\nBelle Poule was part of the flotilla at the battle of New Orleans. In the run-up to that battle her boats participated in the Battle of Lake Borgne on 12–14 December 1814. Her only casualties were two men slightly wounded. Many years later her crew received a distribution of head-money arising from the capture of American gun-boats and sundry bales of cotton at the battle. In 1847, the Admiralty issued the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \"14 Dec. Boat Service 1814\" to all surviving claimants from the action.\n\nFate\n\nBelle Poule returned to Portsmouth on 17 May 1815. A week later she sailed for Cork. She was converted to a prison hulk in 1815. She was sold on 11 June 1816 for ₤2,700.\n\nNo scale.

Prowse, took Bergere (18), Cptn. Chaney Duolvis, at Civita Vecchia.\n\nHMS Sirius was a 36-gun fifth-rate frigate of the Royal Navy. Between 1797 and 1805, the Sirius was engaged in maintaining the blockade of Napoleonic Europe. She was lost in 1810 when her crew scuttled her after she grounded during the Battle of Grand Port.\n\nThe Sirius stranded on a coral shoal. Lithograph by A. Meyer (National Maritime Museum, London)\n\nDesign\n\nSirius general arrangement plan (National Maritime Museum, Greenwich)\n\nThe Admiralty ordered her construction on 30 April 1795, and the keel was laid at the Dudman's yard at Deptford Wharf in September of that year. She was launched on 12 April 1797. The Sirius class of 1795 was established following the taking of the HMS San Fiorenzo ex French Minerve, upon whose lines this frigate was based.\n\nFrench Revolutionary Wars\n\nSirius was commissioned in May 1797 under the command of Captain Richard King. In her first action on 24 October 1798 Sirius took two Dutch ships, the Waakzaamheid and the Furie in the Texel. Waakzaamheid was under the command of Senior Captain Neirrop. She was armed with twenty-four 9-pounder guns on her main deck and two 6-pounders on her forecastle. She had 100 Dutch seamen aboard her, as well as 122 French troops, and was carrying 2000 stands of arms as well as other ordnance stores. Waakzaamheid put up no struggle. The sloop Kite shared in the capture.\n\nCapture of the Furie & Waakzamheid, 23 October 1798 - Thomas Whitcombe, 1816.\n\nFurie was armed with twenty-six 12-pounders on her main deck and ten 6-pounders on her quarter-deck and forecastle. She had a crew of 153 Dutch seamen, augmented with 165 French soldiers. She was carrying 4,000 stands of arms as well as other ordnance stores. Furie did exchange fire with Sirius for about half an hour. Sirius had only one man wounded. Furie had eight men killed and 14 wounded. The sloop Martin and the hired armed cutter Diligent shared in the proceeds of the capture.\n\nSirius was among the vessels that shared in the capture on 25 and 28 November of a French brig and sloop. The British vessels included Clyde, Fisguard, and Sylph, as well as the hired armed cutters Joseph, Fowey and Dolly.\n\nThen on 6 January 1800 Sirius shared with Defiance, Unicorn, Indefatigable and Stag in the capture of the French brig Ursule.\n\nOn 12 June Sirius and Indefatigable captured the French privateer Vengeur. She was armed with six long 4-pounders and ten 18-pounder carronades, and carried a crew of 102 men. She was two days out of Bordeaux and sailing for the coast of Brazil. Vengeur was sailing in company with three letters of marque - a ship, a brig and a schooner - that were bound for Guadeloupe. On 11 June Vengeur had captured the Jersey-privateer lugger Snake.\n\nOn 3 July Sirius recaptured the brig Cultivator. Indefatigable and Boadicea were in company at the time of the capture. Cultivator, Smith, master, had been sailing from Demerara to London when the French privateer Minerve, of Bordeaux, had captured her.\n\nThe next day, Sirius and Indefatigable captured the French ship Favori. Eleven days later, Bordelais captured the French vessel Phoenix. Sirius was among the vessels sharing in the prize money by agreement. Sirius shared in the capture of the French privateer schooner Revanche on 28 July. The actual captor was Uranie. Revanche was armed with fourteen 6-pounder guns and had a crew of 80 men. She was 19 days out of Vigo and had already captured and sent in the English brig Marcus, a Portuguese ship, and a Spanish brig that had been a prize to Minerve.\n\nOn 11 December Sirius captured the Spanish merchant brig Melchora, some three miles off Sifarga (Illas Sisargas, some 20 miles west of A Coruña). The brig was 24 hours out of A Coruña on her way to Montevideo when Siriuscaptured her. Captain King reported the capture in order to draw attention to the fact that she was the only vessel to have left A Coruña since August. Diamond shared in the proceeds of the capture.\n\nOn 26 January 1801, the British frigate Oiseau encountered the French frigate Dédaigneuse and gave chase. Sirius and Amethyst joined the next day. On the 28th Oiseau and Sirius effected the capture while unfavorable winds kept Amethyst from joining the action. Dédaigneuse was brought into the Royal Navy as HMS Dedaigneuse. The next day Sirius was in company with Amethyst when they captured the Spanish letter of marque Charlotta of Ferol, 16 hours out of Ferol on her way to Curaçao. The capture took place about six or seven leagues from Cape Belem in Galicia. The hired armed cutter Earl of St Vincent shared in the capture.\n\nOn 29 January Atalante captured and destroyed the Spanish privateer Intrepido Cid. Sirius and Amethyst shared, by agreement, in the bounty-money.\n\nSirius shared by agreement in the proceeds of the capture of the Temeraire (30 May) and the Bien Aimé (23 July). In July Sirius was under the temporary command of Captain J.B. Edwards. In July Commander John Edwards took command temporarily.\n\nIn July–August 1802, Sirius was under the command of Captain King, who further had command of a small squadron on anti-smuggling duties. The other vessels in the squadron were Carysfort, Imogen, Rosario, and Peterell.\n\nIn August 1802, Captain William Prowse took command of Sirius.\n\nNapoleonic Wars\n\nAfter the resumption of hostilities with France, Sirius took part in the blockade of Brest.\n\nOn 18 May 1803, Sirius and Nemesis captured Mere de Familie. Ten days later Sirius captured the French ship Achille and then on 8 June Trois Freres. The capture of Aigle on 30 May resulted in a preliminary allotment to Sirius's crew of £6200 in prize money. Two days earlier Sirius had captured Zephyr. Sirius shared with Nemesis the proceeds of the capture of Trois Freres and Aigle.\n\nSirius then was among the vessels sharing in the salvage money from the recapture of Lord Nelson on 27 August. Similarly, Sirius shared in the salvage money for Perseverance, recaptured on 28 October.\n\nOn 15 February 1805, Sirius recaptured Spring. On 22 July Sirius participated in Calder's Action (Battle of Cape Finisterre (1805)). She shared in the prize money for the Spanish ships St. Raphael and Firme, and possibly other vessels as well.\n\nTrafalgar\n\nOn 21 October, Sirius joined the British fleet under Vice Admiral Lord Nelson at Trafalgar. Entering battle to the north of the weather column, her station placed her only a few cable lengths from HMS Victory.\n\nParliament voted a grant of £300,000 to be distributed in September 1806 among the participants of the battle. Other distributions of prize money followed. In 1847 the Admiralty would issue surviving claimants from the battle the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \"Trafalgar\".\n\nOn 25 November, Sirius, Prince and Swiftsure captured Nemesis.\n\nSirius vs. Bergère\n\nIn January 1806, Sirius and the 74-gun Polyphemus were escorting a convoy from Gibraltar when they encountered a French squadron under Admiral Willaumez. The French succeeded in capturing two of the merchant vessels and four of the French fleet unsuccessfully chased Sirius for two hours, but forcing her to separate from the convoy.\n\nFrom then until 1808 Sirius served in the Mediterranean. On 17 April 1806 at 2pm Sirius was five or six leagues off Civitavecchia when Prowse received intelligence that a French force had sailed that morning for Naples. He immediately set out and succeeded in catching up with them just after sunset two leagues from the mouth of the Tiber River. The force consisted of a ship, three corvettes, and five heavy gun-vessels, and they were deployed in line of battle near a dangerous shoal, awaiting Sirius's attack. The action commenced at 7pm and lasted for two hours before the French ship leading the flotilla struck. The water had been calm so the French had been able to fire well and Sirius herself was too damaged to pursue when the remainder of the French flotilla withdrew; Prowse was also concerned about the risks of pursuit at night in water with shoals.\n\nThe captured vessel was the Bergère, which was under the command of capitaine de frégate Charles-Jacques-César Chaunay-Duclos, commodore of the flotilla and member of the Legion of Honor. She was armed with eighteen 12-pounder guns and one 36-pounder obusier, and had a crew of 189 men. Prowse described her as \"remarkably fine Vessel, sails well, and is fit for His Majesty's Service.\" Prowse omitted mention of French casualties, but Sirius lost nine men killed, including Prowse's nephew, and 20 men wounded, nine dangerously so. This action too qualified the surviving claimants for the Naval General Service Medal, this time with the clasp \"Sirius 17 April 1806\".\n\nBetween April 1808 and January 1809 Sirius was at Chatham, undergoing repairs. In November 1808 Captain Samuel Pym assumed command of Sirius. On 24 February 1809 he sailed for the Cape of Good Hope and the Indian Ocean.\n\nIndian Ocean\n\nOn 2 March 1809 Sirius captured the French schooner Mecontent, and her cargo. In August Sirius joined a squadron under Commodore Josias Rowley and on 21 September participated in an attack on Saint-Paul, Réunion.\n\nMain article: Raid on Saint-Paul\n\nSirius and HMS Raisonnable captured the French frigate Caroline. She was taken into British service as HMS Bourbonaise, there already being an HMS Caroline. The British also recaptured several East Indiamen that Caroline had captured, and the East India Company's brig Grappler. The land attack succeeded in capturing a number of shore batteries and guns. Sirius suffered the loss of two marines killed, two marines wounded, and one sailor missing.\n\nThe summer of 1810 saw a campaign against the French Indian Ocean possessions. The British captured the Île Bourbon (Réunion) in July. In August, they turned their attention to Mauritius, where they attempted to land troops to destroy coastal batteries and signals around Grand Port; the attempt turned sour, however, when two French forty-gun frigates, Bellone and Minerve, the 18-gun corvette Victor, and two East Indiaman prizes entered the harbour and took up defensive positions at the head of the main entrance channel. The French also moved the channel markers to confuse the British approach.\n\nMain article: Battle of Grand Port\n\nOn 23 August 1810 the British squadron entered the channel. Sirius was the first to run aground, followed by Magicienne and Néréide. Iphigenia prudently anchored in the channel some distance from the action. The French vessels concentrated all their gunfire first against Néréide and then against Magicienne.\n\nThe battle continued without interruption all night and on 24 August the French boarded the defenceless Néréide. Once the French flag was hoisted on what was left of the foremast of the Néréide, Magicienne and the Sirius began an intense cross fire against their enemies. Still, in the evening her crew had to abandon Magicienne, setting her on fire as they left her.\n\nLoss\n\nScuttling of Sirius\n\nEvery effort to kedge Sirius off failed; she was firmly aground, making water, and unable to be freed. Pym ordered stores and provisions to be transferred to Iphigenia. When this was complete the men were removed with the last of the crew leaving on the morning of 25 August 1810. As they left they set fire to her; Sirius exploded at about eleven o'clock, with her hull then briefly drifting off the reef before sinking.\n\nThe Battle of Grand Port was an important victory for the French. With two English frigates taken (Iphigenia and Néréide), and two others destroyed (Sirius and Magicienne), as well as 1,600 prisoners taken against 150 French dead or wounded, this battle marks the only French naval victory of the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nPost script\n\nToday Sirius lies in some 20–25 metres of water. The wreck has been broken up, as much by salvors as by her scuttling. Still, the site is of archaeological interest and many of her cannon rest exposed.\n\nSt Fiorenzo and Piedmontaise March 9th 1808\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_St_Fiorenzo_(1794)\n\nToday in Naval History - Naval / Maritime Events in History\n\n17 April 1810 – Launch of HMS Menelaus, a Royal Navy 38-gun fifth rate frigate, at Plymouth\n\nHMS Menelaus was a Royal Navy 38-gun fifth rate frigate, launched in 1810 at Plymouth.\n\nHMS Menelaus (ship in center) sailing with three other ships from a 19th century watercolor painting by artist, William Innes Pocock\n\nCareer\n\nMenelaus entered service in 1810 under the command of Captain Peter Parker, and within weeks of commissioning was involved in the suppression of a mutiny aboard HMS Africaine. The notoriously brutal Captain Robert Corbet had been appointed to command Africaine and the crew had protested and refused to allow him to board. The Admiralty sent three popular officers to negotiate with the crew and ordered Menelaus to come alongside. If the crew of Africaine refused to agree with the appointment of Corbet, Parker had been ordered to fire on the ship until they submitted. The crew eventually agreed to allow Corbet aboard and Menelaus was not needed. In the summer of 1810, Parker was ordered to sail for the Indian Ocean to reinforce the squadron operating against Île de France and participated in the capture of the island in December 1810.\n\nIn 1812, Menelaus was part of the blockade of Toulon in the Mediterranean and operated against coastal harbours, shipping and privateers off the southern coast of France with some success. In 1813, Menelaus was transferred to the Atlantic for service convoying merchant ships to Canada in the War of 1812. On 23 March she captured Le Nouveau Phoenix.\n\nMenelaus was subsequently employed in raiding American positions along the Maryland coastline, destroying a coastal convoy in September. In 1814, Parker was ordered to operate against French ships in the Atlantic and recaptured a valuable Spanish merchant ship in January.\n\nFollowing the French surrender, Menelaus returned to service off the American seaboard. Menelaus 'was sent up the Chesapeake to divert the attention of the enemy in that quarter,' whilst General Ross's force was landed at Benedict. Thereafter, Peter Parker was killed at the Battle of Caulk's Field in Kent County, Maryland, on 30 August 1814. From 13 to 15 September, Menelaus was present at the Battle of Baltimore, with one of her complement, William Pritchard, being hospitalised after losing two fingers.\n\nOn 19 July 1815, Menelaus was in company with Havannah, Rhin, Sealark, Ferret and Fly when they captured the French vessels Fortune, Papillon, Marie Graty, Marie Victorine, Cannoniere, and Printemps. The attack took place at Corrijou (Koréjou, east of Abervrach on the coast of Brittany), and during the action Ferret was able to prevent the escape of a French man-of-war brig that she forced ashore. Apparently, this cutting out expedition was the last of the war.\n\nLater career and fate\n\nFollowing Parker's death, command passed to Edward Dix and he remained on the ship until she was laid up at Sheerness in 1818. In 1820 she moved to Chatham and in 1832 became a hospital ship, becoming the quarantine ship at Sandgate Street. She was eventually sold 87 years after her construction, in 1897.\n\nHMS Macedonian (left) of the Lively class, painting of its engagement with USS United States, 1812, by Thomas Birch\n\nThe Lively class were a successful class of sixteen British Royal Navy 38-gun sailing frigates.\n\nOrigins\n\nThe Lively class were a series of sixteen ships built to a 1799 design by Sir William Rule, which served in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars. The prototype and name ship of the class was HMS Lively of 1804. In contemporary usage the class was referred to as the 'Repeat Lively class'. As such the prototype ship was not considered to be part of the class at the time.\n\nThey were considered the most successful British frigate design of the period, much prized by the Navy Board; after the prototype was launched in 1804 (by which time four more frigates had already been ordered to the same design), a further eleven sister-ships were ordered to her design, although this was slightly modified (in 1805) to have the gangways between forecastle and quarterdeck more integrated into the upperworks, a step towards the final enclosure of the waist. This was reinforced in 1809 by the abandonment of breastworks at the break of the quarterdeck and forecastle and in 1810 by the narrowing of the waist by the addition of gratings inboard of the gangways. At the same date, 'top riders', angled reinforcing timbers for the upperworks, were discontinued.\n\nCharacteristics and performance\n\nThe captain's reports on the performance of this class were remarkable for their absence of serious criticism. The vessels of the class were fast, recording 13kts large and 10-11kts close-hauled, weatherly and manoeuvrable. They were excellent heavy-weather ships, perfectly able to cope with a \"head sea.\" They stowed their provisions well; they were capable of stowing provisions and freshwater for up to six months of cruising. Indeed \"riding light,\" after a substantial proportion of fresh water and provisions had been consumed, affected their sailing qualities adversely, so that most captains filled any emptied freshwater stowage capacity with seawater.\n\nLively class 38-gun fifth rates 1804-13, designed by William Rule.\n\nHMS Lively 1804\n\nHMS Resistance 1805\n\nHMS Apollo 1805\n\nHMS Hussar 1807\n\nHMS Statira 1807\n\nHMS Horatio 1807\n\nHMS Spartan 1806\n\nHMS Undaunted 1807\n\nHMS Menelaus 1810\n\nHMS Nisus 1810\n\nHMS Macedonian 1810\n\nHMS Crescent 1810\n\nHMS Bacchante 1811\n\nHMS Nymphe 1812\n\nHMS Sirius 1813\n\nHMS Laurel 1813\n\nScale: 1:48.

A duplicate set were dispatched on the Hon East India Company ship 'Tigris' in 1814. This plan was sent to Devonport, arriving on 20 January 1875. The plan was later sent to Chatham, arriving 8 July 1893, for making a half-model of 'Shannon' for the museum in the R. N. College, Greenwich\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Menelaus_(1810)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lively-class_frigate\n\nhttps://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections.html#!csearch;searchTerm=Lively_(1804\n\nToday in Naval History - Naval / Maritime Events in History\n\n17 April 1813 – Launch of HMS Cydnus, one of eight Royal Navy 38-gun Cydnus-class fifth-rates.\n\nHMS Cydnus was one of eight Royal Navy 38-gun Cydnus-class (sub-class of Leda-class) fifth-rates. This frigate was built in 1813 at Blackwall Yard, London, and broken up in 1816.\n\nDesign, construction and armament\n\nThe entire class was a version of the Leda-class frigates, but built of red fir (pine), which was cheaper and more abundant than oak. Most importantly, it permitted noticeably faster construction, but at a cost of reduced durability.\n\nTo enable the new frigate to meet the American frigates on less unequal terms, Cydnus, and her sister Eurotas received medium 24-pounders and an increased complement of men. Cydnus's 24-pounders were of a design by General Sir Thomas Blomefield, 1st Baronet and measured 7 ft. 6 in. in length while weighing about 40 cwt. The 24-pounders on Eurotas were to a design by Colonel Congreve.\n\nDuring December 1813 and January 1814, Cyndus and Eurotas actually temporarily exchanged six 24-pounders, presumably to enable both vessels to test the designs against each other. Ultimately, the Royal Navyadopted General Blomefield's design.\n\nService\n\nCydnus was commissioned in May 1813 under Captain Frederick W. Aylmer, but command passed later that month to Captain Frederick Langford. On 2 December, Briton captured Wolf's Cove, while Cydnus and a squadron were in company.\n\nOn 8 January 1814, Cydnus recaptured the English ship Rachael and Ann, of 14 guns, 226 tons, and 20 men. She had been sailing from Buenos Aires for London.\n\nOn 14 March 1814 Cydnus and Pomone captured the American privateer Bunker's Hill, of 14 guns and 86 men. Though Bunker's Hill had been known for her past successes, on this cruise she was eight days out of Morlaix without having captured anything. Bunker's Hill was the former Royal Navy cutter Linnet, which the French frigate Gloire had taken on 25 February 1813 near Madeira. Cydnus carried out convoy duties to the East Indies in 1814.\n\nCydnus served in the operations against New Orleans in 1814. Her boats participated in the British victory at the Battle of Lake Borgne. On 8 December 1814, two US gunboats fired on Sophie, Armide, and the sixth-rate frigate Seahorse while the British were passing the chain of small islands that runs parallel to the shore between Mobile and Lake Borgne.\n\nMain article: Battle of Lake Borgne\n\nBetween 12 and 15 December 1814 Captain Lockyer of Sophie led a flotilla of some 50 boats, barges, gigs, and launches to attack the US gunboats. Lockyer drew his flotilla from the fleet that was massing against New Orleans, including the 74-gun Third Rate Tonnant, Armide, Cydnus, Seahorse, Manly, and Meteor.\n\nLockyer deployed the boats in three divisions, of which he led one. Captain Montresor of the gun-brig Manly commanded the second, and Captain Roberts of Meteor commanded the third. After rowing for 36 hours, the British met the Americans at St. Joseph's Island. On 13 December 1814, the British attacked the one-gun schooner USS Sea Horse. On the morning of the 14th, the British engaged the Americans in a short, violent battle.\n\nThe British captured or destroyed almost the entire American force, including the tender, USS Alligator, and five gunboats. The British lost 17 men killed and 77 wounded; Cydnus had four men wounded. Anaconda then evacuated the wounded. In 1821 the survivors of the flotilla shared in the distribution of head-money arising from the capture of the American gun-boats and sundry bales of cotton. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \"14 Dec Boat Service 1814\" to all surviving claimants from the action.\n\nOn 18 January 1815, Captain the Honourable William Henry Percy faced a court martial on board Cydnus, off Cat Island, Mississippi for the loss of his vessel, Hermes, during his unsuccessful attack at the Battle of Fort Bowyer in September 1814. The court acquitted him of all blame, finding that the attack was justified.\n\nLangford died early in 1815 at Jamaica. Sir Alexander Cochrane appointed Captain Robert Cavendish Spencer, of the sloop Carron, to command Cydnus in 1815, for his efforts in Louisiana and Florida. Spencer then spent a month camped at Prospect Bluff on the Apalachicola River with Britain's Indian allies, charged with settling their claims and dismissing them from British service. Apparently he left them with some cannons as well. Lieutenant Colonel Edward Nicolls received orders to withdraw his troops from the fort at Prospect Bluff. In accordance with Cochrane's orders, the Cydnus was moored off Prospect Bluff, and embarked the Royal Marine detachment on 22 April, arriving at Bermuda on 13 June 1815, to allow the detachment to rejoin the 3rd Battalion as a supernumerary company. Thereafter Cydnus sailed to Halifax, arriving on 24 June 1815.\n\nFate\n\nCydnus was then paid off. The Napoleonic Wars had ended and as she was not durable, she was broken up at Portsmouth in February 1816.\n\nCydnus was among the ships and vessels under the command of-Admiral Lord Viscount Keith entitled to share in the Parliamentary grant for service in 1813 and 1814.\n\nsistership\n\nScale 1:60. A contemporary full hull model of ‘Pomone’ (1805) a 38-gun frigate fifth-rate ship of the line. The model is decked, equipped and partially rigged, and represents a ship measuring 150 feet along the lower deck by 40 feet in the beam and a tonnage of 1076 builder’s old measurement. The upper deck was armed with twenty eight 18-pounder guns, eight 9-pounders on the quarterdeck and two 12-pounder guns on the forecastle. It was originally thought that this model depicted the French ‘Pomone’, a 44-gun frigate launched in 1785 and later captured by the British in 1794. However, at this scale, the beam is too great and it is doubtful as to whether any French frigate of this date would have had the rounded forecastle bulkhead. The model dimensions do fit almost exactly the British ‘Pomone’ that was built by Brindley of Frinsburg, Kent, and launched in 1805. This ship spent most of its career off the French Atlantic coast and is credited with the capture of the Neapolitan privateer ‘Lucien Charles’ in 1809, as well as taking part in the action in Rosas Bay in the same year. She was eventually wrecked off the Needles in 1811. This model is complete with a number of interesting features such as the full set of ship’s boats in the waist and on the stern davits, covered hammock netting on the bulwarks, and rather uniquely, the ship is shown ‘in ordinary’ or laid up with the topmasts and bowsprit struck and stored in their lowered position. The model was once in the possession of Sir Edward Reynell Anson (1902-51), 6th Baronet.\n\nThe Leda-class frigates, were a successful class of forty-seven British Royal Navy 38-gun sailing frigates constructed from 1805-1832. Based on a French design, the class came in five major groups, all with minor differences in their design. During their careers, they fought in the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812. Forty-five of the 47 were eventually scrapped; two still exist.\n\nOrigins\n\nThe design of the name ship, Leda of 1800, was based on Sané's design for the French Hébé-class frigate. The British 44-gun fifth rate HMS Rainbow captured Hébé in 1782. (The British took Hébé into service as HMS Hebe but in 1805 renamed her HMS Blonde). The class of frigates built to the lines of Leda were in contemporary parlance called the 'Repeat Leda class'.\n\nPomone and Shannon, the second and third ship of the class respectively, was built using Josiah Brindley's patent method of construction which dispensed with 'lodging' and 'hanging knees', oak elements which had to be grown to shape. Oak suitable for shipbuilding had become increasingly difficult to obtain through the long period of warfare. Bindleys fastenings proved to be weak. Captain Philip Broke of the Shannon claimed her topsides were weak and \"worked like a basket.\" Shannon was actually in such poor condition by 1813 that she almost missed her engagement with the USS Chesapeake.\n\nCharacteristics and performance\n\nThe vessels of the class were fast, most recording 13 knots (24 km/h; 15 mph) large and 10 knots (19 km/h; 12 mph) close-hauled. However, their French-style proportions made them unweatherly compared to frigates designed to British proportions (such as the Lively class). Many captains requested additions to the frigates' false keels to remedy this. The Leda class stood to their canvas well and liked a stiff gale, but were prone to excessive pitching in very heavy seas. All captains complained of the class's poor stowage capacity, the result of their fine French underwater lines, but stowage improved after the introduction of iron fresh-water tanks. Lastly, captains considered the class to be \"wet\", a result of lively rolling and pitching causing seams to loosen.\n\nShips of the class\n\nHMS Pomone\n\nThe name Leda was taken from Greek mythology, as was common at the time; the Greek Leda was a woman whom Zeus seduced while he was masquerading as a swan. After Leda, the Admiralty had no more ships to this design for several years. Then with the resumption of war with France either looming or under way, the Admiralty ordered eight further ships to this design in 1802-09:\n\nIn 1812 the Admiralty ordered eight ships to be built of \"fir\" (actually, of red pine) instead of oak; these were sometimes called the Cydnus class:\n\nHMS Cydnus\n\nHMS Eurotas\n\nHMS Niger\n\nHMS Meander\n\nHMS Pactolus\n\nHMS Tiber\n\nHMS Araxes\n\nHMS Tanais\n\nScale: 1:48.

She made numerous cruises until 1813–1814 when the British and the Americans repeatedly captured her. In her brief career as an American privateer she captured some 14 vessels. She finally ending up in British hands and was taken to Halifax, Nova Scotia as a prize.\n\nFrench privateer\n\nCaptain Martin Jorlis commissioned Invincible Napoleon in spring 1804.\n\nShe made another cruise in 1807 under Captain Michel Garat.\n\nFrom November 1809 to March 1810 she was under the command of Captain François Dermit. Her owner was Maisonnave, Bayonne. She captured three prizes: Mary Anne, Marie Thérèse, and Huron. Invincible Napoleon captured Huron, Clarke, master, on 21 February 1810 at 41°N 34°W as Huron was sailing from Virginia to Cadiz. HMS Vestal recaptured Huron on 4 February; Huron arrived at Cowes on 16 February.\n\nOn 28 February 1810, Invincible Napoleon captured Bellona, Ross, master, at 36°N 35°W as Bellona was sailing from London to Amelia Island, Florida. The French set their prize on fire, scuttling her; Invincible Napoleon carried the crew into Bordeaux.\n\nLater in 1810 Invincible Napoleon made another cruise under Captain Jorlis.\n\nIn January 1811, she took the name Invincible, and did several more cruises under Captain Jorlis between February 1811 and April 1813. Lloyd's List reported on 29 January 1811 that Invincible Napoleon had captured Hope, Orchard, master, as Hope was sailing from Newfoundland to Poole. However, HMS Armide recaptured Hope, which arrived at Plymouth on 23 January. On 25 January Invincible Bonaparte had captured Sir Sydney Smith, Lewis, master, at 25°N 47°W as Sir Sydney Smith was coming to England from Prince Edward Island. Invincible Bonaparte put on board Sir Sydney Smith the crews of three vessels that Invincible Bonaparte had captured and burnt:\n\nPriscilla, Connell, master, from Malta to London;\n\nClyde, Norris, master, from St Michael; and\n\nBolina, Atkins, master, from Plymouth to Boston.\n\nSir Sydney Smith arrived at Plymouth on 2 February. Also on 2 February Invincible Bonapart captured Packet, from Boston to Liverpool. HMS Fortunee recaptured Packet and sent her into Cork.\n\nAlso in February Invincible Napoleon captured the American vessel Sally, Webber, master, as Sally was sailing from Charleston to Liverpool. The sloop of war HMS Acteon recaptured Sally, which arrived at Plymouth on 13 February.\n\nCaptures and recaptures\n\nCaptured: On 17 April 1813, HMS Mutine captured Invincible, or Invincible Napoleon, off Spain. Mutine took her crew, some of whom were Americans, prisoner. Mutine had suffered only two men slightly wounded in the engagement. Mutine sent Invincible into Oporto.\n\nRecaptured twice: The American privateer Alexander, of Salem, recaptured Invincible, or Invincible Napoleon, on 27 April 1813 at 47°46′N 18°00′W, or in the Channel. She had arrived within sight of Salem when the frigates Shannon and Tenedos on 16 May chased her on shore. She was out of range of the guns of the fort at Cape Ann and a few shots from the frigates dispersed the militia that had gathered. The frigates then sent their boats in and succeeded in recovering her. The British sent Invincible to Halifax, Nova Scotia.\n\nFourth capture: Invincible did not reach Halifax. The American privateer Young Teazer re-re-captured her and sent her into Portland, where she arrived around 1 June.\n\nAmerican privateer & fifth capture\n\nInvincible became an American privateer based in Salem, Massachusetts under the command of Captain Peter Destebecho, or New York, under the command and ownership of Peter Destebecho, Jr. She was commissioned on 18 December. Consequently, there are references to \"Invincible, of Salem\", or \"Invincible of New York\". She captured 14 or 15 vessels, of which only five reached American ports, in part because she didn't bother to take as prizes a number of small vessels.\n\nAmerican records report that Invincible captured one ship sailing from Liverpool to Antigua in ballast that she sent into Wilmington. This may have been Lady Prevost, of London.\n\nLloyd's List reported on 5 April 1814 that in December the American privateer Invincible Napoleon had captured Prince Regent, Hewson, master, as Prince Regent was sailing from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Nassau, but had then given Prince Regent up. Prince Regentarrived at Nassau on 6 January 1814. Before sending Prince Regent on her way, Invincible took Prince Regent's armament.\n\nInvincible captured other vessels as well:\n\nNimble, carrying West Indian produce and sent into Teneriffe, where she was found not seaworthy and the cargo was disposed off;\n\nCutter Lyon, with dry goods and hardware, divested and released;\n\nBrig Portsea, of eight guns;\n\nBrig Conway, of ten guns, carrying dry goods, and sent to Cambden, Maine, after having her cargo removed;\n\nSchooner Francis and Lucy, with fish, oil, and lumber, and converted into a cartel to repatriate the crews of vessels Invincible had captured; and,\n\nBrig Margaretta, carrying wine.\n\nInvincible then put into Charleston, South Carolina, \"full of valuable goods.\" After sailing from Charleston, Invincible captured six more British vessels before the British captured her:\n\nBrig Daniel, of Newfoundland;\n\nWilliam, from St Andrews to Greenock;\n\nVittorio, from Jersey to Newfoundland;\n\nAdventure, from Bermuda to Halifax;\n\nWanderer, from Newfoundland to Corunna; and\n\nHelen, Holmes, master, from Havana to Greenock.\n\nArmide captured Invincible on 16 August. Endymion and Pique were in company with Armide at the time.\n\nInvincible arrived at Halifax on 21 August. Invincible had been sailing from Charleston to New York when the British captured her after a long chase during which she had thrown ten of her guns overboard.\n\nHMS Wasp recaptured Helen, which then arrived at Halifax on 18 August. HMS Tenedos recaptured Wanderer and bought her into Halifax on 22 August. Lloyd's List further reported that Invincible gave up her other four prizes to their masters and crews.\n\nThe records of the Halifax Vice admiralty court report that Invincible was carrying 314 tierces and 103 hall tierces of rice, 77 boxes of sugar, and cargo from Helen.\n\nsistership\n\nScale: 1:48. Plan showing the body plan with stern board outline, sheer lines with scroll figurehead, and longitudinal half-breadth for Cruiser (1797)\n\nHMS Mutine was a Royal Navy 18-gun Cruizer class brig-sloop, built by Henry Tucker at Bideford and launched in 1806. During her career she was under fire in Danish waters, in the Bay of Biscay, and at Algiers. She also visited North America, South America, and the West Coast of Africa. She was sold in 1819.\n\nCareer\n\nDanish waters\n\nIn August 1806 Commander Hew (or Hugh) Stewart (or Steuart) commissioned Mutine, which underwent fitting out at Plymouth for the North Sea and the Baltic Sea until February 1807. She then participated in Britain's attack on Copenhagen and the subsequent Gunboat War with Denmark.\n\nMutine's first duties involved escorting the King's German Legion to and from the island of Rügen. In preparation for the attack on Copenhagen. In August 1807, she covered the landings of British troops at Køge, south of Copenhagen, where they set up a battery north of Køge in preparation for laying siege to the Danish capital.\n\nThe Danish deployed gun-vessels in an attempted to disrupt the operations. The British countered with a flotilla consisting of Mutine, Hebe and Cruizer, and four bomb vessels, Thunder, Vesuvius, Aetna and Zebra. Captain Peter Puget of Goliath took command of the flotilla and deployed to protect the troops.\n\nOn 22 August a Danish flotilla of three praams, each carrying 20 guns, and over 30 gunboats, attacked the inshore squadron off the entrance to Copenhagen's harbour. Several floating batteries and block-ships added their support to the Danish flotilla by also firing on the British vessels. The battle lasted for four hours, but resulted in little damage and few casualties, thought the Danes did drive back the British.\n\nMutine and Bonetta were among the British vessels sharing in the prize money arising from the capture of the Hans and Jacob (17 August), Odifiord (4 September) and Benedicta (12 September).\n\nOn 2 October, the Juliana, out of Liverpool had encountered and driven off a French privateer 200 miles west of Scilly. The next day, Juliana spotted a brig, and after closing on her under a French flag, raised the English flag and boarded her. Suspicious because her captain was carrying several different sets of papers, Captain Bibby of the Juliana planned to take her into Liverpool. Mutine arrived on the scene in the evening, and after ascertaining the situation, Captain Stewart took over the prize vessel, by now identified as the Joannah, and put his own crew aboard her.\n\nSouth America\n\nBy May 1808 command of the Mutine had passed to Commander Charles Montague Fabian. He sailed to Sierra Leone via Madeira and Gorée, to deliver the new governor of the colony, Thomas Perronet Thompson. Mutine then returned to Britain. Fabian sailed for Brazil on 8 November.\n\nMutine was part of the squadron under Rear Admiral Michael de Courcy when Agamemnon wrecked near the island of Gorita in the Rio de Plata on 20 June 1809. Her carpenter joined those of Agamemnon, Bedford, Elizabeth and Foudroyant in signing a document attesting that although Agamemnon might be righted, pumped out and somewhat repaired, she was effectively a total loss. Mutine remained on station, helping with the salvage operations, particularly of the cannons, 38 of which were rescued and landed at Gorita.\n\nMutine was anchored in the harbour of Buenos Aires on 25 May 1810 during May Week when the revolution broke out in the city. Captain Fabian broke out bunting and saluted the revolution with salvos of cannon. He also gave a rousing speech on liberty and revolution, praising the revolutionaries for having gained their freedom. By 7 August Mutine was back in Britain, reporting to Lord Wellesley on the revolution in Argentina.\n\nBattle with the French\n\nOn 22 October 1810, Commander Frederick William Burgoyne briefly took command before passing it on 31 October to Commander Nevison de Courcy. In 1812 de Courcy sailed Mutine to Quebec, and then home.\n\nWhen news of the outbreak of the War of 1812 reached Britain, the Royal Navy seized all American vessels then in British ports. Mutine was among the Royal Navy vessels then lying at Spithead or Portsmouth and so entitled to share in the grant for the American ships Belleville, Janus, Aeos, Ganges and Leonidas seized there on 31 July 1812.\n\nIn 1813, Mutine was operating in the Western Approaches. Whilst Mutine was cruising in the Bay of Biscay De Courcy spotted a strange sail on the morning of 17 April. Mutine gave chase and at about 2pm her quarry hoisted the French flag. She then opened fire on Mutine with her stern chasers. The fire damaged Mutine's rigging, slowing her and causing her to begin to fall behind. Still, Mutine managed to stay close enough to fire back for the next two hours. Eventually, shots from Mutine took away her quarry's main-top-gallant-mast and jibs, slowing her and allowing Mutine to catch up. Then, after a further 50 minutes of battering, the French vessel struck. She turned out to be the privateer Invincible, Martin Jortis, master. Her armament consisted of twelve French 18-pounder carronades and four 6-pounder guns, though she was pierced for four more cannon. Mutine took the crew of 86, some of whom were Americans, prisoner. Mutine had suffered only two men slightly wounded in the engagement.\n\nThe American privateer Alexander later recaptured Invincible, only to lose her to boats from Shannon and Tenedos on 16 May. The British then sent Invincible to Halifax.[14] Invincible did not reach Halifax. The American privateer Teazer re-re-captured her and sent her into Portland.\n\nAlexander did not survive much longer; Rattler drove her ashore off Kenebank on 19 May. Alexander's crew escaped, whilst Rattler pulled off the ship herself and salvaged it with the assistance of the schooner Bream.\n\nFrom 7 June 1814 Mutine sailed under Commander James Athill in the Leeward Islands. From 15 October her captain was Commander James Mould.\n\nLater years, and at Algiers\n\nShe took part in Lord Exmouth's punitive expedition against the Dey of Algiers, and was present at the Bombardment of Algiers in 1816. During the bombardment she was anchored off the port bow of HMS Impregnable, whilst the other sloops kept under way. She suffered no casualties. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \"Algiers\" to still living claimants who had been present on 27 August 1816.\n\nIn October Commander William Sargent took command for the Cork Station. Mutine spent most of her remaining years patrol between the south coast of England and Cork, Ireland.\n\nFate\n\nThe Navy offered Mutine for sale at Plymouth on 3 February 1819. She was sold on that day to G. Young for £1,310.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Mutine_(1806)\n\nBritish sloop 'Mutine' (1806)\n\nBritish sloop 'Mutine' (1806).

In May 1837, Texas Navy ship Independence prepared for another cruise to take United States diplomat William H. Wharton to Texas from New Orleans. Independence had smooth sailing for about seven days when on April 17 she encountered the Mexican brigs Vencedor del Álamo under Francisco López and the Libertador, off the mouth of the Brazos River.\n\nBattle\n\nThe initial sighting of the two Mexican brigs was at about 5:30 am. Outgunned and outmanned Independence fled up Brazos River for protection at the small riverside town of Velasco. The Mexican vessels pursued the Texans, eventually the two brigs came within cannons range several hours later at 9:30 am. Vincedor del Alamo of sixteen 8-pounder guns and 140 men, sailed with Libertador of 100 men, six 12-pounder guns and one 18-pounder. Independence of eight guns total, raised her colors followed by Libertador which then fired the first broadside that had no effect. Shortly afterward Independence fired a broadside with her weather battery of one 9-pounder gun, three 6-pounder guns, and one pivot gun. For two hours, Independence continued up Brazos River with the Mexican brigs in close pursuit, occasionally stopping to fire on each other. By 11:30 am the Texans had reached Velasco, Captain Wheelwright had no choice but to fight to the end, apparently not being able to continue up Brazos River any further. The final engagement took place right in front of the small Texan town and populace, including Texan Secretary of the Navy Samuel Rhoads Fisher.\n\nBrazos River\n\nThe Mexicans not being far behind came within range and Captain Wheelwright ordered his men to engage once more. The shots managed to damage the main top-gallant mast of the Libertador and after another broadside in Libertador's direction, two Mexicans lay dead and a few more were wounded. More shots damaged Libertador' foremast and knocked out one of her 12-pounders. However, these broadsides did not slow the Mexican ships, Libertador approached Independence head on while Vincedor del Alamo maneuvered around to Independence's other side. The two brigs quickly came within pistol shots range and both fired a mixture of cannon projectiles. This is when a ball smashed through Independence' quarter gallery wall and into the Texan captain, taking off three of his fingers on his right hand. Severely wounded and taken below, command of the schooner passed to Lieutenant John W. Taylor who finished the last few moments of battle before receiving orders from Wheelwright to surrender. With this action the battle was over.\n\nAftermath\n\nImmediately Independence was boarded, the officers and crew, as well as William Wharton and a half dozen other civilian passengers, were taken prisoner. The Texan fightingmen were barred away in Matamoros, all of the prisoners eventually escaped or were released by the Mexican government. That same day, Mexican President Anastasio Bustamante, in his inaugural address, pledges to reorganize his military to \"preserve the rights of the nation,\" which includes the reconquest of Texas. After the capture of the Independence, the Mexican seamen found a long lost 8-pounder gun, which had been captured by the Texans at the Battle of San Jacinto a year earlier. Independence was commissioned into the Mexican Navy's Veracruz Squadron under the name La Independencia and continued to serve in the Gulf of Mexico against the Texans.\n\nThe Texan schooner Independence was one of the four schooners of the First Texas Navy (1836–1838). At the direction of Texas Governor Henry Smith, in 1936 Charles Hawkins took command of United States revenue cutter Ingham acquired by the Texas Navy and renamed Independence.\n\nAfter the Texas victory at the Battle of San Jacinto in April, 1836, Independence carried the Texas President and his captive, General Santa Anna, to Velasco, where the Treaty of Velasco was negotiated and signed.\n\nWhile being refitted in New Orleans in early 1837, her skipper died and a new captain was appointed. When next she sailed in April 1837, Independence was attacked and surrendered to a superior Mexican force and her officers and passengers were imprisoned. The ship was later commissioned in the Mexican Navy where she served against her former masters.\n\nService during the Texas Revolution\n\nAt the direction of Texas Governor Henry Smith, in 1936 Charles Hawkins took command of United States revenue cutter Ingham. It had been acquired by the Texas Navy and renamed Independence. Independence traveled from Matagorda to New Orleans in March 1836 for refitting, but quickly returned to block supplies to the Mexican Army. With the retreat of Sam Houston's army after the Texans' defeats at the siege of the Battle of the Alamo and Battle of Goliad, Hawkins was forced to move his ship up the Texas coast from Matagorda to Galveston. With the rebel government in disarray during the Runaway Scrape, Independence's mission was to defend Galveston from invasion and block resupply of Santa Anna's nearby army.\n\nLithograph of Independence as flagship of the Texas Navy\n\nThe Treaty of Velasco and after\n\nThereafter, Independence was involved in two important diplomatic missions, first in May 1836 carrying San Jacinto President David G. Burnet, with his cabinet, and Santa Anna to sign the Treaty of Velasco after the Battle of San Jacinto and then, in June, setting sail for New Orleans with commissioners Peter William Grayson and James W. Collinsworth on board. These men continued their journey to Washington, D.C., where they negotiated with the United States for the recognition of the independence of Texas.\n\nIn the summer of 1836, Independence was the only ship of the Texas Navy on duty in the Gulf of Mexico; Liberty having been sold to pay the cost of refurbishment and Invincible and Brutus in New York City for repairs. Mexican authorities had recently repudiated the Treaty of Velasco claiming that General Santa Anna did not have the capacity to bind Mexico to recognize Texas' independence. With rumors of an imminent invasion of Texas by Mexico, Independence carried out a screening and patrol action at Matamoros, which the Texans had ordered blockaded.\n\nIn the fall of 1836, Independence returned to New Orleans for refitting and while there Commodore Hawkins died of smallpox.[4] When Independence sailed from New Orleans on 10 April 1837, with Texas minister to the United States, William H. Wharton aboard, she was skippered by her new Captain, George W. Wheelwright, who had been left without a command after the forced sale of Liberty in May 1836.\n\nBattle of Brazos River[\n\nMain article: Battle of the Brazos River\n\nOn her next cruise, Independence had smooth sailing for about seven days when on 17 April she encountered the Mexican brigs-of-war Vencedor del Álamo and Libertador off the mouth of the Brazos River.

Sutlej was ordered from Pembroke Dockyard on 26 March 1845, laid down in August 1847 and launched on 17 April 1855. She was then laid up in ordinary at Portsmouth, before being converted to a screw frigate between 1859 and 1860. She was undocked on 26 March 1860. She had a brief career as an active navy ship.\n\nGun deck on HMS Sutlej, circa. 1865-1868\n\nThe name Sutlej was chosen to commemorate the victory of East India Company forces over the Sikh Khalsa Army, in the Battle of Sobraon on the banks of the Sutlej. She was commanded from her commissioning by Captain Matthew Connolly, spending time with the Pacific Station, based at Esquimalt, in 1864 as the flagship of Rear-Admiral John Kingcome. She was commanded by Captain Trevenen Penrose Coode from 1867, and was the flagship of Rear-Admiral Joseph Denman. She then returned to Britain for paying off. Sutlej was broken up at Portsmouth in 1869.\n\nNotable incidents\n\nOn 1 October 1863, Sutlej provoked a minor incident when she entered San Francisco on a windless day, with her ensign indiscernible due to the lack of a breeze. When Sutlejfailed to halt in response to a cannon signal, the commander of the federal fort at Alcatraz ordered a shot to be placed across her bow. The incident ended when Sutlej halted and fired a 21-gun salute.\n\nIn October 1864, the Sutlej participated in a raid of nine Ahousaht villages. The Ahousaht nation suffered 15 casualties and 11 prisoners taken, including the wife and child of Chief Cap-chah.\n\nIn 1865, when Sutlej again docked at San Francisco, one-third of her crew took the opportunity to desert.\n\nsistership\n\nScale: 1:48. A contemporary full hull model of the sailing frigate HMS 'Constance’ (1846). The model is highly detailed both on deck including guns, spare spars, boats and shot garlands, as well as being fully rigged, including stun sail yards. The model, mounted on its original wooden baseboard, is said to have been made for Sir Francis Baring (afterwards Lord Northbrook), who was First Lord of the Admiralty from 1849–52. The ‘Constance’, designed by Sir William Symonds, was launched at the Royal Naval Dockyard Pembroke in 1846 and was among the last of the true sailing frigates. It was the largest of the ‘Vernon’ class measuring 180 feet in length by 52 feet in the beam and a tonnage of 2132 tons burden. With a crew of 500 men, the Constance’ was taken out to Valparaiso by Captain Sir Baldwin Walker, later Surveyor of the Navy, who praised the ship highly. Having battled through a hurricane and then rounded Cape Horn he was able to report the ‘Constance’ as ready at once to sail round the world if need be, a state of affairs confirmed by Captain G. W. Courtenay to whom it was handed over on arrival. In 1862, it was converted to screw propulsion and was one of the first ships in the Royal Navy to use compound engines, although they were not at that time sufficiently developed to be a complete success. Finally, the ‘Constance’ was paid off in 1868 and later scrapped in 1875\n\nsistership\n\nScale: 1:48.

She had a different armour scheme and heavier armament than her sister ships, and was generally regarded as a half-sister to the other ships of the class. The ship spent her career with the Channel Squadron and occasionally served as a flagship. Northumberland was placed in reserve in 1890 and became a training ship in 1898. She was converted into a coal hulk in 1909 and sold in 1927, although the ship was not scrapped until 1935.\n\nNorthumberland in her original 5-masted configuration\n\nDesign and description\n\nThe Minotaur-class armoured frigates were essentially enlarged versions of the ironclad HMS Achilles with heavier armament, armour, and more powerful engines. They retained the broadside ironclad layout of their predecessor, but their sides were fully armoured to protect the 50 guns they were designed to carry. Their plough-shaped ram was also more prominent than that of Achilles.\n\nNorthumberland was 400 feet 4 inches (122.0 m) long between perpendiculars and had a beam of 58 feet 5 inches (17.8 m) and a draught of 27 feet 9 inches (8.5 m). The ship displaced 10,584 long tons (10,754 t) and had a tonnage of 6,621 tons burthen. Her hull was subdivided by 15 watertight transverse bulkheads and had a double bottom underneath the engine and boiler rooms. The ship was considered \"a steady gun platform, able to maintain her speed in a seaway and satisfactory in manoeuvre\". She was authorized a crew of 705 officers and enlisted men, but actually carried 800 men.\n\nPropulsion\n\nModel of her engines\n\nNorthumberland had a two-cylinder trunk steam engine, made by John Penn and Sons, driving a single propeller using steam provided by 10 rectangular fire-tube boilers. It produced a total of 6,558 indicated horsepower (4,890 kW) during the ship's sea trials on 15 September 1868 and Northumberland had a maximum speed of 14.1 knots (26.1 km/h; 16.2 mph). The ships normally carried 750 long tons (760 t) of coal, but had a maximum capacity of 1,400 long tons (1,400 t), enough to steam 2,825 nautical miles (5,232 km; 3,251 mi) at 10 knots (19 km/h; 12 mph).\n\nOriginally designed with three masts, Northumberland was fitted with five masts until her 1875–79 refit when two were removed and she was re-rigged as a barque. Northumberland only made 7 knots (13 km/h; 8.1 mph) under sail, mainly because the ship's propeller could only be disconnected and not hoisted up into the stern of the ship to reduce drag, the worst speed of any ironclad of her era. Admiral George A. Ballard described the Minotaur-class ships as \"the dullest performers under canvas of the whole masted fleet of their day, and no ships ever carried so much dress to so little purpose.\"\n\nArmament\n\nNorthumberland's gun deck, showing her eight-inch guns\n\nUnlike her half-sisters, Northumberland was armed with a mix of seven-inch (178 mm), eight-inch (203 mm), and nine-inch (229 mm) rifled muzzle-loading guns. All 4 nine-inch and 18 eight-inch were mounted on the main deck while 4 eight-inch guns were fitted on the upper deck as chase guns. Both seven-inch guns were mounted in the stern on the main deck, also as chase guns.\n\nThe nine-inch gun was credited with the ability to penetrate 11.3 inches (287 mm) of wrought iron armour at the muzzle. The eight-inch gun could penetrate 9.6-inch (244 mm) of armour and the seven-inch gun could penetrate 7.7 inches (196 mm).\n\nNorthumberland was partially rearmed in 1875 with an armament of 7 nine-inch guns, 4 on the main deck, 2 forward chase guns and 1 rear chase gun. Two eight-inch guns replaced the seven-inchers on the main deck at the stern; the other 18 eight-inch guns remained where they were. In 1886 two six inches (152 mm) breech-loading guns replaced two eight-inch guns. Six quick-firing (QF) 4.7-inch (120-mm) guns, 10 QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns, and six machine guns were later added.\n\nArmour\n\nUnlike her half-sisters, the entire side of Northumberland's hull was not covered with wrought iron armour. To compensate for the additional weight of her armament, only her battery was protected above the main deck. The ship was fitted with a complete waterline armour belt that tapered from 4.5 inches (114 mm) at the ends to 5.5 inches (140 mm) amidships. The armour extended 5 feet 9 inches (1.8 m) below the waterline. The sides of the battery were 184.5 feet (56.2 m) long and it was protected by 5.5-inch armour on all sides, including transverse bulkheads fore and aft of the guns. The two forward chase guns on the upper deck were also protected by armoured bulkheads, but the stern chase guns on that same deck were entirely unprotected. The armour was backed by 10 inches (254 mm) of teak. The ship also had a conning tower protected by 4.5-inch armour plates.\n\nConstruction and service\n\nNorthumberland, named after the ceremonial county, was ordered on 2 September 1861 from the Millwall Ironworks. She was laid down on 10 October 1861 at its shipyard in Millwall, London. She was altered while on the building slip after Sir Edward Reed succeeded Isaac Watts as Chief Constructor. Unlike her half-sisters, the ship spent five years on the stocks before she was ready to be launched, partially due to frequent changes in design, although Northumberland was much closer to completion. The additional weight caused her stick for an hour on the slipway before she slid halfway down with her stern only supported by air, threatening to buckle the ship. Efforts by hydraulic jacks and tugboats failed to get her into the water on the next spring tide failed, but the use of pontoons on 17 April 1866 proved successful. Her builders went into bankruptcy while the ship was being launched and the liquidators seized Northumberland as a company asset once she was in the water. Eight months passed before the Admiralty could take possession and begin fitting out the ship. She was commissioned in October 1868 and completed on 8 October for a cost a total of £444,256.\n\nNorthumberland in three-masted configuration, 1890\n\nThe ship's first posting was to the Channel Squadron, where she remained until 1873. Her first captain, Roderick Dew, had all of her yards painted black so that she could be visually distinguished from her half-sisters, whose yards were white. During this time she helped her half-sister Agincourt tow a floating drydock from England to Madeira where it would be picked up by Warrior and Black Prince and taken to Bermuda. The ships departed the Nore on 23 June 1869, loaded down with 500 long tons (510 t) of coal stowed in bags on their gun decks, and transferred the floating dock 11 days later after an uneventful voyage. She was anchored at Funchal, Madeira, on Christmas Day 1872, when a storm parted her anchor chain and the ship drifted onto the ram bow of the ironclad Hercules. Northumberland was seriously damaged below the waterline, with one compartment flooded, though she was able to steam to Malta for repairs.\n\nWhile her half-sister Minotaur, normally flagship of the Channel Squadron, was refitting in 1873–75, Agincourt, normally the flagship of the fleet second-in-command, replaced her as flagship and Northumberland became flagship of the second-in-command until Minotaur's return to duty. She served as the flagship for Rear Admirals George Hancock and Lord John Hay. Northumberland received her own refit and rearmament from 1875–79 and rejoined the Channel Squadron upon its completion. The ship was paid off in 1885 for another refit and became the flagship of Vice Admirals Sir William Hewett and John Baird, successive commanders of the Channel Squadron, upon her completion in 1887.\n\nNorthumberland was assigned to the 1st Reserve Squadron at the Isle of Portland in 1890–91 and then at Devonport from 1891–98. She was hulked in 1898 as a stokers' training ship at the Nore and renamed Acheron on 1 January 1904. From 1909–27 the ship served as a coal hulk at Invergordon, renamed C.8 in 1909 and then C.68 in 1926. The ship was sold in 1927, but was then resold and renamed as Stedmound for service at Dakar until she was scrapped in 1935.\n\nRelics\n\nTwo large 1870s half-scale models of the ship are at the Museum of London Docklands.\n\nHMS Minotaur(1863); Warship; Broadside ironclad; Battleship (SLR0943)\n\nHMS Minotaur flagship of Rear-Admiral F B P Seymour CB Channel Squadron (PAF8151)\n\nThe Minotaur-class armoured frigates were enlarged versions of HMS Achilles with heavier armament, thicker armour, and more powerful engines. The ships of this class were unique among ironclad warships in possessing on completion five masts, named fore-, second-, main-, fourth- and mizzen.\n\nBritish ironclad HMS Minotaur as Channel Fleet flagship, after 1875.\n\nHistory\n\nThey were originally intended to mount forty Armstrong 110-pounder breech-loading guns on the main deck, with ten more on pivot mountings on the upper deck. The failure of these guns in service led to a complete re-evaluation of their armament, with a concomitant delay in the arming of the whole class. The ships were armed with a combination of 9-inch muzzle-loading rifles (MLR) on metal carriages and 7-inch MLRs on rope-worked carriages. In a moderate swell these 7-inch guns were virtually unworkable, making the Minotaurs both the heaviest and the worst armed of the Victorian battleships.\n\nThe Minotaurs were poor sailors, never exceeding a speed under sail of about 9.5 knots (17.6 km/h; 10.9 mph) with all sail set and a favourable wind. They were, in spite of the number of masts they exhibited, the most sluggish of all British ironclads under sail. They were regarded as good sea-boats, and were considered to be among the steadiest ships in the battle-fleet. They were slow in manoeuvre under hand-steering, but were regarded as good after steam steering was fitted.\n\nHMS Agincourt was a Minotaur-class armoured frigate built for the Royal Navy during the 1860s. She spent most of her career as the flagship of the Channel Squadron's second-in-command. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78, she was one of the ironclads sent to Constantinople to forestall a Russian occupation of the Ottoman capital. Agincourt participated in Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee Fleet Review in 1887. The ship was placed in reserve two years later and served as a training ship from 1893 to 1909. That year she was converted into a coal hulk and renamed as C.109. Agincourt served at Sheerness until sold for scrap in 1960.\n\nHMS Agincourt (British broadside ironclad, 1868) Photographed after the completion of her 1875-1877 refit, when alternate gunports were enlarged to accommodate larger muzzle-loading rifles.\n\nHMS Minotaur was the lead ship of the Minotaur-class armoured frigates built for the Royal Navy during the 1860s. They were the longest single-screw warships ever built. Minotaur took nearly four years between her launching and commissioning because she was used for evaluations of her armament and different sailing rigs. The ship spent the bulk of her active career as flagship of the Channel Squadron, including during Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee Fleet Review in 1887. She became a training ship in 1893 and was then hulked in 1905 when she became part of the training school at Harwich. Minotaur was renamed several times before being sold for scrap in 1922 and broken up the following year.\n\nMinotaur's deck in the late 1860s.

Alexander Hall & Co. built the ship in Scotland in 1866 as the passenger clipper Sobraon; she was the largest composite-hull sailing vessel ever built. She sailed on an annual migration run between England and Australia until 1891, when she was sold to the colonial government of New South Wales for use as a reformatory ship. The vessel was then sold to the federal government in 1911, and entered RAN service. Tingira was paid off in 1927, but despite efforts to preserve the ship, was broken up in 1941.\n\nHMAS Tingira moored in Rose Bay, Sydney in 1912\n\nDesign and construction\n\nSobraon was designed as a combination steam-sail ship, but plans to integrate a steam-powered propulsion system were cancelled while the ship was being built. Under full sail, Sobraon could use up to 2 acres (0.81 ha) of sail, and could achieve 16 knots (30 km/h; 18 mph). The ship's hold was 27 feet (8.2 m), and there was provision for livestock. The hull was of composite construction - teak planking over an iron frame. Sobraon was the largest composite-hull sailing vessel ever built.\n\nAllexander4 Hall & Sons built Sobraon at Aberdeen, Scotland. She was given the yard number 239. The ship, named after the Battle of Sobraon, was launched on 17 April 1866.\n\nOperational history\n\nSobraon\n\nThe ship was built for Shaw, Lowther, Maxton & Co., but was initially operated by the firm Devitt and Moore, who purchased the vessel in 1870. Sobraon was used on the England to Australia migration route, and made one trip per year from England. Her maiden voyage departed London on 9 November and Plymouth 21 November 1866, reaching Australia on 4 February 1867. Initially, voyages ended in Sydney, but from 1872 onwards, Sobraon began sailing to Melbourne instead. The ship's high speed, along with onboard facilities like a water condenser, 3-tonne (3.0-long-ton; 3.3-short-ton) ice chamber, and fresh milk daily from onboard livestock, made Sobraon one of the more popular migration ships. On the first three return voyages, Sobraon would take on a cargo of Indian tea and race other ships back to England to deliver the first cargo. After the third voyage, the ship was instead loaded with cargoes of Australian wheat and wool for the return leg.\n\nSobraon in her original configuration as a passenger clipper\n\nOn 14 October 1890, Sobraon sailed on her final voyage to Australia. She reached Melbourne on 4 January 1891, was sold later that month to the New South Wales Government, then towed to Sydney. In the hands of the colony's government, Sobraon was assigned to the State Welfare Department and refitted for use as a reformatory ship, where delinquent boys were trained in the skills for a maritime career. Moored off Cockatoo Island and operated under the designation \"Nautical School Ship Sobraon\", over 4,000 boys were hosted and trained across a 20-year period.\n\nHMAS Tingira\n\nThe Australian federal government purchased the ship in 1911 for use as a training ship for the fledgling Royal Australian Navy (RAN). She was refitted, commissioned into the RAN as HMAS Tingira (an aboriginal word for \"open sea\") on 25 April 1912, and moored in Rose Bay. Up to 250 boys between the ages of 14 1/2 and 16 could be trained at any time, although the trainee complement rarely exceeded 200.[5] Between 1912 and 1927, 3,158 boys were trained for naval service. As Tingira was immobilised, the steam yacht HMAS Sleuth was attached to the training ship as a tender, and used to provide seagoing experience to recruits.\n\nWatercolor of Sobraon by Charles Collinson Rawson\n\nFate\n\nTingira was paid off on 30 June 1927, and laid up in Berry's Bay. In 1929, the ship was sold to a private owner, but he did not put her to any use before passing away in 1935. Tingira was then purchased by Major Friere (a retired British Army officer) in 1936, who was working with Louisa Ankin to preserve the ship as a national relic. Two years later, the ship was sold to a ship breaker by mortgagees; Friere and Ankin attempted to repurchase the ship, but were unsuccessful. Tingira was broken up in 1941.\n\nTeenage trainees at the RAN's Junior Recruit Training Establishment (which operated at Fremantle naval base HMAS Leeuwin from 1960 to 1984) wore shoulder flashes bearing the name \"Tingira\" as a historical link with the training ship. Tingira Memorial Park, a small park on the Rose Bay waterfront, commemorates HMAS Tingira. The park was established in two phases; the first opening in 1962, the second completed in 1977.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS_Tingira\n\nhttp://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-tingira\n\nToday in Naval History - Naval / Maritime Events in History\n\n17 April 1877 – Launch of Fusō (扶桑), a central-battery ironclad built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) in the 1870s.\n\nFusō (扶桑) was a central-battery ironclad built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) in the 1870s. She was built in the United Kingdom because such ships could not yet be constructed in Japan. The ship participated in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95 where she was damaged during the Battle of the Yalu River in 1894 and participated in the Battle of Weihaiwei in early 1895. She collided with two Japanese ships during a storm and sank in 1897. She was refloated the following year and repaired. Fusō played a minor role in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 and was reclassified as a coast defense ship after the war. She was struck from the Navy List in 1908 and sold for scrap the following year.\n\nFusō as completed\n\nBackground\n\nTensions between Japan and China heightened after the former launched its punitive expedition against Taiwan in May 1874 in retaliation of the murder of a number of shipwrecked sailors by the Paiwan aborigines. China inquired into the possibility of buying ironclad warships from Great Britain and Japan was already negotiating with the Brazilian government about the purchase of the ironclad Independencia then under construction in Britain. The Japanese terminated the negotiations with the Brazilians in October after the ship was badly damaged upon launching and the expeditionary force was about to withdraw from Taiwan. The crisis illustrated the need to reinforce the IJN and a budget request was submitted that same month by Acting Navy Minister Kawamura Sumiyoshi for ¥3.9–4.2 million to purchase three warships from abroad. No Japanese shipyard was able to build ships of this size so they were ordered from Great Britain. This was rejected as too expensive and a revised request of ¥2.3 million was approved later that month. Nothing was done until March 1875 when Kawamura proposed to buy one ironclad for half of the money authorized and use the rest for shipbuilding and gun production at the Yokosuka Shipyard. No response was made by the Prime Minister's office before the proposal was revised to use all of the allocated money to buy three ships, one iron-hulled armored warship and two armored corvettes of composite construction to be designed by the prominent British naval architect Sir Edward Reed, formerly the Chief Constructor of the Royal Navy. Reed would also supervise the construction of the ships for an honorarium of five percent of the construction cost. The Prime Minister's office approved the revised proposal on 2 May and notified the Japanese consul, Ueno Kagenori, that navy officers would be visiting to negotiate the contract with Reed.\n\nCommander Matsumura Junzō arrived in London on 21 July and gave Reed the specifications for the ships. Reed responded on 3 September with an offer, excluding armament, that exceeded the amount allocated in the budget. Ueno signed the contracts for all three ships on 24 September despite this problem because Reed was scheduled to depart for a trip to Russia and the matter had to be concluded before his departure. Ueno had informed the Navy Ministry about the costs before signing, but Kawamura's response to postpone the order for the armored frigate did not arrive until 8 October. The totals for all three contracts came to £433,850 or ¥2,231,563 and did not include the armament. These were ordered from Krupp with a 50 percent down payment of £24,978. The government struggled to provide the necessary money even though the additional expenses had been approved by the Prime Minister's office on 5 June 1876, especially as more money was necessary to fully equip the ships for sea and to provision them for the delivery voyage to Japan.\n\nDescription\n\nThe design of Fusō was based on a scaled-down version of HMS Iron Duke, an Audacious-class central-battery ironclad, familiar to the Japanese as the flagship of the Royal Navy China Station from 1871–75. The ship was 220 feet (67.1 m) long between perpendiculars and had a beam of 48 feet (14.6 m). She had a forward draft of 17 feet 9 inches (5.4 m) and drew 18 feet 5 inches (5.6 m) aft. She displaced 2,248 long tons (2,284 t) and had a crew of 26 officers and 269 enlisted men.\n\nPropulsion\n\nFusō had a pair of two-cylinder, double-expansion trunk steam engines made by John Penn and Sons, each driving a two-bladed 15-foot-6-inch (4.7 m) propeller. Eight cylindrical boilers provided steam to the engine at a working pressure of 4.09 bar (409 kPa; 59 psi). The engines were designed to produce 3,500 indicated horsepower (2,600 kW) to give the ships a speed of 13 knots (24 km/h; 15 mph). During her sea trials on 3 January 1878, she reached a maximum speed of 13.16 knots (24.37 km/h; 15.14 mph) from 3,824 ihp (2,852 kW). The ship carried a maximum of 350 long tons (360 t) of coal, enough to steam 4,500 nautical miles(8,300 km; 5,200 mi) at 10 knots (19 km/h; 12 mph). The three-masted ironclad was barque-rigged and had a sail area of 17,000 square feet (1,579 m2). To reduce wind resistance while under sail alone, the funnel was semi-retractable.\n\nThe ship was modernized at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal beginning in 1891. Her masts were removed and the fore- and mizzenmasts were replaced by two military masts also fitted with fighting tops. Her funnel was fixed in height and she received four new cylindrical boilers. To offset the reduced number of boilers, the new ones were fitted with forced draught which increased their working pressure to 6.13 bar (613 kPa; 89 psi). The space made available by removal of the boilers was used to increase her coal storage by 36 long tons (37 t).\n\nArmament and armor\n\nFusō was fitted with four 20-caliber 24-centimeter (9.4 in) Krupp rifled breech-loading (RBL) guns and two 22-caliber RBL 17-centimeter (6.7 in) Krupp guns. The 24 cm guns were mounted at the corners of the armored citadel on the main deck at an angle of 65 degrees to the centerline of the ship. Each gun could traverse 35 degrees to the left and right. Only the 60-degree arc at the bow and stern could not be fired upon. The two pivot-mounted 17-centimeter guns were positioned on the sides of the upper deck, each with three gun ports that allowed them to act as chase guns, firing fore and aft, as well as on the broadside. The ship also carried four long and two short 75-millimeter (3.0 in) guns, the latter intended for use ashore or mounted on the ship's boats.\n\nThe armor-piercing shell of the 24-centimeter gun weighed 352.7 pounds (160 kg). It had a muzzle velocity of 1,560 ft/s (475 m/s) and was credited with the ability to penetrate 15.5 inches (393 mm) of wrought iron armor at the muzzle. The 132.3-pound (60 kg) 17-centimeter shell had a muzzle velocity of 1,510–1,600 ft/s (460–487 m/s) and could penetrate 10.3–11.4 inches (262–290 mm) of armor. The only data available for the 75-millimeter guns is their muzzle velocities of 1,550 ft/s (473 m/s) and 960 ft/s (292 m/s) for the long and short-barreled guns respectively.\n\nDuring the 1880s the armament of Fusō was augmented several times. In June 1883 seven quadruple-barreled 25.4-millimeter (1.0 in) Nordenfelt machine guns were added for defense against torpedo boats. Five were positioned on the upper deck and one each in the fighting tops. "
