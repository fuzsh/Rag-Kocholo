Their navies played an important, sometimes critical, role. The power of the rival navies was based chieﬂy on their ships of the line, great wooden warships carrying two or three tiers of iron or brass cannon. The age of the ship of the line is largely the story of the navies of Britain and France, the two powers best able to afford the massively expensive ﬂeets of ships of the line. Although Spain and the Netherlands maintained good sized navies throughout the period, by the early eighteenth century they had become subordinate players in the naval rivalry of Britain and France. Other navies, such as those of Russia, Denmark, Sweden, Naples, and Venice, were regional powers, largely restricted to the Baltic or Mediterranean Seas. The goal of this book is to explain the background, course, and results of the seven wars between the British and French, particularly the causes of the ﬁnal British triumph. By treating the British and French navies in tandem I hope to give a balanced account of their rivalry; I confess to loving both countries and warmly supporting their friendship. The statesmen of the eighteenth century generally saw war not primarily as a contest of societies but more as a contest of economies, in which victory\n\nviii\n\npreface\n\nwent to the strongest, not to the “best,” and in which the chief virtue was endurance. I approach these wars in much the same way, using ships of the line as the measure of strength. Thus this book pays as much attention to the number of ships of the line engaged in the various campaigns as to the admirals and statesmen who directed them. In all the Franco-British wars of the period, including the one Britain lost, the War of American Independence, the side that could put the most ships of the line to sea was successful. I have learned much by conversations with historians more knowledgeable than I am in nautical matters. I am particularly grateful to Daniel Baugh, Richard Harding, John Hattendorf, Roger Knight, Nicholas Rodger, Patrick Villiers, and Clive Wilkinson; the mistakes I have made are totally my responsibility. Some of these conversations took place during either a 2005 trip to Paris or a 2006 trip to Greenwich, England, made possible, respectively, by the Association France-Amériques and the National Maritime Museum. I am extremely grateful to the members of both organizations for their generosity, hospitality, and kindness, particularly to Patricia Cédelle and Janet Norton, who handled the respective arrangements. In the interest of saving space I will not repeat the acknowledgments to friends and colleagues that I made in my last book, The French Navy and the Seven Years’ War. I am still indebted to all of them for their help or encouragement. I must, however, again thank my sister, Caroline Hamburger, for her hospitality during the times I was in London, and my wife, Susan Kruger, for her constant helpfulness and support. I dedicate this book to my children, Veronica Lamka, Robert Dull, Max Kruger-Dull, and Anna Kruger-Dull, in the hope that someday they will live in a world without war.\n\nFrom Dull, The French Navy and the Seven Years’ War (Nebraska, 2005).\n\nmap 1.

The Ship of the Line Begins Its Reign\n\nI\n\nBetween the 1650s and the 1850s, naval warfare was ruled by the ship of the line and the line of battle after which it was named. These huge three-masted wooden ships were some 120 to 210 feet long with a beam (width) of 30 to 60 feet. They carried between 40 and 130 cannon mounted along two, three, or, in the case of the Spanish ship of the line Santísima Trinidad, four decks.1 The ship of the line was the most expensive, technologically advanced, and visually impressive weapon of its day. It also was the measure of national naval power, like the dreadnought of World War I or the aircraft carrier of World War II. The line of battle—a string of warships following each other bow to stern—was the best way to bring its power to bear, as each ship thus could give support to neighboring ships. Only in shallow or poorly charted waters, like the eastern Baltic, was the ship of the line not dominant; there the galley, a shallow-draft oar-powered warship, continued to play a major role throughout the eighteenth century. The era of the ship of the line began when its two components, the ship of the line and the line of battle, were combined. That time was long in coming. The line of battle is so logical an arrangement that the earliest groups of European ships carrying cannon\n\n2 the ship of the line begins its reign\n\nsometimes made use of it. A Portuguese ﬂeet commanded by Vasco da Gama seems to have employed a line of battle off the coast of India in 1502.2 Its use was intermittent, however, because its main advantage was mutual support in an artillery duel. Some naval battles consisted of such duels; the English, for example, foiled the Spanish Armada of 1588 by the use of cannon. Until the middle of the seventeenth century, however, naval warfare often involved either boarding (ships grappling an opponent and then dispatching a boarding party) or the use of ﬁre ships (setting ships on ﬁre in order to ram them into enemy vessels). The Dutch, who by the 1640s had become the greatest naval power in Europe, were masters of a variety of tactics. In 1639, they used both a line of battle and ﬁre ships against a huge Spanish ﬂeet off the English coast.3 The use of great ships of 50 or more cannon also was long established by 1650. Most major naval powers had one or more of these ships, such as the English Prince Royal of 55 cannon, launched in 1610, and the Sovereign of the Seas, 90 cannon, launched in 1637, or the French Couronne, 68, launched in 1638. These ships, however, were clumsy to sail and expensive to build, man, and maintain. As an admiral’s ﬂagship they could be useful in a battle, but without other ships of similar size they could not alter the disorganized melee of a naval battle based on boarding or the use of ﬁre ships. Fleets during the ﬁrst half of the seventeenth century were very heterogeneous, moreover, frequently consisting mostly of converted merchant ships. A turning point came in 1649 when the Parliament of England decided to build a group of very large and heavily armed frigates (fast, medium-sized warships usually carrying 20 or more cannon) that was the predecessor of groups (or “classes”) of ships of the line of a standard size. The thirteen ships of the Speaker class, launched\n\nthe ship of the line begins its reign\n\n3\n\nbetween 1650 and 1654, were of roughly similar size (about 750 tons) and carried 48 to 56 cannon; in tonnage and armament they were similar to a very large galleon, the chief warship of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries and still the mainstay of the Spanish navy, but they were longer, lower, and faster than galleons. No other navy had a group of ships to match them; the Dutch navy, hitherto Europe’s best, continued to rely chieﬂy on taking merchant ships into naval service.4 The line of battle ﬁrst was used, however, before most of the Speaker class were launched. Both England and the United Provinces of the Netherlands were republics, Charles I of England having been executed in 1649. Both were Protestant, too, although different enough in persuasion to create tension. It could be argued that they were natural allies against Catholic monarchies such as Spain and France; at any rate, geography did not automatically make them enemies. They were bitter trade rivals, however. Outside of Europe, trade rivalry, particularly for spices in Asia or slaves in Africa, frequently involved the use of force. As there were no effective international means of mediating disputes, the Netherlands and England were unable to resolve their trading disputes, and each feared domination by the other. As the crisis worsened, each tried to intimidate the other, leading in 1652 to a war that could have been avoided.5 Although the new English battle ﬂeet temporarily disrupted Dutch shipping and fought several battles, the ﬁrst campaign of the war was indecisive. On 29 March 1653 the three ofﬁcers jointly commanding the English navy issued instructions that guaranteed its ﬂeets henceforth would ﬁght in a battle line. Two months later the English won a smashing victory off the Gabbard shoal in the North Sea, largely due to their use of the line of battle.6 This marriage of\n\n4\n\nthe ship of the line begins its reign\n\nship and tactics endured for two centuries. The sailing ship line of battle dominated naval warfare through the Battle of Sinope in 1853, in which a line of Russian ships of the line destroyed a group of Turkish frigates. During the ensuing Crimean War of 1854–56, ships of the line, including some equipped with auxiliary steam power, were the chief naval weapon, although by now they were vulnerable to explosive shells. The death blow to the ship of the line, however, was the launching of the ﬁrst iron warships in the early 1860s.7 The line of battle persisted through the age of iron and steel battleships, though, until the last great ﬂeet action, the 1944 Battle of Leyte Gulf. II\n\nWhat accounts for so enduring a marriage between this weapon and these tactics? In part, both were the product of the same technological advances, the creation of large cannon ﬁring extremely heavy cannonballs and the development of gun ports, openings cut in the sides of ships through which cannon could ﬁre. It took a very large ship to carry banks of cannon weighing several tons apiece. Equally important the ship needed great strength to withstand the impact of cannon balls sometimes weighing as much as 42 pounds; in the late eighteenth century, the British even developed cannon ﬁring a 68-pound ball. Ships needed as many cannon as they could carry, using equal numbers on both sides, starboard and port. Moreover, ships needed large crews to work their sails and ﬁre their cannon; a French cannon ﬁring a 36-pound ball, for example, weighed more than four tons and needed fourteen men to ﬁre it.8 Although crew members slept and ate among the guns, ships needed space for water, food and drink, munitions, and various spare parts and supplies. The ship of the line was like a ﬂoating fortress, but it had points of weakness that a fortress did not. Its bow and stern could not be\n\nthe ship of the line begins its reign\n\n5\n\nas strong and straight as its sides if it were to maneuver through the water, and it had room for only a few cannon facing directly ahead or astern. This made it vulnerable to a volley of cannon balls ﬁred from directly in front or behind it. Not only could these penetrate more easily, but also once inside an enemy ship they would ﬁnd little resistance, since the ship of the line was not divided into compartments like a modern steel ship. Such an attack, called “raking,” usually inﬂicted heavy casualties and damage. A lone ship had only its speed and maneuverability to protect it from raking; on its own a ship of the line was vulnerable even to frigates, which were smaller but more nimble except in a heavy wind. The best protection for a ship of the line was having other ships of the line just ahead of and just behind it. This mutual support against raking depended on the ships sailing together in as close and straight a line as possible. This line of battle also had offensive advantages. If ﬂeets were passing in opposite directions, each ship could pound the hulls or ﬁre into the masts of several opponents in succession. The line of battle also was effective, particularly as a defensive tactic, because of other limitations of wooden sailing warships. There were two major ways of overcoming a line of battle. The ﬁrst was “doubling” one of the ends of the line, that is, placing warships on both sides of the enemy ships at either the front or back end of the line. The second was to break the line by a concentration of force somewhere in its middle. Both tactics were very difﬁcult unless the attacker had a considerable advantage in numbers or skill, because it was much easier for sailing ships to keep formation and maintain mutual support while on the defensive. Difﬁculties in communicating between ships and in maneuvering in unison made coordinating an attack so challenging that decisions in battle usually had to be left to individual ship captains.\n\n6\n\nthe ship of the line begins its reign\n\nThroughout most of the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries it was rare for a ﬂeet of superior size to suffer a decisive defeat. Sir Cloudesley Shovell, one of the leading admirals at the beginning of the eighteenth century, claimed that without a miracle, numbers would gain the victory.9 Although generally British warships were sturdier and their crews better trained that were the French, the differences in quality between them usually were not enough to produce a major victory unless there was a substantial difference in numbers. Most battles ended with few ships being lost, and generally casualties were fewer than those in land battles involving similar numbers of men. Captured French ships served alongside British ones and vice versa. Decisive battles, such as the 1759 Battle of Quiberon, usually came after the quality of French crews had drastically declined. After the onset of the French Revolution, however, the French navy underwent a rapid decline, largely due to shortages of funds, sailors, and supplies. Admiral Horatio Nelson’s defeat of a larger Franco-Spanish ﬂeet at Trafalgar was due less to his genius than to the poor quality of the ﬂeet opposing him. Such a battle was unusual. In most cases the key factor in a battle was numerical superiority. In spite of Nelson’s victories there was relatively little evolution in naval tactics between 1660 and 1815. Similarly the evolution of the ship of the line was gradual and unspectacular until the nineteenth century. The maximum size of a ship of the line increased slowly over the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; the 120-gun Nelson of 1805 was only 70 percent larger than the Sovereign of the Seas of 1637.10 Vital components such as sternposts and mainmasts were best constructed from a single tree, whose maximum size was limited by nature. The British navy tried to compensate by packing more guns on the decks of its vessels, but this did not work very well;\n\nthe ship of the line begins its reign\n\n7\n\nan 80-gun French ship was almost as large and as powerful as a 100-gun British ship. The ﬁrst “revolution” in the design of the ship of the line did not occur until near the end of its existence with the invention of the screw propeller and the use of steam. Admittedly the ship of the line did beneﬁt from continual improvements such as the development in the late eighteenth century of copper plating for hulls, which retarded the growth of marine organisms. Such improvements, even if gradual, had some effect on naval warfare. A major difference between seventeenth- and eighteenthcentury navies was their endurance. The former was generally held in port during winter weather while the latter could ﬁght year-round; the newer ships were less top-heavy and more maneuverable thanks to larger and better designed hulls and improvements in rigging and sails.11 A second difference was a large increase in the number of seamen per ship; for example, in 1690 a French 80-gun ship carried a crew of 600, a 74-gun ship a crew of 500, and a 64-gun ship a crew of 400. By 1759 an 80-gun ship required 860 men, a 74-gun ship required 695, and a 64-gun ship required 500. Slightly more than half of the crews were petty ofﬁcers and trained sailors. The remainder were ship’s boys, marines, and various landsmen. The same development occurred in the British navy.12 The requirements for a ship to serve in the line of battle also increased. In the middle of the seventeenth century, a ship with 40 cannon qualiﬁed as a ship of the line, but by the beginning of the eighteenth century at least 48 or 50 were needed. At the Battle of Beachy Head in 1690, for example, half of the French line of battle of seventy ships were ships mounting 50 to 58 cannon, although only one had fewer than 50. By the middle of the eighteenth century, 64 cannon generally were needed, and in the 1780s, the French navy began phasing out ships carrying fewer than 74. The cumulative\n\n8\n\nthe ship of the line begins its reign\n\neffect was navies of bigger ships and more crewmen, which cost much more money. Louis XIV’s navy of 1692 had ninety-ﬁve ships of the line plus half a dozen warships of 44 or 46 cannon, but only forty-nine ships carried 64 or more cannon; in 1782 the French navy had seventy-two ships of the line, of which sixty-seven carried 64 or more.13 III\n\nAlthough the English had a head start over the Dutch in the development of both the ship of the line and the line of battle, the ﬁrst war between the two states (1652–54) was not decisive. During the war, power in the Commonwealth passed from Parliament to Oliver Cromwell. Faced with other threats, he did not choose to exploit the naval supremacy gained by the English navy. He signed a compromise peace with the States General, the ruling body of the Netherlands. After Cromwell’s death in late 1658, public support for the republic collapsed, in large part because of an expensive war against Spain begun in 1655. In 1660 the Stuart monarchy was restored. Naval construction slowed temporarily, largely because Parliament did not trust the new king, Charles II, but it did not completely stop.14 Charles II was a strong supporter of the navy, and his brother James served as lord high admiral between 1660 and 1673. The navy continued to have a strong inﬂuence on British politics and diplomacy. For James and Charles, the Dutch were still the enemy, and the efforts to crush them had the potential side beneﬁt of strengthening the monarchy against Parliament. As we shall discuss in the next chapter, England fought two more wars against the Netherlands (1665–67 and 1672–74), but they were less successful than the ﬁrst had been. The Dutch learned from their shortcomings in the ﬁrst war. They built larger ships and eventually adopted the line of battle.15 They also beneﬁted from excellent\n\nthe ship of the line begins its reign\n\n9\n\npolitical leadership and superb admirals. During the last of these wars, however, the Dutch were ﬁghting for survival against another rival, one that had a far larger population than England as well as a huge army and a large navy. The English, too, soon realized that the Dutch were no longer their chief rival. A new competitor for both their navies had arisen: the navy of France.\n\n2. Louis XIV and His Wars\n\nI\n\nDuring the 145 years before the French Revolution, France was ruled by only three kings, Louis XIV, Louis XV, and Louis XVI. They were different in personality and abilities, but early in their reigns each made the same mistake, attacking a neighboring state without just cause. Each enjoyed some initial success but then was trapped in a cycle of violence and ﬁnancial expense that he came to regret. One of the problems of Louis XIV’s successors was living up to the image of the French monarch he established. Their reigns can be understood only in relationship to his.1 Louis XIV began his direct rule of France at age twenty-two in 1661. He was trained by his mother’s chief advisor and perhaps secret husband, Cardinal Jules Mazarin (or Giulio Mazzarini in his native Italian). Although the French public distrusted and disliked him, Mazarin was one of the greatest of French statesmen. He exercised wide powers granted him by Louis’s mother, serving as regent for her son after the death of her husband, Louis XIII, in 1643. Mazarin brought to a successful conclusion a lengthy war against France’s hereditary enemies, the Habsburgs. The Austrian branch of the Habsburg family had wished to turn the Holy Roman Empire, containing not only Germany but also much of central Europe, into a unitary\n\nlouis xiv and his wars\n\n11\n\nstate instead of a loose confederation of hundreds of largely independent principalities. Many of the rulers of those principalities resisted, particularly German Protestants fearful of the Habsburgs’ aggressive Catholicism. The resistance of one such principality, the Kingdom of Bohemia, precipitated the Thirty Years’ War of 1618–48. During the war the opposition against the Habsburgs was supported by outside rulers such as the kings of Denmark and Sweden; the Austrian Habsburgs in turn received aid from their Spanish cousins, also members of the House of Habsburg.2 France joined the war against the Habsburgs in 1635. Although Louis XIII was a Catholic, he put interests of state ahead of religion by helping the Protestants against their Catholic overlord. The war was difﬁcult. Spain still had a powerful army and navy. In 1636 a Spanish army operating from the Spanish Netherlands, the area which today is Belgium, advanced as far as Corbie, near Amiens, only seventy miles from Paris. It soon retreated, however, and gradually the increasingly competent French army asserted itself.3 The war in Germany ended favorably for France in 1648. The Peace of Westphalia not only preserved the independence of the myriad principalities that made up the Holy Roman Empire but also gave France and its ally Sweden the right henceforth to intervene on behalf of the small princes. The French war against Spain lasted for another eleven years. Often a better alternative to a peace treaty that crushes an enemy is one that permits befriending it. The 1659 peace settlement with Spain negotiated by Mazarin was a relatively moderate one that encouraged reconciliation; one of its key elements was the arrangement of a marriage between the young king of France and his cousin Maria Teresa, the eldest daughter of Philip IV of Spain. The treaties with Spain and the Holy Roman Empire gave France\n\n12 louis xiv and his wars\n\nconsiderable security. The economy of Spain had virtually collapsed, Portugal had established her independence from Spain, and the Spanish army and navy were shells of their former selves, although the extent of the Spanish decline was not immediately obvious. The Holy Roman Empire was divided and powerless, and even the core Habsburg possessions in central Europe were economically, administratively, and militarily underdeveloped. France had little reason to fear invasion, even from the Spanish Netherlands. After the restoration of the Stuart dynasty in 1660, England was not a threat; Charles II was a cousin of Louis XIV and soon gave proof of his goodwill by selling France the important port of Dunkirk, recently captured from Spain. The Dutch, although commercially powerful, had a relatively small army and posed little military threat. In effect France was virtually surrounded by a network of weak buffer states that would protect it in the event of a revival of the Habsburgs. Louis now had the option of concentrating his attention on increasing the power of the crown and the prosperity of his people, thereby reverting to the policy followed before France’s entrance into the Thirty Years’ War.4 Louis, however, tried to increase royal power and French wealth, while simultaneously pursuing an aggressive foreign policy. Doubtless he did not see these goals as contradictory. Stimulating French prosperity meant that he could increase taxes, enabling him to better administer his realm and expand his army and navy. His armed forces could be used not only to extend France’s borders but also to provide employment for the nobility, the monarchy’s chief political rivals. (Among France’s 20 million people, some 100,000 families were considered to possess noble blood and enjoyed many social, political, and ﬁnancial privileges.)5 Successful wars would increase the king’s prestige and would frighten potential rivals, both domestic and foreign.\n\nlouis xiv and his wars\n\n13\n\nLouis chose to extend France’s borders by force, thereby forestalling another option, that of reducing (or at least not expanding) the size of the army and following the example of England and the Netherlands, who gave priority to colonies, trade, and naval strength. Following such a policy would have required considerable political skill, as there was little potential support for it among the great nobles, some of whom had challenged Mazarin during the 1648–52 insurrections known as the Fronde. Initially Louis tried to make France both Europe’s leading military power and Europe’s leading naval power. Once he began ruling France directly in 1661, one of his ﬁrst projects was strengthening the navy. That year the energetic Jean-Baptiste Colbert became intendant of ﬁnances and took control of the French navy, even though he did not ofﬁcially become secretary of state for naval and colonial affairs until 1669. Colbert quickly took steps to expand French commerce and to build up the navy in order to provide protection for French shipping. The navy built by Louis XIII and his chief minister, Cardinal Richelieu, had suffered badly during the lengthy war with Spain, particularly after its Dutch allies left the war in 1648.6 When Louis XIV assumed direct rule of France, the French navy possessed only ﬁve warships carrying 50 or more cannon. Over the next dozen years, it placed in service eleven ships carrying 72–120 cannon and ﬁfty-two carrying 48–70 cannon. By 1670 the French navy had more tons of ships than the navies of either England or the Netherlands.7 France did not do as well as England, however, at establishing a network of colonies to provide consumer products like tobacco to the mother country and to foster trade, thereby training sailors for its navy. Colbert’s colonial policies, based on patronage and slanted toward short-term ﬁnancial gain, were contradictory and shortsighted. French colonies were underpopulated and isolated\n\n14 louis xiv and his wars\n\nfrom each other. Not until the 1720s would the French colonial empire be put on a sound footing, chieﬂy by the growth of West Indies sugar production, based, like that of the British West Indies, on the merciless exploitation of slave labor.8 Colbert began building an infrastructure in France, however, to support the navy. Central to that infrastructure were the great shipyards of Brest and Rochefort along the Atlantic coast and Toulon in the Mediterranean. Here the navy constructed, repaired, and based its warships and assembled naval supplies from anchors to masts. The most problematic of the dockyards was Rochefort, constructed on a marshy and unhealthy site on the Charente River, some ten miles from the sea. Its roadstead, where ﬂeets assembled after leaving harbor, was superb, but the passage from river to roadstead was so shallow that larger ships had to remove their cannon to enter it. The port of Brest, near the western end of the English Channel, had a superb harbor, although the passage to it from the ocean was dangerous and the necessity of an easterly wind to leave port restricted its usefulness. France had no deep natural harbor east of Brest, whereas England had four dockyards—Chatham, Sheerness, Woolwich, and Deptford—on the Thames or near its mouth. These dockyards were close to the Straits of Dover at the Channel’s eastern end. Another dockyard at Portsmouth on the south coast of England lay directly on the Channel. Unlike the English, the French had a permanent ﬂeet in the Mediterranean. It was based at Toulon, where another large dockyard was built. The division of the French navy between Toulon and the Atlantic ports presented both advantages and disadvantages. Toulon could draw on the resources of the Mediterranean, such as wood from the shores of the Adriatic, and could use the sailors of southern France, such as those from the nearby port of Marseilles.\n\nlouis xiv and his wars\n\n15\n\nToulon was difﬁcult to blockade, so the French Mediterranean ﬂeet could be used for surprise attacks, particularly at the beginning of a war, as happened in 1756 and 1778. On the other hand, the Mediterranean ﬂeet was exposed to capture should it try to join the Atlantic ﬂeet at Brest, or the Atlantic ﬂeet could be defeated before the Mediterranean ﬂeet arrived. The great French and English dockyards, with their building slips, dry docks, storehouses, and manufacturing facilities, became the largest industrial establishments in Europe. By 1814 the British royal dockyards, which had employed 2,000 to 3,000 workers in 1688, employed more than 15,000 workers, including more than 4,200 at Portsmouth and more than 3,800 at Plymouth.9 The English and French navies demanded not only dockyards but also cannon, food, naval supplies of all sorts, and sailors. These cost huge sums of money and required highly organized bureaucracies. The French, largely starting from scratch, created a centralized system, with a single naval minister and a series of bureaus devoted to such tasks as overseeing shipbuilding or personnel. It was an organization not unlike the U.S. Navy during World War II. Within the dockyards, however, power was divided between civilian administrators and naval ofﬁcers as a means for the naval ministry to exercise control; this led to conﬂicts that were even worse than those between English dockyard ofﬁcials and naval ofﬁcers. The more haphazard English system depended on cooperation between various boards, the most important of which was the Board of Admiralty. After its establishment in 1689, the admiralty made regulations, appointed ofﬁcers, supervised the other boards, and shared with the cabinet, particularly the secretaries of state, the control of naval operations. (Until 1782 there were two secretaries of state who advised the king on foreign policy: the\n\n16\n\nlouis xiv and his wars\n\nnorthern secretary, theoretically responsible for eastern Europe, and the southern secretary, theoretically responsible for western Europe.) The Navy Board was responsible for shipbuilding and repair, ﬁnance, and personnel, including noncommissioned (warrant) ofﬁcers. The Victualing Board collected and distributed biscuit, salt meat, cheese, dried peas and beans, oatmeal, sugar, butter, and other foodstuffs. Another board was responsible for the care of the sick and wounded sailors. The system of multiple boards provided continuity and experience and proved quite ﬂexible, although its cumbersome structure could create problems when ﬂeets had to be outﬁtted quickly. In particular, the Ordnance Board, which provided cannon to both the army and navy, often posed a problem. The French and English systems both involved a mixture of public and private enterprise. Both navies, for example, sometimes purchased warships from private dockyards, although the practice was much more common in England. Another similarity was that each naval establishment had only a limited impact on strategy. The heads of the French and English navies were only one voice on the councils that advised their respective kings on major foreign policy decisions. The French naval minister was usually but not always a member of the king’s Council of State (Conseil d’Etat), which generally consisted of half a dozen or so senior advisors. The English ﬁrst lord of the admiralty served on an informal “inner cabinet” of about the same size. The major difference between the two navies was in the level of ﬁnancial support each received. The English navy was considered vital to national security and was always well funded, while the French navy, usually considered less crucial to French security than was the French army, generally lived a hand-to-mouth existence, a major source of the difﬁculties it faced throughout most of the age of sail.10\n\nlouis xiv and his wars\n\n17\n\nThis ﬁnancial uncertainty also was one of the differences between life aboard a French ship of the line and life aboard an English (or later, British) ship of the line. The French developed a system of “classes” by which sailors in a given area served aboard naval warships in rotation, giving them a chance to earn a living aboard better paid and safer merchant ships when not serving in the navy. In practice, however, the system often broke down. The French navy usually was desperate for crewmen and like the English navy was willing to take them by compulsion if necessary. Because it often had great difﬁculty in paying its crewmen, service was unpopular. The English ﬁlled part of their crews by using the dreaded “press gangs” to force merchant seamen into naval service. The English, however, at least were able to pay their crewmen, although wages were usually tardy and did not rise to meet inﬂation. Both navies were willing to use foreigners; the French Mediterranean ﬂeet, for example, frequently hired Italians. Life aboard ship was harsh by today’s standards, but less so by the standards of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Food and drink were plentiful aboard ship, and work was less difﬁcult than aboard merchant ships. As warships needed large crews to man the gun decks in case of battle, there were plenty of men for daily tasks. On the other hand, large crews made for severe crowding and lack of privacy. In both navies, discipline was harsh, but relations were mitigated by professional camaraderie and shared pride in the ship’s sailing and ﬁghting ability. Many crewmen aboard a given ship in either navy were from the same area, which was a source of unity. In the French navy, regional differences were particularly important. Ships in the Mediterranean ﬂeet were manned by crewmen from Provence and southern France, while in the Atlantic ﬂeet crewmen generally came from Brittany and other\n\n18\n\nlouis xiv and his wars\n\nregions along the Atlantic coast. This made for tension when ships from the Mediterranean had to serve alongside ships from the Atlantic. The gulf between ofﬁcers and men was somewhat wider in the French navy because ofﬁcers did not help to raise their own crews and usually spoke only French, while crews spoke Breton or Provencal. Moreover, promotions to the highest ranks in the French navy were reserved for members of the nobility, at least after 1715, whereas many British admirals came from a middle-class or even working-class background. Also, all British ofﬁcers of lieutenant’s rank and higher had received practical training in seamanship and had passed an examination to prove their competence. Life in both navies was less dangerous than army life because battles were less frequent. On the other hand, the crowded conditions aboard ship fostered the spread of disease. In spite of repeated attempts by French naval ministers to improve the health of crewmen, French ships were more prone than were English ships to epidemics such as typhus, probably because standards of cleanliness on most of its ships were much inferior to British. The French navy was more interested than was the British in the application of science in areas such as ship design; for example, the concept of the metacenter (the basic measurement of stability) was the work of a French scientist, Pierre Bouguer. French theoreticians also were the ﬁrst to devise a signaling system using ﬂags to represent numbers. The French navy, however, made little use of these breakthroughs and generally was more conservative in regard to technology, at least until the French Revolution. At the end of the eighteenth century, for instance, the British greatly reduced scurvy aboard ships by the frequent, although not universal, use of lemon or lime juice, while the French navy persisted in using vinegar, which the British tried but rejected. On the other hand, the French navy experimented\n\nlouis xiv and his wars\n\n19\n\nwith canned food in 1803, a decade before the British, although its general use awaited the mass production of tin cans. On balance, life aboard a ship of the line was determined by the nature of the ship itself. An English sailor would have found the routine aboard a French ship reasonably familiar except for not often having his beloved beer to drink. French crews usually drank wine, which English crews drank in the tropics or when beer wasn’t available (although wine eventually became common aboard British ships). He would not have eaten quite as well on a French ship, but he probably would have had less difﬁculty obtaining shore leave.11 II\n\nUntil 1672 the new French navy did little ﬁghting. Louis XIV’s father-in-law, Philip IV of Spain, died in September 1665, leaving his only surviving son to inherit the throne as Charles II. The new king was only three years old and very unhealthy. Surprisingly, he lived another thirty-ﬁve years, but he had no children from either of his marriages. Although his eldest sister had renounced any claims to inherit the throne of Spain when she married Louis XIV, the renunciation was contingent upon the payment, never made, of a large dowry. Louis did not wait, however, for the demise of his young brother-in-law to claim an inheritance for Queen Marie-Thérèse (Maria Teresa). The traditional property laws used in the Spanish Netherlands were applied to support a highly dubious claim that she, rather than her younger half-brother, had a right to inherit this portion of the Spanish Empire. First, however, Louis chose in 1666 to comply with a Dutch request for assistance in their second war with England. He sent a ﬂeet to help the Dutch but made sure it kept clear of the ﬁghting. The following year, with the Dutch and the English still at war, he sent a large army to occupy the Spanish\n\n20\n\nlouis xiv and his wars\n\nNetherlands. He was foiled, however, when his nominal ally, the Dutch, made peace with England and then became its ally; the Swedes joined the alliance as well. Facing the danger that the new allies would come to the assistance of Spain, Louis XIV was forced to make peace in May 1668. The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle gave him relatively minor gains in the Spanish Netherlands, although they did include the important city of Lille. Louis’s ﬁrst war, known commonly as the War of Devolution, had no major battles and lasted little more than a year, but it had great consequences. Loving the panoply of war and possessing a large, newly rebuilt army, Louis was unwilling to settle for the relative security France enjoyed as a result of the work of Mazarin. He used violence in an attempt to protect France from the hypothetical danger that the Spanish Netherlands might again pose. He treated Spain as if it were France’s natural enemy, partly no doubt because the Spaniards insisted that Louis’s wife had renounced her claims to the Spanish throne, but even more because he did not have the imagination to escape from conventional wisdom. As a result he became caught in a cycle of wars, each wider, more dangerous, and more expensive than its predecessor. Had Louis been wiser, the cycle could have been broken. In early 1668 Emperor Leopold I, the head of the Austrian branch of the Habsburgs, agreed to a treaty by which the empire of Spain would be partitioned upon the death of Charles II. Either Louis, as the husband of Maria Teresa, or their children would receive the Spanish Netherlands, the provinces of Franche-Comté and Navarre, plus Naples, Sicily, and the Philippine Islands. Leopold, as the husband of Maria Teresa’s sister, Margareta Teresa, would receive the Spanish crown and the rest of Spain’s possessions. Once again all that was needed was patience for France to gain secure borders without the danger and expense of war.12\n\nlouis xiv and his wars\n\n21\n\nLouis, however, was unwilling to obtain by peace what he could gain by war. He eventually decided to attack the Dutch, who had opposed his gaining the Spanish Netherlands by arms and might oppose his gaining them by partition.13 In 1670 he broke apart the Dutch-English alliance by reaching an agreement with Charles II of England. By the Treaty of Dover Louis promised a subsidy to Charles, thereby helping him to escape his ﬁnancial dependence on Parliament. In return he obtained the promise of English help in his planned war on the Netherlands. Charles hoped to win a quick victory over the Netherlands without needing any parliamentary assistance. The English public had little enthusiasm for another war against the Dutch. England had seen few beneﬁts from the two previous wars. The second of these trade wars (1665–67) had ended with a great humiliation. To save money Charles II had decided not to arm the main English ﬂeet. The English thus had no defense when the Dutch appeared in the Medway, part of the Thames estuary, in June 1667. The Dutch burned part of the English ﬂeet and carried back to the Netherlands the great 80-gun ship of the line Royal Charles, the second largest ship in the English navy.14 The new war began in 1672 when a huge French army invaded the United Provinces of the Netherlands via the German states along the Rhine. The French bypassed the Spanish Netherlands, although Louis hoped the Spaniards soon would become involved in the war so he could seize more land from them. The French and English navies combined forces against the Dutch navy. The French sent a ﬂeet of thirty warships (thirteen full-sized ships of the line of 54–78 cannon, thirteen small ships of the line of 46–50 cannon, and four large frigates of 38 cannon) to join ﬁfty British ships of the line in order to support an invasion by sea. Surprisingly,\n\n22 louis xiv and his wars\n\nthe attacks on the Netherlands failed. The Dutch had the greatest admiral of the century, Michiel Adriaanszoon de Ruyter. Although badly outnumbered by the combined Anglo-French ﬂeet, he fought them on equal terms in several battles in 1672 and 1673. In the process he poisoned relations between England and France, as the English public blamed the French navy for failing to share equally in the great battles of the war, Solebay (28 May 1672) and the Texel (11 August 1673). In the latter battle sixty Dutch ships of 40 or more guns held their own against eighty-six British and French ships of a similar size. Meanwhile a squadron of Dutch frigates captured New York, which had been obtained by the English in the previous war. Parliament, as suspicious of its own king as it was of the king of France, forced Charles to make a separate peace with the Dutch in early 1674.15 The Dutch successfully resisted their enemies on land, too. By opening their dikes the Dutch turned the province of Holland into an island that the hitherto successful French army could not penetrate. Moreover, they found a dynamic and popular leader in William, the young Prince of Orange, who was appointed captain general and admiral general of all Dutch forces, as well as stadholder (chief magistrate) of most of the provinces of the Netherlands. In 1673 both branches of the Habsburgs entered the war on the side of the Dutch. The partition treaty was put aside, although attempts were made later to arrange another. Under pressure from the emperor’s army along the Rhine, the French army was forced to retreat from the Netherlands. Eventually, however, the war turned in France’s favor. The French beat back an attack by seventeen ships of the line under de Ruyter and 7,500 troops on Martinique, their most important Caribbean colony. A French army captured the province of Franche-Comté from Spain, and in the\n\nlouis xiv and his wars\n\n23\n\nSpanish Netherlands, where most of the ﬁghting occurred, the French army outclassed the armies of the Netherlands and Spain. The French navy supported an expeditionary force that was sent to Sicily to support an uprising against Charles II of Spain. Although the French eventually had to abandon the island, their squadrons held their own in several battles against the Spaniards and Dutch, in one of which the great de Ruyter was mortally wounded. The war ﬁnally ended in late 1678, barely forestalling the entrance of England into the war on the side of the Netherlands and Spain. The Treaty of Nymwegen (Nijmegen) gave France the province of Franche-Comté as well as some territory along the border with the Spanish Netherlands. These gains were small recompense for the huge cost of the war and the widespread hatred and distrust that Louis inspired in the rest of Europe. The war ruined any French hopes of renewing the English alliance; France’s only remaining ally was Sweden, by now only a minor power.16 Louis XIV, however, continued his aggressive behavior, adding territory along his border, such as Strasbourg, and bullying his neighbors. During a brief war with Spain in 1683–84, for example, a French squadron bombarded and partially destroyed the city of Genoa for helping the Spaniards. In response to this aggressiveness, Emperor Leopold I, the Austrian ruler, founded a league of German princes, the League of Augsburg. More ominous from a French standpoint, he not only repulsed a Turkish attack on Vienna but also captured Hungary and then advanced on Belgrade. In response Louis decided to strike at the League of Augsburg before Leopold could force the Turks to make peace, a demonstration of how secular was Louis’s diplomacy; he was willing to help not only non-Catholics but even non-Christians. In September 1688 he ordered the French army to attack the fortress of Philippsburg near the\n\n24\n\nlouis xiv and his wars\n\nRhine and to occupy the Palatinate, a strategically important nearby area. He believed this would frighten the League of Augsburg into accepting both a treaty incorporating his recent acquisitions and the selection of a pro-French candidate as archbishop of Cologne; this in turn would encourage the Turks to continue ﬁghting the emperor and thereby prevent Leopold from shifting his troops to western Europe. Louis discounted the threat posed by his bitterest enemy, Prince William of Orange. William was the son-in-law of James II of England, who had succeeded his brother Charles upon the latter’s death in 1685. James retained his post as lord high admiral, which he had exercised intermittently since his brother’s accession in 1660; day-to-day operations were left to the brilliant administrator Samuel Pepys, secretary of the admiralty from 1673 to 1679 and from 1684 to 1689, a parliamentary commission serving in the interim.17 As a convert to Catholicism, James was anxious to establish religious equality for his fellow Catholics and to place them in key posts in the English government and army. He thus far had had limited success. Until 1688 he posed only a minor threat to Protestantism in England, particularly since his immediate heirs, his daughters Mary (married to William of Orange) and Anne (married to the amiable but lackluster Prince George of Denmark) both were Protestant. In 1688, however, James’s second wife gave birth to a male heir, James prepared for the autumn election of a new Parliament, and the army began accepting Catholics, particularly from Ireland. William of Orange now saw the chance of gaining the support of the English army and navy against the French. He solicited a secret invitation from seven prominent Englishmen to intervene on behalf of his wife, and he began preparing a Dutch ﬂeet and army to invade England. Louis’s spies learned of the preparations,\n\nlouis xiv and his wars\n\n25\n\nbut James refused naval French assistance; therefore, the French ﬂeet at Brest was not mobilized. Louis was not concerned, as he expected that a Dutch invasion would lead to civil war in England, thus immobilizing both countries while he dealt with the League of Augsburg. William had a narrow window of opportunity before the coming parliamentary election in England. His ﬁrst attempt to sail was foiled by bad weather, but, ignoring the dangers of autumn weather in the North Sea, he made a second try. On 11 November 1688 he sailed again. The transports carrying his 20,000 troops were escorted by thirty-two Dutch ships of 40 or more guns and twenty-one smaller ones. The Dutch ﬂeet was commanded by Arthur Herbert, an English admiral who had been smuggled into Amsterdam. James, ﬁnally realizing his danger, outﬁtted thirty-eight ships carrying 40 or more guns to intercept the invasion ﬂotilla. The English commander, George Legge, Earl of Dartmouth, was unsure of the loyalty of his captains and crews and acted indecisively. With the aid of some fortunate shifts of the wind, Herbert eluded him and brought William’s troops safely to Torbay on the south coast of England. James had an army of some 30,000 men, but failed to make use of it. When his ofﬁcers began deserting to the advancing Dutch, James, no longer the conﬁdent leader he had been during the Second and Third Dutch Wars, lost his nerve. He sent his wife and baby ahead to France and then was permitted by William to ﬂee.18 In early 1689 a newly summoned Parliament ruled that the throne was vacant and offered it to William and Mary jointly. They accepted, and William became King William III. Queen Mary acted essentially as a regent when William was conducting military campaigns outside of England, but she deferred to her husband’s wishes. With the deposing of James and the resignation\n\n26 louis xiv and his wars\n\nof Pepys, the navy needed to be placed in reliable hands. Rather than appoint a new lord high admiral, William established a Board of Admiralty with two admirals and ﬁve members of Parliament, including Herbert as its head. In 1689 England and Scotland joined the growing AustrianDutch alliance against France. They were followed by Spain and the key Italian principality of Savoy along France’s eastern border. The French navy now was outnumbered. It had seventy-four ships of the line of 48–110 cannon compared with eighty-eight English and ﬁfty-three Dutch ships of similar size.19 Moreover, the French navy was unprepared for war. Its dockyards were short of naval supplies, and many of its ships needed overhauls or major repairs. Perhaps even worse, Louis XIV had deprived French Protestants of their rights in 1685, causing widespread emigration and costing France at least 5,000 trained sailors. By an estimate made the following decade, only 36,000 or 37,000 sailors remained. This was so inadequate to the navy’s needs that, when war came, it quickly abandoned its system of “classes” and resorted to conscription.20 Louis, however, made a major effort to help his cousin James. Between 1689 and 1691 the key battleground was Ireland, where James arrived to lead a rebellion against William and Mary, hoping eventually to recover his English throne. Although a ﬂeet of twenty-four French ships of the line successfully landed troops at Bantry Bay in 1689 and defeated an English ﬂeet of eighteen ships of the line and a 36-gun frigate, the French did not follow up their victory. Although William’s grasp of naval strategy was little better than Louis’s, the English soon gained control of the Irish Sea and poured troops into Ireland. The French ﬂeet at Brest, commanded by Lieutenant General of the Fleet Anne-Hilarion de Cotentin, comte de Tourville, did little to contest British control of Irish waters,\n\nlouis xiv and his wars\n\n27\n\nalthough 6,500 French troops were convoyed to Cork in the spring of 1790 by a French squadron. Tourville’s main ﬂeet did win a clear victory over Herbert, now the Earl of Torrington, at the Battle of Beachy Head on 10 July 1690. Torrington’s thirty-four British and twenty-two Dutch ships of the line were outnumbered by Tourville’s great ﬂeet of seventy ships of the line (not counting ﬁve ships of 50 guns or fewer that did not ﬁght in the line). Tourville drove the English and Dutch ﬂeet from the English Channel, but his pursuit was cautious, and he had no troops to make a landing. Instead of collecting troop transports, French naval minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert, marquis de Seignelay and son of the great Colbert, had built ﬁfteen galleys in Rochefort to attack shipping in English ports. Ironically, Tourville’s victory occurred the day before William III’s greatest triumph, the Battle of the Boyne, a squadron of French frigates arriving in Ireland too late to help James. That autumn the English captured the ports of Cork and Kinsale, leaving only Limerick in the hands of the Jacobites (those loyal to James). In 1691 Tourville’s outnumbered French ﬂeet avoided combat but provided a screen to protect the French coast and supply convoys to Limerick. Nevertheless the Irish port surrendered in October. The following year the French did collect troops to invade England. Tourville was forced by Louis to sail before the arrival of thirty-ﬁve ships of the line from Toulon in hopes that a landing could be made before the Dutch ﬂeet joined the British. The allied ﬂeet, commanded by Admiral of the Fleet Edward Russell, was assembled with exceptional speed; ﬁfty-six British and twenty-six Dutch ships of the line intercepted Tourville’s forty-four ships of the line off Cape Barﬂeur near the Norman port of St. Vaast-la-Hougue, where the troops had assembled. Tourville had been personally ordered by Louis XIV to ﬁght, much as Torrington had been ordered in 1690\n\n28 louis xiv and his wars\n\nby Queen Mary; he did so in spite of the odds against him. He lost no ships at the subsequent Battle of Barﬂeur, but in its aftermath the British trapped and destroyed at Cherbourg and St. Vaast-laHougue ﬁfteen French ships of the line, using boarding parties and ﬁre ships, while a sixteenth was shipwrecked. The French saved most of the crews of the stranded ships, so the defeat was not catastrophic, as the French had more ships than they could man effectively. Tourville won a great victory in 1693 by taking his entire ﬂeet into Spanish waters, where he captured ninety merchant ships from a huge British and Dutch convoy for the Mediterranean and two Dutch ships of the line from its escort. France now had ninety-nine ships carrying 48 or more guns, the English navy had eighty-nine, and the Dutch had fewer than seventy-two.21 A disastrous harvest in 1693, however, helped cause a diversion of French strategy toward capturing enemy merchant ships, particularly those carrying food. Some 340,000 soldiers were serving in the French army, about 75,000 more than during the height of the Dutch War. They required large expenditures, while French economic troubles caused a 25 percent drop in royal revenues. With armies to support in Spain, Italy, Germany, and the Spanish Netherlands, Louis could no longer afford his huge ﬂeet, even though the French navy was approaching the combined strength of the British and Dutch navies. In 1694 a squadron from Brest joined the Toulon ﬂeet to support operations against Barcelona, but a large British-Dutch ﬂeet arrived in the Mediterranean in time to foil them; this was the last major French ﬂeet operation of the war. The French naval budget for 1691, 1692, and 1693 had averaged about 33 million livres per year. In 1694 Louis cut it to about 24 million livres and began loaning many of his warships to investors to act as privateers, attacking\n\nlouis xiv and his wars\n\n29\n\nthe trade of England and its allies. In 1697 a joint venture between the king and private investors even led to a squadron of seven of the line capturing Cartagena de Indias, the main Spanish port on the southern shore of the Caribbean, and bringing back more than 7.5 million livres worth of booty. In contrast Parliament voted an average of £2.45 million, equivalent to about 32 million livres, from 1694 through 1697.22 Even so, the British ﬂeet was reduced in size in 1696 and 1697, partly for ﬁnancial reasons and partly because, with the main French ﬂeet demobilized, there was little use for it except for convoying. The French war on trade (guerre de course) became a model for subsequent navies too weak to risk ﬂeet encounters, but it was adopted not for strategic reasons but to save money. Even with Louis concentrating his ﬁnancial resources on the army after 1693, a military solution to the war proved impossible. To break the stalemate, the French turned to diplomacy. By making substantial concessions, they persuaded Savoy to abandon the war in 1696, soon leading to the end of ﬁghting in Italy. The following year the French ﬁnally captured Barcelona and then negotiated the Treaty of Ryswick. Except for minor gains in North America and the sparsely populated western portion of the Spanish Caribbean island of Santo Domingo, they had to abandon the conquests made during the present war, although they did keep most of those made prior to 1688. Unexpectedly, the new Caribbean colony, which was named St. Domingue, would become the richest possession in the West Indies in the eighteenth century. III\n\nThe war was a sobering experience for Louis, who was anxious to avoid another conﬂict. The greatest danger point was Spain, where\n\n30 louis xiv and his wars\n\nCharles II remained in extreme ill health and without children. Louis tried to make a new partition treaty with Emperor Leopold, but was unsuccessful, although he did reach agreement with England and the Netherlands. In 1700 Charles II ﬁnally died. To the amazement of Europe, his will left all his domains to a younger grandson of Louis rather than a son of Leopold. Given the Spanish desire to preserve their empire intact, the choice was logical; the Austrian Habsburgs had no navy with which to protect the overseas part of the Spanish Empire. Louis had little choice but to accept the Spanish crown for his grandson, who became Philip V. War between Louis and Leopold probably was inevitable, no matter who received the Spanish inheritance. Leopold was not prepared to compromise. Had his family received the crown, it is unlikely Louis would have stood by, as the union of Spain and Austria would have posed great risks to France, particularly given the recent growth of Austrian power. The accession of Philip V was an even worse threat to the European balance of power. It made it probable that England and Holland eventually would become involved in any hostilities, because of the danger to them of a union between France and Spain. Louis increased the likelihood of war by demonstrating that the division between his France and his grandson’s Spain was artiﬁcial. He sent French troops to take over the forts of the Spanish Netherlands and had Philip award to French ﬁrms the contract for supplying slaves to Spanish America. Thus it took only a year from the outbreak of an Austrian-Spanish war in Italy in 1701 (with the French as auxiliaries) for the war to become general. With a weakened army, France now faced war against most of the powers of Europe, a war with fronts in Germany, the Spanish Netherlands, Italy, and eventually Spain. When war began with England in 1702, the navy\n\nlouis xiv and his wars\n\n31\n\nhad only about ninety-ﬁve ships of the line, about a dozen fewer than in 1694.23 During previous wars the French army had faced serious problems but had not suffered major defeats. Now facing great soldiers like the Duke of Marlborough and Eugene, Prince of Savoy, it endured a string of defeats with terrible casualty lists: 40,000 at Blenheim in 1704, 15,000 at Ramillies in 1706, 13,000 at Oudenarde in 1708, and 17,000 at Malplaquet in 1709. The naval war was hopeless.24 The previous war had greatly strengthened the English navy, which was better administered during the present war than during the last war and could use the expanded base of Portsmouth and the newly established base of Plymouth on the south coast of England to support operations. Most of the ﬁghting, however, occurred in the Mediterranean. On 24 July 1704 the English and Dutch captured lightly defended Gibraltar. The French navy then won the war’s only major action between lines of battle, the Battle of Malaga (13 August 1704), even though its ﬁfty ships of the line were outnumbered by a combined ﬂeet of forty-one English and twelve Dutch ships of the line commanded by Admiral of the Fleet Sir George Rooke. The French commander, Admiral Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, comte de Toulouse, an illegitimate son of Louis XIV, failed, however, to follow up his victory by recapturing Gibraltar. Faced with massive military expenses, Louis again cut his naval budget. By 1709 it probably was little more than half the roughly 21 million livres appropriated in 1704; meanwhile Parliament voted at least £2 million (roughly 30 million livres) every year from 1702 through 1714. Short of funds, the French navy began renting warships to private contractors as it had during the previous war. The number of ships of the line armed by the French navy declined from sixty-nine in 1706 to thirty-three in 1707, to twenty-seven in\n\n32 louis xiv and his wars\n\n1709, and to thirteen in 1711.25 Although France fought no more great ﬂeet actions, privately ﬁnanced French squadrons played a key role in keeping communications open to the French and Spanish possessions in the Western Hemisphere. They also supported combined operations in the Atlantic and Caribbean and in South America, including the captures of Santiago in the Portuguese Cape Verde Islands, Montserrat and St. Eustatius in the Caribbean, and Rio de Janeiro. Their attacks on English trade, the so-called guerre de course, tied down much of the English ﬂeet, as during the previous war, and brought in thousands of prizes. The French navy did maintain a ﬂeet in the Mediterranean in support of Louis’s grandson in his war in Spain against the Austrian claimant. This theater of operations attracted large English and Dutch ﬂeets, too. By 1706, ﬁfty-six of the eighty-eight English ships carrying 48 or more cannon were in the Mediterranean as well as sixteen of the twenty-eight Dutch.26 During the following year, the port of Toulon was besieged and the French Mediterranean ﬂeet had to be scuttled. After the enemy was driven off, the ships were raised, but at least ten ships of the line were ruined.27 The island of Minorca, possessing the ﬁnest port in the western Mediterranean, was captured in 1708 by the navy of Great Britain. (England and Scotland had agreed to an act of union the previous year, thereby transforming the English navy into the British navy.) Louis was saved by two factors. First, the British and Dutch war efforts were dependent on continued ﬁnancing by merchants and landowners who elected Parliament and the States General of the Netherlands. These taxpayers lacked patience for wars of attrition with limited and possibly unattainable objectives, long casualty lists, and high taxes, as would also be the case in later British wars with France. Louis, humbled by defeat, demonstrated in adversity\n\nlouis xiv and his wars\n\n33\n\ngreat fortitude and patience. He was ﬁnally able to detach Great Britain and the Netherlands from their alliance with the Habsburgs. The Austrians, British, and Dutch did not send their best troops to Spain; thus Philip V, with French help, was able to prevail.28 The War of the Spanish Succession was ended in 1713–14 by the Peace of Utrecht and the Peace of Rystadt. Philip retained the Spanish throne, although Spain lost Minorca and Gibraltar to Britain, Sicily to the Duke of Savoy, and Milan, Sardinia, Naples, and the Spanish Netherlands to Austria. France lost its colonies at Hudson Bay and Newfoundland and the part of its colony of Acadia that now is Nova Scotia, although Louis retained some of his earlier territorial gains in Europe. Of even more importance to French security, the treaties assigned the Spanish Netherlands to Austria, which had no navy and whose army was mostly based far to the east. This neutralized the area’s threat to either France or Britain and made possible a reconciliation between France and Britain and an era of peace for all of Europe.\n\n3. Foolish Wars End an Age of Peace\n\nI\n\nAlthough the War of the Spanish Succession did not eliminate France as a competitor, it still was a major British triumph. The British now had the world’s most powerful navy, as the French had been beaten and heavy military expenses had forced the Dutch to abandon naval competition. The acquisition of Gibraltar and Minorca, where dockyards were built, permitted Britain to intervene in the Mediterranean whenever it wished. The lessons learned in twenty-ﬁve years of war had vastly improved naval administration. With more seaworthy and better provisioned ships, it was easier to conduct overseas operations. In the 1720s Britain established dockyards at Jamaica and Antigua, followed in 1749 by Halifax. This provided an important advantage over France for conducting naval operations in the Western Hemisphere.1 The increase of trade during the recent wars led to an expansion of merchant shipping and hence to a larger number of sailors for when the navy needed them. The incorporation of the privately ﬁnanced Bank of England in 1694 provided the navy an efﬁcient and reliable source of loans. Although the bank had some early difﬁculties, it soon helped the British government gain a reputation for trustworthiness. This permitted it to borrow money at home and abroad at reasonable\n\nfoolish wars end an age of peace\n\n35\n\ninterest rates; until 1797, the bank’s notes could be exchanged for coin. The British government also established a permanent national debt whose interest was guaranteed. In contrast, the French government repudiated part of its debts, undermining its reputation and forcing it to pay higher interest rates. Moreover, its attempts to establish a national bank ended in a 1720 bankruptcy so spectacular that no further attempt was made during the seventy years before the French Revolution.2 During the eighteenth century, power— including sea power—was based on credit, so the French were at a severe disadvantage. Queen Anne, the ruler of Great Britain since the death of her sister, Mary, in 1694 and brother-in-law, William, in 1702, had little time to enjoy Britain’s triumphs. She died in August 1714, leaving no children. The throne passed to her closest Protestant relative, her distant cousin George, elector of Hanover, a great-grandson of James I of England. George was experienced in both government and war. For the previous sixteen years he had ruled Hanover, a medium-sized principality in northwestern Germany; he also had commanded an army in Germany between 1707 and 1709. Even more important than his experience were his character and ability. Wise, moderate, decisive, and subtle, he proved an able monarch. His accession created a problem for Louis XIV of France, who had given exile and recognition to the deposed James II of England and, after James’s death in 1701, to his heir, James Edward Stuart. Louis’s sense of moral obligation to the Stuarts conﬂicted with his reluctance to lead France into yet another war. He was willing to provide covertly muskets and gunpowder to supporters of James Edward Stuart, but to go no further. On 1 September 1715 Louis died; two weeks later, the Earl of Mar, a Scottish supporter of the\n\n36\n\nfoolish wars end an age of peace\n\nStuarts, raised the standard of rebellion. The Jacobites (supporters of a Stuart restoration) managed to gain initial control of much of Scotland, but their rebellion was badly led and received virtually no help from France. George I, in contrast, received the assistance of 6,000 Swiss and Dutch troops and deployed thirty warships to seal off the rebels. By early 1716 the rebellion was defeated.3 The French had their own dynastic problems. Louis XIV’s son, the dauphin, was dead, and the Treaty of Utrecht prevented Louis’s grandson, Philip V of Spain, or Philip’s heirs from assuming the French throne. Instead, ﬁrst in line of succession was Louis XIV’s ﬁve-year-old great-grandson, also named Louis, who was in fragile health. Louis XIV’s will provided for a council of regency until the young king was able to govern for himself. The regency council’s nominal head was Philippe, duc d’Orléans, son of Louis XIV’s younger brother, but the late king had wished a major role in the council for his own illegitimate sons. Orléans moved quickly to forestall his rivals by quashing the late king’s will and taking control of the French government as regent on behalf of his young cousin.4 Orléans, although dissolute in his personal life, was as shrewd, moderate, and peace loving as was George I. He also was a kind and respectful protector of the young Louis XV. Moreover, Orléans had a family bond with the king of England, as his mother was the niece of George’s beloved late mother. Cooperation promised political beneﬁts for both men. There also were solid diplomatic reasons for an alliance between Britain and France. Although war had ended in western Europe, it continued in the region of the Baltic contested by Sweden and Russia. As elector of Hanover, George joined in the coalition against Sweden, making use of the British ﬂeet and the diplomatic skills of Admiral Sir John Norris, but he feared the growth of Russian power. France also was concerned about the\n\nfoolish wars end an age of peace\n\n37\n\nBaltic region, which supplied both the British and French navies with iron, masts, timber, and naval materiel such as hemp, pitch, tallow, and tar. A British-French alliance might permit a compromise peace and establish a balance of power in the Baltic.5 Two superb diplomats, James Stanhope and Guillaume Dubois, conducted the negotiations for an alliance. Britain and France reached agreement in the autumn of 1716; soon thereafter the Dutch joined the alliance. It permitted a common front that ﬁnally led to a compromise peace in the Baltic in the summer of 1721. It also allowed France and Britain to check the aggression of Philip V of Spain, who in 1717–18 attacked Sardinia and Sicily in hopes of regaining some of Spain’s lost territories. In response, a French army invaded Spain while a ﬂeet of twenty British ships of the line commanded by Admiral Sir George Byng defeated a Spanish ﬂeet of eleven ships of the line off Cape Passaro, Sicily, capturing seven of them.6 In early 1720 a chastened Spain joined the FrancoBritish-Dutch alliance. Orléans died in late 1723, just after the coronation of Louis XV, who had reached the age of majority. Orléans’s distant cousin, LouisHenri, duc de Bourbon and prince de Condé, served as Louis’s chief minister for two and a half years. He did not challenge the British alliance, but concentrated on ﬁnding a wife of marriageable age for the young king. Before he was removed from ofﬁce in June 1726, he succeeded in marrying Louis to Marie Leszczynska, daughter of the deposed king of Poland, Stanislas Leszczynski. Bourbon’s successor was the wise and moderate tutor of the king, Archbishop (and soon Cardinal) André-Hercule de Fleury. Already seventy-six years old, he served as unofﬁcial chief minister until his death in 1743.7 He continued the French partnership with George I until the latter’s death in mid-1727. George’s son\n\n38\n\nfoolish wars end an age of peace\n\nand successor, George II, begrudgingly accepted the continuation of the alliance. Never had Europe seen a period of peace as wide-ranging and long-lasting as that which endured from late 1721 to late 1733, a peace that largely was the product of the alliance between Britain and France, the only states wealthy enough to make a lengthy war on their own or to subsidize other states to make war. Brief hostilities between Britain and Spain did occur in 1727, but largely were restricted to artillery exchanges at Gibraltar. Except for it and a Russo-Persian war in 1722–23 that reached as far north as Tbilisi, the guns of Europe remained silent, even though sometimes violent colonial disputes continued in Africa, the Caribbean, and the ﬁsheries off North America.8 There even was a mechanism, although somewhat primitive, for preventing disputes from degenerating into war: the congresses held at Cambrai and then at Soissons, which were attended by representatives of the major powers. Peace brought economic growth to both Great Britain and France.9 It also brought greatly diminished naval rivalry. Orléans presided over the liquidation of much of the great ﬂeet built by Louis XIV. The expenses of the massive wars of the last decades of Louis’s life had forced the curtailment of naval construction. From 1696 through 1715 the French navy launched only about thirty ships of the line, none carrying more than 76 cannon. At this time all French ships of the line were built of oak; only the Spanish dockyard at Havana had access to tropical hardwoods such as Cuban cedar or mahogany, while ships of the line built of teak did not appear until the nineteenth century. As few ships of oak survived more than twelve to sixteen years of normal service before having to be rebuilt or scrapped, most of the French navy was ready for demolition.10 This took place ruthlessly once the War of the Spanish Succession\n\nfoolish wars end an age of peace\n\n39\n\nwas ended. By 1720 only twelve ships of the line that had served in Louis XIV’s navy remained on the navy’s active roll.11 Although the British navy also reduced its strength somewhat, it still contained over 100 ships of the line in 1720.12 From 1720 through 1728 the French navy undertook a moderate building program, launching twenty-ﬁve ships of the line, while the British launched thirty. Ten of the French ships were of a new type carrying 74 cannon that were more powerful than the 70’s and 60’s that composed the bulk of the British ﬂeet. The French building program was large enough to maintain a ﬂeet in being, but not so large as to menace Britain. By 1728 all of the ships of 80–110 cannon built by Louis XIV had been demolished, and only one new one had been built.13 Tension in North America also diminished. Louis XIV’s last two wars had seen heavy ﬁghting there, including unsuccessful English attacks on Quebec in 1691 and 1711. After 1714, hostilities ceased, although New France (Canada and all the other French possessions north of Louisiana) and various British colonies such as New York competed for the Indian fur trade. No ﬁrm agreement was reached by Britain and France at Utrecht on the boundaries between New France and the neighboring British colonies. Resolution of territorial issues, such as what was included in the French cession of Acadia, was left to a bilateral boundary commission, but it proved an ineffective mechanism for adjudicating disputes. Meanwhile the rivals reinforced their claims by building forts in disputed areas such as the British American fortiﬁed trading post at Oswego on Lake Ontario (1727) and the more substantial French fort of St. Frédéric on Lake Champlain (1737). They also competed by proxy through seeking inﬂuence over the Indians nations who continued to dominate the area. Sometimes they fought those nations they considered hostile, such as the bloody French war against the Fox.\n\n40\n\nfoolish wars end an age of peace\n\nThe powerful Iroquois confederacy, however, served in effect as a neutral buffer state between them. The Franco-British frontier, however, was less tense than the border between the new British colony of Georgia and Spanish Florida or possibly even the border between the French colony of Louisiana and the neighboring Spanish colony of Texas.14 In spite of the advantages of the alliance to both parties, the relationship between Britain and France was an uneasy one, particularly after the deaths of George I and the duc d’Orléans. George II, the pugnacious new British king, did not wish to play a subordinate role to France, and beneath his mild manners Fleury was equally domineering. In early 1731 Britain and the Netherlands signed a defensive alliance, the Treaty of Vienna, with France’s rival, Austria. Two years later Louis XV made an alliance with his uncle, Philip V of Spain, the so-called Family Compact.15 For practical purposes the Franco-British alliance was dead, although neither Fleury nor the British prime minister, the peaceable Robert Walpole, wished relations to deteriorate further. The dozen years of European peace ﬁnally ended soon after the death of Augustus II of Poland on 1 February 1733. The Polish monarchy was elective, and it was inevitable that Louis XV would support the election of his deposed father-in-law. It was also inevitable that this would be opposed by Russia and Austria, allies since 1726. They supported the son of the late Augustus. The French candidate, Stanislas Leszczynski, was elected king on 12 September 1733; ten days later, advancing Russian troops forced him to ﬂee Warsaw. The following month, France declared war on Austria and Russia. Fleury took extraordinary steps to keep Britain out of the war. By promising not to invade the Austrian Netherlands (now Belgium) he\n\nfoolish wars end an age of peace\n\n41\n\nensured the neutrality of the neighboring United Provinces of the Netherlands. This gave the British a reason for remaining neutral as well; moreover, George disliked the Austrians as much as he disliked the French and was willing to evade his obligations to them. The French government made sure he would not change his mind. It refrained from mobilizing a major ﬂeet at Brest and sent only a token force of two ships of the line, one frigate, and a few thousand troops to Danzig where Stanislas had taken refuge. This tiny force was easily overwhelmed by the Russians. Meanwhile larger French armies were ﬁghting successfully against the Austrians in Germany and, with Spanish help, in northern Italy.16 The defeat of Stanislas served Fleury’s diplomatic purposes. In an elaborate series of exchanges that ended the War of the Polish Succession in 1735, Stanislas was awarded the duchy of Lorraine in compensation for the loss of Poland. Upon his death in 1766, this vital principality, which during part of Louis XIV’s reign had been French, reverted to France. This ended a grave danger to France as the previous duke, Francis Stephen, was engaged to be married to Maria Theresa, the daughter and designated heir of Emperor Charles VI, the archduke of Austria. Had Lorraine passed into Austrian hands, French security would have been severely compromised. In compensation, Francis received the right to inherit the duchy of Tuscany in northern Italy. Spain also beneﬁted. Austria gave Prince Charles (Don Carlos), a younger son of King Philip, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (the Kingdom of Naples and the Kingdom of Sicily) in exchange for the small duchy of Parma in northern Italy and the relinquishing of Charles’s claims to Tuscany. The various exchanges were made in 1737 when the ﬁnal Austrian-French treaty was signed and when France took over administration of Lorraine on behalf of Stanislas.17\n\n42\n\nfoolish wars end an age of peace\n\nThere, however, had been a price to pay for France’s gains in territory and prestige. That price was neglect of the French navy. From 1729 through 1737 France launched only four ships of the line and purchased a ﬁfth; during the same years the British navy launched thirty-three.18 The French navy was not able to recover from those lost years for decades to come. II\n\nIn the aftermath of the War of the Polish Succession, many Britons seem to have suffered a crisis of conﬁdence. Walpole’s neutrality during the war had helped France to increase its relative strength on the European continent and thus potentially to weaken Britain’s security. As long as Fleury maintained his power, Britain had little to fear, but his age and frailty were a source of concern. Equally concerning was the growth of French trade. Britons commonly perceived Britain’s power to stem from its prosperity. French economic growth seemed almost as threatening as French military power.19 Luckily few areas of direct confrontation menaced the fragile peace between the two countries, as rivalry in India was regarded chieﬂy as a matter for their respective East India companies and rivalry in America as being mostly of local concern. The same could not be said of relations between Britain and France’s ally Spain. According to the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, modiﬁed in 1716, the South Sea Company of Great Britain had the right, called the asiento, to provide 4,800 slaves to the Spanish colonial empire for each of the next thirty years. It also had the right to send a ship each year to participate in trade fairs in Spanish Central America. The South Sea Company used these privileges to engage in massive smuggling to the heavily regulated but undersupplied Spanish colonies of the Caribbean. Spain retaliated by establishing patrols, using\n\nfoolish wars end an age of peace\n\n43\n\nships called guarda costas, to repress the smuggling. Claiming the right to inspect British ships, they engaged in their own abuses, seizing ships and imprisoning sailors, sometimes even innocent ones. Between 1725 and 1737 several dozen ships were taken by the guarda costas. In 1731 a guarda costa captured the Rebecca, and its crew cut off the left ear of the Rebecca’s master, Robert Jenkins. In October 1737 the merchants of London petitioned the king to procure satisfaction for such Spanish abuses and to prevent British ships from being visited and seized illegally.20 To the great discomfort of Sir Robert Walpole and his ministry, the London press and public opinion took up the merchants’ cause. Relations with Spain were part of the responsibilities of Thomas Pelham-Holles, Duke of Newcastle, the secretary of state for the southern department and the senior and more inﬂuential of the two secretaries of state. Newcastle soon began negotiations with Spain. Unfortunately, Philip V of Spain was even touchier about his honor than was George II. It took until the beginning of 1739 to arrange a compromise agreement, the Convention of the Pardo. As part of the agreement, the Spanish government agreed to pay £95,000, perhaps equivalent in today’s terms to $10 million. Of this sum, £68,000 would be paid by the South Sea Company in compensation for taxes not hitherto paid to Spain. The English public was disappointed, believing that a war with Spain would be both quick and proﬁtable, especially considering there was an enormous disparity between the British and Spanish navies. At sea or in port, Britain had about 100 warships of 50 or more cannon, a third of them carrying 80, 90, or 100 cannon. Some needed repair, and when war broke out, it would be difﬁcult to ﬁnd crewmen to man them, but even so the British navy dwarfed the Spanish navy, which contained about forty-two ships of the line,\n\n44\n\nfoolish wars end an age of peace\n\nonly two of which carried more than 70 cannon, the Real Felipe, 112, and the Santa Isabel, 80.21 Walpole’s hopes for a peaceful resolution of British-Spanish disputes, seemingly on the verge of fulﬁllment, were foiled, however, and the public ﬁnally got the war it wished, the so-called War of Jenkins’s Ear. This reversal of fortune was caused by the greed of the South Sea Company, which refused to pay its share of the settlement, the opportunism of Newcastle, who in order to court popularity decided to keep a British ﬂeet of ten ships of the line in the Mediterranean even though the Spaniards had demobilized their ﬂeet, and the pride of Philip V, who responded to this insult by breaking off negotiations, thereby making war inevitable. Britain was provocative toward France, too. Its Mediterranean ﬂeet began a blockade of Cadiz in June 1739, stopping ships of neutral countries, including France. When the French protested, Newcastle responded in a conciliatory manner, and the crisis passed. Soon, however, Britain would threaten French interests in a manner to which even the cautious Fleury had to respond. Britain ofﬁcially went to war against Spain on 19 October 1739. The navy already was well on its way to being fully manned as sailors arriving on merchant ships were pressed into service: by August 1739 forty-eight ships of the line (including 50-gun ships) were in sea pay. By September sixty-eight were in service, and by January 1740 there were seventy-seven.22 The question facing Walpole, Newcastle, First Lord of the Admiralty Sir Charles Wager, and their colleagues was how best to use them.23 Britain hoped that the blockade of Cadiz, the chief Spanish naval port, would interrupt Spain’s trade with its Caribbean colonies. The blockade was not very successful, however, because Spain was able to divert its shipping to other ports. Parliament and the public expected the\n\nfoolish wars end an age of peace\n\n45\n\nBritish navy to capture Spanish treasure ships bringing gold and silver to Cadiz. Given the uncertainty of such a success, however, the British government decided to capture, and perhaps retain, one or more of the ports from which the treasure ships departed. It initially planned to capture Manila, from which the famed Manila galleons sailed for Acapulco.24 The Walpole government realized, however, that to capture distant Manila and have the news reach England would take too long to satisfy the public. Soon after war was declared, it shifted its objective to the Caribbean, particularly to the great port and shipbuilding center of Havana. It hoped by the summer of 1740 to send 8,000 marines and soldiers to the British West Indies to rendezvous with 3,000 soldiers raised in the British colonies of North America. From there they would proceed to attack Havana. In March 1740 news arrived that Vice Admiral Edward Vernon, commanding the British West Indies squadron, had successfully raided Porto Bello, an important Spanish port in Central America. Vernon became a national hero, and British expectations of further successes rose.25 It was impossible to keep secret the preparation in England of the large number of transports, supply ships, and escorting warships needed for so large an expedition and easy to guess that the expedition would be sent to the Caribbean. The English preparations presented a challenge to Cardinal Fleury. Although he was reluctant for war, he could not permit the British to make any conquests that would upset the balance of power or threaten France’s commercial interests. Fortunately the French had colonies in the area, particularly the wealthy colony of St. Domingue (now Haiti) near Cuba, and the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe to the south, not far from the Spanish Main, the Spanish possessions along the northern coast of South America. Short of an act of war, Great\n\n46 foolish wars end an age of peace\n\nBritain could not prevent France from sending warships to its own colonies, from where they could sail to help the Spaniards. Fleury’s strategy was even more successful than expected, accomplishing its objectives without even having to resort to hostilities. It took many months for the British to assemble its ships and troops for the Caribbean. The troops were not embarked aboard transports until August 1740. By then the French navy was ready. On 25 August a dozen ships of the line sailed from Toulon, and a week later another fourteen sailed from Brest. This represented virtually the entire effective strength of the French navy, which had only thirty-ﬁve ships of the line, including those not in condition to serve. The Spanish navy sent a dozen ships of the line to reinforce its small squadron in the Caribbean.26 In December 1740 the troop convoy from England reached its rendezvous point, the island of Dominica, and then proceeded to Jamaica. By now the entire French ﬂeet was at St. Domingue, in position to help protect Havana or to threaten Jamaica. It was so weakened by disease, however, that on 27 January 1741 all but seven ships of the line sailed for France.27 Nevertheless it accomplished its mission. Vernon, commanding the thirty British ships of the line collected at Jamaica, decided that Havana was too strong to be attacked with the 8,500 British and American troops at his disposal, particularly since more than a third of them were needed to ﬁll out the crews of his warships. He persuaded Major General Thomas Wentworth, commanding the army detachment, to switch his target to the rich port of Cartagena de Indias on the Spanish Main, which the French had raided in 1697. Before sailing there, however, Vernon felt it necessary to deal with the French ﬂeet at St. Domingue. By the time he arrived, most of the French ﬂeet was gone. A probable war with France was averted, but Vernon’s futile voyage to St. Domingue\n\nfoolish wars end an age of peace\n\n47\n\ntook several weeks during which disease continued to erode the number of Vernon’s crewmen and Wentworth’s troops. Vernon and Wentworth did not reach the area of Cartagena until 4 March 1741. They then had a series of obstacles to overcome. To reach the harbor of Cartagena, they had to reduce several Spanish forts. After they secured the harbor, they still had to capture the city of Cartagena, which was protected by other forts. After neutralizing several forts, the British ﬁnally were able to enter the harbor on 26 March. They either captured or forced the Spaniards to scuttle all their naval forces in the harbor, including six ships of the line. Before Cartagena could be attacked, however, the main fort covering the approaches to the city had to be taken, a fort that was out of reach of the guns of the British ﬂeet. Vernon, frightened by the number of crew members’ deaths from disease, demanded that the fort be stormed rather than besieged in order to save time. Wentworth agreed to the demand, but the attack was repulsed on 9 April, with almost 600 casualties. A week later the British began evacuating their army. The defeat at Cartagena cost the British their best opportunity for a victory in the Caribbean. Later operations on the east coast of Cuba and in Central America were total failures. The Cartagena operation illustrates a major problem in British amphibious operations during the age of sail: the conﬂicting demands of naval and army commanders. The British government generally was unwilling to place one in command of the other. Only when one was unselﬁsh enough to subordinate his wishes to the other’s were combined operations successful.28 III\n\nWhile the French ﬂeet was in the Caribbean, the entire course of French diplomacy changed. On 20 October 1740 Charles VI died.\n\n48\n\nfoolish wars end an age of peace\n\nLike every other Holy Roman Emperor over the previous three centuries, Charles was a member of the House of Habsburg. As such he was the archduke of Austria, king of Hungary, king of Bohemia, and ruler over the other lands of the Habsburg patrimony. Charles, having no male heir, left his lands to his daughter Maria Theresa, although as a woman she was not eligible for election as Holy Roman Emperor. By the treaty that had ended the War of the Polish Succession, France had recognized Maria Theresa’s rights of inheritance, the so-called Pragmatic Sanction. Since the end of that war Fleury had been working for a French-Austrian alliance; this should have been the moment to complete it. On the other hand, France had considerable temptations to disregard its obligations to Maria Theresa. A century earlier the Habsburgs had failed to turn the Holy Roman Empire into a modern uniﬁed state like France or Spain. Since then, however, they had rebuilt their strength by expanding to the east and south against the Ottoman Empire, which included most of the Balkans as well as Turkey and much of the Middle East. By stripping the Habsburgs of much of their territory, the Habsburg threat, which had dominated French diplomacy for centuries, could be ended. The most tempting reason for war against Austria, however, was not Austrian strength but Austrian weakness. The treaty that ended the War of the Polish Succession had diminished the Austrian threat by turning Lorraine into a French client state, depriving Austria of a prime invasion route into France. Moreover, in 1739 the Austrian army had been defeated by the lightly regarded Turkish army, and Austria was forced to surrender Belgrade, with France mediating the peace.29 Finally the young and inexperienced Maria Theresa did not appear a formidable opponent. As Louis XV hesitated, Frederick II, the new ruler of Prussia (a\n\nfoolish wars end an age of peace\n\n49\n\nmedium-sized state mostly in northeastern Germany), acted. In December 1740 he invaded the rich Habsburg province of Silesia, which today forms the southwestern portion of Poland.30 In the jungle of eighteenth-century European diplomacy, weakness invited predators like Frederick. Would the young and naïve Louis XV join the pack? Fleury did his best to restrain Louis. Inadvertently, however, he had created a rival for the king’s attention. Maria Theresa wished her h"
