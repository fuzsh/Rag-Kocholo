A scarce map of the British raid on the harbour of St Malo on 6th June 1758 (not 1762 as in the title), published in Raspe's 'Schau Platz des gegenwaertigen Kriegs' (Plates illustrating the Current Wars).

This was the first of the 'Descents', lightning raids on the French coast championed by William Pitt in 1758. Deciding not to take St Malo as planned, the fleet destroyed thirty privateers and over a hundred other vessels in the harbour and occupied the nearby town of St Servant, burning the important rope factory that supplied the French ships with rigging.
