        "text": "Claire Voyant\n\nLustre\n\nCD (2009) · $12.98 add to cart Listen & Buy on Bandcamp\n\nSeven years is a long time to wait between releasing albums. However for Claire Voyant, the wait was well worth it. Their newest release, Lustre, shows a dramatic overall improvement in their musical compositions and a maturity in their lyrics. From the opening title track, the album grabs you and doesn't let go like a long lost love. Each track is beautifully written and accentuated by Victoria Lloyd's amazing vocals, but just because the music sounds beautiful, it doesn't mean that every song is a happy one. Lustre weaves a rich emotional tapestry of the human spirit, but its up to you to decide what it means to you.\n\nTrack List\n\n01. Lustre\n\n02. Shine\n\n03. Into Oblivion\n\n04. Another Day (The Subtle Thief of Youth)\n\n05. Mercurial\n\n06. Painted Gold\n\n07. Lost\n\n08. Flicker\n\n09. Broadcast\n\n10. Washaway"
