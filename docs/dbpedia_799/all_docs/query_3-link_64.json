Once fallen into her innocently disguised trap, her prestigious guests could only surrender and let her guide their voices through the shifting shadows of her hard industrial arrangements. And this is how NEIKKA RPM's new album features the virulent venom of prominent male vocalists in the likes of Claus Larsen (LEAETHER STRIP), Claus Kruse (PLASTIC NOISE EXPERIENCE), J3 (Ã ;GRUMH...), Len Lemeire (IMPLANT), DJ Rexx Arkana (BRUDERSCHAFT/ FGFC820) and a unique spoken-word performance from the acclaimed Japanese cyberpunk author Kenji Siratori, all of which perfectly contrast Dominique's whispery incantations...\n\nMusically, she brings her characteristic Industrial N' Beats furious style to the next level, adding more depth through intricate programming and distant comforting voices all ride a heavy wave of devastating dancefloor-crushing beats and mysterious textures. As usual, NEIKKA RPM again subtly conjures her secret composition tricks and sassy whispers to make you instantly fall victim to her eternal spell of seduction...\n\nHypnotic, dark and complex, this new album, \"The Rise of the 13th Serpent\" comes as a highly recommended sonic experience far away from the beaten path. Half-Angel / Half-Demon, Dominique also brings to us a luxury double-CD carton box edition of her new album for her staunch fanbase who will enjoy her bonus photos and poster as well as the 13 exclusive remixes featured on the second disc by acts like ADAM X, TERRORFAKT, MORPHINE SHOT, I :SCINTILLA, BRAINCLAW, DAWN OF ASHES, MASSIV IN MENSCH, IC434, KOBOLD, MODULATE, REVOLUTION STATE, etc.\n\nNeikka RPM is in the \"X-posed feature\" of the Sept/Oct issue of Insomnia Magazine (UK)\n\nAlfa Matrix 5-year anniversary 2CD compilation out now\n\nThe Belgian based label Alfa Matrix has just released a special 2CD compilation,\n\n\"Alfa Matrix - Re:connected [2.0]\", to celebrate its 5th anniversary. 30 label bands are offering previously unreleased songs or rare mixes/versions for the occasion.\n\nIncludes music from such acts as Front 242, Unter Null, Zombie Girl, Neikka RPM,\n\nMentallo & The Fixer, Claus Larsen and many others!\n\nFeatures the Neikka RPM single, \"Demon Breeder\" Anno 5 remix\n\nV/A - \"Re:connected [2.0]\" 2CD carton box\n\n2nd volume of ENDZEIT BUNKERTRACKS 4CD box series on the charts!
