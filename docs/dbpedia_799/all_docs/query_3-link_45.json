Shelf order is roughly alphabetical by author albeit with frequent topically associated insertions and disturbances. The exact location of this run in the house is unknown; the breaks in alphabetical sequence and nature of material possibly represent transitions between rooms or shelves.\n\nSections L-M-N of the alpha run are intermixed, as are P-Q-R-S as well as U-V-W-Y- Z, respectively. The alpha run is further interrupted between \"Laruelle\" (sequential inventory identifier 3865) and \"Meyer\" (sequential inventory identifier 4036) by a group of works by authors beginning with the letter \"R,\" works by or about Derrida, and others. A group of works by authors beginning with the letters J-K-L follows the end of the main alpha run, beginning with \"Jablonka\" (sequential inventory identifier 6780) and ending with \"Kinsella\" (sequential inventory identifier 7334.) That section is followed by a group consisting largely of serial issues (sequential inventory identifier 7335-7856) and another of seemingly unsorted but largely inscribed volumes (sequential inventory identifier 7857-8193).) A second pocket of works by or about Derrida concludes the run of gift books, ending at sequential inventory identifier 8719. It is followed by a small number of inscribed travel books.\n\nSingle copies may be made for research purposes. To cite or publish quotations that fall within Fair Use, as defined under U. S.

For the online finding aid to the Jacques Derrida Papers at Irvine, click here.\n\nA duplicate set of the manuscripts housed at Irvine is available under the collection name Fonds Jacques Derrida at the Institut mémoires de l'édition contemporaine. For the online finding aid at IMEC, click here.\n\nAt the time of acquisition, inserted material had been systematically removed from a subset of volumes and placed in a number of subject-based boxes and envelopes. Notes received by PUL from the dealer reflect this and are quoted in this finding aid in the interest of making the history of the collection's custodial interventions fully transparent.\n\nAll separated insertions received by PUL were re-inserted upon receipt of the collection in an effort to preserve archival context and service the collection as close as possible to its working state.\n\nA small number of separated insertions were not received by PUL and are so identified in the finding aid."
