Help me\n\nHailstones and daggers give heat without your light ghost of\n\nNo one knows her I have seen you hold her\n\nAisle of fire close to you and desire Iâm half\n\nThe night I woke in laughter the pain came surely\n\n» More on Claire Voyant\n\nClean Lyric\n\nParagraph Lyric\n\nLie in darkness of her daily gaze\n\nwrite the words I will never say\n\nblues and ragdolls over the railings edge\n\nlost forever in your head\n\nI recall moments over and done\n\nthen daylight enters-the sun\n\nand I wake up\n\ntry to mask with over saline words\n\nraise your glass to empty words\n\nlean the dashboard\n\nmy hero is underground\n\nhe is gone forever\n\nsleeping sound\n\nI recall moments run into one\n\nthen daylight enters-the sun\n\nand I wake up\n\nLie in darkness of her daily gaze write the words I will never say blues and ragdolls over the railings edge lost forever in your head I recall moments over and done then daylight enters-the sun and I wake up try to mask with over saline words raise your glass to empty words lean the dashboard my hero is underground he is gone forever sleeping sound I recall moments run into one then daylight enters-the sun and I wake up"
