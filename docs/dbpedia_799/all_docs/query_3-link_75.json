And there are three different plans to use the translator: Starter, Advanced and Ultimate with different advantages and features each of them.<br/>The free plan allows us limited translation volume and other limits on the translation of files per user. But we can use any of the payment plans. The Starter plan is priced at 5.99 euros per month with annual billing or 8.99 euros per month per user for monthly billing. It has unlimited text translation and up to five files per month, it allows you to have a glossary with 5,000 entries. The Advanced plan is worth 19.99 euros per month with annual billing or 29.99 euros per month with monthly billing and allows unlimited translation volume and up to twenty files per month. Finally, the Ultimate plan is priced at 39.99 euros per month with annual billing and 59.99 euros per month with monthly billing. One hundred total files per month and unlimited text translation.

The advantage of using the mobile app is that you have options to translate using the camera, translate text from images, etc. A very useful tool that we can use on trips if we want to understand a restaurant menu or any text that we find in a language that we do not use.<br/> How does it work Using it is very simple, there are no complications and we do not have to download anything or register.

If you want to have more languages ​​or more options on Android, choose Google.\n\nThe role of Indigenous language Proficiency in a military environment has been identified as key to combating crime in Nigeria.\n\nThe Nigerian Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Taoreed Lagbaja made this known during the Graduation Ceremony of Indigenous Languages Course 16, 2024 in Collaboration with LACLIC Service Limited at the Nigerian Army Resource Centre in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital.\n\nRepresented by the Chief of Administration, Army, Major General Jimmy Akpor, the Army Chief said that “the benefits of the Indigenous Languages Programme to the Nigerian military in particular and the nation in general cannot be overemphasised.”\n\nAccording to him, this is because the nation’s security environment is undermined by a myriad of security challenges across the 6 geopolitical zones, which elicited the attention of all within and outside the country.\n\nHe said that “the languages learned will help the troops in no small way in communicating appropriately with their friends, colleagues and confidants from other tribes and aid the security operations of the troops across the nation.”\n\nLieutenant General Lagbaja noted that the security environment in the country has necessitated the deployment of military personnel in the 36 states of the Federation, FCT inclusive.\n\nHe stressed that troops are engaged in various internal security operations, which include counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations in the North East and South East, anti-banditry in the North West, herders and farmers clashes in the North Central, kidnapping, robbery and other criminal activities in all parts of the Federation.\n\nHe also stated that these operations are intelligence-driven and you must all be aware that credible and reliable intelligence depends highly on effective communication with and from the local populace.\n\n“Effective communication on its part will require some level of proficiency in the local dialect of the operating environment. Therefore, proficiency in the three major Nigerian languages of Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba will assist you to adequately and professionally relate with the local populace and perform assigned tasks. This informed the decision of having the personnel to learn these languages,” he said.\n\nFurthermore, he noted that there is a shift in the meaning, scope and dimension of security.\n\nHe said that “the definition and meaning of security have been expanded in the modern era from state or regime security, to cover all human activities.”\n\n“Citizens are now the essence and Centre of security and whatever is done in the conduct of internal security is viewed as what happened to people. It is therefore important for you to understand that the environment where you operate is of utmost importance in the performance of your tasks, thus, the need to understand the people, which can only be through communication and their languages,” he added.\n\nHe charged the troops to rekindle their zeal and efforts in conducting the tasks and responsibilities given to them as essential parts of their constitutional roles in which the assigned tasks must be performed professionally and responsibly.\n\nFurthermore, all the assigned missions must be conducted within extant provisions of the law and in collaboration with sister Services and other security agency personnel, which is the hallmark of their professionalism.\n\nEarlier, the Director General of Army Resource Centre, Major General Garba Wahab, Retired, represented by the Executive Director NARC Consult, Major General Sadiq Ndalolo said creating cultural awareness amongst personnel and others in essence is seamless anywhere in the world.\n\nThe Director General said that “Indigenous language is the most important tool that helps to establish a natural force and mutual understanding among team members, above all, it helps to foster a conclusive and friendly environment, where military operations can be planned and executed in corporation support.”\n\nHe noted that the advantages of language Proficiency in a military environment signifies the importance of communication which can also help to build capacity in carrying out their responsibilities.\n\n“Let me also say that this underscores the value of the collaboration, collaboration that stands 6 years, the collaboration that has developed language proficiency in over 2,000 participants of this course,” he said.\n\nHe called on the participants to make the best of the opportunity provided by this course for them to establish a very robust Network of the language in particular.\n\nThe Director of Human Resource Development, NARC, Brigadier General Abimbola Yusuf who gave the course highlight said that since 2018, this course has been tested by power in the realization of language policy.\n\nHe said that “so far, the centre, in collaboration with LACLIC Service Limited has trained a total of 2088 personnel, all rounds across commissions, Nigerian military and other sister agencies.”\n\nHe appreciated the Chief of Army Staff for his oriented effort and drive in line with his commitment to well-trained personnel.\n\nHe said that “it is instructive to state that sustained indigenous language course objectives were to further the reaction of policy that requires officers and soldiers to be proficient in one indigenous language other than the mother tongue.”\n\n“It’s also aimed at bridging the communication barriers between personnel and the locals while conducting internal security operations and other operations across the country,” he added.\n\nAccording to him, a total of 162 participants, which comprised 23 officers and 139 soldiers, reported for the course.\n\nAccording to him, the matters of instruction adopted more classroom lectures and a combination of presentations, photo stories, and video games, as well as delegates and group work, participants were assessed in-class participation activities and written and puzzle examinations.\n\nThe program engaged in a field exercise during which participants were taken to Manbila Market, where instructors demonstrated their proficiency in buying and selling conversations.\n\nMeanwhile, there were Igbo, Hausa and Yoruba playlets by the grandaunts showing the power of living in peace and understanding other languages which will help in combating crime effectively.\n\nLantana Nasir Lantana\"\n\n#metaglossia_mundus: https://von.gov.ng/indigenous-languages-major-tool-in-combating-crime-coas/\n\nTim Walz speaks Mandarin. But don't expect to hear Kamala Harris' running mate deploying his Chinese language skills on the US election campaign trail.\n\nWhile languages are inextricably interlinked with identity, they are also becoming a political hot potato. In February, Donald Trump warned supporters that migrants \"have languages that nobody in this country has ever heard of. It's a very horrible thing.\"\n\nAnd J.D. Vance, now Trump's own vice-presidential pick, last year proposed an \"English Language Unity Act\" to make English the official language of the United States.\n\nDespite the potential electoral advantages of campaigning in multiple languages, the risks of alienating sections of the voting public mean candidates are wary of going too far.\n\nMonolingual politics\n\nEnglish-speaking countries are now home to enormous linguistic diversity, driven by decades of immigration. Around one in five Americans speak a language other than English at home. This proportion has more than doubled since 1980, according to US census data.\n\nThe percentages are similar in Australia and New Zealand, while in Canada, 23% of people have a mother tongue other than the official languages of English and French. In the United Kingdom, the share of non-English native speakers is smaller—roughly 10%—but the upward trend is the same.\n\nDespite these demographic shifts, however, election campaigns remain largely monolingual affairs. For example, there is little obvious sign of non-English messages in campaign leaflets uploaded to the Open Elections crowdsourcing website for the recent British election.\n\nExceptions largely prove the rule. For instance, in July, Republican Senator Ted Cruz launched a US$4.4 million Spanish-language campaign targeted at Hispanic voters—but only in Texas.\n\nIn New Zealand, the Labor Party translated its 2023 campaign slogan \"In it for you\" into the Māori language: \"Māu, Mā Tātou.\" But in practice the Māori version was used only sparingly, such as in the annual Māori language week that fell during the campaign period.\n\nMajority rules\n\nThe reluctance to engage in multilingual campaigning might seem surprising. After all, modern political parties frequently resemble businesses, competing for votes in the election marketplace.\n\nIn theory, they would have much to gain by speaking to voters—their customers—in their preferred tongues. As former German Chancellor Willy Brandt reportedly said: \"If I am selling to you, I speak your language. If I am buying, dann müssen Sie Deutsch sprechen.\"\n\nThe reluctance of parties to mount multilingual campaigns is probably driven by one major factor: they believe it would cost them votes overall. Indeed, research suggests multilingual campaigning runs the risk of turning off majority language voters.\n\nFor instance, a 2022 Canadian study found over 90% of French speakers in Quebec were annoyed by English-only campaign signs. A 2018 US study came to similar conclusions, with monolingual English speakers becoming more hostile to candidates who ran campaign ads in Spanish.\n\nStill, such attitudes are not necessarily set in stone. After all, legislatures themselves have undergone rapid shifts as parties reflect more diverse societies in their candidate selection.\n\nSome 14% of MPs in the British House of Commons now come from ethnic minorities, up from just 2% in 2005. And in Washington, 25% of members of Congress now identify as non-white, double the share of 20 years ago.\n\nThe picture is similar in Australia, while ethnic minorities—including Māori—now make up over 40% of New Zealand's parliament.\n\nAI translation\n\nOf course, change is not always easy. As things stand, few major parties in the Anglosphere even make their main websites available in a language other than English. And Pew Research Center data released in June showed just 68% of all US voters were comfortable with people speaking a language other than English in public.\n\nBut the risks must be set against the potential rewards. Many of the key swing states in the 2024 US campaign are becoming more and more diverse. Around 30% of people in Arizona and Nevada, and 10% in Georgia, are Hispanic. Battleground state Michigan is home to 13% of all Arabic speakers in the US, with 190,000 living in the Detroit metro area alone.\n\nIt is true that multilingualism can be complex and costly. AI solutions and algorithm-driven micro-targeting could be partial solutions—if used wisely.\n\nLessons might be drawn from India's recent election campaign, where the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) used AI to rapidly translate Prime Minister Narendra Modi's campaign messages from Hindi into the country's many other languages.\n\nUltimately, the chief potential benefit of genuine, two-way multilingual communication lies in its ability to help political parties understand and address the needs of more diverse populations.\n\nToday, multilingual campaigning in English-speaking countries remains rare. But in a tight campaign, it could provide a crucial edge.\n\nProvided by The Conversation\"\n\n#metaglossia_mundus: https://phys.org/news/2024-08-voters-languages-english-campaigning-risky.html\n\nThe lines between domestic and international markets have blurred in today’s interconnected world and with it comes the challenge of transcending language barriers.\n\nBusinesses of all sizes are finding opportunities to expand beyond borders, tap into new customer bases, and source talent from across the globe. This globalisation of commerce has created a vibrant, dynamic marketplace, but it also brings a complex challenge: communication across languages and cultures.\n\nThe ability to speak multiple languages is becoming increasingly valuable in the modern workplace. Companies need multilingual employees to connect with customers, negotiate with partners, and collaborate effectively with colleagues from diverse backgrounds. However, relying solely on human language skills can be limiting and costly. Not every employee can be fluent in every language, and professional translation services can strain budgets.\n\nThis is where AI steps in, offering a solution to the language barriers that arise in a globalised business environment. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, companies can bridge communication gaps, foster inclusivity, and tap into the full potential of a diverse workforce.\n\nLanguage barriers in the modern global workforce\n\nWhile globalisation opens doors to exciting opportunities, language barriers can create significant hurdles in the workplace. Miscommunication due to language differences can lead to a cascade of problems, impacting productivity, employee morale, and ultimately, a company's bottom line.\n\nLanguage barriers lead to missed business opportunities. Misunderstandings can derail negotiations, delay projects, and damage customer relationships. In a multilingual workforce, language barriers can also hinder collaboration and knowledge sharing. Employees may hesitate to express their ideas or ask questions if they are not confident in their language skills. This can lead to silos, missed innovation, and a less inclusive work environment.\n\nMoreover, language barriers can create challenges in employee training and development. If materials are not available in employees' native languages, they may struggle to understand complex concepts or safety procedures. This can increase the risk of accidents and compliance issues.\n\nThe good news is that AI is rapidly transforming the way we communicate across languages, offering solutions to overcome these challenges.\n\nThe rise of AI-powered translation tools\n\nIn the face of growing language challenges, AI-powered translation tools have emerged as a game-changer for businesses worldwide. These tools leverage the power of machine learning and natural language processing to bridge communication gaps in real-time, facilitating seamless interactions across languages.\n\nOne of the most significant advancements in AI translation is the development of real-time translation tools. These tools allow for instant translation of spoken or written language, enabling multilingual conversations and presentations to flow effortlessly.\n\nPlatforms like Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, and DeepL have made significant strides in improving accuracy and fluency, even for less common language pairs. A study by Nimdzi Insights found that the global market for machine translation is expected to reach US$1.5 billion by 2025. This growth is a testament to the increasing adoption and effectiveness of AI-powered translation in various industries.\n\nAI-powered translation tools are not just limited to real-time conversations. They are also revolutionising the way we handle documents and written communication. AI-powered document translation software can quickly and accurately translate large volumes of text, from emails and contracts to technical manuals and marketing materials. This eliminates the need for time-consuming and expensive manual translation, enabling businesses to operate more efficiently and reach wider audiences.\n\nIn addition to translation, AI is also being used to develop language learning tools that help individuals improve their language skills. These tools often incorporate adaptive learning algorithms that personalise the learning experience based on individual needs and progress. By making language learning more accessible and engaging, AI can empower employees to develop their language skills and contribute more effectively to a multilingual workplace.\n\nThe benefits of AI-powered translation are clear: increased productivity, improved collaboration, and expanded global reach. By breaking down language barriers, these tools enable businesses to tap into new markets, connect with diverse customers, and foster a more inclusive and productive workforce.\n\nContextual translations with Natural Language Processing\n\nWhile AI-powered translation tools have revolutionised how we communicate across languages, Natural Language Processing (NLP) takes it a step further. NLP is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and contextually relevant.\n\nUnlike traditional translation tools that focus on word-for-word substitution, NLP delves deeper into the nuances of language. It analyses syntax, semantics, and pragmatics to grasp the intended meaning behind words, sentences, and even entire documents. This allows for more accurate and natural-sounding translations, especially when dealing with idioms, cultural references, or industry-specific jargon.\n\nOne of the most powerful applications of NLP in the workplace is sentiment analysis. By analysing the tone and emotions expressed in written or spoken communication, NLP can help businesses gain valuable insights into customer feedback, employee satisfaction, and brand perception across different languages and cultures.\n\nNLP also powers chatbots and virtual assistants, which are increasingly used in customer service and internal communication. These AI-powered tools can understand and respond to user queries in multiple languages, providing 24/7 support and streamlining workflows.\n\nFurthermore, NLP is being used to develop advanced language models that can generate creative content, summarise documents, and even write code. These tools have the potential to automate various tasks, freeing up employees to focus on more strategic and creative work.\n\nBy going beyond simple translation, NLP opens new possibilities for cross-lingual communication and collaboration. It enables businesses to understand their global customers and employees on a deeper level, fostering stronger relationships and driving innovation.\n\nChallenges in AI adoption\n\nWhile AI offers tremendous potential for overcoming language barriers, it is essential to acknowledge and address the challenges and concerns that come with its implementation. One common concern is data privacy. AI language tools often require access to large volumes of data to improve their accuracy and functionality. Businesses must ensure that they have robust data protection measures in place to safeguard sensitive information and comply with relevant regulations.\n\nAnother challenge is ensuring the accuracy of AI translations, especially when dealing with complex or nuanced language. While AI translation has made significant strides, it is not foolproof. Human oversight and quality control remain crucial to ensure accurate and culturally sensitive communication.\n\nAdditionally, businesses should be mindful of potential biases embedded in AI algorithms. It is important to regularly audit and refine AI models to ensure they are fair and unbiased.\n\nFurthermore, it is important to recognise the limitations of AI in understanding cultural nuances and context. Certain expressions, idioms, or cultural references may not translate accurately or may even be offensive in certain contexts. To avoid misunderstandings, businesses should invest in cultural training for their employees and encourage open communication and feedback.\n\nBy proactively addressing these concerns, businesses can leverage the benefits of AI for language solutions while minimising potential risks. It is crucial to maintain a human-in-the-loop approach, where AI complements human expertise and cultural sensitivity.\n\nAs the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the need for effective communication across languages and cultures will only grow. AI is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of work, enabling businesses to build truly global workforces that are diverse, inclusive, and collaborative.\n\nBy breaking down language barriers, AI empowers individuals from different linguistic backgrounds to contribute their unique skills and perspectives, leading to richer innovation and problem-solving. It fosters a sense of belonging and empowerment, allowing employees to communicate confidently and authentically in their native languages.\"\n\n#metaglossia_mundus: https://www.peoplemattersglobal.com/article/technology/can-ai-reduce-language-barriers-in-a-global-team-42469"
