        "text": "Late Twentieth Century accounts of art history reveal crises across different artistic disciplines. More recently, the deepest recession since the Great Depression has destabilised the globe. These combined instances of turbulence and conflict shape the context of this research. Using different concepts of instability this study attempts to locate specific images, in art and in a wider cultural sphere, which demonstrate a strong connection to the concerns and processes of my own art practice. In order to do this I explore recurring examples of collapse through assorted definitions of its ‘image’. A description of collapse involving the English comedian Tommy Cooper, together with its transposition into a stilled photographic image, forms the fundamental basis of this study. I utilise this image of Cooper’s collapse to articulate a form of instability, both in terms of its physical appearance and the less apparent meanings made visible as a consequence. Examined in relation to uncertainty through illustrations of symbolic and ‘real’ death the signatures of collapse are then further explored in a variety of image studies throughout this thesis. These examples are then used to ascertain how meanings are constructed, transmitted and repeated through the image. Combining phenomenal accounts with firsthand interview material, a detailed case study of the artist Mike Nelson is used to advance this enquiry and to situate a comparative assessment of my own practice. These findings help to support a transferable system of image reproduction across different representational categories as the formula for a fragmented compositional strategy in my work. The results uphold the theory of a shift from art-history into image-history, whereby artworks in different mediums take on some form of equivalence. This then is the definition of my working processes, realised through the reproduction of different ‘image forms’ manifest as interspersed arrangements of (art) objects and other image components.\n\nThe graphic arts emphasize design, be it in the arts of drawing, painting, engraving, etching, or other print media, from the techniques of producing a single image to the composition of the page, the album, or the book. This volume of Ars Orientalis focuses on how interlocking practices of making, collecting, compiling, and publishing graphic arts across Asia and between regions in Asia and Europe encouraged the replication, and also the subtle transformation, of forms, opening up new possibilities for interpretation. 1 The essays focus specifically on the steady replication of readily identifiable forms-whether portraits, general types of people, flora or fauna, ornament, books or other objects, or even the materials of making themselves, like paper-as well as their production in artist workshops, libraries, and publishing houses and their collection in albums, books, or other compendia. In short, the articles engage with the creation and reception of forms and how they wander. In focusing on the replication of forms, this volume returns to debates that have stimulated scholars for the last century. 2 It does so self-reflexively, seeing these writings as part of the textual discourse that is in dialogue with the visual one under discussion. 3 Yet, the volume aims to add to the existing scholarship by focusing primarily on Asian workshop practices of replication, attending to the processes by which forms moved across cultures and the question of how they were resituated over time, and by interweaving Asian and European historiographies of replication. These essays specifically engage with replicating forms in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In this era, manual and mechanical processes of replication were in use simultaneously within specific cultures as well as across cultures, particularly in commercial ventures. Noticing the intersection of reproductive technologies raises questions not only about production and reception but also about the associations between media and meaning. 4 In addition to inquiries about materiality and processes of production, we find that many of the artists, collectors, and publishers discussed here developed-or perpetuated-taxonomies of form. 5 These forms range from books and objects in Korea to the personification of musical modes in India to the portrayal of exotic foreigners in Ottoman lands and the British visualization of viruses in Sri Lanka. This impulse to classify, and the circulating figures that resulted, urge us to think carefully about the force of forms, both as a creative and a reductive conduit employed to devastating effect by colonial states, among other regimes."
