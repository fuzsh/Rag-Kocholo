the new album actually brings about quite a bit of change: while keeping the trademark structures of the debut, it appears to be less aggressive and straightforward on first listening. generic acid lines are very sparingly used, instead this album is full of audio trickery, washes of noises, sound bits and oppressive atmospheres, emphasizing the industrial aspects of the 13th monkey sound. the opening title ‘korrosionsangriff’ sets the mood for this trip, beneath crackling noises and dark, brooding atmospheres the rhythm clocks in well below 140 bpm. ‘piezo resistance’ is a prime choice for rhythm noise djs, ‘kryophaze’ a superb cut of industrial acid. most tracks are around 145 bpm and superbly bass-heavy, typified amongst others by ‘re:thrilled’, a nice and vaguely ebm-ish example of the more subversive side of the 13th monkey: moody, threatening, full of tension, a track so ultimately urban in sound. towards the end of the cd the band launches two longer tracks: the 10-minute rave bastard ‘sojfu’, sporting surprising breaks and japanese vocal samples, and the epic closing title ‘guenon’: starting with the quasi-rhythmic structures generated by carefully layered noises, before the kickdrum comes in and out time and again over the whole 16 minutes of this standout piece. is there a genre called 'psychedelic gabber' – this is the single-handed invention of it! how about the self-proclaimed objectives of 13th monkey - digital fractures, revolution in the wires? andreas thedens and harm bremer have used their long-term expertise in music production to create an album that reflects various moods and extends beyond themes of aggression and subversion; it also takes a deep look inside and explores the darker realms of the human psyche. yet, there is still plenty crossover appeal that will please fans of rhythm’n’noise and followers of more courageous techno alike. with just two albums, 13th monkey have not only developed a trademark sound, but also proven they can apply plenty of variation to it. welcome back, monkey! price: euro 14,50. available: 02september2k11 MC1R. teutonical visions. cd. mc1r mc1r-13022011 mc1r is a german project founded by nick jonath, producing electronic music since years - ambitious and different.

'auf tauchfahrt' (auphcd004) was exploring the deep sea, followed by their way upon land with 'thorns' (auphcd008). finally the evolving life was musically adapted on 'evolution' (auphcd011). on 'distant travellers' the perception of the listener is now asked to leave earth and dive into space. each of the ten tracks picks up the general atmosphere mandelbrot is known for and moves it at least one or two galaxies further. although inspired by the famous german science fiction pulp magazine series 'perry rhodan', this album is more than a fictional soundtrack. 'distant travellers' is a work of it's own, guiding the listener to calmer but alien journeys as in 'serinoor', 'klingenthal' or 'black vessel'; passing disturbing soundscapes of 'vaaligo' and culminating every now and then in powerful tracks like 'salmengeist' and 'less than zero'. price: euro 12,80. available: 02september2k11 V.A.. re/version 01. cd-r. krater recordings kr05-002 re/version is a series of concerts for ambient, electronic and experimental music in the ruhr area in germany. the compilation 're/version 01' now convene all the bands and projects who played on these events so far: 2kilos &more (von magnet side project), spherical disrupted, phelios, hidden technology and others. the compilation will be released as a professional manufactured cd-r in a edition of 100 copies. price: euro 6,00. available: 02september2k11 DNN. when things stop to move. cd-r. halbsicht hs006 dnn's second album is titled 'when things stop to move'. it is tying in dnns way of music production known from his debut album 'try to feel'. once more his music is characterized by moony sounding melodies combined partly with dynamic and partly with reticent beats. the titles of songs of his debut were playing accomplished with ambiguity and offered freedom of interpretation. not only through the titles of songs the currently released album seems more concrete. the rhythym of each track sound compact and that offers a hautning width for the really well produced soundscapes, textures and melodies. these are accomplished modulated through the use of effects and added layers. with the new album dnn is describing impressively a severe loss without being ambigous. therefore, the new album offers directness which is mirrored within the mood of all tracks. all in all the album is about a heavy theme but it provides an interesting depth. remixes by mike cadoo (bitcrush), steffen schröder (huron) and sebastian ehmke (se). price: euro 13,40. available: now !!! PUNISH YOURSELF / SONIC AREA. phenomedia. cd. audiotrauma trauma019 remember about the old 'united we stand, divided we fall' slogan? punish yourself ('cult movie', 'pink panther party'…) and sonic area ('insensé', 'explore') probably had this in mind when they decided to join forces on a common record. 'phenomedia' is not a classic split-album, or a collection of mutual remixes, but a full fusion of both musical universes - resulting in completely exclusive tracks, going far ahead of anything you would expect. influenced by hint, download, clint mansell, foetus, coil or the downward spiral, but mostly by the hypnotic power of mass media, arco (sonic area’s mastermind) and vx 'cheerleader' (py singer and programmer) tried to break all stylistic boundaries and restrictions, in a merciless attempt to decipher the 'real world' or at least give some aural image of his morbid complexity. dense, nervous, sometimes hard to describe, 'phenomedia' mixes cinematic orchestral atmospheres, dirty hip-hop, tribal industrial techno-punk, brutal wall of sounds, hard-glitch breaks and lush ambient soundscapes – and if you think it’s too much, you’re probably right ! this is a shamelessly noisy freaks parade announcing the 'nightmare before apocalypse' : acid bass lines, explicit tv sampling, screaming saxophones, broken drum machines collapsing into moody organic percussions, melancholic piano arpeggios and cello, distorted blues guitar, suicide lullabies, whispers, incantations, rants… this is hard cut-up music for chaos lovers, topped with broken bits of post-industrial mythology – the roswell alien, kurt cobain, elvis presley, hakim bey, nikola tesla, jim jones, timothy leary, jf kennedy and many more unwilling guests. do you feel like you’ re part of a media-traumatized generation? do you feel addicted to the continuous stroboscopic flow of information, entertainment, spiritual promises and advertisement delivered by tv, the internet, movies, radio? is channel/net-surfing/scanning/hopping your favourite killing-time drug? do you feel like nothing is good enough, real enough, awesome enough for you? how can you spend more than twenty seconds of your precious attention span if this record is just another product of the music industry? who’s the next scapegoat? who’s the next star? who’s the next guru? who’s the next prophet? what’s the next distraction? what’s the next thrill? what’s the next reason to believe in something? should you buy a new laptop? what should you fight for? money? power? disorder? put the remote down and try phenomedia. welcome to one of the most innovative, esoteric, poetic and pessimistic cyberpunk album ever recorded!!! price: euro 13,40. available: again !!!

VROMB. emission pilote. cd. ant-zen act108 oscillating, minimalistic frequencies, rotating sequences and bubbling technoid sounds describe vromb’s special and unique repetitiveness and grant a preview of things to come. note: this is not an album, at the most a few elements extracted here and there from work intended for 'episodes'. nevertheless the important suspense creating factor is always imminent. despite the undeniable magic of monotony there is as well the soundtrack-like, dark science fiction atmosphere contributing immensely to take the listener on a industrial, futuristic trance trip. price: euro 5,00.

AXIOME. ca ne nous rendra pas le congo. cd. ant-zen act116 the firstborn has grown up. and axiome (aka olivier moreau of imminent and performance artist c-drik) developed dramatically. the intense rhythmic straightforward distorted percussion has been put aside and replaced by structured feedbacks, samples and tremendous loops. 'ca ne nous rendra pas le congo' is different - different by all means. here subliminal sounds dominate the scenery - the effort has been put here not on the violence of the tracks, but more on the adequation of the ensembles of sounds. on first sight this is still unstructured, unspoken chaos (the reminder of 'rictus') - here it is uncomfortable ambience overlaid with reduced machine rhythms and schizophrenic metamorphoses. 'ça ne nous rendra pas le congo' generates a hypnotising, trance like atmosphere adding resonant vibrations and looping samples at best to reach a certain state of intensity. axiome’s ability in creating sounds resides in their vicious use of noises to hit your nerves at the most unexpected moments and stimulate your vulnerable brain cells while influencing the palpitating tempo of your tender heart. although 'ça ne nous rendra pas le congo' favours a cold, intense and experimental atmosphere it still hits directly in the centre of mind, body and soul. expect the unexpected ... price: euro 5,00. SYNAPSCAPE. positive pop. cd. ant-zen act117 having gained tremendous experience through various side projects and thus having reached such a high status within the post-industrial scene, synapscape is giving the listener what the listener deserves and of course expects from the state-of-the-art visually as musically artists. 'positive pop' consists of 13 excellent structured tracks ranging from synapscape’s ambience over distorted vocalised tracks, always with a rhythmical touch and a scent of dancefloor. the multi-layered distortions have been put more in the background whereas melodies and rhythm have been given more attention in the foreground - an overall never heard symbiosis of hard, harsh, rhythmical tracks and droning, deranged ambience. not to speak of the incredible production - here, enormous emphasis has been put on and your speakers will be put to a hard test. price: euro 5,00.

'the voices of reason' is not a spoken world album in the common sense - it offers both smooth and happy tunes as well as abstract, experimental soundscapes and beats mingled with the dominating smart voice of thrussell.

VROMB. le tourne-disque. 10\". ant-zen act121.10 after the pulsating soundscapes of the concept album 'episodes' and the electro-acoustic 'first chapter in an electronic opera for ultratonical machines' named 'mémoires paramoléculaire'; between hugo girard's legendary live appearance at the 'mutek' festival in montreal/canada and the 'maschinenfest 02' in aachen/germany, ant-zen presents this nicely designed tourne-disque in two different formats. 'le tourne-disque' is more beat oriented which fits perfectly to vromb's live sets, but it will come as no surprise to those who own vromb's earlier works. girard's music contains minimal electro rhythmic explorations beyond cold atmospheric soundscapes. there are also manipulated voices on this record-hugo girard implements the spoken words of his infant relatives frédérique and philippe. an excellent addition to the previous vromb releases and it is limited - so don't miss it...! price: euro 5,00. MONOKROM. monokrom. 12\" lp. ant-zen act122 dark atmospheres aggravate to cold, sheer fear; the ultimate threat. massive beats, torn to shreds by metal splinters, subfrequent sequences, metallic echoing, herald the advance of an inorganic intelligence without hurry, though victory is near. the sound of machines flows into noise. distorted beats are hailing down like a storm. mercilessly tormenting and mistreating. the embodiment of numb. price: euro 5,00.

NOOSA HEDZ. hoola hopz. 10\". ant-zen act124 what originally started as a collaboration in 1999 between celluloid mata and ultra milkmaids, later evolved into a project entitled noosa hedz. hoola hopz is the title of their first release under that name. the five tracks on this 10\" generate a chilling psychedelic mood with constantly changing loops that are supplemented with noise clicks and minimal rhythm dots.this is the finest in electronica. limited 509 copies. price: euro 5,00. CELLULOID MATA. spectrum. 2cd. ant-zen act125 ‘spectrum’ is a dossier of tracks, which are hard to find. all of the cd tracks of this double set (and most of the vinyls) are not available anymore. instead of a re-release of all lost items, this is the essence of the past. ‘spectrum’ covers all parts of mata – diversification and variation with satisfaction guaranteed. you won’t find a single ‘sable’ track in this package! the direction of cd1 is focussed on heavily distorted rhythms that are monotonous, minimal, and repetitive. however, you can always hear mata’s experience in the building up of an electrified analog beat in concert with the unique elements of a track or of a song. listen to ‘the council’ featuring sheila mata’s voice and you will understand mata’s craftiness. this cd ends with an unreleased remix by two ant-zen artists which lead the listener to the non-rhythmic soundscapes of cd2. these soundscapes illustrate mata’s melodic direction with the use of disturbing mostly non-distorted rhythm-loops that are overlayed with harmonious passages. ‘trinity test ’ is a good example of the genres ‘rhythm industrial’ and ‘ambient’ overlapping perfectly. once again you can hear sheila mata on ‘the cyborg’ - threatening indeed. the very end is strictly rhythm – just before you drift into bliss... or start again with cd1. price: euro 5,00. ROB(U)RANG. & friends. cd-ep. ant-zen act127 following his first album on noise museum and some collaborations, uncle rob(u)rang is yet again redefining the pumped stomp of nature with a bunch of old-fashioned rhythm-boxes and faulty synths.he is helped by some of his good friends: m. medea (silk saw), imminent, dr. john (for the metarc engineering) and the hash hash little robot. experienced nursery rhymes for an ethnic group to come. price: euro 5,00. L'OMBRE. medicine for the meaningless. cd. ant-zen act129 ant-zen proudly presents the phantastic debut album of this artist. what l'ombre's works are about: atmosphere. hypnotizing ambient soundscapes that makes you want to listen and feel. let yourself go, drift away into a haze of images and scenes. the mood of this record can be described as 'icy ambience'. cold drones meld perfectly with sounds of electronic and even acoustic instruments. watch the northern lights while listening - if you can't, just close your eyes, then you will see... 'medicine for the meaningless' can be described as a fascinating, imagined soundtrack with a great variety. listeners who chill out will find themselves drawn happily into the details upon repeated listenings. highly recommended. price: euro 5,00. TELEROTOR. modern times. cd. ant-zen act130 modern times' continues telepherique's conceptual work - creating music on and about basic topics. 'modern times' is about today's working situations, stress, machines overthrowing men and time. 'modern times' was recorded by direct interaction between telepherique and roger rotor. despite the convenient 'internet collaborations' that are possible they preferred to record the disc 'live'. today's merciless rhythm of work and daily life is audible.factory work and disco enjoyment is melting together. no pause,no silence - just hypnotising four-to-the-floor polyrhythmic heart-beats. if you live a '24/7 life' you will recognize the strictness of these never-ending dance-tracks. price: euro 5,00. HYPNOSKULL. operation tough guy!. cd. ant-zen act134 hypnoskull's fourth album in a row on ant-zen, 'operation tough guy [ready to scream, ready to die!]' is again a hard clash between new influences of several contemporary dance styles and the hard side of underground industrial electronics. the project continues with the aim to create a new form of dance music without a compromise, controversial as hell and to-the-point. hypnoskull tracks are like dark, scary movies full of urban tragedy and fast beats; they represent a life on the fast track. that is probably why urban scenes all over the world incorporate this unique sound in their daily sceneries. live sets are remarkable: unstoppable rhythm-machines like bulldozers over your head. virtual fights and continuously repeating samples and loops create a scary, wild atmosphere. the atmosphere nobody wants to feel in reality - but what is reality anyway? a vicious game of putting things in a row, in a scene. confront yourself with the harsh reality of everyday life and get the perfect soundtrack to it. price: euro 5,00. HYPNOSKULL. operation tough guy!. 2x12\" lp. ant-zen act134.1 the double 12\" set contains excerpts from the operation tough guy! cd and songs from the previous hypnoskull ant-zen releases. limited edition. price: euro 5,00. SYNAPSCAPE. raw. cd. ant-zen act137 those who are familiar with ant-zen know that synapscape (aka tim kniep and philipp münch) needs no introduction. their debut was the very first ant-zen cd (released back in 1995) and we are glad that they have stuck by the label. synapscape's unique usage of heavy polyrhythms, ambient soundscapes, slight dub influences, mysterious vocals and astonishing live appearances has made fans all over the world. 'raw' is the fifth full length synapscape release. it contains a variety of works that they did between 1994 and 2001 - most tracks have ever been released before. you will agree that it was worth making these tracks available to the public. this cd also contains three long-deleted compilation tracks that up until now could only be heard by a few people. so, 'raw' is the perfect witness that bielefeld exists - check it out! price: euro 5,00. AMBRE. le mensonge. cd. ant-zen act140 ambre's second full length release explores a new direction in sound - this will be especially evident for those who are familiar with 'enclave'. however, there are still no rhythms in this aural universe, but it is still mighty cold and extremely dark in there. even in this cold and dark place, life forms (creatures, not machines) are created. you can hear them celebrating their rituals, you can hear them talk and you can hear them sending greetings to zoviet france's parallel universe (perhaps even a small postcard is sent to pierre schaeffer). but you can never hear them dance - never. these strange life forms don't need a purpose for what they do. do you need a purpose to exist? either do they. what do you mean... it's all a lie? turn up your stereo. put on your headphones. turn off the lights. believe. this cd comes in a folded embossed heavy cardboard cover. price: euro 5,00.

L'OMBRE. simulations 1.0. cd. ant-zen act149 an artist has 10 to 20 years to make his first album and one year for the second one. if a debut is accepted by listeners and reviewers then it has an effect on the artist's future work. expectations aren't easy to ignore and there are only a few musicians who won't be influenced by these reactions. there are three directions an artist can pursue with a follow-up: walk the same path as they did on the first record, change the style radically or use the fundamentals of the debut as a basis for exploration into new spheres. stephen sawyer a.k.a. l'ombre has chosen the third direction. the mixture of electronic and acoustic sources that lead into mellow, floating soundscapes is sawyer's trademark. that trademark is present on this new record, but it is not a re-hash of older ideas. the first surprising change on “simulations 1.0” is the mood of the ten tracks; the temperature seems to have risen a bit – especially when the release is compared to the icy and colder atmosphere of 'medicine...'. just listen to the piano on 'nowhere' and then to the floating vibraphone on 'interlocution' to feel the difference. in addition l'ombre has also strengthened his rhythms. the pulsating patterns/slight breakbeats intensify the soundscapes and melodies - in short, they complete them. 'facsimile' and 'these whispers' are examples of this unique blend - if you removed the rhythm then the fragile tissue would fall apart. perhaps, this music is no longer suitable for watching the northern lights but if you listen to this record late at night, you might see previously unseen stars in the clear black sky. once again, the description of “an imagined soundtrack” fits perfectly. this cd comes in special paper packaging with embossing. price: euro 5,00. INDIVIDUAL. 180 bullets per man. cd. ant-zen act153 the open minded listener knows marc medea as one half of the belgian duo, silk saw and now the listener will also know marc medea as the man behind individual. individual, medeas solo project, debuted on ant-zen with his appearance on the 'daruma' compilation’. the compilation featured the short version of '180 bullets per man' - the title track of individual's first album, also presented by the antz. medea's definition of this album: 'an abstract battlefield combining subbasses & furious rhthms, low wavelengths & sharp metals, dry kicks & pricks. declined in multiple layers of sonic masses, from the slowest organic mood to the fastest cold grinding, these resonating terrorbeats have to be understood as a refusal of all compromises and the expression of a methodic anger.' individual's focus is that of using rhythmic patterns to create a psychic (or even maybe a psychotic) mood - if you are willing and able to discover this listening experience then you will find yourself trapped in a complex building of rhythms and drones. '180 bullets per man' is a subliminal war against your aural senses. price: euro 5,00. BRIAN EVENSON / XINGU HILL / TAMARIN. altmann's tongue. cd. ant-zen act159 upon the circulation of his first short story collection, altmann’s tongue (knopf, 1994), author and professor brian evenson found himself out of favor with his spiritual home ground, the church of jesus christ of latter day saints - the mormon church. since that time, evenson’s incisive, acerbic writing about the medieval brutality of contemporary humanity has gone on to garner significant praise, and not a few distinctions. the creation of altmann’s tongue - which features brian evenson reading selections from several books through a sonic fabric created by xingu hill and tamarin - proved to be similarly cataclysmic, although of markedly different scale. on the surface, altmann’s tongue appears to be a simple spoken word project backed by experimental sound design and post-industrial ambience of a distinctly harrowing nature. however, brian evenson’s readings, recorded in an impromptu fashion in a sparse white apartment, begat an intensity of emotion that compelled xingu hill and tamarin to work for over three years on musical reactions that could equal the sentiment of evenson’s recordings. musical reactions, ranging from morose synth rhythms to enigmatic drones. evenson’s verbal recordings and the music feed upon themselves like the ouroboros, like the snake which grows by eating itself. ant-zen is proud to present altmann’s tongue as a unique, compelling collaboration between a thought-provoking author and two exceptional sound experimentalists. packaging: jewelcase w/ 16p booklet (special paper). price: euro 5,00. SZKIEVE. ékranoplanes. 3\" cd. ant-zen act173 szkieve is dimitri della faille who founded the project in 1998. besides several szkieve releases, dimitri has also collaborated with martiens go home and vromb, and made a split-vinyl with ammo. szkieve's music is made of intense and complex compositions that assemble rich textures and expansive sounds. this is then combined with chords, string melodies and high-pitched synthetic tones. szkieve's sound explorations could be described as 'scientific', comparable to the works of modern electronic composers. but instead of 'dry, academic experiments’, szkieve transforms moods into music and the result is quite unusual for this genre. 'ékranoplanes' is a concept work: because they require huge amount of resources and money, science and technologies have always been at the mercy of politics. this mini cd is a study of a lost technology of the former soviet union. that is, the futuristic vision of one man confronted by the needs of a country engaged in a battle for the world. ékranoplanes are the platypus of transportation, they are both planes and boats or something entirely else. these incredible monsters of steel and oil broke the waves of the caspian sea while intelligence around the world were still trying to figure out what they were. made of tons of rivets, motors and grey matter - those having the chance to spot such a special animal never forgot the sound of its metal bouncing on water or its wings cutting the air. with this release, szkieve renders the grandeur of this forgotten technology and pays a tribute to the developments of modern science. packaging: 3\"cd-digipak. price: euro 5,00.

STARFISH POOL. illusions of move - chapter red. 12\" lp. hymen ¥029 starfish pool is the electronic project of koen lybaert. it's an electronic project where rhythm will appear in, in all its aspects. since the very start it is the manipulation of loops - the basic idea of the way tracks were created as starfish pool. this concept that has nothing to do with the sound but more with the way that tracks are practically made. the illusions of move cycle is an idea that started end at the end of 1999. it all comes to colours. the first one called blue, the colour that reflects on sadness and dark feelings. blue reflects these feelings, so it was the right choice to start with the chapter blue as introducing this new cycle. the other four albums will be chapter red, black, white and yellow. red will go around passion, black will be heavy but soulful, white very open and minimal, and yellow bright. that's the general idea. these releases are planned within a time-period of two years. a mixture of dark ambient soundscapes, hypnotic drum patterns, an impressive stylistic range, emotional minimalism and timbral sophistication. harsh sound-structures unfold a new chapter for smooth atmospheric noise. the passion is red. price: euro 5,00. LUSINE ICL. slipthrough ep. 12\" lp. hymen ¥031 lusine icl explores different styles of electronica such as dark-ambient, minimal music and idm, but doesn't limit himself to these genres…actually there is no limit. the tracks become a trip that stands far beyond the average electronic outputs from the u.s. jeff mcilwain now resides in los angeles, where he has been for two years. he originally started making music about 5 years ago in austin, tx. where he received much of his musical influence. the music is much more acoustically involved, although highly manipulated electronically. much of the credit for the recent change in direction should be given to the faculty at calarts, including mark trayle and tom erbe who have been in the electronic music scene for a very long time. in fact, his way of producing is just amazing. the tracks begin with a soundscape blending into another and at the end of it you won`t know how the record began. this is performed with such a perfection that it won`t disturb in any case. price: euro 5,00.

'augmented lines' is actually the 2nd cd release of the somatix brothers and the follower of the cd 'circumflex' on hymen two years ago. they mix rotary beats form rhythmic regularity, dense waves of electronics with layers of little blips & breaks and turns of melody. twisted drum&bass layers are filled up with abrasive crashes and exploding substances. an unidentified atmospheric spike of subtle piercings or just a calculated assault of an sonic weapon. price: euro 5,00. SUBSTANZ-T. tripped experiences. cd. hymen ¥714 after several years of silence, the sound perfectionists substanz t from frankfurt finally present their 3rd album. with this release they move one step forward into an stereophonic universe of smoth break beats and trip hop, covered with urban ambient soundscapes and hypnotising melodies. tripped experience is a soul inflected unreal landscape of slow-motion cyber vibrations - leaded, disrupted and broken with stirring basslines & breaks. the journey continues on with rhythmic trance themes adding touches of and drum'n'bass elements that dirge forward with immense dark demand of detail. those details - dreamed voices, slow glacier melodies - low drones flows in a beautiful manner. a collection of awesome dreamscapes perfumed by the shadowplay of dance polyrythms, warm synthesizer pulses, and spoken, sung and atmospherically implied snapshots of life in the global urban jungle. every tune is very carefully created and integrate itself very well in an orchestra of percussions and slow analog progressions and additionally enriched by the vocals of christophe demarthe, astrid köpfler, mc ronin, iris orasjärvi. gentle floating electronic structures. you knew substanz t - you never know... price: euro 5,00. STARFISH POOL. illusions of move - the golden cycle. cd. hymen ¥715 from driven ambient to minimal techno or breakbeat. a imaginary soundtrack with sweet female vocals and realistic soundrecordings taken from the streets of mexico city and new york. starfish pool’s new release proves to be something of its own kind full of enjoyable and intelligent music. complex and soulful, this changing mood style can take our feelings and mind into sad, joyfull or dark atmospheres. with a general urban feeling worked out in an intelligent way. the final step so far of starfish pool’s work and something which fits well with the very high quality of the hymen releases. price: euro 5,00. XINGU HILL / SQUAREMETER. this anxious space. cd. hymen ¥717 xhm2 is collaboration between xingu hill and squaremeter (panacea). it's a perfect melting of squaremeter's cinematic atmospheres and the abstract sci-fi feeling of xingu hill - it's calm but very intense and full of atmospheric click & cut electronics. price: euro 5,00. NEUTRAL. motion of. cd. hymen ¥718 on her second neutral album, nicole elmer tosses her industrial penchants aside for a more piercing look into the eyes of her creative muse. the result is a breath-taking dark pop departure. 'motion of' is slow brooding emotion that contains fierce electronic punches, which glisten with introspective guitar and meandering vocal delivery. fans and magazines often praise neutral as both electronic and post-industrial. however, there's too much twangy electro and dolorous ambient funk on 'motion of' to keep her straddling those genre fences. 'motion of' is the music of mysterious dreams and lonely moments of thought. price: euro 5,00. V.A.. masonic. 2cd. hymen ¥719 five years of hymen records - we think this anniversary should be celebrated with a 'bang'! so for the listeners and the collectors, hymen records present this compilation featuring m2, neutral, dead hollywood stars, beefcake, lusine icl, funkstörung, imminent, baracuda, scorn, venetian snares, frz & blue baboon & etereo expandeum club, fourplay, solar-x, sonic dragolgo, gridlock, xingu hill, lilienthal, bochum welt, substanz-t, starfish pool, noosa hedz, somatic responses, xanopticon, k_chiko, red sparrow, llips., trifid project, end, so fuckin' jazz and fanny. enjoy mostly unreleased tracks by hymen- and hymen-related artists. price: euro 5,00. SOMATIC RESPONSES. touching the void. cd. hymen ¥723 this is the third strike of the welsh healy brothers on hymen. they continue their electronic assaults on the open-minded idm generation. their sound mixes noisy rhythms, broken drum'n'bass beats and complex-structured layers with melodic lines while touching the void between 'tech' and 'industrial'. it seems that john and paul healy's creative output is bigger than whales - you get 70+ minutes on the cd version and you will enjoy every second of it! price: euro 5,00. SUBSTANZ-T. electric opium. cd. hymen ¥729 frankfurt’s arne stevens and alex lange of substanz-t return after a 2-year span to release one of hymen records’ most immediately accessible albums, electric opium. all the traits you know and love about substanz-t are in-tact: down tempo beats, industrial funk rhythms, and precision soundscape creation. yet electric opium, substanz-t’s 4th album, comes from a much shinier place than their 2001 release, tripped experiences. electric opium bursts forth with bright soul and a vibrant sound stewed in urban lounge dynamics - where you’re as likely to get an earful of tight hip-hop rhymes as you are a hallucination inducing melody. it would be easy to say that these changes stem from stevens and lange working with mc’s sisco and ronin (who appears on megashira and panacea releases), as well as the legendary f. m. einheit of german noise guitar experimentalists einstuerzende neubauten. but that’s not it at all; electric opium’s the next generation of electronic sound to emerge from the new urban experience. put simply, electric opium is proof that substanz-t is the future of urban electronic sound. price: euro 5,00. SNOG. beyond the valley of the proles. cd. hymen ¥730 david thrussell’s snog project has always been a meme complex - a series of critical cultural concepts that suggest an alternative worldview is necessary. yet the composition of its payload has shifted into a far more seductive form than it’s ever been before. once a harsh, post-industrial harbinger of the western world’s cultural and economic imperialism, snog is now simply western. sorta. beyond the valley of the proles leverages the anthemic sagas of johnny cash, roger miller and johnny horton - the hard-strummed western epics of the 1950s - in turning out superb moments of social commentary on a post-pop chassis. in crafting an entire album of richly detailed western ambient and broken beat grooves, snog has raised the bar far above the confrontational, one-dimensional message music of consolidated or the sample-collage and noise terrorism of the beta bodega label. beyond the valley of the proles is electro-western manna for progressive political consciousness. why snog is now all western and not the ebm or machine noise of the excellent 1999 album, third mall from the sun, is a long story, says thrussell. 'the short answer is that beyond is where i'm at right now. i don't want any distance; i want the ‘message’ upfront - clothed with some sincere attempt at emotion and communication.' the message of beyond the valley of the proles is if nothing else a smoldering bitterness about the deplorable state of popular and socio-corporate culture. thrussell plies his maple-coated baritone voice - akin to leonard cohen, the the’s matt johnson, or even the church’s steve kilbey - over jangling western melodies and crisp percussion to decry mass consumption ('fill my hole') and soul-crushing careerism ('businessman'). 'the master,' with its strident low guitar and cavernous electronic ambience, will make you feel like you’re in the front row of hell’s main theater with johnny cash as the opening act. as on previous snog albums, there’s one gem that always stands out, and on beyond the valley of the proles it’s the stunning 'into the light,' an eloquent revelation of what happens when modern society’s macabre machinations transmogrify human compassion into zealous terrorism and mass violence. to be sure, beyond the valley of the proles is pure snog: insightful odes with a healthy dose of humor to go along with the cultural criticism. beyond the valley of the proles is therefore the quintessential snog album - if not for the music than at least for its name. 'a friend of mine said it was the best title for the album because he thinks i'm pretty much a cross between george orwell and an anarchic russ meyer,' says thrussell with no small amount of glee, 'which i took as a supreme compliment.' price: euro 5,00. VENETIAN SNARES / HECATE. nymphomatriarch. cd. hymen ¥731 hecate’s rachael kozak has a thing with collaborations. she paired up earlier this year with lustmord’s brian williams on law of the battle of conquest, a visceral, percussive revision of lustmord’s drone aesthetic. now she’s shacking up with venetian snares’ aaron funk. literally. nymphomatriarch, a joint project between venetian snares and hecate, is 100% composed of sounds the duo made having sex together. but it’s not porno music. nymphomatriarch is cutting-edge drill beats and raucous noise that puts your ears in a vice. the tempestuous breaks venetian snares is known for spiral down to the very pits of hell and back thanks to hecate’s visceral atmospheric treatments, returning as mordant sound meant to corrode the soul. nymphomatriarch bristles with the crisp signature of traditional breakcore dynamics, yet unlike many albums in the genre, nymphomatriarch retains a sense of complex ambient sound and depth throughout its six tracks - this isn’t just another manic break record composed entirely on a hard drive. in other words, it’s everything you’d expect from a collaboration between venetian snares and hecate. nymphomatriarch just happens to be made from sex sounds. like matmos or ming + fs, nymphomatriarch manipulates conventional found sound into musical themes. but unlike matmos, who recorded plastic surgery sounds for their album a chance to cut is a chance to cure, or ming + fs sampling car doors, windshield wipers, and slamming trunks to produce music for a nissan commercial, nymphomatriarch employs the noise of anal and oral sex, straightforward copulation, 'microphone insertion' and other privately recorded debaucheries committed while venetian snares and hecate were on tour together in europe and canada last year. those snapping high-hats running throughout 'blood on the rope?' ass slaps torqued and looped like madness. the whizzing black noise of 'input' and 'outlet?' zippers ripping open and clothes flying off. the fiendish cries and murky ambience overshadowing 'amaurophilia' and 'hymen tramp choir?' just think about it for a second… or maybe not, suggests kozak when asked about the inevitable hype building up around nymphomatriarch. 'at this point i don't care how or what people think of the album, we made it for ourselves really, a kind of personal investigation,' she says. 'obviously people get hung up on the idea of it, but i think when they actually listen to the record it will be another story.' price: euro 5,00.

NEUTRAL. caller id. cd. hymen ¥733 neutral’s nicole elmer is back with a captivating remix album, caller id. less than a year after she redefined her sound from laptop industrial to a rich hybrid of acoustic instrumentation and intelligent pop lyricism on her album motion of, neutral’s brought in some of the best and brightest in modern electronic music to have a go at her back catalog. remixers include ant-zen and hymen’s well-known noise arbiters xingu hill, p•a•l, and telepherique as well as newcomers like the cinematically-driven end. and since caller id, like motion of, is a joint release with mad monkey records, it seemed fitting to bring in mad monkey labelmates burning rome and chango-feo for this finale. rounding out the remixer list are oregon’s best-kept electro twiddling secret solenoid and famed digital break stylists gridlock. but caller id isn’t just remixes. fans of her music will find four unreleased tracks woven into the release, adding a cohesiveness to caller id that makes it more than a simple collection of diverse remixes. caller id feels like a new album, much like mad monkey’s first release - on which neutral appears - the legendary enter the monkey compilation. fittingly, caller id closes the loop for neutral and her first creative incarnation, while paving the way for what’s next for both nicole elmer and mad monkey records. price: euro 5,00. HECATE. seven veils of silence. cd. hymen ¥739 salome had heard the music for some time now, hecate’s seven veils of silence. the haunting dulcimer sounds of the santur in '1st veil - desert capture' began to move through her after her mother, herodias, sliced the flaccid tongue of john as it sat on the silver salver, the rhythm turning martial and full of cymbal brashness in 'nest of vipers.' the baleful sound of 'houris’ hours' and '3rd veil - salome’s command' remained vague like a metallic ambience, a remembrance of her lascivious cavorting for herod, gyrating and thrusting with wickedness for him as the undulating pulse of 'premordial dance' eased through her consciousness. the sounds had followed her throughout her life, even to her death in the frozen river sikoris, her own head rent from its body by shards of ice. as she watched her arms writhe below the frozen river, the alarming chime cries and woeful clashing static clacking of 'all night' gave way to the shrouded percussion and wandering lyrical melody of a ney flute in 'desecration of the baptist.' even when her severed head reeled down the pitched ice to the bank of the sikoris, the desolate winter landscape tumbling through her eyes, salome sensed only the strange echoing ney, the staccato pounding of a rumbling daf drum of 'black as silence' and '7th veil - overwhelming lacerations.' hecate’s seven veils of silence is salome’s only comfort in the underworld, rendering useless those eyes which had once glowered at the beheading of john the baptist. price: euro 5,00. SOMATIC RESPONSES. pounded mass. cd. hymen ¥741 for those rubberheads who consider somatic responses to be idm - thanks in part to their melodically brilliant 2002 album for hymen, touching the void - take heart: pounded mass stylistically name checks your idm and experimental electronic icons like aphex twin, squarepusher, and lee norris. somatic responses’ john healy and paul healy also have a message for these folks: rethink that tag. pounded mass is one acerbic noise assault after another, the kind that will make most fans of twee synth tunes soil themselves. 'we've taken a harder stance for this lp, as the title suggests,' says john. 'i think that we were categorized as idm for a bit, which we never really understood…so we've applied a few good measures of distortion, et cetera to this release. there's much more of a mixed bag in this release…' on the tripadelic 'bathrobe brawl v1,' somatic responses infuse the psychotic turntablist scratching effervescence of dj spooky with breaks and bass worthy of a depth charge or dj shadow cut. one track later, on 'go off,' the welsh brothers healy crank up the somatic responses style of electro-mechano breakcore ferocity that would otherwise plant pounded mass firmly in the realm of xanopticon or orphx. then there’s the aptly-titled 'the day idm crawled up its own arse,' which john says is 'a simple statement of what we think of the elitist and good old-fashioned cock-head idm producers.' hymen sincerely hopes you 'feel the love' on somatic responses’ pounded mass. price: euro 5,00. SNOG. real estate man plus. cd. hymen ¥743 david thrussell's career here takes a new turn and rises to a new high. ten strikingly different versions of the one song might seem excessive to some, but once heard you'll agree that each interpretation brings a refreshing new vigour to this cherished classic. in these fireside and dancefloor favourites there is a gentle, convincing persuasiveness about every rendition. the approach here is so totally, unaffectedly sincere you can't help but feel your whole inner being is touched. real estate man is no doubt well enough known to you that you have probably been able to hum the melody since you were a child. yet in this presentation, each version is revealed in an entirely new light...so much more meaningful that it's almost as though you had never really heard the song before: a pure electro assault. packaging: jewelcase cd. price: euro 5,00. END. the sick generation. cd. hymen ¥744 charles pierce strikes again. this album goes far beyond his previous full length release 'the sounds of disaster', adding fresh remixer’s blood and exciting stylistic variations to end's remember-the-sixties-easy-listening-electrock'n'roll-bastardazation. a marvellous aural rollercoaster ride of twanging guitars, scratches, soul horn blasts, surf sound, hecq, the trashmen, clicks, orchestral strings, cuts, breakcore, a progressive rock organ, heavy john-bonham-like drums, rap vocals, mad ep, a sitar, ambient synth strikes, donna summer, reggae beats, duran duran duran, shredded vocals, a wah-wah trumpet, drop the lime, swans, a canned foetus, the real one and only foetus himself and a knife for mrs. miller in nearly sixty minutes! just imagine the great russ meyer (if he was still with us) planning a new masterpiece by the name of 'the sick generation': this might be the soundtrack.

DEAD HOLLYWOOD STARS. smoke and mirrors. cd-ep. hymen ¥745 three years after their critically acclaimed second album, junctions, dead hollywood stars are back with a brand new record - exploring once again a different facet of their twisted american dream. admirers of the previous two albums will be in familiar territory, a feeling reinforced by the omnipresence of the slide guitars, ghostly melodies and the unique combination of acoustic with electronic elements. but smoke and mirrors quietly leaves the 'desert ambient' of gone west (2000) and the more cinematographic realm of junctions (2002), so that it can dig deeper. more song based and acoustic than before, delicately crafted, and yet disturbing, smoke and mirrors opens a new door to the odd universe of dead hollywood stars. a place where dusty slide guitars meet mysterious trumpets, 60's exotica infects old-school electronic pulses, and where the shadows of badalamenti and morricone are always near. a clash of spectral jazz, ambient americana, spooky boogie and psychotronic pop... smoke and mirrors looks behind the curtain, searches for the blurry, mysterious and sometimes ominous world hidden under the familiar appearances. each track is a little vignette, an open story, a scene of a long-lost script. it could be the soundtrack to charles burns' black hole series or to a fevered night in a lost motel (the night country); a gentle drive under a pastel sky or a wrong turn leading to an orwellian nightmare (ocean drive, 1984); a strange reception in the dead of night, or simply corporate business as usual (masquerade); a pleasant afternoon with a quiet golf player - but isn't there a hint of madness in his eyes? (tea with mr. yi). magic, tricks, lies - a multi-faceted world of wonders that dead hollywood stars reveals through the six tracks of this ep, presented in a beautiful 3\" cd embedded in a clear 5\" disc. packaging: partly metallized 5\"cd in slimline-case price: euro 5,00.

MAD EP. not afraid of spiders. cd. hymen ¥751 new york based mad ep (aka iowa native matthew peters) began studying the cello at age 8 and music theory, composition, and improvisation at age 14. while finishing his undergraduate degree at northwestern university in cello performance, he interned at wfmt and became the youngest person to produce the chicago symphony orchestra radio broadcasts in their history. after two seasons, matthew decided to study sound recording and digital media at mcgill university in montreal. since returning to the united states, he has worked as a freelance sound designer for corporate and academic webmedia projects, scored experimental theatre productions, and was a classical booking agent. matthew's musical training can be recognised during every note played on 'not afraid of spiders'. the variety of styles - from hip hop, to a treated flamenco guitar on the four-to-the-floorburner 'velvet pudding mold', to jazzy moods (indeed 'nicoffeine' seems like miles davis' agharta-period transformed into 2006 breakbeat madness - and '60202 strut' represents the we-want-miles period) - never sounds eclectic; it's the result of a logical process being a creative artist, and that's what mad ep really is. as on his previous album 'eating movies', there are many guest appearances: mc equivalant, charles peirce (end), flutist/saxophonist scott lamberty (giving a brilliant hubert-laws-feel on 'stealing your last breath’), mochipet, chaonaut, marlowe, the manhattan gimp project, bryce beverlin II, and david young. on this cd, all these different influences and artists became a unit - a conclusion of mad ep’s composition skills. we are proud to present matthew's first full-length, hymen records' release - a fresh, unique, contemporary work of art. highly recommended. price: euro 5,00.

FANNY. revelry and decadence as the right of slaves. cd. mirex c2 fraser runciman (a.k.a. fanny) has struck again with his second cd. previously, he has released cdr-s, vinyls (on labels such as zod records and widerstand.org) and a full length debut cd on mirex. this debut full length, 'fear and loathing for dummies', was the cd version of the zod 12\" plus new material. however, 'revelry and decadence...' is all new material - another attack of ultra-fast break beat clashes that are mixed with odd samples and grinding bass power. fanny's “take it or leave it” attitude is also visualized - if you can stand the cover then you won't have any problem with the sound. this record at the right volume feels like a kenworth truck running through your wide open mouth into your throat – glory!! special plastic sleeve packaging. price: euro 5,00. V.A.. carbon. cd. mirex c3 you hear the knock on the door. your hands start sweating. your pulse shoots up, blood pumping so hard into the back of your eyes they begin to bulge out of their sockets. the door flies open, and your worst nightmare comes whirling into your living room, shrieking like a tornado, smashing and tossing everything that isn’t nailed to the floor. almost three years old, mirex is here to terrorize you with ultrasonic horror music that’s fast, furious, and out of control like a toddler on crack. that’s right, his name is carbon, and he’s just woken up from a nice nap and ready to wreak havoc on your ears. carbon’s first escapade is to have blaerg ingeniously disassemble one of the 20th century’s most memorable - and haunting - thriller soundtrack themes, bernard herrmann’s psycho soundtrack, and thoroughly infuse it with cleaver-sharp amen breaks and a touch of mother bates’ noise. not to be outdone by first-timer blaerg’s 'shower scene,' hecate roars forth on 'devil whore' with a throng of chanting demons, a grinding guitar, mechano-bass pummeling from hell. xanopticon brings the pain on 'ex nihilo' with a needle bouquet of slivered aphex twin tracks, while donna summer slobbers breaks, guitar pieces, and hip-hop flava all over your hardwood floors on 'drieze cassette.' carbon is not all raw, unleashed terror, as evidenced by calmer moments like line 47\"s 'taken away,' its tense power breaks soothed long lullaby synth themes and a heavy dose of ambience. but lest that lull you into a false sense of hope, carbon throws down a doozie of a fit, dev/null’s appropriately titled, 'no, seriously, i’m like, wicked, evil and shit…' when you get to end’s morricone-styled spy theme, 'you only live once,' your ears will be praying for the van gogh treatment. just be thankful that mirex will never be three again, and that carbon comes to visit only when you want him to! feat: blaerg, hecate, subskan, xanopticon, undacova, drop the lime, ove-naxx, donna summer, sickboy, line 47, dev/null, xingu hill, fanny, terminal11, kaebin yield, axiome, enduser, duran duran duran, sedarka, end. special plastic sleeve packaging. price: euro 5,00. SUBSKAN. repaired. cd. mirex c5 besides reports about live and dj activities, there isn’t much information to be found on subskan mastermind jean-marc. there were rumors about him working in a factory and using pure industrial samples for his artistic work. listening to 'repairs' might validate the truth of these rumours. we do know that this is his second release. 'repaired' could be seen as the transformation of a regular work day into music. starting with drony, abstract soundscapes, followed by the addition of embedded beats, reaching the climax with drum-and-bass/breakcore beats (and don't forget the faded lovely string synths and voices - just as the muzak played in some factories keeps the workers productive) and finally concluding with a mellow melodic tune - closing time. despite the fact that industrial work is mostly monotonous, there is a lot of variety in this album's music. there is a constant flow from track to track; leading the listener through ambient spaces to hard-driving rhythmic madnesses. don't miss this one - and enjoy your work ! special plastic sleeve packaging. price: euro 5,00. DROP THE LIME. step it up. 12\". mirex c7 luca venezia, a. k. a. drop the lime, is reigning badass among the likes of kid606, knifehandchop, and other digital cut-up artists ripping up the back catalogs of early dance music imprints like xl and suburban base - taking wicked samples from the heyday of rave culture and other sources, cracking them wide open, and pouring everything from industrial noise to acid breaks into the mix. venezia has been musically inclined since youth, made mixtapes in elementary school and going bananas when rave broke in the us in the early 90s. now based in williamsburg, venezia pushes the boundaries of breakcore with the humor and sarcasm that went hand-in-hand to create rave and early techno’s dark side, playing up the seedy underside of an originally urban music that was as much a reality-check as it was drug-fueled escapism. previous drop the lime releases on tigerbeat6, dreadpower/electroviolence, shockout, broklyn beats and ambush have garnered intense press scrutiny in the last year, but no one’s prepared for the break madness on step it up. from the lead-off title track, which begins with the synth choir sounds from either 'blue monday' or underworld’s 'dark train' (we’re not sure which it is and venezia’s not about to tell us), step it up barrels through six tracks of ricockulous, unrelenting break layering and sampling mash-up. on 'clockman,' the vibe is very much in tune with 4hero’s dark raver anthem, 'mr. cook’s nightmare,' peering through mournful female cries and bleepy lfo notes to roar on with a raucous ragga bass pulse. the tone gets even more morose on 'lost bklyn,' where classic spiraling d’n ’b bass tones get a menacing industrial treatment, or on 'bullyhead,' which out does the horrific minor chord tones of that seminal kemical kids white label from 1993. step it up is nothing less than a red glowing poker in your brain; drop the lime recklessly cauterizes the memory of happy hardcore with speedhall heat. price: euro 5,00. SICKBOY. into oblivion. cd. mirex c9 bernard had been buying mirex releases since the very first, somatic responses’ tlooz 7-inch, back in 2001. since that time bernard made sure to save his money so that every few months, when mirex unleashed another one of its limited-release experimental break records, he’d be sure to be the first to get one. bernard had heard of sickboy’s incredibly twisted breakcore releases on death$ucker and peace off, so he was especially excited to pick up mirex’ newest release, sickboy’s into oblivion. but after just one listen to into oblivion, there would be no point in bernard buying any more records. upon the first few sick notes of into oblivion’s first cut, 'owleybass,' bernard began to feel a burning sensation in his ears; the lumbering macabre bass line and frenetic break-splicing was scrambling his senses—more than the usual dj scud or phthalocyanine 12-inch. it starting as a mild itch in his ear canal that progressed to an intense heat that, by the time 'heart' blared through the speakers with its carefully mutated amen intensity, began twisting bernard’s sense of reality into a devilish, mutinous auger, cleaving its way into his frontal lobe first. blood trickled out of his nose and puss from his eyelids under the pressure of the raucous 'spiral formation' and 'nomadic hunters,' which sounded to bernard a little like the industrial d’n’b that panacea had pioneered nearly a decade ago, but was far beyond anything he’d ever heard from mathis mootz, venetian snares, fanny…or anyone else. into oblivion ground on, shredding bernard’s parietal lobe next; a green flow erupted from the down-turned corners of his mouth along with a delicate foam. 'metropole insomnia' sent strangely ambient, apocalyptic imagery through what remained of his aural and visual senses. by the time he reached the closing 'let’s hear it for the hardcore,' bernard’s face was covered in tears—but he wasn’t sure whether they were from the sheer joy of experiencing such brilliant breakcore music, or from the pain those pummeling metallic beats exerted on his senses. it doesn’t really matter though, mused bernard in the last thought he’d ever have, ‘cos into oblivion is the last record i’ll ever need. price: euro 5,00.

V.A.. gully gotham grit. volume 1. 12\". mirex c15 n.y., always a melting pot of cultures and styles. the city that doesn't sleep - and if you make it there you'll etc.-etc.. important for the u.s. subculture for decades (if you don't know 'no new york' yet, you should look out...). besides the academic 'knitting factory' scene, there have always been artists who are and will keep 'underground'. what that means in this case: fresh, pry and rowdy! and that's what this compilation series should be - a little overview of what's happening in this post-9/11 moloch of a city that is still a nutrient solution for something new! mad ep's 'acid jig' is g.g.g. volume 1's perfect opener, keeping the roughness of the sixties and transforming it into the 21st century - featuring a little homage to a young vocalist from texas. this is the only track which has been already released (on mad ep's phantastic 'not afraid of spiders' cd). bit shifter is one of the big names in the gameboy scene, having performed regularly in new york, and touring literally around the whole world. he is equally at home alongside fellow chiptune musicians as well as breakcore-cult-acts such as drop the lime and enduser. 'surge' is a syncopated, straight track making you move and twitch. go for it! twenty knives is an extremely talented youngster (he’s only 21), who has already toured japan with enduser and had a split-7\" with joseph nothing. 'moloko velocet' will let your ears bleed - ultra-fast, hard as fuck and kicking your poor ass! turn the record over and continue with dnb ruffneck, submerged. 'gi choke' is a drum-and bass/breakbeat-mix with a killer-subbass and heavy-hitting, live-recorded drums. following the mayhem is the slower 'polychrome' by aerostatic, its pounding 16th-drums keeping the spacy synths and infectious grooves from leaving earth. math head sets the furious finale with 'toxic special', attacking mind and body with a merciless crescendo of beats, breaks, speed and volume. you want more? you'll get more - promised! this is only the beginning.... price: euro 5,00.
