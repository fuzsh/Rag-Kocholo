This is a complete alphabetical list (for more recent musicians, see this page that is dynamically updated).\n\nNote: musicians and groups are listed by the names they use on their records (first names first). So \"Bob Dylan\" is under \"B\" and \"Captain Beefheart\" is under \"C\" and \"10,000 Maniacs\" comes before \"A\". Lower case names are sometimes at the end (don't blame me if you picked a lowercase name for your band).\n\nYou can also use the search box to search the entire website). There is a separate section for Classical Music."
