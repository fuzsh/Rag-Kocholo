        "text": "While it’s those big name boxers who have helped to create Sully’s legendary status in the boxing world, Sully’s real identity comes from the thousands of kids who have come there over the years because they wanted to learn to box. They were lost, they found something they were good at, they found reason. Toronto’s very own boxing gym.\n\nWe believe in youth and the power of focused mindset. We work to cultivate lessons of discipline, self worth and motivation, both physically and mentally to enable children to grow into adulthood as better citizens of Toronto and the world.\n\nCurrently in the works is both an after-school program and a summer camp designed to give kids the support needed to harness these values.\n\n“If motivation, flexibility, and a personal approach is what your looking for in a trainer, then this place is for you! These guys are a professional and know so much about boxing techniques and culture, I can only highly recommend.”\n\nI joined just over a year ago and love everything about training with Tony and all of the other members! It’s a very welcoming atmosphere…young and old, trained and untrained, everyone is welcome!”"
