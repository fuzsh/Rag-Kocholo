        "text": "Bendigo (born October 11, 1811, Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England—died August 23, 1880, Beeston, Nottinghamshire) was an English bare-knuckle boxer who became a Methodist evangelist and who is one of the few athletes whose name is borne by a city—Bendigo in Victoria, Australia. His nickname apparently is a corruption of the Old Testament name Abednego. Thompson was one of triplets; the other two were nicknamed Shadrach and Meshach, alluding to the names of Daniel’s three companions from the Book of Daniel.\n\nBorn into an impoverished family of 21 children, Thompson was sent to the workhouse with his mother upon the death of his father. Soon after, he became an ironworker, a career that greatly improved his strength. By age 18 he had started prizefighting, and by 21 he had become a professional boxer. In the course of his pugilistic career (1832–50), Bendigo lost only one fight, a defeat to Benjamin Caunt in 1838. Caunt, however, outweighed him by more than 40 pounds, and the fight was lost when Bendigo was judged to have committed a foul by falling without having received a blow. (In bare-knuckle fighting, rounds were of an indefinite length, but, when a boxer was hit and put at least one knee to the mat, the round was ended, and the boxer had a definite time period by which he had to be ready for the next round. In order to prevent fighters from going down anytime they felt challenged by an opponent, when a boxer fell without being hit, it was considered a foul. Bendigo was considered to be a master of the ploy of stopping a round to get a rest when things looked unpromising in the ring.) In 1839 Bendigo won the English championship by beating James (“Deaf”) Burke. Bendigo retired briefly but then returned to win the disputed title of champion of England from Caunt in 1845; this time it was Caunt who committed the foul. Bendigo’s last fight, again won because of a foul committed by his opponent, was in 1850.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nGreat Moments in Sports Quiz\n\nBecause fistfighting was a breach of the peace, Bendigo was arrested after most of his fights. Further, he was frequently imprisoned for excessive drinking and brawling after his retirement from the ring. During his periods of incarceration, he heard many sermons from the prison chaplain, and one of these sermons eventually inspired him to attend a revival and try to amend his life. He had a religious conversion and became a preacher. The language of his own sermons was described as quaint, but he drew huge crowds wherever he preached.\n\nHe was so highly regarded in Nottingham that a monument to him was dedicated in 1891, a lion over his grave, which bears an inscription attesting to his divided life: “In life always brave, fighting like a lion, in death like a lamb, tranquil in Zion.” Bendigo was inducted into Ring magazine’s Boxing Hall of Fame in 1955."
