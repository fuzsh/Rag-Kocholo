        "text": "I first wrote about this situation last week, and then I guess I got the rest of PJ Media to offer their takes on the whole shebang (yay for me!), and boy did things escalate quickly.\n\nSee, we're not supposed to question the fact that the International Boxing Association (IBA) kicked Khelif and Lin out of the Women's World Boxing Championship last year for being dudes because the IBA is sponsored by Russia or something.\n\nAnd if you do question it, you are a bad person abusing these guys, not someone disgusted by men beating women, as my friend Stephen Kruiser wrote.\n\nAs you recall, Khelif forced Italy's Angela Carini to quit after just 46 seconds because of how hard he hit her. Carini collapsed on the mat in tears after.\n\n\"I'm used to suffering. I've never taken a punch like that, it's impossible to continue. I'm nobody to say it's illegal. I got into the ring to fight. But I didn't feel like it anymore after the first minute. I started to feel a strong pain in my nose. I didn't give up, but a punch hurt too much and so I said enough. I'm leaving with my head held high,\" said Carini, as quoted by my friend Rick Moran.\n\nIn fact, fans of Carini actually tried to call her and coach Emanuele Renzini and say, \"Don’t fight, please: It’s a man, it’s dangerous for you.\"\n\nLin Yu Ting's two opponents, Svetlana Staneva of Bulgaria and Yildiz Kahraman of Turkey, both lost to him as well. But they made it clear they were not tolerating the Olympics' woke nonsense by throwing up X's, as in XX chromosomes for women, with their fingers after their respective fights, affirming their actual womanhood.\n\nYou can see footage of Kahraman doing the XX gesture here, courtesy of former University of Kentucky swimmer and women's sports activist Riley Gaines:\n\nGood on you, ladies.\n\nStill, you cannot help but laugh in that \"laughing on the outside but crying on the inside\" way, seeing two biological males — or at least, two biological males with sexual development disorders (\"intersex\"), as Moran had also noted might be the case — poised to go for gold in women's boxing at the Olympics.\n\nAlso for our VIPs: Massachusetts Bill Removes 'Mother' and 'Father' From Birth Certificates\n\nKeep in mind, too, that if Khelif and Lin do indeed have sexual development disorders, a condition that affects a very small number of people worldwide (0.05% to 1% of the population), what are the odds they both happen to take up boxing and end up going to the Olympics?\n\nI'm not calling it a conspiracy, but have you ever seen anything like this?"
