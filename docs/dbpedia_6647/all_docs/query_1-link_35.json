        "text": "Throwing punches in the ring is only part of the reason professional boxers have knockout bodies. Boxing helps sculpt a muscular physique, focusing on building a strong core. Including bicycle crunches, side planks, and Russian twists in your boxing workout can also strengthen abdominal muscles.\n\nCore conditioning is essential for boxing. Most of the power in a punch comes from being able to forcibly rotate your core, giving the strike explosive power. A sturdy core helps keep a boxer's body safe during a match. A boxer also has to be able to take blows to the body without damaging their ribs and organs. The muscles in the abdominals and obliques act as armor against an opponent's attacks.\n\nYou don't have to be a pro boxer to reap the benefits of a boxing workout. Here, Chris Algieri, a professional boxer and two-time world champion, demonstrates his go-to conditioning exercises for a strong, stable core. Read on to learn how to do a boxing workout at home that builds endurance and targets your abdominal muscles.\n\nWhat Is a Boxing Workout?\n\nBoxing requires lower- and upper-body strength for quick footwork and strong punches. A boxer may complete various aerobic (cardio) and muscle-strengthening exercises. A boxing workout might include various exercises that build endurance while building muscle mass. This type of workout also can include kickboxing and shadowboxing moves, such as various punches and kicks.\n\nYou might require certain equipment for a boxing workout, such as a jump rope, gloves, and punching bags. The following workout doesn't require any equipment, and you can do it from the comfort of your own home.\n\nBenefits\n\nThere are several possible benefits of doing a boxing workout, such as:\n\nCan improve agility and speed: Boxers have to react quickly to their opponent's attacks, so a boxing workout typically includes speedwork. This type of exercise can teach you to be quick on your feet.\n\nEnhances balance and stability: Muscle-strengthening exercises build and maintain bone and muscle mass. Strong bones and muscles are essential for balance and stability, especially as you age. People naturally lose bone and muscle mass as they age, which increases the risk of falls and injuries.\n\nImproves cardiovascular health: A boxing workout can get your heart pumping, which can decrease your heart disease risk. Elevating heart rate through exercise helps the body deliver blood and oxygen to the muscles efficiently.\n\nProvides a full-body workout: This type of workout combines several muscle groups, helping you strengthen your lower and upper body at the same time.\n\nThe 8-Move Boxing Workout\n\nThis boxing workout includes the following eight moves:\n\nBicycle crunches\n\nSide plank\n\nAlternating hands plank\n\nT-push-up\n\nAlternating leg with ball pass and seated underhand pass\n\nAccordion side crunch\n\nRussian twists\n\nSit-up with a twist\n\nRemember to take five to 10 minutes to warm up before and cool down after the workout. Try doing some light aerobic movement, such as dynamic stretching or walking. Warming up and cooling down helps prevent injuries.\n\n1. Bicycle Crunches\n\nThis move is excellent for boxers because it focuses on core stability while rotating the shoulders and incorporating the lower body. Bicycle crunches are great for everyone, not just boxers. It slims the waistline while improving strength, flexibility, and coordination.\n\nHere's how to do bicycle crunches:\n\nBegin by lying on your back with hands behind your head\n\nAlternate, bringing each elbow to the opposite knee while maintaining a tight core\n\nDo 10 to 20 continuous crunches with each elbow. Rest and then repeat two to three times.\n\n2. Side Plank\n\nSide planks are vital for a boxer. The movement promotes core stability and shoulder girdle strength, crucial for throwing strong punches. Side planks are also good ab exercises for most people since they don't stress the lower back. Strong abs can help prevent lower back pain and injuries.\n\nHere's how to do a side plank:\n\nTurn to one side with your legs extended and your feet and hips planted on the ground\n\nPut your elbow under your shoulder and push your abs and hips up until the top of your body forms a straight line\n\nHold for 30 to 60 seconds. Return to the starting position, then move to the other side and repeat.\n\n3. Alternating Hands Plank\n\nThis excellent move challenges balance, coordination, and core strength. Some evidence suggests that a strong core helps athletes and non-athletes have better balance and stability. This can help prevent falls and injury.\n\nHere's how to do an alternating hands plank:\n\nStart in a plank position\n\nKeep your weight resting on your left forearm. Slowly lift your right arm off the ground, reaching it out in front of you.\n\nLower back down and alternate to the left arm. Do this 10 times with each arm.\n\n4. T-Push-Up\n\nBoxers experience a lot of wear and tear on the shoulder, so it's important to strengthen each part of it. The T-push-up helps you build core stability, posterior shoulder strength, and flexibility.\n\nThis push-up also works the anterior deltoid, vital for movement and power when punching forward. Having strong shoulders and chest muscles can help improve posture in non-boxers.\n\nHere's how to do a T-push-up:\n\nBegin in a standard push-up position. Lower your body slowly, as you would for a regular push-up.\n\nTurn to one side as you push yourself up, raising that side's arm towards the ceiling\n\nReturn your hand to the floor, then repeat on the other side. Do this 15 times on each side.\n\n5. Alternating Leg With Ball Pass + Seated Underhand Pass\n\nThis exercise works your lower abdominals and promotes full-body coordination. Boxers will often explode out of a crouched position, so it's essential to have strong lower abs to support this movement.\n\nThe seated underhand pass uses isometric holds to promote core strength and stability. It hones the hand-eye coordination necessary to be a great fighter.\n\nHere's how to do an alternating leg with ball pass and seated underhand pass:\n\nGet into a seated position with your feet off the ground\n\nSqueeze your abs and pull your knees in as you pass a weight (or medicine ball or an imaginary object) under your bent leg\n\nRepeat 20 times\n\n6. Accordion Side Crunch\n\nResearch has found that strong obliques and other abdominal muscles improve lower back pain in some people. This isometric hold promotes core strength. The crunch tones your obliques and increases endurance. It's also another move that supports coordination between the upper and lower body.\n\nHere's how to do an accordion side crunch:\n\nGet into the side position\n\nSimultaneously crunch and pull your knees in, keeping your feet off the floor and focusing on your obliques\n\nRepeat this 15 to 20 times\n\n7. Russian Twist\n\nThis classic ab move will improve your core rotational strength. This strength is important for maximizing power when throwing a punch.\n\nHere's how to do a Russian twist:\n\nStart in a seated position\n\nExplosively twist from one side to the other\n\nAim to twist to each side 15 to 20 times\n\n8. Sit-Up With a Twist\n\nThis full-core movement works your upper and lower ab muscles in the initial sit-up and then fires up your obliques during the twist.
