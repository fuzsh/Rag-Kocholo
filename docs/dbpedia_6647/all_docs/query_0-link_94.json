        "text": "Best Workout Ever: Orem, Utah Boxing Gym\n\nWhen you think about boxing, what is the first thought that typically comes to mind?Â\n\nDo you think about some of the all-time boxing greats, like 'Iron' Mike Tyson and 'Big' George Foreman? Or maybe you think about Hollywood's movie legends like Rocky Balboa and Apollo Creed. Whatever it is, if boxing for exercise doesn't come to mind, you're missing out.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you are the meanest and strongest bodybuilder on the block or if you are entirely new to the exciting world of fitness, boxing is an excellent way to exercise because it caters to all fitness levels, and will continuously challenge you to become the best version of yourself.\n\nOne of the oldest combat sports in the world, boxing, utilizes the entire body to incorporate punches, core strength, footwork, and head movement for offensive and defensive purposes. With consumers always aiming for the 'next best thing' to improve their overall health, it didn't take long for people to start noticing how incredibly fit boxers are.Â\n\nFeaturing powerful, sturdy legs, strong arms, and a perfectly sculpted waist - its no wonder why more and more people are turning to boxing, as a means to get in shape.Â\n\nWith that in mind, if you are one of the many that dream of improving their lives for the better through an exceptional boxing gym in Orem, Utah, look no further because Legends Boxing can help!\n\nYour First Class\n\nYou finally did it: you made the first step in the right direction to take care of your overall wellbeing by signing up for the best boxing workout ever in Orem, Utah. If you're feeling a little nervous or even a bit anxious, then that is perfectly normal, as walking into any new workout class you are not familiar with can be a little intimidating. However, keep in mind that everyone had their 'first day' at one point or another, and these feelings of anxiety tend to dissipate as you step foot in the club.Â\n\nHere's what you can expect from your first boxing class:\n\nHand wraps and gloves\n\nIt wouldn't be boxing without the hand wraps and gloves! At most boxing clubs, you will need to purchase these things to protect yourself from injury when you start throwing punches. You can often rent these items, but it's always recommended to purchase your own since they tend to get sweaty. Hand wraps are pretty inexpensive, but boxing gloves can sometimes come with a hefty price tag. If you are new to boxing, it's always a good idea to start by renting the gloves for your first few classes, just to make sure you truly love the workout and plan to keep coming back. (Which we know you will!)\n\nFirst class walk-through\n\nIt's extremely important to show up to your first boxing class at least 15 minutes early for a few reasons. First and foremost, like with all boxing clubs, boot camps, and fitness programs, there will be some paperwork and liability forms that you will need to sign prior to being able to take the class. Next, the trainer will want to give you a quick run-down of the gym to help make you feel more comfortable. They will show you where the lockers and restrooms are, where the hydration station is to refill your water, and of course, the boxing equipment. They will also help you wrap your hands for the first time to ensure they are properly protected before starting the class.Â\n\nExpect a full-body workout\n\nWhen most people think about boxing classes, they are usually under the impression that it only utilizes their upper body strength, consisting of punching a heavy bag for 45 minutes straight. However, this couldn't be further from the truth! At Legends Boxing, every class is different and incorporates various exercises to get all of your major muscle groups working. Squats, crunches, lunges, box jumps, mountain climbers - you can expect to do a lot more than just throwing basic punches at a bag!Â\n\nWhat are the Benefits of Boxing?Â\n\nAs we mentioned, boxing has a ton of benefits, which is why it has become increasingly popular over the years as one of the best ways to get in shape. Offering high-intensity interval training or HIIT style workouts to maximize your calorie burn efforts, it goes without saying that boxing is definitely an ideal way to improve one's overall health.\n\nSome of the best benefits experienced in boxing include:\n\nYou will burn a ton of calories to fight stubborn fat to help trim your waist.\n\nYou will work out and strengthen every muscle in your body for a great full-body workout.\n\nIt can help to improve your mental state and better your mood.\n\nIt can promote heart health by providing great cardiovascular activity.\n\nYou will experience better balance and hand-eye coordination.\n\nIt can boost your endurance.\n\nIt can help to build strong bones and ligaments.\n\nYou will naturally improve your core stability and experience better posture.\n\nIt is an excellent way to relieve stress.\n\nYou will meet new like-minded friends.\n\nWithout a doubt, you will experience the most fun you have ever had coming from a workout class.Â\n\nWith all of these benefits listed, its no wonder why boxing has changed and improved the lives of thousands. If you are looking to change up your dull workout routine and spice things up with an incredible workout, we recommend giving boxing a try!\n\nBoxing helps you to sculpt every muscle in your body through total-body exercises in addition to burning tons of calories. It helps to improve mental and heart health and is backed by one of the most supportive communities to help keep you going strong on your fitness journey.Â"
