        "text": "In boxing, kickboxing and mixed martial arts, a chin refers to a boxer's ability to tolerate physical trauma to the face without being knocked out.\n\nA boxer with a \"good chin\" refers to a boxer with tremendous ability to absorb punishment in the face, which can also be called \"having a beard\", \"iron chin\", or \"good whiskers\". Boxers noted to have good chins are Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Rocky Marciano, Jake LaMotta, Tex Cobb, Carmen Basilio, Marvin Hagler, Antonio Margarito,Jos√© Luis Castillo, Evander Holyfield, Vitali Klitschko, Nicolay Valuev, David Tua, James Toney, George Chuvalo, John Duddy and others. There is a dispute as to the physiology of having a \"good chin.\" Some believe that a strong neck that resists a sudden angular acceleration of the head is what makes a \"good chin.\" Supporters of this belief point to Evander Holyfield and Marvin Hagler, both of whom were strong and had large trapezius muscles around the neck. Other believe that a having a \"chin\" is a product of one's determination.\n\nA boxer with a \"bad chin\", \"glass chin\", or \"glass jaw\". refers to boxers with limited ability to absorb punishment in the face. Many clubfighters and journeymen may have glass chins, although it may depend on weight class or sometimes legs. Wladimir Klitschko is sometimes referred to as having a glass chin, although some boxing experts, such as Teddy Atlas, believe it to be a mindframe. In 2008, Amir Khan was labelled as being \"chinny\" [cite web | author = BBC News | coauthors = Dirs, Ben | date = 2008-09-07 | title = Khan gone in 60 seconds | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/606/A40663091 | publisher = BBC News | accessdate = 2008-10-07] and lacking a \"decent chin\" [cite web | author = Daily Express | coauthors = Hickman, Niall | date = 2008-09-08 | title = Khan will not survive floor show | url = http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/60344/Khan-will-not-survive-floor-show | publisher = Daily Express | accessdate = 2008-10-07] after being knocked out in the first minute of his bout with Colombian Breidis Prescott. Lennox Lewis is also criticized for having a glass chin, having been knocked out by people not known for being punchers; this is also disputed as he absorbed punishment from notorious power puncher David Tua."
