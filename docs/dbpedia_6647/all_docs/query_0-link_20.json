The controls are very simple, and there's a limited number of punches that can be thrown - basically, right and left jab, an uppercut and a cross side-punch.\n\nThe game features some famous boxers from the sports history. Each one has some characteristics such as power, resistance and endurance. At the beginning of the game, the player can create his own boxer, then use it to compete in a world championship and defeat the opponents. As usual in many video games, you have to fight against all the boxers in the list, beginning with a weak opponent, and finishing against the world champion."
