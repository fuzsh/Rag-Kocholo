        "text": "Welcome to the PAL Super Nintendo Games Section. All of the Super Nintendo SNES Games for sale are PAL Super Nintendo SNES Games intended for an Australian or European console. To run the PAL Super Nintendo Games on a non European or Australian console you will need either a modified Super Nintendo (SNES) or a Game Genie. I can supply either of these, and they can be found in the Super Nintendo Hardware or Super Nintendo Consoles section.\n\nWe now have a dedicated US SNES Games section. If you are a North American customer or are looking for Imported SNES Games, this is the section to check out.\n\nPlease enquire beforehand if you are unsure about which games run on your own console. If you are looking for Japanese games we have a great selection of Imported Japanese Super Nintendo Games (the Super Famicom) in the Super Famicom Games section. All games have been cleaned as described in the Care of Second Hand Games section.\n\nThe difference between Console Passion and other retro gaming shops is that all the games I sell are complete, and in good condition. Unless stated otherwise, all the games below are boxed, with instructions. If you are not happy with the condition of a game you buy from me - send it back, and I'll give you a refund or a replacement."
