        "text": "\"With Mike Bites, cannabis fans around the world can experience the same wellness benefits that plant-based products have brought me,\" says retired professional boxer and global icon Mike Tyson, Co-Founder and Chief Brand Officer of TYSON 2.0, the maker of Mike Bites Delta 8 and Delta 9 gummies.\n\nHailed as one of the greatest heavyweight champions in boxing history, Mike Tyson's name echoed through boxing arenas like thunder. Iron Mike was revered for his lightning-fast knockouts and ferocious demeanor inside the ring, winning his first 19 professional fights via knockout. From claiming his first heavyweight belt at the tender age of 20, to becoming the youngest heavyweight champion in history, Tyson's ascent seemed unstoppable. He followed that up by becoming the inaugural heavyweight boxer to concurrently hold the WBA, WBC, and IBF championships, as well as the first to win them consecutively.\n\nDespite his tremendous boxing success, Tyson might be best known for one of his most infamous moments in the ring. During his 1997 rematch against Evander Holyfield, whom he had lost to the prior year, Tyson was on the ropes again, but this time he notoriously turned the tables on his foe by viciously biting off a portion of Holyfield’s ear – a truly horrifying sports spectacle when it occurred.\n\nWhile that display of violence certainly tarnished Tyson’s legacy for a time, enough time has passed that Iron Mike is able to poke fun at himself and his most infamous occurrence in the ring.
