        "text": "This book examines in detail the diagnostic approach to manic depressive (bipolar) illness, with special reference to the borderline zones with unipolar depression and schizoaffective disorder. Among other diagnostic issues considered are mixed episodes (often misdiagnosed by psychiatrists), rapid cycling, and the confusion with personality disorders. Within the context of diagnosis and understanding of the dynamics of bipolar disorder, temperament, character, and personality are all extensively discussed. Neurocognitive deficit and disability are covered, as are elements of evolutionary biology and behavior. With regard to treatment, the major focus is on evidence-based therapy, with reference to the results of randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses; in addition, contemporary guidelines and future trends are examined. Careful consideration is also given to the psychosocial treatment approach and issues relating to societal and economic costs and burdens.\n\n“This book offers state of the art knowledge about BD. Chapters are well-structured and clearly organized. Text is easy to read and follow. It provides excellent learning material and therefore it is definitely recommended as a literature for psychiatrists and psychiatric residents, as well as for other proffesionals that care for patients with BD.” (Ana Kovak Mufić, Alcoholism and Psychiatry Research, Vol. 51 (2), 2015)\n\n“This is a full review of bipolar disorder and its many facets. … the book can be a helpful reference for any healthcare provider, but given the specific and detailed information, it is most appropriate for psychiatrists. … This book is truly an amazing accomplishment and it is the most complete book on bipolar disorder that I have seen.” (Aaron Plattner, Doody’s Book Reviews, April, 2015)\n\nAccess this book\n\nSubscribe and save\n\nSpringer+ Basic\n\nEUR 32.99 /Month\n\nGet 10 units per month\n\nDownload Article/Chapter or eBook\n\n1 Unit = 1 Article or 1 Chapter\n\nCancel anytime\n\nSubscribe now\n\nBuy Now\n\neBook EUR 85.59\n\nPrice includes VAT (Germany)\n\nAvailable as EPUB and PDF\n\nRead on any device\n\nInstant download\n\nOwn it forever\n\nSoftcover Book EUR 117.69\n\nPrice includes VAT (Germany)\n\nCompact, lightweight edition\n\nDispatched in 3 to 5 business days\n\nFree shipping worldwide - see info\n\nHardcover Book EUR 106.99\n\nPrice includes VAT (Germany)\n\nDurable hardcover edition\n\nDispatched in 3 to 5 business days\n\nFree shipping worldwide - see info\n\nTax calculation will be finalised at checkout\n\nOther ways to access\n\nLicence this eBook for your library\n\nInstitutional subscriptions"
