        "text": "TAMPICO, Mexico – The father-in-law and brother-in-law of Louisiana native Ali Landry were murdered by suspected Mexican cartel, media outlets reported this week.\n\nThe men were kidnapped when they left their home in Tampico, south of Mexico City, in early September. Fifteen days later, their bodies were found in the Mexican state Veracruz. They are the brother and father of Alejandro Monteverde, a movie producer.\n\nMonteverde married Landry – of Breaux Bridge – in 2006. The couple has three children.\n\nThe Latin Times reported a television report suggested a ransom was paid for the release of the two men but the kidnappers did not follow through with the promise of their release.\n\nMonteverde's brother reportedly ran a restaurant that has reported cartel activity.\n\nLandry's Twitter account has not referenced the murder. Monteverde's Instagram account has pictures of his father and other family members.\n\nLandry was Miss USA 1996 and rose to stardom when she appeared in the Doritos ad for the 1998 Super Bowl."
