        "text": "Mario Lopez might as well swing a chair around from The Max — because he’s got a lot to say. The Saved by the Bell alum isn’t holding back in his new memoir, Just Between Us, with his latest confession surrounding his failed marriage to model Ali Landry back in 2004.\n\nLopez, 40, famously cheated on the Runaway Hearts actress, 41, during a wild bachelor party weekend in Mexico. The ’90s teen heartthrob was photographed in a compromising position with an unidentified woman. The couple annulled the union just two weeks after their wedding, but it would take over seven years for the actor to confess his infidelity to Howard Stern.\n\n“It was spring break….everybody was hanging out. That was a situation where I was not mature and man enough,” he elaborated in February 2011 to Stern. “I had no business of being in that position.”\n\nNow, Lopez is bringing up the past once again in his memoir. The actor has admitted that he never was truly in love with Landry during their relationship.\n\n“I had never addressed certain relationships, especially the truth and the handling of what happened in my first marriage,” he wrote in Just Between Us, via Yahoo. “I got inebriated and a little too friendly with a young lady. When it was time to return home, lightning hit me with the truth: I wasn’t in love. But I walked down the aisle [anyway].”\n\nLopez is currently happily married to his second wife Courtney Mazza, whom he wed in December 2012. The couple are parents to daughter Gia, 4, and son Dominic, nearly 13 months. Find out more confessions from Mario’s memoir."
