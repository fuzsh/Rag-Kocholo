This gal has got that talent and brains that have led her to acclaim as an actress, television host and brand ambassador.\n\nLisa Beres 02:31\n\nBut Ali's journey wasn't all glitz and glamour and salty snacks. No no. In fact, after turning 40 Ali started experiencing numerous health issues that reads more like a list of side effects from a pharmaceutical commercial. She had chronic fatigue, brain fog, poor sleep, thinning hair, fine lines, digestive issues, low sex drive, bouts of depression, and overall, just feeling off. So, Ali decided to take back her health and get to the bottom of her health. Eating the words of Maya Angelou do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better.

Welcome to the show.\n\nLisa Beres 03:44\n\nWelcome Ali. We are so thrilled to have you with us today.\n\nAli Landry 03:51\n\nSuch a nice intro. You did so much work and I really appreciate it. Thank you so much. I'm so happy to be here.\n\nRon Beres 03:59\n\nWe wanted to go longer, but we realized that'd be the whole show. Right? Because you have so many great things you have done.\n\nAli Landry 04:05\n\nAnd you're funny to boot. So good. But Ali,\n\nLisa Beres 04:09\n\nwe are so thrilled to have you with us today. I know our listeners cannot wait to hear from you. So, I want to dive right in and get to the nitty gritty, everything you have to share and teach our listeners. Tell us a little more about your background and how you became Miss USA and landed the coveted Doritos Super Bowl commercial.\n\nAli Landry 04:29\n\nI mean, that's just a crazy story. I think I was in college in Southwest Louisiana. And again, like I was thinking about my future and I was in broadcast journalism, so thinking I was going to be a news anchor. But I knew that I probably have to pay my dues and that entailed bringing someone coffee and that just did not sit well with I can't do that. I begged my mom I really think I should compete for Miss Louisiana. Because if I win, I'd already had in my head if I win, then I get to travel around the state and I could secure a really great job. And in my mind, I was just about skipping a few steps on the job ladder. I ended up going to miss Louisiana I won, I did just that I secured a job, not what I really wanted to do. But anyway, it was in PR, and that was exciting.\n\nLisa Beres 05:17\n\nNo coffee and balls, no coffee deliveries,\n\nAli Landry 05:20\n\nLittle travel, which was fun for me. And then you have to go on to compete for Miss USA. And I did. And I ended up winning. But that was really my first I was doing some practices that I don't think I was really even aware what I was doing. I was using like visualization. Like I really think that's how I won. Mindset. Oh Wow. My mindset practice. Since I was 19 years old. Oh, Lee. And I was like, well, that's kind of cool that you had that perspective. And I was doing those things like way back then.\n\nRon Beres 05:51\n\nDid you innately do that? Or were you an avid reader of motivational books and kind of put vision boards together? How did you even know to do that at 19?\n\nAli Landry 05:58\n\nI think both. I love Dale Carnegie, you know, growing up and Tony Robbins, and I always did you know, I'm a student of life. And I am a sharer of information. And I asked a lot of questions. I probably pulled from all of that. But I knew that that's what I needed to do to get to the end of that kind of competition, because I honestly thought that it would really be the mindset that with the person. Wow, that is so interesting.\n\nLisa Beres 06:25\n\nI've read you know; your Wikipedia page and research do on that. I didn't know that. And I just find that so fascinating. Because it's kind of like now we're in this spiritual evolution of consciousness where people are starting to realize like our thoughts create our reality and energy, everything. But wow, at 19 that you knew that. That's incredible. You were really ahead of the game, especially in pageants where it's so competitive and very easy to get insecure. Right and acting that whole world that you've been in, is it breeds like insecurity no matter how pretty someone is, or talented? You know, you never feel good enough.\n\nAli Landry 06:58\n\nYeah, you know, by candidate standard competition standard. I was definitely maybe an underdog a little bit. You know, I didn't have the fanciest dress. I didn't have a team of people telling me how to do hair makeup. How to answer a question. I wasn't probably as poised as I wasn't like, born and bred to do this. Right. I was in that situation before I wanted a job. And I couldn't find a way to skip a few steps on that job ladder. That was like my whole goal, I think like going into it. But a lot of girls, the insecurity level was definitely there.\n\nLisa Beres 07:28\n\nYou didn't have a glam squad?\n\nAli Landry 07:29\n\nI now and then I look at my pictures on a video from back then I was like, Gosh, I wish I doubt that. I highly doubt that. Oh, the 90s hair, you know, with the bangs that are like up in the air down. A little like that.\n\nLisa Beres 07:43\n\nAwkward.\n\nAli Landry 07:46\n\nIt's funny, it was not moving. Well,\n\nRon Beres 07:48\n\nI think you'd appreciate this. I recently read this quote, if you think the pursuit of good health is expensive and time consuming. Try illness. From Lee Swanson. And Ali. I know you agree with that. So, you also believe in Aging Backwards? And that 40 is the new 20 I do too. Me too. Yeah. We all believe that. Right? That means making yourself a priority. Can you elaborate on how exactly our listeners can do this?\n\nAli Landry 08:16\n\nYou know, I think making yourself a priority. That was what sort of stuck with me first, you know, my mom, she had her own business. But yet she was always there for us. It's always running us around and cooking dinner. And we always had an activity and she was just she's just a busy person, not only does she take care of our family, but honestly, she takes care of everyone in her family, plus all of her friends and can lay a wood floor, you know, and spackle a new wall. Like she could really do it all. And I even remember where we were driving in the car. And she just said, if you don't take care of yourself, nobody will. And I was like Wow, you're telling this to like a 15. It was thinking like mom, I don't see you really taking care of yourself. But I don't know, just that little nugget that landed on me at 15. I've carried that with me throughout my life. Because I know so many women carry that guilt when you do anything for yourself. Because you always think there's a million other things that you could be doing. You hold on to that, that really gave me the permission to kind of lead with that like moving forward in my life, knowing that I needed to put my face mask on first, you know, and I always say, you know, we wake up in the morning, and we want to be the best for our spouse, for our partner for our children for our business. But something or someone will always fall short. I don't care what it's always going to fall short. And you got to give yourself grace around that. And you know, think of it like you know what, tomorrow's a new day and I'm going to get back at it tomorrow. But not to carry that guilt. It's so detrimental.\n\nRon Beres 09:51\n\nI have a question when you plan your day. I know you do a lot. You have a lot on your plate and you've actually had even a lot of conversations prior to this interview today. Right? So, do you have goals in mind were like, I'm going to accomplish these one, two or three goals. And that's going to be good enough, because I'm good enough if that makes sense, or each day each day like or do you put everything on your plate and then you judge at the end of the day, and I accomplished nine out of those 10. And I'm mad.\n\nAli Landry 10:12\n\nNow, I wake up every single day. And look, one of the titles I'll tell you right now, because I have a book that'll be coming out next year. But one of the titles that we're toying around with is your worth it. Right? There are so many women don't feel like you're not worthy. I just wanted to, like I see you like you are so worth it. So, I wake up in the morning with that sort of mindset. I have certain systems in place around waking up my morning routine, and my evening routine, I do things right before the kids get home from school. Like most people, I get anxiety, no, I'm a little bit of a type A and want everything perfect. And again, like my desk is a mess. And there's a million things going on, I just launched a new business outside of reshape, it's just like a lot, you know, so with these systems in place, honestly, at least I'm finishing like that one chunk. So, in the morning, first thing I do when I wake up, is I chug a liter of water because I do have digestion issues. And I need to kickstart my digestion. So, I started Yeah, me too. So, people have digestion issues like major, but I have one that's just changed my life. Start with a liter of water before my feet hit the ground. And also, you know, four or five things that I'm grateful for, like in that moment, in the morning, Attitude of Gratitude changes everything, I got to start with that first, then I you know, wake up like the kids already. And as soon as they go, I tried to do daily like meditation. So, the way I set myself up for success with that is I have an area two areas actually in my house. I mean, honestly, people like I don't have space, it's a corner. I'm looking at the one in my bedroom right now literally, it's on the floor in a corner. And what I have is I have a candle, I have an inspirational book, I have a journal I have like some Palo Santo, you know, normally I'm sitting there with my I have like a meditation playlist. So if I can do that, and empty out like you know, the to do list and the clutter and everything that's going on in my brain and picking up the kids at what time and what are we going to do if I can empty myself out, and then fill it back up with positivity, positive reinforcement, whatever beautiful thing I'm going to read from that book that I have or what kind of quotes are going to really land on my heart today. Then I go into my day. I workout and after I workout I jump immediately into work. That sounds like a perfect morning.\n\nLisa Beres 12:42\n\nIs there a green juice involved?\n\nAli Landry 12:45\n\nBack to the digestion routine. It is the one liter of water first thing like as soon as you wake up then I go downstairs I follow it with another like eight to 12 ounces of warm lemon water. And then I do at least 8 to 10 of green juice whether it's a powder like a dehydrated green juice, or something that I'm doing with the kids the day before something are sometimes it's just a store bought organic one and that specific routine. I call it my get things going in the morning routine. I'm going to steal it. Yeah.\n\nLisa Beres 13:20\n\nI'm going to steal it guys. We have to name it Ali.\n\nAli Landry 13:22\n\nGet things going in the morning. Okay, I love it.\n\nLisa Beres 13:25\n\nGet all things going. On your first liter, is it room temperature? Do you leave it room temperature?\n\nAli Landry 13:31\n\nWhat I do you know, I'm all about like I said you set yourself up for success. So, the night before I drink two bottles. I don't know about you but I sit you know throughout the night if I get thirsty. So, I bring two bottles. So, I've got one bottle but I just kind of sip from and I have the second bottle ready for the morning. So, I just don't touch the one that I sip in. And I literally I was doing it wrong. I just got off the phone with my nutritionist. I did a live with her. And she did a video of her in bed with her baby like her hair's a mess. And she grabbed her bottle and just like laid in bed before the feet touched the ground and just chugged it like chugged it. And I was like, that's what you miss. First thing in the morning. I was like I was just lollygagging. Oh, that's crazy. And then I go downstairs and have those other three things and then I'll do the coffee like later. Oh, yeah, I\n\nLisa Beres 14:21\n\nwas going to say there's going to be coffee in there somewhere, right? There's coffee.\n\nAli Landry 14:26\n\nOkay, very hydrated. And one other thing I want to share. I mean, I do have a nighttime routine and different things I do during the day. But I found myself like, you know, because I was alone during that I'm alone during the day, most of the time in the office or running errands and I'm in my peaceful place. I'm in my little Zen office space, getting things accomplished. And as soon as the kids walk in the door, it's like chaos, and it takes me out of my zone. And I was starting to get like really resentful and a little upset about that. So, I was like, I've got to put the system into place like right before they get home from school, so I can then like, bring my vibration down. So, what if they raise it? Like we're at a good level, you know? Oh, I get it balancing that. Yeah, balancing out. So, I take like, you know, some Ashwagandha or something like that, I'll maybe I'll have a tea like right before they come in. And then on my Pinterest page, I pinned all of these beautiful quotes about being a mother. And like, what a child means, you know, like, I just some really beautiful inspirational things. And I read those before they walk into the door. I have a much better mom, if I do that.\n\nLisa Beres 15:35\n\nThat's some good advice. parents out there listening. That's a really good advice. You're right, because energy, you probably familiar with the chart of consciousness, David Hawkins, I think is his name that created that the lowest when you were talking about your mom saying take care of yourself. The lowest, lowest, lowest energy that you can possibly feel is guilt, guilt and shame. I think those are the two bottoms. So, it's like guilt, shame. And then it goes up to like despair. Yeah, what about that fear? Fear? Yeah, we have so much of that in the world right now. So, getting yourself to, you know, we're big believers in that. And you know, Jerry and Esther Hicks, Abraham Hicks, we've listened to a lot of that, and their big thing is just try to get yourself up a notch, you're not going to go from despair to joy in an instant. That's not how it works. But you know, trying to get yourself up this Richter scale one step at a time. And that is being gentle on yourself and saying, hey, you know, if I made myself feel better, now I'm not in that really low energy. And now I'm going to be better able to, you know, handle things and accomplish things and then actually get up so, but you know, I actually dipped my toes in pageants as well in my teens, and 20s. Not to your success alley,\n\nRon Beres 16:40\n\nMiss photogenic of Arizona.\n\nLisa Beres 16:44\n\nOh, my God. So embarrassing. Like Ali, I know firsthand that industry can feel intimidated, judgmental, like we talked about, can you explain to our listeners your view on how real beauty stems from the inside? And what that looks like for you, I know you have a daughter. So, this is probably a big thing that you're instilling in her as well.\n\nAli Landry 17:03\n\nI may not honestly, I just feel like this quote that I always started with, like, prettiest girls are the happiest, right? And I feel like, it's so important for all of us as individuals and whatever journey you're on, you know, and I do apply it a lot too, if you're wanting to reshape something in your life. But when you do that interior work, you know, when you go a little bit deeper, figure out what makes you tick, you know, what your joy is? What makes you sad, what do you want to change, just really spend time with yourself and get to know yourself, and really try to find that internal peace. I feel like you're just happier. I feel like when I do that, I can stay in my lane with the blinders on. And honestly, celebrate everybody, lift people up, celebrate others, but the only way you're able to do that is honestly if you were peaceful within your soul, you know, and we who you are, it took me, you know, I had some forced, reshapes, and that was unhealthy, you know, but that really got me to that place. And I don't know if I would have done the work otherwise. But I have to say like those things. I'm so grateful for them. I'm so much better. I mean, I feel like as horrible as some of the more, they were definitely a blessing. And only because it forced me to do that work. So, I feel like I walked through the world in a very different way. I own my choices, I'm able to give myself grace. You know, like when these things happened, you didn't play the victim card, you didn't feel like they were happening to you rather than energy is. For you. Yeah, for you. You know, for the first one to say it was around like heartbreak and betrayal. Right? So, I was young, I was maybe in my 30s. You know, it took about a month to kind of push through and like, I call it flip the switch on the mindset because I was trying to understand why I was betrayed. And that kind of way. I was really sad. I was just like, all those things like that person wasn't even sorry. So how am I supposed to move on? Like, how am I supposed to forgive someone who doesn't even care about the forgiving? Like, how am I supposed to pick up and move forward in a positive way. But I was able to do it. I mean, I'm not kidding you. During that time, I probably had a stack like this high on the side of my bed of all these books that I would pull from and one of them was the purpose driven life. And I was, you know, reading the passages and I was journaling in it. And I then made a choice like, you know, instead of looking at this, like, why did this happen to me? How could he have done that? I kind of thought you know what, this is a new opportunity for me to actually get it right this time. And I deserve more and better and you know what? I'm going to own that I chose wrong. And I'm going to own that I you know, maybe kind of heard things or saw things it just kind of\n\nLisa Beres 20:00\n\nI was going to say, did you think you ignored red flags?\n\nAli Landry 20:03\n\nI know I did. I know I did. That situation I absolutely 100% could say that was transformative for me as a human being. I think that at the time, it was like, the worst thing that had happened to me. But looking back on it, I think that it was the biggest gift. You know, I chose to walk through my life I said, like without the blinders on, very aware and owning each choice. So that was amazing. And then the other thing was around tragedy.\n\nLisa Beres 20:33\n\nI was going to say tap into your internal power, right? Because I think Do you believe people sense that like, your internal confidence and your internal power, that you kind of project that out? And like, maybe through that experience, you gain this like confidence that like, don't mess with me? I'm not a pushover.\n\nAli Landry 20:49\n\nI don't even think it was that honestly, I don't think it was like, I am woman hear me roar. It was more of like a quiet, I felt very secure in who I am. Because I did the work. I was very clear. I was journaling of the especially in a relationship, I was just so worried like, am I going to choose wrong again, every single day, I would write in my journal, you know, someone to hold my heart in his hands, like all these different things. So, when it came into my life, and it was not that it was very clear, oh, very, very good.\n\nRon Beres 21:24\n\nThat's a very good manifester.\n\nLisa Beres 21:25\n\nI know, you have so many incredible what is the word like, not processes. But\n\nAli Landry 21:31\n\nyeah, I guess processes or whatever that you put into place. It was just that instinctual thing that I knew that that's what I needed to do. And my mom was always like, you should be angry. And I just. That was that's funny, Mama coming up. I couldn't go there, like I was not going to go there, I was going to do the work for myself, because I did not want to make that mistake again. And I really wanted to grow from it. And I always knew, even in that moment, my biggest prayer was like, if I have an opportunity to share what I went through and how I got through it, I want to be able to share that honestly, openly, authentically, with other women, you know, help them get through what they're going through.\n\nLisa Beres 22:12\n\nThat's fantastic. I love that. My friend is a dating coach, and she's probably listening. I see the comments on her Instagram, and people are like, I got burned before all women sucks or, or you know, men are all cheaters or whatever. And they will kind of coin. And it's really unfortunate, you know, but what you're saying is like, you got to put the work in. And you don't want to hold on to that bitterness, right? Because the bitterness will just attract that again, too. Right?\n\nAli Landry 22:36\n\nAnd honestly, I didn't understand what forgiveness meant. That was a big learning lesson for me. You know, I knew that I needed to forgive. But every time I was like, oh my god, like really? Like, why did I forgive him? Like, I didn't understand. But I knew that I was only hurting myself. It was the gift that I needed to give myself to forgive. And it took a while for that to land on me. And to have that aha moment. And like, oh my gosh, I totally get it. So yeah, biggest gift. biggest blessing. Love it.\n\nLisa Beres 23:05\n\nRight now. You're happily married with two kids, right? Three! My goodness, you are a supermom. And you've been married for how long?\n\nAli Landry 23:11\n\nYou know, our anniversary is this week. And last year, it was so funny. Honestly, I think it's 16 years. But last year we said the wrong and we were just like, Happy anniversary year 14. And his brothers like, we got engaged at your wedding. You�re not married... You're married like for 15 years.\n\nLisa Beres 23:33\n\nThat's so funny. That's cute you guys are both that way. So, no one can get mad at each other for forgetting it. We're kind of like that too Ron, aren't we?\n\nRon Beres 23:39\n\nYeah. Confused a couple of years to for sure. Yeah.\n\nLisa Beres 23:43\n\nAs long as we celebrate it?\n\nAli Landry 23:44\n\nYeah, there you go. We're we know the date. So that's, that's important.\n\nRon Beres 23:49\n\nI don�t want to cut you off. You mentioned also lost or grievance? Was there something I thought there you wanted to mention?\n\nAli Landry 23:54\n\nWell, I was just saying we all have things that happened to us in our life, something will happen to all of us. Right, that will shake us to our core. I just had two things that were back to back that were pretty, you know, pretty difficult. So it was that and then my father in law and my brother in law, were kidnapped and were murdered in Mexico.\n\nRon Beres 24:14\n\nI'm sorry about that.\n\nLisa Beres 24:16\n\nSorry. Oh, my God, I can't even imagine.\n\nAli Landry 24:19\n\nNo, you cannot imagine you can't, you just can't, can't wrap your head around that. And my husband and I really got through that together. But that was a tough one. Because you just really don't understand. Like, why both of them. You know, my father in law was the most beautiful man like honestly, we thought that they were going to give him back because they were going to fall in love with him like he was that guy. It was a really tough healing journey for us. But again, it's been a beautiful experience as well. It's taught us you know that life is short, which we know but when you're hit with that, it's like that is a real life is very short, and you need to live it to its fullest. You need to try to be as poor present in the moment as you can. And we really take that to heart. Like, we honestly make big life decisions because of that, that won't make sense to many people. And maybe it's not the smartest thing financially, but we do it because of that, because we know that life is really short. And we feel their hand in our lives, you know, so much like, if you lost, you know, sometimes you feel their presence more than when they were on this earth. Right? Such a disappointment in not even disappointments, just humanity, you know, like, you just don't think like, people are that evil, like something like that could happen. And also like our security, you know, my husband's from Mexico, we live here in Los Angeles, and how we took that for granted, like just actually feeling fine walking to our mailbox, you know, the time when things are a little bad, they're just like going to the grocery store like this, they're a grenade that's going to go off, but when you're at the grocery store, or what the people are Ukraine are experiencing, like, you know, it just really makes you think about life and how you walk through it in a very, very different way.\n\nLisa Beres 26:03\n\nThank you for sharing.\n\nRon Beres 26:05\n\nI�m sure they're very proud of you and to be proud of you beyond and protecting you. So, thank you went through that. But yeah,\n\nLisa Beres 26:10\n\nwow. And you're right Ali. You know, anytime you have a little overuse to say you get the whisper and if you ignore the whistle, and then you get the bonk on the head and we've all been there, we've heated the whispers and we've also ignored the whispers and I just had a whisper I literally just tripped down our stairs last weekend in my high heels holding my brother in law's coffee in one hand and my person the other which was really dumb. And I tripped down and I you know, no big bang my knees and shins. I said to Ron oh my god, like How stupid of me Of course that was going to happen like slippery heels going down a thing, little minor whisper to don't take that for granted, hold that rail, it's there for a reason. Like your toe, someone we know just broke your toe. And you know, you can't walk when you break your toe. Little in all of a sudden, you're appreciating the simple art of walking, you know, something you just take for granted. Of course, loss is, is very difficult. You sound like you have such a graceful approach to handling that. Ron and I have had some major loss in the last couple of years and our family too. So, it's nice to hear how you're dealing with that. We see that too. We feel very connected. You know, messages, songs, number numerology numbers, all kinds of, yeah, really incredible ways that you know, they're communicating with you. It's like not even a question because it's things that they would only know when you would know and you feel their presence. And so that's the beauty in it is we know they're there, and they're in a good place. And that's not fun for anybody to go through suddenly. So\n\nRon Beres 27:33\n\nswitching gears, a little bit here. So, Ali, we see so many fads these days, when it comes to the quest for youth, right? Flawless skin, achieving the perfect physique and weight. What do you say to women who are struggling with their skin to feel less than, especially in the age of social media? Or we're continually comparing our behind the scenes to someone else's, like highlight reel every day?\n\nAli Landry 27:56\n\nWow. I mean, that's a good one.\n\nLisa Beres 27:59\n\nI wrote that question. Ron's not on Instagram, looking at\n\nAli Landry 28:04\n\nthings, they're there, you know, it's like you do the best you can for yourself. And not everybody has all of those issues. And it goes back to like what we were talking about. And this is a perfect example of doing that interior work, really, like thinking about whether it's your skin or your weight, or whatever doing that interior work. So when things come at you in life, you are able to really deflect and you never let it hit you like that image of, you know, the perfect body on Instagram, instead of thinking like, oh my gosh, I'm so this, you think you know what? I'm going to get moving a little bit more and start my journey. Yes. Just really that I just call it like flipping the switch on your mindset, like flip that switch on your mindset. Or like your girlfriend just got a brand-new fabulous house or whatever. And instead of being like, oh my gosh, but she would have never\n\nLisa Beres 28:54\n\nthought of? It's not that big.\n\nAli Landry 28:58\n\nExactly. Which to me, right? So, like celebrating her like, do you stay in your lane, I just feel like you can't worry about what the other person is doing. You just have to be the best person that you can be and do the work on yourself. And just doing that again, it goes back to taking care of yourself. You feel good when you do it for yourself. You feel like you're giving yourself a gift. You know, there's sometimes I mean, I am pretty on top of it all I'm on the board of a medical spa. So, like I get to do a lot of the fun treatments and be the guinea pig and all that is great. But at the end of the day, I do have to say I do get into loads of depression. I do. It's just what happens. But even the simple act for me as going in my bathroom, and literally just putting lotion on my legs. It just lights a little bit mixed my little flicker of a flame. Yeah, that little thing of like self-care just like okay, I got you like I'm taking care of you\n\nLisa Beres 29:54\n\nlike a little time. I love that. Yeah, so even you Ali get You know, intimidated by people's pictures? Because I'm sure people have said to you, well, it's easy for you, you know, you're beautiful and you don't have like issues.\n\nAli Landry 30:10\n\nI don't get intimidated by people's pictures. I don't I have that mindset, like I told you like, I can look at them and like, oh my gosh, like Khloe Kardashian is the body is begging, like, how did she do that? Give her waist that small, I need to talk to like a train or something. And, you know, like, I just immediately go into like, well, let me get to it that, you know, I never do that. I never go there. Yeah, I\n\nLisa Beres 30:35\n\nthink that's a really, really important takeaway for listeners, because I think it was Abraham Hicks going back to them again, where they said, when you see something in others that you want rockets of desire should shoot out and do shoot out, right? They're shooting out, and it's how you process that right? Are you doing the Ali approach and saying, hey, I want that? And you know, I'm going to celebrate that person. And thankfully, they showed me that that's possible. And now that's possible for me. And I think surround yourself too. Right? With people who are giving you that let's be honest, we've all been around people who aren't working on themselves and who don't do that. What do you say about that? If you have people around you who are kind of like,\n\nAli Landry 31:13\n\noh, my god, I love you. And I love that you say that, because that's another thing that I've been doing since, you know, I guess college sounds harsh, but like, I cannot tolerate gossip at all. Like, there is no place for it in my life. I really make an effort to surround myself with people. And I feel like sunshine, I feel like that when I'm in their light. I'm just like, Oh, I love that. I want people to see my superpowers, right. I always like to recognize like the superpower. I like to own my own, like, I know what my superpower is, like, people who see me, you know, like I get to I see, those are the people I'm going to surround myself with. Always so negativity in your life, people that are going to bring you down. Like, I just think there's no space for it. There's no space for it.\n\nLisa Beres 32:00\n\nYeah, you got to just kind of cut those cords and love yourself enough. Love yourself enough to be able to do that. Going back to what you said at the very beginning, you know, because we're, you know, especially as women, you know, raised to not do the self-care or feel guilty when we're standing up for ourselves or for guilty setting those boundaries, right? And we need to celebrate and like embrace that and understand that it's okay, like you said, and even in those moments of maybe where you have to cut off a negative relationship, you can still forgive, you can still send them love, right?\n\nAli Landry 32:32\n\nYeah. You're not mean a mean and ugly, you're being kind and generous and all of that. But it's just you know what, like, I am worthy. I am worthy. I am I can have you in my space, because it doesn't sit well with me just not working for me and my life. So, and I'm worth it.\n\nLisa Beres 32:49\n\nAnd I'm worth it. What's that commercial? You're worth. So, I was shocked when I discovered that 70 to 80% of our immune cells reside in our gut. We've done a few shows on the utter importance of gut health. And I have personally as I said at the top struggled with digestion issues also like you and it's no fun. And according to the National Institutes for Health, 60 to 70 million people are affected by all digestive diseases. So, Ali, give our listeners some tips and tricks and why is digestion important in terms of keeping our bodies looking and feeling young?\n\nAli Landry 33:23\n\nI mean, I am still going through that journey myself. And you know, asking the questions and figuring it out. But they say that the gut is the other brain, right? Yeah. And truly everything stems from it. So, you know, I do things like probiotics, prebiotics, I do that I do food combining.\n\nRon Beres 33:44\n\nYou don't miss a beat.\n\nAli Landry 33:45\n\nI know is there anything you don't do? Well, my digestion? No, no, I fall on the off the wagon? Daily. But you know what I get back on?\n\nRon Beres 33:53\n\nYep. Do you do this every day to seven days a week? Or is it like Monday through Friday?\n\nAli Landry 33:59\n\nThis is my weeks. But I'll tell you like we're all a work in progress. During the day. My day is great. I am like, on it. Right? My food game. You know, my morning routine. My workout. I'm good. As soon as the kids go to bed, I'll be honest, I literally just want to sit in bed, watch Netflix and eat like some kind of chip or something. That's my thing. That's what I'm working on. Now. I'm just trying to just do the little dark piece of chocolate and call it a day. The struggle is real\n\nLisa Beres 34:33\n\nfor all right. And it's all different for us. Yeah, exactly.\n\nAli Landry 34:36\n\nGoing back to that there's so many you know, I'm sure the person that you spoke to, you know, there's the different testing that you could do like getting your blood panel. I just think that if you aren't like what you said most diseases, the root cause is the gut. I feel like we just have to really be diligent about our own health and go down that path. And don't just pass things off, like ask the questions, don't pass them off, like I'm aging or wired to do this. That's normal or whatever. It's not normal. It's not normal. Like, you don't have to feel that way. You deserve better. And there are answers out there, like don't give up on yourself. So that's sort of been, you know, my process. And sometimes it takes me it's not like it happens overnight like, and like, right now I really want to tackle why we as women in our 40s are losing hair, like why my mom's a hairstylist, I was at the house, and she's like, Ali your part is getting wider. And I was like, ohh.\n\nLisa Beres 35:38\n\nThe comments only family, we certainly did notice that. It's a family that we love so much.\n\nAli Landry 35:44\n\nSorry Mom, that's just something that I'm going to dig into, like the follicle health and like all of that, but those kinds of things could take me a year. And then you know, whatever. It's just, it's all a journey. It's a journey. It's a journey. And that's why I love that term student of life, we all need to be that, you know.\n\nLisa Beres 36:03\n\nNy God, just when you think you got it figured out, you'll get that box that we talked about university, like, not so fast.\n\nAli Landry 36:10\n\nAnd you know, what I realized, like you have, and this is why you have this show is that it's not everybody's thing, right? People have other passions and joys or whatever, I like this stuff, like I never use it, I could experience this next level of health. And then because I'm a share by nature, you just want to share it with the world, right? Because not everybody knows about this, that and the other same thing with what you're doing, you know, like you really understand this niche, and your friends are like, just tell me what to do. Tell me what I need to do what I have,\n\nLisa Beres 36:41\n\nthey're overwhelmed, and they're busy. And they don't have time to do all the research, right. And it is overwhelming. Like you said, your day is very, very busy. You're working full time mom and three kids. And that's I already know, you've got to be like busy from morning till night. But I love how you said Don't settle for the status quo. It's something that I see. And it really are, you know, I just when you see very, very overweight people, like my friend and I were having this conversation the other day, it's not about being overweight, it's about your health, it's about that she's a doctor, actually. And she was telling me like, it's not the overweight thing and the very, very, very large distended guts that we are so used to and you know, today's modern age, with the Western diet and all of that, it's the health implications that come with that, right and the losing of the energy because your body has to work so hard, so much harder to carry that weight around. And seven, this isn't just about weight, of course, but that's a big issue because weight equates to too much weight equates to, you know, we're going to go down a road of potential diseases and problems and stress on your system. So, thinking that I'm going to get a disease or everybody gets cancer or everybody gets overweight, when they get older women, you know, get that weight gain around their middle, like we have to change those and say, No, it doesn't have to be the norm. But like you said, we have to ask the questions and dig deeper and be committed, right, be committed to the journey of finding the answers that work for us and finding those solutions.\n\nAli Landry 38:05\n\nI mean, that's how reshaped started. That's how it started. I mean, I was on the daily talk show, you know, live 54321, you know, a high-pressure situation. And, you know, I had major brain fog, like I was thinking one thing, it was not coming out my mouth the way I wanted to come out and I thought oh my gosh, I'm going to lose his job. I felt so off but not, you know, like we were saying not off enough to go to the doctor, I asked my girlfriends about all those issues that you brought up in the beginning. And they were that they were like, oh, yeah, that's what happens when we age or Oh,\n\nRon Beres 38:37\n\ndon't accept it? Well, they say if you don't use it, you lose it. And as we discussed earlier, we see a lot of people as they age, they get very complacent. And we know fitness is essential to good health. But can you give our listeners some tips to get moving? When they rather, like you mentioned earlier on that you mean binge on Netflix and snack on, let's say salty chips that might be Doritos.\n\nAli Landry 39:01\n\nYou know what, I've just taken a different approach to exercise. I think in the past few years, mostly because of pain, like I have had chronic pain issues in the neck and shoulders stemming from an accident for over 20 years. And now I'm really in a good place. But exercise, especially different parts of my body really had to take a backseat not completely, but I just didn't have full mobility. So, I was forced to find other things right. And they became about just moving. You just need to move. You know, like you said, we're all busy, but I can walk the dog. I can go take a little hike, you know, up the mountain. The kids want to ride their bike in the afternoon we can go like around the block and ride the bike a little bit. Our if I feel that little bit of energy, I do like to mix it up. I do not do the same thing every day I get very bored. I'll go to a class where you know it's more running in weights. Or if I just need a chill like Zen that morning. I will literally work out in front of this desk. It's a tiny little space and I'll do an online video. And I'm totally sweating and like a gentle workout. And then sometimes if I get activated with the pain, I go to a stretching class. Like that has been the secret sauce in the past few months. Because before I was like stretching, like, I don't have time for that I need to Yeah, no hi pattern. Yeah, like time is very valuable people I'm not sure. But because I was getting into such pain and activating a time, the stretching, I have more mobility in my arm and my shoulder, like, you know, when you're stretching out, like I just, it's secure. So, in touch with your body, it's like, I don't know, it's like, your body like a gentle hug. It's like everything it needs like stretching it out. And I am not disciplined enough. Some people are definitely discipline. No, I'm not disciplined to do it in my room. Like I have a foam roller, but my kids use it as a sword and like, hit each other. I don't even know where it is. I was looking for it this morning. So, I love to go to like a hot yoga class where you know, it's the music and like, stretching. I'm not even doing yoga. Honestly, it's restorative.\n\nLisa Beres 41:14\n\nRestorative yoga. The first time we went around, it was a mood like restorative yoga. And yeah, it was really neat. It was out on this lawn. And it wasn't a good workout. But it was beautiful. Well, no, the guy comes out and they had the little guitar and it was so beautiful. And I'm like, Oh, good, we're going to get a good workout. And he starts and he's like, reach out this arm for like, 30 minutes. And I'm like, what? Kind of like you Ali, I was like, I need the workout. What's going on? It was almost so uncomfortable. To slow down that much. Right? I guess that's the whole point of restorative yoga. Just getting your body to get into that Zen state and really stretch those muscles. And now with so much sitting, right, everybody's working from home, we all pretty much have desk jobs. It's like, oh, my god sitting is the new secondhand smoke, they say. So, stretching, I love that you said that.\n\nAli Landry 41:59\n\nOr anybody has any pain issues, I just really encourage you to stretch. It really changes everything. Once I realized that I mean, I was paying a fortune to go to a chiropractor. And basically, he was stretching.\n\nRon Beres 42:13\n\nLike, driving an hour in traffic to see I'm in an hour, but I was half an hour stretch. Right?\n\nLisa Beres 42:19\n\nYeah. $100 later. Yeah. And the stretch. Let's see. Wow. Okay, I live in California, people who live in California. It's expensive. But same thing with the stretch labs, right? It cracks me up because you are paying someone I mean, it's good. For people who aren't going to do the stretching themselves. It's better than not stretching, but you do kind of feel like that. Like, wait, I could do this.\n\nAli Landry 42:43\n\nBoy, yeah. And that's the thing. These are things that we you can do for yourself. It's free, you know, all the things were mentioned you don't have to pay anything, you can do it for yourself. But the same thing goes with us saying about like, you didn't want to do the stretch, like give me the workout like I need to do something. It's the same thing with a meditation like I struggled with that mentally because I was like, that is 20 minutes where I should be doing this. And now I'm just sitting on the floor, like listening to like Gregorian chants. But the benefits that I see when I take that time, it doesn't have to be 20 minutes, it could be 510. It changes the dynamic of my day. Oh, really?\n\nLisa Beres 43:20\n\nI'm so glad you said that Ali. Because you know, when people start meditating, it is overwhelming. They're like, I don't know how to do it, how long? I don't have a whole hour. And we've had a lot of experts on talking about that. And they say the same thing. Five minutes, five minutes. Nobody. Nobody has an excuse not to get five minutes to yourself. Because really, really, it is a gift to yourself to meditate. Because I couldn't agree more. It sets the tone for your day. You won't get like a snappy if something goes wrong. You don't have that irritability. Isn't it weird how it stays with you all day? Yeah, I love that. Well, a lot of people are just going through the motions of life afraid to make a splash or create a wave. They're not seeking joy and fulfilling their purpose. And I know you recommend something called a soul reshape and these instances, can you tell us what that is? And how decluttering is a part of that process?\n\nAli Landry 44:11\n\nWell, I will go back to what you said about that little whisper. You know, it's when you're doing things and you're like, yes, like, why haven't I done this and so long, like, that's it. That's that thing that gives you joy and your soul do more of that. That's the thing you need to do Devaraj whether it's gardening, or planting or have you have the music on when you're cooking, or you're dancing or whatever it is, like listen to that little bitty whisper and do more of that thing. I'm always looking for those things that fill up like my soul, not just give me joy not just make me laugh, but like, just give me such fulfillment. Wow. And you\n\nLisa Beres 44:51\n\nhave so many good techniques. I love all the tips you gave I mean, whether it's taking just a 15 minute stroll around the block, it doesn't have to be running a marathon and train for the Boston Marathon guys, I mean, this doesn't have to be, you know, big and tapping into those joyful things and not feeling guilty when you do, right. Yeah. Not feeling guilty what you do and declutter, right. So, clutter is part of that, because we want to cleanse our homes, because clutter can make you feel guilty, right? It's like guilt.\n\nAli Landry 45:17\n\nI mean, I'm looking around my room, and there's some clutter happening.\n\nRon Beres 45:21\n\nYou're hiding it well.\n\nAli Landry 45:23\n\nBut it is that like, I feel when I do a full clean out and literally go drawer by drawer. I feel like I can conquer the world. I was actually just thinking, you know, I'm watching the home edit. I don't know if you're watching it, it's on Netflix right now. The new season of the home edited, these girls are out in Nashville, and they are organizers and they are incredible. So, I'm getting like the motivation. I'm going to watch this, okay, we gotta we gotta watch it. Everybody's they do everybody. It's amazing. So, I just feel like I know how I feel when I do it. It's just carving out that time and doing one little area at a time. Definitely. I mean, start with a drawer, start with your, you know, start with that junk drawer in the kitchen are something that's a little bit easier to tackle. And also, like, I feel like making spaces in your house, like my little meditation space is a little bit like that. That's why I have it in a corner I have facing a window, where I'm seeing green, I'm not seeing the clutter that's on that side, I just have beautiful things around me and that space like simple things. It just allows your mind to open up and then again, like take in all that positivity and good thoughts and be grateful and all of that without all the distractions,\n\nLisa Beres 46:41\n\nthere's a famous quote, have nothing in your home that you don't deem to be useful or beautiful. And I think that's really true, right? If you go through and say, am I using it? Or does it make me happy? If not donate it.\n\nRon Beres 46:52\n\nWell, before we leave, I want to talk about your new book coming out in 2023 Congratulations, by the way, on that,\n\nLisa Beres 46:57\n\ncongratulations on that.
