        "text": "Alejandro Monteverde (birthname: José Alejandro Gómez Monteverde) is a Mexican-born director/writer/producer who has worked largely in American independent cinema. Monteverde’s debut feature was the anti-abortion-themed Bella (2006), co-written by him and Patrick Million, and co-starring Eduardo Verástegui (who was also a producer, along with Monteverde) and Tammy Blanchard, and grossing $12 million (on a $3.3 million budget) after winning the Toronto film festival’s People’s Choice Award.\n\nMonteverde’s second feature was the critically lambasted WWII drama, Little Boy (2015), co-starring Jakob Salvati, Emily Watson, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, Michael Rapaport, Verástegui (again a producer as well), Ben Chaplin, and Tom Wilkinson, and lost money for distributors Open Road Films and Videocine with a $17.7 million global gross.\n\nMonteverde co-wrote (with Rod Barr) and directed the controversial box-office hit, Sound of Freedom (2023), starring Jim Caviezel, Mira Sorvino, and Bill Camp, grossing a knockout $250.6 million (on a $14.5 million budget) for indie distributor Angel Studios but earning a contentious reputation for its dramatization of ideas held in the QAnon conspiracy movement."
