        "text": "My husband and I have been married for over 10 years now and we have 3 incredible little miracles. I thank God every day for bringing my husband into my life. I was coming off of a terrible heartbreak and betrayal in my previous relationship and I really prayed for God to bring someone into my life who would hold my heart so tenderly in his hands. I feel like my husband was my gift from God, but with that said, I still have to work on my relationship with him and my marriage consistently. I don’t want to use the word “work” in a negative way either. I look at “work” as fun, exciting and an opportunity to take our relationship and our connection to another level. I know that life is busy and with three children with needs of their own my husband is not always at the top of my list, but he is always there and nurturing our relationship is something I always keep on my mind.\n\nHere are some great little reminders and some of my favorite books that help me to put my focus back on my marriage.\n\nBooks:\n\nThe Power of a Praying Wife by Stormie Omartian\n\nThe Love Dare by Stephen Kendrick and Alex Kendrick\n\nThe Five Love Languages by Gary Chapman\n\nQuotes I love:\n\n“A great relationship doesn’t happen because of the love you had in the beginning, but how well you continue building love until the end” – Unknown\n\n“We charge our cell phones daily but let our marriages die. If your smart phone receives more daily charging than your spouse, then you’re spending way too much time talking to the wrong people.” marriage365.org\n\n“Love your spouse more than you love your career, hobbies and money. That other stuff can’t love you back” – Dave Willis\n\n“Great marriages don’t happen by luck or by accident. They are the result of a consistent investment of time, thoughtfulness,forgiveness, affection, prayer, mutual respect and a rock-solid commitment between a husband and wife.” Dave Willis\n\n“A good marriage isn’t something you find, its something you make… and you have to keep on making it” – Gary Thomas"
