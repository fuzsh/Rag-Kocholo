        "text": "A week on from HLTH Europe in Amsterdam and Katy Fryatt, Henry Stoneley & Lina Behrens captured the European healthtech ecosystem's energy & opportunity so perfectly. 3 reasons I am excited about the future of European health tech: 1. The community is brilliant - AlbionVC were delighted to host our European/US mixer on Monday evening with Dominick Kennerson (HSBC Innovation Banking) & Ian Coyne (Coulter Partners) & we ran one of our HealthTech Breakfast Club sessions on Wednesday morning for the investor community. European collaboration across industry, academia, investor & start up communities will enable some of the most exciting innovations of the future. This was clear when moderating the Startup Pitch final with C√©dric Odje. Our capital efficiency & single-payor, state funded systems can drive outcome & value based innovations. We loved connecting with a number of European & US health systems during the week - even more collaboration is needed between health systems, providers & payors with the innovators & investors to ensure we are all pointing at the biggest needs (& opportunities) in healthcare. 2. We are beginning to understand the different 'recipes' for approaching market expansion, depending on your core 'IP' or differentiated offering. I moderated a panel on \"Is healthtech an investable vertical in Europe\" with Maximilian Waldmann (Eterno Health), Martin Ratz (Doccla), Inga D. (Molten Ventures) & Simon Cartmell OBE. We agreed that understanding your core differentiation is key for market expansion & exit planning but that even single European geos can build big businesses if you capture enough of the value chain. The US opportunity was also a very live discussion throughout the week - Andrew Elder moderated a brilliant panel on US scaling, & Christoph Ruedig and I presented the AlbionVC framework for considering US market expansion with brilliant insights from our panel - Jennifer Scanlon (Northwell Health) & Matt Meyers (Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati). 3. There is a big opportunity in understanding how services can enable your tech & tech can enable your service! The service offering in both digital care & digital pharma can get you in the door but also can allow you to capture more of the value chain. AI is enabling significant operational efficiencies too meaning some of the tech-enabled service companies may be the European unicorns of the future! üî• Back to porridge (& a heatwave!üòç) this week & I am excited for the opportunities we have in European healthtech. Inspired by some great conversations & content (Pam Garside, Penny Dash, Michelle Tempest, Bay Gross, Peter Hames, Dominic King MD PhD, Daniel Dickens, Indra Joshi, Dr. Nadine Hachach-Haram FRCS (Plast), BEM, Umang Patel, James O'Shaughnessy, Stephen Johnson, Dr Harpreet Sood, Dr Saira Ghafur, Maxine Mackintosh, Travis Laird, Emily Reiser) to name just a few & many great friends in the industry. Thank you HLTH Europe, next June can't come soon enough!\n\nExcited to be back on home ground this week in Belfast with big thanks to Gary Davidson for all his organisation and collaboration! I will be at the Founder Labs x Queen's University Belfast event tomorrow being hosted at Kainos 12.30pm-2pm and then will be spending time in the afternoon at Ormeau Baths for office hours sessions with some great companies. I am also around this week at a number of events with clinical entrepreneurs and meet ups with other VCs and founders focused on health tech and deep tech. If you are a NI-based founder and keen to catch up then let me know! HBAN Ormeau Baths Invest Northern Ireland Clarendon Fund Managers Techstart Ventures LLP\n\nA great end to February with this month's edition of the HealthTech Breakfast Club at Eight Roads focused on \"Scaling in health tech - from leadership teams to M&A\". We had a stellar panel made up of Dr. Ben Maruthappu (CEO, Cera), Michael Treskow (Partner, Eight Roads), Mong-Trang Sarrazin (CFO, Unmind), Ian Coyne (Partner, Coulter Partners). The discussion covered loads of content and it was great to hear Ben's experience scaling Cera to today's scale, and Mong-Trang‚Äôs experience both at Unmind and also in previous roles including CFO at Doctolib from an early stage (one of the few European health tech unicorns). We also looked at Coulter Partners' latest research focused on the key traits in digital health CEOs and the risk profile they have seen in their research, along with their experience in supporting scale ups creating outstanding leadership teams. A few short takeaways that I found really interesting: üí° Adaptability in the leadership is key - both to macro trends and to growth challenges as the business scales. üí° Domain expertise, particularly in the finance function, is essential even at quite an early stage in order to weigh up important decisions for both organic and inorganic growth, and can build credibility with your investors (equity and debt). üí° Unit economics are key to scaling - laser focus on CAC/CLTV for organic growth and understanding in detail the economics of any acquisition opportunity is key - these are \"maths problems\" and focusing on the data and scenario planning behind these big decisions sounds obvious but it really is critical üí° M&A can be used for market expansion or product development - understanding the purpose is essential to recognise the integration challenges - tech stack, people and culture, or recognising the risk is purely about execution. üí° Founders that choose to build in health tech have an interesting risk profile - often more willing to go against the status quo than other sectors but it is essential they focus early in the journey on building a leadership team around them that can help achieve the big vision. Thanks to everyone in the room and for the great questions and discussion! Looking forward to the launch of our TechBio chapter in March led by the wonderful Leigh Brody.

Held with Julia Hawkins at LocalGlobe, it is a topic I have been thinking about for years - 'Healthtech x fintech - Is omnichannel reimbursement the future for healthcare?' Thank you to the outstanding panel who really took this conversation to the next level: üí° Nader AlSalim - Founder & CEO, Gaia üí° Dr Nikita Kanani MBE - Director of Clinical Integration, NHS England üí° Sneh Khemka - previously Simply Health, Aetna, BUPA üí° Ruchi Sharma - VP Enterprise Strategy, American Express üí° Dr. Ali H. - CCO, Vitality Some take home messages: üß† It is important to really understand the differences between the care provision across PMI, cash plans, insurance for specific disease areas, self pay, public health systems - from inpatient vs outpatient, acute/emergency vs chronic, preventative vs reactive - it is different and it affects pathways üß† All models for pricing risk are dependent on the data that feeds them - we aren't going to move away from actuarial approaches quickly even though healthcare is inherently more dynamic. Ultimately, the pricing and underwriting can be separated out, as in other industries, where pricing becomes more tech enabled & patient (customer) engaged, whilst the underwriting relies on the economics e.g., reliable loss ratios üß† We can learn lots in healthcare from the best of fintech startups - many of which achieved what they did through 1) excellent customer front end to the complex back office, and 2) starting by solving specific pain points along the value chain üß† We need to be cautious of patients falling between gaps if they mix and match different pathways of reimbursement (and therefore care provision) and health equity starts to become a really important consideration - healthcare for the many not the few üß† Understanding incentives is essential - there is potentially a disconnect in employers evolving as creating future reimbursement packages for care and yet they are potentially the least incentivised for an individual patient's long term health outcomes As you can tell from the photo below, we didn't solve the question of healthcare reimbursement channels in 45 minutes but the level of live problem solving / insightful and experienced conversation / collaboration between many different stakeholders made me excited for what is to come and the role technology can play. #omnichannelpondering üí´ üì∏ credit - Chris Wigley\n\nVery excited to launch this year‚Äôs European HealthTech market map and great to present it this morning with Christoph Ruedig at Frontiers Health in Rome! With 998 companies in this year‚Äôs map, the market map is significantly larger (in terms of number of companies) than last year with AI driving significant growth across digital care (diagnostics and clinical decision support, provider software) and digital pharma (tech bio, syn bio) segments. It was also super interesting working with Melika Moghim to get into the detail of the companies in the map - exploring their geographic expansion and funding dynamics. With over ‚Ç¨5 billion invested across the companies in this market map in the last 3 years, I am excited to see the leaders that emerge.\n\nGreat session yesterday at the October edition of the HealthTech Breakfast Club held at Creandum focusing on Digital Pharma - which parts of the clinical trial value chain are ripe for disruption? Our panel to lead the discussion included: üß† Meri Beckwith, Co-founder, Lindus Health üß† Furat Shawki, Head of Clinical Trials, NuvoAir üß† Dr. Myles Furnace, VP Commercial, Closed Loop Medicine üß† Gemma Bloemen, Principal, Creandum The conversation was really interesting with discussion about the clinical trial value chain and the many organisations involved in different parts - Meri Beckwith made some great points about how Lindus Health are thinking about the workflow first rather than the organisations which enables great efficiency gains in the trials they run. Great to understand from Gemma Bloemen the Creandum thesis on digital pharma, why they are so excited about Lindus and where they are looking for new opportunities. Furat Shawki had some brilliant insights about how important patient retention is rather than just patient recruitment and the role technology can have in process simplification for both the patient and also the trial sites. Technology can also enable not just better patient adherence to PROMs (patient reported outcome measures) but also gather additional data in the background that can be useful. I also was super intrigued by the conversation led by Dr. Myles Furnace on digital biomarkers and the complexity in their use as trial end points when many of them have not been validated individually/in combination for different indications and outcomes. Many of the end points that clinical trials optimise for are based on the 'gold standard' guideline from decades ago. Fascinating to understand the role the regulator can actually play in innovation too rather than a CRO which is often less financially incentivised to be efficient. A pretty technical and deep session but great to hear lots of different perspectives and get excited about the opportunities in this space for health tech start ups. Huge thanks to Gemma and Holly Eldridge for hosting us and brilliant seeing a mixture of familiar and new faces as always - looking forward to November at LocalGlobe! Olivia Brooks Pranav V. Helena Barman Estia Ryan Alexander Breeden ÂÆâÊæú Issy Gordon Ritika Pai Chantal Cox Matthieu Vallin Tony Besse Katherine Jones Namrata Turaga, MD MBA Daria Gherghelas Jamie Tomalin Will Briggs Piers Clark Nikolas Koenning AlbionVC\n\nFeet are firmly back on London ground on return from the US and HLTH conference which was absolutely fantastic - amazing panels and content, great networking with old friends and lots of new connections, and a chance to spend time with the AlbionVC healthcare team brainstorming and challenging our thinking. Some of my reflections: üåé The US market is huge but it also is really competitive - European companies wanting to enter and scale in the US need to be laser focused about differentiating their value proposition to maximise their chances of success üè• Delivering cost-effective whilst high quality healthcare is a knotty problem in every geography - the best care for an individual often does not correlate with the most effective resource allocation across a population of patients üí∞ Value based care requires new workflows not just new reimbursement structures - only 1% of US healthcare is actually VBC... it is going to take some time üë©‚öïÔ∏è Many healthcare problems are not just 'health' or the 'bio' bit - thinking about the psycho and social elements is essential to really think about care preventatively e.g., repairing a porch at a house entrance could be a much better use of resources than dealing with a fractured hip when they fall üë®üíª Software will not solve all our problems and one of the reasons many tech-enabled care providers have achieved true disruption is because they are using tech to deliver more effective and efficient services... üè∞ The European ecosystem is really exciting and it was great to share ideas with some amazing industry leaders like Pam Garside, Dominic King MD PhD, Dr. Myles Furnace, European health tech investors Javier Nunez-Vicandi, C√©dric Odje, Johannes Blaschke, Christopher Britton, Tanja Dowe, Nicolas Stalder, Heather Roxborough, Joao Barbosa da Silva and many European founders entering and scaling in the US. I am so excited for HLTH Europe in Amsterdam in June 2024! It was awesome to get a flavour for it with our HLTH Europe x AlbionVC European mixer on the Sunday night at HLTH Vegas - it is always a pleasure working with the amazing team Henry Stoneley Lina Behrens Katy Fryatt Anisha Patel Ben Driscoll Charlotte M. Speaking of which...tickets are online and prices go up tonight, October 20th at midnight. You can also get a ‚Ç¨150 discount with code HE24_MOLLYG."
