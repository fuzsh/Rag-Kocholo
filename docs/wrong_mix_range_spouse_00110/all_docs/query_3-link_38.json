        "text": "Ali Landry spoke about for the first time about her father-in-law and brother-in-law who were murdered in Mexico last month.\n\nLandry shared a picture of her father-in-law, Juan Manuel Gómez Fernández, and brother-in-law, Juan Manuel Gómez Monteverde on WhoSay writing, \"I want to thank all of you for your love, support and prayers during this time of grief.\"\n\nShe continued, \"Yes, the events surrounding my family were tragic and what has happened will profoundly affect our lives forever. But my Father in Law was the kind of man that radiated pure joy and it was infectious. He loved and adored his family more than anything. He was a jokester, a great dancer, a crier (especially when he was talking about his sons), and he lived his life in the present, appreciating each moment as a huge blessing. He was my husbands hero and like my second Dad.\"\n\nShe wrote of her brother-in-law, \"My brother in law was such a hard working business owner. He was an incredible salsa dancer, he was fluent in Japanese and we all looked up to him. When things became dangerous in Tampico a few years ago he moved his family to Estonia, Guadalajara, and then Mcallen Texas just to keep them safe. He was a wonderful friend, an amazing husband, and a great father to his two beautiful children.\"\n\nLandry's in-laws were found dead Sept. 19 in Mexico. They were held hostage for a little more than two weeks after they were kidnapped outside their home Sept. 4 and held for ransom. A ransom was reportedly paid, but the kidnappers killed the victims."
