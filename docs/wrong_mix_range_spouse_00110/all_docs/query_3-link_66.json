        "text": "Ali Landry is searching for stability; she wants to find a firm, unchanging structure for her life. But her efforts to achieve this ideal are often vain, because unconsciously, she is also inhabited by the opposite desire. Every time she reaches what she believes to be a good balance, she realizes she wants something entirely different. She would do well to become aware that the concepts of stability and balance are difficult to apply to life. By definition, life is movement, change, and perpetual instability.\n\nAt the moment of your birth, the two celestial “lights” (the sun and the moon) were perfectly aligned. This is a sign of harmony between the masculine and feminine archetypes, which is beneficial for your personality. It is the source of balance and understanding between the two main psychological realms which compose your personality. You enjoy a positive complementarity and understanding between the conscious and unconscious aspects of your psyche, between your determination and your routines, between your drive for self-assertion and your receptivity, your ideal and your sensitivity. Your parents almost certainly reflected a positive image of the marriage relationship to you, and it is likely that they encouraged you to develop your own individuality. As a result, you were and are able to be comfortable with yourself as you are instead of striving to attain your parents’ ideal. This has definitely contributed to the maintenance of a good relationship with them and the rest of the family. In your emotional relationships with your peers, one of the effects of the masculine/feminine harmony is that the images your ego projects on the other are especially constructive. The bonds of the relationship are not felt to be constraints, the energy which flows between the two people is a source of mutual happiness, not regret. No major personal conflicts are projected onto the “other” – that is, the significant other.\n\nAli Landry tends to have a profound and fertile inner life, but her energy resources are not always sufficient to follow through on and accomplish her multitude of dreams. She tends to live in osmosis with her environment, and effort and action take a heavy toll on her. Usually, she understands phenomena and events intuitively, without really making any effort; so she is not in the habit of disciplining or shaping her thought processes. Like her thoughts, her personality is rather amorphous and disorganized. As a result of this lack of structure, she may have some trouble asserting her individuality and making some personal contribution to society through her career. Her tendency to shut out reality and dream impossible dreams, like her refusal of responsibility and duty, may be a source of some difficulty for her.\n\nAli Landry is lively and expressive, with a personality that is sometimes agitated but straightforward. Unconscious feelings of insecurity compel her to act and sometimes to seek the admiration of others. As a result, she is unable to bear idleness and routine, and she is in search of perpetual excitement. Her reactions to others are highly individual and depend on the mood she is in at any given moment. A person of decision, a businessperson or an athlete, she often personifies boldness and impetuosity. Her love life is liable to be fiery, as it obeys the imperatives of her desire for freedom and independence, and her need for change.\n\nAli Landry is optimistic and happy to be alive. She is cheerful, expansive, and pleasant to be around. She is very generous (sometimes to a fault!) and gives of herself and her belongings unreservedly. This positive psychological outlook is the result of a happy childhood and especially an extremely beneficial maternal influence in infancy. Ali Landry is likely to be a professional success; her vision of the world is perfectly adapted to prevailing opinion, and her urges and desires for personal expansion usually elicit a positive reaction from society. By old age, her good reputation and prominence may have earned her fame.\n\nAli Landry has a sensitive and imaginative mind that can be a source of inspiration for creativity and spiritual evolution, but it can also be less helpful and positive when it comes to matters of earning a living in the real world. In a relationship, Ali is extremely romantic and may not see others the way they really are. She has elegant tastes and her favorite things in life are beauty and art.\n\nAli Landry has fairly lofty amorous aspirations. The soulmate she imagines for herself is brilliant and dazzling with an array of talents and beauty. However, the gap between her splendid ideal and reality is sometimes wide. She should be careful not to confuse her romantic ideal with reality and become aware that her tendency to project may be a way of fleeing from herself.\n\nAli Landry’s birth chart indicates an emotional function which is usually expressed carefully and reasonably. Distrustful of her emotional urges and somewhat wary of her feelings, she tries to rid herself of all partiality and try to get some perspective and distance before making an emotional commitment.\n\nAli Landry is constantly subject to nervous tension which wears her out and exhausts her. Her mind and body are always feverishly active. She tends to do too much, to become obsessed with insignificant details, or to panic when faced with the unexpected. She is likely to marry a partner who’s younger than her, either chronologically or in terms of their sense of duty. But perhaps her second marriage will be more reasonable and satisfying.\n\nAli Landry’s energy and dynamism are the secret of her power of attraction and amorous conquests. She is hungry for admiration and want the person she loves to worship her. Noble, generous, and loyal as a lover, she may nevertheless go about it her own way. She is especially mindful of her prestige and will seek out a partner worthy of her greatness. Her pride may sometimes trip her up in this respect. However, once she has made up her mind, she will be the best of spouses and, if she chooses to have children, the most devoted of parents.\n\nAli Landry is cautious and reserved by nature. You are sometimes unwilling to open yourself to others if you are not sure of being accepted. You will always hang back somewhat from your emotional urges, parceling out your expressions of affection, because you have learned – sometimes at your expense – that even the most harmonious relationships require some compromise. For you, “good fences make good neighbors,” and well-marked boundaries can prevent future suffering. Thus, even when you are in love, you remain fairly circumspect. When you find yourself attracted to a partner, you privately engage in a careful analysis of their personality and life story, endeavoring to know them profoundly, to see whether you are likely to be able to share your life and future with them. As a result of your sensitivity, you have a profound affinity for all of the arts. Music, literature, painting, and graphic arts are likely to enrich your existence and make it pleasant. You could progress in any career in which balance, order, and practicality predominate.\n\nAli Landry’s intellect is simultaneously subjective and sensitive, acute and intuitive, always practical and deeply rooted in human experience. With her memory and imagination combined with her shrewdness, Ali would be a gifted project manager, businesswoman, or scholar of history or literature.\n\nAli Landry thinks carefully before speaking, preferring to mull things over before voicing her opinions. She is introverted and prefers to rely on her own intuition when it comes to solving problems. Because she mistrusts traditional thought processes, her opinion is usually based on her own personal experiences."
