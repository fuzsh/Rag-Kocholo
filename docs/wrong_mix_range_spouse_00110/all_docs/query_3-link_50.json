        "text": "Ali Landry is remaining tight-lipped about a family tragedy that became public this week. But local reports paint a grueling picture of the events leading up to the murder of her father-in-law and brother-in-law.\n\nManuel Gomez Fernedez and his son, Juan Juan Manuel Gómez Monteverde were kidnapped September 4th, after leaving Tampico, Tamaulipas— an area known to dangerous gang activity, according to The Latin Times. A report of their disappearance was filed in Mexico City with special prosecutor for organized crime investigations, SEIDO.\n\nOmar Zuniga, spokesman for the Veracruz state prosecutor’s office, said Thursday that the investigation into the slayings continues.\n\nIn a statement to PEOPLE magazine, Veracruz state prosecutor Luis Angel Bravo Contreras said the father son duo both sustained traumatic brain injuries and were dead for several days before they were discovered in a rural area, El Chachalaco— in the municipality of Pueblo Viejo in Northern Veracruz on September 19th.\n\nThe Veracruz Attorney General’s Office issued a statement explaining that the police are doing forensic testing on a car that they suspect the kidnappers used. It had license plates from the neighboring state of Tamaulipas, which borders Texas.\n\nThe deceased are father and brother to film director and Landry’s husband, Alejandro Gomez Monteverde, who directed the film, “Little Boy.” Producer of the film, Eduardo Verastegui, expressed his condolences on Twitter writing: “With a heart full of pain and sadness, I ask for prayers for my friend and ‘compadre’ Alejandro Gomez Monteverde and all of his family. My deepest condolences to my soul brother, I love you so much ‘compadre,’ I put my heart in your hands and I join you in this deep pain.”\n\nLandry, former Miss USA 1996 and mother of three, attended the Red CARPet Safety Awareness Event in Los Angeles on September 19th, celebrating Child Safety Month.\n\nA rep for Landry declined to comment at this time.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."
