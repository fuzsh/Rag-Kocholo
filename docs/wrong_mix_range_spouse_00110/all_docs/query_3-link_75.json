        "text": "Ali Landry's father-in-law and brother-in-law were found dead last weekend in Mexico, after being held hostage for more than two weeks, the Latin Times reports.\n\nThe bodies of Juan Manuel Gomez Fernandez and Juan Manuel Gomez Monteverde - the father and brother of director Alejandro Gomez Monteverde, Landry's husband - were discovered in Veracruz on Sept. 19. Both had apparently suffered fatal wounds to the head.\n\nThe two men were reported missing after they were kidnapped outside of their home on Sept. 4. According to reports, their family met the kidnappers' demands for ransom, but the two were murdered anyway. The Latin Times reports that Juan Manuel Gomez Monteverde was a business partner at a restaurant in Tampico that has alleged ties to drug cartels."
