        "text": "Terrain-analysis procedures for modeling radar backscatter\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSchaber, Gerald G.; Pike, Richard J.; Berlin, Graydon Lennis\n\n1978-01-01\n\nThe collection and analysis of detailed information on the surface of natural terrain are important aspects of radar-backscattering modeling. Radar is especially sensitive to surface-relief changes in the millimeter- to-decimeter scale four conventional K-band (~1-cm wavelength) to L-band (~25-cm wavelength) radar systems. Surface roughness statistics that characterize these changes in detail have been generated by a comprehensive set of seven programmed calculations for radar-backscatter modeling from sets of field measurements. The seven programs are 1) formatting of data in readable form for subsequent topographic analysis program; 2) relief analysis; 3) power spectral analysis; 4) power spectrum plots; 5) slope angle between slope reversals; 6) slope angle against slope interval plots; and 7) base length slope angle and curvature. This complete Fortran IV software package, 'Terrain Analysis', is here presented for the first time. It was originally developed a decade ago for investigations of lunar morphology and surface trafficability for the Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle.\n\nRelating multifrequency radar backscattering to forest biomass: Modeling and AIRSAR measurement\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSun, Guo-Qing; Ranson, K. Jon\n\n1992-01-01\n\nDuring the last several years, significant efforts in microwave remote sensing were devoted to relating forest parameters to radar backscattering coefficients. These and other studies showed that in most cases, the longer wavelength (i.e. P band) and cross-polarization (HV) backscattering had higher sensitivity and better correlation to forest biomass. This research examines this relationship in a northern forest area through both backscatter modeling and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data analysis. The field measurements were used to estimate stand biomass from forest weight tables. The backscatter model described by Sun et al. was modified to simulate the backscattering coefficients with respect to stand biomass. The average number of trees per square meter or radar resolution cell, and the average tree height or diameter breast height (dbh) in the forest stand are the driving parameters of the model. The rest of the soil surface, orientation, and size distributions of leaves and branches, remain unchanged in the simulations.\n\nCalculations of radar backscattering coefficient of vegetation-covered soils\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMo, T.; Schmugge, T. J.; Jackson, T. J. (Principal Investigator)\n\n1983-01-01\n\nA model for simulating the measured backscattering coefficient of vegetation-covered soil surfaces includes both coherent and incoherent components of the backscattered radar pulses from a rough sil surface. The effect of vegetation canopy scattering is also incorporated into the model by making the radar pulse subject to two-way attenuation and volume scattering when it passes through the vegetation layer. Model results agree well with the measured angular distributions of the radar backscattering coefficient for HH polarization at the 1.6 GHz and 4.75 GHz frequencies over grass-covered fields. It was found that the coherent scattering component is very important at angles near nadir, while the vegetation volume scattering is dominant at incident angles 30 degrees.\n\nTheoretical and experimental models of the diffuse radar backscatter from Mars\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nEngland, A. W.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nThe general objective for this work was to develop a theoretically and experimentally consistent explanation for the diffuse component of radar backscatter from Mars. The strength, variability, and wavelength independence of Mars' diffuse backscatter are unique among our Moon and the terrestrial planets. This diffuse backscatter is generally attributed to wavelength-scale surface roughness and to rock clasts within the Martian regolith. Through the combination of theory and experiment, the authors attempted to bound the range of surface characteristics that could produce the observed diffuse backscatter. Through these bounds they gained a limited capability for data inversion. Within this umbrella, specific objectives were: (1) To better define the statistical roughness parameters of Mars' surface so that they are consistent with observed radar backscatter data, and with the physical and chemical characteristics of Mars' surface as inferred from Mariner 9, the Viking probes, and Earth-based spectroscopy; (2) To better understand the partitioning between surface and volume scattering in the Mars regolith; (3) To develop computational models of Mars' radio emission that incorporate frequency dependent, surface and volume scattering.\n\nA three-part geometric model to predict the radar backscatter from wheat, corn, and sorghum\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nUlaby, F. T. (Principal Investigator); Eger, G. W., III; Kanemasu, E. T.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nA model to predict the radar backscattering coefficient from crops must include the geometry of the canopy. Radar and ground-truth data taken on wheat in 1979 indicate that the model must include contributions from the leaves, from the wheat head, and from the soil moisture. For sorghum and corn, radar and ground-truth data obtained in 1979 and 1980 support the necessity of a soil moisture term and a leaf water term. The Leaf Area Index (LAI) is an appropriate input for the leaf contribution to the radar response for wheat and sorghum, however the LAI generates less accurate values for the backscattering coefficient for corn. Also, the data for corn and sorghum illustrate the importance of the water contained in the stalks in estimating the radar response.\n\nKu-band ocean radar backscatter observations during SWADE\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNghiem, S. V.; Li, F. K.; Lou, S. H.; Neumann, G.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nWe present results obtained by an airborne Ku-band scatterometer during the Surface Wave Dynamics Experiment (SWADE). The specific objective of this study is to improve our understanding of the relationship between ocean radar backscatter and near surface winds. The airborne scatterometer, NUSCAT, was flown on the NASA Ames C-130 over an instrumented oceanic area near 37 deg N and 74 deg W. A total of 10 flights from 27 Feb. to 9 Mar. 1991 were conducted. Radar backscatter at incidence angles of 0 to 60 deg were obtained. For each incidence angle, the NUSCAT antenna was azimuthally scanned in multiple complete circles to measure the azimuthal backscatter modulations. Both horizontal and vertical polarization backscatter measurements were made. In some of the flights, the cross-polarization backscatter was measured as well. Internal calibrations were carried out throughout each of the flights. Preliminary results indicate that the radar was stable to +/-0.3 dB for each flight. In this paper, we present studies of the backscatter measurements over several crossings of the Gulf Stream. In these crossings, large air-sea temperature differences were encountered and substantial changes in the radar cross section were observed. We summarize the observations and compare them to the changes of several wind variables across the Gulf Stream boundary. In one of the flights, the apparent wind near the cold side of the Gulf Stream was very low (less than 3 m/s). The behavior of the radar cross sections at such low wind speeds and a comparison with models are presented. A case study of the effects of swell on the absolute cross section and the azimuthal modulation pattern is presented. Significant wave heights larger than m were observed during SWADE. The experimentally observed effects of the swell on the radar backscatter are discussed. The effects are used to assess the uncertainties in wind retrieval due to underlying waves. A summary of azimuthal modulation from our ten\n\nSurface Parameters of Titan Feature Classes From Cassini RADAR Backscatter Measurements\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWye, L. C.; Zebker, H. A.; Lopes, R. M.; Peckyno, R.; Le Gall, A.; Janssen, M. A.\n\n2008-12-01\n\nMultimode microwave measurements collected by the Cassini RADAR instrument during the spacecraft's first four years of operation form a fairly comprehensive set of radar backscatter data over a variety of Titan surface features. We use the real-aperture scatterometry processor to analyze the entire collection of active data, creating a uniformly-calibrated dataset that covers 93% of Titan's surface at a variety of viewing angles. Here, we examine how the measured backscatter response (radar reflectivity as a function of incidence angle) varies with surface feature type, such as dunes, cryovolcanic areas, and anomalous albedo terrain. We identify the feature classes using a combination of maps produced by the RADAR, ISS, and VIMS instruments. We then derive surface descriptors including roughness, dielectric constant, and degree of volume scatter. Radar backscatter on Titan is well-modeled as a superposition of large-scale surface scattering (quasispecular scattering) together with a combination of small-scale surface scattering and subsurface volume scattering (diffuse scattering). The viewing geometry determines which scattering mechanism is strongest. At low incidence angles, quasispecular scatter dominates the radar backscatter return. At higher incidence angles (angles greater than ~30Â°), diffuse scatter dominates the return. We use a composite model to separate the two scattering regimes; we model the quasispecular term with a combination of two traditional backscatter laws (we consider the Hagfors, Gaussian, and exponential models), following a technique developed by Sultan-Salem and Tyler [1], and we model the diffuse term, which encompasses both diffuse mechanisms, with a simple cosine power law. Using this total composite model, we analyze the backscatter curves of all features classes on Titan for which we have adequate angular coverage. In most cases, we find that the superposition of the Hagfors law with the exponential law best models the\n\nInfluence of tundra snow layer thickness on measured and modelled radar backscatter\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRutter, N.; Sandells, M. J.; Derksen, C.; King, J. M.; Toose, P.; Wake, L. M.; Watts, T.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nMicrowave radar backscatter within a tundra snowpack is strongly influenced by spatial variability of the thickness of internal layering. Arctic tundra snowpacks often comprise layers consisting of two dominant snow microstructures; a basal depth hoar layer overlain by a layer of wind slab. Occasionally there is also a surface layer of decomposing fresh snow. The two main layers have strongly different microwave scattering properties. Depth hoar has a greater capacity for scattering electromagnetic energy than wind slab, however, wind slab usually has a larger snow water equivalent (SWE) than depth hoar per unit volume due to having a higher density. So, determining the relative proportions of depth hoar and wind slab from a snowpack of a known depth may help our future capacity to invert forward models of electromagnetic backscatter within a data assimilation scheme to improve modelled estimates of SWE. Extensive snow measurements were made within Trail Valley Creek, NWT, Canada in April 2013. Snow microstructure was measured at 18 pit and 9 trench locations throughout the catchment (trench extent ranged between 5 to 50 m). Ground microstructure measurements included traditional stratigraphy, near infrared stratigraphy, Specific Surface Area (SSA), and density. Coincident airborne Lidar measurements were made to estimate distributed snow depth across the catchment, in addition to airborne radar snow backscatter using a dual polarized (VV/VH) X- and Ku-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SnowSAR). Ground measurements showed the mean proportion of depth hoar was just under 30% of total snow depth and was largely unresponsive to increasing snow depth. The mean proportion of wind slab is consistently greater than 50% and showed an increasing trend with increasing total snow depth. A decreasing trend in the mean proportion of surface snow (approximately 25% to 10%) with increasing total depth accounted for this increase in wind slab. This new knowledge of variability in\n\nEffects of vegetation canopy on the radar backscattering coefficient\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMo, T.; Blanchard, B. J.; Schmugge, T. J.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nAirborne L- and C-band scatterometer data, taken over both vegetation-covered and bare fields, were systematically analyzed and theoretically reproduced, using a recently developed model for calculating radar backscattering coefficients of rough soil surfaces. The results show that the model can reproduce the observed angular variations of radar backscattering coefficient quite well via a least-squares fit method. Best fits to the data provide estimates of the statistical properties of the surface roughness, which is characterized by two parameters: the standard deviation of surface height, and the surface correlation length. In addition, the processes of vegetation attenuation and volume scattering require two canopy parameters, the canopy optical thickness and a volume scattering factor. Canopy parameter values for individual vegetation types, including alfalfa, milo and corn, were also determined from the best-fit results. The uncertainties in the scatterometer data were also explored.\n\nIncidence angle normalization of radar backscatter data\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nNASAâs Soil Moisture Passive Active (SMAP) satellite (~2014) will include a radar system that will provide L-band multi-polarization backscatter at a constant incidence angle of 40Âº.

For 95 GHz radars, the reflectivity of backscattering is expected to increase by 2 dB, due to multiple scattering including backscattering enhancement, for water droplets of diameter of 1 mm with a density of 5 x 103 m-3. Previous theoretical studies of backscattering enhancement considered infinitely extending plane waves. In this paper, we expand the theory to spherical waves with a Gaussian antenna pattern, including depolarizing effects. While the differences from the plane wave results are not great when the optical thickness is small, as the latter increases the differences become significant, and essentially depend on the ratio of radar footprint radius to the mean free path of hydrometeors. In this regime, for a radar footprint that is smaller than the mean free path, the backscattering-enhancement reflectivity corresponding to spherical waves is significantly less pronounced than in the case of the plane wave theory. Hence this reduction factor must be taken into account when analyzing radar reflectivity factors for use in remote sensing applications.\n\nA microwave backscattering model for precipitation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nErmis, Seda\n\nA geophysical microwave backscattering model for space borne and ground-based remote sensing of precipitation is developed and used to analyze backscattering measurements from rain and snow type precipitation. Vector Radiative Transfer (VRT) equations for a multilayered inhomogeneous medium are applied to the precipitation region for calculation of backscattered intensity. Numerical solution of the VRT equation for multiple layers is provided by the matrix doubling method to take into account close range interactions between particles. In previous studies, the VRT model was used to calculate backscattering from a rain column on a sea surface. In the model, Mie scattering theory for closely spaced scatterers was used to determine the phase matrix for each sublayer characterized by a set of parameters. The scatterers i.e. rain drops within the sublayers were modelled as spheres with complex permittivities. The rain layer was bounded by rough boundaries; the interface between the cloud and the rain column as well as the interface between the sea surface and the rain were all analyzed by using the integral equation model (IEM). Therefore, the phase matrix for the entire rain column was generated by the combination of surface and volume scattering. Besides Mie scattering, in this study, we use T-matrix approach to examine the effect of the shape to the backscattered intensities since larger raindrops are most likely oblique in shape. Analyses show that the effect of obliquity of raindrops to the backscattered wave is related with size of the scatterers and operated frequency. For the ground-based measurement system, the VRT model is applied to simulate the precipitation column on horizontal direction. Therefore, the backscattered reflectivities for each unit range of volume are calculated from the backscattering radar cross sections by considering radar range and effective illuminated area of the radar beam. The volume scattering phase matrices for each range interval\n\nCentral Radar System, Over-the-Horizon Backscatter\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1990-03-09\n\n1,2-Dibromo-3- chloropropane (DBCP) 0.3 TABLE 41-6 (Continued).

K.\n\n1992-04-01\n\nThe subwindowing method of modelling synthetic-aperture-radar (SAR) imaging of ocean waves was extended to allow wave propagation in arbitrary directions. Simulated images show that the SAR image response to swells that are imaged by velocity bunching is reduced by random smearing due to wind-generated waves. The magnitude of this response is not accurately predicted by introducing a finite coherence time in the radar backscatter. The smearing does not affect the imaging of waves by surface radar cross-section modulation, and is independent of the wind direction. Adjusting the focus of the SAR processor introduces an offset in the image response of the surface scatters. When adjusted by one-half the azimuthal phase velocity of the wave, this compensates the incoherent advance of the wave being imaged, leading to a higher image contrast. The azimuthal cut-off and range rotation of the spectral peak are predicted when the imaging of wind-generated wave trains is simulated. The simulated images suggest that velocity bunching and azimuthal smearing are strongly interdependent, and cannot be included in a model separately.\n\nThe relationship between VHF radar auroral backscatter amplitude and Doppler velocity: a statistical study\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShand, B. A.; Lester, M.; Yeoman, T. K.\n\n1996-08-01\n\nA statistical investigation of the relationship between VHF radar auroral backscatter intensity and Doppler velocity has been undertaken with data collected from 8 years operation of the Wick site of the Sweden And Britain Radar-auroral Experiment (SABRE). The results indicate three different regimes within the statistical data set; firstly, for Doppler velocities <200 m s-1, the backscatter intensity (measured in decibels) remains relatively constant. Secondly, a linear relationship is observed between the backscatter intensity (in decibels) and Doppler velocity for velocities between 200 m s-1 and 700 m s-1. At velocities greater than 700 m s-1 the backscatter intensity saturates at a maximum value as the Doppler velocity increases. There are three possible geophysical mechanisms for the saturation in the backscatter intensity at high phase speeds: a saturation in the irregularity turbulence level, a maximisation of the scattering volume, and a modification of the local ambient electron density. There is also a difference in the dependence of the backscatter intensity on Doppler velocity for the flow towards and away from the radar. The results for flow towards the radar exhibit a consistent relationship between backscatter intensity and measured velocities throughout the solar cycle. For flow away from the radar, however, the relationship between backscatter intensity and Doppler velocity varies during the solar cycle. The geometry of the SABRE system ensures that flow towards the radar is predominantly associated with the eastward electrojet, and flow away is associated with the westward electrojet. The difference in the backscatter intensity variation as a function of Doppler velocity is attributed to asymmetries between the eastward and westward electrojets and the geophysical parameters controlling the backscatter amplitude.\n\nLong-term variation of radar-auroral backscatter and the interplanetary sector structure\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nYeoman, T.K.; Burrage, M.D.; Lester, M.\n\nRecurrent variation of geomagnetic activity at the {approximately}27-day solar rotation period and higher harmonics is a well-documented phenomenon. Auroral radar backscatter data from the Sweden and Britain Radar-Auroral Experiment (SABRE) radar provide a continuous time series from 1981 to the present which is a highly sensitive monitor of geomagnetic activity. In this study, Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) dynamic power spectra of SABRE backscatter data from 1981 to 1989, concurrent interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and solar wind parameters from 1981 to 1987, and the Kp index since 1932 are examined. Data since 1977 are compared with previously published heliospheric current sheetmoreÂ Â» measurements mapped out from the solar photosphere. Stong periodic behavior is observed in the radar backscatter during the declining phase of solar cycle 21, but this periodicity disappears at the start of solar cycle 22. Similar behavior is observed in earlier solar cycles in the Kp spectra. Details of the radar backscatter, IMF, and solar wind spectra indicate that the solar wind momentum density is the dominant parameter in determining the backscatter periodicity. The temporal evolution of two- and four-sector structures, as predicted by SABRE backscatter spectra, throughout solar cycle 21 generally still agree well with heliospheric current sheet measurements. For one interval, however, there is evidence that evolution of the current sheet has occurred between the photospheric source surface and the Earth.Â«Â less\n\nLikelihood parameter estimation for calibrating a soil moisture using radar backscatter\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nAssimilating soil moisture information contained in synthetic aperture radar imagery into land surface model predictions can be done using a calibration, or parameter estimation, approach.

An effective EM backscattering model for a one-dimensional drifting fractal sea surface is presented in this paper. This model is used to simulate EM backscattering signals from the drifting sea surface. Numerical results show that ocean currents have a significant influence on EM backscattering signals from the sea surface. The normalized radar cross section (NRCS) discrepancies between the model for a coupled wave-current fractal sea surface and the model for an uncoupled fractal sea surface increase with the increase of incidence angle, as well as with increasing ocean currents. Ocean currents that are parallel to the direction of the wave can weaken the EM backscattering signal intensity, while the EM backscattering signal is intensified by ocean currents propagating oppositely to the wave direction. The model presented in this paper can be used to study the SAR imaging mechanism for a drifting sea surface.

M.; Grosfils, E. B.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nOngoing mapping of the Ganiki Planitia (V14) quadrangle of Venus and definition of material units has involved an integrated but qualitative analysis of Magellan radar backscatter images and topography using standard geomorphological mapping techniques. However, such analyses do not take full advantage of the quantitative information contained within the images. Analysis of the backscatter coefficient allows a much more rigorous statistical comparison between mapped units, permitting first order selfsimilarity tests of geographically separated materials assigned identical geomorphological labels. Such analyses cannot be performed directly on pixel (DN) values from Magellan backscatter images, because the pixels are scaled to the Muhleman law for radar echoes on Venus and are not corrected for latitudinal variations in incidence angle. Therefore, DN values must be converted based on pixel latitude back to their backscatter coefficient values before accurate statistical analysis can occur. Here we present a method for performing the conversions and analysis of Magellan backscatter data using commonly available ArcGIS software and illustrate the advantages of the process for geological mapping.\n\nComparison of radar backscatter from Antarctic and Arctic sea ice\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHosseinmostafa, R.; Lytle, V.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nTwo ship-based step-frequency radars, one at C-band (5.3 GHz) and one at Ku-band (13.9 GHz), measured backscatter from ice in the Weddell Sea. Most of the backscatter data were from first-year (FY) and second-year (SY) ice at the ice stations where the ship was stationary and detailed snow and ice characterizations were performed. The presence of a slush layer at the snow-ice interface masks the distinction between FY and SY ice in the Weddell Sea, whereas in the Arctic the separation is quite distinct. The effect of snow-covered ice on backscattering coefficients (sigma0) from the Weddell Sea region indicates that surface scattering is the dominant factor. Measured sigma0 values were compared with Kirchhoff and regression-analysis models. The Weibull power-density function was used to fit the measured backscattering coefficients at 45 deg.\n\nTemporal Stability of Soil Moisture and Radar Backscatter Observed by the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWagner, Wolfgang; Pathe, Carsten; Doubkova, Marcela; Sabel, Daniel; Bartsch, Annett; Hasenauer, Stefan; BlÃ¶schl, GÃ¼nter; Scipal, Klaus; MartÃ­nez-FernÃ¡ndez, JosÃ©; LÃ¶w, Alexander\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe high spatio-temporal variability of soil moisture is the result of atmospheric forcing and redistribution processes related to terrain, soil, and vegetation characteristics. Despite this high variability, many field studies have shown that in the temporal domain soil moisture measured at specific locations is correlated to the mean soil moisture content over an area. Since the measurements taken by Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instruments are very sensitive to soil moisture it is hypothesized that the temporally stable soil moisture patterns are reflected in the radar backscatter measurements. To verify this hypothesis 73 Wide Swath (WS) images have been acquired by the ENVISAT Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) over the REMEDHUS soil moisture network located in the Duero basin, Spain. It is found that a time-invariant linear relationship is well suited for relating local scale (pixel) and regional scale (50 km) backscatter. The observed linear model coefficients can be estimated by considering the scattering properties of the terrain and vegetation and the soil moisture scaling properties. For both linear model coefficients, the relative error between observed and modelled values is less than 5 % and the coefficient of determination (R2) is 86 %. The results are of relevance for interpreting and downscaling coarse resolution soil moisture data retrieved from active (METOP ASCAT) and passive (SMOS, AMSR-E) instruments.

T.; Metzler, T.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nThe radar backscatter from fields of milo and soybeans was measured with a ground based radar as a function of frequency (8-18 GHz), polarization (HH and VV) and angle of incidence (0 deg-70 deg) during the summer of 1974. Supporting ground truth was gathered contemporaneously with the backscatter data. At nadir sigma deg of milo correlated highly, r = 0.96, with soil moisture in the milo field at 8.6 GHz but decreased to a value of r = 0.78 at a frequency of 17.0 GHz. Correlation studies of the variations of sigma deg with soil moisture in the soybean fields were not possible due to a lack of a meaningful soil moisture dynamic range. At the larger angles of incidence, however, sigma deg of soybeans did appear to be dependent on precipitation. It is suggested this phenomenon was caused by the rain altering plant geometry. In general sigma deg of both milo and soybeans had a relatively small dynamic range at the higher angles of incidence and showed no significant dependence on the measured crop parameters.\n\nRelating the radar backscattering coefficient to leaf-area index\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nUlaby, F. T. (Principal Investigator); Allen, C.; Eger, G.; Kanemasu, E.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nThe relationship between the radar backscattering coefficient of a vegetation canopy, sigma(0) sub can, and the canopy's leaf area index (LAI) is examined. The relationship is established through the development of a model for corn and sorghum and another for wheat. Both models are extensions of the cloud model of Attema and Ulaby (1978). Analysis of experimental data measured at 8.6, 13.0, 17.0, and 35.6 GHz indicates that most of the temporal variations of sigma(0) sub can can be accounted for through variations in green LAI alone, if the latter is greater than 0.5.\n\nComparison of modeled backscatter with SAR data at P-band\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWang, Yong; Davis, Frank W.; Melack, John M.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nIn recent years several analytical models were developed to predict microwave scattering by trees and forest canopies. These models contribute to the understanding of radar backscatter over forested regions to the extent that they capture the basic interactions between microwave radiation and tree canopies, understories, and ground layers as functions of incidence angle, wavelength, and polarization. The Santa Barbara microwave model backscatter model for woodland (i.e. with discontinuous tree canopies) combines a single-tree backscatter model and a gap probability model. Comparison of model predictions with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and L-band (lambda = 0.235 m) is promising, but much work is still needed to test the validity of model predictions at other wavelengths. The validity of the model predictions at P-band (lambda = 0.68 m) for woodland stands at our Mt. Shasta test site was tested.\n\nSeasonal variations of the backscattering coefficient measured by radar altimeters over the Antarctic Ice Sheet\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIbrahime Adodo, Fifi; Remy, FrÃ©dÃ©rique; Picard, Ghislain\n\n2018-05-01\n\nSpaceborne radar altimeters are a valuable tool for observing the Antarctic Ice Sheet. The radar wave interaction with the snow provides information on both the surface and the subsurface of the snowpack due to its dependence on the snow properties. However, the penetration of the radar wave within the snowpack also induces a negative bias on the estimated surface elevation. Empirical corrections of this space- and time-varying bias are usually based on the backscattering coefficient variability. We investigate the spatial and seasonal variations of the backscattering coefficient at the S (3.2 GHz Ë 9.4 cm), Ku (13.6 GHz Ë 2.3 cm) and Ka (37 GHz Ë 0.8 cm) bands. We identified that the backscattering coefficient at Ku band reaches a maximum in winter in part of the continent (Region 1) and in the summer in the remaining (Region 2), while the evolution at other frequencies is relatively uniform over the whole continent. To explain this contrasting behavior between frequencies and between regions, we studied the sensitivity of the backscattering coefficient at three frequencies to several parameters (surface snow density, snow temperature and snow grain size) using an electromagnetic model. The results show that the seasonal cycle of the backscattering coefficient at Ka frequency is dominated by the volume echo and is mainly driven by snow temperature evolution everywhere. In contrast, at S band, the cycle is dominated by the surface echo. At Ku band, the seasonal cycle is dominated by the volume echo in Region 1 and by the surface echo in Region 2. This investigation provides new information on the seasonal dynamics of the Antarctic Ice Sheet surface and provides new clues to build more accurate corrections of the radar altimeter surface elevation signal in the future.\n\nOn the relationship between age of lava flows and radar backscattering\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBlom, R. G.; Cooley, P.; Schenck, L. R.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nThe observation that older lava flows have lower backscatter in radar images is assessed with multiwavelength/polarization scatterometer data with incidence angles from 15 to 50 deg. Backscatter decreases over time because surface roughness decreases due to infilling with dust and mechanical weathering of the rocks. Pahoehoe lavas in the Snake River Plain with ages of 2.1, 7,4, and 12.0 K yr are best separated with 2.25 cm wavelength data. Blocky obsidian flows at Medicine Lake Highland and Newberry Volcano with ages of 0.9, 1.1 and 1.4 K yr are best separated with 6.3 cm wavelength data. Two Pleistocene flows at the Snake River Plain are best separated with 19.0 cm wavelength data. Incidence angles from 20 to 35 deg are best. These data indicate it may be possible to separate lava flows into eruptive periods using calibrated multiwavelength radar backscatter data.\n\nObservations of Radar Backscatter at Ku and C Bands in the Presence of Large Waves during the Surface Wave Dynamics Experiment\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNghiem, S. V.; Li, Fuk K.; Lou, Shu-Hsiang; Neumann, Gregory; McIntosh, Robert E.; Carson, Steven C.; Carswell, James R.; Walsh, Edward J.; Donelan, Mark A.; Drennan, William M.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nOcean radar backscatter in the presence of large waves is investigated using data acquired with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory NUSCAT radar at Ku band for horizontal and vertical polarizations and the University of Massachusetts CSCAT radar at C band for vertical polarization during the Surface Wave Dynamics Experiment. Off-nadir backscatter data of ocean surfaces were obtained in the presence of large waves with significant wave height up to 5.6 m. In moderate-wind cases, effects of large waves are not detectable within the measurement uncertainty and no noticeable correlation between backscatter coefficients and wave height is found. Under high-wave light-wind conditions, backscatter is enhanced significantly at large incidence angles with a weaker effect at small incidence angles. Backscatter coefficients in the wind speed range under consideration are compared with SASS-2 (Ku band), CMOD3-H1 (C band), and Plant's model results which confirm the experimental observations. Variations of the friction velocity, which can give rise to the observed backscatter behaviors in the presence of large waves, are presented.\n\nOblique view to south OvertheHorizon Backscatter Radar Network, Mountain ...\n\nLibrary of Congress Historic Buildings Survey, Historic Engineering Record, Historic Landscapes Survey\n\nOblique view to south - Over-the-Horizon Backscatter Radar Network, Mountain Home Air Force Operations Building, On Desert Street at 9th Avenue Mountain Home Air Force Base, Mountain Home, Elmore County, ID\n\nCircularly polarized measurements of radar backscatter from terrain\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWilson, E. A.; Brunfeldt, D. R.; Ulaby, F. T.; Holtzman, J. C.\n\n1980-02-01\n\nThis report documents the design changes to the University of Kansas MAS 8-18/35 scatterometer system required to incorporate a circular polarization capability and a subsequent backscatter measurement program. The modifications enable the MAS 8-18/35 system to acquire both linear (HH, HV, VV) and circular (RR, RL, LL) radar backscatter data over its entire operating range of 8-18 GHz and 35 GHz. The measurement program described herein consisted of measurements of the backscatter coefficient, as a function of the angle of incidence (0-80) at selected frequencies in the 8-18 GHz range using circular polarization. Targets studied included coniferous and deciduous trees, wet and dry asphalt and concrete and bare and plowed ground at various moisture conditions. Coniferous and deciduous tree measurements were taken in both August and November so that seasonal changes could be observed.\n\nStudy of sea-surface slope distribution and its effect on radar backscatter based on Global Precipitation Measurement Ku-band precipitation radar measurements\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYan, Qiushuang; Zhang, Jie; Fan, Chenqing; Wang, Jing; Meng, Junmin\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe collocated normalized radar backscattering cross-section measurements from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Ku-band precipitation radar (KuPR) and the winds from the moored buoys are used to study the effect of different sea-surface slope probability density functions (PDFs), including the Gaussian PDF, the Gram-Charlier PDF, and the Liu PDF, on the geometrical optics (GO) model predictions of the radar backscatter at low incidence angles (0 deg to 18 deg) at different sea states. First, the peakedness coefficient in the Liu distribution is determined using the collocations at the normal incidence angle, and the results indicate that the peakedness coefficient is a nonlinear function of the wind speed. Then, the performance of the modified Liu distribution, i.e., Liu distribution using the obtained peakedness coefficient estimate; the Gaussian distribution; and the Gram-Charlier distribution is analyzed. The results show that the GO model predictions with the modified Liu distribution agree best with the KuPR measurements, followed by the predictions with the Gaussian distribution, while the predictions with the Gram-Charlier distribution have larger differences as the total or the slick filtered, not the radar filtered, probability density is included in the distribution. The best-performing distribution changes with incidence angle and changes with wind speed.\n\nBeyond Radar Backscatter: Estimating Forest Structure and Biomass with Radar Interferometry and Lidar Remote Sensing\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLavalle, M.; Ahmed, R.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nMapping forest structure and aboveground biomass globally is a major challenge that the remote sensing community has been facing for decades. Radar backscatter is sensitive to biomass only up to a certain amount (about 150 tons/ha at L-band and 300 tons/ha at P-band), whereas lidar remote sensing is strongly limited by poor spatial coverage. In recent years radar interferometry, including its extension to polarimetric radar interferometry (PolInSAR), has emerged as a new technique to overcome the limitations of radar backscatter. The idea of PolInSAR is to use jointly interferometric and polarimetric radar techniques to separate different scattering mechanisms and retrieve the vertical structure of forests. The advantage is to map ecosystem structure continuously over large areas and independently of cloud coverage. Experiments have shown that forest height - an important proxy for biomass - can be estimated using PolInSAR with accuracy between 15% and 20% at plot level. At AGU we will review the state-of-art of repeat-pass PolInSAR for biomass mapping, including its potential and limitations, and discuss how merging lidar data with PolInSAR data can be beneficial not only for product cross-validation but also for achieving better estimation of ecosystem properties over large areas. In particular, lidar data are expected to aid the inversion of PolInSAR models by providing (1) better identification of ground under the canopy, (2) approximate information of canopy structure in limited areas, and (3) maximum tree height useful for mapping PolInSAR temporal decorrelation. We will show our tree height and biomass maps using PolInSAR L-band JPL/UAVSAR data collected in tropical and temperate forests, and P-band ONERA/TROPISAR data acquired in French Guiana. LVIS lidar data will be used, as well as SRTM data, field measurements and inventory data to support our study. The use of two different radar frequencies and repeat-pass JPL UAVSAR data will offer also the\n\nRadar backscattering properties of corn and soybeans at frequencies of 1.6, 4.75, and 13.3. GHz\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nParis, J. F.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nThe NASA Johnson Space Center made an observational study of the radar-backscattering properties of corn and soybeans in commercial fields in a test site in Webster County, IA. Aircraft-based radar scatterometers measured the backscattering coefficient of the crops at three frequencies, 1.6 GHz (L-band), 4.75 GHz (C-band), and 13.3 GHz (Ku-band), at 10 sensor look-angles (5 to 50 degrees from the nadir in steps of 5 degrees), and with several polarization combinations. Among other findings, it was determined that: (1) row direction differences among fields affected significantly the radar-backscattering coefficient of the fields when the radar system used like-polarization at look-angles from 5 to 25 degrees; (2) row-direction differences had no effect on radar backscattering when the system used either cross-polarization or look-angles greater than 25 degrees regardless of the polarization; (3) wet surface-soil moisture conditions resulted in significantly poorer spectral separability of the two crops as compared to dry-soil conditions; and (4) on the dry-soil date, the best channel for separating corn from soybeans was the C-band cross-polarized measurement at a look-angle of 50 degrees.\n\nRelationship between wind, waves and radar backscatter\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKatsaros, Kristina B.; Ataktuerk, Serhad S.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThe aim of the research was to investigate the relationship between wind, waves, and radar backscatter from water surface. To this end, three field experiments with periods of 2 to 4 weeks were carried out during summer months in 1988, 1989 and 1990. For these periods, the University of Washington group provided (1) environmental parameters such as wind speed, wind stress, and atmospheric stratification through measurements of surface fluxes (of momentum, sensible heat and latent heat) and of air and water temperatures; and (2) wave height spectra including both the dominant waves and the short gravity-capillary waves. Surface flux measurements were performed by using our well tested instruments: a K-Gill twin propeller-vane anemometer and a fast response thermocouple psychrometer. Wave heights were measured by a resistance wire wave gauge. The University of Kansas group was responsible for the operation of the microwave radars.\n\nSimulation of radar backscattering from snowpack at X-band and Ku-band\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGay, Michel; Phan, Xuan-Vu; Ferro-Famil, Laurent\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThis paper presents a multilayer snowpack electromagnetic backscattering model, based on Dense Media Radiative Transfer (DMRT). This model is capable of simulating the interaction of electromagnetic wave (EMW) at X-band and Ku-band frequencies with multilayer snowpack. The air-snow interface and snow-ground backscattering components are calculated using the Integral Equation Model (IEM) by [1], whereas the volume backscattering component is calculated based on the solution of Vector Radiative Transfer (VRT) equation at order 1. Case study has been carried out using measurement data from NoSREx project [2], which include SnowScat data in X-band and Ku-band, TerraSAR-X acquisitions and snowpack stratigraphic in-situ measurements. The results of model simulations show good agreement with the radar observations, and therefore allow the DMRT model to be used in various applications, such as data assimilation [3]. [1] A.K.

P.; Boashash, B.\n\n1993-06-01\n\nThe need for analysis of time-varying signals has led to the formulation of a class of joint time-frequency distributions (TFDs). One of these TFDs, the Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD), has useful properties which can be applied to radar imaging. The authors discuss time-frequency representation of the backscattered signal from a diffuse radar target. It is then shown that for point scatterers which are statistically dependent or for which the reflectivity coefficient has a nonzero mean value, reconstruction using time of flight positron emission tomography on time-frequency images is effective for estimating the scattering function of the target.\n\nEstimating the age of arid-zone alluvial fan surfaces using roughness measurements from spaceborne radar backscatter\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHetz, G.; Mushkin, A.; Blumberg, D. G.; Baer, G.; Trabelsky, E.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nAlluvial fan surfaces respond to geologic and climate changes as they record the deposition and erosion processes that govern their evolution, which amongst others is manifested in the micro and meso scale topography of the surface. Remote sensing provides a regional view that is very useful for mapping. Some previous publications have demonstrated that relative dating can also be achieved by remote sensing using techniques common in planetary geology such as overlap relationships. This work focuses on the use of radar backscatter as suggested originally by Evans et al., (1992) to map ages but here we will try to provide an absolute geologic age. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the use of radar backscatter to constrain surface roughness as a calibrated proxy for estimating age of alluvial surfaces. With the unique regional spatial perspective provided by spaceborne imaging, we aim at providing a new and complementary regional perspective for studying neotectonic and recent landscape evolution processes as well as paleoclimate. Moreover, the method (by radar backscattering measure) can be applied to the geomorphology of other planets. The current study is located in the southeastern part of the Negev desert, Israel on the late Pleistocene - Holocene Shehoret alluvial fan sequence. High resolution (0.5 cm) 3D roughness measurements were collected using a ground-based LIDAR (Leica HDS 3000) and these show a robust relationship between independently obtained OSL surface age and surface roughness; the fan surfaces become smoother with time over 103-105 yr timescales. Spaceborne backscatter radar data respond primarily to surface slope, roughness at a scale comparable to the radar wavelength, and other parameters such as dielectric properties of the surface. Therefore, radar can provide a good quantitative indication of surface roughness in arid zones, where vegetation cover is low. Preliminary results show a relationship between surface age and roughness\n\nSimulation Studies of Forest Structure using 3D Lidar and Radar Models\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSun, Guoqing; Ranson, K. Jon; Koetz, Benjamin; Liu, Dawei\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe use of lidars and radars to measure forest structure attributes such as height and biomass are being considered for future Earth Observation missions. Large footprint lidar makes a direct measurement of the heights of scatterers in the illuminated footprint and can yield information about the vertical profile of the canopy. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is known to sense the canopy volume, especially at longer wavelengths and is useful for estimating biomass. Interferometric SAR (InSAR) has been shown to yield forest canopy height information. For example, the height of scattering phase retrieved from InSAR data is considered to be correlated with the three height and the spatial structure of the forest stand. There is much interest in exploiting these technologies separately and together to get important information for carbon cycle and ecosystem science. More detailed information of the electromagnetic radiation interactions within forest canopies is needed. And backscattering models can be of much utility here. As part of a NASA funded project to explore data fusion, a three-dimensional (3D) coherent radar backscattering model and a 3D lidar backscatter models were used to investigate the use of large footprint lidar, SAR and InSAR for characterizing realistic forest scenes. For this paper, we use stem maps and other forest measurements to develop a realistic spatial structure of a spruce-hemlock forest canopy found in Maine, USA. The radar and lidar models used measurements of the 3D forest scene as input and simulated the coherent radar backscattering signature and 1064nm energy backscatter, respectively. The relationships of backscatter derived forest structure were compared with field measurements. In addition, we also had detailed airborne lidar (Laser Imaging Vegetation Sensor, LVIS) data available over the stem map sites that was used to study the accuracies of tree height derived from modeled SAR backscatter and the scattering phase center retrieved\n\nInvestigation of radar backscattering from second-year sea ice\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLei, Guang-Tsai; Moore, Richard K.; Gogineni, S. P.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nThe scattering properties of second-year ice were studied in an experiment at Mould Bay in April 1983. Radar backscattering measurements were made at frequencies of 5.2, 9.6, 13.6, and 16.6 GHz for vertical polarization, horizontal polarization and cross polarizations, with incidence angles ranging from 15 to 70 deg. The results indicate that the second-year ice scattering characteristics were different from first-year ice and also different from multiyear ice. The fading properties of radar signals were studied and compared with experimental data. The influence of snow cover on sea ice can be evaluated by accounting for the increase in the number of independent samples from snow volume with respect to that for bare ice surface. A technique for calculating the snow depth was established by this principle and a reasonable agreement has been observed. It appears that this is a usable way to measure depth in snow or other snow-like media using radar.\n\nImprovement and extension of a radar forest backscattering model\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSimonett, David S.; Wang, Yong\n\n1989-01-01\n\nRadar modeling of mangal forest stands, in the Sundarbans area of Southern Bangladesh, was developed. The modeling employs radar system parameters with forest data on tree height, spacing, biomass, species combinations, and water (including slightly conductive water), content both in leaves and trunks of the mangal. For Sundri and Gewa tropical mangal forests, six model components are proposed, which are required to explain the contributions of various forest species combinations in the attenuation and scattering of mangal vegetated nonflooded or flooded surfaces. Statistical data of simulated images were compared with those of SIR-B images both to refine the modeling procedures and to appropriately characterize the model output. The possibility of delineation of flooded or nonflooded boundaries is discussed.\n\nFeasibility of inter-comparing airborne and spaceborne obsevations of radar backscattering coefficients\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nThe Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission will provide global soil moisture products that will facilitate new science and application areas.

P.; Shanableh, M.; Gow, A.; Tucker, W.; Jezek, K.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nRadar backscatter measurements from sea ice during the fall freeze-up were performed by the United States Coast Guard Icebreaker Polar Star as a part of the International Arctic Ocean Expedition (IAOE'91) from Aug. to Sep. 1991. The U.S. portion of the experiment took place on board the Polar Star and was referred to as TRAPOLEX '91 (Transpolar expedition) by some investigators. Before prematurely aborting its mission because of mechanical failure of her port shaft, the Polar Star reached 84 deg 57 min N latitude at 35 deg E longitude. The ship was in the ice (greater than 50 percent coverage) from 14 Aug. until 3 Sep. and was operational for all but 6 days due to two instances of mechanical problems with the port shaft. The second was fatal to the ship's participation in the expedition. During the expedition, radar backscatter was measured at C-band under a variety of conditions. These included measurements from young ice types as well as from multiyear and first-/second-year sea ice during the fall freeze-up. The sea ice types were determined by measurement of the ice properties at several of the stations and by visual inspection on others. Radar backscatter measurements were performed over a large portion of the ship's transit into the Arctic ice pack. These were accompanied by in situ sea ice property characterization by the U.S. Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) at several stations and, when snow was present, its properties were documented by The Microwave Group, Ottawa River (MWG).\n\nA Laboratory Study of the Effect of Frost Flowers on C Band Radar Backscatter from Sea Ice\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNghiem, S. V.; Martin, S.; Perovich, D. K.; Kwok, R.; Drucker, R.; Gow, A. J.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nC band images of Arctic sea ice taken by the ERS 1 synthetic aperture radar show transitory regions of enhanced radar backscatter from young sea ice. Published field observations associate this increase with frost flower growth and the capture of blowing snow by the flowers. To investigate the first part of this phenomenon, we carried out a laboratory experiment on the response of C band radar backscatter to frost flowers growing on the surface of newly formed saline ice. The experiment took place in a 5 m by 7 m by 1.2 m deep saline water pool located in a two-story indoor refrigerated facility at the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory. Sodium chloride ice was grown in this pool at an air temperature of -28 C. The frost flowers first appeared on the ice surface as dendrites and then changed to needles as the ice sheet grew thicker and the surface temperatures became colder. The frost flowers reached to a height of 10-15 mm, and beneath each cluster of frost flowers a slush layer formed to a thickness of approximately 4 mm. Far-field radar measurements of the backscatter from the ice were made at incident angles from 20 to 40 deg and at approximately 6-hour intervals throughout the 3-day period of the experiment. A backscatter minimum occurred early in the flower growth at the time coincident with an abrupt doubling in the ice surface salinity. Once the full flower coverage was achieved, we removed first the crystal flowers and then the slush layer from the ice surface. The results for these cases show that the crystals have little impact on the backscatter, while the underlying slush patches yield a backscatter increase of 3-5 dB over that of bare ice. The laboratory results suggest that this relative backscatter increase of approximately 5 dB can be used as an index to mark the full area coverage of frost flowers.\n\nA Laboratory Study of the Effect of Frost Flowers on C Band Radar Backscatter from Sea Ice\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNghiem, S.

We consider the microstructure irregularities of a SEGT as the essential factor that affect radar backscatter. To evaluate their contribution this study uses the \"slice\" approach: particles close to the front of incident radar wave are considered to reflect incident electromagnetic wave coherently. The radar equation for a SEGT is derived. The equation includes contributions to the total backscatter from correlated small-scale fluctuations of the slice's reflectivity. The correlation contribution changes in accordance with an earlier proposed idea by Smith (1964) based on physical consideration. The slice approach applied allows parameterizing the features of the SEGT's inhomogeneities.\n\nCharacterization of Global Near-Nadir Backscatter for Remote Sensing Radar Design\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSpencer, Michael W.; Long, David G.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nIn order to evaluate side-lobe contamination from the near-nadir region for Ku-Band radars, a statistical characterization of global near-nadir backscatter is constructed.

The modeling employs radar system parameters such as wavelength, polarization, and incidence angle, with forest data on tree height, spacing, biomass, species combinations, and water content (including slightly conductive water) both in leaves and trunks of the mangal. For Sundri and Gewa tropical mangal forests, five model components are proposed, which are required to explain the contributions of various forest species combinations in the attenuation and scattering of mangal vegetated nonflooded or flooded surfaces. Statistical data of simulated images (HH components only) were compared with those of SIR-B images both to refine the modeling procedures and to appropriately characterize the model output.

The major research goals were to improve understanding of the relationships between radar backscatter and phenological variables (e.g. stand density, tree size, etc.), to improve radar backscatter models of tree canopy properties, and to develop a radar-based scheme for monitoring forest phenological changes. In September 1989, AIRSAR backscatter data were acquired over the Duke Forest. As the aboveground biomass of the loblolly pine forest stands at Duke Forest increased, the SAR backscatter at C-, L-, and P-bands increased and saturated at different biomass levels for the C-band, L-band, and P-band data. We only use the P-band backscatter data and ground measurements here to study the relationships between the backscatter and stand density, the backscatter and mean trunk dbh (diameter at breast height) of trees in the stands, and the backscatter and stand basal area.\n\nImprovement and extension of a radar forest backscattering model\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSimonett, David S.; Wang, Yong\n\n1988-01-01\n\nResearch to-date has focused on modeling development and programming based on model components proposed during the past several months and research progress made by the Simonett team. The model components and programs (in C language under UNIX) finished to date are summarized. These model components may help explain the contributions of various vegetation structural components to the attenuation and backscattering of vegetated surfaces to extract useful data concerning forest stands and their underlying surfaces for both the seawater-on and seawater-off.\n\nSimulation of multistatic and backscattering cross sections for airborne radar\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBiggs, Albert W.\n\n1986-07-01\n\nIn order to determine susceptibilities of airborne radar to electronic countermeasures and electronic counter-countermeasures simulations of multistatic and backscattering cross sections were developed as digital modules in the form of algorithms. Cross section algorithms are described for prolate (cigar shape) and oblate (disk shape) spheroids. Backscattering cross section algorithms are also described for different categories of terrain. Backscattering cross section computer programs were written for terrain categorized as vegetation, sea ice, glacial ice, geological (rocks, sand, hills, etc.), oceans, man-made structures, and water bodies. PROGRAM SIGTERRA is a file for backscattering cross section modules of terrain (TERRA) such as vegetation (AGCROP), oceans (OCEAN), Arctic sea ice (SEAICE), glacial snow (GLASNO), geological structures (GEOL), man-made structures (MAMMAD), or water bodies (WATER). AGCROP describes agricultural crops, trees or forests, prairies or grassland, and shrubs or bush cover. OCEAN has the SLAR or SAR looking downwind, upwind, and crosswind at the ocean surface. SEAICE looks at winter ice and old or polar ice. GLASNO is divided into a glacial ice and snow or snowfields.

J.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nResearchers developed a radar-echo model for Mars based on 12.6 cm continuous wave radio transmissions backscattered from the planet. The model broadly matches the variations in depolarized and polarized total radar cross sections with longitude observed by Goldstone in 1986 along 7 degrees S. and yields echo spectra that are generally similiar to the observed spectra. Radar map units in the model include an extensive cratered uplands unit with weak depolarized echo cross sections, average thermal inertias, moderate normal refelectivities, and moderate rms slopes; the volcanic units of Tharsis, Elysium, and Amazonis regions with strong depolarized echo cross sections, low thermal inertia, low normal reflectivities, and large rms slopes; and the northern planes units with moderate to strong depolarized echo cross sections, moderate to very high thermal inertias, moderate to large normal reflectivities, and moderate rms slopes. The relevance of the model to the interpretation of radar echoes from Mars is discussed.\n\nRadar signatures of snowflake riming: A modeling study.\n\nPubMed\n\nLeinonen, Jussi; Szyrmer, Wanda\n\n2015-08-01\n\nThe capability to detect the state of snowflake riming reliably from remote measurements would greatly expand the understanding of its global role in cloud-precipitation processes. To investigate the ability of multifrequency radars to detect riming, a three-dimensional model of snowflake growth was used to generate simulated aggregate and crystal snowflakes with various degrees of riming. Three different growth scenarios, representing different temporal relationships between aggregation and riming, were formulated. The discrete dipole approximation was then used to compute the radar backscattering properties of the snowflakes at frequencies of 9.7, 13.6, 35.6, and 94Â GHz. In two of the three growth scenarios, the rimed snowflakes exhibit large differences between the backscattering cross sections of the detailed three-dimensional models and the equivalent homogeneous spheroidal models, similarly to earlier results for unrimed snowflakes. When three frequencies are used simultaneously, riming appears to be detectable in a robust manner across all three scenarios. In spite of the differences in backscattering cross sections, the triple-frequency signatures of heavily rimed particles resemble those of the homogeneous spheroids, thus explaining earlier observational results that were compatible with such spheroids.\n\nObservations of Enhanced Radar Backscatter (ERB) from Millstone Hill\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLee, M. C.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nIntense enhancements of the incoherent radar backscatter spectrum from the topside ionosphere were observed with the Millstone Hill UHF radar. Enhancements occurring at the local ion acoustic frequency causing large asymmetries in the measured ion line may be produced by current driven instabilities. These enhancements pose a practical problem for space surveillance systems because their cross section and spectral width are characteristic of satellites. Conversely, their hard target signature complicates the study of naturally occurring ERB events; it is nearly impossible to distinguish them from satellites based on a single measurement. Statistical comparisons of observed coherent echo distributions with predictions from a satellite catalog were used to broadly identify periods of ERB activity. A series of experiments using multiple diagnostics, including satellite instruments, for simultaneous observations have established the association of ERB with large fluxes of soft suprathermal electrons carrying field aligned currents. Zenith data are also presented which show the asymmetric growth of ion acoustic waves directly above Millstone Hill. Details of these results are presented.\n\nSimulation of Radar-Backscattering from Phobos - A Contribution to the Experiment MARSIS aboard MarsExpress\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPlettemeier, D.; Hahnel, R.; Hegler, S.; Safaeinili, A.; Orosei, R.; Cicchetti, A.; Plaut, J.; Picardi, G.\n\n2009-04-01\n\nMARSIS (Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding) on board MarsExpress is the first and so far the only space borne radar that observed the Martian moon Phobos. Radar echoes were measured for different flyby trajectories. The primary aim of the low frequency sounding of Phobos is to prove the feasibility of deep sounding, into the crust of Phobos. In this poster we present a numerical method that allows a very precise computation of radar echoes backscattered from the surface of large objects. The software is based on a combination of physical optics calculation of surface scattering of the radar target, and Method of Moments to calculate the radiation pattern of the whole space borne radar system. The calculation of the frequency dependent radiation pattern takes into account all relevant gain variations and coupling effects aboard the space craft. Based on very precise digital elevation models of Phobos, patch models in the resolution of lambda/10 were generated. Simulation techniques will be explained and a comparison of simulations and measurements will be shown. SURFACE BACKSCATTERING SIMULATOR FOR LARGE OBJECTS The computation of surface scattering of the electromagnetic wave incident on Phobos is based on the Physical Optics method. The scattered field can be expressed by the induced equivalent surface currents on the target. The Algorithm: The simulation program itself is split into three phases. In the first phase, an illumination test checks whether a patch will be visible from the position of the space craft. If this is not the case, the patch will be excluded from the simulation. The second phase serves as a preparation stage for the third phase. Amongst other tasks, the dyadic products for the Js and Ms surface currents are calculated. This is a time-memory trade-off: the simulation will need additional 144 bytes of RAM for every patch that passes phase one. However, the calculation of the dyads is expensive, so that considerable\n\nAn empirical model for ocean radar backscatter and its application in inversion routine to eliminate wind speed and direction effects\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDome, G. J.; Fung, A. K.; Moore, R. K.\n\n1977-01-01\n\nSeveral regression models were tested to explain the wind direction dependence of the 1975 JONSWAP (Joint North Sea Wave Project) scatterometer data. The models consider the radar backscatter as a harmonic function of wind direction. The constant term accounts for the major effect of wind speed and the sinusoidal terms for the effects of direction. The fundamental accounts for the difference in upwind and downwind returns, while the second harmonic explains the upwind-crosswind difference. It is shown that a second harmonic model appears to adequately explain the angular variation. A simple inversion technique, which uses two orthogonal scattering measurements, is also described which eliminates the effect of wind speed and direction. Vertical polarization was shown to be more effective in determining both wind speed and direction than horizontal polarization.\n\nConstraining the physical properties of Titan's empty lake basins using nadir and off-nadir Cassini RADAR backscatter\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMichaelides, R. J.; Hayes, A. G.; Mastrogiuseppe, M.; Zebker, H. A.; Farr, T. G.; Malaska, M. J.; Poggiali, V.; Mullen, J. P.\n\n2016-05-01\n\nWe use repeat synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations and complementary altimetry passes acquired by the Cassini spacecraft to study the scattering properties of Titan's empty lake basins. The best-fit coefficients from fitting SAR data to a quasi-specular plus diffuse backscatter model suggest that the bright basin floors have a higher dielectric constant, but similar facet-scale rms surface facet slopes, to surrounding terrain. Waveform analysis of altimetry returns reveals that nadir backscatter returns from basin floors are greater than nadir backscatter returns from basin surroundings and have narrower pulse widths. This suggests that floor deposits are structurally distinct from their surroundings, consistent with the interpretation that some of these basins may be filled with evaporitic and/or sedimentary deposits. Basin floor deposits also express a larger diffuse component to their backscatter, which is likely due to variations in subsurface structure or an increase in roughness at the wavelength scale (Hayes, A.G. et al. [2008]. Geophys. Res. Lett. 35, 9). We generate a high-resolution altimetry radargram of the T30 altimetry pass over an empty lake basin, with which we place geometric constraints on the basin's slopes, rim heights, and depth. Finally, the importance of these backscatter observations and geometric measurements for basin formation mechanisms is briefly discussed.\n\nSuperDARN elevation angle calibration using HAARP-induced backscatter\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShepherd, S. G.; Thomas, E. G.; Palinski, T. J.; Bristow, W.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nSuperDARN radars rely on refraction in the ionosphere to make Doppler measurements of backscatter from ionospheric irregularities or the ground/sea, often to ranges of 4000 km or more. Elevation angle measurements of backscattered signals can be important for proper geolocation, mode identification and Doppler velocity corrections to the data. SuperDARN radars are equipped with a secondary array to make elevation angle measurements, however, calibration is often difficult. One method of calibration is presented here, whereby backscatter from HAARP-induced irregularities, at a known location, is used to independently determine the elevation angle of signals. Comparisons are made for several radars with HAARP in their field-of-view in addition to the results obtained fromray-tracing in a model ionosphere.\n\nProperties of radar backscatter of forests measured with a multifrequency polarimetric SAR\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAmar, F.; Karam, M. A.; Fung, A. K.; De Grandi, G.; Lavalle, C.; Sieber, A.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nFully polarimetric airborne synthetic aperture radar (AIRSAR) data, collected in Germany during the MAC Europe campaign, are calibrated using software packages developed at the Joint Research Center (JRC) in Italy for both L- and C-bands. During the period of the overflight dates, extensive ground truth was collected in order to describe the physical and statistical parameters of the canopy, the understory, and the soil. These parameters are compiled and converted into electromagnetic parameters suitable for input to the new polarimetric three-layer canopy model developed at the Wave Scattering Research Center (WSRC) at the University of Texas at Arlington. Comparisons between the theoretical predictions from the model and the calibrated data are carried out. Initial results reveal that the trend of the average phase difference can be predicted by the model, and that the backscattering ratio *shh/ svv is sensitive to the distribution of the primary branches.\n\nA Model for Backscattering from Quasi Periodic Corn Canopies at L-Band\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLang, R.; Utku, C.; Zhao, Q.; O'Neill, P.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nIn this study, a model for backscattering at L-band from a corn canopy is proposed. The canopy consists of a quasi-periodic distribution of stalks and a random distribution of leaves. The Distorted Born Approximation (DBA) is employed to calculate the single scattered return from the corn field. The new feature of the method is that the coherence of the stalks in the row direction is incorporated in the model in a systematic fashion. Since the wavelength is on the order of the distance between corn stalks in a row, grating lobe behavior is observed at certain azimuth angles of incidence. The results are compared with experimental values measured in Huntsville, Alabama in 1998. The mean field and the effective dielectric constant of the canopy are obtained by using the Foldy approximation. The stalks are placed in the effective medium in a two dimensional lattice to simulate the row structure of a corn field. In order to mimic a real corn field, a quasi-periodic stalk distribution is assumed where the stalks are given small random perturbations about their lattice locations. Corn leaves are also embedded in the effective medium and the backscattered field from the stalks and the leaves is computed. The backscattering coefficient is calculated and averaged over successive stalk position perturbations. It is assumed that soil erosion has smoothed the soil sufficiently so that it can be assumed flat. Corn field backscatter data was collected from cornfields during the Huntsville 98 experimental campaign held at Alabama A&M University Research Station, Huntsville, Alabama in 1998 using the NASA/GW truck mounted radar. Extensive ground truth data was collected. This included soil moisture measurements and corn plant architectural data to be used in the model. In particular, the distances between the stalks in a single row have been measured. The L-band radar backscatter data was collected for both H and V polarizations and for look angles of 15o and 45o over a two week\n\nAssimilation of Global Radar Backscatter and Radiometer Brightness Temperature Observations to Improve Soil Moisture and Land Evaporation Estimates\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLievens, H.; Martens, B.; Verhoest, N. E. C.; Hahn, S.; Reichle, R. H.; Miralles, D. G.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nActive radar backscatter (s?) observations from the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) and passive radiometer brightness temperature (TB) observations from the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission are assimilated either individually or jointly into the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) to improve its simulations of soil moisture and land evaporation. To enable s? and TB assimilation, GLEAM is coupled to the Water Cloud Model and the L-band Microwave Emission from the Biosphere (L-MEB) model. The innovations, i.e. differences between observations and simulations, are mapped onto the model soil moisture states through an Ensemble Kalman Filter. The validation of surface (0-10 cm) soil moisture simulations over the period 2010-2014 against in situ measurements from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) shows that assimilating s? or TB alone improves the average correlation of seasonal anomalies (Ran) from 0.514 to 0.547 and 0.548, respectively. The joint assimilation further improves Ran to 0.559. Associated enhancements in daily evaporative flux simulations by GLEAM are validated based on measurements from 22 FLUXNET stations. Again, the singular assimilation improves Ran from 0.502 to 0.536 and 0.533, respectively for s? and TB, whereas the best performance is observed for the joint assimilation (Ran = 0.546). These results demonstrate the complementary value of assimilating radar backscatter observations together with brightness temperatures for improving estimates of hydrological variables, as their joint assimilation outperforms the assimilation of each observation type separately.\n\nProbabilities and statistics for backscatter estimates obtained by a scatterometer\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPierson, Willard J., Jr.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nMethods for the recovery of winds near the surface of the ocean from measurements of the normalized radar backscattering cross section must recognize and make use of the statistics (i.e., the sampling variability) of the backscatter measurements. Radar backscatter values from a scatterometer are random variables with expected values given by a model. A model relates backscatter to properties of the waves on the ocean, which are in turn generated by the winds in the atmospheric marine boundary layer. The effective wind speed and direction at a known height for a neutrally stratified atmosphere are the values to be recovered from the model. The probability density function for the backscatter values is a normal probability distribution with the notable feature that the variance is a known function of the expected value. The sources of signal variability, the effects of this variability on the wind speed estimation, and criteria for the acceptance or rejection of models are discussed. A modified maximum likelihood method for estimating wind vectors is described. Ways to make corrections for the kinds of errors found for the Seasat SASS model function are described, and applications to a new scatterometer are given.\n\nRelationship between gas exchange, wind speed, and radar backscatter in a large wind-wave tank\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWanninkhof, Richard H.; Bliven, L. F.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThe relationships between the gas exchange, wind speed, friction velocity, and radar backscatter from the water surface was investigated using data obtained in a large water tank in the Delft (Netherlands) wind-wave tunnel, filled with water supersaturated with SF6, N2O, and CH4. Results indicate that the gas-transfer velocities of these substances were related to the wind speed with a power law dependence. Microwave backscatter from water surface was found to be related to gas transfer velocities by a relationship in the form k(gas) = a 10 exp (b A0), where k is the gas transfer velocity for the particular gas, the values of a and b are obtained from a least squares fit of the average backscatter cross section and gas transfer at 80 m, and A0 is the directional (azimuthal) averaged return.\n\nDetermination of the Sources of Radar Scattering\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMoore, R. K.; Zoughi, R.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nFine-resolution radar backscattering measurements were proposed to determine the backscattering sources in various vegetation canopies and surface targets. The results were then used to improve the existing theoretical models of terrain scattering, and also to enhance understanding of the radar signal observed by an imaging radar over a vegetated area. Various experiments were performed on targets such as corn, milo, soybeans, grass, asphalt pavements, soil and concrete walkways. Due to the lack of available references on measurements of this type, the obtained results will be used primarily as a foundation or future experiments. The constituent backscattering characteristics of the vegetation canopies was also examined.\n\nProducing Science-Ready Radar Datasets for the Retrieval of Forest Structure Parameters from Backscatter: Correcting for Terrain Topography and Changes in Vegetation Reflectivity\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSimard, M.; Riel, Bryan; Hensley, S.; Lavalle, Marco\n\n2011-01-01\n\nRadar backscatter data contain both geometric and radiometric distortions due to underlying topography and the radar viewing geometry. Our objective is to develop a radiometric correction algorithm specific to the UAVSAR system configuration that would improve retrieval of forest structure parameters. UAVSAR is an airborne Lband radar capable of repeat?pass interferometry producing images with a spatial resolution of 5m. It is characterized by an electronically steerable antenna to compensate for aircraft attitude. Thus, the computation of viewing angles (i.e. look, incidence and projection) must include aircraft attitude angles (i.e. yaw, pitch and roll) in addition to the antenna steering angle. In this presentation, we address two components of radiometric correction: area projection and vegetation reflectivity. The first correction is applied by normalization of the radar backscatter by the local ground area illuminated by the radar beam. The second is a correction due to changes in vegetation reflectivity with viewing geometry.\n\nSolar Influences on the Return Direction of High-Frequency Radar Backscatter\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBurrell, Angeline G.; Perry, Gareth W.; Yeoman, Timothy K.; Milan, Stephen E.; Stoneback, Russell\n\n2018-04-01\n\nCoherent-scatter, high-frequency, phased-array radars create narrow beams through the use of constructive and destructive interference patterns. This formation method leads to the creation of a secondary beam, or lobe, that is sent out behind the radar. This study investigates the relative importance of the beams in front of and behind the high-frequency radar located in Hankasalmi, Finland, using observations taken over a solar cycle, as well as coincident observations from Hankasalmi and the Enhanced Polar Outflow Probe Radio Receiver Instrument. These observations show that the relative strength of the front and rear beams is frequency dependent, with the relative amount of power sent to the front lobe increasing with increasing frequency. At the range of frequencies used by Hankasalmi, both front and rear beams are always present, though the main beam is always stronger than the rear lobe. Because signals are always transmitted to the front and rear of the radar, it is always possible to receive backscatter from both return directions. Examining the return direction as a function of local time, season, and solar cycle shows that the dominant return direction depends primarily on the local ionospheric structure. Diurnal changes in plasma density typically cause an increase in the amount of groundscatter returning from the rear lobe at night, though the strength of this variation has a seasonal dependence. Solar cycle variations are also seen in the groundscatter return direction, modifying the existing local time and seasonal variations.\n\nReduced backscattering cross section (Sigma degree) data from the Skylab S-193 radar altimeter\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBrown, G. S.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nBackscattering cross section per unit scattering area data, reduced from measurements made by the Skylab S-193 radar altimeter over the ocean surface are presented. Descriptions of the altimeter are given where applicable to the measurement process. Analytical solutions are obtained for the flat surface impulse response for the case of a nonsymmetrical antenna pattern. Formulations are developed for converting altimeter AGC outputs into values for the backscattering cross section. Reduced data are presented for Missions SL-2, 3 and 4 for all modes of the altimeter where sufficient calibration existed. The problem of interpreting land scatter data is also discussed. Finally, a comprehensive error analysis of the measurement is presented and worst case random and bias errors are estimated.\n\nA modeling study of the radar signatures of rip currents with comparisons to data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nO'Dea, A.; Haller, M. C.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nRip currents are important components of nearshore circulation systems and can pose serious dangers to swimmers. In recent years, X-band imaging radar has been shown to be an effective remote sensor of rip currents over large spatial scales, for long durations, and with high temporal resolution. In contrast to remote sensing methods that infer rip location through the identification of morphological features (i.e. rip channels), rip detection in radar arises directly from the backscatter characteristics of the rip current flow field, thus offering the potential of direct extraction of quantitative information on rip current hydrodynamics. In this study, we present a model for the radar imaging of rip currents based on the wave action balance equation and the changes to the wind-wave spectrum at Bragg (capillary) wavelengths induced by the underlying rip current field. Model results are compared to field data (both in situ and remote sensing) from a 10-day experiment at Duck, NC conducted in September 2010. The model/data comparisons are then used to assess the physical mechanisms contributing to the radar imaging of rip currents including the role of rip current strength, wind speed, wind direction, and very short-scale wave breaking in rip current imaging. Following the methodology of Rascle et al. (J. Phys. Oceanography, 2014), the radar imaging model uses a relaxation approach that models perturbations to the equilibrium wave action spectrum induced by gradients in the underlying current field (specifically, the divergence and strain components of the deformation tensor). From the perturbed wind-wave spectrum, changes in the mean square slope (MSS) are then calculated and taken as a proxy for the change in radar backscatter intensity due to rip currents. Model simulations of rip current velocity fields for the field experiments were developed previously by Wilson et al. (J. Geophys. Res., 2014) using ROMS. The modeled velocities are used as input into the\n\nAssessment of the sensitivity of radar backscatter to seasonal snow and vegetation thaw dynamics in a boreal ecosystem\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMcDonald, K.

C.; Wentworth, E. W.\n\n1980-05-01\n\nRecently there has been much interest expressed to determine the ability of millimeter wave radar to perform target acquisition during degraded visibility conditions. In this regard, one of the primary issues of concern has been the potential of high-explosive artillery barrages to obscure the battlefield from millimeter wave radar systems. To address this issue 95 GHz millimeter wave radar measurements were conducted during the Dusty Infrared Test 2 (DIRT 2). This test was held at White Sands Missile Range, NM, 18-28 July 1979. Millimeter wave transmission and backscatter measurements were performed during singular live firings and static detonations of 155 mm and 105 mm high-explosive artillery rounds in addition to static detonations of C-4 explosives. A brief description of the millimeter wave portion of the test and instrumentation is given. The data along with some preliminary conclusions are presented.\n\nSAR backscatter from coniferous forest gaps\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDay, John L.; Davis, Frank W.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nA study is in progress comparing Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (AIRSAR) backscatter from coniferous forest plots containing gaps to backscatter from adjacent gap-free plots. Issues discussed are how do gaps in the range of 400 to 1600 sq m (approximately 4-14 pixels at intermediate incidence angles) affect forest backscatter statistics and what incidence angles, wavelengths, and polarizations are most sensitive to forest gaps. In order to visualize the slant-range imaging of forest and gaps, a simple conceptual model is used. This strictly qualitative model has led us to hypothesize that forest radar returns at short wavelengths (eg., C-band) and large incidence angles (e.g., 50 deg) should be most affected by the presence of gaps, whereas returns at long wavelengths and small angles should be least affected. Preliminary analysis of 1989 AIRSAR data from forest near Mt. Shasta supports the hypothesis. Current forest backscatter models such as MIMICS and Santa Barbara Discontinuous Canopy Backscatter Model have in several cases correctly predicted backscatter from forest stands based on inputs of measured or estimated forest parameters. These models do not, however, predict within-stand SAR scene texture, or 'intrinsic scene variability' as Ulaby et al. has referred to it. For instance, the Santa Barbara model, which may be the most spatially coupled of the existing models, is not truly spatial. Tree locations within a simulated pixel are distributed according to a Poisson process, as they are in many natural forests, but tree size is unrelated to location, which is not the case in nature. Furthermore, since pixels of a simulated stand are generated independently in the Santa Barbara model, spatial processes larger than one pixel are not modeled. Using a different approach, Oliver modeled scene texture based on an hypothetical forest geometry. His simulated scenes do not agree well with SAR data, perhaps due to the simple geometric model used. Insofar as texture\n\nModels of the diffuse radar backscatter from Mars\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nEngland, A. W.; Austin, R. T.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThe topographies of several debris flow units near the Mount St. Helens Volcano were measured at lateral scales of millimeters to meters in September 1990. The objective was to measure the surface roughness of the debris flows at scales smaller than, on the order of, and larger that the radar wavelength of common remote sensing radars. A laser profiling system and surveying instruments were used to obtain elevation data for square areas that varied in size from 10 to 32 cm. The elevation data were converted to estimates of the power spectrum of surface roughness. The conversions were based upon standard periodogram techniques, and upon a modified spectral estimation technique that was developed.\n\nBackscattering enhancement for Marshall-Palmer distributed rains for a W-band nadir-pointing radar with a finite beam width\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKobayashi, Satoru; Tanelli, Simone; Im, Eastwood; Oguchi, Tomohiro\n\n2005-01-01\n\nIn this paper, we expand the previous theory to be applied to a generic drop size distribution with spheroidal raindrops including spherical raindrops. Results will be used to discuss the multiple scattering effects on the backscatter measurements acquired by a W-band nadir-pointing radar.\n\nIdentification of major backscattering sources in trees and shrubs at 10 GHz\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nZoughi, R.; Wu, L. K.; Moore, R. K.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nA short-range very-fine-resolution FM-CW radar scatterometer has been used to identify the primary contributors to 10-GHz radar backscatter from pine, pin oak, American sycamore and sugar maple trees, and from creeping juniper shrubs. This system provided a range resolution of 11 cm and gave a 16-cm diameter illumination area at the target range of about 4 m. For a pine tree, the needles caused the strongest backscatter as well as the strongest attenuation in the radar signal. Cones, although insignificant contributors to the total backscatter, were more important for backscattering than for attenuation. For the rest of the trees, leaves were the strongest cause of backscattering and attenuation. However, in the absence of leaves, the petioles, small twigs, and branches gave relatively strong backscatter. For American sycamore and sugar maple trees, the fruits did not affect the total backscatter unless they were packed in clusters. For creeping juniper the backscattered energy and attenuation in the radar signal were mainly due to the top two layers of the evergreen scales. The contribution of the tree trunks was not determined.\n\nDetecting forest structure and biomass with C-band multipolarization radar - Physical model and field tests\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWestman, Walter E.; Paris, Jack F.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThe ability of C-band radar (4.75 GHz) to discriminate features of forest structure, including biomass, is tested using a truck-mounted scatterometer for field tests on a 1.5-3.0 m pygmy forest of cypress (Cupressus pygmaea) and pine (Pinus contorta ssp, Bolanderi) near Mendocino, CA.
