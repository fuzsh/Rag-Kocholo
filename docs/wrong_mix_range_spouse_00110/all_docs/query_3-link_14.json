        "text": "Kidnapped relatives of former Miss USA Ali Landry have been found dead in Mexico, authorities said.\n\nJuan Manuel Gómez Fernández and Juan Manuel Gómez Monteverde are the father and brother of Landry’s husband, acclaimed Mexican film director Alejandro Monteverde, according to CNN affiliate Televisa.\n\nMonteverde and Landry, who represented Louisiana in the 1996 pageant, married in 2006 and they have three children.\n\nThe slain men were found Saturday in Veracruz, according to a statement from that state’s attorney general. They had been reported kidnapped on September 4. Initial investigations suggest that both men suffered head trauma, the statement said.\n\nLandry declined through her representatives to comment.\n\nMany months ago, the actress’ husband posted a picture on Instagram of him and his father.\n\n“Celebrating in San Miguel de Allende, with my best friend, my life mentor, the wisest man I know; my father,” he wrote then."
