Jose Manuel Gomez Fernandez and Juan Manuel Gomez Monteverde are the father and brother of Landry's husband, acclaimed director Alejandro Monteverde.\n\nIn a written statement on a Veracruz website, Prosecutor General of Justice for Veracruz, Luis Angel Bravo Contreras, said that Fernandez and Monteverde were found Sept. 19 near Pueblo Viejo. The two, who were identified by relatives, had sustained traumatic brain injuries and been dead for several days. Allegedly, a ransom had been paid after the kidnapping.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough not much is known about the reasoning behind the attacks, the Latin Times reports:\n\nMonteverde’s brother, Juan Manuel, was a business partner at “La Pecerita,” previously known as “El Callejón de los Milagros” in Tampico, Tamaulipas, a restaurant that has allegedly reported drug cartel activity in the past. It is well known that the south of Tamaulipas and the north of Veracruz are lawless territories with high rates of crime, primarily caused by drug cartel members.\n\nAlejandro Monteverde and his father, Jose Manuel Gomez Fernandez.\n\nH/T People\n\nAlso on HuffPost:\n\nFor a constant stream of entertainment news and discussion, follow HuffPost Entertainment on Viber.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom Our Partner"
