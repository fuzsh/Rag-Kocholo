Reign of Fath-Ali

Fath-Ali Khan Afshar was the first khan of the Urmia Khanate. He was in power from 1747 to 1748, and again from 1757 until 1762.[1]

Shortly after coming to power, he captured Tabriz and moved the capital from Urmia to Tabriz. After this, he captured multiple other khanates, including Khoy Khanate, Karadagh Khanate, Maragheh Khanate and Sarab Khanate. In 1759, he marched onto Karabakh Khanate, which resulted in 6 months long siege and ultimately, Panah Ali Khan, khan of Karabakh Khanate, accepting to be the dependency of Fath-Ali. Panah Ali Khan's son Ibrahim Khalil Khan was taken hostage after the siege.[2][3]
