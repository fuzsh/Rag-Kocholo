This document provides an overview of the historical khanates that were established in Azerbaijan in the 18th century after the weakening of Iranian and Ottoman authority in the region. It describes the founding and rulers of the major khanates in Southern Azerbaijan (around Tabriz, Urmia, Khoy) and Northern Azerbaijan (Karabakh, Sheki, Quba, Ganja). The khanates acted as independent or semi-independent feudal states during this period of political fragmentation and power struggles before the region was divided between Russia and Iran in the early 19th century.",
