        "text": "The History of East Syriac Christianity in modern times is not least the history of migration and resettlement. One of the main landmarks of the history of transnational mobility of the East Syriac Christians in modern times was the establishment of contacts with the Russia Empire. In the course of the nineteenth and the early twentieth century, imperial Russia did not only actively engage – both politically and militarily – in northwestern Iran and the eastern Ottoman Empire, the region inhabited by the adherents of the Church of the East, but also become one of the principal destinations of migration of the East Syriac Christians. Thus, the nineteenth century witnessed the beginning of East Syrian migration from their ancestral regions as well as the advent of the idea of resettlement of the entire community, a precursor of the mass movement that would occur during and after World War I. The contribution begins with a discussion of the first encounters between East Syriac Christianity and imperial Russia in the late eighteenth century and highlights its importance for the ongoing debate about the emergence of modern Assyrianism, a concept that perceives the East Syriac Christians (or even all Syriac Christians) as descendants of the Assyrians of the ancient Near East. It then looks at the emergence of the vision of resettlement of the East Syriac community to imperial Russia in the early nineteenth century and analyzes how the competing ideas of belonging had been negotiated in this context. Special attention is given to the historical sources, namely the letters of Pavel Cicianov (1754–1806), the imperial Governor General of Georgia, addressed to the Head of the Church of the East, Mar Shemʿon XVI Yoḥannan (r. 1780–1820), and bishop of Urmia Mar Yoḥannan. These letters, written in 1805, are of considerable interest not least because they give a glimpse of the life of the Church of the East in a period about which information is very scarce. Therefore, one of the aims of this contribution is to make these historical documents available by publishing them along with an English translation."
