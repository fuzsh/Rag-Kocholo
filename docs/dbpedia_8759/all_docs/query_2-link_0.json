        "text": "City in West Azerbaijan province, Iran\n\nNot to be confused with Urmia County.\n\nFor other places with a similar name, see Urmia.\n\nCity in Iran\n\nUrmia (Persian: ارومیه; pronounced [oɾumiˈje] ⓘ)[a] is the largest city in West Azerbaijan Province of Iran. In the Central District of Urmia County, it is capital of the province, the county, and the district.[5]\n\nThe city lies at an altitude of 1,330 metres (4,360 ft) above sea level along the Shahar River on the Urmia Plain. Lake Urmia, one of the world's largest salt lakes, lies to the east of the city, and the border with Turkey lies to the west.\n\nThe city is the trading center for a fertile agricultural region where fruits (especially apples and grapes) and tobacco are grown. Even though the majority of the residents of Urmia are Muslims, the Christian history of Urmia is well preserved and is especially evident in the city's many churches and cathedrals.\n\nAn important town by the 9th century, the city has had a diverse population which has at times included Muslims (Shias and Sunnis), Christians (Catholics, Protestants, Nestorians, and Orthodox), Jews, Baháʼís and Sufis. Around 1900 Christians made up more than 40% of the city's population; however, in the next decades most of the Christians were either killed by the advancing Ottoman troops or in raids by Kurdish tribes[6][7] or fled shortly after the end of the war.[8][9][10]\n\nUrmia, Takab and Piranshahr respectively have the highest number of registered provincial sites in the list of national sites.[11]\n\nEtymology\n\nRichard Nelson Frye suggested Urartian origin for the name,[12] while T. Burrow connected the origin of the name Urmia to Indo-Iranian urmi- \"wave\" and urmya- \"undulating, wavy\".[13]\n\nThe name could also derive from the combination of the Assyrian Aramaic words Ur (ܐܘܪ; a common name for cities around Mesopotamia, meaning \"city\") and Mia (Syriac: ܡܝܐ, lit. 'water'), \"City of Water\" referring to the great Lake Urmia nearby.[14] Compare Urhay, Ur of the Chaldees.\n\nVariants and alternatives\n\nAs of 1921, Urmia was also called, Urumia and Urmi.[15][16] During the Pahlavi dynasty (1925–1979), the city was called Rezaiyeh (رضائیه)[b] after Reza Shah, the dynasty's founder, whose name ultimately derives from the Islamic concept of rida via the Eighth Imam in Twelver Shia Islam, Ali al-Ridha.\n\nIn his seyahatname, Evliya Çelebi referred to the city as Rûmiyye (Ottoman Turkish: رومیه), also mentioning that the Mongols called the city Urumiye (Ottoman Turkish: اورمیه), Persians Rûmiyye-i Kübrâ (Ottoman Turkish: رومیه كبری), and some historians Türkistân-ı İrân (Ottoman Turkish: تركستان ایران), which he justified by the considerable amount of Turkoman awliya in the city.[17]\n\nDue to the city's contact with many ethnic groups and cultures throughout its history, the name of the city has many linguistic variants:\n\nPersian: ارومیه, pronounced [oɾumiˈje] ⓘ[a]\n\nArmenian: Ուրմիա, romanized: Urmia[18]\n\nAzerbaijani: اورمیه, romanized: Ūrmiya, or اورمو, Ūrmū[19]\n\nKurmanji Kurdish: ئورمیە, romanized: Ûrmiye[20]\n\nSorani Kurdish: ورمێ, romanized: Wirmê[21]\n\nSyriac: ܐܘܪܡܝܐ, romanized: Urmia[22]\n\nHistory\n\nAccording to Vladimir Minorsky, there were villages in the Urmia Plain as early as 2000 BC, with their civilization under the influence of the Kingdom of Van. Excavations of the ancient ruins near Urmia led to the discovery of utensils that date to the 20th century BC. In ancient times, the west bank of Urmia Lake was part of Gilzan, and in the 9th century BC an independent government ruled there, which later joined the Urartu or Manna empire; in the 8th century BC, the area was a vassal of the Asuzh government until it joined the Median Empire.\n\nAssyrians who did survive the invasion of Baghdad by Timur fled through northern Iraq up into the Hakkari Mountains to the west of Lake Urmia and the area remained as their homeland until the 19th century.[23][24]\n\nDuring the Safavid era, the neighboring Ottoman Turks, who were the archrivals of the Safavids, made several incursions into the city and captured it on more than one occasion, but the Safavids successfully regained control over the area. When in 1622, during the reign of Safavid king Abbas I (r. 1588–1629) Qasem Sultan Afshar was appointed governor of Mosul, he was forced to leave his office shortly afterwards due to the outbreak of a plague. He moved to the western part of Azerbaijan, and became the founder of the Afshar community of Urmia. The city was the capital of the Urmia Khanate from 1747 to 1865. The first monarch of Iran's Qajar dynasty, Agha Muhammad Khan, was crowned in Urmia in 1795.\n\nDue to the presence of a substantial Christian minority at the end of the 19th century, Urmia was also chosen as the site of the first Christian missionaries from the United States in Iran in 1835 led by Justin Perkins (1805–1869) with Asahel Grant (1807–1844); and followed by Fidelia Fiske (1816–1864), Joseph Gallup Cochran (1817–1871), and Joseph Plumb Cochran (1855–1905).[28] Another mission was soon underway in nearby Tabriz as well. During World War I, the population was estimated by Dr. Caujole to be 30,000 people, and a quarter of which (7,500) were Assyrians and 1,000 Jews.[10]\n\nDuring the 19th century, the region became the center of a short-lived Assyrian renaissance with many books and newspapers being published in Syriac. Urmia was also the seat of a Chaldean diocese.[29][30]\n\nDuring late 1914 Ottoman forces under the command of Enver Pasha stepped up clandestine activity in the region with the aim of committing the Ottoman Empire to war.[31] During World War I, the city changed hands several times between the Russians and the Ottoman troops and their Kurdish allies in the following two years.[32] In 1914, before the declaration of war against Russia, Ottoman forces crossed the border into Persia and destroyed Christian villages. Large-scale attacks in late September and October 1914 targeted many Assyrian villages, and the attackers neared Urmia. Due to Ottoman attacks, thousands of Christians living along the border fled to Urmia.\n\nMany Christians fled during the Russian withdrawal from Azerbaijan at the beginning of January 1915, and 20,000 to 25,000 refugees were left stranded in Urmia. Nearly 18,000 Christians sought shelter in the city's Presbyterian and Lazarist missions. Although there was reluctance to attack the missionary compounds, many died of disease. Between February and May (when the Ottoman forces pulled out), there was a campaign of mass execution, looting, kidnapping, and extortion against Christians in Urmia. More than 100 men were arrested at the Lazarist compound, and dozens (including Mar Dinkha, bishop of Tergawer) were executed on 23 and 24 February.\n\nThe Russian army advanced later in 1915.[citation needed] After Russia's withdrawal as a result of the 1917 Russian Revolution, about 5,000 Assyrian and Armenian militia policed the area, but they frequently abused their power and killed Muslims without provocation.\n\nFrom February to July 1918, the region was engulfed by ethnic violence. On 22 February, local Muslims and the Persian governor began an uprising against the Christian militias in Urmia. The better-organized Christians, led by Agha Petros, brutally crushed the uprising; hundreds (possibly thousands) were killed. On 16 March, Mar Shimun and many of his bodyguards were killed by the Kurdish chieftain Simko Shikak, probably at the instigation of Persian officials fearing Assyrian separatism, after they met to discuss an alliance. Assyrians went on a killing and looting spree; unable to find Simko, they murdered Persian officials and inhabitants. The Kurds responded by massacring Christians, regardless of denomination or ethnicity. Christians were massacred in Salmas in June and in Urmia in early July, and many Assyrian women were abducted.\n\nChristian militias in Azerbaijan were no match for the Ottoman army when it invaded in July 1918. Tens of thousands of Ottoman and Persian Assyrians fled south to Hamadan, where the British Dunsterforce was garrisoned, on 18 July to escape Ottoman forces approaching Urmia under Ali İhsan Sâbis. The Ottoman invasion was followed by killings of Christians, including Chaldean archbishop Toma Audo, and the sacking of Urmia.\n\nDemographics\n\nEthnic composition\n\nThe city has been home to various ethnic groups during its history. The population of Urmia in the early Islamic period was Christian.[51] In late 19th century, George Curzon reported a population of 30 to 40 thousand people, chiefly Afshars, Nestorians, Jews, and Armenians,[52] while other sources also referred to an additional Persian community.[53] At the beginning of the 20th century, the city had a significant Christian minority (Assyrians and Armenians).[8][54] According to Macuch, and Ishaya, the city was the spiritual capital of the Assyrians, who were influenced by four Christian missions that had been established in the city in the period from 1830 to the end of World War I.[55] A large number of the Assyrians and Armenians were killed in 1914 during the Armenian and Assyrian genocides,[56] which resulted in a change in the city's demographics.[55] In the fourteenth edition of Encyclopædia Britannica from 1929, the town's population was roughly estimated to be 45 thousand before the war, mainly being Turkish with Armenian and Nestorian minorities.[57] During the era of Reza Shah Pahlavi, Iranian Assyrians were invited to return to the region, and several thousand did return. There are around 5,000 Assyrians remaining in the city.[58]\n\nUntil the Iran crisis of 1946 and the Establishment of the State of Israel in 1947, several thousand Jews also lived Urmia, and their language (Lishán Didán) is still spoken by an ageing community in Israel.\n\nAccording to the Federal Research Division of Library of Congress, ethnic Azeris form around 40% of the population of Urmia region.[59] The majority of the city's residents are Azerbaijanis, with a large minority of Kurds, and a smaller number of Assyrians, and Armenians, as well as Persian-speakers who moved to the city mostly for employment.[60]\n\nThe majority of the population can speak the official language of Iran, Persian, in addition to their own native tongue.[61][62]\n\nReligion\n\nThe city is the archiepiscopal see of the Eastern Catholic Metropolitan Chaldean Catholic Archeparchy of Urmyā, which has a suffragan in Salmas. There are also Protestants, Church of the East adherents and Armenian Orthodox. There are four churches in the central part of the city, two being Assyrian Church of the East, one Armenian, and one Chaldean.[63][64]\n\nWhen 17th-century explorer Evliya Çelebi visited the region, the city's Muslim population was mostly Sunni and not yet converted to Shia Islam.[17] Around 1900, Christians made up more than 40% of the city's population; however, most of the Christians were either killed when the Ottoman Empire invaded Qajar Iran and committed genocide against Urmia's Assyrian and Armenian population[65] or fled shortly after the end of the war. Approximately 15,000 Assyrians reside in northern Iran, in Urmia and various Assyrian villages in the surrounding area. The Christian history of Urmia is well preserved and is especially evident in the city's many churches and cathedrals.\n\nHistorical populationYearPop.±% p.a.1986300,746— 1991357,399+3.51%1996435,200+4.02%2006583,255+2.97%2011667,499+2.74%2016736,224+1.98%source:[68]\n\nPopulation\n\nUrmia is the 10th-most populous city in Iran. At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city's population was 577,307 in 153,570 households.[69] The following census in 2011 counted 667,499 people in 197,749 households.[70] The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 736,224 people in 225,050 households.[2] The majority of the city's residents are Azerbaijanis, with a large minority of Kurds, and a smaller number of Assyrians, and Armenians, as well as Persian-speakers who moved to the city mostly for employment.[60]\n\nParks and touristic centres\n\nThe tourist attractions of the city of Urmia include many parks and coastal villages lying on or near the shores of Lake Urmia. The oldest park in Urmia, called Park-e Saat, was established in the first Pahlavi era. Urmia's largest park is Ellar Bagi Park (Azerbaijani \"People's Garden\") along the Shahar Chayi, or the \"City River\".\n\nLakes and ponds\n\nUrmia Lake Natural Park\n\nHasanloo Lake\n\nMarmisho lake\n\nShahrchay ِDam\n\nUrmia Lake Islands\n\nLagoons\n\nHaft Abad\n\nSoole Dokel\n\nDana Boğan\n\nAli Pancesi\n\nIsti Sou\n\nParks\n\nPark-e Saat (Clock Park)\n\nPark-e Jangali (Jungle Park)\n\nEllar Bagi (People's Garden)\n\nPark-e Shahr (City Park)\n\nPark-e Saheli (Riverside Park)\n\nPark-e Shaghayegh\n\nAlghadir Park\n\nTokhmemorghi (Oval) Park\n\nGhaem Park\n\nScenic coastal villages:\n\nChichest\n\nBari\n\nFanoos\n\nSier\n\nBand\n\nKhoshako\n\nLandscape attractions:\n\nQasimlu Valley\n\nKazem Dashi Islet in Lake Urmia\n\nKashtiban Village\n\nImamzada Village\n\nSilvana Region\n\nRashekan to Dash Aghol\n\nNazloo\n\nDalamper\n\nKaboodan Island[71]\n\nClimate\n\nUrmia's climate is cold semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSk, Trewartha: BS), bordering on humid continental climate (Köppen: Dfa, Trewartha: Dc), with cold winters, mild springs, hot dry summers, and cool autumns. Precipitation is heavily concentrated in late autumn, winter (mostly in the form of snow), and especially spring, while precipitation is scarce in summer. Temperatures in Urmia are much colder than most of the remainder of Iran. The drought of Urmia Lake will have a negative impact on the climate of the region.\n\nBeing on the downwind and rain shadow side of the Zagros mountains, its winters are relatively drier and less snowy than Hakkari's (to the west) in southeastern Turkey due to the foehn effect.[72]\n\nSport\n\nSports are an important part of Urmia's culture. The most popular sport in Urmia is volleyball. Urmia is considered Iran's volleyball capital, and that is because of the ranks that Shahrdari Urmia VC got in Iranian Volleyball Super League and for the great volleyball players who play on the Iran men's national volleyball team (such as Saed Marouf, Abdolreza Alizadeh, and Milad Ebadipour) and first-class coaches in Iran. Recently, Urmia has also been called \"the city of volleyball lovers\" by the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (International Volleyball Federation, FIVB) official website.\n\nThe 2010 Asian Men's Cup Volleyball Championship was held in Ghadir Arena in Urmia, 2012 WAFF Futsal Championship, and the 2012 Asian Junior Men's Volleyball Championship was also held in Urmia. It is also one of the venues of the 2019 FIVB Volleyball Men's Nations League.\n\nCulture\n\nAzerbaijanis hold festivals and ceremonies such as Nowruz and Eid al-Adha like other Iranian ethnic groups with small differences.[75] Ashik music is one of the features of the Turkish speaking people of the world. It has different versions in Iran. Meanwhile, as many experts of this art testify the Urmia Ashik, is the most original and oldest version in the world, which has preserved its origin until the present day. Ashik music has its unique styles. As a piece of the culture of Azerbaijan, Urmia Ashik music has been registered in Iran's national heritage.\n\nMuseums\n\nNatural History Museum – Displays the animals native to the vicinity of Urmia.\n\nUrmia Museum – Archaeological museum affiliated with the faculty of Shahid Beheshti University.\n\nUrmia Museum of Crafts and Classical Arts.\n\nUrmia Museum of َAnthropology.\n\nEducation\n\nThe first modern style school established in Urmia in 1834.[76]\n\nHigher education\n\nUrmia was an important centre for higher education approximately a century ago; indeed, the medical college of Urmia, which was built by Joseph Cochran and a team of American medical associates in 1878, is the first modern university of Iran.
