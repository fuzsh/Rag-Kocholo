This posifiive trend in our discipline provides an indication of international scholars' understanding of the fact that throughout~the ent~r.post-war period, and especially . in the last one-and-a-half to two decades, the importance for worldwide politics _ and for the fate of the earth and mankind of relations between the great socialist power, the USSR, and the leading world capitalist nation, the USA, has been growing. The Soviet reader recently received one of the most substantial and thorough studies un this subject, a monograph devoted to the global strategy of the USA in ~erms of the scientific and technological revolution. It was written by associates of the USSR Academy of Sciences' United States of America and Canada Institute in collabora- tion with a number of authors employed in institutions engaged in putting into practice Soviet foreign policy. - - The authori3l collective successfully attempted to examine, on a total basis, how the ~lobal strategy of the USA has been changing in terms of and under the influence of the scientific and technological revolution. Changes in this area occurring in the 1970's, which were distinguished by dynamism and significant improvements in interna- ~ tional ~ffairs, interested the authors first and foremost. Thus, the period of international detente for which the Soviet Union, other socialist countries and all peace-loving forces h3ve fought so unselfishly, and to the sound appeal of which 'rationally-thinking statesmen in the USA responded, was the subject of research. The great merit of the work lies in the fact that the authors do not simply trace this or that aggregation of facts and phenomena concerning the global pplicy of the USA but accompany the analysis with valuable syntheses. This is a characteristic not only 1 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300080045-1 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300080045-1 L Va\\ VL L 161+a1L L~�u va~u~ or the first chapter, constituting a theoret~cal introd;~ct~on to the subject of research, but also of the remainialg chapters, ~n wi~icI~ specific courses of American global policy are examined. ~ 'The authors rightly note that only Marxist-Leninist theory has succeeded in properly explaining new phenomena resulting from the scientific and technological revolutian - in the complex picture of the current epocfi. The scientific and technological revolu- tion is a process born of prolonged accumulation of human I:nowledge in various areas, which has led to fundamental qualitative improvements. The essence of this revalution lies precisely in the broad incursion of science and scientific methods into publ~c production and other spheres of social events, and in tfie creation of a complex mechanism which provides a new, essentially higher le�vel of organization and mobili- zation of the primary creative powers of humanity; its intellectu.al potential and accomplished works. This is also the original source of tfie continuously accelerating flow of innovations in all fields, which is driven by the contemporary scientific and technological revolution\" (p.8). This revolution is ever more strongly exerting influence on all spheres of public a life, and it is changing many established, tradi.tional ideas. The authors illustrate ~ this concept by pointing to the fact that, as a result of the scien'tific and techno- _ logical revolution, notions regarding the power and might of contemporary governments ~ have changed. Their writings assert that the issue here is not limited to processes ~ occurring in science, technoloQy and industry< Another still more important aspect j of the problem involves characteristics of soc:al and poli~ical conditions in the ; world in which the scientific and technological revolution is unfolding. Above all, this concerns the class struggle both in individual countries and on a worldwide scale, and the historically inevitable conflict between socialism and capitalism. The scientific and technical revolution, the autbors of the study convincingly show, is revealing truly unlimited possibilities for the solution of the most acute problems _ facing Y~umanity--overcomtng poverty and hunger, conquering diseases and prolonging human life, and accelerating progress in under-developed nations. Capitalism, how- ever, hinders the utilization of the scientific and technological revolution for the welfare of people. In the first place, the fruits of the scientifir and technological revolution are directed towards satisfying the profit-making interests of the bourgeoisie in capitalist countries. In the second place, the most reactionary and aggressiwe - forces in the bourgeois world are pursuing an international policy of the kind which is creating a threat to the very existence of mankind, including the ultimate degree of this threat, thermo-nuclear war. Fortunately for the earth and the fate of mankind, socialist countries, because of the class nature of their social strt~cture, are using the achievements of the scientific - and technological revolution differently. They are directing them towards the dis- covery of wider means fflr social progress than were ever possible before, and similarly towards strengthening the cause of peace and national security and preventing thermo- nuclear war. - American capitalism is attempting to use the scientific and technological revolution to solve the social pro~lems whose contradictions are tearing it asunder and threaten- ing its very existence. However, in the end, as the authors rightly note, this will merely lead to further undermining the foundations of the obsolete social system and aggravating the contradictions of this society. Because of its economic and military- technological capability, the USA has simultaneously determined on using the fruits - of the scientific and technological revolution in the class goals of its foreign 2 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300080045-1 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300080045-1 _ _ FOR OFFICIAL USE ONL~' policy. The authors justifiably prov~de the following classification of trends in the utilization of the scientific and technological revolutior_ in the foreign policy of the USA: first, there is the improvement of military technology with a view towards creating ~ military machine needed for the realization of American imperialismTs aggressive intentions; second, there is the use of scientific and technological capability with a view towards foreign economic expansion; third, there is the establishment of new forms of dependence and relationships witn other nations, under wfiich those nations would be bound to American scientific and technological potential; fou-th, there is the use of scientific and technological~achievements in the very process of preparing, working out and formulating foreign-policy decisions (pp. 12-13). The problem stemming from resources of scientific and technological progress which have b~en channeled into military potential for the subsequent employment of military r~ight in foreign policy,forms, as it should, one of the main sections in the book. A primary feature of the scientific and technological revolution in the USA is the = fact that it first showed ug in those sectors of science, technology and industry _ which were engaged in developing, creating and producing weapons and other military equipment. Tfie revolution in military technology led to the emergence of a weapons _ and military equipment system characterized by an abrupt leap in effectiveness which, in turn, led to a change in military doctrines and ideas and former notions about war. Tr.e authors distinguish four stages in the scientific and technological revolu- tion of the USA's military enterprise: first, the creation of the atomic bomb, usher- ing in the era of nuclear arns; second, the creation of the hydrogen bomb with still greater destructive pow~r; third, the appearance of inter-continental ballistic missiles capable of quickly and accurately delivering nuclear charges to distant continents; fourth, the development of space satellites providing the capability of creating global systems of reconnaissance, co~mand and navigation, Theae processes have been accompanied by an accelerated development of other types of weapons for mass destruction--chemical and bacteriological--and similarly, by substan- tial qualitative changes in so-called conventional arms systems. The sci.entific and - technological revolution transformed all types of armed forces--land, air and naval. ' The authors consequently conclude: \"The development of a revolution in military technology, placed in the service of aggressive interests, is one of the factors con- tributing to an increased likelihood of war and is capable of leading to the annihilation of mankind\" (p. 57). The au~hors convincingly show how, for this reason, the Soviet ~ Union, other socialist countries and virtually all forces struggling for detente and the preservation of peace consistently and persistently support the conclusion of international treaties and agreements which, on the basis of equality and without ir.flicting damage to the security of either side, would avert a further arms race based on achievements of the scientific and technological revolution. This is the purpose served by the treaty for the lir~itation of strategic offensive arms signed in Vienna in June 1979 by L. I. Brezhnev and J. Carter--which, however, through the ~ fault of the American side has not been implemented. The authors justifiably note, in connection with negotiations on arms limitation, that \"the develapment of the revolution in military technology may be outstripping the pace of negotiatia:~s for arms`Zimitations and reduction\" (p. 57). The opponents of detente are guilty of this. Taking into account�the historial course of such negotiations and their practical results., the authers probably have a right to be more categorical in this instance, and instead of \"may be outstripping,\" could say - \"is outstripping.\" They do so state in chapter three: \"One of the characteristics 3 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300080045-1 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300080045-1 of the scientific and technological revolution in the military consists of the .fact that its pace quite Qften outstrips the pace of negotiations for the gurpose of limiting and reducing armaments,\" and \"tfie scientiFic and technological achievements applied to the military o2ten exert a destabflizing influence on the arms limitation and reduction process, hinder on-going negotiations and complicate the achievement of accords\" (p. 109). This tendency, unfortunately~, does exist and has recently been intensifying. The chapter devoted to this problem contains, as do all the others, a great deal of factual and statistical material supporting the authors' conclusions. It has been derived from a broad range of American sources from among which the most reliable and authoritative were selected. Painstakingly tracing the evolution of the foreign economic strategy of the USA in - the 1970's, the authors show that this constitutes a process of accomodation by American imperialism to new conditions created in the course of the scientific and technological revolution and an aggravation of the over-all crisis in capitalism. American imperialism seeks to make maximal use of its economic power and its huge scientiFic and technological potential to stren~then the USA's international position and uchieve its economic and political goals. The foreign economic strategy of the _ USA reflects the expansionist tendencies of American capital and its striving towards widening its market, gaining broader access ta world economic resources and using tlie advantages of international capitalistic division of labor for the sake of extracting maximum profits. This strategy has as its aim the enhancement of other capitalist nations' dependence on the USA and the preservation of the inequitable i economic relationships with imperialists countries' former colonial possessions. i American foreign economic strategy is clos~ly connected with foreign policy. It represents its continuation, constituting an economic implement in American imperialism's arsenal of foreign-policy resources. A great deal of attention is devoted in the book to the development o� scientific _ and technological bonds between the USA and the USSR in terms of the scientific and technological revolution. As a result of the furious growth of the scientif.ic and technological revolution in the second half of tfiis century, an important new trend has emerged--inter-government collaboration in the field of science and technology. The objective, natural ri~htness ot the growth of socialized production and the inter- nationalization of science and technology dictate the need for extending such - col~~~oration. Scientific and technological ties between governments are an indispen- sible ~upplement to stable econamic relations responsive to present trends in division of labc,� on the world market. The authors show that, under current conditions, the d~velopment of scientific and technological collaboration between the Soviet Union and the USA, whose share of the worldwide volume of scientific research constitutes more than two-thirds, takes on special significance (p. 362). The association of their scientific and technological efforts would perm;.t the accomplishment of tasks of interest not only to the people of these countries but also to a11 humankind. For a long time the ruling establishment of the USA rejected a course of normal development of relations with the Soviet Union. After the Second World War, when the USA enjoyed a temporary monoply in the unclear field, their ruling establishment counted on militarily \"driving back\" the Soviet Union from the positions occupied by it in Europe and the world, and on \"internal transformation\"--on the degeneration of the Soviet social order under the influence of econo~ic and political pressure from outside. The development of a world alignment of forces, how+~ver, quickly indicated the illusory nature of these calculations. So, in the 1970's the USA became convinced that they should not build relations proceeding from American \"technological leadership\"--using 4 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300080045-1 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300080045-1 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY it as a lever to exext pressure-~and that these xelat~.ons could only be built on the basis of princ~ples of ~qual~ty and mutual ac~vantage and of non-interference in each sideTs domestic affairs. Tiie T470~s demonstraCed in every way the mutual advan- ` tage for the USSR and the USA of scientific and Ceclznological collaboration carried out on the basis of these principles. Howe~er, in the USA a perception of new realiti2s in tfie contemporary international situation is occurring in terms of acute domestic struggle and the collision of various trends and points of view--from mal~cious anti-communism to a realistic evalu- ation oF the zaorld situation. Recent years have witnessed the beginning of a return to power in the USA of those interests w~wse ideologists think that the USA, while placing its trust ir_ military force, should at the same time rely more and more on \"non-military power factors\" in tFie struggle agains~t the USSR and other socialist countries. The authors write that tliis course has found its expression in the limitation of scientific, technological and economic collaboration with the USSR as a means of pressure, accompanied by an expansion of such collaboration with Beijing, including the objective of stimulating the growtfi of its military and technological potential which is ~ikewise viewed as a means of pressuring the Soviet Union. \"In this, the objective, as far as it can be determined, consists not so much of inflict-- ing damage on socialist nations by artificially restricting the growth of collabora~ion as of weakening and, as far as is possible, defeating the processes of detente,\" the book states (p. 48). Work on the book was completed before the government of the USA made the radical change in its policy from detente to a new edition of the \"cold war,\" and befare the tim~ that this change was fully recognized by world public opinion. The value of the research iinder consideration here lies in the fact that not only does it analyze _ American foreign policy and strategy over the course of an important decade in world policy and strategy over the course of an important decade in world politics but it also leads the reader to an understanding of American policy at its present stage. The June 1980 Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee stated: \"Aggressive imperialist forces have, however, recently countered these positive processes with a policy dictated by a reluctance to deal with the tealities of the contemporary world--the strengthening of socialist positions, the success of the national liberation move- ment and the growth of freedom-loving, democratic forces as a whole. Imperialism would like to slow down the objective process of the world's renewal. Leaders of the NATO military block, first and foremost the USA, have embarked on a course aimed at destroying the military balance established in the world in order to serve their ends and inflict damage on the Soviet Union and socialist countries and to undermine inter- r>ational detente and national security.\"* A reader having become familiar with the work being reviewed will be better prepared to understand the changes occurring today in the global strategy of the USA as well as having obtained a clear, scientific impression of what this strategy and the foreign policy of the USA was in the 1970's.

F. Matveyeva of the book \"Keniya: vybor puti_. Osnovnye etapy i problemy osvoboditel'no~o dvizheniya\" [Kenya: Choice of Path. Major Stages and Problems in the Liberation Movement] by L. Vladimirov, Politizdatel'stvo, Moscow, 1979, 17,000 copies, 279 pages] [Text] At its very beginning, the author of the work reviewed here correctly underscores the fact that in the history of the liberation move*,nent in Kenya, \"there are many peculiarities whose study and correla~ion have urgent scientific and ideological-political significance.\" An appraisal of the specific character of Kenya's historical development is important to an understanding of the connections between the principles and characteristics of the national-liberation movement and of the subsequent development of Afro-Asian countries involved in working out current - problems of this process. Kenya is a country \"whose people were among the forefront of progressive f.orces in Africa during the period of struggle for independence\" (pp.4-5), and a country where advocates of tadical economic and social transforma- tions exerted appreciable influence on its domestic political development in the first years after achieving political sovereignty. In our time, the government of Kenya takes compromising positions within the scope of national-reformism, as this country's social development constitutes one of the most striking examples of evolu- tion along a capitalist path. The apparent contradiction between Kenya's present stage of dev~lopment and the entire course of its national-liberation mavement can be explained only by profound study of all stages of the national-liberation struggle in Kenya, the dynamics of its growth and by inventory of a multitude of internal and external, objective and sub~ective factors. In the work, perhaps for the first time, the course of the liberation struggle in Kenya from its birth up to and including the present period is traced in reference to Marxist positions. The book's merit is its strong documentary foundation, at the - basis of which lies a unique wealth of factual material gathered by the author over the course of several years' stay in Kenya. A study of the early stages of the anti-colonial struggle in Kenya, characteri.zed by uncoordinated actions taken by the native population against the seizure by the English ~ of land and against inhuman treatment, which become a formally-organized movement by the 192~'s and 1930's, has enabled L..V.ladimirov to deepen and widen the interpretation of fundamental questions involving the development of this country. It convincingly demonstrates that the \"Mau-Mau\" uprising (1952-1956) did not crop up spontaneously. 6 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY ~l APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300080045-1 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300080045-1 ' FOR O~FICIAL USE ONLY Having this in mind, the process of its preparation--political, organizational and military--is analyzed in detail and tfie role of Kenyats first mass national organiza- tion, the Kenya African Union (KAU), in this preparation and in the uprising itself is characterized. The treatment of the subject is supplemented by an analysis of the lessons of this uprising (pp. 84-86) which have general theoretical significance. Developmental stages in Kenya's anti-colonial movement of tw~ opposing tendencies-- radical and moderate--leading to the formation, on the eve of the declaration of independence, of the so-called right and left alignment in tfie Kenya African National Union (KANU), which became the nation's ruling party after its acquisition of politi- cal sovereignty, are examined in the book. The essence of the ideological divergences between these alignments (which caused the schism in KAN[J and the departure from it of the Kenya People's Union--the KPU) is rightly connected here with the conflict which had unfolded between them over the issue of the nation's future course of development. Of great importance here is an appraisal of the ideological platform and activiry of the KPU which, in spite of the brevity of its existence (from 1966 to 1969), not only left a noticeable mark on Kenya's po'litical life but also \"was largely a prototype of avant-garde parties--parties of socialist orientation--which in t:~e 1970's were established in developing states in Asia and Africa\" (p. 198). Uncovering the reasons which made possible the removal of the KPU from the political. arena, the author points out, first and foremost, the subversive activity of neo- colonialist interests which, in their endeavor to keep Kenya in their sphere ~f influence, supported in every way possible rightist elements in the government and in KANU. He also points out the weakness of the organizational structure of the KPU, symbolized by the vagueness of its idaological and political slogans. The combination of these factors largely conditioned the victory of the ideology of _ national-reformism which actively supports representatives of the rising national bourgeoisie in Kenya, a victory which has cleared the way for the growth of capitalist attitudes in this country under the slogan of \"African Socialism\" and has facilitated the activity of foreign monopolies. At the outset of the analysis of the domestic political development of independen\"t Kenya and the methods employed by the KPI7, L. Vladimirov states a series of proposi- tions worthy of the most steadfast attentidn, which touch on \"fundamental issues of present-day political life in African states\" (p. 199), and supports them with facts characterizing the political development of a number of other African countries-- Ethiopia, Tanzania and MozaTabique (.p~. 201-209) . Put in first place here are questions concerning prerequisites for the creation of \"an avant-garde party oriented towards socialism and built on advanced organizational principles corresponding to this ideology\" (p. 200). As the author indicates, the multi-party system in African states is objectively justified when supporters of national-reformism are at the head of the ruling party, meanwhile leaving only a party of socialist orientation to fully defend the interests of the working public. But where the ruling party \"shares an advanced ideology oriented towards socialism\" and simultaneously carries out \"profound economic and social changes in the interests of workers, national concerns do not require the formation of other parties\" (p. 201). Even if revolutionary transformations begin without the presence of an avant-garde party, its creation is subsequently necessary for their successful consolidation (ibld . ) . 7 FOR OFFICLAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300080045-1 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300080045-1 rvn ~rrlLiru, u~n uivLx Basic trends in Kenyats foxei.gn policy are Brought out ~.n the study, and ~ts inseparable connection with the grouring alignment of pol;ttical forces in the country is emphasized. The acquisition of independence, t~ie end of Kenya's foreigr? political ~solation, the support of left-wing forces for tFLe development of mutually-advantageous collaboration with all-even in socialist states--created favorable prerequisites for sett%ng this country on a progressive foreign-policy course. However, a major obstacle to this - was the gradual consolidation in the gc~vern~~nent of Kenya of the positions of the nati.onal-reformists, who sought to direct all of Kenqa~s foreign ties toward th.e West. Examining the broad scope of various aspects of the national-liberation movement in Kenya, L. Vladimirov comes t~ the conclusion that t~e history of this movement \"con-- f~.rms the relevance and applicability of Trlarxism-Leninism and of the extremely important theoretical generalizations and conclusions contained in documents of the CPSU and the international communist and workersT movement\" (p. 241). The clear-cut periodization of the Kenyan people's l~beration movement presented in the work (ibid.~ emphasizes tre huge ~mportance for it of major events of international significance determining the course of the world revolutionary process. The author's chosen method of analyzing concrete material primarily proposes to portray by its example general laws governing the nationa\"1-liberation movement in developing countries. Agparently because of this, certain aspects characterizing _ the conditions of forming and developing the national liberation struggle in Kenya are insufficiently touched,on in the book, or are mentioned in passing. The author, it is true, made a qualifj~ing remark in his preface tn the effect that ~ his work does not include exhaustive answers to all \"extremely complicated and pressing problems\" (.p. 5) involved in the Kenyan liberation movement. At times, there is a lack in his book of sufficient \"Kenyan specifics,\" which disturbs the necessary \"balance\" of domestic and foreign, objective and subjective factors for a true understanding of the general and the particular. Summing up the social and economic policy of the go~ernment of Kenya, L. Vladimirov ~ basically concentrates attention on its negative effects. It would probably have been better to also mention certain positive facets of economic development in Kenya under independent conditions (for example, the grow:ing effort of the state to strengthen its control in economics, and its attempts to utilize foreign invest-ments in the ir~terests of national development). The future will show how consistently the Kenyan Government intends to uphold national interests in attracting foreign capital. Indeed, \"the struggle for national develop- ment\" is a slogan of the fundamental party and government document of the Kenyan leadership, \"African Sccialism and its Application to,Planning in Kenya,\" which at one time received thP support of the Kenyan people. If, at the first stage of the country's indepenc~ent development, its population as a whole uncritically accepted the actions of ~r.s leadership, the government currently, as an aggravation of social contradictior~s is accelerating the political awakening of the masses, is more and more running up against the growing dissatisfaction of the people who are deploring the dominance of foreign capital in the country's economics and protesting the aggrandizement of a few, the exploitation, unemployment and poverty of millions. This is especially urgent right now as the Kenyan leadership, heading for an ever greater subordination of the country's interests to international imperialism, has proceeded to allow the USA the right of using the country's airbases and ports for military purposes, which utterly contrad~~cts the vital interests of its people. 8 ~ FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300080045-1 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300080045-1 ~ FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY ; The usefulness perfox'~ned by the scienti,~ic xeseaxclz done by L.

The names of some Turkish socialist writers who became prominent in the 1930's are given, but it is noted that \"...in the period after Ataturk, especially in the 1950's at the time of the Menderes-Bayar dicCatorship, were the hardest and most difficult years for Turkish literary activity, a number of ;reat Turkish writers were thrown into prison, a number stayed in involuntary exile, and a writer like SebahEddin Ali was ' accidentally' shot.\" Nazim Hikmet's career-in- , exile (in th.e USSR) is reviewed; it is obaerved that Hikmet's books are now widely published and available in Turkey. \"Azerbaijan was a second fatherland for him.\" Hikmet is quoted as saying: \"I am bound to Turkey by my mc~ther tongue.

Today, however, Turkish writers and journalists have more power to say and print the truth,\" although \"certainly there are always difficulties.\" The ability of the Turkish journalist to resist talking during an interrogation is almost legendary. He relates a short story by Aziz Nesin \"The Congress of _ _ Surgeons to illus trate the point: \"At the World Con gress of Surgeons~..prominent ~ American, English, Fre:zch, German and Japanes e surge~ns were represented...(but) one simple Turkish surgeon won preeminence among them; he had removed someone's tonsils; certainly this ~s a simple everyday affair; it is logical, however, that this 'someone' was a Turkish journalistl; what happened?; the Turkish journalist would not open his mouth and the surgeon had to take them out through his anal - passage!\" On Turkish literature in general \"it is notable that...the fractionalism, conflict of political ideas and lack of clarity of subject matter among the left wing is seen in a raw form.\" \"Contemporary Turkish literature, all in all, is a psycho- logical literature aware of the people and knowing theix lives, desires and nature; it is not a literature that only describes, it also analyzes.\" As for the impact of literature on the people, \"I was witness to the respect, feeling, Z might even say solicitude toward the book in Turkey.\" The work done in translating world literature into Turkish is praised, although the low wages paid to translators ie deplored: \"the contemporary Turkish reader - has the possibility to acquaint himself with...world literature in his native language.\" Writers also earn very poorly: \"...aside from Yashar Kemal and Aziz Nesin there are no 'freelance' writers living on royalties, at least none among the writers whom I met.\" They all have other jobs. An extensive review of the process of the \"rapprochement of literature to the . people\" in Turkey is given, b eginning from the Tanzimat period. One of the major steps was \"the replacement of the Arabic script by the Latin script.\" (Elchin points out that the Azerbaijani polymath Akhundov, together with the writer Namik Kemal, had proposed Latinization in 1863 to \"the Istanbul Acadeury\" but \"his alphabet project was never carried out.\") Some Turkish writers , without a feel for the people or the importance of the national concept, in the name of a\"common humanity,\" have veered toward \"cosmopolitanism\" or \"nihilism\" because they deny \"the national esthetic affilia- tion in its wealth of creativeness.\" \"...It is interesting and significant that _ sometimes the literary process reveals truth through its own natural thrust, and - then the literary legacy takes on an objective value\".\" On the question of the continuity of literar~~ tradition, he observes that when literature \"is taken out of the socio-political, moral-esthetic context of its own period...\" it is a \"mistake.\" As an example of this type of critical error, the work by L. Alkaeva and A. Babaev \"Turetskaya Literatura\" (Moscow 1967) is cited because it is influ- enced by \"vulgar sociolo gy.\" On the regressive process in Turkish society after the death of Ataturk until the fall of the \"Menderes-Bayar dictatorship\" it is noted that \"in 1932 only nine religious schools remained in Turkey,\" but \" in 1952...(there were) 195 religious schools in which 11,836 students were studying...\" 11 F~R (1FFTC'TAT. i1SE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300080045-1 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2047/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300080045-1 Several paragraphs are devoted to the \"parnobi2nes\" Ipornobusiness] which flourishes along Istiklal Caddesi.

Erol Ozaydin publishes an 8-page monthly newsletter called HAMSHEIiRI ;from the same city] which is \"a cultural, social and current informatir~n newspaper. Its purpose is \"to acquaint the Azerbaijanis from Kars and Erzurum with our literature and culture, to raise social problems connected with their life and life style, to introduce people from Kars living in Istanbul to each other, and to create cooperation and unity among them at weddings, funerals and other social activities.\" Ozaydin \"wants us to send him material on Azerbaijani literature and fine arts as well as materials - of an historical and ethnographic character. When talking with him \"I thought about a very simple, yet not so simple truth1: how sacred and powerful is the feeling for the fatherland and for the people.\" Another magazine published for the Azerbaijanis in Turkey is KHAZAR (\"Owner, Hamid Turan; Content Editor, Kamal Gungoren; Manager, Haver Aslan; Technical Secretary, Cumhur Turan\").

The modern Assyrian language, which is spoken by most ~ssyrians, ti:as formed on the basis of t~ro substrata--the Old Aramaean and the l~ssyro-~abylonian (ak.kadian) languages.

Beginning in the Fifth Century A.~.~ their struggle against their oppres- sors assumed the religious foru of Ilestorianism. The essence of this doctrine consisted in its recognition of the human principle in Cnrist while the Virgin Mary s�ras viewed not as the P~other of God but as the i~fother of Christ, that is, the mother of a man ~,ho became God and not of God who became a man. ~ecause of religious persecutions in Byzantium and especially in Iran, the followers of this religious trend fled into Central Asia, Transcaucasia, India, and China.7 The influence of the '~ssyri.an-l~estorian culture on the peoples of Central ~sia and Transcaucasia is testified t;~, in particular, by the ~ssyrian inscriptions on monumen~s encoiintered in, Sen~i~~ch'.ye,. ~n the,regions,.of F~ishpek (Frunze;; and ToI~nak,. as r~ell as in the following places in Georgia: Shio i~igvime, ~edazeni~ ~ Garedzha, and others.9 The .~ssyrian manuscripts which have come down to us and which are located in the libraxies of rioscow, Leningrad, and Yerevan, as iJell as. those of foreign cities,l~ contain important information on the history of the , peoples of i~us', Central Asia, and Transcaucasia. :lssyrian scholars played a definite role in the development of scientific thought in the countries of the , Arab ~ast and medieval ~,urope.11 They translated the ti~orks of Aristotle, Galen, and Hippocra~es from Gree~ into Arabic, and they served as the conduits oF inany progressive ideas of their own times.12 I In the 13th--14th centuries during the period of the rion~ol domiriation the :~ssyrian- Idestorian church lost its influence.l3 At this time the Khulagids began open per- ~ secutions of the P~estorians.l~ Three groups~~of the.latter saved themselves from - persecutions. One fled ir~to India (to the Ifalabar coast)~ another to Cyprus, and ! a third, the most numerous group, concealed. themselves togeiher ~:ith their patri:- ; arch in places in ?:urdistan which were difficult to reach. ~ last refuge were the mountains in Khakyri~ in the southeastern part of Turkey. Here the tissyrians, led by the spiritual and secular leader, iyiar Shimun~ whose title was subsequently transferred from uncle to nephew, with eno~nous stubbornness i~a,ged a struggle against the Sultan's authorities from the 17th to the 19th centuries.15 ny 1778 the Roman Cathoiic church had subordinated to its influence a part of the Assyrians who were livin~ in the valleys of llorthern Iraq, They came to be called . Assyro-Chaldeans, and their leader acquired the title Fatriarch of Babylon.1E But most of the Assyrians of Turkey and Iran remained faithful to :destorianism, and they passed on their former traditions from generation to generation.

The total number of Ass;~rrian population in Turkey at that time raached 863,000 pe.rsons.22 They were densely settled in the sanjak of Khakyari, the cities of llyaxba.kir~ f~iardin, Urfa, and the villages of Juiamerk, Gyavar, ~ierge- ver, Te.rgever, Tiare, and others. Some 74~,000 were living in Iran in the north- western part of the country, in the region of Urmia.23 ~1s a result of the chauvinistic policy of the Young Turk leaders and the intrigues of the British imperialists, the assyrians were drawn into World Tilar I and entered on the side of the Entente.2~ During those yeaxs the Assyrian people was on the edge of disappearing. In batt.les and as the result of po~roms~ out of 94~0,000 ~ssy- rians in Turkey and Ira,q about 500,000 persons perished.2 In order to av~id ulti- mate annihilation, during the winter of 1914~~15 a portion of the Assyrians fron Turkey fled into Russia~ while another group fled into Tran. Tens of thousands of re.fugees perished along the ~ray from cold and 'nunger; only 20--25,000 crossed the Russian b~rder.26 After ;dorld f~1ar T the basic mas~ of the remaining ;issyrians were divided among Turkey, Iran, and Iraq. Uuring the period from 1910 to 19~?~0 many flssyrians became scattered throughoui; the Last, iurope, 'riorth and South America. In 1920 the British colonialists under the pretext of rendering aid to the Assyrian rezugees forcibly - resettled them fro~ Iran into iraq. By taking advanta.~e of their irnpoverished status~ the British authorities recruited them into special battalions to guard military facilities and. to fight against the national liberation movement of the Axabs and xurds.27 ~ubsequently the British imperialists used the ~lssyrian ques- tion as one of the pretexts for detaching the petroleum-bearing f~:osul Vilayat from `!'urkey and annexin~ it to Iraq, over which Great Britain ha.cl a, mandate.

They began to restore their ruined farms,32 and they engaged in their traditional occupations of gardening and livestock raising. As was also the case in monarchist Iraq, right up to the 1950's the assy- rians of Iran were deprived of political rights and. the opportunity for full deve- lopment. They were forbidden to have national schools~ to study their native _ language, and to publish their own literature. ~ As the result of econamic and cultural backwardness, national oppression, and a lack of political rights, the overwhe7ming majority of Assyrians who are now living , in the countries of the f~~eign East axe at an extremely low level of socioeconomic and cultural develog~nent. Only some individua.l merchants, craftsmen, and otY~er ~ members of the non-numerous well-to-do classes have acquired the opportunity to ; pa.rticipate in the active social and economic activity. Thus, at the 20th Session of the Iranian Niajlis in 1960 a person elected by the Assyrians appeared for the first time among the delegates.34� It is only in very recent times that the children o f Assyrians have been granted the opportunity to be enrolled in the state schools of Iran, Iraq, and 'I'urkey.

Ho~rever, this has had little effect on any change for the better for ' most working-class Assyrians living in foreign countries.35 Only in the USSR have tissyrians found a true homeland, along ~rith the possibility of workin~ peacefully and being confident in their future. As long a,~o as the first feh* yeaxs of the Soviet regime in places densely inhabited by ~ssyrians (the Geor- gian, Azmenian, Azerbaijani SSP's and the Krasnodax Territory) the government opened the elementary and secondary schools for their c ilci.ren; here instruction was conducted in Russian and in their native language.3~ Sta.ffs for these schools were trained at the :'~rmavir ?'edagogical Technicwn and the Leningrad Institizte' of Nistory, Philosophy, and Literature.3?

A. Kunayev.l The Soviet experience is an object of close study abroad. This interest is not only not diminishing, it is growing stronger, chiefly throug h peaceful v development of vigorous use of our experienca by the developing countries. Time, the unbiased judge of life, has proven the correctness of Marxist- Leninist ideas and the advantages of the socialist system. Therefore, in the current phase the bourgeois \"~~itics\" do not attack the results of the socio economic development of the republics of the Soviet Ea st in them- selves, but rather the theory, methods, and ways of achieving them. How- ever, modernization of the forms and me~hods of bourgeois criticism of socioeconomic transformations in the Soviet Central Asian republics cannot conceal its antisocialist essence and orientation. 22 FOR OFFICIAL USF~ ONT~Y APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300080045-1 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300080045-1 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY For this reason one of the presaing challenges of Marxist-Leninist political ecor:omy is to expose the contemporary forms and methods of bourgeois and re- visionist falsificaCions of the socioeconomic transformation in the national regions of the Soviet East. Socialist nationalization, of course, is the basis on which a socialist � economy orig~nates and grows strong. V. I. Lenin emphasized many times tihat \"there is only one way to put an end to the exploitation of labor by capital, - and that is to wipe out private ownership of the means of la~or, put all fac- tories, plants, mines, and other large establishments in the hands of the ~ whole society, and cazry on socialist produc~ion.i2 This is the crucial condition for the transition by the peoples of backward countries to so- cialism, bypassing the capitaliat system. \"TY?ere can be no dispute,\" V. I. _ Lenin said in 1920, \"that the proletariat of the leading countries can and ~ must help the other masses of working people and that the development of the ~ backward countries can come from the present stage when the victorious pro- letariat of the Soviet republics offers its hand to these masses and is able - to give them support,i3 Ttie experience of development of the peoples of Central Asia and Kazakhstan graphically demonstrate both the possibility and the n~cessiry of this transition. But the anti-Soviets, trying to discredit the Soviet experience in the eyes of the peoples of the developing countries, argue that nationali- - zation in Central Asia supposedly \"did not meet the needs of the local popu- lation,i4 that the peoples of Central Asia and Razakhstan cannot enjoy the ~ fruits of their own economic development. Thus, J. Metley, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan, writes in his book \"Central Asia. _ = A Century of Russian Rule\": \"The dev~el~pment of this region (that is, Central Asia) in many ways resembies the development of India during British rule. A modern system of transportation was created and industr~alization was begun. But the peoples of Central Asia, unlike the peoples of sovereign India, still cannot reap the final fruits of economic development stimu- lated by the Russian colonial admin;gtr.~~ion: In India, no matter how com- - plex the problems may be, there is hope for future growth based on the independent political and economic system and free trade with the entire world. Central Asian trade is lisnited to the communist bloc and its future economic development, evidently, will be linked exclusively with Russia.i5 This statement is wrong, because during the prerevolutionary period this region was unable to rise out of poverty and desolation. Only in Soviet times did it undergo strong economic and cultural development. It is also wrong because many dozens of foreign countries, some of them capitalist countries, are readily buying the output of the Central Asian republics today. For example, Kazakhstan now delivers industrial output of more than 300 types to more than 80 countries around the world.6 The industrializa- ' tion of the national regions was done in the same way as industrialization of the entire countrg, on the basis of a combination of Union-wide and local interests, rational siting of production, and knowledge and consider- ation of the requirements of the sub~ ective economic laws of socialism. Concerning India it can be said that it began quite moderate development after receiving independence, and not without material, technical, and acientif ic aid from the USSR. 23 nnn nr, r.

Thu~, R. Stuart \"proved\" that thP collective farms are necessary only to exercise political control and take surplus from the kolkhoz numbers, and collectivization aerves as a\"means of regulating the level of consumption in the countryside.\"~ The writings of bourgeois authors such as M. Levin and V. Connoly depict this process as compulsory and imposed by force,e But the agrarian transformations eliminated the social basis of exploitation and rad a beneficial impact on the material situation of the peasants. They helped the Kazakh people rid themselves for all time of the patriarchal system. Suf f ice it to say t'nat be�ore the start of World War I there were 4,563 Russian and Ukrainian households jn the seven counties of KusCanay District; 241 had about one desyatina 1.09254 hectares) , 1,261 hauseholds had 2-4 desyatinas, 1, 588 had 5-1G desyatinas, and 950 - households ha.d more than 10 desyatinas apiece.9 Tlrss, collectivization - eliminated feudal patriarchal relations and madF� possible the transition of Central Asian peasants to soc9.alism, bypassing ~capitalism. ~ _ The transition of the peasantry to a settled way of life is an important - socioeconomic transformation that occurred in Kazakhstan during the years of Soviet power. In the interpretation of the bourgeois ideologists present- day summer-pasture animal husbandry is depicted as a form of the tradi- � tiQnal nomadic economy. 7he en~nies of socialism pursue far-reaching goals. ~ They try to diminish the historical importance of settlement in one place and represent the current livestock system as a primitive, extensive system. Thus, American sociologist E. Bacon states that despite the campaign against nomadism, it continues to exist in a different form. He says that only the name is changed, that the Russians now call nomadism \"summer- pasture animal husbandry.\" This kind of sta~ement is wrong mainly on the theoretical level, because aummer-pasture animal tnisbandry and the nomadic system cannot be equated as E. Bacon does. The noma3ic system is based on available feed a11 year long and the livestock are constantly moving from one pasture to another. The radius of these wanderinffis among the Kazakhs reached 1,000 kilometers. Summer-pasture animal husbandry using available f eed is carried on only in season and the radius of grazing is small. Dur- ing the difficult winter season the livestock are kept in stalls. The conte~?porary summer-pasture system is also characterized by new forms of labor organizat ion-- mechanized herding brigades ~ a high level of educa- tion, the broad background of knowledge of contemporary herdsmen; the fact that they have permanent homes in the towns with private plots; the great importance that the state places on the honorable labor of the herdsmen. 7'he theory and practice of buildin~ socialism, both in the USSR as a whole and in its Union repu~lics, te;stifies to the scientific bankruptcy of the bourgeois allegatiflns considered above. The successes of Kazakhstan and _ the othsr tormerly b3ckward regions of the USSR show the bias of the cur- rent bourgeois myths which say that Marxist-Leninist doctrine is unac- ceptable tA peoples living under conditions of precapitalist systems. The socioeconomic development of the regions of the Soviet East is vivid testimony to the correctness of Lenin` s teaching on the possibi.lity of a transition by backward countries to socialism, bypassing the capitalist system.

Roughly 70 perc~nt of the material wealth consumed by the population is in one way or another associated with agricultural production. As more economic development takes place, the interrelationships between a~riculture on the one hand and industry and other branches on the other will expand and become more intense. Recently, serious attention has been focused on these interrelationships and also on the problems of interenterprise cooperation and agro-3.ndustrial integration, as the foundation for the efficient functioning of ' Che country's entire agro-industrial complex. In Che process, special importance ' is being attached to improvi.ng the economic mechanism for controlling agriculture and the agro-industrial complex on the whole. Based upon fulfillment of the decisions hand'ed down by the Communist Party, buth agriculture and the enCire agro-industrial complex are being developed successfully in the Batonian SSR. In 1975, the gross output of the complex increased by a factor of 2.5 compared to 1965 and in 1980 it will increase by another 27 percent and reach 2.52 billion rubles. At the preaent time, there are less than 100,000 individuals or 7.1 percent af the republic's population carrying out work at highly mechanized and large-acale agricultural enterpri,ses (sovkhozes and kolkhozes). , Each year the sovkhozea and kolkhozes produce and sell to the state, for every agricultural worker, an average of 11 tons of milk, 2.3 tons of ineat, more than 26 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300080045-1 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300080045-1 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 3,000 eggs, almost 13 tons of grain, 12 tone of potatoes and 0.6 tans of vegetablea. ' The plans for 1980 called for the following products to be produced, per capita, in the Estonian SSR: 1 ton of grain, 1 ton of potatoea, 1 ton of milk, more than 200 kilograma of ineat and roughly 400 egga. The Tenth Five-Year Plan called for an increase in the average annual volwne of aSricultural output, compared to the previous five-year plan, of 17 percent, milk 20.1, livestock and poultry 30.8 and eggs an increase of 20.2 percent. In 1975, the profitability of commodity production at sovkhozes was 42.6 percent and at kolkhozss 4305 percent. In 1978, the efficiency of agricultural production decreased as a result of poor weather conditiona. In 1979, the profitability at sovkhozes fell to 21.5 percent and at kolkhozes to 21 percent. Growth in logistical resources, without whiCh intense and efficient agricultural production is impossible, is achieved by means of aystematic increases in investmenta in the particular aphere. More than 1 billion rubles, or 30 percent more than during the Eighth Five-Year Plan, were a2located for developing the logistical base for agriculture during the Ninth Five-Year Plan in the Estonian SSR and the funds for this purpose will be increased by 10 percent during the Tenth Five-Year Plan. During 1979 and compared to the previous year, the value of the fixed production capital increased by 7 percent and the power engineering capabilities by 7.1 percent. In carrying out the production program during the Tenth Five-Year Plan, the increase in logistical resources was less than that for the Ninth Five-Year Plan. Thus, special attention was devoted to strengthening cost accounting and raising the responsibility of the farms for the utilixation of the material and financial resources allocated to a$riculture. Further improvements are taking place in the use of material resources in agriculture with each passing year and yet we are still encountering incidents wherein the farma are acquiring technical equipment which is in short supply, without sufficient juatification, and they are using such equipment in an inefficient manner. Thus, during 2979, the output for one conventional - tractor on farms throughout the ;epublic fluctuated from 551 to 1,965 hectarss (average output for the republic 1,222 hectares). ~ Iinprovements in the intensity and efficiency of agricultural production are greatly dependent upon measures aimed at improving control over the economies of the agriculCural enterprises and upon the akilful use of the economic stimuli and levera cost accounting, profit, prices, bonuses, credit. In the process, apecial importance ia attached to improving the system of price formation for agricultural output and for the industrial producta consumed by agriculture and also to the aervices provided for agriculture. ~ The measures undertaken for the purpose of improving and intensifying control over. agricultural economics (introduction of monetary wages at kolkhozes commencing in 1960, the converaion of sovkhozes over to complete coat accounting in 1967, the introduction of new principles for issuing material incentives for agricultural labor froa~ ~ sLngle source material incentive fund commencing in 1971 and so forth) promoted an acceleration in the rates of growth for gross and commodity output and also for labor productivity in agriculture. However, during the past few years the produ~tion costs for agriculture have risen steadily and this is adversely affecting the economies of the farms. Periodic increases in the 27 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300080045-1 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2047/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300080045-1 procurement prices (the last occurring on 1 January 1979) for individual products, with no improvements being carried out in price formation on the whole, preclude the possibility of noxmal conditiona existing on individua.l farms for expanded reproduction. Price formation muat be based upon a systematic appraach and promote the satablishment of interrelationahips and interdependencies between the procurement, Wholesale and wholesale factory prices for goods and the rates for providing services for agriculture and it must correctly reflect the degree of participation ' of industry and other branches in raising the efficiency of agriculture and the APK [agro-industrial complex] on the whole. Under the existing system of price formation, agriculture is a low profitability branch of material production. Thus, in 1979 the profitability of agricultural enterprises with regard to production capital in the republic was 5.6 percent and with regard to production costs 21.5 percent; for 1978, the figures were 5.8 and 22.4 percent respectively. At the same time, the profitability of enterpriaes of the Trtinistry of the Meat and Dairy _ Zndustry and Goskomsel'khoztekhnika, with regard to the value of the fixed production capital, amounted to 40 and 12.8 percent reapectively. Tha great ma.jorit,y of kolkhozes and sovkhozes (50-65 percent) operate under worse ; production conditions owing to insu�ficient savings and they utilize their ; production potential to only a minor degree. At the beginning of 1979, the ~ xepublic's agricultural enterprises had a monetary surplus amounting to 63.7 million ~ rubles and by the beginning of 1980 this surplus had decr~ased to 51.5 million rubles and was to be found mainly on tha accounta of highly profitable farms. At the same time, surplus indebtedness in terms of Gosbank credit for production requirements amounted to 84.6 million rublea (in 1979 47 million rubles) and for capital investments 159.0 million rubles (in 1979 160 million ~ubles),that ~.s, the indebtedness to Gosbank caapared to the previous year had increased on the average by 18 percent and at economically weak farms by a factor of 1.5-3. Thus, the proportion of credit is gradually increasing in the production turnover of agricultural enterprises. We are of the opinion that in order to strengthen cost accounting in capital inveatmants for expanding production, the proportion of internal �inancing sources must be increased. However, during the Tenth Five-Year Plan, this proportion of investmenta fell to 74 percent compared to 81 percent during tha Ninth Five-Year Plan. Budgetary appropriations for agricu~.ture, for measures carried out by non- agricultural enterprisea (land reclamation, zoological and veterinary services and so forth) are increasing at a rapid rate. During the 1965-1977 period, investments for this purpose incxeased on~�.the vhole throughout the country by a factor of 3.8 (more than 10 percent of the overall total of financial resources used in agric~:.lture). In the Estonian SSR, budgetary financing for land reclamation work _ alone amounted to more than 450 million rubles during the 1966-1975 period and during 4 years of the Tenth Five-Year Plan almost 250 million rubles have already been expended for this purpose. As a result, the proportion of reclaimed land from areas processed throughout the republic exceeded 50 percent and this, coupled with improvaments in the agricultural practicea, is providing comparatively high yields foz� the agricultural crops (the highest grain crop yield 31 quintals per hectare was actiie'ved in 1976; in 1979, it amounted to 24.6 quintals per hectare). However, the landa reclaimed at state expenae are qui~e often utilized incorrectly i - 28 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300080045-1 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300080045-1 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY and inefficiently by many farma. Thus, in order to raise the responsibility of the agricultural enterprises, their participation is required in the financing ~f the land rec lamation work . In the interest of creating favorable conditions for agricultural development, the state uses budgetary funds for covering a portion of the expenses of sovkhozes and kolkhozea for acquiring industrially produced products. Machines, tractors, metal, �uel, mineral fertilizers, equipment and other production resources are sold to the agricultural enterprises at favorable prices. With further expansion and intensification of agricultural productian, the budgetary expenditures for these purposes increase and this weakens the effectiveness of cost accounting stimuli both in agriculture and in industry. We are of the opinion that in the future a - gradual convezsion must be carried out from direct budgetary financing over to more camplete self-aupport by the agricultural enterprises, with the appropriate expenditures being included in [he procurement price. In addition, the budget participates actively in the formaCion of the final product of the APR. Large sums in the form of the differerice in prices for milk, meat and other agricultural products are paid out of the budget to *_he industrial enterprisQs which process the agricultural products and to the trade organizations. In the case of conetant retail prices, a subaidy is employed hera for conaumption and not for production. In recent yeara, the state budgetary outlays for directly financing the development of production dt agricultural enterprisea throughout the republic have remained at the level of 30 million rubles annually. The existing syatem for financing capital ; investments ia fraught wi.th a number of shortcomings, which preclude the possibility of making complete use of the stimulating effect of the financing-credit mechanism for raising the effectiveness of these investments. For example, in organizing the financing of state agricultural enterprises, clear and economically sound limitations between the individual sources for financing expanded reproduction 8T.�. lackir.g. ~1115 ~~:L' CE'c?~ iuVCyuuCtll 30L3!'^_�3 ti~9 dei.~c~~~:.c.~C~ ilGi, t'i`~ tj?~.' financial potential ~f the enterprises, but rather by deciding whether or not the abjects of the investments are to be financed by means of the budget. For the conatruction of livestock husbandry complexes, dwellings and cultural-domestic - installations, the budgetary appropriations are made available for the most� part ' regardless of whether or not the farms have their own resources for the stated purposes or the amounts of such resources. This lowers the stimulating value of profit in the development of production, since the obtaining of budgetary funds is not associated with the internal financial resources of enterprises and is not dependent upon the results of their economic activity. Under difficult conditions, budgetary funde can be presented not only to low-pDOfit but also to high-income farcns . At the present time, budgetary and credit financing of the planned volumes of capital investments, in the presence o� a deficit of internal funds for the stated purposes, is not associated with the actual profitability of the enterprises. This ' leads to a situation wherein the centralized and irreversible budg~stary funds for capital investments are often allocated to profitable enterprises and credits to low-profit or unprofitable enterprisea. Measures undertaken to improve the economies of a$ricultural enterprisea have still not bxought about an equalization 29 ~ FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300080045-1 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/48: CIA-RDP82-44850R000300084445-1 of the conditions for reproduction among them. In a computation for 100 hectares of agricultural land, economically strong farms employ capital investments in considerably greater amounts t~an enterprises having insufficient fixed capital and included on the list of low-pro�it enterprises. Thus, whereas at the end of 1979 the republic's agricultural enterprises poasessed on the average 21,700 rublea worth of fixed capital per 100 hectares of cultivated land, the econamicslly strong farms (poultry and hog raising farms) 60,000 rublea worth, ~nd economically backward fa~s (mainly livestock raising and vegetable raising farms) from 11,300 to 14,000 rubles worth of fixed capital. At the same time, the differences between the agricultural enterprises in the level of deveiopment of the logistical base are not only continuing, but in fact they are gradually becoming greater. AC the present time, the coefficient of variation in the equipping of the republic's _ farms with fixed production capital amounta to more than 40 percent, labor reaourc$s 44, profit per hectare of cultivated land 82 percent and so forth. In 1979, 10 percent of the aovkhozes operated at a loss or had zero results, 70 percent had pr~fitabilities of less than 25 percent and only 20 percent of the aoakhozes had profitabilities which exceeded 25 percent. Moreover, during the Ninth Five-Year Plan the coefficients of variation increased by 8 percent for equipment availability, 5 percent for the availability of labor resources and 14 percent for profit. At the present time, differences are being observed in the , conditions of management for the sovkhozes and kolkhozes. For example, the profit ~ norm per hectare of cultivated land at sovkhozes fluctuates from 13 to 1,045 rubles ~ and at kolkhozes from 43 to 506 rubles. In arder to prevent greater differentiation in the economic status of enterprises and in the interest of smoothing aut the conditions far agricultural production, we are of the opinion that a conversion shauld ideally be made over to the normative methods for planning capital investments, methods which call for a definite level of equipment availability with thE: aid of the budget and beyond the 'oudget using internal resources and bank credit. The noranative indicator should be introduced into the long-range plans for farm development and the volumes of capital in"
