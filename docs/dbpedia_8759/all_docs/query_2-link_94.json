In 1805, the khans became vassals of the Russian Empire; in November 1822, the power of the khans was abolished, while the khanate became one of the empire's territories ruled from St. Petersburg.\n\nKEYWORDS: the Karabakh Khanate, Shusha, the Jevanshir clan,\n\nPanah Ali Khan, Ibrahim Khalil Khan, Mekhti Quli Khan, Jafar Quli Agha, transfer to Russia, murder of the second khan of Karabakh, abolition of power of the khans, heir to the Karabakh Khanate, head of the khan house of Karabakh.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMy previous article \"The Khans of Karabakh\"1 looks at the history of the Jevanshir khans, the story of unification of the khanate with the Russian Empire, the death of the second khan of Karabakh, the abolition of power of the khans, and the introduction of Russia's direct rule.\n\nThe present paper traces the fates of all the generations of the clan's elder line ascending from Ibrahim Khalil Khan's elder son Muhammad Hasan Agha, who became the heir to the Karabakh Khanate under the treaty signed on 14 May, 1805 by Ibrahim Khalil Khan and Infantry General Prince Tsitsianov, Commander-in-Chief of the Russian troops in Georgia, who acted in the name of Emperor Alexander I.\n\nHere you will not find detailed biographies of the Karabakh khans that figured in the previous article. I concentrated on the life story of Muhammad Hasan Agha's elder son Jafar Quli Agha, who remained the legal heir to the Karabakh Khanate until the power of the khans was abolished in 1822. His descendants are the elders of the clan of Karabakh khans.\n\n1 See: E.E. Ismailov, \"The Khans of Karabakh: The Roots, Subordination to the Russian Empire, and Liquidation of the Khanate,\" The Caucasus & Globalization, Volume 8, Issue 1-2, pp. 127-154.\n\nTHE CAUCASUS & GLOBALIZATION\n\nIn the second quarter of the nineteenth century, the descendants of the khans of Karabakh who lived in the Russian Empire began using the Russified version of their clan name Jevanshir; this name became officially registered by the Shusha Bek Commission, which worked in Karabakh in 18701874; members of the younger lines of the same Karabakh family used the names of Panakhkhanovs (Panakhanovs), Begbudovs, Saryjalinskys, etc.\n\nIn May 1870, Second Captain of Cavalry Ahmed-bek Jevanshir, the author of political history of the Karabakh Khanate, pointed out in his application to the Shusha Bek Commission that the family name Jevanshir had belonged to Panah Ali Khan, the founder of the clan and to his descendants. The Ruling Senate registered this family name \"on the strength of the firman that we presented to the Senate; it had been granted by Shah of Persia Karim Khan Zand to Mehrali-bek, one of our common ancestors, as the Beglyarbek, that is, the ruler of the Karabakh Khanate.\" The reference is to the youngest of Panah Ali Khan's sons who ruled the khanate while his father was fighting in Urmia together with his army and stayed in Shiraz.\n\nHe further wrote: \"The fact that this name belonged to our ancestors is confirmed by the inscriptions on the tombstones of many of our ancestors that can still be seen at the cemetery in Agdam, other historical documents issued by Persian shahs kept in the family, quoted in Persian and Turkish history books about the events in which our ancestors were involved and, finally, the names of our relatives who descended from our common ancestor Panah Khan and who now live in Persia.\"\n\nAhmed-bek Jevanshir pointed out that his family name was translated into Russian as \"young lion\" and that there were many legends (some of them contradictory) about the origins of his family name. According to one of them, the name Jevanshir was a distorted Mongolian military term \"javan-gar,\" meaning the right wing of the army. According to another legend, the title \"young lion\" was conferred on one of his ancestors by Persian shahs in recognition of \"his special bravery in battle.\"\n\nHe concluded his application to the commission with, \"Anyway, this name belongs only to those members of the khan family who directly descend from Panah Ali Khan,\" and pointed out that \"we reject an appropriation of this name by any other relatives descending by the female line from Panah Khan or his relatives as unfair and if our claims are recognized we will never accept this.\"2\n\nUnder Soviet power, the name Jevanshir became Jevanshirov; in the 1920s the members of the elder line of the khan family began using this (Russified.—Ed.) version (more of them below). In the latter half of the twentieth century, the previous spelling Jevanshirov was changed to Javanshi-rov, to match the Azeri spelling. Below I will keep to the following pattern: from the seventeenth century to the 1920s—Jevanshir; from the 1920s to the 1950s—Jevanshirov, and from the 1950s to the present—Javanshirov.\n\nThe male descendants of Ibrahim Khalil Khan who lived in the Russian Empire in the nineteenth-early twentieth centuries were, as a rule, titled Agha; their wives and daughters were called Begum; and the descendants of Ibrahim Khalil Khan's brothers were \"beks\" and \"khanums,\" respectively.\n\nThe Elder Line of the Khans of Karabakh by Generations\n\nMy previous article \"The Khans of Karabakh\" contains an ascending genealogy of the khans of Karabakh presented as a Table with four versions of the first generations of the Jevanshirs.\n\nThree of the versions were borrowed from printed sources, namely, the work of Mirza Adigezal-bek, an Azeri historian of the first half of the nineteenth century, called Karabakh-name; \"Rodo-\n\n2 The State Historical Archives of the Azerbaijan Republic (hereinafter GIAAR), rec. gr. 69, inv. 1, f. 6 (On the request of Abas-bek and Agha-bek Jevanshirov to count them as belonging to the bek estate, 5 April, 1870-31 January, 1873), sheets 6-11rev.\n\nTHE CAUCASUS & GLOBALIZATION\n\nslovnaia Ibrahim-khana i ego detey\" (Genealogy of Ibrahim Khan and His Children) published in Vol. II of Akty kavkazskoy arkheograficheskoy komissii (Acts of the Caucasian Archeographic Commission); and Genealogicheskaia tablitsa Karabakhskikh khanov (The Genealogical Table of the Karabakh Khans) compiled by E. Shukiur-zade, a Soviet Azeri historian of the latter half of the twentieth century.\n\nThe fourth version is my own genealogical reconstruction based on primary sources: Iskender-bek Munshi's list of the emirs of 1628 and information derived from the firman of 1672/1673 quoted by Mir Mekhti Khazani in Kitabi-Tarixi Qarabag.\n\nI have already written in the previous article that the four versions of the genealogy of the first four generations of the Jevanshirs have only one position in common—the name of Ibrahim Khalil Agha (II), father of Panah Ali Khan, the first khan of Karabakh—of the third generation. The genealogical table published in Vol. II of the Akty and the Table compiled by Shukyur-zade share the name of Panah Ali Khan's grandfather, who belonged to the second generation.\n\nThe Genealogical Table of the Khans of Karabakh, which I compiled and published in the present article (see pp. 160-161), contains all versions of the first two generations. I start my generation-by-generation description from the third generation.\n\nThe first figure that appears before the name in the generation-by-generation description points to the person's ordinal number in the Table, and the second to the ordinal number of his (her) father.\n\nIII Generation\n\n> 3/2. Ibrahim Khalil Agha (II).\n\nHead of the Jevanshir tribe and Otuziki mahal by inheritance.\n\n> 4/2. Iskender-bek.\n\nYounger brother of Ibrahim Khalil Agha (II); the descendants of his two sons—Mirza Khan-bek and Amir Khan-bek used the family name of Saryjalinsky since the mid-nineteenth century3 (not shown in the present Table).\n\nIV Generation\n\n> 5/3. Fazl Ali-bek (?-1738).\n\nElder son of Ibrahim Khalil Agha (II); served Nadir Shakh (1736-1747) as \"eshigagasi\" (an official who supervised the palace) and was murdered.4\n\n> 6/3. Panah Ali Khan (c. 16935-July/August 17596).\n\nFounder and the first khan of the Karabakh Khanate in 1747-1759. He was married to a sister of Sekhl Ali-bek, head of the Kebirlu clan.7\n\n3 GIAAR, rec. gr. 69, inv. 1, f. 23 (On a request of the people living in the Shusha District Pasha-bek ogly Jevanshirov, Ahmed-bek Husseyn-bek ogly to include them in the bek estate, 5-23 May, 1870).\n\n4 See: Mirza Adigezal-bek, Karabakh-name, Baku, 1950, p. 51.\n\n5 This date is quoted in the book of Firudin of Shusha without specifying the source (see: F. Shushinsky, Shusha, Baku,\n\n1968).\n\n6 Not infrequently, the date of his death is cited as 1762, yet according to the tombstone, today kept at the National Museum of History of Azerbaijan, Panah Ali Khan died precisely in July/August 1759 (see footnote by E. Shukyur-zade on\n\np. 102 of A.-B. Javanshir, O politicheskom sushchestvovanii Karabakhskogo khanstva (s 1747po 1805 god), Baku, 1961).\n\n7 See: Mirza Jamal Jevanshir Karabakhsky, IstoriaKarabakha, Baku, 1959, p. 119.\n\nTHE CAUCASUS & GLOBALIZATION\n\n> 7/3. Begbut Ali-bek.\n\nBrother of Panah Ali Khan8; since the mid-nineteenth century the descendants of his three sons—Abdus Samed-bek, Mirza Ali-bek and Kasum-bek—have been using the names of Jevan-shir, Begbutovs and Rustambekovs9 (not shown in the present genealogical table).\n\nV Generation\n\n> 8/6. Ibrahim Khalil Khan (c. 1726-27 May, 1806).\n\nElder son of Panah Ali Khan.\n\nKhan of Karabakh in 1760-1806.\n\nOn 14 May, 1805, he signed an agreement on the transfer of the Karabakh Khanate to the Russian Empire. Under the treaty he preserved complete autonomy and recognized the supreme power of the Russian emperor.\n\nIn turn, \"His Imperial Majesty ... promises in his name and the names of his heirs ... to keep His High Dignity Ibrahim Khan and the house of his heirs and descendants as khans of Shusha.\"10\n\nOn 8 July, 1805, Ibrahim Khalil Khan was promoted to Lieutenant-General by a royal decree.11\n\nIn the small hours of 27 May, 1806,12 Ibrahim Khalil Khan, one of his wives, two small children, and thirteen courtiers died in an attack on their camp (four versts from Shusha) ordered by Major Lisanevich and carried out by the chasseurs of the 17th regiment.13 The details are found in the previous article.\n\nA.-K. Bakikhanov described Ibrahim Khalil Khan as \"an enterprising, openhearted, and just man who could be cruelly strict.\"14\n\nMirza Jamal Jevanshir, the last vizier of the Karabakh Khanate, wrote about Ibrahim Khalil Khan as a \"hospitable man who helped foreigners, patronized orphans, and looked after [his] subjects. [He was] energetic, brave, and generous, as a benefactor he distributed grants among big seids and the poor and patronized ulems and seids. He helped all those who sought refuge with him. The khans and beks of the nearby [districts] and vilayets of Azerbaijan, Shirvan etc. relied on his favors; he tried to help them and fulfill their wishes. He was especially fond of the company of beautiful women.\"15\n\n8 The Russian State Historical Archives (hereinafter RGIA), rec. gr. 1268, inv. 2, f. 731b (On the proposal of Vicegerent of the Caucasus Adjutant General Prince Vorontsov to grant certain persons who belong to khan families beyond the Caucasus real estate in this territory and on declining this proposal because these families had been granted life rent, 26 December, 184729 July, 1865), sheets 104rev.-105.\n\n9 Q.

The death of Muhammad Hasan Agha, of whom Prince Tsitsianov wrote as \"the most devoted and the most loyal slave\" of the emperor, deprived the Russians of their \"best support in Karabakh\" since none of the khan family was \"more loyal to Russia and served better than he.\"25\n\nIn June 1823, when Karabakh became one of the provinces of the Russian Empire, General Yermolov granted an annual pension of 250 silver rubles to the mother of late Major General Muhammad Hasan Agha, an old woman who had lost her eyesight.26\n\n17 See: A.-B.

Sub-lieutenant Mirza Adigezak-bek (the future author of Karabakh-name (History of Karabakh) and Prince Ivan Melikov, who served under Prince Abkhazov, were selected for the most responsible and hazardous part of the mission, viz. direct contacts, and coped brilliantly. Early in June 1827, General Paskevich reported to Chief of Staff Count Dibich, \"I have the honor to inform Your Excellency that the talks about pulling Mekhti Quli Khan onto our side were successful. On the 8th of this month, I received a dispatch from Karabakh that the khan had returned. On the way back, he was pursued by Persian cavalry, lost all of his carts, but safely reached Ak Karavanserai, where our troops met him. Three thousand nomadic families are following him from Daralagez to our domains.\"42\n\nVasily Potto quoted one of the members of the Russian unit who met Mekhti Quli Khan at Ak Karavanserai: \"He was met with honors and brought to the tent of General Pankratiev.\" The eyewitnesses said that \"he was an old man of 60 with a short and thin grey beard, dull and lifeless eyes, tall and thin, and carried himself proudly, a habit learned when he was the real ruler of Karabakh.\"43\n\nThere are earlier descriptions of his appearance. In his memoirs, Spaniard Juan Van Halen, who as a major of the Nizhny Novgorod Dragoon Regiment (1819-1820) fought in the Caucasus, wrote that in 1820 Mekhti Quli Khan \"looked like a man of forty or fifty; he was rather tall, his face, eyes, and beard were the same color as that of most Tatars (Azeris.—E.I.); half of his nose was missing, which he lost as a young man when fighting the Persians. In May, the khan left the capital to live outside it in a beautiful tower that stood in the mountains close to the road to Shahbulag; his harem was also there.\"44\n\nOn 7 July, 1827, under a royal decree, Mekhti Quli Khan received an annual grant of 4 thousand chervontsy and the right to administer the families who had come with him from Persia.45\n\nIn the same year, he was restored in his military rank of Major General and got back his personal land (1,315 households with the land attached to them); the emperor gave him a diamond pen.46\n\nOn 30 April, 1838, \"according to information supplied by the Chief Commander in Georgia about his outstanding services to Russia and loyalty to the Throne of All Russia and to\n\n39 See: AKAK, Vol. VII, Tiflis, 1878, pp. 457-458, Doc.

The tombstone carries an inscription in Arabic: \"This is the burial of late and forgiven General Mekhti Qulu, son of Ibrahim Khalil Khan.\"49\n\nThe wives of Mekhti Quli Khan50 were:\n\n(1) Khankhanum Begum, daughter of his uncle Mehrali-bek Jevanshir (see No. 42/9);\n\n(2) Sarai Khanum, daughter of Ahmed Khan Karachorlinsky;\n\n(3) Magi Sharef Khanum Khoyskaya, widow of his elder brother Muhammad Hasan Agha;\n\n(4) Badir Jahan Begum (1802-1861), daughter of Ugurlu Khan (III) of Ganja (she gave birth to daughter Khurshid Banu Begum Natavan, more details below).\n\nAfter the death of her husband, Badir Jahan Begum was granted an annual life pension of one thousand chervontsy by a royal decree of 3 September, 1846; she remained the owner of the landed property she had received from Mekhti Quli Khan under their marriage contract.51 In 1861, after her death, their daughter Khurshid Banu Begum inherited it.52\n\nAccording to information related to 1849-1851, \"Badyr Jan Begum, widow of Lieutenant General Mekhti Quli Khan\" (a slip of the pen; it should be \"widow of Major General\"), was a member of the Shemakha Department of the St. Nina Female Charity.53\n\n> 19/8. Abulfat Agha (1766-1839).\n\nSon of Ibrahim Khalil Khan by Rugan Khanum.54\n\nIn 1796, when Russian troops led by General Zubov had occupied several big towns in Azerbaijan and Daghestan, Ibrahim Khalil Khan sent his son Abulfat Agha to the Russian camp. Mirza Jamal Jevanshir, the last vizier of the Karabakh Khanate, left us a description of this mission: \"While Agha Muhammad Shah was still at Fars and Khorasan, General-in-Chief Count Valerian Zubov, on the orders of Her Majesty Empress Catherine, arrived with a large unit in the Derbent area, captured the Derbent fortress, and, after approaching the city of Shemakha, set up camp. Ibrahim Khan, on his own free will, sent his son Abulfat Khan and sons of several beks of Karabakh to Valerian Zubov with presents and pure-bred horses expressing his obedience and sincere feelings to the high Russian state. He had also written a request in which he expressed his loyalty to Her Majesty the Empress.\"55\n\n47 See: Sankt-Peterburgskie senatskie vedomosti, No. 22, 28 May, 1838.\n\n48 GIAAR, rec. gr. 77, inv. 1, f. 6, sheets 3-9.\n\n49 Meshadi Khanum Neymatova, \"Epigraficheskie pamiatniki Karabakha,\" in: Karabakh: istoria v kontekste konflikta, Comp. by K.K.

Commander-in-Chief Zubov let Abulfat Khan, as well as the sons of the beks and elders of Karabakh, go back home with great honors and presents and informed Ibrahim Khan [through them] that he was returning [to Russia] on an order from Emperor Paul.\"56\n\nIn 1797, Ibrahim Khalil Khan had to agree to marry his daughter Agha Begum Agha to Fatali Shah and sent his son Abulfat Agha to the court of the shah, who \"treated him as one of his noble emirs. After making him [one of[ his closest interlocutors, he invariably lavished honors on him.\"57\n\nLater Abulfat Agha was made khan and headed the Persian units, in particular during the First Russo-Persian War of 1804-1813.\n\nUnder the Treaty of Gulistan signed on 12 October, 1813, part of the Karabakh territory (Kapan, Gyuney, Meghri, and Chugundur mahals with up to 4 thousand families)58 remained in Persia. Abulfat Agha became their ruler (the Gyuney and Meghri mahals had been transferred to him earlier by his father Ibrahim Khalil Khan).59\n\nIn June 1820, General Yermolov wrote to Foreign Minister Count Nesselrode that Mekhti Quli Khan, who at that time had no children, would like to see his younger brother Abulfat Khan his heir. He had repeatedly asked General Yermolov to let his brother come back. The general, who feared that Prince Abbas Mirza had too much influence on Abulfat Khan, who \"enjoyed the special benevolence of Abbas Mirza,\" refused.60\n\nAbulfat Agha also fought in the Second Russo-Persian War of 1826-1828, which deprived him of his lands occupied by Russia.\n\nHe was also known under the pseudonym Tuti, which he used as the author of poems and ghazals in Azeri and Persian. He died in Persia and was buried in the city of Qum (Iran).61\n\nHe was married to Nisa Khanum, daughter of Mirza Rabi, vizier of King Irakly II of Kakhetia and to Badir Khanum, daughter of Ismail Khan Agha Jevanshir; he had one daughter Govhar Nisa Begum62 and six sons: Muhammad Ali Khan, Abbas Quli Khan, Muhammad Quli Khan, Muhammad Tagi Khan, Abdul Hussein Khan, and Muhammad Ibrahim Khan Jevanshir63 (his descendants lived in Persia and are not shown in the present genealogical table).\n\n> 20/8.

As soon as the new Commander-in-Chief reached Tiflis, Khanlar Agha approached him through his brother Mekhti Quli Khan 'to ask for forgiveness for his act and for permission to return to Karabakh'.\" He was forgiven and could immediately return to Karabakh, where on 16 April, 1807, he renewed his oath of allegiance, was restored to his old rank of lieutenant colonel, and started drawing his salary.67\n\nUntil 1823, Lieutenant Colonel Khanlar Agha could draw on the taxes derived from two leased budget items: rakhdar khane—trade in silk, alum, common madder, cotton, iron, steel and copper, hides, burkas, cloth, lambskin, petrol, Persian fruit, as well as commodities sold in villages (khavai-pulu) and the slaughter house: trade in horned and small cattle. In 1823, General Yermolov transferred the slaughter house and rakhdar khane to the treasury, which leased it off to private persons.68\n\nColonel Khanlar Agha was rewarded with an annual pension of 371.44 silver rubles; by the time the power of the khans was abolished the colonel owned ten villages and nomadic lands, inherited with the permission of Russian authorities; all of his possessions (except the annual pension) were inherited after his death in 1832 by his half-brother Ahmed Agha.69\n\n> 21/8.

Darga-bazaar brought revenues in kind from each batch of watermelons, melons, vegetables, fruit, fish, firewood, and coal; money from each head of slaughtered cattle and monthly income from all the shops. In 1823, General Yermolov transferred this tax to the budget, which farmed it off to private persons, while Gevhar Agha could count on remuneration.111\n\nIn December 1822, when the power of the khans was abolished, Gevhar Agha owned ten villages and nomadic lands, her inheritance rights being confirmed by the Russian government; under an imperial decree of 10 March, 1831, she received an annual pension of 952.38 silver rubles as a recompense for the lost darga-bazaar income.112\n\nShe spent her money on religious buildings and helped restore the big Friday mosque in Shusha built in 1182 Hegira (that is, in 1768/69), which was falling apart. Mirza Jamal Jevanshir, the last vizier of the Karabakh Khanate, wrote that the restored mosque \"became even more beautiful.\"113 The Arabic inscription on the main fagade of the mosque says that restoration was completed in 1302 (1884/1885) under the last will and testament of Gevhar Agha; since that time, it has been known as the Gevhar Agha mosque. She paid for the newly built upper and lower mosques and two madrassahs in Shusha in 1865/1866.114 According to waqfname, the text of which is carved on the main fagade, in 1866/1867 Gevhar Agha bequeathed her real estate (land, orchards, and shops) to two mosques and two madrassahs for charitable purposes. She used the waqfs money to open a hospital for sick vagrants called Dar ul-Shafa, paid the bills of the madrassahs, and bought books on the Shari'a and social sciences for their libraries.115 According to information for 1852-1860, Gevgar Agha, daughter of Lieutenant General Ibrahim Khan, belonged to the Shemakha Department of the St. Nina Female Charity.116\n\n> 36/8.

She was entitled to tobacco money (400 panabadi every year); under this item, tobacco trade was limited to the lease holder or agents.

In December 1805, after the death of his father Major General Muhammad Hasan Agha, who was heir to Karabakh, he was dispatched by his granddad Ibrahim Khalil Khan at the head of a Karabakh cavalry unit to punish the Karadag Kurds \"for their inroads into Karabakh villages;\" Jafar Quli Agha routed them and captured several thousand heads of cattle.130\n\nLater, after his granddad was murdered, his cavalry twice fought side by side with the chasseurs of Major Lisanevich and defeated the Iranian troops. In particular, the day after the murder, Persian troops appeared two versts away from the Shusha fortress. Major Lisanevich with 150 chasseurs and Jafar Quli Agha's cavalry moved toward the Persians, pushed them back, and returned the people from several Karabakh villages who had followed the Persian unit.131 On 16 June, 1806, Jafar Quli Agha, at the head of a unit of 250 mounted Azeris and 200 Armenian infantrymen, joined the 900-strong unit of Major Lisanevich's chasseurs; together they left Shusha and moved on a forced march to the Nakhchivan border. On 20 June, they caught up with the Persians at Ordubad, defeated them, and pushed them beyond the Arax. In his report to Major General Nebolsin, Major Lisanevich deemed it necessary to write, \"Jafar Quli and his officers showed exceptional bravery.\"132\n\nIn October 1806, Jafar Quli Agha set off for Tiflis where he planned to lodge a complaint against his uncle Mekhti Quli Khan to Count Gudovich.133\n\nCount Gudovuch reached Tiflis in late October 1806; on 11 November, Mekhti Quli Khan turned up there to swear eternal allegiance to His Imperial Majesty in the presence of Count\n\nGudovich.134\n\nWhile still in Georgievsk, Count Gudovich finally received the medal made for Major General Muhammad Hasan Agha, father of Jafar Quli Agha, and instructions to hand the medal to the heirs. In full conformity with the instructions given to Foreign Minister Baron Budberg dated 22 October, 1806, Count Gudovich planned to hand the medal to Jafar Quli Agha as soon as he reached Tiflis, \"on the condition that he will not wear it without permission from His Majesty.\"135\n\nFinally, in the latter half of November 1806, he received Jafar Quli Khan in Tiflis and, after obtaining his firm promise to recognize Mekhti Quli Khan's power, which \"had been given to him by His Majesty together with the title of khan, and obey him as long as Mekhti Quli Khan himself remains in due obedience to His Imperial Majesty,\"136 Count Gudovich prob-\n\n127 GIAAR, rec. gr. 10, inv. 1, f. 77 (List of beks, meliks, agalars and officials of Shusha in 1860), sheet 1.\n\n128 RGIA, rec. gr. 1268, inv. 2, f. 731b, sheets 107rev.-108.\n\n129 See: AKAK, Vol. III, p. 332, Doc.

I remain well-disposed toward you. Signed 'Alexander'.\"138\n\nIn November 1811 (Zil-Kaade 1226 Hegira), Crown Prince of Persia Abbas Mirza signed a document to the name of Jafar Quli Agha, in which he promised \"signs of his attention and benevolence,\" including the promise to confer on him the title of hakim.139\n\nThe Iranian courier who carried the document was captured; after familiarizing himself with the document, Lieutenant General Marquise Philip Osipovich Paulucci, who served Commander-in-Chief in Georgia from September 1811 to March 1812, suspected Colonel Jafar Quli Agha of contacts with Iranians and ordered that he should be arrested and sent to Tiflis.\n\nWhen crossing the River Terter on the way to Tiflis, Jafar Quli Agha snatched the horse reins from the hands of one of the guards, pushed the other who sat behind him into the river, and fled to his estate and the Jebraillu tribe.140\n\nMarquise Paulucci ordered for Heyr Nisa Begum, mother of the fugitive colonel, to be brought to Tiflis where he offered her a choice: \"either permanent exile\" in Russia or a fine of 150 thousand silver rubles—the sum Jafar Quli Agha had allegedly received from Persians. She preferred the second option and pledged to transfer her jewelry to the treasury, including that which had belonged to Agha Muhammad Shah Qajar murdered in Shusha.141\n\nIn his letter to Marquise Paulucci, Jafar Quli Agha insisted that the \"Persians acted in their own interests\" when sending him the document to deprive him of benevolence of the Commander-in-Chief; that he had never written to Prince Abbas, never sent messengers to him, never gotten the accursed document, had not known anything about it, and, most important, had never acted as traitor.142\n\nAfter learning that Jafar Quli Agha had fled, Prince Abbas Mirza and his troops crossed the Arax and moved to Sultan-Bud defended by a battalion of the Troitsky Regiment and a small unit of Mekhti Quli Khan's cavalry. Later Mekhti Quli Khan wrote to Marquise Paulucci to push responsibility for Prince Abbas Mirza's march onto \"ill-intentioned scoundrel Jafar Quli Agha\" and his intrigues.143\n\nOn 1 February, 1812, the battalion of the Troitsky Regiment was completely routed; many were killed, and those who survived were taken prisoner. Mekhti Quli Khan accompanied by several of his nukers fled for their lives. Prince Abbas Mirza ordered Jafar Quli Agha to move\n\n137 RGIA, rec. gr. 1268, inv. 2, f. 731b, sheets 107rev.-108.\n\n138 AKAK, Vol. III, p. 342, Doc.

While in Persia, wrote the general, Jafar Quli Agha had never agreed to take part in the inroads on Karabakh, even though \"his knowledge of the roads, his popularity among the greater part of the local people, and his personal presence could have helped the Persians to succeed and completely ravage the khanate.\" His mother, Heyr Nisa Begum, kept under military guard in Tiflis, in turn asked for permission for her son to return to Karabakh. Finally, when the Gulistan Peace Treaty was signed on 12 October, 1813 and ratified in May 1814 by Emperor Alexander I, General Rtishchev could send his representative to Persia to present the treaty to Fatali Shah and to obtain permission from the Persians for Jafar Quli Agha to return. Late in 1814, Jafar Quli Agha, after obtaining permission to return to Karabakh together with 300 families of his subjects, immediately went to Tiflis where he renewed his oath of allegiance to Emperor Alexander I in the presence of General Rtishchev.145\n\nIn February 1815, he was permitted to come back to Karabakh, his landed property and the salary of a colonel of the Russian army restored to him; he also acquired \"complete protection against encroachments of Mekhti Quli Khan; his subjects were removed from the power of Mekhti Quli Khan to take command only from their landlord. None of the owners and landlords of Karabakh had similar rights.\"146\n\nThe most important decision was made on 17 March, 1815 when General Rtishchev, on the strength of the Manifesto of 30 August, 1814, confirmed, in writing the right of Jafar Quli Agha to the title of the heir of the Karabakh Khanate and \"all advantages and honors\" he had had before his flight to Persia.147\n\nThese privileges were short-lived. In his report to Emperor Alexander I, newly appointed Commander-in-Chief in Georgia (1816-1827) Lieutenant General Alexey Yermolov asked him not to confirm Colonel Jafar Quli Agha's title of the heir of the Karabakh Khanate because he, General Yermolov, would find enough \"plausible reasons to keep him away from the throne.\"148 Moreover, the general piled the guilt for the defeat of the battalion of the Troitsky Regiment in February 1812 on Jafar Quli Agha.149\n\nThe general, however, never hesitated when appointing Colonel Jafar Quli Agha commander of the Karabakh cavalry, which took part in the 1819 military expedition of the Russian army in southern Daghestan.\n\nJafar Quli Agha's outstanding service under the command of Major General Madatov, Chief of the Military Districts of the Sheki, Shirvan and Karabakh khanates, was rewarded with a Gold Saber incrusted with diamonds.\n\nGeneral Madatov's regiment included two infantry battalions of the Sevastopol and Troitsky regiments (1,500 people in all), three hundred Cossacks of the line, and eight pieces of artillery. \"Fully aware that these forces were inadequate for the coming battles in Daghestan,\n\n144 See: A.-K.

No. 1264.\n\nTHE CAUCASUS & GLOBALIZATION\n\nMadatov decided to use its influence in the Muslim provinces entrusted to his administration to convince the khans to strengthen his expedition with mounted units of hunters chasseurs formed in each of the khanates. Vey soon several hundreds of excellent Asian cavalrymen arrived from Karabakh, Shirvan, and Sheki.\"150 In his Zapiski (Diaries), General Yermolov wrote that \"this cavalry could considerably strengthen the expedition; it was no less useful as a guarantee of the khans' good behavior.\"151\n\nIn August 1819, General Madatov and his expeditionary corps subjugated Tabasaran, and in September-October 1819, Karakaytag.152 In November, General Madatov was ordered to go on a forced march to the borders of the Akusha community; the main forces of the Russian army (nine infantry battalions and artillery) under General Yermolov himself were moving in the same direction.153 On 19 December, 1819, they took the village of Lavashi by force, and on 21 December, they seized the Akusha community.154 On 27 December, 1819, the \"Tatar\" cavalry gathered in Azeri khanates was disbanded.155\n\nOn 20 February, 1820, in his residence in Tsarskoe Selo, Emperor Alexander I signed a decree to the Chapter of Russian Orders: \"To reward the outstanding bravery demonstrated in battles with the Lezghians and in defeating Akusha on 19 December, 1819, I Most Graciously award the Order of Great Martyr St. George the Victorious Fourth Class to Colonel Aslan Khan of the Kyura Khanate; Order of St. Prince Vladimir Equal to the Apostles Fourth Class with Great Ribbon to Major Hasan Agha of the same khanate; Gold Saber encrusted with precious stones and an inscription \"For Bravery\" to Colonel Jafar Quli Agha of the Karabakh Khanate. We order the Chapter of the Russian Orders on the strength of our decree to the Ruling Senate of 24 April, 1816 to supply them with documents and orders; the gold saber should be taken from Our Cabinet.\"156\n\nNewspapers wrote that Colonel Jafar Quli Agha had been awarded a Gold Saber incrusted with diamonds.157\n\nColonel Jafar Quli Agha was the first Azeri and the second Muslim to receive this military \"general\" award.158 Only two more Muslim officers (both Azeri) were awarded the Gold Saber incrusted with diamonds: Major General Kelbali Khan of Nakhchivan on 8 December, 1878 and Lieutenant General Samed-bek Mekhmandarov on 14 February, 1914.159\n\nEarly in the 1820s, not without the efforts of General Madatov, the enmity between Jafar Quli Agha and his uncle Mekhti Quli Khan flared up. Contrary to what was said in the official correspondence, in particular in Administrator of Civilian Affairs in Georgia General Velyami-nov's letter of 12 July, 1821 to Jafar Quli Agha, namely that all members of the Caucasian administration \"were aggrieved\" by the renewed disagreements between him and his uncle, which \"many times in the past had caused the government to worry about the prospect of the unpleas-\n\n150 V.

His house was encircled with infantrymen; I went in and saw Jafar Quli Agha of Karabakh sitting on the bed and taking leave of his children and mother.\n\n\"Jafar Quli Agha, with the right to the khanate, was loved by the people of Karabakh and was an enemy of the khan. When the khan fled, he, expecting to replace him as the khan of Karabakh, wounded himself in the arm . to spread rumors that before leaving the khan had tried to kill him but merely wounded him. I think that it was Madatov who advised him in order to acquire a plausible reason to send him to Russia and appropriate the khanate. I cannot understand how he was persuaded to keep silence about Madatov's advice; he was probably afraid because he kept telling me that he had been wounded by the khan's servants when the khan fled.\n\n\"Jafar Quli Agha is a young man, very fit, sharp, and fairly educated. He was captured in Reut's apartment, to which he had been lured under a false pretext. He was given two hours to pack and say farewell to his relatives.\n\n\"He looked extremely bewildered. There was also his son Kerim aged 15 who studied in Tiflis and was leaving with him. People who loved him were gathering in the squares and streets to talk about his fate.\n\n\"I left Shusha the same day and spent the night at the Pojalinsky outpost where I met Councilor of State Mogilevsky and P.N. Yermolov on their way to Shusha to compile an inventory of the khanate, count the income, and introduce our administration. Jafar Quli Agha arrived the same night with his son Kerim accompanied by mounted Cossacks and infantrymen.\n\n\"I spent the second night in Terter; Jafar Quli Agha and his Cossack guard also spent the night there. I went with him to Tiflis; in the evenings we played chess. He was very worried about his future and kept asking me where he was being taken and whether he would be allowed to go to St. Petersburg to enter military service and preserve his rank of a colonel. I knew nothing about this and could not answer his questions; I tried to console him as best as I could; the evenings we spent together at the stations were fairly pleasant.\n\n\"On the third day I arrived in Elisavetpol, where I spent two days. On 31st (December 1822.—Ed) I left the city and in Shamkhor met Jafar Quli Agha accompanied by Cossack Lieutenant Colonel Dolotin, who traveling with him as far as Demurgasov where he was replaced by interpreter Major Nazarov who took Jafar Quli Agha to Russia and, after bringing him to Simbirsk, returned him the saber awarded by the Czar.\"163\n\n160 AKAK, Vol. VI, Part I, p. 843, Doc.

The house with the orchard was given to the colonel's younger brother Shukyur Agha; 20 fillies and 3 stallions were moved to the state stud farm; the rest was transferred to Jafar Quli Agha's second brother Khanjan Agha, who pledged to pay all of the elder brother's debts.165\n\nOn top of this Jafar Quli Agha was entitled to the farmed-off dyeing tax; he received 24,620 panabadi a year from the leaseholders (which amounted to 3,693 silver rubles—1 panabadi was equal to 15 to 16 kopeks). Under this item, the leaseholders drew money from the sales of dyed silk and cotton. In 1823, this practice was discontinued; the tax was removed to the treasury, which farmed it off to private businessmen.166\n\nColonel Jafar Quli Agha seized the opportunity presented by Emperor Alexander I's short stay in Simbirsk to lodge a request to return him his Karabakh estate, allow him to reside in St. Petersburg, and let his son join the army. On 28 August, 1825, by \"an imperial order,\" Colonel Jafar Quli Agha was allowed to live in St. Petersburg; his annual pension was increased by 12,000 rubles in paper money.167\n\nIn this way, his annual budget in St. Petersburg was 24,000 ruble in paper money (that is, 6,000 silver rubles); in 1823, when the tax farmed-off to him was returned to the treasury, the annual pension for his mother and younger brothers was increased by 700 silver rubles over the pension of 1,118.02 rubles for Heyr Nisa Begum, 500 silver rubles for Khanjan Agha, and 400 silver rubles for Shukyur Agha. In 1824, Jafar Quli Agha's landed possessions and tax brought in 9,385.45 silver rubles.168\n\nIn 1826 and 1827, Colonel Jafar Quli Agha lodged several requests to Emperor Nicholas I asking for the return of his landed possessions and permission to return to Karabakh. The imperial order issued on 6 August, 1829 said that \"Jafar Quli Agha, a smart man who has adjusted to life in Russia and became member of St. Petersburg English Club,\" could go back to his homeland. He returned in 1830 and settled in the city of Shusha. His property and his estate (with the exception of the farmed-off tax) were returned to him, \"as well as the income produced by his possessions during the time he resided in Russia.\"169\n\nHis salary, suspended during his exile in Simbirsk, was not restored; on 1 January, 1846, he started drawing 2,500 silver rubles a year from the Shusha District revenue office in replacement of the money produced by the farmed-off tax.170\n\nVasily Potto, Russian military historian (1836-1911), briefly mentioned Jafar Quli Agha in the chapter dealing with Mekhti Quli Khan's return to Karabakh: \"It should be said here that somewhat later Jafar Quli Agha, nephew of Mekhti Quli Khan, also returned to Karabakh. He played a great historical role in the fate of his motherland. Exiled to Simbirsk by General Yermolov, he managed to obtain permission to move to St. Petersburg during the reign of Alexan-\n\n1 See: Kolonialnaiapolitika rossiyskogo tsarizma v Azerbaidzhane v 20-60-kh gg.

As soon as Yermolov left the Caucasus, Jafar Quli Agha asked for permission to return and join the army. The czar deemed it necessary to consult Paskevich. Count Nesselrode wrote to Paskev-ich: \"The petitioner is brave and gallant because he was promoted to the rank of a colonel and awarded with a gold saber incrusted with diamonds; yet before that he had been as gallant and as brave fighting us on the Persian side.\" Paskevich found it embarrassing to have two blood enemies—the nephew and the uncle—in one and the same place, which could have caused discontent in the province. He no longer trusted either of them. Jafar Quli Agha lost his chance to fight in the Persian war. He came back in 1830 and, like his uncle, lived his last years in Karabakh as a private person.\"171\n\nIn 1831, when irregular mounted Muslim regiments conscripted in Azerbaijan were used, after a long interval, in military expeditions of the Russian army to Daghestan and Chechnia, it was planned to appoint Colonel Jafar Quli Agha commander of the First Mounted Muslim Regiment staffed with people from the former Karabakh Khanate.172 This probably never happened. Anyway there is not enough information to confirm his involvement in the military campaigns of Russian army of the early 1830s in Daghestan and Chechnia.\n\nLater, by an imperial decree of 18 October, 1848, \"Colonel Jafar Quli Agha, who lives in the Shusha District of the Shemakha Gubernia,\" was awarded the Order of St. Anne Second Class \"for special efforts he demonstrated, according to Vicegerent of the Caucasus, when capturing highwaymen.\"173\n\nOn 6 December, 1850, by an imperial order, Colonel Jafar Quli Agha of the Separate Caucasian Corps was promoted to Major General \"for distinguished service.\"174\n\nThe printed lists of generals by seniority mentioned Major General Jafar Quli Agha (his family name was never mentioned in these lists and imperial orders) as belonging to the Separate Caucasian Corps for political reasons.175\n\nBy an imperial decree of 17 February, 1859, Major General Jafar Quli Agha of the Caucasian Army (the Separate Caucasian Corps had been transformed into the Caucasian Army in December 1857) was awarded the Order of St. Vladimir Third Class (with a special sign for non-Christians) \"for his excellent and diligent service confirmed by his superiors.\"176\n\nOn a request from the Chief Commander of the Caucasian Army, Major General Jafar Quli Agha of the Cavalry was awarded the Order of St. Stanislav First Class (18.05.1861) \"for his excellent and diligent service.\"177\n\nAccording to information for the 1850s-1860s, Major General Jafar Quli Agha did not serve and lived in the city of Shusha.178\n\nAccording to Kavkazskiy kalendar (Caucasian Calendar), in 1852-1853 Major General Jafar Quli Agha was Honorary Supervisor of the Shemakha District School179; he also belonged to the Caucasian Agricultural Society from its first year (1850) until his death in 1866.180 The\n\n171 V.

He met Jafar Quli Agha when he was over 80 and described him as a tall and well-built man obviously very strong in his youth. Jafar Quli Agha liked poetry and wrote under the penname Arif. Mir-Mohsun Navvab quoted some of his poems in his book. Jafar Quli Agha played several musical instruments and was a keen connoisseur of the Azeri classic Mugham. He gathered musical and literary mejlises at home and loved competitions between local and visiting wrestlers, performances of conjurers and jesters, camel and goat races, and dog and cock fights.186\n\nPrussian official Baron August von Haxthausen (1792-1866) traveled in the Caucasus in August-October 1843; in 1849 he wrote and in 1857 published a work called Studien uber die innern Zustande, das Volksleben und insbesondere die landlichen Einrichtungen Russ-lands (shortened English translation The Russian Empire: Its People, Institutions and Resources). He relied not only on his notes made during the journey, but also on stories and reminiscences of Russian officials he heard in 1849 and later. He described Jafar Quli Agha's house and personal life.\n\n\"My companion Herr Aderkas presented to him (Jafar Quli Agha.—E.I.) in Shusha was invited for a cup of tea. He saw a very strange mixture of eastern and European customs and life style. His house looked very much like the houses of other rich Tatars (Azeris.—E.I.) in Shusha.

He is a handsome, tall, and well-built man with a noble and very attractive face, proud bearing, and still very strong. They all sat at the table; then came his oriental relatives and guests who sat cross-legged oriental fashion on the sofa, smoked pipes, drank tea, and spoke when addressed. Mirza Chamil was among them, the former minister of Ibrahim, who advised him to seek support of the Russians (Mirza Jamal Jevanshir, the last vizier of the Karabakh Khanate and author of Karabakh-name, he died in 1853. Since Jafar Quli Agha was promoted to Major General in December 1850, the meeting took place between 1850 and 1853.—E.I.). Servants in European liveries served tea, cakes, jams, punch, sherbet, and ice cream; other servants were dressed in Tatar and Circassian clothes. An expensive Vienna clock played an overture from the opera La muette de Portici! Jaffar kept a big harem, had numerous children, whom the guests, however, did not notice.\"187\n\nIn 1891, the Russkiy arkhiv journal published the memoirs of Andrey Fadeev (1789-1867), who served for a long time as a member of the Council of the Main Administration and administrator of the expedition of state property of Transcaucasia. In the summer of 1848, he went to Shusha where, accompanied by the head of the Shusha district, he \"paid visits to the respected leaders of local aristocracy: the rich widow of Mekhti Quli Khan, Colonel Jafar Quli Khan, and elderly dowager Javahir Khanum.\" The Russian official described the widow as \"a fairly educated woman, or even a woman of the world Oriental style; she was very hospitable with the guests and even presented them with an excellent carpet, which she had made herself.\" Her daughter Khurshid Banu Begum, \"a pretty woman called the Rose of Karabakh because of her beauty,\" lived with her. Andrey Fadeev had the following to say about Colonel Jafar Quli Agha: \"He lived in Shusha in European style with a strong Tatar accent.\" He invited Fadeev to dinner, \"which turned out to be a great feast with Asian entertainments, dances, music, and singing and, naturally, champagne; in the evening there were card games which lasted well into the night...\" The author described Georgian Princess dowager Javahir Khanum, widow of Ibrahim Khalil Khan, as \"a very important Tatar lady of advanced years\" who \"carefully preserved her khan dignity.\"188\n\nIn his history of the Caucasian war, Vasily Potto wrote: \"One of the travelers who saw Jafar in 1857 says that he was a venerable old man who still amazed with his attractive typically (Caucasian) face with a full beard and a huge figure bent under the weight of years, yet still showing its former vitality and force. His composure, proud bearing, and tallness distinguished him from the crowd of honorable beks, also tall and prominent people, who looked very different from the common Tatars. In the East, tallness and a proud bearing are the signs of good blood and aristocratic origins. This was one of the strongest human characters that never bends under the weight of circumstances and hardly succumbs to the years.\"189\n\nIn 1864, Vasily Vereshchagin (1842-1904), Russian war artist and writer, visited the Caucasus for the first time. He published his travel notes in 1870 in the Vsemirny puteshestvennik journal, in which he described his meeting with Jafar Quli Agha, two years before his death.\n\n\".In Shusha I saw a Jebrail horse (from a small settlement close to Shusha). The best horses I saw in Shusha belonged to the stud farm of the same Jafar Quli Khan. There were few of them, but all were excellent. Jafar bought them from other beks. I did not know whether he was an expert on horses or merely lucky, but, let me repeat, I had never seen anything similar.\n\n187 Zakavkazskiy kray.

Jafar Quli Agha Khan told me that in the past he had been the first among the horse breeders in the quantity and quality of his horses and that he had lost half of the stud farm and half of the income because he was frequently away, sometimes for a long time.\n\n\"Jafar Quli Khan is a respectable man and no fool. He lived a lot in society; he saw a lot and heard a lot, which made him an interesting interlocutor. I met him at one of the evening spectacles he gave at home in the yard. .In the first nine days of moharem, rich and faithful Muslims usually organize performances reproducing the last sufferings of the imam.

He started talking to me in pure Russian, apologized for not getting up, and kindly repeated his invitation to the evening performance. It was a copy of those I had seen before, therefore I wasn't interested. I was much more interested in the master of the house.\n\n\"He was an old man with an intelligent and expressive face; his long red beard reached his chest. Bedridden for a long time, he was a shadow of the brave Jafar of the past. He had been one of the contenders to the Karabakh throne, but his bravery, courage, and determination had made him too dangerous—he spent many years in exile. A handsome, young, and rich man, he had been very popular in fashionable Petersburg society where he lived a dissipated life. Today, he probably tries to atone for his past sins with good deeds.\n\n\"One of the rooms is decorated in the Western style; there is an old piano there; sometimes he is brought up to it (he cannot walk without support) and plays old melodies with his shaking fingers. I tried to talk to him about his life, which had been full of adventures, but he did not like to recollect the past. He liked my sketches and portraits of people we both knew, but his enthusiasm reached the highest point when he saw my sketches of horses.

In 1861, Khurshid Banu Begum inherited 9 villages of 185 households from her mother.206\n\nKhurshid Banu Begum received her primary education at home where she studied Farsi and Persian literature; later she lived for a while in Tiflis,207 where she probably met Russian officer, Kumyk, Prince Khasay Musaevich Utsmiev (22 March, 1808-21 April, 1867). In his genealogy of the khans of Ganja, Haji Hamid Efendi wrongly dated their marriage as 1853.208 They were probably married in 1847, since the name of Lieutenant Colonel Khasay Utsmiev appeared in the 1848 list of members of the Shusha privileged social group.209\n\nThe marriage between the heiress to the vast possessions of the last khan of Karabakh and a Russian officer, member of an influential Kumyk family, probably played into the hands of the Caucasian Administration and was approved by Vicegerent of the Caucasus Adjutant General Prince Vorontsov. Khurshid Banu Begum and Major General (promoted in 1862) Prince Utsmiev had two children: son Prince Mekhti Quli Khan Utsmiev (1855, Shusha-1900, Tiflis) and daughter Princess Khan Bike Utsmieva (1856 Shusha-1921, Agdam).210\n\nAfter the death of her first husband, Khurshid Banu Begum married a commoner Seiid Hussein; by that time she had become a famous poetess, well known in Karabakh and also in Azerbaijan. This is confirmed by the caustic responses of poets of Shirvan, Baku, Quba, Karabakh, and Sheki to poet Abdullah-bek Asi, who dared to reproach her for her marriage to a commoner.211\n\nIt was in 1868 that information about Khurshid Banu Begum appeared in academic publications212 in the book Dichtungen transkaukasischer Sanger des XVIII. und XIX. Jahrhunderts in adserbeidshanischer Mundart, gesammelt von Adolph Berge, which contains none of her poems; there is, however, a poem by Kasum-bek Zakir (pp. 99-100) entitled in Farsi \"Dar sana-ye doxtar-e Mehdiqulu xan Xur§id banu bagim qofte ast,\" which means \"Written as a Sign of Gratitude to Khurshid Banu Begum, Daughter of Mekhti Quli Khan.\"213\n\nShe wrote numerous lyric songs (ghazels) performed with great skill and widely known in her lifetime in manuscripts. Her poems were repeatedly published in her native language; the first Russian edition appeared in 1937. The first collection of her poems translated into Russian by A. Plavnik was published in Baku in 1982.214\n\nIn 1872, she gathered the poets of Karabakh into a literary society called Myajlisi uns (Gathering of Friends) in Shusha. She was very active in public life and charities. In 1873, she paid for the first water-supply system in Shusha known as Khan gyzy bulagy (The Spring of Khan's Daughter).215\n\nHer second husband and their children—three sons and two daughters: Mir Abbas Agha (1868-1885), Mir Hasan Agha (1870-1903), Mir Jafar Agha (?-1914?) and Sara Begum and Khajar Bike (1869-?)— since the late 1870s-early 1880s used the family name Agamirovs. Her husband Seiid Hussein (c. 1833-?"
