        "text": "Abu-Iskhak-Ibrahim-ibn-Muhammad al-Farisiy al-Istakhriy , about whose life we know almost nothing, left behind a work under the title: \" Kitabu mesalik-il-memalik (book of the paths of kingdoms).\" This work is a publication of the works of his predecessor Abu-Zeid-Ahmed-ibn-Sahl al-Balkhiya, supplemented by al-Istakhariy himself.\n\nAl-Balkhiy , a native of the city of Balkh, studied philosophy in Iraq under the guidance of al-Kindiya and was the secretary of the Balkh prince Ahmed-ibn-Sahl-ibn-Hashim al-Merveziya. Al-Balkhi compiled an atlas of geographical maps: \" Suvar-il-akalim (image of the belts of the earth)\" with brief explanations, which were later widely disseminated by al-Istakhriy. The first edition of this atlas was published in 307 or 308 AH, and the second between 318 and 319 AH. Al-Balkhi died in 322 AH (934 A.D.).\n\nThe text of al-Istakhriyya constitutes the first volume of the Bibliotheca geographorum arabicorum. Lugd. Batav. 1870 ”, editions de Goeje.\n\nFrom the book of the paths of the kingdoms\n\nAbu-Ishaq Ibrahim-ibn-Muhammad al-Farisiyya al-Istakhriy, known as al-Kerkhiya.\n\nIn our description, we have already reached the extreme limits of Islam from the eastern side and are returning again to the limits of Rum to the west. So, we will give a description of this belt to the extreme limits of Islam in the east; We will start with the countries of Armenia, Arran and Aderbeydzhan, considering them as one about one of them.\n\nArmenia, Arran and Aderbeydzhan.\n\nWe connect Armenia, Arran and Aderbeydzhan on one map; and consider it as one area. They are bordered by, adjoining from the east, Djibal, Deilem and the western coast of the Khazar Sea; from the west, the limits of Armand. Allanov and partly the borders of Jazira, from the north of Allana and Mount Kabk, from the south they border with Iraq and partly the borders of Jazira.\n\nThe largest city in Aderbeydzhan Ardabil; it houses the army camp and the ruler's palace. This city occupies two-thirds of a farsakh in length and as much in width, and around it is a wall, and there are three gates in it, most of its buildings are made of clay; this city is flourishing and the prices are cheap. About two farces from Ardabil there is a huge and high mountain called Sabalan. There is snow on it and winter and summer, and it is uninhabited.\n\nArdabil is followed by Meraga in size; in former times there was a camp of troops and a palace of the ruler. Meraga is a very healthy area, flourishing, abundant in gardens, volosts and crops: around it is a wall that Ibn-abi-s-Sajj destroyed.\n\nUrmia is next in size after Meraga; it is a healthy city, abundant in food, and prices are cheap. It lies at the \"ash-Shurat\" lake.\n\nMeianij, Khunaj, Ujan, Daharrakan, Khuvey, Salamas, Merand, Tibriz, Berzend, Varsan, Mukan, Jabravan and Ushnukh cities are insignificant and similar in size.\n\nAs for Jabravan Tibriz and Ushnuh-al-Azariya, these three cities and the area covered by or are called Rudainia.\n\nAs for Berd'a, it is a large city, more farsakh in length and width, healthy, blooming and very abundant in crops and fruits. In Iraq and Khorasan, after Rhey and Ispagani, there is no city more significant, more flourishing and more beautiful in terms of location and lands than Berd'a. From it, in less than one farcah, there is a place called Andarab, occupying more than a day's journey in length and breadth. This place is filled with gardens and vegetable gardens. All kinds of fruits grow in it, and by the way, an excellent Volotsk nut, better than the Samarkand nut. Among the fruits, Shahiballut is better than Shahiballut of Syria. There also grows a fruit called \"zukal\", approximately the size of \"gubeira\". It has a seed in it and is sweet when ripe and bitter when ripe.\n\nAs for shahiballut, it is half the size of a black walnut, and its taste is close to the taste of a Volotsk nut and a ripe date.\n\nFigs in Berda'a are brought from Lasub, and they are considered the best of this kind of fruit. A lot of silk is exported from Berd'a. Silk worms are fed on mulberry trees that do not belong to anyone. A lot of silk goes from there to Persia (Iraq) and Khuzistan.\n\nIn one third of Berd'a there is the Kura river, and in the Kura river there is “surmakhi” fish delivered in salted form to different countries. From the Kura, fish are also caught, called: \"zerakan\" and \"ishubet\". Both fish are preferred to other types of fish in these countries.\n\nNear the gate of Berd'a, called the \" Gate of the Kurds \", there is a market named \"al-Kyurkiy\", the size of farces in a square. People gather for it every Sunday, and people from all kinds of countries, even from Iraq, flock here. This market is more significant than the Kulsere market. The name of the market: \"al-Kyurkiy\" took precedence over the name of the day due to the constant opening of the market on that day, so often residents, counting the days of the week, say: \"Saturday, Kurkiy, Monday, Tuesday\" until they count the whole week.\n\nTheir treasury is in the cathedral mosque according to the Syrian custom, and the Syrian treasury is always in mosques. This treasury has a flat roof covered with lead with an iron door, on nine columns. The ruler's palace is next to the cathedral mosque in the city, and the markets are on the outskirts of the city.\n\nThe city of Bab-ul-Abwab holds by the sea, and in the center is a roadstead for ships. Between the roads and the sea, two walls are built parallel to the coast; the passage for ships is narrow, and the entrance is made winding, and a chain is stretched at the mouth of the port, so that the ship can neither go out nor enter except with permission. These two walls are made of stones and lead.\n\nBab-ul-Abwab lies on the Tabaristan Sea. This city is larger than Ardabil (Yakut adds: \"about two miles in length and width\"), and there are many crops, but a small amount of fruits, not counting what is brought here from neighboring countries. Around this city there is a wall of stone, burnt bricks and clay, and this city serves as a port on the Khazar Sea for Serir and other countries of the \"kafirs\"; it also serves as a port for Djurdjan, Tabaristan and Deilem. Linen clothes are exported from Bab-ul-Abwab, and linen clothes are not made in Arran, Armenia and Aderbeydzhan, except in these places. Saffron also grows there. In Bab-ul-Abwab there are slaves from different countries of the \"kafirs\". (Yakut is a famous Arab geographer. Born in 1179 in Byzantium. As a boy he was taken prisoner by the Muslims. Since 1213 he traveled a lot and compiled a voluminous geographical dictionary: \"Kitab-mu'jam-al-Buldan (Alphabetical register of countries)\", published in 1866 - 1870 by Wüstenfeld in Leipzig in 6 volumes. He died in Aleppo in 1224 AD 50 years old) Text of Yakut: “Around the city, a stone wall extending from the mountain to the sea, long but not wide. Through the mountain, this city has no way to the cities of Muslims due to the deterioration of the road and the difficulty of traveling from the lands of the \"kafirs\" to the lands of Muslims. With the length of the wall, a part of it still protrudes into the sea like a long bow, and thus the city from the side of the wall is protected from the approach of ships. This wall is of a solid construction on a huge foundation; it was built by Anushirvan .\n\nBab-ul-Abwab is one of the famous and significant border areas \"and this city is great and glorious\", because in a very huge number it is surrounded by enemies of various nationalities and languages in large numbers.\n\nThere is a high mountain named \"Dzy'b\" near the city. At the top of this mountain, a large amount of firewood is collected every year and fires are lit on it if necessary, and thus the inhabitants of Aderbeijan, Arran and Armenia are warned of a sudden attack by enemies.\n\nThe waters of the sea sometimes damage the wall of this city.\n\nIt is said that more than seventy different tribes live on the tops of the mountains that stretch adjacent to Bab-ul-Abwab, and each tribe has a different language, so they do not understand each other. The Khosroi took great care of this border area and did not slacken their observation of its position due to the great danger from this side and the strong fear of it.\n\nIn this place, guards were settled from immigrants from different regions and reliable in their opinion (khosroev) for protection, and the entire inhabited area, which they would take possession, was provided for their exclusive use without any expenses for the government, without hassle about this region and without interference in his affairs; all this was done out of a strong desire to populate this land with reliable people and thereby protect the Turks and \"kafirs\" from various hostile tribes. Among those settled here to guard the borders was the Tabarseran tribe, and in the vicinity of the latter, the tribes known under the names Filan and Lakz ; the latter are especially numerous and courageous. In addition, there are the tribes of Lyran, Sharvan and others. Each tribe was assigned a place of residence, which they had to protect. They are numerous and strong, and have both cavalry and infantry.\n\nBab-ul-Abwab is a port on this sea. Khazars, Serirs, Shenzans, Khaizans, Kurdzhi, Ruklana, Zerikerany and Gumik from the north flock to him, and people from Djurzhan, Tabaristan, Deilem and Jil also come there.\n\nResidents of Bab-ul-Abwab are engaged in the dressing of linen clothes, and in the regions of Arran, Armenia and Aderbeijan, linen is prepared only in Bab-ul-Abvab and its volosts; saffron in the same place. Slaves from various tribes are found in Bab-ul-Abwab.\n\nIn the neighborhood of Bab-ul-Abwab to the borders of the Islamic states on the seashore there is a volost named Muscat, and next to it is the land of Lakzov. These latter are a significant, courageous and tall tribe; they have plantations and a permanently inhabited area. Their privileged class is called Hamashira, and they are ruled by kings; and below them \"Mishak\", then \"Al-Akra\" and \"Megan\" follows. Between them and between Bab-ul-Abwab, the country of Tabarseran; its inhabitants are as courageous and brave as Lakzy, and their country is as densely populated as those of those; except that the Lakzes outnumber the Tabarserans, and their holdings are much larger. And above is Philan; this is a minor area.\n\nBehind Maskag, along the coast of this sea, is the city of Shabiran, insignificant, but fortified and rich in volosts. This is followed by the Jashemdan volost, and then the Jabal and Sharvan farms to the borders of Baku, Dernik, Lakzov and Mejma-al-Nahrain. Further behind this is Lyran, and in this country there is a large fortified castle. They say that in this castle there is a murmur of keys, and it itself is inaccessible \"\n\nTiflis is a city smaller than Bab-ul-Abvab in size; around it are two walls of clay, and in them there are three gates. This city is very flourishing and rich in fruits and crops. It is a border town. There are baths in it, in the genus Tabariysk, and the water in them is hot without the help of fire.\n\nIn Arran, there are no cities more significant than Berda'a, Bab-ul-Abwab and Tiflis. Baylakan, Varsan, Birdij - cities are insignificant and similar in size, but flourishing and rich in land.\n\nDabil is greater than Ardabil; this city serves as the capital of Armenia and in it the ruler's palace is similar to the palace of the ruler of Arran in Berd'a and the palace of the ruler of Aderbeydzhan in Ardabil. There is a wall around Dabil; there are many Christians, and the city's cathedral mosque is next to the church. In this city, woolen dresses and carpets, pillows, seats, cords and other items of Armenian production are made. They also produce paint, called \"kirmiz\", and paint the cloth with it. I learned that this is a worm that spins around itself like a silk worm, and, in addition, I learned that many silk fabrics are made there.\n\nDabil is the capital of Armenia and in it is Sanbat, the son of Ashug. The city was constantly in the hands of noble Christians, and Christians make up the majority of the inhabitants of Armenia, it is also the \"kingdom of Arman\". Armenia borders on Rum and its borders up to Berd'a, to Jazira and to Aderbeijon. The border area adjacent to Rum from the Armenian side is Kalikala. Inhabitants of Aderbeydzhan, Djibal, Ray and neighboring countries make raids on Armenia. They have a place from where they enter Rum, known under the name \"Tara-bezunda\". Merchants flock there, and then go to trade in the countries of Rum. Thus, everything that comes from brocade, silk and Romanian clothes in these countries is from Tarabezunde.\n\nNashava, Berkeri, Khilat, Manazkird, Badlis, Kalikala, Arzan, Mayafarikin and Siraj - these cities are insignificant, similar in size, but flourishing, and their entire population is rich.\n\nThe Mayafarikin is considered to belong to the Jazira , if you do not take into account that it lies on the other side of the Tigris, and the Tiger serves as the border of the Jazira, which we mentioned when depicting the terrain between the Tigris and the Euphrates . Therefore, we have added Mayafarikin to Armenia.\n\nAs for the navigable rivers, such are the Kura and Rass (ar-Rass) rivers, and the Sabidrud, located between Ardabil and Zanjan, is not so significant that ships sail along it.\n\nIn the Kura River, the water is fresh, healthy and light; The Kura flows out of the mountains in the country of Janza and Shamkur near Tiflis and flows into the lands of the \"kafirs\" slowly flows from the country of Allans from the mountains between .... then flows through the city of Tiflis, then through Hunan, a castle known as \"Kal'- t-Turab \"; this is a huge hill with a castle on it; then it flows to Shakki and from the country of Janza and Shamkur through Bab-Berd'a to Berzenj \").\n\nThe Russa water is fresh and pleasant; it leaves Armenia and flows until it reaches Bab-Varsan; then it reaches the back of the Mukan and the channel of the Kura, and then flows into the sea ( C is like this: “The Rass River is smaller in size than the Kura, it is fresh and its sources are beyond Armenia; Rass flows to Bab-Varsan, and then reaches Mykan and flows further, until it reaches the Sharvan volost, called Darnik, the land of this volost is fertile. Rass unites with Kura and flows into the Tabaristan Sea. The Samur River flows through the Lakzov country, called Samur. Its origins are in the mountains, and it reaches Shakki. Sometimes it increases, and sometimes decreases, but this river is abundant in water and rich in tributaries. None of the other rivers we have mentioned overflows and does not increase so that it is worth mentioning \").\n\nAs for the seas of Armenia, Arran and Aderbeydzhan, in Aderbeydzhan there is a lake called Lake Urmia with salt water; it is home to fish and an animal, called a \"water dog\". The lake is large, and around the whole lake there are populated places, villages and volosts. There are three farsakhs between this lake and Meraga; there are two farsakhs between the lake and the city of Urmia; between Daharrakan and the lake shore there are about four Farsakhs; the length of the lake is about four days of the journey of the riding animal, and with the wind it is sometimes possible to swim it in one night.\n\nAnother lake in Armenia called \"Lake Arjish\". Tirrich fish is caught from it and exported to all countries.\n\nThese countries are washed by the Tabaristan Sea; on this sea lie the cities of Wab-ul-Abwab and Baku, and in Baku there is oil.\n\nAs for the Tiger, only a very small part of it concerns Armenia, and we have already depicted the Tiger on the map of Jazira and Iraq.\n\nMules are removed from the country of Berd'a and delivered to all countries. Also export madder from there, delivered to the countries of India and other places.\n\nThe borders of Arran from Bab-ul-Abvab to Tiflis and to the place known as \"Khadzhiran\" ( Nakhichevan ), near the Rassa river.\n\nThe border of Aderbeydzhan: a mountain range, reaching the extreme limit of Tarma and up to Zanjan: then it touches the extreme limits of Dinav, then stretches after Hulvan and Shagrazur until it approaches the Tigris, and then surrounds the borders of Armenia. In these cities the prices are so cheap that in some places the price of a sheep goes up to two dirgems, and the price of honey in some places goes so far as two or three mana is dirgem (\"one mann for a dirgem\"). Everything is in abundance there, although those who did not witness this, when talking about it, deny the possibility of such an abundance of products.\n\nThere are kings in the provinces, and their dominions represent separate states; their land is vast and their possessions are abundant. They include the king Sharvana, called sharvanshah, and the king of Abkhaz, called Abkhazshah.\n\nMost of Aderbeydzhan, Armenia and Arran are mountainous. Near Dabil there is a high mountain named: \"al-Haris\"; it is not climbed due to its height and the difficulty of climbing; there is eternal snow on it. Behind her is another mountain below called \"al-Khuveyris\". Springs flow from Haris, and only hunters climb it for firewood. They say that in those countries there is no mountain higher than this one.\n\nMann Ardabil 1040 dirgems, in the genus of Shiraz manna, only in Shiraz it is called “man”, and in Ardabil “ritl” .\n\nThe language in Aderbeydzhan, Armenia and Arran is Persian and Arabic, excluding the regions of the city of Dabil: Armenian is spoken around it: in the country of Berd'a, the language is Arran.\n\nIn these countries there are the Kabk mountains, as they are called, and there are many different languages among the infidel peoples and many tribes of \"kafirs\".\n\nThe current coin of Aderbeydzhan, Arran and Armenia is gold, as well as silver.\n\nDistances in these areas .\n\nThe way from Berd'a to Ardabil: from Berd'a to Yunan 7 farsakhs; 7 farsakhs from Yunan to Baylakan; from Baylakan to Varsan 7 farsakhs 7 farsakhs; there are 7 farsakhs from Balkhab to Berzend, and 15 farsakhs from Berzend to Ardabil.\n\nThe way from Berd'a to Bab-ul-Abvab 60, from Berd'a to Berzenj 18 farsakhs; from Berzenj to the ford through the Kura to Shemakhia (Yakut adds: “and there is no mosque in it”) 14 farsakhs; from Shemakhia to Sharvan 3 days' journey; from Sharvan to Abkhaz 2 days; 12 farsakhs from Abkhaz to Jasar-Samur, and 20 farsakhs from Jasar-Samur to Bab-ul-Abvab. “On the Bab-ul-Abvaba mountains, fortresses built by Khosroy; in these fortresses inhabited by people assigned to protect these roads, along which the Khazars walk to the Islamic lands. There are fourteen such fortresses, and people from Mosul, Diyar-Gabia and Syria live in them. They are known under the name of the same tribes, and the language (Arabic) is preserved from genus to genus. There is no boss above them, and they are watching Bab (Gate). There is a border between Lakzy and Shirvan, and an adjacent border between Shirvan and Lyran; Lyran has a border with Mukatey, and with the country of Absia too. There are few cities in this area. There is a fortified castle, and behind it to the mountains is the area neighboring Lakzam. Lakza and guard the castle, as the owner of Absya feels inclined towards them and diligently protects them. This is followed by the land of Shavka, then Abriya, then Saria, and finally Tiflis \").\n\nThe way from Berd'a to Tiflis: from Verda'a to Janza, city, 9 farsakhs: from Janza to Shamkur 10 farsakhs; from Shamkur to Hanoun, city 21, from Hunan to Kal'a-ibn-Kandaman there are 10 farsakhs, and from Kal'a to Tiflis 12 farsakhs.\n\nThe way from Berd'a to Dabil: from Berd'a to Kal-katus 9 farsakhs; from Calcatus to Metris 13 Farsakhs; 12 farsakhs from Metris to Dawmis; 16 farsakhs from Dawmis to Kil-Kui; from Kil-Kuy to Sisadzhan there are 16 farsakhs, and from Sisadzhan to Dabil 16 farsahs.\n\nThe path from Berd'a to Dabil goes through the lands of the Armenians, and all these cities are in the kingdom of Sanbat, the son of Ashut.\n\nThe path from Ardabil to Zanjan 64: from Ardabil to Kantar-Sabidrud two transitions; from Kantara to Serat one day; from Serat to Nuweya one day's journey and from Nuway to Zanjan one day's journey.\n\nThe way from Ardabil to Merag 58, from Ardabil to Meianij 20 farsakhs; from Meianij to Khunaj, a city, 7 farsakhs; from Khunaj to the Kul-sera volost with a huge market, but without a mosque, 3 farsakhs, and from Kul-sera to Meragi 10 farsakhs.\n\nThe path from Ardabil to Amid 66: from Ardabil to Meragi 40 farsakhs; from Meragi to Daharrakan city with a mosque, two transitions; from him to Urmia, the city, 2 transitions; from Urmia to Salamas 2 transitions; 7 farsakhs from Salamas to Khuwayya; from Khuwayi to Berkeri 30 farsakhs; from Berkeri to Arjish one day; from Arjish to Khilat 3 days; from Khilat to Bedlis one day; from Bedlis to Miyafarikin 3 days, and from Miyafarikin to Amid 2 days.\n\nThe way from Meragi to Dabil 67: from Meragi to Urmia 30 farsahs;"
