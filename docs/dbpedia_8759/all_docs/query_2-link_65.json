        "text": "Azerbaijani Safavid state covered a wide territory. This wide range of land separated by natural boundaries was divided into thirteen states and four provinces. The land between the river Kur and Araz, in the other words a part of old Aran was the former state of Karabakh and its capital was Ganja. It is sometimes mentioned in the sources as state Karabağ or with the name Ganja. Karabakh state had a special place among Safavid administrative units with its military strategic and also geographic position. And Karabakh province was differed from other provinces. As a rule, Turkish aristocrats had an important role in using the power in all the provinces of Safavid State, in the other words beghlerbeghs were assigned among them, but this supremacy was not hereditary. In Karabakh, this rule continued seriously, but unlike other states the land of Qajarland of Ziyadli was ruled\n\nAfter initiation of the glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) policies in the USSR by Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Union started to crumble, and old, forgotten, suppressed problems especially regarding territorial claims between Azerbaijanis and Armenians re-emerged. Although Mountainous (Nagorno) Karabakh is officially part of Azerbaijan Republic, after fierce and bloody clashes between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, the entire Nagorno Karabakh region and seven additional surrounding districts of Lachin, Kelbajar, Agdam, Jabrail, Fizuli, Khubadly and Zengilan, it means over 20 per cent of Azerbaijan, were occupied by Armenians, and because of serious war situations, many Azerbaijanis living in these areas had to migrate from their homeland to Azerbaijan and have been living under miserable conditions since the early 1990s.\n\nThe period, spanning between 1220 and 1250s in the South Caucasus, as well as in Azerbaijan, is marked by significant events, such as the Mongol campaigns and Khwarazmshah Jalal al-Din's short rule in the region. The both Khwarazmshahs and Mongols established their rule here, having some similarities and differences of the governance. The Persian historical literature, as well as other textual sources contain various information concerning the period. The presented paper is devoted to investigating the mentioned issue, based on these sources. The study aims to examine the features of the Mongols and the Khwarazmshahs governing, and their consequences in the region. Azerbaijan became the target of Jalal al-Din's campaign, after the fall Khwarazmshahs due to the Mongol conquest Jalal al-Din conquered cities such as Maragha, Tabriz, Ganja and compelled the Shirvanshahs to vassalage. As a consequence of the second campaign of the Mongol general Chormagan, Jalal al-Din withdrew from Azerbaijan, bringing the entire South Caucasus under the Mongol control. These historical events were scrutinized through a comparative analysis and interpretation of other textual sources and scholarly works. Examining these issues through contemporary sources enables the clarification and objective analysis of political events, as well as economic and social conditions in the South Caucasus during that era.\n\nThe article deals with a brief history of Karabakh and the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict between the two republics of South Caucasus-Azerbaijan and Armenia, including the primary aim of defining the ethno-political processes and historical occurrences as emerging the Armenian problem in the Azerbaijani territory of Nogorno-Karabakh (Azerbaijani: Dağlıq Qarabağ). The aim of this writing is to learn how and why this ethnic, religious and political conflict appeared between Armenian and local population of Nogorno-Karabakh. Of course, all the remarkable factors in this article let us prove that the initial indigenous people of Karabakh were the Azerbaijani Turks. In fact, Karabakh historically and legally is an integral territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan recognized by the international community.\n\nAfter initiation of the glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) policies in the USSR by Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Union started to crumble, and old, forgotten, suppressed problems especially regarding territorial claims between Azerbaijanis and Armenians reemerged. Although Mountainous (Nagorno) Karabakh is officially part of Azerbaijan Republic, after fierce and bloody clashes between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, the entire Nagorno Karabakh region and seven additional surrounding districts of Lachin, Kelbajar, Agdam, Jabrail, Fizuli, Khubadly and Zengilan, it means over 20 per cent of Azerbaijan, were occupied by Armenians, and because of serious war situations, many Azerbaijanis living in these areas had to migrate from their homeland to Azerbaijan and they have been living under miserable conditions since the early 1990s. Mihail Gorbaçov tarafından başlatılan glasnost (açıklık) ve perestroyka (yeniden inşa) politikalarından sonra Sovyetler Birliği parçalanma sürecine girdi ve birlik coğrafyasındaki unutulmuş ve bastırılmış olan eski problemler, özellikle Azerbaycan Türkleri ve Ermeniler arasındaki sınır sorunları yeniden gün yüzüne çıktı. Bu bağlamda, hukuken Azerbaycan devletinin bir parçası olan Dağlık Karabağ bölgesi ve çevresindeki Laçin, Kelbecer, Cebrail, Agdam, Fizuli, Zengilan ve Kubatlı gibi yedi semt, yani yaklaşık olarak Azerbaycan‟ın yüzde yirmiye yakın toprağı, her iki toplum arasındaki şiddetli ve kanlı çarpışmalardan sonra Ermeniler tarafından işgal edildi. Ayrıca, olumsuz savaş şartları nedeniyle, binlerce Azerbaycan Türkü yaşadıkları topraklardan Azerbaycan‟a göç etmek zorunda kaldı ve söz konusu göçmenler hala çok kötü şartlar altında yaşamlarını sürdürmektedirler."
