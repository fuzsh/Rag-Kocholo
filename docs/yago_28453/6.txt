Philip I "the Handsome" of Castile (22 July 1478-25 September 1506) was King of Castile from 26 November 1504 to 25 September 1506, succeeding Fernando II of Aragon and preceding Joanna the Mad. Philip was the son of Emperor Maximilian I of Germany and Duchess Mary of Burgundy, and he inherited the Duchy of Burgundy's lands from his mother, creating the Habsburg Netherlands; when he married into Spanish royalty, he transferred his lands with him, leading to the creation of the Spanish Netherlands. Philip's reign as king was otherwise unimportant, as he died after only a few months of ruling unopposed.
