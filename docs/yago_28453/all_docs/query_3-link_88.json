        "text": "Lea la versi칩n en espa침ol\n\nWe go back in time and look for traces of the Spanish period.\n\nHistorical background\n\nOn 20 October 1496, Lier was the setting for the marriage of Philip the Handsome with Joanna of Castile, the daughter of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile. Their marriage laid the foundation for more than 200 years of union between the Southern Netherlands and Spain.\n\nJohanna left Spain and on her arrival in Antwerp she and her extensive entourage were given a grandiose reception. Philip travelled up from Tyrol. When the future couple met for the first time, there was an immediate spark.\n\nPhilip and Joanna had six children, including the later Emperor Charles V (1500).\n\nThe marriage had great political significance, when Joanna inherited the kingdom of Castile after Isabella's death (1504). Philip and Joanna became King and Queen. Philip died shortly thereafter (1506). Joanna was inconsolable and went mad with grief. Ferdinand was appointed regent as long as his grandson Charles was still a minor. After Ferdinand's death (1516), Charles became King of Spain.\n\nWhy did Philip the Handsome and Joanna of Castile get married in Lier?.\n\nFollowing the death of Mary of Burgundy, a period of political instability followed (1482-1492). As a small 'loyal' city, Lier was a better choice to organise this wedding than the major urban centres of power like Antwerp, Mechelen, Brussels or Leuven. Perhaps the choice was determined by the influential de Berghes family, who held court in Lier. The special devotion of the influential Duchess Margaret of York for the patron saint of Lier, Gummarus, perhaps also played a role.\n\nMemories from the Spanish period\n\nAt six locations in the city centre we find commemorative plaques that recall Joanna and Philip. Scan the QR code and discover the Spanish past."
