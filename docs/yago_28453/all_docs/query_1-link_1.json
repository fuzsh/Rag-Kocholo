        "text": "Philip I (born July 22, 1478, Bruges—died Sept. 25, 1506, Burgos, Spain) was the king of Castile for less than a month before his death and the founder of the Habsburg dynasty in Spain.\n\nPhilip was the son of the future Holy Roman emperor Maximilian I of Habsburg and Mary of Burgundy. At his mother’s death (1482) he succeeded to her Netherlands dominions, with Maximilian acting as regent for him during his minority. When Philip became of age, his interest in the Netherlands was soon subordinated to his hopes for the Spanish succession. In 1496 Philip was married to Joan the Mad, daughter of Ferdinand II the Catholic of Aragon and Isabella I the Catholic of Castile; Joan later inherited the crown of Castile. From January 1502 to March 1503 Philip and Joan lived in Spain and received homage as prospective heirs to the kingdoms of Aragon and Castile. Isabella died in 1504, leaving the crown of Castile to Joan. Philip was recognized as king consort. Because Joan was in the Netherlands at the time, Ferdinand, in accordance with Isabella’s will, acted as regent.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz"
