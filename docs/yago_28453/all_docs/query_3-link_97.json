        "text": "Joanna of Castile and Philip the Handsome in England\n\nEarly in 1506, Joanna and Philip defied advice not to travel in the middle of winter and sailed from Flanders to Castile to claim the throne, but they soon encountered terrible storms. The wind was so severe that, in London, the brass eagleweathervane was blown off the top of St Paul’s Cathedral. Twenty of the forty ships disappeared from sight. The royal carrack, the Julienne, had been in the thick of the storm. Fire had broken out on the first night of the storm, but brought under control. A huge wave had carried away the mast and main sail, with the ship taking on a strong list. A seaman named Heinrich of Stettin jumped overboard and cleared the main sail so that it could be pulled back on deck.\n\nPhilip and his knights took refuge in the poop cabin as they prayed and took vows in the midst of their seasickness and exhaustion. It was reported Joanna remained calm. The knights pooled their money in collection for “Our Lady of Guadalupe, the Protectoress” but Joanna pulled from her purse filled with gold pieces, a half ducat. When asked if she wasn’t afraid, she answered, “No, for I never heard of a King that was drowned”. Philip had been stitched into a leather case that was inflated and on the back was painted in bright colors, “The King Don Philip.” Sandoval reports that Joanna showed a ‘virile spirit’, dressing in her finest clothes and jewellery so that, if found, she would be recognised and buried.\n\nThe Julienne, without several masts, docked in the bay of Portland, in the small port of Melcombe Regis, near Weymouth, in Dorset, on 16 January. Philip sent his secretary, Antoine Le Flameng, to the English court. He and Joanna had to wade waist-high through crashing waves to reach land. Sir Thomas Trenchard, a local dignitary, escorted them to Wolfeton House, Charminster, where he and his wife, Elizabeth Strangways, entertained them pending new from Henry VII. The king of England invited Joanna and Philip to his Court. The couple became the first to import Chinese porcelain bowls into the UK when they presented Wolfeton owner Sir Thomas Trenchard with the bowls in gratitude for the hospitality.\n\nOn 28 January Joanna and Philip arrived to the city of Winchester. They stayed at the home of Richard Fox, Bishop of Winchester. Dressed in crimson and scarlet, Prince Henry of Wales, was dispatched to meet Philip and Joanna at Winchester and conduct them to Windsor. From Winchester Philip continued to Windsor with Prince Henry and a small party, excluding his wife.\n\nPhilip told an unknown addressee that the Queen was following him, without explaining where she was or why she had not accompanied him, while the anonymous chronicler of the journey claims she was ‘travaillée de la mer’. Philip might, however, have wished to keep Joanna’s presence at court to a minimum, concerned not only that the absence of a female entourage around Joanna reflected dishonour on them both but that Joanna might make her disagreements with him known, or conspire with her sister Katherine in Ferdinand’s favour.\n\nPhilip arrived to Windsor Castle on 31 January. The King of England gave him a reception worthy of a monarch. This included hunting and the usual sequence of feasts, jousts and disguisings. Within two hours of Philip arriving at Windsor, Katherine of Aragon had also got there. She and her sister-in-law Princess Mary Tudor did their best to entertain a grumpy and arrogant Philip. The women were led into the King’s dining chamber, ’where dance my lady princess, and a Spanish lady with her in Spanish array; and after she had danced two or three dances she left, and then danced my lady Mary and an English lady with her’.\n\nKatherine tried to engage her brother-in-law but he now remained steadfastly aloof, ’the lady princess desired the King of Castile to dance, which, after that he had excused him once or twice, answered that he was a mariner, “and yet,” said he, “you would cause me to dance;” and so he danced not, but communed still with the King’ Katherine’s earlier enthusiasm for her brother-in-law, if any survived, must have died with that very public snub. Katherine and Princess Mary sat together at the end of the carpet, which was under of cloth of estate, while Philip and Henry continued to chat about their own affairs, though Mary later impressed everyone with her lute-playing. The princess sang Spanish songs, taught to her by Katherine.\n\nUnknown to Katherine, Henry VII signed the secret Treaty of Windsor in which he backed Philip againts ‘his enemies’ - effectively backing him againts Ferdinand in the tussle for control of Castile. Joanna arrived more than a week later, on Tuesday 10 February. The queen of Castile and her party entered by the little park, and secretly came to the back side of the castle, unto the King’s new tower, where, at the stair foot, the King met with her, and kissed and embraced her. Philip had told Henry not to go to so much trouble. There was no need, in his eyes, for the English king to give his wife such a dignified welcome. At last, however, the two sisters met. ‘After the King had welcomed her, my lady princess her sister, my lady Mary the King’s daughter, having many ladies and gentlewomen attending upon them, welcome her’. The party went to Henry’s apartments.\n\nIt was the first time in almost six years that Katherine had seen a member of her close family. The presence of the Burgundian fleet allowed her to see the sister whose face she had not looked upon for nine whole years. But theirs was a strange and unsatisfactory meeting. The sisters scarcely had the opportunity to share any secrets, let alone speak in private. They spent a short time together during which they were closely supervised, before Joanna drew the meeting to a close for reasons which are unclear. Bethany Aram suggests that Joanna wanted to greet ships Ferdinand was sending to Falmouth. But Joanna headed to Exeter, at the castle of Earl of Arundel, to await her husband. David Starkey’s more likely explanation is that Philip, who had earlier snubbed Katherine, feared she might influence Joanna.\n\nNext day the princesses Katherine and Mary departed for Richmond. Katherine wrote to her sister of the ‘great pleasure it gave me to see you and the great distress which filled my soul, a few hours afterwards, on account of your hasty and sudden departure’. According to the English chronicler of the visit, Joanna and Philip stayed at Windsor Castle until the Saturday.\n\nOn 12 February Joanna signed, with Philip, what appears to be a truncated form of the Treaty of Windsor which, blandly worded, promises English aid and friendship to her descendants. Philip then went to Richmond, while Joanna took the ‘riche lytteres and cheares’ of the late Elizabeth of York on her return journey west after what must have been a brief but poignant encounter. Joanna ‘rejects all blandishments, seeking the darkness…’ Martire surmised.\n\nWhat is certain is that, at Windsor, Joanna and Philip had so serious and altercation that it nearly sparked a diplomatic incident. To this Katherine refers obliquely in a subsequent autograph letter, King Henry’s council had thought it advisable ‘not to interfere between husband and wife. On which account, and for other secret causes with which I was very well acquainted, he concealed the feelings occasioned by the departure of your highness, although it is very certain that it weighed much upon his heart. The great affection he has felt, and still feels, towards your royal highness from then until now, is well known.’\n\nIt seems that the Queen of Castile impressed Henry VII with her beauty. She ‘made a very good impression on me when I saw her’, Henry VII told Fuensalida in June 1508, referring to the meeting in February 1506. ‘She struck me as having a fine bearing and manner and spoke with restraint and complete authority; and although her husband and those who came with him implied she was mad, she struck me, on the contrary, as sane’.\n\nHenry VII took advantage of the situation to meet Philip, who ended up staying for almost three months. A Treaty of commerce was signed, on favourable terms to the English cloth merchants, and in exchange for recognising Philip as King of Castile and to marry Margaret of Austria, Henry VII received the assurance that the Yorkist Earl of Suffolk, Edmund de la Pole, would be surrendered to him from his foreign exile. The first stages of the much desired betrothal of Charles of Austria to Princess Mary Tudor were reached. Philip was installed in the Order of the Garter.\n\nIt was also a success for Prince Henry, who had been impressed by the glamorous and athletic Philip, regarded him as providing a model of leadership towards which he aspired. In later life, he would hang Philip’s portrait in Greenwich Palace, in a room named after the archduke. While in England, Philip invested the young prince with the Order of the Golden Fleece. The king managed to detain Philip with questions of trade and policy until the end of March. After meeting with his wife in Exeter, Joanna and Philip departed for Falmouth, where they arrived on March 26. They were received with much rejoicing.\n\nOn 9 April Prince Henry wrote to him in Spanish, in the first letter that survives in his hand, expressing his ‘heart’s desire’ to hear occasional new of Philip’s ‘good health and prosperity’ and referring to Katherine as his ‘most dear and well-beloved consort, the princess my wife’. In Falmouth Joanna and Philip had to stay another month until that their ships could sail. It was during this time infanta Catherine was conceived, the child to be born after the death of Philip the Handsome.\n\nSources:\n\nJuana I and the struggle for power in an age of transition (1504-1521) by Gillian B.Fleming.
