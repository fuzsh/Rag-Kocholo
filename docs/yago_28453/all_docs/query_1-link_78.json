        "text": "Description\n\nThe first Spanish Habsburg king\n\nThe son of Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I and grandson of Charles the Bold, known as Philip the Handsome (1478–1506); he was the first member of the house of Habsburg to be King of Castile. He reigned with his wife Joanna the Mad, before passing away suddenly of typhoid fever at the age of 28. Manuscript DS, signed “Philip,” one page, 11.5 x 8.5, December 21, 1505. Addressed to his treasurer in Lille, France, ordering him to sell his lands and manors of Flines les Raches, Coutiches, and Auchy-les-Orchies to the lord of Lalang, who until then had wished to make an exchange. In part (translated): “He presented us a new request...whereas an agreement of sale could be reached, which we considered an acceptable deal, which we granted him.” In very good condition, with intersecting folds (vertical folds passing through two letters of the signature), light foxing, a few tears repaired with tape to reverse, and a professionally restored area of paper loss to the upper left corner. An exceedingly rare royal document.
