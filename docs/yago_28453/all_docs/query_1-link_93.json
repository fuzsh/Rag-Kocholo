        "text": "Juana I of Castile (1479–1555) was the daughter of Isabel I of Castile (1451–1504) and Ferdinand II of Aragon (1452–1516), better known as The Catholic Monarchs. In 1496, before it was imagined she would become her parents' heir, she married Philip of Habsburg (1478–1506), the son of the Holy Roman Emperor, Maximillian I (1459–1519). She inherited the Crown of Castile after her mother's passing, but ended up being sidelined by her husband, her father, and her eldest son, Emperor Charles V (1500–1558). She is traditionally known as \"La Loca\" (The Mad) and as such was confined in Tordesillas (Valladolid, Castile) for over forty years. During this long incarceration, Castile was governed in succession by her father, Cardinal Cisneros, and finally by her son, who also ruled over the Crown of Aragon, his Habsburg inheritances, and Castile's American colonies. In Juana's case, to disentangle historical facts, cultural construction of disease and emotions, gender bias, legend, and myth is a particularly hard task, given that the \"Mad Queen\" has been romanticized for a very long time and across different genres, including literature, history, art, and cinema. Fleming's book is a meticulous and thoroughly researched study that focuses on political history, and specifically on Juana and the Crown of Castile, exploring how and why the queen's \"use and representation of power mattered to her kingdoms a great deal\" (x), and disentangling why she could not rule as expected.\n\nThis study answers the question that has puzzled historians for centuries, from Jerónimo Zurita to Gillian Fleming: Was Juana mad? Its response is a well-supported, rather convincing, and resounding \"no.\" Fleming painstakingly examines an array of published and unpublished primary sources (chronicles and other literary texts, diplomatic correspondence, and archival documents) and engages with secondary scholarship to retell Juana's life and circumstances. After a short preface, the book is divided into fifteen chapters, but lacks a formal introduction and conclusion, although the preface and the last chapter could be construed as such. This structure adds to the narrative feeling of the book. The account starts in 1496, when the teen princess Juana sailed to Flanders to marry Archduke Philip, and finishes in 1555, when she died in Tordesillas, aged seventy-five. The volume is organized in a peculiar way: every chapter could function independently because at the end, each includes not only the endnotes, but also [End Page 183] full references of all the works cited, even when the same sources and secondary texts are also cited in other parts. This short review cannot do justice to such a long and exhaustive book (356 pages), so instead of summarizing the chapters, only some of the main arguments that demonstrate Fleming's arguments and her reassessment of some of Juana's particulars will be addressed.\n\nJuana became heiress of Castile in 1500 because her brother Juan, her sister Isabel, and her nephew Miguel, had all died in quick succession. When Juana and Philip came to Castile to be sworn as heirs, he ended up going back to his lands while she battled her mother to rejoin him and their children there. Juana finally left Castile, but paid a high price in an episode traditionally read as Juana's privileging of her role as wife and mother over that of queen-in-training. Fleming has a more sympathetic approach, placing Juana in the \"torment of indecision\" and as someone who took her \"marriage vows seriously\" (51), even as she recognizes Juana's \"difficulty in controlling a quick temper and her hypersensitivity\" (53). Juana had a most unsupportive husband, who undermined and distrusted her, and who wanted to govern by himself, not hesitating to discredit his wife before her parents, to the point of sending them a damaging \"record of her extravagances\" (54). Fleming also acknowledges Juana's \"depression and descontamiento\" (65). All of this pushed Isabel..."
