        "text": "Joanna the Mad and Philip the Handsome was one of the more influential marriages in early modern history, as it occurred right as Spain was becoming one of the most powerful kingdoms in history and made them closely linked to Austria and the HRE. But no marriage is set in stone, and I'm curious as to who the other options might be. Could we see an Avis Spain or a Tudor Iberia? (or anyone but those are the first coming to mind)\n\nShe could have married Henry VII Tudor after Philip the Handsome died. But given that her six children with Philip would all variously be ahead of their Tudor half siblings (if there are any), I don't think a Tudor Iberia is likely.\n\nIf she had a son by Henry VII, that son would came BEFORE his four half-sisters in the Spanish line of succession (but such match is pretty ASB as Juana is technically Queen of Castile and Fernando want keep her under key in Castile). Juana having children by Henry VII if they married is pretty likely as she was widowed at 27 years old)\n\nManuel of Portugal, Emperor Maximilian or surviving Ferdinand II of Naples.\n\nOnly Manuel if he became King of Portugal BEFORE negotiations for Philip and Juana‘s wedding started AND was less determined to marry Isabella than OTL can work.\n\nMaximilian at this point is already married so either Bianca Maria died much earlier than OTL or you need a totally different situation in Italy for preventing their match.\n\nFerrante II of Naples no way as Fernando hated that branch of the family and kept civil relations with them only when his sister and niece were Queen Consorts there and in any case Giovanna made much more sense than Juana as bride for Ferrante from both sides.\n\nI can see Fernando arranging a wedding between one of his daughters and a member of the branch of Naples only if he has Catalina back and she is already a little old and want absolutely marry her to a King (and possibly keep her in Castile to help with his plans). Then marrying her to Ferrante of Calabria and giving them Naples after his death would make sense (but still be a stretch)\n\nPossible but no way that match will ever go on\n\nThe OP asked for options. If things had been timed differently (Isabel of Aragon had died later), Maria might've wound up as Queen to Vladislaus II of Hungary to replace Beatrice of Naples or Queen of Scots. Saw a TL once where she married Christian II of Denmark (by sheer dint of it being the only kings available)\n\nThe OP asked for options.

Maria is much more flexible but Juana‘s only realistic matches are Austria or Portugal..."
