        "text": "(1478–1506). The reign of King Philip I of Spain lasted less than a month. It was significant, however, for establishing the Hapsburg dynasty in Spain. The Hapsburgs would govern Spain for nearly two centuries.\n\nPhilip was born on July 22, 1478, in the city of Brugge (now in Belgium). He was the son of Maximilian I, a Hapsburg and future Holy Roman emperor, and Mary, daughter of the duke of Burgundy. When his mother died in 1482, he inherited her Netherlands territories under the guardianship of his father. In 1496 Philip married Joan (called Joan the Mad), a daughter of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, the first king and queen of Spain. Isabella died in 1504, leaving Castile to Joan and Philip."
