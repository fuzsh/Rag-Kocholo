        "text": "So we all know about Juana la loca, the middle child of Queen Isabell and King Ferdinand and her husband Philip and how Philip died in 1506 while Joanna lived and was effectively robbed of her crown. So what if it was Joanna who died in 1506 instead of Philip? Would Philip just go home, since he can't bring Charles to Castile or would he stay there? Who does he remarry in this scenario and how does Ferdinand II of Aragon react?\n\nI think that, with the help of many Castilian nobles, who harboured a deep dislike for Felipe because of his Catalan origins, Philip could come to Spain regardless of the death of Juana, especially if she died after becoming Queen of Castille. This way, Philip would become King of Castile, or at least regent. In addition to the support of the anti-Catalan nobility in Castille, there were also powerful international factors that favoured closer relations between Austria and Spain, giving Phillip more support to stay in Spain.\n\na deep dislike for Felipe because of his Catalan origins\n\nI think you mean Ferdinand. Plus Philip was in Castile when he died so in this timeline when Joanna dies he is the one left in Castile.\n\nSo Philip becomes King of Castile in his own right? I wonder how Ferdinand would react.\n\nNo, i imagine op means what if joanna dies, leaving castille to her son, Charles.\n\nI personally think Charles would travel to Castille at that young age, meaning he would be more like Ferdinand, who was a Spaniard by culture. Perhaps Philip brings Ferdinand back to Flanders when he inevitably returns home, because no one is going to accept him as regent, switching the brothers around.\n\npersonally think Charles would travel to Castille at that young age, meaning he would be more like Ferdinand, who was a Spaniard by culture. Perhaps Philip brings Ferdinand back to Flanders when he inevitably returns home, because no one is going to accept him as regent, switching the brothers around.\n\nBut the reason Charles was left behind was because the Burgundians refused to accept him as their heir if he wasn't raised there. All though the idea of Ferdinand being the German son and Charles the Spanish son is interesting.\n\nFernando would serve as regent for whichever one of the grandsons he and Philip decide will succeed to the Castilian throne, and as someone already mentioned, it's very possible that the roles could be reversed between Charles and Ferdinand.\n\nFernando would serve as regent for whichever one of the grandsons he and Philip decide will succeed to the Castilian throne, and as someone already mentioned, it's very possible that the roles could be reversed between Charles and Ferdinand.\n\nThat would be extremely interesting, would Philip not have a role. Plus it could take a while for Philip and Ferdinand to agree as in our timeline they hated one another. Also does Philip remarry in this timeline? If he lives long enough to become Holy Roman Emperor how would his reign do?\n\nI think you mean Ferdinand. Plus Philip was in Castile when he died so in this timeline when Joanna dies he is the one left in Castile.\n\nyes, sorry, I did mean Ferdinand\n\nDon't worry about it. Anyways does anyone have any suggestions for who Philip remarries to in this scenario?\n\nIt’s such a shame Margaret Tudor is already married and Mary is only ten at this point, I would really like to see Philip marrying a Tudor for some reason.\n\nHe could marry Mary Tudor, but that is a tad bit out there. @kasumigenx is probably correct with the Jagiellonian Princess suggestion.\n\nElizabeth of Poland (b. 1482) is available, though she’ll probably be considered a bit too old. But it won’t be much of an issue as Philip as two healthy sons and many daughters at this point.\n\nElizabeth of Poland (b. 1482) is available, though she’ll probably be considered a bit too old. But it won’t be much of an issue as Philip as two healthy sons and many daughters at this point.\n\nHow come? She is only 24, which is pretty young, especially for the time. Plus he would probably remarry because he would want to secure his dynasty (due to high infant mortality rates).\n\nElizabeth of Poland (b. 1482) is available, though she’ll probably be considered a bit too old. But it won’t be much of an issue as Philip as two healthy sons and many daughters at this point.\n\nShe could work, though I’m thinking that Philip might want a bride more in the interest of Burgundy.\n\nHe could marry Mary Tudor, but that is a tad bit out there. @kasumigenx is probably correct with the Jagiellonian Princess suggestion.\n\nIf Joanna had lived until 1510/1511, such a match might work.\n\nShe could work, though I’m thinking that Philip might want a bride more in the interest of Burgundy.\n\nBut then the only real option is Germaine of Foix\n\nIf Joanna had lived until 1510/1511, such a match might work.\n\nIndeed it could, but here she dies in 1506, when Mary is only 10."
