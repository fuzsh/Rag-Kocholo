Irving G. Thalberg Jr., a university philosophy professor and son of Oscar-winning producer Irving G. Thalberg and actress Norma Shearer, died Friday after what his family said was a long illness. He was 56.

Thalberg died at his Syracuse, N.Y., home, his wife, Deborah, said. The younger Thalberg received his Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1960. He taught at Oberlin College from 1960 to 1963 and at the University of Illinois at Chicago from 1965 until his death.

Thalberg also was a visiting professor at the University of Washington, Stanford University, the University of Chicago, Northwestern University and Fudan University in Shanghai, his wife said.

He published three books and more than 70 articles.

His father, the legendary production chief at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, won Oscars for “Grand Hotel,” “Mutiny on the Bounty,” and “Broadway Melody.” He died in 1936. His mother won an Academy Award in 1930 for her role in “The Divorcee.” She died in 1983.
