        "text": "I could probably write a book full of articles about the fun and exciting Old Hollywood related spots that my new husband and I visited on our honeymoon in LA this last week. We paid our respects at five cemeteries and walked through several museums just to cite a few places, but perhaps the most special of them all was my first visit to The Hollywood Heritage Museum! It wouldn’t be an understatement to call Norma Shearer one of my favorite actresses of all time. I’ve seen dozens of her films and I’ve been fascinated by Norma’s talent, determination, beauty, and place in history as a feminist pioneer onscreen for as long as I can remember. Norma most notably caught hold of my eye and heart with her performance in Marie Antoinette (1938) opposite Tyrone Power. In fact, as crazy as it is to say now that I’ve completed Tyrone Power’s filmography, Marie Antoinette (1938) was the first film of both Shearer and Power that I ever saw over a decade ago!\n\nWhen I learned that Darin Barnes, an invaluable member of the classic film community and undoubtedly Norma Shearer’s biggest fan, was compiling and displaying some of the jewels of his collection in one glorious exhibit at The Hollywood Heritage Museum, I knew that I had to go! There was only one problem: I was due to fly out of LA the day before the exhibit’s opening! I was heartbroken but I took a chance and reached out to Darin, who was so incredibly kind to go out of his way and come into the museum to give me an early preview on Thursday. I took an insane amount of pictures as Darin explained each extraordinary photograph, poster, costume, contract, publicity ephemera, and much, much more. I would love to share every photograph that I took with you all, but I want to ensure and emphasize that every single person who adores Old Hollywood, Norma Shearer, and LA history needs to support Darin and The Hollywood Heritage Museum and give this exhibit a visit! Admission is only $10 for non-members and the exhibit is set to remain open until October 16th, but I have it in good confidence that the more support the exhibit receives, the longer it will stay open, so please keep visiting and spreading the word!\n\nTo start with, Darin had an amazing collection of early photographs of Norma, including some with her siblings and some from her early films! The most shocking thing to see right off the bat were Norma’s first two film contracts: the first she signed with her mother as a minor as well as the second she signed alone once she came of age and negotiated better terms.\n\nDarin had a treasure trove of collectibles and photographs from every film that Norma Shearer appeared in. I loved discussing the process of assembling his massive collection with the help of a wonderful friend of mine, Christina Rice, who penned both Jane Russell and Ann Dvorak’s biographies. As Darin explained it, Christina would exclaim, “Okay, bring me everything you have on Riptide (1934)!” And Darin would do just that, sometimes bringing out photographs, set pieces, and costumes never before seen by the public. One perfect example is this snippet of canary yellow dress that was given to a contest winner that actually came from the iconic dress from Riptide (1934), signed by Shearer herself. This is the dress that appears on the gorgeous poster!\n\nAnother example that took my breath away and has seemed to do the same for many who visit the exhibit is this publicity photo (seen upper center) from The Women (1939)! According to Darin, Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, and Rosalind Russell each had individual say over which photographs they preferred for the publicity of the film, and those approved by all three would eventually be used. This was one of the photographs that was never used and never seen before now because Rosalind Russell approved it but Norma and Joan did not! Darin obtained the photograph courtesy of Rosalind Russell’s estate.\n\nDarin had more than one Norma Shearer costume on display, but to avoid spoiling everything, I’ll just show you the pièce de résistance from one of my all-time favorite Norma films: her circus costume from Idiot’s Delight (1938)! I adored having someone to chat with about that film who truly understands and respects its genius, and this costume has held up magnificently for being nearly ninety!\n\nAnd when it came to memorabilia regarding Marie Antoinette (1938), I certainly wasn’t disappointed! Darin displayed some incredible promotional material, photographs, magazines, and most magnificently, a letter with a fascinating story. Apparently a man out of work in pictures approached Norma on set and expressed his dream to her of wanting to become a makeup artist for the stars. Upon hearing this, Shearer hired him on the spot, and in return he had a bouquet of roses sent to her dressing room on the first day of shooting Marie Antoinette (1938) together. Norma wrote a letter of thanks in return, and that is the letter you see here.\n\nDarin also made sure to include scores of information and treasures from the latter portion ofNorma Shearer’s life following her shocking retirement from pictures, including cases about the discovery of Janet Leigh and Robert Evans, who both went on to contribute massively to the motion picture industry following Norma’s departure. Even Janet Leigh’s daughter Jamie Lee Curtis expressed her well wishes for the exhibit and a quote from Jamie Lee about Norma was specifically given to the museum to display."
