        "text": "What becomes readily apparent when watching the FX series Feud is that Joan Crawford (Jessica Lange) and Bette Davis (Susan Sarandon) had far more in common than not. This extends to the ups and downs of their careers, their ball-busting reputations, and their modern approaches to sex. Though Crawford was, throughout her life, always considered the more obviously sexually desirable of the two, neither woman was above using a romance for personal and professional gain.\n\nThe second episode of Feud alleges that Davis slept with her Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? director Robert Aldrich (Alfred Molina) . There isn’t much evident to back this up—not even in Davis’s most comprehensive and salacious biographies—but it was absolutely something Davis could have done. And it’s possible that Davis’s romance with Aldrich is rarely mentioned because she and Crawford had so many other fascinating affairs, marriages, and scandals: between the two of them, Davis and Crawford racked up eight husbands. Or was it nine?\n\n“I liked sex in a way that was considered unbecoming for a woman of my time,” Davis told her biographer Charlotte Chandler. “The way I felt was only considered appropriate for a man. It was both a physical and emotional need. It had advantages in the pleasure it brought me, but it also made me a victim—dependent.”\n\nCrawford, too, often took the lead in her various romances with an eye on how they could help her improve her lot in life. “How can I compete with Norma?” she once famously complained of rival Norma Shearer. “She sleeps with the boss!” (Shearer was married to MGM head of production Irving Thalberg.) Eventually, it seems, Crawford would take an “if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em” approach.\n\nHere—ranked in order of old Hollywood scandal—are the many loves and affairs of Crawford and Davis, including the man who helped kicked off their feud in the first place.\n\n12. Harmon “Oscar” Nelson (Bette): Davis’s first husband, for whom she reportedly nicknamed the Academy Award “Oscar,” divorced her, citing “cruel and inhumane” treatment. He alleged that she neglected him in order to pursue her acting. “You might say he named my career as a co-respondent,” Davis quipped to biographer Chandler. But “Ham”—as he was better known—had even more explosive dirt on Davis: evidence of her torrid affair with director Howard Hughes.\n\n11. William Grant Sherry (Bette): When Sherry and Davis divorced after five years of marriage (and one child, B.D.), Davis’s third husband married their nanny, Marion Richards. There must have been at least a little bit of acrimony there, because Richards would later accuse Davis of murdering her second husband. (More on that below.)\n\n10. James Welton (Joan): According to most official biographies, Joan Crawford only had four husbands. But there are rumors that she was also briefly married in New York, before she moved to Hollywood to marry into one of the most famous families in town. Welton was a saxophone player Crawford met during her chorus girl days in New York. In her 1981 book Gone But Not Forgotten, author Patricia Fox-Sheinwold alleges (with no actual proof) that the two got hitched:\n\nThe big event at that time, one that has been kept locked up in the Hall of Records, was [Joan's] first marriage. When she arrived in Hollywood after a successful screen test to accept MGM's offer, the marriage was verboten. Because starlets in those days testified that they were unmarried, which was the rule. Since she [Joan] didn’t drive in those days, Jimmy had to drive her daily to the studio at the crack of dawn and then pick her up while trying to keep out of sight. The marriage wore thin and they divorced in the middle or late 20’s in California.\n\n9. Clark Gable (Joan): Despite their combined level of fame and their occasional marriages to other people, the long-standing affair between Gable and Crawford somehow miraculously avoided scandalizing Hollywood. The pair worked together on eight films, fell in and out of their sexual relationship, and—above all else—fostered a true, enduring friendship based on mutual respect. Crawford told Chandler, who wrote both her biography and Davis’s:\n\nClark was all man. I’ve been asked many times about him and what was so attractive about him. I can tell you, and I can tell you in one word if you won’t be shocked: Balls! Clark Gable had balls. There were people who said we were having an affair. Well, they could say what they wanted, but the source of the information wasn’t me and it wasn’t Clark. We weren’t that kind of people. And I never saw any witnesses in the bedroom.\n\n8. Vincent Sherman (Joan): Like many of her male contemporaries in Hollywood, Crawford knew how to exploit sexual desire in order to get what she wanted. She allegedly used sex in order to climb her way out of nowhere—first to Detroit, then Broadway, then Hollywood. In an August 2016 episode of her “You Must Remember This” podcast, host Karina Longworth details the many casting couches Crawford willingly hopped on in order to shrewdly climb her way to the top. We’ll let the Vincent Sherman—the 1950 director of her film The Damned Don't Cry!—stand in for all of them.\n\n“Never had I encountered such female boldness,” Sherman told Crawford’s biographer. Crawford allegedly seduced the married director: “I was ­confronted with a woman who went after what she wanted with a masculine approach to sex.” When he later confessed the affair to his wife, Sherman recalls her placid response: “Well. I guess it’s too much to ask of any man that he turn down the opportunity to sleep with Joan Crawford.”\n\n7. Howard Hughes (Bette): Notorious womanizer Howard Hughes seems more like the kind of Hollywood power player Crawford would have gone after. But Davis made some explosively delicious claims about the man who also dated Ava Gardner, Olivia de Havilland, Katharine Hepburn, Ginger Rogers, Rita Hayworth, and Gene Tierney. Speaking with Chandler, Davis said she was the only woman to ever bring Hughes to “climax.” She adds: “Or so he said at the time. It may have been his regular gambit. Anyway it worked with me, and it was cheaper than buying gifts. But ‘Howard Huge’ he was not.”\n\n6. Gary Merrill (Bette) Merrill may not have been a significant entry into the many lives and loves of Bette Davis, but their decade-long marriage (1950-1960) did inspire this potentially apocryphal zinger from the actress: “Gary was a macho man, but none of my husbands was ever man enough to become Mr. Bette Davis.”\n\n5. William Wyler (Bette) There were many men in Davis’s life, but she famously described director William Wyler as the one that got away. The two collaborated on some her best work—The Letter (1940) and The Little Foxes (1941)—and conducted an affair off-screen. “Willie was the love of my life—no question,” Davis told Chandler. “He was everything I ever dreamed of in a man, so love and passion soon followed.” For his part, Wyler told Chandler that Davis “was very passionate and emotional, with more energy than anyone I’d ever known. Too much for me.” Wyler and Davis’s accounts vary as to what went wrong between them. She claims she wanted to marry him; he claims she said she never did. But Davis did give Chandler a heartbreaking account of later visiting Wyler on the set of his 1959 film Ben-Hur. According to Davis, Wyler greeted her coolly and politely, as if there had never been a love affair between them. In other words, he may have been the love of her life—but the feeling, apparently, was not mutual.\n\n4. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (Joan): This affair—more than any other in Crawford’s long career—can be credited with launching the actress to stardom. She arrived in Hollywood a penniless dancer from Detroit and, within a few years, had married the son of Hollywood’s reigning king and queen: Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford. In an August 2016 episode of the “You Must Remember This” podcast, Longworth explains in detail just how truly scandalous Crawford’s first Hollywood marriage was. Crawford wasn’t welcome on the grounds of the couple’s famed estate—Pickfair—for the first eight months of the 1929 marriage. The actress eventually won over Douglas Fairbanks Sr., but never managed to break the ice with her husband’s step-mother Mary. Joan and Fairbanks Jr. (both inclined towards infidelity) would divorce in 1933, but not before Joan’s star got a dramatic boost thanks to her husband’s incredibly famous last name.\n\n3. Arthur Farnsworth (Bette): Davis, like Crawford, married a man with an A-name who had nothing to do with Hollywood. Farnsworth was an innkeeper, and he and Davis were married until his untimely death in 1943. That death is, to this day, still categorized as “mysterious” by Davis biographers. Farnsworth died of complications from a skull fracture he had sustained a good deal earlier, and—whether routine or no—Davis was interrogated during the inquest. According to the Los Angeles Times, Davis told authorities that her husband had \"fallen down the stairs two months earlier at their New Hampshire home while running to answer the phone.” That may have been what happened, but it’s an eerie coincidence when you consider what happened to Joan’s husband Alfred.\n\n2. Alfred Steele (Joan) Joan’s final husband, Pepsi-Cola mogul Alfred Steele, wasn’t himself the source of any controversy, but long after his 1959 death from a heart attack, scandal came knocking. In her 1977 obituary, The New York Times wrote of Crawford: “Two days after her husband died of a heart attack, she was elected the first woman director of the company’s board.” Much later, Crawford’s estranged daughter, Christina, would allege something much more sinister. Speaking with The Village Voice’s Michael Musto after a screening of her 2012 documentary Surviving Mommie Dearest, Crawford’s oldest adopted daughter said: “I didn’t believe it was an accident.” Steele was found dead at the bottom of their home’s enormous stairway; as Christina Crawford said ominously, “I know what Mommie was capable of in a state of rage . . . There was no autopsy. He was cremated.” It should be noted that many of Christina Crawford’s allegations—which filled the pages of her best-selling Mommie Dearest and inspired its hugely popular film adaptation—have been called into question by Joan’s friends and family.\n\n1. Franchot Tone (Bette and Joan) Franchot Tone’s career as an actor may not have survived the test of time (though classic film lovers will remember his Ensign Byam from 1935’s Mutiny on the Bounty), but he scores the top spot on the list for having the honor of catching the eye of both Crawford and Davis. As FX’s Feud implies, he might be the spark that kicked off the long-standing rivalry between Davis and Crawford. “I fell in love with Franchot, professionally and privately,” Davis wrote later in life of her 1935 Dangerous co-star. “Everything about him reflected his elegance, from his name to his manners.”"
