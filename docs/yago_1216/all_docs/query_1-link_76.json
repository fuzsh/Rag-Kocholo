        "text": "You won't find today's entry here. You'll find it at Kate Gabrielle's excellent blog Silents and Talkies. She has done a painting for me of Norma Shearer (which I now own, yay!) and I wrote a guest post for her blog. It will be up today, so check it out and let me know what you think.\n\nAlso, while I'm linkin' it up, if you'd like to visit some excellent Norma Shearer sites here are my top three favorites. Enjoy!\n\nDivas: The Site ~ Norma Shearer\n\nNorma Shearer at Classic Movie Favorites\n\nLady of the Night ~ Norma Shearer\n\nNorma Shearer was known for her short hair and striking profile. A photograph of her would have likely shown Norma wearing her characteristic helmet of curls that would crown her temples. It was a look that the Queen of MGM carried with her throughout her talking picture career, only deviating for films such as Marie Antoinette and Idiot's Delight which required her to wear wigs.\n\nHowever, a younger Norma in the silent era had a much different look. Norma had long flowing curls. They were frizzy, bountiful and glorious. She usually wore them up, tied in the back yet ocassionally she would let them loose and they would flow down her neck and shoulders.\n\nPhotographs of Norma in her twenties showed that she carried those curls in many different ways. Her hair was of various lengths and styles and it always looked different. I haven't been able to find much information about Norma Shearer's hairstyle which doesn't surprise me. I may be the only one to whom this matters and I doubt biographers Gavin Lambert and Lawrence Quirk ever cared about such triviality.\n\nIn the same way I obsess with Bette Davis' blonde look, I simply adore the long curly locks of Norma Shearer. Why? Because I secretly have long curly hair too. I say \"secretly\" because I wear mine straight, wavy or in ironed curls. I'd like to think Norma Shearer's hair was naturally curly like mine. We both found ways to tame of our locks to flatter our appearance, but hidden beneath the surface were wild curls just waiting to spring into their natural state.\n\n(Pictures of Norma from Divas: The Site)\n\nEdith Norma Shearer was born August 11, 1900 or 1902 in Montreal, Québec, Canada. It's unclear which year. Norma came from a privileged Scottish family. Her father Andrew Shearer owned his own business which was at first successful but eventually failed, leaving his family destitute. Norma's mother, Edith Shearer, had high hopes for herself, for her two daughters (Athole and Norma) and son (Douglas) and refused to settle for their current situation. Edith took the kids and eventually moved them to New York.\n\nEdith at first wanted Norma to be a pianist, however Norma's early career involved bouts in vaudeville and modeling. She landed an infamous gig as the Springfield Tires billboard girl Miss Lotta Miles which her future rival Joan Crawford loved to poke fun at.\n\nOne day, almost out of the blue, Norma decided she wanted to be an actress and she and Athole auditioned and got bit parts in the Olive Thomas film The Flapper (1920). Edith joined in on the fun and they all became extras in the barn dance scece in D.W. Griffith classic silent Way Down East (1920). Norma took that opportunity to meet the director so she stood under an arc-light to show off her features. Griffith gave her one good look and told her she would never become a star.\n\nNorma continued to make films in New York and got noticed in The Stealers (1922) and with the help of producer Hal Roach, she made her way over to Hollywood. The day after her arrival she met with producer Irving Thalberg of MGM (then known as The Mayer Company). He was so young she mistook him for an office boy until she saw him sit behind the producer's desk and put his feet up. They were both impressed by each other, Irving by Norma's charisma and drive and Norma by Irving's power and work ethic.\n\nNorma signed with MGM and made many movies with MGM's top stars Lon Chaney Jr., Conrad Nagel and John Gilbert. She wasn't an instant success but with each film her star rose higher and higher in the Hollywood heavens. After various affairs with other people, Thalberg proposed marriage to Shearer and she accepted. The marriage would make her the Queen of MGM and it was a union of business and mutual admiration and respect. Most say Shearer was an opportunist as the union helped get her lots of choice roles, but Shearer hard to work hard to prove herself.\n\nIn 1929, Norma helped usher in a new era of talking pictures with MGM's first talkie The Trial of Mary Dugan (1929). Her upper-class Canadian accent worked well and the transition was smooth for her. She was however very unhappy with her roles and wanted better parts. She proved to her husband Thalberg that she had potential beyond her \"good girl\" roles and she landed parts in pre-code classics such as The Divorceé (1930) and A Free Soul (1931), for which she won the Best Actress Academy Award. Her career boomed and she made lots of popular pictures with co-stars such as Clark Gable, Robert Montgomery and Leslie Howard. Most fans today love her Prestige Films which are those films she made from 1936-1939 including Marie Antoinette (1938) and The Women (1939).\n\nNorma had two children with Irving: Irving Jr. (b. 1930) and Katherine (b. 1935). Irving's health was very poor due to a heart condition and he passed away in 1936 leaving Norma a widow. She continued to make films for MGM However, Norma was aging and becoming less and less believable in romantic leads. When Her Cardboard Lover (1942) proved to be a total flop, she made the decision to end her acting career.\n\nNorma met ski instructor Martin Arrouge, a handsome strapping man some 12 years her junior and married him in 1942. Martin (whom she convinced to go by the name \"Marti\") and Norma were a very suitable pair. She wanted to continue living as a queen and he wanted someone to adore. They remained married until Norma's death.\n\nWhat very few people realize is that Norma's family had a history of mental illness. Sister Athole was in and out of mental hospitals and her parents and her brother Douglas had their own manias. Norma was a very poor mother to her children and had very little in the form of maternal instincts. She became obsessed with her appearance (a trait she shared with her mother) and in her advanced years succumbed to failing eyesight and dementia, often calling her second husband Martin, \"Irving\". She passed away on June 12th, 1983.\n\n------------------\n\nFuture posts will reveal even more about Shearer, her love life, her career, etc. so stay tuned!\n\nMy good friend Kevin recently did a lecture on Humphrey Bogart & Lauren Bacall at a local Adult Education Center. Unfortunately, I couldn't attend this time but I was absolutely sure his lecture would be a hit. And of course it was! Kevin was willing to share with me the trivia and fact sheet he passed out to the lecture attendees. Here it is below. If you'd like to read about Kevin's past lectures, please take this opportunity to look at my posts about his Otto Preminger lecture and his Elian Kazan lecture. Enjoy!\n\nStarring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall:\n\nTo Have and Have Not (1944)\n\nThe Big Sleep (1946)\n\nDark Passage (1947)\n\nKey Largo (1948)\n\nOther Great Humphrey Bogart Films:\n\nThe Petrified Forest (1936)\n\nThe Maltese Falcon (1941)\n\nCasablanca (1942)\n\nThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948)\n\nIn a Lonely Place (1950)\n\nThe African Queen (1951)\n\nThe Caine Mutiny (1954)\n\nOther Great Lauren Bacall Films:\n\nHow to Marry a Millionaire (1953)\n\nWritten on the Wind (1956)\n\nMurder on the Orient Express (1974)\n\nThe Mirror Has Two Faces (1996)\n\nDogville (2003)\n\nFacts and Trivia about Bogie and Bacall\n\nLauren Bacall's birth name is Betty Perske. After her father abandoned her and her mother, she took her mother's maiden name, Bacal. An extra \"L\" was added upon her entrance into Hollywood, and she was given the name \"Lauren\" by director Howard Hawks.\n\nHumphrey Bogart's full name was Humphrey DeForest Bogart – made up of three family surnames.\n\nBack when she was a self-described gawky teenager, Bacall met her hero, actress Bette Davis, in a hotel room meeting arranged by her uncle, who had connections in show business. Bacall later played Davis's famous Margo Channing character from the movie All About Eve in a stage adaptation re-titled Applause.\n\nBogart briefly attended Phillips Academy in Andover, MA. He was expelled.\n\nBacall's rather auspicious debut at age 19 in To Have and Have Not contrasted greatly to Bogart's own career trajectory. Despite a great role in the 1936 film The Petrified Forest as gangster, Duke Mantee, his stardom didn't become cemented until he was in his early forties, when he starred in The Maltese Falcon and Casablanca.\n\nDuring their courtship, Bogie and Bacall liked to call each other \"Slim\" and \"Steve\" after their characters' nicknames in To Have and Have Not. \"Slim\" and \"Steve\" were also the nicknames of director Howard Hawks and his wife, Nancy.\n\nBogart was 25 years older than Bacall and had been married three times by the time he met her.\n\nBoth Bogie and Bacall were models before they were actors. Bogart's mother was Maud Humphrey, a successful commercial artist. She drew sketches of him when he was an infant which became product advertisements. For this reason, Bogart is referred to as \"the Maud Humphrey Baby\". Bacall's exotic good looks attracted the attention of famous fashion magazine editor, Diana Vreeland. Bacall's pictorial in Harper's Bazaar summarily led to her discovery by Howard Hawks's wife, Nancy \"Slim\" Hawks.\n\nBogart and Bacall named their daughter Leslie, after actor Leslie Howard. Bogart felt forever indebted to Howard for helping him land his breakthrough role as gangster, Duke Mantee, in the 1936 film The Petrified Forest.\n\nShortly after they got married, Bogart presented Bacall with a mink coat. Bacall promptly threw the coat onto the floor and proceeded to walk on it with her bare feet, reveling that she had always wanted to walk on mink.\n\nBogart was the founding member of the Fifties \"The Rat Pack\", a phrase coined by Bacall after he and some friends returned home from a late night in Las Vegas. \"You look like a goddamn rat pack\", she's reported to have said. The members included friends like Katharine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy, Nathaniel Benchley, Judy Garland, Sid Luft, Frank Sinatra, and David Niven.\n\nBoth liberal Democrats, Bogie and Bacall were strong supporters of Adlai Stevenson, during his Presidential campaigns in 1952 and 1956.\n\nBogart and Bacall were clearly each other's greatest loves. Bogart practically risked his life in divorcing his then volatile wife, Mayo Methot, to marry Bacall. After Bogart's death, Bacall later married actor Jason Robards. Many people have noted the strong physical resemblance between the two actors.\n\nNorma Shearer Week\n\nSunday March 29th to Saturday April 4th\n\non Out of the Past ~ A Classic Film Blog\n\nTo celebrate my queen, for no reason other than I want to, I'm dedicating an entire week to her. Every day, I'll have a new post on Norma Shearer. It's all Norma, all week long!\n\nSuch adoration makes the Queen of MGM very happy...\n\nOver the years that I have been watching Norma Shearer's films, it has been easier and easier to get access to them. Several films have become available on DVD and TCM has heard my pleas (along with everyone else's) for more Norma Shearer! Below is a list of availability of Norma Shearer films for your viewing pleasure.\n\nComing up on Turner Classic Movies\n\nEscape (1940) ~ April 13th\n\nThe Divorcee (1930) ~ April 14th & June 30th\n\nLady of the Night (1925) ~ April 15th\n\nThe Women (1939) ~ April 21st & May 14th & June 28th\n\nMarie Antoinette (1938) ~ May 5th & June 24th\n\nSmilin' Through (1932) ~ May 14th\n\nRiptide (1934) ~ May 16th\n\nStrangers May Kiss (1931) ~ May 21st\n\nTheir Own Desire (1929) ~ May 21st\n\nRomeo & Juliet (1936) ~ June 28th\n\nAvailable on DVD\n\nAvailable through the new Warner Bros. Archive\n\nI was watching the early talkie Our Blushing Brides (1930) the other day and one particular scene that left an impression on me. Three young ladies, mannequins at a swanky lingerie shop, Gerry (Joan Crawford), Frankie (Dorothy Sebastian), and Connie (Anita Page) are roommates, all still single and despereately poor. The three gals sit down to dinner which consists of canned salmon , bread, potatoes and some over-brewed coffee. Frankie groans at the sight of salmon yet again while Gerry says it can't be all foie gras at the Ritz. All three girls have prospective rich beaus and ruminating about their current situation just shows them how desperately they want an out.\n\nMovies from the Great Depression are filled with scenes like this. I often remember a scene in Gold Diggers of 1933 where the roommates have a breakfast of stale bread and stolen milk. It's enough to make any dame want to be a gold digger. And how!\n\nSo how did people plan meals in the Great Depression? They had to be very creative. Not only did they have to make meals out of what was available but they also had to make do without a lot of basics that we today take for granted. Meals had to be very simple and with few ingredients.\n\nA little while ago I found a series of YouTube videos about Depression-era cooking. A sweet 93-year old woman who lived through the Depression shares her recipes, stories and photographs in little installments called Great Depression Cooking with Clara. They are simply wonderful and I beg you to watch them. Here is one of the episodes:\n\nPoorman's Feast\n\nI decided to make this for my Sunday dinner and here is the result:\n\nThis was a rather inexpensive meal to make. I got a bag of lentils for $2, sandwich steak for $1.92, 1 head of romaine for $1 and a lemon for $0.40. The rice and olive oil I already had in my pantry. In the end, this meal cost me less than $6. The lentils and rice and meat will be my lunch tomorrow, so I got two meals for less than $3 each. Pretty good. Plus it was absolutely delicious!\n\nAttention Vegetarians/Vegans! The rice & lentils are hearty enough that with the salad it's still a full meal. You can always add a simple dessert to round it off.\n\nFor more on classic films and the Great Depression, be sure to check out Katie's excellent post on Obscure Classics. (I swear, I thought of my post before Katie posted hers! Great minds think alike).\n\nSusan Peters (1921-1952) has a soft spot in my heart. I may have been the only one who participated in the 20 Actresses Movie meme to have chosen her as one of my top faves. Susan Peters had a soft, unassuming quality that made her mesmerizing yet approachable. She was a quintessential 1940's beauty with gentle features, glistening eyes and soft pouty lips. She had an aura of innocence, understanding and sadness that intrigues me. She always manages to fascinate me whenever she graced the screen. Susan Peters worked with big names such as Olivia DeHavilland, Gary Cooper, Barbara Stanwyck, Lana Turner, Greer Garson and Ronald Colman yet in her own quiet way was never overshadowed by these brighter stars.\n\nPeters had a short-lived career with various films in the 1940s. She started off with small roles in 1940 and 1941 under her real name Suzanne Carnahan. She switched to the more Hollywood-friendly name of Susan Peters and in 1942 made a formidable impression on the industry in her role in Random Harvest (1942), a role which got her a nomination for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar. This was the first film I had seen her in and I was immediately drawn to her.\n\nThe height of Susan Peter's career was 1942-1944 . Within that time she married film director Richard Quine and folks in the industry saw her as a young star on the rise with lots of potential. She made several films, a few of which got her top billing. In 1944 she filmed Keep Your Powder Dry (1945), a WWII movie about 3 very different young women who join the Women Army Corps (WACS) while the men are off at war. It's a very sweet film about patriotism, love, friendship and self-sacrifice. This just happens to be the favorite of the Susan Peters films I have seen because it showcases her at her most genuine. It also happens to be Susan Peters last hurrah.\n\nShortly after filming ended, Susan Peters became paralyzed from the waist down, an unfortunate result from a hunting accident, and was wheel-chair bound. Peters made one more film The Sign of the Ram (1948), played Elizabeth Barrett Browning in a stage production of The Barretts of Wimpole Street and was in the 1951 TV series Miss Susan. All of these were valiant attempts to keep her career going despite her disability. However, she went into deep depression, her marriage with Richard Quine ended and her contract with MGM was terminated. She died in 1952 of what most people say was a long, slow suicide in which she lost the will to live and succumbed to starvation.\n\nI often think of what she could have been if the accident hadn't happened, but I don't think her life be overshadowed by her tragic demise. It's really her career and wonderful films that should be celebrated. I hope you will watch one of her films if you haven't already. Luckily, there are several opportunities for you to do this.\n\nTurner Classic Movies (US) is showing 5 of her films in the next few months. Here is the line-up.\n\nSanta Fe Trail (1940) - March 25\n\nMeet John Doe (1941) - April 16\n\nDr. Gillespie's New Assistant (1942) - April 28\n\nThe Sign of the Ram (1948) - May 10\n\nRandom Harvest (1942) - June 20\n\nSome of Susan Peter's films are on DVD too.\n\nSanta Fe Trail (1940)\n\nMeet John Doe (1941)\n\nRandom Harvest (1942)\n\nI'm in the middle of a big project right now for this blog, so haven't had time to post (seems counterintuitive doesn't it?). In the meantime, here are few miscellaneous things I wanted to mention.\n\n1) Decades I Love - This is a new networking site for folks like me who love various decades of the past. It's an interactive community that is just starting up. On it you can upload music, photos, videos, etc. and connect with other old souls. Please check it out!

As always, I'm taking this opportunity to remind folks of the wonderful picture book, Footwork which is about the childhood of Fred and his sister Adele Astaire.\n\nPuttin' on the Ritz: Fred Astaire and the Fine Art of Panache\n\nwritten by Peter Levinson\n\n9780312353667\n\n$30.00\n\nSt. Martin's\n\nApril 2009\n\nFred Astaire\n\nIcons of America series\n\nwritten by Joseph Epstein\n\n9780300116953\n\n$22.00\n\nYale University Press\n\nFootwork: The Story of Fred and Adele Astaire\n\nwritten by Roxane Orgill\n\nIllustrated by Stephane Jorisch\n\n9780763621216\n\n$17.99\n\nCandlewick Press\n\n4) Ideal Bite - I've added the Ideal Bite widget to the sidebar. Ideal Bite: A Sassier Shade of Green is a daily newsletter has lots of great tips about how to be more environmentally friendly. I highly suggest you sign up. The widget will update regulary with the latest tip.\n\nI'll be back soon!\n\nThe Sidney Poitier Collection could have easily been called Sophistication in a Box: Sidney Poitier, or Awesomeness Redefined: Sidney Poitier or my personal favorite: Sidney Poitier Therapy, . They could have just put Sidney Poitier's likeness on the box and had no text at all, and people would know they were in for a treat.\n\nReleased during this year's Black History Month, The Sidney Poitier collection highlights this legendary actor in all his glory. Poitier is classy and sophisticated and shines in any role he is given. It is very possible that they could have thrown his worst films in this set and it still would have worked. Instead they assembled a set of 4 gems. This box set contains 4 of his films, 3 of which are new to DVD and all of which are exclusive to the set.\n\nEdge of the City (1957) - Gripping drama about the meaning of friendship. Sidney Poitier plays Tommy, a dock manager who befriends wayward newcomer Axel (John Cassavetes). Axel has a lot of baggage and is trying to get his life back on track by lying about his past. Tommy senses something's wrong and takes Axel under his wing. Their interracial friendship angers increasingly volatile dock manager Charles (Jack Warden). Their friendship is put to the test when it becomes clear Charles wants revenge. This film gets poor reviews, but I thought it was excellent. It's very moving and the final scene is raw and vivid.\n\nA Patch of Blue (1965) - One of my all-time favorite films. Poitier plays journalist Gordon Ralfe, who befriends a young blind woman Selina D'Arcy (Elizabeth Hartmann in her first role). Selina comes from the most dire of circumstances. She has no proper education, no father and her blindness was caused by a cruel accident. She lives in a hovel with her drunk grandfather and hateful mother, Rose (Shelley Winters) who dabbles in prostituion. With Gordon's help, Selina learns the joys of life and becomes more independent, threatening the hold her mother has over her. This one movie is worth the purchase of box set!\n\nSomething of Value (1957) - Two young men, of different races, grow up together in 1940's Nigeria. Soon they both learn, that even their close bond could not prevent the inevitable divide that race, society and religion creates between them. Insulted by a white settler, Kimani (Sidney Poitier) becomes vengeful against the settler and his white friend Peter (Rock Hudson). The final straw comes when Kimani's father is put in prison for performing a tribal ritual. Kimani becomes a member of a violent tribe, Mau Mau and Peter finds himself fighting a war against his friend. This is the first classic film I've seen which actually criticizes white, Christian presence in Africa. The film is violent and difficult to watch, but absolutely necessary!\n\nA Warm December (1973) - Melancholy love story of foreigners abroad. Poitier plays widower Dr. Matt Younger, who takes his daughter Stacey on an extended vacation to England. There he sees Catherine (Esther Anderson), a mysterious and elusive beauty who is being chased along the streets of London by mysterious men. Intrigued by her, he helps her out only to have her slip away. Appearances are deceiving and Dr. Younger gets into more than he's bargained for. This is such a sweet movie yet very sad. I recommend it to anyone who likes a good weepy romance.\n\nPurchasing Links\n\n(Because this would look so HOT in your DVD collection)\n\nBarnes & Noble - Borders - TCM Store - Warner Bros. Home Video Store - Amazon\n\nWhere do you watch movies? When I'm not at the Brattle, Harvard Film Archive or my parent's house (they have digital cable!), I'm lounging on my big red sofa watching films from my entertainment center. I mostly watch Netflix rentals but also have a budding inventory of DVDs. I also have a massive secret collection of taped movies from TCM. I don't have a DVR or TiVo, so I tape on good old-fashioned VHS tapes.\n\nI have always wanted to do a sort of follow-up to my post Work: My Classic Film Nest with an ode to my entertainment center.\n\nHere she is. Isn't she a beaut? You can see my big red sofa from the reflection of the TV. This entertainment center consists of 500+ pieces and I assembled this monstrosity all by myself. It's my crowning achievement.\n\nHere is another look at my television set. Nothing fancy here. No HDTV, Plasma screen or flat-screen. Believe it or not, she is a color TV! I have that at least.\n\nThis is my DVD player which I've had for close to 10 years now. I love the unusual shape because it's cool and it takes up very little room. It's got interchangeable cards so I can make it red, blue or gold whenever I want.\n\nNow here's a peek at my DVD collection. You'll be surprised at some of the films I own. I usually only buy films that I want to watch over and over again like Good News, Pillow Talk and A Patch of Blue. Also, some of these DVDs are presents from friends.\n\nHere is the second shelf. On the right you'll see some earlie Talkies on DVD that my good friend and partner-in-crime Jonas from All Talking! All Singing! All Dancing! sent me!\n\nI had a stereo here before but got rid of it to fill the space with boxed sets, TV collections and music CDs. Unfortunately, now it's quite full and I have 3 new boxed sets to add to it.\n\nHere is the piece de resistance! My secret stash of taped movies. I have hundreds of films in here including my extensive collection of Norma Shearer movies.\n\nCalling all fellow bloggers to participate! What does your entertainment center look like? What films are in your personal collection?\n\n[Participants]\n\nJonas @ All Talking! All Singing! All Dancing!\n\nLaura @ Laura's Miscellaneous Musings\n\nBookyeti - 1st Pic - 2nd Pic - 3rd Pic (Temporary)\n\nKing of Jazz - 1st Pic - 2nd Pic - 3rd Pic (Temporary)\n\nSarah @ Cinema Splendor\n\nCasey @ Noir Girl\n\nKate Gabrielle @ Silents and Talkies\n\nNicole @ Classic Hollywood Nerd\n\nWhen I started the Good Heavens series and came up with my 5 films, my good friend Mark made sure to let me know that there was a film I was over-looking: Pennies from Heaven (1936). At first I thought I'd watch the film, but not write about it. Then I thought, why not cap off the series with a final bonus round? So here it is!\n\nPennies from Heaven is a feel good movie that tugs at the heart strings. It's good ole Great Depression fare. Bing Crosby stars as Larry, a free-spirited wanderer who travels across the country with his 13th-Century lute. He finds himself in jail (a matter of being in the wrong place at the wrong time of course) and serenades a fellow jailer with his lute and beautiful singing voice. The jailer, on his final walk to the execution, thanks Larry and asks that he do him the one favor of delivering a letter to a family in New Jersey. Once Larry is released from prison, being the kind soul he is, he sets out to find the family.\n\nThis is where he gets in trouble of the very best kind. He befriends an orphan girl Patsy (Edith Fellow) and her Gramp, both of whom are destitute and being hounded by social worker Susan (Madge Evans). They go on an adventure, trying to find a situation that will make Susan leave the family alone. They even go as far as taking an abandoned, haunted home and turning it into a Haunted House Cafe complete with special Halloween effects, chicken dinners and live music.\n\nThere are several reasons to watch this film. It's a heart-warming story, Bing Crosby is downright charming and his songs are beautiful. However, the biggest reason to watch this film is Louis Armstrong! Crosby and Armstrong were sort of a musical duo and this is one of their many acts together. Armstrong has a wonderful musical number called \"Skeletons in the Closet\" which is worth the rental of this film alone.\n\nThis film is available on Netflix but the DVD has gone out-of-print since it's release in 2003.\n\nNow I leave you with my favorite Crosby-Armstrong duet for your listening pleasure..."
