        "text": "Norma Shearer was the epitome of ambition. Early in her career, Shearer had disastrous encounters with Broadway producer Florenz Ziegfeld and pioneer film director D.W. Griffith, for whom she appeared in a bit role in his film WAY DOWN EAST (’20). They basically told her that she’d never make it in show business, noting that her figure didn’t fit the ideal standard and the cast in her right eye gave her a slightly cross-eyed appearance. But that wasn’t a deterrent to Shearer. She was a woman in control of her career. Shearer worked with a doctor on manipulating her right eye, she learned how to dress to compliment her figure and she became an expert on how to look best in front of the camera.\n\nShearer soon caught the eye of Louis B. Mayer who put her under contract. She climbed the ranks to become an important player at MGM not by luck or talent but through hard work. She wasn’t satisfied with limited screen time, weak characters and poor lighting. She wanted leading roles, top billing and the best hair, make-up and costumes that a major studio like MGM could provide. She wasn’t destined to be a star. She made herself one.\n\nOver the trajectory of her career, Norma Shearer constantly fought tooth and nail for better and better roles. She went from bit player to leading lady and proved her worth with films that turned into box-office hits. She successfully made the transition from silent to sound with THE TRIAL OF MARY DUGAN and THE LAST OF MRS. CHENEY (both ‘29). Her husband, movie mogul and producer Irving Thalberg, didn’t believe she had what it took to star in the sexually charged pre-Code THE DIVORCEE (’30). Shearer proved him wrong with a glamorous George Hurrell photoshoot that demonstrated she had sex appeal. She went on to star in the film and won the Academy Award for her performance. She was also nominated for her performances in THEIR OWN DESIRE (’29), A FREE SOUL (’31), THE BARRETTS OF WIMPOLE STREET (’34), ROMEO AND JULIET (’34) and MARIE ANTOINETTE (’38).\n\nCritics might point to her advantageous marriage to Thalberg as the sole basis of her success. And while she tended to lean on the powerful men in her life, Shearer didn’t rest on her laurels. She carved a path for herself in the industry. But when Thalberg died at the tender age of 37 in 1936, Shearer not only lost the love of her life but also her biggest champion. She negotiated a six-picture contract with MGM. A few more hits came her way through a variety of “prestige” pictures and her last two box-office hits THE WOMEN (’39) and ESCAPE (’40). She took some time off before making WE WERE DANCING (’42), which was a critical and commercial failure.\n\nUnfortunately, it was around this time that Shearer was making some bad decisions. She turned down plum roles in films like MRS. MINIVER (’42) and NOW, VOYAGER (’42). Her appearance was everything to her, and she did not want to be relegated to playing older women on screen. Now in her 40s, her days of being a romantic leading lady were quickly winding down.\n\nShearer’s next picture, HER CARDBOARD LOVER (’42), would be her last. For the film, she re-teamed with director George Cukor, with whom she had a good professional and personal relationship. The film is just the sort of high society romance she craved, and playing a woman desired by two charming men (George Sanders and Robert Taylor) seemed ideal. But the film was out of touch with contemporary audiences. Cukor later regretted making the film, saying “the plot was already too dated to engage a wartime audience.”\n\nHER CARDBOARD LOVER put the nail in the coffin of Shearer’s acting career, although she wasn’t quite ready to admit to it. The film completed her obligation to MGM, and she informed Louis B. Mayer that she would not renew. A few weeks after the release of the film, Shearer married ski instructor Martin Arrouge and was preparing for a new chapter in her life.\n\nAccording to Shearer biographer Gavin Lambert, “she denied that she had given up on acting and said she would return to the screen if the right part came along.” And a few projects did come her way. Using her strong connections in the industry, she made an attempt to produce a film adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel The Last Tycoon, which was partially based on the life of her husband Thalberg. Several attempts were made, but the project never came to fruition. (It was later adapted in 1976 and directed by Elia Kazan.) According to Lambert, Daniel Lewis of Enterprise Productions was working with Shearer in 1948 on a film project. When the film ARCH OF TRIUMPH (’48) set the company back financially, Shearer’s project was scrapped.\n\nFor a while, Shearer focused her attention on two things: discovering new talent and protecting the legacy of Irving Thalberg. Shearer came upon a picture of Janet Leigh and soon convinced talent agent Lew Wasserman to take a chance on the young woman whom she believed had star potential. For the biopic of Lon Chaney, MAN OF A THOUSAND FACES (‘57), Shearer insisted on casting the actor who would play Thalberg. Shearer spotted a young Robert Evans, who had acted as a child on stage but was then in the clothing business, at the Beverly Hills Hotel where she was currently living. Shearer and her husband Arrouge approached Evans and got him the part, which catapulted the future producer and studio head’s Hollywood career. Gavin Lambert notes that Shearer turned down Normal Lear and Bud Yorkin who were interested in making a biopic on Thalberg. Shearer said, “I do not believe it is something Irving would want and I would never consent to someone else playing me on the screen.”\n\nEven out of the spotlight, Shearer seemed always to be in control of her destiny. She retreated from public life, preferring to spend time with her husband and a close-knit circle of friends. She never did return to acting but left behind a legacy fit for the Queen of MGM."
