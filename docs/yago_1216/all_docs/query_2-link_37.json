        "text": "Often playing spunky, sexually liberated ingénues, Norma Shearer was a Canadian-American film actor of some repute. She was the definition of the exquisite and sophisticated image of womanhood in the 1930s, exploring love and sex with an honesty that would shock most today, but in her day was downright scandalous. She was a six-time Academy Award nominee, winning in 1930. She made it acceptable for the first time to be single not a virgin on screen. She was a chic revolution, but her life was never far from intrigue, and not always for the right reasons…\n\nThe Ferocious One\n\nNorma was born Edith Norma Shearer on August 10th, 1902 in Montreal, Canada. Her life was one of privilege, her father a successful businessperson. But her parent’s marriage was far from bliss. Her father, Andrew, was prone to manic depression and, in Norma’s words, ‘moved like a shadow or a ghost around the house.’ Edith, Norma’s mother, was attractive and flamboyant. Stylish, too. She was Norma’s inspiration to become an actor, something she announced to her family on the occasion of her ninth birthday. Edith supported her daughter however she could, having to take on tremendous responsibility with Andrew’s condition, but the older Norma grew, the more concerned Edith became for her daughter. She was worried Norma’s ‘physical flaws would jeopardise her chances’.\n\nNorma herself described her appearance as ‘dumpy… shoulders too broad, legs too sturdy, hands too blunt.’ She also hated how small her eyes were, but by her own admission, she was ‘ferociously ambitious’ to succeed in life. She saw her supposed ‘deficiencies’ as obstacles that could be overcome through camouflage, charm and, of course, sheer determination.\n\nShe was fascinated by the stage but her relatively happy upbringing was shattered in 1918 when her father’s construction business collapsed. She described her childhood as a ‘pleasant dream’ but it was all over. Her older sister, Athole, suffered a serious mental breakdown. The family was disintegrating. They were forced to move to a dingy, tiny house in Montreal, but the collapse into poverty only worsened as the weeks went by. However, it also served to strengthen Norma’s resolve.\n\nAt an early age, I formed a philosophy about failure. Perhaps an endeavour, like my father’s business, could fail, but that didn’t mean father had failed.\n\n– Norma.\n\nEdith completely disagreed with her daughter’s sunny disposition, leaving her husband behind and moving into a cheap boarding house with her two daughters. Worse for Norma, her mother was inspired to move to New York City so Norma could try her luck in ‘the picture business’. Edith sold Norma’s prized piano (and the family dog) to buy three train tickets to New York City. But it was far from the glitz and glam Edith had hoped for. They were living in the worst part of town in a bleak, one room apartment.\n\nHope felt so very far away.\n\nA New Start\n\nIt was the January of 1920 when the three women arrived in the city, ‘dressed for the occasion’. “I had my hair in little curls,” said Norma. She felt very ambitious and proud. But her heart sank when they saw their apartment. It was a dank hellhole. One double bed. A cot with no mattress. A stove with only one working hob. And a communal bathroom at the end of a long, dimly lit, leaky corridor. And right outside their window, the trains whizzing by on the elevated railway line. This wasn’t living, not really.\n\nNorma auditioned for the Ziegfeld Follies, her name in lights, but only in her dreams. It too was a disaster. Ziegfeld was not impressed with Norma at all. He called her a ‘dog’. She was 18. He called her ‘cross eyed’, too, and criticised her ‘stubby legs’. But Norma’s determination was undiminished. And so she hit the streets, knocking on the doors of the city’s studios trying to find work. And she learnt of an opening at Universal Studios.\n\nI learned that Universal Pictures was looking for eight pretty girls to serve as extras. Athole and I showed up and found 50 girls ahead of us. An assistant casting director walked up and down looking us over. He passed up the first three and picked the fourth. The fifth and sixth were unattractive, but the seventh would do, and so on, down the line until seven had been selected – and he was still some 10 feet ahead of us. I did some quick thinking. I coughed loudly and when the man looked in the direction of the cough, I stood on my tiptoes and smiled right at him. Recognising the awkward ruse to which I’d resorted, he laughed openly and walked over to me and said, ‘You win, Sis. You’re Number Eight’.\n\nShe got the role and soon, other extra parts followed, including ‘Way Down East’, directed by the legend that is DW Griffith. It was then she saw an opportunity. During a break in filming, she positioned herself near a powerful arc light where she introduced herself to Griffith. She told him of her dreams of stardom, but, rather blankly, he told young Norma:\n\nYou’ll never make it.\n\nHe turned solemnly away. But Norma was undeterred. Still. She was committed to working on herself. She would spend hours in front of the mirror, exercising her eyes and striking poses that concealed or improved the ‘flaws’ she had. In desperate need of money, she resorted to modelling work, but it proved successful.\n\nI could smile at a cake of laundry soap as if it were dinner at the Ritz. I posed with a stand of imitation pearls. I posed in dust-cap and house dress with a famous mop, for dental paste and for soft drink, holding my mouth in a whistling pose until it all but froze that way.\n\nShe became a model for a tyre company, depicted seated inside the rim of a tyre smiling at traffic. She was known for her famous smile. She loved to smile! She was determined. Confident. She ignored those who told her ‘no’. She may have been modelling tyres but she felt that, one day, it would all pay off. And, in 1921, a year after her arrival in the city, she received her break.\n\nShe would steal the show.\n\nStealing\n\nThe Stealers. 1921. Norma received fourth billing in this, a b-movie. But it got her noticed. In 1923, she received an offer from Louis B. Mayer Pictures, a studio in Los Angeles. Irving Thalberg had moved to the studio as vice president in 1923 and sent a telegram to Norma’s agent, inviting her to a meeting at the studio. She had suffered hardship in New York City for three years, but now she was in Los Angeles ready to ink a contract with a studio. Her hard work had paid off. For the next six months, she would be earning $250 a week, with options for renewal and a test for a leading role in a major feature: The Wanters.\n\nNorma described herself at the time as ‘dangerously sure’. She was accompanied by her mother but as the train neared Los Angeles, Norma soon realised she would not be getting any special treatment from her new studio. She was dispirited. And so Edith allowed her to hail a taxi. Norma was not feeling confident when she arrived at the Mayer Company the next morning when she met Irving.\n\n[I was] impressed by his air of dispassionate strength, his calm self-possession and the almost black, impenetrable eyes set in a pale olive face.\n\n– Norma.\n\nNorma was unhappy with her first screen test. She hated the lighting, saying that it made her beautiful blue eyes look white, and that the lights, somehow, nearly eliminated her nose. She felt as if she looked hideous. The day after her first screen test, cameraperson Ernest Palmer found Norma frantic and trembling in a hallway. He was struck by her ‘fierce, almost raging disappointment’. Ernest agreed that Norma was poorly treated and so he managed to secure her a second screen test. And the studio was very impressed.\n\nIt seemed a certainty that the lead in ‘The Wanters’ was hers, but the picture’s director objected, deeming Norma to be ‘ugly’. Norma was devastated as she was relegated to a minor role. But she was a tough cookie. She was determined to get a leading role, and nothing would stop her.\n\nMadness\n\n‘Pleasure Mad’. Norma’s next role. “If I didn’t deliver in this picture, I was through.” After a few days of shooting, things were looking bleak for her. She was struggling. The picture’s director complained to Mayer that Norma was giving him nothing. She was summoned to Mayer’s office, fully expecting her acting career to be over.\n\nBut to my surprise, Mr Mayer’s manner was paternal… I told him that the director had shouted at me and frightened me. Nobody had warned me that Mayer was a better actor than any of us, and I was unprepared for what happened next. He staged an alarming outburst, screaming at me, calling me a fool and a coward, accusing me of throwing away my career because I couldn’t get on a with a director. It worked. I became tearful, but obstinate. ‘I’ll show you!’ I said to him. ‘You’ll see!’\n\nIt was the kind of tough love she needed. Mayer was delighted with Norma’s reaction and with that, he went back to being paternal. “That’s what I wanted to hear,” he said. Norma returned to set and dived right into a hefty emotional scene and gave it everything she got. “I took that scene lock, stock and barrel, fur, fins and feathers,” she said. It earned her much respect. And, as a reward, she was cast in six more pictures over the next eight months.\n\nNorma was on her way. And soon she was dating Irving. Her life had taken off. She was in love and her films were a huge success. Norma and Irving would marry in 1927. He was instrumental in her becoming a star. And in 1924, Louis B. Mayer Pictures merged with Metro Pictures and the Samuel Goldwyn Company to form Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer… MGM. Norma was cast in MGM’s very first picture, the wonderfully named, ‘He Who Gets Slapped’.\n\nThe film was a roaring success leading to the meteoric rise of the new studio: MGM. By 1925, Norma was carrying her own films and had become one of MGM’s biggest stars. She was earning $1,000 a week in 1925, but $5,000 a week by 1930, about $400,000 a year in today’s money. She bought a house for herself and her mother. Because it was under the Hollywood sign. And she quite liked the view.\n\nNorma had done it. She was a star.\n\nThe Rise\n\nShe may have been a star but now Norma had to stay a star. That was tough. The life of actresses then was often fleeting. Newcomers such as Greta Garbo were starting to make waves around Norma. In her early days, she had played innocent heroines, but as the silent era gave way to the talkies, her silken voice was found in sophisticated, often daring roles. By 1930, she had become a style icon, her hair fashionably bobbed, back then considered the height of sophistication. Despite this, her crossed-eyes continued to be a problem for some people. It became a touchy subject in the higher echelons of MGM, with one director so crass toward Norma that MGM sent the director to film a western in the Mojave Desert.\n\nNorma and Irving made their first public appearance as a couple in 1925. Only a few weeks later, she was in Montreal to see an old friend. She told her, “I’m madly in love… I hope to marry him… I believe I will.” Norma was now high on the crest of a wave of stardom and fortune. After finishing the production of ‘The Student Prince’, Irving, Norma’s boss, remember, invited her into his office where he presented her with a collection of diamond rings. It was his proposal. You can pick anyone you like, Norma. Predictably, she chose the largest and most expensive one…\n\nThey married in 1927 and went on to have two children. Just one week later, ‘The Jazz Singer’ was released, the first feature-length picture with sound, dramatically changing the cinematic landscape forever. It was the end of the silent era. And with it, the end of many of the careers of actors of the day. But Norma was determined not to be one of them.\n\nHer brother, Douglas, was instrumental in the development of sound at MGM and he prepared Norma for the age of the microphone as best as he could. And, in 1929, ‘The Trial of Mary Dugan’, Norma’s first talkie, was released.\n\nIt was an enormous success.\n\nUnending\n\nHer accent was medium-pitched, fluent and flexible, not quite American, but not all that foreign. What might sound weird today is that her accent was mentioned in quite a few reviews, her accent critically acclaimed. Her accent. Very few silent era stars made the transition as well as Norma. Many other actresses of the day copied Norma’s voice. Despite the popularity of her talkies, however, she feared the public would grow tired of her ‘good girl persona’. And so she took it upon herself to reinvent herself.\n\nShe hired a photographer to take a series of sensual portraits to show herself in a more adult, more sophisticated light. It convinced her husband that she could play the lead in MGM’s new, racy picture: The Divorcee. It won her an Academy Award. Many more successful films followed: Let Us Be Gay (1930), Strangers May Kiss (1931), Private Lives (1931), Strange Interlude (1931) and A Free Soul (1931), with Clark Gable. Norma was, in her day, talked of in the same light as Greta Garbo, Jean Harlow and Joan Crawford. She resented Norma’s power in Hollywood, arguing her marriage to Irving opened certain doors for her that were closed to other actresses. Joan once said:\n\nHow can I compete with Norma when she’s sleeping with the boss?\n\nRegardless, the hits kept coming for Norma. She gave up her Canadian citizenship in 1931 and became an American citizen, the year she starred opposite Clark Gable… a movie in which he had to slap Norma… hard. It shocked audiences. It was the jolt that shook the audiences from their impression of Norma as an innocent young woman. She was harder, now. Almost toughened beyond recognition.\n\nShe moved into prestigious pictures in the mid-1930s, ‘The Barretts of Wimpole Street’ (1934) her most successful. Norma was immensely popular with audiences, nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress on six occasions, winning once. ‘Romeo and Juliet’ (1936) and ‘Marie Antoinette’ (1938) followed. Her style continued to define her. During one party, Norma could not fit through the entrance door because her voluminous skirt was so large, so she had to go through a wider, back door. She also couldn’t sit down so four chairs were arranged so she could sit at the table, her skirt supported.\n\nI found that Norma… is a nervous, highly self-critical woman who has schooled herself to give an impression of self-confidence. If one had accepted that impression, one would have gone far astray in working with her. She needed sympathy and reassurance… she becomes so engrossed in her work, so keyed up with a kind of taut, nervous energy, that she is apt to overtax her strength. She will play a long, exhausting scene over and over again without appearing to lose an atom of her freshness and verve. When it is over she will tell you she feels fine – and believe it. Then she will go to her dressing room and collapse… the greatest joy of working with [Norma] comes from her complete lack of vanity… she will criticise herself with a penetrating, almost unfeminine, impersonal judgment.\n\n– George Cukor.\n\nAs she broadened her appeal, especially her dramatic appeal, her fame grew unimaginably. Her fans adored her and everything she represented. Being slapped in one scene by Clark Gable was just another day in her extraordinary life…\n\nUnexpected\n\nLife was pretty sweet for Norma but her world came crashing down on September 14th, 1936. Irving died of pneumonia at the age of just 37. Norma lost her protector. The love of her life. She was widowed at the age of 34 with two children to care for. For 18 months, she was in seclusion. She may have been at the height of her fame but without Irving, she did not want to make pictures anymore. But MGM were most insistent. They wanted her to sign a six picture deal. Why did she agree to it? Maybe for her children. Irving Junior was six and Katherine was just one. Norma hired a lawyer.\n\nShe wanted to ensure that Irving Senior’s percentages of films on which he had worked were still paid to his estate, something MGM contested. Norma decided to take the story to famed gossip columnist Louella Parsons and with that, MGM caved and granted all the profits from MGM movies made and released from 1924 to 1938, giving Irving Senior’s estate $1.5 million, a lot even now, never mind then. Despite this, MGM still wanted Norma and she made those six pictures, each earning her $150,000. About $3 million in today’s money. That is how much Norma was worth. Almost her weight in gold.\n\nShe had thought of retirement when Irving died, but she made pictures and they were good. ‘The Women’ (1939), an all-star, all-female comedy (with 130 women receiving speaking roles), is regarded as Norma’s greatest performance. Alongside co-stars Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell and Paulette Goddard, it was Norma who shone brightest. Irving had propelled Norma to stardom, but she could stand on her own, no trouble.\n\nDuring this time when Norma began an affair with James Stewart, the James Stewart, six years Norma’s junior, and then the married actor George Raft, although he was separated from his wife. He wanted to marry Norma but George’s wife would not grant him a divorce. MGM head Louis B. Mayer told George he did not approve of the affair. It led to Norma ending things with George for the sake of her career. Norma had many lovers in her life.\n\nRegardless, she remained down-to-earth in these, her later years. Irving had left Norma and the children $4.5 million. But money can vanish very easily. She loved to work and into the late 1930s, she remained as busy as ever.\n\nThe Curtain Call\n\n‘Idiot’s Delight’ (1939) was a dark comedy for Norma to take on, the last of her three films with Clark Gable. She was considered for the role of Scarlett O’Hara in ‘Gone With the Wind’ (1939), along with, it seems, most actresses in Hollywood, but, despite being one of the studio’s preferred choices, Norma had no interest in the role. She joked:\n\nScarlett is a thankless role. The one I’d really like to play is Rhett!\n\nCritics adored the suspenseful atmosphere in her next picture, ‘Escape’ (1940), where she played the lover of a Nazi general who helps an American free his mother from a concentration camp. With the war raging in Europe, the movie did well at the box office, but Norma passed on highly successful films such as, ‘Now, Voyager’ and, ‘Mrs Miniver’ to star in box office flops, ‘We Were Dancing’ (1942) and, ‘Her Cardboard Lover’ (1942). Without Irving, her choice of roles sometimes faltered. With that, in 1942, she retired for good.\n\nIn that year, 40-year-old Norma married 28-year-old ski instructor Martin Arrougé. Norma decided to retire somewhat from public life, but she did make the occasional public appearance. But the older she got, the more she withdrew from the social scene of Hollywood. She declined many, many offers to make a comeback, preferring her fans to remember her as she was. Plus, she was rich so she didn’t need the money.\n\nMiss Shearer does not want any publicity. She doesn’t talk to anyone. But I can tell you that she has refused many requests to appear in motion pictures and TV shows.\n\n– Norma’s secretary (1960).\n\nIt is a shame Norma was forgotten by the time of her death. On June 12th, 1983, she died of bronchial pneumonia at the age of 80. She is entombed in the Great Mausoleum at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California, in a crypt marked, ‘Norma Arrougé’, alongside her first husband, Irving. What a career she had. Her Academy Award in 1930 only scratches the surface of the life of one of the most iconic actresses who ever lived.\n\nSince her death, her work has experienced a revival and for it, she has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She was, by her own admission, ‘ferociously ambitious’, but her determination and persistence led to a glittering career in the movies. Her pictures depicted rich and worldly women, enriched by what was then considered racy, and this is how she is remembered today. But it was her hard work and charm that defined her.\n\nShe was a leading star of MGM and became known as, ‘The First Lady of MGM’, easily making the transition from the silent era to the talkies. Even her brother Douglas won an Academy Award, making Norma and Douglas the first Oscar-winning brother and sister. Norma shedded her ‘good girl’ persona to take on high stakes, sexually liberated roles, which won her rich acclaim.\n\nWhilst she may not be remembered as so many of her contemporaries have been, her career is being re-evaluated. Norma is, today, starting to gain the recognition she had when she was alive as one of the feminist pioneers of cinema. On screen, and in real life, she made it popular to be a new woman, to make it chic and acceptable not to be a virgin.\n\nIt is why she was and remains so inspirational. Because she was something new.\n\nEven for a pampered star, her output in the sound era is strikingly meagre. And yet this was part of her undeniable aura – that she did not make movies lightly and frivolously, but with great care, sincerity and conviction.\n\n– Andrew Sarris (American film critic).\n\nToodle-Pip :}{:\n\nPost LG: Comments, Likes & Follows Greatly Appreciated :)\n\nImages (click on them to enlarge): 1) Norma Shearer, 2) One of Norma's 'sensual' photos, 3) Norma and Irving.
