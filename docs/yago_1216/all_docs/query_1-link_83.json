        "text": "Mary Pickford Theater\n\n2023 Archive of Screened Films\n\nPre-Code Double Bill\n\nThursday, December 14 at 7:00 p.m.\n\nLOOSE ANKLES (First National, 1930). Directed by Ted Wilde. Continuity and dialogue by Gene Towne, from the play of the same name by Sam Janney. With Loretta Young, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Louise Fazenda, Otis Harlan, Daphne Pollard, Edward Nugent. (69 min, black & white, 35mm, preserved in 2015 from duplicate picture and track negatives in the United Artists Collection).\n\nWith\n\nUNION DEPOT (First National, 1932). Directed by Alfred E. Green. Screenplay by Kenyon Nicholson and Walter De Leon, from the unpublished play of the same name by Joe Laurie, Jr., Gene Fowler and Douglas Durkin. With Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Joan Blondell, Guy Kibbee, Alan Hale, David Landau. (67 min, black & white, 35mm, preserved in 1995 from duplicate picture and track negatives in the United Artists Collection)\n\nA pair of fast paced, witty and racy pre-Code gems. Loose Ankles stars seventeen year old Loretta Young as a wealthy heiress who decides to create a scandal in order to deprive her greedy relatives of her late grandfathers fortune. To do so, she decides to compromise herself with a \"young, handsome and unscrupulous\" man. In \"Union Depot,\" a Depression Era ensemble piece set during a single night in a large metropolitan train station, the main protagonist is the massive station set constructed on the Warners lot that would be reused in a number of the studios subsequent productions. The creepy sexual predator pursuing Joan Blondells chorus girl would have undoubtedly ended up on the cutting room floor if the film had been made two years later, when the enforcement of the Production Code began in earnest.\n\nThursday, November 30 at 7:00 p.m.\n\nPLANET OF THE APES (Apjac / Twentieth Century-Fox, 1968). Directed by Franklin J. Schaffner. Screenplay by Michael Wilson and Rod Serling, based on the novel of the same name by Pierre Boulle. With Charlton Heston, Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter, Maurice Evans, James Whitmore, James Daly. (112 min, DeLuxe Color, Panavision, archival print from the Twentieth Century-Fox Collection).\n\nA team of astronauts crash-land on an unknown planet and find that it is ruled by apes, with humans relegated to the status of lowly animals. One of the most profitable and popular science fiction films of the 1960s, Planet of the Apes spawned four sequels, two TV series, and a host of toys, games, trading cards and other merchandising items. While its science is suspect, the films statements on totalitarianism, religion, bigotry, and nuclear war make it a fascinating reflection of the turbulent era when it was made. Above all, however, it is the visuals that impress, both Leon Shamroys widescreen cinematography (most of the filming was done in Utah and Arizona) and the exceptional makeup designed by John Chambers, which enabled the actors playing the apes to create memorable, fully-fleshed characters. Selected for the National Film Registry in 2001.\n\nSci-Fi on the National Film Registry\n\nThursday, November 9 at 7:00 p.m.\n\nINVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (Walter Wanger Pictures / Allied Artists, 1956). Directed by Don Siegel. Screenplay by Daniel Mainwaring, from the story \"The Body Snatchers\" by Jack Finney, serialized in Colliers magazine (Nov-Dec 1954). With Kevin McCarthy, Dana Wynter, Larry Gates, King Donovan, Carolyn Jones, Jean Willes. (80 min, black & white, SuperScope, 35mm, archival print from the BBC Archives Collection).\n\nIn a small town in California, the local doctor discovers that the population is being taken over by alien pods. Made as a low-budget B movie (it was shot in 19 days), \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" has over the years acquired the status of a classic, often referred to as a product of the Cold War and reflection of Americas fear of Communists  some even interpret it as a covert response to the House Committee on Un-American Activities. Even if one finds the political connotations speculative, the film can certainly be perceived as social criticism, as indicated by Don Siegels own words: \"I am sorry to say I have kissed many pods To be a pod means you have no passion, no empathy, you talk automatically. The spark of life has left you.\" Selected for the National Film Registry in 1994.\n\nThursday, October 19 at 7:00 p.m.\n\nCREEPSHOW (Laurel Show / Warner Bros., 1982). Directed by George A. Romero. Written by Stephen King. With Hal Holbrook, Adrienne Barbeau, Fritz Weaver, Leslie Nielsen, Carrie Nye, E.G. Marshall, Viveca Lindfors, Ed Harris, Ted Danson, Stephen King. (120 min, color, 35mm, archival print from the Copyright Collection).\n\nTwo masters of the horror genre, filmmaker George A. Romero (Night of the Living Dead) and author Stephen King, joined forces to make this stylish anthology film conceived as an homage to the 1950s EC horror comics. The film consists of five creepy tales, three original pieces and two adapted by King from his own short stories (\"Weeds\" and \"The Crate\"), and its visual style, including optical effects, animation, colored lighting, and painted backgrounds, effectively mimics the look and feel of comic books. \"Creepshow\" was Romeros first mainstream work, with \"name\" actors, a budget much bigger than he ever worked with, and Warner Bros. picking the film up for distribution after its successful showing at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival market.\n\nThursday, October 5 at 7:00 p.m.\n\nCORNERED (RKO, 1945). Directed by Edward Dmytryk. Screenplay by John Paxton; story and adaptation by John Wexley. With Dick Powell, Walter Slezak, Micheline Cheirel, Nina Vale, Morris Carnovsky, Luther Adler. (102 min, black & white, 35mm, archival print from the Copyright Collection).\n\nA former P.O.W. investigates the murder of his bride, a member of the French Resistance. His quest takes him from London to France, then Switzerland, and finally to Buenos Aires. A quintessential film noir, Cornered was made by the creative team responsible for the previous years \"Murder, My Sweet.\" Dick Powell, who played Raymond Chandlers detective Philip Marlowe in the earlier film, here portrays another tough, cynical, and distrustful individual, doggedly pursuing revenge in a world both psychologically and physically devastated by war. Following close on the heels of \"Murder, My Sweet,\" \"Cornered\" completed Powells remarkable transformation from romantic lead in musicals to hardboiled tough guy.\n\nThursday, September 14 at 7:00 p.m.\n\nPAGE MISS GLORY (Cosmopolitan / Warner Bros., 1935). Directed by Mervyn LeRoy. Screenplay by Delmer Daves and Robert Lord, based on the play of the same name by Joseph Shrank and Philip Dunning. With Marion Davies, Pat OBrien, Dick Powell, Mary Astor, Frank McHugh, Lyle Talbot. (93 min, black & white, 35mm, preserved in 2015 from the original picture & track negatives in the United Artists Collection).\n\nTwo con men create a composite photo of the most beautiful girl in Hollywood and recruit a hotel chambermaid to play the role. \"Page Miss Glory\" was Marion Daviess first film after a 14-month hiatus and her first for Warner Bros., the studio having purchased the play specifically for the actress following William Randolph Hearsts decision to relocate his production unit, Cosmopolitan Productions, from MGM to Warner. The move was partially influenced by MGMs refusal to cast Davies in \"The Barretts of Wimpole Street\" (see June 22). Unfortunately for Davies, by now in her mid-thirties, Warner repeatedly miscast her in the roles of much younger women, and with audiences and critics turning their backs on the star, she retired from acting in 1937.\n\nLemmon - Matthau--Part II\n\nThursday, August 17 at 7:00 p.m.\n\nTHE FRONT PAGE (Universal, 1974). Directed by Billy Wilder. Screenplay by Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond, from the play of the same name by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur. With Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Susan Sarandon, Vincent Gardenia, David Wayne, Allen Garfield, Austin Pendleton, Charles Durning, Carol Burnett. (105 min, Technicolor, Panavision, 35mm, archival print from the Copyright Collection)\n\nA newspaper editor tricks his ace reporter into covering one more story before he quits to get married. Hecht and MacArthurs play opened on Broadway in 1928 and received its first film adaptation three years later under the helm of Lewis Milestone. Following Howard Hawks gender swapping version (His Girl Friday), it took nearly 35 years for \"The Front Page\" to return to the big screen. It is not difficult to see Billy Wilder and the pairing of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as the ideal combination to bring the plays feverish pace and its wisecracking, rapid-fire dialogue to life, and the film, full of witty retorts and memorable supporting characters, goes a long way to prove that. Unfortunately, The Front Page was neither a critical nor commercial success, having been released at a time when American cinema was rapidly moving away from Wilders character and dialogue driven style harking back to the screwball comedies of the 1930s.\n\nLemmon - Matthau--Part I\n\nThursday, July 20 at 7:00 p.m.\n\nTHE FORTUNE COOKIE (Phalanx  Jalem / United Artists, 1966). Directed by Billy Wilder. Screenplay by Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond. With Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ron Rich, Cliff Osmond, Judi West. (125 min, black & white, 35mm, archival print from the Copyright Collection).\n\nAfter he is injured when a football player runs into him during a game, a TV cameraman is persuaded by a shyster lawyer, who is also his brother-in-law, to make a bundle of money by suing everyone involved in the incident. The film that launched Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon as a comedy duo, \"The Fortune Cookie\" was the first of eight features the two would make together over the next twenty-two years. For Billy Wilder, it was a return to the morality of \"Double Indemnity\" and \"Ace in the Hole,\" albeit in comedic form, with characters who are either enablers or victims of a society riddled with avarice and corruption.\n\nThursday, June 22 at 7:00 p.m.\n\nTHE BARRETTS OF WIMPOLE STREET (MGM, 1934). Directed by Sidney Franklin. Screenplay by Ernest Vajda, Claudine West, and David Ogden Stewart, from the play of the same name by Rudolf Besier. With Norma Shearer, Fredric March, Charles Laughton, Maureen OSullivan, Katharine Alexander, Ralph Forbes. (110 min, black & white, 35mm, archival print from the Turner Entertainment Co. Collection).\n\nMGMs customary lush treatment of the real-life romance between poets Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning was based on a popular play which premiered in England in 1930 before moving to Broadway a year later. Marion Davies was initially considered for the female lead at the urging of her husband William Randolph Hearst, but the role eventually went to Norma Shearer, the wife of the studios head of production Irving Thalberg. Charles Laughton was borrowed from Paramount for the role of Barretts tyrannical father, and his brilliant performance belies the fact that he was only 35 years old when he made the film. Laughtons characters incestuous fascination with his daughter, overtly suggested in the original play, was inevitably removed in the screen adaptation, although Laughton famously told Thalberg, \"They cannot censor the gleam in my eye.\"\n\nThursday, June 1, 2023, 6:00pm - 9:30pm at 7:00 p.m.\n\nLive! At The Library: \"The Making of the Best Years of Our Lives\" (1946)\n\nAlison Macor, author of \"Making The Best Years of Our Lives: The Hollywood Classic That Inspired a Nation\", will introduce a screening of the 1946 Academy Award-winning masterpiece included among the first 25 films named to the Librarys National Film Registry.\n\nMacor will discuss the films tumultuous journey from script to screen against the backdrop of a nation struggling to deal with its walking wounded. An award-winning author and former film professor, Macor received a Public Scholars grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to write \"Making Best Years\", which \"ineaste\" recently praised as giving \"the certified masterpiece the treatment it deservesintelligent, sensitive, and respectful.\"\n\nThis film earned the producer Samuel Goldwyn his only Best Picture Academy Award. It offered the injured director, William Wyler, a triumphant postwar return to Hollywood. And for Harold Russell, a double amputee who shared the screen with movie stars Fredric March and Dana Andrews, the film provided a surprising second act.\n\nSean Connery Tribute\n\nThursday, May 4 at 7:00 p.m.\n\nTHE FRIGHTENED CITY (Zodiac Productions, U.K., 1961). Directed by John Lemont. Screenplay by Leigh Vance, from an original story by Vance and John Lemont. With Herbert Lom, John Gregson, Sean Connery, Alfred Marks, Yvonne Romaine. (97 min, black & white, 35mm, archival print from the Copyright Collection).\n\nA crooked accountant forms a crime syndicate by merging the most influential gangs of Londons West End. Former truck driver, bodybuilder, soccer player, and artists model, the Scottish-born Sean Connery made his stage debut in 1953 and four years later appeared in his first film role. \"The Frightened City,\" in which he plays an Irish protection racket enforcer, is considered Connerys best pre-Bond part. In the words of author Michael Feeney Callan, \"everything Connery had filched, stumbled upon and been taught in six years of acting was piled in ideally concentrated measure into The Frightened City.\" The following year, Sean Connery would star as British Secret Service agent 007 in \"Dr. No,\" and the rest is history.\n\nThursday, May 25 at 7:00 p.m.\n\nTHE ANDERSON TAPES (Robert M. Weitman Productions / Columbia, 1971). Directed by Sidney Lumet. Screenplay by Frank R. Pierson, from the novel of the same name by Lawrence Sanders. With Sean Connery, Dyan Cannon, Martin Balsam, Ralph Meeker, Alan King, Christopher Walken. (99 min, Technicolor, 35mm, archival print from the Copyright Collection).\n\nA safe-cracker freshly released from prison plans an audacious heist of an entire apartment building. Released less than a year and a half before the unraveling of the Watergate scandal, \"The Anderson Tapes\" was prophetic in its focus on the omnipresent electronic surveillance, underlined by the authenticity of the technology displayed on screen (video recorders and cameras were provided by Ampex). The film was a resounding success, proving Sean Connerys bankability outside of the James Bond franchise, and although he agreed to resume the Bond role in one more picture (Diamonds Are Forever, 1972), it was to be his last. Christopher Walken, in his first major role, plays the electronics expert known only as \"The Kid.\"\n\nThursday, April 13th at 7:00 p.m.\n\nSIMON AND LAURA (Group Film Productions, U.K., 1955). Directed by Muriel Box. Screenplay by Peter Blackmore, based on the play by Alan Melville. With Peter Finch, Kay Kendall, Muriel Pavlow, Hubert Gregg, Maurice Denham, Ian Carmichael. (91 min, Technicolor, 35mm).\n\nA pair of squabbling stage actors on the cusp of divorce are hired to feature in a TV soap opera about a happily married couple. A witty satire of the then booming medium of television, \"Simon and Laura\" is an exemplary introduction to the work of Muriel Box, Britains most prolific female director. A forgotten pioneer, Box directed fourteen films from 1949 to 1964 and wrote nearly twice as many screenplays (often in collaboration with her husband and producer Sydney Box), an output without peer for a woman working in the male dominated realm of post-World War II commercial cinema. Archival print from the Librarys Copyright Collection.\n\nThursday, March 16th at 6:30 p.m.\n\nTHE MALTESE FALCON (Warner Bros., 1941). Directed by John Huston. Screenplay by John Huston, from the novel of the same name by Dashiell Hammett. With Humphrey Bogart, Mary Astor, Gladys George, Peter Lorre, Barton MacLane, Lee Patrick, Sydney Greenstreet. (100 min, black & white, 35mm).\n\nA private eye, his murdered partner, a priceless statue and a coterie of deceitful characters are the main ingredients of this seminal film noir, the first to introduce the Bogart persona that turned an already well-known actor into a Hollywood icon. Making his directorial debut, John Huston closely followed the structure and hard-boiled dialogue of Hammetts novel, first published in 1929-30 in serialized form in the pulp magazine \"Black Mask.\" A truly canonical work presented in a pristine 35mm print generated by the Packard Campus Film Preservation Lab from the original nitrate negatives in the United Artists Collection. Selected for the National Film Registry in 1989."
