        "text": "Due to popular demand, the Hollywood Heritage Museum exhibit “A Free Soul: The Life & Unexpected Legacy of Norma Shearer – The Queen of the MGM Lot” has been extended through Sunday, Nov. 5.\n\nCurator Darin Barnes will give a gallery talk on Saturday, Oct. 14 at 11 a.m., to add insights into Norma Shearer’s life and legacy, including a look at the many properties she is associated with, the reasons why she defied the odds to become a major movie star and how she helped give others a leg up in life and the industry. Some Shearer family members are expected to attend.\n\nItems in the exhibit include domestic and international film posters, personal and professional photos (including a rare picture of Irving Thalberg as a little boy), studio promotional items made for Shearer’s films, costumes, one of Shearer’s compacts, studio contracts, her unpublished autobiography, a display of George Hurrell photos of Norma and much more.\n\nOn the occasion of the centennial of Shearer (“The Women”) signing her first film contract, Hollywood Heritage celebrates one of Hollywood’s greatest stars. In the 1930s she rose to become one of the biggest names at the studio, second only to Greta Garbo. In 1927 she even married the studio’s Golden Boy, executive Irving Thalberg (his name is still known due to the Academy’s annual award in his name). She won a Best Actress Oscar for her role in the pre-code pot-boiler, “The Divorcee” (1930).\n\nThe exhibit is in the Main Gallery as well as the Jack Oakie and Victoria Horne Gallery. Hollywood Heritage Museum is located at 2100 N. Highland Ave. For information, visit hollywoodheritage.org."
