Apparently, her dress took over 3,000 hours to make. But it seems like it was worth every single second to make it.\n\nNikki Reed\n\nIt's not often that two stars from different vampire-themed film and TV franchises come together in real life, but that's exactly what happened with Nikki Reed and Ian Somerhalder. Both actors had prominent roles in the \"Twilight\" series and \"The Vampire Diaries,\" respectively, and it seemed inevitable that they would eventually cross paths.\n\nWhen they tied the knot, Nikki looked stunning in a boho-inspired gown by Claire Pettibone.

It's only befitting that the King of Rock 'n Roll took his partner all the way to Las Vegas and got married on May 1, 1967.\n\nThey held their ceremony at the Aladdin Hotel, which is where they recited their vows. As it turns out, Priscilla designed her own dress! Now isn't that impressive?! Her dress was made with silk chiffon and adorned in seed pearls.

Unfortunately, the two can only look back on the wedding day as a fading memory as they have since gone their separate ways.\n\nKeira Knightley\n\nKeira Knightley and James Righton chose a low-key wedding ceremony with just 11 guests in the South of France, proving that sometimes, simple is best.
