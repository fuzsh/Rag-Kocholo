The bulk of the material relates to Thalberg, with only a few folders concerning Shearer's career and family. The Thalberg material and correspondence contains information about his finances and his business relationship with MGM executive Louis B. Mayer. Of interest are drafts of a letter Thalberg wrote to Nicholas Schenck in 1933 analyzing why MGM was successful while he was in charge of production for the company and arguing against the plan to take away that authority."
