        "text": "You can't force audiences to love actors and watch their movies, even Irving Thalberg couldn't accomplish that, and audiences loved Norma Shearer. She was immensely popular from her ingenue days in the last silent pictures to the end of the 1930s, when she voluntarily retired rather than age into matrons and grandmothers. And 10 years at the top is a long time for any Hollywood actress.\n\nNot every actress could be as beautiful as Greta Garbo or even Joan Crawford and the female audience appreciated seeing a woman like Norma, with less than stellar looks, succeed and win over Clark Gable or Robert Taylor or Tyrone Power or whoever. Her acting may have been somewhat affected and seem dated now, but it was a style that was actually admired far more than a more realistic approach in a decade when millions wanted to escape the sad realism of the depression and the horrors of the oncoming world war.\n\nCan you tell? I'm a big fan.\n\nThe secret of her success? Drive and persistence and ego. Her co-star Robert Morley said \"How did YOU get to be a movie star?\" and she said \"Because I wanted to!\" She played down her flaws (thick figure, a \"cast\" in one eye) and played up her assets (her patrician profile) and made herself into a star. It didn't hurt that she was married to the head of production at MGM studios, the \"boy wonder\" Irving Thalberg. She got him through drive and persistence, too. She was always available to him; whenever he needed a date, she was there. Finally, he married her. Gavin Lambert said \"she kept trying out for the role until she got it.\" They made a big show of being lovey-dovey but their relationship was more of a working arrangement than a love story. After he died she went on with her life but could never let go of being Mrs. Irving Thalberg, the Queen of the MGM lot. She died in the Motion Picture home (she was not there due to lack of money; she just needed to be in a care facility), blind, her mind gone. When she had male visitors she'd ask them \"Are you Irving? Were we married?\" In her mind, she was still back in those days when she had, in her words, \"the very most of life.\"\n\n[quote] At any rate, she realized that without her \"mentor\" Thalberg, she was now consigned to do mothers and matrons, so she simply retired with a boytoy, Thalberg's MGM riches, and happily lived the life of a Hollywood Icon.\n\nShe didn't \"happily live the life of a Hollywood Icon.\" She never got over not being being married to the boy wonder producer Irving Thalberg , she never got over not being Queen of the MGM Lot. Oh, I'm sure she had some good times with her boytoy second husband, but he was a poor substitute for the glory of being Mrs. Irving Thalberg. Aging distressed her; she became more and more reclusive. She had no interest in her children at all. She was so concerned about still being thought of as a star that she threatened to sue the producer's of the film \"That's Entertainment!\" because it featured her in a reaction shot. She thought being shown in mere reaction shot reduced her to the status of a \"bit player.\" She was not a happy woman. It was a long, slow fade out.\n\nThe actress Virginia Bruce was in the Motion Picture home with her. She said this of Norma Shearer:\n\n\"The biggest of them all, and here she is blind and dying, after all that, all that fame and riches and now this. Maybe I haven't had it so tough.\"\n\nBeing a huge star as well as the widow Thalberg and a major stockholder at MGM, I wonder why Norma didn't negotiate a contract with Mayer where for a non-astronomical salary Norma couldn't have re-upped her contract and done one prestige film a year? Basically that was all she acted in anyway. She had her looks and talent and clout. If she had wanted to continue on as a current movie star I imagine she could have.\n\nWith her decreasing box office appeal I think what Norma saw was her audience evaporating, which must have been terrifying. Norma had turned down Mayer's offer of the lead in \"Mrs. Miniver\" and instead chose to do a remake of the gloppy and tired \"Her Cardboard Lover\" which flopped badly. On top of everything else her taste in projects that would be successful had fled. Maybe she got out at just the right time after all?\n\nThalberg knew the roles that fit her style and personality. Once he was gone, there was no one to exercise that kind of care.\n\nIt's difficult to talk about a 30s acting styles---there were people who came over from silents and often were a big exaggerated, people from the stage who who often seemed well, stage-y and often a bit mannered, and people like Spencer Tracy or Pat O'Brien who were quite natural and unaffected. There also was the issue of getting used to sound and microphones which were new to the silent stars and stage people. By the time, things settled into something that was less stilted than the stage or silents, but not quite natural, you had the beginning of \"The Method\" with people like John Garfield. MGM had some contract players like Tracy who were rather natural in their style, but it was easily the studio that presented the stiffest entertainment--they really wrecked the Marx Brothers and wouldn't have known what to do with Mae West.\n\nShearer is is meant to be the proper lady in \"The Women\", so she is a bit stiffer than the other characters, some of whom are meant to be comic relief, but she's also clearly not as natural as Paulette Goddard who had little stage or silent er baggage..\n\n[quote] Garbo and Crawford were both maniac muff divers. I wonder why they never hooked up.\n\nActually, there's little evidence that suggests Garbo was a \"maniac\" anything, much less a \"muff diver.\" She was not a sexual person at all, despite being a screen goddess. Of course all her life both men and women lusted after her but she seemed not to care. The art curator Sam Green became a friend of hers; one day they were on a walk and stopped to look inside a sex shop. Garbo was amused by it but seemed detached from it. She said 'Ah, the sex thing...I'm glad that part of my life is over.\"\n\nAs for Joan Crawford, well, she was one of those uber-sluts. Bette Davis said she'd affairs but was in Crawford's league. She hadn't had as many affairs as Crawford \"but outside of a cathouse who has?\" As for her being a lesbian...I guess she did do some of that. In \"Hollywood Babylon II\" there are lesbian nudie photos that are supposedly of Crawford and another woman. And in \"Mommie Dearest\" Christiana said a drunken Joan once invited a woman who worked for her to \"sleep\" with her in her room (the woman declined). And there that ridiculous tale of Joan Crawford getting her pussy eaten by Marilyn Monroe, Monroe was supposedly such a good cunt eater that Joan screamed in ecstasy. Joan wanted more but for Marilyn it was a one night stand and that was it, and Joan hated her ever after. I don't believe THAT one for a minute. But I think that if Joan did any lesbian sex she just dabbled in it. She was really, really into cock.\n\nJean Harlow was like Marilyn Monroe and very few other talents. She embodied sex but as a natural-appearing phenomenon, fulfilling specific fantasies of young womanhood of her time, but not being confined by them, accepting but fighting them both. Marilyn lived longer and was more abused, although Harlow contended with plenty. They both attracted smart, older men and were attracted by them. Sometimes it was the line readings that were off or idiosyncratic that astounded the viewer the most. And of course the image of the blonde - the dumb and not-so-dumb man magnet - that they both used to turn the tables on men, at least in their movies.\n\nShearer? God, no. Crawford? She did what she could in a wild, desperate way, but lacked the candor and vulnerability. Garbo was an exotic and strange in her allurements. Kay Francis was not in the same league, appealing as she was. Maybe Clara Bow at her best came close, but her material never really matched the kind of maturity that some of Harlow's and Monroe's vehicles managed. Harlow was unique, and often imitated. Even the persona of Monroe owed a lot to Harlow.\n\nJean Harlow deserves a good biopic. Her life was certainly dramatic enough to produce an interesting film; separated from her father at an early age, plagued by a possessive, clinging mother and a sleazy, oily stepfather (she had to financially support both of them), teenage marriage to a young rich boy that didn't last because of her mother's interference. Although not particularly wanting to (it was more at the mother's insistence) she tried out for parts in movies and gets them due to her unique white blonde hair and sex appeal. She became one of Hollywood's biggest stars. Although a terrible actress at first, she soon becomes much better due to the mentorship of one of MGM's top executives, Paul Bern. Because he loves her for her \"mind\" she marries the much older Bern. They're only married for a short time before he commits suicide; his suicide is a mystery that's debated to this day. Harlow's life with her mother and stepfather is so unbearable that she starts drinking to excess. She finds true love with William Powell (another much older man) but he won't marry her because he doesn't want to be married to a blonde sex goddess again (he'd been married to Carole Lombard and the marriage failed). He also couldn't stand the mother and the stepfather. It hurt her terribly that he wouldn't marry her, but they remained together anyway. He probably would have eventually married her if she had lived; she died at the age of 26, slowly and horribly, from kidney disease. What a life! If somebody could do it right, the life of Jean Harlow could make one hell of a movie.\n\nSo died in 1987:\n\nIrving Thalberg Jr. was educated at a military school, a public school, and at Le Rosey near Rolle, Switzerland. He began to study philosophy at Stanford University, served in the army, and then returned to Stanford, where he married fellow student Suzanne McCormick in 1956. After teaching at various schools, he and his family moved to Chicago, and in 1965 he joined the philosophy department of the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle (UIC). Irving and Suzanne had three daughters, Shoshana, Deborah, and Elana. Suzanne taught philosophy at the University of Chicago. Irving and Suzanne divorced in 1971. During his tenure at UIC, Irving Jr. wrote three books and seventy articles on philosophy. He later married an anthropology instructor named Deborah Pellow. A universally respected scholar, Irving Thalberg Jr. died of cancer on August 21, 1987.\n\nDaughter died in 2006:\n\nKatharine Thalberg was educated at the Westlake School for Girls. She married an Olympic skier named Jack Reddish in 1954, when she was eighteen, and continued her studies at Vassar, Stanford, and UCLA, earning a degree in English literature. Her second marriage was to actor Richard Anderson, with whom she had three daughters, Ashley, Brooke, and Deva. After moving to Aspen, Colorado, she opened the popular Explore Bookstore, and later married businessman Bill Stirling. After years as a pillar of the community and a respected animal-rights activist, Katharine Thalberg died of cancer on January 5, 2006.\n\nFrom Robert Wagner's autobiography:\n\n“The first movie star I met was Norma Shearer. I was eight years old at the time and going to school with Irving Thalberg Jr. His father, the longtime production chief at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, devoted a large part of his creative life to making Norma a star, and he succeeded splendidly. Unfortunately, Thalberg had died suddenly in 1936, and his wife's career had begun to slowly deflate. Just like kids everywhere else, Hollywood kids had playdates at each other's houses, and one day I went to the Thalberg house in Santa Monica, where Irving Sr. had died eighteen months before. Norma was in bed, where, I was given to understand, she spent quite a bit of time so that on those occasions when she worked or went out in public she would look as rested as possible. She was making Marie Antoinette at the time, and to see her in the flesh was overwhelming. She very kindly autographed a picture for me, which I still have: \"To Cadet Wagner, with my very best wishes. Norma Shearer.\" Years later I would be with her and Martin Arrouge, her second husband, at Sun Valley. No matter who the nominal hostess was, Norma was always the queen, and no matter what time the party was to begin, Norma was always late, because she would sit for hours—hours!—to do her makeup, then make the grand entrance. She was always and forever the star. She had to be that way, really, because she became a star by force of will—hers and Thalberg's. Better-looking on the screen than in life, Norma Shearer was certainly not a beauty on the level of Paulette Goddard, who didn't need makeup, didn't need anything. Paulette could simply toss her hair and walk out the front door, and strong men grew weak in the knees. Norma found the perfect husband in Martin. He was a lovely man, a really fine athlete—Martin was a superb skier—and totally devoted to her. In the circles they moved in, there were always backbiting comments when a woman married a younger man—\" the stud ski instructor,\" that sort of thing. But Martin, who was twelve years younger than Norma and was indeed a ski instructor, never acknowledged any of that and was a thorough gentleman all his life. He had a superficial facial resemblance to Irving Thalberg, but Thalberg had a rheumatic heart and was a thin, nonathletic kind of man—intellectually vital, but physically weak. Martin was just the opposite—strong and virile, with a high energy level. Coming after years of being married to Thalberg and having to worry about his health, Martin must have been a delicious change for Norma.”\n\nRalston became fluent in English. The problem was that she couldn't shake off that thick Czech accent. Also, Yates too often cast her in damsel in distress roles. If you read about her life, she was no helpless damsel in distress. When cast in a role where she could be lively such as Dakota with John Wayne, or Jublilee Trail, she had some sort of screen presence and life, and could chew the scenery in her way. But audiences never took to her. Her only films that made much of a profit were the two times Yates cast her in John Wayne movies, and even those didn't make as much as usual. Eventually Yates, in his quest to make Ralston a big star, bankrupted Republic. He was devoted to her for years he bought ads in the trade papers with the latest still of Ralston boasting she was the beautiful woman in movies. She looked good from certain angles, but from other angles she looked dowdy. I find her and her story quite interesting. 15 plus years of being promoted as the next great star and queen of a studio that was at its best making no nonsense action-adventure and western pictures. Just bizarre.\n\nThe filmmakers approached Greta Garbo, but she was not interested. Wilder contacted Pola Negri by telephone, but had a difficult time understanding her heavy Polish accent. He then reached out to Clara Bow, the famed IT Girl of the 1920s, but she declined citing that she had no interest in engaging in the film industry again due to how hard it was for her during the transition of sound films and that she'd prefer to remain in seclusion with her husband and sons while leaving her previous life behind her. They also offered the part of Norma Desmond to Norma Shearer, but she rejected the role due to both her retirement and distaste for the script. They were considering Fred MacMurray to play opposite her as Joe. Wilder and Brackett then visited Mary Pickford, but before even discussing the plot with her, Wilder realized she would consider a role involving an affair with a man half her age an insult, so they departed. They had considered pairing Montgomery Clift with her.[11]\n\n\"Credible\" and \"more sympathetic,\" indeed.\n\nR453, in displaying a fundamental ignorance of what \"Sunset Boulevard\" was intended to be and is, while proudly misunderstanding its theme AND its careful characterizations, this poster deserves a big, sticky, brown \"Oh, dear\" for camp-as-black-social-satire illiteracy.\n\nSwanson's performance is the core of Wilder's and Brackett's indictment of the Hollywood studio system still being tinseled and celebrated at the time of the film's release. There's a reason Mayer shouted at Wilder at the theater after its premiere, and reason why Wilder called back, \"Fuck you\" to Mayer.\n\nSwanson's job in this horror movie (which it was meant to be, with the cut scene of dead Gillis with other corpses in the morgue talking to each other at the very start, to the \"monkey\" funeral and the wheezing organ and the dead house of relics and the \"wax museum\" card game - Keaton was himself personally stung by how the scene affected him - and the rest) probably is the best in the history of mainstream American cinema. She was exactly what was scripted and directed for. And there's no MARY appropriate after that statement. And I'm not that crazy about her off the screen.\n\nBrave, deadly as a garrote, informed by personal history, and self-immolating and self-revealing in an almost ghastly way. She loathed Chaplin and did him perfectly in \"pantomime.\" She encouraged scenes from her disaster \"Queen Kelly\" in the horrid home-movie viewing. She treated Von Stroheim's character like a slave, and he had directed her in that and other movies. She - and De Mille - did the spotlight-at-the-studio scene as an autopsy, and De Mille's voice cracked as he ordered his team to drop the contacts about renting her car.\n\nGo back to our beloved schlock and the simpering patronization of all those \"women's movies\" and musicals and bios. I enjoy them. But no one but Swanson could have done Norma. The actresses who were considered or claimed to be considered were all-too-much examples of what the film was getting at to play it. Shearer, who took her money and her hot new young husband and ran, avoided their fate by having another life. She would have had no understanding, sympathy or craft to attempt to play something as far from her league as the Yankees have been from Vassar Resolutes of 1932. And she would have known it. And I like Shearer, for all of her three-note range.\n\nBy the way, Shearer's marriage to Arrouge was very happy. They were completely devoted to each other, and he gave her a life they both enjoyed. There are plenty of stories from their social set commenting how great and fun they were. Even Robert Wagner devoted time in his autobiography to them.\n\n\"Credible.\" Christ. I'm deleting that word from my vocabulary for such idiocy.\n\n\"Sunset Boulevard\" is a condemnation of the fickle nature of fame and aging, especially for women. It could also be a treatise on the cruelty of technology and modernization, as that what puts Norma out to pasture years before age does. Norma has long been a relic at barely fifty, which adds such cruelty to her dilemma. She isn't really even old years after having been shunted aside and all but forgotten.\n\n[quote]She would have been more sympathetic than Gloria who resorted to pantomime and Grand Guignol .\n\nOnly in the stupid Broadway musical, or on Carol Burnett's parody versions is this true. Swanson's performance is subtle and acutely observed. Her Norma does go mad, but in degrees before our eyes. She is a very sympathetic character almost throughout, a cunning and worthy adversary to her plight until her obsession with Joe tips her into madness. Norma is actually well-dressed and quite pretty for a woman of fifty, but we never remember her that way, it's odd.\n\n\"Idiot's Delight\" received rave reviews from the film critics at the time with the NY Times critic referring to it as one of the \"...year's events...\" in their review on February 3, 1939.\n\nShearer's record after she returned to the screen following her husband's death, was enviable. Four big hits in a row and an Oscar nomination as Best Actress for one of them. Under her new contract she got to pick her roles and was not assigned parts by the studio. She chose the least showy role in \"The Women\", knowing she could do it and that she would probably be upstaged by some of the other characters.\n\nShe blamed only herself for the final 2 films that she chose to star in (\"We Were Dancing\" and \"Her Cardboard Lover\").\n\n[quote] \"Norma wouldn't take off her wedding ring, even while shooting films.....check it out! It is MASSIVE! Good job Irving!\"\n\nThis is how Irving Thalberg proposed to Norma Shearer. He called her into his office; on his desk was a tray of engagement rings. I don't think he said \"Will you marry me?\" or anything; I guess he thought the tray of rings said it all. She supposedly \"smiled and chose a ring.\" The one she chose was a slender platinum band with a large (not sure how large but it was big) marquise shaped diamond. On her wedding night with Thalberg she went to bed wearing Cartier bracelets. Supposedly she tried to get them off but neither she nor Thalberg could undo the clasps so they \"tumbled into the marriage bed\" with her expensive jewels still on her wrist. In a scene near the end of \"The Women\" she's in bed about to turn in for the night, wearing jeweled bracelets. I though it was silly; nobody goes to bed wearing showy bracelets. Well, I guess she really did.\n\n[quote] Wow, the Thalberg Wikipedia entry is a mile long - he seems to have really accomplished an extraordinary amount, learning on the job as he went.\n\nBecause of a heart ailment Thalberg was not expected to live beyond the age of 30. He died at age 37. I guess because he knew his life expectancy would be short he tried to cram as much productiveness into his life as possible. He was constantly working. He probably would have lived longer if he hadn't done a stupid thing. He was playing bridge with some friends on a terrace and the day was cool and breezy. Norma suggested he put on a sweater or that the group move inside. Not wishing to seem delicate and sickly, he dismissed her concerns. Due to his weak constitution he shortly contracted pneumonia and died.\n\nI thought Irving Thalberg was attractive in quite a few of his photos but people who knew commented on how unwell he looked. He didn't do himself any favors by not getting enough sleep and driving himself so hard. But nobody could tell him what to do. Despite his appearance he had a very commanding personality and people deferred to him.\n\n[quote] I'd love to read a sincerely well-researched bio. Can you recommend one of the ones you trust.\n\nThere's a good one by Gavin Lambert simply entitled \"Norma Shearer.\" He DID know her and her second husband (Thalberg was long gone by that time). He's obviously a fan but it's not one of those biographies where the author is in love with (or hates) his subject. I'd say anyone who wants to know about her should read it.\n\nI don't think it was \"affection\" for Thalberg that made her grip the arms of male visitors and ask them \"Are you Irving? Were we married?\" It's just that her deteriorating mind keep reaching back for the period of her life where she had what she called \"the most of life\", that time when she was \"The Queen of the Lot\", married to Irving Thalberg, Head of Production at MGM studios. She wished to be with Thalberg at the end, so her faithful second husband carried out her wishes, interring her beside Thalberg in his marble pavilion. Lambert said:\n\n\"\"The funeral service at Forest Lawn was private, but but then he publicly gave back his wife to Irving Thalberg and to the legend that an old, blind, haunted woman held onto as powerfully as she as she gripped the arm of anyone who could still connect her to it. Norma was interred beside her first husband in his marble pavilion and as she requested the inscription commemorated both her lives> Nest to Irving Grant Thalberg lies Norma Shearer Arrouge.\""
