        "text": "Born of German immigrant parents, Thalberg suffered from a weak heart and was plagued with health problems all his life. Told by doctors he wouldn’t live past 30, the frail but highly intelligent and ambitious Thalberg lived and worked with an extraordinary intensity. He graduated from high school and worked for two years in the New York offices of Universal Pictures before going to Hollywood as the secretary to the company president, Carl Laemmle. At age 21 Thalberg became Universal’s studio manager.\n\nWhen MGM was formed four years later, he was hired as the head of production with full authority to reedit any film. He shrewdly ascertained public taste and tightly controlled the studio’s output by supervising the selection of scripts, their revision, and the final editing of the films. The literary flavour of MGM’s products, e.g., The Barretts of Wimpole Street (1934), Mutiny on the Bounty (1935), Romeo and Juliet (1936), and Camille (1937), stemmed mainly from Thalberg’s influence. With Naughty Marietta (1935) he initiated a long series of successful musicals starring Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. About the same time, he helped revive the Marx Brothers’ careers by producing two of their best comedies, A Night at the Opera (1935) and A Day at the Races (1937). Thalberg also acted as a liaison between the businessmen who controlled MGM’s finances and the studio’s directors. He supported the star system and discovered and developed many of MGM’s popular screen personalities, including his wife, actress Norma Shearer, whose career Thalberg directed."
