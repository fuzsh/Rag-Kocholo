        "text": "Yes, R4, yours is the standard DL opinion on NS, and I respect it --but I disagree strongly. I\n\nThe first time I saw her onscreen, my eyes were drawn to her immediately, and I always am more interested in what her face is doing than I am in what her scene partners are doing, even when she hasn't any dialogue.\n\nFeel the same about Miss Barbara Stanwyck.\n\nNorma, George Raft, and Judy:\n\nUmmm...my family is about as \"straight\" as it gets - the whole lot of them in fact - and everyone, EVERYONE knows the name Joan Crawford. Whether or not they have ever seen her on film or even know what she looked like even is in debate, but her name is really up there from a Hollywood perspective. I think that \"Mommie Dearest\" played a big role in this, but almost everyone knows the name Joan Crawford and almost no one has ever heard of some old actress who was called Norma Shearer. This has nothing to do with being gay - Joan has been mentioned in so many films and TV shows by so many big actors and personalities over the years - her name is hard to escape. This is no reflection on talent, looks, etc. but it is the truth for most.\n\nR38 - yes, Crawford was a flapper early on and well. a slasher at the end, but at least from 1932, with best picture Grand Hotel to at least 1952 (oscar nomination for Sudden Fear) she had, regardless of what one might think of her talent, a prestigious career. Short it ain't.\n\nAs for Shearer - there is something about her which reminds me of Nicole Kidman. While they are different in style and persona (KIdman is cold while Shearer had a rather warm presence - I'll give her that), for me both are not actors but posers - they seem to meticulously configure what an actor is supposed to do in any given situation and do their best to replicate it. It's artificial acting, resulting in a facsimile of a real performance.\n\nher father gave his secretary a fur coat for Christmas and her mother demanded a divorce. The actress was a year older than Shirley Temple, a year younger than Jane Withers. She could remember lines. On her third day in Los Angeles, her mother took her to a casting call, where she met Judy Garland and got her first role.\n\nUpon signing a contract at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the actress became a player in Louis B. Mayer’s stable. “If you worked for Mr. Mayer, you didn’t just lollygag,” she says. “I was loaned out to everybody. ‘Altruistic’ would not describe him. If you were under contract to him, you were like a piece of chattel. You were supposed to bow and scrape and curtsy. Mr. Mayer was, in his own mind, godlike.” In the course of the next thirteen years, she appeared in a hundred and ten films, alongside Greta Garbo, Myrna Loy, Merle Oberon—as the little-girl version of all the big-name stars. Bette Davis was the first person to send her flowers. Lana Turner, her babysitter, taught her to tweeze her brows. Harry Ruskin, one of M-G-M’s most prolific writers, made her his protégée, supplying her with books and instructing her in his view of the world. She never went to school.\n\nOne day, when she was around six, as she remembers it, she and her mother were waiting to see Mayer. The door to his office opened, revealing a woman, with her back to them, shouting at Mayer, “Don’t tell me! I fucked every one of you bastards on the way up.” The woman turned around: it was Norma Shearer, who was married to Irving Thalberg, Mayer’s partner at M-G-M. That was the first time the young actress heard the word “fuck.” Later, in Mayer’s office, she asked him what it meant. She didn’t get her answer right away.\n\nWhen she turned sixteen, she recalls, Ruskin invited her to his office for lunch—a normal occurrence, as he hosted a lunch-hour salon with people who amused him, and she often went. On this day, no one else was invited. He handed her a synopsis with a part written specifically for her. “Right there came the proposition,” she says. “Just frank. Just out. I was the typical battered wife—I thought I had done something, that I had been provocative or dressed provocatively or done something to instigate this. Because why would he do this? It was like incest to me.”\n\nShe left Ruskin’s office and found a broom closet to weep in. “I felt myself coming unglued,” she says. “My mother never permitted me to cry, unless I was being paid for it.” When she had composed herself, she went upstairs to Mayer’s office. “He said, ‘Have you seen Harry?’ I said, ‘Yes, but’—he wouldn’t let me say anything. ‘Have you read the synopsis?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Don’t you love it?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘We have your favorite producer, your favorite cinematographer,’ and so forth. Finally, I got a word in. I said, ‘But, Mr. Mayer, do you know what Harry wants me to do?’ By this time I was in a chair. He was a little man, and he definitely had a Napoleonic complex, because he had huge overstuffed furniture. I was in a great big black leather chair over in a corner. He was behind this enormous square desk, and he came around, sat on the arm of the chair, put his arm on my shoulder, pulled me toward him, and said, ‘You’ll get used to it.’ ”\n\nShe wouldn’t. She went home and burned all her films, photographs, scripts, and memorabilia. Her mother didn’t believe her, and implored her to apologize to Ruskin for hurting his feelings. When Mayer realized that she was serious about refusing to play along, he threatened to destroy her career: wagging his finger under her nose, he said she’d never work on a soundstage again. “Mr. Mayer,” she said, “that is my heartfelt desire.” She confided in her friends Lucille Ball and Ava Gardner, who were not surprised. “They said he was a rat bastard, but the more you stir you-know-what, the more it smells,” she says. “Their advice was, Live with it, get over it, let it go, just let it go.”\n\nThe actress is ninety now, vibrant and witty, a favorite of the waiters in Beverly Hills. She wears heels and trim leather blazers and pencils her eyebrows. (Thanks to Miss Turner, they never grew back.) After telling me her story—a story she has not told her children, because it still fills her with shame—she paused, then said, “Does that answer all your questions about that epoch, how different it is not? It’s not a bit different than today.”\n\nWhen I was in my late teens and early 20's, in the 70's, I regularly saw Norma and her husband walking around Beverly Hills or at a restaurant called Nibblers. She was always gracious and would say hello. They seemed very happy and would often hold hands at their table. (This was more than 30 years after they'd married). I love some of her work including \"Barretts\", \"Marie Antoinette\", \"The Women\" and \"Escape\" in particular.\n\nAlthough not always successful, she stretched herself frequently. She tackled Eugene O'Neill (\"Strange Interlude\"), Noel Coward (\"Private Lives\") and even Shakespeare (\"Romeo and Juliet\"). I cannot think of another actress at Metro that could have played Mary in \"The Women\" as well as she does. One has only to see the 1956 remake to understand that any issues people have with it are the part as written and not the player.\n\nLike Deanna Durbin, I give her credit for walking away and not looking back and living out a mostly happy life until the latter years when health issues tormented her. Reportedly she holds the record for most Best Actress Oscar nominations in a single decade (6).\n\nI first saw The Women in 1973 in an old revival house on Broadway near Lincoln Center when I was in my early 20s. I'd barely heard of Norma until then but was absolutely besotted by her Mary Haines, even though that cast was filled with familiar actresses like Crawford, Roz Russell, Joan Fontaine, Paulette Goddard and Marjorie Main....all of whom I knew through either their other old films on TV or seeing them on TV talk shows. But I really wondered: how had I missed out on Norma until then?\n\nThen, right around that time That's Entertainment premiered and Norma appeared very briefly in a scene from Idiot's Delight (\"Ah, this will be amusing, Gentil!\") as she observed Clark Gable tap dancing with a bunch of chorines. And once again I was so taken with this major star but puzzled that I knew nothing about her.\n\nWhich only goes to prove that somehow her rep had not been sustained in the 30 or so years since her retirement, and certainly has only diminished further since then. I don't why, but her major films Marie Antoinette, Rome and Juliet, Strange Interlude, The Barretts of Wimpole Street, Escape and even The Women and Idiot's Delight were just never shown on all those local stations that constantly played old film classics.\n\nAnd there were no scandals or gossip or big romances post-retirement that would have made her newsworthy. No noteworthy bios of her or even much about Irving Thalberg. Jean Harlow had that smutty attention-getting biography and the 2 wretched bio-films in the 1960s and, of course, there were always notorious sightings in NYC of Garbo window shopping until she died in 1990.\n\nAnyway, just trying to rationalize why one of the biggest stars of the 1930s is not remembered.......\n\nI've always been a Shearer admirer for her being able to accomplish so much in films against so many odds.\n\nShe readily acknowledged her physical imperfections, including a cast in one eye, short bow legs and stubby fingers, and worked hard at disguising them on the screen, with the help of MGM technicians. Once, the British character actor Robert Morley, who played opposite her in Marie Antoinette, asked her, not meaning to be unkind, \"How in the world did you become a movie star?\" She replied, \"Because I wanted to.\"\n\nNorma retired after she was asked to play mothers with grown children. She refused to grow old on the screen, which is a pity because she had at least another 10 years of stardom in her. She turned down MGM's Mrs. Miniver, a role in which Greer Garson won an Oscar, and Bette Davis' personal request to co-star in Old Acquaintance at Warner Bros. (Davis had to accept rival Miriam Hopkins instead). Alfred Hitchcock was also a fan, years later making the statement about the lack of true Hollywood leading ladies with the quote, \"Where are the Norma Shearers?\"\n\nI’m glad there’s finally a Norma appreciation thread. She was an amazing actress and a great star. She could do almost anything on screen from Shakespeare to Coward. From Pre-codes to romance to costume dramas to comedies. She was the most versatile Star of any era. Davis and Garbo couldn’t do Shakespeare, Crawford and Stanwick couldn’t do costume. dramas. Hepburn couldn’t do sexy. Norma had it all and she was “Queen Of The Lot” at the grandest of all the studios. I think the fact that she lived quietly without scandal and that her films weren’t shown regularly made her fade from view. Even Streisand as big a star as she was at one time wouldn’t be recognized by a lot of the younger people today. I think it’s time for a biography of Norma and the only actress capable of capturing her would be Patricia Clarkson who looks a lot like Norma. Norma Shearer was the hardest working actress in films was the only one that managed not to be typecast because of the variety of her roles. They will never be another Norma.\n\n[quote]I've always been a Shearer admirer for her being able to accomplish so much in films against so many odds.\n\nOkay. She was Mrs Irving Thalberg. So this is a total inversion of reality.\n\n[quote]She readily acknowledged her physical imperfections, including a cast in one eye, short bow legs and stubby fingers, and worked hard at disguising them on the screen, with the help of MGM technicians. Once, the British character actor Robert Morley, who played opposite her in Marie Antoinette, asked her, not meaning to be unkind, \"How in the world did you become a movie star?\" She replied, \"Because I wanted to.\"\n\nOkay. This is why she isn't as good as Davis, who instead of covering up her physical shortcomings to play a mid-thirties Juliet, she actually embraced them and sought roles where she could challenge her audience. She was in her stride when Shearer retired.\n\nShe had a film career before marrying Thalberg, which is amazing because she really wasn't a great actress and was really rather plain looking. But she had an incredible drive to be a star. Her co-star Robert Morley said to her \"how did YOU get to be a movie star?\" and she said \"Because I wanted to!\" She did everything she could to make herself look more attractive; positioning herself in such a way as to minimize the \"cast\" in her eye, wearing costumes (Gilbert Adrian really helped her in this respect) that hid her thick figure and using photographers (George Hurrell was a favorite) who could make her look more glamorous and sexy. But nothing much helped her acting; Shearer is and was violently loathed by many film writers. Pauline Kael declared her acting “dreadful.” David Thomson called her “fluttery, chilly and more nearly vacant than any other goddess.” But in some of her movies she did well by the role, although she was prone to mannerisms that one critic called \"bad-acting spasms\", like her \"full frontal, hands up, arms out, head tilt pose.\"\n\nShe had a career but she didn't become \"Queen of the Lot\" until she married Irving Thalberg, head of production at MGM, the industry's \"Boy Wonder.\" They made a big show about being \"in love\" but their union was more of a working arrangement than a great love match. Anyway, she was in her element as Mrs. Irving Thalberg and relished her position Her ego was monumental. At a annual motion picture event called the Mayfair Club Ball, the hostess Carole Lombard asked all the ladies to come wearing white. Norma Shearer arrived wearing strapless and backless scarlet, just like Bette Davis did as the spoiled, entitled Southern belle she played in \"Jezebel.\"\n\nAfter Thalberg's death, she did a few more movies of varying quality (Marie Antoinette, The Women, Her Cardboard Lover) but soon retired. She had a thing about her age; she thought that turning 40 was the end and she didn't want people to see her aging. She remarried to a ski instructor 12 years her junior; he was devoted to her and they stayed married until her death. Mental illness ran in her family; her sister was a schizophrenic. Shearer went the same \"way\" as her sister. She became progressively more and more deranged and was losing her eyesight and finally she was placed in the motion picture old folk's home. If a male visitor came to see her she'd ask \"Are you Irving? Were we married?\" The actress Virginia Bruce was also living in the motion picture home. She had this to say about Norma Shearer: \"The biggest of them all, and here she is blind and dying, after all that, all that fame and riches and now this. Maybe I haven't had it so tough.\" <\n\nIt needs to be said that she did have a period when she was a genuine movie star when the public really did respond to her. They loved her to see her as \"the classy dame,\" the society beauty in clinging satin about to abandon herself to sin.\n\nLater, she got the prestige roles where she gave so little pleasure to anyone; but to be fair, they needed someone to fill those roles, and Joan Crawford wasn't going to do it. Crawford desperately wanted to make the segue to prestige roles and held out hope towards the end of her contract with metro they would let her play Marie Curie. The ludicrousness of that possibility should be evident to anyone who has seen the movie that did get made with Greer Garson. Garson was a lot like Shearer: she wasn't really a great actress, but she was believable as a great lady, and [italic]someone[/italic] had to play Madame Curie and Mrs. Miniver. And it wasn't going to be Crawford.\n\nMGM kept its leading ladies in particular niches. in the 1930s, Garbo was the European woman of mystery. Shearer was the grand dame who took on the prestige roles. Myrna Loy was the perfect wife/companion, Harlow the wisecracking comedienne. Crawford's appeal was playing common girls who struggled against the odds - she had an underlying sexuality that Shearer lost in the post-Code era. Though Crawford may have seen herself in competition with Shearer, they were really two different MGM 'brands.'\n\nWhat is interesting to me is how, as their 1930s stars aged out, MGM successfully replaced them with new equivalents for the 40s: Garson took Shearer's place as the resident grand dame, Lana Turner replaced Crawford as the common girl with sex appeal; Hedy Lamarr was likely intended to replace Garbo, though she never had the allure of Garbo - and the loss of the European market in WWII kept her from establishing a fan base there. Lucille Ball eventually took over the Harlow franchise. Katherine Hepburn, while not exactly replacing Loy, became part of an equally popular team. Even the top MGM musical team of the 30s, MacDonald and Eddy, were supplanted by the younger and more popular-focused Garland and Rooney.\n\nBut they didn't have to replace their male stars in the same way -- Gable, Tracy, Robert Taylor, Jimmy Stewart all continued on as before (except for their war service).\n\nr256 here. I did not mean to say Crawford only played one type of role, but that is what she did most successfully. She was crazy ambitious at the height of her Metro career - even took voice lessons in an attempt to be an operatic singer - and fought hard for more varied roles. But they were never as successful as her tried and true melodramas. She did not have a talent for sophisticated comedy, and the few that she did fall flat. Her Gorgeous Hussy was an attempt to do a historical drama, but it was a failure and she looked ridiculous in those 19th century sausage curls. Susan and God works pretty well, but Crawford looks as though she is giving a scene by scene impersonation of G. Lawrence. She learned from her mistakes and when she reinvented herself at Warners, she didn't fool around with any roles that did not suit her.\n\nShearer, for all her limitations, managed to bridge a number of varied roles and genres, and yes, while she did seem ludicrous playing a teenaged Juliet to a middle-aged Romeo, the overall production quality and Cukor's direction made it work surprisingly well. As she hit 40, she faced the same aging problem that many female stars had - Kay Francis, Ruth Chatterton, Marion Davies to name a few. Shearer was wise to take her money and enjoy a comfortable retirement. She'd had the career she always wanted.\n\nOn the other hand, Crawford, Davis, Stanwyck. Dietrich and Claudette Colbert forged on well into old age.\n\n[quote]r265 I wonder why Crawford wasn't obsessed by a rivalry with Jean Harlow as she was with Shearer? It would seem to me that Crawford and Harlow would be the two at MGM competing for the same roles.\n\nShe did feel in competition with Harlow...but then, they ALL felt in competition with each other, for just about everything. The studio also encouraged this, as the fear of the other actresses pulling ahead made them show up for work on projects they might otherwise decline.\n\nCrawford did tell one woman (I don't remember if it was a performer or a writer) that she couldn't be friends with both Harlow and herself. And the studio got Crawford to do DANCING LADY by pretending they really wanted Harlow.\n\nI see a lot of posters on this thread saying that NS left gracefully, but I think people admire BD and JC and all the others because this was for them a profession and a life-long calling. JC may not have been the best actress, but I think the old timers thought of themselves as artists (or believed that they should be artistic in their approach)--and if they became old and ugly, well then, they would bring old and ugly characters to life for their audiences. And also, the studio life was a kind of a community--they all worked many hours for many years with the same directors, lighting people, technicians, etc. BD talks about her lifelong friends in the movie community (in her book); I'm sure others felt the same way.\n\nIn case anyone else is interested--\n\n[quote] Thalberg also aggressively pursued a more lucrative compensation package throughout his tenure at MGM. With the 1924 MGM merger, Thalberg’s yearly salary was $33,800 ($431,000 in 2010 USD), plus a very lucrative 4 percent of MGM profits, based upon a minimum production order of fifteen films per year. A little more than a year later, after protracted negotiations with Schenck, Mayer, and the New York office, his yearly base salary was increased to $104,000 ($1.3 million in 2010 USD)—a clear affirmation of his value to MGM. For the next seven years, Thalberg would make annual demands for salary increases as well as a more lucrative profit-sharing agreement. While Mayer and Schenck met his demands, tensions grew. Over time, this financial wrangling as well as disparate personalities and increasingly divergent personal and professional goals undermined Mayer and Thalberg’s once close and harmonious partnership. While Thalberg remained focused on producing a slate of impressive films and MGM’s day-to-day operations, Mayer prioritized maintaining the favor of MGM’s New York office and securing national political power. And what Mayer and Schenck could give, they could also take away, given their power and status in the MGM corporate hierarchy. Ultimately Thalberg was their employee and a producer with an important title that could (and ultimately would) be taken away.\n\n[quote]r323 Do you think Adrian had to show Shearer and Crawford what the other one was wearing in their scenes together?\n\nIt always bothers me that Joan Crawford doesn't look better playing the homewrecker in THE WOMEN. Her acting's fine and she's well cast, personality wise, but I always thought the part should be played by a real physical knockout ... more like Veronica Lake. Someone whose obvious beauty and sex appeal would immediately make a wife feel very, very nervous.\n\nPart of the problem is that short, curly hairstyle Crawford wears, which has hardly ever looked good on anyone. But apparently hairdresser Sydney Guilaroff gave her that as a way to cut corners, time wise. He had all those other female stars to look after on the film, and that short style could be done fairly quickly. But I don't think it looks very good (though maybe it did to a 1939 audience)\n\n\"Shearer ended up a mentally ill crazy person who couldn't remember anything. How embarrassing!\"\n\nShe remembered one thing: being the wife of Irving Thalberg. She would call her husband \"Irving\" and when her memory was mostly gone, it still kept going back to \"Irving.\" Any male visitor that came to see her in her twilight years could only get out of her things like \"Are you Irving? Were we married?' That was her identity in life, being the wife of Irving Thalberg and the Queen of the MGM lot. At an award ceremony for Louis Mayer, she spoke a few words, saying that he had given her \"the happiest days of my life, the days which brought me the very most of life.\" She meant the MGM days when she was a big star and the wife of Irving G. Thalberg. \"The public confrontation with the past\" seemed to have rattled her and she never attended any ceremony connected with the movies again, turning down invitations to the Academy Awards and film festivals. She seemed to want to turn her back on her life as \"Norma Shearer\" and be content being Mrs. Marti Arrouge, but it was evident to friends that she always \"suffered very much from not being in the limelight.\" She could have continued to act, but thought it \"humiliating\" to do character roles. So even though her movie career was over she still maintained the image of being an MGM star and even allowed (or prefered) people to call her Mrs. Thalberg.\n\nWhen That's Entertainment (the original one) was completed in 1974, producer Jack Haley, Jr. arranged a special screening for Norma Shearer to view the film, as she was, of course, the former Queen of the Lot and still a major stockholder in the company. Since she'd never appeared in any musicals, he was particularly pleased that he was able to showcase Norma in a short scene from Idiot's Delght, reacting to Clark Gable hoofing with some chorus girls to \"Puttin' on the Ritz\" in a section about non-musical stars who were coerced into singing and dancing onscreen.\n\nAlthough the couple of shots of her are quite charming and she's absolutely scintillating in those brief moments, she was apparently horrified and insulted that she would be shown in a film purporting to be a history of MGM as a mere footnote.\n\nSad, as she is so memorable and that appearance certainly made me seek out all of her films.\n\nI had a friend from first grade through our 20s who overcame crossed eyes. She was a very pretty little girl, dark curly hair and pretty face. Even the crossed eyes and glasses didn't detract much. Over the years her eyes straightened out, maybe with the help of surgery, I don't know. She always had a very direct look to her gaze, like Norma Shearer. Maybe it was from constantly trying to control that wandering eye. As an adult my friend still had that intense, direct gaze, and she was still very pretty.\n\nMy niece and grand niece were both born with casts to their eyes. They wore glasses as children but both grew out of it without surgery. Glasses and eye muscle exercises, I guess, and they are both stunning beauties.\n\nLots of even relatively contemporary actors don't seem to make sense---Tom Cruise as anything besides a male ingenue is puzzling but he's gotten away with it for years. Being a \"star\" can be a different quality than being a compenent actor, and in the old days, studio contract players were expected to play \"everything from giants to children\" and made embarrassing pics. Stars often comport to standards of beauty that can quickly become dated---50s/60s beehives, faux fros in the 70s, etc. Some people start as stars and become actors with experience---Paul Newman is a good example. Some people at least try--Michelle Pfeiffer fits this, whereas Julia Roberts usually has stayed in her lane. Loretta Young, among others, does not seem like a great beauty now and Shearers cross-eyed appearence seems wierd. OTOH, Shearer was able to make the transition to talkies--she wasn't a bug-eyed exaggerator in the silent era and a had a pleasant voice, so she made the switch successfully. Beause she had worked in silents, she wasn't quite as \"stage-y\" as people who came to Hollywood from Broadway, even as she had to act out stage-y dialog. Thalberg was careful to craft her image and kept her from embrassing herself. The usual run of contract players including bignames like Davis, Bogart, etc. made lots of drek---the old tea time movies on UHF channles were veritable showcases for all that, but its now more or less forgotten.\n\n\"Well his first wife was middle aged and when Cukor was asked about having a relationship with Gable when Gable was allegedly a hustler Cukor refused to discuss it.\"\n\nHis first marriage was a career move. The old bag had money and he didn't; she helped get his career started, and that was why he married her. As for Cukor...well, Gable never had a liking for him. Its damn hard to believe that Gable ever was a \"hustler\" servicing men, and the rumor has never been proven. I think if Cukor \"didn't discuss it\" it because it never happened. By the way, the Gable as hustler rumor can be found in one of Kenneth Anger's gossip tomes and it's well know how credible HE is.\n\nIf Lombard said that Gable \"wasn't a great lay\" it seems understandable. Women were constantly throwing themselves at Gable and he didn't have to make any effort to pursue them. I guess he figured he didn't have to try too hard in bed; the women would just keep on coming, so to speak. And they did! He never lost his appeal, even as an older man.\n\nYou can catch Norma's cameo in \"That's Entertainment\" on TCM tonight at 8:00 p.m. She was furious they used her reaction shot to Gable's clumsy but funny dance routine and called Paul Rosenfield, a studio executive insisting they delete her reaction shots because she didn't want to be in the sequence at all. It was too late for that. She didn't go to see the movie but wrote Rosenfield about the insignificant clips\" and the \"great humiliation\" it caused her:\n\n\"I am presented as no more than an extra without screen credit while others who are dancers and singers perform triumphantly as stars of this production.\"\n\nShe proceeded to tell Rosenfield off, reminding him of her importance to MGM, of the clause in her contract that gave her top billing and warning that if MGM misused a scene from one of her pictures in this way again she would take legal action. He told her MGM was legally within its rights to use all the clips in the movie and none had been used without its authorization. He told her her name was mentioned in the narration and offerer to arrange a screening of the film to prove \"that it in no way does it damage or detract from your great reputation as an MGM star.\" She thanked him for the offer but refused it:\n\n\"I would be devastated to see myself as such an insignificant part of the whole...it is a little too late to do anything now except to express to you my wounded pride.\"\n\nWell. It that an egotistical diva or what? At any rate, I hope a lot of people will watch \"That's Entertainment!\" tonight to see what so upset Norma; a movie clip featuring her reaction shots.\n\nGable looked older because he was , like many male stars of his era, a heavy smoker and drinker. His drinking increased after Carole Lombard's death. Not exactly in great shape, he foolishly agreed to star in a movie with Marilyn Monroe (he did it for the big paycheck), who was notorious for being hell to work with due to her chronic lateness and inability to remember her lines. \"The Misfits\" was shot in Nevada in temperatures frequently above 100 degrees and the production dragged on and on due to Monroe's mental problems. The stress of the situation did Gable no good, and neither did his insistence on doing his own strenuous movie stunts, like being dragged 400 feet across a dry lake bed at more than 30 miles per hour. All this took a toll on him, and he died shortly after the filming ended. He was buried beside the great love of his life, Carole Lombard.\n\n\"are you sure of that?\n\nI swear I've seen photos of her with some work done. Now I have to look for it.\"\n\nIn the biography \"Norma Shearer\" by Gavin Lambert, a friend of Norma's named Liliane Montevecchi said that Norma spoke openly about her \"terror of aging.\" She exercised fiercely to keep her body in shape but didn't have any plastic surgery. Montevecchi said:\n\n\"There was no sighing for the old days, no bitterness, but this struggle to save her face was an obsession. Once I saw her getting out of the bathtub. She had an incredible body like a young girl's. But the face was old. I seemed to be looking at a head and body belonging to a different person. But she always refused to consider a facelift. She seemed to feel it was somehow shameful, unlike today, when people boast about it.\"\n\n\"Norma's purported dalliance with Rooney was between marriages. No blame there.\"\n\nIt was still pretty sleazy. He was under 18 and she was in her thirties. That's pretty gross.\n\nShe did give Thalberg \"two healthy children.\" And that was all. She never wanted children. She had them because Thalberg wanted them, and she considered it her duty as his wife to give him children. In Gavin Lambert's bio of Norman he quotes a woman named Eleanor Boardman as saying:\n\n\"I was at a party where Norma appeared in a pink lace dress holding two bouquets of pink roses to hide her stomach. She never wanted to have children. She hated being pregnant!\"\n\nLambert, who was obviously a fan of Shearer's, said that \"a less hostile and more accuration interpretation would be that the star was determined to maintain her glamorous image for as long as possible.\" But I think the previous \"interpretation\" was right on the mark. Shearer never had any interest in her children and her relationships with them was what might be called \"distant.\" After the birth of her second child, which was difficult, she was told by the doctor that it was best for her not to have any more children. Lambert conceded that \"it might be guessed that she gave him no argument.\" I suspect that the Thalberg's sex life dwindled even more after that.\n\n[quote]r559 She did give Thalberg \"two healthy children.\" And that was all. She never wanted children. She had them because Thalberg wanted them, and she considered it her duty as his wife to give him children ... Eleanor Boardman said: \"She never wanted to have children. She hated being pregnant!\"\n\nNorma only had her first brat to escape her meddling mother-in-law, Sylvia.\n\nThalberg lived with his mom, and when he married Dame Norma, she was just plopped into that existing household. According to Irene Mayer Selznick, Norma schemed to get pregnant a few years later just so she could say, \"Oh, what a shame. With a baby coming, Irving and I will need a bigger place. Let's pack!\"\n\nDidn't the revelation of her affair with Rooney only come out when he revealed it in his autobiography after Norma died? So who knows if it's really true or if anyone in Hollywood knew about it when it happened? And if he was 19 at the time, that was hardly cradle robbing.\n\nAnd what wfe has to \"scheme\" to get pregnant after being married a few yerars? Seems like getting pregnant would be a pretty normal and expected part of the marriage process. And if Norma wanted to establish a home of her own with her husband.....what's the issue? I don't understand the impropriety there.\n\nThe hate here is truly bewildering.\n\n\"Don't know if she had any work done during her Hollywood days but she had work done in her retirement.\"\n\nI've seen photos of her after she retired. I've never seen any that looked like she'd had plastic surgery. She just kept getting more and more wrinkled.\n\nI don't believe Garbo had any surgery on her face. But as early photos show she did have work done on her teeth which were not photogenic. And she did NOT have huge feet. Jealous people were hard pressed to find any flaw in Greta Garbo, but they finally came up with something: huge feet. But her feet were only average sized."
