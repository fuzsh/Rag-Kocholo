I keep missing it!\n\nI like Shearer, too, though sometimes her acting style is a little hard to watch (it's obvious she made the transition from silent films). If you haven't seen her and Gable in Idiot's Delight, it's coming up on TCM in the next week or two, and is worth watching just to see Gable sing and dance.\n\nFrom: dfordoom\n\n2010-05-16 07:03 pm (UTC)\n\nGable singing and dancing is something I must see!\n\nFrom: klia\n\n2010-05-16 07:25 pm (UTC)\n\nIt's pretty awesome. *g*\n\nFrom: rpowell\n\n2010-05-16 05:38 pm (UTC)\n\nNorma Shearer's acting style has never really bothered me. Frankly, I thought she had adjusted to sound pictures very well. Someone once pointed out that she was the only cast member in THE BARRETTS OF WIMPOLE STREET who didn't indulge in histronic acting.\n\nAs for Thalberg's influence on her career, that didn't happen until after she won her Oscar. Up until 1930, Thalberg barely paid attention to her career. Even after they got married. And when she made it known that she wanted the title role in THE DIVORCEE, he brushed her aside, claiming she was not suited for the role. Shearer took matters into her own hands by posing for a series of provacative photos taken by George Hurrell, to prove that she could do the role. Thalberg was finally convinced and cast her. The rest is history.\n\nThere is one thing that I heartily agree upon. I also get tired of film historians giving lavish praise to MGM movies during the Golden Age. The studio may have been the most financially successful at the time (ironic, considering what MGM is going through now), but I do believe that other studios were also releasing some knock out films.\n\nFrom: dfordoom\n\n2010-05-16 07:05 pm (UTC)\n\nI also get tired of film historians giving lavish praise to MGM movies during the Golden Age.\n\nI don't know what the US variant is like, but TCM in Australia has an obsession with the greatness and wonderfulness and general all-round perfection of everything MGM that gets quite embarrassing at times. It's almost cult-like!\n\nFrom: rpowell\n\n2010-05-16 05:41 pm (UTC)\n\nShearer could have continued her acting career after Thalberg's death. She, Garbo, Crawford and all other female stars who became big around the late 20s and early 30s were going a difficult period professionally. Both Shearer and Garbo decided to retire from the film business in the early 40s. Crawford ended up getting dumped by MGM, but she was picked up by Warner Bros. Although she became queen of that lot around the mid-to-late 1940s, Crawford's reign was not as long lasting as Shearer's at MGM in the 30s or Bette Davis' reign at Warners from 1935-36 to 1945."
