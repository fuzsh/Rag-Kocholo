        "text": "We wanted to convey another story from Film History which we feel is important. It has to do with a man you’ve probably never heard of, yet who left an indelible imprint on the entire film industry. One who played a major role in shaping cinema as the dominant art form of the 20th century. He wasn’t a star, a director, a writer, nor even a studio chief. There are only two films ever made with his name in the credits. And both of them were released after he died.\n\nYet nearly every year they present a trophy at the Academy Awards in his honor. It’s the industry’s way of honoring the debt it owes the man 80 years after his passing. And generations of filmmakers and studio executives have been mentored using the legacy of this one individual. Even if few people in the public at large don’t even know who he is.\n\nHis name was Irving G. Thalberg. And despite his monumental achievements, it comes as a shock to most people to find out he was only 37 years old when he died. He only worked in the film industry a scant 15 years. Yet he probably had more influence on what you see at the movie theater than any other individual in film history. And, if you’re willing, we’d like to tell you his story.\n\nIrving Thalberg began his association with motion pictures in the early 1920s at Universal Studios. There, he landed a job as a personal assistant to Carl Laemmle, who ran the studio as a family operation. Some of Carl’s relatives weren’t exactly the sharpest tools in the shed. Especially when it came to managing film projects. So at the age of 21, Thalberg was able to convince Laemmle to make him head of production for what was at the time a fairly small operation.\n\nThalberg was a shy young man, and even though he was incredibly bright, was ill at ease around others. He also had a bad heart from a childhood bout with rheumatic fever. Various other ailments left him sickly and weak. As a child, doctors had told his parents he would spend the rest of his life in bed. But Thalberg was ambitious, persistent, and hard working. He ignored his doctor’s advice, and set out to accomplish something with the time he had been given. One person aptly described him “a bag of bones held together by sheer determination.”\n\nHe needed all this determination to tackle one of his first projects he inherited: the film Foolish Wives directed by Erich von Stroheim. At over $1 million, it was the most expensive film made up until that time by a Hollywood studio. Not because of the original budget. But because of the director’s legendary obsession for detail. Stroheim insisted that every prop, costume, and building in the picture be as authentic as possible. Parts of the film take place in Monte Carlo. For an establishing shot of one of the casinos (which only lasts for five seconds), Stroheim demanded that a replica of an actual building in Monte Carlo be recreated on the Universal Studio back lot. Even though one never saw the back of it (or inside for that matter). In another example of his obsession for realism, he demanded that all the cast members eat actual caviar on screen.\n\nStroheim’s intention was to create a movie six to ten hours long. And he had absolutely no respect for the new young production head who was tasked with keeping tabs on the production. “Since when does a boy supervise a genius?” he was reported to have grumbled. At one screening, Thalberg sat with him for five straight minutes while they observed a never ending closeup of marching feet. Exasperated, Thalberg turned to Stroheim and asked if the shot was ever going to end. “I’m trying to show that the character has a foot fetish,” was Stroheim’s terse reply. Thalberg retorted: “And YOU have a fetish for footage!”\n\nEventually, the production was finished, but only after Thalberg wrestled control away from the detail-obsessed director. Universal even capitalized on “Foolish Wives” huge costs by actively promoting the final budget. It opened to generally favorable reviews. And after bringing that particular ship into port, Thalberg had earned the respect of others on the Universal lot. People began to call him the “Boy Wonder.” It was a label that would stick with him for the rest of his life.\n\nMeanwhile, across town, a new studio had formed. Metro Goldwyn Mayer had been created from three different production companies with a gentleman named Louis B. Mayer at the helm. Their headquarters was located in Culver City, just outside of Los Angeles. Needing someone to handle the day to day operations, Mayer hired Thalberg as Vice President of Production based on the latter’s reputation at Universal.\n\nThe two men couldn’t have been more different. Mayer was a swaggering, egotistical, and brutal man who didn’t tolerate dissent in any form. He also nursed a strong conservative streak, and had no patience for the moral excesses of Tinseltown. Thalberg’s more cultured and sensitive approach to dealing with projects (and crises) was alien to Mayer. Yet the two of them turned out to be a very effective team. For their logo, they chose footage of a lion that eventually came to be called Leo. (Who actually resided at the Bronx zoo in New York). And their motto? Ars Gratia Artis (Art for Art’s Sake).\n\nDue to the distribution deals that had been negotiated as part of the merger, Thalberg and Mayer realized that their number one problem was creating product. They set for themselves an extremely ambitious goal: to turn out a full length motion picture every week. That added up to 52 movies per year. To accomplish this, they began to hire filmmakers and craftsmen at an astonishing rate. And also began a major building boom at Culver City, the home of MGM studios. It was the beginning of the greatest film empire ever seen in the history of Hollywood.\n\nAmong the pictures that Thalberg oversaw during those first years of MGM were several that represented the pinnacle of achievement in silent cinema.\n\nBen Hur, was another production that Thalberg had inherited after the MGM merger. Filming in Italy had been out of control for months. But Thalberg relocated the production back to Culver City and successfully brought it to closure. But not before resulting stress brought on the first of several major heart attacks for the young man. Despite doctor’s orders, Thalberg climbed out of bed to attend the premiere of the picture. It was a huge success. As was one of the studio’s subsequent pictures: the WWI spectacle The Big Parade. The latter ended up costing a tenth of what “Ben Hur” did. But both helped make MGM the most profitable studio in Hollywood.\n\nOn a more sour note, Thalberg found that the studio merger had also put him in charge of another production being run by Erich von Stroheim. Greed was based on a book entitled “McTeague.” It told the story of second rate dentist whose wife wins the lottery…only to see their lives destroyed by greed, lust, and desire. When Stroheim sat down to make the movie, he didn’t have a firm script. Instead, he just opened up the book to page one and started filming. It was his intention to shoot every page of the novel, in order, without any changes whatsoever. What he finally delivered was a film that was nine and a half hours long.\n\nThalberg was appalled. He demanded that Stroheim cut it down. The director reluctantly complied until he had a movie that ran over three hours. Thalberg still wasn’t satisfied and took control. His editors then worked to create a version which ran just under 100 minutes. But then one night, in one of the greatest tragedies in film history, a janitor accidentally threw out the remaining footage thinking they were just scraps. Film historians have always been enthralled by the power and artistry of what survives of “Greed.” But to this day, it’s widely considered to be perhaps the greatest lost masterpiece in the history of cinema.\n\nDespite this misstep, Thalberg began to solidify his position at MGM. Director King Vidor remembered that the young executive knew “instinctively when someone submitted a good idea.” Thalberg’s preferred method of management was to remain hands off and let the director and other artists have full rein…until he sensed that things were getting out of hand. Then, as in the case of Stroheim, he would intervene.\n\nMany people didn’t know what to make of the “Boy Wonder.” Quiet, intimidating, mysterious…these were some of the adjectives used to describe him. A natural introvert, Thalberg preferred to stay away from actual movie sets. But when he was forced to make an appearance, the proceedings would suddenly go quiet. Such was the power and respect he commanded.\n\nOne day, one of MGM’s newest actresses, Norma Shearer arrived on the lot to meet with Thalberg to discuss a new contract. She ran into him in the lobby of one of administrative buildings. Mistaking him for an office boy, she asked him if he could point the way to Irving Thalberg’s office. He responded by politely taking her there. Upon walking into the room, he turned to her and said, “I’m Irving Thalberg. Now, what can I do for you?” Shearer was deeply embarrassed. But took an instant liking to this unassuming young man. A year later, the two were married.\n\nAfter successfully (but painfully) making the conversion to sound in 1929-1930, Thalberg began to develop dozens of “literary” projects for MGM. To him, story was king. And he spared no expense in securing the services of the country’s top writers. He also bought up the rights to as many successful plays and books as he could get his hands on. “Entertainment is Irving’s god,” one screenwriter wrote. “He doesn’t know hot to rest, play, or even breathe without a script in his hand.” Thalberg’s preferred way of working was to sit at a long table with 20 or more movie scripts laid out in front of him. He’d go through each one and make notes for the respective writers on ways to improve the movie.\n\nAs a result of this emphasis on storytelling, and under Thalberg’s expert hand, MGM (and by extenstion, all of Hollywood, entered into its “golden period.” The Big House, The Champ, Red Dust, Red-Headed Woman, Possessed, Min and Bill, Grand Hotel, Emma, Anna Christie, Queen Christina, The Merry Widow, Tarzan and His Mate, The Trail of 98, The Thin Man, Trader Horn, Freaks, San Francisco, and Mutiny on the Bounty were just some of the movies that Thalberg oversaw during these early days of talking pictures.\n\nAnd in the process, made stars of the likes of Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, ClarkGable, Wallace Beery, Jackie Cooper, William Powell, Myrna Loy, Lionel Barrymore, Marie Dressler, Maurice Chevalier, Gloria Swanson, Robert Taylor, and Maureen O’Sullivan. Indeed, in no small part due to the quality of the product it produced, MGM was the only Hollywood studio to consistently remain in the black during The Great Depression.\n\nOne MGM star that gave both Mayer and Thalberg fits during this time was Jean Harlow. A born flirt, Harlow scandalized the Hollywood community by flaunting her sexuality, and was constantly rumored to be sharing a bed with various prominent individuals around town. But eyebrows really shot up when she married Paul Bern, an MGM producer who was some 20 years her senior. The couple seemed a very odd match. What’s more, Bern’s doctor was on the MGM payroll, and it was through him that Mayer learned that Harlow’s new husband had some major physical shortcomings. Below the belt — so to speak.\n\nTwo months after Harlow and Bern exchanged wedding vows, Mayer and Thalberg received a phone call from the studio. It was September 5th, 1932, and Harlow’s gardener had found Bern dead at the couple’s home. It’s a testament to the power of MGM at the time that when the servant found the body, he didn’t call the police. He didn’t notify the victim’s family. Instead, his first response was to phone the studio. When Mayer and Thalberg arrived on the scene, they found Harlow in hysterics, and Bern dead on the bathroom floor with a gunshot wound to the head.\n\nHistory doesn’t record what they discussed before the police arrived. But it’s safe to say that their number one priority was protecting the studio’s interests…and that included the reputation of one of its biggest stars. Hard as it is to believe, the police weren’t even called until much later that afternoon. When they finally showed up, Mayer presented them with the following suicide note:\n\nDearest Dear:\n\nUnfortunately this is the only way to make good the frightful wrong I have done you and to wipe out my abject humiliation. I love you. Paul. You understand that last night was only a comedy.\n\nAn inquiry found that Bern had committed suicide after feeling humiliated by an incidence of impotence. But Harlow refused to discuss the subject. Several people later claimed that Harlow had murdered her husband and Mayer had tampered with the crime scene in order to make it look like a suicide. Other investigators felt the so-called suicide note didn’t match Bern’s handwriting. It was also later discovered Bern had a common-law wife who had apparently killed herself by jumping into a river in Northern California three days after his death. Rumors abounded she was in the house that night as well.\n\nThe sad fact is that we’ll probably never know the entire truth. Harlow herself died of uremic poisoning five years later without ever revealing the details of what really happened that fateful evening. And there’s just not enough evidence to support any of the resulting theories. The Bern scandal to this day remains one of the all time great Hollywood mysteries.\n\nThere were other signs of trouble brewing in the MGM family. While Louis B. Mayer was only to happy to leave the day to day management of individual productions to Thalberg, he was often exasperated by the latter’s choice of subject matter. Mayer preferred big splashy family entertainment. From his perspective, realism and movies just didn’t mix. Mayer angrily told his head of production to avoid any stories that contained references to sex, poverty, crime, conflict, or anything else that flew in the face of “escapist entertainment.” But for his part, Thalberg didn’t believe in that approach. If it was a good story, and adhered to the production code of the time, he went with it. As a result, clashes with Mayer began to occur more frequently.\n\nThalberg worked continuously and desperately hard. Getting a major picture out the door every week utterly consumed him. But the people who worked for him loved his sense of commitment. At least once a week, Thalberg would corral a team of editors, script writers and publicity people. The troupe would climb aboard a private plush trolley car and journey to one of Los Angeles’ outer suburbs. And there, they would screen several MGM pictures for a private preview audience.\n\nThey would measure the audience’s reaction, and hand out comment cards for feedback. (Thalberg pioneered the use of pre-screenings…a common practice today.) Then, the group would go back to the studio and make whatever changes were necessary. In some cases this even included re-shooting key scenes. No aspect of the picture was untouchable. “Pictures aren’t made,” Thalberg liked to say. “They are remade.” Throughout, the emphasis was always on quality. Even the smallest cutaway was lit and composed with the same care as the main shots. “MGM doesn’t make bad pictures” was what Thalberg’s team liked to say. And for the most part, it was completely true.\n\nBut Thalberg’s success and popularity didn’t sit well with Mayer. He began to search for ways to undercut his potential rival. He got his chance in late 1933. While returning from a company Christmas party, Thalberg suffered another major heart attack. The long stressful hours had taken their toll on his frail body. His doctors told him he was lucky to be alive, and mandated he take several months off to recover. Thalberg agreed, and along with his wife and a few close friends, went on an extended European cruise.\n\nWhile Thalberg was away from the studio, Mayer replaced him with a team of established producers. This included an up and coming executive named David O. Selznick–who also just happened to be Mayer’s son in law. Selznick was an extremely able individual, but he had a totally different style from his predecessor. While Thalberg was content with a “hands-off” approach, Selznick made it a habit of being involved in every aspect of studio productions. His presence on the studio floor became commonplace and he didn’t hesitate to give his opinion on a variety of technical matters. Selznick’s huge ego also didn’t sit well with those he supervised. When it came to the subject of their boss, many began to circulate the wisecrack: “The Son-in-Law also rises.”\n\nThalberg’s poor health had always been an open secret. But many yearned for his return. Another saying that made the rounds among MGM employees under Selznick’s tenure was: “As long as Thalberg lives, we are all great men.” For his part, Selznick began to get frustrated at what he perceived as a lack of cooperation from those working under him. He finally resigned. In his resignation letter to Mayer, he bitterly complained about the loyalty Thalberg continued to enjoy from the rank and file. “MGM is Thalberg’s studio,” he wrote. “I am just an interloper.” Selznick went on to an extremely successful career as an independent producer. Among his later achievements was Gone With The Wind.\n\nAfter Thalberg had sufficiently recovered, Mayer was forced to give him his old job back. And it wasn’t long until he had resumed his usual workaholic habits. He also began to press Mayer to abandon their 52 picture a year schedule. Thalberg wanted to do fewer and even better pictures.\n\nOne of the film classics Thalberg next oversaw was A Night at the Opera with the Marx Brothers. Groucho, Chico, and Harpo had hit a dead end over at Paramount after their previous picture, Duck Soup, had been a box office flop. (Today, the movie’s considered a classic…but its anarchic style was too much for audiences in the 1930s.) Thalberg’s idea was to bring in the best writers and create a movie that fired on all cylinders…from the set design, to the music, to the plotting, to the gags. The end result saved The Marx Brother’s careers.\n\nYears later, Groucho told an interesting story that illustrated what it was like working with Irving Thalberg. The Brothers would have a meeting with him to discuss a film project. But every 10 minutes, someone would run in with some emergency that would demand Thalberg’s attention. And he would leave the room, keeping his guests waiting for hours on end.\n\nAfter this happened several times, the Marx Brothers got slightly annoyed. So, one day, while waiting for Thalberg, they stripped down to their underwear, built a huge fire in his fireplace, and proceeded to roast several potatoes right there in the office. When Thalberg returned, he was slightly upset, but had to agree it was bad form to keep running out on meetings. (For his part, Thalberg loved Groucho. He once wrote a letter which contained an oft-repeated quote: “The world would not be in such a snarl, if Marx had been Groucho instead of Karl.” )\n\n“A Night at the Opera” was a gigantic success. But it was one of the last productions that Thalberg lived to see to completion. On Labor Day weekend in 1936, he took a short vacation at a lodge in Northern California. There, he came down with a simple cold which quickly developed into pneumonia. And within two weeks, Irving Thalberg was dead. The “Boy Wonder” was only 37 years old.\n\nEven though everyone knew that Thalberg’s health had always been suspect, the news devastated the film community. People had gotten used to his frail condition. But to lose him so suddenly was a tremendous shock. The mantra “As long as Thalberg lives, we are all great men” took on a whole new meaning.\n\nMGM film editor Margaret Booth, whose career in Hollywood spanned an incredible 60 years remembered what it was like:\n\n“It was terrible. Appalling. So sudden…and not right. It wasn’t fair. It was a shocking thing…because he was a genius. And there isn’t anyone today to equal him. And there never will be.”\n\nIrving Thalberg was laid to rest on September 16th, 1936. MGM Studios announced they were closing their doors for the day. Paramount, Warner Brothers, Fox, RKO, Universal…all the other studios followed suit. It was the first and only time in the history of Hollywood that’s ever happened. Because even the rival studios realized what Thalberg meant to the industry. His death marked a watershed moment. And the entire community mourned.\n\nPerhaps the only person who didn’t feel bad about Thalberg’s passing was Louis B. Mayer. As he was driven away from the funeral, he elbowed an associate in the ribs, and smiling said, “Ain’t God good to me…”\n\nWith Thalberg gone, Mayer became the undisputed head of MGM. And as such, he began emphasizing wholesome family entertainment. By World War II, the majority of MGM’s output was big budget musicals and films like Lassie Come Home and The Yearling. While these kind of “safe” films helped fill the studio’s coffers during the war years, it left it poorly positioned to adapt to shifts in the public mood during the late 40s. Which eventually led to Mayer’s own demise. You can read about what eventually happened to him in this earlier blog post from Film History 101.\n\nAt the start of this post, we said we felt Irving Thalberg’s story was an important one to tell. And it’s only proper to explain why. The advent of sound along with Thalberg’s emphasis on quality productions transformed the film industry. It was under Thalberg that movies finally “grew up” and left their novelty status behind forever. Never again would anyone equate film with nickelodeons and gimmicky carnival attractions. It emerged as a fully legitimate and literate art form. One that would come to dominate the world as the most popular medium of mass entertainment for the rest of the century.\n\nThis blog–and plenty of other people–have certainly had some fun making sport of Hollywood’s missteps and excesses. But make no mistake about it. American films are the envy of the world. Since the 1930s, no other country has come close to competing with the quality and variety of films that Hollywood produces. Think about it. Even the cheesiest, silliest, action shoot em up reflects mature craftsmanship on multiple levels. Yes, we can all make fun of how “bad” some movies are. But have you ever sat through a Steven Seagal movie and said “Boy this is stupid…but look at all the trouble they went to light that shot…!!”. Probably because you’re so conditioned to seeing good photography in even second rate movies you tend to take the technical aspects for granted.\n\nMovies remain one of America’s greatest exports. Travel around the world, and virtually every country with access to a video screen can rattle off the name of American movie stars. Even former Korean dictator Kim Jong-il used to own the world’s largest private movie collection–the vast majority of which is reportedly made up of American films. (The Godfather was said to be a personal favorite). During the 1980s, one of the biggest commodities on the Russian black market were home videos of American movies. Through them, the Russian people saw that not everything their government told them about “decadent Western culture” was necessarily true. For decades, Hollywood has unwittingly served as a silent ambassador for The United States–promoting our values, our way of life, our freedoms, and our technological achievements.\n\nAnd this can all be traced back to the early 1930s. It was then that an extremely young executive set the bar for what came to be known as the “Hollywood Film.” Granted, Thalberg didn’t do all of this single-handedly. But he led the way in emphasizing quality as the greatest single attribute for the medium at the time. In one form or another, it’s been with us ever since. And that remains Irving Thalberg’s true legacy.\n\nThe year after his death, the industry created the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award to honor “creative producers whose bodies of work reflect a consistently high quality of motion picture production.” It’s usually handed out during each year’s Academy Awards. Past recipients have included Walt Disney, Alfred Hitchcock, Cecil B. DeMille, Jack Warner, Stanley Kramer, Robert Wise, Steven Spielberg, Francis Ford Coppola and Clint Eastwood.\n\nSo, while you’re watching the yearly Oscar telecast, and the time comes to hand out the Irving Thalberg award, keep in mind what it really means. A lot of people use the occasion to make another refrigerator run. But to those who follow the film industry, the presentation represents a hallowed moment. Because the award doesn’t commemorate some grizzled old fuddy-duddy who had plenty of friends on the Awards Committee. Instead, it helps us remember the legacy of one extraordinary individual who literally changed the course of movie history. And who in the process demonstrated the potential of what the medium of film is truly capable of."
