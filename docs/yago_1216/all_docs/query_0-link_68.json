        "text": "Norma gets a lot of slack for keeping her silent acting mannerism even after the era was long gone, but I don't really mind it. If anything, it gave her something unique and special and very often it worked well in her movies. She also gets a lot of slack for ''sleeping with the boss'' and getting all the prestige roles and projects at MGM. Joan Crawford and I'm sure many other actresses on the lot, resented her for it. But who can blame her? Joan would have done the same, if she got the chance. It's just that Norma was there first.\n\nI've seen quite a few of her movies but there are many I'm yet to discover. She certainly did many genres and it's interesting to follow her career trajectory from silents to Pre Codes to prestige literary epics to comedy. I love The Women, Free Soul, Marie Antoinette (her best dramatic performance imo), The Barretts of Wimpole Street, Idiot's Delight etc. By 1942 the tide was turning at MGM and new actresses arrived, groomed to take over from the old guard. Interesting that Norma was initially set to star in Mrs.Miniver but pulled out, giving Greer Garson, an Oscar winning role that will make her the new Queen of the lot.\n\nEven after leaving MGM, Norma retained her influence there. She discovered Janet Leigh and brought her to the studio. Plus her brother Douglas was a recording director at Metro, staying there until the late 60s.\n\nYeah, I've read that Norma's acting in the early-to-mid 1930s was criticized for being dated, even for the time period. That very theatrical, gesture-induced silent era style of acting quickly dissolved once Hollywood's Pre-Code era kicked into full swing. Even if Norma's acting techniques weren't everyone's preferred cup of tea, it certainly didn't show in the popularity of her films. Her pictures in the early 1930s, like The Divorcee and A Free Soul to name just two, were enormously popular with American audiences. So successful was her on-screen transition to sound that many other actresses were encouraged to imitate her voice to hopefully duplicate her success.\n\nThere is a lot written about Joan Crawford being irked that Norma got all the best roles MGM had on the table, all apparently because she was \"sleeping with the boss\". While that is really a butt move on Crawford's part, I cannot entirely disagree with what she says here. While I think Shearer was a capable actress, I won't get into a whole rant about justifying her playing the parts she got. When you really think about it, though, who else did MGM have as a star to play Juliet or Marie Antoinette?\n\nI mean these ladies were the studio's top stars in the 1930s and they all had specific types:\n\nGreta Garbo was Swedish and played that self-sacrificing melodrama to the hilt.\n\nJoan Crawford toyed in those rags-to-riches Cinderella stories, later becoming almost solely defined as a clotheshorse.\n\nMyrna Loy was stereotyped as the perfect wife in typical light comedy.\n\nJean Harlow was originally that bubblegum-chewing platinum blonde, who later matured as a tongue-in-cheek comedienne.\n\nLuise Rainier was a German originally occupying Garbo's shadow, but who played a couple of Oscar-winning parts before fading into obscurity.â€‹\n\nNone of the above mentioned women could have easily played Shearer's roles. One thinks that Garbo and Rainier could possibly have played them had the roles been written with a European slant, and maybe Crawford could have tackled Juliet, at the most, if she had been properly coached beforehand and aided by a dutiful director. Harlow and Loy are almost totally inconceivable in those types of roles, with Harlow's hair and sexiness being too prominent, while Loy's every-woman demeanor was too ordinary.\n\nMGM needed someone like Norma Shearer to play those more generically grand, theatrical-type parts. No other actress on the lot, before Greer Garson came in 1939, could have done any significant justice to those scripts. In saying all of that, however, it is still almost entirely impossible not to think that Shearer got the choice parts she got because she was married to Irving Thalberg. It seems completely natural that Thalberg's first choice for the leading lady in all his productions would certainly have been his wife. There was at least one instance, though, in 1930 when Thalberg apparently wanted Joan Crawford for The Divorcee. He evidently felt Shearer lacked the sex appeal the part required, a fact she rectified by submitting to a vampy photo shoot to amp-up the sex appeal associated with her on-screen persona. Eventually, as we all know, Shearer got the role and ended up winning an Oscar for her work.\n\nWhat makes so many people think that Shearer's productions depended solely on Thalberg probably owes to the considerable downturn in the quality of her films when he passed in 1936. Sure, she did still have good roles in Idiot's Delight and The Women, but the studio was in the process of rebranding their stable of stars, and Shearer was on the way out. Rainier, Garbo, and Crawford all left the studio between 1938 and 1943, and Shearer, the studio's unofficial First Lady, was also on her way of being edged out. She reportedly declined starring roles in Mrs. Miniver and Madame Curie to instead star in We Were Dancing and Her Cardboard Lover (both 1942), which both flopped at the box office. She finally decided it was time to move on from the movies, although she kept a strong relationship with MGM well into the 1960s. She brought Janet Leigh to the studio, who became a popular film star in the 1950s."
