        "text": "I first met Anita Page in 1994, at a party in Beverly Hills. She sounded like Mae West and, in a long blonde wig, looked like a cross between Baby Jane Hudson and Barbara Cartland. She appeared uninterested in everyday life. All she really cared about was her Hollywood heyday, the era of the first talkies. She couldn't believe her fame had gone.\n\nA couple of years later, my brother and I began making a film about early Hollywood and got to know her rather better. She lives the life of Norma Desmond, rising at noon, when one of her assistants gets her dressed for the day ahead. Her wardrobe largely consists of remodelled dresses she wore in the 20s, to which she will add accessories once bought by male suitors. The furs are all a little moth-eaten, her long fingernails look like scarlet talons. The remainder of the day she spends watching herself in old movies. In her own mind, there is only ever one real star. The most famous, the most sought after Anita Page.\n\nShe phones about once a month now to ask what we are up to, and to tell me of her latest projects (although she is in her 90s, she still acts, but not in movies that many will see) and what she and her entourage - a ragbag of assistants, nurses and hangers-on - are doing. She lives between her two houses in Pasadena and Beverly Hills, and says she wants to come to England and take the Eurostar to Paris.\n\nListening to her is like listening to a radio that slips between frequencies, but her recollection of her movie career is crystal clear. She gossips to me about her rivalry with Garbo, who pushed her into second place in a most popular actress poll in 1929, and her hatred of Joan Crawford, with whom she starred Our Dancing Daughters in 1928. And about the parties she attended at William Randolph Hearst's mansion, San Simeon, with William Powell, Jean Harlow, Buster Keaton, Norma Talmadge and Marlene Dietrich.\n\nIn one of our conversations, in 1998, she mentioned another name to me. \"I knew so many nice men,\" she said. \"I knew Mussolini. He used to write to me.\" Although she had told me many extraordinary stories, she had never before mentioned the Italian dictator. I pressed her further, she was not prepared to say more and I wrote it off as being too difficult, or inconsequential, for her to recall.\n\nTwo weeks ago, however, I received another phone call. As usual when she rings me, it was 2am in the UK and I was asleep. The television was on full volume in the Californian background. \"Have I gotten you up,\" she asked. \"Yes,\" I said. \"There is a German woman on my TV.\" It was Leni Riefenstahl, in the news for a press conference she had given at the Frankfurt Book Fair to publicise a new biography. \"She knew a friend of mine in Italy.\"\n\nShe went on: \"Leni was an intimate friend of Adolf Hitler, or so they say.\" She talked about Riefenstahl as if they were once rivals, though in fact they were worlds apart. Where Riefenstahl was making propaganda films for the Nazi leadership, Page was a hedonist whose principal concern was finding the next glass of champagne.\n\nI asked her why she is interested in the 98-year-old German film-maker. \"Well, it is just that Leni had Hitler and I had Mussolini. Maybe Leni and I should get together, you know, girls comparing notes.\" She laughed. \"I got the sweetest letters from Mussolini, real nice.\" And she started to tell me about the day they began to arrive - and about how, in the end, they would contribute to her being dropped by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.\n\nAnita Page, born Anita Pomares, signed for MGM in 1928. During the tail end of the silent era, she starred in a number of hit films, including Telling the World, While the City Sleeps and Our Modern Maidens. Broadway Melody, which was the first all-sound movie, won the best picture Oscar in 1929. \"I took MGM into the sound era,\" she takes great pride in telling me, \"and made them a huge buck.\"\n\nShe specialised in playing amoral, hard-drinking floozies. That, combined with her looks, brought her a string of male admirers. She dated Charles \"Buddy\" Rogers, Douglas Fairbanks Jr, Prince Louis Ferdinand and Clark Gable, who wrote of Page: \"She was a unique beauty. When I worked with Grace Kelly and looked into her eyes I remembered Anita Page.\" And she received bags and bags of correspondence.\n\n\"Between movies I signed fan mail,\" she said. \"Or I modelled, or went on publicity tours. I received so much fan mail.\" To cope with it, she hired help in the form of her mother, Helen Pomares. She employed her father, John, as a chauffeur and her brother Mario as her gym instructor. \"I loved my family and they loved me right back,\" she said.\n\nBut Anita would still open some of her own mail. She recalls finding the first letter from Mussolini in mid-1929. \"I was so excited. I was so thrilled, to open this beautiful adoring letter,\" she said. A second followed, which was opened by her secretary. Recognising the handwriting, Anita opened a third.\n\nIn one week, Page found eight letters from Mussolini. Where other fans just asked for an autograph, Page says Mussolini's missives were more obsessive, more those of a connoisseur. As well as detailing every move she made in the film, he enclosed pictures of himself and begged her for a signed portrait in return. \"Oh, honey, his letters were so gooey, so sweet and actually so touching. He obviously loved what he saw on the screen - me.\"\n\nWhat did Mussolini actually write?\n\n\"Well, you English and Europeans are so romantic. I think Ramón Navarro said, 'Why kiss the hand when the lips are in view?' I'm trying to think now what Mussolini said about my hands.\n\n\"He liked the films first, then me. Or maybe my appearance in the films made him want to watch them in the first place. My hair seemed to be a big deal - it may have seemed messy, but that was the look. He even wanted a slice of it once. I remember my mother wanted to send him a picture of me playing tennis. She may well have done - mother sent all sorts of pictures to my fans. My mother and father had to come over and put my photos in envelopes, you know, people wanted to own a part of me, I was big!\"\n\nAnita's mother kept a keen eye on Page's male suitors. She vetted them heavily, separating the eligible from undesirables such as Ramón Navarro and William Haines - both known homosexuals. Each offered Anita their hand in marriage, but Pomares refused them.\n\nMGM was tolerant of Anita's flings, up to a point. But the studio's vice president, Irving Thalberg, was in love with Page and often made his feelings very clear. \"He like me to call him Daddy,\" she says. \"Nothing happened. I said to Irving, 'Admire me from afar, darling, and that will be just fine for the both of us.'\" Thalberg was married to the actress Norma Shearer at the time.\n\nPage had other problems with her studio bosses. Her rivalry with the sexually voracious Joan Crawford caused increasing tension at MGM. \"I ended up loathing Joan,\" says Page. \"For one thing she tried to hit on me several times. Let me tell you, when my mother saw the sex aids in various shapes and colours that Joan kept in her medicine cabinet, she refused my ever seeing Joan again - apart from on a film set.\"\n\nWhen the studio learnt that piles of letters were arriving from Mussolini simply addressed to \"Film star Anita Page, MGM Hollywood\", they started to get nervous. In part, says Page, this was because of Thalberg. \"Irving was jealous of any attention,\" she says. \"Of that I am certain.\" She says he refused to give her the role of Red Andrews in Red-Headed Woman (1932) because she wouldn't have sex with him. \"He kept saying to me, 'The film is yours but what are you going to do for Daddy?' I saw his manhood was growing in his pants. I became uneasy, as I turned and walked out of his office I knew I would not get the picture.\"\n\nShe recalls a furious Thalberg reading out one of Mussolini's letters to her. \"I asked him, 'Why are you so mad?' I am a famous movie star at your studio and have an enormous worldwide following. I didn't think it so odd that someone like theItalian should love me.\"\n\nStudio head Louis B Mayer thought it would be a mistake to leak even a hint of information about Mussolini's love letters. Frightened of a scandal, Mayer ordered Page not to respond. Even sending him a signed portrait was strictly forbidden.\n\nThen another letter arrived at MGM from Mussolini thanking Anita for a signed print of her by the celebrity photographer George Hurrell. As she often did, Anita's mother had forged Page's sig nature. The star and her mother were called into Mayer's office where he and Thalberg questioned them about the thankyou note. Mrs Pomares said that a fan is a fan and her daughter never said no to a request, especially from such a prominent foreigner.\n\n\"Oh brother, I think Mussolini thought I'd opened the door into my affections. He wrote of my gorgeous lips and my hands.\" He also sent her gifts - she remembers perfume and a food parcel - but MGM sent them back with typed notes saying thanks, but no thanks.\n\nI ask Anita if she still had any copies of the letters. She said she would look.\n\nOver the next four evenings I telephone to try to establish if anyone in the house has located Mussolini's letters. Randy Malone is Anita's number one assistant and also notable for his appearances on the American TV show Singled Out, where he dresses in drag and mimics Hollywood actors. Malone was a teenager when he first met Anita at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. Over the years their relationship has gone from strength to strength. Although he is gay, Anita has proposed to him dozens of times.\n\nThe rest of the Page household consists of a nurse called Carol and a small crowd of gay men, all jobbing actors and all infatuated with Page.\n\nThe house has been turned upside-down. Randy has organised a search party. The former child actress Margaret O'Brien, now in her 60s and another of Anita's entourage, has joined in. Randy whispers to me that he has to keep Margaret and Anita apart, as they are jealous of each other for spending time with him. Margaret has also asked Randy to marry him. Randy's partner, Mickey, is apparently unaware of the actress's feelings.\n\nIn 1934, Anita married Nacio Herb Brown, but the marriage was short-lived. Two years after they divorced, Anita met and married an American admiral, Hershal House. They had two daughters, Sarah and Linda. Linda, who is an artist who also runs an escort agency, is in daily contact with Anita and her assistants.\n\nIt is Linda who calls me next. She is visiting the house to help locate the letters. \"Mother is so pleased to talk to you,\" she says. \"She loves England. I'm helping the cause here right now. I did see one of the photographs Mussolini sent her in the old house, but since she has been here with Randy I haven't seen it.\"\n\nLike her mother, Linda lives in a time warp. In the 60s Linda's looks were reminiscent of Jayne Mansfield's. Today, at almost 60, she wears her hot pants bright and extremely tight. Her platinum wig has seen so much hairspray over the years that the strands are clumped together in a sticky mess. Her make-up is heavy and her eyelashes extremely long.\n\nI ask Linda why Mussolini fell for Anita over so many other movie stars. \"Stop there, honey,\" Linda says. \"Mussolini wrote to mom because quite simply she is beautiful. I say this because she still has her looks. Yes, they are still there, she like fell into the fountain of youth. You remember when you came out here to see mom and took her picture with a flash gun in your camera. Well, she didn't blink once. Now how's that for a star. She never went in for much make-up either; Constance Bennett hated her for that. Constance detested natural beauty like mom's. I have been blessed with mom's good looks too. How fortunate am I?\"\n\nI try to get Linda back on track: \"Did Mussolini write about how attractive he found Anita?\"\n\nLinda goes quiet on the end of the phone. \"Let's think. His letters had little or no formalities to them; he addressed her as his darling sweetheart dearest and called her talented and tremendous. Honey, Mussolini had it bad. He detailed every move she made in the movies he saw her in. He commented on every twist and turn she made. I personally think he liked the fact that mom was so vital. I mean she did all her own stunts, fell down flights of stairs... she could sing, too. She still does. Anita did all kinds of stuff. Mom was a beauty, yes, but I think he saw her being gutsy, too. I think I'm right in saying that Broadway Melody was his favourite. Later on when Mussolini hooked up with Hitler, Grandma Pomares got upset and felt guilty about the time she pretended to be Anita.\n\n\"Mom never spoke about Mussolini to my daddy [Hershal House]. Actually she didn't mention Mussolini at all until recently. It's too bad that Randy and the boys couldn't locate anything he wrote to Anita for you to read...\n\n\"What else can I tell you? Mussolini wrote in longhand and had pretty good penmanship. His English was all over the place but that didn't matter; the essence came through. The letter I read was quite tame, although mom did say he wrote of her bosom on one occasion. Isn't it crazy that my mom got stuff like that from Mussolini? Oh, he also wrote in green ink. I have to say that mom had no idea of what kind of man Mussolini was or how he treated his people.\"\n\nAnita's posse keeps her isolated from the real world. My interest in her correspondence with Mussolini has fired their egos. Each inhabitant has his or her own motive for hanging out at the Page house. All of them want to be in the movies.\n\nI have received five phone calls in one evening. It appears Anita is getting irritated with the contents of drawers and cupboards being scattered about the floor. Randy has found a solution. \"We have all told Anita that she is going to a premiere so she is now upstairs in the back room all dressed up watching herself and Buster Keaton in Free and Easy (1930). We will dig up the back yard if we have to, but we can't find anything yet.\"\n\nGetting desperate for hard evidence, I contact a former MGM secretary named Buck, in case he can throw any light on the Mussolini ephemera. \"Gee, that was some time ago,\" he says. \"I remember how mad Mayer got with Anita and her mother. He could handle her feud with Joan Crawford but found Anita's other baggage an irritation. When Anita's mother was sending that stuff to Mussolini, that was really the last straw for those two.\" I ask him if he ever sees Anita. \"Are you kidding? She's out every night. The big guy [Randy] gets invites to all the parties in town, even the Oscars. When they're out all dressed up they look like the Addams Family at Christmas and in full Technicolor.\"\n\nNext I turn to actress Marion Shilling. Page's junior by several years, she knows Anita from her MGM days - and afterwards, when the pair freelanced at minor studios in Hollywood.\n\n\"I was invited to Anita's 21st birthday party at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel,\" she recalls. \"It was a big party - Clark Gable, Jean Harlow, William Haines, Lili Damita and William Powell were there. Her date was Robert Young, she wore this frilly dress - pink, I think.\n\n\"Robert seemed a bit nervous: he stood on the dance floor, rigid, while Anita danced around the floor like a wild cat. She told Mona Rico and I about getting six letters from a gentleman called Mussolini. I only remembered the story when the war broke out and you heard about him and Hitler. I didn't think she knew who Mussolini was, though of course she knew he was important and most of all he hadn't sent a letter to Joan Crawford, so Anita was one up on her. It is strange how memories come flooding back.\n\n\"To Anita, fame was everything. I see her out at parties now. The poor darling, she's still on stage and cannot let go of the fact that she was once a star. But she was always charming to me and extremely well-liked on set.\"\n\nFinally I call the actor David Rollins, an other contemporary of Anita's at MGM. He too remembers the fuss over Mussolini. \"She was pretty open about telling everyone that Mussolini was in love with her. Basically I don't think she realised who he was. Until 1933, few people really knew who he was in the States. But Anita knew he was important enough to make a big fuss over the fan mail.\" He remembers Thalberg being so annoyed that Anita wouldn't go with him that he would have done anything to get rid of her at this point. \"What better way of getting rid of her than this stuff?\"\n\nA combination of events led to an end to the letters. MGM had done well out of Anita Page's movies, but she was increasingly being asked to pose for risqué photographs showing her in revealing gowns, and she baulked at the studio's request that she appear in public with men they picked for her. When she complained to Mayer about her treatment and asked for a pay increase, he flatly refused. Mayer bragged that he could make Page shine in three pictures - and that he could break Garbo in the same number. Mayer knew Anita had turned Thalberg down. He punished her by loaning her out to other studios for the remainder of her contract at MGM.\n\nAnita says: \"I'm sure where I feared to tread Joan Crawford, Constance Bennett and maybe even Jean Harlow didn't give it a second thought. Joan called him Papa. Irving was obviously so mad with me he ruined my career.\"\n\nAfter Anita left MGM in 1932 she did a series of tests for Fox and it appeared she would be offered a contract. Later she learned that the head of Fox had lunch with Mayer the day she was called to sign a contract, and the contract never materialised. Anita thought after she left MGM that Mussolini had given up on her too, but later she discovered over a four-year period that her mother had sent Mussolini a further 20 autographed pictures that she had signed. A mailroom employee at MGM told her that he sent her more than 100 letters.\n\n\"I never met Mussolini,\" she says, \"though I sure would have liked to. Honey I'm not saying that I'd have married him.\" She says he asked her twice. \"My father never liked the whole business. When my brother said he was frightened in case Mussolini came over and kidnapped me, father reassured us that Mussolini wouldn't get as far as Beverly Hills before being noticed.\n\n\"Mussolini may have liked me and I know I was real pleased with all the attention but really I think he was a bit of a pig. After all, his people were not allowed freedom. People should be able to speak their minds. If he wrote to me today I would tell him that people should see films, going to see a film opens your mind and gets you thinking. They give you inspiration. I hope I entertained and inspired someone.\"\n\nA few nights later I received another call from the house. Still nothing had surfaced. It seems unlikely now that anything will."
