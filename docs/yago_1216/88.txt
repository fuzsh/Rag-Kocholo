* * *

During the Great Depression, Norma Shearer represented all the glamour and chic associated with MGM. Although her acclaimed talent as an actress rested on little more than fan magazine publicity, she was, undeniably, a major star. She consistently ranked among Hollywood's most popular performers during the 1930s, winning six Academy Award nominations for best actress between 1929 and 1938. Her marriage to Irving Thalberg was of great importance; his position made her a first lady of Hollywood while his power secured for Shearer some of her best roles. This is not to imply that Shearer's career depended upon her husband's connections. She had learned from working in silent films for such marginal outfits as Allied Producers, New Brunswick, and FBO Studios, how best to utilize her limited talents to create the ultimate image of a glamorous woman. After Thalberg's death, she completed her studio contract and then retired to a life of wealth and leisure, only rarely appearing in public. Of her films, only The Student Prince, Romeo and Juliet, and The Women seem to hold any interest for audiences today.
