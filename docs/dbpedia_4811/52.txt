SiteGround Summary Review by HRank

SiteGround is mostly stable and never got lower than 99.0% uptime.

It also had a very stable response time (mostly 600ms – 800ms).

The company was continuously growing the number of domains and Shared IPs that host them. By its growth rate, it can be concluded that all the company’s promotional campaigns have so far been fruitful. However, if you come to think about it, their performance quite justified their advertising.
