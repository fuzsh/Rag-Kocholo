Cons of Using SiteGround Hosting

As I stated above, each hosting service has few drawbacks. So below I am going to share few of the cons of using SiteGround hosting.

Limited Space for cheapest plan: Hosting packages offered by SiteGround come with fixed amount of storage, anyway the available amount of storage space is very huge and in case you are in the starting stage, you will never find yourself out of storage.

Huge Setup fee for Month to Month Hosting Billing: If you are planning to sign up monthly hosting plan, you will be charged $14.95 as setup fee, which is quite high. However if you opt for longer billing cycle, you will huge discount along with 30 days money back guarantee. Therefore it is highly recommended to opt longer billing cycle so that you can save more.

Lack of Free Domain Name: Numerous of hosting companies like Bluehost, Hostinger, iPage offer freebies to draw attention of new customers. A free domain name is offered by almost every top web hosts for atleast one year, (Bluehost offer free Domain for 1 year) but unluckily SiteGround does not offer domain for free with hosting packages.

SiteGround Uptime and Reliability

One of our team member have an account with SiteGround is using to host a personal web page. He maintains it for around 2 years now. During that time he has faced downtime twice, for less than 20 minutes each. In those situations there were scheduled server maintenance and he was warned many times for it – a week before the date, 3-4 days before and 3-4 hours before the actual server downtime. SiteGround stated that they are relocating their servers to a faster and modern platform which was the cause of the website downtime in both cases. Other than this he did not experience any other server related troubles with them.

Server Response Time of SiteGround (2024)

The content you add to your website create huge effect on the loading time of your page. To give an instance, on the off chance that you have added high definition/resolution images or videos on a page of your site or blog, at that point those HD contents will considerably expand the entire loading time of the page.

In other terms the results you get from speed test may not correctly show how speedy and prompt your web hosting India service actually is. As opposed to testing page loading speed individually, here at UpdatedReviews we made a decision to analyse the real web server response time also.

To made this possible we make use of Bitcatcha server speed testing tool. One of the unique thing about this tool is that it just analyze the server response time and overlooks the content of a page. At the same time this tool shows the average loading time of a site from various locations all over the world.

Given below is the screenshot of the results:

As you have seen, SiteGround is an outstanding option in case you are going to target the USA based audience. The server response time for the USA outstanding just 12 ms. Also in case you are planning to target Indian audience then you can happily go with SiteGround since their server response time for India is quite good just 65ms. The overall server response for all locations is quite good.

Technical Support

Tech support is something people really don’t expect to worry about when they’re actually in the process of choosing service providers. They usually recognize their fault the very first time they try to get somebody on the phone in order to converse about an issue or trouble.

It’s actually fairly notable that support at Siteground is pretty much unbeatable! Because, they’re really great at answering your questions or queries before you purchase a package. But they remain equally helpful once you’re actually a customer. They provide support in three formats- live chat, telephone support and ticket system.

SiteGround Features Review

SiteGround has three types of shared hosting packages, including StartUp, GrowBig and GoGeek. The three packages are much more costly when compared with most other shared hosting providers. Here now, we’d like to present you extra detailed information about their features.

These three hosting packages include 10 GB, 20 GB and 30 GB web space respectively, which are mainly less than unlimited hosting. As for the capability, they are designed for web pages with different visits: StartUp package is suitable for 10,000 visits, GrowBig for 25,000 visits and GoGeek is the best option for 100,000 visits.

Apart from above mentioned features, the three packages have some more similar features like cPanel, free website domain name registration, unlimited data transfer and unmetered MySQL databases. To be straightforward, these features are simple and enough for many low traffic websites. But we think website owners can get more resources, benefits and better services at the same price.

Summary

SiteGround is a serious challenger in the 'premium' WordPress hosting and shared hosting segment. With world class-leading features, benefits, excellent performance, stunning server uptime, and helpful tech support, they're an ideal option for newbies and pros alike, and that is the reason why the Internet is filled with many positive SiteGround reviews from hundreds of real users.
