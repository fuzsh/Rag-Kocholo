SiteGround Hosting Plans

SiteGround offers a variety of optimized WordPress hosting plans to meet different needs. Their plans can be grouped into three main categories:

Shared Hosting

Shared hosting is SiteGround’s most popular and affordable WordPress hosting option. With shared hosting, your website shares server resources with other sites. SiteGround offers three shared hosting plans:

StartUp — This basic plan supports one website and provides 10GB of web space. It’s a good choice for new sites with low traffic.

GrowBig — The GrowBig plan supports unlimited websites and provides 20GB of space. It includes some advanced caching features making it a good choice for most small businesses.

GoGeek — The top shared hosting plan includes everything in GrowBig plus advanced features like Git integration, staging environments, and white label client reporting that are useful for web agencies and developers.

Shared hosting is cost effective and can easily handle most standard WordPress sites. However, if you need more resources it may make sense to upgrade to cloud hosting.

Cloud Hosting

SiteGround’s managed cloud hosting plans offer more power and flexibility for larger, more complex sites. Resources are allocated on demand from Google Cloud infrastructure. SiteGround’s cloud plans include features like unlimited databases and email accounts. Cloud hosting is recommended for sites with very high traffic volumes or sites running intensive workloads.

Reseller Hosting

SiteGround’s reseller hosting options allow you to resell SiteGround’s hosting services. This can be attractive for web designers, developers, agencies, and others who want to provide hosting to clients. Reseller plans include whitelabeling capabilities, client management tools, and tiered pricing levels.

Cloud Hosting

SiteGround’s managed cloud hosting plans offer more power and resources compared to their shared hosting options. Cloud hosting is ideal for websites with complex infrastructure or that experience high traffic volumes.

Cloud Hosting Use Cases

Managed Cloud Hosting offers more resources and power compared to shared hosting plans. It is useful for certain types of websites and use cases:

Complex or high traffic sites: Cloud hosting is ideal if your site has complex functionality, gets significant traffic, or experiences usage spikes. The extra resources can easily handle the demands. For example, a site with hundreds of thousands of daily visitors, an ecommerce store during a holiday sale, or web apps with intensive backend processes.

Mission critical sites: If your website is business critical, cloud hosting provides extra reliability and uptime. The distributed infrastructure means if one node goes down your site stays online. This prevents downtime from affecting revenue or operations.

Sites needing flexibility: With cloud hosting you can scale resources like RAM and CPU cores up or down on demand. This flexibility lets you adjust to changing needs. It’s perfect if your resource needs fluctuate.

Developers and agencies: Developers can spin up staging environments to test new features safely. Agencies use cloud hosting to manage multiple client sites efficiently. The scalability suits development and agency workflows well.

So in summary, if your site is complex, high traffic, business critical, needs flexibility, or you’re a developer/agency, managed cloud hosting is a great choice. The extra power and resources provide benefits over shared hosting plans.

Reseller Hosting

SiteGround’s reseller hosting plans allow you to resell SiteGround’s hosting services to your own clients. This is useful if you run a web design agency or provide web hosting services.

With a reseller account, you can create hosting accounts for clients under your own brand. You purchase hosting resources from SiteGround at wholesale prices, then sell the accounts to your customers at a markup.

Some key things to know about SiteGround’s reseller hosting:

Choosing the Right Plan

When choosing the right SiteGround plan, there are a few key factors to consider:

Traffic Levels — How much traffic do you expect your site(s) to receive each month? The shared hosting plans have monthly visit recommendations that can help guide your choice. If you need to support higher traffic volumes, consider upgrading to cloud hosting.

Number of Sites — The StartUp plan only supports one website. For multiple sites, you’ll need the GrowBig or GoGeek plan. GoGeek allows for unlimited websites.

Performance Needs — Do you just need simple shared hosting, or more power and resources from cloud hosting? Shared plans are good for most use cases, but complex or high traffic sites may benefit from upgraded cloud hosting.

Agency Usage — For web agencies and developers, the GoGeek plan has useful tools like staging, git access, and white labeling client sites. It’s optimized for agency needs.

Reselling Services — If your goal is to resell SiteGround hosting services, their reseller hosting plans are purpose-built for this. You can easily manage client accounts.

Consider your specific needs in terms of traffic, sites, performance, and features. In most cases, GrowBig is a good starting point. But be sure to choose the plan that aligns closest with your goals.

GrowBig Starting Point

The GrowBig shared hosting plan is a good starting point for most SiteGround users. It provides a nice balance of features, resources, and value.

Some key reasons the GrowBig plan is recommended for many users:

Allows unlimited websites which is useful for developers, agencies, or anyone with multiple sites. The StartUp plan only supports 1 site.

Cloud Hosting for Power

SiteGround’s cloud hosting plans are ideal when you need more resources and computing power than their standard shared hosting can provide.

The key reasons you may want to upgrade to cloud hosting include:

High Traffic Sites — If your site is getting a lot of visitors, the cloud plans provide more resources to handle the load. This prevents slow downs.

Complex Sites — If you have a site with complex functionality, a cloud server will provide faster performance. Things like ecommerce stores benefit.

Resource Intensive Apps — If you are running resource heavy apps or scripts on your site, cloud hosting provides more RAM and CPU to keep things running smoothly.

Frequent Traffic Spikes — If your traffic is prone to large spikes due to events, news mentions, etc, cloud hosting can scale to meet demand.

So in summary, if your shared hosting plan starts to feel constrained due to traffic, complexity or functionality, upgrading to SiteGround’s cloud hosting will provide the extra resources and power needed. Their cloud plans utilize Google Cloud infrastructure for optimal speed and uptime.
