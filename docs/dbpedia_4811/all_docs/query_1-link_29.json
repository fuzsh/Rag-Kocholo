        "text": "The Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and PROTECT IP Act (PIPA) have found broad support from organizations that rely on copyright, including the Motion Picture Association of America,[1] the Recording Industry Association of America,[1] Macmillan Publishers, Viacom, and various other companies and unions in the cable, movie, and music industries.\n\nOn 22 December 2011, Lamar Smith, the bill's sponsor, released a list of 142 organizations that support SOPA on the House Judiciary Committee's website.[2] Other lists have been released by the organizations themselves.\n\nFollowing the list's original release, it was updated multiple times. As of the morning of 29 December 2011, the official list had 18 fewer supporters, including only 124 of the original 142 supporters. The growing publicity of this list on websites such as Reddit resulted in what might be referred to as a public relations disaster for some of the supporters listed. Arguably the first and most prominent case regarded GoDaddy.com, a popular internet domain registrar and web hosting company which openly supported SOPA. GoDaddy sustained significant losses, losing over 72,000 domains in less than one week, as a result of a proposed boycott of their services, pending it renounce its support of SOPA. GoDaddy has since announced that it \"no longer supports SOPA legislation,\" then amended that statement to \"GoDaddy OPPOSES SOPA.\"[3]\n\nOrganizations supporting SOPA\n\n[edit]\n\nOrganizations that support the Stop Online Piracy Act include:[2]\n\nNote: 125 Organizations are listed.\n\nRemoved supporting organizations\n\n[edit]\n\nOrganizations that have had their names removed from the list of supporters of the Stop Online Piracy Act include:\n\nNote: 27 organizations are listed. (based on comparison between original 142 count list and current list as of 29 December 2011).\n\nOrganizations opposing SOPA\n\n[edit]\n\nNote: 224 Organizations are listed.\n\nFor a complete list, see http://www.sopastrike.com/on-strike/\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nInternet portal\n\nEnglish Wikipedia blackout\n\nFreedom of information\n\nList of US Congresspersons who support or oppose SOPA/PIPA\n\nTrans-Pacific Partnership"
