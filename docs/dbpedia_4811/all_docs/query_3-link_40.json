        "text": "Hi,\n\nI‚Äôve been monitoring a behavior on 3 WordPress sites I host on SiteGround over the last couple of months. Every time I make plugin or theme updates through ManageWP (my standard way of updating sites), ARQ gets turned off during the process. So, I need to log into each site and turn ARQ back on manually. Granted, this isn‚Äôt a lot of work, but it‚Äôs just curious that this happens at all.\n\nI have about 15 other WordPress sites (mostly hosted on GoDaddy Managed WordPress) and this same behavior doesn‚Äôt occur on those sites (surprise!).\n\nAny idea how I can troubleshoot this or what could be causing this?\n\nAlso, this morning during updates, when ARQ turned off on one of those SiteGround sites in particular, I received 37 ‚ÄúBPS Pro Alert: AutoRestore is turned Off‚Äù emails within a matter of 7 minutes for that one website. Not sure what happened there either‚Ä¶\n\nUpdate: On that same site, I actually just noticed that ARQ remained ‚ÄúPending‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúOff‚Äù and I had to run the Setup Wizards in order for it to turn back on. Usually, for these SiteGround sites, after updates I get the ‚ÄúBPS Pro Alert: AutoRestore is turned Off‚Äù email for each site, then I log into each site, find ARQ ‚ÄúOff‚Äù, and simply turn it back on.\n\nThank you so much!\n\nJutta\n\nNormal AutoRestore functionality is that ARQ is automatically turned Off during plugin and theme upgrades for up to 3 minutes (average ARQ Off time is between 30 ‚Äì 60 seconds), a Pending Status for ARQ is shown in the BPS Pro Dashboard Status Display and then a Cron Job is run after ARQ file backup has occurred and ARQ is automatically turned back On. If you have disabled/altered or changed WordPress Standard Crons then the BPS Pro ARQ Cron Job that automatically turns ARQ back On will probably not work or work correctly.\n\nSo logically the problem has something to do with the BPS Pro ARQ Cron Job that automatically turns ARQ back On is being interfered with by something. Not sure what why you received 37 email alerts in 7 minutes. The email alerts are coded to be sent once every 5 minutes. That problem is probably related to whatever is interfering with the BPS Pro ARQ Cron Job that automatically turns ARQ back On.\n\nAre you doing anything with WP Standard Default Cron Jobs in your wp-config.php file or anywhere else (Plugin or other code somewhere)? Does SiteGround disable WP Standard Default Cron Jobs?\n\n@ AITpro Admin yes definitely now i‚Äôm sure i have a problem\n\nbps corn jobs doesn‚Äôt execute automatically hence other plugin‚Äôs like woocommerce exchange rate and other wp-corns are executed normally on time\n\ni noticed that some of my plugins js and php files are blocked from frontend\n\nu check bps auto whitelist and i found that it‚Äôs never done it‚Äôs job http://prntscr.com/izfblr even when i set it to run each 1 min\n\nthose times never changed since i tried to run auto-wizard and after that i tried to run whitelist test mod,\n\nany suggestions?\n\nalso i think this forum have a mailing problem as i didn‚Äôt recive any e mails when you replay back üôÅ\n\nThe Plugin Firewall AutoPilot Mode also runs using a Standard WordPress Cron. So I guess that Cron Job is also being broken/not running/not working.\n\nSuggestions: Use WordPress Standard Crons and do not disable them or use Direct Crons instead. If you want to continue to use Direct Crons then I guess you would need to figure out why they are not working on your server/website. You can also not use some BPS Pro security features like: ARQ IDPS or the Plugin Firewall, etc.\n\nThe forum sends automated emails. The forum emails are working normally. If you are not receiving the automated forum emails then either they are being sent to your Junk or Spam email folder or your server has anti-spam software such as Spam Assassin installed, which is known to reject/block about 40% of good/legitimate automated emails. Contact your web host support folks and ask them not to block/reject automated emails.\n\nhello again,\n\ngood day!\n\nyes indeed i‚Äôm using direct corn from external services called easycorn.com and i setup a corn job task to trigger wp-corn every min on that link https://mywebsite.com/wp-cron.php?doing_wp_cron\n\nand it did trigger successfully according to easycorn logs and as per other plugin corn tasks like woocommerce exchange rate that required to be updated every hour and yes i receive emails every hour that the rate is successfully updated via api call\n\nhere in bps it‚Äôs not doing it‚Äôs corn but if i enabled embeded wp corn calls again via wp-config true, it works normally,\n\nso i think it‚Äôs an issue with the plugin corn job as it‚Äôs not triggered via external calls can you please check it\n\neasycorn.com can provide free accounts to test same as corn-job.org\n\ni‚Äôll do further testing on another test site to demonstrate the issue and come with a feed back\n\ndear aitPRO,\n\nthanks for taking care of this ticket, but it‚Äôs my website issue as i tested it on a fresh install test site, and it worked as expected\n\nhence i was digging further, and i came to know that my wp-corn.php calls was cached with my server caching so it wasn‚Äôt triggered at all\n\nwhat makes me though that exchange rate was triggered as it was triggered by a different url call via ajax-admin.php call\n\ni solved it from easy corn by adding the follow placeholder which puts a random numbers each wp-corn call\n\nlike that https://mywebsite.com/wp-cron.php?doing_wp_cron?__RANDOM__\n\nthank you and sorry for your time\n\nit‚Äôs always a pleasure to have a conversation with you and as Always have a great day!\n\nThe last time we checked ManageWP and BPS Pro ARQ compatibility was about a year ago and plugin updates from ManageWP worked fine with ARQ. See this forum topic for more information: https://forum.ait-pro.com/forums/topic/managewp-read-me-first/. It is always possible that something has changed with ManageWP and how it does plugin updates remotely. Previously both ManageWP and BPS Pro hook into the WordPress Upgrader classes. So when ManageWP updated a plugin then it triggers the WordPress Upgrader class, which in turn triggers ARQ. One person in the forum link above mentioned they were doing some kind of bulk upgrade using ManageWP that was causing problems. Maybe the issue has to do with something like that?"
