        "text": "SiteGround is primarily known for its affordable, entry-level plans. It‚Äôs a popular choice among bloggers and new website owners. However, as a developer, you have unique needs. So, you may be looking for a SiteGround review that focuses on this provider‚Äôs more advanced features.\n\nIf that‚Äôs the case, you‚Äôve come to the right place. Below, we‚Äôve put together a review that highlights SiteGround‚Äôs potential as a developer-friendly host. With the following information under your belt, you‚Äôll be able to decide whether this host is the right fit for your web development needs.\n\nIn our SiteGround review, we‚Äôll take a closer look at this hosting provider‚Äôs key features for developers. We‚Äôll also analyze its performance and scalability. Let‚Äôs get started! üé¨\n\nüìö Table of contents:\n\nAn overview of SiteGround\n\nKey features of SiteGround\n\nSiteGround‚Äôs performance tools\n\nSiteGround‚Äôs server stack and scalability\n\nThe pros and cons of using SiteGround as a WordPress developer\n\nAn overview of SiteGround ‚åõ\n\nSiteGround has been around since 2004. Over the years, it has built a reputation as a beginner-friendly host with affordable plans. In fact, SiteGround‚Äôs hosting plans start at just $2.99 per month.\n\nHowever, the company has significantly expanded its services over the last few years, and it now caters to both WordPress newbies and pros. It even offers solutions for web developers who manage multiple projects or client sites.\n\nAs you‚Äôll see in our SiteGround review, this company has come a long way from being a basic solution for WordPress bloggers. It now rivals other web host giants like WP Engine in terms of scalability and performance.\n\nTo help you determine whether it‚Äôs the right host for your own web development projects, we‚Äôll begin by looking at the features it offers in more detail.\n\nKey features of SiteGround ‚öôÔ∏è\n\nLet‚Äôs start with the most essential features. SiteGround‚Äôs hosting plans come with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates, a Content Delivery Network (CDN), and a free email account. You‚Äôll also get daily backups and WordPress updates.\n\nüëâ Next up in our SiteGround review, let‚Äôs look at what this provider has to offer when it comes to web development specifically:\n\nGit integration. If you opt for the SiteGround GoGeek plans, you‚Äôll get Git preinstalled on your servers. You can use this feature to create repositories of the most popular applications, including WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal, using a visual interface.\n\nStaging environment. With the GrowBig and GoGeek plans, you‚Äôll get access to one-click staging environments. This makes it easy to experiment with new designs and functionality on a test site before pushing your changes to go live.\n\nWhite labeling. On the GoGeek plan, you can register your clients as users in your hosting account. This way, you can give them access to the Site Tools for their websites (more on this later).\n\nWP-CLI access. This comes preinstalled on all plans, and you can use it to manage plugins, configure multisite installations, and more.\n\nPHP control. You can easily change the PHP version of each site in your account.\n\nAll those features are neatly available from the SiteGround user panel:\n\nAnother great thing about SiteGround is that it offers tools to facilitate collaboration. For example, you can add another developer or a client as a collaborator on a project.\n\nHowever, it‚Äôs important to note that most of these developer-friendly tools are only available with the GrowBig and GoGeek plans. These services are designed for businesses, agencies, and professionals such as web developers.\n\nIn addition, you‚Äôll get a bespoke security plugin that‚Äôs designed to help protect your site against threats:\n\nThis tool helps you make your site safer by disabling XML-RPC, limiting login attempts, enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) for users, and more. You‚Äôll also have access to a detailed activity log, so you can monitor your site‚Äôs visitors and identify suspicious activities.\n\nNote that this plugin is also available to non-SiteGround users (although other hosts may have their own security solutions).\n\nNow, let‚Äôs take a close look at SiteGround‚Äôs Site Tools. This is a dashboard that lets you manage almost every aspect of your site. Essentially, it serves as a replacement for cPanel.\n\nüëâ Each site you create will have its own Site Tools. This enables you to:\n\nInstall and remove applications\n\nManage subdomains and parked domains\n\nCreate new email accounts, forwarders, autoresponders, and filters\n\nBack up and restore your site\n\nAccess FTP accounts\n\nMonitor your site‚Äôs traffic\n\nInstall SSL certificates\n\nEnable caching and a CDN\n\nManage PHP versions, configure PHP variables, block IPs, and more\n\nAdditionally, Site Tools features a navigation panel that conveniently groups all the tools you need into different areas, such as Domain, Security, Email, and Statistics. There‚Äôs also a Devs section, where you‚Äôll find Git, Cron Jobs, PHP Manager, App Installer, and other handy tools. You can pin the tools that you use frequently to the top of the dashboard for easier access.\n\nAs you can see, Site Tools is possibly easier to navigate than cPanel, which tends to list all the tools on the same page. Plus, it enables you to easily switch between sites. All you have to do is select the Change button in the toolbar. After you choose a site, you‚Äôll be directed to the Site Tools dashboard of that website.\n\nIt‚Äôs also worth noting that you can give other users access to the Site Tools. For example, you can add another developer as a collaborator and specify which tools they have access to (e.g., cron jobs, PHP manager, etc.).\n\nBy default, the Site Tools dashboard has SiteGround branding. However, you can give white-label access to your clients. This enables them to manage their sites without seeing the SiteGround logo.\n\nIn the next part of our SiteGround review, we‚Äôll be looking at performance and optimization.\n\nAs a web developer, you‚Äôll want to make sure your clients‚Äô sites are hosted on optimized servers. An unreliable hosting service can spell disaster for your business.\n\nWith that in mind, we‚Äôve run some tests to see how SiteGround fares in terms of performance. The first piece of good news is that SiteGround always has a great uptime record.\n\nSiteGround uses Google Cloud‚Äôs SSD persistent storage. This means that if one hosting server fails, the site‚Äôs data can be rendered on another machine.\n\nWe also tested the loading times on servers in different parts of the world. These were the results:\n\nWhile the times vary, they are all below a couple of seconds. This is a strong result. Note that we used the StartUp package for our test. If you opt for a higher-tier plan, you might get better results.\n\nBy default, SiteGround enables NGINX Direct Delivery for all sites in order to facilitate faster loading times. If you opt for a GrowBig plan or higher, you‚Äôll also get access to Memcached, which can further boost your site‚Äôs performance.\n\nThis provider also has its own optimization plugin, SiteGround Optimizer:\n\nWith this tool, you‚Äôll get access to various caching solutions to help reduce the Time To First Byte (TTFB) on your sites. These include file-based caching, dynamic caching, and object caching.\n\nüëâ The plugin offers other features to help boost your site‚Äôs performance, including:\n\nHTML, CSS & JavaScript minification\n\nImage compression and lazy loading\n\nGZIP compression\n\nScheduled database maintenance\n\nIt‚Äôs also worth mentioning that SiteGround has a custom PHP implementation that‚Äôs designed to further reduce TTFB. This setup uses less memory and enables the server to process a high volume of queries in record time. This feature is available on GrowBig plans and higher.\n\nSiteGround‚Äôs server stack and scalability üíªÔ∏è\n\nIn the final part of our SiteGround review, we‚Äôll be looking at scalability and server configuration.\n\nIf you work with multiple clients, you‚Äôll likely be interested in reseller packages and cloud hosting plans. That‚Äôs because these solutions typically enable you to add additional resources as needed.\n\nSo, let‚Äôs start by exploring SiteGround‚Äôs cloud hosting service:\n\nThis plan comes with an auto-scale option, which means you‚Äôll automatically get more resources when a site experiences unexpected traffic spikes. This can help prevent downtime due to overload. However, you can also add CPU and RAM at any time, depending on your needs.\n\nWith a cloud account, you can create custom hosting packages for your clients. You‚Äôll be able to select the resources allocated to each individual website and choose the site management tools that can be accessed by the client.\n\nCloud hosting is also available with reseller packages:\n\nThis service enables you to manage all of your sites from a single dashboard, and easily add new sites with a few clicks. Plus, if you need more hosting resources for your web development business, you can add more CPU and RAM to your cloud.\n\nAs with the hosting plans, you can specify which site tools your client has access to. You‚Äôll also be able to define the amount of hosting space, email accounts, and databases for each client site.\n\nIf you cater to a global audience, you might be interested to know that SiteGround has a built-in CDN service with multiple servers across the globe. This includes locations in Australia, Europe, the United States, and Asia. What this means is that your clients‚Äô sites should load quickly for the majority of visitors, no matter their location.\n\nThe pros and cons of using SiteGround as a WordPress developer üëçüëé\n\nüëâ If you‚Äôre still not sure whether SiteGround is the right hosting provider for you, let‚Äôs look at a few pros and cons. First, the pros:\n\nIts user-friendly dashboard makes it easy to manage sites and access dev tools\n\nYou can collaborate with other developers while maintaining complete control over the project\n\nYour clients will be able to access their site‚Äôs back end without seeing the SiteGround branding (they‚Äôll even have a white-labeled login URL)\n\nIt offers decent loading times (based on our tests)\n\nPerhaps the main con of using SiteGround is the pricing. While the plans look affordable in the beginning, there‚Äôs a big spike in prices upon renewal.\n\nFor example, the StartUp reseller plan starts at $4.99 per month but goes up to nearly $24.99 per month when renewed. Similarly, the GoGeek WordPress plan starts at $7.99 per month and then $39.99 per month upon renewal.\n\nTherefore, if you have a small pool of clients, these plans may not be very cost-effective. However, it‚Äôs worth noting that offering super-discounted deals for new users is common practice for the majority of hosting providers. Meaning, it‚Äôs always more useful to pay attention to prices after the introductory promo period ends.\n\nConclusion of this SiteGround review üßê\n\nSiteGround is one of the top hosting providers for WordPress blogs. However, this company can also be a powerful host for your web development projects. It offers plans that are designed to boost performance and facilitate collaboration.\n\nIn our SiteGround review, we looked at some of this web host‚Äôs key features for web developers, such as Git integration, staging, and white labeling. While the most basic options are a bit limited, the cloud hosting and reseller plans are perfect for managing multiple client sites as well as configuring settings and permissions for individual projects."
