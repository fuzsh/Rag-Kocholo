        "text": "I would definitely **NOT** recommend A2. They do great job on marketing but their cPanel based servers are crap, I mean terrible. I had Wordpress websites hosted on Dreamhost with great speed. Reading A2, I thought it will be much better with their so called super-duper-crazy-ass server technology. At the end, it was cheap cPanel based server that caused me tons of headache. They would shut down my account claiming my websites got all hacked. When I was at Dreamhost, my sites would be attacked but hardly get hacked. Website speed was impacted very negatively. Normally first byte time from Dreamhost was around 300ms, after A2, it became around 900ms. I was paying for their premium package that comes with SSD and less loaded servers.\n\nTLDR; I would definitely stay away from A2.\n\nHas anyone used Fastcomet Hosting?\n\nI've been using their shared server ecommerce plan for about a year and am very happy with it. I only have about 50 products so server speed is not critical. The only thing I ever had a problem with them was with mail. The email server was blacklisted because one of the users used it to send spam. Apparently that's a big problem with most everyone's shared server plans. But, the tech guided me on how to change mail over to a free rackspace email server and I haven't had a problem since.\n\nI have been using A2 for over a year now, 6 months on a VPS and 9 months on a Elite Dedicated server or whatever they call it. I have thoroughly enjoyed their services. I don't have to wait forever to speak with someone and they know what they are doing. I have only had one issue with them, which they fixed and made right in a big way. If you are looking for a company who will take care of you I would suggest A2, I have used hostgator, bluehost (years ago) and west host (years ago as well). A2 has been the best so far, the last thing i want when i have an issue or need help is to wait on hold, or wait for my ticket to be \"escalated\". They do a good job a prioritizing issues.\n\nBonus: There is a Irish fella who has great travel tips on Dublin & a kick@ss accent. Just sayin. Seriously though, I'm a big fan of em. Friendly service and you will more than likely get someone who knows you after a few months with them as it seems to be a smaller company, I would recommend them, trying to get my boss to switch to them from hostgator. Being from the southern United States I am a big fan of \"hospitality\" and I feel like A2 gives you that, in a hosting way."
