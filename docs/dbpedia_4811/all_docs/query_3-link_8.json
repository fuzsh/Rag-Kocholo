If you don’t have a host already, it’s usually what we recommend.\n\nWe understand that not everyone is tech-savvy. That’s why we wrote this guide to help.\n\nWe’ll set up and create your site for you. However, we won’t make your account. This isn’t a lazy decision: it’s to give you ownership.\n\nWhy Won’t EpiBuild Do It?\n\nWe do almost everything for you, but we don’t do everything. That’s for one simple reason: we want you to own your site.\n\nMany web developer scammers say they’ll take care of everything. But that means they own everything. They’re paying the bills and the site is in their name. So if they want to hold your site hostage, they can. And if you walk away from them, you might not get to take the site with you.\n\nWe don’t do that. You own the domain and the site. Even if you leave us, it’s all yours.\n\nThus, it needs your info.\n\nStep 1: Choose Plan\n\nGo to SiteGround and choose WordPress hosting. It’ll offer you 3 plans.\n\nIn most cases, you can start with the cheapest plan. You can always upgrade later if you want more features.\n\nStep 2: Choose Domain\n\nNext, enter your domain.\n\nWhat is that? A “domain” is just the name of the site. For example, our domain is epibuild.com. Google’s domain is google.com. It’s what people type or click when they want to find your website.\n\nDo You Have a Domain Yet?\n\nIf you didn’t buy a domain yet, then you need to register a new one. Click “Register a New Domain.” Type in the domain you want and select an extension, like .com, .org, or .net. Registering the domain will have a fee.\n\nIf you already bought a domain from someone else, then you can tell SiteGround the domain name you own. (Don’t worry about getting them to talk to each other. If you give us the login info for both SiteGround and the site you used for your domain, we’ll take care of that for you.)\n\nStep 3: Review & Complete\n\nNow is the part that we can’t do for you. You need to put in your info.\n\nFirst, give it your email address and make a password. This is info that we’ll need you to share with us later so we can get in. We recommend coming up with a unique password and writing it down so you don’t forget.\n\nNext, put in your address and phone number.\n\nAfter that, you need credit card info. Do not give this to us.* It’s between you and SiteGround. (If you are in a zoom meeting with one of our team members, we’ll encourage you to pause screen sharing.)\n\n*We trust our team, but we don’t need or want this info. Please only give your credit card info to trusted vendors.\n\nNext, review your plan. Say how many months you want to pay for upfront. If you plan to still have your site in a year, then paying for a year is fine.\n\nNow, look through the extra services it offers.\n\nDomain registration should be checked if you’re buying a new domain.\n\nDomain privacy is optional. Usually, people can look online to see who owns a domain. If you don’t like this, you can pay for extra privacy.\n\nSG Site Scanner helps with security. We will install security plugins and make backups for you. It’s up to you if you want to pay for this extra feature.\n\nAgree to the terms of service and you’re ready to go.\n\nYour SiteGround Site is Yours\n\nThis is what you need to do to make things clear that you own the site. However, after that, we can handle the details. We would be happy to:\n\nPoint your domain if you got it from another site\n\nSet up SSL, weekly backups, and security\n\nHandle your analytics and share them with you\n\nAnd more\n\nThose are our job. We just need the account in your name.\n\nIf you need extra help setting up, you can meet with one of our specialists via Zoom. We’ll help you share your screen so we can guide you through it.\n\nWe want to give you the best site you can get. Part of that is making sure that it’s your site.\n\nby Jenna Breunig"
