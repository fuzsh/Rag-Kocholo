        "text": "SiteGround Review\n\nMost Popular Choice Among WordPress Users\n\nIn 2004, a small team of IT experts got together to create SiteGround as a substitute to using the hosts that they had experienced as regular customers in the hosting marketplace. SiteGround is a privately-owned company. SiteGround has few offices in Bulgaria and Spain. SiteGround mainly focus on providing web hosting for individuals and small size businesses.\n\nHaving been in the industry for 15 years, SiteGround has been known as one of the best web hosting companies. So, is it good enough for hosting websites? The answer for this question can be found in the following detailed review we made on the price, feature, uptime, reliability, technical support and other features of its hosting service.\n\nVisit SiteGround\n\nSiteGround Hosting - General Overview\n\nSiteGround Pricing & Getting Started with\n\nGetting started with SiteGround is easy and simple. The major advantage is that they actually allow you to buy a web hosting account for the price they advertise – only at $6.99. In spite of other hosting providers you can buy your hosting account for one, two or three years for the same low price.\n\nSiteground offers Shared, Cloud, Dedicated Hosting as well as Reseller hosting at most affordable cost. All of the web hosting packages are available at Siteground based on Linux platform. Siteground also providers eCommerce solutions for the users planning to set-up their ecommerce website or online store.\n\nAll hosting packages come with free web design tools, a free SSL, SSD Storage and unlimited email accounts.\n\n➟ StartUp: $6.99/mo. regular price $14.99/mo (Flat 60%) designed for a Great Web Start. This is the basic shared hosting plan at Siteground and Comes with 10GB Server Web Space. You can host single website and Suitable for ~ 10,000 Visits Monthly.\n\n➟ GrowBig: $9.99/mo. regularly $24.99 (flat 60% off).

All you need to do is decide your desired plan and follow the registration procedure.\n\nBut there are few items that can increase the cost. If your selected package contains any addons such as Domain Privacy, Website Backup, Smart Scan, HackAlert Monitoring, it would turn out to be paying much more compared to the normal rates.\n\nAll of these features are amazing, but make sure to include the features that you really required and useful for you if you don’t want to spend more money.\n\nOnce your account setup is complete, you should receive a confirmation e-mail containing with everything you want to know about your new hosting account in it. It is well structured as well as informative. Last but not least they provide you with a nice Getting Started tutorial that will tell you how to begin creating your website.\n\nPros of Using SiteGround Hosting\n\nEvery single hosting service providers has its very own advantages as well as disadvantages. A few of the benefits can put drawbacks on the back burner, on the other hand, few disadvantages can be a major issue for your individual requirements.\n\nBefore settling on a final decision, it ic must for you to read the pros of using SiteGround hosting.\n\nSiteGround gives solid uptime of 99.99% with amazing speeds as well as loads of additional features that are ideal choice for everyone.\n\nGiven below are few of the pros of SiteGround hosting that make it one of the best in class hosting service providers around the globe including India.\n\nHigh Class Customer Support: SiteGround offer one of the best customer support in the industry which is accessible 24/7 via live chat, telephone, ticket system.\n\nOutstanding Server Speed: Each and every servers at SiteGround are exceptionally well optimized to deliver excellent speed. Their servers are outfitted with most recent available hardware/tools such as SSD powered drives for storage and custom designed software to ensure that your site/blog is very quick to load.\n\nFree SSL Certificate & CDN: Each and every hosting service offered by SiteGround comes with free SSL/HTTPS & CDN from Cloudflare to enhance the security of your site.\n\nFree cPanel & SSH: Each hosting plan include free cPanel control panel and SSH access.\n\nMultiple Server Locations: You will have the option to choose from the multiple server locations because SiteGround's servers are located in multiple locations including Singapore (Asia), Chicago (USA), Amsterdam (Netherlands) and London (UK). You can opt your preferred data center location account sign up.\n\nFree Site Migration: SiteGround offer free Website Migration on GrowBig and GoGeek hosting plans.\n\nCons of Using SiteGround Hosting\n\nAs I stated above, each hosting service has few drawbacks. So below I am going to share few of the cons of using SiteGround hosting.\n\nLimited Space for cheapest plan: Hosting packages offered by SiteGround come with fixed amount of storage, anyway the available amount of storage space is very huge and in case you are in the starting stage, you will never find yourself out of storage.\n\nHuge Setup fee for Month to Month Hosting Billing: If you are planning to sign up monthly hosting plan, you will be charged $14.95 as setup fee, which is quite high. However if you opt for longer billing cycle, you will huge discount along with 30 days money back guarantee. Therefore it is highly recommended to opt longer billing cycle so that you can save more.\n\nLack of Free Domain Name: Numerous of hosting companies like Bluehost, Hostinger, iPage offer freebies to draw attention of new customers. A free domain name is offered by almost every top web hosts for atleast one year, (Bluehost offer free Domain for 1 year) but unluckily SiteGround does not offer domain for free with hosting packages.\n\nSiteGround Uptime and Reliability\n\nOne of our team member have an account with SiteGround is using to host a personal web page. He maintains it for around 2 years now. During that time he has faced downtime twice, for less than 20 minutes each. In those situations there were scheduled server maintenance and he was warned many times for it – a week before the date, 3-4 days before and 3-4 hours before the actual server downtime. SiteGround stated that they are relocating their servers to a faster and modern platform which was the cause of the website downtime in both cases. Other than this he did not experience any other server related troubles with them.\n\nSiteGround Uptime Statistics 2023 - 2024\n\nLast 12 months uptime details of SiteGround\n\nJuly (2022) average uptime: 99.99%\n\nJune (2022) average uptime: 99.98%\n\nMay (2022) average uptime: 100%\n\nApril (2022) average uptime: 99.99%\n\nFebruary (2022) average uptime: 100%\n\nJanuary (2022) average uptime: 99.99%\n\nDecember (2021) average uptime: 99.9%\n\nNovember (2021) average uptime: 99.99%\n\nOctober (2021) average uptime: 99.99%\n\nSeptember (2021) average uptime: 99.99%\n\nAugust (2020) average uptime: 99.98%\n\nJuly (2021) average uptime: 99.99%\n\nServer Response Time of SiteGround (2024)\n\nThe content you add to your website create huge effect on the loading time of your page. To give an instance, on the off chance that you have added high definition/resolution images or videos on a page of your site or blog, at that point those HD contents will considerably expand the entire loading time of the page.\n\nIn other terms the results you get from speed test may not correctly show how speedy and prompt your web hosting India service actually is. As opposed to testing page loading speed individually, here at UpdatedReviews we made a decision to analyse the real web server response time also.\n\nTo made this possible we make use of Bitcatcha server speed testing tool. One of the unique thing about this tool is that it just analyze the server response time and overlooks the content of a page. At the same time this tool shows the average loading time of a site from various locations all over the world.\n\nGiven below is the screenshot of the results:\n\nAs you have seen, SiteGround is an outstanding option in case you are going to target the USA based audience. The server response time for the USA outstanding just 12 ms. Also in case you are planning to target Indian audience then you can happily go with SiteGround since their server response time for India is quite good just 65ms. The overall server response for all locations is quite good.\n\nTechnical Support\n\nTech support is something people really don’t expect to worry about when they’re actually in the process of choosing service providers. They usually recognize their fault the very first time they try to get somebody on the phone in order to converse about an issue or trouble.\n\nIt’s actually fairly notable that support at Siteground is pretty much unbeatable! Because, they’re really great at answering your questions or queries before you purchase a package. But they remain equally helpful once you’re actually a customer. They provide support in three formats- live chat, telephone support and ticket system.\n\nSiteGround Features Review\n\nSiteGround has three types of shared hosting packages, including StartUp, GrowBig and GoGeek. The three packages are much more costly when compared with most other shared hosting providers. Here now, we’d like to present you extra detailed information about their features.\n\nThese three hosting packages include 10 GB, 20 GB and 30 GB web space respectively, which are mainly less than unlimited hosting. As for the capability, they are designed for web pages with different visits: StartUp package is suitable for 10,000 visits, GrowBig for 25,000 visits and GoGeek is the best option for 100,000 visits.\n\nApart from above mentioned features, the three packages have some more similar features like cPanel, free website domain name registration, unlimited data transfer and unmetered MySQL databases. To be straightforward, these features are simple and enough for many low traffic websites. But we think website owners can get more resources, benefits and better services at the same price.\n\nSummary\n\nSiteGround is a serious challenger in the 'premium' WordPress hosting and shared hosting segment. With world class-leading features, benefits, excellent performance, stunning server uptime, and helpful tech support, they're an ideal option for newbies and pros alike, and that is the reason why the Internet is filled with many positive SiteGround reviews from hundreds of real users.\n\nSpecial Offer: Siteground Coupon Codes- Avail flat 60% OFF on Web Hosting + Free SSL & Site builder."
