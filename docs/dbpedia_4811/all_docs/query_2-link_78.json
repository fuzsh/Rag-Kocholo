        "text": "When choosing the fastest WordPress hosting provider for your website, speed is a crucial factor to consider. A slow website can negatively impact your website’s performance in several ways. Firstly, a slow-loading website could lead to losing potential customers, a risk no business owner wants to take. High bounce rates, as measured by website metrics, often indicate a slow-loading website.\n\nAdditionally, a slow website can hurt your search engine rankings. Google uses core web vitals such as speed index, time to first byte (TTFL), and more to evaluate the quality of websites and determine their placement on search engine results pages (SERPs).\n\nBecause of these factors, ensuring your website loads quickly is crucial to avoid these common problems. In this post, we’ll provide you with our top three fastest WordPress hosting providers so you can decide which company to choose. Let’s dive in.\n\nThe Key Factors That Define the Fastest WordPress Hosting\n\nWhen it comes to WordPress hosting speed, several factors come into play. Firstly, the hardware running the hosting service must be top-notch. This usually includes ample amounts of RAM, high-end central processing units (CPUs), solid-state drives (SSD), or advanced technologies such as LiteSpeed, all of which work together to create a blazing-fast hosting experience.\n\nAdditionally, it’s crucial to consider whether the host employs a content delivery network (CDN), which can speed up content delivery to your site’s visitors by storing multiple copies of your files in the cloud. Lastly, the fastest web hosts typically offer speed-enhancing features such as object caching, CSS, HTML, and javascript minification, and load balancing.\n\nThe WordPress Hosting Providers We Tested\n\nAside from the three fastest WordPress hosts featured in this post, we tested a dozen other providers. While they all performed relatively well in our tests, their results weren’t as impressive as our top three.\n\nSome of the other hosts we tested were:\n\nGreen Geeks: Check out our in-depth Green Geeks review\n\nWP Engine: Check out our WP Engine managed hosting review\n\nDreamHost: Our overall best VPS hosting pick\n\nHostGator: Read our HostGator managed hosting review\n\nGoDaddy: a well-known, cheap WordPress hosting provider\n\nFlywheel: A managed WordPress host that specializes in reseller hosting\n\nHostinger: One of the best cloud hosting providers\n\nBluehost: Read our overview and review\n\nIonos (1&1): A big name in dedicated WordPress hosting\n\nKinsta: Read our review for this managed hosting provider\n\nInMotion Hosting: Read our in-depth overview for a highly-regarded budget hosting option\n\nWPX: One of the best managed WordPress hosting providers you’ve probably never heard of\n\nFor this post, we focused on the top three rather than all, primarily because we wanted to showcase scores for the highest-rated, most popular web hosts. Plus, having too many choices can be overwhelming.\n\nTo evaluate the speed of each host, we employed the WordPress Hosting Benchmark plugin. This tool, executed from within PHP, allowed us to determine the processing time of each host’s server by measuring CPU and memory speed, data retrieval time from the filesystem and database, and testing the object cache and network speed. However, we opted not to enable the object caching metric, as the plugin’s author has experienced mixed results. That said, we spoke directly with the plugin’s developer, who assured us that he’s aware of the issues with object caching and plans to address these issues in upcoming updates.\n\nAdditionally, we relied on the WordPress Hosting Performance Benchmarks website, which comprehensively assesses each host’s setup. This assessment includes load testing, uptime monitoring, K6 static testing to evaluate server caching by repeatedly testing the home page, a web page test to measure how long it takes to load the home page from 12 different global locations, and the WPPerformanceTester, which measures how many WordPress queries and PHP database operations a site can handle per second.\n\nFastest WordPress Hosting Companies\n\nAside from the two benchmarking tools we used, we also considered a couple of other factors, including the number of positive reviews and the number of features you get with their WordPress hosting plans.\n\nWithout delay, let’s dive into our top picks for the fastest WordPress hosting your hard-earned money can buy.\n\n1. SiteGround\n\n🥇 Fastest WordPress Hosting Overall\n\nComing into the top spot on our list of fastest WordPress hosts is SiteGround. Overall, the scores were quite impressive. This is primarily due to how SiteGround’s servers are configured. SiteGround offers a premium Google Cloud hosting setup customized to optimize website speed. This unique setup utilizes custom implementations of PHP and MySQL, resulting in an impressive average time to first byte (TTFL) that is 30% faster than its competitors.\n\nTo further enhance site speed, every website hosted on SiteGround comes equipped with SG Optimizer, a robust site caching plugin that provides dynamic caching to store your content on the Nginx server’s memory, enabling faster access. SiteGround also offers file-based caching, which generates static HTML versions of your site that are displayed to users. Additionally, the Memcached object caching feature stores frequently executed database queries and reuse them to speed up your site.\n\nTo top it all off, SiteGround offers minification of CSS, JavaScript, and HTML, customizable settings to fit your preferences, Brotli compression – a faster alternative to Gzip, and a free Cloudflare CDN.\n\nThese features are evident in our testing, providing some impressive scores. Let’s dive into SiteGround’s test results so you can see for yourself.\n\nWordPress Hosting Performance Benchmark Results\n\nSiteGround has impressive performance numbers, with a P95 response time of just 126ms and no HTTP failures, even when subjected to a high peak RPS of 303.75 requests per second based on 351,276 requests, good enough for the top spot on our list.\n\nThe K6 static test pushed SiteGround further with 442,044 requests. Yet, it still delivered a fantastic P95 response time of only 67ms and no HTTP failures.\n\nSiteGround’s uptime is close to perfect, hovering around 99.99%. However, its WebPageTest results were mixed. If you access a site hosted on SiteGround from the United States, London, or Germany, you’ll see a full page load in under one second. However, SiteGround struggled in other locations, such as Cape Town, Singapore, and Tokyo, with an average load time of 1.5 seconds. While not terrible, this is slower than Pressable.\n\nRegarding the WPPerformanceTester, SiteGround scored a slightly better PHP Bench result than Pressable, 10.006. However, it didn’t perform as well as Pressable in the WordPress Bench test, 1295.3.\n\nWordPress Hosting Benchmark Plugin Results\n\nFor our testing with the plugin, we used a simple setup with the Twenty Twenty-Three theme and no active plugins. Using the FakerPress plugin, we created 20 blog posts and 5 pages to simulate a simple informational website.\n\nAfter conducting five tests with the benchmarking plugin, it’s evident that SiteGround is built on a speedy infrastructure. It outperformed all other hosting providers on our list when importing large quantities of data into the database and matched them evenly in all other categories. As a result, when we combined the scores from the benchmarking website and plugin, SiteGround emerged as the undisputed champion on our list of fastest WordPress hosts.\n\nWhat We Like About SiteGround\n\nGoogle Cloud Infrastructure: SiteGround provides cloud-based hosting with servers across the world\n\nMade for WordPress: It is optimized specifically for WordPress with the latest version of PHP, Brotli compression, and custom PHP that reduces TTFL (available on Grow Big and GoGeek plans only)\n\nSpeed Enhancements: SiteGround utilizes the SG Optimizer plugin, which adds caching, image optimization, and minification of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\n\nCustom MySQL Setup: SG uses a proprietary setup to increase query speed, resulting in much-improved website performance\n\nNginx Server: SG’s servers are Nginx based, rather than using Apache, giving servers a massive speed bump\n\nFreebies: When you sign up, you’ll get a free domain for the first signup, daily backups, a free SSL and CDN\n\nWhat Could Be Improved\n\nData Storage Limitations: Lower-tiered plans only offer up to 20GB of storage, which may not be enough for larger sites\n\nRenewal Prices: SiteGround offers a great starting price for the first signup, but renewals are pricey\n\n🥇 Why We Picked It\n\nSiteGround is a blazing-favored WordPress host. They tout a high uptime rate of 99.99%, perform more than competitively in benchmark tests, and showcase consistent load time performance. On top of that, they make setting up your first WordPress website a breeze, whether you’re building a brand-new site or migrating an existing one. They include a free domain, SSL, CDN, a solid optimization plugin, and a WordPress-optimized server setup. So, if you’re in the market for a host that specializes in WordPress, SiteGround is an incredible option.\n\nWho Is SiteGround Best For?\n\nSiteGround is a great fit for those looking to balance affordability and features. With a speedy infrastructure, top-rated performance, and excellent security features, It is a fantastic option. Thanks to its long success in the business, beginners and seasoned professionals will find SiteGround a superb choice for managed WordPress hosting.\n\nCommunity Reviews And Ratings\n\nUsers praise SiteGround’s ease of use, features, and customer service. However, some state the service is more expensive than other hosts after the initial signup.\n\nPricing\n\nSiteGround offers affordable plans with prices starting at $2.99 per month.\n\n➡️ Read Our Complete SiteGround Hosting Review.\n\nGet SiteGround\n\n2. Pressable\n\n🥈 Runner-Up for the Fastest WordPress Hosting\n\nThe second host on our list, Pressable, had the second-best overall score of our top three on the WordPress Hosting Performance Benchmarks website. This is no surprise considering the performance features available through them.\n\nWhile most web hosts offer a 99.9% uptime guarantee, Pressable takes it up a notch by providing an impressive 100% uptime guarantee. It also utilizes an automatic failover process that switches to a backup server or network in case of any issues. Additionally, Pressable offers managed hosting that’s tailored specifically for WordPress. Since WordPress is built upon PHP, hosting requires a different setup than standard HTML hosting. Pressable’s cloud-based server, robust performance monitoring, and optimized WordPress hosting make it an excellent choice for hosting your WordPress site.\n\nLet’s break down the results from both of our testing platforms so you can gain insight into how fast Pressable really is.\n\nWordPress Hosting Performance Benchmark Results\n\nPressable performed exceptionally well during a LoadStorm test, which simulated uncached users hitting the website, logging in, and browsing. The test generated 425,398 requests over just over thirty minutes, with peak requests per second of nearly 360, yet there were zero HTTP failures. Pressable also achieved an impressive P95 response time of just 321ms, demonstrating its ability to handle a high volume of visitors simultaneously.\n\nPressable aced the K6 static test, which involved repeatedly requesting the website’s home page for 15 minutes. It handled 447,740 requests without any HTTP failures, with a peak RPS of 986 and an incredible response time of only 19ms. Overall, Pressable performed impressively, showcasing its robustness and ability to handle any challenge.\n\nWe conducted a performance test on Pressable to evaluate its ability to handle WordPress functions. The test included stress-testing PHP, MySQL, and WordPress databases to determine the queries per second. Pressable demonstrated an impressive PHP bench score of 10.0006 and a robust WordPress bench score of over 1349. This test showcased Pressable’s ability to handle tons of queries efficiently, making it a viable option.\n\nWe also evaluated Pressable’s uptime and conducted a web page test, which fully loads the home page and measures the loading time from different global locations. Pressable received a perfect uptime score of 100 and loaded the home page in less than a second, regardless of the location.\n\nWordPress Hosting Benchmark Plugin Results\n\nTo further examine Pressable’s performance, we conducted several tests. Firstly, we installed the benchmark plugin to assess its CPU and memory performance, filesystem response, and database. Additionally, we conducted a network download speed test.\n\nOverall, Pressable performed exceptionally well. Its network speed test showed an impressive 1.7-second response time. Simple queries on the database were speedy as well. However, importing extensive data took 4.2 seconds, which could be improved. Despite this, Pressable scored 8.2 out of 10, showcasing its strong performance.\n\nWhat We Like About Pressable\n\n100% Uptime Guarantee: Pressable is the only WordPress host on our list to guarantee your site will never go down\n\nFree Global CDN: It improves load times and reduces latency by caching and delivering content from services closest to the end user\n\nOptimized for WordPress: Pressable was created by the same people who invented WordPress, so naturally, they excel at optimizing for it\n\nCloud-Based Platform: Super fast performance based on Pressable’s collection of servers around the globe\n\nAutomatic failover: Should something happen to your site, Pressable’s servers have automatic failover protection, allowing for an instant switch to another server to prohibit downtime\n\nWhat Could Be Improved\n\nLacking Email: Pressable doesn’t offer email service, so subscribers will need to look elsewhere if they require business emails\n\nNo Domains: Pressable also doesn’t serve as a domain registrar, which can be considered negative by some\n\n🥈Why We Picked It?\n\nDespite Pressable’s omission of email and domain services, it is a fast, feature-packed host. It scored second best on our benchmark tests, and it’s no surprise why. That’s considering it was founded by the same folks as WordPress itself. So, Pressable knows WordPress. They have quality WordPress hosting, excellent security features, and an unprecedented 100% uptime guarantee. While they aren’t the cheapest entry on our list, their pricing is relatively affordable for everything that comes with it.\n\nWho is Pressable Best For?\n\nThose looking for a quality hosting provider who knows the ins and outs of WordPress will love Pressable. They offer excellent support, features for small to large businesses, and a relatively affordable price point. One downside is the lack of email addresses or domains, but there are plenty of good domain registrars where you can buy a domain for a reasonable price.\n\nCommunity Reviews and Ratings\n\nPressable’s managed WordPress hosting is praised for its affordability, resource limits, and dedicated WordPress support. However, it has limitations, such as no business email or domain purchases.\n\nPricing\n\nPressable offers several plans starting at $20.83 per month, billed annually, or $25 per month if you pay every month.\n\n➡️ Read Our Complete Pressable Hosting Review.\n\nGet Pressable\n\n3. Cloudways\n\n🥉 The Most Customizable WordPress Hosting\n\nCloudways rounds out our top three fastest hosting providers. While it scores highly in most categories, we did observe some struggles when over 300 virtual users accessed the site simultaneously. However, it’s worth noting that WPHostingBenchmarks conducted their tests on Cloudways’ lowest-tiered plan, which may explain this issue. Additionally, their test server had only 1GB of RAM, which is generally insufficient to support a WordPress website. To address this, we further tested the next highest-tiered plan to level the playing field.\n\nCloudways stands out from other hosting providers by offering customizable features you can add as needed. With options like Varnish, Redis, and Memcached, your websites can perform at lightning-fast speeds. You can choose from three cloud-based web hosts – Google, AWS, and DigitalOcean – to find the best fit for your business. And you can personalize your WordPress environment by setting the RAM, bandwidth, and storage to your unique specifications.\n\nOur tests used a Cloudways plan that included 1GB RAM, 25GB hard drive space, and 1TB bandwidth. This is equivalent to 75% of the other providers we tested. So, let’s delve into the results so you can see how Cloudways fared against other hosting providers on our list.\n\nWordPress Hosting Performance Benchmark Results\n\nAs previously mentioned, these results are skewed due to the lowest-priced plan being used. However, it’s still a good indication of what you can expect with Cloudways, especially if you choose their bargain basement setup. During the LoadStorm test, Cloudways struggled a bit. Unfortunately, it recorded 229 HTTP failures throughout the test, with failures popping up once the server gained more than 300 virtual users. With the 160,790 requests made, the average P95 response time was 21,119 ms, which could be better.\n\nHowever, Cloudways did much better on the K6 cached testing, with zero failures out of 368,873 requests and a P95 response time of 467ms, which is much better than the uncached LoadStorm test conducted. This goes to show how beneficial good caching can be. For the uptime test, Cloudways fared quite well, with an overall score of 100% through Uptime Robot and 99.8342% on Hetrix, which is pretty darned good.\n\nFinally, the PHP bench results were slightly better than Pressable and SiteGround, with a score of 7.523, good enough for the top spot on our list. However, the WordPress bench scores were the worst, reaching 1007.\n\nWordPress Hosting Benchmark Plugin Results\n\nWhen testing with the benchmarking plugin, we opted for a slightly different setup than the lowest-priced plan. For this test, we chose the next highest (recommended) minimum plan for WordPress, which consists of 2 GB RAM, 50GB hard drive storage, and 5TB of bandwidth on a DigitalOcean cloud server. With these specs, Cloudways sailed through testing with an attitude. The only score under acceptable levels was the database import metric. Still, some of our other hosts also needed help with that. Of the top three hosting providers, Cloudways scored the best on the plugin benchmarking test.\n\nWhat We Like About Cloudways\n\nCaching: Cloudways has several forms of caching, including Varnish, Regis object caching, dynamic caching through Memachached, and PHP caching with PHP-FPM\n\nMultiple Cloud Providers: As the name suggests, Cloudways is a cloud-based host that offers hosting through several providers, including DigitalOcean, AWS, and Google Cloud\n\nSimplified Pricing: Cloudways offers a modular pricing model where users can pick the amount of storage, RAM, and add-ons to suit their liking\n\nManaged Hosting: Cloudways offers managed hosting but allows the end user to determine their own settings should they prefer\n\nWhat Could Be Improved\n\nComplex Setup: Cloudways takes some getting used to when first signing up\n\nLimited Server Settings: There’s no root access, and you can’t change the server stack to suit your preferences\n\n🥉 Why We Picked It?\n\nFirst and foremost, we like Cloudways because it’s so versatile. You can leave the server as is and have a fast website without configuring a thing. On the other hand, if you like to make your own performance enhancements, Cloudways allows you to do that, too. We also like their modular pricing structure. It gives the end user the final say in what they need, allowing them to cut out what they don’t.\n\nWho is Cloudways Best For?\n\nCloudways is a great option for people looking for a reputable hosting provider that lets you build a custom setup. Their modular pricing plan is great for DIY types who want to pick and choose their own server and its specs. You also get a lot for your money with Cloudways.\n\nCommunity Reviews and Ratings\n\nPressable’s managed WordPress hosting is praised for its affordability, resource limits, and dedicated WordPress support. However, it has limitations, such as a lack of domain sales, limited support availability, and uptime transparency.\n\nPricing\n\nCloudways offers multiple plans with prices starting at $14 per month.\n\n➡️ Read Our Complete Cloudways Hosting Review.\n\nGet Cloudways\n\n4. Hostinger\n\nAnother on our list is Hostinger, a web hosting provider known for its value for money and user-friendly interface. Its managed WordPress hosting plans offer lightning-fast loading speeds and advanced caching technology to ensure your website runs smoothly.\n\nCheck the testing result below for the overall speed and performance of Hostinger’s managed WordPress hosting. Since this is the final item on our list, we’ll only project the Benchmark Plugin results.\n\nWordPress Hosting Benchmark Plugin Results\n\nBelow are the test results using the benchmark plugin, which assessed the Hostinger’s performance from CPU and memory to database.
