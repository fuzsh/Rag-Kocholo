        "text": "The gathering and sharing of information online gets messy. That’s why people use WordPress wiki: websites with special organizational tools for multiple users to file, display, and navigate content efficiently.\n\nWikis are helpful for many reasons, whether it’s for brands to maintain and share a documentation section for users or to create an area of your website detailing product information.\n\nThey’re also great for employee training resources or for building a crowdsourced knowledge base for your product (whether that’s a movie, software, or video game).\n\nLuckily, anyone can make a WordPress wiki to better organize content and offer collaboration options for users.\n\nKeep reading to learn about what makes a wiki, then dive into how to set one up.\n\nWhat Is a WordPress Wiki (or Knowledge Base)?\n\nA wiki is a collection of content (media, documents, tutorials) organized in a searchable database for easy navigation.\n\nMany wikis offer collaboration features or even community contribution options (like how Wikipedia or Fandom thrive on user submissions and editing), but you can also create a wiki that’s closed to contributions, where moderators create content and simply publish it for viewing.\n\nWhen you remove collaboration features, wikis work well for knowledge base and customer support documentation.\n\nA WordPress wiki is a bit more specific. WordPress wikis are the same as any other wiki, except they’re run on the WordPress content management system (CMS).\n\nBenefits of a WordPress Wiki\n\nIs your business or organization in need of a WordPress wiki? The question usually arises when you’re looking for a better way to organize content and present it to users or internal employees.\n\nYou may find that your blog has become so large that it’s difficult to find certain topics. Or maybe you have a series of Google Docs that needs organizing on a centralized webpage with search functionality.\n\nRegardless of the reasons, you’ll often find that a WordPress wiki is an excellent solution to disorganization online.\n\nHere are the main benefits of WordPress wikis:\n\nAll information gets stored in one place: Wikis improve upon an internal system comprised of emails, local documents, online documents, and databases. They also help consolidate fragmented content you share with users, like blog posts, webpages, or online documents stored in separate places. In short, wikis allow you to bring together every piece of content in one centralized location.\n\nUsers and stakeholders become more knowledgeable: Easily accessible knowledge makes for confident, well-informed customer support representatives who need to provide quick answers to customers. It also gives customers a more in-depth understanding of your product, prompting them to use it more, ask questions, and drive you to improve.\n\nInformation is easier to find: Both customers and employees use documentation to find solutions about a product, but databases, online storage systems, and even blogs become cluttered. Wikis let users search with keywords, use filters, and find linked content through clickable navigation.\n\nContent is easier to maintain: All someone needs in order to access a wiki is an internet connection, an internet browser, and the wiki’s URL. There’s no need for special software, passwords, or knowledge on accessing and navigating a database or software.\n\nRapid linking comes built-in: A cornerstone of any wiki is the ability to link one piece of content with another. Most wiki systems allow users to create a quick link to another existing piece of content, often using shortcuts or hotkeys.\n\nYou can crowdsource: Wikis usually have features for giving users control over content creation. It’s not required if you want a more closed system, but many wikis are built entirely on volunteer work from users (take Wikipedia or Fandom, for example).\n\nTake advantage of advanced organizational elements like categories and tagging: We already mentioned filters and search bars, but with wikis, you can also take control of your documents with tags and categories. This is particularly important when content doesn’t fit in a certain area of the wiki or if you’d like to add more subsections to use for filtering.\n\nRevision control is simple and intuitive: Most word processors have some sort of revision control, but they’re complicated, with too many crossed-out words and comments. On the other hand, Wikis tend to offer built-in revision control that logs every document version for switching back and comparing, making revisions much easier to manage than in word processors.\n\nWikis are inexpensive: Especially WordPress wikis. You just need a WordPress theme or plugin to implement a wiki on your existing website. WordPress is already free, and wiki themes/plugins cost no more than $100 (that is if you can’t find one you like for free).\n\nWhich Sites Use a WordPress Wiki?\n\nWordPress wikis power knowledge bases all over the internet. To give you an idea of their prevalence, here’s a look at some notable brands using WordPress wikis:\n\nKinsta Resource Center\n\nThe Kinsta Resource Center shows boxes for hosting customers to navigate to places like the knowledge base, help center, and Kinsta blog.\n\nThe knowledge base is the true wiki of the operation, as it features categorized columns with links to tutorials for everything from customer account questions to SSL developer documentation.\n\nIEEE 802.1 Working Group\n\nThe IEEE 802.1 Working Group website is a robust wiki filled with maintenance, security, and networking articles for 802 LAN/MAN architecture.\n\nThe wiki homepage has two sidebars for navigation, important (starter) articles for beginners, a search bar, and a wide range of other links to categories, tags, and recent posts.\n\nFandom\n\nFandom—the most popular platform for creating wikis about TV shows, games, and movies—runs much of its blog and wiki interface through WordPress. Fandom demonstrates the true power behind a WordPress wiki, considering it offers user-generated content tools and powerful content creation elements for media, text, formatting, and linking between articles.\n\nWordPress Codex\n\nIt makes sense that the WordPress Codex page utilizes WordPress for its wiki. Yet, this is still a wonderful example of how tech companies can compile all codex resources into one area online.\n\nFor instance, the WordPress Codex wiki includes links to articles about writing a plugin, working with child themes, and contributing to WordPress, all of which are available for WordPress newcomers and advanced users alike.\n\nThe Pet Wiki\n\nThe Pet Wiki functions more like a traditional wiki than a knowledge base. The website serves as a hub for pet lovers, with its navigational menu and links to articles for rodents, reptiles, dogs, exotics, birds, and cats.\n\nWith many modern wikis, the homepage appears more like a blog, but one could argue that support for images and rich designs makes blogs and wikis similar in the first place.\n\nNC State Internal Knowledge Bases\n\nMany schools and related organizations lean on the power of WordPress wiki plugins to create internal and external knowledge base pages.\n\nNC State University, for example, has built several knowledge bases for students and faculty to access important information, like the finance division wiki that links to accounts payable, contracts, and cash management topics.\n\nWP Simple Pay Documentation\n\nWP Simple Pay is a Stripe payment plugin for WordPress and, much like other software and plugin businesses, needs to inform its customers on how to use the product. So, what easier way than through a WordPress wiki?\n\nThe WP Simple Pay wiki has links to icons that lead to getting started guides, FAQs, walkthroughs, and account management tutorials.\n\nOnce you move past the homepage, categories get displayed in the sidebar for easy access, and each article offers a myriad of media elements, links, interactivity buttons, and more.\n\nThe Main Elements of a WordPress Wiki\n\nNo wiki is the same, but there are essential elements that make wikis unique from regular websites. These added features give wikis advantages (like the ones discussed earlier) over webpages, local databases, email systems, and online storage services.\n\nWhen building your WordPress wiki—whether with a theme or plugin—look for these main elements to ensure you create the best wiki possible:\n\nA robust organizational system with a clear hierarchy, menus, tags, topics, categories, and breadcrumbs.\n\nA main page (homepage) with popular or important topics highlighted before anything else, like with large buttons to beginner articles or headings for specific categories, all consolidated on the first page.\n\nA search bar for instantly typing in a keyword and finding relevant content.\n\nInternal linking that allows users to quickly jump from one piece of content to another. It’s also essential for a wiki to have rapid linking tools on the backend.\n\nStandard content creation tools on the backend (and possibly frontend), similar to blog editors, with features for adding text, images, videos, links, and headings.\n\nCollaborative editing tools for users to make corrections, edits, and additions to content. Sometimes this is closed off to a smaller group of moderators or just one admin.\n\nA login system or user authentication module, whether for adding content to a public wiki, logging into a private wiki, or gaining access to extra features on the wiki.\n\nInteractivity and communication tools for users to comment on content, make notes, and collaborate. (Optional)\n\nWhat You Need to Create a WordPress Wiki\n\nA WordPress wiki comes together with three pieces:\n\nA WordPress site: Download and install the free WordPress CMS on your host, or consider activating WordPress right from your host, like how Kinsta offers in its dashboard.\n\nWordPress hosting: Kinsta makes wiki building easy with its lightning-fast CDN, managed WordPress hosting, and affordable plans for small and high-traffic wikis.\n\nA theme or plugin for wikis: View your options below.\n\nHow To Create a Wiki on WordPress\n\nIt’s possible to launch a wiki or knowledge base using one of the following options:\n\nA WordPress wiki theme: If you have no problem replacing a current theme or starting a new site.\n\nA WordPress wiki plugin: For adding wiki functionality without altering your current site design.\n\nFor this tutorial, we’ll stick to showing you how to create a WordPress wiki with one particular plugin. However, further down in the article, we list 10 WordPress wiki themes, 10 WordPress wiki plugins, and custom code to launch a wiki; so you can choose which one is best for you.\n\nStep 1: Install the BetterDocs Plugin\n\nBetterDocs is our top choice for building a WordPress wiki or knowledge base since its designs are modern, features powerful, and it’s a plugin, meaning you don’t have to replace your current theme. Not to mention, BetterDocs has a free version and premium features if you’d like to upgrade.\n\nWith that, install and activate the BetterDocs plugin to begin.\n\nStep 2: Enable a Built-in Documentation Page\n\nBetterDocs provides a wonderful launch guide to get your wiki set up in a few minutes. Walk through those steps, but make sure to stop at the Setup Pages tab.\n\nHere, you’ll check the box to Enable Built-in Documentation Page.\n\nThis adds a main page for your wiki, separate from the homepage on your website.\n\nContinue with the recommended Page Slug, or create your own.\n\nClick Next.\n\nStep 3: Create Documents and Categories\n\nWordPress wikis and knowledge bases thrive on their organization of documents into categories. So, BetterDocs recommends creating a few categories and docs to get the process started.\n\nClick on Create Categories first.\n\nMake however many categories you need. For each doc category, fill in:\n\nName\n\nSlug (or let the slug automatically from the name)\n\nCategory Icon (optional)\n\nClick the Add New Docs Category button.\n\nAs you add new doc categories, you’ll see them listed to the right.\n\nMoving on, jump back to the Getting Started page to click on the Create Docs button.\n\nAgain, you can create as many docs as you want. It’s a good idea to at least get some filler content in there to design the wiki.\n\nWith each document, be sure to add it to the appropriate category. Publish the document when you’re done.\n\nStep 4: Customize the WordPress Wiki Design\n\nNavigate back to the Getting Started guide. Click on Next to find the Customize section. This is where you add a pre-made design, customize colors, and manage settings.\n\nClick the Go To Customizer button.\n\nThis sends you to the WordPress Customizer under a new BetterDocs panel. Here, you can select a pre-made template, change all design elements, and configure styles for single docs, sidebars, archive pages, and live search.\n\nStep 5: Finalize the Wiki and Visit Your Documentation Page\n\nBack in the Getting Started guide, skip to the Finalize section.\n\nClick on the Visit Your Documentation Page button to reveal the URL and frontend of your wiki.\n\nYou are welcome to click around and view what it all looks like. Remember, the documentation page isn’t stored on the Pages list on WordPress, so you should save the URL.\n\nStep 6: Add the Wiki Page to Your Menu\n\nIt’s wise to grab the document page URL and add it to your main menu, as WordPress may not have it listed in the Pages section. This way, you can access it at all times.\n\nSo, copy the URL of your documentation page.\n\nAdd it to your menu using the classic Appearance > Customize > Menu method or with the new visual WordPress editor (Appearance > Editor).\n\nStep 7: Adjust Your Settings\n\nYour wiki/documentation page is now active. All that’s left is to edit any settings you want to make it more customized.\n\nFor that, go to BetterDocs > Settings.\n\nThis page offers options to:\n\nCustomize the live search\n\nModify your design\n\nChange the look of single documents\n\nSet the order of documents and categories\n\nAdd columns\n\nUse shortcodes\n\nEnable instant answers\n\nMuch more\n\nThat’s it! We encourage you to view all parts of the WordPress wiki/knowledge base to ensure it all looks correct, including the individual document pages and search bar.\n\n10 Best WordPress Wiki and Knowledge Base Themes\n\nOne way to establish a WordPress wiki is by installing a wiki WordPress theme to your WordPress site.
