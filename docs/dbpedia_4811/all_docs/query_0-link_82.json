It needs 25 more topics before creating another archive.\n\nDoes simply adding a group in LocalSettings.php cause MediaWiki to allow users to be added?\n\nYes. 86.138.46.182\n\nAnd how to add a group? I can't find anything about adding groups to mediawiki.\n\nI found that you can add groups simply by creating permissions for them in localsettings.php. For example entering:\n\n\"$wgGroupPermissions['internaluser']['read'] = true;\"\n\nWill create the group \"internaluser\", and also provide them with read access.\n\nThis is not very correct. It's correct that this way a user group \"internaluser\" is created. But this group has the user rights of the standard group \"user\" as well, so you don't need to give them read access additionally – except when you denied read access to the standard \"user\" group (which is not very senseful :-) ). If you want to give standard users less rights than they have in a standard installation, but to have special users who have these rights again, first deny the right to the \"user\" group, then give the right back to the special group, e. g.:\n\n$wgGroupPermissions['user']['createpage'] = false; $wgGroupPermissions['internaluser']['createpage'] = true;\n\nAt least this is the way how it works in my 1.9.x installations. Regards -- 89.55.176.121\n\nJust set up a new Wiki last week, and during initial customization I found instructions on how to configure it to automatically bring up an edit page with text editor whenever a page is not found. Sounded efficient, so I did it. Since our users are all Wiki Newbies, it turned out not to be so good an idea, after all, but now I can't find the instructions in order to set it back! I would have sworn this info was in the FAQ, but during install and setup I was bouncing back and forth between meta, here, and some third-party sites trying to figure out what to do next, so I could very well be wrong. Can someone please tell me how to set this feature back to the default, and perhaps it should be included in the faq. Thanks.\n\nIt's $wgGoToEdit; remove the override line from LocalSettings.php or set it to false. robchurch | talk\n\nOnly sysops can add pages to Mediawiki namespace.

I would like to ask you - is it good and safe solution? 21:35, 28 June 2006 (UTC)\n\nYes, but you will lose the change when you next upgrade your copy of MediaWiki, unless you take care. Make sure you note the changes you have made to a separate (new) file so that you can re-apply them after an upgrade. Also be sure to lock your wiki when you perform an upgrade, otherwise there will be a period of time between upgrading to the new version and re-applying your fix when these pages will be editable by everyone! Note that subsequent versions of MediaWiki may not work in the same way, so your fix is not guaranteed to work in the future, however I don't know of any method of achieving the above using the existing settings so unless I am mistaken then hacking the code is the best way, for now. --HappyDog\n\nI changed the URL to point my Logo.jpg but it only shows on random pages.\n\n88.115.194.214\n\nReconfigure your localsettings file. --Truetech (Talk) MediaWiki Support Team\n\nMediaWiki: ?\n\nPHP: 5.2.1\n\nMySQL: 5.0.27\n\nURL: http://cstx.gov/intranet\n\nPHP has encrusted an Access violation at 01EDAE66\n\nweb sever: Microsoft-IIS/5.0\n\nDear friends,\n\nI am a new mediawiki administrator, the previous one installed it and left. the wiki is set as a intranet site. recently, our wiki is down so often with error message \"PHP has encrusted an Access violation at 01EDAE66\", I searched google, mediawiki sites for several days, but did not have any clue. any body has the same experience? any suggestion is appreciated!\n\nThanks.\n\nSusan —The preceding unsigned comment was added by Susan9508 (talk • contribs) 08:11, 8 February 2008.

It should be no problem moving the site elsewhere, just take a complete copy of your wiki directory structure so you get your localsettings and uploaded files, and export your database as SQL (not XML or other custom format or you may not have the same tools on your target server).

After a considerable amount of confusion about LocalSettings.php, I decided to just try it, and revert the changes if it failed. What ended up happening was the group was successfully created, but it added repeated lines of \"Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /home/content/g/a/e/gaeamil/html/wikiverse/LocalSettings.php:2) in /home/content/g/a/e/gaeamil/html/wikiverse/includes/WebResponse.php on line 10\". Also, no redirects work. I don't know about page redirects, but neither an edit nor typing in the URL without the whole ?title= bit allows you to reach a page. The second link above can send you right to the main page. I reverted every edit, and tried replacing WebResponse.php with a fresh version just downloaded from here, even though I never edited it. It may be caused by the fact that I have not found a way to replace files on my server without first deleting the old copy, thus making a gap which could have messed up the Wiki. I really wish I had editing capabilities, but I do not. Can someone help me get my wiki back to the way it was? Thank you.\n\n—204.132.36.104 —(Gaeamil, not logged in.)\n\nThis can be due to a space or a line break at the start of your LocalSettings.php, that will start the output and disallow any newer header to be send, be sure that there is no space nor line break (and maybe no BOM caracter). iAlex\n\nAlso spaces at the end after the ?> will cause that problem, it's best to simply remove the ?> completely. --Nad\n\nI'll try these. When I downloaded the file, however, the line break was already there. Maybe it's my download algorithm or something stupid like that. Or perhaps I hit enter and never realized.\n\nOK, now it says \"Parse error: syntax error, unexpected $end in /home/content/g/a/e/gaeamil/html/wikiverse/LocalSettings.php on line 126\", but when I look at the file, there is no \"$end\". -- Gaeamil --204.132.36.53\n\nCould you please paste lines 124-126 of your LocalSettings.php file here?

I'll just re-upload the LocalSettings file and link it, OK? LocalSettings, directly copied from the wiki--204.132.36.53\n\nWait, you use Notepad to edit the file? That may explain your issues then. Notepad usually adds a BOM character, which messes up the PHP file. Try using a different text editing program (I use Notepad++, but it's up to you really) and see if that helps. --Skizzerz talk - contribs MediaWiki Support Team\n\nEr, I don't have another.

I just need to know what needs to be done to get this back to how it was before.--Gaeamil --204.132.36.53\n\nNotepad++ is downloadable here, or if you can't/don't want to download and install a new program, Windows WordPad does not attach BOMs to files. Also, you will need to use a hex editor to remove the BOM from the file. --Skizzerz talk - contribs MediaWiki Support Team\n\nOK, so you know, I truly have no clue what I'm doing here.

Within that folder, MediaWiki is organised into a number of folders, like /includes, /api, etc. One of these folders is called /config, and contains your newly-created LocalSettings.php. You need to move this file from path/to/mw/config/LocalSettings.php to path/to/mw/LocalSettings.php to complete the installation.
