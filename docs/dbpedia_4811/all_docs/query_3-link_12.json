        "text": "Are you looking to create a Wiki knowledge base using WordPress?\n\nA WordPress Wiki is a website where you can display product documentation or user guides for your customers in an easy-to-follow format.\n\nIn this article, we’ll show you how to easily create a wiki knowledge base in WordPress.\n\nWhy Should You Create a Wiki Knowledge Base?\n\nA WordPress wiki is a collection of articles and guides that provide information to the users regarding your product or website.\n\nBy adding a WordPress knowledge base to your site, you’re creating a virtual library that your customers, subscribers, or users can access at will to find the information they need.\n\nCreating a WordPress wiki helps improve customer support as customers can easily look for answers on your detailed guides instead of calling customer service or opening a support ticket.\n\nAnother benefit of creating a knowledge base is that it helps improve SEO by providing numerous opportunities for internal linking to different sections of your site.\n\nThat being said, you can build a wiki site within WordPress using a plugin. We’ll show you three different methods and you can choose one that works best for you.\n\nMethod 1. Creating a WordPress Wiki Using The Heroic Knowledge Base Plugin (Recommended)\n\nThe best way to create a wiki knowledge base in WordPress is by using the Heroic Knowledge Base plugin.\n\nHeroic KB is one of the best knowledge base plugins on the market. It allows you to easily add a searchable knowledge base to your existing WordPress site.\n\nFirst, you need to install and activate the Heroic KB plugin. If you need help, see our tutorial on how to install a WordPress plugin.\n\nUpon activation, go to Heroic KB » Add New Article from the WordPress dashboard to create your first knowledge base article.\n\nFrom here, you can write your knowledge base guide using the familiar WordPress interface.\n\nIn the panel on the right, you can add categories and tags for your knowledge base guide.\n\nBelow the text editor, you can also add attachments to your article and configure user feedback and voting options.\n\nWhen you’re finished writing your article, simply click the ‘Publish’ button to make it live on your WordPress website.\n\nHeroic KB will automatically create a homepage for your knowledge base at yourdomain.com/knowledge-base.\n\nHere’s an example of what it looks like when used with the Astra theme:\n\nIf you want to rearrange your categories or articles, simply head to Heroic KB » Article Ordering / Category Ordering from the WordPress dashboard.\n\nFrom here, you can reorder your categories or articles simply by dragging and dropping them into place. Don’t forget to hit the ‘Save Order’ button to store your changes.\n\nThe Heroic KB plugin offers multiple widgets that you can use to display important information in the sidebar or other widget-ready areas of your knowledge base.\n\nGo to Appearance » Widgets from the WordPress dashboard and click the ‘+’ icon to bring up the widget block menu.\n\nIn the search bar, you can type ‘knowledge base’ to quickly find widgets like Knowledge Base Authors, Knowledge Base Articles, Knowledge Base Search, and more. Simply click on any widget to add it to your sidebar.\n\nYou can also configure other settings for your wiki knowledge base by heading to Heroic KB » Settings from the WordPress dashboard.\n\nYou can edit the header text, display breadcrumbs, set the number of columns, show article excerpts, restrict knowledge base articles to logged in users only, change the knowledge base colors, and much more.\n\nWith Heroic KB, you can easily create a custom knowledge base that fits your site’s exact needs.\n\nBonus Tip: Heroic KB also comes with an AI Help Assistant that allows you to easily add a custom chatbot to your knowledge base. The chatbot is trained on your own knowledge base articles in order to provide accurate answers to users. For more details, see our guide on how to add a chatbot in WordPress.\n\nMethod 2. Creating a WordPress Wiki Using The Knowledge Base Plugin\n\nFirst, you need to install and activate the Echo Knowledge Base plugin. For more details, see our guide on how to install a WordPress plugin.\n\nUpon activation, a Knowledge Base tab will be added to your WordPress admin dashboard. Simply click on the tab to launch the Setup Wizard.\n\nThe setup wizard will ask you to choose a nickname for your knowledge base. Simply type any name you want in the ‘Knowledge Base Nickname’ field.\n\nNext, type any slug you prefer in the ‘Knowledge Base Slug field. Then, click the ‘Next Step’ button at the bottom.\n\nIn the next step, you’ll be asked to choose a layout for your knowledge base.\n\nSimply choose one that looks good to you and then click on the ‘Next Step’ button.\n\nNext, you’ll be asked to choose a layout for your articles and categories navigation.\n\nChoose your preferred layout and click the ‘Finish Set Up’ button.\n\nOnce you’ve set up your plugin, you can start by adding categories to your knowledge base.\n\nTo add categories, go to the Knowledge Base » Categories page and type a name and a slug for your new category in the ‘Add New Category’ section.\n\nAfter that, don’t forget to click the ‘Add New Category’ button at the bottom to save your changes.\n\nSimilarly, you can also easily add a knowledge base article by going to Knowledge Base » Add New Article from the WordPress dashboard.\n\nThis will take you to the post editor where you can write your knowledge base guide and publish it by simply clicking the ‘Publish’ button at the top.\n\nThis way you can easily create a knowledge base wiki using the Echo Knowledge Base plugin.\n\nMethod 3. Creating a WordPress Wiki Using The Encyclopedia/Glossary/Wiki Plugin\n\nFirst, you need to install and activate the Encyclopedia/Glossary/Wiki plugin.
