        "text": "The simple answer is â€“ It Depends! If your website has been on the internet for a few years and has been crawlable, then to see improvement in rankings can be seen within 3-6 months. But if your website has not been updated for some time and hasnâ€™t been well indexed by Google or you have a very new website, then it could take up to 1 year. In addition, it also depends on your industry niche, whether it is highly competitive or not. All said and done, we suggest focusing on getting leads through SEO and not just focus on rankings.\n\nIf it is anything related to a website, we can do it. Irrespective of the technology that was used to develop the website, we can take care of it, so that you can focus on your business.\n\nLEADS!! At the end of the day, no business has grown by just ranking #1 on Google. The idea of doing SEO is to get you more leads so that you can convert them into paying clients and eventually help your business grow. There are some other factors as well that we use to measure success like an increase in traffic to the website, no. of impressions of the website on Google Search and so on. But all said and done, if there are no new leads generated, nothing else matters.\n\nSEO is not Rocket Science. You can learn the steps involved in doing SEO for your own website and you can do it for free from Youtube. The key to great SEO is Expertise, Consistency & Patience. An SEO Agency like us has spent years learning SEO and is doing so to date as Google constantly keeps changing & evolving. Plus, this is all we do. So we spend all the time working on SEO as our core competency. If you have time outside your core competency to learn SEO, stay updated & be consistent, you can easily do the SEO for your website. But if you do not have that time to put in, we could be a good alternative ðŸ™‚"
