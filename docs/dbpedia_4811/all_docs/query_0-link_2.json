        "text": "Company Background\n\nBusiness Name: SG Hosting Inc.\n\nYear of foundation: 2004\n\nLocation: Sofia, Bulgaria\n\nBBB Accreditation: No\n\nMarket Size: > 300K websites (#8 HRank list)\n\nGrowth Status: (by websites quantity): Increasing\n\nOne of the best jewels in the hosting crown, SiteGround.com is a company that can boast amazing ranks and excellent performance. If there is something worth recommending in the industry, as of this moment, SiteGround definitely falls into this category.\n\nIt is an American hosting company with headquarters in Bulgaria, Sofia. According to Wikipedia, SiteGround was founded in “2004 by a few university friends”. At the moment it is one of the largest web hosting providers out there.\n\nHigh satisfaction rate, affordable pricing, great features, and amazing customer support make it one of the few companies that can be called nearly perfect.\n\nRanking websites place SiteGround.com high, and positive reviews flood their pages. And to this, we have little to add but to agree.\n\nHow much does SiteGround Shared Hosting Cost?\n\nShared Hosting Plans\n\nThey currently offer 3 shared hosting plans and monthly, annual, biannual and triennial subscriptions. Prices per month are the same for any period.\n\nThere are promo prices for new customers.\n\nSet up is paid at Siteground: $14.95, $24.95 and $24.95 for each plan respectively.\n\nSiteground.com also offers a variation of hosting and hosting-related services, among which are\n\nDedicated / Cloud / Reseller / Enterprise hosting,\n\nWordPress, WooCommerce,\n\nWebsite builder,\n\nWebsite transfer services and more.\n\nPerhaps, it is not the cheapest offer on the Internet in terms of prices (though, quite affordable), yet, SiteGround is one of the best picks available in this day and age. Specializing in hosting services, they aim to make every aspect of their business activity flawless, and reportedly really do so.\n\nDoes SiteGround Offer 24/7 Instant Tech Support?\n\nChecked: Yes\n\nSiteGround Summary Review by HRank\n\nSiteGround is mostly stable and never got lower than 99.0% uptime.\n\nIt also had a very stable response time (mostly 600ms – 800ms).\n\nThe company was continuously growing the number of domains and Shared IPs that host them. By its growth rate, it can be concluded that all the company’s promotional campaigns have so far been fruitful. However, if you come to think about it, their performance quite justified their advertising."
