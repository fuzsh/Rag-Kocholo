PDH Course Description: To safeguard propane installations, the NFPA and the US EPA have developed the FSA and O&M instructions that all-applicable propane facilities must comply within a certain time frame. In some states a licensed professional engineer must fully understand and prepare the FSA plan. The 2001 edition of the National Fire Protection Associations (NFPA) Pamphlet 58, Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code requires a written Fire Safety Analysis (FSA) and written Operations & Maintenance Instructions. These requirements originated at the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Risk Management Program (RMP). The NFPA 58 requirements are much less restrictive than what the EPA originally proposed. The requirement for a written (FSA) for all tank installations over 4,000 gallons aggregate capacity becomes effective when your State adopts the 2001 edition NFPA 58, section 3.10, Fire Protection. New propane bulk plants and tank installations and for ASME tank installations on roofs, must complete an FSA before completion of the new facility. Also, a written FSA is required for all-existing bulk plants, tanks and roof installations by three years after the effective date of the code. In North Carolina, a professional engineer registered in North Carolina must prepare the FSA. Other guidelines for an alternative FSA come under the NC Department of Agriculture. The other RMP-like requirements are found in the new Chapter 11 of NFPA 58, Operations and Maintenance. This requires written procedures for safely conducting LP-Gas activities at bulk and industrial plants. Also, these procedures must be kept up to date. Similarly, maintenance procedures must be prepared and implemented. These must be made available to contractors coming on site to do maintenance. Be sure to look at NFPA 58, Appendix A, sections A.11.2.1 and A.11.2.2 for some guidance for what is expected in these procedures and what you may use to help you prepare them. This course includes a multiple choice quiz at the end. PDH Course Description: This course provides the user with an overview of incident investigation. The motivation for this course is to outline a procedure of incident investigation that is objective and satisfies most regulatory requirements. Many incident investigations and reports are done with prejudice. Conclusions and recommendations are often predetermined to suit the goals of the investigators. This could occur intentionally or unintentionally. In this course an effort is made to present a means to minimize the bias that can enter an investigation. Also, an incident investigation procedure/format that is in general compliance with OSHA/EPA regulations is difficult to find. One can usually obtain from OSHA or EPA an outline for an investigation procedure. These usually do not have much practical value in that they are usually for a specific regulation or simply outline the procedure that OSHA or EPA agents should use for their own investigations. Most facilities must comply with multiple investigation/reporting requirements as listed in various OSHA and EPA regulations. This course outlines a general procedure designed to comply with most OSHA and EPA regulations. It is not possible to ensure compliance with ALL regulations; however, by following the guidelines in this course one should be able to minimize repeat investigations and reports. This course includes a multiple choice quiz at the end. PDH Course Description: The value of electronic mail in the technical and engineering fields is without question. Email is cheaper and faster than a letter, less intrusive than a phone call, and less hassle than a facsimile (FAX). When using email, differences in location and time zone are less of an obstacle to communication. The internet can be used to instantly transmit drawing revisions to project team members located anywhere on the planet. Almost all drawing files and project documents are now sent via email attachments. Coupled with digital photography, email allows real-time project field conditions to be easily visually, as well as descriptively, conveyed over vast distances.\n\nBefore the advent of electronic technology, people who were not very skilled at writing could do most of their communication verbally. This coping strategy is less possible now. A large number of technical professionals do not understand how to adjust their communication styles from the conventional to this new medium. This course will help those individuals to avoid this problem. This course will be useful not only to technical professionals who are just beginning, but also to those who are already using email as a mode of communication. The material covered will be useful to you as you continue your emailing experience.\n\nThis course includes a multiple-choice quiz at the end, which is designed to enhance the understanding of course materials. PDH Course Description: This course introduces you to the basic concepts about earthquakes. Following a brief narrative of the myths and mystery that surrounded the occurrence of earthquakes through history, the course describes the precise effects of the first major earthquake recorded in the mid-eighteenth century. This initial advance led to the development of the new discipline of seismology in the nineteenth century, and by the late nineteenth century sufficient progress had been made to develop standardized scales to characterize the shaking severity of earthquakes. With the advent of the twentieth century and the development of instruments that capture and record the ground motion generated by earthquakes, it became possible to eventually develop the Richter magnitude scale.\n\nThe intensity of shaking as a measurement scale is presented: the Rossi-Forel and the Modified Mercalli scales. An explanation is given as to why these scales are not entirely satisfactory for measuring the absolute size of earthquakes. The discussion about the modern magnitude scale covers its use as a measurement of earthquake size and as an index of the energy released at the source of an earthquake. The association between faults and earthquakes is explained and the geometrical relationship between the fault plane, the hypocenter (or focus) and the epicenter of an earthquake is illustrated.\n\nThe major earthquakes that have affected North America, namely the 1811-1812 New Madrid, Missouri, the 1886 Charleston, South Carolina, and the 1906 San Francisco, California, earthquakes are described. The intensity of the ground shaking associated with these three earthquakes is presented in a figure that clearly shows that at the same intensity level, the shaking effects extend over a much larger area in the Eastern United States than in the Western United States. You will also learn that the 1906 San Francisco earthquake produced a wealth of recorded observations that allowed H. F. Reid to formulate the elastic rebound theory to explain the mechanism of earthquake generation.\n\nSome of the largest magnitude earthquakes in the World since 1900 are the 1960 Chile earthquake, the 1964 Alaska earthquake and the 2004 South East Asia earthquake. These earthquakes are described because of their very large magnitude and because they disturbed the ocean floor generating immense sea waves called âtsunamisâ, a Japanese word for âport waveâ. These waves devastated the coastal towns they hit. Information about the Great Southeast Asia Earthquake and Tsunami of 2004 is presented and discussed. This 2004 tsunami was one of the largest ever in terms of casualties because it hit heavily populated low-lying coastal areas in many countries that were caught completely unprepared.\n\nFinally, the equations used to derive the Richter magnitude of an earthquake and compute the energy released during that earthquake are presented in an Appendix. Also, a glossary of terms and acronyms used is provided as a reference to assist the student in following the concepts that are discussed throughout.\n\nThe information presented in this course is based on the long and varied experience of the author gained while dealing with the diverse seismic issues he encountered on the major engineering projects he managed in the United States and around the world.\n\nThis course includes a multiple choice quiz at the end, which is designed to enhance the understanding of the course materials. PDH Course Description: In recent years, energy prices have risen significantly as a result of worldwide increasing demand and shrinking resources. For industrialized countries, it is now more important than ever to conserve energy. For an average American home, heating and cooling expenses could account for more than 50% of the utility bill. Proper insulation for buildings is a key to conserve energy and can save homeowners a significant amount of money. This course provides tips and ideas on how to reduce your utility bill while maintaining a desired comfort level in your home. In this course, you will learn which parts of the house are taking a major toll on your utility bill and how to fix those problems using various types of insulations or sealants. Although the course materials are tailored for residential homes, many of the energy-saving tips and ideas discussed in this course are applicable to office and commercial environments. At the end of this course is a multiple choice quiz which is designed to reinforce what your learned from the course material.

PDH Course Description: Workers who use chemicals and those who work nearby must be made aware of the hazards associated with those chemicals, how to reduce the risk of being exposed to them, and what to do in the case of an incident associated with those chemicals. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires that all employers with hazardous chemicals in their workplaces have a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) available to workers for each hazardous chemical to which they could get exposed. MSDSs contain a wealth of information about the chemicals, their hazards, and how to reduce the risk of exposure. However, they are long documents, filled with technical information, making it difficult to understand and/or find the bits of information that you need. Plus it can sometimes be a challenge to simply get a copy of an MSDS for a product.\n\nThis course will show you various ways to acquire MSDSs, help you to understand the information on MSDSs, and share a few examples of how you might be able to use MSDS information to reduce risks.\n\nThis course focuses on MSDSs as required by OSHA for U.S. workers. Many other countries also have standards.\n\nThis course includes a multiple-choice quiz at the end, which is designed to enhance the understanding of the course materials. PDH Course Description: This two hour course specifically reviews the preparation of a Statement of Energy Performance, which is a stand-alone document designed to communicate not only a building's energy performance, but also its physical characteristics, operating characteristics, and conformance to current indoor environmental standards. Once validated by a professional engineer (PE), the Statement of Energy Performance becomes an official document that can be used to apply for the ENERGY STAR label. The role of the PE is essential to the credibility of the outcome. Professional Engineers provide unbiased engineering services and are legally bound to uphold standards of ethics. Because of this high level of professionalism, experience, and expertise, a PE is required to validate each Statement of Energy Performance for it to be considered \"official\" whether it is used to apply for the ENERGY STAR label or for any other purpose. Services performed by Professional Engineers in connection with the ENERGY STAR or Portfolio Manager shall in no way be construed to diminish or otherwise modify the responsibilities or liability of the original designer or operator of the building.\n\nSince January 1999, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has provided the public the means to quickly and easily assess â or benchmark â the energy performance of commercial buildings relative to similar buildings in the United States. Accounting for the most significant drivers of energy intensity such as weather and building characteristics, buildings whose performance is among the nation's top 25 as an ENERGY STAR building.\n\nThis course is based entirely on the Publication EPA 430- F â01-XX, June 2003 Professional Engineer's Guide to the ENERGY STAR Â® Label for Buildings prior to taking a quiz for credit. You will be quizzed on the attached document on its entirety.\n\nPDH Course Description: This course on âTsunamisâ is presented as a complement to course G175 on âEarthquakes: Basic Principlesâ for the benefit of those students who want to learn more about this particularly devastating natural phenomenon. Course G175, however, is not a pre-requisite for taking this course. This course is a stand-alone presentation that can be taken independently of course G175.\n\nIn this course you will learn that any number of large-scale, short duration disturbances of the ocean floor can generate tsunamis. Most frequently, however, it is the strong, shallow submarine earthquakes that are the most likely triggering mechanism of these monstrous sea waves.\n\nFollowing a brief explanation of the origin of the word, you will learn how to describe the geometry and general behavior of water waves and what distinguishes wind-generated waves from tsunamis. The geologic concept of plate tectonics is then presented, which explains that the earthâs crust is divided into a number of rigid plates that interact with one another causing seismic activity along their boundaries. In fact, it is the interaction between the oceanic and continental plates that most frequently trigger the large seismic events that deform the ocean floor and spawn the most devastating tsunamis. A step by step illustration of this process is presented along with an explanation of how the initial tsunami wave splits into two waves that start traveling in opposite directions. The wave that travels out to the deep ocean is known as the distant tsunami, while the other wave that travels towards the nearby coast is referred to as the local tsunami. The wave transformations that occur at shallow oceanic depths are explained as they control the ensuing wave run-up that occurs all along the coastline. The equations used to compute the velocity of tsunamis are presented in an appendix at the end of the course.\n\nThe characteristics of the most notable tsunamis that occurred since 1900 are presented and discussed. Experiences gained from the study of these events led the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to develop and deploy several tsunami-warning stations in the Pacific Ocean in the mid-1990s. When data collected from these stations confirm the detection of a tsunami, scientists begin immediately to predict the propagation course and velocity of the waves. Warnings are then issued to the most susceptible areas likely to be affected. Following the devastating tsunami of December 26, 2004, several additional tsunami detection stations have been added to the existing network.\n\nFinally, other mechanisms that could also trigger tsunamis are presented and explained. Examples from the historical and geological records are presented as evidence that tsunamis have occurred in the past and are therefore one of the recurring and potent geologic hazards of our planet.\n\nA glossary of terms and acronyms used is provided at the end of this course as a reference to assist the student in following the concepts that are discussed throughout the text.\n\nThe information presented in this course is based on the professional experience gained by the author in dealing with various aspects of seismic issues he dealt with in association with the major engineering projects he managed around the world.\n\nThis course includes a multiple choice quiz at the end, which is designed to enhance the understanding of the course materials. PDH Course Description: This course provides an overview of technologies that are currently used or have potential for use in hybrid vehicles. In many ways the current interest in alternatives to the dominant single energy source gasoline engine is dÃ©jÃ vu. A sketch of the early history of automotive power trains is outlined with reasons why the gasoline internal combustion engine (ICE) won this early race for dominance. Because of the enormous challenge of changing the supporting infrastructure for a completely different technology, the race this time is beginning with many transition forms consisting of the ICE in combination with non-polluting power generating systems. The wide varieties of hybrid system storage, power and fuel systems for power trains that are emerging are reviewed. The remarkable prospect of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology that would provide vehicle owner income in return for quick service high value electric services is discussed. Software simulation packages that can be used for design support and performance analysis as well as government initiatives are also discussed. References are given for those who wish to carry out more in-depth study.\n\nThis course includes a multiple-choice quiz at the end, which is designed to enhance the understanding of the course materials. PDH Course Description: This course narrowly focuses on completion of the Statement of Compliance required by the April, 2007, version 3.1 of the US National CAD Standard (NCS 3.1-07). Details and discussion are restricted to electrical design, though the majority of the standard is directed toward Architectural content. The full standard is copyrighted and can be purchased from National Institute of Building Sciences, 1090 Vermont Ave, NW, #700, Washington, DC 20005-4905.\n\nThe CAD standard provides a means to encourage uniform, quality presentation of facility construction drawings. It has been adopted by the federal and state governments for some projects of some agencies. The author is presently preparing engineering standards for a large municipal government and using NCS 3.1-07 as the basis. The âuniform, quality presentationâ simplifies revisions and follow-up projects without a learning-curve of becoming familiar with the original design conventions followed. Backgrounds can be reused without extensive fix-up. Pen assignments are explicit so that new line weights are consistent with the original. The second designer knows where to look in the set for information left by the first designer.\n\nThe course is made up of two major parts - the Worksheet for the Statement of Compliance and the Course Content, including introduction and references.\n\nThe course includes a multiple-choice quiz at the end, which is designed to enhance the understanding of the course materials.

PDH Course Description: This course takes you step by step through the process of preparing and delivering a clear and lucid technical presentation at scientific and professional meetings. The guidance provided is also applicable to the preparation and delivery of less formal presentations, such as those given in the form of internal company reports to corporate executives or as lectures prepared and delivered by professors or graduate students at colleges and universities.\n\nThe course starts by suggesting that you write answers to ten fundamental questions. Your answers to these questions will guide you through the preparation of the first draft of your presentation. The course then progresses by providing you with specific suggestions that will assist you through the preparation of the introductory section, the body and the conclusion section of your presentation.\n\nThe preparation phase of your talk will take you step by step through the recommended rehearsal sessions that will help you practice your delivery skills. In that section of the course you will also learn that speakers have limited time to communicate their message in a clear and concise fashion. Indeed, your job during the delivery of your presentation is to scan and pay attention to your audience in order to adjust your talk and be able to transfer your knowledge effectively. In preparing for the event, you are also prompted to anticipate and prepare for unforeseen circumstances that may arise so you can handle them with ease when they occur. By familiarizing yourself with the content of your presentation and rehearsing repeatedly ahead of time you will most definitely improve your performance when you finally deliver your talk.\n\nAn appendix, at the end of the course, provides you with suggestions on how to prepare clear and concise visual aids. Your illustrations should be simple and clear, colorful and easy to read. Each illustration you prepare should be checked against these simple guidelines to ensure that it will capture and hold the attention of your audience.\n\nThis course includes a multiple choice quiz at the end, which is designed to enhance the understanding of the course materials. PDH Course Description: Homes can now be qualified as an ENERGY STARÂ® Qualified Home using the National Builder Option Package BOP, which includes strict requirements for analysis of Thermal Bypass.\n\nThe Thermal Bypass Checklist is a comprehensive list of building details where thermal bypass, or the movement of heat around or through insulation, frequently occurs due to missing air barriers or gaps between the air barrier and insulation. The Thermal Bypass Checklist must be completed by a certified home energy rater in order for a home to be qualified as ENERGY STAR.\n\nThis (Six-hour) course will review the details of ENERGY STARÂ® Qualified Homes covering both the Builder Option Package BOP, and the Thermal Bypass Checklist in detail.\n\nThe Engineer or Architect of record in many localities is now being asked to certify that the proposed construction plans meet the latest guidelines for ENERGY STARÂ® Qualified Homes, therefore a good working knowledge of this criteria is essential for any professionals who are involved with residential construction.\n\nThis course is based entirely on both the Thermal Bypass Checklist Guide- Version 2.0, updated June 2007; published by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the ENERGY STARÂ® Qualified Homes - Builder Option Package BOP-dated June 2007.\n\nThis course includes a multiple-choice quiz at the end, which is designed to enhance the understanding of course materials. PDH Course Description: The purpose of this course is to provide an introductory body of information that will allow the engineer, engineering manager or corporate manager the resources to start the process of organizing a reliability department within the company he or she works for. We wish to illustrate those key design practices that ensure high levels of reliability. This course will also provide references for further study so that the concepts of reliability and reliability engineering, as applied to commercial and consumer products, are not overlooked or taken for granted. Successfully completing this course will not make you an expert or a specialist but certainly will provide you with an understanding of the basics so further study will be less confusing. There is no doubt about the fact that the design process is one involving many disciplines and even though we explore only one; i.e. reliability, we touch on several others. The last portion of this course will address reliability methodology as applied to computer programming. The study of how to improve the reliability of computer codes is a huge industry and one that garners significant awareness. The interaction of various program packages remains critical to many systems and subsystems.

The challenges presented by population growth, an aging population, migration patterns, and urban and coastal development will be affected by changes in temperature, precipitation, and extreme climate-related events. In the future, with continued global warming, heat waves and heavy downpours are very likely to further increase in frequency and intensity. Cold days and cold nights are very likely to become much less frequent over North America. Substantial areas of North America are likely to have more frequent droughts of greater severity. Hurricane wind speeds, rainfall intensity, and storm surge levels are likely to increase. Other changes include measurable sea-level rise and increases in the occurrence of coastal and riverine flooding. The United States is certainly capable of adapting to the collective impacts of climate change. However, there will still be certain individuals and locations where the adaptive capacity is less and these individuals and their communities will be disproportionally impacted by climate change.\n\nThis course focuses on impacts of global climate change, especially impacts on three broad dimensions of the human condition: human health, human settlements, and human welfare. The course examines potential impacts of climate change on human society, opportunities for adaptation, and associated recommendations for addressing data gaps and near- and long-term research goals.\n\nThe text for this course was authored by the US EPA and a number of national and international experts and is titled, âAnalyses of the Effects of Global Change on Human Health and Welfare and Human Systems, Final Report, Synthesis and Assessment Product 4.6â, 2008.\n\nThis course includes a multiple-choice quiz at the end, which is designed to enhance the understanding of the course materials. PDH Course Description: This course covers the general format, content and purpose of a Special Provision that could be used in a set of contract documents for an infrastructure project such as a roadway, drainage or utility improvement. The course describes the basic format of a Special Provision by defining its purpose, identifies the various types of Special Provisions, and explains the importance of proper grammar for the communication of the intent of any design team faced with the task of writing a Special Provision.\n\nCompletion of this course will provide the student with an understanding of the issues to be covered by a Special Provision in a typical set of contract documents. This will provide the student with a basis for discussion with the team or project manager on each assignment. This in turn can reduce false starts, provide specific direction to the various disciplines involved and prepare questions for the client from a pro-active position. The result is intended to be a savings in labor spent on corrections and re-typing of text, which will result in the completion of a project within the budget. This course draws on the author's extensive experience with contract documents to provide valuable project execution tips that can save your project cost and schedule. Several minutes of discussion during the kick-off of a project can prevent costly last minute changes.\n\nThis course is a \"How To\" for preparing the format and text of Special Provisions for a project. Any engineer involved in preparing the contract documents for infrastructure / roadway plans will benefit from the lessons learned by the course author from a career that has spanned three decades and has seen hundreds of sets of plans and special provisions.\n\nThis course includes a multiple-choice quiz at the end, which is designed to enhance the understanding of the course materials.

PDH Course Description: This course is written specifically for the purpose of providing a basic understanding of adhesive systems. It is a very broad subject so we are limiting the descriptive information to adhesives only and omitting sealants, thread locking adhesives, potting compounds, encapsulating compounds, gasketing materials, etc. These subjects are very interesting but complex to the point of deserving a more detailed look on an individual basis. We will concentrate solely on adhesives products used for bonding two or more substrates together. When we say systems, we are referring to 1.) Adhesives types and selection, 2.) Cleaning and pretreatment of substrates and 3.) Joint design. All three areas are integral to successful bonding, and accomplished properly, can provide for prolonged operational life. We also cover adhesive history, global markets, adhesive uses, standards and testing methods and equipment. By the end of the course, we want to impart a fundamental understanding of an industry that has significant annual growth and represents an important technology. We hope to pique your interest to the point of wanting to know more and providing a solid foundation upon which to build.\n\nThis course includes a multiple choice quiz at the end, which is designed to enhance the understanding of the course materials. PDH Course Description: The course on Light-Cure Adhesives will introduce the student to a method of obtaining extremely rapid cure times for adhesive materials. These materials react to UV and visible light in a fashion that can provide a permanent âsetâ in less than a minute. Curing in the presents of UV light has been usable technology for quite some time but the development of materials that will cure when subjected to visible light are fairly new to the adhesive industry. These materials react differently than other adhesives material classifications. We will explore the chemical mechanism by which this is possible as well as 1.) Mechanical characteristics, 2.) Material categories, 3.) Equipment necessary to project light on the substrates, 4.) Applications, 5.) Benefits and 6.) Safety aspects of the light cure process. We also will take a quick look at those vendors selling into the marketplace and specialty materials available for difficult jobs. When completed, the student will have a working knowledge of light cure adhesives and will be able to talk intelligently with vendors and professionals in the adhesive field.\n\nThis course includes a multiple choice quiz at the end, which is designed to enhance the understanding of the course materials. PDH Course Description: In response to a scientific consensus linking greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human activities to global climate change, many local governments are looking inwards to identify opportunities to reduce GHG emissions not only from their communities, but also from their own operations. Local governments can inventory the emissions from their operations in order to track their performance and ensure that their actions do reduce GHG emissions. This GHG inventory is often referred to as a carbon footprint and is the foundation of actions to address climate change. Complete, consistent and accurate measurement enables local governments to assess their risks and opportunities, track their progress, and create a strategy to reduce emissions in a quantifiable and transparent way.\n\nThis course is deigned to provide a standardized method for quantifying and reporting GHG emissions associated with their government operations.\n\nThe text for this course is the âLocal Government Operations Protocol, Version 1.0, September 2008â developed by the California Air Resources Board, the California Climate Action Registry, ICLEI â Local Governments for Sustainability, and the Climate Registry. Also included as a text is the draft âInternational Local Government GHG Emissions Analysis Protocolâ published by the ICLEI.\n\nThis course includes a multiple-choice quiz at the end, which is designed to enhance the understanding of the course materials. PDH Course Description: In response to a scientific consensus linking greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human activities to global climate change, many organizations are looking inwards to identify opportunities to reduce GHG emissions not only from their operations, but also from the electricity they purchase from outside utilities.. Organizations can inventory the emissions from their operations in order to track their performance and ensure that their actions do reduce GHG emissions, but how do they estimate the GHG. This is extremely important given the cap and trade legislation being considered by the US Congress.\n\nThe World Resources Instituteâs (WRI) GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard helps companies and other organizations to identify, calculate, and report GHG emissions. It is designed to set the standard for accurate, complete, consistent, relevant and transparent accounting and reporting of GHG emissions by companies and organizations, including information on setting organizational and operational boundaries, tracking emissions over time, and reporting emissions. It also provides guidance on GHG accounting and reporting principles, business goals and inventory design, managing inventory quality, accounting for GHG reductions, verification of GHG emissions, and setting a GHG target.\n\nThe revised edition has been designed with the following objectives in mind:\n\nPromote greater consistency, transparency and quality in corporate GHG accounting and reporting practices through the use of standardized approaches and principles;\n\nSimplify and reduce the costs of corporate GHG accounting and;\n\nProvide business with information that can be used to build an effective strategy to manage and reduce emissions;\n\nProvide information that facilitates business participation in different GHG programs, including trading, registries, and other GHG reduction efforts; and\n\nIncrease consistency in GHG accounting and reporting between different GHG programs.\n\nThe Greenhouse Gas Protocol for Project Accounting report, released in December 2005, is a tool for determining the greenhouse gas emission reduction benefits of climate mitigation projects.\n\nThe report provides specific principles, concepts, and methods for quantifying and reporting GHG reductions â i.e., the decreases in GHG emissions, or increases in removals and/or storage.\n\nThis course is deigned to provide a standardized method for quantifying and reporting GHG emissions associated with industrial operations.\n\nThe texts for this course are âGHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standardâ and âGreenhouse Gas Protocol for Project Accountingâ. Both of these can be downloaded by going to the World Resources Institute website at www.wri.org and clicking on the publications page and searching for the titles or hitting the links provided on the titles.\n\nThe course includes a multiple-choice quiz at the end, which is designed to enhance the understanding of the course materials.

PDH Course Description: There are numerous definitions for sustainability. In order to provide a more complete picture of sustainability, a common definition needs to be agreed upon. One of the most common definitions was prepared by the World Commission on Environment and Development and published in 1987. This organization defined sustainability as âmeeting the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs.â\n\nIn a sustainable society nothing is wasted or released to the environment. The wastes and byproducts are either recycled or reused either by the facility or other industries. A product, once it has reached its useful life is recycled or repaired and reused.\n\nMany organizations look upon sustainability as a union of three distinct areas: environmental sustainability, economic sustainability, and social or ethical sustainability. This concept has often been referred to as âthe triple bottom lineâ or âthe three eâsâ. In the past, organizations have used the word âorâ as in environmental sustainability or economic viability, environmental sustainability or social (ethical) progress, social progress or economic viability. Sustainability concepts replace the âorâ with âandâ.\n\nOnce a commitment has been made to promote sustainability, it is important to report progress on sustainability efforts in a balanced and reasonable manner.\n\nThis course is designed for those organizations who are already promoting sustainability and covers the two main guidelines for reporting sustainability statistics, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).\n\nThe texts for this course are âSustainability Reporting Guidelines, Global Reporting Initiative\", Version 3.0, 2006.\n\nThis course includes a multiple-choice quiz at the end, which is designed to enhance the understanding of the course materials.

The benefits and drawbacks are discussed in depth as well as areas of interest when considering implementation. We devote considerable time towards planning, implementation and manageability of the system and discuss in depth the following: Ten(10) questions to ask when considering implementation of RFID technology Standards, both domestic and international Manageability of systems RFID adoption guidelines Complete list of vendors Extended glossary of terms Each component required for operation is discussed in detail as well as the software necessary to âdrive the system.â The subject of privacy is an ongoing concern so this is presented as a âblockâ for discussion.\n\nThis course includes a multiple-choice quiz which presents the student with an opportunity to use the principles taught in the course. PDH Course Description: Every year a few volcanoes erupt with sufficient intensity somewhere around the world to cause significant disruption to our modern way of life and capture our full attention to the remarkable event that is taking place. For example, the recent eruption of Eyjafjallajokull, in Iceland, has disrupted for weeks on end the pattern of air flights to and from major airports around the world. Similarly, the eruption Mount Merapi, in Indonesia, has forced the shortening of a presidential visit to the Far East. Of course these disturbances are in addition to the real havoc, destruction and the loss of life that these volcanic eruptions cause in their immediate vicinity.\n\nUnderstandably volcanoes have always terrified mankind. Yet it should be remembered that they also play a constructive role in shaping the very top layer of the earth on which we all live. Volcanoes are the source of some of the worldâs richest soils, the site of some of the most magnificent vistas and scenic views we all enjoy, and they also replenish our accessible mineral, gas and water resources.\n\nFollowing a brief introduction of the myths and fanciful speculations that surrounded the subject of volcanic eruptions throughout most of human history, this course explains how our modern understanding of this mighty natural phenomenon began to develop. Starting with a description of the internal structure of the earth, which we now know is composed of a dense core with a radius of about 3,400 km, a lighter mantle that is about 2,900 km thick, and a still lighter crust that is mostly rigid and up to 60 km in thickness, the course proceeds to explain our present understanding of the processes that are active within the deep reaches of our planet and how these processes lead to the development and the eruption of volcanoes. The concepts of plate tectonics and subduction, whereas an oceanic plate is pushed under the leading edge of a continental plate, are also explained and illustrated.\n\nBased on their mode of origin and distinctive internal morphology, four main types of volcanoes can be recognized namely: Cinder Cones, Composite Cones, Shield Volcanoes, and Lava Domes. Next, the volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI), a scale to estimate the size of volcanic eruptions, is presented and its use by volcanologists to compare quantitatively the magnitude of volcanic eruptions worldwide explained.\n\nThe next section of the course describes some of the historically famous volcanic eruptions. This part of the course is followed by a section on Supervolcanoes that explains how these oversized features are identified from their geologic record and the size of their eruptions estimated.\n\nLastly, a glossary of terms and acronyms used in this course is presented following the Summary Section. It will provide the students with a handy reference to assist them in following the concepts that are presented and discussed throughout the text.\n\nThis course on volcanoes is presented as a complement to courses G175-Earthquakes: Basic Principles and G207-Tsunamis: Basic Principles for the benefit of those students who want to learn more about the deep seated processes in our earth that are responsible for the generation of these natural phenomena. However, courses G175 and G207 are not pre-requisites for taking this course. This course on volcanoes is a stand-alone presentation that can be taken independently of the other two.\n\nThis course includes a multiple-choice quiz at the end, which is designed to enhance the understanding of the course materials. PDH Course Description: The basis for many of the decisions we make as individuals, as groups of individuals, like a family or researchers, and institutions such as corporations or the government are rooted in Probability Theory. The reason Probability Theory exists is summed up by the famous quote: âItâs tough to make predictions, especially about the future.â (According to Wikipedia, this quote is attributed to many people, including Yogi Berra, Niels Bohr, Samuel Goldwyn, Robert Storm Petersen, and Mark Twain). Some of our probability-based decisions are trivial: the weather said 40% chance of rain today so Iâll take my umbrella. Others are potentially life changing like where to invest my IRA money or when contemplating a career change. The more critical the decision, the more emotion is involved. But underlying all of our emotions is the mathematics of probability and whether we feel we can âbeat the oddsâ. This course is designed for the non-mathematician to learn some of the important and interesting (that is, non-intuitive and counter-intuitive) aspects of probability theory as applied to our professional and personal lives.\n\nThis course includes a multiple choice quiz at the end, which is designed to enhance the understanding of the course materials. PDH Course Description: The topic of great earthquakes and associated tsunamis is examined in this course through the characteristics and impacts of the Great Japan Tohoku-oki Earthquake and Tsunami that struck Northeastern Honshu on March 11, 2011. This disaster came first in the form of an earthquake so powerful that it knocked the earth off its axis of rotation. This great earthquake and its ensuing devastating tsunami resulted in about 20,000 fatalities and caused major damage and destruction to buildings, infrastructure and nuclear power plants in the coastal zone of Northeastern Japan. That region was violently shaken and flooded, resulting in large societal disruptions and grave socio-economic consequences.\n\nThe forces within the earth that generated this epic disaster are examined. Every detail of this tragedy was recorded real-time by seismic instruments thus enabling scientists to reconstruct and know exactly what happened. Combined with extensive recordings from global seismic networks, the data from these multitudes of gauges and sensors make this seismic event the best recorded in history. The flood of these real time data confirmed the value of applying modern technologies to earthquake and tsunami mitigation efforts. In addition, strain accumulation measurements, offshore fault-zone observations, and early detection and warning of earthquake and tsunami all contributed to some extent in saving lives in the most heavily damaged areas.\n\nThe tectonic plates that cover the earthâs surface are presented and the segment along the boundary between the two plates that was dislocated during the occurrence of this great earthquake is highlighted. The instantaneous strain release which occurred at the plate boundary was so large that it generated seismic, tsunami and atmospheric waves that spread through the Earth. The course describes the types of seismic waves that are generated by an earthquake and explains which of these waves are likely to cause the most damage as they propagate away from the epicenter. The course also explains how these seismic waves are used to elucidate the internal structure of the Earth, showing that it is composed of a thin crust resting on an upper mantle and below which is a lower mantle, an outer core and an inner core.\n\nThe propagation of the seismic waves, outward from the epicenter, and the effect of seismic shaking on various types of engineered structures, including the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, are presented. The process leading to the formation of the initial tsunami swell, its collapse and the development of the immense waves that spread in all directions is illustrated in a sequence of diagrams that clarify the process of tsunami generation and propagation. In addition, the postulated mechanism that resulted in the amplification of the initial tsunami swell, adding to the built-in destructive force of its waves as they spread towards the shore, is advanced with supportive evidence. The course concludes with the presentation of the current thinking about effective strategies developed to protect vulnerable populations from the devastating effects of tsunamis. Finally the equations used to compute the velocity of seismic waves are presented in the appendix.\n\nThis course includes a multiple-choice quiz at the end, which is designed to enhance the understanding of the course materials. PDH Course Description: Engineering ethics must keep pace with the explosive acceleration in the mind sciences in order to prevent society from developing into elite technified hybrid people machines and âhave notsâ at the lower rungs of society. The importance of ethics can not be overstated as technology outpaces our ethics and laws.\n\nPlease, we invite you to open the course first page that illustrates the course content pictorially.\n\nOur brains intermediate absolutely anything we feel emotionally and tactilely, think, sense and do. Brains function as our ultimate interfaces and as âneuromediaâ to each environment consciously experienced in the universe by us. Humankind is increasingly confronted with the task of understanding brains and minds at various levels of analysis in order for scientists to engineer their functions.\n\nOur ethical challenge involves directing scientific research and development for each type of rehabilitation of disorders, cognitive improvement, creation of instruments for observation or replacing lost functions of the brain. Computer technology and engineering increased rapidly from the 1930s with brain technology and engineering using that technology, but leaving engineering ethics in their wake.\n\nThis explosive development within the neurosciences during the late 20th and 21st century requires the need for new subdivisions of ethics within the field of âapplied biomedical ethics.â These new subdivisions of applied ethics are called âneuroethicsâ and âethics of consciousness.â As with the neurosciences, neuroethics brings forth a combination of interdisplinary studies, such as biomechanical engineering, biology, medicine, law, philosophy, cognitive psychology, computer science and engineering. Like no other ethics, this form of engineering ethics affects everyone---us.\n\nâEngineering Ethics: Consciousness and Neuroethicsâ (EECN) provides a brief analysis of three important ethical principles and theories with visual aids. EECN applies rational ethical principles to actual problems we now face in the US and must handle within our globalizing world in the near future. From the analysis and illustration of âglobal information revolutionsâ to the personal effects of computer chips surgically implanted within the brains of patients, we delve into the intimately personal problems that deal directly with consciousness. We peer into who we are and how that may change soon with new technologies.\n\nEECN tackles the problems concerning lie detection via fMRIs with current technologies. Advances in neuroscience and engineering will transform our criminal justice system. The day is at hand when this technology will affect you and me, us. Likewise, the development and research of neurotechnologies and engineering by the military, serve multiple uses and play important roles in competition and war. What are the legal consequences and ethical considerations associated with this engineering technology? We provide up-to-date facts concerning significant technologies related to: artificial intelligence, rehabilitation and enhancement of various types of human performance via the neurosciences, including stimulants for soldiers or students to stay awake, robots controlled by thought and electrodes attached to the skull, and microchips implanted within the inner ear that communicate via radio waves.\n\nThe second chapter is about consciousness; half the chapter consists of illustrations about consciousness and the mind. Neuroscience experiments related to the âfreedom of the willâ or our âvoluntaryâ aspects of behavior are set out. Problems concerning understanding the mind and the development of consciousness are illustrated.\n\nWe conclude that neuroscience and consciousness studies are still in their infancy and have unbounded growth potential. Lastly, âNeuroethics, Legal Systems and Ethics of Consciousnessâ provides an overview of duty, virtue, consequentialist ethics and neuroethics. Neuroethics is applied to law and war as well as issues concerning the rehabilitation and enhancement of consciousness and especially cognitive skills, which is compared to the use of steroids in sports.\n\nThis course includes a multiple-choice quiz at the end, which is designed to enhance the understanding of course materials. PDH Course Description: In 1968, at the height of the Vietnam War, fourteen-thousand Americans died in combat and another forty-six thousand were wounded. That same year, on the home-front, an equal number of Americans died in their workplace/s and two and one-half million suffered disabling injuries resulting from workplace accidents. The time had come to make the workplace safer and healthier for all Americans, not by chance but by the power of law.\n\nAfter the Civil War, American industry expanded rapidly and by the early 20th century, millions of new immigrants were seeking a better life in the mills, factories, quarries of American industry. For many, the conditions were harsh and dangerous; just as they were for Americans who were native born. The construction of the Panama Canal took the lives of 4,700 people alone. Between 1902 and 1908, nearly fifteen-thousand railroad workers were killed and in a single Pennsylvania county in one year, five hundred and twenty-six workers were killed.\n\nIt took calamities like the Triangle Shirt Waist Factory fire in New York City (1911) for action to be taken. Upton Sinclairâs novel: The Jungle, exposed the brutal working conditions in Chicagoâs meat packing plants and photographer Lewis Hinesâ photographs of child labor aroused the public consciousness. In the post-WWII era of public activism over environmental issues and civil rights, a workerâs rights movement â long in the making, reached critical mass. In response, the federal government formed the Occupational Safety & Heath Administration (OSHA) in 1970 under the auspices of the Department of Labor to safeguard the right of all Americans to a safe and healthful workplace.\n\nThis course includes a multiple-choice quiz at the end, which is designed to enhance the understanding of the course materials. PDH Course Description: Additive manufacturing is also referred to as 3D printing and consists of a layer-by-layer technique of producing three-dimensional objects directly from a digital model. The following quote from the February 10, 2011 issue of The Economist captures some of the excitement associated with this emerging technology. âThree-dimensional printing makes it as cheap to create single items as it is to produce thousands and thus undermines economies of scale. It may have as profound an impact on the world as the coming of the factory did. Just as nobody could have predicted the impact of the steam engine in 1750 or the printing press in 1450 or the transistor in 1950, it is impossible to foresee the long-term impact of 3D printing. But the technology is coming, and it is likely to disrupt every field it touches.â This course presents a brief description of the additive manufacturing industry and its most prominent near-term technical challenges along with emerging research and development topics that show promise for significant advancement of the field. In addition the role of the Federal Government in advancing this new field is discussed along with reference for additional information for further study and investigation.\n\nThis course includes a multiple-choice quiz at the end, which is designed to enhance the understanding of the course materials. PDH Course Description: The Need to Read â its been part of human DNA since the time of the Sumerians when cuneiform letters were engraved in clay tablets to record for posterity the Epic of Gilgamesh. As time went by, printing technology steadily advanced from parchment to paper, but the big breakthrough came with the invention of the printing press whereby an army of scribes was no longer required to âget the word out.â Though the scribe had become redundant with the invention of the typewriter, printing â even on a large scale, still retained much of the skill required of the medieval craftsman. With the introduction of mechanical typesetting machines in the late 19th Century, the industry was poised to expand exponentially. Though hand-setting of type still had applications, the ability to produce type via Monotype and/or Linotype machines was a major breakthrough and by the middle of the 20th Century, the printing industry was ranked as fourth largest in the United States. Ancillary industries such as lumber (for wood pulp to make newsprint), transportation etc. contributed significantly to the national economy as well. When you think about it, almost every industry, art, science, human activity etc. is dependent on recording human thought via language. With advances in technology came more efficient typesetting machines that use computers to do much of the former grunt work. Photo-engraving allows for high-quality printing of display ads and/or photographs. No matter how sophisticated the technology of printing becomes, it all boils down to twenty-six letters arranged in a precise order for the human brain to decipher and interpret in its own individual way.\n\nThis course includes a multiple-choice quiz at the end, which is designed to enhance the understanding of the course materials. PDH Course Description: When the first European settlers arrived in North America, they found a vast land covered with primeval forests which presented more of an obstacle than a resource. Trees had limited use as a building material and/or a fuel in those early days thus trees were often cut and burned as a waste material. With the establishment of saw mills (at first powered by running water), the great natural resource of the forest became a âcash cropâ to be exploited.\n\nBy the late 19th Century, clear cutting forest lands and the despoiling of the soil became an endemic national problem. In 1891, the federal government stepped in and set aside vast âreservesâ of forest lands lest they share the fate of uncontrolled logging. This did not mean that logging could not occur on these lands, but it had to be done in a way we would term âenvironmentally friendlyâ today. As a renewable resource, trees are only renewable if care is taken in their harvest from the forest. Under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Forest Service was established to safeguard this national treasure.\n\nTrees provide shade, beauty, habitats for wildlife and are oxygen factories for planet earth. For mankind, they provide the raw material for numerous products such as wood pulp (for making newsprint paper, plastics etc.), framing and/or finish lumber, plies for making plywood/veneers and serve as the basis for making patterns by which metal castings can be made. Without wood, many industries such as paper mills, textile manufacturers etc. would be unable to produce a finish product. In wartime, wood was used to replace consumer goods enabling strategic metals to be directed to the war effort. In these many varied ways, wood truly is âour friend.â\n\nThis course includes a multiple-choice quiz at the end, which is designed to enhance the understanding of the course materials. PDH Course Description: Ah, but a manâs reach should exceed his grasp or whatâs a heaven for?\n\nSo wrote the poet Robert Browning of manâs eternal longing to fly with the same ease as did the birds. Greek mythology immortalized the first person to seek winged flight, but Icarus flew too close to the sun (on wings made of wax) and alas, he became the first victim of the quest for flight. Ancient civilizations honored their deities by imposing wings on them suggesting their superior status to earth-bound mortals. By the time of the renaissance, it became apparent to the brilliant minds of the day that if man were to fly, it would not be by his own power but with the assistance of machines and a deeper understanding of aerodynamics.\n\nLighter-than-air balloons would be the first means by which humans would actually fly (in the 18th Century). But powered flight could not occur until the invention of a suitable power source was realized and the air foil concept fully understood. One day in December 1903, it all came together when two bicycle mechanics â Orville and Wilbur Wright, flipped a coin to see who would have the honor of testing their Wright Flyer. Orville won the toss and became the first man to achieve sustained powered flight, brief though it was.\n\nOn the heels of that simple act on the dunes of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, a new page was written in the history of mankind. Out of necessity, WWI accelerated the development of the airplane and in 1927, a 25yo airmail pilot named Charles Lindburgh proved that fortune favors the bold by flying his monoplane across the Atlantic. By the 1930s, aeronautical engineering was an established science and aviation a major industry. During WWII, aircraft production soared and in the post-war era, the jet-engine would make long-distance air travel a practical reality. We have much to thank Icarus for.\n\nThis course includes a multiple-choice quiz at the end, which is designed to enhance the understanding of the course materials. PDH Course Description: In 1905 â nearly three years after the Wright Brothers flew four successful controlled, powered flights near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina on December 17th 1903, Wilbur Wright was asked: What was the purpose of flying machines? He responded with just one word: War.\n\nAs far as the United States Army was concerned, the airplane was unnecessary since they already had observation balloons and what else would flying machines be good for except observation? But the Wrights were persistent and some enlightened army officers saw the potential for powered flight. Thus, by 1908 the Wright Brothers had their first army contract. Their Wright Flyer fulfilled the terms of the contract by flying for over one hour at a sustained speed of forty-two mph. In the years before Americaâs entry into WWI (April 1917), airplane technology steadily advanced and the outbreak of the war in Europe (August 1914) accelerated aviation technology many fold.\n\nAt first, the airplane had the limited role of observation for both the allied and central powers â just as the military purists had foreseen. On observation flights, the opposing pilots would, at first, wave to each other. As the war progressed, waves turned to pistol shots and with the addition of machine guns, the aerial dogfight was born. Though primitive, the potential of war in the third dimension â the air, was fully realized during WWI. The years between the world wars saw the steady advancement of aviation technology culminating at the end of WWII with jet aircraft. The cold war hastened even greater advancements resulting in the breaking of the sound barrier and space flight. Wilbur Wright may have been prophetic in his vision.\n\nThis course includes a multiple-choice quiz at the end, which is designed to enhance the understanding of the course materials. PDH Course Description: For a century before the first European settler cut down a section of forest and cleared away the stumps for a homestead farm, the fur trade was dominant. However, for most of its history, the economy of the United States was based on agriculture. The needs of a growing population, the abundance of fertile land and technological advances such as the cotton gin (which tripled the value of cotton farm land overnight) established farming of both crops and livestock as the nationâs primary industry, even to the present day.\n\nWhen early pioneers reached the Tennessee Valley, they cleared the trees from the hillsides and cut into the sides of the hills rather than along their natural contours. Erosion was the result and what was once prime land became a scar on the earth. Contour farming, damning rivers (to control flooding and provide water in quantity when/where needed) and modern agricultural practice made the valley fertile once more. A similar misuse of the 400 million acres of the Great Plains "
