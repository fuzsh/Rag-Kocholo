However if you’re looking to create multiple websites, then you’ll need to upgrade to a higher plan.\n\n​Does SiteGround use cPanel?\n\nNo, SiteGround does not use cPanel. They have built a custom control panel to offer an improved user experience. This has allowed them to add more premium tools similar to WP Engine.\n\n​Between SiteGround, WP Engine, and Bluehost, only Bluehost still offers cPanel hosting. Even though Bluehost has created a custom control panel as well, you can click on the Advanced menu to access cPanel inside Bluehost.\n\nDoes WP Engine offer email accounts?\n\nNo, WP Engine does not offer email accounts. They specialize in managed WordPress hosting services and prefer that you use specialized business email address solutions like Google Workspace (G Suite).\n\nBluehost and SiteGround on the other hand both offer free business email addresses that you can create from your account area. Bluehost also let you purchase premium business emails from Office365 right inside the Bluehost dashboard.\n\nIf you’re looking to fix email deliverability for sending bulk emails, then all providers recommend that you use a reliable third-party SMTP service with the WP Mail SMTP plugin.\n\nFor sending marketing emails, we recommend that you use a proper email marketing service. Here’s a list of the best email marketing services.\n\nWhy is SiteGround so expensive?\n\nWhen comparing with other shared hosting providers like Bluehost, HostGator, Dreamhost, etc, SiteGround pricing can definitely be considered more expensive. However it’s because they have significantly improved their infrastructure by making the switch to Google Cloud platform. They have also built advanced caching to boost performance, powerful development tools like Staging sites, Git workflows, Ultrafast PHP, WP CLI support, and more.\n\nPreviously you’d have to upgrade to a managed WordPress hosting provider to get these powerful features. Now SiteGround offers these to small businesses at a more affordable price.\n\nIt’s really not fair to compare SiteGround prices with other shared hosting companies anymore because they’re truly creating a new category for premium WordPress hosting.\n\nWhen do you need managed WordPress hosting?\n\nAs a beginner, you might be wondering is managed WordPress hosting really that much better? If so, then when is the right time to upgrade to managed WordPress hosting.\n\nWe have covered all of this in our detailed guide on when do you need managed WordPress hosting.\n\nBut in summary, if you’re just starting a blog or a small business website, then you don’t need managed WordPress hosting.\n\nAs your website grows, and you start getting high-traffic, then we recommend considering a managed platform, so you can delegate the technical side and focus on growing your business.\n\nHowever if you have the budget to spend a bit more for exceptional service, then you can use managed hosting at any time you’re ready.\n\nAre there other hosting providers that you haven’t covered in this comparison?\n\nYes there are literally thousands of web hosting companies in the market including HostGator, GoDaddy, Dreamhost, InMotion Hosting, Hostinger, GreenGeeks, Pagely, Liquid Web, Kinsta, A2 hosting, etc.\n\nWe only compared SiteGround vs Bluehost vs WP Engine because they’re the most popular WordPress hosting companies.\n\nDo you have any special discounts for SiteGround, Bluehost, or WP Engine?\n\nYes, because WPBeginner is the largest WordPress resource site, our users can get special discounts on popular hosting providers as well as other WordPress plugins.
