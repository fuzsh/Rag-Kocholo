(It doesn't matter if there's something better than Cubase--I'm invested in Cubase.) I also own some very cool plugins that I use within Divi.\n\nBut I need a WP host. And I'm not sure if in a year I want to pay $150 a year to host it.\n\nAnd why did you choose it? Price? Speed? Reliability?

And are you wanting your new wordpress host to offer email service as well, or strictly web hosting? One possibility is lock in multi-year on sale under new email address with siteground. Can get the relatively expensive \"GoGeek\" plan for cheap that way, but, that plan is more cost effective if you run multiple sites, email, etc.\n\nI've helped folks on, been an affiliate for, and personally used siteground, ionos, wp-engine, hostgator, godaddy, and others for wordpress, and also more marketing-oriented platforms including clickfunnels, leadpages, infusionsoft, shopify, convertri, etc. and... I share your favorable view that \"for the money\" siteground is quite solid. But they are not the cheapest. I also tend to avoid hosts that are in the EIG (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance_International_Group). Others may be able to report favorable experiences with them, but I can not.\n\nAs you probably already know, siteground is moving their hosting onto the google cloud platform, so while I don't have direct knowledge of this possibility... I wonder if you could get a cheap or free wp hosting on google cloud? I did a quick quora search that (https://www.quora.com/Can-I-host-my...ever-using-their-Always-Free-Products?share=1) and it seems possible, but with some work/effort down the road. One of those time vs. money kinds of things.\n\nIf you didn't need or at some point no longer needed divi-specific wp hosting, I would recommend this up-n-comer in the marketing space (with a free lifetime plan) that is a bit divi-visual-builder like and supports basic commerce (think infoproducts more than full multi-product ecom store). If you're wanting to migrate dozens of posts and pages... maybe not the right fit, but for a simple site, its going to be quite a contender."
