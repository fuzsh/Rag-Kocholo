With Piwik PRO, we can accurately track the source of our conversions and invest our budget in the right online channels.\n\nTHOMAS QUAST\n\nONLINE STRATEGY SPECIALIST AT HDI GLOBAL SE\n\nGreiner AG uses Piwik PRO Analytics to see important details of how employees use the intranet, details they couldn’t get with built-in analytics.\n\nThanks to Piwik PRO Intranet Analytics we can manage our internal content more effectively and find areas that need improvement. It helps us identify the most engaged employees, so we can make the most of their potential and show appropriate recognition for their actions. We’re very satisfied with the product and our cooperation with Piwik PRO.\n\nPHILIPP KIRCHMEIR\n\nIT APPLICATION CONSULTANT AT GREINER AG\n\nSVC, operator of an electronic administration platform for the Austrian social security system, achieved a 12.8% increase in service quality with data-based optimization of the user experience.\n\nOur core goal is to optimize and increase the user experience based on data. Piwik PRO Analytics Suite combines all the necessary features to achieve this goal. From the analysis and evaluation of channels to target group segmentation and planning of suitable content, we now have a solution with which we can implement everything.\n\nGEROLD BRAUCHART\n\nESV PROJECT MANAGEMENT AT SVC\n\nThe Austrian Social Science Data Archive (AUSSDA) uses Piwik PRO Analytics Suite on their website to support growth and achieve GDPR compliance.\n\nFor us as a relatively new institution, it is important to increase our visibility within the community. With Piwik PRO, we monitor the effectiveness of our marketing channels, so we can optimize our communication strategy and verify that we are using our energy for the right approach.\n\nDR. LARS KACZMIREK\n\nHEAD OF AUSSDA\n\nXS4ALL, the oldest internet service providers in the Netherlands, puts their customers’ security and privacy first with Piwik PRO Analytics Suite\n\nWe started looking for a new tool because of security and privacy reasons. Because we didn’t want to share our customer’s data with third parties, especially those not based in Europe, Google Analytics wasn’t an option. Piwik PRO was the only platform that fully met our needs (…)\n\nERIK VAN DER KOOIJ\n\nHEAD OF DIGITAL AT XS4ALL\n\nCandid, the world’s first marcom platform organization, offering a full set of modern media, creative and data agencies, partnered with Piwik PRO on their journey to full GDPR compliance\n\nWe teamed up with Piwik PRO over two years ago, not only for our own platform, but also for our customers. We’re working side by side with Piwik PRO to make sure that our customers’ first-party data is properly collected and used. Candid’s philosophy is to be open and curious, working with Piwik PRO enhances this.\n\nGÉRARD GHAZARIAN\n\nFOUNDER & CEO AT CANDID\n\nTecAlliance, an independent service provider for the automotive aftermarket, uses Piwik PRO to optimize their product and improve user experience through analysis of behavioral data\n\nWe need information about the way in which customers work and interact with our product. With the data collected from Piwik PRO, we can optimize our product to meet customer requirements and effectively allocate our development resources.\n\nDR. BARTOSCH BELKIUS\n\nVICE PRESIDENT ANALYTICS AT TECALLIANCE GMBH\n\nThree Palms Media, an American marketing agency, found Piwik PRO to be the perfect alternative to both Google Analytics and Matomo\n\nThe main reason we switched to Piwik PRO was having everything managed by someone, not having to take care of the open source thing ourselves. Previously we had a lot of issues, which was stressful because sometimes we wanted to access our data and it wasn’t working, and it took up to a week to get things back on track. We don’t have to worry about that now and it saves us a lot of time and resources.\n\nINGO HAUPT\n\nCEO AT THREE PALMS MEDIA\n\nPersonally identifiable information (PII) and personal data are two classifications of data that often confuse organizations that collect, store and analyze such data. Both terms cover common ground, classifying information that could reveal an individual’s identity directly or indirectly. PII is used in the US, but no specific legal document defines it.
