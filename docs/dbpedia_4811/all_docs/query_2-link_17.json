        "text": "Hi Matthew,\n\nTo add to what has already been mentioned by KFSys.\n\nItâs great to hear about your good experience with Siteground, especially with their quick support.\n\nDigitalOcean is very user-friendly, especially if you want to set up things quickly. They have something called 1-click Droplets available on the Marketplace. This means you can start a website, a blog, or other online services with just a click. It saves a lot of time with the initial server configuration.\n\nAbout customer support: The support system here is a bit different but equally efficient in its own way. DigitalOcean has a strong emphasis on community support, with an extensive library of tutorials, Q&A, and a vibrant community forum. This rich resource of information allows users to find answers quickly and learn in the process.\n\nFor direct support, DigitalOcean offers different levels, including ticket-based support for all users and premium support plans for businesses requiring more immediate assistance. The support team is knowledgeable, especially about complex, technical issues, which can be a huge asset if youâre managing sophisticated projects or infrastructure.\n\nAlso, if you like DigitalOcean but want something a bit more like Siteground, you can use Cloudways. Cloudways is a service that works with DigitalOcean to make things even easier to manage, like handling a website or an online store.\n\nIn short, DigitalOcean is great if you like to have more control and learn new things as you will have root access to your servers.\n\nHappy hosting!\n\nBobby"
