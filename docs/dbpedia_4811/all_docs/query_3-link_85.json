        "text": "A slug is the user-friendly part of the URL that tells site visitors what a page is about. For example, this article’s URL is https://translatepress.com/blog/translating-url-slugs and the slug is simply “translating-url-slugs.” So you would assume the page is about translating URL slugs, and you would be right.\n\nBut what if the URL slug is in a language different from the rest of the page content?\n\nWhen creating a multilingual WordPress website, translating URL slugs is an important part of the process. Not only are translated slugs really important for WordPress SEO but they help improve the user experience too.\n\nIn this post, we’ll take a look at why you should translate URL slugs, the process for translating slugs for pages, posts, custom post types, WooCommerce products and we’ll finish up with some best practice tips.\n\nWhy Translate URL Slugs?\n\nWhen you create a blog post, page, or product, WordPress will autogenerate the slug based on the title, like so:\n\nAnd here’s what it looks like with the Gutenberg editor:\n\nKeep in mind, you need to have “Post name”—aka pretty permalinks—enabled in WordPress for human-readable URL slugs.\n\nYou can edit slugs in WordPress, which is always recommended before publishing a post or page. Generally, writing good URL slugs that include keywords and exclude stop words can have a positive effect on your SEO. Keywords are one of the indicators search engines use to determine what a page is about.\n\nFor example, say you’ve got a post on your English language blog about killer whales titled “Everything You Need to Know About Killer Whales.” Rather than include the whole title in the slug (e.g. /everything-you-need-to-know-about-killer-whales/) it’s best to shorten the URL slug and include the main keywords only (e.g. /killer-whales/).\n\nWhen translating the killer whale blog post into other languages, you’ll want to translate the URL slug, too. Not only does translating slugs mean visitors can read in their preferred language but it also provides a consistent user experience (i.e. you’re translating all your content, not just some of it).\n\nFor example, when translating the killer whale post URL slug into other languages, you would get:\n\nEnglish: https://example.com/en/killer-whales\n\nGerman: https://example.com/de/killerwale\n\nSpanish: https://es.example.com/wiki/Orcinus_orca\n\nTogether with the page title and description, these three pieces of information help users decide whether they want to visit your page.\n\nMaking sure a translated URL appears in the search results for your content not only ensures your international visitors can read your URLs but indicates to them the rest of the content is translated too.\n\nHow to Translate URL Slugs with TranslatePress\n\nEditing slugs in WordPress is easy—just open a post or page in the backend of your site and edit the slug, as we explored above.\n\nBut URL slug translation? You’ll need a translation plugin and the best WordPress plugin for the job is TranslatePress.\n\nTranslatePress lets you translate your entire WordPress site directly from the front end using an intuitive visual translation interface. More importantly, it also lets you automatically and manually translate URL slugs.\n\nWith TranslatePress, you can:\n\nTranslate URL slugs for posts, pages, custom post types, and WooCommerce products.\n\nTranslate custom URLs that are added directly to the HTML (without using PHP functions to construct them) such as those added to post content.\n\nTranslate external links that take visitors to third-party sites.\n\nTranslate URLs for media such as images, videos, documents, and archive files.\n\nGetting Started with TranslatePress\n\nTranslatePress is easy to set up. Simply choose your desired TranslatePress plan and download it from your account after purchase.\n\nThen install it on your site just like you would any other plugin (from Plugins → Add New→ Upload Plugin).\n\nTo translate URL slugs, you’ll also need the SEO Pack addon (included with TranslatePress Premium). To enable it, go to Settings → TranslatePress → Addons tab and click the Activate button next to it.\n\nNow, let’s step through the various ways you can translate URLs.\n\n1. Translating URL Slugs for Posts, Pages, Custom Post Types, and WooCommerce Products\n\nWith TranslatePress, you can translate URL slugs manually and automatically.\n\nManually Translating URL Slugs\n\nManual slug translation is a good option if you only have a few posts, pages, or products you want to translate or if you want to update an individual slug that hasn’t automatically translated correctly.\n\nNavigate to the post, page, or product you want to translate and hit “Translate Page” in the WordPress admin bar to load the TranslatePress visual interface.\n\nWith the SEO Pack activated on your site, the TranslatePress visual interface will display slug and SEO meta information in the menu drop-down. Choose the slug you want to translate and enter the translated slug at the bottom of the sidebar.\n\nThe next time you refresh the page in another language, the translated version of the URL slug will appear.\n\nThe process for manually translating URL posts and WooCommerce products is the same. Simply go to the page you want to translate on the front end, look for the “Translate Page” link in the WordPress admin bar, and follow the steps above.\n\nFor more on translating WooCommerce store content, check out our comprehensive guide to creating a multilingual WooCommerce store.\n\nAutomatically Translating URL Slugs\n\nThis option will generate automatic translations for all your post, page, product, and custom post type URL slugs. Navigate to Settings → TranslatePress and hit the Automatic Translation tab. Scroll down to Automatically translate slugs and check the box. Then hit Save Changes.\n\nNote: For this to work, you’ll need to have automatic translation enabled for your site. Go to Settings → TranslatePress and then click the Automatic Translation tab. From here, you can choose to enable TranslatePress AI, Google Translate v2 or DeepL translation.\n\nBoth Google Translate and DeepL APIs will require you to create an account and get a key. For more on how to do this, check out this article on how to automatically translate a WordPress site.\n\nFor premium TranslatePress users, the robust TranslatePress AI integrates seamlessly with the above translation services, helping you avoid all the manual work that goes into generating APIs, eventually saving you time and money. It also gives you the best accuracy possible because of its superpower to pick the best translation engine for each individual situation.\n\n2. Translating Custom URLs\n\nWith TranslatePress, you can automatically translate custom links throughout your site. This includes links that are added directly to the HTML (without using PHP functions to construct them) such as those added to blog post content.\n\nThe automatic translation of custom links is enabled by default in TranslatePress. To update this option, go to Settings → TranslatePress and hit the General tab. Scroll down to Force language in custom links and select Yes.\n\nTo manually translate a custom link, simply follow the steps outlined above for manually translating URL slugs.\n\n3. Translating External Links\n\nHave you ever browsed a site and clicked a link only to discover you’ve been taken to a page that’s in another language? It’s disorientating and breaks the user experience. With TranslatePress, you can avoid this scenario.\n\nWhile this option isn’t really about URL slugs, it’s worth mentioning in the context of translating URLs.\n\nTranslating web links that go to third-party sites ensures when visitors click a link, they’ll be taken to translated content that’s in the same language they are browsing in. This approach also ensures a consistent multilingual experience across your site.\n\nIn the TranslatePress visual interface, hover over the link you want to translate and click the pencil icon that appears. In the sidebar, you can enter a different translated link.\n\nIn the example above, the English version of the killer whales blog post includes a link to the English version of the killer whales Wikipedia page. For the Spanish version of the post, I’ve added a link to the Spanish version of the Wikipedia page. Basically, I’ve translated the href of the anchor to point to another URL.\n\n4. Translating URLs for media\n\nWith TranslatePress, you can also translate links to images, videos, documents, archive files, and other types of media. This type of translation is useful when you want to display different images and videos on your site for users in various languages, or provide language-specific downloads.\n\nAgain, this option isn’t specific to URL slugs but is useful to know in the context of translating URLs.\n\nFor example, say you want to display different feature images for a blog post about killer whales, depending on the visitor’s language. You might want to use a picture of a killer whale taken in the United States for English-speaking visitors and an image from Spain for Spanish speakers.\n\nTo achieve this, open the translation editor, hover over the image you want to translate, and click the pencil icon. In the sidebar, add an alternative image using the Add Media button. This lets you use the WordPress media library to select an existing image or upload a new file.\n\nTo translate a video, document, or other media, simply follow the same steps outlined above.\n\nEach of the URL translation options above ensures you can translate your entire site, including links, providing a consistent user experience for your visitors in a variety of languages.\n\nWith TranslatePress, you can easily and automatically translate your site in no time! Then all you need to do is check over your pages to make sure everything looks good and manually update any text that doesn’t sound right or simply needs a more human translation.\n\nWe also have a short video tutorial explaining this process so, if you’re more of a video learner, you can watch this:\n\nBest Practices for Translating URL Slugs in WordPress\n\nNow that you know how to translate URL slugs, let’s take a look at some best practice tips.\n\n1. Keep URLs Short\n\nThe shorter your URL slugs are, the easier they will be to read and the more memorable they’ll be for visitors. Also, short URL slugs are easier to translate.\n\nWhile there’s no recommended ideal length for URL slugs, Google likes short slugs that contain the keywords describing the post. You’ll also find that shorter URL slugs are more likely to appear in full in search results.\n\nYou don’t need to remove stop words such as “a”, “and”, “the” etc. which has been a recommended SEO practice in the past. Yoast SEO even used to have a clean slugs feature. As Online Media Masters points out, removing stop words can completely change the meaning of a slug. For example, /growing-up-with-hearing-loss/ is not the same thing as /growing-hearing-loss/. Only remove stop words if it doesn’t change the meaning of a slug.\n\n2. Always Include Important Keywords\n\nA solid multilingual SEO content strategy should always start with keyword research. This means identifying target keywords for each region and language you’re translating your content into.\n\nURL slugs should contain the most important keywords for your posts, pages, or products for each language on your site.\n\nFor more on how best to apply SEO to your translations, read our WordPress Multilingual SEO guide with tips to rank in all languages.\n\n3. Don’t Forget to Translate Other Important SEO Elements of Your Site\n\nAlong with translating URL slugs, add translating meta titles and descriptions to your to-do list.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the page title, URL, and description for your pages will show up in search results so it’s important to ensure all three are translated.\n\nFor example, if you translate one detail, such as the page title, and forget to translate the other two elements, you’ll have an inconsistent user experience. This tells users your translations might be inconsistent and they may think twice about clicking through to your site.\n\nIn WordPress, you can use a plugin like Yoast SEO to edit the meta titles and descriptions for your default language. Then you can use TranslatePress to provide translations.\n\nGet Started Translating URL Slugs with TranslatePress\n\nSlugs are the user-friendly part of a URL that describes what a post is about.
