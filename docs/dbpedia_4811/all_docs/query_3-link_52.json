        "text": "I have just come across an incredibly frustrating problem accessing my own website, from my own Mac! It’s completely defeated my attempts to resolve it. It is so weird I thought TibBITS readers might be interested—and suggest a solution!\n\nI run a website at tanamerah.com It’s a Wordpress site, independently hosted by SiteGround (who are superb, by the way). I have been accessing the site for editing or maintenance once or twice a week for the last three years, since I set it up.\n\nThis evening I tried to visit it as usual to update a plug-in—but couldn’t. The familiar web address just resulted in a blank page in Safari, followed eventually by a ‘server not responding’ error message. Here’s what I have tried to resolve the issue:\n\nEmptied Safari’s caches, and removed all cookies and website data for tanamerah.com.\n\nQuit and reopened Safari (version 13.1.2 (14609.3.5.1.5))\n\nUsed a different browser (Chrome)\n\nRebooted the Mac (which is running OS Mojave 10.14.6)\n\nSwitched to my clean ‘Test’ user account\n\nSwitched to a completely different WiFi network (my neighbour’s) connected to a different router\n\nAbsolutely nothing has worked. Needless to say, I have changed no settings on my Mac since I last accessed the site a few days ago. I haven’t, to my knowledge, installed any OS updates, nor browser updates. I haven’t touched my network settings for months.\n\nAnd the problem is limited to just this one site. I can open every other website I have tried. And the mystery is compounded by the fact that I can open the site on my wife’s and my other three MacBooks, and on our iPhones. And I contacted SiteGround: they checked the site too, and could find no problem with it.\n\nHaving tried every step I can think of I am completely stumped as to the cause. Clearly it has something to do with the unique combination of my Mac and my website. Something that has occurred in the last 24 hours without any action on my part. I half expect to wake up tomorrow morning to find everything working again—but somehow I can’t see that happening.\n\nSo if anyone has any bright ideas about what it might be, and what I could try to solve this puzzle, please let me know!\n\nThanks in anticipation,\n\nKevan\n\n@gdewaard I have no proxies set up. All the check-boxes under the proxies tab are unchecked. In the “Bypass proxy settings for these Hosts & Domains” box is “*.local, 169.254/16”, and “Use Passive FTP Mode” is checked. These setting are common to all my computers.\n\n@appleget I think @ddmiller is right. All my computers are using the same NAT router—and the other devices can all access the site; and I still cannot access the site with the problem computer using a different WiFi network and a different router.\n\n@ddmiller I do not have Little Snitch, and to my knowledge I have no firewalls in operation. I have a purely domestic set up: one router, two WiFi networks, four MacBooks, two iPads, two iPhones. And the thing is, no network settings were changed recently; and I do not have automatic updates enabled, so I know that neither the OS nor Safari have been updated recently. Otherwise the first thing I would have suspected would have been one of those—well, the OS I guess, since I can’t open the site using Chrome either, which suggests it’s not a Safari issue"
