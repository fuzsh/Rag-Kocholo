        "text": "Hi @Daniel Hoeving\n\nI don't think what you are trying to do is possible with DNS alone. I would actually setup a 301 redirect. You would need access to the load balancer or web server.\n\nIf you want a custom URL for your instance I believe you need one of the higher plans instead of the standard plan and you need to be in the early access program. I found this.\n\nWithout that, the only thing you can do is 301 redirect to kerkhoff.atlassian.net. That way anyone hitting the old link will be redirected to the new site.\n\nSo according to their support the Early Access Program is just that a Beta channel, and not recommended for production environments -- which this is.\n\nI set up a 301 redirect to point to the Atlassian site, but still running into the load balancer issue -- getting the \"Your Atlassian Cloud site is currently unavailable\" message, which kind of makes sense since the external 301 isn't much different than a cname record in this instance.\n\nIn your browser when you go to wiki.kerkhofftech.ca, you are seeing the url change to kerkhoff.atlassian.net, correct?\n\nSetting up a cname won't really work. Jira relies on the base url, in this case kerkhoff.atlassian.net. So yea you could technically get it to where you see a login page, but it's going to cause havoc with other stuff.\n\nUpdate*\n\nOut of curiosity, I entered wiki.kerkhofftech.ca in my browser and it did not redirect\n\nSo no I'm not seeing the URL change.\n\nI set up the 301 on our Sophos SG:\n\nI changed the DNS to newwiki.kerkhofftech.ca for the redirect so that our links to the old on premise Confluence wouldn't break before I got this working.\n\nI am guessing here, but the behavior so far points me to this. Do you have a redirect for https to the new site? If you enter newwiki.kerkhofftech.ca into a browser it does redirect, but just to https://newwiki.kerkhofftech.ca. Then it just stops. See if you can redirect by setting the source to specifically https://newwiki.kerkhofftech.ca to redirect to https://kerkhofftech.atlassian.net"
