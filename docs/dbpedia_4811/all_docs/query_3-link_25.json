My host is on Siteground and I wolud like to create the cronjob from cPanel.\n\nBefore adding the command in cPanel, I've logged in via ssh. By following a previous thread, I've figured out to write this line:\n\n/usr/local/bin/php public_html/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/CRM/Admin/Page/Job.php\n\nBut it throughts this Fatal error:\n\nFatal error: Class 'CRM_Core_Page_Basic' not found in /home/amicsdel/public_html/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/CRM/Admin/Page/Job.php on line 37\n\nAny idea about how to solve it? Where this class is suposed to be declared?\n\nThanks!"
