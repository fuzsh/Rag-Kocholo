        "text": "When you transfer your domain to Wix, Wix becomes your domain host. This means your domain's contact information, DNS settings, and registration payments are all managed from within your Wix account.\n\nIn this article, learn about:\n\nBefore you begin:\n\nTo transfer your domain to Wix, you must get an authorization code (also known as the EPP code) from your current registrar. The code is usually sent to your domain's registered email upon request. If needed, contact your current domain registrar for assistance.\n\nYour domain must be unlocked before you begin the transfer. In most cases, you can contact your current registrar to unlock the domain. In some cases, your domain might be locked due to ICANN's 60 day lock policy.\n\nTransferring your domain to Wix\n\nTransfer your domain so that Wix becomes your domain host. Once the transfer is complete, all your domain settings and billing can be managed at Wix.\n\nNote:\n\nThe transfer process can take up to 7 days to complete. If you need your domain linked to your site in a shorter timeframe, connect your domain to Wix first. Learn more about the difference between transferring and connecting a domain.\n\nTo transfer your domain to Wix:\n\nGo to Domains in your Wix account.\n\nClick Add an Existing Domain and select Transfer your domain to Wix.\n\nRead the information on your screen and click Start Transfer.\n\nEnter the domain you want to transfer (e.g., mystunningwebsite.com).\n\nSelect where the domain was purchased from the drop-down.\n\nClick Continue.\n\nLog in to your account with the current domain host:\n\n(In a different browser tab) Log in to the account where your domain was purchased.\n\n(In your Wix account) Select the I logged in checkbox.\n\nMake sure your domain is ready to transfer:\n\n(In a different browser tab) Unlock your domain from your current domain host.\n\n(In your Wix account) Select the I unlocked it checkbox.\n\nGet an authorization code from your account with the current domain host.\n\nPaste the code under Enter authorization code.\n\nClick Continue.\n\nSelect an extension period of at least one year.\n\nTip: If you have a free domain voucher, it's automatically applied.\n\nClick Continue.\n\nCheck and/or edit your contact information. Then, click Continue.\n\nSelect a privacy option:\n\nPrivate Registration: Your contact details won't appear in the WHOIS domain information records. You can turn the privacy protection option on and off whenever you want.\n\nPublic Registration: Your name and address always remain public in the WHOIS domain information records. You can only change it to private when manually extending the domain subscription.\n\nClick Continue.\n\nSelect your payment method and click Submit Purchase.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nOnce you've submitted the purchase, an email is sent from wix-team@registrar.wix.com to your domain's registrant, confirming the transfer has been initiated. It may take up to 7 days for your domain transfer to complete.\n\nFAQs\n\nWe are here to help with all your questions. Click a question below to learn more.\n\nMy domain can't be transferred to Wix. Can I connect the domain to Wix instead?\n\nYes. Even if your domain can't be transferred to Wix, you can still connect your domain to your Wix site.\n\nWhat domain extensions can be transferred to Wix?\n\nCurrently, you can only transfer domains with the following extensions:\n\n.com, .org, .net, .agency, .art, .biz, .blog, .ca, .center, .christmas, .cloud, .club, .co, .coach, .company, .club, .design, .digital, .directory, .email, .expert, .finance, .fit, .fitness, .fun, .gifts, .group, .guru, .holiday, .info, .land,, .life, .live, .london, .love, .me, .media, .mx, .ninja, .online, .party, .photography, .photos, .pictures, .rocks, .site, .shop, .solutions, .space, .store, .studio, .tokyo, .today, .top, .technology, .tips, .training, .website, .wiki .work, .world, .xyz and .yoga\n\nHow long will the transfer take to complete?\n\nFinalizing your domain transfer to Wix may take up to 7 days. We will send an email to confirm that we've received your request to transfer your domain.\n\nNo further action is required to complete this process. The transfer will be processed within 7 days, as long as you have entered the correct authorization code, and your current domain registrar has approved your transfer.\n\nI've recently changed my registrant information. Can I still transfer my domain?\n\nIf you have recently changed your registrant information, your domain is locked from transfer for 60 days. While you can't transfer your domain during this period, you can still connect the domain to your site in the meantime. Learn more about ICANN's 60 Day Lock Policy.\n\nCan I transfer a 'premium' domain name to Wix?\n\nNo, you cannot transfer 'premium' domains to your Wix account. Also, Wix does not sell premium domains. However, if you own a premium domain, you can connect the domain to your site.\n\nNote: A 'premium' domain is a domain name that other registrars deemed as high-value. These domains are often bought (and resold) by investors for a profit. The specific domain names are decided by each registrar, at their own discretion.\n\nCan I transfer a domain registered with Network Solutions to Wix?\n\nNo. Unfortunately, domains registered with Network Solutions can't be transferred to Wix. However, you can still connect the domain to your Wix site.\n\nCan I transfer a domain registered with Register.com to Wix?\n\nNo. Unfortunately, domains registered with Register.com can't be transferred to Wix. However, you can still connect the domain to your Wix site.\n\nIf I transfer my domain to Wix, what happens to the domain registration period?\n\nDomains transferred to Wix retain the time of their registration period; any remaining time is added to the one-year mandatory extension.\n\nIf I transfer my domain to Wix, what happens to the domain privacy setting?\n\nYour transferred domain does not inherit the privacy setting from your old registrar. Your previous privacy setting applies until the end of your old subscription and then changes to the setting that you select in Wix (step 14). It is an industry standard that you cannot change this setting.\n\nI've successfully transferred my domain to Wix, but my old site still appears. What's happening?\n\nIf your domain has successfully transferred to Wix, but your old site still appears, this usually resolves itself after a few days depending on your router or browser settings. To fix immediately, clear your browser's cache and then flush the DNS.\n\nCan I cancel the transfer of my domain from another registrar to Wix?\n\nOnce you begin the process of transferring your domain from another registrar to Wix, it is not possible for Wix to intervene and cancel the transfer request. Please contact your current registrar if you need to cancel your domain transfer to Wix.\n\nWhen the domain transfer appears as 'failed' in your Wix account, you will automatically be refunded for all transfer payments. Please allow up to 20 days for this refund to appear in your bank statement."
