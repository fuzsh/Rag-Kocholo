You shouldn’t need to use another system to minify them again.\n\nBy “minified” I mean that we run post processing to convert our human readable source files into much smaller files. Variable and function names are shortened, whitespace is removed, and other techniques are applied to produce valid javascript that takes up the least amount of space possible.\n\nWhen it comes to optimization systems, the burden of responsibility lies primarily with that system. Our files are valid javascript, and should be a valid input, but there is a possibility of failure if the system doesn’t properly parse and handle those files.\n\nWhat happens periodically, is that optimization systems like SiteGround’s minifier will not properly parse code that is already minified, resulting in broken output. There is nothing we can do about this on our end.\n\nA good analogy would be imagining a set of physical parts that need to be shipped in a box. We take care to use space efficiently and package our parts neatly in the smallest box possible. SiteGrounds optimizer unpackages everything and sorts the parts again, then tries to repackage them in a new box. We don’t have control over that process, and there isn’t a way to ensure they don’t break things during that repackaging stage.\n\nOur recommendation is to disable the minifier entirely. Unfortunately if you want to use it, there is the possibility of it failing.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nThis topic was automatically closed 10 days after the last reply.
