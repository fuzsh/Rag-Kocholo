(will be run under https://hosting.io brand - website in process of rebuild) and will be primarily for WP hosting\n\nthanks\n\nJody\n\nI’d suggest making your first post a little bit better to understand… Because I’ve got no clue what so ever on what you want…\n\nat the moment, we have a set of 5 domains that have been approved for SSL, i want to be able to offer LetsEncrypt SSL to our clients in an automated manner, the same way that pressjitsu and siteground do\n\nWhat’s stopping you doing that now? There is nothing that needs to be “enabled” for different domains. or are all your sites subdomains of your domain or something ?\n\nwhen we signed up,. we were asked for specific domains to add, so assume thats all we are allowed\n\nwill try it out and see"
