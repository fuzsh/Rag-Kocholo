        "text": "Migrants may experience discrimination for several different reasons, some of which also affect minority groups born in the UK\n\nDiscrimination can have a significant impact on people’s lives, and it is often found in the housing market (when buying or renting a house) or the labour market (hiring and promotion practices). However, it can occur in any domain. Experiences and perceptions of discrimination can affect people’s chances in life, their sense of belonging and well-being, or their mental health.\n\nDiscrimination against migrants in the UK can occur for multiple reasons. Some of these, like ethnicity, skin colour, or religion, are shared with ethnic minorities born in the UK. Other reasons, such as having foreign qualifications or accents, are more likely to affect the foreign-born. Disentangling the precise reasons behind discriminatory behaviours is difficult since multiple factors might be at play at the same time. For example, a worker born in Somalia might be discriminated against on account of their ethnicity, race, religion, accent, or foreign credentials.\n\nMigrants are a diverse group in the UK. This is true of their national and ethnic origins, as well as their economic and educational backgrounds. These differences affect experiences and perceptions of discrimination. People who are more different from the local majority, culturally and ethnically, are more likely to experience discrimination. Likewise, migrants born in less developed countries are perceived more negatively than those from rich countries, regardless of personal characteristics.\n\nThe links between public attitudes, group stereotypes, and discrimination are complex. Negative attitudes and stereotypes don’t always translate into discriminatory behaviour, although they facilitate it. For example, minority groups who are viewed more negatively by the public also tend to experience the most discrimination (for more information about attitudes towards migration in the UK, see the Migration Observatory’s briefing, UK Public Opinion toward Immigration).\n\nReturn to top\n\nPeople in the UK are more tolerant of migrants than those in other countries, expressing less reluctance to have them as neighbours in 2022\n\nIn general, people living in the UK are relatively tolerant towards immigrants. In 2022, only 5% of the British public said they would not like to have immigrants as neighbours (Figure 1). This is a common indicator of prejudice in research, which captures underlying attitudes towards migrants as well as social norms that make it unacceptable to express hostility. The share of people expressing prejudice towards migrants in Britain was one of the lowest in the world and notably smaller than in other democracies like Japan (30%), Greece (26%), Italy (18%), and even France (10%).\n\nFigure 1\n\nA similar conclusion emerges with regard to racial prejudice – in 2022, only 2% of the British public said they would not like to have people of a different race as neighbours, significantly lower than in most other countries (Figure 1).\n\nWhile Britain is relatively tolerant towards migrants and ethnic minorities, there is nonetheless significant evidence that some of them perceive and experience discrimination in their daily lives, as detailed in the sections below.\n\nReturn to top\n\nAround 16% of migrants in Britain described themselves as members of a group that faced discrimination in 2018-20\n\nIn 2018-20, around 16% of the foreign-born population in Britain described themselves as members of a group that was discriminated against for reasons of race, nationality, religion, language, or ethnicity.\n\nBefore 2014-16, the level of perceived discrimination was notably lower among EU-born migrants (Figure 2). However, people born in the EU experienced a large increase in perceived discrimination in the period leading up to the 2016 Brexit referendum, reaching levels comparable to those seen among non-EU migrants. In 2018-2020, the share of EU-born migrants perceiving discrimination against people like them declined but remained above pre-referendum levels.\n\nFigure 2\n\nPeople born in the UK to migrant parents were much more likely to see themselves as belonging to a discriminated group than the foreign-born, at 35% (Figure 2). Among this group, levels of perceived discrimination declined in the 2000s before notably increasing in the 2010s. A similar trend can be observed among those with mixed heritage who had a single parent born abroad.\n\nAdult children of migrants consistently report higher levels of discrimination in surveys than the foreign-born, and this is not unique to the UK. Perceptions of discrimination tend to increase with length of stay, a phenomenon that scholars refer to as the ‘integration paradox’. There are several reasons that could explain this pattern. First, adult children of migrants, almost all of whom are British citizens and grew up in the UK, have higher expectations of equal treatment and are more aware of their rights than their parents; as a result, they are less likely to tolerate being discriminated against. Second, UK-born ethnic minorities may be both more exposed to discrimination and more aware that they are being discriminated against than the foreign-born, as they are native English speakers, consume English media, and have extensive contact with the White British population. Third, adult children of migrants may also be more aware of existing ethnic inequalities and more likely to attribute them to discrimination. Research has indeed shown that UK-born ethnic minorities earn less and are more likely to be unemployed than white Britons. At least part of this gap is caused by discrimination. Finally, it is also possible that migrants, especially those with lower levels of education, are more reluctant to disclose their experiences of discrimination in surveys compared to higher-educated migrants and ethnic minorities born in the country.\n\nData from the UK’s household survey, which allows for more detailed breakdowns by origin and ethnicity, confirms these patterns. Compared to the foreign-born, UK-born ethnic minorities were roughly twice as likely to describe themselves as members of a group that faced discrimination in 2020 (40% vs. 19%, see Figure 2). This is also true if we only include discrimination based on colour, race, nationality, language, or religion (27% vs. 13%).\n\nMigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa were more likely to perceive discrimination than people born in other regions of the world, mostly on account of colour or race (Figure 3). Individuals born in the EU were more likely to feel their group was discriminated against because of their nationality or language.\n\nPerceptions of discrimination also varied among ethnic minority groups born in the UK. The highest reported levels of overall discrimination were among UK-born individuals who identify as Black, at 59%. Around a third of this group perceived discrimination on account of colour or race. In contrast, people of South Asian heritage born in the UK, many of whom are Muslims, were more likely to feel discriminated against on account of religion.\n\nFigure 3\n\nPerceptions cannot fully capture actual experiences or incidents of discrimination. However, perceptions of unfair treatment at the group level are important for social cohesion, as well as individual well-being and health. Such perceptions among migrants can indicate how accepted they feel by the local population, making it relevant to their integration.\n\nAttitudes towards certain groups can be shaped by political elites, at least for short periods. An example is the period surrounding the Brexit referendum when perceptions of hostility and discrimination among EU-born migrants increased.\n\nReturn to top\n\nMigrants in Britain were slightly less likely to perceive discrimination against their group than those in some other European states in 2018-20\n\nIn 2018-20, 16% of migrants in Great Britain said they belonged to a group that was discriminated against in society. This share was lower than in other Western European countries like France (24%), Germany (22%), or the Netherlands (21%). However, levels of perceived discrimination were lower still in Switzerland (8%) and Ireland (9%).\n\nNon-EU migrants tend to report more discrimination against their group than those born in the EU, in the UK and in other Western European countries alike. However, migrants born outside the EU were notably less likely to perceive discrimination in Britain than in European countries like Germany, France, or Austria (Figure 4). These differences persist even when accounting for the different national origins of the non-EU-born population in each country.\n\nEU-born migrants were less likely to report discrimination than non-EU ones in most countries. However, differences between countries were much smaller among this group. Levels of perceived discrimination in Great Britain were similar to those seen in EU14 countries.\n\nFigure 4\n\nAmong those born locally to migrant parents, levels of perceived discrimination were significantly higher in Great Britain (35%) than in many other European states, including France (26%) and Germany (27%). People with just one migrant parent were also more likely to perceive discrimination in Britain (19%) than in EU-14 countries (7%).\n\nThe reasons for this pattern are unclear and might include differences in levels of discrimination, socio-economic outcomes, expectations of equal treatment, family narratives about past experiences of discrimination, or social awareness. Nonetheless, Britain stands out as a country where large numbers of people born in the country to migrant parents perceive discrimination against their group.\n\nReturn to top\n\nMinorities of migrants in the UK say they felt unsafe (19%), were insulted (15%), or avoided places (10%) because of their background\n\nMost migrants in the UK are not regularly harassed in their daily lives. However, some report having negative experiences because of their background, such as feeling unsafe, being insulted, or avoiding specific places. In 2020, 19% of individuals born abroad said they had felt unsafe because of their ethnicity, nationality, religion, language, or accent. For the same reasons, around 15% of all migrants had been insulted, and 10% had avoided certain places (Figure 5). Outright physical violence, though, was rare – only 1% of migrants reported being the victim of an attack.\n\nFigure 5\n\nReturn to top\n\nResearch shows that ethnic minorities experience discrimination in the labour market regardless of their country of birth, nationality, or qualifications\n\nWhile surveys can capture people’s perceptions and experiences of harassment and discrimination, they cannot provide objective measures of direct discrimination in key areas, such as the labour or housing markets. For this, researchers generally employ field experiments or audit studies. A common approach of these studies is to submit multiple applications on behalf of fictitious candidates, such as for a job, and examine the outcomes. The applications are identical except for certain characteristics of interest, such as country of birth or ethnicity, which are usually signalled through names.\n\nFor example, a study conducted in the UK in 2017 found that applicants were much less likely to receive a positive response from employers if they had Pakistani or Nigerian names (Figure 6). Applicants with names from EEA countries were only slightly discriminated against compared to job candidates with White British names. Notably, these differences occurred even though all applicants were British nationals and had UK qualifications.\n\nFigure 6\n\nA field experiment in the London market for shared housing conducted between 2011 and 2012 found ethnic discrimination against minority applicants. The probability of being invited for a room viewing was 13 percentage points lower for applicants with non-British names than for those with British names and 20 percentage points lower for those with Muslim names.\n\nOverall, research indicates that the main driver of discrimination is ethnicity rather than being a migrant – similar experiments in Europe revealed that applicants were discriminated against on account of ethnicity regardless of where they were born. Across countries, individuals with Middle Eastern or African origins were most likely to suffer discrimination from employers.\n\nReligion can also drive labour market discrimination, particularly against Muslims. Muslim minorities suffer from widespread hostility in Western countries, including from liberals who support immigration but see religiosity as a threat to European secularism.\n\nEvidence gaps and limitations\n\nThis briefing presents survey estimates of perceived discrimination or harassment due to race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, language or country of birth based on survey data (UKHLS and ESS). Because these data are based on people’s perceptions, the real levels of discrimination and harassment may be higher or lower than the estimates presented in the briefing. Individuals’ perceptions are based on their actual experiences with discrimination and/or their sensitivity to the issue of discrimination. Unfortunately, the data do not allow us to unpick the effect that each of the two factors (experiences and sensitivity) have on the perceptions of each respondent.\n\nBy contrast, labour market field experiments such as the study conducted by Lancee (2019) are the gold standard to measure discrimination. Despite its advantages, however, the actual level of discrimination in the labour market might be higher or lower than the level of discrimination estimated by a field experiment simply because experiments tend to focus only on certain occupations (usually fewer than ten), and they do not necessarily mirror the actual sociodemographic composition of ethnic minorities. For example, if there are only 10% of graduates among workers of a certain ethnic minority but 50% of applicants of that ethnicity in the experiment apply to high-skilled positions, the average level of discrimination measured in the experiment will not precisely match the actual level of discrimination faced by this ethnic group. In addition, most field experiments do not tell us anything about any discrimination that may take place either at the interview stage or after a person has been hired.\n\nReferences"
