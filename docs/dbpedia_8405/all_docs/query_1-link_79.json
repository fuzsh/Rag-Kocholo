        "text": "Commercial Determinants of Noncommunicable Diseases in the WHO European Region\n\nThis report highlights the substantial impact of commercial determinants on noncommunicable diseases (‎NCDs)‎ in the WHO European Region. Nearly 7500 deaths per day in the Region are attributed to commercial determinants, such as tobacco, alcohol,processed food, fossil fuels and occupational practices. These commercial products and practices contribute to 25% of all deaths in the Region. The report’s chapters systematically explore various facets of how commercial interests exacerbate NCDs and key strategies used by commercial actors to negatively influence NCD-related policies at the national and international level. The reportalso provides selected case studies from the Region to illustrate key strategies and outcomes of industry influence on health policies.The report then calls for urgent and coordinated action to address the commercial determinants of NCDs. It advocates for building coalitions based on the values of equity, sustainability, and resilience. Public health actors are urged to develop competencies in economic and legal frameworks, enforce transparency, and manage conflicts of interest effectively. The report underscores the need for robust financial reforms and strict regulation to curb industry power and protect public health. By implementing these strategies, the Region can accelerate progress towards global NCD targets and Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.\n\nCategories:Evidence of Marketing Guidelines/PolicyYear(s):2024 (ongoing)Target age group:Adults and childrenOrganisation:World Health Organisation (WHO)Linked document:Download linked documentReferences:World Health Organization.
