        "text": "In April 2021, Tepetlaoxtoc, a town on the outskirts of Mexico City, proclaimed itself a “pueblo originario”: an originary people/town. It petitioned to be recognized as such by Mexico’s National Institute for Indigenous Peoples. “We want to return to ancient ways of government, to protect ourselves from urban encroachment and from mining corporations,” explained one of the townsfolk (Salinas Césareo Reference Salinas Césareo2021, 43). By doing this, Tepetlaoxtoc, like many IndigenousFootnote 1 communities across the hemisphere, was organizing to confront the threats of violence caused by resource extraction, the shadow of territorial dispossession, and socioeconomic inequality. Indeed, over the last half-century, these communities have been ramping up their legal and political mobilization. Indigenous activists across the globe are increasingly connecting with one another and using international law to push legislation in national courts. And they are bringing ever more litigation aimed at creating new practices of self-determination within and across traditional state boundaries (Bernal Reference Bernal2011; Lightfoot Reference Lightfoot2016; Riofrancos Reference Riofrancos2020).\n\nIn these struggles, the territorial state occupies an ambiguous position. On the one hand, it protects Indigenous peoples’ rights through law. On the other, it makes them vulnerable by sponsoring commercial corporations, encouraging urban development, and fostering large-scale development projects that threaten their territories and ways of life. This ambiguity reveals that current legal systems and normative theories still lack the resources to accommodate both these peoples’ collective rights and the rights of private individuals.\n\nHow then should we address these struggles over control of territory and natural resources? In international border conflicts, neighboring states dispute which of them has rights to jurisdiction in a given area. But in territorial and natural-resource conflicts involving Indigenous peoples, the disputes often concern not which state has jurisdictional rights, but what kind of agent has those rights. Are water, gas, or oil the private property of those who own the land where they are found? Or are these collective resources? Do states have the ultimate right to decide how they are used? Or do Indigenous communities also have such rights when resources are taken from the lands on which they live? To answer these questions, we must examine who is and should be the subject of territorial rights.\n\nIn recent years, scholars have addressed this question through new theories of territorial rights (Kolers Reference Kolers2009; Miller Reference Miller2012; Moore Reference Moore2015; Simmons Reference Simmons2016; Stilz Reference Stilz2019) and of natural resources (Armstrong Reference Armstrong2017) that explain how people, institutions, and particular places relate to each other. The relations they specify justify which subject has control over land, resources, and borders (Moore Reference Moore2015, 8). Conversely, they also explain why some ways of occupying land are usurpations. All these theories ground their accounts of these relations in one of three ideas: that the foundational subject of territorial rights is the state, or the whole people/nation in the state, or the individuals whose rights are prior to the state or the people. Hence these theories still struggle to accommodate the collective rights of Indigenous peoples, because their claims are not based in individual rights, nor do they demand statehood, and still less do they claim to be the whole people in a state.\n\nHowever, Indigenous ideas and institutions themselves may offer a solution. Examining these ideas and institutions reveals that there are other possible subjects of territorial rights: we are not limited to individuals, statewide peoples, or states. To explore this further, I turn to the history of New Spain—the colonial jurisdiction roughly corresponding to present-day Mexico and the southwestern United States—which has a history of Indigenous struggles over land that offers an alternative. In New Spain, the main subject of territorial rights was neither the individual, the state, nor the state’s organized people but rather pueblos: grounded communities. Pueblos are communities attached to the land, usually as a town or village (“Pueblo” can be translated from the Spanish as both “people” and “town”). In New Spain and Mexico, they were and are commonly treated as the ground of territory. Moreover, many were and are constituted of Indigenous people who used the pueblo as their main form of political organization within the colonial order and its successor republics. These communities were known as pueblos de indios (henceforth, “pueblos” will mean pueblos de indios, which refers both to the town and the people, unless the context shows otherwise). In Mexico, pueblos descended from a form of civic organization used by the Nahuas in pre-Hispanic times: the altepetl, a polity essentially related to land and water that claimed something akin to territorial jurisdiction.\n\nAll this is well known to historians of New Spain and Mexico, who have analyzed pueblos as subjects of territorial rights. Indeed, there is a large body of historical evidence of the political struggles of Indigenous peoples found in legal records, as well as interpretations of seventeenth-century legal thinkers. But this material is not well known to normative theorists of territory. Exploring pueblos from this perspective can thus enrich current debates on territorial rights. Pueblos offer an alternative to dominant models of territory because they offer not only a different subject of territorial rights but also a different focus than those theories, which focus on the legal rights to own the land held by one of their three accepted subjects. By contrast, pueblos—as communities attached to a particular place and landscape—have since the sixteenth century been place-based groups that constitute a unified subject of land rights, similar to an individual who owns private property. Unlike an individual, however, pueblos do not have property over land. Instead, they have legal jurisdiction over the territory, just like a state. These traits have historically allowed pueblos to assert themselves both against the state and against the encroachment of private property holders from the outside (Kourí Reference Kourí, Caballero and Acevedo-Rodrigo2018).\n\nPueblos thus afford both a theoretical and an historical perspective that offers alternatives to contemporary territorial rights theories. Theoretically, they offer a genuinely different subject of territorial rights than individuals, states, or statewide peoples. For while individuals and states/civic peoples are defined independently of territory and then connected to it through rights, pueblos are not independent from the land nor from the environmental relations they create. And whereas ethnic groups or nations (which are also defined in connection to the homeland) are defined by identity, pueblos are instead defined spatially. The reason is that pueblos arise from political contestation and are justified by the value of place-based mutual obligations.\n\nHistorically, pueblos offer a live alternative to ethnic, individualist, or state-based theories. They were the center of social life in colonial New Spain, and they continue to be at the center of politics in independent Mexico. They and their claims to land and independence are the main character of a historical mythology, which runs parallel to that of the national state. Pueblos have foundational stories, heroes, and documents that have been central to the political and social imaginary of Mexico since its independence in the nineteenth century (Ochoa Espejo Reference Ochoa Espejo2012) and remain so to this day.\n\nI therefore argue that contemporary theories should add pueblos to their catalog of subjects of territorial rights. Including pueblos in ongoing discussions about territorial rights would allow us to compare and refine mainstream theories; yet pueblos have wider implications for political theory and political science more generally. Their history reveals how hegemonic lenses in philosophy and law have marginalized Indigenous thought and experience. Moreover, investigating Spanish colonial history is not just an exercise meant to find “familiar themes in unfamiliar works,” as Joshua Simon (Reference Simon2014, 809) put it; it can also unearth viable alternatives within what it reveals as a shared past. The arc of Spanish American colonial history shows that Indigenous ideas and institutions do not reside in an alien space or in a forgotten past: in fact, they are live alternatives in a history that European settlers share with Indigenous peoples. These alternatives seem marginal, forgotten, or destined to disappear only when seen from Euro-centered political theory’s conventional “narrative of unilinear historical development” (Westler Reference Westler2015, 394), which has framed the Spanish Empire and the experiences of its Indigenous inhabitants as outliers of modernity (Caraccioli Reference Caraccioli2021, 5). In doing so, it erases an important part of our common intellectual history from the study of political thought. But we need not see things this way. We can instead treat Indigenous and non-Anglophone ideas and institutions as real alternatives in a shared but diverse past.\n\nThe erasure, moreover, is arguably more than just an oversight. When it comes to Indigenous history in both English and Spanish America, it is a strategy to avoid facing injustice (Bruyneel Reference Bruyneel2021; Ferguson Reference Ferguson2016). Just as often happens when presenting legal arguments, those in theoretical discussions who decide what counts as evidence and who set the terms of the debate are also those who (directly or indirectly) control the resources. Changing those terms often requires struggle, as the history of pueblos abundantly illustrates.\n\nUsing evidence from the literature on law and litigation in early colonial Spanish America (particularly from New Spain), this article sketches the historical trajectory of pueblos as holders of territory. I draw on historical accounts based on legal records and petitions, particularly the sixteenth-century Memorial de los indios de Tepetlaóztoc (Valle Reference Valle1994), and on legal commentary: Juan de Solórzano Pereira’s seventeenth-century compendium of Spanish colonial law, Política Indiana (reprinted in 1972). I use these historical and legal sources to describe a process by which political relations became attached to places rather than to ethnic groups. Pueblos had rights to territory, and the rationale offered in these legal discussions was that places were foundational for the grounded community’s common good and collective freedom. On this view, liberty was not the right of each individual in the abstract but rather a web of mutual obligations mediated by place and relations to land and water. Pueblos, then, provide an alternative approach to perennial problems in territorial rights theories that often cannot accommodate the territorial rights of Indigenous groups, which are neither grounded on individual rights, national or statewide civic peoples, nor on statehood.\n\nThe first section describes how Indigenous peoples’ struggles for land reveal internal problems in contemporary theories of territorial rights and then explains how studying pueblos complements recent attempts to solve these problems. Section two examines the development of pueblos as a legal institution, and section three gives an account of the legal doctrines they used to defend their territorial rights. The last section specifies how place and collective liberty gave legal and political foundations to pueblos’ territories."
