In 2024 the population peaked, there are 48,797,875[3] people living in Spain. Its population density, at 96 inhabitants per square kilometre (250/sq mi), is lower than other Western European countries, yet, with the exception of microstates, it has the highest real density population in Europe, based on density of inhabited areas.[4] With the exception of the capital Madrid, the most densely populated areas lie around the coast.\n\nThe population of Spain doubled during the twentieth century, but the pattern of growth was extremely uneven due to large-scale internal migration from the rural interior to the industrial cities. Eleven of Spain's fifty provinces saw an absolute decline in population over the century.\n\nIn 2022, the average total fertility rate (TFR) across Spain was 1.16 children born per woman.[5]\n\nSpain accepted 478,990 new immigrant residents in the first six months of 2022 alone. During these first six months, 220,443 people also emigrated from Spain, leaving a record-breaking net migration figure of 258,547.[6] The data shows that more women than men chose to move to Spain during 2022, this is due to higher rates of emigration from Latin America.[6]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nNotable events in modern Spanish demography:\n\n1808–1814. Peninsular War and Spanish War of Independence: 0.24–0.4–1.0 million deaths.\n\nLate 19th century and early 20th century: Relative economic stagnation and mass emigration to American countries.\n\n1918. Flu pandemic, over 200,000 dead in Spain.\n\n1936. Start of the Spanish Civil War.\n\n1939. End of the Civil War. Establishment of a dictatorship, start of rationing policies. Deepening of economic depression, mass emigration to European and American countries due to economic and political motives (Republican exile).\n\n1941. Approval of benefits for large families with at least four children.[7]\n\n1945. Establishment of tax deductions for parents.[8]\n\n1952. End of rationing policies.\n\n1975. End of the dictatorship, mass return of emigrated people.\n\n1977. Legalization of contraception. Decline of birth rates.\n\n1985. Legalization of abortion.\n\n1988. After centuries of net negative migration, the first events of illegal immigration from Africa occur.[9]\n\n1991. Spain becomes a net receiver of migrants after decades of mass emigration.[10]\n\n1994. Lowering of threshold of requirements to become a large family: only three children needed.[7]\n\n2007. Approval of €2,500 benefit for births.\n\n2010. Legalization of elective abortion.\n\n2011. Withdrawal of the €2,500 benefit for births.\n\n2015. First negative natural change since the Civil War due to the aging of Spanish population.\n\nThe population of Spain doubled during the twentieth century as a result of the demographic boom in the 1960s and early 1970s. After that time, the birth rate fell during the 1980s and Spain's population growth stalled.\n\nMany demographers have linked Spain's very low fertility rate to the country's lack of a family support policy. Spain spends the least on family support out of all western European countries—0.5% of GDP. A graphic illustration of the enormous social gulf in this field is the fact[citation needed] that a Spanish family would need to have 57 children to enjoy the same financial support as a family with 3 children in Luxembourg[citation needed].[citation needed]\n\nDuring the early 2000s, the mean year-on-year demographic growth set a new record with its 2003 peak variation of 2.1%, doubling the previous record reached back in the 1960s when a mean year-on-year growth of 1% was experienced.[11] In 2005 alone, the immigrant population of Spain increased by 700,000 people.[12]\n\nThe arrival of migrating young adults was the main reason for the slight increase in Spain's fertility rate.[13] From 2002 through 2008 the Spanish population grew by 8%, of whom 7% were foreign.[14]\n\nPopulation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the World Population Review in 2019.[15]\n\nOne birth every minute\n\nOne death every minute\n\nNet gain of one person every 131 minutes\n\nOne net migrant every 13 minutes\n\nNote: Crude migration change (per 1,000) is a trend analysis, an extrapolation based on average population change (current year minus previous) minus natural change of the current year (see table vital statistics).

groups\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Spanish Constitution of 1978, in its second article, generically recognises contemporary entities—nationalities and regions—[b] within the context of the Spanish nation.\n\nSpain has been described as a de facto plurinational state.[30][31] The identity of Spain rather accrues of an overlap of different territorial and ethnolinguistic identities than of a sole Spanish identity. In some cases some of the territorial identities may conflict with the dominant Spanish culture. Distinct traditional identities within Spain include the Basques, Catalans, Galicians, Andalusians and Valencians,[failed verification][32] although to some extent all of the 17 autonomous communities may claim a distinct local identity. Definition of ethnicity or nationality in Spain is fraught politically. The term \"Spanish people\" (pueblo español) is defined in the 1978 constitution as the political sovereign, i.e. the citizens of the Kingdom of Spain. The same constitution in its preamble speaks of \"peoples and nationalities of Spain\" (pueblos y nacionalidades de España) and their respective cultures, traditions, languages and institutions. The formerly nomadic Gitanos and Mercheros are distinctly marked by endogamy and discrimination but they are dispersed through the country.[citation needed]\n\nThe native Canarians are partly the descendants of the North African population of the Canary Islands prior to Spanish colonization in the 15th century although many Spaniards have varying levels of North African admixture as a result of the Islamic period. Also included are many Spanish citizens who are descendants of people from Spain's former colonies, mostly from Venezuela, Argentina, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Peru, Colombia, Morocco and Cuba. There is also a sizable number of Spaniards of Eastern European, Maghrebian, Sub Saharan-African, Indian subcontinent and Middle Eastern descent.[33]\n\nThe arrival of the gitanos (Spanish for \"gypsies\"), a Romani people, began in the 16th century; estimates of the Spanish Roma population range from 750,000 to over one million.[34][35][36][37][38] There are also the mercheros (also called quinquis), a formerly nomadic minority group. Their origin is unclear.\n\nHistorically, Sephardic Jews and Moriscos are the main minority groups originating in Spain and with a contribution to Spanish culture.[39] The Spanish government formerly offered Spanish citizenship to Sephardic Jews.[40]\n\nImmigration\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Immigration to Spain\n\nIn terms of emigration vs. immigration, after decades of net emigration after the Spanish Civil War, Spain has experienced massive large-scale immigration for the first time in modern history over the past 30 years. As of 2024, there were 8,915,831 foreign-born people in Spain, making up to 18.31% of the Spanish population[41] Of these, 6,581,028 (13.51%) didn't have Spanish citizenship.[42][43] This makes Spain one of the world's preferred destinations to immigrate to, being the 4th country in Europe by immigration numbers and the 10th worldwide. Of these, more than 860,000 were Romanian, and 760,000 were Moroccan while the number of Ecuadorians was around 390,000. Colombian population amounted to around 300,000. There are also a significant number of British (359,076 as of 2011, but more than one million are estimated to live permanently in Spain) and German (195,842) citizens, mainly in Alicante, Málaga provinces, Balearic Islands and Canary Islands. The largest Asian immigrant group, the Chinese, number slightly over 166,000. Immigrants from several sub-Saharan African countries have also settled in Spain as contract workers, representing 4.08% of all the foreign residents in the country.\n\nSpain migration data, 2008-present\n\n[edit]\n\nPeriod Immigration Emigration Net Migration 2008S1 329,772 134,650 195,121 2008S2 269,302 153,782 115,520 2009S1 205,091 184,140 20,951 2009S2 187,872 195,978 -8,106 2010S1 173,714 197,032 -23,318 2010S2 186,990 206,347 -19,357 2011S1 176,808 200,634 -23,826 2011S2 194,527 208,400 -13,873 2012S1 153,205 212,457 -59,253 2012S2 150,849 234,148 -83,299 2013S1 127,796 269,691 -141,895 2013S2 152,976 262,612 -109,636 2014S1 138,274 199,552 -61,278 2014S2 167,180 200,877 -33,698 2015S1 154,659 173,062 -18,404 2015S2 187,455 170,812 16,643 2016S1 186,918 166,819 20,098 2016S2 227,829 160,505 67,323 2017S1 234,070 197,140 36,930 2017S2 298,062 171,720 126,342 2018S1 286,230 169,124 117,106 2018S2 357,454 140,402 217,052 2019S1 349,941 137,367 212,574 2019S2 400,539 158,881 241,658 2020S1 248,029 130,413 117,616 2020S2 219,889 118,148 101,741 2021S1 201,329 197,376 3,953 2021S2 327,527 183,410 144,117 2022S1 478,990 220,443 258,547\n\nPopulation by country of birth as of 2023:[44] Country Population Spain 39,881,155 Morocco 1,026,371 Colombia 715,655 Romania 538,699 Venezuela 518,918 Ecuador 430,837 Argentina 373,064 Peru 322,407 United Kingdom 293,696 France 215,283 Cuba 198,639 Ukraine 197,192 Dominican Republic 193,653 China 192,346 Bolivia 183,734 Honduras 177,616 Germany 176,496 Brazil 167,265 Italy 154,749 Paraguay 127,767 Russia 118,801 Pakistan 114,693 Bulgaria 106,680 Portugal 95,171 Senegal 91,568 Uruguay 86,620 Nicaragua 80,013 Algeria 79,026 Mexico 72,669 Chile 70,307 USA 64,227 India 60,679 Switzerland 59,406 Netherlands 55,312 Philippines 54,807 Belgium 53,460 Poland 52,289 El Salvador 34,392 Nigeria 33,390 Mali 32,676 Gambia 27,574 Moldova 24,134\n\nForeign population\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2024, Spain had a foreign population of 6,581,028.[45][46] The largest groups of foreigners were those of Moroccan, Romanian, British, Chinese and Italian citizenship.[45] Meanwhile in 2024, Spain had a foreign-born population of 8,915,831, being those born in the Americas the largest group, and Europe being the second most common continent of origin after South America.[47]\n\nForeign Population by Nationality[48] Number % 2022 TOTAL FOREIGNERS 5,542,932 EUROPE 2,205,961 EUROPEAN UNION 1,617,911 OTHER EUROPE 588,050 AFRICA 1,217,706 SOUTH AMERICA 1,173,900 CENTRAL AMERICA 368,461 NORTH AMERICA 76,628 ASIA 493,065 OCEANIA 3,580 Instituto Nacional de Estadística\n\nCountry of birth in Spain Resident Population groups Year 2002[49] 2004[49] 2006[49] 2008[49][50] 2010[49] 2012[49] 2014[49] 2016[49] 2018[49] 2020[49] 2022[49][51] Number % Number % Number % Number % Number % Number % Number % Number % Number % Number % Number % Spaniards 39,297,299 95.76% 38,999,785 91.66% 39,371,997 89.46% 39,790,019 87.12% 40,206,557 86.49% 40,523,263 86.55% 40,553,891 87.18% 40,521,758 87.25% 40,459,614 86.74% 40,335,789 85.22% 40,067,582 84.47% Foreigners 1,737,972 4.24% 3,547,669 8.34% 4,637,972 10.54% 5,878,919 12.88% 6,280,064 13.51% 6,294,953 13.45% 5,958,308 12.82% 5,918,341 12.75% 6,198,833 13.26% 6,996,825 14.78% 7,365,311 15.53% Total 41,035,271 100% 42,547,454 100% 44,009,969 100% 45,668,938 100% 46,486,621 100% 46,818,216 100% 46,512,199 100% 46,440,099 100% 46,658,447 100% 47,332,614 100% 47,432,893 100%\n\nEvolution of immigrated population every two years Year Total Percentage 2002\n\n1,737,972\n\n4.24\n\n2004\n\n3,547,669\n\n8.34\n\n2006\n\n4,637,972\n\n10.54\n\n2008\n\n5,878,919\n\n12.88\n\n2010\n\n6,280,064\n\n13.51\n\n2012\n\n6,294,953\n\n13.45\n\n2014\n\n5,958,308\n\n12.82\n\n2016\n\n5,918,341\n\n12.75\n\n2018\n\n6,198,833\n\n13.26\n\n2020\n\n6,996,825\n\n14.78\n\n2022\n\n7,365,311\n\n15.53\n\nReligions\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Religion in Spain\n\nThe Reconquista was the long process by which the Catholics reconquered Spain from Islamic rule by 1492. The Spanish Inquisition was established in 1478 to complete the religious orthodoxy of the Iberian Peninsula. In the centuries that followed, Spain saw itself as the bulwark of Catholicism and doctrinal purity; since then, Catholicism has been the main religion in Spain.[53][54]\n\nSpanish missionaries carried Catholicism to the Americas and the Philippines, establishing various missions in the newly colonized lands. The missions served as a base for both administering colonies as well as spreading Christianity.[55][56][57]\n\nThe Spanish Constitution of 1978 abolished Catholicism as the official state religion, but recognizing the role it plays in Spanish society.[58] From the end of the Francoist dictatorship to the present day, a secularization process has taken place that has meant a progressive decrease in religious practice, in the attendance at the different religious rites (baptisms, communions and Catholic marriages) and in the percentage of Spaniards who identify as Catholic,[59] Consequently, a majority of Spaniards today ignore Catholic doctrines on matters such as pre-marital sex, homosexuality and contraception.[60][61] Despite the drop, Catholic identity nevertheless remains an important part of Spain's culture.[59]\n\nAs of 2018 , 68.5% of the population define themselves as Catholic, 26.4% as non-believers or atheists, and 2.6% other religions according to the official Spanish Center for Sociological Research.[62] Among believers, 59% assert they almost never go to any religious service, by contrast, 16.3% attend one or more religious service almost every week.[62][63]\n\nThere have been three Popes from what is now Spain, all of them from the Crown of Aragon: Calixtus III, Alexander VI and Benedict XIII. Spanish mysticism provided an important intellectual resource against Protestantism with Carmelites like Teresa of Ávila, a reformist nun and John of the Cross, a priest, taking the lead in their reform movement. Later, they became Doctors of the Church. The Society of Jesus was co-founded by Ignatius of Loyola, whose Spiritual Exercises and movement led to the establishment of hundreds of colleges and universities in the world, including 28 in the United States alone. The Society's co-founder, Francis Xavier, was a missionary who reached India and later Japan. In the 1960s, Jesuits Pedro Arrupe and Ignacio Ellacuría supported the movement of Liberation Theology.[citation needed]\n\nA study made by the Union of Islamic Communities of Spain demonstrated that there were about 1,700,000 inhabitants of Muslim background living in Spain as of 2012 , accounting for 3–4% of the total population of Spain. The vast majority was composed of immigrants and descendants originating from Morocco and other African countries. More than 514,000 (30%) of them had Spanish nationality.[64] The recent waves of immigration have also led to an increasing number of Muslims, Buddhists, Sikhs and Hindus. After the Reconquista in 1492, Muslims did not live in Spain for centuries. Their ranks have since been bolstered by recent immigration, especially from Morocco and Algeria.[citation needed] Judaism was practically non-existent in Spain from the 1492 expulsion until the 19th century, when Jews were again permitted to enter the country. Currently there are around 62,000 Jews in Spain, or 0.14% of the total population. Most are arrivals in the past century, while some are descendants of earlier Spanish Jews. Approximately 80,000 Jews are thought to have lived in Spain prior to its expulsion.[65] However the Jewish Encyclopedia states the number over 800,000 to be too large and 235,000 as too small: 165,000 is given as expelled as possibly too small in favour of 200,000, and the numbers of converts after the 1391 pogroms as less. Other sources suggest 200,000 converts mostly after the pogroms of 1391 and upwards of 100,000 expelled. Up until recently, descendants of these Sephardic Jews expelled in 1492 were eligible for Spanish citizenship if they requested it.[66]\n\nLanguages\n\n[edit]\n\nSpanish 99% (88% mother tongue[67]) (official nationwide)\n\nCatalan 16%[68] (9% mother tongue[67]) (co-official in Catalonia, Balearic Islands, and Valencia — see Valencian)\n\nGalician 7% (5% mother tongue[67]) (co-official in Galicia)\n\nBasque 1.6% (1% mother tongue[67]) (co-official in Basque Country and designated areas in Navarre).\n\nAranese (a variant of Gascon Occitan) is co-official in Val d'Aran, a small valley in the Pyrenees.\n\nOthers with no official status:\n\nAsturian-Leonese (in the former Kingdom of León and Asturias)\n\nAragonese (in the province of Huesca, Aragon)\n\nArabic (in the autonomous city of Ceuta)\n\nTarifit (in the autonomous city of Melilla)\n\nEducational system\n\n[edit]\n\nAbout 70% of Spain's students in non-university education attend public schools;[69] 79.1% of students in higher education are enrolled in public universities.[70] The remainder attend private schools or universities, many of which are operated by the Catholic Church.[71]\n\nCompulsory education begins with primary school or general basic education for ages 6–16. It is free in public schools and in many private schools, most of which receive government subsidies[citation needed]. Following graduation, students attend either a secondary school offering a general high school diploma or a school of professional study in all fields – law, sciences, humanities, and medicine – and the technical schools offer programs in engineering and architecture.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nHealth in Spain\n\nList of Spaniards\n\nRomani people in Spain\n\nRanked list of Spanish autonomous communities\n\nSingular population entity\n\nContemporary history of Spain\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
