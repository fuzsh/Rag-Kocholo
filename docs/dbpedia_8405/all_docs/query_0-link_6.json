        "text": "Is it really possible that part of a Western European country could break away, without a legally recognised referendum or the consent of that country's government?\n\nRegarding Catalonia, most commentators and politicians in Madrid never thought the answer to that question could be yes.\n\nAnd by refusing to even entertain the idea of a referendum, the Spanish government believed the pro-independence camp in Catalonia would have nowhere to turn.\n\nHowever, Catalan nationalists have forced the issue.\n\nA year ago they held their own unofficial (in the eyes of Madrid) referendum. They scored 80% in favour of independence, but turnout was low as many boycotted the vote.\n\nThen in September they held a regional election and painted it as a Yes/No vote on independence.\n\nThe nationalists failed to get 50% of the vote. And only with the support of a far-left pro-independence party did the main coalition, Together for Yes, get past the 50% threshold of seats in the Catalan parliament.\n\nBut that didn't stop them. A majority of seats for pro-independence parties was enough for them to claim a \"mandate\" and push on with their project to create a new state.\n\nFor years Catalan nationalists have been warning me that without a referendum they would still proceed.\n\nIn September 2012 I was on the streets of Barcelona amid a sea of red- and yellow-striped Catalan flags (many with the blue triangle and silver secessionist star), chants of \"independence\" and more than a million people.\n\nI was struck by their impassioned rejection of the Spanish state.\n\nIn their eyes, the failings of Spanish politics were catastrophic. For them, the economic crisis enveloping their beloved Catalonia was proof enough.\n\nSurely that demonstration was a wake-up call for the Spanish government?\n\nHowever, it was another three years until I and other foreign Madrid-based journalists were invited to La Moncloa - Spain's version of Number 10 Downing Street or the White House - to be briefed on Catalonia by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's Chief of Staff, Jorge Moraga.\n\nIn at times strong language, he wanted to put across how Madrid saw latest events.\n\nCatalonia did not get a raw economic deal, he argued. Via Catalan public media the nationalists had manipulated public opinion, creating a false sense of grievance amongst Catalans and the impression that the Spanish state was \"anti-Catalan\".\n\nMr Moraga, a Catalan himself, said the opposite was true and argued that the voice of those Catalans (like him) whose DNA was both Spanish and Catalan was being drowned out.\n\nAround the same time, the Spanish foreign minister went head-to-head on Catalan TV in a debate against a leading pro-independence politician.\n\nFor many, the Spanish government woke up late from what appeared, at worst, to be a sense of denial over the Catalan question, and at best a policy of non-engagement."
