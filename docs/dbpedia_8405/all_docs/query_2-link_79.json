Chairman Nadler [presiding]. The House Committee on the Judiciary will come to order. Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare recesses of the committee at any time. We welcome everyone to this afternoon's hearing on Diversity in America: The Representation of People of Color in the Media. Before we begin, I would like to remind members that we have established an email address and distribution list dedicated to circulating exhibits, motions, or other written materials that members might want to offer as part of our hearing today. If you would like to submit materials, please send them to the email address that has been previously distributed to your offices, and we will circulate the materials to members and staff as quickly as we can. I would also remind all members that guidance from the Office of Attending Physician states that face coverings are required at all meetings and in closed spaces, such as committee meetings. Everybody attending this hearing is required to follow this guidance except while speaking, and I will not recognize members to speak who are not in compliance with these rules. If you do not wish to put on a mask, you have the option to participate in this hearing remotely. Finally, I would ask all members, both those in person and those appearing remotely, to mute your microphones when you are not speaking. This will help prevent feedback and other technical issues. You may unmute yourself any time you seek recognition. I will now recognize myself for an opening statement. In recent months, our country has engaged in a much-needed reflection on the role that race and ethnicity play in our society. This reckoning is echoing in the halls of Congress, in our streets, and in board rooms. As with so many industries across the country, it has also generated self-reflection in the entertainment industry. Today the committee continues its examination of race in America with a focus on the representation of people of color in the media. I am fortunate to represent a district that touches nearly every aspect of the entertainment industry in some way. I have seen firsthand many economic and cultural benefits that the performing arts deliver to communities across the country, and I hope that today's discussion will help further our shared goal of fully representing the rich diversity of American society both on screen and behind the camera. The media plays a particularly important role in our society. Movies, television, and, increasingly, content available through streaming services are the mediums by which Americans are inspired and entertained. Motion pictures and television programs are also the means by which Americans are exposed to representations of life different from their own. When the entertainment industry has diverse faces in front of the camera, the viewing public sees stories that resonate with their lives and understand that these stories and experiences are valued and appreciated. It is important, however, that we are also mindful of the power that visual media has to reinforce negative images of racial and ethnic minorities when there is inadequate representation. To be clear, it would be wrong to draw a direct connection between what is portrayed on screen and the racial divide that is reflected in society. After 250 years of slavery, 100 more years of Jim Crow, and 50 more years and counting of structural racism in our country, there is plenty of blame to go around, plenty of work to be done in all levels of government, in the board rooms, in our schools, and in our criminal justice system. And there is no doubt that the divisive rhetoric and fearmongering that emanates from the White House every day is making things worse, not better. But without accurate representation of racial and ethnic minorities in the media, negative stereotypes and tropes may be perpetuated in society, which could ultimately lead to dehumanization and demonization. Unfortunately, studies that have reviewed diversity in the media highlight the challenges we face. In 2019, people of color accounted for only 27 percent of actors in lead roles in nearly 150 major films. While this number has almost tripled from 10-and-a-half percent in 2011, representing a significant improvement on the part of the industry, it does not match the 40 percent that minorities represent in the U.S. populations overall, which should be seen as a floor, not a ceiling. The entertainment industry can and should do better. Talent has no race or gender. Creativity is a gift that, when matched with hard work, can lead to enormous economic and social impacts. It is incumbent on the entertainment industry to ensure that opportunities are afforded to all who wish to pursue their talents. Studies show that the best way to improve representation in front of the camera is to have diversity behind the camera, but sufficient diversity is lacking off screen as well. Ultimately, it is the directors, writers, producers, and executive who determine what stories are told and who is featured in these stories. A lack of adequate minority representation is an industry-wide phenomenon, and there should be a collective effort to make improvements. I appreciate that the industry is aware of the problem and now it is focused on fixing it. A number of industry leaders and groups are working together to address basic pipeline problems, and they are also focused on further diversifying the industry. For example, just earlier in this month in a positive development, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced new criteria that will require, beginning in 2024, that films hoping to qualify for the Best Picture Oscars category meet specific diversity standards in front of and behind the camera. Hopefully these actions by the Academy will help set a standard going forward for all films to prioritize diversity throughout all aspects of a production. I recognize that our discussion today comes at a time when the entertainment industry is facing an existential threat, COVID-19, which is challenging and threatening every element of its business. This disease has had a devastating economic impact across the Nation, not to mention the human toil of hundreds of thousands of lives lost. Within the entertainment industry, they have shut down theater productions in my district indefinitely, and it has dramatically curtailed film productions throughout the country. It is impacting all those who work in the motion picture industry. Particularly of concern, the pandemic is having a disproportionate impact on people of color who work in the industry and who do not have jobs that can be easily transposed to a laptop. Moreover, the pandemic is particularly impacting people of color who are women, LGBTQ, and/or disabled. Their already limited participation in jobs in the film industry has been hampered now even more. As I have made clear throughout this crisis, I am committed to working in partnership with the entertainment industry to ensure that its economic revival is stronger than ever. As productions return to work, however, I hope the industry will take the opportunity to renew its commitment to diversity, on screen and off. I want to thank the Congressional Tri-Caucus-- the Hispanic Caucus, the Black Caucus, and the Asian Pacific American Caucus--for their leadership in bringing attention to this important issue and for spurring action to address it. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses about their personal experiences and about how we can best move forward together. I now recognize the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Jordan, for his opening statement. Mr. Jordan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Even the media is not woke enough for the Democrats. Hollywood is not woke enough for the Democrats. Ninety-six percent of media, their political contributions in 2016 went to Democrats, almost all of Hollywood. We will hear from a witness today who will talk about this. Almost all of Hollywood supports the Democrats, but that is not good enough. This hearing proves no one is safe from the cancel culture. No one is safe from the mob. They will come after you. Look no further than Bari Weiss, former editor at the New York Times. Had to resign because she was engaged, as she said in her piece when she resigned, in wrongthink. Bari Weiss said this. She said this in that resignation letter: ``You say something the mob doesn't like, get ready for `the digital thunderdome.' '' I don't know anyone who could say it better than that. That is what happens. You disagree with the mob, they come after you. They will come after you, and their goal is silence. Recent survey: 62 percent of Americans say they are afraid to freely express themselves. This is the Judiciary Committee. We should remember this. You don't have a First Amendment when people are afraid to speak. You don't have free speech when only one side is allowed to talk. Think about the sports world, a subject one of our witnesses knows a little bit about. Drew Brees said stand for the Anthem. Oh my goodness, did he get attacked. James Harden wears a mask that says ``Back the Blue,'' appropriate thing to do. Frankly, something that should have been mentioned at the outset of this hearing. Last night, two officers were shot. This is the second full hearing we have had following a tragedy where police officers are attacked, and the chairman says nothing. We should be thinking and praying for those families. James Harden wears a ``Back the Blue'' mask, he gets attacked. My favorite, this is how crazy the mob gets. Mike Gundy, football coach at Oklahoma State, 15-year coach, played at Oklahoma State, goes fishing with his kids, fishing with his family, and wears the wrong tee shirt according to the mob. Wears a tee shirt that has a conservative news outlet on the front, the name of one. Oh my goodness, how dare he do that? For all we know he picked the top tee shirt on the pile that day. He has gone fishing with his family. He almost lost his job for fishing in the wrong tee shirt. That is what the mob will do. The mob never stops, political correctness has no end, and now the Democrats are pursuing this so much, they are even going after their best friends in the world, the media and Hollywood. 2019. This gets bigger. Speaking of Hollywood. 2019. China pressured the film industry to remove images of the Japanese and Taiwanese flags from a trailer for the Top Gun sequel. MGM, involved with the remake of the film, Red Dawn, altered the identities of the invading military. I am so old, I remember the first one where it was the Soviet Union. And they did this post-production, said no, no, no, can't be invading military from China. It has got to be North Korea. The Attorney General has pointed out that many scripts likely never see the light of day because writers and producers know that they can't even test the limits. They are going to be attacked again by the mob, and today, obviously, by the Democrats, but this isn't the worst. This isn't the worst of it. Silence is not enough for the mob. This is the scariest part. It is not enough that you be quiet. It is not enough that you can't exercise your free speech rights, your First Amendment liberties. That is not enough. They want you to agree with them. They want to force you to agree with them. You don't believe me? Go watch the videotape. Come into a restaurant. Harass you if you don't raise your fist. Harass you if you don't bend your knee. This is scary, and the idea this committee is having a hearing to foster more of it instead of to speak out against it is even more scary. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today. I hope the Judiciary Committee, as I have said so many times, with a storied history of protecting the Constitution, the rule of law, and the Bill of Rights will say this has got to stop. This has got to stop. And, frankly, you all had a chance. A few weeks ago, 8 weeks ago, when the Attorney General was here, he asked the chairman and the Democrats on this committee why won't you speak out against the violence, why won't you speak out against the mob, and guess what he got? Total silence. Let's speak out now. Let's speak out now. Let's say the First Amendment is sacrosanct. What is going on is wrong, plain wrong, and I think, well, certainly 62 percent of Americans understand it. It is wrong, and we shouldn't be promoting it. I yield back. Chairman Nadler. The gentleman yields back. Without objection, all other opening statements will be included in the record. I will now introduce today's witnesses. Erika Alexander is an actress, writer, director, producer, and entrepreneur. She is also the co-founder of Color Farm Media, an entertainment innovation and social impact company.

We welcome all of our distinguished witnesses, and we thank them for their participation. Now, if you would please rise, I will begin by swearing you in. Do you swear or affirm under penalty of perjury that the testimony you are about to give is true and correct to the best of your knowledge, information, and belief, so help you God? [A chorus of ayes.] Chairman Nadler. Let the record show the witnesses answered in the affirmative. Thank you and please be seated. Please note that each of your written statements will be entered into the record in its entirety. Accordingly, I ask that you summarize your testimony in 5 minutes. To help you stay within that time, there is a timing light on the witness table. When the light switches from green to yellow, you have 1 minute to conclude your testimony. When the light turns red, it signals your 5 minutes have expired. For our witnesses appearing virtually, there is a timer on your screen to help you keep track of time. I want to note that we are joined in the room by Representative Castro, the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, who has been a leader on the issues we are discussing today. Ms. Alexander, you may begin. TESTIMONIES OF ERIKA ALEXANDER, ACTOR/DIRECTOR/PRODUCER AND CO FOUNDER AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, COLOR FARM MEDIA; EDWARD JAMES OLMOS, ACTOR AND PRODUCER; DANIEL DAE KIM, ACTOR AND PRODUCER; JOY VILLA, RECORDING ARTIST, ACTOR, AND AUTHOR; JASON WHITLOCK, SPORTS JOURNALIST; STACY L. SMITH, PH.D., ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF COMMUNICATION AND FOUNDER AND DIRECTOR, ANNENBERG INCLUSION INITIATIVE, ANNENBERG SCHOOL OF COMMUNICATION AND JOURNALISM, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; AND KARYN A. TEMPLE, SENIOR EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND GLOBAL GENERAL COUNSEL, MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION, INC. TESTIMONY OF ERIKA ALEXANDER Ms. Alexander. Thank you. I have been a card-carrying union member and a professional in show business for 37 years, so I'm uniquely qualified to have this discussion. I'll talk about the core tenet that guides my life and progress, that representation matters and how one's character can impact the lives and psychology of today's viewers. I'll address the big picture, and like Deep Throat, I'll tell you to follow the money. Now, I'm a girl from Flagstaff, Arizona. My mother was a teacher. My father was an itinerant preacher. They were both orphans. They had six kids. We lived in the Twilight Hotel, a two-bedroom shack off of Route 66. Perhaps some of you know me for my television and film work on The Cosby Show, Living Single, and Get Out. I am a 2-time NAACP Best Actress winner, and I've done six plays at the Public Theater in New York City. You may know me as the producer of the recent John Lewis documentary, Good Trouble. I'm proud to be a working actor, proud to have made my living in entertainment, but I'm one of the lucky ones. For too long, people of color, women, LGBTQ people, people with disabilities were not represented in mainstream media, and if they were, it was through harmful stereotypes. Media images have power, power to shape opinion and lives for good or ill. I know firsthand that representation matters because of what I call the Maxine Shaw effect. The character of Maxine Shaw, the lawyer that I portrayed on the hit television series, Living Single, has inspired thousands of people to pursue education and careers in law and politics. The character even inspired Stacey Abrams and your esteemed colleague, Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley. Maxine Shaw, a groundbreaking fictional black character, inspired trailblazing, real-life black achievers. And when we say representation matters, we don't just mean on screen, but behind the camera, in the trades, in the departments, and most importantly, in the room where it happens, where decisions are made. Let's talk about the big picture for a second. I've seen and experienced structural racism and discrimination that is part of the unwritten fabric of Hollywood when a television show can have only so many black characters before it becomes a black show and is relegated to the cultural ghetto. That's structural racism. When executives' presumed prejudices lead to the casting of only white or light-skinned black actresses in shows or films that need to make part of their profits overseas, that's structural racism, even though we live in an increasingly diverse world. Here's my experience as a dark-skinned black actress. Certain doors would never be open to me, no matter my accomplishments. When I was young, I would never be cast as an ingenue like my white age peers when I starred for 5 years on the hit network comedy, Living Single. My pay and that of my co-stars was only a small fraction of what our white counterparts were making on Friends from the same studio. My friend, Viola Davis, put it well in a 2008 interview with Porter Magazine: ``If Caucasian women are getting 50 percent of what men are being paid, we're not even getting a quarter of what white women are getting paid.'' Frustrated with the opportunities available, I expanded my skill set and taught myself how to write and to create my own entertainment properties, but here, too, I encountered structural racism. I created a science fiction film and pitched it around town. I was dismayed and disheartened when a white male studio head told me I was wasting my time, that black people don't like science fiction because they don't see themselves in the future. He's saying this to me, a daughter of the people who created jazz, rock and roll, and hip-hop. We are the original futurists in American culture, but this well-paid white gatekeeper was telling me he knew better. And I meet those same people in talent agencies and management companies that set the tone for the town and set the value and the price of my work. If you want to see what and who Hollywood values, follow the money. Yes, there's been some change. Yes, Black Panther, Hamilton, and Crazy Rich Asians made a lot of money. Talk about one of the lucky ones. But for every extraordinary exception like that, there are hundreds more mediocre films with white casts that get greenlit, filmed, marketed, and awarded each year. The lack of diversity in the executive suite leads to this ongoing pandemic of exclusion on the cultural stage. Well, the one super villain Black Panther would not defeat is the racist infrastructure of this industry, so the hero we need is us, we the people, and to address this complex issue, it will take more than a village. It will take a Nation. The government should incentivize companies to support and fund marginalized content creators, though artists and entertainers have been vilified as everything from radicals to spoiled babies. What we really are small businesspeople who make America's number one export and key soft power in the world, entertainment. I say support minority small businesses. What we've done, I created Color Farm Media, a company dedicated to finding new voices. We call ourselves the Motown of film, television, and tech. Our goal is to rebrand blackness. It's why we made the John Lewis documentary, Good Trouble, why I'm making a film about the legendary Boys Choir of Harlem, and why I'm directing a documentary about reparations. The seeds of the future are planted in the stories of today where only certain stories are told, only certain lives matter. Going forward, diversity and true representation in our stories, in our entertainment will ensure that black lives matter, too. Thank you very much. [The statement of Ms. Alexander follows:] [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Chairman Nadler. Thank you. Mr. Olmos. [No response.] Chairman Nadler. Mr. Olmos, you may want to unmute. Mr. Olmos. I am on mute. I am waiting for the video. Chairman Nadler. You got it. You are okay now. Mr. Olmos. Yes. Can you please play the video? Chairman Nadler. Oh. TESTIMONY OF EDWARD JAMES OLMOS [Video shown.] Mr. Olmos. Self-esteem, self-respect, and self-worth is what we're talking about here today. I think Ernesto said it best: it's not the answer that illuminates, it's the question. The question is diversity in America, the representation of people of color in the media. It still does not exist. You got to remember, we're talking about the single most important art form that humans have ever created. Nothing attacks the subconscious mind more. You sit down in front of a theater screen with a dark room and you sit with stereo sound around you with no peripheral vision, everything goes into the subconscious, everything, and it stays there. And I'll tell you right now, if you don't think it affects you, try going out after seeing Jaws and jump in the water on the beach. Now, the situation is this. I played this because collaboration, communication, critical thinking, and creativity is what makes us who we are and builds self-esteem and self- respect. So do the images that we see. Now, the problem with the United States film industry and the industry in general is that it has a habit of not allowing certain stories to be told because they don't make enough money they say. But really, in essence, they are trying to do things that are actually stifling the diversity in this country. For instance, I ask anybody in this room, especially you congressmen here, listen. Name me one American of Mexican descent, Medal of Honor winner that you have ever seen portrayed on the screen in the United States of America on a film. You can't. Why? Because there's never been one. The closest we ever got really was a Silver Star recipient, Guy Gabaldon. All I can tell you is this: Guy, what he did, he was called the pied piper of Saipan. Now, what he did, he brought in 1,500 Japanese to surrender during the attack on Saipan. He brought them in by himself without any weapons. He talked them in and brought him in. He got a Silver Star. Now, the funny thing is, Sergeant Alvin York in World War I did 10 times less than what he did in bringing in a surrendering enemy, and he got a Medal of Honor. You start to see what I'm talking about. But guess what? A Guy Gabaldon movie was made in 1960, and the person who played him was Jeffrey Hunter. We got hit again just most recently with Argo when one of our great, great heroes, CIA agent Tony Mendez, was portrayed. And guess what? No one even knew that he was Latino because the actor/director, great actor, great director, decided that I guess he could get more money to make the movie if he used himself as the actor, even though I think the director and the fact that he was using one of the great, great script writers, ended up saying to him flat out. I mean, they ended up making this movie, and what ended up happening is they had the best film of the year. But why couldn't he have put in someone like Michael Pena, Andy Garcia, Jimmy Smits, Benjamin Bratt, one of the many, many great artists that we have, in the leading role and allowed that situation to happen? I got to say right now, we have a future, and the future is understanding that diversity is the key, and we're not doing it. [The statement of Mr. Olmos follows:] [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Chairman Nadler. Thank you very much. We will now hear from Daniel Dae Kim. TESTIMONY OF DANIEL DAE KIM Mr. Kim. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Jordan, and members of the Judiciary Committee. It is a pleasure to be here with you today, but to be honest, when I was approached to be a part of this hearing, I initially declined. I thought, why do we need to have a hearing about the importance of diversity in media? It seems self-evident that from its creation, America as we know it has been built on the principles of freedom: freedom of religion, freedom from tyranny, freedom of speech. In fact, the very words inscribed at the base of the Statue of Liberty echo the resounding power of these ideas: ``Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed, to me. I lift my lamp beside the golden door.'' Now, these words signify freedom and safe harbor to all who have suffered, regardless of from where they came. Nowhere does it specify that these ideals only apply to those who are white, or male, or Catholic, or heterosexual. Almost by definition, they are an invitation to diversity: diversity of thought and diversity of people. So I thought, why would Congress need to hear from me on this subject? And then I remembered House Resolution 908, passed just this past Friday. I'm sure you all recall it. It was a bill that simply asked you to condemn and denounce anti-Asian sentiment, racism, discrimination, and religious intolerance related to COVID-19. To me, that was a no-brainer. Who wouldn't support condemning racism in 2020, a full 50 years after the Civil Rights Movement? But as I looked at the roll call, I saw that 164 representatives in the House voted against it. That's more than a third of the members of Congress, and more than 80 percent of the Republican members of the House, including some of you watching right now, that could not simply say that anti-Asian sentiment is wrong and should be condemned. Now, you may ask yourself, what does anti-Asian sentiment have to do with representation and diversity in media? Well, as one of my favorite artists, Jenny Holzer says, ``All things are delicately interconnected.'' The media has always been a reflection of our values and culture. From the early days of television and the popularity of shows like Dick Van Dyke, The Ed Sullivan Show, and Leave it to Beaver, we got a glimpse into what it meant to be American in the 50s. They were clean-cut times when the biggest problem for our hero was being the only boy invited to a girl's birthday party. Now, that's an actual storyline, by the way. Now, one look at how different programming is today is a simple reminder of how much our society has changed. A show like Breaking Bad or Atlanta or Ramy would hardly make sense in the context of America in the 50s. Now, another way that our storytelling has changed is the perspective from which our stories are told. In the 60s, all we had to say was, ``Look, up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane,'' to know that our hero was coming to save the day, a hero that was inevitably white. In fact, he was so white that even though he was actually an alien from a planet 27 light years away, he was able to fool everyone into thinking he was actually from Kansas. But things are changing, and now one of the growing number of exceptions to that rule also happens to be America's highest-grossing superhero film of all time, Black Panther, a film with African-American leads, African-American heroes. Rethinking the paradigm to encourage diversity is one of the primary reasons I created my own production company. I believe that we as creators and producers must work to create fully-realized characters from all places and backgrounds, and showcase them in stories where they can lead, be heroes, be complex or, in some cases, just be simple slice-of-life folks, like the Cleavers. It's my belief that the diversity that has made this country great can and should be reflected in our entertainment in front of and behind the camera. I do have a confession to make, though. Like Ranking Member Jordan, I can't wait for the day that we no longer have to have hearings like this about diversity. I can't wait for the day that people can say, can you believe there was a time where people thought all Latino-Americans were illegal immigrants, or that all Muslims are terrorists, or that black lives didn't matter; to have so many different portrayals of races that as Martin Luther King so eloquently put it, ``People can be judged by the content of their character and not the color of their skin.'' I would also add to that, not who they love, not which God they worship, or what disability may have. Perhaps then when a bill like 908 comes up, our elected representatives can unanimously show empathy and support for Asian-Americans, who, according to a recent report, had been victims of more than 2,800 acts of discrimination just since March. I look forward to the future when hate crimes and racism become nothing more than a relic from a shameful past. Proper representation in the media is one of the most powerful ways we can make that future a reality. Thank you. [The statement of Mr. Kim follows:] [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Chairman Nadler. Thank you. Ms. Villa. TESTIMONY OF JOY VILLA Ms. Villa. Mr. Chairman, ranking members, and members of this committee, thank you for inviting me to speak. My name is Joy Villa. I'm a number-one Billboard artist, actress, and conservative actress. I've lived with and dealt with this topic for my entire life. I've never taken a day off from being a woman of color. I'm the author of Kickass Conservative. I produced it and starred in a new film. I've toured over 35 countries, and I proudly support President Donald J. Trump and the sovereignty of the American people. I'm mixed race. I'm black, Choctaw Native-American on my mother's side, and I'm Italian and Argentinian on my father's side. I'm extremely proud of my diverse background. I strongly believe in and have fought for diversity. Many of my peers in Hollywood and media proudly promote diversity of race, background, heritage, sexuality, religion, and culture, as they should. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences wants to mandate diversity in the Oscars nomination process. This is wrong. I would like to be hired for the role because I'm the best person for the job, not because my color or gender checks a mandated box. That's tokenism. Until I came out as a Trump supporter by wearing a fabulous Make America Great Again dress to the Grammys 4 years ago, I'd never been blacklisted. Back in 2015, talk show host, Jimmy Kimmel, talked favorably with Kelly Osbourne about one of my red carpet gowns. This was before I was a conservative. In 2018, Ava DuVernay, the celebrated black filmmaker who said she wants to use more black actresses in her films and have more diversity, blocked me on Twitter. I was blacklisted from industry events. I was not welcome on talk shows. I was not included in pop culture magazines or publications unless as the butt of a joke. Rolling Stone magazine told my publicist they would not write about me because of my politics. One casting director called me ``that Trump bitch.'' I've been called a race traitor and Uncle Tom, Aunt Jemima, house nigger, slave, been told to go back to Africa, told to straighten my nappy hair, called a puta Negra--that is ``black bitch''--that I should be deported. And even worse, I've had threats against my life and my family's lives. These remarks come only from the so-called tolerant left, who preach that they want diversity. To be clear, this did not happen because I'm black, or because I'm Latina, or because I'm a woman. It happened because I'm openly conservative. Hollywood is a monopoly right now. There are six major studios, and none to my knowledge are committed to diversity of thought. The big six are comprised of motion picture conglomerates 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures, Warner Brothers, Universal Pictures, Columbia Pictures, and Walt Disney Studios, and they account for over 83 percent of the North American market share, bringing in billions of dollars of revenue each year. What happened to me is discrimination. They don't like pro-Trumpers, pro-America, pro-life, or pro-God. They want to shut down, keep out, and crush any type of diversity because it makes them uncomfortable. They're taking that discomfort and actively, openly discriminating against people in the workplace. This hearing is meaningless and benign if it doesn't also address the active canceling of diverse voices going on right now. Yes, we need racial and ethnic diversity, and representation matters, but diversity is not only about color, gender, or how able bodied someone is or isn't. We need to stop the discrimination against political affiliation. It's dangerous, it's destructive, and it's grounded in emotion and fear, not facts. Just as we have protected classes in our country under Federal law for race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, sexuality, and disability, it's time to include political affiliations. Congress has an opportunity to be a watchdog and to set the tone. I'm an American first and foremost. I'm proud of our country, and I want to see it thrive. I want to see it protected for future generations as well. I implore Congress to act now by expanding the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include political affiliation as a protected class. Media companies that agree in writing not to discriminate based on political leanings could be offered certain advantages such as tax breaks. This is about protecting all Americans, no matter who they are, where they live, or what kind of work they do, and no matter how loud or quiet their voices are. The First Amendment gives us the freedom of association. I strongly believe that that includes the right to freely associate with the political party of one's choosing. Political bigotry is silencing the voices of Americans. Thank you. [The statement of Ms. Villa follows:] [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Chairman Nadler. Thank you. Mr. Whitlock. TESTIMONY OF JASON WHITLOCK Mr. Whitlock. Good afternoon. I'd like to begin by thanking Representative Jim Jordan and his staff for the opportunity to speak today on a topic central to my life's work and mission: diversity in the media. My name is Jason Whitlock. I'm a partner and content creator at OutKick.com, a media platform with the mission of creating a fearless culture in support of sports, masculinity, and free speech. Before taking an ownership stake in OutKick, I was a well- known sports columnist for the Kansas City Star and a personality and host at ESPN and Fox Sports. My written work has also been published at Playboy magazine, the Huffington Post, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and at Fox News. In the last decade, I was involved in a journalism project, ESPN's The Undefeated, and a television project, Fox Sports talk show, Speak for Yourself, designed to elevate, develop, and support black content creators. Today's topic is not an issue I've paid lip service to. I've lived it. I'm humbled and honored to have a voice worthy of being heard before this audience at this time in American history. Thomas Jefferson rightly argued that he would rather have newspapers without government than government without newspapers. Jefferson made clear in our Declaration of Independence that he believed in the power of self-evident truth, and he knew that journalism was a primary tool to make truth self-evident. A journalistic search for truth forced America to deal with the founding principle Jefferson spelled out: ``All men are created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.'' Today, across this country, we hear protesters, rioters, and anarchists in our streets chanting, ``No justice, no peace.'' They say they are doing this on behalf of black lives. They have aligned justice with the threat of violence. Justice's true ally is truth, not war. Truth precedes justice. No truth, no justice. The racial justice so many people say they're clamoring for cannot be one absent of truth. The healthy diversity that so many people say they want reflected in the media cannot be built on false narratives and outright lies. We are here today to discuss diversity and its ability to make our Union more perfect. We can't get there without first discussing our abandonment of truth. No truth, no justice. What is standing in the way of truth and, therefore, standing in the way of holistic diversity? Big Tech and Silicon Valley's hijacking of journalism. Google, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube made race clickbait the gold standard of American journalism. They are the stewards of fake news. When I graduated from Ball State University in 1990, the journalism industry catered to New York liberalism. Thirty years later, the industry caters to Northern California radicalism and groupthink. Producing work that triggers algorithms that lead to likes, retweets, and follows is the mandate enforced by media executives. Social media has transformed the mainstream media, turning seekers of truth into seekers of influence. It's had the same impact on athletes. They are no longer role models. They're influence peddlers. LeBron James, a basketball prodigy with more than 80 million social media followers, has more influence over news coverage than any single journalist. He is our Walter Cronkite. Colin Kaepernick and athletes across professional sports have forced the NFL and NBA to promote the false narrative that there is a pandemic of police brutality sweeping America's black communities. Facts do not support this narrative. I say that having lost a cousin that I helped raise to what me and my family believed was an abuse of force by law enforcement in 2012. The outrage and pain that so many claim they feel over Breonna Taylor's tragic death in Louisville, I know firsthand. A picture of my cousin sits in my living room. Every day I look at Anton Butler's face. Indianapolis sheriffs tasered him to death in the rain. There will be no justice for my cousin or anyone until the American media refocuses on a search for truth, and the truth is, as it relates to the mainstream media, the diversity we're lacking right now isn't racial. We lack the resolve to follow the truth, wherever it leads. Big Tech eliminated the search for truth. Big Tech installed athletes, celebrities, and rigged algorithms as journalists. The media has always leaned left. It's the disregard for truth that is killing America, though. Slapping black faces on Silicon Valley lies won't improve America. No truth, no justice. [The statement of Mr. Whitlock follows:] [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Chairman Nadler. Thank you, Mr. Whitlock. I want to note that we are in the middle of a long series of votes on the floor. We wanted to start the hearing on time to respect the time of our witnesses, but I and the other members will be filtering in and out so that we can vote. Please do not take any offense if you see some of our members leaving the room. And we will call on Dr. Smith now. TESTIMONY OF STACY L. SMITH, PH.D. Ms. Smith. Mr. Chairman and members of the House Judiciary Committee, since 2005, I've conducted more than 50 studies on diversity and inclusion on screen and behind the camera in entertainment. Much of my work has focused on identity groups that have been historically marginalized in the industry. Using this body of research, I will illuminate here the exclusion of the BIPOC community in fictional films whereas my written remarks include TV and streaming content. Three major claims can be made about the BIPOC community in film. First, progress has been paltry for BIPOC characters in feature films. Across 1,300 top films from 2007 to 2019, only 17 percent of all leads and co-leads were from underrepresented racial ethnic groups. To illuminate the disconnect between Hollywood films and reality, only two movies depicted a Hispanic or Latino lead in 2019, despite the fact that 18.5 percent of the U.S. population is Hispanic/Latino, as are 21 percent of moviegoers. Moving from speaking characters, only 34 percent of all speaking characters across the 100 top movies of 2019 were from an underrepresented racial ethnic group. However, no meaningful change, no meaningful change, has been observed in the percentage of black, Latino, or Asian characters on screen since 2007. The epidemic of invisibility on screen, particularly for women of color, is problematic. Across 100 movies last year, a full 33 erased black girls and women, 55 deleted Asian females, 71 movies were devoid of Hispanic Latinas, 92 excised Middle Eastern and North African girls and women. Indigenous females were virtually missing in every top movie. And to illustrate the breadth of exclusionary casting practices, 598 of the top 600 movies across the last 6 years did not show a single transgender woman of color on screen. Besides invisibility, far too many roles played by black, Latino, Asian, or Mina actors still focus on crime and violence. This can perpetuate stereotyping, particularly among those who have little direct experience with individuals from these groups. The reason for these trends becomes apparent once you look behind the camera. The second major claim is that few BIPOC directors own top films. Across 1,300 movies, people of color filled only 14 percent of all directing jobs, and the vast majority of these jobs were held by BIPOC men. Only 13 women of color have worked as directors across 1,300 films. This translates into a ratio of 92 white male directors to every one woman of color. Why is inclusion behind the camera so important? Because BIPOC directors are more likely than their white counterparts to tell stories that feature underrepresented actors on screen, and BIPOC crew are hired below the line. The third claim is that mythologizing drives hiring practices. My qualitative work has shown that industry decisionmakers perceive that BIPOC talent and stories are not a box office draw. However, this myth is so far from reality. When a variety of production distribution and exhibition factors were statistically controlled across 1,200 movies, the underrepresented status of leads and co-leads was positively associated with box office revenue in the U.S. What does this mean? BIPOC leads sell. Internationally, the underrepresented status of leads was not associated with box office performance, suggesting that international audiences are drawn to good stories with white or BIPOC protagonists. There are real consequences to this industry mythologizing. Production budgets and marketing resources for film starring BIPOC leads are lower than those for white leads. Films starring women of color are particularly disadvantaged in terms of resource allocation. These results, along with the reality that underrepresented audiences buy 46 percent of the tickets at the box office, demonstrate that biases detrimentally impact the lives and careers of BIPOC creators. So given these claims, what can be done? Entertainment companies must create and adopt inclusion policies immediately, setting target inclusion goals, using objective and quantifiable criteria to eliminate bias hiring, and enacting these policies throughout their entire supply chain. These policies must be transparent so that consumers and stakeholders can hold them publicly accountable. Government intervention in the form of tax incentives that reward inclusion, not just quotas, are one way to improve participation of BIPOC communities in the production process. Last, providing increased governmental funding for storytelling is a crucial way to change the status quo. These and other solutions will ensure that qualified and talented individuals from all backgrounds receive opportunities and access throughout the entire entertainment industry. Thank you. [The statement of Ms. Smith follows:] [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Ms. Scanlon [presiding]. Thank you very much. And now we will hear from Karyn Temple. TESTIMONY OF KARYN A. TEMPLE, ESQUIRE Ms. Temple. Thank you, Chairman Nadler, Ranking Member Jordan, and members of the committee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to testify on behalf of the Motion Picture Association and our member studios on the important issue of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the motion picture and television industry. Although I just recently joined the MPA as global general counsel, I have worked in and with the entertainment industry for most of my legal career. So the issue before the committee is not just an abstract position for me. It is one that I care about deeply and personally as an African-American woman, mother, American citizen, and a human being. I grew up at a time when there were no movie fairytale princesses who looked like me, no leading franchise superheroes, no kids TV series that reflected my reality, so I'm not here to sugarcoat things for you today. While our industry has made some significant progress and I will highlight many of those initiatives for you, let me be clear: the entertainment industry still has a long way to go before we reflect the true diversity of this country, both in front of and behind the camera. From the top executives and A-list actors, to writers and producers on down to below the line crew, our industry and the stories we tell often do not represent the full spectrum of society. That must change. The first step to actually solving any problem is to acknowledge and own it, so I readily concede that there is a problem of diversity and inclusion in Hollywood, but today I'd like to focus on how we and our member studios have mobilized to fix it. We at the MPA are committed to great storytelling that reflects the viewpoints and experiences of all creators and audiences, which is why we are working hard with our member studios to collectively address diversity, gender parity, authentic cultural representation, and pipeline recruitment opportunities from underrepresented communities in our industry. By establishing programs that promote a diverse talent pipeline, creating new partnerships, and sharing what we learn, we are leading by example. Eight years ago, we established our own Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Program because our members proactively supported the MPA playing a constructive role in making sure our industry is open and welcoming to people of all backgrounds. We're proud of our track record since. Through our DE&I Program, we have supported increasingly robust efforts by the industry to enhance the diversity of the creative pipeline, including via outreach to film schools and groups representing African- American, Latinx, Asian-American and Pacific Islander, Native- American women, and LGBTQ creators. We're grateful for the opportunity to partner with many such organizations, including the entertainment industry, college outreach programs, the Georgia Latino Film Alliance, and the Ghetto Film School, a nonprofit whose groundbreaking Roster Program trains 4,000 aspiring young creators annually for careers in creative industries, the vast majority of which are from underrepresented groups. And, most recently, MPA was proud to announce a partnership with the Native-American Media Alliance, focused on promoting Native-American writers in the entertainment industry. We also collaborate with many of the leading multicultural creative organizations and film festivals, including the American Black Film Festival, the Georgia Latino Film Festival, and the New York Latino Film Festival. Beginning in January of 2019, we also proactively reached out to the Tri-Caucus to educate members about MPA's and our member studios' efforts, and to foster opportunities for Congress to hear directly from multicultural creator organizations working on the front lines of fostering change. Indeed, we've initiated many such important dialogue schools in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., and continue to do so despite COVID-19. But, of course, what matters most is what our member studios are doing in this area. I am gratified that today there are movie fairytale princesses that look like girls in my community, television shows that feature dynamic, strong black, Asian, and Hispanic girls, and movies with black superheroes that touch the world. We're proud that each studio in the MPA has its own robust corporate policies, senior-level diversity and inclusion-focused personnel, and other programs. Our members have established a large number of mentorship and other programs specifically designed to give members of underrepresented groups the necessary training and relationship building necessary to gain a foothold in the industry. I'll refer you to my written test of testimony for most of the details, but I did want to just mention two examples. Sony Pictures' Diverse Directors Program, which is now in its 7th year, has enabled the studio to identify emerging women and directors of color, and has resulted in numerous program alums actively directing for Sony Pictures and throughout the industry. The Walt Disney Company has many programs and policies to address these issues, including the U.S. Hispanic Initiative, a company-wide effort focused on growing relevancy to and engagement with U.S. Hispanics, and a longstanding Creative Talent Development Program to diversify the creative pipeline that has helped launch the careers of many industry professionals, including Peter Murrieta and Zetna Fuentes. I want to thank the committee for the opportunity to be part of the discussion on these important issues, and we remain committed to working with you until our shared goals of a fully-diverse, equitable, and inclusive motion picture and television industry becomes a reality. I welcome your questions. Thank you. [The statement of Ms. Temple follows:] [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Ms. Scanlon. Thank you to all of our witnesses. We will now proceed under the 5-minute rule with questions, and I will recognize Ms. Lofgren for 5 minutes. Ms. Lofgren. Thank you very much, and thanks to each and every one of our witnesses. You know, Hispanic Heritage Month is an appropriate time to be discussing underrepresentation in media, especially when the traditional home of the industry, California, my home, is almost 40 percent Hispanic, and even higher in Los Angeles, about half Hispanic, and yet that only accounts for 3 percent of directors and 4 percent of producers. You know, like all for-profit businesses, movie and TV studios and other media companies are ultimately driven by their financial bottom line and [inaudible] short sighted to reflect biases. But, in the end, including racial and ethnic representation should be good business given the audience, and we have had some examples mentioned here by our witnesses today. So I am struggling to understand why this economic imperative has not been successful in moving Hollywood into more into more diversity. And I am wondering--it was so wonderful to listen to you, Mr. Olmos--about why this matters, sitting in the movie theater, having these things go directly into your consciousness. It matters who is represented and how people understand our society, and movies play such a role in that. Talk to me about why the bottom line hasn't moved us to where we need to be, Mr. Olmos. Mr. Olmos. The bottom line comes from the understanding that they don't have to. If they put out a movie with a person that is ``Latino'' in a secondary role or third role, we go to the theaters, and we make up 32 to 37 percent of all the box office on opening weekend. We always put a lot of money into the situation. I think what is happening and why I presented the video, is that we have to turn around and understand that we have a responsibility for ourselves. The only way it is going to change is if we change. We need to have the writers. We need to have in front of camera and behind the camera people organized and ready to go. That is why the Youth Cinema Project is way beyond anybody's imagination. Over the last 6 years, we have actually put together over 1,400 children in 13 different school districts that take this program twice a week for 90 minutes with mentors in the classroom. We are creating over 130 feature films or films by these students from 4th grade through high school, all the way through high school, every year. We produce more film than anyone. Now, I will tell you this. It will take another 10 or 15 years, but it is going to change. Scorsese, Coppola, all of the great directors that we have ever known did not have in the 4th grade someone mentoring them to become filmmakers and understand themselves. And we are not trying to make filmmakers, by the way. We are trying to make lifelong learners. Ms. Lofgren. It was wonderful to see the film of what you are doing, and I thank you for that. It is a wonderful contribution to American society. Dr. Smith, I am wondering if you might also jump in on the question of why the profit incentive hasn't actually moved to Hollywood to where we would hope they would be. Ms. Smith. Well, I think there are a few things that are operating, and I addressed some of them in my remarks. There is a lot of mythologizing about decision making. If you look in my written remarks, we surveyed or conducted in-depth interviews with over 20 underrepresented directors and asked them about the impediments that they face, and market forces that are politicized seems to be one of the major factors. Individuals in greenlighting positions have perceptions about what sells and what doesn't sell, and resource allocation is very problematic, particularly for women of color. They are given lower production costs, lower marketing budgets, their films are released in fewer theaters, and so they have less support for their films to do as well as their counterparts. Some of this is true with films led by men of color as well. So that adage of you have to work twice as hard to get half as far is actually quite true. Yet our economic reality of the data and the analysis that we did on 1,200 films suggest that there is a viable market for BIPOC leads and co-leads. So the executive ranks feature very few people of color. There are few directors of color to ensure that their stories are being told, and without a change in how the industry hires and crews up, this inequality will keep perpetuating over time. Ms. Lofgren. Well, that is why I was focusing on directors and producers. Obviously, there is an issue throughout the industry. My time has expired. Before I yield back, I had questions for Karyn Temple, but I do want to just thank her for her service to our country when she was in the Copyright Office. You have moved on to, you know, bigger fields, but we do appreciate the work that you did there, and thank you so much for your service. And I yield back, Madam Chair. Ms. Scanlon. Thank you. The chair now recognizes Mr. Biggs for 5 minutes. Mr. Biggs. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Villa, it is good to see you again. Thanks for being here today. Thanks to all the witnesses for being here today. Ms. Villa, I really want to pay tribute to you. Thank you for your advocacy for the unborn. Ms. Villa. Thank you. Mr. Biggs. Talk to us about the negative backlash that you have received from Hollywood for supporting President Trump, his pro-life policies, and defunding organizations like Planned Parenthood, please. Ms. Villa. Absolutely. Thank you so much. Being a proud pro-life woman, having given a child up for adoption, and having experienced the pressure of the nurse who gave me a pregnancy test to abort my child when I was 20 years old, was incredibly traumatic. There is a pressurization for women, especially women of color, to get an abortion no matter what. There is nothing talked about saying, you know, you are strong, you are proud, you are Latina, you are black, you can raise the baby or you can choose adoption, and I would rather our tax dollars go to adoption than abortion. But as far as my attacks, there have been rape threats and death threats on my life simply for being pro-life, and in Hollywood, it is something that is the unspoken secret that you cannot celebrate life. You cannot celebrate God. You cannot say ``I'm a proud pro-life Christian'' in Hollywood and achieve the same success that many A-listers do. In fact, many actresses brag about on the way up to their golden statuettes that they gave their children up so that they could achieve their dreams. And as someone who hopes to become a mother one day, I implore all mothers and fathers do not co- sign this narrative. It's incredibly dangerous to young girls to tell them you can do anything you want except have a career and also be a mother. Abortion is not the option. Choosing life is the most important fight, and I'm proud that our President approves of this and is defunding Planned Parenthood. And Hollywood needs to open up and stop discrimination against pro-life women and men. Because if we are truly going to talk about diversity and supporting women, we need to talk about the unborn, the most vulnerable. Mr. Biggs. Thank you for your testimony. Thank you for speaking out. Mr. Whitlock, you have written extensively about Black Lives Matter and how they have corrupted the minds of many young athletes, and you recently wrote that boycotting sports leagues for supporting BLM would be ineffective in causing change. You go on to state that your ``alternative to boycotting major league sports is a holistic approach of educating the athletes on what they are actually supporting. BLM is Marxist, anti-religion, anti-nuclear family, and racially divisive.'' Big sports media companies tend to drive home the deal in narrative on behalf of athletes. Can you elaborate on how you are going about educating athletes on BLM, please? Mr. Whitlock. Yeah. I'm just trying to write about it on Outkick and talk about it on our YouTube page because I believe many of the athletes--I know many athletes. They have Christian values. They were raised in Christian homes. And I don't think they truly understand Marxism. I don't think they know that the women who founded Black Lives Matter are trained Marxists. I don't think they realize that if you went to Black Lives Matter's own Web page, the ``what we believe'' section of their Web page was just an expression of Marxist theory. And so--and they've scrubbed some of that ``what we believe'' because there has been a lot of pushback. Athletes over in Europe, the European soccer leagues, they're backing away from Black Lives Matter because they realize how divisive it is, how anti-Western civilization it is. And so, you know, I don't--I used to be--I was a college athlete. That's how I made it from poverty to a good life was a football scholarship. I don't want to demean athletes in any way. But a lot of times when you're a great athlete, you work on developing your body because it's a smart thing to do. There's a big payday if you do it. And there are some things that you kind of skip over. And I can say that when I was in my 20s, there were a lot of things I didn't understand. And I think a lot of these athletes, when you say the word ``Marxism,'' I don't think they understand the threat of Karl Marx and his political theory. The threat it poses to Christian values. The threat it poses to people that believe in a nuclear family. And so I'm just trying to point these things out to athletes, trying to educate them on, you know, what Black Lives Matter's real agenda is, and I legitimately think that Black Lives Matter is one of the most racist organizations we've ever seen in the history of America. Bigots love Marxism. And Marxism--it's a great marketing scheme, Black Lives Matter. It's a great slogan. But if you look at the truth of what it truly represents and the agenda it's working toward, it will lead to the destruction not just of America, but in particular black America. The things that allowed us to overcome slavery and make it to where we had a President elected twice in Barack Obama, the things that allowed us this incredible journey, our faith, is under attack through BLM. As I listen to Joy Villa talk about Hollywood, I lived in Los Angeles for a decade. It is hostile towards Christian values. We've just gone way too secular, and this thing is driven by Silicon Valley and their social media apps. Twitter has got to be the most secular place on Earth. If you express any type of religious faith, you're ostracized and criticized. So I just want to take a long-term approach and just try to engage athletes in a positive way and explain to them what the organization truly represents and hope that some of them wake up. Ms. Scanlon. Thank you. The gentleman's time has expired. Mr. Biggs. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Whitlock. Ms. Scanlon. Next, the chair will recognize a longstanding leader in diversity issues, the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. Jackson Lee. Madam Chair, thank you so very much. And let me thank Mr. Nadler and Mr. Jordan for providing us with such a rich diversity of thought. That is clearly, I think, an important element of this, and I am delighted that the witnesses, who are of varying opinions, have had their opportunity to raise their voices. I do want to take just a moment and say that the young people that I have worked with in my own constituency, Black Lives Matter are true young Americans. They are college students. They are empowered young athletes, brilliant. They are thoughtful. They love this country, and they just want to see a life led by young people maybe less fortunate than themselves that would be in a nation that re-imagines policing and has a just response to justice for all. I have had the privilege of working with them since the tragedy of the killing of Trayvon Martin. I know his mother to be a patriot, and the mothers of the movement, from Eric Garner to Tamir Rice to the mother of Michael Brown, and now as we watch the tragedies that have occurred just recently of Breonna Taylor and, of course, George Floyd and Jacob Blake. I also think it is important to note that yesterday a coalition of players--athletes, pro ball--of various leagues endorsed H.R. 40, the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals. Young men, recognizing the history of not only their people, but their neighborhoods, thoughtful young men. So let me indicate, first of all, to Erika Alexander and then to Mr. Kim, if I can quickly, and speak to how hurtful the decades have been because you are not decades, but you are a historian, when people of color were blackballed for several reasons--their looks, their hair, but also the studios were not interested because they didn't make money. Can you answer that question? I have a question for Mr. Kim, and I am going to try to get in these outstanding, all of you outstanding actors, but this great historian and actor Edward Olmos. Ms. Alexander. Ms. Alexander. Yes, ma'am. Thank you---- Ms. Jackson Lee. Did you hear the---- Ms. Alexander. Could you please say that question again? Ms. Jackson Lee. How has the question of race--your looks, your hair, and studios' lack of interest because of money, meaning these are not profitable films--impacted black artists. Ms. Alexander. It's impacted them greatly. It's limited their--not only their earning power, but the potential for progress. You know, when we talk about diversity, we really should be saying ``racial justice'' because that's exactly what it is. Inside of all these issues, inside of saying people who I may not even agree with, we're talking about expanding the human experience. But when you stop any one person for the way they look, for the way they present, you're stopping not only the human story, you're stopping the American story, which is one of greatness and power because of e pluribus unum, ``from many, one.'' So once we start telling the story, the people who are most marginalized, we expand the vision of ourselves, and more importantly, we innovate inside of it. And since our best and most powerful export is creativity and culture, we can't--we will know that when we're doing that, we limit the power of the United States. And that's how important it is. And the years that they've done that has stopped the United States from being its most powerful self. Ms. Jackson Lee. Mr. Olmos--thank you so very much. Mr. Olmos and Mr. Kim, I am going to ask you this. So, hopefully, you will get in your comments. Mr. Olmos, culture reflects the Nation. The Nation reflects culture. What someone says, politics is intertwined. Public service, public leaders' words mean something. What does it mean when you have the leading officer in the Nation, the President, describe Latinx people as drug dealers? Mr. Kim, what does it mean when COVID-19 that has hit minorities harder than any other population is described as the ``China virus'' for culture, for people understanding, which is what art is all about, making sure people understand difference or tell stories differently, whether it is fiction or not. Mr. Olmos, your comments, please. Mr. Olmos. It's devastating to my children, to myself, to people of Latino descent. It only can be said that anyone that speaks like this about another culture has the right to do that in this country, but they don't have the right to tell lies, and that's what's happening. Not every single person--they encompass so much. I'm not going to say that we don't have people that are doing things that are against the law, but so are all the cultures. What makes me sad is that we haven't gotten to the point of where we understand who we are as people. What we've got to understand is that there's only one race, the human race. That's it. There's no African or indigenous or Asian or Latino or Caucasian race. There's only one race, the human race. And inside of that, there are cultures. But you cannot tell me that English, the English looked like or act or feel like the Irish--go ahead. Ms. Scanlon. I am sorry, Mr. Olmos. The gentlewoman's time has expired. Ms. Jackson Lee. Thank you. Ms. Scanlon. Mr. Kim, could you answer very, very briefly? Ms. Jackson Lee. Thank you so much, Madam Chair. Mr. Kim. Mr. Kim. Sure. I will say--I will say that when the leader of our country refers to a virus as--as coming from a particular country, he may have his own reasons for doing that that are political and a statement against maybe the leadership of that country. But the virus does have a scientific name, and that is COVID-19. And when the ramifications of the words he uses not only affects Chinese people, but Chinese Americans and all Asian Americans to the tune of 2,800 hate crimes or acts of violence against them in several months, that's something that needs to get examined because words do matter. And so, and our leadership sets the tone. Ms. Jackson Lee. Thank you. That means diversity is crucial in the arts. Thank you so very much, Madam Chair, for your courtesy. I yield back. Ms. Scanlon. Thank you. The gentlewoman from Arizona is recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. Lesko. Thank you, Madam Chairman. And I want to thank all of the people that are testifying, and I appreciate your success and applaud you for your successes. First of all, I want to say that I agree. All people should be treated equally, and they should not be discriminated against. And so I call on my Democratic colleagues and some of the testifiers to stand up for people that have diversity in thought as well. As we have heard from Joy Villa today that she has been discriminated against because of her beliefs, because she is pro-life, because she supports Donald Trump. And I hope that you will realize and think about it that if the discrimination that you have witnessed and you have experienced because of your race or sex that you have told us about, I hope you realize the same thing is happening about people's beliefs. For instance, I am a pro-life woman, and I stood up against Government funding of abortions. And national Planned Parenthood put my phone number, my home phone number out for the whole world to see. And I got the most vile calls. People telling me I should stick things in different places that you don't want to know. This is not right. So I agree with you. We should not discriminate. But please, tell your coworkers, tell your coproducers, tell your other people you should not discriminate based on what people believe. There is too much cancel culture going on right now. People are afraid. Workers are afraid to speak up for fear they are going to get fired. This is happening in all different sectors. So I do not have questions today, but I want you to think about this. When you have seen discrimination because of race, because of sex, or you have experienced it, please know that people right now are being discriminated against because of what they believe. There is an instance right in Arizona State University--I am from Arizona. There is a young woman who is a student employee, who was the manager of a student radio station. All she did was retweet out something. It wasn't even bad. And all of a sudden, she is fired. This is outrageous. And so I hope that you will understand that no one should be discriminated against, not only because of--not just because of their race, not just because of their sex, but also because of what we believe. Because our country was founded on people having different opinions, and if we squelch the opinions of one side just because we don't agree with them, the future of our Nation is at risk. And Mr. Kim, the reason that people voted against the resolution that you are talking about was because inserted in that was a political attack specifically designed against the President of the United States. I have a large Asian-American community in my district, and I totally appreciate them. And I try to respect all people, no matter what their race, no matter what their sex, and certainly, no matter what they believe. So thank you all for testifying. Please take my words to heart. And with that, I yield back. Ms. Scanlon. Thank you. The chair recognizes Mr. Deutch for 5 minutes. Mr. Deutch. Thank you, Madam Chairman. Madam Chairman, there are certain fundamentals that underlie everything that we do here in Congress. We have a shared faith in our institutions, even when we examine and challenge them. We have a shared tradition of defending the right to vote, even when we disagree on how best to accomplish that. And we have a shared trust that there will be a peaceful transition of power, regardless of whether we like the outcome of an election. President Trump's comments yesterday, his inability to acknowledge that there will be a peaceful transition of power, undercut these shared truths. We cannot just continue going about this committee's business or allow any person to undermine the bedrock of our democracy that free and fair elections determine our Government and our leaders. So I would ask this committee, I would ask my colleagues that we join together to protect our democracy, protect our citizens and their right to vote, and to protect America. Now yesterday, we learned that no one will be charged in the death of Breonna Taylor. No charges for an officer blindly firing into Breonna Taylor's apartment, killing her. And that is because that is how the system that we have works. The racism that denies Breonna Taylor justice is baked in. That is how Kimberle Crenshaw, executive director of the African American Policy Forum, put it yesterday. I quote her. ``If we thought the problem and the solution to the tragedy of Breonna Taylor was simply prosecuting these cops, then we are not understanding the broader systemic conditions that allow for the kind of policing that disproportionately imperils black Americans,'' which is to say we have got a lot of work to do. This committee has a lot of work to do. Our Government, law enforcement agencies, courts, schools, workplaces, and yes, our entertainment and media, too, have a lot of work to do to address those systemic conditions that deny Breonna Taylor justice and that deny us all justice as a result. Madam Chairman, I would like to enter into the record this Washington Post article entitled ``Allegations of Racism Have Marked Trump's Presidency and Become Key Issue as Election Nears.'' Ms. Scanlon. Without objection. [The information follows:] MR. DEUTCH FOR THE OFFICIAL RECORD ======================================================================= [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Deutch. Thank you. I want to thank all of the witnesses for taking the time to share their experiences with us. Diversity and representation in media matters. The stories that we tell and the people we see telling them are connected to how we see people in our daily lives. Ms. Temple, I appreciate your sharing your own experiences and your proactive agreement, but more needs to be done by your industry in this regard. And I know that MPA and others in the industry have begun the process of developing a more diverse pool of talent in front of and behind the camera. The problem is by no means limited to the media world. We see a shocking lack of women and people of color in boardrooms across all sectors. But why we are here focusing specifically on media is the outsized power that film and television have in shaping our culture and, even more fundamentally, our views about what doctors look like, what lawyers look like, what a fairytale princess or a superhero looks like. And yes, what criminals look like. Mr. Olmos, I can't help but feel that you have been sounding the alarm on criminal justice reform, and especially the intersection of criminal justice reform and minority representation, for decades, and it is finally getting the attention that it deserves. And as a long-time activist on criminal justice reform issues and building off your work, what are some of the societal changes that are leading to the disproportionate numbers of minorities in our criminal justice system, our jails and our prisons? Mr. Olmos. Education. Education and understanding of our communities as to what causes this action to happen. Now, basically, we are all able to understand that there are a lot of people in jail, but why is it so disproportionate? Why is that happening? That's always been said, and it is not the answer that illuminates. It's the question. And the question always is, is that people have a really difficult time with people of color. They won't do the things that they will do for non-people of color. They won't educate them. They won't allow them the right to vote even. We have the right to vote, and yet we're getting slammed right now in the minority areas, the whole situation with the President of the United States' standing of using mail-in ballots. We have a difficulty in criminal law. We have a difficulty in the way that they use criminal law. The way we use criminal law is different for the colored people versus the white people. And I got to tell you right now, it's a disaster. Mr. Deutch. Thank you, Mr. Olmos. Thanks to our witnesses, and thank you, Madam Chairman. I yield back. Ms. Scanlon. The chair recognizes Mr. Jordan for 5 minutes. Mr. Jordan. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Whitlock, do we have a functioning First Amendment when 62 percent of Americans feel like they can't express themselves freely? Mr. Whitlock. Absolutely not. And I appreciate you not asking me to make a negative comment about President Trump, who's not a part of the media. You guys called a meeting to discuss the media, and somehow--you should have just asked us to prerecord negative comments about President Trump, and then we could actually talk about the topic you've asked our time to speak about, the media. I'm sorry, Mr. Jordan. Go ahead. Mr. Jordan. No, no, no. Well said. Do you have free speech rights when only one side is allowed to talk, which is exactly what the cancel culture mob is doing today? Mr. Whitlock. Absolutely not. I'm going to go on another rant. I would wish we could talk about big tech's takeover of free speech. Mr. Jordan. Yep. Mr. Whitlock. Silicon Valley is in control of America. It's in control of the American media. There's only one strain of thought allowed. If you do not agree with Silicon Valley and Northern California's radical point of view, they will cancel you and silence you on their social media apps and in any other way possible try to smear your character. I've been through the whole cancel culture thing driven by Silicon Valley and the political activists on the left. This whole thing, I got to be honest with you, Mr. Jordan, I'm glad you invited me. But it's frustrating. My parents have always been mad at me because, to be quite honest, I refuse to vote. I don't like politicians. I just--and this experience I'm witnessing here today, people grandstanding and trying to make comments about Trump and whatever, when we're here to talk about the media, it pisses me off. It's a clown's--what is my tax dollars going for? Are we here to conduct business and get at real issues, or are we here to just put out a commercial about--an anti-Trump commercial? I don't want any part. I don't participate in any of this presidential politics. I didn't have anything negative to say about Barack Obama. I don't got anything negative to say about President Trump. Let's talk about the media, and too many of you guys are on the payroll of big tech. Mr. Jordan. Let me ask you this. And you reference it in those comments. Ms. Weiss--and I represented in my opening statement that Bari Weiss in the New York Times talked about the digital thunderdome. If you attempt--so most of Americans are afraid to do it, but if you step out and speak out against ``the mob,'' you think that is the appropriate term, this term that she used, ``digital thunderdome''? And if so, have you ever been in the thunderdome? I think you alluded to that. Mr. Whitlock. I'm in it virtually every day, and Bari Weiss was 1,000 percent correct. She called Twitter the editor for the New York Times. And Twitter is the editor for the American media, and Twitter is a rigged algorithm that imposes a worldview that is anti-American, anti-religion, anti the values that we were founded in, anti the values that got us--that made this country the ideal human experiment that all these people ranting and raving and complaining about America, you couldn't get them to leave America with a stick of dynamite and $1 million in cash. They would not leave. They all allege they hate America, and America, well, it's the greatest human experiment we've ever had. Mr. Jordan. Yes. Well said. Mr. Whitlock. Is it perfect? Absolutely not. But just--ah, thanks for inviting me. Mr. Jordan. Let me ask you this, and I want to ask Ms. Villa this as well. Will the cancel culture mobs just stop with conservatives and Republicans, or will they come after Democrats at some point, too? Ms. Villa, and then we will go back to Mr. Whitlock if we have time. Ms. Villa. Absolutely. And I'd like to say Ronda Kennedy is my counsel here. She's a black woman, mother of six. And cancel culture is an infection. They're going after everybody. They're going after Democrats. They're going after longstanding celebrities, black, Latino. It doesn't matter. Cancel culture is a virus that is attacking every single facet. And I've heard a lot of bashing of the President here. I want to, you know, join along with Mr. Whitlock. Why can't we stay on the topic? Why can't we talk about diversity in media rather than insulting the President? If you can't have one subject where you talk about diversity in media, when you have a black woman and Latina woman right here in front of you and all this diversity behind us, and you still have to talk about the President, it's sad. It's pathetic. It's embarrassing, quite honestly. And I am proud to be here and say that this President has perpetrated more diversity than any other President. He's been the most pro-black President, the FIRST STEP Act. You want to talk about disproportionate black and brown people, and you want to talk about in criminal justice reform. Not one Democrat has done anything for criminal justice reform. You want to talk about Joe Biden's character, but I'm not going to bring that up. I'm going to go back to what we're talking about here and representation in media matters, but we must have diversity of thought. Big tech needs to be held accountable. The big studios need to be held accountable, and every single celebrity that wants to talk about only what they're doing is ignoring the fact that Black Lives Matter in the name of diversity is saying black lives only matter, and they're killing police officers every day. That is not diversity. That's violence. Mr. Jordan. Ms. Villa, Mr. Whitlock, there were four Members of Congress shadowbanned by Twitter two summers ago. Any guess as to whether they were four Republicans? Of the same party, you think they were Republicans or Democrats? Ms. Villa. Republicans. Mr. Jordan. Yes. [Laughter.] Gaetz, Meadows, Nunes, Jordan. We know, as Mr. Whitlock said, big tech is out to get conservatives. That is why we need to be looking at Section 230, how we fix that, make sure that the platform is, in fact, neutral and not censoring people. When Twitter can let the Ayatollah of Iran put out a statement, say they will strike a blow against American citizens, and that is fine. But then they will censor the President's tweets, I think it proves Mr. Whitlock's point. I yield back, and I apologize to our witnesses. I have to run to another vote, and we are back and forth. But I will be back. Chairman Nadler [presiding]. The gentleman yields back. I will yield myself a chance to ask questions. First of all, for Mr. Olmos, it is, of course, not universal and strides have surely been made, but it still appears that actors who are either women or people of color are too often given only supporting roles or token roles with few lines and little character development on film and TV. We want to see less of that and more leading roles. How do you think we can break down the barriers that people of color face so that actors from underrepresented groups can take center stage just as often as white male actors? Mr. Olmos. Well, first of all and foremost, the industry has to really want to do stories about minorities. Indigenous people deserve their stories being told, and we should see them, and we'd love them. And they could be commercial. African Americans are doing a great job. Latinos, who are 20-something percent of the population, were less than 4 percent of the people who we see on screen. All I can say is it's up to us. That's why we did and why we're doing the educational system. We are doing YCP for a reason. We are really training the future. Now in 10 or 15 years, you're going to see a huge difference because the quality of the storytellers will be diverse. We're not only doing this for Latino children, these are all the children in California that are in the system right now that are getting this. They're so fortunate to be able to do this because it builds their self-esteem, self-respect, and their self-worth and makes them collaborate, communicate, use their critical thinking and creativity. And that, to me, is the essence of how one becomes all that they can be. And I say to you and all of us, let the children get educated. Chairman Nadler. And Ms. Temple, it is good to see you again in your new role. What change can we expect to see from studios in the next 5 years to improve diversity, do you think? Ms. Temple. Well, I think what you will see is an expansion of the positive gains that we've talked about a little bit in terms of representation both in front of and behind the camera. As I mentioned earlier in my opening remarks, there have been gains. Even the Hollywood Diversity Report noted that there were gains in some of the major areas that they had looked at in terms of, you know, film roles, film directors, and others participating in the industry. So those are all positive steps. Obviously, as I said earlier, those gains are not enough, and more needs to be done. I think you will see an expansion because, again, I think that this is obviously a long-term process, and there are number of programs and initiatives that I've talked about that really did just get started over the last few years. So I think as those programs and initiatives at every single one of our companies, our member studios, has those types of programs, as those programs continue to grow and expand, I think that you will see increased numbers of representation both in front of and behind the camera. And we recognize that there have been, you know, somewhat broader gains in front of the camera than behind the camera, and you need both. And so I think you will actually see that commitment continue and expanding and really, hopefully, the numbers expanding as well. Chairman Nadler. Thank you. Now we are currently in the midst of a pandemic and recession that are disproportionately impacting people of color, especially black and Latino people. Economic inequality has long disproportionately impacted people of color. This recession could further exacerbate it. The pandemic offers television and film production companies an opportunity to reset and reassess what shows or films continue in the development pipeline. Let me ask you, Mr. Kim, what are concrete steps the industry can take to ensure that the content pipeline includes shows and films that will employ people of color in front of and behind the camera? Mr. Kim. Thanks for the question. It's a good one. I think it's a multi-pronged approach. You know, I happen to be the executive producer of a show called ``The Good Doctor'' on ABC, and I can tell you that one of the things that the network is actually doing is setting an aggressive set of goals for diversity in front of and behind the camera. Obviously, these kinds of goals are not specifically mandates, and they require time for them to be implemented. But I think it's important. I think it's important that those goals exist from the most powerful places, the distributors. I think it's also important that content creators are very aware of the kinds of projects that we are making, with an eye toward representing the world we'd like to see. And I also think what's really important is to create a pipeline of writers, actors, and directors the way that Mr. Olmos is doing to foster the next generation of people who will be sitting in those seats of power. So it's a number of different things. And COVID in some ways has accelerated trends that are already existing in the industry, such as the trend towards streaming and the trend towards different kinds of storytelling. So it's important to listen to what's going on in society as well as trying---- Chairman Nadler. Well, thank you. Ms. Alexander, can you add anything to that as to what concrete steps the industry can take? Ms. Alexander. Yes, sir. I think that we need to make sure that the power of the purse to make production companies more racially diverse and their teams should be used, and we should definitely work on training programs. Training programs, and also there are very few people who are on these teams that are able to have hiring authority. So to make sure that we can get writers and directors and producers and casting directors that usually have that type of power and empowered. Thank you. Chairman Nadler. Thank you. Mr. Cicilline. Mr. Cicilline. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to first thank my friend and colleague from Florida, Mr. Deutch, for raising a very important issue that I think everyone has a responsibility to speak to directly. The President yesterday refused to say that he would accept the results of the election if he lost and accept a peaceful transfer of power. And worse than that, he said the problem is ballots. Oh, too many ballots. Of course, ballots and the right to vote are the cornerstone of our democracy and the most powerful expression of that democracy, and it was a sad day to hear the President say that he would not accept a peaceful transition of power. The problem is people are going to vote and to hear so much silence on the other side of the aisle. I also want to say that before I get to my first question I think the truth matters. Mr. Whitlock said, oh, Black Lives Matter has on its website it is a Marxist organization. So let me be clear. Black Lives Matter--and I am reading from the website--was founded in 2013 in response to the acquittal of Trayvon Martin's murderer. It is an organization whose mission is to eradicate white supremacy and build local power to intervene in violence inflicted on black communities. So it is very clear. That is not Marxist ideology. That, I hope, is American ideology. That is to stand up against white supremacy and to empower communities. So my first question is, Dr. Smith, you have done an enormous amount of research about the importance of people seeing themselves in characters both on the small and big screen. Why is that important? And your research that I have reviewed in your written testimony shows that disproportionately communities of color, particularly blacks and Latinos, are depicted, the number-one category is criminal. And what is the impact of that? Ms. Smith. Well, I think the research is really clear. Particularly when individuals lack direct experience, the media can play a notable role in shaping attitudes, perceptions, and beliefs about different groups. There's decades of research to show that the mass media can play an independent or interactive role when it comes to media effects, and when it comes identity, it can shape a whole series of different outcomes. And I believe it was Mr. Olmos who referred to self-esteem being one of the key indicators. I want to take this moment to illustrate that while a lot of the ideas and commentary here are very interesting to listen to, the decision-making capabilities of who to hire in Hollywood has prevented for decades women, people of color, member of the LGBTQ community, and people with disabilities from access and opportunity onscreen and behind the camera. The pipeline is there. The pipeline is there. We need resources to fund motion pictures and content for people of color behind the camera to tell their stories. Because if they are simply given the opportunity to tell their stories like their white male counterparts, the stories will be there, and people will see themselves reflected in nuanced, authentic, and compelling ways. But we don't see that. We know that people are submitting to the Sundance Film Festivals from a whole series of different backgrounds. Please fund the Sundance Institute to make sure that those storytellers, because there's a relationship between promoting your film at Sundance and having a film that's a top- grossing 100 motion picture---- Mr. Cicilline. Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Smith. I want to try to get in one more question, but thank you, Dr. Smith. Mr. Dae Kim, thank you for changing your mind and agreeing to testify. Your testimony was compelling and important, and I, too, was deeply saddened by the fact that that vote against that resolution was not unanimous. And it just evidences that we have a lot of work to do. What I would like to ask you to address is what can we do and what can we incentivize within your industry to help ensure that there is better representation in front of the camera and behind the camera for communities of color, women, LGBTQ individuals, indigenous people? Because we understand from the research what the absence of their representation means not just for those communities, but for the entire country and the world. Mr. Kim. So when you say ``we,'' thank you, Representative. Mr. Cicilline. Congress. Congress and you in the industry. Mr. Kim. You and me. No, I think it's a great question because one thing I don't want to dismiss is this idea of being excellent at your craft. And you know, one of the things about diversity is that no one is asking to give opportunities that are not earned. And so, you know, we talk about ways that the system can help increase diversity, but what's also important is the way that we can help ourselves. We must be the best we can be at what we choose to do, whether it's acting, writing, and directing--anything in the arts. And I think the way that Congress can help us is, one, through hearings such as this because I think it's important to hear the perspectives of people like everyone on this panel, you know, both left and right. And I think what--what--I t"
