        "text": "I. OVERVIEW\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, protects applicants and employees from employment discrimination based on their race, color, religion, sex, national origin, opposition to practices made unlawful by Title VII, or participation in Title VII proceedings.[1] Title VII's protection against national origin discrimination extends to all employees and applicants for employment[2] in the United States,[3] and, in some circumstances, to U.S. citizens working in other countries.[4] In enacting this protection, Congress recognized that whether an individual (or her ancestors) is from China, Russia, or Nigeria, or belongs to an ethnic group, such as Hispanic or Arab,[5] she is entitled to be free from employment discrimination on that basis.\n\nThe American workforce is increasingly ethnically diverse.[6] The largest percentages of immigrants to the United States are now from Asia and Latin America,[7] which extends a recent trend.[8] Immigration from Africa and the Caribbean countries also continues to enhance diversity among Black Americans.[9]\n\nImmigrant workers are present in every occupation in the United States, and they are highly-represented in many of the largest-growth occupations.[10] Twenty-five percent of foreign-born workers aged 16 and older work in service occupations.[11] In the near future, second- and third-generation descendants of at least one foreign-born parent are expected to enter the workforce in increasing numbers.[12]\n\nThis document sets forth the Commission's interpretation of the law of national origin discrimination. In crafting this guidance, the Commission analyzed how courts have interpreted and applied the law to specific facts. Regarding many national origin discrimination issues, the lower courts are uniform in their interpretations of the relevant statutes. This guidance explains the law on such issues with concrete examples, where the Commission agrees with those interpretations. Where the lower courts have not consistently applied the law or the EEOC's interpretation of the law differs in some respect, this guidance sets forth the EEOC's considered position and explains its analysis. The positions explained below represent the Commission's well-considered guidance on its interpretation of the laws it enforces. This document serves as a reference for staff of the Commission and other federal agencies who investigate, adjudicate, litigate, or conduct outreach on national origin discrimination under Title VII.[13] It will also be useful for employers, employees, and practitioners seeking detailed information about the EEOC's position on national origin discrimination, and for employers seeking \"promising practices.\"[14] This Enforcement Guidance supersedes EEOC Compliance Manual, Vol. II, Section 13: National Origin Discrimination.\n\nII. WHAT IS \"NATIONAL ORIGIN\" DISCRIMINATION?\n\nGenerally, national origin discrimination means discrimination because an individual (or his or her ancestors) is from a certain place or has the physical, cultural, or linguistic characteristics of a particular national origin group.[15] Title VII prohibits employer actions that have the purpose or effect of discriminating against persons because of their real or perceived national origin.[16] National origin discrimination includes discrimination by a member of one national origin group against a member of the same group.[17]\n\nA. Employment Discrimination Based on Place of Origin\n\nNational origin discrimination includes discrimination \"because of an individual's, or his or her ancestor's, place of origin[].\"[18] The place of origin may be a country (e.g., Mexico, China, Syria) or a former country (e.g., Yugoslavia).[19] The place of origin may be the United States.[20] Finally, it may be a geographic region, including a region that never was a country but nevertheless is closely associated with a particular national origin group, for example, Kurdistan or Acadia.[21]\n\nB. Employment Discrimination Based on National Origin Group or Ethnicity\n\nTitle VII also prohibits employment discrimination against individuals because of their national origin group. A \"national origin group,\" or an \"ethnic group,\" is a group of people sharing a common language, culture, ancestry, race, and/or other social characteristics.[22] Hispanics, Arabs, and Roma are ethnic or national origin groups.[23]\n\nEmployment discrimination against members of a national origin group includes discrimination based on:\n\nEthnicity: Employment discrimination because of a person's ethnicity as defined above, for example, discrimination against someone because he is Hispanic.[24] National origin discrimination also includes discrimination against a person because she does not belong to a particular ethnic group, such as less favorable treatment of employees who are not Hispanic.\n\nPhysical, linguistic, or cultural traits: Employment discrimination against an individual because she has physical, linguistic, and/or cultural characteristics closely associated with a national origin group.[25] For example, subjecting an individual to an adverse employment action because of her African-sounding accent or traditional African style of dress could constitute discrimination based on African origin.[26]\n\nEmployment discrimination based on place of origin or national origin (ethnic) group includes discrimination involving:\n\nPerception: Employment discrimination based on the belief that an individual (or her ancestors) is from one or more particular countries, or belongs to one or more particular national origin groups. For example, Title VII prohibits employment discrimination based on the perception that someone is from the Middle East or is of Arab ethnicity, regardless of how she identifies herself or whether she is, in fact, from one or more Middle Eastern countries or ethnically Arab.[27]\n\nAssociation: Employment discrimination against an individual because of his association with someone of a particular national origin. For example, it is unlawful to discriminate against a person because he is married to or has a child with someone of a different national origin or ethnicity.[28]\n\nCitizenship status: Employment discrimination based on citizenship status if it has the purpose or effect of discriminating based on national origin.[29]\n\nFinally, the Commission's position is that employment discrimination because an individual is Native American or a member of a particular tribe also is based on national origin.[30]\n\nC. National Origin Discrimination That Overlaps or Intersects with Other Title VII Protected Bases\n\n1. Multiple Protected Bases\n\nNational origin discrimination often overlaps with race, color, or religious discrimination because a national origin group may be associated or perceived to be associated with a particular religion or race.[31] For example, charges filed by Asian Americans may involve allegations of discrimination motivated by both race and ancestry (national origin).[32] Similarly, discrimination against people with origins in the Middle East may be motivated by race, national origin, or even the perception that they follow particular religious practices.[33] As a result, the same set of facts may state claims alleging multiple bases of discrimination.\n\n2. Intersectional Discrimination\n\nTitle VII also prohibits \"intersectional\" discrimination, which occurs when someone is discriminated against because of the combination of two or more protected bases (e.g. national origin and race). \"Some characteristics, such as race, color, and national origin, often fuse inextricably. . . . Title VII prohibits employment discrimination based on any of the named characteristics, whether individually or in combination.\"[35] Because intersectional discrimination targets a specific subgroup of individuals, Title VII prohibits, for example, discrimination against Asian women even if the employer has not also discriminated against Asian men or non-Asian women.[36]\n\nEmployment discrimination motivated by a stereotype about two or more protected traits would constitute intersectional discrimination. Thus, a stereotype about Hispanic women would apply only to Hispanic women;[37] it would not apply to either Hispanic men or non-Hispanic women.\n\nD. Employment Discrimination and Human Trafficking\n\nWhen force, fraud, or coercion is used to compel labor or exploit workers, traffickers and employers may be violating not only criminal laws,[38] but also Title VII. In particular, Title VII may apply in trafficking cases if an employer's conduct is directed at an individual and/or group of individuals based on a protected category, such as national origin.\n\nEven if employees are legally brought into the United States, discrimination on the basis of national origin may occur through the use of force, fraud, or coercion. In trafficking cases, it is not unusual for employers to subject trafficked workers to harassment, job segregation, unequal pay, or unreasonable paycheck deductions, all of which are discriminatory if motivated by Title VII-protected status.[39] Trafficking cases may involve multiple or intersecting bases of discrimination, such as national origin and sex. They often also involve retaliation for protected activity.[40]\n\nIII. EMPLOYMENT DECISIONS\n\nEmployment decisions that are challenged as discriminatory based on national origin are subject to both disparate treatment and disparate impact analysis. Disparate treatment discrimination occurs when national origin (or another protected trait) is a motivating factor in an employment action.[42] Disparate impact discrimination occurs when a policy or practice has a significant negative impact on members of a Title VII-protected group but is not job related and consistent with business necessity.[43]\n\nTitle VII applies to all employment decisions, including those involving:\n\nRecruitment\n\nHiring\n\nPromotion\n\nWork assignments\n\nSegregation and classification\n\nTransfer\n\nWages and benefits\n\nLeave\n\nTraining and apprenticeship programs\n\nDiscipline\n\nLayoff and termination\n\nOther terms and conditions of employment\n\nThe following subsections discuss the application of Title VII's bar on national origin discrimination to various types of employment decisions.\n\nA. Recruitment\n\nTitle VII prohibits employers from engaging in recruitment practices that have the purpose of discriminating based on national origin, as well as practices that disproportionately limit employment opportunities based on national origin and are not job related and consistent with business necessity. Thus, Title VII prohibits an employer from using certain recruitment practices, such as relying on word-of mouth advertising or sending job postings only to ethnically or racially homogenous areas or audiences, if the practices have the purpose or unjustified effect of excluding people based on national origin.[44] Practices aimed at increasing the overall diversity of the applicant pool, such as recruiting at minority-serving institutions, that do not exclude any particular national origin groups would not implicate Title VII's bar on national origin discrimination.\n\nEmployers may not request that an employment agency refer only applicants and/or employees who are of a particular national origin group. Similarly, because Title VII directly prohibits discrimination by employment agencies, they may not comply with discriminatory recruitment or referral requests from employers.[45] For example, a placement agency may not honor a client request to recruit only Latino workers.\n\nStaffing firms, including temporary agencies and long-term contract firms, also are covered as employers by Title VII when each has the statutory minimum number of employees and has the right to exercise control over the means and manner of a worker's employment (regardless of whether they actually exercise that right).[46] If both a staffing firm and its client employer have the right to control the worker's employment and have the statutory minimum number of employees, then they would be covered as \"joint employers.\" Thus, if a temporary agency learns that one of its employees was involuntarily transferred by a client employer from a position that involves public contact to a lower-paying position without public contact because of stereotypes about her national origin, the agency will be liable if it fails to take prompt corrective action within its control. Corrective action would include, for example, insisting that the client return the employee to the former position. If the client refuses, the agency could take corrective action by offering to assign the worker to another client at the same rate of pay, and declining to assign other employees to the same worksite unless the client changes its discriminatory practices.[47]\n\nB. Hiring, Promotion, and Assignment\n\nTitle VII prohibits hiring discrimination based on national origin.[50] Employers must not treat candidates differently during the hiring process based on their national origin. Employers also must not use selection criteria that have a significant discriminatory effect without being able to prove that the criteria are job related and consistent with business necessity.\n\nAdditionally, employers may not limit assignments and promotional opportunities based on national origin.[51]\n\n1. Discriminatory Customer Preference\n\nEmployers may not rely on the discriminatory preferences of coworkers, customers, or clients as the basis for adverse employment actions in violation of Title VII.[52] An employment decision based on the discriminatory preferences of others is itself discriminatory. For example, a specific \"corporate look\" or \"image\" policy may serve as a proxy for discriminatory customer preference or prejudice, and, accordingly, would not justify hiring, assignment, or promotion decisions that treat individuals in a disparate manner based on their national origin.[53]\n\n2. Job Segregation\n\nTitle VII prohibits employers from assigning or refusing to assign individuals to certain positions, facilities, or geographic areas; denying promotions; physically isolating employees; or otherwise segregating workers into jobs based on their national origin.[54] For example, a retailer may not require all Filipino employees to work in lower-paying stocking jobs away from public contact because of an actual or assumed customer preference for non-Filipino sales representatives.[55]\n\n3. Security Requirements and Screening\n\nIn limited circumstances, employers may justify their employment selection decisions with reference to national security requirements. Title VII provides employers with a defense against a complaint or charge of discrimination for refusal to hire, refusal to refer, or termination where an individual does not meet job requirements that are \"imposed in the interest of the national security of the United States under any security program in effect pursuant to or administered under\" any federal statute or Executive Order.[56] Additionally, the Commission may not review the substance of an Executive Branch security clearance determination or the federally imposed security clearance requirement itself, even if it is allegedly based on national origin or another characteristic protected under equal employment opportunity (EEO) law.[57]\n\nCommission review of claims involving national security clearances may nonetheless be appropriate where the Commission can resolve the matter without considering the merits of a security clearance decision. For instance, the Commission may review whether the grant, denial, or revocation of a security clearance was conducted in a discriminatory manner,[58] and whether procedural requirements for making security clearance determinations were followed without regard to an individual's protected status.[59]\n\n4. Social Security Numbers\n\nThrough the Form I-9 process, employers must verify the identity and employment eligibility of newly hired employees.[60] After completing the Form I-9 process, some employers also use the electronic federal E-Verify system, which compares information on the employee's Form I-9 to information in government databases, to verify identity and employment eligibility.[61] Employees are permitted to choose which documents to select for employment eligibility verification purposes.[62] Some employees may choose to present an unrestricted Social Security card to prove employment eligibility.[63] Other work-authorized employees may, however, decide not to present a Social Security card for a variety of reasons, including because they have misplaced it or have not yet received a Social Security number. According to both the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the SSA, newly hired employees should be allowed to work if they have applied for but not yet received a Social Security number.[64]\n\nA policy or practice of screening out new hires or candidates who lack a Social Security number implicates Title VII if it disproportionately screens out work-authorized individuals of a certain national origin, such as newly arrived immigrants or new lawful permanent residents, and thus has a disparate impact based on national origin. If a new hire or applicant shows that such a policy or practice has a disparate impact based on her national origin, its use is unlawful under Title VII unless the employer establishes that the policy or practice is job related and consistent with business necessity.[65]\n\nC. Discipline, Demotion, and Discharge\n\nAs with other employment decisions, a decision to discipline, demote, or discharge an employee may not be based on his or her national origin.[66] Rules and policies regarding discipline, demotion, and discharge also must be nondiscriminatory and enforced without regard to national origin.\n\nEmployer decisions to discipline or discharge employees must be based on nondiscriminatory reasons, such as their quality or quantity of work, rather than national origin, race, or other prohibited factors.[67]\n\nCustomer or client ethnic prejudices or preferences do not justify discriminatory discipline, demotion, or discharge decisions.\n\nD. Mixed Motives in Employment Decisions\n\nEmployment decisions that are motivated by both national origin discrimination and nondiscriminatory reasons violate Title VII.[69] However, remedies in such \"mixed motives\" cases are limited if the employer shows that it would have taken the same action even if it had not relied on national origin.[70] Once the plaintiff demonstrates that national origin played a role in the challenged action, the employer then demonstrates that it would have taken the same employment action based on another, nondiscriminatory factor; a mere assertion to this effect is not enough. If the employer makes this showing, the charging party may receive declaratory and injunctive relief, attorney's fees, and costs, but is not entitled to reinstatement, back pay, or compensatory or punitive damages.[71]\n\nIV. HARASSMENT\n\nIn fiscal year 2015, approximately 37 percent of all charges of discrimination filed alleging national origin discrimination in the private and state/local government sectors included a harassment claim.[72] The subsections below summarize Title VII's prohibition against national origin harassment.\n\nA. Title VII's Prohibition Against a Hostile Work Environment Based on National Origin\n\nTitle VII prohibits national origin harassment when it is so severe or pervasive that it \"alter[s] the conditions of the individual's employment\" by creating a hostile or abusive work environment.[73] The harassment is unlawful if the individual subjectively perceives the work environment as hostile, and a reasonable person would find it to be hostile or abusive.[74]\n\nA hostile work environment based on national origin can take different forms, including ethnic slurs, ridicule, intimidation, workplace graffiti, physical violence, or other offensive conduct directed toward an individual because of his birthplace, ethnicity, culture, language, dress, or foreign accent.[75] A hostile work environment may be created by the actions of supervisors, employees, or non-employees, such as customers or commercial contacts.[76]\n\nWhether an individual was subjected to a hostile work environment depends on the totality of the circumstances. Relevant questions in evaluating whether national origin harassment rises to the level of creating a hostile work environment may include any of the following:\n\nWhether the conduct was hostile and/or offensive;\n\nWhether the conduct was physically threatening or intimidating;\n\nHow frequently the conduct was repeated; or\n\nThe context in which the harassment occurred.\n\nThe following examples illustrate the distinction between an unlawful hostile work environment and offensive conduct that is not sufficiently severe or pervasive to violate Title VII:\n\nLanguage restrictive policies (including English-only rules, see infra section V.C.) may contribute to a hostile work environment.[79]\n\nB. Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment\n\nEmployers and employees each play an essential role in preventing national origin harassment. When employers and employees both take appropriate steps to prevent and correct offensive conduct, it is much less likely to escalate to the point of violating Title VII. The standard for employer liability for harassment depends on the role of the harasser in the employer's organization.[82]\n\n1. Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors\n\nWhen a supervisor[83] engages in harassment that includes a tangible employment action imposing \"a significant change in employment status,\" such as discharge, demotion, or refusal to promote, the employer is liable and does not have a defense.[84] The Supreme Court explained that \"[w]hen a supervisor makes a tangible employment decision, there is assurance the injury could not have been inflicted absent the agency relation\" with the employer.[85] For example, if a supervisor created a hostile work environment for an Arab employee by repeatedly accusing her of being a \"terrorist,\" and then terminated her employment because of her race and ethnicity, the employer would be liable for unlawful harassment as well as discriminatory discharge.[86]\n\nWhen national origin harassment by a supervisor creates a hostile work environment but does not result in a tangible employment action, the employer will be liable for the supervisor's conduct unless it can show the following:\n\nThe employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any harassing behavior, and\n\nThe employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.[87]\n\n2. Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Employees or Non-Employees\n\nAn employer is liable when non-supervisory employees or non-employees create a hostile work environment if the employer knew or should have known about the harassment and failed to take immediate and appropriate corrective action.[88]\n\nC. Human Trafficking\n\nCases involving human trafficking often include employer conduct that constitutes unlawful harassment, such as sexual, national origin, or racial harassment.[89] Given the nature of compelled labor, the work environment may reasonably and necessarily be perceived as hostile. The egregious employer conduct in human trafficking cases usually will also easily satisfy the requirements for employer liability for unlawful harassment. However, the specific conduct at issue in a particular human trafficking case will be relevant to determining appropriate relief.\n\nV. LANGUAGE ISSUES\n\nAs the U.S. labor force has grown more ethnically diverse, the number of workers who are not native English speakers has increased. Between 2010 and 2014, an average of 20.9 percent of the population spoke a language other than English at home.[90] This represents an increase from 17.9 percent in 2000 and 13.8 percent in 1990.[91]\n\nEmployers may have legitimate business reasons for basing employment decisions on linguistic characteristics. However, because linguistic characteristics are closely associated with national origin, it is important to carefully scrutinize employment decisions that are based on language to ensure that they do not violate Title VII.[92] The subsections below provide guidance on how Title VII applies to employment decisions that are based on accent, English fluency, and restrictive workplace language policies.\n\nA. Accent Discrimination\n\nAn accent can reflect whether a person lived in a different country or grew up speaking a language other than English.[93] National origin and accent are therefore intertwined,[94] and employment decisions or harassment based on accent may violate Title VII.[95] Due to the link between accent and national origin, courts take a \"very searching look\" at an employer's reasons for using accent as a basis for an adverse employment decision.[96] Courts require employers to provide evidence - as opposed to unsupported assertions - to explain such actions.\n\nUnder Title VII, an employment decision may legitimately be based on an individual's accent if the accent \"interferes materially with job performance.\"[97] To meet this standard, an employer must provide evidence showing that: (1) effective spoken communication in English is required to perform job duties; and (2) the individual's accent materially interferes with his or her ability to communicate in spoken English.[98]\n\nWhere the evidence shows that an individual has a good command of spoken English or satisfactorily performs his job when speaking accented English, courts have ruled against employers under Title VII.[99]\n\nIn assessing whether an individual's accent materially interferes with the ability to perform job duties, the key is to distinguish a merely discernible accent from one that actually interferes with the spoken communication skills necessary for the job.[101] Evidence of an accent materially interfering with job duties may include documented workplace mistakes attributable to difficulty understanding the individual; assessments from several credible sources who are familiar with the individual and the job; or specific substandard job performance that is linked to failures in spoken communication.[102]\n\nExample 23\n\nNo National Origin Discrimination Involving Accent:\n\nAccent Materially Interferes with Job Performance\n\nDiscount Airline needs to hire a customer service agent at a major metropolitan airport to provide in-person assistance for passengers who have missed their connections or whose flights have been cancelled or delayed. This position requires short but effective spoken communication in a noisy environment with a disgruntled public. Romel, who speaks English with a pronounced Filipino accent, applies for the position and is invited for an interview. The interviewing process includes a job simulation during which the applicant responds to customers in an atmosphere that mimics that of a busy airport. Two experienced interviewers who understand the demands of this job are impressed by Romel's calm demeanor and commitment to problem-solving, but they have difficulty understanding Romel's spoken English during the interview process. The interviewers conclude that Romel's pronounced Filipino accent will materially interfere with effective spoken communication in this environment. As a result, Romel is not hired. Romel challenges his rejection as national origin discrimination involving his accent. The EEOC does not find reasonable cause to believe that Romel was subjected to national origin discrimination because effective oral communication is required for this position, and Romel's accent materially interferes with his ability to communicate effectively in the circumstances of this job.\n\nIf an employer takes an employment action in response to the discriminatory preferences of others, the employer itself is discriminating. Employers may not rely on coworker, customer, or client discomfort or preference to justify a discriminatory employment action based on accent.[104]\n\nB. Fluency Requirements\n\n1. English Fluency\n\nGenerally, an English fluency or English proficiency requirement is permissible only if required for the effective performance of the position for which it is imposed.[105] An individual's lack of fluency in English may interfere with job performance in some circumstances, but not in others. For example, an individual may be sufficiently proficient in English to qualify as a research assistant but, at that point in time, may lack the fluency to qualify as a senior scientific writer who must communicate complex scientific information in English.[106]\n\nBecause the degree of fluency that may be lawfully required varies from one position to the next, employers are advised to assess the level of fluency required for a job on a case-by-case basis. Applying uniform fluency requirements to a broad range of dissimilar positions or requiring a greater degree of fluency than is necessary for a position may result in a violation of Title VII.\n\n2. Fluency in Languages Other Than English\n\nWith American society growing more diverse, employers have increasingly required some employees to be fluent in languages other than English. As with English fluency requirements, requiring fluency in a language other than English is only permissible if it is required for the effective performance of the position for which it is imposed.[107] For example, a business that provides services to numerous Spanish-speaking customers may have a sound business reason for requiring that some of its employees speak Spanish.\n\nA business with a diverse clientele may assign work based on an employee's ability to speak a language other than English. For example, an employer may assign bilingual Spanish-speaking employees to provide services to customers who speak Spanish, while assigning employees who only speak English to provide services to English-speaking customers. Additionally, employers are not required by Title VII to provide additional compensation for work that is performed in a language other than English, provided the employers do not require employees to work extra hours without compensation.[108]\n\nC. English-Only Rules and Other Restrictive Language Policies\n\nRestrictive language policies or practices requiring the use of the English language at work are commonly known as English-only rules. These policies or practices may also involve languages other than English, for example, Spanish-only policies. Restrictive language policies implicate national origin because an individual's primary language is closely tied to his or her cultural and ethnic identity.[110]\n\n1. Policies Adopted for Discriminatory Reasons\n\nAs with other workplace policies, a restrictive language policy violates Title VII if it is adopted for discriminatory reasons, such as bias against employees of a particular national origin.[111] Thus, it would be unlawful disparate treatment to implement an English-only rule in order to avoid hearing foreign languages in the workplace, to generate a reason to discipline or terminate people who are not native English speakers, or to create a hostile work environment for certain non-English speaking workers.\n\nEvidence of disparate treatment includes failure to consider whether there are substantial business reasons for the policy. The weaker the business reasons, the more difficult it may be to justify the policy under Title VII.\n\n2. Policies Applied in a Discriminatory Manner\n\nRegardless of whether a restrictive language policy was adopted for nondiscriminatory reasons, the policy may not be applied differently to employees because of their national origin. For example, if six languages other than English are spoken in a workplace, it would be facially discriminatory to prohibit employees from speaking one of those languages but not the others, e.g., a \"no Russian rule,\" no matter the reason.[113] Title VII also prohibits an employer from enforcing a policy in a discriminatory manner, for example, imposing more severe discipline on Vietnamese employees who violate the policy than on Latino employees with comparable violations. Finally, penalizing employees for minor, inadvertent infractions that do not undermine workplace safety or efficiency may be evidence of intentional discrimination.[114]\n\n3. EEOC Guidelines on English-only Policies\n\nThe EEOC's long-standing English-only guidelines, issued in 1980, provide that rules requiring employees to speak English in the workplace at all times will be presumed to violate Title VII.[115]\n\na. Adverse Effect on National Origin Groups\n\nWhen an employer imposes an English-only rule, either in limited circumstances or at all times, employees with limited or no English skills and bilingual employees whose primary language is not English may be adversely affected because they are prohibited from communicating at work-including for work-related purposes -in their most effective language.[116] An English-only rule may also adversely impact these employees by subjecting them to discipline and termination for speaking their most effective language while imposing no comparable risk for native English-speaking employees.[117] Finally, an English-only rule \"is likely in itself to 'create an atmosphere of inferiority, isolation, and intimidation' that constitutes a 'discriminatory working environment.'\"[118]\n\nb. Policies That Apply at All Times\n\nA restrictive language policy is applied \"at all times\" when employees are prohibited from speaking their primary language any time they are on duty or in the workplace, including during lunch, breaks, and other personal time while on the employer's premises.\n\nBecause language-restrictive policies may be applied only to those specific employment situations for which they are needed to promote safe and efficient job performance or business operations, blanket rules requiring employees to speak English (or another language) at all times are presumptively unlawful.[119]\n\nc. Policies That Apply in Limited Circumstances\n\nThe lawfulness of a limited language-restrictive policy- one that does not apply at all times or to all jobs, workplace situations, or locations- depends on whether the evidence shows that the policy is job related and consistent with business necessity.[120] An employer may satisfy this standard by providing detailed, fact-specific, and credible evidence demonstrating that the business purpose of requiring employees to speak a common language is sufficiently necessary to safe and efficient job performance or safe and efficient business operations to override its adverse impact, and that it is narrowly tailored to minimize any discriminatory impact based on national origin.[121]\n\nd. Job Related and Consistent with Business Necessity\n\nBecause of the adverse effects of a restrictive language policy on employees with limited or no English skills, and on bilingual employees whose primary language is not English, such a policy is unlawful unless the employer establishes that the policy is job related and consistent with business necessity. It is not sufficient that the policy merely promote business convenience.[122]\n\nTo meet the burden of establishing business necessity, the employer must present detailed, fact-specific, and credible evidence[123] showing that the language-restrictive policy is \"necessary to safe and efficient job performance\"[124] or safe and efficient business operations.[125] This burden cannot be met with conclusory statements or bare assertions about the business need for a language-restrictive policy.[126] It is necessary to analyze the specific circumstances that are presented in each situation. The following general principles provide guidance when evaluating whether a language-restrictive policy is job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity.\n\n(1) Restrictive Language Policy Effectively Serves Business Needs\n\nPart of establishing business necessity is demonstrating that the language-restrictive policy actually serves the identified business need.[127] The effectiveness of a language-restrictive policy also may hinge on which language is identified as the common language of those performing the work. Sales representatives with monolingual clientele may generate the most sales by speaking the language in which the customer is proficient. Similarly, cooperative work assignments may be completed efficiently when employees use the language in which they are most proficient. If safety considerations constitute the demonstrated business need, employers may assess whether their employees with limited English skills are more likely to understand and relay safety instructions or warnings efficiently and effectively in English or in their shared language.[128]\n\n(2) Restrictive Language Policy is Narrowly Tailored\n\nA language-restrictive policy is narrowly tailored when it applies only to those workers, work areas, circumstances, times, and job duties in which it is necessary to effectively promote safe and efficient business operations. This minimizes the adverse impact.\n\nSome employers contend they adopt language-restrictive policies in order to improve interpersonal relationships between employees.[130] If coworkers or customers are concerned about exposure to languages they do not understand, or about gossip in these languages, one approach is to address these concerns on an individualized basis without resorting to language-restrictive policies.[131] A language-restrictive policy that has a disparate impact on a particular group cannot be justified if an employer can effectively promote safe and efficient business operations through a policy that does not disproportionately harm protected national origin groups.\n\n4. Notice and Enforcement of Restrictive Language Policy\n\nEmployers must provide adequate notice of language-restrictive policies.[132] \"Adequate notice\" means effectively communicating to employees under what circumstances they will be required to speak a specific or common language and what will happen if they violate the rule.[133] Notice can be provided by any reasonable means under the circumstances, such as explaining the rule at a meeting, providing personal notice, sending e-mail, or posting the rule.[134] In some circumstances, it may be necessary to provide notice in multiple languages. A grace period before the effective date of the policy generally will be important. Because adequate notice is essential to ensure employee compliance with the policy, \"[i]f an employer fails to effectively notify its employees of the rule and makes an adverse employment decision against an individual based on a violation of the rule, the Commission will consider the employer's application of the rule as evidence of discrimination on the basis of national origin.\"[135]\n\nManagers often benefit from guidance on how to enforce the policy. Employers are strongly discouraged from \"draconian\"[136] enforcement of language-restrictive policies. By limiting disciplinary measures to willful violations and not penalizing workers for inadvertent violations linked to their protected status,[137] employers will more likely be able to establish business necessity.\n\nVI. CITIZENSHIP ISSUES\n\nA. U.S. Citizenship Requirements\n\nTitle VII is violated whenever citizenship discrimination has the \"purpose or effect\" of discriminating on the basis of national origin.[138] For example, a citizenship requirement would be unlawful if it is a \"pretext\" for national origin discrimination, or if it is part of a wider scheme of national origin discrimination.[139] Although Title VII applies regardless of immigration status or authorization to work, employers are prohibited by the immigration laws from hiring individuals who are not authorized to work.[140]\n\nFederal law requires U.S. citizenship for most federal civil service employment.[142] When U.S. citizenship is required by federal law, the failure to hire an individual because he or she is not a U.S. citizen does not constitute national origin discrimination in violation of Title VII.\n\nFederal law provides a variety of protections for employees and applicants for employment who are discriminated against based on their citizenship status, immigration status, or national origin. As a result, in addition to national origin claims under Title VII, individuals may have claims under federal statutes enforced by departments or agencies other than the EEOC:\n\nAnti-Discrimination Provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA): The anti-discrimination provision of the INA prohibits employers with four or more employees from discriminating because of citizenship or immigration status against U.S. citizens and certain classes of foreign nationals authorized to work in the United States with respect to hiring, firing, and recruitment or referral for a fee.[143] It also prohibits national origin discrimination with respect to hiring, firing, and recruitment or referral for a fee, by employers with more than four employees that are not covered by Title VII. Additionally, the INA prohibits unfair documentary practices, which include requests for more or different documents than are required to verify employment eligibility, rejections of reasonably genuine-looking documents, or requests for specific documents with the purpose or intent of discriminating on the basis of citizenship status or national origin.[144] The anti-discrimination provision of the INA is enforced by the Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices (OSC), Civil Rights Division, in the Department of Justice.[145]\n\nFair Labor Standards Act (FLSA): The FLSA requires, among other things, that covered workers, including those who are not U.S. citizens, be paid no less than the federally designated minimum wage. The FLSA is enforced by the Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor (DOL).[146]\n\nSpecial Visa Programs: Employment of foreign nationals under special visa programs, such as H-1B and H-2A visas, also may be subject to certain requirements related to wages, working conditions, or other aspects of employment.[147]\n\nB. Coverage of Foreign Nationals\n\nTitle VII prohibits discrimination against individuals in the United States[150] by covered employers, regardless of citizenship or work authorization.[151] A worker's immigration status is not relevant to the underlying merits of a discrimination charge.[152] The Commission takes the position that foreign nationals outside the United States are covered by the EEO statutes when they apply for U.S.-based employment.[153] However, if the employment is outside the United States, individuals who are not U.S. citizens are not protected by the EEO statutes.\n\nVII. RELATED ISSUES\n\nThe following subsections discuss issues related to Title VII's prohibition on national origin discrimination, including:\n\nRetaliation for opposing national origin discrimination or otherwise participating in protected activity.\n\nTitle VII's application to foreign employers in the United States and American employers in foreign countries .\n\nA. Retaliation\n\nTitle VII prohibits retaliation, or reprisal, against an individual because he or she has opposed unlawful national origin discrimination or participated in the EEO process by filing a charge or complaint, testifying, assisting, or participating in any manner in an employment discrimination investigation, proceeding, or hearing.[154]\n\nThere are three essential elements of a claim that an employer action was retaliatory:\n\nEmployee Protected Activity- opposition to discrimination or participation in any EEO investigation, proceeding, or hearing;\n\nMaterially Adverse Action- any adverse treatment by the employer (beyond a petty slight or a trivial annoyance), that might dissuade a reasonable person from participating in protected activity;[155] and\n\nCausal Connection- between the protected activity and the adverse treatment.[156]\n\nThe most obvious types of materially adverse actions are denial of promotion, refusal to hire, denial of job benefits, demotion, suspension, and discharge because the individual engaged in protected activity.[157] Other types of materially adverse actions include threats, warnings, reprimands,[158] transfers,[159] negative or lowered evaluations,[160] or verbal or physical abuse (whether or not it rises to the level of creating a hostile work environment) because an individual engaged in protected activity.\n\nSometimes an employer takes a materially adverse action in reprisal against an employee who engaged in protected activity by harming a third party who is closely related to or associated with the complaining employee.[162]\n\nB. Foreign Employers in the United States and American Employers in Foreign Countries\n\nThe following sections discuss how Title VII applies to foreign employers in the United States and American employers in foreign countries. With a few exceptions, foreign employers doing business in the United States are covered by Title VII to the same extent as American employers.[163] Similarly, American employers in foreign countries are generally covered by Title VII in the same manner as American employers located in the United States with respect to employees who are U.S. citizens.[164]\n\n1. Foreign Employers\n\nTitle VII applies to a foreign employer doing business in the United States to the same extent as an American employer,[165] unless the foreign employer is exempted from coverage by a treaty or international agreement. When permitted by treaty, a foreign employer may discriminate in favor of its own citizens.[166] Title VII does not apply to a foreign employer's actions in a foreign country, provided that the foreign employer is not controlled by an American employer.[167]\n\n2. American Employers in Foreign Countries\n\nTitle VII prohibits discrimination against U.S. citizens by American employers operating in foreign countries,[168] unless compliance with Title VII would cause an employer to violate the laws of the foreign country in which the workplace is located.[169] An employer operating in another country that is incorporated in the United States will generally have sufficient ties to the United States to be deemed an American employer.[170] If an employer is not incorporated in the United States or is not incorporated at all (e.g., it is a partnership), various factors will be considered to determine whether the employer has sufficient connections to the United States to make it an American employer. These factors include the employer's principal place of business, the nationality of dominant shareholders and/or those holding voting control, and the nationality and location of management.[171]\n\nTitle VII also prohibits discrimination against U.S. citizens abroad by a foreign employer that is controlled by an American employer.[172] The determination of whether an American employer controls a foreign employer is based on the interrelation of operations, common management, centralized control of labor relations, and common ownership or financial control of the American employer and the foreign employer.[173]\n\nVIII. PROMISING PRACTICES\n\nAlthough each workplace is different, there are many different types of promising policy, training, and organizational changes that employers may wish to consider implementing in an effort to minimize the likelihood of Title VII violations based on national origin.[174]The Commission uses the term \"promising practices\" here because these steps may help reduce the risk of violations. However, the Commission is aware there is not a single best approach for every workplace or circumstance.\n\nMoreover, adopting these practices does not insulate an employer from liability or damages for unlawful actions. Rather, meaningful implementation of these steps may help reduce the risk of violations, even where they are not legal requirements.\n\nA. Recruitment\n\nReliance on word-of-mouth recruiting may magnify existing ethnic, racial, or religious homogeneity in a workplace and result in the exclusion of qualified applicants from different national origin groups. As previously noted, word-of-mouth recruiting may result in a Title VII violation where an employer's actions have the purpose or effect of discriminating based on national origin.\n\nTo avoid inadvertently excluding some national origin groups, it is a promising practice to use a variety of recruitment methods to attract as diverse a pool of job seekers as possible. Depending on the type of position and the level of skill required, such recruitment tools may include a combination of newspapers of general circulation, as well as those directed at groups underrepresented in the workforce, and online postings; job fairs and open houses; publicly posting job announcements with a variety of community-based organizations as well as widely-distributed sources; conducting outreach through professional associations and search firms; recruiting from internship and scholar programs; and referrals using in-person connections.\n\nAn employer may wish to state that it is an \"equal opportunity employer\" and to draft employment advertisements to notify prospective applicants of all qualifications, including any qualifications related to language ability.\n\nB. Hiring, Promotion, and Assignment\n\nEmployers can reduce the risk of discriminatory employment decisions, including hiring, promotion, and assignment decisions, by establishing written objective criteria for evaluating candidates; communicating the criteria to prospective candidates; and applying those criteria consistently to all candidates. If an employer has clearly defined criteria for employment decisions, managers can be more confident that they are selecting the most qualified candidates, and candidates will understand how they will be evaluated. Appropriate objective criteria for employment decisions will be tied to business needs, and help ensure that all individuals are given an equal opportunity when being considered for open positions, assignments, and promotions. An employer's decision to apply criteria that are not related to the performance of the job, such as real or perceived coworker or customer preferences, may improperly screen out individuals based on their national origin. When conducting job interviews, employers can promote nondiscriminatory treatment by asking similar questions of all applicants and by limiting their inquiries to matters related to the position in question. Employers are encouraged to discuss the selection process with officials tasked with making hiring decisions and hold officials accountable to ensure non-discrimination in hiring.\n\nC. Discipline, Demotion, and Discharge\n\nEmployers can reduce the risk of discriminatory employment decisions by developing objective, job-related criteria for identifying the unsatisfactory performance or conduct that can result in discipline, demotion, or discharge.[175] One common approach for addressing misconduct is to implement a progressive discipline policy directed at correcting employee misconduct. Such a policy would clearly communicate conduct standards and performance expectations to employees and provide employees with the opportunity to improve their performance before progressive discipline or discharge occurs.\n\nWhen languages other than English are spoken in the workplace, employers are advised to take proactive measures to ensure that their policies are communicated effectively to all their employees. Such measures may include translating the policies into, and offering training in, the languages spoken by employees.\n\nEmployers also will benefit from carefully recording the business reasons for disciplinary or performance-related actions and sharing these reasons with the affected employees. Because any policy related to discipline or poor work performance will require some exercise of managerial discretion, employers are advised to monitor the actions of inexperienced managers and encourage them to consult with more experienced managers when addressing difficult performance issues.\n\nD. Harassment\n\nThe most important step for an employer in preventing a hostile work environment is clearly communicating to employees through policies and actions that harassment will not be tolerated and that employees who violate the prohibition against harassment will be disciplined. Harassment and other policies should be shared with all employees, including temporary and contract workers. In addition, effective and clearly communicated procedures for addressing complaints of national origin harassment are important. An employer's policies and procedures will not be effective if its employees are unable to understand[176] or utilize the complaint process.[177] Therefore, employers are advised to consider translating their policies into the languages spoken by employees with limited English skills, conducting trainings on the policies in these languages, and providing interpreters or other language assistance to ensure that employees can report harassment confidentially.[178] Employers also may train managers on how to identify and respond effectively to harassment,[179] including the importance of proactively addressing conduct that does not initially violate Title VII but may, over time, rise to the level of actionable harassment.\n\nEmployees who are harassed are encouraged to act at an early stage to prevent the continuation of the objectionable conduct. This may include notifying the official designated by the employer's complaint or harassment procedures or another appropriate individual who is not specifically designated by the employer to accept complaints about the conduct.\n\nIX. CONCLUSION\n\nThe increased cultural diversity of today's workplaces presents new and evolving issues with respect to Title VII's protection against national origin discrimination. This enforcement guidance will assist EEOC staff in their investigation of national origin discrimination charges and provide information for applicants, employees, and employers to understand their respective rights and responsibilities under Title VII.\n\n[1] 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. Title VII, which the EEOC enforces, covers private sector and state and local government entities that have 15 or more employees, federal government employers, employment agencies, and labor organizations. In this document, the term \"employer\" is used to generically reference all of these covered entities.\n\n[2] Individuals are covered under Title VII regardless of immigration status or authorization to work. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e(f), 2000e-2; EEOC v. Tortilleria \"La Mejor,\" 758 F. Supp. 585, 593-94 (E.D. Cal. 1991)(\"Congress did not intend that the [Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA)] amend or repeal any of the previously legislated protections of the federal labor and employment laws accorded to aliens, documented or undocumented, including the protections of Title VII\"). In presenting IRCA, which, in part, prohibits employment of undocumented workers, a congressional committee confirmed that \"[T]he committee does not intend that any provision of this Act would limit the powers of State or Federal labor standards agencies such as the . . . Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. . . to remedy unfair practices committed against undocumented employees for exercising their rights before such agencies or for engaging in activities protected by these agencies.\" H.R.Rep.

Co., 414 U.S. 86, 95 (1973) (\"Tit[le] VII protects all individuals from unlawful discrimination, whether or not they are citizens of the United States.\"). Where a worker is undocumented, issues may arise regarding the availability of remedies, but those issues are case-specific. See EEOC v. Maritime Autowash, Inc., No. 15-1947, 2016 WL 1622290, at *5 (4th Cir. Apr. 25, 2016) (noting that questions related to relief in cases involving undocumented workers are \"nuanced\" and \"less categorical\" than defendant suggested and discussing, inter alia, Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB, 535 U.S. 137 (2002), where the Court reversed the NLRB's award of backpay to an undocumented worker for work not performed, while also affirming the applicability of the National Labor Relations Act to undocumented workers).\n\n[3] Employment in the United States includes employment in any territory or possession of the United States, including Puerto Rico, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. See EEOC,Compliance Manual Section 2: Threshold Issues, § 2-III A.4 n.82, http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/threshold.html (last modified Aug. 6, 2009) [hereinafter EEOC Threshold Issues Compliance Manual].

See 29 C.F.R. § 1606.1 (\"The Commission defines national origin discrimination broadly as including, but not limited to, the denial of equal employment opportunity because of an individual's, or his or her ancestor's, place of origin; or because an individual has the physical, cultural or linguistic characteristics of a national origin group.\").

Promisingpractices comply with the law, promote equal employment opportunity, show management commitment and accountability, and have produced positive results.\n\n[15] 29 C.F.R. § 1606.1 (defining national origin discrimination \"broadly\"). National origin discrimination includes discrimination because an individual is \"non-American\" or \"foreign born.\" See generally Zuckerstein v. Argonne Nat'l Lab., 663 F. Supp. 569, 576-77 (N.D. Ill. 1987) (finding that Title VII permits claim of discrimination against \"foreign born\" employees where charging parties were of Chinese and \"German-Jewish-Czechoslovakian\" origin).\n\n[16] 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2; 29 C.F.R. § 1606.2. In addition, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits an entity that receives federal financial assistance from discriminating based on national origin in employment \"where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is to provide employment.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-3. Title VI's prohibition on national origin discrimination has been interpreted to include discrimination based on language and to require a recipient of federal financial assistance to take reasonable steps to ensure that individuals with limited English proficiency have meaningful access to the recipient's programs, services, and activities. See, e.g., Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563, 567-68 (1974); Colwell v. Dep't of Health & Human Servs., 558 F.3d 1112, 1116-17 (9th Cir. 2009); and Title VI implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. § 42.405(d)(1).

Co., 414 U.S. 86, 88 (1973) (stating that \"[t]he term 'national origin' [in Title VII] on its face refers to the country where a person was born, or, more broadly, the country from which his or her ancestors came\").\n\n[19] See, e.g., Pejic v.

Farah Mfg. Co., 414 U.S. 86, 92 (1973) (stating that Title VII \"prohibits discrimination on the basis of citizenship whenever it has the purpose or effect of discriminating on the basis of national origin\"). Discrimination based on citizenship status may also have the purpose or effect of discriminating based on other protected bases, including race, color, or religion. Although Title VII applies regardless of immigration status or authorization to work, employers are prohibited from hiring individuals who are not authorized to work. See 8 U.S.C. § 1324a. However, the anti-discrimination provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), enforced by the Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices (OSC) in the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, expressly prohibitsemployers with four or more employees from discriminating based on citizenship or immigration status with respect to hiring, firing, and recruitment or referral for a fee. See 8 U.S.C. § 1324b(a)(1). This provision also prohibits employers with at least four employees from discriminating on the basis of national origin in hiring, firing, and recruitment or referral for a fee if those employers are not within Title VII's jurisdiction. 8 U.S.C. § 1324b(a)(2)(B). In cases where there may be overlapping jurisdiction between the EEOC (Title VII) and OSC (INA), EEOC investigators should consult the 1997 Memorandum of Understanding Between the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and The Office of Special Counsel for Immigration Related Unfair Employment Practices https://www.eeoc.gov/mou/memorandum-understanding-between-equal-employment-opportunity-commission-and-office-special (last modified July 6, 2000) [hereinafter EEOC/OSC Memorandum of Understanding]. EEOC investigators should direct any questions concerning the EEOC/OSC Memorandum of Understanding to the Office of Legal Counsel, Coordination Division. Additional information about employee rights under the laws enforced by the EEOC and OSC is contained in an EEOC/OSC joint publication that is available in 17 languages on the EEOC and OSC websites. See EEOC and OSC, Do you Know Where to Go, https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/osc-eeoc-flyer-do-you-know-where-go (last visited Oct. 19, 2016) and http://www.justice.gov/crt/worker-information (last visited Oct. 19, 2016).\n\n[30] Dawavendewa v. Salt River Project Agric. Improvement & Power Dist., 154 F.3d 1117, 1120 (9th Cir. 1998) (finding that \"differential employment treatment based on tribal affiliation is actionable as 'national origin' discrimination under Title VII\").\n\n[31] Employment discrimination involving more than one protected basis is a problem particularly in the area of national origin. See Written Testimony of Lucila Rosas, EEOC Lead Coordinator,\n\nImmigrant Worker Team, Commission Meeting of November 13, 2013, National Origin Discrimination in Today's Workplace, http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/meetings/11-13-13/rosas.cfm(last visited Oct. 19, 2016). The EEOC will \"examine with particular concern\" charges alleging discrimination \"grounded in national origin considerations, such as . . . membership in, or association with an organization identified with or seeking to promote the interests of national origin groups,\" and \"attendance or participation in schools, churches, temples or mosques, generally used by persons of a national origin group.\" 29 C.F.R. § 1606.1.\n\n[32] See, e.g., Reyes v. Pharma Chemie, Inc., 890 F. Supp. 2d 1147, 1158 (D. Neb. 2012) (stating that \"[t]he line dividing the concepts of 'race' and 'national origin' is fuzzy at best, and in some contexts, national origin discrimination is so closely related to racial discrimination as to be indistinguishable\").\n\n[33] See, e.g., EEOC v. WC&M Enters., 496 F.3d 393, 400-01 (5th Cir. 2007) (ruling that a jury could reasonably conclude that post-September 11 harassment against an Indian employee because he was perceived to be Arab and was, in fact, Muslim, was severe or pervasive and motivated by his national origin and religion).\n\nAn important difference between national origin and religious discrimination involves reasonable accommodation. Title VII requires reasonable accommodation of sincerely held religious practices barring undue hardship, but it does not require accommodation of national origin traditions or practices. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(j); 29 C.F.R. § 1605.2(b). For a detailed discussion of religious accommodation and undue hardship, refer to 29 C.F.R. § 1605.2; EEOC, Compliance Manual Section 12: Religious Discrimination (July 22, 2008), http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/religion.html; EEOC, Religious Garb and Grooming in the Workplace: Rights and Responsibilities, http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/qa_religious_garb_grooming.cfm (last visited Oct. 19, 2016).\n\n[34] EEOC investigators should identify this conduct as discrimination based on race and national origin. See St. Francis Coll. v. Al-Khazraji, 481 U.S. 604, 613 (1987) (recognizing claims for racial discrimination under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 for individuals of Arab descent).\n\n[35] See Jeffers v. Thompson, 264 F. Supp. 2d 314, 326 (D. Md. 2003); see also Lam v. Univ. of Haw., 40 F.3d 1551, 1562 (\"[W]here two bases for discrimination exist, they cannot be neatly reduced to distinct components.\").\n\n[36] Lam v. Univ. of Haw., 40 F.3d at 1562 (\"[Asian women] may be targeted for discrimination 'even in the absence of discrimination against [Asian] men or white women.'\") (quoting Jefferies, 615 F.2d at 1032)). Courts also have addressed intersectional discrimination against African American women and against African American men. See, e.g., Shazor v. Prof'l Transit Mgmt., 744 F.3d948,958 (6th Cir. 2014) (\"If a female African American plaintiff . . . establishes a sufficient foundation of discrimination, a defendant cannot undermine her prima facie case by showing that [W]hite women and African American men received the same treatment.\"); Jefferies, 615 F.2d at 1032-34 (\"we hold that when a Title VII plaintiff alleges that an employer discriminates against [B]lack females, the fact that [B]lack males and [W]hite females are not subject to discrimination is irrelevant\"); Kimble v. Wis. Dep't of Workforce Dev., 690 F. Supp. 2d 765, 770-71 (E.D. Wis. 2010) (concluding that plaintiff established the first element of a prima facie case under Title VII by alleging that he was discriminated against based on a combination of race and gender, i.e., because he is an African American male).\n\n[37] See Lam v. Univ. of Haw., 40 F.3d at 1562.\n\n[38] See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 1581-90 (criminalizing the holding, transporting, or selling of persons into peonage, slavery, or indentured servitude, as well as obtaining labor by force or physical restraint). The Trafficking Victims Protection Act (\"TVPA\") defines \"human trafficking\" or \"severe forms of trafficking in persons\" as \"(A) sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age;\" or \"(B) the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery.\" 22 U.S.C. § 7102(9); see alsoU.S. Dep't of State, Trafficking in Persons Report, 9 (June 2016), https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2016/.\n\nIn addition to Title VII remedies, trafficking victims may pursue civil remedies for violations of the TVPA, other federal statutes, and the U.S. Constitution, as well as tort and breach of contract claims. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 1595 (TVPA), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1960-68 (RICO), 29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq.(Fair Labor Standards Act), 29 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.(Migrant & Seasonal Agricultural Protection Act), 42 U.S.C. § 1981, § 1985(3) (Civil Rights Statutes).\n\n[39] See, e.g. EEOC v. Global Horizons, Inc., 7 F. Supp. 3d 1053 (D. Haw. 2014) (Title VII case finding contractor liable where Thai nationals brought to the U.S. under the H-2A visa program were required to pay high recruitment fees, paid less than non-Thai workers, made to work less desirable jobs, forced to live in deplorable conditions, and subjected to abuses on the farms, including physical violence, humiliation, heavy surveillance, and threats of being shot, deported, or arrested); see also infra note 48; Press Release, EEOC, EEOC Resolves Slavery and Human Trafficking Suit Against Trans Bay Steel For An Estimated $1 Million, (Dec. 8, 2006), http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/archive/12-8-06.html (describing a Title VII case where Thai workers trafficked to California for welding jobs were, among other things, forced to work for long hours without pay in restaurants and held against their will).\n\n[40] For more information on human trafficking, refer to EEOC, Human Trafficking, http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/interagency/trafficking.cfm(last visited Oct. 19,2016).\n\n[41] This example is based on the facts in Chellen v.

If the employer demonstrates that the policy or practice is job related and consistent with business necessity, the employer will nevertheless be liable if the charging party demonstrates that the employer has refused to adopt a less discriminatory alternative.

See also EEOC Threshold Issues Compliance Manual, supra note 3, at § 2-III B.1.a.iii(b), https://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/threshold.html#2-III-B-1-a-iii-(b).\n\nIn applying these factors, EEOC has long considered whether an employer has the right to control the terms and conditions of employment (regardless of whether the employer exercises that right), and an employer's indirect control of the terms and conditions of employment as relevant factors in this analysis. See, EEOC Enforcement Guidance on Contingent Workers, supra, at Questions 1-2, http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/conting.html. Example 5 of that enforcement guidance describes a situation where a client that reserves the right to direct staffing firm workers to perform particular tasks, but does not generally exercise that authority, may still be found to be a joint employer. Id. See also, Complainant v. Johnson, EEOC Doc. No. 0120160989, 2016 WL 1622535, at *3 (EEOC Apr. 14, 2016) (finding that \"if the [federal] Agency does not wish a staffing firm employee to continue on the contract, it communicates this to the staffing firm Project Manager, who facilitates the termination,\" and that this arrangement gives the federal agency \"de facto power to terminate Complainant, a significant factor weighing in favor of a finding that the Agency jointly employed Complainant\").\n\n[47] EEOC Enforcement Guidance on Contingent Workers, supra note 46, at Question 8, https://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/conting.html.\n\n[48] This example is based on facts similar to those in EEOC v.

Abercrombie & Fitch agreed to settle the matter by paying $50 million, developing and implementing nondiscriminatory hiring and recruiting procedures, and ensuring that minorities and women would be promoted into manager-in-training and manager positions without discrimination.

In this case, an applicant was not hired by Abercrombie & Fitch because she wore a headscarf, or \"hijab,\" for religious reasons, which the company did not feel conformed to its \"look policy.\" EEOC filed suit, and the Supreme Court held that Title VII is violated when an employer's motive for not hiring an applicant is to avoid providing a religious accommodation.
