The financial crisis of 2008 broke 16 consecutive years of economic growth for Spain, leading to an economic contraction that lasted until late 2013. In that year, the government successfully shored up its struggling banking sector - heavily exposed to the collapse of Spainâs real estate boom - with the help of an EU-funded restructuring and recapitalization program.\n\nUntil 2014, contraction in bank lending, fiscal austerity, and high unemployment constrained domestic consumption and investment. The unemployment rate rose from a low of about 8% in 2007 to more than 26% in 2013, but labor reforms prompted a modest reduction to 16.4% in 2017. High unemployment strained Spain's public finances, as spending on social benefits increased while tax revenues fell. Spainâs budget deficit peaked at 11.4% of GDP in 2010, but Spain gradually reduced the deficit to about 3.3% of GDP in 2017. Public debt has increased substantially â from 60.1% of GDP in 2010 to nearly 96.7% in 2017.\n\nStrong export growth helped bring Spain's current account into surplus in 2013 for the first time since 1986 and sustain Spainâs economic growth. Increasing labor productivity and an internal devaluation resulting from moderating labor costs and lower inflation have improved Spainâs export competitiveness and generated foreign investor interest in the economy, restoring FDI flows.\n\nIn 2017, the Spanish Governmentâs minority status constrained its ability to implement controversial labor, pension, health care, tax, and education reforms. The European Commission expects the government to meet its 2017 budget deficit target and anticipates that expected economic growth in 2018 will help the government meet its deficit target. Spainâs borrowing costs are dramatically lower since their peak in mid-2012 and increased economic activity has generated a modest level of inflation, at 2% in 2017.\n\nReal GDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$1.715 billion (2020 est.)\n\n$1.923 billion (2019 est.)\n\n$1.887 billion (2018 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 198\n\nReal GDP growth rate\n\n1.95% (2019 est.)\n\n2.43% (2018 est.)\n\n2.97% (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 140\n\nReal GDP per capita\n\n$36,200 (2020 est.)\n\n$40,800 (2019 est.)\n\n$40,300 (2018 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 53\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$1,393,351,000,000 (2019 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices)\n\n0.7% (2019 est.)\n\n1.6% (2018 est.)\n\n1.9% (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 55\n\nCredit ratings\n\nFitch rating: A- (2018)\n\nMoody's rating: Baa1 (2018)\n\nStandard & Poors rating: A (2019)\n\nnote: The year refers to the year in which the current credit rating was first obtained.\n\nGDP - composition, by sector of origin\n\nagriculture: 2.6% (2017 est.)\n\nindustry: 23.2% (2017 est.)\n\nservices: 74.2% (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - composition, by end use\n\nhousehold consumption: 57.7% (2017 est.)\n\ngovernment consumption: 18.5% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in fixed capital: 20.6% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in inventories: 0.6% (2017 est.)\n\nexports of goods and services: 34.1% (2017 est.)\n\nimports of goods and services: -31.4% (2017 est.)\n\nAgricultural products\n\nbarley, milk, wheat, olives, grapes, tomatoes, pork, maize, oranges, sugar beets\n\nIndustries\n\ntextiles and apparel (including footwear), food and beverages, metals and metal manufactures, chemicals, shipbuilding, automobiles, machine tools, tourism, clay and refractory products, footwear, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment\n\nIndustrial production growth rate\n\n4% (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 76\n\nLabor force\n\n19.057 million (2020 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 29\n\nLabor force - by occupation\n\nagriculture: 4.2%\n\nindustry: 24%\n\nservices: 71.7% (2009)\n\nUnemployment rate\n\n14.13% (2019 est.)\n\n15.25% (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 173\n\nYouth unemployment rate (ages 15-24)\n\ntotal: 34.8%\n\nmale: 34.1%\n\nfemale: 35.6% (2021 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 24\n\nPopulation below poverty line\n\n20.7% (2018 est.)\n\nGini Index coefficient - distribution of family income\n\n34.7 (2017 est.)\n\n32 (2005)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 111\n\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share\n\nlowest 10%: 2.5%\n\nhighest 10%: 24% (2011)\n\nBudget\n\nrevenues: 498.1 billion (2017 est.)\n\nexpenditures: 539 billion (2017 est.)\n\nBudget surplus (+) or deficit (-)\n\n-3.1% (of GDP) (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 136\n\nPublic debt\n\n98.4% of GDP (2017 est.)\n\n99% of GDP (2016 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 18\n\nTaxes and other revenues\n\n37.9% (of GDP) (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 52\n\nFiscal year\n\ncalendar year\n\nCurrent account balance\n\n$29.603 billion (2019 est.)\n\n$27.206 billion (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 13\n\nExports\n\n$392.85 billion (2020 est.) ; note: data are in current year dollars\n\n$486.15 billion (2019 est.) ; note: data are in current year dollars\n\n$499.55 billion (2018 est.) ; note: data are in current year dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 18\n\nExports - partners\n\nFrance 15%, Germany 11%, Italy 8%, Portugal 8%, United Kingdom 7%, United States 5% (2019)\n\nExports - commodities\n\ncars and vehicle parts, refined petroleum, packaged medicines, delivery trucks, clothing and apparel (2019)\n\nImports\n\n$373.67 billion (2020 est.) note: data are in current year dollars\n\n$444.31 billion (2019 est.) note: data are in current year dollars\n\n$460.98 billion (2018 est.) note: data are in current year dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 18\n\nImports - partners\n\nGermany 13%, France 11%, China 8%, Italy 7% (2019)\n\nImports - commodities\n\ncrude petroleum, cars and vehicle parts, packaged medicines, natural gas, refined petroleum (2019)\n\nReserves of foreign exchange and gold\n\n$69.41 billion (31 December 2017 est.)\n\n$63.14 billion (31 December 2016 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 32\n\nDebt - external\n\n$2.338 billion (2019 est.)\n\n$2.366 billion (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 150\n\nExchange rates\n\neuros (EUR) per US dollar -\n\n0.82771 (2020 est.)\n\n0.90338 (2019 est.)\n\n0.87789 (2018 est.)\n\n0.7525 (2014 est.)\n\n0.7634 (2013 est.)"
