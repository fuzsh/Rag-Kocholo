        "text": "Following legislative elections, the monarch selects a candidate for prime minister, generally the leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the lower house. The parliament then votes on the selected candidate.\n\nThe People’s Party (PP) won the most seats in the snap election in July 2023, but its leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, failed to secure the necessary votes to become prime minister. Pedro Sánchez, whose PSOE party won the second most seats, reached a coalition deal with the left-wing party Sumar, secured the votes of Basque and Catalan nationalist lawmakers, and formed a new government in November.\n\nThe lower house of Spain’s bicameral parliament, the Congress of Deputies, is composed of 350 members elected in multimember constituencies for each of Spain’s provinces, with the exception of the North African exclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, each of which has one single-member constituency. The Senate has 266 members, 208 of whom are elected directly, and 58 of whom are chosen by regional legislatures. Members of both chambers serve four-year terms. Spain’s legislative elections are generally considered free and fair.\n\nIn May 2023, municipal and regional elections took place across the country. The PSOE lost control of several regions and cities, while the PP won majorities in Madrid and La Rioja. After his party’s poor showing, Prime Minister Sánchez called for snap general elections in July.\n\nIn the July 2023 polls, the PP secured 137 seats, followed by the PSOE with 121, Vox with 33, and Sumar with 31, among several other parties. In the Senate, the PP won 120 seats, an absolute majority, and the PSOE took 72.\n\nCitizens are free to organize political parties, which are able to function without interference in practice. While the PP and the PSOE once dominated the political system, corruption scandals, persistent economic woes, and the dispute over Catalonia have aided the rise of new alternatives in recent years, including United We Can (UP) or Sumar on the left and Vox on the right.\n\nVoting and political affairs in general are largely free from undue interference by unelected or external forces. However, disinformation and other such manipulation in elections is a growing concern. In 2023, law enforcement authorities continued to investigate an alleged campaign by the former PP government to obtain and disseminate compromising information about Catalan separatist leaders and other political opponents. In March, parliament also started an investigation into the issue.\n\nWomen and ethnic, racial, and religious minority groups enjoy full political rights. Women are free to advocate for their political interests, and they are relatively well represented in practice, holding 44 and 42 percent of the seats in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, respectively.\n\nSpain’s system of regional autonomy grants significant powers of self-governance to the country’s traditional national minorities, including the Catalan and Basque minorities.\n\nIn 2023, PSOE and left-wing, nationalist and independentist parties proposed an amnesty bill that would pardon crimes committed by Catalan separatists, generating controversy over its constitutionality. The proposed bill excluded some acts, such as terrorism and torture. At the end of the year the bill had not yet been passed.\n\nElected officials are generally free to make and implement laws and policies without undue interference. However, the political system has failed to produce a stable governing majority in the parliament since 2015, resulting in frequent and inconclusive elections, a sharp decline in the passage of legislation, and an increased use of mechanisms like executive decrees to advance the government’s agenda without the approval of lawmakers.\n\nConcerns about official corruption often center on party financing. Most party expenses are funded by the state, but political parties can access commercial bank loans. Over the past decade, lawmakers have imposed some restrictions on such private sources of funding, prohibited banks from forgiving party debt, strengthened rules on asset disclosure and conflicts of interest for high-ranking officials, and enacted more severe penalties for corruption-related crimes.\n\nAlthough the courts have a solid record of investigating and prosecuting corruption cases, the system is often overburdened, and cases move slowly.\n\nIn March 2023, a law to protect whistleblowers entered into force. The law includes sanctions for those who retaliate against whistleblowers exposing corruption, but only protects informants who obtained information legally.\n\nLegal safeguards to ensure government transparency include asset-disclosure rules for public officials and laws governing conflicts of interest. The Transparency Act, which took effect in 2014, is meant to facilitate public access to government records, though freedom of information activists have reported onerous procedures and called for improvements to the law, as well as mechanisms to access more judicial and parliamentary documents.\n\nThe Council of Europe’s Group of States Against Corruption (GRECO) has noted that the Council of Transparency and Good Governance (CTBG), the body tasked with monitoring compliance with transparency obligations, lacks resources and does not have the ability to impose sanctions. Civil society organizations continue to report that the Sánchez government frequently resists complying with requests or orders to disclose information.\n\nSpain has a free press that covers a wide range of perspectives and actively investigates high-level corruption. However, consolidation of private ownership poses a threat to media independence, and ownership in the print and online media sectors is less transparent than in broadcast media. Media outlets have also encountered a proliferation of lawsuits intended to obstruct their coverage of private-sector wrongdoing.\n\nThe level of violence against journalists has fallen considerably, but journalists are sometimes subject to harassment and physical assaults in the course of their work, especially during protests. The continued harassment of journalists by far-right elements of social media has been widely reported.\n\nA controversial public safety law that took effect in 2015, nicknamed the “gag law” by its critics, established large fines for offenses including spreading images that could endanger police officers or protected facilities. Journalists continue to face penalties for alleged violations of the law while reporting on police actions. In 2023, a journalist was also sentenced to two years in prison for publishing information about a murder, even though the court recognized that the published information was true.\n\nDuring the electoral campaign in 2023, the right-wing political party Vox barred certain journalists from covering its events and press conferences.\n\nReligious freedom is guaranteed in the constitution and respected in practice. As the country’s dominant religion, Roman Catholicism enjoys benefits not afforded to others, such as financing through the tax system. However, the religious organizations of Jews, Muslims, and Protestants also have certain privileges through agreements with the state, including tax exemptions and permission to station chaplains in hospitals and other institutions. Other groups that choose to register can obtain a legal identity and the right to own or rent property. The penal code contains a provision to punish blasphemy, but prosecutions are rare in practice. In recent years, extreme conservative groups have used this provision to promote self-censorship.\n\nPrivate discussion remains open and vibrant. Aggressive enforcement of laws banning the glorification of terrorism has threatened free speech, and in 2017 the Supreme Court ruled that a person could violate the law without intending to “glorify” a terrorist group or “humiliate” its victims. However, over the past several years there has been a noticeable decline in the strict implementation of these laws.\n\nIndividuals have also been prosecuted for insulting the monarchy, the flag, and other state institutions. In 2023, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) found that Spain had violated a trade union representative’s right to freedom of expression after he was convicted of insulting Spain for shouting offensive words towards the national flag during a protest.\n\nThe constitution provides for freedom of assembly, and the authorities typically respect this right. However, the public safety act that took effect in 2015 imposed a number of restrictions, including fines of up to €600,000 ($630,000) for participating in unauthorized protests near key buildings or infrastructure. Participants in protests on a variety of local concerns have been ordered to pay smaller but still substantial fines under the law in practice, and as of 2023 at least 250,000 penalties had been imposed based on the law.\n\nIn recent years, several protesters have been prosecuted for participating in demonstrations that resulted in clashes with police, facing up to seven years in prison for allegedly attacking the authorities or causing public disturbances. Human rights organizations have reported an escalation in police violence during demonstrations.\n\nDespite these concerns, a number of protests took place across Spain in 2023, including demonstrations by human rights activists, Catalan separatist groups, opposition parties, workers’ rights organizations, and advocates for social benefits and the public health system.\n\nThe constitution provides for an independent judiciary, and the courts operate autonomously in practice. However, the Council of Europe (CoE) has criticized the fact that 12 judges who sit on the 20-member General Council of the Judiciary (CGPJ)—which oversees the courts and is responsible for appointing, transferring, and promoting judges—are appointed through a three-fifths vote in the parliament. This arrangement has exposed the body to political disruptions.\n\nThe CGPJ’s membership was due to be renewed in late 2018, but the opposition PP denied the governing parties the necessary supermajority. The incumbent council has continued to operate, but in 2023 the Constitutional Court confirmed that the CGPJ cannot make appointments while operating on an interim basis.\n\nTo secure the necessary votes to become prime minister, Pedro Sánchez signed a deal with Catalan separatist parties in which he promised to create parliamentary committees that would analyze if abusive “lawfare” practices had been used in Catalan-related cases. This triggered outrage from the judiciary, which claimed the measure would constitute interference in its duties. In December 2023, the parliament approved the creation of three parliamentary committees.\n\nThe authorities generally observe legal safeguards against arbitrary arrest and detention,\n\nthough judges can authorize special restrictions on communication and delayed arraignment for detainees held in connection with acts of terrorism. Defendants typically enjoy full due process rights during trial. However, high-profile cases related to Basque and Catalan nationalism in recent years have featured flaws—including disproportionate charges and penalties as well as unjustified pretrial detention—that drew criticism from international organizations.\n\nIn May 2023, the UN Human Rights Committee found that the Spanish Supreme Court had violated former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont’s right to be elected by suspending him from the European Parliament in 2018.\n\nWomen, members of racial and other minority groups, and LGBT+ people enjoy legal protections against discrimination and other mistreatment, though a degree of societal bias persists. In 2022, hate crimes based on sex or gender increased by 76.6 percent. Members of some minority populations—including Roma populations—remain economically marginalized and are allegedly subject to police profiling.\n\nSpain is a major point of entry to Europe for irregular migrants and refugees, with most making the crossing by sea. In 2023, approximately 52,000 people arrived by sea, and according to UN data at least 1,190 people died at sea while trying to reach Spain. International human rights groups have criticized the response from Spanish authorities, stating that migrants and asylum seekers are often housed in poor conditions, including improvised camps that allegedly violate human rights standards, or returned to their countries without due process."
