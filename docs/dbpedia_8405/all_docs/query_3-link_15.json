The main international recommendations that are the focus of the assessment are, as appropriate, the Principles and Recommendations for Population and Housing Censuses, Revision 1, the Principles and Recommendations for a Vital Statistics System, Revision 2, and Recommendations on Statistics of International Migration, Revision 1."
