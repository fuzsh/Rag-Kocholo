Ethnicity, on the other hand, refers to a group that shares cultural practices.\n\nSkin, hair, eye color, and other physical features would, therefore, figure into the definition of race. Ethnicity, on the other hand, would refer to language, religious practices, social mores, and so forth.\n\nTo add to the confusion, the U.S. Census Bureau defines race as a matter of traceable national origin, rather than groupings of people with similar physical features.\n\nTo compound matters, the meaning of “race” has changed over time. At some point in time, “race” meant each of the things described above. And today’s Merriam-Webster Dictionary recognizes all of these definitions, plus a few more, such as “the human race.”\n\nScience doesn’t support the idea of biological race, at least as the term has been traditionally used to classify people. Variations in physical features don’t equate, as was once thought, to genetic differences, or even to common ancestors.\n\nAnd yet racial classifications continue to play an outsized role in society. They have determined access to resources and opportunities, and can have lifelong consequences in terms of health outcomes, economic inequality, environmental justice, and more.\n\nWhat is Ethnicity?\n\nEthnicity, on the other hand, is simpler to define.\n\nAn ethnic group is a group of people united by social and cultural practices such as language, religion, tribal background, or national affiliation.\n\nWhich Country Has the Most Ethnicity?\n\nThat’s a difficult question! But here are a few answers.\n\nPapua New Guinea has hundreds of ethnic groups and 839 spoken languages, many of which are completely unrelated to the others. Not bad for a population of 9.5 million.\n\nWith a population of more than 55 million people, Tanzania has more than one hundred ethnic groups.\n\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo has 81.6 million people who comprise 200 ethnic groups that speak 242 languages.\n\nLiberia, with a population of only 4.5 million, is one of the most ethnically diverse countries in the world, with 28 different ethnic groups.\n\nThe Limits of Data\n\nAlthough the definition of ethnicity is a bit more straightforward than that of race, accurately describing the ethnicity of a given country can be anything but.\n\nDifferent countries, for example, Mauritius, may not collect ethnicity data at all. And not every group of people will respond to a census or survey about ethnicity.\n\nScholars strive for accuracy, but that accuracy may be less than one hundred percent for some areas.\n\nWhat Does Ethnicity Mean?\n\nEthnicity is a way of classifying people according to social factors such as language, religion, and social practices. And in terms of ethnicity, the world is a very diverse place!\n\nLegends can play an important part in different cultures. Do you know your North American legendary creatures?
