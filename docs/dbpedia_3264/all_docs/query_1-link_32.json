        "text": "Guest introduction by LaSaia Wade, founder and executive director of Brave Space Alliance\n\nJupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) was born under a night sky, with signs predicting that she was destined for great things. Now grown, Jupiter dreams of the stars but wakes up to the cold reality of a job cleaning other peopleâ€™s houses and an endless run of bad breaks. Only when Caine (Channing Tatum), a genetically engineered ex-military hunter, arrives on Earth to track her down does Jupiter begin to glimpse the fate that has been waiting for her all along - her genetic signature marks her as next in line for an extraordinary inheritance that could alter the balance of the cosmos. From the streets of Chicago to far flung galaxies whirling through space, Jupiter Ascending is written and directed by Lana Wachowski and Lilly Wachowski.\n\nTickets are $6 for Film Center members; $12 for General Admission\n\nA small gallery of images which advertise this business"
