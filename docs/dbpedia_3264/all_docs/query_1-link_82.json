        "text": "What the new trailer for Jupiter Ascending, the new science-fiction/fantasy flick from the Wachowskis, lacks in originality—which is to say, everything—it makes up for in enthusiasm and epic grandeur. Yes, we've seen this story told before more than once, but when it looks this much fun, do you really care?\n\nThe movie centers around Jupiter (Mila Kunis), who spends her days cleaning toilets for a living before an alien—Channing Tatum, because why not?—reveals that she is, in fact, a space princess. Of course, that discovery leads to plots on behalf of those who'd want to stop her from claiming the power that's rightfully hers, which in turn leads to space battles and the stuff of which special effects companies are made of. Any complaints about that simply being Cinderella meets Star Wars with a little Man of Steel thrown in should be suspended until you've actually taken a moment to consider how wonderful that sounds.\n\nWith derring-do, fairy tales updated for an audience who embraced Avatar, and the on-screen pairing of Tatum and Kunis, Jupiter Ascending feels like it's a purposeful attempt on behalf of writer/directors Lana and Andy Wachowski to re-embrace the mainstream after the too-esoteric-for-the-masses Cloud Atlas. But on the basis of this trailer, if this is what going mainstream looks like, more moviemakers should try it.\n\nJupiter Ascending hits theaters released July 18.\n\nThe 30 Best Movies on Max (aka HBO Max) Right Now\n\nLove Lies Bleeding, Dune: Part Two, and Beetlejuice are just a few of the movies you should be watching on Max this month.\n\nThe 49 Best Movies on Netflix Right Now\n\nThe Long Game, Leo, and Godzilla Minus One are just a few of the movies you should watch on Netflix this month.\n\nThe 52 Best Shows on Disney+ Right Now\n\nArctic Ascent With Alex Honnold, X-Men ’97, and Star Wars: Young Jedi Adventures are just a few of the shows you should be watching on Disney+ this month.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine Scales New Heights of Cinematic Self-Awareness\n\nDeadpool’s first foray into the Marvel Cinematic Universe is all about giving fans more Easter eggs and references than they can catch. Will it also score Disney a hit?\n\nPeople Are Big Mad About the House of the Dragon Season 2 Finale\n\n“Did I just watch a 70 minute trailer for Season 3?” is just one of the reactions fans have posted online about the season's \"disappointing and poorly executed\" closer.\n\nThe 36 Best Shows on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nThe Boys, Batman: Caped Crusader, and Fallout are just a few of the shows you should be watching on Amazon Prime Video this week.\n\nEminem’s New Album Prompted Gen X to Declare a TikTok ‘War’ on Gen Z\n\nThe release of Eminem’s new album The Death of Slim Shady has led to a series of viral shitposts from Gen X. Their targets, Gen Z, remain unbothered.\n\nWelcome to the Weird Era\n\nYou can call politicians castigating the childless and companies marketing AI assistants a lot of things, but it's au courant to call them weird. The Era of Weird has been a long time coming—but may have a cringey future ahead."
