        "text": "Warning: The following contains serious spoilers for Andy and Lana Wachowskis’ 2015 Jupiter Ascending.\n\nThis is a cross-post from The Molinist\n\nIf the box office is anything to go by, you probably haven’t seen “The Wachowskis’” Jupiter Ascending. That is, I think, your loss. Not just for the lover of nanar, who shouldn’t miss this over-the-top, awkwardly plotted, heavy-handedly themed, often cringe-inducingly scripted space opera, at least 20 minutes of which’s total runtime is made up of slow-motion falling, Jupiter Ascending is the increasingly rare sci-fi blockbuster title that is actually about something. And not just something but something worth talking about. So, because I am apparently incapable of doing the one thing I absolutely need to do here and finish that damned book review, today I’m going to talk about the politics of a sci-fi movie.\n\nJupiter in the process of Ascending.\n\nJupiter Ascendings politics are roughly as subtle as Eddie Redmaynes performance: shouted and whispered by turns but always chewing the scenery. The premise (and this is where that spoiler warning becomes relevant — and I mean it, by the way, the reveal I’m about to spoil is pretty central to the pacing of the film) of Jupiter Ascending is that Earth is one of thousands of estates, planets owned by powerful families of extra-terrestrial, but very human, aristocrats, who, when such estates’ human populations exceed their planets carrying capacity, harvest the human population and process their bodies into Recode, a substance which extends human lives by ‘re-setting’ human bodies to their physical peak.1 These humans (responsible for seeding the earth with human life, as well as the extinction of the dinosaurs, apparently a branch species of the delightfully tropey Sargons, several of whom serve the films big bad) can live for tens of thousands of years with the aid of Recode (one character is said to have been “…approaching her 91st millenium…” at the time of her death), but the product is so expensive as to be a luxury, or at least not a staple, good (another character explicitly describes not being able to afford a medically necessary Recode). Our hero, Jupiter Jones, is the earth-born ‘recurrence,’ the films lingo for genetic reincarnation,2 of the now-dead sovereign of the House of Abraxis (the legal language of the space humans is…confusing), a powerful family of Recode-producing plutocrats whose estates include Earth. The rest of the plot needn’t be summarised at any length other than to point out that Channing Tatum is a Lycantant, a splice of human DNA with an animal like a wolf, who flies around on gravity boots.3 The very, very explicit analogies are likely starting to come into focus. Though, in fact, my plot summary likely brings to the fore the analogy of factory farming which, in the film itself, is only one of two primary metaphors through which the central theme is expanded upon (the other, as will be discussed further, is reproductive justice). That central theme is that industrial capitalism is fundamentally dehumanising, turning the masses into objects, as well as subjects, of consumption, and the very richest into vain, joyless plutocrats.\n\nI saw it observed that Jupiter Ascending is something of an update of The Matrix.4 This is true to a point. The Matrix, in my own opinion, is fundamentally about how technology dehumanises us but that message is somewhat lost in the bullet-time and awkward Christ-metaphors. Jupiter Ascending, rather, is about how capitalism, including is as much as it is driven by the rapacity of human beings, oppresses and dehumanises. Where The Matrix was a product of 2000s-era technophobic alarmism, with little to actually say about human relationships with technology beyond technology scary, Jupiter Ascending is seeking to make substantive statements about our relationships to industrial capitalism as a now effectively transparent and all-consuming economic and cultural system.5 The metaphor is all in the Recode: the (apparently potentially infinitely) life-extending serum produced by the above-mentioned vain, joyless plutocrats. At the most obvious level, and the one Eddie Redmaynes Lord Balem makes explicit whilst liberally chewing the scenery, Recode is a metaphor for capitalist consumption of other people: Recode is a substance literally made of people that gives other people life.6 If you want to put in a Marxist framework, Jupiter Ascending frames the alienation of labour as a consumptive act, in which the rich literally feed off of the poor through the acquisition of the fruits of their labour. On top of this relatively-straightforward layer of metaphor is the fact that Recode is produced from the bodies (again, bodies as metaphor for labour) of humans who are literally farmed: the planets from whose populations Recode is made (called estates) are seeded with human life, carefully monitored to ensure they remain otherwise isolated from spacefaring human society, and periodically ‘skimmed’ to produce small(er) batches of Recode until they exceed their carrying capacity, at which point the planets’ entire populations are ‘harvested’ for processing and sale.7 Getting Marxist again (Jupiter Ascending is either pretty Marxist or just really, really susceptible to a Marxist critical reading), Recode production represents the literal creation of a labouring class by the bourgeoisie: the elite manufacture a pool of labour/bodies from which to extract capital/life.\n\nCaine, being whatever a ‘Skyjammer’ is.\n\nI mentioned that reproductive justice as a reality under industrial capitalism is an explicit, though comparatively understated, aspect of the text.8 Jupiter’s first encounter with her saviour and eventual lover,9 Caine Wise (portrayed by Channing Tatum) is on the table at a fertility clinic, where she intends to sell her eggs at the behest of her useless male cousin, who will be pocketing most of the proceeds. This is contrasted, by means of a chiastic story structure, with a brief explanation of the nature of ‘splices,’ individuals who are the products of splicing human and non-human DNA in order to create humanoid persons with capabilities or inclinations beyond those of normal humans which suit them to specific tasks. Splices are batch-bread by ‘Splicers’ and sold to wealthy individuals or institutions to make use of those special genetic traits. Thus wolf and bee splices are popular with the military and deer splices as domestic servants for the very wealthy. Splices are another manifestation of the devaluation of human life in the interest of economic and institutional expediency: human beings genetically engineered to serve and sold to the highest bidder apparently without personal autonomy.10 To further emphasise their inferior social status, splices are literally branded with their splicers mark, physically marking them out as products rather than people, as walking advertisements to the potential customers with whom they might interact. As created life they, like the humans of the estates, exist at the whim of those who own the means of production (of life itself).\n\nIn the movie’s exciting final moments, Jupiter Jones, having successfully conquered the intergalactic bureaucracy and claimed her legal title as the recurrence of the dead Abraxis sovereign, defends that claim against the illegal machinations of Balem Abraxis and saves earth from eventual harvesting by…owning it. Jupiter’s ascent is not a conquest: she claims power within the system but does not attempt to topple the system. In the tradition of Gattaca, Jupiter Ascending presents to the viewer an anti-capitalist biopolitic which asserts that capitalism is an inherently dehumanising and exploitative system but proffers no redress or escape, only a fantasy of assimilation into the elite. That Jupiter might represent hope for others whose bodies are owned and exist only to be harvested isn’t even suggested. Her revulsion at the system of Recode manufacture extends only so far as a desire to protect her loved ones from its ravages, not to any apparent interest in ending the system itself. Jupiter Ascending is a cautionary, rather than revolutionary, story, warning that the system, if allowed to continue to perpetuate itself, may become so entrenched that change becomes impossible and salvation only personal.\n\nEddie Redmayne as Space Capitalism.\n\nI was excited for Jupiter Ascending for two reasons. The first is that it’s the first original IP in high-concept speculative fiction in a couple of years. In an era when big-budget spec fic is always reboot; rehash; rework; or, rarely, riff, an original setting with original themes is a rare gem and one that deserves consumer support. The second is that the movie was being universally panned by critics who saw it as dumb, ridiculous tripe shamelessly targeted at teenage girls and then turned around and praised Kingsman as a fun romp geared at teenage boys but enjoyable by kids of all ages if you go into it with the right attitude. I went in looking forward to a fun, over the top space opera. I got that, in spades. But I also got a remarkably dense, layered metaphorical exploration of life under industrial capitalism, which is, I think, something worth supporting with money and attention.11\n\nNotes"
