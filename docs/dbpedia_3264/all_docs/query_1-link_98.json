        "text": "Mila Kunis is certain every life needs magic, whimsy and fantasy.\n\nThis is why Kunis, 31, a new mom, found her way to become the leading lady in the highly anticipated film “Jupiter Ascending,” a sci-fi space adventure written, directed and produced by Andy and Lana Wachowski.\n\nIt marks the Wachowski duo’s return to original screenplays and the genre of science fiction since the conclusion of their hit “The Matrix” trilogy.\n\n“I can’t even remember a time when alien intelligence or the potential inherent in the vastness of space didn’t fascinate us,” Lana Wachowski says on a recent press junket.\n\n“Who didn’t love Carl Sagan’s ‘Cosmos’? And ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’ had such a profound impact on us,” she says. “But as storytellers, what got us excited was answering the question: ‘If someone else is out there, and they know about us, (then) why don’t they want us to know about them?’ ”\n\nOpening Friday, the spectacular film, with stellar special effects, centers on the title character of Jupiter Jones (Kunis), a lowly, down-on-her-luck maid who learns her great genetic destiny has far-reaching implications that extend beyond Earth.\n\nIn fact, she is the unwitting genetic heir to a family that literally rules the world.\n\nSet in a bright and colorful future, Jupiter is targeted by Caine Wise (Channing Tatum), the ruthless son of a powerful family that lives on a planet in need of a new heir, so she travels with a genetically engineered warrior to the planet in order to stop his tyrannical reign.\n\nOnly when Caine, a genetically engineered ex-military hunter, arrives on Earth to track her down does Jupiter begin to glimpse the fate that has been waiting for her all along: Her genetic signature marks her as next in line for an extraordinary inheritance that could alter the balance of the cosmos.\n\nMeanwhile, Caine has to protect her from Balem Abrasax (Eddie Redmayne), alien royalty from one of the most powerful dynasties of the universe, who put a bounty on her head and would rather harvest Earth than lose it to her.\n\nFor Lana Wachowski, there is a great deal of heart — and valuable life lessons — at the core of this movie. She noted the story begins and ends with a telescope as a metaphor for one’s perspective on life.\n\n“Jupiter is born into darkness — helpless, homeless and fatherless. Knowing only hard times, she hates her life,” she says. “She wants to look through the telescope and see the bigger picture — because then, you see things more clearly and there is a whole universe of opportunities that your future can hold.”\n\nKunis was attracted to this film for many reasons — physically and emotionally. She embraced the themes of dreams, fate, quests and finding your place in the world, as well as the rough-and-tumble stunt work.\n\n“There’s a lot of action, and a beautiful love story,” she reveals, “and even though it takes place in the most fantastical settings, everything feels so tangible and real. It’s so smart and was so much fun. Also, there’s a fair amount of sharp humor, which I love.”\n\nThe movie also called for a great deal of physical exertion and stunt work, and Kunis says she was up for the challenge.\n\n“This movie requires a lot of wires; everything seems to be wired. Apparently, I like it, because I keep doing movies that require wires — it involves having a great time.”\n\nThis also involves a great deal of trust in the stunt technician in charge.\n\n“It’s really not hard to be wired and have somebody else be responsible for the wire work — and your life. Your only responsibility is to stay hours on those wires. So I guess I do work out a little bit for that purpose. I have always done all my own stunts, actually as much as I am allotted.”\n\nKunis was born in Chernivtsi, Ukraine. She started performing at age 9 when her father heard about an acting class on the radio and decided to enroll her in it. There, she met her future agent.\n\nKunis is best known for her romantic comedies, including “Friends with Benefits,” “Forgetting Sarah Marshall” and “Ted.” She also shined in “Black Swan,” “The Book of Eli” and the whimsical film “Oz: The Great and Powerful,” as well as in voice work on “Family Guy.”\n\nWhen she is not working on movies, Kunis is happily nesting and exploring new motherhood. She and actor-fiancé Ashton Kutcher became parents of a daughter, Wyatt Isabelle, on Sept. 30.\n\n“I am thrilled to say that I have an amazing family, and I also have an incredible group of friends that I can count on one hand. I’m so blessed,” she says. “I am also lucky to be in the position to work with people that I respect, that I look up to and admire, and who I actually want to show up to work with. I think a lot of that speaks for itself.”\n\nIt may not be magic or fantasy like this film, but that’s fine with her.\n\n“Being at this exact place in my life is great,” she says. “You can’t call it a wish; it’s not like I magically wished for something and it happened overnight. But I’m exactly where I want to be right now.”\n\nDebra Wallace is a freelance entertainment and feature writer based in Huntingdon Valley. She can be reached at debrawallace@verizon.net."
