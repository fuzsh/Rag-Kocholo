        "text": "An instant candidate for the so-bad-it’s-sort-of-great hall of fame, “Jupiter Ascending’’ is totally bonkers, a sort of black-velvet-Elvis mash-up of “Star Wars’’ and every other sci-fi/fantasy movie of the past half-century right up to “The Hunger Games.”\n\nLook, there’s Mila Kunis as another chosen one, spending 10 percent of the movie cleaning toilets! A shirtless Channing Tatum in Mr. Spock ears, trying to pretend he doesn’t love Kunis! And poor Eddie Redmayne — up for Best Actor for “The Theory of Everything” — flamboyantly camping it up (oops, Oscar voting begins Friday) as an intergalactic real estate mogul-cum-mass murderer bent on marrying a clone of his mother.\n\nLana and Andy Wachowski’s nutty, “original’’ plot — I quit counting the homages to other films after passing the 50 mark — is borderline incomprehensible, but that hardly matters in a movie so jaw-droppingly awful that you can’t wait to see what happens next (and that was without the use of mood-altering substances on my part).\n\nThis is the sort of movie where Tatum’s part-canine protector of the chosen one — whom he always addresses as “Your Majesty’’ — says stuff like, “I have more in common with a dog than you!’’ and “We’re not getting off this planet without a fight!”\n\nStill, Tatum comes off better than Redmayne’s 14,000-year-old cross between Donald Trump and Sweeney Todd, who has to keep a straight face while whispering non sequiturs like “My mother never cleaned a toilet in her life!’’ (This is said while also ordering around his minions at the top of his lungs.)\n\nThe toilet-cleaning speech comes while Redmayne’s proposing marriage to Kunis, the chosen one, a poor Russian immigrant he’s had abducted to his far, far-away galaxy because she’s a genetic copy of his murdered mother — and thus, somehow, the rightful heir to her throne. And if he doesn’t marry her, one of his siblings will gain ownership of thousands of planets, including Earth.\n\nGot that? I haven’t even gotten to the part about “harvesting’’ the populations of those planets to provide the royal family with eternal youth (they sure have easier ways in real-life Hollywood). Or a bizarre 10-minute sequence designed to illustrate the Wachowskis’ revelation that “bees are genetically designed to sense royalty.”\n\nLiterally no movie is safe from the Wachowskis’ plundering, which manages to quote both “Brazil’’ and the Harry Potter series (among others) in the most amusing interlude, where Kunis tries to get her claim to the throne validated at a retro-futuristic version of a DMV office.\n\nTheir last film — the ambitious gender-bending and centuries-spanning D.W. Griffith-on-LSD “Cloud Atlas’’ — didn’t hang together as a narrative either, but at least nobody could accuse the Wachowskis of rummaging through the recycling bin for ideas from the likes of David Lynch’s “Dune’’ and their own “Matrix’’ trilogy. This also extends to the new film’s déjà-vu-inducing visuals, which are often less than meets the eye. Still, you won’t be bored by “Jupiter Ascending,’’ and Kunis somehow manages to survive with her dignity intact. Not so Redmayne and Tatum — it’s giving away nothing to reveal that the latter’s fate is basically cribbed from “It’s a Wonderful Life.’’ Or possibly “Wings of Desire.”"
