A variation on “Alice in Wonderland,” with bits of “Willy Wonka” and “Brazil” thrown in ( “Brazil” director Terry Gilliam does a cameo to underscore the connection), “Jupiter” features Mila Kunis as a Russian-American hotel cleaner who shares DNA with an outer-space queen and who gets snared in interplanetary battles as a result.\n\nGive “Jupiter Ascending” creators Andy and Lana Wachowski, whose last film was the mind-bending “Cloud Atlas,” credit: They have ambition. “Jupiter Ascending” is an enormous production, with stunning images such as a temple filled with flickering candles and special effects that are often glorious, coupled with a desire to say something about the environment, love and the way our society tends to treat people who are perceived as different. If that sounds like they may have bitten off more than they can chew, that’s because they have.\n\nJust to get everything in, “Jupiter Ascending” frequently has to stop dead for a character to explain something to us that is both complicated and boring. The romantic element, between Kunis and Channing Tatum as a galactic half-man/half-wolf, is weirdly retro: Kunis is constantly throwing herself at the disinterested Tatum, like Doris Day barking up the wrong Rock Hudson. And the dialogue is bonkers, with Kunis forced to make sense of lines like the following: “My bowels are anything but royal.”\n\nThe other key character is an evil prince played, in bonkers fashion, by current Oscar nominee Eddie Redmayne (“The Theory of Everything”). Most of his dialogue has to do with beheading people, which Redmayne chooses to underplay in a throaty purr that sounds like I imagine Julia Child might have when she was coming out of anesthesia.\n\n“Jupiter Ascending” has the power to make you feel like you’ve been out for a while. The rapid visuals and blurry storytelling are so bewildering — Why did he do that? Where are we now? Whose side is that guy on? — that your best bet may be not to worry about keeping track of everything. Actually, Kunis’ character could be speaking for all of us when she says, early in the film: “Could this get any weirder?”\n\nChris Hewitt can be reached at 651-228-5552.
