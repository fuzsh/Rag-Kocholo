        "text": "Widely considered to be a misfire from the Wachowskis, JUPITER ASCENDING is a typically audacious film from the dynamic directing duo and, it’s true, some may find the sheer nuttiness of it to be too over-the-top… but it is also fantastically entertaining and aggressively weird. Mila Kunis stars as an Earth woman with no prospects who discovers that she is actually an intergalactic heir being tracked by bounty hunters from outer space. Luckily, she has a loyal and handsome protector in the form of half-man/half-canine ex-soldier played by Channing Tatum. Brattle Debut!\n\nBuy a series pass for the Wachowski Sisters program!"
