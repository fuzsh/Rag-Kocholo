        "text": "Many of us have been vocal about what we want from the DVD/blu-ray release of Jupiter Ascending - we want deleted scenes, and we want them ALL (think Veruca Salt from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory).\n\nThe best source for information on how long the script was and what was actually shot is this Collider article (it’s the source of all the quotes in this post).\n\nOn script length, Lana and Andy have this to say:\n\nINTERVIEWER: You created in the film a very rich universe with a lot of layers and depth. How long was your story bible? Did you come up with a book that explains everything or was it in your head and you put on the script page what you needed?\n\nANDY: We don’t really do bibles. We had a fairly extensive timeline because we needed to figure out what the infrastructure was of these space families and these corporations that Earth is a piece of—an asset of. That was fairly extensive. And you have the dinosaurs were here at this point, and okay if you’re farming, at what point are you introducing the human DNA into the species and all that. That was more extensive, timeline-y stuff that we did. But in general our writing is—we always overwrite. All of the backstory to all these characters, including characters that we don’t even meet, are all written and then paired out because our scripts get to be quite lengthy by the end of the process. Jupiter was probably close to 200 pages.\n\nLANA: It was over, I think, 220 because we like to write all the backstory. So, we just write all those scenes.\n\nAs a rule, one page of a script equates to a minute of screentime. So if the script was 220 pages long, that would be equivalent to a 220-minute-long movie. However, not so fast! They didn’t actually shoot everything they had in the script; they deliberately included background material that they never intended to film to help the actors with their characters’ motivations and back stories.\n\nINTERVIEWER: How long was your first cut versus what people are going to see?\n\nLANA: Very close.\n\nANDY: Pretty good.\n\nLANA: 8 minutes we cut out.\n\nANDY: We’ve gotten pretty good at editing. The amount of time we’ve been on an editing room, you can see what’s gonna make it in the movie and what’s not gonna make it in the movie. We’ll go right to the prime. Movie is about their time in real estate, you have a certain amount of time to tell your story. We’re always interested in telling as much story as humanly possible and the way to do that is to go right to what the heart of the scene is.\n\nEssentially, if we are going to see any deleted scenes they will almost certainly be from the eight deleted minutes that Lana refers to in this interview. Hours and hours of footage will have been shot as standard, but only 128 minutes of footage were ever seriously considered for inclusion in the final cut (the final cut of the film, excluding the credits, is 120 minutes long). While I’d love to see those extra eight minutes of footage, I’d advise you not to get your hopes up; I’ve had it pointed out to me that there are no deleted scenes on any of the home media releases of previous Wachowski films, and there is currently no reason to think that Jupiter Ascending will be the exception to the rule."
