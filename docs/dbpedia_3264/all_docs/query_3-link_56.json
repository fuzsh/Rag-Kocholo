        "text": "More on Jupiter Ascending\n\nMovie session times\n\nFull movies coverage\n\n★★★\n\nYou expect certain things from a space opera, especially a space opera starring Mila Kunis as a humble Chicago hotel cleaner named Jupiter Jones, who is kidnapped by a half-albino alien dog-man played by Channing Tatum and learns of her destiny as one of the rulers of the universe.\n\nJupiter Ascending sounds like silly fun, but it isn't quite. In some ways it's surprisingly grim. Unlike, say, Chris Pratt's character in Guardians of the Galaxy, Jupiter doesn't experience the cosmos as a playground waiting to be explored. Rather, what she encounters beyond Earth is the oppressive system she already knows, reproduced on a larger scale.\n\nThe film is the latest from Lana and Andy Wachowski, the creators of The Matrix trilogy, whose special-effects extravaganzas tend to double, not so secretly, as anti-capitalist allegories. Like The Matrix, it is a convoluted Cinderella story: Jupiter happens to have precisely the same DNA as the long-dead matriarch of the unimaginably wealthy and powerful Abrasax dynasty, extraterrestrials who were responsible long ago for \"seeding\" Earth with the ancestors of the human race.\n\nFor the Abrasaxes, genes carry an almost religious significance, and so Jupiter is whisked into outer space where she is wooed and threatened by the three surviving members of the dynasty, feuding siblings played by Douglas Booth, Tuppence Middleton and Eddie Redmayne.\n\nAll three are thousands of years old, speak in refined British accents and enjoy lives of impossible hedonism in palatial spaceships where the decor is part ancient Egyptian, part French Baroque. It is a wish-fulfilment fantasy that comes with a price: without giving too much away, Jupiter has every reason to feel morally uneasy about joining the one per cent.\n\nThe irony here – as in the underrated Speed Racer – is that the Wachowskis themselves are clearly not immune to the attractions of wealth and power. Large amounts of both have been employed to create the film's aerial action sequences, which are extravagant but not all that thrilling. Where directors such as Cecil B. de Mille once specialised in crowd scenes with thousands of extras, here it is as if we are meant to be dazzled by picturing thousands of digital animators in cubicles somewhere out of sight.\n\nLuckily, the bombast is undercut to a fair degree by Kunis – a star whose natural home is romantic comedy, but whose naturally wry, distrustful attitude is equally welcome here. She is especially effective in the early sequences that show Jupiter with her Russian immigrant family, where she is persuasive as both a tough cookie and a dreamer. She has the ability to seem worn down without being quite grown up.\n\nThe other actors have been left to their own devices. As the head villain, Redmayne alternately rasps and bellows his lines, while Tatum appears to put all his energy into keeping a straight face despite wearing elf ears, dark eyeshadow, and a blond beard recalling Will Ferrell in Zoolander.\n\nUnder the circumstances, it's admirable that Jupiter Ascending never collapses into winking camp. While the Wachowskis embrace the absurdity of the genre, there is no reason to think they don't take themselves at least as seriously as the Korean director Bong Joon-ho does in Snowpiercer, a comparably bleak social allegory in gaudy science fiction drag (both films pay overt homage to Terry Gilliam, the great pioneer of retro-futurist pessimism).\n\nThe difference is that Snowpiercer ties up its loose ends in a neat two hours, whereas Jupiter Ascending bows to commercial expectations by presenting itself as the potential first chapter of a longer tale. Thus its moral argument, up to this point, remains incomplete; Jupiter's ascent does nothing to change the structure of a society dominated by the privileged, royal few.\n\nFor that matter, what does the notion of \"royalty\" beyond Earth really mean? Does Jupiter's genetic inheritance truly set her apart – or are Abrasaxes just like ordinary humans after all, aside from their technological ability to regrow their ageing cells? And what do we make of the bizarre revelation that Earth's bees have been \"genetically programmed\" to recognise royal blood, a carefully established plot point that never pays off? Hopefully answers will be supplied in future instalments, if we ever get to see them."
