        "text": "Since blowing cinema apart with ‘The Matrix’ (1999), the Wachowskis haven’t had the easiest run. Their Matrix sequels were not well received, and their follow-ups have all tanked at the box office. That isn’t to say they weren’t worth a look - ‘Speed Racer’ (2008) was harmless if overblown fun, and ‘Cloud Atlas’ was my pick for Best Film of 2012. Fiercely individual and ambitious to a fault, their films aim high and expect their audiences to go with them - and that is certainly the case with ‘Jupiter Ascending’, their latest film now available on Blu-ray. Audiences didn’t seem too taken with this one either, but like their other films, does it actually have genuine merit?\n\nJupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) has her mundane life in Chicago turned upside-down when she finds herself the target of an outer space kidnapping plot. Unbeknownst to her, she is the regeneration of the matriarch of the Abrasax family, an intergalactic dynasty divided between three maniacal heirs (Eddie Redmayne, Douglas Booth and Tuppence Middleton), who all seek to possess Jupiter and the treasures bestowed to her. Her only true ally and protector is Caine Wise (Channing Tatum), a rogue genetically-enhanced soldier who tries to protect Jupiter from an onslaught of attacks from every side.\n\nA space opera in every sense, ‘Jupiter Ascending’ is an enormously ambitious film, and you have to give it some credit for that. The Wachowskis take the basic principles of ‘The Wizard of Oz’ and shoot them into space, aiming to concoct the kind of fantasy sci-fi we very rarely seen these days. The final result though is an unfortunately messy film, oddly paced and ultimately unfulfilling. The basic concepts and ideas are very strong, and this keeps you at least vaguely invested, but the screenplay itself just isn’t strong enough to support them, and apart from Jupiter, the characters aren’t as fleshed out as they should be. There’s a sense of this being only a half-film, like something is missing. At two hours, it feels far too short to hold everything in, and it wouldn’t surprise me if a longer (and possibly stronger) cut exists somewhere. Even the performances are not what they should be, though Kunis is very charming as Jupiter and Redmayne is having a lot of fun with high-camp villain Balem.\n\nCompetition opens at 7:00pm AEST on Sunday 21st June 2015 and closes at 11:59 pm AEST on Sunday 28th June 2015.
