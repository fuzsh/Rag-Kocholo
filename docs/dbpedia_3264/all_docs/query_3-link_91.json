        "text": "How volcanoes erupt\n\nVolcanic eruptions occur as a result of heat moving under Earth’s surface. They often begin with an accumulation of gas-rich magma (molten underground rock) in reservoirs near Earth’s surface, though they may be preceded by emissions of steam and gas from small vents in the ground. Small earthquakes, which may be caused by a rising plug of dense, viscous magma oscillating against a sheath of more permeable magma, may also signal volcanic eruptions, especially explosive ones.\n\nMore From Britannica\n\nvolcano: Volcanic eruptions\n\nIn some cases, magma rises in conduits to the surface as a thin and fluid lava, either flowing out continuously or shooting straight up in glowing fountains or curtains. The eruptions of Hawaii’s volcanoes fall into this category. In other cases, entrapped gases tear the magma into shreds and hurl viscous clots of lava into the air. In more violent eruptions, the magma conduit is hollowed out by an explosive blast, and solid fragments are ejected in a great cloud of ash-laden gas that rises tens of thousands of metres into the air. An example of this phenomenon is the 1980 eruption of Mount Saint Helens. Many explosive eruptions are accompanied by a pyroclastic flow, a fluidized mixture of hot gas and incandescent particles that sweeps down a volcano’s flanks, incinerating everything in its path. If the expelled ash or gases collect on a high snowfield or glacier, they may melt large quantities of ice, and the result can be a disastrous flood or landslide that rushes down a volcano’s slopes.\n\nVolcanic eruptions can also result in secondary damage, beyond the direct loss to life and property from the eruption itself. Volcanic ash can cause respiratory illnesses such as silicosis and can be particularly harmful to infants and people with chronic lung diseases. Gases such as hydrogen chloride, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen fluoride can cause both short- and long-term problems. Eruptions can cause economic harm that affects workers’ livelihoods and can force mass migrations of people in affected regions. The 2010 eruption of Iceland’s Eyjafjallajökull also demonstrated the threat posed to jet aircraft by high clouds of volcanic ash; this eruption led aviation authorities to ground flights across northern and central Europe for several days.\n\nVolcanoes can be classified by the manner in which they erupt. These six types of volcanic eruptions, starting with the least explosive, make up one classification system: Icelandic, Hawaiian, Strombolian, Vulcanian, Pelean, and Plinian. Each name corresponds to a region or to a specific volcano or historical eruption that exemplifies the type.\n\nVolcanic eruptions are not limited to Earth. Jupiter’s moon Io is subject to strong gravitational forces due to Jupiter’s mass as well as interaction with Jupiter’s other moons Europa and Callisto. These forces cause distortions in Io’s shape and make it the most volcanically active body in the solar system. Mars is also known for several volcanoes, with Olympus Mons being the largest known volcano in the solar system. The volcanoes of Mars are shield volcanoes, which have a relatively flat profile, as Mars’s low gravity allows for longer and more widespread lava flows. (According to some estimates, Olympus Mons has been built up by eruptions for more than a billion years, which has resulted in its 700-km [435-mile] diameter.)\n\nVolcanic eruptions in culture\n\nVolcanoes and volcanic eruptions feature in several mythologies and cultural traditions, especially in regions with high volcanic activity. The word volcano is derived from the Latin Volcanus, or Vulcan, the name of the ancient Roman god of fire. The Māori people of New Zealand (Aotearoa)—which lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire—have, in their traditions, a god of volcanoes and earthquakes called Rūaumoko. Pele is the Hawaiian goddess of fire and volcanoes. In Norse mythology, Muspelheim is a hot, glowing land in the south, guarded by Surt, the fire giant.\n\nVolcanic activity is a common feature in fiction too. In the Inferno section of The Divine Comedy (c. 1308–21), Dante describes Hell as an inverted cone, with the last and innermost circle a fiery lake, symbolic of a volcanic crater. In A Journey to the Centre of the Earth (1864) by Jules Verne, the protagonists commence their journey at the Snæfellsjökull volcano in Iceland, and they return to the surface by way of an eruption at Stromboli in the Mediterranean. Verne also set his The Mysterious Island (1874) on a volcanic island, and it ends with the volcano erupting, obliterating the island. In J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings trilogy (1954–55), the Dark Lord Sauron forges the One Ring of Power in the fiery pits of the volcano Mount Doom, where Frodo and Sam go to destroy the ring. The journey to Mount Doom is the primary plot element in the series.\n\nThe 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia—the largest volcanic eruption in recorded history—had a tremendous impact on the world’s climate as well as its culture. Tambora expelled as much as 150 cubic km (roughly 36 cubic miles) of ash, pumice and other rock, and aerosols into the atmosphere. These materials blocked substantial amounts of sunlight from reaching Earth’s surface, eventually reducing the average global temperature by as much as 3 °C (5.4 °F). The following year was called the “year without a summer.” It was during this bleak period that Mary Shelley and her literary circle were confined indoors in Geneva, when she conceived of her masterpiece Frankenstein (1818).\n\nWhen Krakatoa, also in Indonesia, erupted in 1883, the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch, out on a walk, saw the sky turn blood red halfway across the world and later was inspired to paint The Scream in 1893.\n\nFilms have also included their fair share of volcanic eruptions as crucial plot points, from the eruption that ends the tribal conflict in One Million Years B.C. (1966) to the triggered-to-erupt volcanic base of the villain Blofeld in the James Bond film You Only Live Twice (1967) to the very obviously named Volcano (1997), in which Tommy Lee Jones and Anne Heche fight off lava from an erupting volcano in Los Angeles. Famous eruptions in history, such as those of Vesuvius and Mount Saint Helens, have featured in numerous films and TV programs."
