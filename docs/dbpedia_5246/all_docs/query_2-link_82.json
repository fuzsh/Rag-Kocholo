        "text": "Naming conventions in Portugal are unique and quite different from the standard American three-name system: first, middle, and last name. As a result, it is not unheard of in Portugal to have four, five, or possibly even six names!\n\nDespite all the names a Portuguese person may have, there are only two categories first names (nomes próprios) and last names (apellidos). So, for example, the name João Luis Ferreira da Silva would be broken down as first name João Luis and last name Ferreira da Silva.\n\nBy law, a Portuguese person can only have a maximum of six names, two first names and four last names. This is because last names are taken from both sides of the family, and it is common for women to retain their maiden name after marriage.\n\nEven when someone takes their spouse's name, they don’t drop theirs; instead, they simply tack it on to the end. About 4% of married Portuguese men have taken on their wife’s name since it became legal in the 1970s.\n\nIn Portugal, baby names are regulated by law, and there is an approved list of names you can use. However, parents are not allowed to give their baby a name from the opposite gender. In addition, some names are banned to prevent a child from receiving an abusive or offensive name.\n\nPortuguese surnames come from various languages but have a strong Spanish influence. Portuguese last names are also commonly found in the United States, Brazil, and other parts of Europe and South America.\n\nLike many cultures, surnames were influenced by occupations, a person’s father’s first name, and geographical places or structures.\n\nCommon Portuguese Last Names\n\nPortuguese last names carry a rich tapestry of history, culture, and identity, often reflecting the country's exploration, maritime prowess, and deeply ingrained family values.\n\nCarvalho - Portuguese. It means \"oak.\"\n\nCosta - Italian/Spanish. \"From the coast.\n\nCruz - Latin. Christian name, \"from the cross.\"\n\nDe Sousa/D’Sousa - Portuguese.

It means \"forest or woodland.\"\n\nSouza - Portuguese. A person from Sousa.\n\nPatronymic Portuguese Last Names\n\nPatronymic last names are derived from the given name of an ancestor, often the father, signifying lineage and familial connection. This practice, common in Portuguese-speaking cultures, involves utilizing a portion of the father's first name as a surname for the child.\n\nAlves - Portuguese. \"Son of Alvaro.\"\n\nEsteves - Portuguese. \"Son of Steve.\"\n\nFernandez - Spanish. \"Son of Fernando.\" Alternate spelling Fernandes.\n\nGonçalves - Portuguese. \"Son of Gonçalo.\"\n\nHenriques - Portuguese. \"Son of Henrique.\" A variation of the English name Henry.\n\nLopes - Portuguese. \"Son of Lopo.\"\n\nMarques - Portuguese. \"Son of Marcos.\"\n\nMartins - Portuguese. \"Son of Martim.\"\n\nMendes - Portuguese. \"Son of Meno.\"\n\nRodrigues - Spanish. It is the Portuguese version of Rodrigues, \"son of Rodrigo.\"\n\nPersonality and Occupational Portuguese Last Names\n\nPersonality-based surnames might hint at the admired traits of an ancestor. Occupational last names tell the stories of family professions passed down through generations.\n\nAfonso - Portuguese/Old German. \"Noble and ready.\"\n\nBarreto - \"Hatmaker.\"\n\nCarreira - \"Carter.\"\n\nCoelho - The word for \"rabbits\" or \"bunnies.\" Possibly the name used for a hunter.\n\nDa Luz - \"Lady of the night.\"\n\nDos Santos - A religious name for people who become baptized.\n\nFerreira - From the Portuguese word for \"ironmonger or blacksmith\", symbolizing strength and resilience.\n\nMadeira - Portuguese. \"Carpenter.\"\n\nOliveira - Portuguese for \"olive tree\", often representing peace or victory.\n\nPedro - A religious name that stems from Latin for Peter; \"the rock.\"\n\nPinto - Portuguese for \"dark complexion.\"\n\nRamos - Hebrew/Spanish/Portuguese. Its exact origins are unknown; however, it is believed to be a nickname stemming from \"Ram\" and means \"lusty man.\"\n\nSantos - Spanish. A religious name that means \"saint\" or \"holy.\"\n\nTomas - A Portuguese version of Thomas that means \"twin.\"\n\nVara - A name initially used as a nickname that means \"thin as a stick.\"\n\nTopographic and Regional Portuguese Last Names\n\nTopographic and regional surnames often reveal the geographic origins or the landscape features characteristic of the ancestors' dwelling places.\n\nAbreu - Portuguese. A common last name of the Sephardic Jewish community.\n\nAlmeida - Arabic. \"The City.\"\n\nAraujo - A region of Galacia.\n\nBarbosa - Portuguese. \"A place full of green plants.\" Alternative spelling Barboza.\n\nBraga - A city in northern Portugal.\n\nBorges - A name that refers to someone who was from Bourges, France.\n\nCabral - Refers to a goat farmer.

This surname is derived from the Latin word silva, meaning \"wood\" or \"forest\". It is a toponymic surname, indicating that the original bearer lived near or in a forest. The Silva surname can be traced back to the medieval period and has been widely used by families in Portugal and other Portuguese-speaking countries.\n\nWhy Do Portuguese Have 2 Last Names?\n\nPortuguese people often have two last names, known as a \"double surname\" or \"compound surname\". This is because traditional Portuguese naming customs follow the pattern of patrilineal descent, meaning that both the father's and mother's surnames are passed down to their children. The first surname is usually the father's and the second is usually the mother's."
