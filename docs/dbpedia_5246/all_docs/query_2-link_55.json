        "text": "One month into our book publishing venture, 55 Fathoms Publishing, and one thing has become remarkably clear: there are a lot of writers out there who can tell a great story and deserve to have their books published. I know that sounds simplistic, and possibly pollyanna-ish, but sometimes the simple thing has to be said. That’s because in the never ending quest for publication, in the dozens, hundreds, often thousands of rejections a good writer receives in the course of a career, it’s easy for writer to think that they can’t write very well and that they don’t deserve publication.\n\nAlthough we will probably only publish two or three of the hundreds of talented writers who will have submitted to us by the end of the year, we want you to know that if the market were different, and if the finances were different, we would probably want to publish quite a few of you.\n\nWhen you think about it, it’s quite unfair. There is always room for another lawyer or another doctor. There is always room for another teacher or paramedic. There is not a lot of room for good writers.\n\nFrom these simple facts some other things are pretty obvious, but I don’t want to get too deep into the conversation about how most of America doesn’t read very much, or at all, or the comic irony that most Americans would really like to write a book even though they don’t read. Those of us who would love to write for a living—and by this I mean actually write and not teach and review and blog and edit other people’s work—know that there is very little room for us.\n\nI know that it’s similar among some creatives—actors and musicians and dancers and comedians—but it’s not quite the same because a writer must write alone. There’s no group to work things out with, there’s no audience on which to try a new routine. A writer (more like a composer or a painter) performs in isolation. That feeling of being on, and totally focused, comes only when there is no one else to appreciate it. The praise or criticism that comes later is detached from the experience of writing; it is a separate aspect that I consider more a part of the business of writing.\n\nThis is where the blogger is supposed to turn into the coach and offer the encouragement that appeals to the writer’s hope—that boundless vessel of possibility—the one that keeps writers writing in the belief that if they work hard enough and long enough someone will notice, someone with the means to publish their stories. For some this eventually comes true. For most it does not. So I’m not going to say it. Instead I’m going to say that from us to you, we know you are there. Even though we can’t publish as many of you as we would like, we know you have the talent and the drive. And we are with you in mind, in practice, in spirit.\n\n– Joe Ponepinto\n\nThe Literary Issue\n\nThe Brits used to be proud of the saying, “The sun never sets on the British Empire.” Those days are long gone, thankfully, but the phrase came to mind when considering the writers featured in this new issue. Our writers this time hail from Canada, Ireland, Israel, Puerto Rico, and Australia, in addition to the continental United States. Instead of being united by subjugation, these talented people are connected by a passion for writing. So you might say the sun never sets on great storytelling.\n\nThere is movement, however glacial, toward this form of unification. It’s mostly visual and digital, but the core of it is the human need to tell and to hear stories. It is what connects us and what helps break down barriers between us. Perhaps the truth of that lies within the fact that despite our many technological advancements, so many people still take joy in writing and reading the old-fashioned way, in a simple book with words on pages.\n\nWe hope you enjoy this one.\n\n– Joe, Zac, Renee, Marci, David, Zoë, Ronak, Lauren, Ai, and Tommy\n\nTable of Contents (click the links for stories and excerpts)\n\nHunting Crows Year-Round, Phillip Scott Mandel\n\nLove Drips and Gathers, Fiachra Kelleher\n\nA Room for Your Name, Rolando André López Torres\n\nPatrimony, Dave Karrel\n\nThe Leaf Queen, Carolyn Fay\n\nBarbed Wire Fence, Carl Meuser\n\nThe Edge of Elsewhere, Margaret Irish\n\nNo One Looks Up, Julia L.

A pdf is a mere $3, and a print copy is $10.99.\n\nWe’d like to take November’s blog to introduce an upcoming concept issue for our journal. While Orca was founded on our love for literary storytelling, we like to champion any use of rich, carefully crafted language. Some of our favorite novels and short stories fall under the umbrella of genre fiction, but they remain classics in our heart for their wonderful use of language and their broad exploration of imagination.\n\nWith that in mind, beginning with our fourth issue and continuing with every third issue of Orca, we will be celebrating submissions of literary speculative fiction and shining a deserved light on those storytellers who push boundaries and manage to break away from the conventions and tropes of their genre and seek to craft something truly special.\n\nWhat do we mean by the terms Literary and Speculative—and what does it mean when those two worlds combine?\n\nLiterary: A style of writing in which the focus is on language and character, and plot is often secondary. A literary story is about ideas. It has an overarching theme distinct from the narrative and a leitmotif running through it. It treats its characters as real human beings and not as props to espouse an author’s opinion or to simply move the plot forward. It approaches language as art: a literary writer pays attention to every sentence, every word.\n\nSpeculative: The term “speculative” has been employed by writers and editors to connote works from a variety of genres, such as science fiction, fantasy, horror, dystopian, space opera, and similar subjects. All of those genres are welcome, and we hope to celebrate shining examples of them all, but for Orca we are specifically looking for submissions that adhere more closely to the original sense of the word, which is to consider what might be, instead of what is. Think a near-future where the political structure is turned on its head. Think about an alternative present where the South won the Civil War. Imagine a fantastical horror that over the course of ten pages begins to feel all too real. Think Black Mirror and The Twilight Zone. Think “what if….”\n\nBoth definitions pay particular attention to the idea behind the story. Good, literary speculative fiction has its basis in concepts that are larger (often much larger) than the story itself, and seeks to examine one aspect of it, and how that aspect affects the story’s characters.\n\nA great example of excellent literary speculative fiction can be found in the opening paragraph of Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale. Notice how, on its surface the narrator is simply establishing a setting, but then marvel at how, within this description, Atwood manages an incredible amount of world building:\n\nWe slept in what had once been a gymnasium. The floor was of varnished wood, with stripes and circles painted on it, for the games that were formerly played there; the hoops for the basketball nets were still in place, though the nets were gone. A balcony ran around the room, for the spectators, and I thought I could smell, faintly like an afterimage, the pungent scent of sweat shot through with the sweet taint of chewing gum and perfume from the watching girls, felt-skirted as I knew from pictures, later in miniskirt, then pants, then in one earring, spike green-streaked hair. Dances would have been held there; the music lingered, a palimpsest of unheard sound, style upon style, and undercurrent of drums, a forlorn wail, garlands make of up of issue paper flowers, cardboard devils, and a revolving ball of mirrors, powdering the dancers with snow of light.\n\nNot a word is wasted. Notice how the backstory it hints at creates far more questions than answers. Notice how the future being described is done, not through heavy-handed narration or purple prose, but through carefully constructed sensory images that give the novel’s world a full past, present, and future, all in a brief 150 words.\n\nOther great examples of this type of writing include works by Ted Chiang, Kelly Link, Jorge Luis Borges, Ursula K. LeGuin, Julio Cortázar, and Ta-Nehisi Coates latest novel, The Water Dancer. Notice how Chiang’s stories are much more about the people dealing with and affected by the great unknown than they are about defining the unknown itself. Remember that LeGuin was using the lens of science fiction and fantasy to tackle subjects like institutionalized racism and transgender rights long before they were at the forefront of the political realm.\n\nHorror, too, can find a home within the speculative literary world, for what genre better epitomizes the collective sentiment of the human condition that we tend to feel today? In this world of polemics and 24-hour push notifications, who among us can turn on the news or read an article and not be stricken with a sense, false or not, of impending doom?\n\nThere are few better than Shirley Jackson when it comes to writing literary horror. Consider her opening to Hill House and the world it opens up to us, like the day to twilight shift of a full eclipse:\n\nNo organism can continue for long to exist sanely under conditions of absolute reality; even larks and katydids are supposed, by some, to dream. Hill House, not sane, stood by itself against its hills, holding darkness within; it had stood so for eighty years and might stand for eighty more. Within, walls continued upright, bricks met neatly, floors were firm, and doors were sensibly shut; silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House, and whatever walked there, walked alone.\n\nOne of literature’s most ominous openings. More examples of great literary horror can be found in the works of: Robert W. Chambers, Alma Katsu, Neil Gaiman, and Stephen King.\n\nWhile we want to keep this upcoming issue open to all types of literary speculative fiction, it is unlikely that we would publish anything considered high fantasy or hard sci-fi. So too, would we be likely to pass on anything that focuses on extreme gore, violence, or eroticism. All of those can be great tools for a skilled writer, but only when used sparingly.\n\nConsider this thematic issue our challenge to the many writers who have submitted to us in the past, to break away from the mold and to craft something boldly imaginative. To pose a “what if…,” explore it, and perhaps, even attempt to answer it. We cannot wait to read your submissions!\n\n– Zac and Joe\n\nIssue 16:\n\nThe Literary-Speculative Issue\n\nOrca prides itself on being a literary journal—a very literary journal. We’re one of the toughest markets to crack, according to Duotrope. What are we doing producing a speculative issue every year?\n\nThe two styles might seem, on the surface, incompatible. Deeply nuanced and intelligent stories about…evil aliens? Zombies? Superheroes? We’ll leave that stuff to Hollywood (whose target audience is twelve-year-old boys, let us remind you). So what’s the connection?\n\nGood fiction is mostly about character, how realistic people cope with the problems of life. How they try to find happiness, contentment, or at least acceptance amid the hell that is, as Sartre said, other people. Those people have issues: phobias, hangups, irrational traits, strange beliefs that can seem otherworldly. And people die. We have a lot of death in this issue. Since we don’t know what happens after someone dies, the idea haunts us. The dead themselves may haunt us.\n\nThe literary and speculative worlds are much closer than most people think. With a little imagination they become inseparable. This issue features some of the best stories we’ve seen that combine the two realms. A young boy becomes a house to shelter his family. A blood pact alters the lives of two children. A musician befriends a discarded doll. The Greek muse of tragedy takes her daughter to school. Every story in this issue was one that intrigued and excited the staff, and made us want to accept it before another journal could.\n\nThe speculative may be as much a part of real life as reality. Surrender to your imagination and see if the stories in this issue can confirm it.\n\nTable of Contents (click the links for stories and excerpts–they will become active on June 1)\n\nAbout the Cover Artist\n\nThe Old Kind of Memory, Noah Evan Wilson\n\nThe Scientists, Katie Mora\n\nRed Touches Black, Nicole Lynn\n\nMelpomene in the Drop-Off Line, Andrea Cavedo\n\nBartolomeu, Charlotte Gartenberg\n\nWater Spirit, Ivy Goodman\n\nWishbone, Deidre Cavazzi\n\nNo Room at the Oasis, Joel Fishbane\n\nTo Have and to Hold, Emilee Prado\n\nYour Lover Smells of Death, Ellis Patterson\n\nVenerable Soil, Logan Garner\n\nSnared, Linda Woolford\n\nContributors\n\nPlease consider purchasing a copy of the full issue.
