        "text": "Over the last decades, progress in medical technology such as fMRI provides us with neuroscientific models and theories on human brain function and consciousness. I will first present the models of Computational Neuroscience (Patricia Churchland et al., 1988), which conceive brain function in terms of the information-processing properties. I then question, if this theory promotes a form of neuro-reductionism that equates the brain with the mind, and leaves social and anthropological traits on the side, and also, complex phenomena like human behavior, mainly through Emily Martin, Steven Rose, Laurence J.Krimayer and Ian Gold. I will compare these models with the theory of Neuron Mirrors which could provide a more intersubjective view and asserts that the body-brain systems of two different individuals share a common function, and thus we have a “mirroring” or “simulation” of their respective brain areas (Rizzolatti et al., 1988, Gallese et al., 1996, 2001) and Antonio Damasio’s Somatic Feedback Theory which speaks about necessary participation of the body (Damasio et al., 2000). After these epistemological aspects, I will uncover a possible relation with a particular type of phenomenology, called speculative. A brief overview, of classical phenomenology, will be the transition to a non-correlational approach of our opening to the world which demands the participation of the body and brain as a whole. But this ‘’world’’ in our analysis is given with the term ‘’ Dehors’’, is a certain type of the confusing, the unknown, of the chaos which adopts formalizations and places being in restrictions, which may lead to a total collapse of the dialectics of a horizon, something I call ‘’asymvatotita’’.\n\nThe Body in the Mind Meets the Body Without Organs: Francisco Varela and Gilles Deleuze Critique Lakoff, Johnson and Turner 1996 Conference of the Society for Literature and Science Atlanta, Georgia, October 10 - 13, 1996 The Cultural Work of Cognitive Science: Session 2F Martin E. Rosenberg, Eastern Kentucky University The influential claims of Lakoff, Johnson and Turner for an epistemological and moral. imagination grounded by the bodily basis for meaning deserve to be tested against the work of cognitive scientist Fransisco Varela and the philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. Fransisco Varela, in his The Embodied Mind (Co-authored with Eleanor Rosch and Evan Thompson), argues that consciousness involves two antithetical though perhaps complementary cognitive processes: bottom-up emergence, which is necessarily contingent and which involves the spontaneous confluence of heterogeneic lower-order processes into a global state; and top-down repression of those heterogeneic processes, often described as a superimposition of categories or schema onto complex sensory data in a way resonant with the epistemological legacy of Immanuel Kant. So, while the \"global state\" is indeed a fiction, it constitutes a fiction necessary to ensure the survival of the aggregate, which may refer to a computer or a human being, or even a bureaucratic system. This distinction becomes interesting from the perspectives of epistemology and social philosophy in the following way: for the first, the emphasis is placed on the total control of the trajectories of symbolic manipulation; any loss of control brings down the computational house. For the second, the emphasis is placed on the connections among elements of systems, the deliberate relinquishing of control of those elements, and the observance of the contingent emergence of new forms of order among the connected elements that might not necessarily be predicted. The top-down exertion of control, and the contingencies of bottomup emergence, represent epistemological and ideological stances toward cognitive functioning, and in the study of human cognition, there is no question that both processes go on simultaneously, and perhaps even at cross purposes. I would like to argue that Deleuze and Guattari, among all social philosophers, have played out the ideological implications of these two styles of cognitive functioning through their writings concerning the rhizome and, more important, the Body Without Organs (BWO), a term which refers to what might be called a preexisting condition of wholeness. In other words, the BWO is the Global State itself, a field of immanence from which emanate both bottom-up emergences and top-down constraints, the reductio ad absurdum of which is the schizophrenic dream of the rubber body suit without any openings for breathing, eating, defecating. Consistently described in terms of the spherical wholeness of the egg prior to the complete formation of the embryo, in terms of hierarchical strata and of planes of consistency through which rhizomes must propagate but only by avoiding detection, the BWO constitutes the regime through which the exertion of constraints on various becomings may occur. Philosophically represented by Spinoza's ethics, psychoanalytically represented by the analysts' intrusion in the imaginary and symbolic formations of the patient, by the betrayal of desire in the form of the hypochondriac body, the schizoid body, the drugged body, the masochist body, the BWO can be understood simply as the superimposition of constraints on the lower order cognitive processes emanating from the organs of the body or from the nervous, autonomic, circulatory and immune systems. This correlation between bottom-up and top-down cognitive and social processes may help to frame a discussion of why Lakoff, Johnson, and Turner's assumption of the bodily basis for meaning is finally unsatisfactory. We will begin by questioning the cognitive schema and metaphorical and moral extensions of the term \"balance,\" made concrete through a critique of Mark Johnson's reference in The Body in the Mind to Michael Polanyi's discussion of the bicycle rider from Personal Knowledge as paradigmatic of their claims for the embodied origins of metaphoricity."
