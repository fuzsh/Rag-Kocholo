        "text": "Overview\n\nThe Economic Development Commission was established under M.G.L c.40 section 8A in order to expand and strengthen the local economy. It is the result of the October 30, 2023 Special Town Meeting vote that renamed the Industrial Development Commission to the Economic Development Commission, and reduced the number of members from eleven to seven.\n\nThe Industrial Development Commission had originally been established at the Special Town Meeting of August 16, 1978. The Economic Development Commission is comprised of Select Board appointed representatives from local government, the business community, and interested citizens.\n\nThe Economic Development Commission typically meets on the third Thursday of each month at 4 pm in the Town Hall, 52 Main Street, Milford, MA 01757. The commission continues to use Milford's 2003 Comprehensive Plan, adopted by the Planning Board as a guide to its program and project implementation."
