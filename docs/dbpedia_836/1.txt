Romania’s geographical position in Europe

With an area of 238,391 square kilometers (91843 square miles) , she is located in the SE of Central Europe, more exactly, in the north of Balkan Peninsula. Romania lies between 43 ° 37 ’07”and 48 ° 15′ 06” north latitude and 20 ° 15 ’44”and 29 ° 41′ 24”east longitude. Parallel 45 ° (midway between the Equator and North Pole) crosses Romania 70 km north of the capital and meridian 25 ° east longitude (midway between the Atlantic coast and the Urals) runs 90 km west of Bucharest.

Romanian borders

Romania’s neighbors to the north and east are the Republic of Ukraine and Moldova, on the west Hungary, south-west Serbia, Bulgaria to the south and south-eastern Black Sea. Two thirds of the border is crossed by rivers like Danube, Prut, Tisa and seaside (Black Sea) and one third is represented by land.

The landscape

For those that visited Romania, they can say that nature was very generous with this land, giving not only varied landscape but also well distributed, with towering mountains, plains, Black Sea and beyond.

The landscape is arranged in three major levels which are very well-differentiated: the highest representatives are the Carpathian Mountains, the middle are Subcarpathians and hills and plateaus, and the lowest one of the plains are the rivers and Delta.

Mountains extending in an arc in the central part of the country, are covering 31% from the country, hills and plateaus occupy 36%, and plains that lie south and west of the country occupy 33%. In the center of the country is the Transylvanian Plateau with an altitude of 400-600m being surrounded by a mountain chain that has the highest peak of 2544, top Moldovanu.

To the east and south it continues with the Subcarpathians.They have a similar genesis heights of the mountains but smaller (1000-500m), and to the west are lying the West Hills, not exceeding 300-400 m altitude. In east and southeast lie second plateaus – Moldova and Dobrogea Plateau Plateau with altitudes between 400 and 600 meters.

Romanian plains, representing bottoms of old seas or lakes, they cover both the south and the west of the country. Between the Carpathians and the Danube lies the so called “granary” of the country or the Romanian Plain. In the west side of the country lies the Western Plain, crossed by many rives.

The hydrography

Rivers are arranged in radial form, 98% from them flowing from the Carpathians and shedding directly or through other rivers in the Danube. The second longest river in Europe, the Danube (2860 km), is 1075 km in Romania. It flows into the Black Sea through three arms (Chilia, Sulina and Sf Gheorghe) which form a delta. The main rivers are: Mures (761 km in Romania), Prut (742 km in Romania), Olt (615 km), Siret (559 km in Romania), Ialomita (417 km), Somes (376 km in Romania ), Arges (350 km).

In Romania there are many lakes (about 3500) but not all are large. Unfortunately only a percentage of 0.9% are lakes with an area of ​​over 1 km square. The most important lakes from the former lagoon on the Black Sea coast:

Razim 425 km square

Sinoe 171 km square

Lakes formed along the banks of the Danube are:

Oltenia 22 km square,

Brates 21 km square).

Glacial lakes are found in the Carpathian Mountains (Lake Bucura, with an area of 10.8 hectares is the largest of them). Besides these there are man-made lakes, important for the power, they store energy, most notably those on the Danube:

Iron Gates II (40,000 ha)

Iron Gates I (10,000 ha, but with a volume water of 2,400 million cubic meters – three times more than the Iron Gates II)

Stanca-Costesti (5900 ha) on the Prut river.

Danube River

Is the second river in Europe in size and the flow (after the Volga), with 2860 kilometers of which 1050 km are in Romania.The basin area is 817,000 square kilometers. It springs from the Black Forest Mountains. Lower sector, from the mouth to the shedding, Baziaş has 1075 km, of which 144 km are driven through a gorge, with a section called ‘Cazane.” Danube is an important international river,from the point of view of transportation flowing through 10 countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Moldova, Slovakia, Romania, Ukraine, Serbia) and has tributaries in seven countries. also it flows through four state capitals: Vienna, Bratislava, Budapest and Belgrade.

Mures River (Maris)

The second longest river in Romania after the Danube River is a tributary of the River Tisa. It has 803 km of which 761 km on Romanian territory. It springs from Hasmas Mountains (Eastern Carpathians), it passes through Giurgeu Depression, crosses Calimani and Gurghiu ( through the gorge Topliţa-Deda, 50 kilometers long). After that it crosses the central part of Transylvania Plateau (passing through cities like Reghin, Targu-Mures, Iernut Aiud), enters the Arad Plain, passes through Arad city and goes west of the city Nadlac making the border between Romania and Hungary (31 miles). After entering Hungary it flows into the Tisza.

Tisza River:

It is a tributary of the Danube, with 960 kilometers. Springs from Ukraine and after, on 62 km, it forms the border between Romania and Ukraine. After, the river crosses the East Pannonian Plain and confluences with the Danube in Serbia, upstream of Belgrade. Main tributaries are: Somes, Cris and Mures (Romania).

Prut River

It is 953 km long and flows from the Carpathians in Ukraine, flowing eastward. Flows into the Danube near Reni, east of the city of Galati. Forms the border between Romania and Moldova. In the interwar period, the river was navigable up to Ungheni, but during the communist navigation on the river was gradually abandoned by the Romanians , maintained no longer than the channel part of Moldova to Leova. Unfortunately it has low speeds (over two and a half timessmaller than the Siret). The main tributary on the right is Jijia with Bahlui and Başeu tributaries. There are on the Prut hydroelectric like Stanca-Costesti, made ​​with the USSR. It is the second longest river which flows on Romanian territory.

Siret River:

Springs from the northern Carpathians in Ukraine. It runs on 706 km and flows into the Danube, near Galati. The river has the largest basin in the country and it is the largest internal river flowing in Romania – an annual average flow of over 225 m/s from shedding. The main tributaries of the Siret are on the right, Suceava, Moldova, Bistrita,Trotus, Putna and Buzau and on the left side is Barlad. In his course, were made, ​​during the communist period more dams and reservoirs, reducing, not eliminating, the threat of floods (the most recent was in 2005). The main cities on or near its course are: Siret, Pascani, Roman, Bacau and Galati Adjud.

The Climate

Climate is temperate continental, with relatively low rainfall and differences between seasons.

Summer is a warm season, which lasts from late May to mid September in the plains of South and West. In southern Romania there are over 25 days “tropical” (with above 30, even 35 C) and 90 days of summer (with temperatures above 25-30 C). Absolute maximum temperature in Romania is +44.5°C, and was recorded at Ion Sion, near Braila, on 08/10/1951. Often, summer storms occur with large amounts of rainfalls.

Autumn is a shorter season and in transition.

It has long dry periods alternating with periods of rain. In the second part, frosts of October come and in November the first snow.

In the plains, they often manifest later than the rest of the country.

Winter is a cold season, the cold air masses coming from the East bring temperatures down to -20 C or below (the record is -38.5 to Bod, near Brasov, registered on 25.01.1942). Snow is not abundant compared to other European countries. In South and West in particular, the snow melts and rebuild several times over a winter.

Spring is another season of transition, relatively short. Temperature rises rapidly, frosts disappearing in April.

The average annual temperature varies from 11C in the Danube valley, to 6C in Harghita.

The July average temperature varies between 26 C and 18 C, depending on the regions.

In January, the temperature range from 0 C (in Baile Herculane orMangalia) at – 6 C (depression).

Rainfall is moderate. From insufficient amount of 400 mm to 500 mm in Dobrogea in Romanian Plain to 600 mm in the West. With the altitude, rainfall increases over 1000 mm per year, in some places. At altitudes above 1800 m, precipitation value of 1000-1200 mm / year. The annual average rainfall, following the gradual decrease of oceanic and Mediterranean influences, decreases slightly from west to east.

Average annual rainfalls (calculated across) is 637 mm annually, with values ​​significantly higher in mountain areas (1000-1400 mm / year) and progressively lower towards east. Baragan is 500 mm / year, and Dobrogea and Danube Delta down to 400mm / year.

Vegetation.

Forests, which in ancient and medieval times were covering almost the entire surface of Romania (except southeast), gradually gave way to farmland. Nowadays forests occupy 26.2% (6.366 million ha) of the country, consisting of beech forest (about 2 million ha), oak (1.1 million ha), coniferous forests (1.9million ha). They also met other species such as hornbeam, poplar, ash, lime. Alpine grasslands cover large areas at altitudes exceeding 1,800 m and are used mainly for sheep breeding. Over 400,000 ha (6.3% of total area) are clearly affected (became dry) by pollution with sulfur compounds or other compounds coming from industrial emissions.

The fauna

Fauna of Romania was and still is one of the richest and most varied in Europe,containing rare or even unique species on the continent.

Chamois, brown bear, the Carpathian stag, wolf, lynx, marten, grouse are species that inhabit the mountains, rabbits, foxes, wild boars, deer, partridge are met on hills and plains. Delta with an area of 5,050 sq.km. (of which4.340 km square in Romania) remains a sanctuary of wild birds and fish (carp,pike, perch, catfish, etc.).

Sturgeon (from which caviar is obtained) can be found on the lower Danube and dolphins, herrings, seahorses in the Black Sea. Over-fishing and pollution increase (plus poaching in recent years) have significantly reduced the amount over the past two decades. Extending populated areas reduced animals freedom of movement and hunting resources fell by 10-20% in recent years.

Population

The last census was held in 2002, when it was stated that Romania had 21.5 million inhabitants. Romania’s population declined in March compared to February with 7775 people. Were registered nearly 16,000 babies and over 23 500 people died, informs on Wednesday, the National Statistics Institute (NSI). Next year, in October, will be population and housing census. First results will be available in March 2012, the first preliminary data in June 2012 and final results will be released by 2013.

Density (1998): 94.5 inhabitants / sq km, almost the same as in Austria or Slovenia, ranked 74th place in the world and 26th in Europe.

Ethnic structure

According to the census from date of January 7, 1992 Romania’ s population was 22,810,035 of whom 20,408,542 (89.4%) Romanians and 2,401,493 (10.6%) ethnic minorities.

The Capital

Bucharest is Romania’s capital and at the same time, the largest city, industrial and commercial center of the country. Population of 1,944, 367 inhabitants (1 January 2009) shows that Bucharest is the sixth city in population in the EU.

Infact, however, Bucharest gather daily over three million people, and experts predict that over the next five years, the total will exceed four million. Add to this the fact that the settlements around the city, which will be part of future metropolitan area population, totals about 430,000 inhabitants. Located in the south, in the Romanian Plain (altitude 85 m), the city dates from the 14th century and is first attested in 1459 as residence of Prince Vlad Tepes. It was the capital of Wallachia between 17 and 19 centuries and of Romania in1862.
