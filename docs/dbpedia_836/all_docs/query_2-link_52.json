It was supplied with water from the nearby town of Foz do Cunene, at the mouth of the Cunene River. In the 1970s, Saint Martin of the Tigers was cut off from the mainland by the rising sea levels, and its water supply line was severed; both Tigres and Foz do Cunene were subsequently abandoned.[1][2] The island, bound by the South Atlantic Ocean and the Tigres Strait, lies in a zone that is ideally suited for ecological projects.[3] The island was mentioned in the BBC documentary \"Unknown Africa: Angola\".\n\nFoz do Cunene, located near Saint Martin of the Tigers and similarly abandoned due to rising sea levels.\n\nNova Cidade de Kilamba was an under-occupied development built by China International Trust and Investment Company near Luanda.[4] Although the city's population eventually grew,[5] in early days it was heralded as a ghost town and predicted to stay that way.[4]\n\nGoroumo, Beogombo Deux, and Paoua are among the many deserted villages created by the actions of government forces and killings by armed gangs from the years 2005 to 2008.[6][7]\n\nLere, Central African Republic.[8]\n\nAvshalom, Dikla, Nahal Yam, Netiv HaAsara, Sufa, Talmei Yosef, Yamit, and Pri'el were Israeli settlements in the Sinai built after the Six-Day War in 1967.
