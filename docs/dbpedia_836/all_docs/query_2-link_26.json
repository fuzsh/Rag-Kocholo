        "text": "This report provides the results of Work Package 7 (WP7). WP7 focuses on the integration of methodological approaches across scales and provides guidelines for policy development in the context of sediment and large wood management. Two guidelines with methodological explanations and good practice examples are provided as expected output of this WP. The contents of the first guideline are the estimation of sediment budget and scenarios determination to be used for flood mitigation in Alpine basins. The identification of morphological impacts related to hydropower plants and gravel extraction is dealt with in the second guideline. Sediment budget analysis consists in the evaluation of fluxes, sources and sinks from different processes. Different factors influence sediment and wood transport and need to be carefully evaluated within specific spatial and temporal scales. Correct approaches and tools to estimate sediment and wood budget that consider the river reach of interest, with it...\n\nIn recent years, lightweight, inexpensive, vessel-mounted 'recreational grade' sonar systems have rapidly grown in popularity among aquatic scientists, for swath imaging of benthic substrates. To promote an ongoing 'democratization' of acoustical imaging of shallow water environments, methods to carry out geometric and radiometric correction and georectification of sonar echograms are presented, based on simplified models for sonar-target geometry and acoustic backscattering and attenuation in shallow water. Procedures are described for automated removal of the acoustic shadows, identification of bed-water interface for situations when the water is too turbid or turbulent for reliable depth echosound-ing, and for automated bed substrate classification based on singlebeam full-waveform analysis. These methods are encoded in an open-source and freely-available software package, which should further facilitate use of recreational-grade sidescan sonar, in a fully automated and objective manner. The sequential correction, mapping, and analysis steps are demonstrated using a data set from a shallow freshwater environment.\n\nHydrographic surveying in reservoirs is a key activity in order to collect data for a variety of purposes like estimation of storage capacity, rate and pattern of sediment deposition, movement of underwater sediment delta and reservoir routing, etc. These parameters play a pivotal role in any planning, management and operation activity of the reservoirs. Traditional approaches to perform hydrographic surveying in Indus Basin are time consuming, laborious, comparatively inaccurate and costly. As water resources are under immense pressure due to a variety of factors, such inefficient methods are not acceptable for efficient water management. In this study, an integrated approach for hydrographic surveying is introduced and evaluated in terms of its efficiency in comparison with the traditional methods of hydrographic surveying. The approach develops an integrated environment of hydrographic surveying comprising human, hardware and software. The process of surveying starts from in-house planning using specialized geo-spatial softwares. Then, on site a combination of computer hardware, echosounder, differential global positioning system (DGPS), survey vessel and survey crew is made. Post-processing is performed after conducting a survey in order to improve quality of data by filtering errors and producing the end product like reservoir underwater terrain, development of reservoir stage-area and stage-storage relationships, etc. The study was applied to Tarbela Reservoir, Pakistan.\n\nThis thesis assesses the application and effectiveness of consumer-grade sonar instruments for documenting inundated archaeological sites across Northwestern Ontario. Although the use of bathymetry and side scan sonar is commonly used by marine archaeologists, the acquisition of such data can be extremely costly, while also cumbersome in shallow water environments. Many Northwestern Ontario lakes and rivers have complicated histories involving both human-made and natural lake-level changes that have degraded and inundated shorelines containing archaeological resources. Four case studies throughout the Thunder Bay region were assessed using an inexpensive hull-mounted sonar system to test whether the instruments provide sufficient precision and resolution for further archaeological investigations.\n\nAbstract Romania represents one of Europe’s most active landslide hotspots. The importance of studying these phenomena is both fundamental (establishing the morphogenetic and morphodynamic frameworks) and applied (quantifying and predicting the potential losses inflicted by such processes). The analysis of agents–processes–forms can be directed toward predictive assessments through susceptibility–hazard–risk studies. The complexity of landslides conditioning factors as well as the available data in terms of quantity (multi-temporal and typological more or less complete landslide inventories) and quality (point and polygon-based inventories, uncertainties induced by the correlation between the used method and the working scale) are imposing local-to-regional and regional-to-national approaches, aiming to highlight, in a predictive manner (based either on heuristic, statistic, or probabilistic predictions) the spatial and temporal sequences more or less prone to future processes, as well as the potential consequences and their mitigation strategies.\n\nStanca-Costesti Reservoir holds the largest amount of water among reservoirs located in Romania and has multiple purposes, such as flood mitigation, hydropower production, irrigation etc. Our bathymetric survey was conducted along longitudinal, as well as transverse alignments, so as to cover the entire lacustrine surface by using an echo-sounder. Data from three different surveys were employed, i.e. topographical (dating back to 1977, before the onset of flooding) and bathymetrical (1986 and 2000) surveys. The drainage basin of this reservoir extends across three countries, Romania, Ukraine and Republic of Moldova, and whereas the mountain sector of the basin is mostly covered by forest, the lowland (the Moldavian Plateau) is used for agriculture, i.e., cereal crops. Thus, deforestation and inappropriate tillage techniques employed within this basin result in increased soil erosion. Most of the sediment load is carried during flood events, which have grown increasingly common, particularly in summer. The terraces formed along the downstream sector of the reservoir are not covered by alluvium, whereas the corresponding terraces from its upper sector have been covered by submerged glacises. Moreover, in the area of Ciugur river mouth we observed a submerged valley, as well as several submerged natural levees. The deepest area of the reservoir (29.2 m) is located adjacent to the dam and is thought to be the outcome of a circular current generated by the lake bottom morphology. The silting degree is rather high, ranging up to an index value of 7.3% over 33 years."
