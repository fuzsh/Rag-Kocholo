        "text": "In 1916, before the United States entered the “War to end all Wars,” American President Woodrow Wilson proposed a League of Nations to maintain international stability and prevent future conflict. Designed as a mediating body to prevent war among nations of the world, the League could impose economic sanctions but could not uphold its own mandates with military force. When the victorious European nations punished the Triple Alliance for starting the Great War, support for Wilson’s League collapsed in the United States. The Senate subsequently rejected the League’s charter, preventing an American role in the organization. Lacking American participation and without any appreciable military power, League sanctions failed to stop the rise of aggressive regimes in Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan in the 1930s.\n\nBecause of the League’s impotency, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill agreed in the 1941 Atlantic Charter that a “permanent system of general security” was needed in the post-WWII world. When Soviet entry into the war threatened the European balance of power, President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill secured approval for an international peacekeeping organization from Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin at the Teheran Conference in 1943. Two weeks after President Roosevelt’s death in 1945, delegates from fifty nations at war with Germany and Japan met in San Francisco, California to draft the charter for the United Nations (UN). On 25 June 1945, the delegates unanimously approved a UN comprised of a General Assembly (the policy-making body with representatives from all member nations), a Secretariat (the Secretary General and administrative apparatus), and a Security Council (represented permanently by ambassadors from the “Big Five” â U.S., Great Britain, U.S.S.R., France, and China â plus six other nations on rotating two-year terms). Unlike the General Assembly, which met annually, the Security Council remained in constant session to mediate any emerging international dispute, with permanent members possessing the power to veto any council resolution. This new organization represented a significant improvement over the League of Nations because the UN could levy economic and diplomatic sanctions and use military force to settle international disputes.\n\nIn 1946, the UN General Assembly held its inaugural session in London. By the end of the first meeting, Cold War attitudes emerged, as both the U.S. and the Soviet Union denounced each other in the General Assembly and the Security Council. The second General Assembly, however, supported Korean independence, creating the UN Temporary Commission on Korea (UNTCOK) to observe future elections in the divided country. While UNTCOK supervised elections in South Korea in February 1948, the Soviets denied access to international commissioners observing elections in the north.\n\nAt the time of the North Korean invasion in 1950, the U.S. and the Soviet Union were again at odds in the UN. The Soviet Ambassador boycotted the Security Council’s meeting because the council refused to seat Communist China. This absence precluded a Soviet veto of the Security Council resolution to stop the invasion of South Korea and name General Douglas A. MacArthur as Commander in Chief, United Nations Command (CINCUNC). While subsequent military action in Korea remained a UN mission, the U.S. provided ninety percent of the forces, and command remained wholly in American hands throughout the course of the war. Nonetheless, the conflict marked the first time that the UN mobilized member military forces to mediate an international conflict, establishing a precedent that continues today."
