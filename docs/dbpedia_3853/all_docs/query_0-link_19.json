        "text": "According to Document C, on June 25, 1950, North Korea suddenly invaded South Korea. North Korea was supported by the Soviet Union, while South Korea was being supported by the U.S. president, Harry Truman, and the United Nations promised to defend South Korea. After World War 2, on September 14, 1950, the U.S. and the U.N. were officially sent to protect South Korea, but the U.S. and the United Nation’s forces were almost pushed off the Korean peninsula. The leader of the Americans, was General Douglass MacArthur. On November 25, 1950, General MacArthur organized a dangerous, yet victorious retaliation at the port of Inchon. The Americans pushed the North Korean forces all the way back to the border of North Korea and communist China, but this battle got difficult again because China got involved and pushed the Americans back to South Korea. Over two million people died in this war as well as more than fifty thousand American soldiers. This act of containment in a way made the U.S. look kind of weak, because there were a lot of deaths and suffering before it ended therefore making their system look\n\nThe war began on June 25, 1950, with communist North Korea’s invasion of South Korea. (Document C) With support from the Soviet Union, North Korea attacked democratic South Korea without warning. Since, South Korea was US supported, president Truman vowed to help defend it along with the United Nations. On September 14, 1950, America sent its forces in Japan to defend South Korea, though this resulted in the forces nearly being pushed off the Korean peninsula. The commander of the American forces at the time was General Douglas Macarthur, who planned a counterattack of the port of Inchon, on November 25, 1950. The attack was successful, it pushed back the North Korean forces to its border between it and China; the Yalu River. In November of 1950, China decided to enter the war to support North Korea's spread of communism. Chinese forces are able to push the UN and the US back into South Korea. This resulted in the border between North and South Korea to move back to where it was originally. The war finally ended three years later on July 27, 1953. The Korean War is a good example of containment because the United States was successful in preventing North Korea from expanding communism into South\n\nOvershadowed by the previous, long and devastating Second World War, the Korean War became known by Canadian veterans as the \"Forgotten War\". After Japan's defeat in World War II, Korea was split into two parts, North Korea and South Korea. North Korea was occupied by the communist country of USSR while South Korea was held by the Americans and other democratic nations. War officially broke out on June 25, 1950, when the North Koreans assaulted across the country's division on the 38th Parallel with their men and artillery behind them. North Korea and its leaders wanted to unify the whole country from its division by taking over South Korea under their government. North Korea was allied with China and the Republic of Korea was\n\nThe Cold War was a period of tension that affected the Koreans along with the Soviet Union and the United States, and North Korea and South Korea were areas in which the superpowers backed the Northern half and the Southern half, respectively. In order to take over South Korea, Japanese Communists were sent into the nation, and Soviet Communists had started to cut communications at the 38th parallel. North Korean forces, led by Kim Il Sung, made their way towards South Korea on June 25, 1950. The United States and President Truman had wasted no time in order to help South Korea from their Northern rivals. The Soviet Union provided weapons to North Korea, which had an effect on the amount of American soldiers had lost their lives. Also, the effect of the communication cutoff was not good for South Korea as it showed the capabilities of the Soviet Union. The North Korean forces had an impactful effect as it displayed that the\n\nThe Korean War begun far before North Korea had launched their first assault upon South Korea. Nearing of the end of the Second World War, the Korean Peninsula had been under Japanese control. Soon enough it was liberated by both American and Soviet forces, the Soviets occupying the country north of the 38th Parallel, and the Americans south of it. After the war, neither the Koreans, Soviets, nor the Americans could agree on the country's government. This resulted in the foundation of the Republic of Korea (ROK) in the south and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the north (Ohn Chang-Il, 23). The fact that neither the States nor the Soviets were willing to compromise on anything was a prime factor in the separation of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nCounting the years, it is necessary to mention that it passed more than sixty years since the beginning of the war on the Korean peninsula. Throughout the war, many individuals has different interpretations on how the war really went down. Some blamed the United States for causing the war, however Brian Myers looked further and discovered that originally they (the people) did not blame America for starting the war. The only reason why the United States got involved in the Korean War was to provide aid to South Korea. The Americans aligned with the Korean conservatives in the South, while the Soviets sided with the liberals in the North. Undergoing and visualizing all of the facts that was provided proves how the Korean War began and who really started it. Afterall, the relationship between North Korea and the United States isn’t a steady relationship due to the fact that both countries don’t see eye to eye on certain agreements.\n\nJune 25, 1950, The Korean war begins, it was the first battle of the Cold War, and the first proxy war that was fought with America. On June 27, 1950, President Truman orders the U.S air and naval forces to South Korea to help South Korea. July 7th came around and President Truman decided to send U.S ground forces to Korea. About 150,000 troops from South Korea, The United States, and participating U.N. Nations were killed in the Korean War. This was a failure. We got involved with this war for it to go the way things were before the\n\nThe Korean War existed as a bi product to the hegemonic struggle between the contrasting political views of communism and capitalism. The event became the first military conflict of the Cold War between the US and Soviet Union, and it commenced on June 25th, 1950. These powers would continue to battle through the use of surrogate wars and political propaganda. War began to change exponentially with technology, and atomic warfare threatening, and still threatens, the life on earth. War changed to a mutually assured destruction. As a result the Korean War never truly ended, the Cold War carried on, and the 38th parallel still divides the North and South. From an American perspective, the Korean War contributed to the Cold\n\nThe Korean War was Kim’s idea of reunification through the use of military force. * Soviet Union did not even want to be involved in a war. It was Kim’s idea to get the go ahead with the war and launch the attack against the South. * Most of the soldiers involved were Korean and Chinese, and fought for their own cause of reunification or liberation. 260,000 North Korean, 926,000 Chinese and 590,911 South Korean soldiers involved. * Soviet and American soldiers were not as heavily involved in the fighting, and mostly did so for their political security rather as a desire to fight each other. 480,000 Americans and 26,000 Soviet soldiers involved.\n\nEfforts to unify Korea resulted in more than 100,000 deaths due to guerilla warfare. In April 1950, North Korean leader Kim II Sung persuaded Joseph Stalin to back an invasion of South Korea, convincing Stalin that the United States would not intervene. Stalin agreed to provide arms, equipment, and advisors to the North Koreans (“Korean War”). Kim II Sung did not stop there as he also persuaded the newly communist Chinese to aid the North Koreans. The Korean War, (June 25,1950 – July 27, 1953), occurred when over 75,000 North Korean Army invaded the land across of the 38th parallel. American president Harry Truman was feeling heat after “letting China fall”, so Truman ordered American troops into action on South July, the United Sates entered the conflict on South Korea’s behalf. The next three years would be the darkest and most horrific in Korean history. As seen in American reporter Bill Shinn’s account, “the North Koreans were gruesome…during the occupation of South Korea, they killed over 165,000 civilians. Also, I witnessed a South Korean mass execution of civilians suspected of having helped the communists. Korea was a mess” (“The Forgotten War Remembered: Korea, 1950-1953). This shows the depths of the horror that was perpetrated in Korea for three years.\n\nThe Korean War was initiated when Kim Il-sung commenced a surprise attack on South Korea after wrongly assuming the South would willingly undergo Kim Il-sung’s dictatorship. The attack took place at dawn on June 25, 1950. In as little as three days, the communist forces captured the South Korean capital and occupied most of the country. This invasion may have been a shocker to the South, but the North was preparing years in advance for it. The North received training from the Soviet Union (USSR) alongside the with Chinese and were supplied weaponry. The USSR’s involvement with the attack was imperative to their success. Joseph Stalin-- leader of the USSR at the time-- was initially against the infiltration of the South due to his fear of The United States getting involved and declaring a paramount war on the South 's behalf. Stalin ended up changing his mind because he"
