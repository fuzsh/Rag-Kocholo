        "text": "Recruiting poster \"Captain Audie L. Murphy of the Texas National Guard\" used between 1950-1954.\n\nTexas Armed Forces Museum\n\n1950Camp Mabry, Texas - Hollywood actor Audie Murphy joins the Texas Army National Guard to show his support of the war effort in Korea. Nearly every schoolboy knows Lieutenant Murphy is America's most highly decorated soldier in World War II. Aside from receiving the Medal of Honor, he was awarded two Distinguished Service Crosses and four Silver Stars for valor in combat. At the end of the war his picture was everywhere, from movie newsreels to the cover of Life. He left the Army in 1946 to seek an acting career, which literally kept his name in lights and public awareness during the late 1940s. Newly promoted Captain Murphy was assigned to the 141st Infantry, 36th Infantry Division. But he will have little time to train with the troops. The National Guard Bureau decided to use his fame as a recruiting tool to help keep enlistments up despite the war in Korea. Soon his image was on Guard recruiting posters and in magazine ads placed in national publications popular with young male readers. Drawing on his Hollywood background he was featured in the first television (then still a novel invention) commercials ever run by the Guard Bureau. He did recruiting tours speaking to young audiences from coast to coast. While all of this was going on, he continued his movie career, staring in 1951 in one of his best acclaimed film roles, as the young soldier in The Red Badge of Courage, a story set in the Civil War but really dealing with the meanings of courage and duty pertaining to all wars. After two years of working on recruiting and public affairs projects for the Guard Bureau he returned to his unit and actually served as a line officer, being promoted to major before he resigned and left the Guard in 1955. He died in an airplane crash in 1971, having been a strong supporter once again of American involvement in a foreign war, this time in Vietnam.\n\nA bulldozer and 5-ton dump truck of the 116th Engineer Battalion surfacing a section of QL-20 between Bao Loc and Camp B'Sar, Vietnam. This was one of the major supply routes used to maintain Allied forces in region northwest of Saigon. Note the security team in the jeep on right. Often the engineers themselves had to furnish their own personnel for security duty as other forces were unavailable.\n\nU.S. Army Center of Military History-Oral Histories Branch\n\n1969Boise, Idaho - The Guardsmen of the 116th Engineer Battalion (Combat) are released from active duty having just returned from their eleven-month tour of service in Vietnam. This marked the sixth time in 70 years that the battalion served on active duty. In fact, the 116th was the only Guard unit, Army or Air, to serve in theater during both the Korean and Vietnam wars. When the battalion was mobilized on May 13, 1968 it numbered 804 officers and men, almost all of whom deployed to Vietnam with the unit, making it the largest group of Guardsmen serving together in-country. While the unit was stationed at several bases northwest of Saigon, it built or upgraded nearly 600 miles of road, along with constructing barracks and other buildings on American bases. Company B was assigned to Phan Thiet on the coast and while there it constructed a heavy-beam wooden bridge strong enough to hold the weight of an M-48 American tank to replace a steel structure installed by the French but destroyed by the Viet Cong during the 1968 Tet Offensive. As of 1975 when the last Americans left Vietnam the span was still standing and being used by the local populace. The tour cost the battalion six of its men killed in action. Causes of death ranged from running vehicles over landmines to being shot by snipers. Two men were awarded the Silver Star for valor in combat and at least 100 received the Purple Heart for wounds suffered from enemy actions. The 116th Engineer Battalion remains an important part of the Army National Guard today.\n\nAn F-106 of the 125th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron 'escorts' a Soviet bomber near Florida airspace during one of these routine intercepts.\n\nHeritage Series\n\n1986Off the Coast of Florida - An F-106 \"Delta Dart\" of the 125th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron encounters a Soviet Air Force Tu-95 \"Bear\" bomber flying parallel to the twelve-mile limit of U.S. airspace as it makes its way from Russia to Cuba. These are routine flights which are just as routinely met by Air Guard fighters who act as ‘escorts' to be sure the bombers pose no threat to the U.S. homeland. Since 1953 Air Guard fighter-interceptor units took on an air defense mission, challenging unidentified aircraft flying into American airspace. Air Guard pilots and aircraft stood alert 24 hours a day, every day. This mission grew each year and by 1965 the 22 interceptor squadrons flew 30,000 hours and completed 38,000 alert sorties. By 1988 the Air Guard provided 86% of the Air Force units assigned to national airspace security. In the post 9/11 environment the Air Guard has continued and expanded its role in homeland defense by flying overhead cover for major cities in times of heightened alert as well as investigating all suspicious air traffic heading toward or across the country.\n\nAn officer (2nd from right) and men of the American Regiment organized to capture the Spanish colony of Cartagena. Except for the more practical light weight linen of the campaign dress shown on the right, the issued uniform was based upon the pattern worn by the British Army of the period. Company of Military Historians\n\n1740Philadephia, Pennsylvania - Eight hundred volunteers drawn from the militia of several colonies board transports to sail as part of the joint British/American colonial expedition to capture the Spanish colony of Cartagena (today the nation of Colombia). In all, troops from eleven colonies take part in this endeavor, which ends in failure, due more to disease than enemy actions. Perhaps the most memorable aspect was Captain Lawrence Washington's service with the expedition's commander, Admiral Edward Vernon. When Washington returned home he renamed his house overlooking the Potomac River in northern Virginia as \"Mount Vernon\" in honor of his former commander. Lawrence died in 1752 and his younger brother, George, inherited the home which retains its name to this day. George also replaced him as one of four ‘adjutants' of the Virginia militia, responsible to the governor to report on the status of militia preparedness in his district. George so impressed the governor with his devotion to duty that he was selected in 1754 to tell the French to leave the area of what today is Pittsburgh, PA. He started a war, lost a battle, and gained national recognition. The rest is history.\n\nA Douglas O-2H of the 119th Observation Squadron, 1930. The unit was still flying these aircraft when it assisted in the search for survivors of the Morro Castle. Note the 44th Division emblem, the back to back \"4's\" painted on the fuselage.\n\nNational Guard Education Foundation\n\n1935Off the coast near Atlantic City, New Jersey - The cruise liner Morro Castle, which sailed a passenger route between New York City and Havana, Cuba, was nearing New York on this evening when suddenly a fire broke out aboard. Fed by the wind, it soon spread across the ship, causing it to sink. The captain, new to command, refused at first to send an SOS but his radio operator finally did at 3:24 A.M. Despite some efforts to extinguish the fire by the crew, all attempts failed and the ship lost power. The crew lowered the life boats for themselves and many took off without waiting for passengers to board. Many passengers, left with no alternative, jumped into the ocean trying to save their lives. Of the first 98 people to reach shore only six were passengers. At dawn, aircraft from the New Jersey National Guard's 119th Observation Squadron, 44th Division, took off to help search for survivors. In a number of instances they guided rescue ships to people struggling in the water. In all, 264 passengers and crew survived but another 137 died, almost all by drowning. Doubtless more would have died had not the pilots of the 119th aided in their rescue.\n\n1777Brandywine River, Pennsylvania - The small Quaker town of Chadds Ford becomes the scene of one of the largest engagements of the American Revolution. British commander General Sir William Howe was intent of capturing Philadelphia, the American capital. When he found his fleet's assent up the Delaware River blocked by strong American fortifications, he sailed his army of some 18,000 troops up to the headwaters of the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. Once landed and reorganized, he began marching his force 30-miles to Philadelphia. To try to block the British advance General George Washington positioned most of his 11,000 soldiers on high ground overlooking the Brandywine River at Chadds Ford. He placed strong outpost at several other possible crossing points but left one, Jefferis' Ford, unprotected because the local people said the river was too high to cross. But a reconnaissance by the British engineers discovered they could wade across if careful. Howe decided to split his force, moving about half toward Washington's army as a feint while the balance crossed over and outflanked the American army. As the enemy force to his front fired heavy artillery concentrations against the American positions and acted as though it would make a general attack (which it never did), Washington was receiving conflicting information about the British having crossed to his side of the river and approaching his right flank. By late afternoon, with solid intelligence the British were approaching, it was too late for Washington to effectively reposition his regiments, so he ordered a withdraw toward Philadelphia. Though turned out of their positions, his men marched away in good order, not routed as they had been the year before in New York. They were starting to become a professional army. Among the incidents recorded in this battle, which cost the Americans about 1,600 to 1,800 casualties, was the story of Private Edward Hector, a member of Proctor's Artillery of Philadelphia. He received a personal \"thank you\" from Congress for his bravery in rescuing his unit's artillery equipment in the face of an enemy attack. While it was unusual for any enlisted man to receive the thanks of Congress, it was even more so in this case because Hector was an African American. He was one of an estimated 5,000 black soldiers who fought as part of the American army in the war.\n\nThe World Trade Center (left) and the Pentagon soon after the attacks.\n\nNational Guard Bureau Historical Files\n\n2001New York City, New York; Arlington, Virginia; and near Shanksville, Pennsylvania - Arab terrorists fly highjacked airliners into both towers of the World Trade Center in NYC and the Pentagon outside Washington, DC. Within minutes of the first report of a hijacking out of Boston, MA, just six minutes after the scramble order was issued, the first F-15's from the 102nd Fighter Wing, Massachusetts Air Guard, are airborne. Though in fast pursuit they arrived too late to intercept and prevent either of the planes from striking the Trade Center towers. In the meantime, another two planes are reported highjacked and on course to Washington, DC. F-16's of the 119th Fighter Wing, North Dakota Air Guard (which are permanently assigned to Langley Air Force Base, VA), are scrambled to try to intercept the planes headed for DC. Unfortunately, they too arrive too late to prevent the strike on the Pentagon. Among the 189 killed in the Pentagon and the airliner which struck it were two Active Guard/Reserve Army National Guard officers. In the fourth plane passengers fought the highjackers resulting in the aircraft crashing in western Pennsylvania. During the remainder of the day and for months to come, constant air patrols were flown over major American cities with shoot down orders to prevent further such attacks. In the wake of the strikes, Army Guard units responded in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Virginia, Maryland, Washington DC and other locations across the nation. Within days, Guardsmen in every state/territory were guarding airports, bridges, and seaports as well as patrolling America's northern and southern borders.\n\n\"The Storming of Chapultepe-Quitman's Attack\" depicting the assault of the Palmetto Regiment. Color engraving by Adolphe-Jean-Baptiste Bayot after the painting by Carl Nebel. Print published by Appleton and Company, New York, 1950\n\nAnne S. K. Brown Military Collection\n\n1847Chapultepec, Mexico - The United States and Mexico had gone to war in 1846 over a boundary dispute concerning Texas. Early operations saw several important battles (all American victories) fought in northern Mexico. Then in March 1847 General Winfield Scott landed an American Army at Vera Cruz on the Mexican Gulf coast. Marching inland, winning several battles in the process, the last remaining outpost to block the American advance into the capital of Mexico City was (and still is) the Mexican Military Academy (akin to West Point) housed in Chapultepec Castle. Situated on a high bluff, it was defended by a combination of Mexican Army soldiers and cadets from the Academy. The main American assault consisted of two prongs. Attacking from the west, the first prong was composed mostly of Regular Army units. The second prong, hitting the castle from the south, was led by former militia Major General John A. Quitman from Mississippi. He commanded a brigade of regiments from Pennsylvania, New York and South Carolina. This latter unit, known as the \"Palmetto Regiment\" was selected to spearhead this attack. Moving across a meadow and several ditches of water, they reached a breach in the wall caused by American artillery fire. Once through the breech, they came under heavy enemy fire, forcing them to fight house-to-house as they approached a key position called the \"Belen Gate.\" They stormed the Gate and after some hand-to-hand fighting captured it, forcing the enemy to pull back. To better rally the troops Lieutenant Frederick Selleck placed the regimental flag on top of the ruins of the Gate only to be immediately shot and killed. Other American units passed through the remnants of the South Carolinians, continuing to push the Mexican defenders from their positions. The city surrendered the next day and the American Army soon peacefully entered Mexico City, effectively ending the war. Of historical note is the Palmetto flag carried during this campaign. The flag presented to the regiment when it left Charleston, having been exposed to the elements and battle damage since landing at Vera Cruz and nearly destroyed by the close of fighting for the Castle, was torn to shreds. After the regiment assumed garrison duties in Mexico City it acquired a new flag, which it carried home with pride. Apparently only briefly used in the Civil War, it survived that conflict with little wear. When the 2nd South Carolina Volunteer Infantry deployed to Cuba in 1898 during the Spanish-American War, it carried this aged Mexican War color, making it the first time an American regimental color ever flew victorious over two different foreign lands. Today it is framed and displayed in the South Carolina Confederate Relic Room and Museum Collection in Columbia.\n\nTwenty-fifth President of the United States William McKinley, Jr.\n\nPainting by Chet Jezierski for the National Guard Bureau Presidential Series\n\n1901Buffalo, New York - Twenty-fifth President of the United States William McKinley, Jr., dies today of an assassin's bullet shot into him on September 6th. Born in Ohio, he enlisted as a private at the age of 18 in the 23rd Ohio Volunteer Infantry at the outbreak of the Civil War (also serving as a major in this same regiment was future 19th President Rutherford B. Hayes). McKinley proved an able leader and quickly moved up through the ranks so that by war's end he was a major. After leaving the Army he entered politics, being repeatedly elected to the House of Representatives until elected President in 1897. The most important aspect of his time as president was taking the United States to war against Spain over the issue of Cuban independence. The outcome of that war made America a world power with colonies in Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Guam and the Philippines. During this period nearly 200,000 Guardsmen served in the American Army seeing combat in all theaters of the war. McKinley's Vice President, who is sworn in as the 26th President on this date, is former New York Guard Captain and Colonel of the 1st Volunteer Cavalry, \"the Rough Riders\", Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nSoldiers of the 372nd Infantry preparing to board ship in France for their return home and discharge in March 1919. Note they are wearing their 93rd Division \"Blue Helmet\" shoulder patches. One man has a souvenir German helmet hanging from his belt.It may be some of these very men may have marched in the Victory Parade on this date.\n\nNational Archives and Records Administration\n\n1919Washington, DC - General John J. Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Force in Europe during World War I, leads the National Victory Day Parade down Pennsylvania Avenue and past the White House. As Guard units are inactivated at their point of return to the United States, no Guard commands exist to take part in this parade. While not officially represented the Guard does have at least one \"unofficial\" contingent fall in at the back of he parade. They are African American veterans from the former 1st Battalion, 372nd Infantry, part of the Guard's all-black 93rd Division during the war. The 1st Battalion was organized from the District of Columbia's three black Guard companies that existed during the 1917 mobilization. The men, many wearing their uniforms, received both applause and jeers as they marched along behind the ‘official' parade. No official Victory Parade was held again in the nation's capital until the end of Desert Storm in 1991.\n\n\"Storming of Monterey-Attack on the Bishop's Palace.\" Color engraving by Kellogg & Thayer, NYC, 1847. While the American troops represented in blue-gray in this plate are fairly accurate in their depiction, the Mississippi Rifles, who were wearing red ‘hunting' shirts and straw hats are not shown. In the age before photographs could be mass produced and published in newspapers, engraved (and later lithographic) plates like this was the only way most Americans could see battles, generals and foreign lands.\n\nAnne S. K. Brown Military Collection\n\n1846Monterrey, Mexico - America declared war against Mexico in April 1846. By mid-summer General Zackary Taylor had marched his army of nearly 20,000 men, more than half of whom were in volunteer (today Guard) units, across the border and deep into northern Mexico. He attacked the city meeting stiff resistance. But it was the assault and capture of the citadel, often referred to as the \"Bishop's Palace\", that saw the hardest combat. One of the units involved in this attack was the 1st Mississippi Volunteers, also known as the \"Mississippi Rifles\" commanded by Colonel Jefferson Davis. A West Point graduate and former Regular Army officer before the war, he made sure his men were well-trained and armed with the best shoulder arm then available, better than the muskets carried by the Army. The Rifles stormed the Palace and secured it after hand-to-hand fighting. The Mexicans were allowed to surrender with the ‘honors of war' (marching out under arms and carrying their colors). At the Battle of Buena Vista on February 23, 1847 the Rifles helped stem the main Mexican assault and threw the enemy back in confusion, causing them to retreat. Davis served at various times as a senator from Mississippi and he served as Secretary of War under President Franklin Pierce from 1853-1857 before returning to the Senate. In 1861 was elected as the President of the Confederate States of America.\n\nTroopers of the 1st Rhode Island Cavalry load their horses on railcars for the long trip home.\n\nNational Guard Education Foundation\n\n1916Along the Mexican Border - The War Department issues orders for some National Guard units to begin preparations to return home safely. In May President Woodrow Wilson had mobilized most of the Guard; having it deploy along the border areas of CA, AZ, NM and TX to prevent Mexican bandits led by Pancho Villa from raiding U.S. territory (as they had in March when they stormed into Columbus, NM, killing several civilians and soldiers.) World War I had started in Europe in the summer of 1914, so by the time of the Mexican Border call up, it had been raging for two years. America had thus far remained neutral but many people, especially in the Army, felt our involvement was inevitable. So while guarding the border the Army used the time to conduct large-scale, multi-division sized field exercises not usually available to Regular Army or Guard units. Guardsmen found themselves training in trenches like those they saw in newsreels from the Western Front in France. As autumn moved toward winter, more and more Guard units were returning home and being released from active duty. By April 1917 however, America would indeed be involved in the war and all would once again find themselves preparing, this time in earnest, for combat.\n\nTwo F-100C \"Super Sabre's\" of Iowa's 174th Tactical Fighter Squadron taxi to their revetments for refueling and rearming after completing a mission, Phu Cat Air Base, Vietnam. The 355th , also stationed at Phu Cat, flew F-100's too.\n\nNational Guard Education Foundation\n\n1968Phu Cat Air Base, Vietnam - The pilots of the 355th Tactical Fighter Squadron(TFS) continue flying their ground support missions for Allied forces across South Vietnam. Sometimes referred to as the \"fifth Air Guard squadron\" the 355th, a newly organized Regular Air Force squadron created at Myrtle Beach, SC, had about 80% of its personnel drawn from the Air Guard's 119th (NJ) and 121st (DC) tactical fighter squadrons. The Guard members of the 355th included pilots and ground support personnel. Both squadrons were mobilized in January 1968 but not deployed to Vietnam (unlike four other Air Guard squadrons sent as complete formations). Instead they were assigned to teach F-100 \"Super Sabre\" fighter-bomber operations to new pilots. Once in South Carolina the Air Force asked for Guard volunteers to staff the new 355th and the response was overwhelming (so many pilots wanted to go that about one third had to remain behind). When the squadron finished its training in June 1968 it was deployed to Phu Cat. There it was assigned to the 37th Tactical Fighter Wing, which included 174th TFS, an Air Guard unit from Iowa. The 355th spent about ten months in-country, flying their F-100's primarily on missions that consisted of bombing suspected enemy concentrations and supply locations. Just a month after the unit arrived, on July 20, while conducting one of these missions, a former 121st pilot from the District of Columbia, Lieutenant Colonel S.E. Flanagan, Jr., was shot down and killed. He was the highest-ranking Guardsman, Army or Air, to die in Vietnam. In April 1969 the 355th was transferred to Korea as part of the American withdrawal from Vietnam. At this point all those Guardsmen who did not volunteer to stay on active duty were returned to the United States and released from active duty in June.\n\n\"Major General Benedict Arnold, wounded December 31, 1775 at the attack on Quebec.\" An engraving, probably done in France in 1776 or early 1777 since it does not mention his second wound (in the same leg) at the Battle of Saratoga in October 1777. He did not betray the American cause until 1780.\n\nAnne S. K. Brown Military Collection\n\n1775Kennebec County, Massachusetts (today Maine) - A small American army numbering just over 1,000 men under the command of Colonel Benedict Arnold sets out to march north along the Kennebec River to link up with another American force to seize the British-held city of Quebec on the St. Lawrence River. If successful, this would capture all of Canada, bringing it into the American confederation against Britain. Arnold, himself a volunteer officer who served in the Connecticut militia before the war, has among his hand-picked men Colonel Daniel Morgan's 300 elite rifleman draw from Pennsylvania and Virginia frontier militia units. This expedition, which got a late start with winter fast approaching, wrongly believes it needs to cross about 200 miles of wilderness to reach their goal when in fact their trek will take twice the distance due to faulty maps and intelligence. His men run out of supplies and are down to eating their shoes, cartridge boxes and other leather goods. By the time they finally link up with the other American contingent in December heavy snows have already fallen. The British are expecting their attack, which is made on New Year's Eve in a blinding snowstorm and fails with heavy losses. Canada remains British. The Americans withdraw but both Arnold and Morgan will go on to play important roles in the war, first as fellow officers and then as enemies.\n\n\"Truman's Battery\" depicts the action of Battery D, 129th Field Artillery on the opening day of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. Truman, wearing his trademark round glasses, is directing his men as they fire their 75mm field guns in support of the Allied attack.\n\nPainting by Domineck D'Andrea for the National Guard Bureau, Heritage Series\n\n1918Meuse-Argonne, France - The American Army launches its final and largest offensive of World War I against the German \"Hindenburg Line.\" Among the units involved are eight Guard divisions plus numerous non-divisional units, including a number of former Guardsmen serving in aerial squadrons flying over the front. By early November so much territory will be taken and so many enemy soldiers killed or captured that Germany will seek peace. Among the tens of thousands of American soldiers taking part in this offensive was a future president of the United States. Captain Harry S. Truman first enlisted in the 1st Missouri Field Artillery in 1905 but left due to job requirements in 1908. In 1917, soon after America declared war against Germany, he was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in Missouri's 129th Field Artillery, an element of the newly organized 35th Division. During the 129th's training Truman's able leadership and excellent organizational skills proved so effective he was promoted to First Lieutenant and assigned to Battery D, commonly known by the rest of the regiment for having a lack of discipline and lackluster expertise in handling of their guns. Truman was given the task of getting the battery into shape, which he did with a combination of tough discipline and fair guidance. By the time the 129th entered combat as part of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, Truman had become Battery D's commander with the rank of captain. In fact, men within the regiment started referring to his unit as \"Captain Harry's Battery\", as a sign of respect. After the war Truman stayed in the Guard into the early 1930's, rising to lieutenant colonel before transferring to the Organized Reserves, where he finished his military career as a colonel. During this time he had became involved in politics, being elected first to the House of Representatives and, by the eve of World War II, the Senate. In fact, after the attack on Pearl Harbor he volunteered for active duty but was refused by Army Chief of Staff, General George C. Marshall, who told him he could provide a more valuable service by staying in Congress (where he was on several important defense-related committees) then just being \"another colonel looking for a job.\" Truman stayed in the Senate, was selected as President Franklin Roosevelt's running mate in the 1944 election, becoming Vice President just a month before Roosevelt's death in April 1945.\n\nAfrican American soldiers (and one of their white officers) of the 369th Infantry practice what they will soon experience, fighting in the trenches of the Western Front. They are wearing French helmets and using French issued rifles and equipment, the logic being that since they were fighting under French command, it was easier to resupply them from the French system than trying to get American-issued items.\n\nNational Archives and Records Administration\n\n1918Sechault, France - As one of the diversionary attacks made during the opening stages of the great Meuse Argonne offensive the French 161st Division was selected to capture the vital village of Sechault which overlooked a German supply road. The French command assigned the task of taking and holding this town to the 1st Battalion, 369th Infantry, 93rd Division. Why would an American unit be fighting in a French division? Because this unit was one of three African American Guard regiments the American commanders did not want intermixed with American white commands. Though all of the enlisted personnel were black almost all of their officers were white. The French were more than happy to have the black soldiers, who proved time and again that they were the equal of the best white troops. This particular unit, formerly the 15th New York Infantry, was better known by its nickname, the \"Hell Fighters from Harlem\". It once again proved its worth in this engagement. Though the battalion quickly secured the town, the Germans soon forced back the French units on either flank, leaving the 1st Battalion effectively surrounded. Then the Germans reduced the town to rubble with heavy artillery fire through most of the night but still the black troops held their ground. Ammunition, medical supplies and especially water in some locations was running out but the men continued to hold out against several enemy attacks during the night. When finally relieved mid-day on the 30th a total of 172 members of the battalion were dead and 679 more wounded. In addition, about 80 men were missing (at least ten of whom were known to be captured but others were never accounted for, probably blown to pieces by artillery). One white officer, First Lieutenant George Robb (a non-Guardsman from Kansas) received the Medal of Honor and more than 100 of the black soldiers were awarded French decorations for valor including two Legion's of Honor (France's highest award for valor)."
