        "text": "The Far East Air Forces(FEAF) was the U.S. Air Force organization in charge of the air forces in the Pacific when the Korean War broke out on June 25, 1950. The Fifth Air Force in Japan, the Twentieth Air Force in Okinawa, and the Thirteenth Air Force in the Philippines were the main FEAF subordinate forces.\n\nHowever, the FEAF only had one B-29 bomber unit at its disposal: the 19th Bombardment Group in Guam. This unit was the only b-29 unit not under the control of the Strategic Air Command(SAC). The 92nd and 22nd Bomb Wings of Strategic Air Command were independently sent to Korea by General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, the commander of the US Air Force, on July 3.\n\nTo coordinate the Bombardment Groups of FEAF and SAC, a provisional Far East Bomber Command was established on 8 July 1950. In addition, the 31st Strategic Squadron operating the RB-29 was also added. In the end, Bomber Command was mainly manned by SAC personnel.\n\nBecause B-29s required large and well-equipped bases safe from enemy air and ground attack they were not based in Korea. As a result, the main base for B-29 operations was Kadena Air Force Base on the island of Okinawa.\n\nThe order of battle for the FEAF Bomber Command Bombardment Groups was the following:\n\nBombardment Groups\n\nFar East Air Forces (FEAF)\n\nFEAF Bomber Command\n\nTwentieth Air Force, Kadena Air Base, Okinawa:\n\n19th Bombardment Group (Medium) June 27, 1950– May 18, 1954\n\n28th Bombardment Squadron (Medium)\n\n30th Bombardment Squadron (Medium)\n\n93rd Bombardment Squadron (Medium)\n\nStrategic Air Command\n\nFEAF Bomber Command\n\nKadena Air Force Base, on the island of Okinawa:\n\n22nd Bombardment Group (Medium) “Red Raiders’ (Circle E) July 9, 1950–October 28, 1950\n\n2nd Bombardment Squadron (Medium) (red)\n\n19th Bombardment Squadron (Medium) (blue)\n\n33rd Bombardment Squadron (Medium) (yellow)\n\n307th Bombardment Group (Square Y) August 1, 1950— August 15, 1954\n\n370th Bombardment Squadron (Medium) (red)\n\n371st Bombardment Squadron (Medium) (yellow)\n\n372nd Bombardment Squadron (Medium) (blue)\n\nYokota Air force Base, on the island of Honshu:\n\n92nd Bombardment Group (Medium) ‘Alley Oop’ July 9, 1950- October 29, 1950\n\n325th Bombardment Squadron (Medium) (red)\n\n326th Bombardment Squadron (Medium) (blue and white)\n\n327th Bombardment Squadron (Medium) (yellow)\n\n98th Bombardment Group (Medium) (Square H) August 5, 1950— July 25, 1954\n\n342nd Bombardment Squadron (Medium)\n\n343rd Bombardment Squadron (Medium) (red)\n\n344th Bombardment Squadron (Medium) (green)\n\n345th Bombardment Squadron (Medium) (white and red)\n\nOther B-29 Groups/Squadrons in Korea\n\n3rd Radar Calibration Detachment\n\nKadena Air Base, Okinawa\n\nJanuary 1950 to June 1951\n\n10th Radar Calibration Detachment (later Squadron)\n\nKomaki and Yokota Air Bases, Japan\n\nJanuary 1950 to July 1953 (moved from Komaki to Yokota and merged with 3rd Radar Calibration Det in June 1961)\n\n512th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron (Very Long Range) (RB-29, WB-29)\n\nYokota and Misawa Air Bases, Japan\n\nJune 1950 to February 1951\n\n56th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron (Medium) (RB-29)\n\nMisawa Air Base, Japan\n\nFebruary 1951 to July 1953\n\n514th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron (Very Long Range) (RB-29, WB-29)\n\nAndersen Air Force Base, Guam\n\nJune 1950 to February 1951\n\n54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron (RB-29, WB-29, WB-50)\n\nAndersen Air Force Base, Guam\n\n1947 to 1974\n\n2nd Air Rescue Squadron (D flight equipped with SB-29)\n\nKadena Air Base, Okinawa\n\ncirca 1951 to 1953\n\n34th Air Rescue Squadron (SB-29)\n\n37th Air Rescue Squadron (SB-29)\n\n43rd Air Refueling Squadron (KB-29P/M)\n\n91st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron Circle X (RB-29, RB-50G)\n\nYokota and Johnson Air Bases, Japan\n\nJanuary 1950 to circa July 1963 (reinforced on 16 November 1950 when it absorbed the 31st SRS, and in August 1951 by Detachment 3 with RB-50Gs)\n\n581st Air Resupply and Communication Wing (B-29)\n\nClark Field, the Philippines\n\nJanuary 1953 to post-war\n\nBombardment Group’s average numerical strength\n\n1950 – 87 B-29s and 81 crews\n\n1951 – 104 B-29s and 86 crews\n\n1952 – 118 B-29s and 112 crews\n\n1953 – 117 B-29s and 109 crews\n\nBombardment Group Commanders and Plane Rosters\n\n19th Bombardment Group\n\nCommanders:\n\n19th Bombardment Group (Medium)\n\nCol.
