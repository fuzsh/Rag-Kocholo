        "text": "Key Takeaway: Railroads have been a vital partner in U.S. military operations for nearly 200 years. They have transported troops and supplies, hauled the raw materials for weapons and planes, and continue to actively hire veterans.\n\nAmerica’s freight railroads proudly hire the men and women who have bravely served our nation. From early West Point grads who helped lead the U.S. rail industry’s formation to Civil War veterans who worked on the nation’s transcontinental railroad, the success of America’s freight railroads is deeply rooted in a tradition of hiring veterans. The ESGR has recognized America’s Class I railroads for their long-standing commitment to supporting and hiring guardsmen/women and reservists.\n\nThe skills developed and valued in the military — a sense of dedication, discipline, teamwork and adherence to safety — are the same skills that keep the backbone of the nation’s economy efficiently running. Veterans are particularly well-suited for railroad careers, have diverse skills and can adapt to changing conditions. Unlike many other private industries, railroads understand the technical aspects and demands of an armed forces job. They work with the military to help talented servicemen and women transition from military service to private-sector railroad employment."
