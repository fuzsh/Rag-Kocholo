Canada contributed and helped quite a bit during this war. Things that Canada did to help were attacking certain important targets through ground troops, they also had a good navy, and air force, which was useful.

To endorse peace, the Canadian Peace Congress was created in 1949. It advocated for the ban of nuclear weapons and arms race particularly during 1970-1980s. Furthermore, Canada was involved in United Nations since 1945. An important figure in peacekeeping of Canada was Lester B. Pearson, a Canadian prime minister who reigned from 1963 to 1968.\n\nThe Pros And Cons Of Canadian Peacekeeping\n\n174 Words | 1 Pages\n\nI think that Canada should try to retain its peacekeeping role. In the past years, Canada has been putting a lot more money and resources into fighting the war in Afghanistan, while they could have been investing in peacekeeping missions (Shephard). Canada should decrease its involvement in violent missions and increase their involvement in peacekeeping missions. They have participated in both in the past (Dyck 207).

Another one of Canada’s strengths was how calmly autonomy was achieved after the war. Canada did not need to make a fuss about becoming their own country because it was obvious that they were already ready for that. Their proof was presented in how they planned and executed their battles, and fought alongside Britain to successfully defeat\n\nHow Did Ww2 Affect Canada\n\n547 Words | 3 Pages\n\nAs stated by Margaret Hoogeveen and Sarah Murdoch in the book Creating Canada “During WW2 Canadians experienced the worst violence that war can\n\nLester B. Pearson's Impact On Canada\n\n1259 Words | 6 Pages\n\nToday, Canada is seen as a multicultural and peaceful nation that has evolved over the course of history. This great nation would never have been possible without the impact that former Prime Minister, Lester B. Pearson left on this country. His achievements and insights profoundly affected and shaped Canada’s nation. First, peacekeeping is an important part of Canada’s heritage and a reflection of its fundamental beliefs that Pearson implemented after dealing with world changing situations and winning a Nobel Prize.

This battle is remembered because of the over 2.2 million soldiers killed, wounded, or missing over the full 2 battles (Christie, 1).

Canadians also played a big part in taking Ypres.\n\nCanada During The Cold War Essay\n\n459 Words | 2 Pages\n\nFrom 1945 to 1982, Canada looked to become not only trustworthy trading partners with the U.S, but trustworthy military collaborates with them. With the commencement of the Cold War, both Canada and the United States had to stop, control, and protect the North Atlantic Community from soviet attacks and the spread of communism. A way in which Canada and the United States strengthened their relations during the Cold War was through NATO. Since “The USSR pursued a policy of aggressive military expansion at home and subversion abroad,” the United States and Canada feared Soviets would impose communism on countries such as France, Italy, and Germany. As a result, a military alliance called NATO created between Canada, the United States, Britain,\n\nThe first reason Canadians should be proud is because of the country’s involvement in the wars. Canada has great success at Vimy Ridge. This gave the country more of a military identity and a feeling of national pride.

Later the Canada view of peacekeeping was most notably damaged by the Somalian scandal where, according to the Canadian Encyclopedia “two Canadian paratroopers serving in Somalia beat and tortured a local teenager to death. A dozen more Canadian soldiers had been aware of the beating but did nothing to intervene” This scandal embarrassed Canada and hurt its reputation for peacekeeping. Canada’s history of peacekeeping has shaped it by helping build its reputation as a strong middle power, a player in the UN. Along with that it helped bolster national pride World War One, Two and peace have been defining themes in Canada’s history.\n\nArgumentative Essay On The Korean War\n\n1796 Words | 8 Pages\n\nIn retrospect, however, the United States should not have entered the war. Not being a part of the war would have saved American lives and money, potentially eliminated PTSD in a generation on soldiers, and would have prevented the animosity that exist between the United States and North Korea that dominates the headlines today. The Korean War was fought between two major wars, Word War II and the Vietnam War. Due to being fought between these major wars, the Korean War is known as “The Forgotten War.” The Korean War started on June 25, 1950 and ended July 23, 1953.\n\nEssay On Canadian Identity\n\n1033 Words | 5 Pages\n\nThe events in American history have also affected Canada from a political perspective, which lead to the Democracy that is present today. Another way the U.S. has affected Canada is from a military perspective because Americans are quick to jump to war and Canada has had to help control them which lead to them being peacekeepers. The United States helped mold the Canadian identity by being both a threat and support to the nation; this will continue into the 21st century but Canada will keep it’s unique identity. A country 's culture can be seen as interchangeable with identity; in Canada there is evidence of American culture everywhere."
