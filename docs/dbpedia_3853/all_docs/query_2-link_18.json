        "text": "Was the Korean War worth the cost?\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the Korean Conflict being called America's \"Forgotten War.\" It never unified the country in its support the way World War II did. Americans were not asked to sacrifice through rationing and other programs. In World War II, defeat of Nazi Germany and Japan was the obvious goal. Korea was part of the Cold War global struggle against communism, but the United States was not directly fighting either the Soviet Union or China, its major proponents. American war aims in the Korean Conflict were not as clear. And the war never really ended. Neither side surrendered. A negotiated armistice established the 38th parallel as the dividing line between the two Koreas, just as it had been before the fighting commenced. The Korean peninsula was devastated. Was the cost of the war worth it?\n\nClash with Communists\n\nThe Korean peninsula off the east cost of Asia has had a long history of foreign invaders. In 1910, Japanese armies conquered Korea and occupied it until their defeat in 1945 at the end of World War II. During the war, several different nationalist factions fought against the Japanese for Korean independence. Some were supported by Communist China; others favored western democracy. In the last few months of World War II, the Soviet Union declared war against Japan and sent Russian soldiers into Korea. The U.S. made them stop their southern movement at the 38th parallel, and that line became the effective division between a communist North Korea and a western South Korea.\n\nIn 1950, after several border clashes near the dividing line, the North Korean army invaded the south and nearly occupied the entire peninsula. President Harry S. Truman and the West saw this act of aggression sponsored by the Soviet Union as part of a strategy for worldwide communist domination. Backed by a United Nations resolution condemning the invasion and building a military coalition led by the United States, Truman committed American forces to the defense of South Korea. The United Nations troops, under General Douglas MacArthur, began rolling back the North Korean forces. Fearing the advance, Communist China sent thousands of troops to support North Korea and American forces were driven back. Truman wanted to avoid an all-out war with China. MacArthur publicly disagreed and advocated bombing the Chinese. Truman fired the popular general who returned to the U.S and began a speaking tour attacking the president's policies as weak. In 1952, General Dwight Eisenhower was elected president, and he made a secret trip to Korea to help bring about an armistice in 1953 that ended the fighting. A strip of land at the 38th parallel was declared a \"demilitarized zone\" but both sides established heavy defenses along its border.\n\nCost of Korea\n\nCounting civilian casualties, an estimated 2,800,000 people lost their lives in the Korean Conflict. American losses totaled 33,741. Of those, approximately 580 were from Iowa. In 1995, the United States dedicated a memorial on the Capitol grounds to those who served in the Korean War. Iowa had dedicated its own Korean War memorial five years earlier. According to the Iowa government website:\n\n\"The drive for a Korean War monument began in November 1984, when students from a Harding Junior High School class in Des Moines wrote the governor, asking why Korean War veterans did not have a memorial. The Iowa monument, erected on a grassy area south of the Capitol, includes a 14-foot-tall central obelisk and eight 6-foot-tall tablets which tell the story of the Korean War utilizing words, pictures, and maps of Korea engraved in granite. The monument was dedicated by Governor Terry Branstad on May 28, 1989.\"\n\nSupporting Questions\n\nWhy was there a war and how was it fought?\n\nWorld Leaders Sign the United Nations Charter, June 25, 1945 (Image)\n\nExcerpts from the Geneva Convention: Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, August 12, 1949 (Document)\n\nSouth Korean Soldiers Prepare and Lay an Anti-Tank Mine, July 22, 1950 (Image)\n\nAmerican Soldier Prepares a Leaflet Bomb in Yokohama, Japan, November 1, 1950 (Image)\n\n\"Korean Pearl Harbor?
