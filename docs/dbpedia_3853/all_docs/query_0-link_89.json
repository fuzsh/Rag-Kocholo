        "text": "Approximately 5.7 million Veterans served in the Korean War. Korean War Veterans are more prone to suffer from disabilities related to cold injures as a result of exposure to severe cold climates. Cold weather accounted for 16% of Army non-battle injuries and over 5,000 U.S. casualties of cold injury required evacuation from Korea during the winter of 1950-1951. In many instances, Servicemembers could not seek or were unable to obtain medical care for cold injuries because of battlefield conditions.\n\nVA Benefits\n\nKorean War Veterans may be eligible for a wide-variety of benefits available to all U.S. military Veterans. VA benefits include disability compensation, pension, education and training, health care, home loans, insurance, vocational rehabilitation and employment, and burial. See our Veterans page for an overview of the benefits available to all Veterans.\n\nInformation for Korean War Veterans\n\nThe following sections provide information tailored to the experiences of Korean War Veterans to help you better understand specific VA benefits for which you may qualify.\n\nBenefits for Korean War Veterans Who Experience Cold Injuries\n\nVeterans who experienced cold injuries may have medical conditions resulting from a cold-related disease or injury. Examples of cold-related medical conditions include: skin cancer in frostbite scars, arthritis, fallen arches, stiff toes, and cold sensitization. These cold-related problems may worsen as Veterans grow older and develop complicating conditions such as diabetes and peripheral vascular disease, which place them at higher risk for late amputations.\n\nLearn more about cold injuries on the Veterans Health Administration's Cold Injuries page.\n\nLearn more about how service-connected cold injuries or diseases may qualify you for VA Disability Compensation benefits.\n\nBenefits for Korean War Veterans Exposed to Ionizing Radiation\n\nKorean War era Veterans may qualify for health care and compensation benefits if you were exposed to ionizing radiation during military service.

You may also be entitled to disability compensation benefits if you have certain cancers as a result of exposure to ionizing radiation during military service.\n\nLearn more about VA benefits for Veterans exposed to ionizing radiation:\n\nVeterans Health Administration's Radiation page\n\nDisability Compensation Ionizing Radiation Exposure page\n\nBenefits for Korean War Veterans Who Participated in Radiation-Risk Activities\n\nKorean War era Veterans may qualify for health care and compensation benefits if you participated in certain radiation-risk activities, such as nuclear weapons testing, during military service. These Veterans may be informally referred to as \"Atomic Veterans\". Health care services include an Ionizing Radiation Registry health exam and clinical treatment at VA's War Related Illness and Injury Study Centers. You may also be entitled to disability compensation benefits if you have certain cancers as a result of your participation in a radiation-risk activity during military service.\n\nLearn more about VA benefits for Veterans who participated in radiation-risk activities:\n\nVeterans Health Administration's Radiation Risk Activity page\n\nDisability Compensation Radiogenic Diseases Exposure page\n\nHow to Apply\n\nThe specific VA benefit or program web page will provide tailored information about how to apply for a particular benefit or program.
