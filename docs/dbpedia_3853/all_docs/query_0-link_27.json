        "text": "The Korean War was a defining part of the United States foreign policy in the Cold War Era and was a response to threats from the Soviet Union. The Korean War was a culmination of tensions between North and South Korea that had resulted from the influences the United States and the Soviet Union inculcated into the countries during their occupation. When the Korean War was initiated, by the invasion of South Korea by North Korea, the United States and their allies in the United Nations perceived the invasion as a bold communistic expansion effort that occurred without provocation. (Document A). Further validating this idea was the fact that the attack was endorsed by the USSR, and partially lead by Red China, both of which were communist countries\n\nThe Korean War was an influential event that started in 1950 and caused a lot of controversy among Americans and Koreans. The war was caused by the US trying to preserve the Democratic side of Korea, the south side. The Koreans were not happy, however, and the Viet Kong and North Korean soldiers fought tooth and nail to get the Americans out of the country. There was eventually an end to the war of course but not without lots of casualties on both sides and a hostile environment around the border of the two countries.\n\nThe Korean War occurred from 25 June 1950 to 27 July 1953 when armistice was signed. (Stokesbury) It was between Republic of Korea and Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. United Nations were on the South Korea side and China and Soviet Union were at North Korea side. North Korea invaded South Korea after United States’ military evacuation. North Korea occupied most of South Korea, but after Incheon Landing, it turned the tide of the war. Finally, the war ended by declaring ceasefire and made Military Demarcation Line. The war was significant because it was the war between democratic and communist countries. It was also the time of Cold War when Soviet Union and United States were having political and diplomatic conflicts\n\nIn the article, “Teens Who Fought Hitler” by Lauren Tarshis it shows the challenges and bravery shown when in the middle of a war. A kid named Ben lived in one of the world's harshest times in history. He and his family were forced into a concentration camp. They were not allowed out until the war was over. Ben had to survive in the harsh conditions. Eventually he left his family to join the “war” against Hitler. He would never see his family again. He managed to live through the war, but his family was never to be seen again. They tried their best to fight against Hitler.\n\nThe Korean War had a major impact on American society, military, economy, and culture. The War started in 1950 and it ended after a dreadful three years. It all began when soldiers from the North Korean People’s Army poured across the 38th parallel to invade South Korea. The United States is allied with South Korea, therefore it was affected greatly by the war. The U.S. had one hundred and forty-two thousand casualties from the war. United States defence spending went up from twelve to sixty billion dollars and failed to liberate North Korea. The war is often referred to as the forgotten war, because it was never really a war according to President Truman. Truman labeled the war as a police action. Furthermore, World War II is also a reason for the Korean War being called the forgotten war. The Korean War has affected multiples people’s lives in different ways.\n\nAmerica's Involvement in the Korean War The USA emerged from WWII as the dominant Western, democratic superpower. She quickly established for herself a role as world policeman, and defender of the \"free world\". When, on June 25th 1950, Communist North Korean forces invaded the South of the country, the USAwas quick to step in, and with UN support and approval, sent in military forces to restore the balance. However, it is questionable whether moral principles were the only reason for America's involvement in the Korean War, or whether perhaps the Truman administration had other validation for such a huge scale military campaign.\n\nWhile the occupant powers were struggling to set ground for securing their interests, the Korean nationalism was at the most heated phase. Suffered through the Japanese colonial rule since 1910, the leaders of the two governments were determined to reunify Korea under their political regimes, and from their point view the only way to reach their aims was war. However, the United States and the Soviet Union were cautious not to take a role in initiating the war since neither of them was eager to prompt another to intervene. Being aware of their dependence on the superpowers, both leaders first had to gain the support of these countries to reach their goals. Until the beginning of the war, Kim Il-Sung particularly struggled hard to convince his mentor Stalin to provide him support in the war against the south.\n\nThe Korean War was Kim’s idea of reunification through the use of military force. * Soviet Union did not even want to be involved in a war. It was Kim’s idea to get the go ahead with the war and launch the attack against the South. * Most of the soldiers involved were Korean and Chinese, and fought for their own cause of reunification or liberation. 260,000 North Korean, 926,000 Chinese and 590,911 South Korean soldiers involved. * Soviet and American soldiers were not as heavily involved in the fighting, and mostly did so for their political security rather as a desire to fight each other. 480,000 Americans and 26,000 Soviet soldiers involved.\n\nThe Korean War begun on the arrival of the North Korean Army troops consisted of 750.000 soldiers at the 38th parallel- the imaginary boundary between South Korea- on une 25, 1950 (History.com Staff,2009). According to (PBS, N.D.), Korean War was the first war to provide the confrontation of nuclear powers and the war also showed how hard was the difficulty of both sides to create the right decision on when to attack using the bomb at the right time. Although it might seemed to be difficult, the attacks from Soviet Union and China on behalf of North Korea was hard to repel so that United Nation was asked to help South Korea repelled those attacks (PBS, n.d.). By the end of the brutal war that lasted 60 years there were two millions victim\n\nWhile most history books portray some soldiers as willing to fight for their rights, for whatever reason such as slavery, or unfair tariffs, what many fail to portray is the harsh reality of what soldiers felt. Soldiers wanted to go home after realizing just what the war cost them. Also, many soldiers were married as well, they and their wives could only wait for either the return of their husbands or the news that their life had been taken. What also didn’t help was the thought that they could be fighting their own relatives. Plenty of people at the time had differing views on the issues at the time, while some went for the sheer credibility of fighting for their thoughts and ideas, some went simply because they disagreed with their relatives. A manifold didn’t understand the reality that they may not die from disease or a gunshot, but they could be destroyed by the emotional weight of war. The person they could be fighting with could be struck by a bullet and they couldn’t stop to help them, they had to keep fighting. Some even had to watch their fallen brother die right in front of them, whether it was from disease or a gunshot, it tested soldier’s capability to cope with war. It took a toll on civilians as well. It was draining working for a cause that\n\nAlthough the conflict is under a ceasefire as of 1953 there is yet to be a peace treaty, not stopped just paused. There is no denying the actions of Stalin were a reason why the Korean War broke out, but it is my opinion that the actions of the USA and South Korea created a hostile environment in which a war could take place. Furthermore, the United States did fight in the war, the Soviet Union didn’t. It is also important to note that history is written by the victors and though there has been no winner as the war isn’t over its clear to see that South Korean and United States have done best from the conflict. It is next to impossible to form a rounded opinion as we are able to obtain information supporting the United Nations as we live in a country that is a prominent member of it and ally of the USA.\n\nThe third source that I decided to use was an English newspaper. The headline from the article was the first thing that stood out, suggesting that Trump might bomb North Korea next. The article barely covers the event, instead, it covers Eric Trump's comments and the possibility that North Korea can be next. The newspapers instigates that the United States might use military action against North Korea though including Eric Trump's statement hinting that his father is not afraid to make \"North Korea...next on the hit list if Kim Jong-Un carries on developing atomic weapons\" (Daily Mirror, April 14, 2017). The newspaper just adds more fuel to the existing tension between the United States and North Korea with such a provocative statement.\n\nThe Korean War was a trying time for America. The nation was getting involved in a war that had little or no possibility of a fortunate outcome. The Korean people were divided among how the country should be run. A uniform system of government looked like it may never come to be. In order to protect one of its vital interests as well as to prove to the rest of the world that America didn’t stand for communism, the United States began taking up arms. The war would prove a most difficult task to achieve successfully. In fact, it was almost impossible to continue fighting what seemed to be far from a worthy sacrifice of American lives."
