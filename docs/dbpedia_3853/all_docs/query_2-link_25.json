        "text": "The Korean War broke out on the 25th June 1950 when communist North Korea invaded South Korea. HMS Belfast was soon in action. In her two years of service in Korea, she saw more action than at any point during the Second World War. The Korean War was primarily fought on land, so why did HMS Belfast see such intense action during this period?\n\nThe Korean War lasted from 1950 - 1953. Korea was split into two zones after the end of the Second World War. The country had been occupied by Japan since 1910, and the victorious Allied powers agreed at The Potsdam Conference that Korea should be divided along a circle of latitude - the 38th Parallel.\n\nIWM holds a collection of oral history recordings of those who fought – hear veterans of the Korean War tell their stories of the conflict.\n\nAt the end of the Second World War, Korea – which had formerly been occupied by the Japanese – was divided along the 38th Parallel. This was an internal border between North and South Korea based on a circle of latitude.\n\nThe Second World War saw significant medical developments and refinements. These ranged from the use of penicillin to the widespread availability of blood transfusions and the first use of aircraft for evacuation. The last 70 years have seen further developments that have improved casualty survival rates in times of conflict."
