        "text": "In order to understand the way in which Draymond Green was raised as he started his NBA journey, first we need to understand the culture of a city like Detroit. For generations, the Pistons have had some of the most confrontational basketball teams in the league's history. Back in the '1980s, they were famous for playing rough basketball and even found some wild success with those methods. In fact, the 2003-04 team that won the championhip was exactly that type of team and a young Draymond Green was always around them during that time. As it turns out, he was friends with the Detroit Pistons GM Joe Dumars. His name is Jordan Dumars and he met Dramond Green when they both were at the Michigan Basketball program in Michigan State University.\n\nThe reason Draymond Green is a bully\n\nAt the time, Joe Dumars brought his son along with him to games and Draymond Green tagged along quite often. This gave him access to the Detroit Pistons' championship winning team and picked up a thing or two from them. Rasheed Wallace was one of those players from whom Green learned to be a bully. In fact, Wallace showed how excited he was for Draymond's ejection after chocking Rudy Gobert. Currently, Wallace holds the record with the most ejections in NBA history with 29. After Green's most recent ejection, he is only 10 away from Wallace's record. Many will tell you that's not something to be proud of but Rasheed Wallace would beg to differ."
