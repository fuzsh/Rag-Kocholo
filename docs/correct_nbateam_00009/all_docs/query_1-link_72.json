        "text": "GREG_MONROE_CELTICS.JPG\n\nGreg Monroe (above) and the Detroit Pistons big men have benefited from having Rasheed Wallace as an assistant coach.\n\n(AP Photo/Michael Dwyer)\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- If you spend too much of your time procrastinating on the internet, looking for NBA hilarity, you’ve probably seen clips of Rasheed Wallace dunking after Detroit Pistons practice.\n\nEarlier this season, Coach Sheed participated in a dunk contest – I use that term loosely – against Tony Mitchell. After Mitchell delivered a dunk that might have won the actual dunk contest (which reached embarrassing levels of non-importance this year, and actually no longer has an official individual winner), Coach Sheed waddled up to the rim and barely managed to coax a reverse slam over the rim.\n\nJust one year removed from his final season in the NBA, Sheed occasionally tries to reenact his youthful athleticism. Of course, he no longer owns the explosiveness that once made him one of the NBA’s most complete players. Brandon Jennings jokes about the comical attempts.\n\n“At least, he’s trying to dunk,” Jennings said Sunday in Boston before falling to the Celtics. The comment drew laughter from nearby Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. Added Greg Monroe, “Father time’s undefeated.\"\n\nWhether Wallace can still rise well above the rim or not (definitely not), I’ve always been mesmerized by him, like I imagine many others have. He’s one of the most talented players I’ve ever seen, arguably the best player on the 2004 championship Pistons, which took down the stacked Lakers, but he has six fewer All-Star game appearances than Joe Johnson. No matter what Wallace did during his NBA career – he earned many damaging technical fouls at the wrong times; once drew a seven-game suspension for threatening a referee at a loading dock (in retrospect, that offense seems more understandable; the official was Tim Donaghy); gained too much weight late in his career; and started spending far too much time at the 3-point arc – he always maintained a reputation as a great teammate.\n\n“He was just for his team, all about his team and winning,” Jennings said. “That’s the one thing I did notice about him before I met him.”\n\nThe guard offered that opinion four years after Wallace failed to keep himself in any type of shape during his one season with the Celtics. Still, he’s the type of guy who teammates and coaches have always sworn by. He’s a fallible character who screwed up and did so colorfully, but owns redeeming powers that kept plenty of folks supporting him regardless of his errors. He was beloved by coaches who sometimes must have wanted to strangle him. He squandered some of his potential, but has long seemed like the type of guy who would one day encourage young players to reach theirs.\n\nWallace is one of the all-time great characters in the NBA. He practiced in sweatpants with the pockets turned inside out. He guaranteed victories. He barked “ball don’t lie” after he believed a referee screwed up a call. He once called Arron Afflalo “Aflac” after a free throw, presumably because his name sounds like the title of the insurance company. He spent an entire press conference answering every question with four words: \"Both teams played hard.\" He did so many other ridiculous(-ly awesome) things I can't mention because I simply don't have the time.\n\nAnd now he's a coach. Wallace began the season in player development, but got promoted to the bench after the Pistons hired John Loyer midway through the season. Wallace has been behaving himself, too.\n\n“I don’t think he’ll be getting any techs,” Greg Monroe said. “At least, not like he used to.”\n\nWallace once had 41 technical fouls in a single season, an NBA record. But he was more than just a habitual complainer, more than just an antihero with a world of basketball talent and a tendency to rebel against authority. He scored inside and out, and he defended on the block or in the pick-and-roll. At his best, in his prime, he was one of the most difficult matchups in the NBA, one of the most complete contributors on any roster. He was almost like what Kevin Garnett might have been if Garnett had existed in an alternate universe, without the commitment of 45 men. That's not an insult to Wallace, either. Just an acknowledgement of his rare skill level, with a nod to the fact that he didn't always seem hell-bent on maximizing his ability.\n\nStill, Wallace has been there, he's done that.\n\n“That’s somebody that’s been in every situation that we’re going to be in,” Monroe said. “He’s won a championship. He knows what it takes to play and be successful at the highest level in this league. He’s been sharing his wealth. He’s been sharing as much knowledge as possible.\n\n“He still has that energy. He still has that passion. And for most players, that never goes away. You see Hall of Famers who have been done for years and years now, who still have that passion about that game. For somebody like him, who just stopped playing and went right into coaching, that passion is still going to be there.”\n\nWallace remains energetic and talkative, of course. But he has said he needs to tone it down now that he’s no longer playing. He must have accomplished that goal, too. He’s not even Caldwell-Pope’s loudest coach ever.\n\n“He’s second,” the rookie said. “(Georgia coach) Mark Fox is pretty vocal.”\n\nTo beat out Sheed, he must be. Even if I fear we've seen the last of Wallace's non-conformist prime, I'll still be paying attention to his second career. The man who never cared to be understood by the general public now serves as a mentor for two of the NBA's better young big men, Monroe and Andre Drummond. I've never been able to take my eyes off Wallace, and I don't plan to stop now.\n\nWhy would I ever want to?"
