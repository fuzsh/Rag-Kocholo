In his NBA career, spanning over 1,100 games, Wallace averaged 14.4 points and 6.7 rebounds per game. He was an All-Star in 2000, 2001, 2006 and 2008, and Wallace’s teams reached the postseason in 14 of his 16 seasons.\n\nAs a collegiate star at North Carolina, Wallace helped lead the Tar Heels to the 1995 Final Four. He entered the NBA Draft after his sophomore season, where he was selected fourth overall by the Washington Bullets in 1995.\n\nFollowing his playing career, Wallace’s previous coaching stops include time as an assistant with the Pistons in 2013-14 and as head coach at Charles E.
