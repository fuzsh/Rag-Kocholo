        "text": "While speaking on No Chill with Gilbert Arenas, Rasheed Wallace said he believes the reason for Green's hot temper is his experiences in the Detroit Pistons locker room during their 2004 championship campaign.\n\n\"That's our fault. And when I say 'our,' that's my fault, that's Ben Wallace's fault, that's Chauncey [Billups'] fault, that's Rip Hamilton's fault, that's Tayshaun [Prince's] fault... Everybody in that locker room because he grew up in our locker room,\" Wallace said. \"One of his best friends was the son of the GM, so he was around us... That's why he doing the bully s--t he doing now, in my opinion.\"\n\nGreen is 10 ejections away from tying Wallace's all-time record of 29, which excited the 49-year-old. He's already been ejected twice this year and he served a suspension earlier this season for putting Minnesota Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert in a headlock during a game"
