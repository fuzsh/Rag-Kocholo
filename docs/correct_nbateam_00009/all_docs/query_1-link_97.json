        "text": "Four-time NBA All-Star Rasheed Wallace has agreed to join new Lakers coach Darvin Ham's staff as an assistant coach, sources told The Athletic.\n\nWallace was recently identified as a candidate for Ham’s staff. The two sides have not yet reached the formal contract stage.\n\nHam and Wallace were teammates for two seasons in Detroit, including the Pistons' 2004 NBA championship team. Sources said assurances have been made in recent discussions about a coaching position for Wallace on staff. Wallace was most recently an assistant coach at the University of Memphis under Penny Hardaway this past season. Prior to joining Memphis, Wallace was an assistant for the Pistons in 2013-14 and head coach at Charles E. Jordan High School in Durham, N.C.\n\nWallace played for Washington, Portland, Atlanta, Detroit, Boston and New York in his 16-year NBA career after a standout college career at North Carolina.\n\nHam was hired to replace Frank Vogel, who was fired after three seasons after the Lakers failed to make the playoffs this season.\n\n(Photo: Allen Einstein / NBAE via Getty Images)"
