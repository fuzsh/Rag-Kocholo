        "text": "By Parvez Fatteh, Founder of http://sportingummah.com, sports@muslimobserver.com\n\nRetired Muslim basketballer, Rasheed Wallace, is in talks to possibly join the NBAâ€™s Detroit Pistons as an assistant coach. Detroitâ€™s President of Basketball Operations Joe Dumars said it is a â€œgood possibilityâ€ Wallace will be coming in to work with the Pistonsâ€™ young forwards.\n\nWallace, Dumars and new head coach Maurice Cheeks have been in talks to determine whether Wallace is aware of the work load that is entailed as an assistant coach. â€œMo came to me and said, â€˜Iâ€™ve got this crazy idea, man,â€™â€ Dumars told CBS Detroit, â€œand he said what it was, and I said, â€˜I think it could be great, man.â€™ I said, â€˜But we have to talk. We have to have some long talks.â€™ Thatâ€™s whatâ€™s happening as we speak.â€\n\nA 16-year NBA veteran, Wallace was a four-time All-Star and a part of Detroitâ€™s 2004 NBA championship team. He is, however, also known for his temper. And he accumulated over 300 technical fouls, and numerous ejections, throughout his career. â€œI donâ€™t think anybody has ever doubted his IQ and his intelligence,â€ Dumars said. â€œYou donâ€™t doubt that. You just canâ€™t get ejected from the bench. â€œBut I think with some young bigs like this, I think that kind of knowledge and personality could be good for them,â€ Dumars added.\n\n15-28"
