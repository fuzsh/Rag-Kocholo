        "text": "Rasheed Wallace is yet another old-school NBA player who says another \"back-in-the-day\" team would defeat the 2017 Golden State Warriors.\n\nWallace, a member of the 2004 NBA champion Detroit Pistons, said that Pistons team would defeat the Warriors and any of the more recent NBA champion squads. Wallace also played for the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\n\"Oh, we'd run through them,\" Wallace said on the Timeout with Taylor Rooks podcast. \"Not even close. We play defense.\"\n\nThe Warriors, who hold a 3-1 lead over the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals going into Monday night's Game 5 in Oakland, are trying to win their second NBA title in three years. They have reached the NBA Finals three consecutive seasons.\n\nThe Warriors ranked 11th in the league after allowing 104.3 points a game during the regular season. But they led the league in defensive field goal percentage and three-point percentage. The Pistons allowed a league-best 84.3 points a game, were third in defensive field goal percentage and held opponents to a league-best three-point percentage during the 2003-04 season.\n\n\"I think the Warriors' defensive strategy is, I'ma put up more shots than you. And if you try to match that, well you assed out because they got exceptional shooters. So that's their whole defensive thing,\" Wallace said. \"I don't call it good defense if the man came down and he shot a jump shot or shot a three and missed it, and the Warriors went back down to the other end and scored it. That's not good defense, and that's what happens a lot in this game now.\n\n\"They're not shutting nobody down. Even though you can't really shut a scorer down - you can slow him down. Now, you can't even slow the guys down.\"\n\nWallace said the Pistons, with a starting five that consisted of Ben Wallace, Chauncey Billups, Richard Hamilton, Tayshaun Prince and himself, would hold the high-scoring Warriors in check.\n\n\"With the way that we played in Detroit, we'd lock them down,\" Wallace said. \"The things that we did in Detroit will never be done again on defense. Our record of holding seven teams under 70 points? Never be done again.\""
