        "text": "Former Boston Celtics player, Rasheed Wallace, has agreed to terms to join Darvin Ham’s coaching staff for the Los Angeles Lakers. This coming after his latest stint in college basketball with the Memphis Tigers and Penny Hardaway. Ham and Wallace were teammates on the 2004 Detroit Pistons NBA Championship team.\n\nWallace had a great skill set as a player and brings his experience and background to the Lakers. His passion is what the Lakers need desperately right now after a moribund season. Celtics fans know his intensity first-hand, after his time in the green and white and before, reminding us of whether balls are capable of lying. This seems like a great first step in righting the ship in LA.\n\nPer Shams Charania:\n\nShams later notes that Wallace “was recently identified as a candidate for Ham’s staff,” however, adding that the “two sides have not yet reached a formal contract stage.”\n\nThis post originally appeared on Celtics Wire.
