Dray you already know how we got down on that squad!! Don’t matter the rules yours or ours …. y’all as a team were too fuckin little… you can ask more than half ya teammates (who we played against) on that roster… and we can keep it with that year b/c no way yall could fuck with any of us in our prime… at any point I can come on ya show or you can come visit mines and we can go thru the roster man for man coach for coach …."
