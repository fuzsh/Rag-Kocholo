        "text": "The Memphis Tigers have added another new face for the upcoming season. Head coach Penny Hardaway has reportedly added former Detroit Pistons legend and NBA champion, Rasheed Wallace, to his staff, according to The Athletic .\n\nThis isn’t the first former member of the Pistons that Hardaway has added to his team. In June, he hired Hall of Fame coach Larry Brown, who has plenty of familiarity with winning a championship. It’s also not the first time that Wallace and Brown have stepped onto the court together. Brown coached Wallace from 2003 to 2005, including the two’s championship run in 2004.\n\nNow the two will work together on the coaching side with Wallace bringing his own knowledge. After retiring from playing in the NBA after 16 seasons, Wallace returned to the Pistons as an assistant coach during the 2013-2014 season.\n\nHe then went to Jordan High School in Durham, North Carolina in 2019, which is where he’s been the team’s head basketball coach for the last two years. He was set to be the next head coach of Good Better Best Academy High School, also located in North Carolina, but that seems unlikely now that he is joining Hardaway’s staff."
