        "text": "Former Pistons big man Rasheed Wallace is highly regarded as the piece that helped push the 2004 championship team — the 'Goin' to Work' Pistons — to an elite level. Wallace teamed with Ben Wallace for a formidable frontcourt, and his ability to score on the perimeter and inside made him a valuable puzzle piece.\n\nWallace played alongside a plethora of great players during his 16 seasons in the NBA.\n\nThe four-time All-Star power forward played for six franchises, but he was most remembered for his time with the Portland Trail Blazers and then the Pistons.\n\nDuring a recent interview on \"All the Smoke,\" a podcast series hosted by former NBA players Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson, Wallace said if he had to choose four of his former teammates to play with under any of his former coaches, he'd pick the Pistons' popular starting five — Chauncey Billups, Richard \"Rip\" Hamilton, Tayshaun Prince, himself and Ben Wallace, along with head coach Larry Brown."
