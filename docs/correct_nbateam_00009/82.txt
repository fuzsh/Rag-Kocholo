Rasheed Wallace will become an assistant coach for the Pistons, brought in by head coach Maurice Cheeks to work with Detroit's core of young big men, according to the Detroit News.

In typical Rasheed fashion, he walked into the NBA Summer League at the Amway Center in Orlando wearing a Pistons polo shirt and Notre Dame hat, shocking and entertaining all at once.

Wallace was a member of the Pistons from 2004-2009, proving an integral piece of the 2004 championship team, his only NBA title. He did help the Pistons reach the NBA Finals on another occasion.

Wallace, who began his career in Portland, also has played for the Boston Celtics and New York Knicks.

As the Detroit News points out, Wallace has a history of helping develop young big men. He mentored Jermaine O'Neal, Zach Randolph and Jason Maxiel during his playing days. He will work to do the same as a coach with Detroit's Andre Drummond, Greg Monroe and Tony Mitchell.
