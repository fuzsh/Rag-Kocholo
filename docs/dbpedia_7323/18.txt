Martin Academy and Regina Red Sox Academy alum Theo Gibbs passed away unexpectedly on December 30 at the age of 18.

The Canadian catcher, who was born in Regina, Sask., committed to Lassen Community College in June 2022 and had trained with their program this fall.

“Our baseball program is heartbroken by the passing of Theo Gibbs,” said Frank Avilla, the head baseball coach at Lassen. “We send our prayers and wish his family comfort, peace, and strength as they mourn the loss of their oldest son. Although our time was brief, Theo's smile and energy was infectious. RIP young man.”

Lassen Athletics also released this tribute video:

Gibbs had honed his skills in the North Regina Little League and with the Regina White Sox of the Saskatchewan Premier Baseball League. He also played minor hockey for the Regina Shamrocks and the Regina Cougars.

“Our baseball community lost a fine young man recently with the sudden passing of Theo Gibbs,” reads a statement on the Baseball Sask Facebook page. “Please take a moment to have the amazing Gibbs family in your thoughts and prayers and if you are able to support in any way, a GoFundMe account has been setup.”
