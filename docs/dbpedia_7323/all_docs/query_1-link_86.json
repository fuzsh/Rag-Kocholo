        "text": "The Isle of Man Post Office has honored one of the British Crown Dependency's famous native sons, Sir Barry Gibb.\n\nThe music of the last surviving member of the Bee Gees is now celebrated on seven postage stamps, which were issued on Wednesday, the Isle of Man Post Office announced in a press release.\n\nThe singer-songwriter-producer was born in the Isle of Man's capital of Douglas on September 1, 1946. His family lived on the island until 1958 when they moved to Australia; they returned to Britain nine years later.\n\nIt's the second time in more than a decade that the Isle of Man Post Office has paid tribute to Gibb; in 2009, the Bee Gees—Gibb and his brothers, Maurice and Robin—were featured on postage to mark the trio's 50th anniversary as a group (Maurice died in 2003, followed by Robin in 2012).\n\nThe new stamps capture Gibb during different stages of his long career, which are the following:\n\nThe filming of Cucumber Castle, the 1969 Bee Gees television special.\n\nA portrait of the artist at his home in Miami in the late 1970s.\n\nGibb at the set of the 1978 film Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which starred the Bee Gees and Peter Frampton.\n\nGibb in performance during the Bee Gees' One for All tour in 1989.\n\nGibb in concert at the Ahoy in Rotterdam, circa 1989.\n\nThe 2017 edition of the Glastonbury Festival where the artist performed as a solo artist.\n\nGibb at his home studio in 2019.\n\n“I’m very proud of my Manx roots,” said Gibb in a press statement. “I was born and bred on the ancient, mystical, magical Isle of Man, and I have very fond memories of growing up there, so to appear on a set of its stamps is not only a wonderful surprise, but also an honour and a privilege.”\n\nMore than 60 years after the group’s formation, the popularity of the Bee Gees, who have sold over 200 million albums, continues. In 2020, the band's story was told in the highly acclaimed documentary, How Can You Mend a Broken Heart, which aired on HBO. Earlier this year, Gibb released a solo album, Greenfields: The Gibb Brothers’ Songbook Vol 1, which featured him collaborating with country music and Americana artists—among them Jason Isbell, Keith Urban, Miranda Lambert, Brandi Carlile and Dolly Parton—on new interpretations of the Bee Gees’ hits.\n\n2022 will mark the 45th anniversary of the Saturday Night Fever film and soundtrack, both of which catapulted the Bee Gees to global stardom with such iconic hits as “Stayin' Alive,” “How Deep Is Your Love,” “Night Fever” and “More Than a Woman.”\n\nPer Gibb's request, the stamps' issuance will heighten awareness for the music charity Nordoff Robbins, according to the Isle of Man Post Office.\n\n“May I offer my sincere congratulations to Isle of Man Post Office for this special edition stamp issue in honour of Sir Barry Gibb,” said the Hon. Laurence Skelly, the president of Tynwald, in a press statement. “The Gibb brothers (Bee Gees) are arguably the most famous Manx export. Throughout their careers they have all been outstanding ambassadors of the Isle of Man and so proud of their birthplace and I believe this issue and commemoration is fitting for the last surviving brother, Sir Barry Gibb.”"
