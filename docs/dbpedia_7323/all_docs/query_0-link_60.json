        "text": "Henry Richard Gibbs\n\nJanuary 2, 1926 – April 3, 2018\n\nIt is with heavy hearts we announce the passing of Henry (Dick) Richard Gibbs on April 3, 2018 at the Lakeview Pioneer Lodge. Henry was born on January 2, 1926 to Henry and Maud (nee Dove) in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. He was the oldest son and second of seven children. He completed his grade 10 at Peacock Technical School. He served in the Moose Jaw Infantry in WWII. When Henry returned to his hometown and worked with the CPR as a machinist, he met his beautiful bride, Margaret. She was hired to work as his housekeeper and nanny to his younger brothers, Ken and Alan, and sister, Doris. They married in 1955 in Moose Jaw, SK. There they extended their family to include Sheryl, Brenda, and Debbi. In 1961, the CPR transitioned* from steam to diesel engines so his position as machinist was redundant. He then chose steam and refrigeration engineering as his new profession. This was a testament to his determination and work ethic to be working shiftwork full time, a father, and studying at night. As Henry gained more education, he moved to larger power plants beginning in Fort Qu’Appelle, then the Dana Radar Base, and finally to Prince Albert Victoria Hospital and Burns. He finished his career working for the new uranium company, Cameco, and was hired on the original steam plant team at Rabbit Lake in 1976. He retired from Cameco in 1991. Henry was widowed in 1987 and remarried to Lenora Phelps in 1990. Henry was an active man in his retirement with golf, cycling, cross-country skiing, skidooing, and bowling. While he had a cabin at Emma Lake, he spent time golfing, fishing and swimming. He always loved reading about history and politics. Henry was a quiet man who enjoyed children and his home. Henry is survived by his three daughters: Sheryl (Mike) Kotelko, Brenda, and Debbi (Tim) Stevenson; grandchildren: Trina Overby (Shayne) Tammy Beauregard (Denis), Martin Gonzalez (Julissa), Kristin Sedgwick (James), Adam Paskaruk, (Jessica) Lisa Fiske (Justin), Dawn Heebner; great-grandchildren: Sabrina (Kendall), Sarah, Stephanie, Sean, Lucy and Macy, Taylor and Mason, Darien and Corbyn; great-great-grandchildren: Nixon, Elyse, and Sadie Boutin. Henry has two remaining brothers: Don (Sheila) from Courtney, BC, and Alan (June) from Vancouver, BC; and sister: Doris from Moose Jaw, SK. He is predeceased by his first wife: Margaret; his parents; his brothers: Ken and Norman; sisters: Dorothy and Nora; and son-in-law: Barry Hamre. A Veterans Honor Funeral Service will be held Saturday, April 7, 2018 – 11:00 am at Mackenzie Chapel, 130 9th St E,0 Prince Albert, SK. The family will greet friends at lunch held at the Legion Hall. Burial will follow at South Hill Cemetery. The family is most appreciative to the staffs of St. Michaels Haven in Cudworth and the Lakeview Pioneer Lodge in Wakaw. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Alzheimer’s Society, Lakeview Pioneer Lodge or to a charity of the donor’s choice. To share your memories and condolences, visit www.MackenzieChapel.ca.
