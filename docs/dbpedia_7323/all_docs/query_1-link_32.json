        "text": "Barry Alan Crompton Gibb CBE (born 1 September 1946, Douglas, Isle of Man) is a singer, songwriter and producer. He was born in Douglas, Isle of Man, to English parents. With his brothers Robin and Maurice, he formed the Bee Gees, one of the most successful pop groups of all time. The trio got their start in Australia, and found their major success when they returned to England. He is known for his high-pitched falsetto singing voice.\n\nfrom beegees-world.com [undated]: After having health problems, he was a vegetarian for some time.\n\nfrom Teen Bag Magazine August 1977 : Barry, on the other hand, says that he dislikes junk foods, and doesn't eat meats at all. \"Me and my wife Linda gave it up,\" he said. \"We became vegetarians a month ago. I don't mean to be insulting, but the meat in America is treated too much. It's treated in England, too, but not as much. I don't think it's good for you.\""
