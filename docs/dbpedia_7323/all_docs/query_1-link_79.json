        "text": "The Bee Gees were a singing trio of brothers — Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb — that became one of the most successful musical acts of all time. They were born on the on the Isle of Man to English parents, lived in Manchester, England and moved to Brisbane, Australia during their childhood years, where they began their musical careers. Their worldwide success came when they returned to England and signed with producer Robert Stigwood.\n\nThe multiple Grammy Award-winning group was successful for all of its forty years of recording music, but it had two distinct periods of exceptional success: as a harmonic \"soft rock\" act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as the foremost stars of the disco music era in the late 1970s. They were best rated band in the world in 1978.\n\nNo matter the style, the Bee Gees sang tight three-part harmonies that were instantly recognizable; as brothers, their voices blended perfectly, in the same way that The Beach Boys' did. Barry sang lead on many songs, and an R&B falsetto introduced in the disco years; Robin provided the clear vibrato lead that was a hallmark of their pre-disco music; Maurice sang high and low harmonies throughout their career. The three brothers co-wrote most of their hits, and they said that they felt like they became 'one person' when they were writing. The group's name was retired after Maurice died in January 2003, though in 2009 it was announced that Barry and Robin would re-form the group as a duo. However, this ended in May 2012 with the death of Robin.\n\nIt has been estimated that the Bee Gees' record sales total more than 220 million, easily making them one of the best-selling music artists of all-time. Their 1997 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame citation says \"Only Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Michael Jackson, Garth Brooks and Paul McCartney have outsold the Bee Gees\".[1]\n\nDespite popular belief, the group's name was not derived from \"Brothers Gibb\" or \"Barry Gibb\", but from the initials of Australian radio DJ Bill Gates and racetrack promoter Bill Goode.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly years[]\n\nThe Gibb brothers were born in Douglas on the Isle of Man to bandleader and drummer Hugh Gibb, and his wife Barbara Gibb; Barry Alan Crompton Gibb on 1 September 1946, and fraternal twins Robin Hugh Gibb and Maurice Ernest Gibb on 22 December 1949.\n\nThe family returned to father Hugh Gibb's home town of Chorlton cum Hardy, Manchester, England, in the early 1950s where the boys began to sing in harmony, debuting in public on one memorable occasion at the local Gaumont cinema. The boys were going to lip sync to a record, which other children had done at the cinema in previous weeks. However, as they were running to get there, Maurice dropped the record on the street, causing it to break. As a result, the brothers got on stage and sang themselves. They got a very good response from the crowd, which convinced them that singing was what they wanted to do with their lives.\n\nIn 1958, the Gibb family, including infant brother Andy (born 5 March 1958 in Manchester, England), emigrated to Redcliffe in Queensland, Australia. The still very young brothers began performing where they could to raise pocket change. First called the Rattlesnakes, later Wee Johnny Hayes & the Bluecats, they were introduced to radio DJ Bill Gates by racetrack promoter Bill Goode (who saw them perform at Brisbane's Speedway Circuit). Gates renamed them the \"Bee Gees\" after his and Goode's initials – thus the name was not specifically a reference to \"Brothers Gibb\".[1][2]\n\nBy 1960, the Bee Gees were featured on television shows, and in the next few years began working regularly at resorts on the Queensland coast. Barry drew the attention of Australian star Col Joye for his songwriting, and Joye helped the boys get a record deal with Festival Records in 1963 under the name \"Bee Gees.\" The three released two or three singles a year, while Barry supplied additional songs to other Australian artists.\n\nA minor hit in 1965, \"Wine and Women,\" led to the group's first LP The Bee Gee's Sing and Play 14 Barry Gibb Songs. By late 1966, the family decided to return to England, and seek their musical fortunes there. They were not confident, however, of success in England as Barry told a friend, Colin Stead, later of Lloyds World, that they would be back next year. While at sea in January, 1967, they heard that \"Spicks and Specks\", a song they had recorded in 1966, had gone to #1 in Australia.\n\nLate 60's - First Fame[]\n\nBefore their departure from Australia to their native England, Hugh Gibb sent demos to Brian Epstein who managed The Beatles and was director of NEMS, a British music store and promoter. Brian Epstein had given the demo tapes to Robert Stigwood who recently joined NEMS. After an audition with Stigwood in February 1967, The Bee Gees were signed to a five-year contract where Polydor Records would be the Bee Gees' record label in the U.K. and Atco Records would be the U.S. distributor. Work quickly began on their first international LP and Robert Stigwood launched a huge promotion to coincide with their first album.\n\nStigwood proclaimed that The Bee Gees were \"The Most Significant New Talent Of 1967\" and thus began the immediate comparison to The Beatles. Their first single, New York Mining Disaster 1941, was issued to radio station DJs with a blank white label with only the song title. Many DJs immediately assumed this was a new Beatles single and started playing the song in heavy rotation. This helped the song climb into the Top 20 in both the U.K. and the U.S. Only later did they realize that it was not The Beatles but in fact The Bee Gees, when their second single was released, To Love Somebody and again climbed into the Top 20 in the U.S. Originally written for Otis Redding, \"To Love Somebody\" was a soulful ballad sung by Barry, which has now become a pop standard covered by hundreds of artists such as Rod Stewart, Janis Joplin, The Animals, Nina Simone, and Michael Bolton just to name a few. Another single, Holiday was released in the U.S. and peaked at #16. The parent album, Bee Gees 1st was one of the first debut albums in the rock era entirely written by the artists themselves. \"Bee Gees 1st\" peaked at #7 in the U.S. and #8 in the U.K.\n\nFollowing the success of \"Bee Gees 1st\", the band, (which now consisted of Barry on rhythm guitar, Maurice on bass, Vince Melouney on lead guitar and Colin Petersen on drums) began work on their second album. Released in late 1967, Horizontal repeated the success of their first album, which contained the #1 U.K. (#11 U.S.) single Massachusetts and the #7 U.K. single World. The sound of the album \"Horizontal\" had a more rock sound than their previous release, though ballads like \"And The Sun Will Shine\" and \"Really And Sincerely\" are standouts. \"Horizontal\" made the Top 20 on both sides of the Atlantic, peaking at #12 in the U.S. and #16 in the U.K. To promote the album, The Bee Gees made their first appearances in America playing live concerts and television shows such as The Ed Sullivan Show and Laugh In.\n\nTwo more singles followed in early 1968, the ballad Words (#15 U.S., #8 U.K.) and the double A-sided single Jumbo b/w The Singer Sang His Song. \"Jumbo\" was the Bee Gees least successful single to date only reaching #57 in the U.S., but managing to climb to #25 in the U.K. The Bee Gees felt that \"The Singer Sang His Song\" was the stronger of the two and in fact reached #3 in The Netherlands. The year 1968 saw The Bee Gees reach the American Top Ten with the singles I've Gotta Get a Message to You (#8 U.S., #1 U.K.) and I Started A Joke (#6 U.S.) which were culled from the band's third album Idea, which was another Top 20 album in the U.S. (#17) and the U.K. (#4). Following the tour and TV special to promote \"Idea\", Vince Melouney left the group feeling that he wanted to play more of a blues style music than the Gibbs were writing. Melouney did achieve one feat while with the Bee Gees, as his composition \"Such A Shame\" (from Idea) is the only song, on any Bee Gees album, not written by a Gibb brother.\n\nBy 1969, the cracks began to show within the group as Robin began to feel that Robert Stigwood had been favoring Barry as the leader of the group. They began to record their next album, which was to be a concept album called \"Masterpeace\", which evolved into the double-album Odessa. Most rock critics feel this is the best Bee Gees album of the 60's, with it's progressive rock feel on the title track and along side other genres on music as heard on \"Marley Purt Drive\" and \"Give Your Best\", both country-flavored tunes, and signature ballads such as \"Melody Fair\" and First Of May, which became the only single from the album. Robin, feeling that the flipside, \"Lamplight\" should have been the A-Side, quit the group in mid-1969 and launching a solo career which saw brief success in Europe with the #2 hit \"Saved By The Bell\" and the album Robin's Reign. Barry & Maurice continued as The Bee Gees, even recruiting their sister Leslie to appear with them on stage.\n\nThe first of many Bee Gees compilations, Best of Bee Gees was released featuring the non-LP singles Words and the new single Tomorrow, Tomorrow which was a moderate hit in the U.K. reaching #23, but stalling at #54 in the U.S. The album itself sold very well and reached the Top Ten in both the U.S. and the U.K.\n\nWhile Robin was off on his own, Barry, Maurice & Colin continued on as The Bee Gees recording their next album, Cucumber Castle. There was also a TV special filmed to accompany the album, which was aired on the BBC in 1971. Colin Petersen played drums on the tracks recorded for the album, but was fired from the group after filming began and his parts were edited out of the final cut of the film. The leadoff single, Don't Forget to Remember was a big hit in the U.K. reaching #2, but was a disappointment in the U.S. only reaching #73. The next 2 singles, (I.O.I.O) and (If I Only Had My Mind On Something Else) barely scraped the charts and following the release of the album, Barry and Maurice parted ways and it seemed that The Bee Gees were finished. Barry recorded a solo album which never saw official release, though a single, \"I'll Kiss Your Memory\" was released without much interest. Maurice also recorded during this time, released the single \"Railroad\" and starred in West End theatre musical \"Sing A Rude Song\".\n\nEarly 1970s[]\n\nhttp://youtu.be/FE0khXl1ms0The three brothers reunited in the later part of 1970, their feelings about the split perhaps reflected in many songs about heartache and loneliness. Although they had lost traction on the British charts, the Bee Gees hit #3 in America with \"Lonely Days\" (from the reunion LP 2 Years On) and had their first U.S. #1 with \"How Can You Mend a Broken Heart?\" (from Trafalgar). The trio's talents were included in the soundtrack for the 1971 film Melody as they performed several songs for the title. In 1972, they hit #16 with \"Run to Me\" from the LP To Whom It May Concern; the single also returned them to the British top ten for the first time in three years.\n\nBy 1973, however, the Bee Gees were in a rut. The album, Life in a Tin Can, and its lead-off single, \"Saw a New Morning,\" sold poorly with the single peaking at #94. This was followed by an unreleased album (known as A Kick in the Head Is Worth Eight in the Pants).\n\nOn the advice of Ahmet Ertegün of their U.S. label Atlantic Records, Stigwood arranged for the group to record with famed soul music producer Arif Mardin. The resulting LP, Mr. Natural, included few ballads and foreshadowed the R&B direction of the rest of their career. But when it too failed to attract much interest, Mardin encouraged them to work with the soul music style.\n\nThe brothers attempted to assemble a live stage band that could replicate their studio sound. Lead guitarist Alan Kendall had come on board in 1971, but did not have much to do until Mr. Natural. For that album, they added drummer Dennis Bryon, and they later added ex-Strawbs keyboard player Blue Weaver, completing the late 1970s \"Bee Gees band\". Maurice, who had previously performed on piano, guitar, organ, mellotron, and bass guitar, as well as exotica like mandolin and Moog, now confined himself to bass onstage.\n\nAt Eric Clapton's suggestion, the brothers relocated to Miami, Florida, early in 1975 to record. After starting off with ballads, they eventually heeded the urging of Mardin and Stigwood and crafted more rhythmic disco songs like \"Jive Talkin'\" and \"Nights on Broadway.\" The latter featured Barry Gibb's first attempts at singing falsetto, in the backing vocals toward the end (There may be some question to this, however, as Maurice clearly sings the falsetto parts on \"Nights On Broadway\" in at least 2 live versions of the song from 1975: http://youtu.be/FE0khXl1ms0 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2SDf42guB4 Barry is shown singing the falsetto in another version from that year: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWPphe48oR4 ). The band liked the resulting new sound, and this time the public agreed, sending the LP Main Course, which became their first R&B album, up the charts. Barry Gibb's falsetto would become a staple of subsequent recordings. Mardin was unable to work with the group afterwards, but the Bee Gees enlisted Albhy Galuten and Karl Richardson who had worked with Mardin during the Main Course sessions. This production team would carry the Bee Gees through the rest of the 1970s.\n\nThe next album, Children of the World, was drenched in Barry's newfound falsetto and Blue's synthesizer disco licks. Led off by the single \"You Should Be Dancing,\" it pushed the Bee Gees to a level of stardom they had not previously achieved in the USA, though their new R&B/disco sound was not as popular with some die hard fans from the 1960s. The Bee Gees' band was now closer to a rock act, with rhythm guitar and real drums behind the falsetto.\n\nLate 1970s: Saturday Night Fever[]\n\nFollowing a successful live album, Here at Last… The Bee Gees… Live, The Bee Gees agreed to participate in the creation of the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack. It would be the turning point of their career. The cultural impact of both the film and the soundtrack was tremendous not only in the United States but also in the rest of the world, bringing the nascent disco scene into the mainstream.\n\nThree Bee Gees singles (\"How Deep Is Your Love\", \"Stayin' Alive\", and \"Night Fever\") reached #1 in the United States and most countries around the world, launching the most popular period of the disco era. They also penned the song \"If I Can't Have You\" which became a #1 hit for Yvonne Elliman. Such was the popularity of Saturday Night Fever that two different versions of the song \"More Than a Woman\" received airplay, one by The Bee Gees, which was the B-side of \"Stayin' Alive,\" and another by Tavares, which was the hit. The Gibb sound was inescapable. During an eight-month period beginning in the Christmas season of 1977, the brothers wrote six songs that held the #1 position on the U.S. charts for 25 of 32 consecutive weeks-- three under their own name, two for brother Andy Gibb, and the Yvonne Elliman single.\n\nFueled by the movie's success, the album broke multiple records, becoming the highest-selling album in recording history to that point. Saturday Night Fever has since sold circa 40 million copies worldwide, making it the best selling soundtrack album of all time.\n\nDuring this era, Barry and Robin wrote \"Emotion\" for Samantha Sang, who made it a Top Ten hit (the Bee Gees sang back-up vocals). A year later, Barry wrote the title song to the movie version of the Broadway musical Grease for Frankie Valli to perform, which went to #1. At one time, five songs written by the brothers Gibb were in the U.S. top ten at the same time. It was the first time this kind of chart dominance had been seen since April 1964, when the Beatles had all five of the top-five American singles.\n\nIn 1978, Barry Gibb became the only songwriter to have four straight number one hits in the U.S.A, breaking the John Lennon and Paul McCartney 1964 record. These songs were \"Stayin' Alive\", \"Love Is Thicker Than Water\", \"Night Fever\", and \"If I Can't Have You\".\n\nIn 1976, the Bee Gees recorded three Beatles cover songs - \"Golden Slumbers/Carry that Weight\", \"She Came in Through the Bathroom Window\" and \"Sun King\" - for the transitory musical documentary All This and World War II. The three Bee Gees also co-starred with Peter Frampton in the movie Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1978) loosely inspired by the classic 1967 Beatles album. The film had been heavily promoted prior to release, and was expected to enjoy great commercial success. However, the disjointed film was savaged by the movie critics, and ignored by the public.\n\nDuring this period, the Bee Gees' younger brother Andy followed his older siblings into a music career, and enjoyed considerable success. Produced by Barry, Andy Gibb's first three singles all topped the U.S. charts.\n\nThe Bee Gees' follow-up to Saturday Night Fever was the Spirits Having Flown album. It yielded three more #1 hits: \"Too Much Heaven\", \"Tragedy\", and \"Love You Inside Out.\" This gave the act six consecutive #1 singles in America within a year and a half (a record surpassed only by Whitney Houston). \"Too Much Heaven\" ended up as the Bee Gees' musical contribution to the Music for UNICEF Concert at the United Nations General Assembly in January 1979, a benefit organized by the Bee Gees, Robert Stigwood, and David Frost for UNICEF that was broadcast worldwide. The brothers donated the royalties from the song to the charity.\n\nThe Bee Gees even had a country hit in 1979 with \"Rest Your Love On Me\", the flip side of their pop hit \"Too Much Heaven\", written by Barry and made the Top 40 on the country charts. In 1981, Conway Twitty took \"Rest Your Love On Me\" to the top of the Country charts.\n\nThe Bee Gees' overwhelming success rose and fell with the disco bubble. By the end of 1979, disco was rapidly declining in popularity, and the backlash against disco put the Bee Gees' American career in a tailspin. Following their remarkable run from 1975–79, the act would have only one more top ten single in the U.S. and not until 1989. The Bee Gees' international popularity sustained somewhat less damage.\n\n1980s and 1990s[]\n\nIn 1981, the Bee Gees released the album Living Eyes, but with the disco backlash still running strong, the album failed to make the US top 40. In 1983, the Bee Gees had greater success with the soundtrack to Staying Alive, the sequel to Saturday Night Fever. The soundtrack was certified platinum in the US, and included their Top 30 hit \"Woman In You\".\n\nRobin and Barry Gibb released various solo albums in the 1980s but only with sporadic and moderate chart success. However, the brothers had continuing success behind the scenes, writing and producing for artists such as Barbra Streisand, Dionne Warwick, Diana Ross and Kenny Rogers, including Rogers' multi-million seller and U.S. #1 hit with Dolly Parton, \"Islands in the Stream\". Songs were sometime written with a particular artist in mind such as \"Celine Dion\". Immortality was written with Celine in mind and at the end of the recording of the song the three brothers were visibly affected by the result especially Barry who was seen to be weeping with emotion. That's profound!\n\nThe Bee Gees released the album E.S.P. in 1987, which sold over 3 million copies. The single \"You Win Again\" went to #1 in numerous countries, including Britain, but was a disappointment in the US, charting at #75.\n\nIn 1983, The Bee Gees were sued by a Chicago songwriter, Ronald Selle, who claimed that the Gibb brothers stole melodic material from one of his songs, \"Let It End,\" and used it in How Deep Is Your Love. At first, The Bee Gees lost the case; one juror said that a factor in the jury's decision was the Gibbs' failure to introduce expert testimony rebutting the plaintiff's expert testimony that it was \"impossible\" for the two songs to have been written independently. However, the verdict was overturned a few months later.\n\nOn March 10, 1988, younger brother Andy died at the age 30 as a result of Myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle due to a recent viral infection. His brothers acknowledge that Andy's past drug and alcohol use probably made his heart more susceptible to the ailment. Just before Andy's death, it was decided by the group that Andy would join them, which would have made the group a four piece. The Bee Gees' following album, One (1989), featured a song dedicated to Andy, \"Wish You Were Here\". The album also contained their first U.S. top ten hit (#7) in a decade, \"One\". After the album's release, they embarked on their first world tour in ten years.\n\nFollowing their next album, High Civilization, which contained the UK top five hit \"Secret Love,\" the Bee Gees went on a European tour. After the tour, Barry Gibb began to battle a serious back problem, which required surgery. In the early 1990s, Barry Gibb was not the only Bee Gee living with pain. Maurice had a serious drinking problem, which he had battled for many years, but finally conquered with the help of Alcoholics Anonymous. In 1992, the brothers' father, Hugh Gibb, died. The Gibb family believes he died from a broken heart after losing Andy.\n\nIn 1993, they released the album Size Isn't Everything, which contained the UK top five hit \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\". Four years later, they released the album Still Waters, which sold over four million copies, and debuted at #11 in the US. The album's first single, \"Alone\", gave them another UK Top 5 hit and a top 30 hit in the US.\n\nOne Night Only[]\n\nIn late 1997, the Bee Gees performed a live concert in Las Vegas, called One Night Only. The CD of the performance sold over 5 million copies. This led to a world tour of \"One Night Only\" concerts. The tour included playing to 56,000 people at London's Wembley Stadium on September 5 1998 and concluded in the newly-built Olympic Stadium in Sydney, Australia in March 1999.\n\nIn 1998, the group's score for Saturday Night Fever was incorporated into a stage production produced first in the West End theatre|West End and then on Broadway. They wrote three new songs for the adaptation.\n\nThe Bee Gees closed the decade with what turned out to be their last full-sized concert, known as BG2K, on December 31 1999.\n\nMaurice's death[]\n\nIn 2001, they released what turned out to be their final album of new material as a group, This Is Where I Came In. The album gave each member a chance to write in his own way, as well as composing songs together. For example, Maurice's compositions and leads are the \"Man in the Middle\" and \"Walking on Air,\" while Robin contributed \"Déjà Vu,\" \"Promise the Earth,\" and \"Embrace,\" and Barry contributed \"Loose Talk Costs Lives,\" \"Technicolour Dreams\", and \"Voice in the Wilderness\". The other songs are collaborative in writing and vocals. The Bee Gees' last public live show together was Live by Request, a special shown on A&E.\n\nMaurice died suddenly on January 12, 2003, from a strangulated intestine. Initially, his surviving brothers announced that they intended to carry on the name \"Bee Gees\" in his memory. But as time passed they decided to retire the group name, leaving it to represent the three brothers together. The same week Maurice died, Robin's solo album Magnet was released.\n\nAlthough there was talk of a memorial concert featuring both surviving brothers and invited guests, nothing materialized.[3] Since then Barry and Robin have continued to work independently and have both released recordings with other artists.\n\nAfter the Bee Gees[]\n\nIn late 2004, Robin embarked on a solo tour of Germany, Russia and Asia. During January 2005, Barry, Robin and several legendary rock artists recorded \"Grief Never Grows Old,\" the official tsunami relief record for the Disasters Emergency Committee. Later that year, Barry reunited with Barbra Streisand for her top-selling album 'Guilty Pleasures], released as Guilty Too in the UK as a sequel album to the previous Guilty. Robin continued touring in Europe.\n\nIn February 2006 Barry and Robin reunited on stage for a Miami charity concert to benefit the Diabetes Research Institute. It was their first public performance together since the death of brother Maurice. Barry and Robin also played at the 30th annual Prince's Trust Concert in the UK on May 20, 2006.\n\nRobin died on 20 May 2012 of kidney failure, after suffering many health setbacks in his last years, most notably a battle with colon cancer.\n\nSongwriting success[]\n\nThe Bee Gees have been incredibly successful, selling in excess of 180 million records and singles worldwide[4]. \"How Deep Is Your Love\" is their most popular composition, with over 400 versions by other artists in existence.\n\nTheir songs have been covered by singers of all stripes including Elvis Presley, Janis Joplin, Al Green, Eric Clapton, Lulu, Elton John, Tom Jones, and Nina Simone as well as newer acts like John Frusciante (who has been known to cover \"How Deep Is Your Love\" during Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts), and Feist singing a soulful \"Love You Inside Out\", Billy Corgan and Robert Smith covering \"To Love Somebody\", Steps and Destiny's Child. Songs written by the Gibbs but better known through versions by other artists include, \"Immortality\" by Celine Dion, \"If I Can't Have You\" by Yvonne Elliman, \"Chain Reaction\" by Diana Ross,\"Spicks and specks\" by Status Quo , \"Emotion\" by Samantha Sang and Destiny's Child, \"Come On Over\", by Olivia Newton-John, \"Warm Ride\" by Graham Bonnet, \"Guilty\" and \"Woman in Love\" by Barbra Streisand, \"Heartbreaker\" by Dionne Warwick, \"Islands in the Stream\" by Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton, \"Grease\" by Frankie Valli, and \"Only One Woman\" by The Marbles. Many hit covers and album tracks of the Bee Gees' songs have been recorded, and the band's music has also been sampled by dozens of hip hop artists.\n\nAwards & Recognition[]\n\nThe Bee Gees were inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997; fittingly, the presenter of the award to \"Britain's first family of harmony\"[5] was Brian Wilson, leader of the Beach Boys, America's first family of rock harmony. The Bee Gees were inducted into The Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2001 as well as the ARIA Hall of Fame in 1997.\n\nGrammy Awards[]\n\n1977 Best Pop Vocal Performance By A Group - \"How Deep Is Your Love\"\n\n1978 Best Pop Vocal Performance By A Duo Or Group - \"Saturday Night Fever\"\n\n1978 Album of the Year - \"Saturday Night Fever\"\n\n1978 Producer of the Year - \"Saturday Night Fever\"\n\n1978 Best Arrangement of Voices - \"Stayin' Alive\"\n\n1980 Best Pop Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal - \"Guilty\"\n\n2000 Lifetime Achievement Award\n\n2003 Legend Award\n\n2004 Hall Of Fame Award - \"Saturday Night Fever\"\n\nCommemorative stamps[]\n\nIn October 1999 the Isle of Man Post Office unveiled a set of 6 stamps honoring their native sons' music.
