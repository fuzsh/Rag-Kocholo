        "text": "Who were the Bee Gees?\n\nBee Gees - Stayin' Alive (1977)\n\nThe Bee Gees were a pop group formed in 1958, consisting of brothers Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb, the latter of which were twins.\n\nThe trio were particularly huge in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and later as prominent disco performers in the mid-to-late 1970s.\n\nThe group were known for their three-part tight harmonies. Robin's clear vibrato lead vocals were the main hallmark of their earlier songs, while Barry's high falsetto became their signature sound in later years.\n\nThe Gibbs wrote all of their own hits, as well as writing and producing several massive hits for other artists.\n\nWhere were the Bee Gees from?\n\nThey were born on the Isle of Man to English parents, and lived in Chorlton, Manchester until the late 1950s.\n\nThe family moved to Redcliffe, in Queensland, Australia. After achieving their first chart success in Australia, they returned to the UK in 1967.\n\nWhy were they called the Bee Gees?\n\nLocal Australian DJ Bill Gates (not that one) renamed the brothers' group to the BG's (later changed to 'Bee Gees') after his, speedway promoter Bill Goode and Barry Gibb's initials.\n\nThus, the name was not specifically a reference to 'Brothers Gibb', despite popular belief.\n\nWhich Bee Gees are still alive?\n\nSadly, Maurice Gibb died at the age of 53 in 2003 due to complications of a twisted intestine.\n\nRobin Gibb died aged 62 in 2012 after being diagnosed with cancer.\n\nBarry Gibb is still performing, and was awarded a knighthood in 2017.\n\nHow many records have the Bee Gees sold?\n\nBee Gees - How Deep Is Your Love (1977)\n\nDuring their career, the Bee Gees scored 19 UK top 10 singles, including five number ones.\n\nAmong their many hits include 'Stayin' Alive', 'Night Fever', 'How Deep is Your Love', 'Tragedy', 'More than a Woman', 'Massachusetts', 'You Win Again' and 'Jive Talkin''.\n\nThey have sold more than 220 million records worldwide.\n\nWhat songs did the Bee Gees write for other artists?\n\nKENNY ROGERS & DOLLY PARTON - ISLANDS IN THE STREAM - HQ Audio\n\nBarry Gibb and his brothers wrote hits for many others.\n\nThey include 'Grease' by Frankie Valli from the movie of the same name, 'Woman in Love' by Barbra Streisand, 'Emotion' by Samantha Sang, 'If I Can't Have You' by Yvonne Elliman, 'Heartbreaker' by Dionne Warwick and 'Islands in the Stream' by Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton.\n\nWho were the Bee Gees married to?\n\nMaurice Gibb was married to singer Lulu from 1969 to 1975. He married his second wife, Yvonne Spenceley Gibb, later in 1975, and it lasted until his death.\n\nRobin Gibb married secretary Molly Hullis in 1968, and they divorced in 1980. He later married artist Dwina Murphy.\n\nBarry was married to Maureen Bates from 1966 to 1970. Later that year, he married former Miss Edinburgh, Linda Gray."
