Although our time was brief, Theo's smile and energy was infectious. RIP young man.”\n\nLassen Athletics also released this tribute video:\n\nGibbs had honed his skills in the North Regina Little League and with the Regina White Sox of the Saskatchewan Premier Baseball League. He also played minor hockey for the Regina Shamrocks and the Regina Cougars.\n\n“Our baseball community lost a fine young man recently with the sudden passing of Theo Gibbs,” reads a statement on the Baseball Sask Facebook page. “Please take a moment to have the amazing Gibbs family in your thoughts and prayers and if you are able to support in any way, a GoFundMe account has been setup.”\n\nYou can contribute to the GoFundMe page here."
