        "text": "You have an ideal of which you are only partially conscious, but it has a great influence on your psychology. You are determined to preserve your integrity and purity. Even though you may not be aware of it, you are often preoccupied by this predicament. How can you live in this world and remain true to yourself? How can you succeed in life without sacrificing your ideals? It’s the eternal philosophical dilemma. You have developed a solution, however; you elaborate a fairly strict code of behavior and try to obey it as much as possible. The path that you walk in life is straight and narrow. You yearn for a life that would reflect the ideal you have set for yourself, as free as possible from irrational mysteries and human failings. In fact, although you may sometimes seem a bit rigid, a bit lacking in perspective, it is because your mind understands the macrocosm through the microcosm, and you must observe the completed system before you will form your opinion. You are especially good at sorting and choosing, because your mind is like a filter. It rejects the impurities and only accepts the pure and useful. Analysis, deductive reasoning, and a sense of experimentation are your qualities. You possess great meticulousness and precision which make you a quick and efficient worker. However, you may rely too strongly on your analytical faculties, to the detriment of an overall perception of reality. You like purity and therefore justice. Thus, you are sensitive to human suffering, especially as a result of social injustice, and you will try to remedy the situation according to what you have learned. Once again, the overriding themes of your personality emerge. You want to preserve an ideal, avoid deterioration, change, adulteration. You are offended by imperfection and try to find ways to correct it. You are eager to help, to be useful, to serve a great cause, but you sometimes do not know whom or what you seek to serve. Whatever purpose you adopt, you must learn to help without surrendering yourself entirely; you tend to try to disappear into the background of a hierarchy. You are sometimes attracted by readymade systems, which soothe a certain anxiety you have. You wouldn’t mind devoting yourself to a state, a big corporation, or a dogma. It would be reasonable and satisfying. But you sometimes forget to rebel a bit – to evaluate whether the end justifies the means. You are reassured by predictability. When you commit yourself, you want to know exactly where you are bound and how. This may be a bit of\n\nDue to the influence of Scorpio rising, you have a powerful, forthright nature with a penchant for possessiveness, be it material, mental, or spiritual. Your own mind proceeds from a fairly skeptical, steadfast viewpoint, and though you oscillate between objectivity and subjectivity, you are curious and critical in a constructive way. You have the mental potential to be a gifted investigator and diagnostician. You also exert a strong attraction and can be quite charming, so you are bound to be a social success. You possess rigid and unilateral determination, a capacity for self-control, and the ability to face challenges with stubbornness and energy. You are sensual and sensitive, and love and lust will be vital to your destiny. Because you seek intense emotional experiences and your instincts sometimes control your feelings, your love life will not be bland or banal.\n\nBarry Gibb is a pleasure lover and will find self-fulfillment in creative activities.\n\nBarry Gibb tended to live in an imaginary world; the distant and abstract sometimes interested him more than what was right at hand and realistic.\n\nAt the time of your birth, your sun sign was located in Scorpio (the Scorpion), while the moon was passing through the sign of Virgo (the Virgin). A summary of the various clues mentioned above provide your personality profile. The following key words capture the essence of your character and indicate certain contradictions which may be sources of tension:\n\nPugnacity – Modesty – Charisma – Analytical thought – Dignity – Strict logic – Shrewdness – Attention to detail – Concentration – Perfectionism – Optimism – Worry and anxiety – Common sense – Nervousness.\n\nEndowed with an acrobatic mind and discerning intelligence and understanding, you display great abilities for analysis, discrimination, and investigation which are your passport to social and personal success. You are aggressively competitive, and are armed for the combat with a sharp wit which immediately penetrates the weaknesses of your rivals. As a result, you are likely to earn yourself a spot high in the pecking order, and will not shrink from the harsh realities of life. Your intellect, skeptical by instinct, is supremely rational and realistic.\n\nBorn three and a half to seven days after the rising of the new moon, you are said to be a “solitary moon” lunar type. This “soli-lunar” configuration indicates that you may need to make an effort to free yourself from the past. Something related to your childhood, parents, or ancestors is holding you back, impairing your effectiveness and could stand to be overcome. Due to your past, you refuse tried-and-true models, are always fighting to justify your innovative viewpoints, and tend to break away from tradition. You are hardly ever aware that you are making career and lifestyle choices which are based on an urge to modify your relationship to society, and the rigid standards and models from the past."
