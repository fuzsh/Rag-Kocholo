        "text": "NHL AWARDS AND HONORS\n\nMiscellaneous: Scored goal in his first NHL game. ... Was on California team that relocated to Cleveland in June 1976. ... Missed part of 1977-78 season with torn knee ligaments. ... Claimed by Hartford after being left unprotected by Colorado in 1979 NHL Expansion Draft on June 13, 1979. Hartford immediately traded him to N.Y. Islanders for Terry Richardson. N.Y. Islanders immediately traded him to St. Louis to complete a three-team deal in which St. Louis had sent Richardson and Barry Gibbs to N.Y. Islanders in exchange for future considerations (Klassen and promise that N.Y. Islanders would trade Gibbs to Los Angeles so that Tom Williams could be sent to St. Louis). The multiple trades made him the only player in NHL history to be property of four different teams (Colorado, Hartford, N.Y. Islanders, St. Louis) in one day. ... Became a penalty-killing specialist during his years in St. Louis. ... Chose to retire after being released by St. Louis and failing to catch on with another team in November 1983."
