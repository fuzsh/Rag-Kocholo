        "text": "Anthony was born in 1965 and raised in Burbank, California with his identical twin brother Eddie. As young boys the two would sneak into the NBC TV Studios across the street from their home and watch the celebrities perform.\n\nAfter going to California institute of the Arts to receive a degree in Music, he moved to San Diego to receive a minor in Police Science. He graduated from The San Diego Police Academy in the early ’90s ready to go in to law enforcement, when The Lord took him back to his roots of entertaining. He joined forces with his Twin Brother Eddie, after Carol Burnett suggested to them that they put a show together based on a pair of identical twins that look and sound like many different super stars.\n\nAt home, the brothers played together for hours, listening to the shows they had recorded including “The Sonny & Cher Show,” “The Carol Burnett Show,” and “Laugh-In”.\n\nThey mimicked the stars voices and learned their comedy routines so they could later perform for their family, friends and neighbors.\n\nAnthony focused on singing and playing the piano while attending the California Institute of the Arts. After graduating, Carol Burnett, suggested that he join forces with his brother Eddie (who was touring with the world-renowned Cabaret Show “La Cage aux Follies”).\n\nMs. Burnett was convinced that a show done by identical twin brothers, performing as a host of superstars would be a very unique combination. She was right. After 10 years of performing all over the world, “The Edwards Twins” and their show “Celebrities On Stage” have developed into one of the most fascinating acts in show business.\n\nAnthony has mastered more than 75 characters including: Neil Diamond, Billy Joel, Elton John, Rod Stewart, Tom Jones, Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles, and Engelbert Humperdinck among many others. When The Edwards Twins are onstage, they move, sing and perform like the actual stars and each of their impersonations is done to perfection.\n\nAfter watching a performance, a Senior Editor at PEOPLE MAGAZINE was moved to write “They bring such love and attention to recreating celebrities, that in many ways they are better than watching the real thing.”"
