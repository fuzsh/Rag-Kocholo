        "text": "Post by RINGO on\n\nSir Barry Alan Crompton Gibb (1 September 1946 - present)\n\nMember Of: Bee Gees (1958 - 2003)\n\nVocal Range: A1 - A5\n\n{Vocal Summary}Owner of the most notorious falsetto voice in pop history, Barry Gibb wasn't always a face of the disco movement and the butt of castrati jokes. A versatile songwriter and vocalist, Gibb was the middle-placed voice of the three Bee Gees brothers, although his place in the harmony stack could range anywhere from the highest falsetto harmonies to the lowest. Possessing a distinct nasality, Gibb's falsetto tone is an acquired taste to put it kindly, but in his prime he could occasionally pull off some nice chesty belts. In recent years his voice has become weaker and far more vibrato-heavy, but his trademark falsetto still remains largely intact.\n\nWritten by RINGO .\n\n{Album Ranges}Bee Gees\n\nSpicks and Specks (1966): A2 - G4 - D5\n\nBee Gees' First (1967): C3 - G4\n\nHorizontal (1968): B2 - G4 - C♯5\n\nIdea (1968): A2 - A4\n\nOdessa (1969): C3 - G4 - B4\n\nCucumber Castle (1970): B2 - A4 - D5\n\n2 Years On (1970): B2 - G4\n\nTrafalgar (1971): D3 - A4 - E5\n\nTo Whom It May Concern (1972): B2 - G4\n\nLife in a Tin Can (1973): B2 - A4\n\nMr. Natural (1974): C3 - B♭4 - C5\n\nMain Course (1975): F♯2 - A4 - G♯5\n\nChildren of the World (1976): C3 - G4 - G♯5\n\nSpirits Having Flown (1979): G2 - F4 - G5\n\nLiving Eyes (1981): A2 - F♯4 - F♯5\n\nE.S.P.
