        "text": "I recently saw a very good documentary about the life and career of the Bee Gees. It was terribly sad, as in the end Barry Gibb is the only brother left. The last in a close knit family.\n\nBut it got me thinking.....at one time this band was one of the most popular on the planet, and then thanks to a rapidly spreading movement against disco, they were almost wiped out. Why did that happen?\n\nI should start out by saying that although I am rather nostalgic about the music the Gibb brothers produced, arising as it did during my adolescence, I don't revere them in any way as people. They were just guys, actually one of the first groups of guys swamped by global popularity. All things considered and including their rather minor slips from grace during their careers, I think they did rather well.\n\nI looked at a few other groups that rose to stardom and then burnt out, and I found that there really weren't any that followed the Bee Gees trajectory. The Beatles attained probably greater fame, but split up before they could be pilloried for becoming irrelevant or too self indulgent. Metallica apparently produced good music, for people who share that style of music, but screwed themselves from becoming more mainstream by their ridiculous and offensive conduct and opinions. Canadian group Nickelback had a nice tight sound and good harmonics, but as soon as listeners started examining lyrics, they found the songs were rampant with misogyny, crudeness and other offensive material. Coupled with lead singer Chad Kroeger's inability to behave well under the public eye, this led to a pretty quick nose dive from a high height.\n\nThere are lots of other bands that rose to stardom and fell just as fast, and from a quick survey of music history, they all seem to have been unable to tolerate public scrutiny in some way or other.\n\nThe Gibb brothers never had that problem. They squabbled amongst themselves, not uncommon for brothers, they had occasional marital issues, and a few issues with substance abuse. None of these is as egregious as the foibles of some of the other groups I researched. So why did they fall from grace so precipitously?\n\nThe documentary I watched posited the theory that the band had been stylistically grouped with the disco sound. Disco suffered a huge backlash due to profiteering and suffocating of the market by greedy record and promotional companies hopping on the disco bandwagon. There was even the suggestion that because much of the disco sound arose from black music in its various forms, the backlash had racist undertones.\n\nWhatever the causes of the backlash, because the Bee Gees were grouped with disco they went down in flames with it. A shame really, because the songwriting talents of these three men (and to a lesser extent, younger brother Andy) were almost unmatched during that era. This is evidenced by tremendously successful songs written by them for Barbara Streisand, Dionne Warwick, Donna Summer, and even Celine Dionne, then the harbinger of a new era in music. Did we really grow to Hate them because of their association with disco and their use of a falsetto sound? Really? Could we not have just listened to what we liked and left the Bee Gees alone?\n\nI have an alternate theory, for which I have no proof. But I have seen the same phenomenon occur in other parts of my life.\n\nWhat I witnessed during that fall of the Bee Gees in the 1980's was a degree of spite that surprised me. I could understand a style of music falling out of favour, sure. But to pillory the character of the musicians for producing that style? Seems a bit off to me.\n\nMy alternate theory is simply this. The vast majority of western society is either blue collar or middle class. We work our butts off to pay off debt, establish a home and quality of life, and put a few bucks aside for old age. Along come these three guys who earn adulation and fabulous riches because they sing a few songs and play some instruments (and have perfect hair). Is it possible that some of the vitriol aimed at the Gibb brothers was motivated not by a hatred of disco music but a little by envy?\n\nHere is a case to compare to. Ryan Reynolds is a beloved Canadian actor who has achieved fame and significant wealth through his career. But instead of being hated and pilloried for his success and the style of pieces he works on, he is beloved. Why? What is the difference between Ryan and the Gibbs?\n\nThe biggest difference is that especially in Canada, Reynolds is well know to share the wealth, not because of his own publicity machine, but because of the gratitude of the groups he helps. Recently awarded the Order of Canada, our highest honour, Ryan Reynolds has shared his good fortune with food banks, wild life preserves, cultural organizations, and many others. Because the award took place during the pandemic, no official ceremony could take place, and so a song and accompanying video were produced to publicize the award. Written and performed by another Canadian icon, Steven Page, the video even draws a bit of a tear from a cynic like me.\n\nSo where does that leave us with the Bee Gees and their apparent fall from grace? The band was largely non-political, keeping their philanthropy mostly to themselves. Possessed of extremely strong family values, presumably the vast majority of their wealth was bestowed on family members.\n\nI am not suggesting that the Gibbs did and do not support charitable organizations, I could find mention of a few. Diabetes and the Miami Beach Health foundation, as well as a leadership program and Whatever it Takes, a sort of United Way of Celebrity Charities are the ones I found listed with only a quick search. I also found that they donated money to charities aimed at famine in Africa, a well known cause in the 1980's. I have no idea the amounts of money spent on these worthy causes. Although their philanthropy seems limited compared to Ryan Reynolds, they did give money, they did share.\n\nSo I'm stumped. They gave away money too, although perhaps the fact that they were not beloved Canadians detracted from their cachet. (No? ;-) ) .\n\nSo why was their fall from grace so extreme? Was it envy that did them in, and a failure to counteract that envy with significant enough sharing of the wealth? Was it purely the association with Disco and the hated profiteering it engendered? Was it the homophobia pricked by the use of the falsetto sound? A racist reaction to their rhythm and blues roots?\n\nI really can't answer it. I looked around a bit and tried to find an obvious cause, but I just can't answer it. What I can tell you is that throughout the documentary, Barry Gibb, the last man standing, comes across as a genuinely nice guy, at the end of his life, musing over the wisdom he has gained through experience.\n\nAnd on that note, think I will go and listen to Saturday Night Fever for a bit.\n\nPublished on"
