        "text": "Their breakthrough hit \"Spicks and Specks\" (as in bits 'n' pieces) was No. 1 in Australia in 1967. It is an upbeat number that deals with past teen relationships. The song was used to close the show in their concerts in the late '60s, In later years it was removed from the group's play list because of the song title's similarity to a slang word for Hispanic.\n\nDaughter Alexandra Lianna \"Ali\" was born nearly 4 months early when Linda contracted a bacterial infection from one of their sons she weighed only 1 LB 9 Oz at birth.\n\nFour sons: Steve Gibb (b. 1 December 1973), Ashley Gibb (b. 8 September 1977), Travis Gibb (b. 10 January 1981) and Michael Gibb (b. 1 December 1984). His only daughter, Alexandra Gibb (b. 29 December 1991).\n\nWithin a span of just twelve years (1971-1983) he wrote or co-wrote fifteen U.S. number one hits, including six consecutive chart toppers -- a record shared with John Lennon and Paul McCartney.\n\nThe \"Gibb Brothers\" lived on Cribb Island - a former suburb of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, which is now part of the site of Brisbane Airport, Australia's third largest airport.\n\nWhen he made a cameo in an episode of Only Fools and Horses.... (1981) set in Miami, David Jason described him as wonderfully self-effacing. He invited Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst into his house, gave them tea and showed them around; the place was like a palace. Gibb was a big fan of the show and used to get tapes of it sent to America."
