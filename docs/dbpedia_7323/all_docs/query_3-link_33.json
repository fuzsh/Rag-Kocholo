        "text": "WHEN they stepped onstage at the Grammys ceremonies in February to accept the Legend Award, Barry and Robin Gibb, the two remaining Bee Gees, gave a touching tribute to their brother Maurice, who died a month earlier at the age of 53. Barry Gibb told the audience that ''the measure of a man is his family'' and gracefully handed the gold statue to Maurice's son, Adam.\n\nIt was an appearance that cast the Gibb family as close-knit. But it masked a dispute in recent years among the three brothers, whose falsetto singing in the soundtrack of the film ''Saturday Night Fever'' came to symbolize the harmonies of the disco world in the late 1970's. That soundtrack, which once sent polyester partyers swooping onto dance floors around the world, turned the Gibbs into megastars.\n\nThough they continued to work together on albums and their families live within minutes of one another in Miami, Barry Gibb, the oldest, has at times been unhappy with his brothers, in part over the management of the Gibb business interests.\n\nBy January of this year, his relationship with Robin had so deteriorated that Barry did not even know that Robin had made ''Magnet,'' his first solo album since 1985, until it was released. And Barry said he was ''devastated'' to learn that Robin, in that album, had altered a classic Bee Gees song, ''Wish You Were Here.''\n\nAlthough Barry Gibb's rapport with Maurice was better, in 2001 Barry severed ties with Michael Eaton, a British lawyer who represented the group for over 30 years.\n\nMaurice and Robin Gibb, who were fraternal twins, stayed with Mr. Eaton. But Barry hired his own team to direct his business affairs. And in a striking divergence from decades in which the trio acted as one, Barry decided last year to have Warner/Chappell Music, a part of AOL Time Warner, handle his interest in the song publishing business. His brothers stayed with the group's longtime publisher, the BMG unit of Bertelsmann.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
