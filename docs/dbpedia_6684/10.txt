Join the Editorial Board

We are currently looking to expand our Editorial Board. To apply to be an Editorial Board Member/Associate Editor, please apply using the form linked in this article. You should hold a PhD (or similar higher degree), have a publication track record (h-index>8), and ideally have some academic editing experience.

Guest Editors & Theme Issue Proposals

JMIR Publications welcomes guest editors to assemble a theme issue on a special subtopic. For more information, please visit How to guest edit a theme issue and How to suggest a theme issue.

This may be particularly interesting for workshop and conference organizers putting together a grant-funded event (eg, with invited experts) on a topic in scope for the journal. JMIR Publications can then be used as a dissemination vehicle. (Funding through grants or other sources is usually required and should be budgeted for in grant proposals. Letters of support are available from the JMIR Publications editor, if needed. Note that granting agencies such as NLM or CIHR usually want to see some sort of knowledge translation activities in workshop proposals, and have in the past funded the JMIR Publications APFs.)

The task of the guest editor(s) is generally

to solicit manuscripts from colleagues concerning the selected topic,

to select peer-reviewers for incoming manuscripts,

to make decisions (together with the editorial board) on article revisions and acceptance, and

to write an editorial for the theme issue

to secure funding to sponsor the APFs for published papers (usually in the $10-20k range).

Alternatively, the conference abstracts may be published in a supplement, with or without selected full papers published later in a theme issue or in regular JMIR Publications issues. See We are organizing a conference - can we publish our proceedings / abstracts in iproceedings? regarding publishing conference abstracts.
