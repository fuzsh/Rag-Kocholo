        "text": "The internet has long replaced the doctor's office as the place many Canadians get their health information.\n\nBut now it's also become the primary place Canadians are talking about health care, and researchers suggest public health officials need to start listening to those conversations.\n\nToronto-based researcher Dr. Gunther Eysenbach was watching how internet searches could signal a coming disease outbreak long before Google published its own study predicting flu outbreaks in 2009.\n\nBut Eysenbach said internet surveillance can help with more than predicting an outbreak or detecting an early outbreak.\n\n'The new frontier for how the internet is used for health information is social media.' â€” Gunther Eysenbach\n\n\"You want to know what the public thinks and does in the context of an epidemic and where the knowledge gaps are,\" he said in an interview.\n\nIn November, Eysenbach and a colleague published a study of two million messages sent over the social media site Twitter during the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic.\n\nWatching social media important\n\nWhile about half were just people sending out links to news stories, the other half were people talking about personal experience with the flu or their opinions of the vaccine.\n\nSharp peaks in tweet volume often correlated with major news events, like the arrival of vaccines or in one case, news that one of the actors in the Harry Potter films had come down with the flu.\n\nIt sounds like trivial data, but there is the opportunity for public health officials to use it if they're watching, Eysenbach said.\n\n\"When public health officials talk about social media and using social media, what they mean is basically getting our messages out to the public but that's not what the social web is all about,\" Eysenbach said.\n\n\"It is only half the equation. The other half is also using this to learn from what people are talking about on the social web and using that information to customize and tailor your own public health message.\"\n\nBlog front\n\nOttawa-based researcher Dr. Kumanan Wilson was part of a team who studied how the HPV vaccine was being discussed online.\n\nThe 2009 study looked into discussions on the site MySpace and identified 303 blogs tackling the issue. They found that blogs written by men were more likely to be against the vaccine, who also had bigger social networks online than women.\n\n\"Blog analysis is a useful tool for public health officials to profile vaccine criticism and to design appropriate educational information tailored to respond to alternative media/alternative information actively,\" the study found.\n\nPublic health officials need to be watching online to figure out the challenges they will face in communicating their own messages, Wilson said in an interview.\n\n\"Another problem, though, with all of this is that 10 per cent of the people drive 90 per cent of the content,\" he said. \"Is that truly representative of the views out there or a local minority dominating the blogs?\"\n\nEysenbach said he and his colleagues are looking at other ways to use social media surveillance for health research, like monitoring information exchange on chronic diseases or concepts like pain.\n\nGoogle.org, which created the flu trends application, said doing so is difficult, though it, too, is looking for new ways.\n\n\"Flu is a natural one because it has a seasonal pattern and it also affects a lot of people,\" said Jamie Yood, a spokesperson for the search engine's philanthropic branch.\n\n\"You are also only really able to do it if people are online, so in some of the developing countries where there are fewer people online it is more difficult to use it as a surveillance tool.\""
