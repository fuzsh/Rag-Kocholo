        "text": "A Series of Unfortunate Events\n\nIf you are interested in stories with happy endings, you would be better off reading some other story. In this story, not only is there no happy ending, there is no happy beginning and very few happy things in the middle.\n\n-Lemony Snicket, A Series of Unfortunate Events\n\nOn October 16, 2004, three press releases from the University College London (UCL) (Multimedia Appendix 1), Wiley InterScience in the United Kingdom, publishers of The Cochrane Library, and the Center for the Advancement of Health (CFAH) in the United States were widely disseminated to announce the result of a just-published Cochrane review synthesizing \"studies on Internet health\" (UCL press release) or, more accurately, interactive health communication applications (IHCAs) [1]. The Cochrane review seemed to arrive at stunning results that \"confound conventional wisdom\" (quote of the Principal Investigator, taken from the UCL press release): the Cochrane investigators found that these applications lead to an increase in knowledge and positive feelings of social support, but they had deleterious effects on health outcomes, that is, \"may leave [users] in worse health\" (UCL press release). These surprising results were immediately jumped on by the mass media and led to widely publicized news stories around the globe, with often sensationalistic and oversimplified headlines, such as \"Internet Makes Us Sick,\" \"Knowledge May Be Hazardous to Web Consumers' Health,\" \"Too Much Advice Can Be Bad for Your Health,\" \"Click to Get Sick?\" and even \"Is Cybermedicine Killing You?\" (see , , and Multimedia Appendix 2).\n\nTable 1\n\nWeb Not Always Safe Health Source for Some\n\nHON News (Health on the Net Foundation), Switzerland - Oct 21, 2004Internet medical advice risky\n\nBig News Network.com, Australia - Oct 18, 2004Patients using the Net at risk: report\n\nThe Age, Australia - Oct 17, 2004Internet-based health information may be hazardous: study\n\nCBC News, Canada - Oct 18, 2004Too Much Advice Could Be Bad for Your Health\n\nHealthCentral.com - Oct 18, 2004Warning on internet health advice\n\nOnlypunjab.com, India - Oct 18, 2004Too much information bad for your health, study shows\n\nE-Health Insider, UK - Oct 18, 2004Click To Get Sick?\n\nTIME - Oct 25, 2004Study: Internet Medical Advice Could Have Unintended Consequences\n\nihealthbeat, USA - Oct 18, 2004Internet makes us sick\n\nThe Times, UK - Oct 22, 2004Knowledge May be Hazardous to Web Consumers' Health\n\nNewswise (press release) - Oct 17, 2004Warning on internet health advice\n\nBBC News, UK - Oct 17, 2004Patient, don't try to heal thyself\n\nDMeurope.com, Netherlands - Oct 19, 2004Beware of Internet health advises\n\nPravda, Russia - Oct 18, 2004Web Not Always Safe Health Source for Some\n\nForbes - Oct 21, 2004Warning over bad health advice online\n\nMedical News Today, UK - Oct 18, 2004Logging on can make you sicker\n\nABC Science Online, Australia - Oct 19, 2004Fears over health 'cures' on the web\n\nThe Scotsman, UK - Oct 18, 2004Too much Internet advice is bad for your health: study\n\nCanada.com, Canada - Oct 18, 2004\n\nFew reporters seemed to have read the review, which actually did not speak about health websites or \"the Internet\" (as suggested in the press release and subsequent media reports) but of \"Interactive Health Communication Applications (IHCAs).\" According to the Cochrane review, the defining feature of an IHCA is \"that it does not simply provide health information, but combines such information with at least one (and frequently more than one) additional service [such as] decision support, behaviour change support or peer support\" [1], which excludes information-only websites. Ignoring this, the press release spoke of the \"Internet\" and contained statements like \"knowledge-seekers become so steeped in information from the Internet they make treatment choices on their own, contradicting advice from their doctors.\" Many news outlets reprinted the press release verbatim, which also stated that \"people who use their computers to find health information often wind up in worse condition than if they had listened to their doctor,\" or rephrased this into \"Some people with chronic health problems who seek online advice would be better off just listening to their doctors.\" Some journalists even condensed this to \"Patient, don't try to heal thyself.\" Statements like this—emphasizing that people should better listen to their doctor rather than going on the Web—made consumers, patients, self-care advocates, and eHealth experts wince, not only because they seemed factually questionable, but also because they were reminiscent of a dark pre-Internet era of paternalism and \"doctor knows it all\" mindsets, which many thought were long behind us [2-6].\n\nMost eHealth researchers are driven by the belief that the Web and other interactive media applications play a major role in supporting patients with chronic conditions. At the same time, we are all for being on the cautious side, viewing eHealth applications with a critical eye, knowing that some people will not benefit from them, stressing that badly designed applications can harm patients, and monitoring unintended side effects and potentially negative outcomes [7]. Still, many eHealth researchers were surprised and angered by the sweeping and blatant comments stemming from this review, which seemed to ignore the growing literature on the effectiveness of many eHealth interventions, some of which have been published in this journal. Most researchers familiar with the literature know that the vast majority of such reports are actually positive—in fact, the proportion of positive studies is so overwhelming that it has been questioned whether negative studies are underreported [8].\n\nThe series of unfortunate events culminated when the scientific eHealth community debunked the Cochrane review as a \"methodological disaster\" [9]. Among several other flaws (outlined below), the review included severe extraction (or coding and data interpretation) errors leading to a complete reversal of the outcomes. Positive outcomes in the primary studies (such as reduction in encopresis [10]) were misinterpreted as negative (harmful) effects. As Per Egil Kummervold and colleagues listed in the feedback section of the Cochrane Library on October 28, 2004, at least 8 of 11 outcomes were reversed—letting the effect estimator appear on the left side (\"favours control\") instead on the right side (\"favours intervention\"). See , which shows the flawed figure from the Cochrane review, and Multimedia Appendix 2, which shows corrections made by Kummervold et al.\n\nThese were stunning errors because anyone who read these primary reports could not possibly have come to the conclusion that any of these studies reported less favourable health outcomes in the IHCA groups. To date, it remains a mystery how respected and experienced investigators could arrive at these conclusions (unless investigators relied on research assistants or students to extract the data and did not bother to read the studies themselves, which is an unimaginable scenario for a Cochrane review). These errors were obviously magnified by aggressive marketing efforts of the investigators and publisher, who sent out three press releases that did not in any way caution readers about the results.\n\nWhen the review was eventually retracted by the authors on October 29, 2004—only 13 days after the press release—the public hardly took notice. As illustrated in an article by Roy Rada in this issue of JMIR [11], the media remained quiet, too quiet. To date, many publications have not published any follow-up stories, and the impact will be long-lasting. As the Rada paper shows, the Web is still full of reports on the flawed Cochrane review, and Rada identified only one newspaper story about the retraction—the Canadian journalist said he found this out only by chance. (We are also aware of a report by Frith Rayner, published in the Australian Doctor, courtesy of Lee Ritterband.) The failure of the media to report the retraction has to do with either the fact that they simply did not know about it or with issues around how the media decides what will be newsworthy (\"if it bleeds, it leads,\" \"bad news are good news\"). Another reason why it was not taken up could be that the press release reporting the retraction was not very clear in highlighting the magnitude of the error, and it contained little more than the message that the review was being reworked and that it was too early to say what the result would be. Few journalists would have understood that the errors invalidated the results completely, even reversed them.\n\nRada analyzes the impact of the review and draws a few lessons, some of which shall be complemented by this editorial, not least because the authors of this editorial were involved in the events that eventually led to a retraction.\n\nThe Emperor Without Clothes\n\nIn a curious way, the media attention this review received—as detrimental as it was in sending out a false message to the public—also had a positive side in that it probably also sped up the identification of the errors. Without the media frenzy the results would possibly have remained unnoticed for a while, but with the worldwide media attention, peers quickly heard about the review.\n\nFor example, the editor of this journal (Gunther Eysenbach) was contacted by a journalist when the press release came out, was among the first who looked closely at the original review on October 16, and was one of the first who blew the whistle, pointing out that this emperor did not have clothes. Having read many of the primary studies that were pooled in the review, having done several systematic reviews in this area, and knowing the results of another review which JMIR published around the same time [12], he told the journalist who contacted him that the study seemed flawed. On October 25, he also posted a message on the Medical Webmasters Mailing List (MWM-L), where some researchers had started to discuss the study, warning readers not to take the review at face value [9].\n\nAround the same time, on October 24, another researcher, Lee Ritterband—whose research was cited in the review and who had not seen a pre-print of it prior to publication—was alarmed by media reports and commented in a mailing list for Internet health intervention researchers: \"While it is possible that some people may be worse off, we know that our interventions are quite effective, and this kind of fear-inducing 'findings' are the types of comments which our research, in part, must debunk.\" (Ritterband, personal communication, June 15, 2005). On the other side of the Atlantic, Per Egil Kummervold and colleagues at the Norwegian Centre for Telemedicine had also noticed that the numbers did not add up. They started a thorough investigation, reviewing the original data material, and on October 28 they notified the Cochrane Collaboration that the authors had made almost inconceivable mistakes, including reverting the direction of the results. On October 29, 2004, the review was retracted.\n\nThe Three Principal Flaws\n\nData Extraction and Coding Errors\n\nThe most devastating (and most obvious) error was the previously discussed blatant mistake of misinterpreting positive outcomes as negative outcomes (and vice versa). Kummervold's original list of errors is documented in Multimedia Appendix 2.\n\nPooling Heterogeneous Studies\n\nThe second concern is that the studies were too heterogeneous to sensibly attempt a formal random effects meta-analysis using Cochrane's RevMan software. The resulting effect estimates are meaningless. The review guidelines of the Consumers and Communication Group state the following: \"They [systematic reviewers] should also use caution when extracting and interpreting data, and when deciding whether to combine them statistically. Combining disparate data quantitatively may not always be appropriate, and qualitative synthesis may often be preferable\" [13].\n\nThis is particularly true for pooling health outcomes, but equally problematic is to pool knowledge scores and behaviour change and social support measures from studies with interventions that had very little in common except that they were delivered electronically. Comparing different IHCAs against controls and pooling these results without paying any attention to the \"ingredients\" is like comparing all studies in which investigators used \"blue pills\" in the intervention arm—a pooling on the basis of the delivery mechanism rather than the \"ingredient\" is of limited value. And for every successfully IHCA-delivered intervention, one can probably find a similar intervention which is delivered on a badly designed IHCA, which does not mean that IHCAs per se are inappropriate delivery mechanisms.\n\nA richer, deeper qualitative analysis to answer questions like \"what seem to be the success factors in terms of how the intervention and the trial should be designed\" would have been more appropriate and more informative. Qualitative synthesis prevents us from drowning in a river that on average is only 3 feet deep.\n\nAs an aside, while the authors focused on extracting outcome measures which could support their postulated pathway of action, it would have been very informative to extract and report attrition rates as secondary outcomes (ie, the percentage of users who dropped out and/or did not use the application), not only because nonuse of the application may explain a lack of an effect, but also because such data from numerous studies could be useful in identifying some of the factors (predictors) for nonuse/dropout as postulated in the \"Law of Attrition\" [14]. In health informatics, issues around adoption are at least as important as health outcomes [15], and systematic reviews in this area should try to extract and synthesize adoption measures.\n\nScope and Lack of Comprehensiveness\n\nThe third problem with the IHCA Cochrane review, which has not yet been discussed on the Cochrane feedback section, is the scope of the review and the lack of truly comprehensive searches within the scope the authors defined. The scope may be too broad in some respect (making the review unmanageable and confusing by lumping together too many different applications), and too narrow in others (eg, by excluding pure patient-doctor or peer-to-peer communication, or by focusing on chronic diseases).\n\nIn particular, the authors decided to exclude electronic decision aids and computer/Internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) programs. High-quality CBT applications, such as ODIN (Overcoming Depression on the InterNet), were not cited in the review [16]. This creates a considerable bias, as CBT applications are among the most successful interventions. These important exclusions were neither mentioned in the press release nor in any media reports.\n\nThere is also some confusion about the scope of the review, in particular, whether applications that provide social support by enabling peer-to-peer communication were included. The original definition of the Science Panel on Interactive Communication and Health [17] of the term \"IHC application\" is as follows:\n\n[IHCAs are] the operational software programs or modules that interface with the end user. This includes health information and support Websites and clinical decision-support and risk assessment software (which may or may not be online), but does not include applications that focus exclusively on administrative, financial, or clinical data, such as electronic medical records, dedicated clinical telemedicine applications, or expert clinical decision-support systems for providers.\n\nHowever, the Cochrane review team narrowed this definition by only including studies on applications that, apart from delivering health information, had another component (eg, decision support, peer-to-peer support), thereby excluding simple information-only websites. The fact that simple health information sites were not in the scope of the review was not communicated properly in the press release and was widely misunderstood by the media. Journalists reported, for example, that \"the study found no evidence that Web health information [sic] helps people with chronic diseases\" (HealthDayNews) or that \"people who use their computer to find out more about their condition end up in worse health than those who do not\" (The Times). While the Cochrane investigators may have had good reasons to exclude simple health information websites, there was a remarkable divergence between what the public understood the review was about and the actual inclusion criteria. Leaving aside all other flaws, such as coding errors, it appears problematic to issue press releases that suggest that the Internet is harmful when the actual review excluded things like websites, Internet-based CBT programs, and possibly even peer-to-peer support groups.\n\nOn the latter point, the definition of IHCA used by the Cochrane review team leaves considerable ambiguity about whether or not \"pure\" peer-to-peer groups are in the scope of the review—and ambiguities at the protocol stage are often a recipe for disaster [18]. One may argue that peer-to-peer support on the Internet is always embedded in a wealth of health information on the Web and would therefore meet the definition and fall within the scope of this review.\n\nA final concern is that a comparison with another systematic review [19] suggests that the searches were less than comprehensive or that the reference screening process was sloppy. In a systematic review on applications with peer-to-peer components [19] (which was not cited in the Cochrane review), 20 randomized controlled trials of IHCAs (all of which had peer-to-peer components) were identified. Of these, only 6 studies were included in the Cochrane review, 3 were excluded, but more than half (as many as 11 studies [20-29]) were not cited or mentioned in the Cochrane review, although many of them appear relevant or should at least have been explicitly excluded (see Multimedia Appendix 3). While it is admittedly difficult (or impossible) to find all relevant papers in this area, the fact that more than half of the studies from a previously published systematic review were not cited is disturbing."
