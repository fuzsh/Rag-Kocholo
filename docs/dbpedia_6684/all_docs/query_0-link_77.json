That makes him no different from millions of other people who have spent their Januaries attempting to shed extra weight.\n\nBut in the networked reality of 2012, Rob Ford and many others like him are doing something different: They’re posting the results of their diets online, on their Twitter feeds and their Facebook statuses, and in Mayor Ford’s case, on a website,\n\ncutthewaist.ca.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS\n\nEnjoy the latest local, national and international news.\n\nExclusive articles by Conrad Black, Barbara Kay and others.

Nason is particularly intrigued by the potential for devices that post a person’s health information on social networking sites. For example, take the products sold by a French company called Withings. There’s the WiFi Body Scale, which posts the results of the day’s weigh-in on Twitter, and a blood pressure monitor able to send results directly to a doctor, or to an online score chart.\n\nArticle content\n\n[np-related]\n\nPerform a Twitter search for “Withings” and one finds all sorts of weight- and health-related tweets. “My weight: 195.9 lb. 7.3 lb to go,” tweeted Rudy Jahchan, or “@rudy,” a Los Angeles-based programmer. Meanwhile, Colin McNamara, a computer network designer from San Francisco, also posts his blood pressure and heart rate online; recently it was 135 over 85, and a remarkable 47 beats per minute. His tweets show that he’s holding steady around 218 pounds.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWithings isn’t the only company marketing devices that tweet or otherwise post your health information to social media websites. There’s the iHealth Digital Scale, and Polar, the Finnish heart-rate monitor company. Even those who don’t have Twitter-enabled scales are manually posting online such health information as pounds lost.\n\nOne possible question posed by the less-wired among us is, “Why do this? Why bother status-updating your weight?” One answer: It seems to work in terms of motivation. Publicly informing others of the pounds you’ve lost is a public commitment to further weight loss. There’s also simultaneously more “supportive” accountability: Other Twitter or Facebook users ask how the diet and exercise regimen is going, which makes it harder to give up. How much harder?\n\nWell, research on all this is pretty thin so far, but one of the leading publications to study technology’s impact on health is the Journal of Medical Internet Research, founded by University of Toronto MD and professor Gunther Eysenbach. Many of the studies published by Eysenbach suggest that even the most insubstantial forms of electronic encouragement can benefit a weight-loss program.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nOne study published in the most recent edition of Eysenbach’s journal looked at the effects of “virtual coaches,” or animated programs that feature a cartoon offering words of encouragement to people in an exercise program. Even though the cartoon wasn’t human, its encouragement helped — the people who interacted with the cartoon coach stuck with their exercise regimen a lot more than people who received no encouragement at all.\n\nWeight-based tweets are likely to summon support from peers — even if it’s just a “good going” from @johnfromdetroit, who you’ve never met, and are not likely to ever to meet. And the more peer support, the better. That, at least, is the implication of a paper published last fall by a team of researchers led by Xiaoxiao Ma from the University of Massachusetts.\n\nMa and his fellow academics studied FatSecret, an online social network that allows users to record their food intake, weight and exercise regimens in addition to journal postings and diet tips. The researchers tracked 107,000 FatSecret users for about five months. Ma and his team found that the more friends a subject had, the more weight that subject tended to lose. The most fascinating finding? “The strength of such online influence … appears to be greater than those in the real-world network,” Ma wrote.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nCan social media become the healthy behaviour-modification tool for our generation? I do have some misgivings about publicly posting health information. It presents ethical dilemmas despite the possibilities inherent in its openness and likelihood of online support. Still, the medical profession needs to do better than “top down” lecturing on healthy lifestyle choices if we want to control ballooning health care costs associated with obesity and related medical conditions. Could social networking websites present a trigger that inspires us all to live healthier lifestyles?\n\nThat brings us back to Rob Ford, who should be applauded for publicly committing himself to a weight-loss program. At his most recent weigh-in, he’d lost 20 pounds. Good for him. He, and the people like him who update us on their diet progress on Twitter and Facebook, are not only holding themselves accountable in a new and effective manner: They’re also setting an example for the rest of us. Healthy individuals lead to a healthy population — one pound at a time.\n\n–Dr. James Aw is the medical director of the Medcan Clinic, a leading private health clinic in Toronto.
