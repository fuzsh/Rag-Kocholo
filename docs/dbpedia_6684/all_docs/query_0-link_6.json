Great marketing play by Springer Nature, but these self-serving “rankings” - counting mainly research in certain prestige journals (mostly Nature and Lancet) - are harmful for science and lead to unsustainable publishing costs. FYI, U of T also ranks highly in JMIR Publications journals, which publishes at a fraction of these costs, but what these rankings do is to make university administrators encourage their faculty to publish in certain journals (covering their APCs in transformative agreements) while bleeding out innovative publishing platforms and open access pioneers with no library budget left to support these."
