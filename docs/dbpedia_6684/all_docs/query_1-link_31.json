        "text": "Gunther Eysenbach, MD, MPH, FACMI, has a life-long passion for information and communication technologies, knowledge translation and medical information, and has been recognized as the most impactful medical informatician in the world. He studied medicine, computer science, and public health, and, already as a medical student, wrote books and worked for a major scholarly publisher as an Editor. He is a visionary who recognized the importance of the internet for both medical information dissemination as well scholarly publishers in the 90s, became a pioneer of the gold Open-Access movement, created one of the first open-access journals, co-founded the OASPA (Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association), and built a respected global publishing firm known for its quality and forward-thinking innovations (one of Canada’s Fastest Growing Companies). He is also the co-inventor of TrendMD, a company he co-founded as Chief Science Officer, which is another avenue to disseminate scientific information in a targeted manner. Gunther spends most of his time as President of JMIR Publications, but also invests in innovative startups in medicine and science as an angel investor, holds the position of Adjunct Professor at the University of Victoria, and is working on his charitable organization to help authors from developing countries publish their work.\n\nWhen he is not surfing the Internet he can be found kitesurfing, snowkiting or SUPing.\n\nI believe in helping people in my daily work: creating systems and improving processes that enable teams to deliver amazing products in the most efficient and engaging way possible. I teach, coach, and mentor in order to maximize the value we provide to our users. I’m also a firm believer that a shared purpose is the strongest motivator for any team. JMIR provides me with the opportunity to help those who believe in the shared purpose of disseminating knowledge in an accessible manner.\n\nI like talking about music, video games, agility, and coaching. More than anything else however, I love interesting data and most likely will enjoy talking it over with you.\n\nGrowing up in an entrepreneurial family, my passion is providing Human Resources leadership to entrepreneurial, growing organizations through my company The Red Office. Previously, I was the Chief Human Resources Officer for a private equity owed firm with North American operations and held several other senior HR roles, including the head of Corporate HR for Canadian Tire when they were voted the #1 employer in Canada.\n\nAs an Environmentalist, I am the past Chairman of the Board of an environmental not-for-profit organization. I also have a love of Golden Retrievers and recent IronMan 70.3\n\n'Leave it better than you found it'\n\nOver the course of my career as a general internist and telemedicine physician, I have always been keenly aware of how valuable clear communication is in patient care, research and scholarly pursuits, digital health transformations, and well beyond. I am excited to work at the intersections of patient and population health advancement, clinical informatics, and scientific advancement through high-quality publishing. I also enjoy working in a creative and innovative space, where every day offers an opportunity to learn something new and do so alongside a talented and forward-thinking team. Enabling each individual to bring authenticity of self-expression to diverse, equitable, inclusive, and collaborative environments will move all of our scientific communities forward together with the common goal of improving human health and well-being.\n\nI enjoy naps (but do not get to do them enough!), traveling, finding and trying new baking recipes, and spending time with my bunnies.\n\nThe future of publishing is in the hands of innovators. Forging new, sustainable ways of publishing while ensuring the integrity and accessibility of meaningful content has been the focus of my career to date, and I am excited to be a part of JMIR’s innovative ethos with a view to increasing our impact while better serving the needs of the scientific community and the public at large.\n\nI value honesty, dedication, kindness, creativity, and good coffee.\n\nI'm thrilled about joining JMIR(!); there are several reasons why: (1) JMIR's mission to revolutionize health research through technology, marketing those innovative solutions that have a direct impact on improving health care; (2) the organization’s commitment to open access research—I believe in the power of accessibility to propel scientific progress, and I am eager to contribute to that vision through strategic marketing initiatives; and (3) JMIR's reputation as a top eHealth publisher and the chance to lead marketing efforts that make a lasting impact.\n\nWhen not in the office, you will likely find me working in the yard or on the house, playing with our two terriers—Finley and Fergus, or practicing the bagpipe (I am the pipe major of a local band).\n\n“The only thing that is more expensive than education is ignorance.” Benjamin Franklin\n\nHaving worked as neuroscientist and physician in several leadership positions in academia and industry, both in Europe and North America, I recognize how important knowledge transfer is. I am absolutely passionate about it. Fast and easy access to science, particularly in the medical and research fields, is of paramount significance for experts as well as for patients. Informed decision-making is the way to go. I am thrilled to be part of the JMIR team. JMIR has pioneered high quality open access publications. JMIR thrives on innovation and its strong vision for revolutionizing digital and open knowledge dissemination. There is no better place for me to contribute.\n\nTravelling the world, meeting other cultures, learning from others, are all big for me. I am a proud author of a children’s book.\n\nFrom a friends and family standpoint, my career path that started in small town Mississippi, and then took me through into an internal medicine residency at Georgetown, through a nephrology fellowship at the Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) combined program, and then into the entrepreneurial birthing of digital health, is surprising, to be frank. In 2019, I sold and integrated MedTech Boston, where I was Founder and Editor-in-Chief, dedicated to bringing the digital health community together. I am an MD actively practicing emergency room, urgent care, and hospitalist physician at 3 Boston hospitals, also overseeing medical student, resident, and fellow training from the local academic institutions, including Tufts, Harvard, MIT, MGH, BWH, and Boston University.\n\nI am passionate about the power of clear and inspirational communication and storytelling to educate, inspire, and empower patients, scientists, and clinicians, irrespective of education, socioeconomic status, race, gender, or geographical location. I also respect and admire what Gunther is doing with JMIR and highlight and elevating digital health to drive meaningful innovation in healthcare.\n\nI don't own a car, and I love cupcakes.\n\nThrough my background as a dietitian and nutrition epidemiologist working across clinical, community, academic, and nonprofit settings, I have developed a passion for Knowledge Translation (KT). I believe that the publication and dissemination of scholarly research is an integral part of KT efforts to successfully empower individuals and populations to improve their health and well-being. JMIR Publications is an innovator and leader in the scholarly publishing space, and it is an honour to be a part of this team. I love my role as a Scientific Editor and the opportunity to work collaboratively with authors, editors, reviewers, and readers to produce excellent and impactful papers.\n\nMy heart is happiest when I hike in the mountains, watch the sunset on the beach, share a delicious meal with family and friends, and dance to my favorite music.\n\nAs a PhD graduate and having worked in academia as a post-doctoral fellow, I greatly value open scientific communication. As an open-access journal, JMIR publishes research from around the world. By being part of the JMIR team, I have the opportunity to allow communication of exciting new research that will help our scientific community grow.\n\n\"It is the weight, not numbers of experiments that is to be regarded.\" Sir Isaac Newton\n\nHaving worked in the long-term care sector for over a decade, I have seen, first hand, the benefits that access to evidence-based research have on both patients and their health care providers. I hope to play a part in providing all members of the population with continuous access to the latest-quality medical research.\n\nWhen family or friends go traveling, I ask them to bring me back a collection of folk tales. I now have 32 books of folk tales from 10 countries, but I always leave room on my bookshelf for one more.\n\nI have always wanted to work toward ensuring an equitable distribution of health care resources across the globe. To champion this cause, knowledge is one of the greatest tools that I can help disseminate to the world right now, especially in the aftermath of a global pandemic. I hope to use my background in academia and publishing to support JMIR's efforts in making digital health research open, shareable, and easily accessible.\n\nOutside of work, I'm a foodie who loves to cook, read, travel and dance. I am an excellent gift-finder and gift-giver, and my guilty pleasure is collecting pop-culture merchandise that I have absolutely no use for.\n\nJoining JMIR Publications is a thrilling prospect for me, as it lends my passion for innovative health care research with my extensive background in psychology, kinesiology, and neurosciences. Having spent over a decade in academia, I have come to firmly believe in the transformative power of open science for the future of scientific publishing. I am eager to contribute to an organization that is at the forefront of digital health research.\n\nI am a huge sports enthusiast, regularly engaging in basketball, badminton, and tennis. I love outdoor activities. When summer hits, you will find me camping almost every weekend, soaking up the sun and nature. I am also a fan of classical music. I play the violin and a few traditional Chinese instruments like the bamboo flute and the bawu.\n\nExperimental data are of no use if they cannot be reported in a coherent manner or be accessible to those carrying out studies in similar research areas. Working with JMIR allows me to help disseminate high-impact data on health technology by virtue of the open-access policy of its journals and the stimulating work environment it offers. Furthermore, being a part of the Production Team at JMIR exposes me to the breadth of studies that are currently underway in the medical sciences and in health care.\n\n‘Busy’ is a blessing; in my spare time, I like keeping myself occupied with some reading material, an online course, or a (very!) long walk. To my mind, there is no such thing as ‘too much dark chocolate’!\n\nThrough my experiences in the fields of translation, interpretation, editing, and teaching languages, I have come to see the value of making communication and knowledge transfer and sharing possible. I would love to be a part of JMIR's rewarding mission and have a role in making health research accessible to the academic and nonacademic public for the well-being of the whole world.\n\nMy academic background is in English and comparative literature. I love long hikes, photography, yoga, and everything in the world of wines.\n\nComing from an academic background, I've personally experienced the barriers that are sometimes involved in collecting quality, reputable sources. JMIR continues to move the needle with respect to open access scholarship, and I want to contribute to this movement that helps make STM information more accessible to the wider public.\n\n\"I can see the sun, but even if I cannot see the sun, I know that it exists. And to know that the sun is there - that is living.\" - Fyodor Dostoevsky\n\nWorking for an organization that has a positive impact on society is rewarding, particularly in such a challenging period to the global community.\n\nWhen I was 24 years old, I backpacked through Europe by myself for a month. I have countless memories of this period, but the most memorable one was seeing the snow for the first time in my life in a small Italian town called Subiaco.\n\nOne of humanity's greatest strengths is our ability to collaborate and share new information on a global scale, and I am passionate about doing my part to contribute. JMIR's mission of providing fact-based resources in an open-source format empowers anyone with an internet connection to seek out accurate information on sensitive topics, and I am honoured to lend my skills to this goal.\n\nI also enjoy peppermint tea, sea shanties, and fruitlessly trying to get to the end of my list of Films to Watch.\n\nOpen access to scientific research is key to advancing and reforming the way that science is reported and how scientists talk to each other and to the public, but there are still competing approaches to open access as a publishing model. JMIR’s approach shows the way forward, and I am proud to be a part of that.\n\nMy favorite bad habit is always starting new hobbies. Recently, these have included antique camera–based photography and kitchen projects centered around fermentation.\n\nJMIR's mission to connect vetted, quality research outputs in novel, effective, and timely ways with those who need it is more important than ever in the post–COVID-19 world. I am excited to join the team to help achieve the vision of providing open access to scientific and medical knowledge to the public so that everyone can make effective, informed decisions, take control of their health and well-being and live happier and healthier lives.\n\nWhen I am not spending time with my daughters, I enjoy watching movies and TV shows and playing on my Switch. I am also a big basketball fan, so I watch a lot of NBA games and can talk about basketball all day.\n\nAt JMIR, I am enthusiastic about working with a technology-focused organization and working with a team dedicated to supporting and disseminating health research.\n\nGrowing up in New Zealand, I have had my fair share of wildlife encounters, especially while surfing. On a recent visit, I was chased out of the water by a sea lion. Let us just say, the sea lion took our spot on the beach that day.\n\nI see this opportunity as a way to contribute to an exciting, fast-moving company whose vision to empower people toward happier, healthier life definitely caught my attention. I believe that my skills and knowledge are well suited for my role, along with great scope of learning.\n\nWhile doing my masters, I assumed writing assignments and doing projects would be the toughest part. Who knew choreographing for a group of 10 adults for a college event was even tougher? Our rehearsals would begin post midnight after submission of assignments, accompanied by several cups of coffee. Phew! we did it; we graduated and have fun memories forever.\n\nI find JMIR's work culture to be dynamic, progressive, and capable of offering a chance to flourish. I applied because I want to learn and grow within a vibrant team, and I believe that JMIR and I would be a perfect match.\n\nThe challenges of production are enormous, with the need to struggle with the environment to implement the ideas and develop products that meet the needs of clients, pushing frustration to the brittle point. My passion is to help provide an enabling environment to implement and bring these ideas to reality as well as assist our clients to get the best out of our elegant products. JMIR’s vision was obvious in my research. The organization’s innovative ideas in medical research, information, and delivery intrigue me. The opportunity to join the team and contribute to this innovation is an exciting opportunity for me.\n\nJMIR is a leading organization with wonderful employees. I experienced during the interview sessions that the people are super friendly. Looking forward to working and learning with them.\n\nI am a dreamer. I remember when I was a kid, I used to change my career aim depending on the recent movie I just watched. Of all the options, at the age of 15 years, I decided I wanted to be in the IT industry. In 11th class, I had a choice between Hindi and Computer Science. I chose Computer Science because it was a new subject, and I was studying Hindi since the age of 3 years. The computer lab was very fascinating. C++ was my first computing language. It was magical to see the inputs of my choice printed on the computer screen. From that day to today, I have come very far, and I know this is just the beginning.\n\n\"Coming from a Finance and Accounting background having over 18 years of professional experience within small and multinational leading industries, I am excited to be responsible for the accounting, financial planning and analysis, treasury, and tax functions at JMIR. Prior to this role, I have built and lead finance teams in global companies with significant operating scale and complexity, have advised on more than 68 investments, mergers, acquisitions, specializes in delivering strategic advice, comprehensive due diligence, buy- and sell-side advisory services, and deal-structuring advice which can be put in use while contributing to JMIR exponential growth, mission and vision in an efficient and professional way.\n\nAs a member of the Institute of Management Accountant, have a bachelor’s degree in Accounting, Certificate in Management Accounting, Financial Analysis and Investment Management from the University of Toronto, I keep relish working on my education and professional development skills.\"\n\nAccountability, it is not only what we do, but also what we do not do, for which we are accountable. (Moliere)\n\nI have been working in the field of Human Resources for 8+ years, and I could not have chosen a more suitable career for myself. I strongly stand by the statement “leaving people better than I found them,” by implementing HR initiatives that benefit not only the employees but also the organization on all levels.\n\nI am so excited to have teamed up with the JMIR Publications family and be able to do what I love most. Big things are coming!\n\nWith a heavy background in art, operations, and DEI, my focus has perpetually centered around the dissemination of knowledge. This allows us to reflect and look at the world in a different way to create change and better society. I strongly believe that knowledge serves as a catalyst for shaping a more progressive society and is a driving force to working at JMIR. Through my role at a health-focused publication committed to sharing vital health insights, I shall help foster a platform where information empowers individuals to introspect, make well-informed choices, and generate innovative ideas for a better tomorrow.\n\nIn a nutshell, I am an organizational, administrative nerd who thrives on creativity and education. I want to take these four passions and apply them at JMIR, to create a wonderful, happy work environment and space that is efficient to facilitate growth. I hope to make everyone's life a little easier."
