        "text": "Welcome to the SPARC Open Access Newsletter, issue #158\n\nJune 2, 2011\n\nby Peter Suber\n\nRead this issue online\n\nhttp://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/06-02-11.htm\n\nContents\n\nSeeking custody\n\nUpdate\n\nFive years ago in SOAN\n\nTen years ago in SOAN\n\nRoundup\n\nComing this month\n\nHousekeeping\n\nCredits\n\n----------\n\nSOAN is published and sponsored by the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC).\n\nhttp://www.arl.org/sparc/\n\n----------\n\nSeeking custody\n\nIf we want to make a digital file OA, and we already have an OA repository, then we face just two hurdles. We need a copy of the file and we need permission. We can call these the custody and copyright conditions. \"Custody\" here doesn't mean ownership of the rights, just possession of a copy. If we have possession and permission, then we don't need ownership.\n\nThe OA movement has given far more attention to the copyright or permission problem than to the custody or possession problem. This may have the effect of sweeping a difficult problem under the rug. We often have permission when we lack custody, and often find that solving the permission problem is easier than solving the custody problem. Here are some examples of what could be called permission success and custody failure.\n\n(1) You've published an article in a TA journal which allows green OA or self-archiving. But the journal only allows deposit of the final version of the author's peer-reviewed manuscript, not the published version. You're fine with that and eager to make the manuscript OA. But you can't put your hands on the version you're allowed to deposit. You think it's on your hard drive somewhere, or in your email archive. But you're not sure. You haven't had time to look, or you've looked and found six versions. You don't have time to figure out which one, if any, is the deposit-eligible, peer-reviewed manuscript, or you've taken the time and you're still unsure. Or you have the version you submitted to the journal, and all the correspondence with the editor, but you don't have time to reconstruct the version approved by peer review. Or you might have deleted the relevant version in a fit of spring cleaning, as a superseded version not worth saving, or you might have failed to copy it over from your last computer when you upgraded. With enough detective work you could find out, but you don't know how much time it would take and you're pretty sure it would take more than you have.\n\nOnce this problem arises, there are no solutions except to do the necessary detective work. The best solution is prevention. Authors aiming at green OA should understand that permission for deposit is often limited to the final version of their peer-reviewed manuscript. Institutions aiming at green OA should help authors understand this. The message is: you can simplify your life and foster OA at the same time by depositing your peer-reviewed manuscripts as soon as they're accepted for publication. That gets the manuscripts out of your hair and into the repository before they're lost, deleted, forgotten, modified, or superseded. You may need version control, bookkeeping, and detective work for other jobs, but not for this job.\n\n(2) You've been funded by the Wellcome Trust, NIH, or one of the other funders requiring grantees to retain the right to authorize OA. Or you're employed by Harvard, MIT, or one of the universities where faculty grant the institution standing permission to make their future articles OA. In the former case, you're happy to fulfill your funding agreement. In the latter case, you have a right to opt out but you're happy with the OA default. So far, so good. That solves the permission problem. But these OA policies also require deposit at the time of acceptance, which should solve the possession or custody problem. Now it's time to deliver. If you can't put your hands on the version you're allowed to deposit, then this reduces to case #1. But perhaps you have a good idea where the file can be found. You plan to deposit it \"real soon now\". However, you're preoccupied with a new article, and don't want to slow down new work to tie up loose ends on old work. In case #1, you want to find the relevant version but can't. In case #2, your funder or employer wants you to find the relevant version, and you're hoping it will leave you alone, if only for a couple of weeks while you clear your desk of urgent business. Or a couple of months. Come to think of it, you can't remember a time when your desk was cleared of urgent business.\n\nMany universities solve this problem by paying librarians or student workers to make deposits on behalf of faculty. When libraries can afford this, I recommend it. I've long argued that successful OA mandates are implemented through expectations, education, incentives, and assistance, not coercion. Proxy deposit is the critical kind of assistance.\n\nPerhaps proxy deposit shouldn't be necessary. But if it solves the custody problem, when lack of assistance leaves it unsolved, then the benefits are significant and the only question is about cost. My experience is that trained student workers can do this job well, and we can save librarians to do what non-librarians can't.\n\nhttp://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/10-02-10.htm#self-archiving\n\nNote that assistance helps more with #2 problems than #1 problems. If you can't find the relevant file, then you won't be able to pass it your student assistant. Hence, even with assistance we'll still need to educate authors about depositing peer-reviewed manuscripts, or passing them to assistants, as soon as they're accepted for publication.\n\nTo solve #1 and #2 problems, many funders with green OA mandates work with publishers to deposit articles on behalf of authors. When the NIH started doing this in 2006, I had mixed feelings. It ensured deposit, but it let publishers choose the length of the embargo period when that was supposed to be the author's decision.\n\nhttp://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2006/09/nih-strikes-agreement-with-publishers.html\n\nBut now my feelings are less mixed. I support the idea. The custody problem is serious. It's probably the major obstacle to faster growth in the compliance rates for OA mandates. It's a problem worth solving, and publisher deposit is one solution. (In any case, if authors made their own deposits and decided the length of the embargo, publishers could use other means at their disposal to pressure them to choose the maximum permissible period.)\n\nThe next frontier is for publishers to deposit into institutional repositories, not just funder repositories like PubMed Central. BioMed Central is one publisher aready doing this. The service is free of charge for many institutions (members of BMC and those using the enhanced version of BMC's Open Repository service), but not for all.\n\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/info/libraries/sword\n\nBack in 2008, Nature said it might be willing to deposit into institutional repositories as well.\n\nhttp://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2008/07/nature-will-deposit-into-disciplinary.html\n\nLast month I asked NPG whether it had started IR deposits, and received this reply from Grace Baynes, head of Corporate Public Relations for NPG (quoted with permission): \"Depositing in institutional repositories in an efficient way proved more challenging than NPG anticipated at first. Through our experiences of the PEER project we learnt that in many cases we would need an intermediary to pass files and metadata to repositories. We are now in active discussions about a pilot project to deposit into institutional repositories, and hope to be able to announce more detail soon.\"\n\nI look forward to the results of NPG's pilot project. It could boost the volume of green OA in institutional repositories as well as the OA-archiving culture at those institutions. And of course it could lead other publishers to follow suit.\n\nApproaching the custody problem in new ways, developers have created a range of tools to automate or semi-automate repository deposits. For example:\n\nJISC's RePosit Project uses the Symplectic publications management system as a repository deposit interface.\n\nhttp://jiscreposit.blogspot.com/\n\nhttp://jiscreposit.blogspot.com/2010/07/introducing-reposit.html\n\nBibApp will discover new publications eligible for deposit in an institutional repository and deposit them directly into the repository.\n\nhttps://arl.org/Lists/SPARC-OAForum/Message/5518.html\n\nThe same folks who brought you SWORD (Simple Web-service Offering Repository Deposit) offer an accompanying EasyDeposit tool, and support third-party tools using SWORD to facilitate deposit.\n\nhttp://bit.ly/c6BKRC\n\nhttp://blog.stuartlewis.com/2010/05/29/deposit-to-multiple-repositories/\n\nhttps://arl.org/Lists/SPARC-OAForum/Message/5456.html\n\nThe University of Rochester's IR-Plus repository software allows deposit directly from the tools authors may use for writing.\n\nhttp://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/03/02/repositories\n\nhttp://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2006/10/connecting-authorship-with-self.html\n\nIn Germany, the University of Bielefeld and University of Kassel are both developing tools to facilitate deposits directly from the author's personal publication list.\n\nhttp://libreas.wordpress.com/2010/03/25/projektbericht-automatische-aggregation-wissenschaftlicher-volltexte-fur-die-anreicherung-von-oa-repositorien/\n\nhttp://bibsonomy.blogspot.com/2009/08/puma-project-on-academic-publication.html\n\nI'm sure I'm overlooking some existing tools, just as I'm sure we'll see many more tools in the future.\n\nFinally, when publishers are willing, they can help institutions solve the custody problem by allowing deposit of the published edition, not just the final version of the author's peer-reviewed manuscript. This counts as a solution because authors or repository managers can usually grab a copy of the published edition more easily than any particular earlier version. But while it would solve the custody problem for green OA, and benefit authors and readers for other reasons as well, many publishers think it would harm them. So don't expect to grow soon. I say \"grow\" rather than \"arise\" or \"appear\" because many publishers already allow deposit of the published editions of their articles.\n\nSee the SHERPA list of 181 publishers (not journals) allowing green OA for the published editions of their articles with no embargo. The SHERPA list also includes one publisher allowing deposit after three months, 20 after six months, 14 after 12 months, 2 after 18 months, and 11 with longer embargo periods.\n\nhttp://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/PDFandIR.html\n\nSome publishers not only allow deposit of the published editions, but will make the deposits themselves. See the NIH list of more than than 1,100 journals (not publishers) depositing the published editions of all their articles based on NIH-funded research....\n\nhttp://publicaccess.nih.gov/submit_process_journals.htm\n\n...and the NIH list of hybrid publishers depositing the published editions of selected articles based on NIH-funded research.\n\nhttp://publicaccess.nih.gov/select_deposit_publishers.htm\n\nSome of the journals and publishers on these lists are OA and some are not. Permission from the OA publishers to allow green OA for the published edition is welcome but not surprising. But permission from the non-OA publishers is welcome and notable. If TA publishers thought this voluntary action triggered cancellations, they'd stop. How many TA publishers not on these lists realize that a natural experiment is showing that the practice is harmless? How many publishers lobbying Congress to weaken or repeal the NIH policy mention the TA publishers who voluntarily do more than NIH-funded authors ask them to do?\n\nCases #1 and #2 show how the custody problem can slow down green OA, even mandated green OA. Here are two families of examples showing how it can slow down OA for digitization projects.\n\n(3) In your library's special collections room, you find an unpublished letter from Ben Franklin to Thomas Jefferson calling for open access to publicly-funded research. (Hunch: Ben Franklin would only need an hour to understand digital text, half an hour to understand the internet, and fifteen minutes to call for OA.)\n\nThe letter is in the public domain (PD) but hasn't been digitized. You want to make it OA. This one is fairly easy. Its PD status solves the permission problem. You have custody of the analog original but not of a digital copy. All you have to do is digitize the letter and deposit the digital copy in your institutional repository.\n\nHowever, many variations on this theme are more difficult. Suppose the original letter is not in your library, but in a library across the globe. You could probably digitize it with everyone's consent and cooperation if you showed up in person with the right equipment. But you're time-strapped and cash-strapped. So is the other library.\n\nOr the original is in a private collection behind lock and key. Whether the owner is jealous or generous is a crap shoot, and you may be unlucky. The fact that the work is PD only solves the permission problem for reproduction, not the permission problem for standing in front of the original with a camera. You still need permission to pass through the locked door, and the obstacles to that may be harder to surmount than mere resistance to reproduction.\n\nOr the original is in a museum which makes money selling print copies. The museum acknowledges that the letter is PD, but is not interested in helping anyone make an OA copy that would undermine its sales. This lock-and-key problem may be created by a publicly-funded institution, not a private collector. But it's still a lock-and-key problem.\n\nOr the original is held by a government agency which is required by law to sell copies, for cost-recovery, rather than give copies away. (Mandated cost-recovery policies at public agencies are in decline as governments commit to transparency, open data, and OA. But they're still far from rare.) Or the the document is not a letter from Ben Franklin but a government report. It may sit behind a low custody barrier, like an FOI request, or a high custody barrier, like a top-secret classification.\n\nOr the original is not a single letter, but 5,000 fragile, disintegrating manuscripts. You may have custody of the analog originals, permission (because they're PD), and even the digitization equipment. But you don't have custody of digital copies of the analog originals. With time and care you could get custody of digital copies. But the mountain of demanding, time-consuming effort is a serious custody barrier. If it weren't, all PD literature, art, and music would already be OA.\n\nOr the work is in a private collection and the owner has already digitized it. But you don't have a copy of the digital file and the owner won't give you one. Or the owner has publicly released a thumbnail or low-res copy but not a high-res copy.\n\nOr the originals are already gratis OA, and you want to download them to your hard drive for text mining. When PubMed Central has permission from the copyright holders, it makes articles libre OA and allows bulk downloading. It calls this the Open Access Subset of PMC.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/\n\nBut only 10% of PMC belongs in the libre OA subset. The other 90% is gratis OA, not libre, and PMC is obliged by the rights-holders to block bulk downloading. (Thanks to PMC's Ed Sequeira for these details.)\n\nBecause BioMed Central offers libre OA to its whole corpus, it can offer its whole corpus for bulk downloading.\n\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/info/about/datamining/\n\nIn this sense, libre OA removes custody barriers that gratis OA may leave in place. The difference between gratis and libre OA isn't limited to permission barriers; permission barriers can create downstream possession and custody barriers.\n\nNote that when want to go beyond gratis OA to libre, and beyond online digital copies to bulk downloading for purposes like text mining, we've shifted from cases in which we want custody in order to provide access to cases in which we want access in order to have custody.\n\n(4) Here's a variation on the previous theme that deserves a section to itself. In May 2009 the Cornell University Library lifted restrictions on Cornell-digitized PD books. Previously it made the digital copies gratis OA and required permission for redistributing copies. When it lifted these restrictions, it issued an exemplary public statement explaining its new policy:\n\nhttp://news.library.cornell.edu/content/cornell-university-library-removes-all-restrictions-use-public-domain-reproductions\n\nhttp://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2009/05/cornell-allows-unrestricted-use-of-its.html\n\nIn a dramatic change of practice, Cornell University Library...will no longer require its users to seek permission to publish public domain items duplicated from its collections....The Library, as the producer of digital reproductions made from its collections, has in the past licensed the use of those reproductions. Individuals and corporations that failed to secure permission to repurpose these reproductions violated their agreement with the Library. \"The threat of legal action, however,\" noted Anne R. Kenney, Carl A. Kroch University Librarian, \"does little to stop bad actors while at the same time limits the good uses that can be made of digital surrogates. We decided it was more important to encourage the use of the public domain materials in our holdings than to impose roadblocks.\" ...Institutional restrictions on the use of public domain work, sometimes labeled \"copyfraud,\" have been the subject of much scholarly criticism. The Cornell initiative goes further than many other recent attempts to open access to public domain material by removing restrictions on both commercial and non-commercial use....\n\nPart of the background here is that ordinary digitization lacks the creativity needed for copyright. Hence, digitizing an analog PD work creates a digital PD work, not a digital copyrighted work. (In Europe but not the US there is a \"database right\" beyond copyright for protecting digitized collections that required substantial investment, even if the digital files are all PD.) Another part of the background is that custodians of PD works may, if they wish, take advantage of lock-and-key barriers. They needn't release their holdings at all, or they may release them on certain conditions when the conditions are based on contract, not copyright. Cornell knew that its digital copies of PD originals were themselves PD. It couldn't ground its restrictions in copyright without copyfraud (false claim of copyright) and it no longer wanted to take advantage of lock-and-key or contract barriers. On the contrary, it decided not to \"impose roadblocks\" or limit \"good uses\".\n\nSince Cornell took this step, the underlying principle has been widely endorsed:\n\n* In February 2010, the EU Culture and Education Committee unanimously supported the principle that when PD works are digitized, the digital copies should be considered PD as well.\n\nhttp://bit.ly/d9MCvZ\n\n* In May 2010, the Europeana Public Domain Charter asserted that \"[d]igitisation of Public Domain content does not create new rights over it....\"\n\nhttps://arl.org/Lists/SPARC-OAForum/Message/5483.html\n\n* In December 2010, version 1.0 of the Open Access Principles for Australian Collecting Institutions asserted that \"as a matter of open access best practice copyright should not normally be asserted over verbatim copies of public domain resources which do not have independent originality.\"\n\nhttp://openingarchives.wikidot.com/open-access-policies\n\n* In January 2011 the EU's Reflection Group or Comité des Sages concluded that \"mere digitisation process should not generate any new rights.\"\n\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/digital_libraries/doc/reflection_group/final-report-cdS3.pdf\n\nJust last month, Yale became the latest and largest university to take the Cornell step. \"The goal of the new policy is to make high quality digital images of Yale's vast cultural heritage collections in the public domain openly and freely available. As works in these collections become digitized, the museums and libraries will make those images that are in the public domain freely accessible. In a departure from established convention, no license will be required for the transmission of the images and no limitations will be imposed on their use....\"\n\nhttp://dailybulletin.yale.edu/article.aspx?id=8544\n\nTo solve the custody problem for PD works, we need the good will of the custodians, like Cornell and Yale. Only the custodians can eliminate lock-and-key restrictions through digitization and online hosting. (They can digitize and host on their own or allow others to do so.) And while no one can assert copyright restrictions on PD works, only the custodians are in a position to lift or prevent contract restrictions.\n\nNote that when the custodians of PD works use clickwrap licenses or other contracts to limit the use of PD digital copies, the restrictions only apply to users who enter the contract. A clickthrough user who leaks a PD digital copy to the wide-open internet may be liable for contract infringement. But all the other internet users around the world are as free to use the PD digital copy as they are to use any other PD work.\n\n* Postscript. For further discussion of #3 and #4 problems, see \"OA for digitization projects\", originally published in the July 2009 SOAN, and slightly revised in Karl Grandin (ed.), _Going Digital: Evolutionary and Revolutionary Aspects of Digitization_, Nobel Foundation, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, April 2011.\n\nhttp://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/07-02-09.htm#digitization\n\nhttp://www.center.kva.se/svenska/forskning/NS147Abstracts/NS147_Suber.pdf\n\n----------\n\nUpdate\n\nI included the following item in the Roundup section of the May 2011 issue of SOAN:\n\nhttp://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/05-02-11.htm#roundup\n\n* David Solomon found that Elsevier's Operative Techniques in Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery charges for access to its masthead and instructions for authors. From Solomon: \"Elsevier, Inc is charging 31.50 (USD) each for access not only to the articles, but the masthead, the listing of the editorial board, table of contents, and even the instructions for authors. Thinking this had to be an oversight, I sent the following query to their support page....'I would appreciate knowing if this is an error or you really intend to charge potential authors $31.50 to get a copy of the instructions for authors.' This is what they wrote back: '...Thank you for contacting Elsevier's e-Helpdesk Support. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. ScienceDirect is an online database for institutions, we do not have a way to give complimentary access to users....' \"\n\nhttps://arl.org/Lists/SPARC-OAForum/Message/5798.html\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10431810\n\nI received a response from Alicia Wise, Elsevier's Director of Universal Access, and have her permission to quote from it.\n\nI read the May edition of SOAN, and was surprised to learn about David Solomon's experience. Elsevier does not in fact charge for access to things like our instructions for authors, editorial board listings, table of contents, and masthead. Unfortunately our customer service department did not interpret his query correctly and so did not communicate effectively on this occasion. In this case the article has been incorrectly marked-up so our systems could not correctly distinguish different elements of the content. To compound the situation we have discovered that our pay-per-view system does not always correctly distinguish different sections of a text, even when they are properly marked-up. We are now in the process of correcting the mark-up, scanning for other articles that may be similarly miscoded, tweaking the pay-per-view system, and using this as an example in our customer service training. Thank you very much for drawing this to our attention, and for any help you can provide to disseminate our response.\n\nFor the full text of Alicia Wise's response, see the 5/20/11 post to SOAF.\n\nhttps://arl.org/Lists/SPARC-OAForum/Message/5837.html\n\n----------\n\nFive years ago in SOAN\n\nSee SOAN for June 2, 2006\n\nhttp://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/06-02-06.htm\n\n* One essay in that issue: \"Good facts, bad predictions\"\n\nhttp://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/06-02-06.htm#facts\n\nExcerpt: \"Among the Kaufman-Wills discoveries were two that I found especially striking:...[First,] the majority of OA journals charge no author-side fees at all....[Second,] the majority of non-OA journals do charge author-side fees (in addition to reader-side subscription fees)....The two facts should have implications for at least five aspects of the debate about OA journals. (1) They should put an end to the false but widespread assumption that there is just one business model for OA journals (the one misnamed the \"author pays\" model). Some OA journals charge author-side fees and some don't --in fact, most don't. That's at least two models....(2) The two facts should put an end to publisher objections that OA journals are more likely than non-OA journals to exclude indigent authors. The only basis for this charge was the hasty generalization that OA journals charged author-side fees and the ignorance that non-OA journals did so more often. Now we know that insofar as charging fees excludes indigent authors, many more subscription journals are guilty than OA journals....(3) The two facts should put an end to publisher objections that OA journals are more likely than non-OA journals to compromise on peer review. This charge is based on the hasty generalization that OA journals charge a fee for every accepted paper, and the presumption that charging such a fee creates a financial incentive to lower standards. Now we know that insofar as charging fees for accepted papers is an incentive to lower standards, many more subscription journals are guilty than OA journals....(4) The two facts should put an end to studies of author attitudes toward OA journals that misinform the interview subjects before interviewing them. I've been a referee for two studies that told authors that OA journals (per se, without qualification) charged \"author fees\" and then asked authors about their willingness to pay. The results were described as author attitudes toward OA journals (per se, without qualification) rather than author attitudes toward fee-charging OA journals. (5) Finally, the two facts should put an end to the myth that if all journals converted to OA, then universities would pay more in author-side fees than they pay now in subscriptions. I want to say a lot more about this one, so let me start a new section....\"\n\n* Another essay in that issue: \"Elsevier offers hybrid journals\"\n\nhttp://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/06-02-06.htm#elsevier\n\nExcerpt: \"Elsevier is making six of its physics journals into hybrid open access journals, and will do the same for 30 more journals, in different fields, in the next two months....The step is welcome even though the program is flawed. It has essentially the same defects that the Springer Open Choice program had when it was first announced. Elsevier's processing fee is very high (the same as Springer's), and may generate a low uptake by authors, especially since traditional page charges will be laid on top of it (same as at Springer). A low uptake will not indicate low interest in OA....Elsevier appears to demand transfer of copyright even for authors who select the new option....Springer required copyright transfer even for its \"Open Choice\" authors until October 2005 when it let authors retain copyright and adopted a home-grown equivalent to the Creative Commons Attribution-NoCommercial license. I hope Elsevier will follow Springer's lead here....Will users be free to download and redistribute the sponsored copies from ScienceDirect or re-deposit them in independent OA repositories? We don't know yet but I suspect the answer will be no. From one point of view, this doesn't matter. Since Elsevier isn't calling the program \"open access\", it needn't live up to the definition. But in another sense it does matter: will users pay $3,000 plus page charges, and give up copyright, if they don't get full OA (and long-term reassurance of OA) in return? ...It might still oppose full OA journals, at least in its own case, but will it still argue that OA journals are unsustainable, second-rate, a threat to peer review and the publishing industry? Will it still lobby against OA archiving initiatives on the ground that they increase the pressure on journals to accept author-side fees? In June 2004, \"writing in [Elsevier's] in-house Review newsletter, Sir Crispin Davis warned that asking researchers to pay for their work to be published but then making it freely available on the internet 'could jeopardise the stable, scalable and affordable system of publishing that currently exists.' \" ...Will we see arguments like that fade away? Let's hope. Will we see a retraction? Probably not....\"\n\n* Another essay in that issue: \"Follow-up on the Federal Research Public Access Act\"\n\nhttp://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/06-02-06.htm#frpaa\n\nExcerpt: \"The Federal Research Public Access Act of 2006 (a.k.a. FRPAA or the Cornyn-Lieberman bill) was introduced in the U.S. Senate last month and has already started a vigorous public debate....[O]n May 31, the bill's prospects shot up when a Harris poll showed that an overwhelming majority of Americans wanted OA for publicly-funded research. 83% wanted it for their doctors and 82% wanted it for everyone. 81% said it would help medical patients and their families cope with chronic illness and disability. 62% said it would speed up the discovery of new cures. For each poll question, a fairly large percentage of respondents checked \"neither agree nor disagree\" (between 13% and 30%), with the result that only tiny minorities actually disagreed with the OA propositions. Only 3% didn't want OA for their doctors, 4% didn't want it for themselves, 5% didn't think it would help patients or their families, and 10% didn't think it would accelerate research....This poll shows that OA is as American as apple pie. Toll access is so unpopular that George Bush's numbers are 10 times higher....Monitoring the press coverage of the FRPAA, I've been struck by something I also noticed during the debate on the NIH policy. Some mainstream news media covering the proposal give much more space and detail to publisher objections than to the proposal's own rationale or to the supporting arguments from researchers, universities, libraries, public-interest advocacy groups, and the decision-makers who drafted the policy....Don't get me wrong: the publisher objections should be reported in full, and I'm never surprised or disappointed when the business press focuses more on the consequences for business than the consequences for scientists, citizens, or public policy. Nor am I surprised when the business press gives more attention to publisher complaints than it gives to the OA policies that triggered them or to the answers from the policy's sponsors and supporters. I'm only surprised and disappointed when the general press follows the business press in this practice. When Congress considers a controversial bill on the environment, opposed by business, some media assume that the protesting businesses must be right. But most assume that there are important values on both sides and cover the story as an honest disagreement. Why is science policy different? Do news media have any reason to think that friends of science are more likely to be wrong than friends of business? ...No doubt, the world of science is much smaller than the world of business, and far fewer readers of general news media care about it.

He compared the citation tallies for OA and non-OA articles from the same journal (PNAS) and disentangled the effects of many \"confounders\" from the effects of OA itself. In his words, \"To my knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study of a cohort of OA and non-OA articles providing direct and strong evidence for preferential or earlier citation of articles published originally as OA. It is also the first study showing an advantage of publishing an article as OA on the journal site over self-archiving (i.e., making the article otherwise online accessible). The strength of the OA effect is particularly surprising because PNAS is a widely available journal that is accessible for most researchers through their library. In addition, articles are made freely available to nonsubscribers 6 mo after publication. The effect of OA publishing may be even higher in fields where journals are not widely available and where articles from the control group remain 'toll-access.' \" There's some controversy about whether some earlier results, especially by Tim Brody, Chawki Hajjem, and Stevan Harnad, are the same or only similar to some of Eysenbach's results. But no one doubts that Eysenbach has new and valid results, or that he has persuasively advanced the case that OA helps authors and journals build their citation impact. While there have been many previous studies of the OA impact advantage, none has made the splash that Eysenbach's has. This is an important result in its own right...\"\n\n----------\n\nTen years ago in SOAN\n\nTen years ago, SOAN was called FOSN (Free Online Scholarship Newsletter) and came out several times a month. Here are excerpts from four issues 10 years ago this month.\n\n* See FOSN for May 18, 2001\n\nhttp://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/05-18-01.htm\n\nExcerpt: \"The United States has made $17 billion since 1993 auctioning off bands of the radio spectrum to the highest bidder, and is expected to make another $18 billion before 2010. What should we do with this money? Last month the Digital Promise Project called on the government to invest $18 billion of this revenue and use the interest to fund non-profit digital initiatives to enhance American education. The interest on such an endowment could easily be $1 billion per year. The endowment would fund educational technologies, teacher training, and free online content of many kinds. The money would be distributed by a new non-profit, non-government agency called the Digital Opportunity Investment Trust (DO IT), which would do for education what NIH does for health and the NSF does for science. The Digital Promise Project draws a very interesting analogy between its proposal to sell public radio spectrum in order to create digital content for education and the 19th century sale of public lands in order to create land-grant colleges and universities. Two phrases used at the project web site suggest that FOS could benefit directly. First, DO IT would be charged to \"digitize America's collected memory stored in our nation's universities, libraries, and museums to make these materials available for use at home, school, and work.\" Second, it would use \"new technologies to disseminate the best of our arts and culture locally, regionally, nationally, and even globally.\" Am I reading too much into these phrases? ...\"\n\nExcerpt: \"Which metaphor --divorce or revolution-- do you like better for the act of a journal breaking from its for-profit publisher and becoming free? I used divorce in the last issue, but here is a call to revolution. Earlier this year SPARC and the Triangle Research Libraries Network launched a campaign to help journals declare independence from their existing publishers and find new forms of publication which will serve their true academic mission. The campaign consists of a web site and a 17-page handbook for journal editors, subtitled \"A Guide to Creating Community-Controlled Science Journals.\" The handbook helps editors understand the wide range of their publishing options. It contains a checklist of questions about the economic state of a journal, and tips on evaluating how various alternatives will meet the needs of the scientific community served by a journal....SPARC and a few partners have created web site (\"Create Change\") to follow-through on the handbook. The web site offers tools for faculty and librarians to help the cause. For example, among the tools for faculty are sample letters refusing to referee papers, resigning from an editorial board, or protesting a journal's subscription price....\"\n\nExcerpt: \"Benjamin Ray is teaching the Salem Witch trials at the University of Virginia. A couple of years ago he rounded up rare and important documents on the trials and digitized them through his university's Electronic Text Center. Now he has downloaded the documents in Microsoft Reader format to a bunch of Hewlett-Packard Journadas. (The $450 handheld Journadas used as e-book readers were on loan from Microsoft for this experiment.) Ray's students come to class with all the documents instantly accessible and searchable in the palms of their hands. When an historical claim comes up in class, they can consult the documents in real time to assess the historian's reading of the sources. Ray has put the same documents on the web free of charge. But until we have fast and wireless web access, texts are more useful for teaching when they are not only free and online, but also portable. A Journada's memory will hold about 90 average sized books. Read about Ray's classroom experience in the current _Chronicle of Higher Education_.

The content comes from pay and no-pay scientific sites all over the web. Above all, it comes from the full corpus of Elsevier science journals....There are two welcome innovations here. First, texts which are not freely available are at least freely searchable. Even users who have paid nothing get bibliographic citations and URLs for articles relevant to their search requests. I remember a service in my field called Brain-Wave Philosophy, which searched the commercial database called Philosophers Index. Brain-Wave charged $0.50 per search and $2.00 per citation. I'm glad to report that its business model failed miserably and quickly. Second, Scirus automatically searches large chunks of what is called the deep internet, the online databases whose content is invisible to ordinary users because it is not indexed by regular search engines.

You get the idea....The whole directory should be organized in a database so that users may browse it or run search and sort queries across its contents.

In print, footnotes and bibliographic citations are inert pointers to literature. In an electronic medium, we can finally make them deliver the goods. Is this promise threatened by recent legal decisions holding that some hyperlinks are unlawful? ...If any [scholarly linking] could be construed as defamatory or fradulent, it might be challenged in court. What would a court say about \"click here for an article drawing invalid conclusions from falsified data\"? Or \"click here for the ranting of a third-rate scholar under the delusion of being a second-rate scholar\"? The Washington Post gives permission for incoming links which do not use its logo or bring up its stories inside a frame. But it reserves the right to \"revoke permission\" for any kind of link at any time. The Post is assuming here that all links must be consensual. This allows it to pass as generous for granting permission in advance to most kinds of incoming link. This is a dangerous model....If you've ever tried to get a publisher's permission to photocopy an article for students, and waited more than six months for a reply, then you can imagine how quickly scholarship would grind to a halt if scholars had to get permission for citation links, even if there was no charge. The only good news here is that the Post position has apparently never been tested, let alone upheld, in court....The hacker magazine, 2600, was convicted last August of violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) for publishing the DeCSS source code on its web site and for linking to other sites which published the code....How far does this precedent go?

I'll report the outcome here....\"\n\nExcerpt: \"Even free online scholarship is not free to produce. Print journals cost more to produce than online journals, but even online journals use up resources, not the least of which is labor. If online scholarship is to be free, then the costs must be made so low that institutions like universities, libraries, foundations, and professional associations can subsidize them without pain.

He thinks it's bad economics to donate his labor as a referee to journals that turn around and gouge his university with exorbitant subscription prices. He's taken a vow not to referee articles for any journal charging more than $1000/year, and to favor those charging less than $300. His arguments and an array of supporting data are available at his home page. Later this year Bergstrom will publish a version of his argument in the _Journal of Economic Perspectives_. Here are a few gems from his supporting data. In 1999, there were 15 economics journals charging more than $1000/year, 11 of them from Elsevier. You might think that the more expensive journals published more pages per year than the others, or were more frequently cited. Not necessarily. When economics journals are sorted by price per page, the highest ranked journal priced over $1000/year showed up in 82nd place. When sorted by citations per page, the best showed up in 51st place. Bergstrom knows that telemarketers and televangelists would pay good money for a list of gullible people, but he is giving away what he calls his \"P.T. Barnum\" list of gullible university libraries that subscribe to the most expensive and least cited journals. The two most expensive economics journals each charge libraries more than $7500/year. They are rarely cited and most economists have never heard of them. By contrast, the six most cited economics journals average $180/year. If your university is on Bergstrom's P.T. Barnum list, tell your head librarian immediately and ask your president for a bounty on the saved money.\"\n\nExcerpt: \"Classicists specializing in ancient Greece are lucky: all their primary texts have been written, all are in the public domain, and all have been digitized. In 1972, the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG) began digitizing Greek literature, starting with Homer and moving forwards. Today the project has digitized the 1,400 years' worth of literature since Homer, bringing the collection up to about year 600 of the common era. The collection includes all extant Greek texts, including those in science and mathematics, poetry and drama, philosophy and religion....The TLG database was originally distributed on specialized Ibycus hardware. In 1985 it became available on CD-ROMs. But starting this spring, institutions may buy a license to read and search the entire corpus over the web....[T]he completeness of the TLG is the advantage that justifies the subscription price. To scholars who can accept a degree of incompleteness, the TLG has a serious rival in the Perseus Digital Library. Perseus contains the full-texts of the most-studied works of Greek antiquity, but not literally every single one. To compensate, Perseus goes beyond Greek to Latin literature and to other special collections (such as the English Renaissance and Californian history), includes English translations along with the original languages, contains a museum's worth of images of ancient art and artifacts, and offers all its content online free of charge....\"\n\nExcerpt: \"Kepler is the first software since eprints for creating OAI-compliant archives.

Astrid Wissenburg, director of partnerships and communications at the Economic and Social Research Council [ESRC] and a member of the RCUK Impact Group, said the move had been instigated by the government's transparency agenda. In support of that aim, David Willetts, the universities and science minister, chaired a recent round-table discussion on promoting greater open access to research. Dr Wissenburg said the research councils had for several years had an open-access mandate that required authors to deposit their papers in open-access repositories as soon as was practicable. The councils also consider author charges for gold open access to be an allowable indirect cost. However, she said, compliance with the mandate was not high and the processes needed to be simplified for researchers....An impending internal research councils' review might result in them pushing the gold route a bit more, Dr Wissenburg said....Michael Jubb, director of the Research Information Network, said cooperation between the funding and research councils was essential to supporting any major move towards open access, in particular the gold version - because the demise of the subscription model would transfer the burden of paying for journals from library budgets, which are provided by the funding councils, to individual researchers, who are funded by the research councils....\"\n\nhttp://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=416334&c=1\n\n* The University of Edinburgh adopted a policy on Research Data Management. \"[T]his is an aspirational policy, and...implementation will take some years....[3] All new research proposals [from date of adoption] must include research data management plans or protocols that explicitly address data capture, management, integrity, confidentiality, retention, sharing and publication....[5] The University will provide mechanisms and services for storage, backup, registration, deposit and retention of research data assets in support of current and future access, during and after completion of research projects....[7] Research data management plans must ensure that research data are available for access and re-use where appropriate and under appropriate safeguards....[10] Exclusive rights to reuse or publish research data should not be handed over to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for re-use, unless this is a condition of funding....\"\n\nhttp://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/information-services/about/policies-and-regulations/research-data-policy\n\n* JISC commissioned the University of Glasgow to create an Open Access Repositories Resource Pack (OARRPack) for the UK Open Access Implementation Group (OAIG). \"This is aimed at encouraging UK universities to adopt Open Access....The aim of this project is to survey the guidance currently available to HEIs in the UK and further afield on why and how they can practically implement a more open approach to the release of their research outputs. By analysing what is currently available, synthesising this, talking to key stakeholders and establishing what new content might need to be produced the project team will then develop an OA resource pack.

The short answer is: yes....[C]opyright law has started to act as a regulatory barrier to the creation of certain kinds of new, internet based businesses....The Prime Minister asked the Review to consider whether our IP framework needs to adapt in the interests of encouraging innovation and growth. The Review's conclusion is that such adaptation is required....Government should take long overdue action to update copyright law in ways designed to increase consumer confidence in the way the law works. It should begin by legislating to release for use the vast treasure trove of copyright works which are effectively unavailable - orphan works - to which access is in practice barred because the copyright holder cannot be traced. This is a move with no economic downside....Copying should be lawful where it is for private purposes, or does not damage the underlying aims of copyright....The UK has chosen not to exercise all of its rights under EU law....Nor does the UK allow its great libraries to archive all digital copyright material, with the result that much of it is rotting away. Taking advantage of these EU sanctioned exceptions will bring important cultural as well as economic benefits to the UK....In addition, there should be a change in rules to enable scientific and other researchers to use modern text and data mining techniques, which copyright prohibits....[N]othing [should be] unusable [just] because the rights owner cannot be found....A work should only be treated as an orphan if it cannot be found by search of the databases involved in the proposed Digital Copyright Exchange....The UK should also promote at EU level an exception to support text and data analytics....The Government should also legislate to ensure that these and other copyright exceptions are protected from override by contract....\"\n\nhttp://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipreview-finalreport.pdf\n\n* The Library Planning Task Force of the University of California's Systemwide Library and Scholarly Information Advisory Committee (SLASIAC) released its interim report for public comment. \"[T]he [UC] libraries may experience budget reductions of as much as $52 million, or 21 percent of their current budget base, over the next six years....[T]his cut is greater than the total library budget of any single UC campus, and roughly equivalent to the budgets of three of our mid-sized campuses....As a result of ongoing increases in the prices charged by publishers for scholarly material in both print and digital formats, the libraries will likely lose the equivalent of $17 million in buying power over the same period. This is equivalent to the current library materials budgets of two mid-sized campuses, and means a reduction in the systemwide acquisition rate of about 200,000 items per year....The adverse effects of the anticipated budget cuts cannot be entirely avoided....However, the effects of the cuts can be mitigated through collaboration....[Recommendation 2 of 4:] Support faculty efforts to change the system of scholarly communication....To foster successful change in scholarly publishing and communication, UC faculty must be prepared to: [1] Retain and manage their copyrights in the works they produce, [2] Participate actively in new publishing models and innovations in scholarly communication that more effectively serve the interests of the scholarly community, [3] Decline to publish in, edit or review for journals that persist in unacceptable pricing or copyright practices, [4] Encourage their academic colleagues and scholarly societies to take similar actions....Among the institutional strategies that UC might adopt or continue in support of the faculty are: [1] Assisting and supporting the faculty as they seek to explore and use alternatives to traditional methods of scholarly publishing and develop and adopt new modes of scholarly communication that are aligned with emerging changes in methods of research and teaching. [2] Supporting the faculty by conveying to them information about the actual costs of publications and the expenses incurred by their libraries in providing access to scholarly information. [3] Continuing and fortifying its strong negotiating positions with publishers. As the negotiations with Elsevier and the NPG have demonstrated, a reasonable negotiating position backed by the full force of faculty support and UC's economic clout can make a difference both to the University and to the larger community of higher education institutions. [4] Encouraging and supporting the adoption of open-access publishing. The many varieties of open-access scholarly communication promise both significant academic benefits, by making peer-reviewed research results available to all without subscription charges to readers or their institutions, and significant financial benefits, by reducing and permitting reallocation of the costs of scholarly publishing. The University has already taken affirmative steps in this direction by supporting new open-access journals, helping to cover the costs for UC faculty publishing in author-pays open-access journals, and providing support for author compliance with the NIH open-access deposit policy. [5] Redirecting a portion of the funding currently used for purchase of traditional print and digital publications to the support of alternative publishing models that advance the interests and values of the academic community....\" Comments are welcome until September 2, 2011.\n\nhttp://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/25549\n\nhttp://libraries.universityofcalifornia.edu/planning/taskforce/\n\nhttp://libraries.universityofcalifornia.edu/planning/taskforce/interim_report_package_2011-05-09.pdf\n\n* The US Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) recently invited review by a Committee of Visitors (COV).
