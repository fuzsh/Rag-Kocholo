He became a pioneer of the gold Open-Access movement, created one of the first open-access journals, co-founded the OASPA (Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association), and built a respected global publishing firm known for its quality and forward-thinking innovations (one of Canadaâ€™s Fastest Growing Companies). He is also the co-inventor of TrendMD, a company he co-founded as Chief Science Officer, which is another avenue to disseminate scientific information in a targeted manner.
