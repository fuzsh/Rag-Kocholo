        "text": "Before I began to use Twitter [which is equivalent to, before I became an academic], I used to hate on it. Why would I waste my time with one more endless feed of information and random chit-chat?\n\nHowever, if you are a scientist, then by the nature of the work you do, you must be closely familiar with the work of at least a few, but more likely, quite a few other scientists.\n\nIt varies a lot by the discipline or sub-area, but in many of the most cutting edge research areas, scientists use Twitter in ways that can be highly meaningful and impactful to their careers.\n\nFor example:\n\nTwitter is an excellent way to publicize your work, especially before, during, and after conferences. Use of Twitter can increase citation counts [1]. Most of your followers are likely to be other academics at first, but growing your audience and writing about your work in short form can eventually lead to outcomes such as media coverage of newsworthy science [2]. Some academics I know Tweet more-or-less only when they have a paper accepted. Great! It‚Äôs an easy way (in a public forum!) to show that you do, in fact, accomplish work. And it does, in fact, *occasionally* get published. Celebrate, cite, and be merry!\n\nYou can also be creative and strategic in how you represent yourself to the world, apart from your publications [3,4]. What have you accomplished lately? What have you failed at, and learned from? What is your personality and sense of humor like? Many academics enjoy casual conversations and jokes on Twitter [5]. It‚Äôs an enriching way to connect with people you enjoy in small, fun bursts.\n\nMeaningful relationships can be formed on Twitter. This one‚Äôs a personaI anecdote. I recently met a new collaborator from a different institution over Twitter; her contributions then made a huge positive impact on our recent paper submission. A sample size of one is a proof of concept, but I‚Äôd bet money that others have had similar experiences.\n\nI could make this list longer, but who has time for that? üòõ The point is, there are known benefits.\n\nAnd yes, of course, there are also challenges, hurdles, and risks [3,4], which I will not dwell on here. These are not insignificant issues‚Äìyet as with all things, it is possible to learn and grow in order to overcome barriers and develop skills.\n\nIf nothing else, being on Twitter feels a bit like asserting to the rest of your field that you too, do, exist. In the long run (or at least as long as Twitter remains a thing), your presence there can go far to amplify your voice in a space where other people will go on talking, whether or not you decide to participate.\n\nIf you‚Äôre a new graduate student, this is especially important. More likely than not, no one knows who you are yet. You‚Äôve got a lot to learn and explore, and that‚Äôs exciting! Follow the leaders in your discipline on Twitter, and you‚Äôll get access to at least some of what they‚Äôre thinking about. It is educational, enriching, and entertaining! The three E‚Äôs! (Is that a thing?)\n\nAnyway, here‚Äôs a bit of good news to end on: I‚Äôm fairly certain that you will, indeed, go on existing‚Äìwhether or not you get on Twitter. But why not give it a tweet, and see what‚Äôs out there? üòõ\n\nMake your profile today. (And you can follow me too! I exist, I swear!)\n\n[Photo credit: https://unsplash.com/photos/V6CdmV277nY, https://www.pngegg.com/en/png-zyqtc]\n\n‚Ä¶\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Eysenbach, Gunther. ‚ÄúCan tweets predict citations?
