Of all adult Internet users, 80 percent, or about 93 million Americans, research health topics online. Most individuals surveyed by Pew claimed that the Internet has positively affected their health and they trust the information they find.\n\nHowever, numerous studies have shown that, in many cases, patients should not believe the health material they read on the Web. These studies have identified three main problems facing Internet health surfers: inaccurate information, complicated writing style and ineffective search engines.\n\nInaccurate health Web sites outnumber reliable sites, according to doctors. For example, Dr. Gunther Eysenbach of Toronto General Hospital’s Centre for Global eHealth Innovation and his associates reviewed 79 studies of the quality of Internet health information. In their evaluation of the methods the researchers used to assess the Web sites, they found that only nine percent of the investigations described Internet health information as reliable. Those investigations used lower standards that the other studies. According to a report by Dr. Gretchen Berland and her colleagues at the RAND Corporation for research analysis, more than half of Web health sites contain conflicting material. For example, they discovered a childhood asthma Web site that in one area reported that inhaled steroids stunt children’s growth and then in another area that they do not. Many sites are incomplete, ignoring half of the topics doctors considered essential for visitors of the particular site, Dr. Berland and her associates reported. For example, few sites that discussed suicidal thoughts advised people having these thoughts to “seek care promptly.”\n\nThe complicated terms and long sentences health Web sites use often confuse people, leading them to trust information precisely because they cannot understand it, according to Pew. Those surveyed said that they assume Web authors must know what they are explaining when they use complicated terms, just as the sprinkling of technical words in conversation can make anyone sound like an expert.The average reading level of Internet health information was high at 13.2, the level on which a college freshman should be able to read. Pew reported that the average consumer reads on a much lower reading level, sixth to eighth grade, making most health information too difficult for them to fully understand. Marketers write most consumer materials on seventh to..."
