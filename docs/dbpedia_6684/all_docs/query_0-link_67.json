        "text": "Here is a fascinating NPR news story about using people’s addiction to computer games to advance science.\n\nPeople can get pretty addicted to computer games. By some estimates, residents of planet Earth spend 3 billion hours per week playing them. Now some scientists are hoping to make use of all that human capital and harness it for a good cause.

Now Fenner and Euan Adie finished the first phase of an interesting new experiment, the CrowdoMeter project.\n\nIn the last 2 months, they used crowdsourcing to analyze the semantic content of almost 500 tweets linking to scholarly papers (953 classifications by 105 users for 467 tweets). Their preliminary results show:\n\n3 predominant subject areas: Medicine and Health, Life Sciences, and Social Sciences and Economics.\n\nMost tweets (88%) discussed the papers, 10% were in agreement, 3% disagreed.\n\nMost papers are not tweeted by their authors or publishers\n\nIn his recent guest post on Impact of Social Sciences, Fenner makes the argument that “social media, and Twitter in particular, provide almost instant, relevant recommendations as opposed to traditional citations.\n\nA few years from now the ‘personalized journal’ will have replaced the traditional journal as the primary means to discover new scholarly papers with impact to our work.\n\nWhat is still missing are better tools that integrate social media with scholarly content, in particular personalized recommendations based on the content you are interested in (your Mendeley or CiteULike library are a good approximation) and the people you follow on Twitter and other social media.\n\nFenner’s view is also based on Gunther Eysenbach’s study from 2011 that showed “highly tweeted papers were more likely to become highly cited (but the numbers were to small for any firm conclusions; 12 out of 286 papers were highly tweeted)”.\n\nFenner and Adie are using altmetric.com to track the scholarly impact of your research. Other tools – some of which we wrote about – include ReaderMeter, Total Impact, PLoS Article-Level Metrics, and ScienceCard.\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nIt’s a group of currently more than 75 crowdsourcing industry practitioners that share “best practices, education, data collection and public dialog.” Interesting for us, as problems become more complex, the Consortium could be helpful in defining the right crowdsourcing model for future crowdsourcing needs at UCSF and CTSI.\n\nThe Crowdsortium aims to provide each of these constituents with the knowledge, data and best practices to get the most out of participating in crowdsourcing.\n\nThe Crowdsortium recognizes that the crowdsourcing ecosystem is comprised of five participants: funders, practitioners, customers, the crowd and researchers.\n\nAs the problems crowdsourcing address become more complex, so do the problems that the crowdsourcing ecosystem face.\n\nFor example: THE CROWDSOURCING ECOSYSTEM\n\n• What crowdsourcing model should we use?\n\n• How do we handle intellectual property rights?\n\n• How do we logistically manage international participants?\n\n• How do we fairly reward participants for their work?\n\n• What are the benefits of monetary versus non-monetary rewards?\n\n• How can game mechanics influence crowd dynamics?\n\n• Should the crowd be anonymous or individually identified with their real names?\n\nAnyone may participate in the public forums, feeds and email lists related to this website, members, however, enjoy additional benefits. Membership is currently available for funders, practitioners, customers and researchers at no cost.

The panel was called “Four Steps to Using Research Networking Effectively at Your Institution”\n\nGriffin spoke on cutting edge features of research networking tools, such as linked open data and social network analysis.\n\nEric Meeks of UCSF spoke on standard APIs, such as OpenSocial, to leverage a community of developers, I spoke about incentivize usage and understand your audience, and to round it out, Brian Turner spoke about using data, tools and strangers to improve user interfaces.\n\nThe panel presentation was a 90 minute break out session and we were happy to have a good turnout and an engaged audience. I think that the work that UCSF has put into the ‘social engineering’ of the tool has really paid off. Our usage and engagement numbers are on the rise and comparatively speaking, Griffin mentioned that our traffic is about 5-times that of what Harvard Profiles is currently getting.\n\nIn addition, Eric also had a poster session at the meeting!\n\nThe UCSF presentations will be up on Slideshare, available on the CTSI channel and via our individual UCSF profiles:\n\nhttp://profiles.ucsf.edu/ProfileDetails.aspx?From=SE&Person=5333232\n\nhttp://profiles.ucsf.edu/ProfileDetails.aspx?From=SE&Person=4621800\n\nhttp://profiles.ucsf.edu/ProfileDetails.aspx?From=SE&Person=5333232\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nThis week’s NIH conference “Crowdsourcing: The Art and Science of Open Innovation” could be a hint that the research agency is seriously considering new ways to take advantage of the “processing power of lots of willing brains”.\n\nScienceInsider published a summary report that states:\n\nNIH Director Francis Collins would soon sign papers that would ensure NIH is compliant with the America COMPETES Act, which gives federal agencies the authority to offer cash incentives for researchers to tackle high-risk, high-reward research questions that have eluded more traditional funding platforms, such as grants and sponsored research.\n\nThe America COMPETES Act was first passed in 2007 and was reauthorized in December. Under its authority, federal agencies outline a problem they’d like solved on Challenge.gov, then open the competition to individuals or teams, evaluate the results, and award a money prize to whoever turns in the best solution.\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nIt can be challenging to create animated video that conveys a complex message.

The study was based on data contributed by 596 patients with the disease, formally called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS. By showing that the drug didn’t have any effect on progression of the condition, it contradicted a small study three years ago that suggested such a benefit was possible. The new study, published online in the journal Nature Biotechnology, represents an early example of how social networking could play a role in clinical trials, an area of medical science with strict procedures that many would consider especially difficult to apply in the online world.” [via]\n\nRead more:\n\nPatientsLikeMe press release\n\nWall Street Journal story\n\nFull text of the paper from Nature Biotechnology\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nHeritage Provider Network (HPN) is launching the $3 million Heritage Health Prize, with help from data prediction contest operator Kaggle.\n\nHPN is releasing anonymized patient health records, hospitalization records, and claims data. The team that can come up with the best algorithm to predict which patients have the greatest need for hospitalization wins the big bucks.\n\nAs they put it:\n\n“More than 71 Million individuals in the United States are admitted to hospitals each year, according to the latest survey from the American Hospital Association. Studies have concluded that in 2006 well over $30 billion was spent on unnecessary hospital admissions. Each of these unnecessary admissions took away one hospital bed from someone else who needed it more…Can we identify earlier those most at risk and ensure they get the treatment they need? The Heritage Provider Network (HPN) believes that the answer may be “yes” – but to do it will require harnessing the world’s top experts from many fields. Heritage launched the $3 million Heritage Health Prize with one goal in mind: to develop a breakthrough algorithm that uses available patient data, including health records and claims data, to predict and prevent unnecessary hospitalizations.\n\nLink\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nIt is exactly what you think it is.
