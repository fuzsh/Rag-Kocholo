        "text": "Joey Barton, a former professional footballer and manager, grew up as a young boy on the streets of Huyton, Merseyside. A boy with a childhood dream, he went on to make 269 appearances in the Premier League, including Manchester City. Barton‚Äôs career however, was fraught with controversy, involving gambling and assaults. Huyton, where Barton was born and raised, became well known in 2005, due to the racially motivated murder of Anthony Walker. It was for issues like this, that Barton had such a dream; something to get him away from trouble. You see, the two offenders were young, 17 and 20 years old, with the 17 year old, Michael Barton; Joeys younger brother. Like him or loathe him, Joey Barton wanted better for his life, and whilst he managed to succeed in becoming a footballer, he never managed to get away from his roots of Huyton and embedded violent tendencies. Joey Barton needed positivity from those around him, support when things were going against him and someone in his corner to cheerlead him unconditionally. We need to change the narrative and celebrate successes, dreams and aspirations, instead of ridiculing those who express desires and whom dare to be different. We must consciously be the role model others need us to be, so we can actively influence a culture of positivity, dreams, visions and safety. #evolvingmanproject #author #jayroberts #alphamale #family #positivethinking #choice #ownership #priorities #effort #ego #culture #empowerment #inspire #emotionalintelligence #culturalarchitect #keynotespeaker #confidence #diaryofaninnerlion #empathy #values #gentleman #manifest #trusttheprocess #rolemodel\n\nThis is how you can call yourself and others a \"Team\". Willingness to serve. Yes, you heard that right - to serve. It may seem counterintuitive, but it has the power to transform organizations. I thought that my role was to make all the decisions and be the one in control. But as I started to truly listen to others and value their input, I saw a shift in the dynamics. By incorporating their ideas and suggestions into the plans, the goals were achievable faster and with more enthusiasm. The overall efficiency of the organization improved. But being an effective leader goes beyond just listening to others. It also involves regulating our own emotions. We are all human, and emotions can sometimes get the best of us. However, being aware of our emotions and understanding how they affect our behavior is a crucial tool in leadership. It allows us to regulate our opinions, judgments, and attention, leading to better decision-making and overall success.
