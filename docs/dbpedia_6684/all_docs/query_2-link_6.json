        "text": "Looking forward to hearing the latest research at the intersection of caste, business and society, and meeting colleagues (at Bath, June 19-21). We have some very neat research being presented, and a keynote by Prof. Surinder S. Jodhka. Those interested are welcome to listen to the keynote and other sessions by using the links given in the program document. Thanks to Vivek Soundararajan and the team at the University of Bath School of Management for putting together this great program. Thanks also to my co-organizers Kamini Gupta and Akshay Mangla. Guest editors of the Business & Society special issue on caste will also be around to provide feedback on paper ideas.\n\nLast week, we had the pleasure of celebrating the 2023 winners of the National Academies Eric and Wendy Schmidt Awards for Excellence in Science Communications. Winners, committee members, jury members, guests, and staff all came together to honor the incredible achievements of the 24 winners. What a night! ✨ To learn more about the awards and sign up for the SciComm Excellence e-newsletter visit: https://lnkd.in/gE7XfUbQ #sciencecommunication"
