        "text": "Telemedicine is defined as the use of electronic information and communication technologies for health care professionals to provide care to patients. Although available since the pre–COVID-19 era, a huge surge in teledermatology consultations occurred during the COVID-19 outbreak. As access to health care became limited and difficult due to repeated lockdowns, teledermatology helped us provide health care to our patients. Moreover, as dermatology is a visual field, it was even more suitable for teleconsultations.\n\nNovel internet-based applications and associated technologies have influenced all aspects of our society, ranging from areas of commerce and business to entertainment and health care. Education is no exception. In this context, this study was designed to evaluate the impact of a dermatology e-learning program on the academic performance of medical students.\n\nThe US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has adopted teledermatology, predominantly asynchronous, as an important strategy for improving access to expert skin care for its 9 million enrolled veteran patients. Despite the measurable success of its teledermatology program, one-fifth of all points of care have yet to implement teledermatology. The application of implementation science approaches offers the opportunity to systematically understand the VA’s teledermatology experience to yield insights into and lessons for implementing teledermatology widely as well as locally. Implementation frameworks and theories include the use of the Organizational Readiness for Change instrument as a prognosticator for implementation success, as well as the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to assess the longitudinal implementation of a teledermatology initiative for rural veterans. Development and implementation of novel technological innovations that introduce new teledermatology workflows into mature teledermatology environments were analyzed during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCOVID-19 has exposed the fragility of global health systems. However, the pandemic is perceived to have boosted the use of technology and accelerated digital health solutions (DHS). In Latin America, DHS can increase accessibility and provide more efficient health services. Various key players have relevant roles for innovation within the health care systems. For this study, we focused on health-tech start-ups (developers) and health care providers (implementers) who can cocreate and develop new health care solutions.\n\nSince the beginning of 2020, many societal systems have been used to extend the health care system, which were not planned for, and as such, there is concern for its collapse. Clearly, the collapse of the health care system, primarily hospitals, has been a key concern, and many initiatives, including lockdown and curfew, were taken to avoid such a collapse. The internet was the key platform used to enable people to work from home, provide remote teaching, conduct meetings on the web, etc. However, when it comes to data communication and processing, the risk of collapse is not the only risk, and maybe not even the biggest one. Many systems were not properly adapted for used in such a hurry, which did not allow time (and concern) for a proper risk and privacy assessment.\n\nIn response to the significant stressors on health care delivery created by COVID-19, CITRIS Health and partner organizations developed 2 telehealth solutions through a rapid co-design process: Lighthouse and ACTIVATE. These programs were developed to support providers serving underserved and vulnerable populations who lack the tools and resources to support patients with chronic illness or who are isolated. These challenges were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which increased the need for resources to support vulnerable patients who could not come into a clinic in person or were isolated and lacked access to services. ACTIVATE and Lighthouse apply 2 different telehealth strategies to reach vulnerable populations.\n\nThe use of telemedicine services has increased worldwide during recent years as a result of national strategies for the digitalization of health care and the COVID-19 pandemic. However, health care professionals often express uncertainty regarding the evidence and effectiveness of telemedicine interventions. Therefore, the Centre for Innovative Medical Technology at Odense University Hospital introduced the TELEMED database, an evidence-based telemedicine database."
