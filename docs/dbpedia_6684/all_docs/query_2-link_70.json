        "text": "AMIA is the American Medical Informatics Association. I just gave the opening keynote at their annual conference. What a thrill.\n\n“Informatics” has various definitions, but what it boils down to is that it’s everything about the use of I.T. to support clinical activities. Or, as one senior figure told me at dinner last night, “Informatics is computer science that cares about what’s in the data.” (That’s as opposed to computer science where all they do is move the data around, regardless of what’s in it.)\n\nAMIA has a special spot in my heart because my primary physician Dr. Danny Sands is one of the best known figures in it. Walking around with him there, it’s obvious how many people love him.\n\nAnd, well, these are my people: data geeks! My whole career has been involved one way or another with information technology, and that’s what this association is about.\n\nI had extreme anxiety about this talk, partly because I so wanted to do justice to the many fine people I know there who invited me, partly because it was a huge audience (2,000), but also because I only had one hour, and I had two hours of things to say. So many important things to think about – what to include and what not? And how to put it together in a sequence that builds to a fitting conclusion?\n\nWell, it worked out. A standing ovation (see photo). What an honor, what a thrill.\n\nI’m truly humbled, thrilled and happy to be able to connect this well with an audience that I so admire. Thank you especially to AMIA board member Bonnie Westra, of the U of Minnesota School of Nursing, and John Holmes of the U of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine [see comment below], for initiating this invitation. I was invited to last year’s event but was already booked – so we signed this deal in July 2012. Couldn’t have worked out better.\n\nA taste of how fun it was is in the Twitter feed below.\n\nRogelio Pante MD,FHM ‏@HealthITDoc22m Thank you. That’s very inspirational and powerful talk.\n\nGunther Eysenbach @eysenbach Thanks for the excellent keynote @ePatientDave – standing ovations well deserved\n\nTomasz Adamusiak @7omasz Great keynote! #AMIA2013 Geek power! “Come to the dork side” bit.ly/1bGBFpa\n\n@titusschleyer: #AMIA2013 @ePatientDave charming #informaticians with “Come to the dork side. We have pi.”\n\n@titusschleyer: #AMIA2013 @ePatientDave ‘s keynote too interesting to tweet about it – you just gotta be there!\n\nThe fastest way to my heart is through Legally Blonde references… Go @ePatientDave! #AMIA2013\n\n@ePatientDave knew importance of quality info from past job; couldn’t believe #EHR users were blasé about faulty data #AMIA2013\n\n@GenomeGal: @ePatientDave is a hoot! I’ve not ever heard this much laughter during a keynote session ever! Thank you!! #AMIA2013\n\n@ePatientDave never disappoints–always a different story to make the case for engaged patients #AMIA2013\n\nHeard him 3x already, always new material, always powerful. Amazed he’s done 200 keynotes MT @GenomeGal: @ePatientDave is a hoot! #AMIA2013\n\n@hjs: @ePatientDave “I felt like Reese Witherspoon in Legally Blonde except I didn’t have a chihuahua in my pocket” – best keynote line …\n\n@kim_nolen: @ePatientDave makes me laugh and cry at the same time — #amia2013\n\n@slabkoff: ePatient Dave is telling one of the most compelling stories about being a patient #AMIA2013 ACOR is important resource\n\n@eysenbach: #AMIA2013 @ePatientDave ‘s keynotes are just getting better and better http://t.co/ZG9sDQI4A5\n\n@bradcrotty: Patient community does not replace medical literature, but does supplement it. BMJ essay: http://t.co/ypbdjhbB6H\n\n@ePatientDave continues to provide incredibly provocative stories about his medical experience. Pharma, biotech needs to hear.\n\n@RossMartin: The future of medicine is really different – half of all humans who have ever lived to 65 are alive today.\n\n#AMIA2013 #ePatientDave is simply an inspiration… Best description of the “Health Landscape” I have heard to date.. speaks volumes!\n\n@GenomeGal People who ignore fact that patients will bring something positive to the table are in denial and will achieve less #AMIA2013\n\n@slabkoff: @ePatientDave talk may be the best since Dan Masys 2000 Genomics Opening Plenary #AMIA2013. Practical, meaningful and heart felt.\n\n@johnschrom: “It’s perverse to keep people in the dark and then call them ignorant.” –@ePatientDave #Amia2013\n\n@lrasmus: Wow, just wow @ePatientDave – thanks for a great keynote at #AMIA2013\n\n@ArifKamalMD: Mind = blown. @ePatientDave says all #cancer pts should seek peer support in http://acor.org . I agree! #AMIA2013\n\n‏@SusannahFox@RossMartin @ePatientDave Thanks for the shout-out! Here’s the post about how Googling = patient engagement http://susannahfox.com/2013/05/03/googling-is-a-sign-of-patient-engagement/ … #AMIA2013\n\nComments"
