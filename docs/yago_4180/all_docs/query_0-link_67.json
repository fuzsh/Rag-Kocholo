        "text": "JAPAN\n\nThe most ambitious attempt ever to screen Japanese silent cinema was showcased in Sacile 2001, curated by Hiroshi Komatsu and Tomonori Saiki. Only 1–5% of Japanese silent cinema survives. The retrospective was to an exceptionally high degree a jigsaw puzzle. Many films were extremely fragmentary, and print quality was often awful. However, we are looking forward to a continuation of this retrospective, as many important films were not shown. I saw less than a half of the retrospective. Special thanks to many fine translations in this retrospective.\n\nSPECIAL EVENT\n\nKurutta ippeiji (A Page of Madness, 1926), D: Teinosuke Kinugasa. This legendary film has lost none of its power to shock. Its audacious montage and furious dance patterns feel contemporary in the techno age. Teho Teardo's live electronic music accompaniment was bold and successful. ****\n\nBENSHI\n\nOrochi (The Monster, 1925), D: Bunaro Futagawa. 16mm, benshi commentary: Miss Midori Sawato, music: Coloured Monotone. One of the oldest jidai geki to have survived complete and in good condition. Furious action among the samurai and the yakuza. ***\n\nBETWEEN FICTION AND NON-FICTION\n\nUne rue à Tokyo I (FR/JP 1898) Lumière, PH: Tsunekichi Shibata\n\nUne rue à Tokyo II (FR/JP 1898) Lumière, PH: Tsunekichi Shibata\n\nUne avenue à Tokyo (FR/JP 1898) Lumière, PH: Tsunekichi Shibata\n\nUne place publique à Tokyo (FR/JP 1898) Lumière, PH: Tsunekichi Shibata\n\nStation de chemin de fer de Tokyo (FR/JP 1898) Lumière, PH: Tsunekichi Shibata\n\nFive precious views of city life. ****\n\nMomijigari (Maple Viewing, 1899) PH: Tsunekichi Shibata, featuring the famous Kabuki actors Danjuro IX and Kikugoro V. 16mm, no translation. Of great value as a record of the Kabuki theatre.\n\nTaikoki judanme (The Tenth Act of Taikoki, 1908). Kabuki style in a fiction film.\n\nNippon nankyoku tanken (Japanese Expedition to Antarctica, 1912)\n\nSendaihagi (JP 1916) fragment of a part of a Kabuki play.\n\nSesshonomiya denka katsudo shashin tenrankai gotairan jikkyo (The Prince Regent's Visit to the Motion Picture Exhibition, 1921)\n\nShigeki nanko ketsubetsu (The Historical Drama, the Farewell Scenes of Kusunoki Masahige and His Son, 1921)\n\nThe Prince Regent, the future Emperor Hirohito, visited a motion picture exhibition. Both his visit and a Kabuki performance for him were filmed.\n\nJIDAI GEKI (HISTORICAL DRAMA)\n\nIn the film production in the Kansai Region after the great Kanto earthquake of 1923, the small independents contributed especially to the genre of jidai geki - films set in the feudal period, before the Meiji Restoration of 1868.\n\nKeyamura rokusuke (Rokusuke of Keya Village, 1926), D: Tamizo Ishida. Too fast at 24 fps. A furious swordplay film.\n\nTekketsudan (Iron Blood Gang, 1928), D: Ryota Kawanami. Very physical action film, beautifully toned, excellent wrestling scenes.\n\nRoningai daiichiwa (Ronin Street I, 1928), D: Masahiro Makino. Fragmentary, too fast at 24 fps, no translation.\n\nRoningai dainiwa (Ronin Street II, 1929), D: Masahiro Makino. Fine action scenes in parts I-II of the samurai story. Part III has not survived.\n\nKokushi muso (Peerless Patriot, 1932), D: Mansaku Itami. Fragments restored from an abridged 9,5mm Pathé-Baby version, from an evidently stylish film, with fine humoristic scenes and comic fights.\n\nGENDAI GEKI (MODERN DRAMA)\n\nAfter the 1923 earthquake the Shinpa play became anachronistic, at least in the motion picture. The tragic destiny of young people no longer suited the mood of contemporary life. Now the audience demanded more plausible content in motion picture drama. The mood and taste of the times transformed Shinpa into gendai geki (modern drama). (HK)\n\nNasake no hikari (Lights of Sympathy, 1926), D: Henry Kotani. Beautiful print of a story of social education: poor boy helps sick mother while father is in jail. Fine cinematography influenced Japanese film production.\n\nNippon (DE 1932) – German compilation by Carl Koch incorporating material from: Tempei jidai-kaito Samimaro (JP 1928, The Time of the Tempei Shamimaro, D: Eichi Koishi), Kagaribi (JP 1928, Torches, D: Tetsuroku Hoshi), Daitokai rodoshahen (JP 1930, The Great Metropolis: Chapter on Labour, D: Kiyohiko Ushihara). Beautiful sonorized 16mm print from Cinémathèque française of a compilation combining jidai geki and gendai geki, bringing us from historical Japan to the present. Spectacular scenes from three lost films.\n\nTHE MASTERS\n\nFurusato no uta (The Song of Home, 1925), D: Kenji Mizoguchi. The earliest surviving film by KM in a beautiful print. The story of a young boy who rejects the frivolous company of the city people and chooses to become a farmer, instead. KM's first socially conscious \"message film\" shows a direct but naively digested influence of Tolstoy. The strength: the joy of light. Music would be necessary to this silent film, which is apparently inspired by a song. **\n\nChokon (1926), D: Daisuke Ito. Only the last reel of the eight-reel feature survives, but it is the brilliant climactic swordfight with virtuoso montage, subjective camera, and breathtaking action as the protagonist enters his final battle.\n\nChuji tabi nikki (A Diary of Chuji's Travels, 1927), II: Shinshu kessho hen (Bloody Laughter in Shinshu), III: Goyo hen (In the Name of the Law), D: Daisuke Ito. Of the original 6540 meters of the legendary masterpiece, 1800 meters survive. Beautiful calligraphy of the intertitles. The shocking trajectory of the protagonist from the invincible samurai to the paralysed body on the stretcher.\n\nJujiro (Crossroads / Im Schatten des Yoshiwara, 1928), D: Teinosuke Kinugasa. English version. For decades virtually the only Japanese silent film known in the West. Visual brio and grotesque stylization in an exposé of the empty seductions of Yoshiwara. ***\n\nAkeyuku sora (The Dawning Sky, 1929), D: Torajiro Saito. A bad 16mm print. A woman's film, a melancholy modern story of a woman who has to leave her baby with her husband's parents. Emotionally powerful. ***\n\nIshikawa Goemon no hoji (A Buddhist Mass for Goemon Iskikawa, 1930), D: Torajiro Saito. A blow-up from 9,5mm Pathé Baby. A ghost comedy.\n\nKuma no deru kaikonchi (The Reclaimed Land Where Bears Live, 1932), D: Shigeyoshi Suzuki. A not-brilliant print of a film with apparent epic grandeur. Using the sweeping landscapes of Hokkaido the saga depicts the revenge of two generations of farmers. ***\n\nOSCAR MICHEAUX & HIS CIRCLE: AFRICAN-AMERICAN FILMMAKING AND RACE CINEMA OF THE SILENT ERA\n\nPearl Bowser, Jane M. Gaines and Charles Musser have compiled an ambitious seven-part touring show covering the little known early decades of African-American cinema. Most of the early African-American films have been lost, and the rest survives often in disfigured prints. The book to the tour by Bowser, Gaines, and Musser, Oscar Micheaux & His Circle, meets the highest standards, and is an inspiring basis for all future research. I saw only two samples. Within Our Gates and Black and Tan I had seen previously.\n\nMidnight Ramble: Oscar Micheaux and the Story of Race Movies (1993, D: Pearl Bowser, Bestor Cam). Video projection. A fine introduction to early African-American cinema with lots of excerpts. ***\n\nBody and Soul (1925, D: Oscar Micheaux). The young Paul Robeson is stunning in the starring double role: electrifying presence and great versatility as a heavy, as a preacher, and as a regular guy. We know his voice; here he impresses in a silent film. Charles Musser's essay in the book reveals the surprising background to the film and the reason why Robeson never mentioned this film (his best?). ***\n\nEVENTI MUSICALI\n\nMitä on tekeillä sirkus Beelyssä? (Was ist los in Zirkus Beely?, DE 1926), D+starring: Harry Piel, based on two novels by Max Bauer. Harry Piel had an amazingly successful career as the \"German Fairbanks\", and this is one of his most extravagant adventure films. The ambitious musical accompaniment by the double bass virtuoso Nicola Perricone and his orchestra had the unfortunate side effect of putting the audience to sleep due to the heavy use of the double-bass. **?\n\nNykyajan Babylon (East Side, West Side, US 1927) D: Allan Dwan, starring George O'Brien. A great contemporary spectacle of metropolitan life, including a Titanic episode. Great-looking and a bit superficial. Wonderful music by Donald Sosin and his orchestra. Brilliant MoMA restoration. **\n\nSAVING THE SILENTS\n\nA Western Girl (US 1911), D: Gaston Méliès, starring Francis Ford. GEH restoration. OK Western is a love story in a mining camp.\n\nWest of Hot Dog (US 1924), UCLA restoration starring Stan Laurel as an \"Eastern tenderfoot adrift in a rough-and-tumble Wild West town\" (Charles Hopkins).\n\nHands Up (US 1918), D: James W. Horne, starring Ruth Roland, Louis Gasnier. Promotional special trailer for a lost serial.\n\nYhteiskunnan vihollinen (The Penalty, US 1920), D: Wallace Worsley, starring Lon Chaney. Brilliant GEH restoration 2001 from camera negative. The incredible melodrama of the revenge of the crippled king of the underworld of San Francisco. Full of weird observations. ***\n\nCENTENARIES\n\nMaldone (FR 1928), D: Jean Grémillon, DP: Georges Périnal, AD: André Barsacq. One of the great discoveries of the Festival was this Grémillon Centenary special, a picaresque story of a rambling man called Maldone. A masterpiece of the same class as Gardiens de phare. ****\n\nMITCHELL AND KENYON\n\nThe British Film Institute's Peter Worden Collection of Mitchell and Kenyon Films (GB 1899-1913) consists of some 780 nitrate negatives. The ambitious preservation and restoration project is now starting to be showcased. Brilliant pictorial quality, but for a foreigner somewhat boring and repetitious subject matter.\n\n(Mitchell and Kenyon 49: Fish's Waterfall Mill, Blackburn) 1900?\n\n(Mitchell and Kenyon 6: Haslam's Ltd. Colne, 29.1.1900)\n\n(Mitchell and Kenyon 28: Lumb and Sons, Huddersfield) 1900?\n\n(Mitchell and Kenyon 24: Pilkington Glass Works, St. Helen's 3.10.1900)\n\n(Mitchell and Kenyon 25: Pilkington Glass Works, St. Helen's 3.10.1900)\n\n(Mitchell and Kenyon 26: Pilkington Glass Works, St. Helen's 3.10.1900)\n\n(Mitchell and Kenyon 39: Ormerod's Mill, Great Moor Street, Bolton) 1900?\n\n(Mitchell and Kenyon 43: Brooks & Doxey, 7/1901)\n\n(Mitchell and Kenyon 35: Armstrong's Elswick Works, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne) 1900?\n\n(Mitchell and Kenyon 109: Newcastle United Vs. Liverpool No. 1) 1900?\n\n(Mitchell and Kenyon 110: Newcastle United Vs. Liverpool No. 2) 1900?\n\nFUORI QUADRO\n\nL'eruzione dell'Etna (IT 1909), PC: Ambrosio. Tinted and toned, Lobster Films\n\nTremblement de terre en Italie (? 1905), Lobster Films\n\nVIDEO SHOWS\n\nChomón (ES 2001), D: M. Dolors Genovès. One of the best documentaries on silent cinema ever, a fascinating story of Segundo de Chomón, one of cinema's first masters of animation, cinematography, special effects, pyrotechnics, and fantasy. Covers film history from Pathé to Napoléon with lots of juicy excerpts. ****\n\nCLOSING GALA\n\nThe most ambitious event in the Festival's history was a fitting way to celebrate its 20 glorious years.\n\nNapoléon vu par Abel Gance (FR 1927). Restored by Kevin Brownlow / Photoplay, music compiled, composed and directed by Carl Davis. The latest restored print was shown for the first time as a special all day spectacle in Teatro Nuovo Giovanni da Udine. What was new in it? Better pictorial quality, and especially better tinting. And real polyvision via three projectors. A steam train took the audience from Sacile to Udine and back. Departure: at 12.25 pm. Return: at 1.00 am.\n\nThis was the best experience I have had of the film. The fine-editing of the film brings new charms to it. The extremely difficult tinting is uniquely successful (tinting nowadays almost always fails, which is why I prefer straight black-and-white to most modern tinting). I belong to the defenders of Carl Davis: lifting bodily large chunks from Beethoven is absolutely justified in this film. Beethoven is evidently the Napoleon composer, and why settle for anything less? Most importantly, all the efforts in restoration and music serves to bring Abel Gance's vision alive for modern audiences. It's still one of the most breathtaking films of all times, a magnificent combination of epic and intimacy, of terror and comedy. It's almost impossible to make a successful film (or novel, or play) of a great modern historical figure as the protagonist. Abel Gance succeeded in showing the bravado, the vision, the weakness and the vulnerability of Napoleon. ****"
