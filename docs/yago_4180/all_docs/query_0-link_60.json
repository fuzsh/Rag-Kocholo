        "text": "Though festivals and distributors were very excited to sell you a “final” film by Jean-Luc Godard, Fabrice Aragno made clear Phony Wars would not be the last transmission. Continuing Tupac-like beyond-the-grave releases, it’s been announced this year’s Cannes Film Festival will include in their “Events” sidebar the “ultimate film by Jean-Luc Godard,” Scenarios, which I cannot possibly summarize better than their official description and thus:\n\nScenarios is the title that Jean-Luc Godard chose to give to a final 18-minute gesture, made, literally, the day before his voluntary death. Furthermore, Jean-Luc Godard recorded a 34-minute film in which, mixing still images and moving images, halfway between reading and vision, he presented the Scenarios project .\n\nWorth noting that Scenario was, with Phony Wars, one of two films with which Godard planned to end his career. A project made with single-digit hours left on Earth… well, one’s mind reels at the potential. Making maybe less-substantial the rest of this lineup of “Events,” “Documentaries,” and “Restored Copies,” which is nevertheless impressive. Tsui Hark’s Shanghai Blues, Sembène’s Camp de Thiaroye, Bresson’s Four Nights of a Dreamer, Wiseman’s Law and Order (restored “in association with Steven Spielberg”?), and the latter’s own Sugarland Express will screen in newly refurbished editions. Note, too, the first part of Abel Gance’s Napoleon, on which a massive restoration has been underway, will screen at a measly 220 minutes.\n\nSee the full lineup below:\n\nEvents\n\n100 years of Columbia\n\nGILDA\n\nCharles Vidor\n\n1946, 1h50, United States\n\nA Sony Pictures Entertainment presentation.
