        "text": "Napoleon is a 1975 epic biographical film directed by Stanley Kubrick. It stars Jean-Pierre Leaud and David Hemmings as the younger and older Napoleon respectively and follows the title figure from his humble beginnings on Corsica, through to his death on Elba.\n\nKubrick planned Napoleon after the success of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). He worked extensively on the film's research, watching every movie made on the subject, including Abel Gance's silent film series of the same name, read every book he could find, hired out 50,000 Romanian soldiers, and even took samples of dirt from battlefields to find similar shooting locations. Kubrick pioneered several techniques, including a sensitive camera that could shoot in low lighting, allowing scenes shot only with candle light.\n\nThe film was a critical and commercial success and is commonly called one of the greatest films ever made."
