Unless otherwise indicated, all dollar amounts in this AIF are expressed in US dollars. Our consolidated financial statements and MD&A, Management Proxy Circular and 2007 Financial Review are filed with Canadian and US regulatory authorities. These documents are available at www.sedar.com under the Companys name. A copy of the 2008 Management Proxy Circular and the 2007 Financial Review are available upon request.\n\nDate of Information\n\nAll information in this AIF is as of December 31, 2007, unless otherwise indicated.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nCertain statements and information in this AIF, including all statements that are not historical facts, contain forward-looking statements and forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable US and Canadian securities laws. Such forward-looking statements or information include, but are not limited to, statements or information with respect to financial disclosure, the future price of gold, estimation of mineral reserves and exploration and development capital requirements, and our goals and strategies. Often, these statements include words such as plans, expects or does not expect, is expected, budget, scheduled, estimates, forecasts, intends, anticipates or does not anticipate or believes or variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results may, could, would, might or will be taken, occur or be achieved.\n\nWith respect to forward-looking statements and nformation included in this AIF, we have made numerous assumptions including among other things, assumptions about the price of gold, anticipated costs and expenditures and our ability to achieve our goals. Even though our management believes that the assumptions made and the expectations represented by such statements or information are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the forward looking statement will prove to be accurate. By their nature, forward-looking statements and information are based on assumptions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking information. Such risks, uncertainties and other factors include among other things the following: gold price volatility; discrepancies between actual and estimated production and mineral reserves and resources; the speculative nature of gold exploration; mining operational and development risk; community and non-governmental actions and regulatory risks.\n\nSee this AIF and our quarterly and annual MD&A for additional information on risks, uncertainties and other factors relating to the forward-looking statements and information. Although we have attempted to identify factors that would cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those disclosed in the forward-looking statements or information, there may be other factors that cause actual results, performances, achievements or events not to be anticipated, estimated or intended. Also, many of the factors are beyond our control. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements or information. We undertake no obligation to reissue or update forward-looking statements or information as a result of new information or events after the date of this AIF except as may be required by law. All forward-looking statements and information made in this document are qualified by this cautionary statement.\n\n5\n\nThe terms mineral reserve, proven mineral reserve and probable mineral reserve are Canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with National Instrument 43-101  Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (NI 43-101) under the guidelines set out in the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the CIM) CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council as may be amended from time to time by the CIM.\n\nThe definitions of proven and probable reserves used in NI 43-101 differ from the definitions in the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") Industry Guide 7. Under SEC Industry Guide 7 standards, a \"Final\" or \"Bankable\" feasibility study is required to report reserves, the three-year history average price is used in any reserve or cash flow analysis to designate reserves and the primary environmental analysis or report must be filed with the appropriate governmental authority.\n\nIn addition, the terms \"mineral resource\", \"measured mineral resource\", \"indicated mineral resource\" and \"inferred mineral resource\" are defined in and required to be disclosed by NI 43-101; however, these terms are not defined terms under SEC Industry Guide 7 and normally are not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into reserves. \"Inferred mineral resources\" have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or prefeasibility studies, except in rare cases.\n\nAccordingly, information contained in this report and the documents incorporated by reference herein containing descriptions of our mineral deposits may not be comparable to similar information made public by US companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements under US federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\n\nELDORADO GOLD CORPORATION\n\nCORPORATE STRUCTURE\n\nWe were incorporated by Memorandum of Association on April 2, 1992 under the Companies Act (Bermuda) under the name Eldorado Corporation Ltd. On April 23, 1996, Eldorado was continued under the Company Act (British Columbia) and changed its name to Eldorado Gold Corporation. On June 28, 1996, Eldorado was continued under the Canada Business Corporations Act. On November 19, 1996, pursuant to a plan of arrangement, Eldorado and HRC Development Corporation were amalgamated under the laws of Canada under the name \"Eldorado Gold Corporation\".\n\nOur head office is located at Suite 1188  550 Burrard Street, Vancouver BC, Canada, V6C 2B5. The Company, through its subsidiaries, also maintains offices in:\n\nAnkara, Turkey\n\nUşak, Turkey\n\nIzmir, Turkey\n\nBeijing, China\n\nXining, China\n\nHaixi District, China\n\nSanta Barbara, Brazil\n\nBelo Horizonte, Brazil\n\n6\n\nOur registered and records office and address for service is care of our solicitors, Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP, Suite 2900 – 550 Burrard Street, Vancouver, BC, Canada V6C 0A3.\n\nOur mining operations, the Kisladag Mine (Kisladag or the Kisladag mine) and the Tanjianshan Mine (Tanjianshan or the Tanjianshan mine) and our development projects, Efemçukuru (Efemçukuru or the Efemçukuru project) and Vila Nova (the Vila Nova Iron Ore Project or Vila Nova) are each managed by a general manager as decentralized business units. We centrally manage exploration and acquisition strategies, corporate financing, global tax planning and metal and currency risk management programs at our head office in Vancouver. Our risk management program is developed by senior management and monitored by the Board of Directors.\n\nOur material assets are owned through ten subsidiaries, as shown on the organizational chart below.\n\nBUSINESS OF THE COMPANY\n\nWe are engaged in the production of, development of and exploration for gold and other minerals. We are also engaged in the acquisition of mineral resource properties. Our business is presently focused in Brazil, Turkey and China.\n\nWe produce gold through the mining and processing of ore. As of December 31, 2007, we had two operating mines: the 100 percent owned Kisladag mine located near Uşak, Turkey; and the 90 percent owned Tanjianshan mine located in Qinghai Province, China. The São Bento Mine ceased mining operations in the January 2007.\n\nOur growth strategy is to actively pursue opportunities by discovering new projects through grassroots exploration and acquiring advanced exploration, development or low cost production assets with the potential for increased resources. At any given time, discussions and activities with respect to these\n\n7\n\nactivities can be in process, each at different stages of due diligence. We may be currently engaged in discussions with respect to such opportunities, but have no binding agreements or commitments to enter into any transactions and there is no assurance that any potential transactions will be successfully completed.\n\nA description of our business, including a description of how the business developed over the past three years is set out below under Description of the Business and under Finance.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS\n\nSUMMARY REVIEW\n\nProduction and Operation\n\nThe following table summarizes our total production and operating information for the year ended December 31, 2007:\n\nFirst\n\nQuarter\n\n2007\n\nSecond\n\nQuarter\n\n2007\n\nThird\n\nQuarter\n\n2007\n\nFourth\n\nQuarter\n\n2007\n\nFourth\n\nQuarter\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2006\n\nGold Production\n\nTotal Ounces Produced\n\n88,780\n\n98,970\n\n61,385\n\n32,000\n\n50,425\n\n281,135\n\n135,653\n\nCommercial Production\n\n76,288\n\n98,970\n\n61,385\n\n32,000\n\n50,425\n\n268,643\n\n135,653\n\nCash Operating Cost ($/oz)4\n\n220\n\n259\n\n228\n\n216\n\n274\n\n236\n\n324\n\nTotal Cash Cost ($/oz)2,4\n\n233\n\n287\n\n264\n\n262\n\n278\n\n263\n\n330\n\nTotal Production Cost ($/oz)3,4\n\n270\n\n332\n\n335\n\n522\n\n259\n\n318\n\n343\n\nRealized Price ($/oz - sold)\n\n647\n\n664\n\n667\n\n774\n\n615\n\n674\n\n609\n\nKisladag Mine, Turkey\n\nCommercial Production\n\n43,601\n\n68,095\n\n23,610\n\n-\n\n36,546\n\n135,306\n\n70,895\n\nTonnes to Pad\n\n1,849,330\n\n1,872,691\n\n825,839\n\n-\n\n1,882,744\n\n4,547,860\n\n5,178,268\n\nGrade (grams / tonne)\n\n1.27\n\n1.32\n\n1.52\n\n-\n\n1.23\n\n1.33\n\n1.18\n\nCash Operating Cost ($/oz)4\n\n192\n\n187\n\n191\n\n-\n\n191\n\n189\n\n206\n\nTotal Cash Cost ($/oz)2,4\n\n194\n\n190\n\n194\n\n-\n\n193\n\n192\n\n208\n\nTotal Production Cost ($/oz)3,4\n\n225\n\n221\n\n234\n\n-\n\n185\n\n225\n\n229\n\nTanjianshan Mine, China5\n\nTotal Ounces Produced\n\n39,252\n\n29,135\n\n37,775\n\n32,000\n\nn/a\n\n138,162\n\nn/a\n\nCommercial Production\n\n26,760\n\n29,135\n\n37,775\n\n32,000\n\nn/a\n\n125,670\n\nn/a\n\nTonnes Milled\n\n142,859\n\n237,909\n\n202,641\n\n173,945\n\nn/a\n\n757,354\n\nn/a\n\nGrade (grams / tonne)\n\n7.17\n\n4.41\n\n6.87\n\n7.20\n\nn/a\n\n6.23\n\nn/a\n\nCash Operating Cost ($/oz)4\n\n260\n\n440\n\n251\n\n216\n\nn/a\n\n288\n\nn/a\n\nTotal Cash Cost ($/oz)2,4\n\n291\n\n522\n\n307\n\n261\n\nn/a\n\n342\n\nn/a\n\nTotal Production Cost ($/oz)3,4\n\n356\n\n616\n\n397\n\n355\n\nn/a\n\n428\n\nn/a\n\nSão Bento Mine, Brazil\n\nCommercial Production\n\n5,927\n\n1,740\n\n-\n\n-\n\n13,879\n\n7,667\n\n64,758\n\nTonnes Milled\n\n20,069\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n69,295\n\n20,069\n\n334,814\n\nGrade (grams / tonne)\n\n8.88\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n6.06\n\n11.71\n\n6.71\n\nCash Operating Cost ($/oz)4\n\n245\n\n80\n\n-\n\n-\n\n492\n\n208\n\n454\n\nTotal Cash Cost ($/oz)2,4\n\n252\n\n132\n\n-\n\n-\n\n502\n\n224\n\n464\n\nTotal Production Cost ($/oz)3,4\n\n211\n\n(50)\n\n-\n\n-\n\n455\n\n152\n\n467\n\n1\n\nCost figures calculated in accordance with the Gold Institute Standard.\n\n2\n\nCash Operating Costs, plus royalties and the cost of off-site administration.\n\n3\n\nTotal Cash Costs, plus foreign exchange gain or loss, depreciation, amortization and reclamation expenses.\n\n4\n\nCash operating, total cash and total production costs are non-GAAP measures.

All reserves are calculated as of December 31, 2007 in accordance with NI 43-101 and CIM. Reserves for Kisladag, Efemçukuru and Tanjianshan are based on a gold price of $600. Iron ore reserves for Vila Nova are based on a price of $76 per dry metric ton.\n\nThe cut-off grades for the gold deposits are based on assumptions for plant recovery, gold value, mining dilution and recovery, along with operating and capital cost projections that are based on historical production figures. We may need to recalculate estimated reserves and resources based on actual production or exploration results. Changes in metal prices, increased production costs or changes in the recovery rate may make it unprofitable to develop the proven and probable reserves at a particular property or for a specific mine.\n\n2008 Proven and Probable Reserves\n\nEldorado Gold Mineral Reserves, December 31, 2007\n\nProject\n\nReserve Classification\n\nTonnes\n\n(x1000)\n\nGrade\n\n(Au g/t or Fe %)\n\nIn-situ Gold ounces\n\n(x1000)\n\nGold\n\nKisladag\n\nProven\n\n67,930\n\n1.11\n\n2,424\n\nProbable\n\n85,400\n\n1.12\n\n3,076\n\nProven + Probable\n\n153,330\n\n1.12\n\n5,500\n\nTanjianshan\n\nProven\n\n5,020\n\n3.88\n\n626\n\nProbable\n\n2,322\n\n4.13\n\n308\n\nProven + Probable\n\n7,342\n\n3.96\n\n934\n\nEfemçukuru\n\nProven\n\n1,320\n\n11.89\n\n505\n\nProbable\n\n2,465\n\n9.04\n\n716\n\nProven + Probable\n\n3,785\n\n10.04\n\n1,221\n\nTotal\n\nProven\n\n74,270\n\n1.49\n\n3,555\n\nProbable\n\n90,187\n\n1.41\n\n4,100\n\nProven + Probable\n\n164,457\n\n1.45\n\n7,655\n\nIron\n\nVila Nova\n\nProven\n\n2,285\n\n63.5\n\nProbable\n\n6,987\n\n60.2\n\nProven + Probable\n\n9,272\n\n61.0\n\nNotes:\n\n1)\n\nGold price used was $600/oz.\n\n2\n\nCut-off grades (gold g/t): Kisladag: 0.35 g/t oxide, 0.50 g/t sulphide; Tanjianshan: 1.3 g/t QLT and JLG oxide, 1.64 g/t JLG sulphide; Efemçukuru: 4.5 g/t\n\n3\n\nThe Mineral Reserves are inclusive to the Mineral Resources\n\n9\n\n4)\n\nReserves for Tanjianshan represent 100% of which we control 90 percent\n\n5)\n\nReserves for Vila Nova represent 100% of which we control 75 percent\n\nReconciliation of Reserves\n\nThe following table reconciles Eldorados mineral reserves after taking into account gold production for 2007:\n\nNotes:\n\n1)\n\nThe Sao Bento Mine ceased mining operations in January 2007\n\nThe following table presents the measured, indicated and inferred mineral resources for Kisladag, Tanjianshan, Efemçukuru and Vila Nova.

A substantial mining industry supported by well-developed infrastructure exists throughout the country. Mineral production is dominated by the industrial and base metal sectors, operated by both domestic and foreign mining companies.\n\nKisladag\n\nThe Kisladag mine in Uşak Province, Turkey, began commercial production on July 1, 2006.\n\nProperty Description\n\nThe Kisladag land position consists of one operating licence (number IR 7302) and a total area of 15,717 hectares. Mineral licences are granted indefinitely, assuming licence fees are paid in a timely manner.\n\nOwnership Interest\n\nWe own a 100 percent interest in Kisladag through our wholly owned Turkish subsidiary Tüprag Metal Madencilik Sanayi Ve Ticaret Limited Sirketi (Tüprag).\n\nLocation, Climate and Access\n\nKisladag is located in western Turkey in Uşak Province, 35 kilometers southwest of the city of Uşak and 180 kilometers from the Aegean port city of Izmir. The project sits on the western edge of the Anatolian Plateau, in gentle rolling topography, at an elevation of approximately 1,000 meters. The climate is arid with hot summers and cold winters. Annual rainfall is around 425 millimeters, occurring mainly from November to March. Economic activity in the area consists of a mixture of subsistence farming and grazing. All-season access to Kisladag is provided by paved highways and roads\n\n12\n\n.\n\nAcquisition\n\nKisladag is a greenfields discovery of the Company. We began in-depth exploration work in 1997 based on preliminary stream sediment analysis.\n\nGeology and Mineralization\n\nKisladag is located in one of several mid- to late-Tertiary volcanic complexes in western Turkey, related to subduction along the Hellenic Trench southwest of Turkey. In the Kisladag region, the volcanoes erupted onto a basement of schist at the northeast margin of the Menderes Massif.\n\nGold mineralization at Kisladag is hosted by a number of latitic intrusive bodies. Our exploration has outlined two alteration zones. The Gökgöz Tepe alteration zone covers approximately 12 square kilometers. At Gökgöz, a coarsely porphyritic latite is host to the bulk of the gold mineralization and has undergone extensive and intensive hydrothermal alteration. An early potassic phase of alteration has been recognized, which is overprinted by later quartz-tourmaline and advanced argillic alteration. Gold mineralization forms an annular zone around a later weakly mineralized stock of similar composition. Gold is associated with multiple phases of tourmaline-pyrite, pyrite and quartz-pyrite veining and brecciation and is accompanied by small amounts of base metals, principally zinc and molybdenum. Oxidation in the deposit is shallow over the barren intrusive but extends to depths of 40 to 50 meters to the west and east. Limonite is the most abundant oxide mineral, usually occurring along fractures in thin colloform layers and in disseminated patches around weathered pyrite.\n\nThe Sayacik alteration zone is located six kilometers southwest of Gökgöz Tepe and covers approximately six square kilometers. Moderate to strong silicification occurs for approximately 1.5 kilometers in andesitic tuffs. Quartz barite veinlets cutting the tuff contain up to 100 parts per million silver in grab samples.\n\nData Verification\n\nMicon International (Micon) reviewed the original data used to prepare the Kisladag resource and reserve statements. Micon carried out two site visits to review the QA/QC procedures during drilling, sampling and sample preparation. Micons opinions are based on information in technical reports prepared by Kilborn Engineering Pacific Limited (Kilborn) or us. The Kisladag Mine continues to run a comprehensive QA/QC program that includes assaying for standards, blanks and assay re-runs.\n\nPrevious Exploration\n\nSince beginning exploration at Kisladag in 1996 we have focused our exploration activities primarily on the zone known locally as Gökgöz Tepe. On the basis of early exploration we identified a gold anomaly along the north slope of Gökgöz Tepe extending approximately 1,200 meters on strike by 600 meters wide. Drill programs followed in 1997 and 1998 and effectively confirmed the potential for a low grade bulk tonnage gold deposit. In 1999 Micon and Eldorado identified a measured and indicated resource of 42.8 million tonnes at 1.49 g/t, plus an inferred resource of 31.1 million tonnes at 1.35 g/t (all based on a 0.8 g/t cut-off grade). Following a reverse circulation drill program in 2000 Micon reported a significant increase in the measured and indicated resource to 125.97 million tonnes at an average grade of 1.20 g/t gold, and a revised estimate of 4.85 million ounces of contained gold in oxides and primary ore (using a cut-off grade of 0.4 g/t gold). Metallurgical testwork indicated that the ore would be amenable to heap leaching. We were granted a Site Selection Permit in 1999 by the Turkish authorities for a gold mining operation at Kisladag. Kilborn was commissioned in 2001 to undertake a Prefeasibility Study. The initial capital cost was estimated to be $47.4 million with a cash operating cost estimated at $154 per ounce and an average annual gold production of 103,600 troy ounces. In December 2001, an Addendum to the Prefeasibility Study presented a revised initial capital cost estimate of $29.6 million and a cash operating cost estimate of $149 per ounce in consideration of the devaluation of the Turkish currency and to incorporate the option of contracting the mining operation and utilizing used crushing equipment.\n\n13\n\nMicon audited our procedures for sample collection, sample preparation and security of samples. Sample assaying is carried out by ALS Chemex in Vancouver, BC, Canada. ALS Chemex has attained ISO 9002 Registration by KPMG Quality Registrars for providing assay and geochemical analytical services. A routine of check assay duplicates and standards has been followed for all assay work completed.\n\nFor a detailed discussion of exploration activities conducted at Kisladag, including sampling and analysis, see the Kisladag Reports listed below and on page 16 of this AIF that are available under the Companys name at www.sedar.com.\n\nDevelopment Activities\n\nSince acquiring Kisladag in 1997, we have advanced this property through various stages of exploration and development to production. The following is a record of the developments and related technical reports.\n\n2000\n\nCompleted Scoping Study\n\nMay 2001\n\nCompleted Prefeasibility Study\n\nNovember 2001\n\nCompleted Addendum Report to the Prefeasibility Study\n\nMay 2002\n\nCompleted Updated Reserve Report,\n\nMarch 2003\n\nCompleted Feasibility Study\n\nMay 2004\n\nCompleted Feasibility Cost Update.\n\n2003\n\nReceived Environmental Positive Certificate\n\n2003\n\nReceived Establishment Permit\n\nMarch 2003\n\nCompleted Hatch Feasibility Study\n\nJuly 2003\n\nCompleted Optimization Study\n\n2004\n\nIn April 2004, we acquired all the necessary public and private land, updated the Feasibility Study to reflect 2004 projected costs, completed the permitting process and obtained all approvals from the Turkish authorities for constructing Kisladag, began installing site services and completing two process water wells. In December 2004, we began earthwork excavation for constructing the first phase of the leach pad.\n\nIn May 2004, we completed a Feasibility Cost Update to the Feasibility Study of March 2003. The Feasibility Cost Update included an updated review of the elements contributing to the operating and capital cost structure of Kisladag, and specifically included the addition of the Value Added Tax (VAT) in Turkey to the costs of goods and services used in constructing and operating the project. The Feasibility Cost Update also accounted for the increased costs of construction and operating materials such as concrete, steel and fuel.\n\n14\n\nIn July 2004, the Government of Turkey passed two major pieces of legislation. The Turkish VAT Law was amended to exempt the gold mining industry from paying VAT on their activities, including exploration, construction, purchase of equipment, mine operation, smelting and refining. The amendment positively impacted Kisladag, with the initial capital investment decreasing by $10.7 million and cash operating costs decreasing by $23 per ounce to $165 per ounce. In addition, the Mining Law consolidated the activity of all sectors of the industry, including hard rock, soft rock and industrial minerals mining, as well as quarrying and aggregate industries. The amendments included the following: access to lands previously restricted from mining activities is now possible through a general regulation of the Council of Ministers; fund fees of 5 percent on capital installations on certain forest lease lands no longer apply; Expropriation Law No. 2942, which governs the procedure to acquire land critical to fulfillment of investment, now applies to mining activities; and finally, a royalty on ore processed off-site must be paid to the State for mining activities (amounting to 2 percent of the sales value of the ore mined) and a royalty on ore processed on-site is reduced to 1 percent.\n\nIn September 2004, we received the final permit for Kisladag and began site activities. The initial capital cost for construction was $83.4 million. Life of mine (14 years) cash operating cost was $165 per ounce, based on $4.12 per tonne of ore processed.\n\nConstruction\n\nConstruction of Kisladag was completed in 2006. The first phase included the bulk of the infrastructure, equipment and earthworks required to process both oxide and primary ore during the first year of operation. Mechanical completion of the process and ancillary facilities was completed in mid-2006, followed by commissioning and start-up. Total capital costs for Phase I were $83.0 million. The second phase completed in 2007, expanded the crushing circuit, leach pad expansion and equipment maintenance facilities to increase production throughput to the final design capacity of 10 million tonnes annually. There will also be minor subsequent construction phases associated with expanding the heap leach pad and closing the project.\n\nRecent Developments\n\nOn July 1, 2006, the Kisladag Mine officially began commercial production.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2007, we expanded the crushing and screening system at Kisladag as part of the Phase 2 expansion project aimed at doubling the production rate of the plant to 10 million tonnes per year. The secondary/tertiary crushing circuit was shut down for one month to install the necessary components, which included installing a new larger secondary crusher and an additional tertiary crusher. During the shutdown period, the primary crusher continued to provide coarse crush material for truck haul to the leach pads. The Phase 2 crushers were operating successfully at the time of the court-imposed shutdown in August.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2007, we were granted access to the lands required for constructing additional process pond capacity, the permanent storm water pond and the second phase of the leach pad installation. We completed construction of the ponds and associated piping prior to the mine shutdown in August.\n\nOn July 19, 2007 the Turkish Ministry of Environment (MOE) received official notification from the Sixth Department of Council of State ordering the shut down of the Kisladag mine within 30 days. The ordered shut down was issued pending the ultimate decision by the High Administrative court on the appeal of a lower court order in favour of the Company confirming the legality and validity of the Mines Environmental Impact Assessment. The closure was implemented on August. Such order is in the nature of an interim injunction issued by the Appellate Court, pending a decision on the case. The closure of occurred on August 18, 2007.\n\nThe leach pad expansion project was scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter; however, construction was terminated at the end of October under the agreement with the Usak Governors office regarding the forced closure of the mine. The work is approximately 75% completed.\n\n15\n\nOur 2007 infill drill program, totalling 11,925m in 36 holes, discovered new areas of gold mineralization, including a new high grade deep zone. The drilling focussed on insufficiently tested areas of the deposit, mainly to the west and south. Many holes drilled in this region ended in gold mineralization, leaving the deposit still open to the west and southwest, and at depth. Much of this new mineralization lies in the Inferred resource category and will be the focus of future drill programs.\n\nThe impact of the newly discovered gold mineralization was analyzed by running open pit scenarios at various gold prices, incorporating all mineral resource categories. The economic pit outline corresponding to a gold price of $850 markedly expanded to incorporate most of the new resources. These findings validate the inclusion of these blocks in the mineral resource category and demonstrates the growth potential of the Kisladag mine.\n\nOn March 6, 2008 the Kisladag mine re-opened and production activities resumed. The decision rendered by the Sixth Department of the High Administrative Court in Ankara, Turkey on February 6, 2008 and the actions taken by the related government offices allowed the resumption of all production activities at the Kisladag mine.\n\nProjected Production\n\nA mine production rate of 5 million tonnes per year (mtpa) of ore was set for the first year of the Kisladag mines life. Annual ore production is projected to increase to 10 mtpa in 2008, remaining at that level until the end of mine life. The highest daily mining rate is expected to occur in 2014 totaling 71,000 tpd (ore plus waste). Total quantities of ore and waste are projected to be 153 million tonnes and 147 million tonnes (respectively) over the mine life. The overall strip ratio is projected to be 0.96:1. The current mining contractor will continue to operate in the pit until the second half of 2008. In April, 2008 we expect to begin phasing in our own mining fleet (at an estimated cost of $30 million) and mine workforce for completing the project. A gold recovery of 81 percent is projected for the oxide ore. The primary ore has a higher sulphide content and gold recovery is projected to be 60 percent. The ore will require a crush size of 80 percent passing 6.3 mm and a leach period of 90 days.\n\nThe Kisladag ore is processed in a standard heap leach facility containing a three-stage crushing circuit, an overland conveyor to the heap leach pad, mobile conveyors and a stacker for placing the ore and a carbon adsorption facility (ADR plant) for recovering the gold. The carbon is treated on-site in a refinery and the final mine product is gold doré bar. The total gold production in 2008 is projected to be 190,000 ounces at an average cost of $222/oz. Projected production per year for the balance of mine life is 240,000.\n\nPersonnel\n\nThe project employs 356 people, with the majority of workers drawn from the local region. Infrastructure to support the mine includes an access road, a water well field with a 13- kilometer water pipeline and a 30-kilometer power transmission line. Supplies and services are accessed from the city of Uşak, 35 kilometers to the north.\n\n16\n\nLitigation\n\nLitigation by certain third parties continues against Tüprag and the MOE seeking to cancel the Environmental Positive Certificate for Kisladag on the basis of alleged threats to the environment and deficiencies in the EIA.\n\nIn 2007, a judgment on the litigation at a lower administrative court was in our favour. The plaintiff appealed that decision and as a result of the appeal on July 19, 2007 the Sixth Department of Council of State ordered the shutdown of the Kisladag mine pending a decision on the case.\n\nOn August 18, 2007, mining operations were shut down except those activities approved by the Turkish authorities related to sound environmental practices. The mine remained closed during the rest of 2007.\n\nOn February 6, 2008 a decision was rendered by the Sixth Department of the High Administrative Court in Ankara concluding that the existing expert reports prepared for the Lower Administrative Court were insufficient to make either a positive or negative decision on the merits of the case. The case has been returned to the Lower Administrative Court where it is most probable that a new expert committee will be assigned to review the case. The temporary injunction automatically expired with the decision on the case. The Company obtained the necessary permits from the Turkish governmental authorities and on March 6, 2008 the Kisladag mine reopened and resumed production activities.\n\nWe are confident in both the methodology of the EIA Report and Tüprags compliance with all procedural steps taken in obtaining the Environmental Positive Certificate. We continue to believe that we will successfully defend this litigation. If we are unsuccessful in defending this litigation, our ability to conduct mining operations at Kisladag may be adversely affected, which may adversely affect production and revenue from Kisladag.\n\nKisladag Reports\n\nKisladag is the subject of the following independent reports (the Kisladag Reports): Estimation of Resources, Kisladag Project, Turkey (October 1999), “Addendum to October 1999 Report titled Estimation of Resources, Kisladag Project” (May 15, 2000) and “Update of Resources, Kisladag Project, Uşak, Turkey” (October 2000 and amended November 2000 and January 2001), all prepared by Micon International; Kisladag Gold Project Pre-Feasibility Study (May 2001) and Kisladag Gold Project Pre-Feasibility Study Addendum (December 2001), prepared by Kilborn Engineering Pacific; Updated Reserve Report for the Kisladag Gold Project Western Turkey (April 18, 2002 and revised May 9, 2002), prepared by Micon International; and a Feasibility Study (March 2003), the Kisladag Optimization Study (July 2003) and the Feasibility Cost Update (May 2004), all prepared by Hatch. The Kisladag Reports are available at www.sedar.com under our name, and they should be reviewed to put the preceding discussion in context.\n\nFinancing\n\nIn April 2005, HSBC Bank USA, National Association (HSBC) authorized advances of up to $65 million to Tuprag under the terms of a term revolving credit facility due February 28, 2010 (the Credit Facility). As at December 31, 2006, HSBC had advanced $50 million. The Credit Facility can be drawn down in minimum tranches of $1 million plus multiples of $0.25 million. Each drawdown bears interest fixed at the prevailing LIBOR plus 0.50% on the date each tranche is drawn down. As at December 31, 2007, the Company has drawn $55 million in six tranches at a weighted average interest rate of 5.52%. Each tranche typically has a maturity of approximately 13 months. The Credit Facility is renewable at the Companys option for the term of the loan. At December 31, 2007, $10 million remained available under the Revolving Credit Facility. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, Eldorado is required to fully collateralize any HSBC advances to Tuprag with funds of an equal amount deposited on account with HSBC.\n\n17\n\nEfemçukuru\n\nEfemçukuru is located in Izmir Province, and is our primary development project in Turkey.\n\nOwnership Interest\n\nWe own a 100 percent interest in Efemçukuru through our subsidiaries. Efemçukuru consists of two pre-operation licences covering 3,072 hectares.\n\nLocation, Climate and Access\n\nEfemçukuru is located in Izmir Province near the coast of western Turkey, approximately 20 kilometers from the provincial capital of Izmir. The nearest settlement, the village of Efemçukuru (population 500), is located two kilometers to the south. The project is located in hilly terrain at an elevation of 520 to 760 meters. Access to Efemçukuru is provided by various paved and unpaved roads connecting the village with other local population centres.\n\nPower will be provided to the site via a dedicated transmission line from the Urla substation approximately 20 kilometers away. Mine infrastructure will include administration buildings, the concentrator, filtration plant, tailings and waste rock impound areas. Concentrate treatment will be carried out at the Kisladag mine.\n\nEfemçukuru is situated within the Aegean climatic zone, which is characterized by hot and dry summers and warm and rainy winters with limited snowfall. Temperatures in the region range between 30ºC in summer and 0ºC in winter with an annual average of approximately 17ºC. Average annual precipitation is 750 mm due to the moderating influence of the Aegean Sea.\n\nGeology and Mineralization\n\nGold mineralization is hosted by the 1,800 meter Kestane Beleni Vein, which contains the present resource, and the less explored Kokarpinar Vein, which is 2,500 meters in length. Both strike southeasterly (160°E), dip 60°E to 70°E northeast and postdate the emplacement of rhyolitic dikes, although the veins may follow dike-occupied fracture zones for short distances.\n\nMineralization occurs as open space fillings. Multi-stage breccia, quartz carbonate veinlets, cockade and laminated textures are common. Non-metallic host rock minerals include quartz, rhodonite and rhodochrosite. Associated sulphides include pyrite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite and galena, and their oxidized products. Most of the gold is very fine (2.5 to 50 microns), occurring as free grains in quartz and carbonate, and as inclusions in sulphide minerals. Lower grade stockwork mineralization occurs locally between ore shoots, and is relatively abundant in the hanging wall irrespective of rock type. Such stockworks are not common in the footwall.\n\nData Verification\n\nPrimary assaying up to 1997 was completed at SGS laboratories in Canada and France and check assays were done at Chemex and Bondar-Clegg laboratories in Vancouver, Canada. Holes KV-1 through KV-26 were fire-assayed at SGS-Xral in Toronto, Canada and holes KV-27 through KV-108 were fire assayed at the SGS laboratory in Carcassonne, France. The initial fire-assay was done on a 1 assay-ton charge with an atomic absorption (AA) finish. Over-range samples (>10 ppm Au) were re-assayed with a gravimetric finish.\n\nBesides gold, multi-element analyses, including silver were completed on approximately 75% of the samples from drill holes KV-01 to KV-43, and on 35% of the samples from drill holes KV-44 to KV-95.\n\nSample pulps from the 2006-2007 drilling program were sent from the Çanakkale sample preparation facility to ALS Chemex Laboratories (Chemex) sample preparation facility in Izmir and were then shipped under the supervision of Chemex to their analytical laboratory in North Vancouver. All samples were assayed for gold by 30 g fire assay with an AA finish and for multi-element determination using fusion digest and inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP) analysis.\n\n18\n\nSamples that returned assays greater than 5 g/t were re-assayed by fire assay with a gravimetric finish. During the latest program, all samples greater than 5 g/t and less than 10 g/t Au from the pre-109 holes were re-assayed also. All geological and assay data for the project is stored in a database program developed by Maxwell Geoservices.\n\nAs a test of assay data integrity, the data used to estimate the 2007 Efemçukuru mineral resource were verified against original source data. This process was implemented as part of database upgrading program with the installation of a Datashed system for the Efemçukuru project. Survey (collar and down hole) data and assay data were checked. Any discrepancies found were corrected prior to entry into the new database. Newer data entered directly into the database are periodically compared to original electronic certificates (assays) and down hole measurements and collar survey data. As a result, the data transferred for use in resource modelling are considered sufficiently free of error to be adequate for resource estimation of the Efemçukuru Project.\n\nPrevious Exploration\n\nThe target identified at Efemçukuru is a high-grade vein-hosted gold system. In 1997, we completed a drilling program along the north, middle and south ore shoots. A total of 4,092 meters of diamond drilling further delineated the initial identified resource of 660,000 ounces, which increased the resource to 1.1 million ounces contained in 2.52 million tonnes, at an average grade of 13.71 g/t. We reduced the drill hole pattern to approximately 50 by 35 meters and conducted additional diamond drilling for hydrogeological testing in the vein structure as well as the hanging wall and footwall rocks. Assay data from this program were incorporated into the database for the deposit.\n\nIn 1998, Micon evaluated the geological model and confirmed a measured and indicated resource of 1.87 million tonnes at 14.26 g/t, with an inferred resource of 660,000 tonnes at 11.99 g/t. Reserves of 784,000 ounces were established during an internal Prefeasibility Study completed in 1999. As these resource estimates were made according to Australasian classification before NI 43-101 came into effect, they may vary from estimates made in accordance with NI 43-101. The estimates are provided in connection with the discussions of previous exploration.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2006, limited work was completed after the prefeasibility study as we were focusing our efforts on the development of the Kisladag mine.\n\nWe have recently resumed exploration work on the property and are currently advancing the engineering and permitting requirements for construction of the project. Infill and exploratory drilling commenced again in August 2006 and has continued throughout 2007.\n\nDevelopment Activities\n\nDuring 2006, we initiated a drilling program at Efemçukuru designed to convert inferred resources into measured and indicated resources for the purpose of forming the basis of a new mine plan and subsequent reserve calculation and to test the potential of the system at depth. Land acquisition began in 2006, with 40% of the land acquired by December 31, 2006. We contracted Wardrop Engineering to conduct a feasibility study for the Efemçukuru project which was released in August 2007. The study defines an operation based on underground mining and milling of the ore on site with post treatment of gold concentrate at the Kisladag mine. The proposed mine at Efemçukuru will operate at a production rate of 1,100 tonnes per day, producing an average of 112,400 ounces of gold annually at a cash cost of $226 per ounce.\n\n19\n\nIn 2007 the drilling program at Efemçukuru largely targeted the South Ore Shoot and Transition Zone areas. The results more clearly defined the Middle Ore Shoot mineralization with the extension of the thick and gold-rich vein hosted mineralization and the recognition of near continuous stockwork gold mineralization enveloping the veins. This stockwork mineralization is predominant in the upper portions of the Middle Ore Shoot, and occurs between the main vein (defining the footwall to the system) and an upper or hanging wall vein, and in hanging wall units to the uppermost vein. Results from the South Ore Shoot holes extended the down plunge extent of the upper high grade lobe and confirmed the down plunge continuation of the lower lobe. Transition Zone and Middle Ore Shoot generally confirmed predicted thicknesses and level of gold mineralization in the areas tested. Our initial results from the North Ore Shoot drilling intersected a narrow vein interval and confirmed our earlier interpretation of a mid-grade gold zone in the North Ore Shoot. Drilling for the remainder of 2007 continued testing the North Ore Shoot, northern and southern extents of the Kestane Beleni vein, and the paralleling Kokarpinar veins.\n\nWardrop Engineering of Vancouver completed a Feasibility Study on the Efemçukuru project in August 2007. The study is based on a conventional underground mine operating plan using cut and fill and longhole mining methods and supported by a flotation/gravity recovery circuit located on site. Concentrate produced from the circuit will be treated at a dedicated cyanide leach plant located at our Kisladag mine. The results of the feasibility study indicate a proven and probable reserve of 1,221,000 gold ounces, mined over a 9.4 year period. Life of mine cash costs are $227 per ounce, and the probability of increasing the reserve base is considered high.\n\nFor a detailed discussion of exploration activities conducted at Efemçukuru, including sampling and analysis, see the Efemçukuru Report listed below and on page 21 of this AIF that is available under the Companys name at www.sedar.com.\n\nConstruction\n\nThe Company continues to complete the remaining land acquisition and permitting requirements with the objective to commence construction activities by the second quarter of 2008. An eighteen month construction schedule is envisaged for the project with initial production anticipated in the first quarter of 2010.\n\nAs of December 31, 2007 approximately 60% (43.1 hectares out of a total of 74.2 hectares) of the land has been purchased. The Company continues to work with villagers and government to acquire the balance of the land required for the project.\n\nPermitting\n\nThe process of obtaining the necessary permits for a mining operation in Turkey is similar to that in other developed countries.\n\nThe key Environmental Positive Certificate is issued by the MOE following a successful review of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Report. The permit contains agreed protocols between the proponent and Ministry for mitigation methods, monitoring standards, closure procedures and financial guarantees. The EIA was submitted and receipt of the Environmental Positive Certificate was received in September 2005.\n\nIn September 2003, the Turkish Ministry of Health released changes in regulations relating to the permitting of industrial activities which significantly reduce and simplify the remaining permitting requirements for the Efemçukuru Project which has benefitted subsequent mine permitting in Turkey. In 2004, we continued our preparation of the EIA, which we submitted to the Turkish MOE in 2005. We received the Environmental Positive Certificate in the third quarter of 2005, signalling the successful completion of the first stage of permitting for Efemçukuru. The remaining key permits required prior to start-up of the mine include the blasting and explosive permit and the trial operating permit. Permits that are required after startup and inspection include the opening permit, work place labour permit and air emission and discharge permit.\n\n20\n\nFollowing start-up of operations and demonstration of compliance with all received approvals and permits, the Operating Permit is then issued as the final stage of the permitting process.\n\nProjected Production\n\nA mine production rate of 420,000 tonnes per year has been set for the life of mine operation at Efemçukuru, based on an average daily mill throughput of 1,100 tonnes. The average head grade to the plant will be 10.0 g/ t Au. Combined with a forecast metallurgical recovery of 86.5%, gold production will average 112,400 ounces per year at an average mine life cash cost of $226 per ounce.\n\nThe Efemçukuru Project is a high grade underground mine operation. Mining will be done with conventional trackless equipment using mechanized cut and fill as well as longhole stoping methods. Ore will be processed through a milling and flotation concentrate circuit located at the project site. A gravity concentrate will be recovered and refined to doré on site while the flotation concentration is transported to a cyanide recovery circuit located at the Companys Kisladag Mine in Usak Province.\n\nRoyalties\n\nEldorado is required to pay 1% of the direct mine operating cost as a royalty to a third party. The average annual payment will be US$108,150 in a full production year. The total royalty included in this evaluation is US$1.03 million. This equates to US$0.27/t milled or US$0.97 per ounce produced.\n\nTaxes\n\nEconomic evaluation indicates a post-tax IRR of 19.0% and a post-tax NPV of US$86.7 million at a discount rate of 5.0%. The post-tax base case financial model used the same inputs as the pre-tax economic evaluation:\n\n·\n\n3 year average metal gold price of US$530 per ounce (London Metal Exchange)\n\n·\n\nconcentrate transport costs\n\n·\n\ntreatment costs at Eldorados Kisladag operation\n\n·\n\nproject Royalty of 1% of direct mine operating costs.\n\nEldorado performed the tax evaluation using the pre-tax model developed by Wardrop. Corporate taxation for Turkish business is currently 20% as reported for Eldorados Kisladag operation. Depreciation is based on a unit of production calculation.\n\nPersonnel\n\nThe project will employ approximately 300 people at maximum production, with the majority of workers drawn from the local region. Supplies and services will be accessed from the city of Izmir, 20 kilometers to the north.\n\nLitigation\n\nIn 2004, litigation was filed by certain third parties against the Turkish MOE and Tüprag seeking to cancel the mineral license for Efemçukuru on the basis of an alleged threat to the water quality in the local catchment area. During the course of this litigation, the Lower Administrative Court issued a negative decision, and while in effect the decision prevented the start of mining activities at Efemçukuru. The decision was overturned in 2005 by the Higher Administratiave Court and the mining license has been re-issued. We continue to proceed with our 2008 work plan and permit application schedule. We are confident that we will successfully defend this litigation.\n\n21\n\nEfemçukuru Reports\n\nEfemçukuru is the subject of the following independent report (the Efemçukuru Report): the Technical Report on the Efemçukuru Project (August 2007), prepared by Wardrop Engineering Inc. The Efemçukuru Report is available at www.sedar.com under our name, and should be reviewed to put the preceding discussion in context.\n\nExploration\n\nIn 2007, we continued to carry out exploration activities through Tüprag in two main areas of Turkey: along the Cental and Western Pontide belt (in the Black Sea area) and the Biga Peninsula in western Turkey. Primary targets remain low sulphidation, epithermal high-grade vein systems as well as disseminated, high sulphidation precious metals systems. The total 2008 exploration budget for Turkey is $ 3.2 million. Key exploration projects are highlighted below.\n\nJoint Venture in the Anatolian Plateau\n\nAS Project\n\nOur 50/50 joint venture with Demir Export, the AS Project, consists of 27 licences covering a total of 115,000 hectares. This property, discovered during a reconnaissance program in 2001 and 2002, includes a porphyry-style gold-molybdenum-copper deposit that has alteration styles similar to those at Kisladag. In 2004, we completed the permitting and construction of six kilometers of roads through the center of the anomaly for mapping, sampling and drill access. Drilling results from the 2004 drill program confirmed that AS is an extensive copper-gold porphyry system. In 2005, our exploration activities in Turkey focused on the AS Project. In 2006, we evaluated the porphyry-style mineralization at the main prospect of the Dogrudere deposit and surrounding anomalous areas. Work entailed diamond drilling 14 drill holes of 5,200 meters, detailed geologic mapping and rock chip sampling. The best metal values at Dogrudere are constrained to an early porphyry phase that has been subsequently cut internally, as well as on all sides, by younger and lower-grade porphyry intrusions (0.2% to 0.3% copper and 0.1 to 0.3 g/t gold). These later intrusions severely limit the size potential of the Dogrudere deposit. Work at AS refocused on high sulphidation targets through soil sample surveys and regional mapping and rock chip sampling of southern portions of the project area. Results outlined two high sulphidation targets: Temenni Tepe and Taskele Tepe.\n\nIn May 2001, we signed an agreement with Demir Export A.S. that established the basis for a 50-50 joint exploration, development and subsequent exploration of metal mines in Turkey in 27 licenses covering over 58,642 hectares. The Agreement has been extended to expire April 2008.\n\nIn 2007 work in the west-central Anatolian plateau diminished. By year end, with mutual consent of both parties, it was decided to wind down the 50:50 JV with Demir Export. All JV licenses were dropped except for the AS license. Further work in this region is not planned for 2008.\n\nPontide Belt Region\n\nKapikaya Project\n\nLocated in the central Pontides, the Kapikaya project was fully tested in 2007. A 13 hole (2,020 m) reverse circulation and core program targeted 2 southern silica cap areas (Uvezlice Tepe and Kabak Tepe) in the south and quartz-alunite lithocap zone of Kapikaya ridge to the north. The southern targets appear to be related to pyrite mineralized distal phases of potential mineralizing systems; no zones of gold mineralization were found. Kapikaya ridge testing intersected favourable lithologies and alteration, but the concentration of sulphides (or oxidized equivalents) was low. Results showed that the systems tested do not contain economic values of gold mineralization. No further work will be done on this project.\n\n22\n\nAydogan Project\n\nThe main feature at the Aydogan project is the silica cap defining the Aydogan Tepe and a large exposed area of argillic alteration immediately to the south. Historic work completed in 2004 included soil and rock chip sampling over these features and drilling five reverse circulation holes into a low sulphidation vein target at Kuyucak ridge, the area of a gold-in-soil anomaly south of the argillic altered zone. Results were negative. In 2006, we reviewed the projects geochemical data and completed project-scale stream sediment sampling. The review identified an epithermal vein target near the Aydogan silica cap and along a northeast trending structure. The geochemical patterns also outlined a possible intrusive-related gold target in the argillic altered area called Derebasi Hill. The stream sediment geochemical survey also defined a gold anomaly in the northwest corner of the project.\n\nDetailed mapping and soil sampling programs evaluated the vein target in 2007. Results did not define any anomalous zones. No further work will be done on these targets.\n\nBahcecik Project\n\nIn 2007, we began work on our easternmost Pontides region land holdings, collectively referred to as Gumashane. The work focused on the Bahcecik project which contains multiple intrusions and volcanic units occurring along a three kilometre east-west trending within an altered and mineralized corridor. Within this corridor, pyrite mineralized vuggy silica outcrops were observed and sampled. The rock chip sampling yielded numerous 0.5 to 2.0 g/t Au samples, with ubiquitous higher grade samples (up to 33 g/t Au). A small reverse circulation drill program (3 holes totaling 293m) tested sub-surface continuity of some of these gold-bearing units. These holes successfully intersected down-dip extensions of the mineralized vuggy silica unit. The final hole intersected the thickest vuggy silica zone and returned a wide zone of low grade gold mineralization: 36m averaging 1.00 g/t Au (true width approximately 25m). Onset of winter conditions suspended further work on this property in 2007. The 2008 program will comprise soil geochemical sampling and more detailed mapping. No work on the Bahcecik Project is planned for 2008.\n\nCatak Project\n\nIn 2006, we conducted project-wide stream sediment sampling, reconnaissance mapping and rock sampling. During this work, a number of low sulphidation, precious metal bearing vein systems were discovered (values up to 3 g/t gold and 35 g/t silver). These vein systems, Turnalik and Kabatuzla, are located within three kilometers of each other along the eastern edge of the project area. Both underlie significant multi-element soil and rock anomalies that may indicate the presence of shallow depth gold mineralization. Work in 2007 focused on detailed mapping and sampling of these vein systems. We extended the soil grid and conducted follow-up investigation of the adjacent smaller vein systems and stockwork zones. The 2007 exploration program was designed to define drill targets for testing in 2008. No work on the Catak Project is planned for 2008.\n\nMahmur Tepe\n\nIn 2006, the Mahmur Tepe deposit was confirmed to represent a Porgera-style, structurally controlled, mafic intrusive hosted gold deposit. We completed 2,174 meters of diamond drilling in six drill holes and reviewed this data along with existing geological and geochemical data. The drilling intersected numerous narrow gold-bearing zones with the best intercepts ranging from 0.7 meters to 2.7 meters wide at gold grades of 6.1 to 19.3 g/t. The reinterpretation of the soil geochemical data, together with the revised geology, defined a new target for the potential gold mineralization. The gold appears to be preferentially located around shallow, west-dipping intrusive contacts and localized along south dipping, sub-vertical east-west trending fractures or dikes. The intersection of these two features forms a south plunging, north-south striking zone of potential gold mineralization. This direction is oriented sub-parallel to the 2006 drilling, which targeted the sub-vertical structures only.\n\n23\n\nWork in 2007 was designed to confirm the new interpretation through detailed geology mapping and structural geology review. Other adjacent gold-in-soil anomalies received follow-up work and new interpretative work, based on results over the main anomaly. Five hundred meters of shallow rotary drilling was completed to assist in gathering data in poorly exposed portions of the project area. No work is planned at Mahmur Tepe in 2008.\n\nBiga Peninsula\n\nBayramic Project\n\nThe Bayramic project, located in western Turkey, is a copper-gold porphyry to high sulphidation gold transition geological setting. Observed mineralization in surface exposures consists of quartz-pyrite stockworks in altered intermediate porphyry stocks. In 2006, we completed 774 meters of reverse circulation drilling in 14 holes. The drill targets focused on coincident gold or copper in soil and IP geophysical anomalies. The drilling intersected similar style mineralization at depth with only local intervals containing anomalous copper or gold values. No work was done is 2007. No work is planned for 2008 on this project.\n\nDogancilar Project\n\nThis Dogancilar Project is another that contains historic Tüprag data based on work completed from 1992 to 1994. That work, consisting of 1,000 meters of diamond drilling in 15 holes and results from various mapping and geochemical sampling campaigns, identified numerous structurally controlled, high grade gold-bearing vein systems (Kucuk Bakirlik, Acikdamar and Kecikiran). Results were not fully followed-up during the early program from 1992-1994 (e.g. 3.4 meters grading 11.1 g/t gold in the Kucuk Bakirlik vein). In 2006, we conducted a limited exploration program that encompassed reviewing the existing vein systems and reconnaissance mapping in the Casirli-Magara Tepe area. The mapping revealed significant intermediate sulphidation veining in the Casirli-Magara Tepe area and observed that the Dogancilar projects veining was more common and wider when hosted in volcanic fragmental and mixed volcaniclastic units. An example of the latter is the Kucuk Bakirlik vein, whose continuity and widths were observed to be greater than previously mapped.\n\nExploration work on the property in 2007 concentrated on the Kecikiran vein in the southern portion of the project and over a possible volcanic center in the northwest. Eight diamond drill holes totalling 1,173 meters tested the vein. No notable precious or base metal mineralization was intersected. The volcanic center work comprised of a reconnaissance soil sampling geochemical program results of which were positive with numerous linear, east-west trending, gold-in-soil anomalies defined. Follow up mapping and sampling work, however, has not satisfactorily explained these anomalies. Though limited quartz stockwork zones were seen, much of the anomalous areas are covered by extensive vegetation and cover. No work on this project is planned for 2008.\n\nKirazli and Kuscayiri Projects\n\nThe Kirazli project contains both a high sulphidation precious metal target and a gold porphyry target. These targets come as a result of work done in 2005 where detailed soil and rock chip sampling outlined two main anomalous areas. The western anomaly is over 600 meters on a north-south trend. The second, more easterly anomaly, is more equant in shape and represents a potential porphyry target. In 2007, we completed 17 reverse circulation holes at Kirazli and Kuscayari totalling 2,760 meters.\n\nThe Kirazli drilling tested gold-in-soil anomalies over a high sulphidation mineralization trend believed to be the same as on Teck Comincos ground immediately to the south. High sulphidation textures were observed in the cuttings, and gold mineralization was intersected over reasonable widths in two of the holes.\n\n24\n\nKuscayari project drilling also targeted anomalous gold-in-soil zones. The holes intersected high sulphidation and low grade mineralization, and areas of more porphyry-like mineralization. Results of mapping and surface rock sampling programs yielded positive results with most samples returning anomalous gold values.\n\nDespite the positive results at both Kirazli and Kuscayari, further work was suspended due to proximity to a water catchment area for numerous towns and villages. We have packaged these projects for option opportunities to interested third parties.\n\nGeneral Reconnaissance\n\nGeneral reconnaissance in 2008 will focus on central and eastern Turkey including the identification and classification of specific potential targets. We will also evaluate exploration licenses made available through the auction process. The 2008 budget for general reconnaissance exploration is $843,000.\n\nEnvironment\n\nWe have conducted extensive environmental testing and monitoring at our Turkish development projects to firmly establish baseline data and characteristics for air, water and soil.\n\nThe EIA report on the Kisladag provided an in-depth analysis of the potential environmental and social impacts and identified measures to mitigate these impacts. All aspects of the Kisladag design have considered international best practices used by the mining industry to protect the environment in the short and long term and to maintain the health and safety of workers and the community in which we operate.\n\nIn 2004, we dedicated a potable water system for nine local villages surrounding Kisladag. Also in 2004, we equipped a mobile community medical van with supplies and equipment. In 2005, we continued to work with the Canadian International Development Agency to implement one of the agriculture initiatives identified through the Sustainable Development Plan we helped to develop for the area. In addition, we have expanded our monitoring program of ground water wells and dust monitors, implemented our EIA monitoring program and placed the environmental monitoring team.\n\nIn 2007, site remediation efforts began at Kisladag with a program to re-establish tree cover in certain areas of the project site and with initial studies into developing test cells for cover system designs to be used to cap the leach pad and rock dumps as set out in the mine closure plan. This work has been supported by a program carried out in the Companys greenhouse facilities to investigate the different plant, shrub and tree species suitable for local propagation. This work will continue in 2008 and be ongoing over the life of the mine.\n\nAcquisition and Dispositions\n\nKaymaz & Kuçükdere\n\nIn 2003, we wrote down our Kaymaz and Kuçükdere projects from $4.3 million to nil as the projects were no longer technically viable as an on-site mine and gold recovery operation. In 2005, Tüprag sold its Kaymaz and Küçükdere mine operation licenses and immovable property together with all rights and obligations to Koza Altın İşletmeleri A.Ş. The sale price of the licenses and property was $5.5 million; $3.0 million on signing the agreement and $2.5 million on the first anniversary of the transaction date. The Company received its final payment of $2.5 million in November 2006.\n\n25\n\nChina\n\nThe Peoples Republic of China (PRC or China) is situated in Eastern Asia and has a long coast bordering the East China Sea, Korea Bay, Yellow Sea and South China Sea. The total area of China is 9.6 million km2 with an estimated population of 1.4 billion people.\n\nChina is a significant producer of commodities with its mining industry ranking third in the world. Much of the mineral production is consumed nationally. In the recent past, the government has moved to increase foreign investment in several sectors of the mining industry, including the development of a regime for Sino-foreign cooperative joint ventures and foreign participation in mineral resource exploration and mining. Our interest in our Tanjianshan Mine (TJS) is held through a joint venture company, Qinghai Dachaidan Mining Limited (QDML) governed by the law of the PRC.\n\nCooperative Joint Ventures\n\nA Sino-foreign cooperative joint venture (CJV) is a limited liability company that owns all of the CJV's assets. Investors liabilities are limited to their subscribed capital contributions as provided in the cooperative joint venture contract (the CJV Contract). CJVs are governed by PRC law which requires investors in a CJV to make an investment or other contribution, which can be cash, material, land use rights or other property rights. An investor must fulfill its contribution obligations within the time frame prescribed by the CJV Contract; otherwise, the relevant governmental authorities will notify the offending party that it has a limited time frame in which to make the contribution. If the failure to make the capital contribution continues, governmental authorities may revoke the approval for the CJV and its business licence.\n\n26\n\nForeign Exchange Controls\n\nUnder PRC foreign exchange regulations, foreign exchange dealings are administered by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange and its local agencies (the SAFE) and transacted through designated financial institutions. CJVs are required to conduct their corporate activities in accordance with the relevant PRC foreign exchange rules and regulations.\n\nA CJV is entitled to borrow funds from overseas within the difference between its total investment amount and registered capital. Once a loan agreement has been registered with the SAFE in accordance with the formal requirements, the principal and interest of the loan can be paid out of China.\n\nA CJV is also entitled to remit the profit/dividends derived from the CJV out of China once the relevant taxes of the CJV have been paid in compliance with PRC Law, provided that its foreign investor has made its capital contribution in compliance with the contribution schedule set out in the CJV Contract.\n\nTaxation and Fees\n\nThere are several taxes, charges and fees that apply to CJVs in China, including, but not limited to corporate income tax, business tax, value added tax, resources tax, mineral resources compensation (royalties), land use tax and other taxes or assessments.\n\nChina has recently revamped its tax laws governing both domestic and foreign invested enterprises. Effective January 1, 2008 the tax laws in China were amended. It is our understanding of the amendments that the Company may not be eligible for the two-year tax holiday and reduced tax rate of 15% for six years previously provided by the Quinghai government for TJS. Based on discussions to date, Chinese tax authorities have indicated that the TJS mine can qualify as an Encouraged Project, resulting in a 15% tax rate for the years 2007 to 2010 and 25% for the years 2011 and forward. The normal rate of tax under the amended tax legislation is 33% for 2007 and 25% from 2008 onward.\n\nResource tax is levied on natural resources exploitation, generally on a tonnage or volume basis, at amounts specified by the Ministry of Finance in consultation with relevant ministries of the State Council, the highest executive branch of the State. The standard tax amount range for non-ferrous metal ores ranges from RMB 0.4 to 30 per tonne.\n\nThe resource compensation fee is a royalty collected by the State, and calculated at a rate prescribed by the State (the rate is four percent for gold) based on sales income and mining recovery rates. In some cases, CJVs may be exempted from resource compensation or benefit from reduced rates, such as CJVs that make use of tailings.\n\nCJVs engaging in non-service/production activities are subject to value-added tax (VAT). CJVs pay VAT on inputs and collect VAT on outputs. The standard VAT rate is 17 percent. Exports are generally zero-rated. Exporters are eligible to apply for a refund for VAT paid, which may be significant, as VAT is not collected on exports.\n\nStamp tax (at a maximum rate of 0.1 percent) is levied on the execution or receipt in China of all taxable documents listed in the Stamp Tax Regulations, such as contracts for the sale of goods, the undertaking of processing work, leases, agency and other non-trade contracts. Stamp tax is also levied on certification in evidence of rights and licenses.\n\nOverview of Mining Industry Regulations\n\nExploration for and exploitation of mineral resources in the PRC is governed by the Mineral Resources Law of the PRC of 1986, amended and effective January 1, 1997, and the Implementation Rules for the Mineral Resources Law of the PRC, effective March 26, 1994. In order to further implement these laws, on February 12, 1998, the State Council issued three sets of regulations: (i) Regulation for Registering to Explore Mineral Resources Using the Block System, (ii) Regulation for Registering to Mine Mineral Resources and (iii) Regulation for Transferring Exploration and Mining Rights (together with the mineral resources law and implementation rules being referred to herein as Mineral Resources Law).\n\n27\n\nUnder Mineral Resources Law, the Ministry of Land and Resources and its local authorities (the MLR) is in charge of the supervision of mineral resource exploration and development. The mineral resources administration authorities of provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, under the jurisdiction of the State, are in charge of the supervision of mineral resource exploration and development in their respective administration areas. The people's governments of provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, under the jurisdiction of the State, are in charge of coordinating the supervision by the mineral resources administration authorities on the same level.\n\nThe Mineral Resources Law and Property Law of the PRC (Property Law), together with the Constitution of the PRC, provides that mineral resources are owned by the State, and the State Council, the highest executive organization of the State, regulates mineral resources on behalf of the State. The ownership rights of the State include the rights to: (i) occupy, (ii) use, (iii) earn and (iv) dispose of mineral resources. Notwithstanding the States ownership of mineral resources, the Property Law expressly provides that lawfully-acquired mineral rights are protected by law.\n\nMineral Resources Licenses\n\nChina has adopted, under the Mineral Resources Law, a licensing system for the exploration and exploitation of mineral resources. The MLR is responsible for approving applications for exploration licenses and mining licenses and for transferring exploration licenses and mining licenses.\n\nApplicants must meet certain conditions as required by related rules/regulations. Under the Regulations for Registering to Mine Mineral Resources, the applicant for mining rights must present the required documents, including a plan for the development and use of the mineral resources and an environmental impact evaluation report. The Mineral Resources Law allows individuals to excavate sporadic resources, sand, rocks and clay for use as construction materials and a small quantity of mineral resources for sustenance. However, individuals are prohibited from mining mineral resources that are more appropriately mined at a certain scale by a company, specified minerals that are subject to protective mining by the State and certain other designated mineral resources.\n\nOnce granted, all exploration and mining rights under the licenses are protected by the State from encroachment or disruption under the Mineral Resources Law and the Property Law. It is a criminal offence to steal, seize or damage exploration facilities, or disrupt the working order of exploration areas.\n\nExploration Rights\n\nIn order to conduct gold exploration, a CJV must apply to the MLR for an exploration license, which when granted has a term of no more than three years. An exploration license area is described by a basic block. An exploration license for metallic and non-metallic minerals has a maximum of 40 basic blocks. When mineral resources that are feasible for economic development have been discovered, a licensee may apply for the right to develop such mineral resources. The period of validity of the exploration license can be extended by application and each extension can be for no more than two years.\n\nDuring the term of the exploration license, the licensee has the privileged priority to obtain mining rights to the mineral resources in the exploration area, provided that the licensee meets the qualifying conditions for mining rights owners. An exploration licensee has the rights, among others, to: (i) explore without interference within the area under license during the license term, (ii) construct exploration facilities and (iii) pass through other exploration areas and adjacent ground to access the licensed area.\n\nAfter the licensee acquires the exploration license, the licensee is obliged to, among other things: (i) begin exploration within the prescribed term, (ii) explore according to a prescribed exploration work scheme, (iii) comply with State laws and regulations regarding labour safety, water and soil conservation, land reclamation and environmental protection, (iv) make detailed reports to local and other licensing authorities, (v) close and occlude the wells arising from exploration work, (vi) take other measures to protect against safety concerns after the exploration work is completed and (vii) complete minimum exploration expenditures as required by the Regulations for Registering to Explore Resources Using the Block.\n\n28\n\nMining Rights\n\nIn order to conduct mining activities, a CJV must also apply for a mining license from the MLR. Owners of mining rights, or concessionaires, are granted a mining license to mine for a term of no more than 10 to 30 years, depending on the magnitude or size of the mining project. A mining license owner may extend the term of a mining license with an application 30 days prior to expiration of the term.\n\nIn addition to obtaining mining licenses, in order for a CJV to conduct any gold mining activities, it must obtain a Gold Mining Approval Certificate from the relevant competent authority in accordance with the Gold Mining Approval Certificate Administrative Regulation issued by the National Development and Reform Commission, which became effective as of January 1, 2004.\n\nA mining license owner has the rights, among others, to: (i) conduct mining activities during the term and within the mining area prescribed by the mining license, (ii) sell mineral products (except for mineral products that the State Council has identified for unified purchase by designated units), (iii) construct production and living facilities within the mine area, and (iv) use the land necessary for production and construction, in accordance with applicable laws.\n\nA mining license owner is required to, among other things: (i) conduct mine construction or mining activities within a defined time period, (ii) conduct efficient production, rational mining and comprehensive use of the mineral resources, (iii) pay resources tax and mineral resources compensation (royalties) pursuant to applicable laws, (iv) comply with State laws and regulations regarding labour safety, water and soil conservation, land reclamation and environmental protection, (v) be subject to the supervision and management by the departments in charge of geology and mineral resources, and (vi) complete and present mineral reserves forms and mineral resource development and use statistics reports, in accordance with applicable law.\n\nGold Sale Policy\n\nUnder the PRC Regulations on Administration of Gold and Silver and its implementing rules, the Peoples Bank of China is the competent agent authorized to supervise and control the purchase and distribution of gold and silver in China. It is responsible for the States reserves of gold and silver and, jointly with other competent authorities, for regulating and supervising the gold and silver markets.\n\nWith the opening of Shanghai Gold Exchange in October 2002, the trading and exchange of gold in the domestic market may be conducted on the Exchange at market prices. The members of the Shanghai Gold Exchange can sell their gold products directly to gold refineries, smelters and banks through the Exchange. Those non-member gold producers who want to trade through the Shanghai Gold Exchange may authorize the members of the Exchange to trade on their behalf.\n\nThe PRC State Council announced in 2003 that wholesale, retailing, production and processing of gold in the domestic market would no longer require the approval of the Peoples Bank of China. However, all gold, including that extracted from ore deposits and refined as a by-product, may not be sold outside China without the approval of the Peoples Bank of China.\n\nEnvironmental Laws\n\nIn the past ten years, PRC laws and policies regarding environmental protection have moved towards stricter compliance standards and stronger enforcement. In accordance with the Environmental Protection Law of the PRC adopted by the Standing Committee of the NPC on 26 December 1989, the State Environmental Protection Administration under the State Council sets national environmental protection standards. The various local environmental protection bureaus may set stricter local standards for environmental protection. CJVs are required to comply with the stricter of the two standards.\n\n29\n\nThe basic laws in China governing environmental protection in the mineral industry sector of the economy are the Environmental Protection Law and the Mineral Resources Law. Applicants for mining licenses must submit environmental impact assessments, and those projects that fail to meet environmental protection standards will not be granted licenses. In addition, after exploration, a licensee must take further actions for environmental protection, such as performing water and soil maintenance. After the mining licenses have expired or a licensee stops mining during the license period and the mineral resources have not been fully developed, the licensee shall perform other obligations such as water and soil maintenance, land recovery and environmental protection in compliance with the original development scheme, or must pay the costs of land recovery and environmental protection. After mine closure, the mining enterprise must perform water and soil maintenance, land recovery and environmental protection in compliance with mine closure approval reports, or must pay certain costs, including the costs of land recovery and environmental protection.\n\nAcquisition of Afcan Mining Corporation\n\nOn September 13, 2005, we completed the court-approved compromise transaction with Afcan Mining Corporation (Afcan), whereby we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Afcan. Afcan indirectly owned 85 percent of TJS. Under the terms of the compromise agreement with Afcan, outstanding common shares of Afcan were exchanged for Eldorado Common Shares (Common Shares) on the basis of one Common Share for 6.5 Afcan common shares, resulting in the issuance of a total of 23,045,151 Common Shares (the Transaction).\n\nIn addition, outstanding warrants of Afcan (the Afcan Warrants) were exchanged for warrants of Eldorado (the Replacement Warrants) on the basis of one Replacement Warrant for each 6.5 Afcan Warrants. Each Replacement Warrant had an exercise price equal to six and one half (6.5) times the exercise price of the Afcan Warrants in respect of which such Replacement Warrant was issued. All other terms and conditions of the Replacement Warrants, including expiry terms, were identical to those of the Afcan Warrants. In total, Eldorado issued 4,595,952 Replacement Warrants of which 1,385,789 Replacement Warrants (exercise price Cdn$2.4375 per Common Share), had an expiry of September 30, 2005, and 3,210,163 Replacement Warrants (exercise price Cdn$2.4375 per Common Share), had an expiry of November 18, 2006.\n\nThe outstanding options to purchase common shares of Afcan (the Afcan Options) held by directors, officers, employees and service providers of Afcan who entered into employment or service agreements with the Company were exchanged for replacement options (the Replacement Options) to purchase Common Shares on the basis of one Replacement Option for every six-and-one-half (6.5) Afcan Options. Each such Replacement Option had an exercise price equal to six-and-one-half (6.5) times the exercise price of the Afcan Options in respect of which such Replacement Option were issued. The Company issued a total of 91,538 Replacement Options. All other Afcan Options immediately vested and were either exercised or cancelled, prior to closing the transaction. See Capital Structure  Share Option Plans.\n\nUnder the terms of the Transaction, Eldorado made a $15.0 million credit facility available to Afcan. Loans under the credit facility included interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 3 percent per annum. On completion of the Transaction, the credit facility was converted to an inter-company loan. Proceeds of the credit facility were used primarily to fund TJS obligations of the joint venture company QDML.\n\nThe Business Acquisition Report regarding our acquisition of Afcan dated January 30, 2006 was filed on SEDAR and is available at www.sedar.com.\n\n30\n\nTanjianshan\n\nTanjianshan, our 90 percent controlled project, is located in Qinghai Province.\n\nProject Description\n\nTJS is located in the Qinghai Province of northwest China. It is comprised of four large contiguous exploration licences that total 338 km2 in the area and that encompass two mining licences over two defined gold deposits, namely the Jinlonggou (JLG) and Qinlongtan (QLT) deposits, as well as numerous other prospects and anomalies.\n\nOwnership Interest\n\nAs provided under the terms of the Transaction, during 2006 our ownership increased to a 90 percent interest in QDML and the Tanjianshan Mine when our capital investment reached $50.0 million. The remaining 10 percent interest is owned equally by the Qinghai Number One Geological Brigade (Q1) (5%) and the Dachaidan Gold Mine (5%). Afcans holding in QDML was previously owned by Sino Mining Limited, which divested Tanjianshan to Afcan in March 2003.\n\nAs noted above, Tanjianshan is comprised of the following two mining licences and four contiguous exploration licences:\n\nTenement\n\nType\n\nArea (km2)\n\nDate Granted\n\nDate Expiry\n\nJinlonggou\n\nMining\n\n1.03\n\n02 Sep 2004\n\n02 Jul 2007 (1)\n\nQinlongtan\n\nMining\n\n2.88\n\n24 Jan 2005\n\n09 Dec 2007 (1)\n\nQinlongshan\n\nExploration\n\n74.90\n\n12 May 2006\n\n12 Feb 2008 (1)\n\nQingshan\n\nExploration\n\n72.07\n\n03 Nov 2005\n\n03 Nov 2007 (1)\n\nJinlonggou\n\nExploration\n\n86.98\n\n12 May 2006\n\n12 Feb 2008 (1)\n\nXijingou\n\nExploration\n\n100.86\n\n03 Nov 2005\n\n03 Nov 2007 (1)\n\nTotal\n\n338.72\n\nNote (1) These exploration leases have expired and are currently being renewed and, under Chinese law will be extended for an additional two years. All required reports and documentation have been submitted to the appropriate government agencies and approval is expected to be received during the second quarter of 2008.\n\nThe exploration licenses are not surveyed tenements. Exploration licences are defined by latitude and longitude and marked on a plan, not on the ground. Definition of mining licenses may be based on either No. 3º or No. 6º Qinghai Provincial Grid and is again recorded on a plan. Sometimes the tenements are marked by pegs on site, but the co-ordinate definition takes precedence.\n\nOwners of an exploration license have the right to explore for all minerals, save those preserved for the State, and to construct such facilities as are required by the owner to explore for such minerals. The owner also has a priority claim over applications for mining licences within the exploration licence area. Owners are obligated to begin and complete exploration within the time frame of the licence and to submit progress reports on a regular basis. Excavations and other surface disturbances are required to be rehabilitated on completion of the planned exploration. Annual maintenance costs are RMB 100 per km2 for years 1 to 3, thereafter increasing by RMB 100 per year to a maximum of RMB 500 per km2 per year.\n\nPrescribed exploration expenditures per km2 are RMB 2,000 in year 1, RMB 5,000 in year 2 and RMB 10,000 in subsequent years. These licenses are granted initially for three years, and may be extended for a further two years. There is no limit to the number of extensions that may be applied for. Currently, applications for extension for the exploration licenses which expired in July 2007, November 2007 and February 2008 have been submitted and receipt is expected in the second quarter of 2008.\n\nThe mining license is granted for a maximum initial period of three years depending on the scale of the mine; thereafter, renewal is reviewed before expiration upon the mining license holders application. Renewal is guaranteed, provided there is compliance with mining regulations and all tax and royalty payments have been made. Owners of a mining licence have the right to construct, develop and mine the delineated mineral resource.\n\n31\n\nCurrently, the JLG mining license is owned by QDML and extends from surface (3,556 mRL) to 3,378 mRL. An application has been approved to extend the license from surface down to 3,000 mRL.\n\nThe QLT mining license, previously held by Q1, has been transferred to QDML. This mining license extends vertically from surface (3,710 mRL) to 3,450 mRL.\n\nSurface rights at TJS are currently sufficient for mining operations at the scale indicated by the Tanjianshan proven and probable reserves, as disclosed in the table titled Proven and Probable Reserves on page 8. To the extent that such proven and probable reserves increase, TJS surface rights will not be sufficient, and it would be necessary to obtain additional surface rights. There are three ways to obtain land use rights from the PRC government authorities: allocation, grant and lease. Different levels of government organizations have different authorities to approve the land use right application depending on the nature and areas of the land concerned. QDML may submit its application to the relevant government authorities to obtain the granted land or lease land if it deems necessary. QDML has obtained the lease right dated on July 11, 2005 under which QDML is entitled to use the leased land for the area of 445,100 m2. On February 1, 2007 QDML obtained the Phase II lease right under which QDML is entitled to use additional leased land for the area of 221,083 m2.\n\nFor the allocated land use right, the government may approve the allocated land use right in accordance with the Catalogue for Allocated Land, which lists certain industries that may be able to use allocated land. Although the gold mining industry has not been listed in the Catalogue for Allocated Land, QDML obtained allocated land on July 11, 2005 for an area of 243,300 m2. On February 1, 2007 QDML obtained the allocated land under which QDML is entitled to use additional allocated land for the area of 575,469 m2.\n\nRoyalty\n\nThe CJV provides that Q1 and Dachaidan Gold Mine obtain a total of 4.5 percent of the net sales revenue from the gold produced by QDML as their base income directly transferred once each sale is transacted. This revenue shall be directly transferred to the account designated by each of Q1 and Dachaidan Gold Mine each time QDML sells mineral products. The 4.5 percent royalty will be evenly split between the two groups (2.25 percent each). However, in order for Q1 and Dachaidan Gold Mine to obtain such 4.5 percent royalty, approval from related tax authorities must be obtained. The royalty percentage is unaffected by the percentage ownership interests of the parties to the QDML joint venture.\n\nLocation, Climate and Access\n\nTanjianshan is located in the Dachaidan Region, Haixi Prefecture, Qinghai Province in the northwest of the PRC. Qinghai is a relatively large province covering 720,000 km2 and supporting a population of approximately 5.3 million. The capital of Qinghai is Xining, which is situated in the eastern part of the province. At a local scale, the project area is located 80 kilometers northwest of Dachaidan in the Haixi Prefecture.\n\nThe camp and the mill site at Tanjianshan are located at an elevation of 3,200 meters with the main resource at between 3,300 meters and 3,550 meters. Tanjianshan is located in the Saishiteng Mountains, and there is virtually no vegetation in the area. The landscape is composed of rugged mountains with slope angles of 45° to 50°. The Aolao River lies approximately two kilometers due east and is the only permanent river in the area.\n\n32\n\nThe project area experiences a dry continental climate with low rainfall, high evaporation and generally clear skies. Winters are long and summers short, with a large diurnal temperature range. Meteorological data collected between 1971 and 1980 at Dachaidan (75 kilometers east southeast), and at a lower elevation than the site, recorded an average annual temperature of 1.6oC and annual rainfall of 200 mm. Maximum monthly temperatures are in July and August (21oC) and minimum monthly temperatures are in January (-15oC). Maximum monthly rainfall is in June and July (40 mm), whereas no precipitation is recorded in November, December and January. The highest temperature on record is 29.9oC on July 15, 1971 and the lowest is -32.3oC on January 18, 1973. Winds are frequent and strong from the west and northwest averaging 8.6 km/h and peaking at 70 km/h.\n\nThe nearest centres are Dunhuang (265 kilometers by road to the north) and Geermu (260 kilometers by road to the south). There are frequent flights during the summer months (tourist season) between Beijing and Dunhuang. There are also regular flights from Xining to Geermu throughout the year.\n\nThe site is easily accessed by road. There is a main highway between Dunhuang (Gansu Province) and Geermu or Dachaidan in Qinghai Province that passes within 12 kilometers of the plant site. The road is sealed and in good condition, ensuring year-round access throughout the area.\n\nGeology and Mineralization\n\nJLG lies within a low, northwest trending, mountain range (Tanjianshan) composed of Wandonggou and Tanjianshan Group rocks, with Early Palaeozoic gabbro intruding the Proterozoic rocks and Late Paleozoic porphyritic plagiogranite intruding all older units. Northwest striking thrust faults dissect the units and commonly separate blocks. Dips to both the northeast and southwest are recorded. The range to the northwest has the same mix of rocks as Tanjianshan but also includes a large block of Late Paleozoic granite. This range is host to the QLT gold deposit.\n\nThe JLG gold mineralization lies in a host rock sequence dominated by carbonaceous phyllites. The rocks are dark grey to black and display a well-developed foliation. In the central and southern parts of JLG, a number of orange brown sandstone bands are also present and act as key marker horizons. Two intrusive rock types occur within the limits of the mineralization and are both of probable intermediate composition. Both intrusive unit types occur above and below the T2 thrust but in quite different styles. Above the T2 fault, the intrusives occur as steep (60°- 70°) southwest dipping, southeast trending thin bodies that clearly cut across the folded sedimentary units. Below the T2 and above the F30 faults, towards the M7 and Pubugou areas, diorites are volumetrically greater than above T2. They occur as multiple sheeted, near horizontal sills.\n\nThroughout JLG, common tight and isoclinal folds plunge dominantly to the south at between 20º and 30º. The tight folding has only been recorded above T2. Most faults within the Jinlonggou are broadly contemporaneous. Fault patterns can be subdivided into two dominant families: northeast sinistral faults parallel to primary layering (average orientation: 87º southeast 019º) and northwest dextral faults (average orientation: 74º southwest 160º). The former occur on the northern and western parts of JLT whereas the latter are developed throughout the property. Fault T2, exposed throughout many of the drives and crosscuts of adit PD2, is oriented approximately 15º northwest 060º. This structure, together with at least two major flat dipping splays, is sub parallel and may be related to fault F30 (25º - 45º northwest 045º). Both thrust faults bound the upper and lower limits of the sub-horizontal package of diorites.\n\nTwo host environments exist for gold mineralization at Jinlonggou, relative to the T2 thrust fault: upper, moderately to steeply dipping, bedding plane parallel, phyllite hosted mineralization; and lower, gently dipping diorite and phyllite hosted mineralization. The 160º trending dextral faults are interpreted to represent feeder zones to the gold mineralization. The JLG gold mineralization defines a bowl shape volume having about a 500-meter diameter and extending up to 240 meters below surface.\n\nQLT mineralization is confined to a 50-60º east-dipping zone comprising a calcareous sandstone interlayer between two marble units. The zone is typically 5 to 10 meters wide, to a maximum of 14 meters and is oriented approximately parallel to the close to north south oriented layering. QLT mineralization has been defined 600 meters along strike and up to 300 meters down dip.\n\n33\n\nGold is hosted within the pyrite and arsenopyrite crystals. Minor amounts occur within quartz grains enclosed in pyrite. A strong relationship exists between gold and fine grained sulphide minerals.\n\nCurrent Exploration\n\nThe main source of data from the programs is from diamond drilling. Drilling totals at JLG and QLT, from 2003 to 2005, consist of 33,136 meters in 242 holes. The drilling was carried out by a drill contractor.\n\nPrior to 2005, field work and mining operations were restricted to the period from April to October. Mining and processing operations were on a care and maintenance basis from November to March inclusive. In 2005/2006, we continued our field work and mine construction activities throughout the winter months.\n\nThe exploration work we completed in 2005 was the culmination of a three-year exploration and delineation program (the Program) at Tanjianshan. In the first two years, those programs were undertaken by Afcan. The objective of the programs was to obtain sufficient data to establish measured and indicated mineral resources at JLG and QLT to support feasibility level mine planning. Those programs were successful and led to the completion of the feasibility study and the declaration of mineral reserves.\n\nThe final year of the program, 2005, was spent fulfilling three goals: to convert any inferred mineral resources that were contained within the feasibility open pit planned boundary to at least indicated mineral resource levels of confidence; to test for extensions of gold mineralization at JLG (to the northeast) and QLT (to the south); and to sterilize planned sites for major infrastructure and waste rock dumps.\n\nThe 2005 program goals were achieved with the exception of extending the gold mineralization at QLT.\n\nAt JLG, the majority of holes were sited at nominal spacings of 30 meters apart on 30 meter section lines normal to the bedding parallel zones above the T2 fault, and at similar spacings on the same grid oriented west, vertical and east to test the subhorizontal diorite/phyllite sequence below the T2 fault. In addition, a drilling program in early 2004 targeted the 160° trending fault corridors on an oblique grid. The severe topography also served to restrict access to prefer"
