        "text": "The modern town is an extension of Izmit, partly on the level land of the delta, partly on the hills to the south of the gulf. It was badly damaged in the earthquake of 1999 and had recovered enough to be made a sub-province in 2008.\n\nA main road links the town with Yalova and Bursa, and behind that pleasant villas rise up suburban hillsides. On the coast is a large commercial dock and port area with a refinery, but parts of the coast have been landscaped and make pleasant walking. Fishing is still practised.\n\nInland, forestry, agriculture and beekeeping form the main employment. There is some organic farming, especially around Yuvacık dam, which is a major reservoir and water source for the cities.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 680 BC, the independent city state of Astacus was established in the vicinity of Başiskele by the Megarians or people of Chalcedon (Kadiköy). Surrounded by walls, the economy of the city was dependent on agriculture and sea. The first coin of Astacus, dating back to 712 BC, is on display at the Istanbul Archaeological Museum, showing Astacus’ independence and wealth at that time.\n\nAccording to mythological stories, an explorer called Astacus declared himself as “the child of Neptune” because of his seafaring skills and founded a city named after himself and the gulf on that city’s shores was also given the same name.”\n\nIn another myth, Astacus was the son of Olbia (the goddess of the city of Astacus) and Poseidon (the god of sea) and the heroic leader of the Megarians. This view is supported by the coin which bears the depiction of the city’s founding goddess Olbia on one side and a lobster – the symbol of the city – on the other side. Coin production also shows that it was a city-state. The word “astakos” means “lobster” in Greek; they used to be abundant in the Gulf. Scylax of Caryanda, the famous geographer of the ancient world, refers to Izmit Gulf as “the city of Olbia” in his logbook “Periplous” (“Voyage” in English) and this reveals that “Astacus” and “Olbia” are two names given to the ancient city founded around Izmit Gulf.\n\nArchaeological finds like Roman column capitals, ruins of water channel and other ancient remains dating to 5th century BC were unearthed in the vicinity of Başiskele during the construction of the Izmit – Gölcük Highway.\n\nAfter the founding of Nicomedia, the city declined and effectively disappeared from history. It may have been destroyed in earthquakes.\n\nIn Ottoman times, the main Bağdad road ran along the coast and remains of bridges on this highway have been identified. In the 16th C, the area was settled by Armenians who founded several villages. Later Turks fro the Black Sea and Caucasus settled, as the area bears a remarkable similarity to their homelands. Greeks also settled around the villace of Yeniköy.\n\nThe war of Independence resulted in Greek occupation for a short period, but resistance was centred above the coast, where local men formed brigades who resisted the occupation. After the war, Greeks were resettled in Greece and Turks from Drama were returned to Yeniköy and Akmeşe.\n\nAccommodation\n\nAccommodation is available on the coast, and several campsites and rural restaurants are situated along the route in the forests.\n\nTransport\n\nLocal buses connect Başiskele with Izmit or with Yalova and Bursa."
