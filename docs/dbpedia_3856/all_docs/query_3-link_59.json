        "text": "Turkey's Largest Block Forests Yenice Yenice Forests, one of Turkey's richest forest assets, are within the borders of Karabük province. Yenice Forests contain a very rich variety with its flora and fauna. Yenice Forests, which are selected as Turkey's largest block forests, have also been declared one of the 100 areas to be protected by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). Yenice Forests have unique features in terms of visuality, landscape integrity, biodiversity, ecosystem diversity and wildlife presence, which is a forest sea. As a high point of attraction, it is very suitable for different activities to be formed from the combination of nature and botanical trips, walks, cycling activities and nature holidays. It is possible to see the unique beauties of Yenice Forests and Yenice Stream from scenic viewing points.\n\nThere is also the arboretum \"Open Air Forest Museum\" area where monumental trees are located in Yenice forests. There are daily facilities for tourism and alternative accommodation units in Yenice. The Nature and Animal Museum in Şeker Canyon located in Yenice Forests offers the visitors the opportunity to get to know the wildlife and plant diversity closely. In addition, Ihlamur Teras has restaurants and bungalow accommodation facilities, allowing all visitors to have pleasant moments. Safranbolu, which is on the UNESCO World Heritage City List with its 5 thousand years of history, is on the World Architectural Heritage List in the Western Black Sea Region, besides its historical houses, cultural values ​​and ancient cities, it has a great tourism potential with its natural beauties around it. Safranbolu, which is the most important face of Karabük in tourism, is shown among the best protected cities in the world and stands out with its feature of being the only place in the world heritage list in Turkey in urban scale. Known with titles such as \"Open Air Museum\", \"The City that Protects Itself\" and \"The Capital of Protection\", the district takes its name from the saffron flower that grows in the region. As a result of the restoration of historical mansions and monuments, which are the most important building blocks of Turkish urban culture, they changed their shell in tourism and became a popular destination for local and foreign tourists.\n\nSafranbolu and its environs, which also contain important values ​​regarding alternative tourism, which has dominated the world in recent years, therefore occupy an important position in terms of tourism. Its proximity to big cities such as Ankara and Istanbul provides a great advantage in terms of transportation. Amasra, the world's apple of the eye with its magnificent nature, history and gastronomic values, the name of Amasra, which is the district of Bartın, the pearl of the Western Black Sea, is at least as prominent as Bartın. The biggest reason for this is based on its deep-rooted past. Amasra, with its history, nature, sea and cultural richness, is an important destination that fascinates visitors and its history dates back to very old times. B.C. It was founded by the Phoenicians in the 12th century and then captured by the Genoese in the 13th century. Amasra has its current name in BC. It is named after Queen Amastris, who ruled this town in the 3rd century. For Amasra, which was one of the first places where tourism was performed in Turkey, Fatih Sultan Mehmet Han said \"Is this the Lala Lala Çeşm-i Cihan\", that is, \"is this the apple of the world\". Besides its historical and natural beauties, Amasra offers a visual feast to its visitors with its unique view. Amasra also offers an important feast to those who come with its fresh and delicious fish and Amasra salad. Güzelcehisar, Home to 80-Million-Year-Old Lava Columns Güzelcehisar is one of the heavenly corners of our country that fascinates those who see it with its surroundings covered with greenery on the Black Sea coast, wonderful sea, sand and insatiable sunsets. The feature that distinguishes Güzelcehisar from its counterparts and places it in the front row is not only its natural beauty, but also its lava columns, which are a natural wonder.\n\nWhen you walk on the unique sands of Güzelcehisar, geometric-section basalt columns that start at the western end of the long beach and rise like a wall from the sea extend from Güzelcehisar to another natural wonder, Mugada Bay. In 2017, Bartın-Güzelcehisar Basalt Columns were declared as Natural Monument by taking the lava columns similar in Scotland, Ireland and California under protection. The Bartın River, which took its name from Parthenius, which means \"City of Waters\" in Ancient Times, is Bartın's most important river, BC. It is the Bartın River, which is called Parthenios and gives the city its name. Kocaçay and Kocanazçayı, which form the two main branches of the Bartın river, joined at Gazhane Cape in the center of Bartın and traveled 14 km to reach the Black Sea in the Boğaz area. admirable It is an important tourism focus that also enables transportation on Bartın River. Due to the low flow rate of the river reaching the Black Sea, it is available for boat tours. There are also areas around the river suitable for activities such as angling and photography, as well as hiking, resting and eating and drinking opportunities. The Wonder of Nature Yedigöller National Park The national park, which was taken under protection in 1965 and contains many plant species, has the most beautiful natural forests of Turkey.\n\nIt is a nature paradise with a variety of animals ranging from wild animals such as bears, pigs and wolves to over a hundred bird species. It provides opportunities for activities such as picnic, recreation and sports with different land forms and walking paths. Nature Museum Küre Mountains National Park Strabon, one of the first geographers in history, stated in his book Geographika written 2000 years ago that the best type of boxwood tree grows on the lands of Amatris (Amasra) and talked about the Küre Mountains National Park and its surroundings. Evliya Çelebi also describes the forests in Amasra region in his work Seyehatnama; In other words, he described the Küre Mountains National Park region as an ocean of trees. Küre Mountains National Park, which has the best wild examples of \"Black Sea Moist Karstic Forest\" ecosystems, which is under threat today, is located in \"100 forest hot spots\" that should be protected in Europe. Hotspot is a term used by nature conservationists to describe areas in the world with a high level of endemism (limited presence of a plant species in a narrow region) and at the same time experiencing rapid habitat loss. Küre Mountains have an important ecotourism potential with their streams, canyons, caves and springs as well as rich flora and fauna.\n\nTurkey's New Ski Resort Keltepe With its 2,000-altitude Keltepe Ski Center, which has been put into service for Four Seasons Active Ski tourism, Karabük aims to be an important destination in tourism. The center, which has 3 tracks with a length of one thousand, 2,300 and 2,400 meters, has a chair lift of 873 meters, 58 suspension chairs with a length of 690 meters, teleski and baby lift systems. The guests who come to the ski center will be able to enjoy skiing and nature tourism by staying in Safranbolu, a town famous for its historical houses on the UNESCO World Heritage List, which is 31 kilometers away, or in Yenice, 20 km away, due to the daily service.\n\nKeltepe is the new tourism face of Karabük, where not only winter sports but also all kinds of nature and ecotourism activities can be done. The Tree Tunnel Admired by Those Who See It Tree Tunnel The road in the direction of Bartın-Safranbolu is one of the famous spots. As a result of the combination of the trees on the roadside towards the sky, a tunnel image is formed. It is an area that reveals unique views on the Bartın-Karabük road used by tourists coming to Amasra district of Bartın from Safranbolu district of Karabük. The landscape, which is formed by the trees on the left and right of the Bahçecik and Ovacuma villages, covering the road, almost fascinates those who see it. The 9-kilometer road, where the branches of the trees cover the sky, has been declared a \"special area to be protected\". It is recommended for passers-by to take pictures with the magnificent view."
