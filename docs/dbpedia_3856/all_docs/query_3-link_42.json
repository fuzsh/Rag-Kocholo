        "text": "REF: OCHA-GVA-99/0126\n\nTURKEY - EARTHQUAKE\n\nOCHA-GENEVA SITUATION REPORT N0. 10\n\n26 AUGUST 1999, 18:00 GENEVA TIME\n\nGeneral Situation\n\n1. Prime Minister Ecevit informed that the Prime Minister's Crisis Management Centre (PMCMC) revised its casualty figures (12,514 dead and 27,176 injured, as of 25 August) due to an inaccurate report submitted from Kocaeli. Armed Forces puts its own death toll to 545, with 430 injured and 96 persons still buried under the rubble.\n\n2. Quoting the PMCMC, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that 27,394 tents have been set up to date, with the following provincial breakdown:\n\nIzmit: 6,666\n\nSakarya: 5,995\n\nYalova: 5,601\n\nGolcuk: 4,150\n\nBolu: 3,530\n\nIstanbul: 1,352\n\nEskisehir: 100\n\nA new national Crisis Management Centre is now in place in Izmit, which can be reached by telephone: (0262) 332.17.80 (8 lines). The Turkish Delegation at NATO has provided the most updated list of telephone and fax numbers of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs coordination units at the Earthquake Crisis Centre in Ankara:\n\nMFA Earthquake Crisis Desk in Ankara\n\nAmbassador Metin Ornecol - Counsellor Inci Tumay\n\nTel +90-312.284.03.60\n\nFax +90-312-284.29.64/ 05.57\n\n+90-312-286.69.10/ 02.54\n\nMFA Representative in the Prime Ministry Earthquake Crisis Centre in Ankara\n\nTel. +90-312-289.68.15\n\nFax +90-312-289.68.60/ 61 & 27\n\nIstanbul Ataturk Airport\n\nAmbassador Aydemir Erman - Ambassador Fikret Okyayuz\n\nTel. +90-542.264.95.26\n\nFax +90-212.663.69.94\n\n+90-532.658.82.96\n\nIzmit\n\nAmbassador Sukru Tufan\n\nTel. +90-532-736.05.40\n\nAdapazari\n\nAmbassador Ozcan Davaz\n\nTel. +90-532.454.94.22\n\n4. 258 schools are reported to be damaged during the earthquake during which 47 teachers lost their lives. The Education Ministry maintains his initial decision that education in the affected area will start simultaneously with the rest of the country mid-September, to draw children away from life among the ruins.\n\n5. The Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Adapazari reported that 30% of the local industry has been damaged and the one in Kocaeli sent a fax questionnaire to its 11,050 members to collect information on the extent of loss of life and damage. According to Recep Onal, the State Minister in charge of economics affairs, the cost of the earthquake is not of unmanageable dimensions and US$ 10 billion would be enough for recovery. That estimate is based on the fact that most of the buildings, which collapsed in Yalova, were summer houses, and their owners do not require housing. Another positive factor, according to Minister Onal, is that damage to industry is not as big as initially feared, thanks - in part - to the power and water cut for security reasons immediately after the earthquake.\n\nNational Response\n\n6. On 24 August, Reconstruction Minister K. Aydin said that they were planning to build 30,000 prefabricated units in the first instance for 150,000 homeless before winter. However, he noted that the wishes of the affected population, as to where they would like to settle, would have to be ascertained first before taking any irreversible step. Deputy Prime Minister D. Bahceli said that the 15,000 houses currently under construction by the Housing Development Administration, and due to be completed in the months ahead, were going to be allocated to the homeless.\n\nCountry-level International Response\n\n7. UNDP has upgraded its logistical support to the crisis centre in Ankara with additional staff members, computer equipment and five satellite phones.\n\n8. On 25 August, UNFPA delivered to the Kocaeli Health Directorate 5,670 packages of hygienic pads as requested by the Health Ministry.\n\n9. On 25 August, UNDAC and UNDP staff members met with Erol Cakir, Governor of Istanbul. The Governor expressed his appreciation for the rapid response and assistance provided by the international community in general and through the UN, both in Ankara and Istanbul. He stated that more assistance for longer-term recovery and reconstruction would be called for in the coming months.\n\n10. The UNDAC environmental expert was due to return to Izmit on 26 August in order to meet with the Deputy Minister of Environment to further investigate the environmental problems in the Izmit area, including the Tupras refinery. The Ministry of Environment has called for installation of pumping devices for mobile latrines established at campsites, mainly in Izmit, Golcuk, Yalova and Adapazari.\n\n11. UNICEF has provided 8 toilet units with 10 cabinets each for installation in two separate districts of Golcuk.\n\n12. OSOCC Istanbul Reports\n\n13. CIDA has reported that 50 containers of chemical foam have been delivered to Turkey to replenish national stocks and 50 more containers are expected shortly.\n\n14. In Serdivan district of Adapazari, the CIDA DART (with 200 personnel), providing mobile hospital facilities, and water/sanitation and shelter assessment, is now fully operational and intends to remain in situ for maximum 40 days. CIDA reports that there is lack of tents in Serdivan, and that people have been seen using puddle water for cooking. CIDA has provided one purification unit, with a capacity of 100,000 litres in 24 hours, which is now up and running. Two more units are en route. However, it is reported that no further assistance with regard to drinking water is required.\n\n15. A Swiss Disaster Relief (SDR) representative briefed the OSOCC on the involvement of Swiss NGOs in response to the earthquake. He reported that CARITAS Switzerland, working through CARITAS/Turkey, and also in close cooperation with the Anatolian Development Fund (ADF - an organization based outside Ankara), was involved in relief efforts. Moreover, HEKS (a Swiss humanitarian evangelical church organization working closely with the German Diaconic Church, DDK) has reportedly already delivered 10,000 food parcels (providing a month's ration), 3,000 blankets, 6,000 plastic sheets with reinforced holes, 5 refrigerators, 2,500 plastic jerry-cans and 17 small tankers (13 with a 3,000 litres capacity) and 4 with a 4,000 litres capacity) to Adapazari. An organization called Labor Relief (SAH) is also intending to work in Turkey.\n\n16. The OSOCC Istanbul received a briefing from LATET Humanitarian Aid Without Frontiers, an Israeli NGO. Following a preliminary assessment mission in affected areas on 24 August, LATET reported today that 250 homeless persons have been accommodated in a military-provided tent city in Arifiye, the sub-district of Sapanca (Sakarya). Their opinion is that this is a well-organized tent city which has potential to house more people.The tent city \"officials\" reported need for water, sleeping bags, winter coats, purification equipment, gynecologists and pediatricians.\n\nLATET is negotiating with the officials of Adapazari and Bahcecik, Derince (close to Golcuk) the possible set up of their own tents and humanitarian aid distribution network. Bahcecik has some 10.000 homeless according to unverified reports.\n\nAccording to information received from LATET, there are some 3,000 people in tents in Adapazari who, according to Red Crescent officials there, need masks, oil, hygienic pads and dry food.\n\n17. The OSOCC team continued manning the Departure Centre at Istanbul Airport to facilitate exit of SAR teams and, wherever possible, ensuring that use is made of incoming cargo aircraft for outgoing team personnel and equipment.\n\n18. Emphasis has been placed on trying to track and consolidate all available data about the relief goods that have arrived in country, and where they have been delivered to, in order to be able to indicate unmet needs. A list of requirements, as identified by the Prime Minister's Central Crisis Centre in Ankara as of 24 August, has been received by the OSOCC. Further clarification will be needed about quantities and requests for partially affected areas (i.e. Bolu), as well as available stocks and in-country contributions.\n\n19.To date, detailed information in Istanbul has only been obtained regarding Avcilar. Avcilar is a suburb of Istanbul with an estimated population of 400,000 and mainly residential and official buildings. Casualties reported in this district by the local authorities (as of 23 August) total:\n\nDead: 226\n\nInjured: 750\n\nMissing: 500 (unconfirmed)\n\nHomeless: 10,000 (because of uninhabitable houses)\n\nPeople living outside: 50,000 (because of fear of after-shocks - unconfirmed)\n\nHouses destroyed: 28\n\nDemolished by authorities: 22\n\nPartially damaged: 507\n\nDamaged: 227 (uninhabitable)\n\nSeverely damaged: 356 (uninhabitable)\n\nShelter\n\nTent sites are arranged at several points.\n\nWater and Sanitation\n\nThis does not seem to be an area of major concern.\n\nMedical/Health\n\nHospitals are currently free of charge and all injured are getting treated. No sign of contagious diseases. The health sector is cooperating with the University of Istanbul regarding appropriate post-earthquake medical problems and how to prevent outbreak of epidemics.\n\nNeeds\n\nNo acute needs according to local officials.\n\n20. As of 25 August, 36 SAR teams have left the country. It should be noted that in addition to the Turkish Airforce, Turkish Airlines has been receptive and responsive to the travel needs of departing SAR teams.\n\n21. Assessment missions\n\nThree UNICEF teams, accompanied by UNFPA, an OCHA/UNDAC team member and representatives from UNDP and the Prime Minister's Office, carried out a rapid assessment mission 24-25 August to Kocaeli, Golcuk, Saranca, Sakarya, Degirmendere, Yalova, Cinarcik, Mudanya, Bursa, Eskisehir, Golyaka, Duzce, Bolu and Ancilar. While the official report is being issued by UNICEF Ankara, preliminary indications are that urgent relief needs have nearly been covered and that focus needs to turn to winterisation, longer-term shelter (pre-fabricated units and house reconstruction) and the psychological post-trauma needs of those hit by the disaster.\n\nThe International Federation of the Red Cross has an emergency team in Istanbul to support the Turkish Red Crescent Society. Assessment missions were carried out to various affected areas on 24 August.\n\nResults from a US/DART health, water and sanitation assessment mission in Kocaeli province are expected by 27 August.\n\nA four person team from Swiss Disaster Relief, including 2 medics and a water specialist, have just started a 10 day assessment mission in the western part of Golcuk district and south west of Izmit town to look into health, water and sanitation needs during the recovery to reconstruction phase. The results of the mission will serve both the Swiss Government and Swiss NGOs who will launch a coordinated collecting day on 1 September to raise money for response efforts.\n\nProvinces with Districts and Sub-districts located within the area affected by the earthquake\n\nThe following information is provided in order to understand the administrative structure of the affected area and the links existing among the various levels of authority involved.\n\nKOCAELI is the name of the province and IZMIT is the name of the Greater Municipality within KOCAELI.\n\nThe following districts are located within the Greater Municipality of IZMIT:\n\nDerince Korfez Ali Kahya Kosekoy\n\nSaraybahce Bekirpasa Kurucesme Dereli\n\nThe following districts are located within the KOCAELI province - but outside the IZMIT municipality:\n\nGolcuk, Kocaeli:\n\nDegirmendere, Halidere, Sofular, Sevketiye\n\nKaramursel, Kocaeli:\n\nYalakdere, Osmaniye, Guzelyali\n\nKandira, Kocaeli;\n\nGebze, Kocaeli\n\nYALOVA is the province and the name of the Provincial centre.
