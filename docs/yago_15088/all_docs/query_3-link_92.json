Mr. Hagan is a native of Clark County, and one of the self-made men of the city; he is of Scotch-Irish descent, and a descendant of a pioneer family of Mad River Township, his grandfather, Denny Hagan, having settled there in 1814; his parents, Hugh and Ann (Furay) Hagan, were among the early residents of the vicinity of Enon, where Francis M. was born in 1844; his father was a farmer of limited means, and hence his education depended almost entirely upon his own exertions. Impelled by a desire for knowledge, his limited opportunities were carefully improved, and, by teaching district and select schools, during which he was a student, gained sufficient education and means to attend Antioch College, after which he began to read law, but was soon compelled to suspend his studies on account of his health. Up to this time, he had maintained the most rigorous economy, boarding at home while attending Antioch College, requiring a walk of eight miles every day, and afterward, when studying law, \"kept bach.\" The following two or three yeas was occupied in traveling, and in 1872 he had sufficiently recovered to resume his studies, teaching in the meantime. In the spring of 1873, he was admitted to the bar, and has since been in active practice here. In 1876, he was an independent candidate for the office of City Solicitor, his Republican opponent, A. T. Byers, defeating him by only forty-seven votes. In 1879, he was again an independent candidate, and was elected by a majority of 730 over J. F. McGrew, the regular nominee of the Republican Convention. Mr. Hagan is a Democrat in politics, a strong advocate of temperance, takes an active interest in educational affairs, and is an active, public-spirited citizens.\n\nSOURCE: The History of Clark County, Ohio : Publ.

Enon; is a son if Isaac and Eunice Hager, both natives of Massachusetts, and was born Mar. 4, 1823, at Newton Lower Falls, Mass., where he was raised and educated. He started in life at the age of 15 years by engaging in the paper mills of his native town, which were among the oldest in the United States; there remained fifteen years, an in the meantime, Feb. 25, 1847, married Martha Fuller, of Weston, Mass. About 1853, he engaged in the mills of Jordan & Co., where his ability and knowledge of the business merited the position as manager, to which he was promoted. Two years later he removed To Frankfort, Ky., where he was also employed as foreman of the Frankfort paper mills. At the expiration of two years he removed to Lockland, Ohio, and became agent for the Hazeltine Turbine water-wheel, and was the first to introduce it into Southern Ohio, Central Kentucky, and Southern Indiana. After being thus engaged for some time he resumed the paper trade as manager of the Lower Mills of Lockland, where he remained six years; thence located in Dayton, Ohio, where he took charge of the ills of G. Rutledge, and successfully conducted the same a period of two years. He then located in Clifton, Greene Co., Ohio; engaged in business with Mr. King, the style firm being King and Hagar. Six months later he sold his interest, removed to Enon, where he is now in charge of the Republic Mills, and doing a reasonable business. Mr. and Mrs. Hager have had born to them six children - Ellen, Gertrude, Sarah, Mary, Edwin, and Albert, of whom two daughters are deceased.\n\nSOURCE: The History of Clark County, Ohio : Publ. Chicago: W. H. Beers & Co., 1881 - Page 1042 Springfield Twp. -\n\nHENRY HALLENBECK, Justice of the Peace, Springfield. With pleasure we speak of Mr. Hallenbeck in connection with his official position, and also as being one of the elderly and prominent men of Springfield. He has been connected in an official way with the county's interests for many years. He is a native of New York, and was born April, 1815. His parents, Jacob and Elizabeth (Haynes) Hallenbeck, were also natives of that State, as were his parents, Matthias and Margaret Hallenbeck, and their parents. The Esquire is a descendant of one of the first settlers of Albany, N. Y., they emigrating from Holland in 1610, bringing their own ships, laden with agricultural implements, and brick to build their houses, and to this day can be seen the piles of brick that were brought from Holland more than two centuries ago. Jacob and Elizabeth Hallenbeck were parents of eight children, only two of whom are now living - our subject and his sister, Nancy Currey, who lives near Buffalo, N. Y. on February, 1836. Their eldest daughter, Julia E., is the wife of Eliphlet Cots, Principal of the Southern Building, Springfield, Ohio. She was born i New York previous to the removal of her parents, which occurred in 1840, they driving in their own conveyance from their home in that State to this beautiful city which, at that time, was a village of 850 inhabitants. From 1842 to 1846, Mr. Hallenbeck served as Deputy Sheriff under Absolom Maddox; in 1848, he was elected Sheriff and served two terms. During the war he was employed in the mail service and previously engaging in the stock and grocery business. From 1865 to 1870, he was traveling agent for the Springfield Rock Paint Company. He also established the manufactory of Whetstone Bros., manufacturers of colors. In 1870, he started for Missouri determined to open up a farm; he tried valiantly for four years, and finding it a losing business, sold out and came back to Springfield. In April, 1877, he was elected Justice of the Peace, and was re-elected in April, 1880. As an official his judgment is excellent, and his friends are legion; as a public-spirited citizen, he is ever at the front; his integrity is unquestioned, and is one of our practical men - loving right and hating wrong. We are glad to have this opportunity of perpetuating his name in the history of this county, of which he has been so long a resident. Two sons, William H. and John G. Hallenbeck, reside in Kansas City; Augusta Diefendorf and Clara Barker, their two daughters, live near Leavenworth, Kan. Many things of interest to the readers of this history has been gleaned from Esquire Hallenbeck, and we are sure that facts furnished by him extending over a forty years' residence in Springfield, may he regarded as correct.\n\nSOURCE: The History of Clark County, Ohio : Publ. Chicago: W. H. Beers & Co., 1881 - Page 833 Springfield Twp. -\n\nJAMES SMITH HALSEY, deceased, was born near Lebanon, Warren Co., Ohio, Dec. 7, 1894, and was the son of Ichabod Benton Halsey, a native of New Jersey. The family is of English origin, and it is believed that all of the name now living in this country are descendants of two brothers of that name, who landed at Long Island some time near the beginning of the eighteenth century, and the branch of the family to which the subject of this sketch belonged settled near Wheatsheaf Tavern, midway between Rahway and Elizabeth township, N. J., where they lived for a number of generations. Maj. Daniel Halsey, the grandfather of James S., received from the Government a large tract of land near Lebanon, Warren Co., in consideration of services performed as an officer in the Revolution, which land he presented to his son, Ichabod B., on the condition that he would settle upon and improve it, which he did, becoming one of the earliest settlers of Warren County. He was remarkable for intelligence, energy and great probity of character, and was one of hte Commissioners who located the county seats of Green, Montgomery and Champaign Counties. Mr. Halsey became one of the wealthiest and most prosperous citizens of this county, but late in life, through the treachery of a party for whom he had indorsed, the results of a lifetime of industry, was swept away at one stroke. The mother of James Smith Halsey was the daughter of James Smith, a Methodist minister, who came from Virginia to Warren Co., Ohio, about 1790, where he had previously been in company with two or three friends on a tour of observation, about 1785, his object being to secure for himself and family a home in a land uncursed by slavery. He finally settled on a farm not far from Caesar's Creek, in Warren County, and it was there that his daughter, Saraah Watkins Smith, was married to Ichabod Benton Halsey, Dec. 25, 1802. At the time of his father's financial distress, James Smith Halsey was about 18 years of age, had received a fair common-school education, and had become fairly proficient in Latin, with a general fund of information acquired from books for which eh had a great fondness. About this time he came to Springfield and secured employment in the office of Saul Henkle, Sr., who was then Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas of Clark County. The distance of forty miles form Lebanon to Springfield was performed on foot, it being before the time of railroads, and the payment of stage fare would have been too great a strain on his scanty resources. During this period he worked for $6 per month and board, sending to his father at the end of the year the sum of $72. The first official position he held in Clark County was Justice of hte Peace, was subsequently elected County Auditor, then appointed Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas, and on the adoption of the new constitution, in 1852, was elected Probate Judge. He was married Nov. 13, 1832, to Catharine T. Henkle, daughter of Saul Henkle who, with his wife, whose maiden name was Van Meter, were Virginians. They had four children who grew to maturity, viz.: Martha A., who died in Springfield; Irving, now an attorney residing in Cincinnati; Ellen Sterrit, deceased, and Sarah L., the wife of Loui8s W. Bosart, of Springfield. Mrs. Halsey died in 1862, at Lagonda, of softening of the brain; she was a woman of unusual energy, of excellent mental gifts, and thoughtfully devoted to her husband and children; during the greater part of her life she, as well as her husband, was a member of hte Baptist Church. After the expiration of his term as Probate Judge, Mr. Halsey removed from Springfield to a place near Lagonda, where he resided until 1865, and after a brief residence on a place about two miles east of Springfield, on the National road, he removed with his son-in-law and daughter, Mr. and Mrs. Bosart, to Jasper Co., Ill., where he lived until the summer of 1875, when he, with his daughter Martha, went to Memphis, Tenn., where his son Irving then lived, with whom he resided until his death, which occurred on the night before the seventy-third anniversary of his birthday, in December, 1877. His remains were brought to Springfield and interred in the family lot in Green Mount Cemetery. For several years preceding his death, he was afflicted with symptoms of softening of the brain, and of this disease he finally died. Judge Halsey was of a modest, retiring nature, preferring the seclusion of private life to the conflicts attending a public career, and although a somewhat zealous partisan, he was never prominently concerned in politics; and with the exception of an editorial connection with the Western Pioneer, he probably took no active part in political matters. His talents were those of the student and lover of nature rather than of a man of action, but few men collected and retained more information than he during the period of his mental activity, and before the powers of his mind had been partially paralyzed by disease, and even afterward the singular retention of his memory often surprised his friends. Probably the characteristics by which Judge Halsey was most prominently known were his unswerving integrity and love of truth. In every transaction of his life, his word was his bond; even in jest he never deviated from the right line of truth, and whatever \"Smith\" Halsey said was known to be the exact truth, and as he never lied himself he had little toleration for falsehood in others. He had an innate scorn of meanness, mendacity and sham, which was as natural to him as it was to breathe the vital air. His charity was large, and while giving unostentatiously, he gave munificently; indeed in everything he did there was an entire absence of ostentation, and next to dishonesty and fraud, it was probably the object of his profoundest contempt. His religion partook, as it always must, of the character of the man; like him, it was unobtrusive and unostentatious, and what Burns calls the \"preaching cant,\" was never heard on his lips, and instead of talking religion he tried to act it. Like all strong natures, although sincere in his religion, he had his religious doubts which caused him many melancholy hours, yet in the spirit of \"Lord, I would believe, help thou my unbelief,\" he struggled faithfully to the end. His character was somewhat marked by the austerity of the Puritan; life to him was no holiday affair, but a time of work and not of pleasure, and it can be said to his credit that he did his work well. He was also somewhat puritanical in his habitual expression of emotion, but that he felt strongly and deeply, is certain; men like him always do; but he did not \"carry his heart on his sleeve for daws to peck at,\" and the many friends whom he has left behind in Clark County demonstrate that he was held in the highest esteem throughout this county, of which he was so long an honored and trusted citizen. Judge Halsey had two brothers and three sisters who lived to maturity: J. B. Halsey, who died in Plymouth, Ind., in January, 1879, and Daniel W. Halsey, who died in Hamilton, Ohio, about 1860, were both citizens of Springfield for many years; Mary E. was married to Gen. Charles Anthony, and died in the summer of 1879; Martha, who married Dr. Isaac Jennings, is now living in Kosciusko Co., Ind., and Cynthia A., who was married to James K. Hurin, is now residing at Wyoming, Hamilton, Ohio.\n\nSOURCE: The History of Clark County, Ohio : Publ. Chicago: W. H. Beers & Co., 1881 - Page 836\n\nJ. W. Hanes Mad River Twp. -\n\nJ. W. HANES, grain merchant; P. O. Enon. Enon, like all villages, has its reprehensive business men, and we can say that J. W. Hanes is one of the live and energetic men of this village. He is the son of Jacob and Margaret Hanes, and was born June 25, 1840, in Richland Co., Ohio; received his early education in the common schools, afterwards two years in attendance at the Antioch College, at Yellow Springs, Ohio. In 1864, commenced work on his father's farm, and thus continued until 27 years of age, when he commenced life for himself, by commencing in the grain trade in Enon. Here he has, through proper conduct and good business habits, established a favorable and profitable grain market. In July, 1874, married Emma Spangler, an accomplished young lady. This issue of this union is two children, one son and one daughter.\n\nSOURCE: The History of Clark County, Ohio : Publ. Chicago: W. H. Beers & Co., 1881 - Page 1042 Mad River Twp. -\n\nN. HARDMAN, merchant; P. O. Enon; is the son of Peter and Margaret Hardman. Peter was born in Virginia and Margaret in Scotland. Peter Hardman married early in life Miss Margaret Hacker, who ten years previous, when she was 11 years of age, being at the house of her sister, on Hacker's Creek, near Clarksburg, Va., was tomahawked and scalped by the Indians. It seems that a marauding party of Indians was passing through the neighborhood, and attacked the family with whom she was staying, all the members of which were slain. Young Miss Hacker managed to conceal herself behind a door while the work of death was going on, but was finally discovered by one of the savages, who aimed a blow at her with his tomahawk, which took effect upon the side of her head; she fell and laid as if killed. Thinking their work of death complete, they scalped all the members of the family, and dragged the little girl after them from the house by the hair for some fifty yards, where they scalped her and threw her over a fence; observing that she gave signs of life, one of the savages stabbed her with his knife, which fortunately struck a rib, doing but little harm. She was afterward found and cared for, and recovered, although she suffered greatly, and finally died in her 39th year, from the effect of the tomahawk wound on her head. The subject of this memoir was born in Greene Co., Ohio, Jan. 3, 1813; never received but about three months of schooling. At the age of 18 years, started in life for himself by driving state from Springfield to Cincinnati, then from Springfield to Columbus, and other lines. Those were days before use of the powerful and useful railroad engine was seen swiftly passing through our land, and travelers then spent weeks and months to complete a journey that is now made in a few short hours. In 1836, married, abandoned stage driving, and engaged in blacksmithing, which he followed a period of five years in West Union, thence located in Enon, Clark County, where he continued his trade until April, 1870, at which time he was taken severely ill, and remained an invalid for eighteen months; reduced his weight from 176½ pounds to 41 pounds, hence was a mere skeleton of the human being. At the time of his marriage, could neither read, write, or calculate the smallest sum in arithmetic; but since his wife began to instruct him, and through his own energy and industry, and her sincere and earnest efforts, he has learned all this, and now is a fair business man. He has always been an earnest worker in the Republican party from its organization. He is now, and has been for five years, Mayor of his village, and had the honor of be in Chief Marshal of the Centennial celebration of the \"Battleground of Old Piqua,\" on Aug. 9, 1880.\n\nSOURCE: The History of Clark County, Ohio : Publ.

His father being a tradesman in limited circumstances, his early years were o trenched upon to aid in maintaining the family that his opportunities for education were greatly abridged. In August, 1862, he responded to his country' call for aid in arm, and enlisted as a private in Company I, 110th O V. I.; met the enemy at Winchester, Spottsylvania, the Wilderness, and other hotly-contested fields of blood, until Apr. 10, 1865, when, having been disabled by several gunshot wounds, he was honorably discharged and returned to civil life. Years of his life calculated by nature for education having been spent in arms in the service of his country, he now, on his return, attended a common school, taught by Prof. W. S. Grimm, in what is known as the Reed Schoolhouse. He next during a period of four years, taught school in this and Champaign Counties, and then entered Wittenberg College, where he pursued his studies until the full expiration of the junior year. His parents having previously removed to Bellefontaine, Ohio, he located there and commenced the study of medicine in the office of Dr. Pratt, under whom he studied on year, then took one course of lectures in Cincinnati Medical College, and completed his professional preparation and graduated in Columbus Medical College in the spring of 1876. He located and opened an office in Clifton, this county, where he has since remained; has built himself a commodious and neat residence and office, which evince his industry, professional efficiency and success. On May 23, 1871, while a freshman in college, he was joined in marriage to Miss M. Belle, youngest daughter of Squire Anthony and Maria Wallace Bird, of Springfield Township, this county. The issue of this marriage is James Howard and Martha Mabel, aged respectively 7 and 4 years.\n\nSOURCE: The History of Clark County, Ohio : Publ. Chicago: W. H. Beers & Co., 1881 - Page 1049 Springfield Twp. -\n\nJOHN K. HARRIS, Springfield; is one of the few men who have combined inventive genius with successful business management; he is a native of Switzerland Co., Ind., born in 1822. At the age of 17, he left the parental roof and began the battle of life without means or influential friends. The latter, however, he soon secured, and through the aid of J. F. D. Lanier, a banker of Madison, Ind., he obtained two years' tuition at the college then conducted at Madison. During the two years following, by teaching and assisting in the bank, he secured a fair education, and in the meantime, by economy and industry, had repaid his benefactor and accumulated a little surplus capital. About this time he became interested in patents, which led to his experimenting and the development of inventive genius. A mowing machine with adjustable cutter bar, and probably the first harvesting machine to which the adjustable principle had been applied was among his first inventions, but his principal success was in connection with a hay press, known as the \"Beater Hay Press,\" which, though originally the invention of a neighbor, subsequently became the property of Mr. Harris, after which he so improved it as to make it more practical and portable, and finally, after years of labor and perseverance, achieved great success in the sale first of the presses and afterward of the patent, by which he realized a clean $100,000. A description of this press may not be uninteresting to the readers. We can give no better than to copy the main clause of hte claim upon which the letters patent were issued, viz., \"Filling the press-box with the substance to be pressed into bales, by means of a beater or driver raised by machinery and made to descend upon the substance in the box, successively by gravity, whether effected in the manner described or in any other mode analagous thereto.\" This press still maintains its standing for excellence, and is in very general use. After the close of the war, Mr. Harris removed to Springfield, having purchased the handsome residence property No. 265 North Limestone street*, which has since been his home. During the past year, he has invented a button-hole attachment for sewing machines, which he is now perfecting and which will undoubtedly come into very general use, as it is very simple in construction and can be furnished at a moderate cost, and may be adjusted to any of the standard machines. Mr. Harris is now close to 60, but is still active, and though he has been all his life engaged in the invention, handling and sale of patents, he has never had a law suit in connection therewith. He at one time released as square and legal title, which he purchased of an agent handling Howe's Sewing Machines, upon Mr. Howe's representation that, while the agent had a legal right to dispose of the \"right,\" it was by reason of a technical error, the intention being to grant power to sell machines only. Thus he allowed a fortune to pass from his grasp for a nominal sum, out of regard for the rights of a brother inventor. Mr. Harris has always been a reliable temperance man, and for many years a member of hte Presbyterian Church, his present membership being with the first church of this city. HE has been twice married, his first wife, nee Jane Patten, was also a native of Switzerland Co., Ind., and bore him five children, the youngest of whom, a son, died of accidental injury a short time previous to the decease of the mother, which occurred in 1870. Three daughters and a son survives, viz., Mrs. Charles M. Safford, of Cleveland; Mrs. B. P. Thiebaud, of Mt. Auburn; and Miss Anna M. and John Edward, who are members of the present household. Mr. Harris' present wife, was Miss Hanna L. Phillips, is a native of Indiana. Their marriage was celebrated at Moore's Hill, Ind., in 1872.\n\nSOURCE: The History of Clark County, Ohio : Publ.

Beers & Co., 1881 Madison Twp. -\n\nLABAN W. HAUGHEY, dealer in real estate; South Charleston. Among the solid, substantial business men of Clark Co., L. W. Haughey stands deservedly high; a man of enterprising character, whose integrity and honesty in all the relations of life have never been questioned, we are pleased to be able to represent him in the pages of this work. His grandfather, Thomas Haughey, a native of Ireland, came to the American Colonies before the Revolutionary war; settling in Virginia, where he was married, of which union were eleven children - John the father of Laban W., being the eldest. He was born in Grayson Co., Va., Jan. 2, 1787, and was there married to Patience Sturdyven a native of the same county, born in 1792, and in 1810, came to Clinton Co., Ohio, the town of Wilmington, being now partly built upon the land which he owned. Thomas Haughey was a Revolutionary solder, and helped to humiliate the hereditary foe of his native land; and soon after John came to Ohio, he also came, settled in Clinton Co., removing thence to Greene Co., where he resided until his death. In 1818, John and family also removed to Greene Co., settling south of Jamestown, in Silver Creek Township, he and wife spending the balance of their days in that county, she dying in November, 1872, and her husband in April, 1876. The subject of this sketch was born in Clinton Co., Ohio, Oct. 13, 1811, and was the second in a family of twelve children, as follows: James N., Laban W., Sarah J., Ann, Lourenna, Churchwell M., Elizabeth, Nancy, John Q. A., Thomas J., Calvin A. and an infant unnamed; Sarah J. and six brothers are the survivors. Laban W. grew to manhood in Greene Co., receiving a limited education in the log schoolhouse of the pioneer days, and following farming as his general occupation. He was married in that county Nov. 17, 1841, to Cynthia Larkin, a native of the county, born Apr. 2, 1819, and the third in a family of seven children. She is the daughter of David and Nancy (Harper) Larkin, natives of Maryland where he was born Dec. 5, 1787, and she Oct. 7,1792, both being old families of that State, \"Harper's Ferry\" receiving its name from her family. They were married in Maryland Feb. 14, 1810,and soon afterward moved to Ohio, settling finally in Greene Co., coming in 1849 to South Charleston, where he is now residing, with his daughter Mrs. Haughey, his wife having died Jan. 28, 1881, a sincere member of the M. E. Church, after a union of seventy years, eleven months and fourteen days, an event almost unparalleled in the annals of married life. Mr. Haughey began life on his individual resources, and made a success from the first, owning a nice farm before his marriage, which he made by his own industry. In Jan., 1850, he came to South Charleston, and began dealing in grain and produce, in partnership with his father-in-law, this lasting four years, after which he followed stock-trading and money-loaning. In 1863, he was instrumental in establishing the First National Bank of South Charleston, upon the organization of which he was elected its President, occupying this position until its charter was surrendered, Mar. 24, 1877, the bank continuing as a private institution. For about fourteen years he has been a member of the M. E. Church, of which his wife has been a life-long adherent, and he has taken an active interest in the prosperity of Methodism throughout the county; has been in official position the whole period, and helped all churches regardless of creed. Every public movement found in him an active and hearty supporter, and he is recognized as one of the public benefactors of South Charleston. Politically, a Republican, he was an earnest upholder of the Union cause, giving his time and money to support the Government in that crisis, and to take care of the families of the soldiers in the field. He is a member of the I. O. F., and was a Director in the School Board for about fifteen years; he is one of the Directors of the Mad River National Bank of Springfield; is the owner of 242 acres of land in Fayette Co., Ohio, and 900 in Indiana, beside property in South Charleston and Springfield, and is one of the wealthy men of this portion of Ohio.

This county contains few more active men in everything that pertains to its general welfare than the well-known physician and fine stock breeder whose name stands at the head of this sketch; he is recognized by all good citizens as a man of talent, and skill in his profession, as well as a valuable help to the farming community by encouraging and stimulating them in the growth and improvement of fine stock, and his efforts in this direction are so well known and appreciated, that it is unnecessary for us in this sketch to say more about them. Dr. Hazzard was born on the eastern shore of Maryland Jan. 21, 1827, and is the son of Cord and Mary P. (Rankin) Hazzard, the former a native of Delaware, and a relative of Gov. Hazzard, of that State; also of Com. Ferry of Erie renown, and his wife of Maryland, where they were married and had born to them four children, viz., Mary, Sally, Theodore and J. S. R. Hazzard, Theodore Dying in childhood. Dr. Hazzard's mother died when he was an infant, and he was brought up under the care of his maternal relatives; his father was a wealthy merchant and slave-holder of Maryland, and entering the political arena was elected Sheriff of his county, but, falling a victim to the intemperate customs of that day, he lost all his property, leaving his children penniless. After paying every cent of his losses to the county, he abandoned his intemperate habits, and became a rigid temperance man, liberated his slaves, and was so trusted and respected throughout the county, that he held official position during the remainder of his life, dying Judge of the Orphans' Court in 1849. The Doctor's early education was obtained at Snow Hill Academy, Worcester Co., Md., and, in 1843, he came to Clark Co., Ohio, and resided with his uncle, James Rankin, four years, at the end of which time he entered the office of Dr. Solon Curtice, of Vienna, and, in the winter of 18490-50, attended lectures at the Medical Department of the Western Reserve College, Cleveland, Ohio, and, in April, 1850, he began practice in partnership with Dr. Joseph Orr, at Harmony. The Doctor received a diploma from the State Medical Society in 1864; he graduated from the Western Reserve College in 1870, and from the Cincinnati College of Medicine and Surgery in 1874, from which can be gathered that he medical training has been extensive and varied, and has well fitted him for the successful practice of his profession, in which he has been engaged since April, 1850, a continuous practice extending over thirty-one years, and he has lived in the same neighborhood the whole period with the exception of a short experience as a druggist of Springfield in 1866-67. He was married, Jan. 19, 1854, to Mary E. Price, daughter of the Rev. Thomas J. and Julia (Corwin) Price, who was born in Clark County Aug. 12, 1832. Her grandfather, James Price, settled in Harmony Township in 1820, and her father who was a native of Wales, was the well-known Baptist minister who lived on Sec. 4, south of Dr. Hazzard's present home, and who died in Champaign Co., Ohio, Apr. 15, 1876. Her mother was a sister of Moses Corwin, of Urbana, and she died Apr. 15, 1856. To Dr. Hazzard and wife have been born two children - Frank Corwin and Mary Julia, and he and wife belong to the Presbyterian Church. In 1867, he purchased his farm of 170 acres, remodeled the house, which is located on a beautiful hill overlooking the surrounding country, and here he devotes himself diligently to his profession, and in the growing of thoroughbred short-horn cattle, of which he is a recognized judge and authority, having been President of the Agricultural Society for about seven years. In 1864, he became a member of the Clark County Medical Society, and the same year was one of the delegates sent from Ohio to the Convention of the National Medical Association held at Washington; he was elected President of the society in 1867, and is also a member of the State Medical Society. Politically, a Republican. He is a man well fitted to represent the county in any capacity; of suave, pleasant manners, a well versed and agreeable conversationalist, temperate in all things, possessing a strong, robust physique, a picture of prefect health, no obstacle could successfully intervene between him and his duty. Indomitable courage and industry are also well-known traits of his character, and whatever he undertakes to accomplish he perseveringly pursues with all the energy of a strong nature, which generally leads to success. In all things he is strictly honorable, and is ever a hearty friend and boon companion whom every one admires and respects.\n\nSOURCE: The History of Clark County, Ohio : Publ. Chicago: W. H.

This property was improved by erecting new buildings and machinery, and reconstructing the old, until there was in operation a large flouring mill, a saw-mill and a distillery. In 1853, Mr. Hertzler sold this property and removed to Springfield, where he established the \"Old Clark County Bank,\" and became associated therein with several well-known business men. As principal owner and general manager of this bank, he became one of the strong moneyed men of the Mad River country. This bank, however, was not of long duration, and the circumstances of its winding up its business affairs are often related as an illustration of Mr. Hertzler's character as an individual. A certain railroad was in need of funds, and commenced to negotiate with the junior members of the concern, in the absence of Mr. Hertzler, for the purpose of obtaining the money. Now these bankmen had more to say than to do, in the way of real capital, and were easily captured by the managers of the railroad. The result was that about $30, 000 of the substance of the bank went out, and a like amount of railroad shadow came in to fill its place. Upon the return of Mr. Hertzler, he was met by the information that \"we\" had made an advantageous investment, etc., whereupon he says: \"Gentlemen, you should have consulted with me in this matter; but, as this railroad paper is first class (?), you can take it as your portion of this institution, and we will stop business.\" This was accordingly done, and the business relation of the Clark County Bank (as well as that of some of its former partners) to this community caused. Mr. Hertzler had purchased lands in Bethel, and in 1854-55 he erected the farm buildings at present held in trust by Leander Baker, and situated on nearly the same ground where the old Indian stockade was located. This was occupied by him as a home, and was the scene of the tragic affair which resulted in his death. Between the hours of 2 and 3 o'clock on the morning of Oct. 10, 1867, his house was entered by a party of burglars. Mr. Hertzler was promptly awakened, and a conflict ensued, which resulted fatally to him from a gun-shot wound in the leg. Four persons were arrested for this crime - two were acquitted, and two others (Scott and Roberts) escaped through the open door of the jail, and have never been recaptured.\n\nSOURCE: The History of Clark County, Ohio : Publ.

He is the son of John and Sarah (Marsteller) Hess; was born in Lancaster Co., Penn., Sept. 12, 1813; came to Ohio and located in this county in 1838; his parents were both natives of Pennsylvania. When John was 10 years old, his father died, leaving the mother and nine children. At the age of 12, John went to live with his uncle, where he remained until 18 years old, when he went to learn the carpenter's trade at which he worked eight years, but has followed farming since living in Ohio. He was married, Sept. 11, 1839, to Sibbia Mills; their issue was eight children, viz., Sarah J., Thomas M. Martha, Nancy E., Mary J., Maria Ann, Sibbia Ann and John L., all living except Mary J. His wife died Apr. 1, 1861, and in April, 1869, he was again married, this time to Mrs. Frances E. (Maxwell) Knaub, widow of John Knaub, deceased. Mr. Hess started in life with $250, which he received from his father's estate, and, by his industry and economy, has accumulated property until now he owns over 100 acres of good land. His father's people were by creed Mennonites, and his mother's people were Lutherans, but Mr. Hess is a member of the Methodist Protestant Church, and has been Class-leader, Steward and Trustee of that church some twenty years.

The fact that his management is satisfactory to so able a mechanical engineer as Mr. Bauer, the superintendent, is evidence that his natural skill and ability was cultivated during the years of his experience with the different large works with which he has at different times been connected, and stamp him as a man of more than ordinary mechanical ability and experience. He is also a member of the firm of Tabler & Hickey. Mr. Hickey married, Oct. 27, 1870, Florence Tidball, of Zanesville; they have four children. SOURCE: The History of Clark County, Ohio : Publ.

Mr. Crispin was about 70 years of age when his last marriage occurred, yet he lived to raise a second family of four children and see all grown to majority, he being 101 years old at his death, which occurred near South Charleston, he having removed there along with the Holloways. Mr. Holloway, Sr., was Justice of Madison Townships twenty-two years; he was a member of the Board of Commissioners a number of terms; his first election occurred in 1834. He was one of the most intelligent as well as prominent citizens of his time, and continued to reside in Madison Township until his decease, in 1842. The subject of this sketch was born near Chillicothe in 1812; he remained on the farm, assisting his parents, until 18 years of age, then came to Springfield to learn the carpenter's trade; after completing his apprenticeship, his \"boss\" took him into partnership, and he continued in the business a number of years, but his health failed, in consequence of which his accumulations were being consumed. About 1845, very much against the judgment of friends, he engaged in the livery business, and, although in feeble health and debt at the start, in eight years sold out, having accumulated $10,000, and, what was still better, regained his health. After a short interval, he again engaged in the livery business, and has since continued it, now having his oldest son, Christie, associated with him.

He has three sons (one of whom has newly arrived) and one daughter; of the former, the elder is pursuing a collegiate course at Wittenberg College; the second, with his father in his insurance office in the Bookwalter Block; the third has just made his debut on the stage of existence. Our subject is a thoroughly self-made man; has fought his way up to an enviable position in his business, and of affluence, by his own unaided exertions and strength of purpose. He commenced the insurance business in 1865, as Secretary of the Springfield Fire Insurance Company of Springfield, thus continuing until November, 1870, at which time the company closed its business honorably by re-insuring its risks in the Dayton Insurance Company, giving its stockholders in the aggregate some %60,000 for an investment of $20,000 during a period of six years. Since this event, Mr. Hosterman has conducted a general insurance business on his own account, representing, among others, the following companies: Phoenix of Brooklyn; Watertown of New York; St. Paul of St. Paul, Minn.; Mechanics' & Traders' of New York; Westchester of New York; Landon Assurance Corporation of London; Rhode Island Insurance Association of Providence; Miami Valley Company of Dayton; and the Dayton Insurance Company, of the same city; Star of New York; Aurora of Cincinnati, Ohio; and of Mutuals, the Richland, and Mansfield, of Mansfield, Ohio; Buckeye of Shelby, and the Forest City and Van Wert Companies.

Huffman and Driscol are young men possessed of culture, native skill and energy, as is proven by the extent of their practice, built up in a short a time. Dr. Huffman is the only one now here of six young physicians who located in Springfield in 1878. The fact that he was born and raised here speaks volumes in favor of his character, both as a citizen and a physician for \"A prophet is not without honor save in his own country,\" does not apply in his case.

This was shortly after the destruction of the tea in Boston Harbor. Dr. Hunt's mother, Anne Brewster, was a great-granddaughter of Elder William Brewster, who came over in the Mayflower. Dr. Hunt studied medicine in New Jersey and in 1807, he, with some friends, came to Cincinnati, where he learned that there was no physician in Springfield, and that the country was settling rapidly; so in that year he came here and commenced practice: he boarded at Griffith Foos tavern, and rode far and near, with no roads but Indian trails or cow paths: in 1812 he was appointed surgeon of the 2d Regiment, 4th Brigade, 1st Division of Ohio militia, which regiment was commanded by Col. John Dougherty. Dr. Hunt was present at the council with the Indians where Tecumseh refused to disarm the Indians, and is said to have been the one who offered that chief the clay pipe which was so indignantly refused. The grove where this council was held was the property of Dr. Hunt. (It was a little west and south of what is now known as Vone & Blees brewery.) He lived to see great changes in the little log towns. In 1818, he wrote to a friend: Our county last winter was divided into three, and Springfield was made a seat of justice of one. viz., Clark County, though as yet we have no court house. We have four public houses, eleven stores, three physicians, three attorneys, and mechanics of every description: one mill alone in this town manufactures thirty barrels of flour per day: one speculator has sent this season, from this county, 1,300 barrels of flour and 300 barrels of pork to the Orleans market. Dr. Hunt died in Springfield on the 24th day of January, 1848.\n\nNote. - This is the Dr. Hunt mentioned by Drake, in his Life of Tecumseh, and the same is found in connection with several other historical papers, showing that the subject of the above sketch was a contributor to the collections of his day.\n\nSOURCE: The History of Clark County, Ohio : Publ.

They had the following children: John, William, Jeremiah, Jonathan, George, James, Elizabeth, Nancy, Mary and Rachel, all of whom are now dead. Blanche, the mother of our subject, was the daughter of William and Susan (Taylor) Hendricks, natives of Virginia, who settled in Sec. 28, Pleasant Township, in 1804. Here she died, and her husband moved to Champaign Co., where he remained until death.

Jonathan, Vincent, Mary Ann (the wife of Nathan Neer) and Miranda (the deceased wife of John Sager, of Union Co., Ohio). Both belonged to the M. E. Church, and died in that faith. The subject of this sketch grew up in his native township, attending the primitive log schoolhouse of early days, farming and using his strength for the work of clearing and breaking the new ground. He was married, Mar. 1, 1838, to Nancy Marsh, who was born on the farm where Mr. Hunter now lives, Oct. 6, 1816. She was the daughter of Israel and Sarah Marsh, natives of New Jersey, who moved North Carolina where they were married, and from whence they moved to Champaign Co., Ohio, in an early day. They came to Pleasant Township in 1811, where they died, he Sept. 5, 1842, aged 71 years, both being in the Baptist Church until their death.

Hodge), William, Lewis (deceased), Sarah J. (the deceased wife of James H. Yeazell), Eli, Miranda E. (also deceased wife of James H. Yeazell) and Bruce (deceased). Mr. Hunter has always lived in this township. In politics he is a Republican, and has been Township trustee two years. He owns 700 acres of land in Pleasant Township, and 290 in Moorefield Township. He is an extensive stock-raiser, and the largest portion what he now owns is the result of his own indusrty, economy and shrewd business sagacity. He is a man of few words, but many deeds.

He continued \"wagoning\" for five years after he came to this county, making four trips across the mountains, once to Philadelphia, and three times to Baltimore; and the remainder of the time between Columbus and Cincinnati; since then has devoted his attention to farming. He was married Feb. 19, 1839, to Martha Kirkpatrick, daughter of Hugh and Rachel (Kelly) Kirkpatrick.

Our subject is the son of Nathaniel and Rachael (Kelly) Huntington. There is an incident in the relationship of William that is worthy or notice. As appears, the maiden name of both his and his first wife's mother was Rachael Kelly, but they were not related to each other. Mr. Huntington was a member of the Presbyterian Church for twenty-three years, and in 1866 removed his membership to the Methodist Episcopal Church of which he is still a member.\n\nSOURCE: The History of Clark County, Ohio : Publ.
