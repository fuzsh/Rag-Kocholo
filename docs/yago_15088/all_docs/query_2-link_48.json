        "meta_description": "Scope/Content: Manuscript annotations in printed book.Scope/Content: Manuscript annotations by J.L. Rawcliffe on the blanks of the 1742 edition of Joseph Warder's Monarchy of Bees.  Annotations on the front and rear endpapers consist of long passages from Thomas Wildman's Treatise on the Management of Bees, while a large portion of John Thorley's Female Monarchy is written on about 108 pages bound in at the end of the Warder text.  There are also several other passages and recipes following the Thorley transcription, including a recipe for mead and Dinsdale's poem on bees.  All of these transcribed passages appear to be in the same hand as the inscribed \"J.L. Rawcliffe\" on the title page.  The manuscript transcription of Thorley is dated November 24, 1743.Condition: Bound in quarter leather (rebacked in 2001) with marbled boards.",
