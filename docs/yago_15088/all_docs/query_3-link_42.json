        "text": "In July 1905 William Henry Clark, then approximately 80 years old, published a booklet titled Genealogy of the Clark and Pace Families in which he set down what he recalled about his Clark and Pace ancestors, as well as many of their relations.\n\nI have transcribed Mr. Clark's account from a photocopy of the original booklet. While every effort has been made to insure an accurate transcription, errors may have crept in. Mr. Clark provided a wealth of dates and places information within this small booklet. We are grateful to him for his dedication and his memory.\n\nWhere it has been determined that Mr. Clark made factual errors, you will find a note in brackets and in red print. Brackets and red print have also been used to mark places where additional information has been added from my research and the research of others. When I have a link to another page with additional information, the link will be in green print. Finally, I have taken the liberty of creating new paragraphs to make the copy easier to read.\n\nThis transcription, and all of the notes attached to it, may be freely copied and used for personal genealogical study. Neither the transcription nor any of the notes may be sold, nor included in any collection prepared for sale.\n\nWe welcome suggestions, corrections, and additional information regarding the individuals named within.\n\nMy grandfather Henry Clark married Willie Ann Nunn; to them were born eight children, five sons and three daughters, they lived in Henry county Virginia. [According to Henry Clark's will, transcribed here, they had nine children identified as \"Jonathan, Elizabeth, James, Nancy, Frances, Jacob, Ruth, Joseph & Samuel.\"]\n\nJoseph Clark, eldest son [actually fourth son and eighth child] of Henry and Willie Ann Clark, married Elizabeth D. Pace. Samuel Clark married Nancy G. Pace, as you will see in the Pace genealogy. James Clark married and had two daughters. One of them married Dr. White who died; if living, his widow and children are in Louisville.\n\nJonathan Clark married [Patsy Hensley, 2 Jan 1813, in Henry County VA] and had six [perhaps as many as nine] children. One of his daughters married a Mr. Shaw and had a family. [Lucy Clark married James Shaw in Barren County on 10 Jun 1847. (See Sandi Gorin's book, Marriage Records of Barren County 1850-1860.)] Eliza married but I don't know anything more about them [Eliza was still single, and living with her parents in the 1860 Metcalfe County KY census (page 123, household 839)].\n\nHenry Clark, son of Jonathan, married and lived on Clay Lick creek until his death. He left several children. [This appears to be be Henry Clark who married Nancy Edwards on 16 Feb 1842 in Barren County KY. (Barren County Marriage Book by Martha Powell Harrison, page 45) They appear in the 1850 Barren County census (1850 Federal Census: Kentucky, Barren County, District 2, household 299/304) with two children: Maria and John. In the 1860 census (1860 Federal Census: Kentucky, Metcalfe County, page 126, household 843), they had 5 children: Maria, John, Henry, Jonathan, and Nancy.]\n\nCap Clark, son of Jonathan Clark, married and lived on Clay Lick creek [According to Carolyn Murphy, Cap was a nickname for Edmund. Also, there is an Edmund Clark living next door to James Clark (see below) in the 1870 Metcalfe County KY census. He is married to a Lucinda, and they have 5 children: Mary, Lucy, William, Morris, and Laura. Also living with them is Edmond's mother, Patsy. Then Sandi Gorin, in Metcalfe Co Kentucky Vital Statistics, identifies a daughter, Mary C. Clark, born Oct 1861, and a son, John W. Clark, born to Edmund and Lucinda (Harper) Clark on 22 Aug 1874.]\n\nJames Clark, son of Jonathan Clark, married and has a family. [On 31 Jan 1856 James married Mary Ann Edwards, daughter of John Edwards. (See Sandi Gorin's book, Marriage Records of Barren County 1850-1860.) According to the 1870 Metcalfe County KY census (1870 Federal Census: Kentucky, Metcalfe County, Edmonton PO, household 419/411), they had five children: James, Henrietta, Jonathan, William, and Albert. Then another daughter, Anna, shows up in the 1880 census (1880 Federal Census: Kentucky, Metcalfe County, ED 191, South Edmonton Precinct, page 152C). Their son James married Nancy Ellen Withrow on 19 Nov 1878 in Metcalfe County (Marriages of Metcalfe County KY 1868-1883 by Judy Froggett, page 18), and they had at least one child, a son named Charles (1880 Federal Census: Kentucky, Metcalfe County, ED 196, Sartain District, page 238B). We also know that James and Mary's son William J. Clark was married to Flora Bell Bybee on 23 Feb 1896 in Metcalfe County (Marriages of Metcalfe County KY 1884-1899 by Judy Froggett, pages 20-1). William and Flora Bell had at least six children: Virgie, Ora, Bertha, Rubie, Leslie, and Annie (1910 Federal Census: Kentucky, Metcalfe County, ED 71, sheet 2A, household 35/35).]\n\nWilliam Clark, son of Jonathan Clark, married a Miss Greer, and they have several children and are living on Clay Lick creek.\n\nJacob Clark, son of Henry and Willie Ann Clark, if living, is in Henry County, Virginia. [Carolyn Murphy indicates that Jacob and his children were in Patrick County, Virginia. Jacob Clark married Jane Stovall on 8 Apr 1825 in Patrick County VA.]\n\nHenry Clark married the second time and had several children [Henry married Cassandra Philpott (Henry County, Virginia, Marriage Bonds, 1778-1849, page 9, Aug. 22, 1801). They had 8 children: Sarah, William Henry, Nathaniel, Purvania, Gideon, Assinette, Susanna, and David.]. He lived and died in Henry county, Virginia. [His will is dated 25 Jan 1828.]\n\nElizabeth, daughter of Henry and Willie Ann Clark, married Buck Nunn [28 Mar 1805 in Henry County VA] and lived on the headwaters of Little Barren river, two miles from the old William I. Pace home and had three children. [Buck Nunn was apparently dead by 10 May 1823 for on that date, guardian bonds were issued in Barren County for two of his children.]\n\nElizabeth Nunn, daughter of Buck and Elizabeth Nunn, married James Leeper [31 Aug 1829 (Barren County Marriage Book, page 157], and had two children, a son and a daughter. [Children named Betty and William (see 1850 Federal Census: Kentucky, Barren County, household 239/243).] The daughter married John Dixon. [Elizabeth C. Leeper married John R. Dickson on 21 Nov 1850 in Barren County. (Barren Marriages 1850-1859, page 19] I suppose the son is dead. James and Elizabeth Leeper lived and died, and were buried at Mt. Moriah, Metcalfe county, Ky. [Elizabeth Nunn Leeper died 4 Jun 1856 and is buried in Metcalfe County on a hill overlooking Mt. Moriah road. Her son, William, is also buried there. He died on 8 Mar 1857 at the age of 19. (Metcalfe Cemetery Book, Vol. 1, page 166)]\n\nNancy Nunn, daughter of Buck and Elizabeth Nunn, married John Raily, and had a family. [married 24 Sep 1832 in Barren County KY (Barren County Marriage Book, page 216). The family was living in Cumberland County in 1850 (1850 Federal Census: Kentucky, Cumberland County, page 302, household 326/326) with 6 children: 4 boys and 2 girls. By 1860 they had a total of 9 children: 5 boys and 4 girls. Unfortunately, the children's given names are all provided only with initials.] One of her daughters married Thomas Perkins. She died and was buried at the old Buck Nunn home.\n\nWinchester W. Nunn, son of Buck and Elizabeth Nunn, married Martha Barton. Both died and were buried at the old Buck Nunn home. They had children who live in Metcalfe county, Ky. [This is actually Joseph W. Nunn. He married Martha Barton on 5 Dec 1839 in Barren County (Barren County Marriage Book, page 196). By 1850 they had 5 children: William, Thomas, Joseph R., Mary E., and Joseph C. (Barren County Census, Division 2, page 422B).]\n\nNancy Clark, daughter of Henry and Willie Ann Clark, married Stephen B. Franklin. They lived and died and were buried on Ferris' Fork creek, in Metcalfe county, Ky. They left two children, Lewis and James, who lived on Ferris' Fork creek. [It seems that Stephen also had a brother named Lewis Franklin who married Elizabeth (Helton) Renick on 10 Oct 1841 in Barren County (Barren County Marriage Book, page 94). Elizabeth was a widow twice before marrying Lewis. Elizabeth Helton first married William Sims on 7 Sep 1826 in Barren County (Barren County Marriage Book, page 240). She next married William Renick on 15 Nov 1831 also in Barren County (page 220). According to census records, Elizabeth and William Renick had at least three children: Nancy, George, and William. That same 1850 census record shows that she had 3 daughters by Lewis Franklin: Lucy, Mary, and Elvira (1850 Federal Census: Kentucky, Barren County, District 2, Household 772/790, page 458A). The 1860 and 1870 censuses show another daughter, Melissa Franklin (1860 Federal Census: Kentucky, Metcalfe County, household 721/721, page 106; 1870 Federal Census: Kentucky, Metcalfe County, household 196/194). Marriage records indicate that Elizabeth was a daughter of Nathaniel and Mary Helton.]\n\nPervania Clark, daughter of Henry and Willie Ann Clark [actually a daughter of Henry's second wife, Cassandra (see Henry's will)], married Jeremiah Smith. they lived in Glasgow, Ky, in 1833. I don't know where they moved to from there. [They were still in Barren County in 1850 (1850 Federal Census: Kentucky, Barren County, Div 1, page 398B, household 1318/1353) with 5 children: Cassandra, Nathanel, Ann, William, and Sarah.]\n\nIngram Nunn and Elizabeth Nunn, his wife, had four [actually 3, see below] daughters, one of whom married my grandfather, William Ingram Pace.\n\nMillie Nunn, eldest daughter of Ingram and Elizabeth Nunn, married Anxton [Langston] Pace. [Langston and Millie's daughter, Polly Whaly Pace, married John Washington Williams. John and Polly's Bible records are online thanks to Gary Pitcock. Also, their daughter, Sarah Williams, married Isham D. Kidwell on 12 Jun 1851. More about him here.]\n\nElizabeth, daughter of Ingram and Elizabeth Nunn, married Ingram Alexander [Henry County, Virginia, Marriage Bonds, 1778-1849 page 1 Jan. 14, 1800], and both daughters and their husbands lived on Marrowbone creek, in Cumberland county, Ky. Willie Ann, daughter of Ingram and Elizabeth Nunn, married Henry Clark, and Sallie, daughter of Ingram and Elizabeth Nunn, married William I. Pace. [Carolyn Murphy shared the following statement: \"Willie Ann was most likely a daughter of Ingram's from a previous unknown relationship. Willie Ann was born about 1760 and Ingram's wife Elizabeth was born about 1756. Ingram and Elizabeth married in 1773 which is thirteen years after Willie Ann's birth. Ingram was already approximately 33 years old at the time of his marriage to Elizabeth. It is quite possible that he had been married previously to whomever was Willie Ann's true mother. Willie Ann would still have been a half sister to Sallie, Elizabeth, and Millie.]\n\nMy grandfather, William I. Pace, and my great uncles, Henry Clark, Anxton [Langston] Pace and Ingram Alexander, all four married sisters.\n\nIngram and his wife and Henry Clark and his wife all lived and died in Henry County, Virginia.\n\n[Henry and Willie Ann's daughter, Ruth Clark, married John Draper in Henry County VA on 26 Feb 1810. They are reported to have had at least 8 children. They lived in Cumberland County KY before moving to Indianapolis IN in the 1820's. Ruth is said to have died about 1830.]\n\n[Henry and Willie Ann's daughter, Frances Clark, married Thomas Nunn on 31 Oct 1809 in Henry County VA. According to one report, they had at least 4 children: George, Martha, Elbert, and Elizabeth. Thomas Nunn died in Henry County VA. Frances is reported to have died in Saline County MO where she was living with her son Elbert and his family as late as the 1880 census (Saline County MO, page 439A). Elbert and Jane Nunn had at least 4 children: Eliza, Lee, Joseph, and Thomas.]\n\nJohn Pace lived and died in Henry county, Virginia. He was the father of thirteen children, only two of whom I knew, William Ingram and Anxton. [According to his will, John Pace had the following children with Elizabeth Nunn Pace: William Ingram, Lucy, Thomas, Susannah, Elizabeth, Sarah, John, and Polly; and the following children with Mary Baker Stone: James Baker, Greenville Thompson, Jerman W., Lucinda Thompson, and Matilda Patterson. Anxton (Langston) was actually John Pace's brother, uncle to William Ingram Pace. Langston also named a son William Ingram.]\n\nWilliam Ingram, son of John Pace, was born July 8th, 1773, and died Dec. 18th, 1843. [See his will here.] He married Sallie Nunn, who was born May 15, 1779, and died Sept. 21st, 1859. They were married Nov. 24th, 1796. They were buried two miles East of Summer Shade at their old home, leaving fourteen children. These are their names and generations:\n\nElizabeth Dunn Pace, daughter of W. I. Pace, was born Nov. 20th, 1799, died Oct. 19th, 1879, and was buried at her old home place. She married Joseph Clark, Dec. 13th, 1815, and he died about 1824, leaving five children.\n\nNancy Ferris Clark, daughter of Elizabeth D. Clark, was born July 20th, 1817, married John L. Bybee, Oct. 24, 1833, and died Feb. 3, 1902. She had thirteen children.\n\nHenry Clay Bybee, born Aug. 14, 1834, who married Eliza Watt, Oct 6, 1858. [The 1880 census shows Henry and Eliza with 7 daughters: Lillie, Emer, Bettie, Mattie, Minnie, Nanny, and Mary; and a son: Joseph. (Metcalfe County KY, page 225D)]\n\nJemimia E. Bybee, daughter of Nancy Bybee, born Sept. 30, 1836, married London Pace, June 7, 1857. London P. Pace, her husband, was born 1835, died March 23, 1897, and was buried at the old Bybee home, two miles East of Coral Hill, where John L. Bybee and Nancy F. Bybee were buried. She and her children live near Horse Cave. [London and Jemima were shown in the 1880 census with 5 children: nancy, Sanford, Ella, Frank, and Fountain. (Hart County KY, District 80, pages 323D-324A)]\n\nChristopher T. Bybee, son of Nancy F. Bybee, born July 8, 1838, married M.J.

Moriah. She died Nov. 22, 1900 and was buried at the same place. They had three children, two boys and one girl.\n\n[According to Augustine (Augie) Warder Royalty, Mary Ann Bybee and her husband James William Warder had three children: Charles A. Warder (b. 12 May 1868; d. 12 Dec 1944 in Hart Co KY), Edwin E. Warder , and N. Lillian Warder Gillock (b. 16 Dec 1883; d. 2 Mar 1933 in Horse Cave KY). Augie's great-grandfather, Joseph V. Warder was James William Warder's brother. Augie also indicates that James William Warder left a will signed 18 Mar 1886 which is on a LDS film and is cited in a Pace family file.]\n\n[According to the Metcalfe County, Kentucky Cemetery Records, Volume 1 (1983), J.W. and Mary A Warder are buried in the Shirley-Urie Gossett cemetery which is located on the Randolph-Mt.

[Thomas N. and Elizabeth Clark are buried in the Clark-Obe Franklin cemetery about 2.7 miles north of Summer Shade off of Highway 640 according to the Metcalfe County cemetery book. Thomas' dates are born January 29, 1823, died September 10, 1894. Elizabeth was born Januar 4, 1824 and died August 6, 1900 according to this book. That does not agree with Clark.

He was mortally wounded at Shiloh on 7 Apr 1862 according to military records.]\n\nHezekiah P. Pace, son of Joseph [John] J. and Susan Pace, was born March 2, 1840, died about 1855, and was buried at the old home place on Nobob. [Hezekiah was still living at home with his father in 1860.

He left Kentucky in 1836, went to Missouri and practiced medicine there till death. [The marriage of William Henry Pace and Lucrecia Hart is recorded as taking place on July 11, 1833 in Cooper County, Missouri.]\n\nEliza Greenwood Pace, daughter of William I. and Sallie Pace, was born Oct. 15, 1812, married Whitfield Button, Nov. 25, 1829. They had three children, two sons and one daughter. The sons died. They moved to Illinois about 1854, and she and her husband died and were buried there. The daughter married in Illinois and had one son, her husband died, leaving her and her son still living, but I don't know the location.\n\n[Whitfield and Eliza G. Button were living near Sanford Pace according to the 1850 Barren County KY census (District 2, page 421, household 256/260). The census showed two children: Marion F. Button, age 15, and Anne S. Button, age 11. Whitfield was a son of John and Lucy (Huffman) Button.\n\nRichard S. Clark shared the following: \"Eliza died 11 December 1870, probably in Abingdon, Knox county, Illinois, and was buried in the Abingdon cemetery. Whitfield's third wife was still a resident of Abingdon in the 1900 census, two years after his death, so perhaps he died there, too. Whitfield's marker shows that he died 6 July 1898. The Illinois Statewide Marriage Index shows that he was issued a license in Knox county that was not used, and in the very same month, issued one in McDonough county for the very same bride, Margaret Elzina Robinson, who would become his widow. ... I have posted the photos online, and they can be found at the following link. Buried there is Whitfield, his first wife Eliza Greenwood Pace, his second wife Hannah R. Hughes, his son Christopher C. and daughter Ann S. (both Eliza's children). Christopher had married just months prior to his death, in Henderson county, Illinois, where brother Marion Francis Button was a practicing attorney. Marion died in Oquawka, Henderson county, Illinois on 24 August 1867, leaving a son Frank who later moved to Lexington, Kentucky and died there in 1933.\n\nRichard continues, \"Actually, several of William Henry Clark's remarks concerning the family are inaccurate. Son Talbert G. Button was born 1830 and died 1831 in Barren county. He seems to imply that Eliza and Whitfield's other two sons, Francis Marion and Christopher C., died prior to the family's move to Illinois. Perhaps it was only the way in which it was phrased. They died afterward, with Marion Francis survived by a son (noted above). Whitfield and Eliza's daughter Ann S. Button married John B. SCHEITLIN, a native of Switzerland. John B. SCHEITLIN died 28 May 1913, well after William Henry Clark published his pamphlet in 1905, so that is another error. John probably died in Seattle, King county, Washington, as well as Ann, who died 19 April 1919. Both are buried with their infant son Fayette Tell Scheitlin and infant daughter Laura Scheitlin, at Abingdon cemetery, along with Ann's parents. John and Ann (Button) SCHEITLIN were survived by their sons Harry B. and Marion G. SCHEITLIN. Harry B. was last found in the 1920 census of Seattle, King county, Washington with his wife Elizabeth, while Marion G. Scheitlin died in Duval county, Florida in 1936, survived by his wife Olive D. William Henry Clark states that John and Ann had just one son, but they actually had the 3 sons and 1 daughter.\"]\n\nSallie Ingram Pace, daughter of William I. and Sallie Pace, was born August 28, 1814, married Jesse Gee, 1831, died April 6, 1833, buried at the old Gee home, now belongs to Barnett Harvey.

COMPTON was born in Edmonton, Metcalfe Co., Ky., June 17, 1839, and is the eldest of seven children - three sons and four daughters - born to Joseph R. and Martha N. (Hatchett) Compton, the former a native of Barren County, Ky., and the later of Pittsylvania County, Va. They were of Irish and English descent, and were born March 2, 1815, and December 29, 1817, respectively. Joseph R. Compton in early life learned the blacksmith's trade at Glasgow, which he continued to follow, in connection with farming, until his death, which occurred January 30, 1860. For many years he was a captain in old State militia. His father, John Compton, was a native of Virginia, but immigrated to Barren County, Ky., in a very early day. Mrs. Martha N. Compton is yet living. From her girlhood she has ben a devoted member of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. Her father, Archibald Hatchett, was also a native of Virginia, and served at Norfolk during the war of 1812. He, in about 1827, immigrated to southwestern Kentucky. Her mother, Mrs. Elizabeth Hatchett, is living, in her eighty-seventh year, and receives a pension for her husband's services. John W. Compton received a good English education in youth, at the common and select schools of the county, and has also very materially added to his early training by his own exertions, and is a man of wide and varied general information, having been a close and careful reader all his life. After his father's death he followed the blacksmith's trade for about one year, and during that time commenced the study of law, often working with his book open on the forge. At the breaking out of the late civil war he took a very active and determined stand for the Union side, and in December, 1861, went to Columbia, with the intention of enlisting in the Third Kentucky Volunteer Infantry (Federal service), but when at the picket line a fight ensued between the Federal troops and a detachment of Texas Rangers, in which he was severely wounded, from the effects of which he has never fully recovered. In July 1865, he was admitted to the bar, and has ever since practiced law with most abundant success in Metcalfe and adjoining counties. In 1866 he was elected county attorney, and resigned that position in 1867 to run for the Legislature on the Union Democratic ticket, but was defeated by forty votes. In 1871 he was appointed school commissioner for Metcalfe County, and was elected to the same office in 1873, serving four years in all. He married, March 21, 1872, Carrie Glazebrook, a native of Glasgow, Barren Co., Ky., born November 27, 1841. She is a daughter of Joseph and Lucinda (Pace) Glazebrook. Two sons and one daughter have blessed their union, viz.: Ada, deceased, William G. and Charles S. Mr. Compton and wife are consistent members of the church, he of the Cumberland Presbyterian and she of the Christian Church. He has been a ruling elder in his church for the past twenty years, and is also a member of the Masonic fraternity. In politics he is a Democrat, and is one of the energetic and successful lawyers and prominent citizens of the county. From Kentucky: A History of the State, Battle, Perrin, & Kniffin, 3rd ed., 1886.

They are all living with their parents in California.\n\n[According to the Metcalfe County cemetery book, Joseph Glazebrook (1809-1885), Lucinda S Page(sic) Glazebrook (1818-1869), William Henry Glazebrook (1847-1924), Clarence Leon Glazebrook (1856-1881), Fannie Engel Glazebrook (1851-1886), Ellen Eliza Glazebrook (1844-1888), Mary Elizabeth Riggs (daughter of J. and L.

January 7, 1873) were all buried in the Pace-Hensley cemetery at the old Pace place. According to the book there were 27 unidentifible graves in the cemetery. Also, there was a son Joseph in the 1850 and 1860 censuses with this family. He was one month old in 1850, and ten years old in 1860.]\n\nJoseph Washington Pace, son of William I. and Sallie Pace, was born March 3, 1820, married Harriet Whitlow in 1842. She died about 1862 and was buried at old Pace home, and had six children.\n\nThompson Pace, son of Joseph Washington and Harriet Pace, was born in 1842, married a Miss Pedigo and live in Salem, Ind.\n\nJames Tandy Pace, born 1845,[Apr 1847 according to the 1900 census record] married a Miss Page in 1863, live in Red River county, Texas. English is their postoffice. They have thirteen children, most of whom are married and live there. [The 1880 census for Cumberland County KY (page 148C) identifies James' wife as Lucy. The following children are also listed: Nancy, George, Willie, Temple, Mamie, Mattie, Atticus, and Albert. Of these, Nancy Pace was born on 17 Jul 1867 and died on 19 Jul 1947. She married William T. Rawlinson, and they had at least 8 children: Addie, Virgie, Noah, Mary, Gertrude, Sarah, William Tandy, and Jasper. George Pace was born 11 Mar 1869, and died 17 Jul 1918 in Red River County TX. Temple Pace was born 4 Apr 1873 and died 18 Apr 1941 in Red River County. Three more children are identified in the 1900 census: Virgie, Azor, and Elmer. According to the 1910 census, they did indeed have 13 children, but by that time only 9 were living. James Tandy Pace's wife was Lucy Margaret (or Margaret Lucy) Page, daughter of John B. and Nancy (Cox) Page. Since Lucy was born in Oct 1851 (1900 Census record), it is unlikely that she married James in 1863. Also, their first-born, Nancy, was born in Jul 1867, so a marriage year of late 1866 is more likely.]\n\n[Of William and Nancy Rawlinson's children, we know that Addie Emmaline Rawlinson was born 16 Dec 1885 and died 12 May 1965. She married S.L. Rozell and they had at least four children: Forest, Willard, Golden, and S.L. Jr. We also know that Mary Rawlinson was born 23 Aug 1894 and died 5 Feb 1934. She married John W. Foster, and they had at least five children: Henry Edward, Linnie, John W. Jr., Ruby, and Harold. Finally, we know that William Tandy Rawlinson was born 6 Oct 1902 and died 12 Jan 1972 in Hopkins County TX.]\n\nPleasant Pace was born in 1847, was killed while at work on the railroad and was buried out there. He was unmarried. [The 1850 census (Barren County KY, page 421B) identifies a son named James T. Pace (see above), age 3 who might be who Clark is referring to here. James is also in the 1860 census with his parents. Pleasant Pace was born about 1862 to Joseph's second wife.]\n\nThe three daughters, I know nothing of them. [The 1860 census for Metcalfe County (page 123, household 840) identifies six children: Beverly T., James T., Lucien F., Sarah E., Martha R., and Trinvilla A. According to Metcalfe County KY marriage records, Sarah E. Pace married John Brents on 28 Oct 1869. The 1880 Barren County census shows them with 5 children: James, LIllie, Mary, John, and William. Martha B. Pace married Jonathan Crumpton in Metcalfe County on 21 Dec. 1871; her sister Trinvilla (Tinnvilla?) married James T. Crumpton on 26 Dec 1872.]\n\nJoseph Washington Pace was married the second time to Louisa Williams in about 1859 [had to be 1862 or after since his first wife didn't die until then], moved to Texas about 1878, settled in Hunt county, two miles South of Lonoak. He died July 21, 1901. He had four children by his second wife, all married but one, and his wife and one child are living in Red River county, Tex., postoffice is English.\n\n[The 1870 (Metcalfe County, Sartain pct, household 242/234) and 1880 (Hunt County TX, Precinct 4, page 505D) censuses identify Joseph and Louisa's children as Pleasant, John William, Oleevesper, and Medora, Fergus, Joe Tom.]\n\nJames Marian Pace, son of William I. and Sallie Pace was born Aug. 17, 1822, went to the Mexican war and died in 1845, unmarried.\n\nThis concludes Mr. Clark's family history. I hope you find it useful."
