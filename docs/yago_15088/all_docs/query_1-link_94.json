        "text": "100 - HISTORY OF OHIO\n\nold when the family moved to Fairfield County and took up residence in the town of Carroll, where he attended the public schools and later took a course in the old Pleasantville Norman School, after which, when but seventeen years old, he began to teach school and in this way partly provided for his musical education, for it early became evident that he had unusual musical talent.\n\nWhen but fifteen years old Mr. Sands became a member of the town band at Carroll, and in less than a year afterward he was made leader of the organization, and his future career as a musician was definitely settled. Familiar as he is with every band instrument, Mr. Sands is especially proficient on the cornet. Before deciding to become a band teacher and bandmaster he thoroughly prepared himself in a technical way, placing himself for the study of harmony and composition under the celebrated Professor Kurtz at Wilmington, Delaware, this instructor being a graduate of the Conservatory of Leipsic, Germany, and the talented young student made rapid progress.\n\nIn 1898 Mr. Sands came to Columbus and entered upon professional work, and in 1900 he\n\nbecame assistant leader of the band of the Fourth Infantry, National Guard of Ohio, not long afterward becoming leader, succeeding the late Jesse Worthington. Under Mr. Sands, careful and intelligent training the organization was developed into a superior concert band and one that has been heard in many states of the Union, visited on the Redpath Lyceum and Chautauqua circuits. For a number of years no important public exercises' over the state were considered complete without this band's presence, and it took a very prominent part in all the exercises in connection with the celebration of the state's Centennial.\n\nIn 1916, under Mr. Sands, leadership, the Fourth Ohio Infantry Band went to the Mexican border and remained until February, 1917, and the organization was immediately mustered out on its return to Ohio. Almost immediately following the country's declaration of war with Germany the old Fourth Infantry was mustered into the United States Army, with the title of the One Hundred and Sixty-sixth Infantry, and with his band Mr. Sands went with this regiment into the famous Rainbow (Forty-second) Division, which crossed the sea in October, 1917, and was one of the first American divisions to reach the battle front in France. It is on record that this band was present and in active duty on the front line of battle when the first American troopers succeeded in breaking through what had been declared Hindenberg's impenetrable line, and the fine spirit its music evoked was conspicuous on this and other occasions during the heroic work of the One Hundred and Sixty-sixth, in the Luneville sector, the Baccarat sector, the Champagne-Marne defensive, the Aisne-Marne offensive, the St. Mihiel offensive, in the Esrey and Pannes sector and the Argonne-Meuse major operations. Finally the band went with the Army of Occupation to the Rhine, and Mr. Sands remained there as its leader until the spring of 1919.\n\nWhile in France Mr. Sands had been commissioned a lieutenant, being one of twelve band leaders who took examination under Director Damrosch in Paris, who were found eligible for a commission without further schooling.\n\nMr. Sands was married at Carroll, Ohio, to Miss Katura Oberle of that place, and they have two sons and four daughters: Harold, Ralph, Mrs. Edith Williams of St. Louis, Missouri, Marie, Helena and Hazel. The sons, Harold and Ralph Sands, were members of the Fourth Infantry Band in France during the World war, all of the children having marked musical ability. After his honorable discharge from the army Mr. Sands retired from band leadership, but probably, after so long and distinguished connection with this profession, can never entirely lose interest in it. Upon his return to Columbus he became identified with the Ohio Bureau of Credits, an important business corporation, of which he is now president and manager. He has a wide acquaintance in musical circles over the country, and at times has had membership in representative musical organizations.\n\nCHRISTOPHER LEWIS is a business man at Lorain, and has spent most of his active career in Northern Ohio.

He is secretary of the Hancock County Fair, and he was largely instrumental in gaining the recent enactment of state laws under which fair organizations are empowered to eliminate objectionable features that have militated against the consistency and effective. ness of the annual fairs, and which make possible the bringing of these fairs to a much higher plane. He is active also in the work of boys, clubs and the various movements that make for progress and prosperity for the farmer. Concerning him the following statements have been written and published: \"No person has more grange friends in Ohio than Mr. Lewis.\"\n\nMr. Lewis wedded Miss Lesta Shafer, and they have one daughter, Glesna Josephine, and one son, William Eugene.\n\nREV.

He married Lela McAllister, had a son, Robert Mathews McGill, and they all live with Miss Mathews.\n\nJOSEPH W. McCORD, of Columbus, is one of Ohio’s veteran grain merchants. His experience in that business covers a period of half a century. Early in his career he developed a prosperous business of his of his own, and almost from the first his interests and leadership have been liberally bestowed upon all matters effecting the grain interests in common. As a result he has rendered long and effective service in some of the important organizations of grain men. He is secretary of Ohio Grain Dealers Association, is secretary of the Ohio Grain Dealers Mutual Fire Association, and is a president of the Grain Dealers National Mutual Fire Insurance Company.\n\nMr. McCord was born at Bainbridge, Ross County, Ohio, in 1850. His numerous friends and associates in Ohio grain circles have for a number of years referred to him affectionately as \"Uncle Joe.” His parents were Nimrod Elliott and Sarah Anne (Bridwell) McCord. The McCords are of Scotch-Irish ancestry and were identified with the pioneer American settlements around Marietta. Mr. McCord's grandfather, Enoch D. McCord, was born near Marietta. Nimrod E. McCord was born in Pike County.\n\nJoseph W. McCord was reared in Ross County, acquired his education there, and in 1873 entered the grain business. Three years later, in 1876, he left\n\nHISTORY OF OHIO - 105\n\nBainbridge and removed to Columbus, and for many years has been head of the firm McCord and Kelley, wholesale dealers and shippers of grain. The officers of this firm are in the Commerce Building.\n\nMr. McCord became one of the charter members of the Ohio Grain Dealers Association when it was organized at Put-in-Bay in 1880. He was one of the early presidents of the association, and in 1888 was elected secretary, an office he has filled continuously thirty-five years. He was also one of the organizers of the Ohio Grain Dealers Mutual Fire Insurance Association. This business was incorporated August 6, 1901, and since then Mr. McCord has been its administrative officer as secretary. Another interesting and responsible honor accorded him was election as president a the Grain Dealers National Mutual Fire Insurance Company of Indianapolis. This company was organized in 1902, and furnishes a nationwide service to grain dealers. It has had a remarkable growth. At the end of the first ten years, in 1912, it had insurance in force to the amount of $14.000,000, and at the twentieth anniversary of the company in 1922 it was graded as a $100,000,000 insurance company. Mr. McCord is also a director and chairman of the executive committee of the Grain Dealers National Association.\n\nAll these years he has been a very popular citizen as well as business man of Columbus, where he has identified himself with the Chamber of Commerce, of which he is a charter member, the Rotary Club, the Columbus Athletic Club, the Columbus Country Club and the Goodale Lodge of Masons. Mr. McCord's first wife was Laura J. Kelley, who died in 1905. Subsequently he married Mabel H. Root. Mr. McCord's children, all by his first marriage, are four daughters, Mrs. Caroline Butterfield, Mrs. Estelle Woodward, Mrs. Etta Hoyt DeLong, and Mrs. Josephine Vercoe. He also has eleven grandchildren.\n\nFRANK L. HOLYCROSS is sheriff of Franklin County. The judgment of good citizens is that he is one of the best sheriffs that county has ever had. There has never been a time when a thoroughly efficient sheriff was more needed than now. Sheriff Holycross has been a resident of Columbus since 1906, and is also well known for his deep interest in unfortunate and delin1uent boys and in education generally. He is a member of the Columbus City Board of Education.\n\nHe was born at Unionville Center, in Union County, Ohio, February 3, 1879, a son of Marion and Margaret (Lieber) Holycross. When he was six years of age the family moved to Marysville, the county seat of Union County. He grew up there, attended the public schools, and while working in the railroad station learned telegraphy. His chief profession for a number of years was as telegrapher. He was an operator for different roads until the beginning of the Spanish-American war, when he enlisted with Company D, of the Fourth Ohio Volunteer Infantry. He was with that regiment in its service in Porto Rico. Returning from there in 1899, and after his discharge from the army, he married in October of the same year Miss Mary E. Beard, of Ostrander, Ohio. They have two sons, Karl and Frank, Jr.\n\nAgain taking up railroad service Mr. Holycross was promoted to train dispatcher on the Illinois Central, and several years was located in that capacity at McComb, Mississippi. He came North and in 1906 was made train dispatcher for the Toledo & Ohio Central Railroad at Columbus. He remained in that service until he took up his duties as sheriff fourteen years later.\n\nIn the meantime, in 1913, Mr. Holycross had assumed a voluntary line of duties in connection with the Columbus Juvenile Court in behalf of unfortunate boys who came under the supervision of that court. In 1915 he was elected a member of the Columbus Board of Education for a term of four years, and in 1919 was reelected. This office is nonremunerative, and, therefore, does not interfere with his eligibility for sheriff.\n\nMr. Holycross was elected sheriff of Franklin County in 1920, and began his first term of two years January 1, 1921. On the basis of the splendidly efficient record he made in the first term he was reelected in 1922. The office is a very important one, since Franklin is one of the largest and most populace counties in the state. He has been tireless and unsparing in his pursuit and conviction of lawbreakers of every sort. His activities against highwaymen, bank robbers, bootleggers and other violators of prohibition laws have been especially notable and successful.\n\nSheriff Holycross is a thirty-second degree Scottish Rite Mason and Shriner, is a member of the Knights of Pythias and the knights of Khorassan, and is affiliated with the Elks.\n\nFRANK BYRON MAULLAR, now a member of the Ohio State Public Utilities Commission at Columbus, came to Columbus from Ross County, where his business and civic record has long made him prominent.\n\nMr. Maullar was born in Perry County, Ohio, February 24, 1875, and is a great-grandson of Maurice Maullar, who was proprietor of an old stone tavern on the Drovers Road at the western foot of the mountains in Pennsylvania. Maullar is a name of Holland Dutch origin. Both Maurice Maullar and his wife were born in Holland. Their son, William Maullar, was born in Pennsylvania in 1810, learned the blacksmith 's trade, and about 1823 settled at Harrisville in Harrison County, Ohio, where he followed his trade until his death in 1843. He married Elizabeth Davies, a native of Belmont County, Ohio, and daughter of John and Rachel (Collins) Davies, who came from Wales. George William Maullar, father of the state official, was born in Harrison County, July 4, 1843, and as a small boy lost an eye, yet, nevertheless, found service in the Civil war as a drummer boy with the Seventy-eighth Ohio Infantry, and during the siege of Fort Donelson, when the fighting became exceedingly fierce, discarded his drum, seized a gun and from that time fought as a regular soldier in the ranks until discharged late in 1862. He was a farmer in Morgan County, then in Perry County, and in 1877 bought a farm in Ross County. Late in life he retired to Londonderry. His wife, Sarah Virginia Waterhouse, was born in Muskingum County, Ohio, daughter of James and Octavia J. (Clayton) Waterhouse, the former of Scotch ancestry and the latter from Culpeper County, Virginia, of English ancestry.\n\nFrank B. Maullar was only nine years of age when his mothcr died, and after that he and his brother and sister lived with their grandmother in Ross County. He attended rural schools, the graded schools at Londonberry, and began teaching when nineteen years of age. Through teaching he worked and paid his way while attending college. He spent four terms in Ohio University at Athens, and con- tinued his education in the Valparaiso University in Indiana. Altogether he taught school ten years, and seven years of this service was rendered in the Londonderry, Ohio, High School. In 1906 he re- moved to Chillicothe, where he has since been prominently identified with the real estate business. He became specially known through his success in handling the sales of farm lands, and did business in sixteen states, including many operations in Southwest Texas.\n\nWhile Mr. Maullar maintains a residence in Co-\n\n106 - HISTORY OF OHIO\n\nlumbus during his official activities, he still maintains his home in Chillicothe, where he has been actively identified with civic and community affairs. For several years he served as a director of the Chillicothe Chamber of Commerce, and a member of the Rotary Club. During the World war he was appointed by Governor Cox, food commissioner for Ross County. He also served as a member of the committee appointed to select the site and secure the establishment, by the United States Government, of Camp, Sherman, and, following the war, the establishment of the Soldier's Vocational Training School of Chillicothe.\n\nOn May 1, 1922, Governor H. L. Davis appointed Mr. Maullar a member of the State Public Utilities Commission, and he has since given this office practically all his time and attention. He is well known as a leader in the republican party in Ross County. He cast his first vote for William McKinley, and in the same year he became a member of the Ross County Republican Committee, and has served as a member of said committee continuously since that time. He is now a member of the State Central Committee from the Eleventh District, and for the past four years has been a member of the State Executive Committee. Mr. Maullar is a thirty-second degree Scottish Rite Mason; has taken the Royal Arch and the Council degrees of the York Rite, and is a Noble of the Mystic Shrine. He is also a member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks.\n\nHe married on November 18, 1909, Miss Almyra Donelson Woodruff, daughter of John Woodruff, and granddaughter of Joseph Day Woodruff, who came from New York State and settled in Muskingum County. Mr. and Mrs. Maullar have one son, Myron E., born in 1911.\n\nDANA FARNUM REYNOLDS, of the famous pioneer family of Medina County, has been a resident of Columbus since 1912, was a successful member of the bar there and for the past three years has been assistant United States district attorney.\n\nHe was born at LeRoy, Medina County, in 1883, son of Frederick A. and Louise (Farnum) Reynolds. Both the Farnum and Reynolds families were identified with the early period of settlement and development in Medina County and that portion of the Western Reserve. They were of sturdy New England stock, and in the new country exemplified the prominent characteristics of that people, especially in their desire to build up good schools and maintain the latest activities. They were active in the Universalist Church.\n\nThe paternal grandfather of the Columbus attorney was Joseph Reynolds, the son of Joseph Reynolds. He was a tanner, lived in the southeastern part of Westfield Township, Medina County, and owned a mill race and dam, a tannery, and for many years carried on the manufacture of leather.. The Reynolds family came from Greenfield, New Hampshire.\n\nMr. Reynolds, mother, Louise (Farnum) Reynolds, was a direct descendant of Governor Bradford of the Mayflower. She was the daughter of Hazzelton Farnum. Her grandfather, Asa Farnum, was a native of Maine. When seventeen years of age he set out on foot, carrying an axe on his shoulder, and walked overland to Ohio, making his settlement at what is now the Town of LeRoy, in Westfield Township, Medina County. He located there about 1822. He was a wagon maker, and he had the distinction of manufacturing the first wagons in Medina County. In a business way, however, his chief distinction was as one of the founders of the historic Ohio Farmers Insurance Company, which started business in 1848, and has endured an uninterrupted career of prosperity for three quarters of a century.. The old home of Asa Farnum was about a half mile east of the Town of LeRoy. This is still owned by his descendants. His old house is occupied by his granddaughter, Mrs. Anna (Farnum) Simmons. Her husband was nephew of Jonathan Simmons, who was associated with Asa Farnum and others in establishing the Ohio Farmers Insurance Company.\n\nDana Farnum Reynolds was reared at LeRoy, and graduated from the High School there in 1900. He is also a graduate of Buchtel College, now the University of Akron, and in the fall of 1912 came to Columbus and entered the law school of the Ohio State University. He graduated in 1915 with the degree of Juris Doctor. Mr. Reynolds conducted a successful law practice in Columbus until May, 1920, when he was appointed toward the close of the Wilson administration assistant United States district a attorney for the southern district of Ohio. While in that office he has assisted in several notable cases handled by the Federal Department of Justice, and his record has added much to his reputation as an able lawyer. Before coming to Columbus Mr. Reynolds was active in Medina County politics, and was twice democratic candidate for the Legislature. He is a member of the Elks, and the Young Business Men's Club of Columbus.\n\nMr. Reynolds married Miss Edith Yocum, of Wooster, Ohio. Her father, the late Lewis Yocum, was president of the Citizens National Bank of Wooster. Mrs. Reynolds, who is a graduate of Wooster University, is a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution. They have one son, Dana F. Rey Jr., born in November, 1921.\n\nWILLIAM BURRELL HESTON has made himself known in Columbus and over Ohio for several in interesting distinctions. He is a member of the City County, and has been identified with a very prosperous real estate business in Columbus for twenty years. From early boyhood he cultivated the divine art of music, became proficient in practically all the band instruments, and he has found his highest measure of satisfaction in his official work with the Aladdin Temple Band, which he developed and of which he is bandmaster. This is probably the finest Shrine band in the country.\n\nMr. Heston was born near Carthage, Jasper County, Missouri, January 27, 1879, son of Thomas W. and Adra (Hudson) Heston. In 1881, when he was two years of age, the family moved to Ohio and located at North Lewisburg, in Champaign County. There William B. Heston attended common and high schools, and remained there until the spring of 1898, when he joined the Seventh Regiment, Ohio National Guard, and served as a member of the Regimental Band during the Spanish-American war period, until he received his discharge in Columbus. He then remained in Columbus and has since had his chief business interests in that city. For several years he was connected with the Hallwood Cash Register Company, and in 1903 he and his brother Frank F. Heston engaged in the real estate business. His brother died in 1906, and since then the business has been the W. B. Heston Realty Company. This company has handled a great deal of real estate in and around Columbus, and it represents a complete real estate service for selling, management, sub-division and everything connected with the handling of realty property. As a real estate man Mr. Heston had the honor of being elected president of the Columbus Real Estate Board.\n\nFor two years he was president of the local union of the American Federation of Musicians. Throughout his business career he has employed most of his spare time in cultivating the musical art as an individual talent and also as a leader and director. The\n\nHISTORY OF OHIO - 107\n\nfamous Aladdin Temple Band had its origin about thirteen years ago in a small nucleus of seven or eight musicians belonging to the Temple. In 1913 the band comprised twenty-three members, under the management of Mr. Heston, and at the present time it numbers 115 regular members and twenty-five reserves, all of whom are Shriners and members of Aladdin Temple of Columbus. This is one of the largest Shrine bands in America. It has appeared at all the notable Shrine gatherings for several years past, in makes extending from coast to coast, and has won in some notable competitions between Shrine bands. It makes an impressive appearance wherever it goes. Mr. Heston is a York and thirty-second degree Scot-Rite Mason. Mr. Heston was one of the organizers of Aladdin Country Club, and has served as president since its organization, some six years ago. He was elected to the City Council of Columbus in November, 1923, to serve a term of four years.\n\nJune 1, 1902, at Columbus, Mr. Heston married Miss Mary Ann Chapman, of Westerville, Ohio. They have three sons, Simeon W., Thomas Chapman and Robert Burrell.\n\nRALPH EDISON HOFFHINES. In the special field of commercial education probably no individual in Ohio is more favorably and conspicuously known for his work and his influence than Ralph Edison Hoffhines, director of commercial education, Columbus public schools.\n\nMr. Hoffhines was born at Columbus, October 16, 1879, son of Frank J. and Harriet Emma (Holmes) Hoffhines. The name Hoffhines has an honorable record in commercial education, due to labors begun by Frank J. Hoffhines and continued jointly by him and his son. Frank J. Hoffhines was born in Pickaway County, Ohio, and early became a seeker of commercial appliances for introducing the teaching of commercial studies in the Columbus public schools as long ago as 1887.\n\nRalph Edison Hoffhines while growing up at Columbus attended the Sullivant School for eight years and spent four years in the old Central High School, being a graduate of both of these institutions. For two and one-half years he continued his higher education in the University of Chicago, where he specialized in history and sociology. Mr. Hoffhines has the interesting distinction of having been the youngest teacher ever engaged in the high schools the City of the\n\nCity of Columbus. He was only nineteen when he was employed to teach commercial branches in the Central High School. His experience in the teaching of commercial education in Columbus has been continuous since that date. He has held the office of director of commercial education in the public schools for several years.\n\nIn addition he is also president and principal of the Office Training School in Columbus, which was organized in 1909 and is one of the most successful schools of its kind in the country.

His father, Robert F. Dusenberry, a native of New York State, was a member of an old family in the Peekskill District of that state, and was a Union soldier in the Civil war. He was a civil engineer, but for many years he followed the business of commission merchant. His wife, Mary A. Wentz, was a daughter of Michael Wentz, a Virginia farmer.\n\nHarold Edwin Dusenberry acquired part of his educational training in Marshall College at Huntington, West Virginia, and also attended school at Chicago for a time. His early business training was acquired in mechanics, in the drug and in the jobbing and brokerage business, and in 1906 he located at Columbus, where he has since been an active figure in real estate circles. The H. E. Dusenberry Realty Company was established June 18, 1906, and has its offices in the First National Bank Building. Mr. Dusenberry has been a member of the Columbus Real Estate Board since its beginning, and possesses a long and authoritative knowledge of real estate values, and has steadily exerted a strong influence for the building of better homes and the making of a cleaner city.\n\nOn December 3, 1907, he married Miss Anna Elizabeth Koontz. Her father, J. E. Koontz, was a well known real estate operator in Columbus. Mr. and Mrs. Dusenberry have two lovely daughters, Maree Isabelle and Ellen Ann. Possessed of pleasing personality, Mr. Dusenberry has made hosts of warm friends in Columbus. He is a thirty-second degree Scottish Rite Mason and a Shriner, and has been identified with the Methodist Church since one year\n\nof age.\n\nJOHN B. YOUNGBLOOD has gained specially distinctive success in the work of his profession, that of mechanical engineer, and he has given effective service as consulting engineer of the Department of Public Welfare of the State of Ohio from its organization, in 1911, to the present time, besides which he is chairman of the Ohio State Prison Commission, a position to which he was appointed in June, 1923, by Governor Donahey.\n\nMr. Youngblood was born in the City of Cleveland, Ohio, in the year 1876, and on the maternal side is a representative of one of the influential pioneer families of the Ohio metropolis, a brother of his mother having built the first brick house in Cleveland. Mr. Youngblood duly profited by the advantages of the public schools of his native city, and his training for his profession of mechanical engineer was by actual shop work and broad and varied practical experience. He served a regular apprenticeship in the shops of the Globe Iron Works in Cleveland, one of the great industrial concerns controlled by the late Senator Mark Hanna, and eventually he became master mechanic in the great Cleveland factory in which are produced the White sewing machines. He next became chief engineer at the plant of the W. S. Tyler Company, one of the largest wire and ornamental-iron manufacturing concerns in the United States, and after seven years of effective administration in this capacity he was for a number of years engaged in the general construction business in Cleveland, as a designer and builder of modern structures of the highest grade. It was his special ability in this field of activity that led to his being called to the position of engineer for the Public Welfare Department of the State of Ohio at the time this department was established, in 1911. He has since maintained his residence in the capital\n\n108 - HISTORY\n\ncity, and has supervised the construction of a number of important buildings for the Department of Public Welfare. He built the power house of the State Hospital at Columbus, and also the building of the juvenile research branch at this institution. He built the famous dairy barn of the State Prison Farm at London, this being one of the finest and most modern dairy plants in the United States. In the summer of 1923 Mr. Youngblood, in his official capacity, is supervising the erection and equipment at this institution of a modern creamery building, which is to be a model industrial plant of this order. The dairy barn at the prison farm has accommodations for 400 cows, and its construction cost the state only $39,000, while experts testify that under the usual contract system the cost would have been fully $100,000. It is, in fact, one of Mr. Young-blood's most distinctive and valuable services to the state that his work saves money to the taxpayers, for he makes most careful estimates on all details of construction and never approves contracts that do not give the minimum of legitimate cost to the state. His official functions give him charge of construction, alteration and improvement of all the public institution buildings of Ohio, to the number of twenty-three institutions, including five large hospitals, the penitentiaries and industrial schools, the schools for the feeble-minded, the deaf and dumb and the blind, the epileptic and tubercular hospitals and the Soldiers Home at Sandusky.\n\nMr. Youngblood married Miss Maude C. Dillon of Union County, and they have two children, John R. and Florence.\n\nTHOMAS M. HARE, D. D. A native of Southern Ohio, a minister of the Methodist Church, Thomas M. Hare took up the work of the Anti-Saloon League a quarter of a century ago, and has been one of the important personalities representing this great organization not only in Ohio, but in other states. He is now superintendent of the Anti-Saloon League of Ohio, with home at Westerville and offices at 175 South High Street in Columbus.\n\nHe was born in Brown County, Ohio, in 1865. His father served as a Union soldier in the Civil war, and on returning home found his affairs in practical bankruptcy. He died shortly after the war, leaving his widow with small children to rear and support. She then removed to Fayette County, joining some relatives and locating on a farm four and a half miles south of Washington Court House.\n\nIt was on this farm that Thomas M. Hare grew to manhood. He attended public schools, continued his education in the National Normal University at Lebanon, and after studying law was admitted to the bar. However, he never engaged in the practice of that profession. His attention instead was diverted to the ministry, and he became a member of the Ohio Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church. His first pastorate, beginning in 1893, was at New Plymouth, in Vinton County. He continued active in the Methodist ministry in Ohio for seven years and his last pastorate was at Rushville. He left that pastorate to engage in the work of the Anti-Saloon League. Doctor Hare in 1900 entered the Anti-Saloon League organization, his first position being as superintendent of the Canton, Ohio, District. Later he succeeded Mr. Wayne B. Wheeler as superintendent of the Cleveland District, at which time Mr. Wheeler became state superintendent of Ohio. From Cleveland Doctor Hare was called to the office of superintendent of the Anti-Saloon League of Wisconsin, with headquarters at Milwaukee, and later was for a time national legislative superintendent, with headquarters at Washington. He served as state superintendent of the League in West Virginia, and in 1911-12 he organized and conducted the campaign which resulted in that state going dry by a majority of 92,342. Following that he served about five years as state superintendent of the League in Maryland.\n\nFrom Maryland Doctor Hare returned to his native state of Ohio, establishing his home at Westerville. The Town of Westerville, in Franklin County, has more associations than any other Amerian community with the inception and growth of the temperance movement, particularly with the beginning of the Anti-Saloon League, whose work as much as any other one factor contributed to the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment. Doctor Hare early in 1924 was appointed superintendent of the Anti-Saloon League of Ohio, taking charge of the office February 1, 1924.\n\nDoctor Hare married Miss Addie G. Post, of Washington Court House, Ohio. She is a sister of Congressman J. D. Post, of Washington Court House and a prominent member of the Ohio bar.\n\nL. B. TURNER, M. D. In the medical profession Doctor Turner has been an active figure in Ohio for over thirty years. During the greater part of that time his home and practice have been in the City of Columbus. He is known for his public spirited citizenship as well as in his profession in that section of Columbus known as Hilltop, and is president of the Hilltop Improvement Association.\n\nDoctor Turner was born in Huntington Township, Gallia County, Ohio, in 1862, son of William H. And Annis (Thompson) Turner. His mother was of New England Quaker stock. William H. Turner, whose father represented an old Virginia family, was born in Gallia County, Ohio, in 1829, the year after his parents had moved out of Louisa County, Virginia.\n\nL. B. Turner grew up on a farm in Southern Ohio, attended the public schools of Gallia County, and completed his professional education in Starling Medical College, which has since merged with the Ohio State University. He was graduated in medicine in 1892, and for many years practiced at Bidwell in Gallia County. In November, 1906, he located at Columbus, and has enjoyed a heavy general practice. He is the leading physician in the Hilltop community, one of the most prosperous and rapidly growing sections of Columbus.\n\nDoctor Turner is a member of the Columbus Academy of Medicine and the General Practitioners Society of Columbus. For many years he has been a student of Masonry, and is past master of Vinton Lodge of Masons and also past master of West Gate Lodge No. 623, and past high priest of West Gate Chapter No. 216. The Hilltop Improvement Association, of which he was elected president in February, 1924, resulted from the merger of the Hilltop Chamber of Commerce and the Hilltop Athletic Association. The new association has the powers to make it an efficient instrument in carrying out all worthy civic, social, business and improvement enterprises for this section of Columbus.\n\nDoctor Turner married Miss Blanche Edwards, now deceased. He is the father of three children, C. Brown, Annis and Lauren Turner.\n\nJERRY O'SHAUGHNESSY. At the time of his death and for half a century preceding, the late Jerry O 'Shaughnessy was in the service of the Columbus Water Works Department. No city ever more appropriately honored long and faithful service than did Columbus when it named O’Shaughnessy Dam in his honor.\n\nThe late Mr. O'Shaughnessy was born at Delaware, Ohio, in 1854, and died at Columbus, January 28, 1921. He began work May 9, 1870, before he had reached his seventeenth birthday, as a common\n\nHISTORY OF OHIO - 109\n\nlaborer. The first day he swung pick and shovel in digging the foundation for the smoke stack at the old West Side pumping station. This was a part of the construction work on the modern water works system of Columbus. Having assisted in building the original plant, he was made \"wiper of machinery\" when it started operation in 1871. Six months later he was promoted to fireman. Industrious study by practical observation and otherwise brought him a knowledge of steam and stationary engineering and six months later he was promoted to engineer. This position was filled by him for seventeen years. Then occurred a temporary absence from the department, when he became engineer at the Wyandotte Building, which had just been completed as Columbus, first skyscraper. In 1896 he returned to the service of the city as superintendent of water works by appointment of Mayor Cotton Allen. He continued to serve until Samuel J. Schwartz was elected mayor in 1899. Two years later he was again appointed superintendent by Mayor John N. Hinkle, remaining through his adminstration and those of Robert H. Jeffrey and De Witt C. Badger. When Charles A. Bond was elected mayor, in 1908, Mr. O'Shaughnessy again retired temporarily. During the administration of Mayor George J. Karb he returned as superintendent of water works, and continued in the service under Mayor James J. Thomas, his death occurring during the latter administration. With the exception of the brief period noted he was with the water works department for half a cntury.\n\nHis was a service that was appreciated during his lifetime and at his death brought out numerous tributes of respect and affection by the public and the press. However, the honor most fitting him and one which will perpetuate his name in the city was the result of the resolution unanimously passed by the City Council to give his name to the great storage dam now under construction in Delaware County, and which will furnish the water supply of Columbus for generations to come.\n\nMr. O'Shaughnessy married Miss Anna Donovan, of Cardington, Ohio. He is survived by two sons and two daughters, Jerry, Jr., Joseph, Mrs. Phil Schneider and Miss Nell O'Shaughnessy.\n\nIn 1891 the late Mr. 0 'Shaughnessy founded the undertaking business of O'Shaughnessy and Hart. Under that name it was conducted for a number of years. Since 1916 the business has been conducted by his son, Mr. Jerry O'Shaughnessy, Jr., under the name of O'Shaughnessy Undertaking Company. The company moved in the new home purchased by them April 1, 1924, at 375 East Town Street, with complete modern mortuary.\n\nJerry O'Shaughnessy, Jr., was educated in the Sacred Heart School, in North High School and Ohio State University. He became one of the organizers and was cashier of the West Side Dime Savings Bank, and later became assistant cashier of the National Bank of Commerce. That position he resigned in 1916 to take charge of the undertaking business founded by his father. He married Miss Nelle Regina Fahy in 1905, and they have nine children.\n\nJerry O'Shaughnessy, Sr., was very active in all Catholic and especially Irish affairs. He served for several terms as county president of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, was their delegate to all national conventions, and organized and installed the first division of the Ladies Auxiliary of Ancient Order of Hibernians. He was also active in the Knights of Columbus, and was president, continuously, up to the beginning of the World war, when all social functions ceased, of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick and also presided at all their annual banquets. No St. Patrick's day parade was ever complete without Jerry arshal. He was always active in politics, a member of the democratic organization for years, controlled local affairs and was chairman of the Public Works Committee and a member of the Chamber of Commerce.\n\nPERRY OKEY, president of the Okey Manufacturing Company of Columbus, is a machinery designer and mechanical engineer of the first rank, and among . other distinctions to his credit one is that he constructed the first automobile ever built in the City of Columbus, and one of the first practical cars in the country.\n\nMr. Okey, who was born in Cincinnati, in 1873, represents one of the oldest families of Eastern Ohio. He is a descendant of Leven Okey, who came from the State of Delaware and settled with his family in 1802 in what is now Monroe County, Ohio, then a part of Belmont County. The name Okey has had prominent associations with the legal profession of Ohio through several generations. The great-grandfather of Perry Okey was Cornelius Okey, who represented Monroe County several terms in the Ohio Legislature. He married Hannah Weir, daughter of Rev. James and Esther (Hazard) Weir. Esther Hazard was a cousin of the famous Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry, hero of the Battle of Lake Erie. Judge John W. Okey, a son of Cornelius Okey, crowned his record as a brilliant and resourceful attorney with a term of service on the bench of the Supreme Court of Ohio. Judge George B. Okey, son of Judge John W. Okey, and father of the Columbus manufacturer, was born in Monroe County, and for many years has enjoyed high standing as a member of the Columbus bar.\n\nPerry Okey was educated in the public schools and Ohio State University. His inclination from earliest youth was toward mechanics. As a boy he set up a small shop, with lathe and other equipment, in the basement of the family home. He was a boy when the bicycle entered upon its era of popularity as a vehicle, and even at that time Mr. Okey conceived unalterable convictions that power vehicles would necessarily take the place of horse drawn, reasoning that there was no more sense in buggies and wagons being drawn by horses than that railroad cars should be so drawn. Thus his inventive mind long dwelled upon and worked over the idea of the bicycle or tricycle propelled by an engine. He had his experiences in riding one of the old \" ordinary \" or high bicycles, and he got one of the first \"safeties\" when they came in.\n\nDuring the early '90s he was experimenting in his little shop, after his own plans and drawings, upon a power propelled bicycle or tricycle. In the summer of 1895 the Chicago Herald offered a prize for the best power propelled vehicle to be exhibited at a contest promoted by that paper in Chicago during the summer. Mr. Okey tried to get his tricycle ready for the contest, but failed to do so. However, by the next summer, 1896, he had completed and demonstrated his three-wheel vehicle propelled by a small gasoline engine. Later he built a four-wheel vehicle, a real \"horseless carriage,\" forerunner of the present automobile. He drove it on the streets of Columbus in December, 1899. It was the first automobile ever seen in Columbus, with the exception of a Winton car, built in Cleveland, which had made its appearance in the next exhibition in the city, in the preceding September. However, Mr. Okey's was the first motor driven vehicle really built in Columbus. It was a one cylinder machine steered with a tiller.\n\nHis experiments in automobile manufacture continued until 1906, when he and a number of associates organized the Okey Motor Car Company. The plant was equipped and started the production of the Okey car. About twenty-five cars of that type were made and sold. Then, just as the company was looking for-\n\n110 - HISTORY OF OHIO\n\nward to some settled prosperity, the money panic of 1907 brought about a cessation of this industry, as it did many others similarly situated throughout the country.\n\nSubsequently Mr. Okey retired from the manufacture of automobiles, with the satisfaction of having contributed some of the ideas and practical processes to the industry. Since then he has continued in business as a designer and builder of machinery, a business carried on under the name of the Okey Manufacturing Company, with plant at the corner of Water and Nachten streets. Under the direct and guiding supervision of Mr. Okey, it is one of the prominent engineering works of Ohio, and as machinery manufacturers the company specializes in fine machinery and special tools. Mr. Okey has always done all of his own drawing and designing. He is a member of the Columbus Engineering Club, the Columbus Athletic Club, the Columbus Country Club, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the American Institute of Electrical Engineers.\n\nMr. Okey by his marriage to Jessie Connor, of Norwalk, Ohio, has one daughter, Dorothy V. Okey.\n\nJOHN A. DODD. In a comparatively brief period of years John A. Dodd has become one of the conspicuous figures in fire insurance circles of Ohio. He is vice president and secretary of the American National Fire Insurance Company of Columbus. By profession and early business experience he is a public accountant.\n\nMr. Dodd was born at Circleville, Pickaway County, Ohio, in 1883, son of Albert and Catherine (Rooney) Dodd. Reared in his native town, where he attended the parochial schools, he completed his education in Ohio State University at Columbus, and became one of the pioneer members in the profession of public accountancy in Ohio. A member of an old and well known family of Pickaway County, personally popular himself, and on the basis of his qualifications as a public accountant, Mr. Dodd was elected and from 1913 to 1918 served as county auditor of Pickaway County.\n\nThe American National Fire Insurance Company. of Columbus is an organization whose record is impressive on the score of material success and also through the personnel of its officers and directors. The president of the company is the distinguished Ohioan, Gen. Chauncey B. Baker, a sketch of whose life is published elsewhere. Mr. Dodd in 1916, when still county auditor of Pickaway County, was made secretary of this company. After leaving public office he moved his home to Columbus, in 1918, and has since been promoted to vice president and secretary, having the active executive charge of its affairs.\n\nMr. Dodd is a member of St. Francis Catholic Church of Columbus, and is affiliated with the Knights of Columbus. He married Miss Mary Rose Smith, of Circleville. Their nine children are : John, Mary, Matthew, Robert, Thomas, Edgar, Virginia, Anne and Richard.\n\nHERMAN ECKHARDT, JR., is one of the oldest automobile men in Columbus from the point of service, having started when some of the first crude motor vehicles were being manufactured. His knowledge of the development of the automobile business covers a period of twenty years. He has recently organized and is president of the Wills Sainte Claire of Columbus Company.\n\nThe City of Columbus has known and esteemed three successive Herman Eckhardts. The first was born in Saxony. By profession he was a musician and an orchestra conductor. He participated in the German Revolution of 1848, and when that movement failed he exiled himself, bringing with him the Saxonian band of which he was a leader. He arrived in Boston in 1848, and during subsequent years had a long and distinguished career as an orchestra conductor and teacher, in Boston, New York and Columbus. He conducted the first performance of Handel’s Messiah in the City of Boston, and for several years was conductor of a theatre orchestra in New York. He came to Columbus in 1869, at the invitation of local musicians, and held the position of supervisor of music in the public schools and was also conductor of the Mannerchor and other singing societies. He lived out the remainder of his life in Columbus, and was one of the notable men in the early musical life of the city.\n\nThe second Herman Eckhardt was born at born at Boston, Massachusetts, and came to Columbus in 1869, but in 1875 returned to the East and for nearly thirty years was in business and a resident of Lowell, Massachusetts, where he married. In 1904 he returned to Columbus, and is now secretary of the Hoster Realty Company of that city. He married Nellie A. Billings, of Lowell, Massachusetts.\n\nHerman Eckhardt, Jr., a son of Herman and Nellie A. (Billings) Eckhardt, was born at Lowell, Massachusetts, September 24, 1881, and was reared and educated in the East. About the time the family returned to Columbus he became a mechanic in the shops of the Columbus Buggy Company. For a great many years that had been one of the great buggy manufacturing concerns of the country. At that time its facilities were just being readjusted to the advent of the automobile, and automobiles were manufactured on a small scale. Mr. Eckhardt was assigned to work in the automobile department, and helped construct some electric automobiles. He made one of the first long distance runs ever made with an electric automobile, this run, from Columbus to Dayton, being considered a remarkable record for the time. Mr. Eckhardt was associated with the Columbus Buggy Company in its automobile department for about twelve years.\n\nSubsequently as a salesman of automobiles he represented such nationally known cars as the Thomas Flyer, the Marmon, Paige and the National. In the summer of 1923 he organized his own company Wills Saint Claire of Columbus Company, which handles the Wills Saint Claire cars, and the business headquarters are a spacious and modern building at 19 North Fourth Street.\n\nMr. Eckhardt was one of the organizers of the Columbus Automobile Club, of which he was the first secretary. This club has since become one of the largest in the country.\n\nCHESTER C. COOK. The Sunday Creek Coal Company is one of the oldest and largest coal operating corporations in Ohio. Its business headquarters are at Columbus in the Outlook Building, and the company owns 50,000 acres of coal lands in the Hocking Valley District, chiefly in Perry, Hocking and Athens counties. His company operates fifteen large mines on this coal land, and it also acts as selling agent for about fifty-five other companies operating on the same properties in the Hocking Valley.\n\nIn the service of this company in the Columbus offices Chester C. Cook started as a minor clerk, and his ability to absorb information and knowledge and his industry have promoted him to one of the executive officials. He is now treasurer and auditor of the coal company, and is a prominent worker in civic affairs at Columbus, being secretary of the Columbus Country Club and secretary of the Rotary Club.\n\nHe was born at Columbus, September 27, 1881, in a house which stood on the present site of the Front Street Fire Station. His parents, William A, and Frances (Davis) Cook, represented members of old-\n\nHISTORY OF OHIO - 111\n\ntime families in Columbus. His maternal grandparents came from Wales and located at Columbus in 1820. His maternal grandfather, the late Richard Davis, constructed the first sewerage system in Columbus and did practically all the paving of the city up to 1890. His first home in Columbus was a log cabin in which he built at the corner of North High Street and First Avenue. Adjoining it was his farm, since all that part of the city was then out in the country. His descendants still own much valuable property in that vicinity.\n\nChester C. Cook attended the grammar schools and the North High School, and after his high school course entered business as a city solicitor for a wholesale grocery house. Three months later he went to work in the auditing department of the Hocking Valley Railroad, and was with the railroad four years. It was in June, 1902, that Mr. Cook entered the general offices of the Sunday Creek Coal Company at Columbus. Since then many promotions have been accorded him, and for several years he has been a stockholder in the corporation, a member of its Board of Directors, and in charge of its financial affairs as treasurer and auditor.\n\nMr. Cook has held his office as secretary of the Columbus Rotary Club for several years, and has been responsible for some of the prominent activities of this great organization. He was especially interested in raising the fund of $60,000 for building the now famous tuberculosis dispensary at 499 Oak Street, said to be the finest free tuberculosis dispensary in the country. Mr. Cook is chairman of the house committee as well as secretary of the Columbus Country Club. He is a Knight Templar and Scottish Rite Mason and Shriner, a member of the Grotto, and is one of the governors of the Tuberculosis Free Dispensasry. He has long been interested both as a player and as a promoter of sound athletics. He is a member of the football committee of the Chamber of Commerce, and has himself played football and for fifteen years played baseball with the Saturday Afternoon League of Columbus, of which he was one of the organizers. Mr. Cook is invariably drawn upon for his efficient and public spirited services in all civic and welfare movements.\n\nHe married Miss Leah Herbert. Her father, the late Edward Herbert, was for many years a successful building contractor in Columbus, and was responsible for the construction of the first large commercial building on High Street, at the corner of Chestnut. He was the contractor for most of the buildings put up by the Deshlers and Haydens, including banks, office buildings and industrial buildings. Mr. and Mrs. Cook have one son, Chester H. Cook.\n\nGEORGE L. WHEELER. Among railway officials located at Columbus, one of the most popular and one who has gained promotion from the ranks through the efficiency and fidelity demanded of railroad systems terms is George L. Wheeler, general agent, passenger department, New York Central Railroad (Ohio Central Lines). Mr. Wheeler was born near Lime City, in Perrysburg Township, Wood County, Ohio, in 1874, son of Stephen and Elizabeth (Schneider) Wheeler. His father was a native of England, came to this country at the age of twenty and settled in Wood County, Ohio. Elizabeth Schneider, whom he married there, was born in Switzerland and was a child when her parents established their home in Wood County. Both families located there when Wood County was still a comparatively new and undeveloped section of the state.\n\nA farm environment during his early years, and with school advantages in district institutions of learning, George L. Wheeler left the farm to take up railroading, and has now spent thirty-two years in that work out of the fifty years of his lifetime. He learned telegraphy, and his first regular position was as telegraph operator at Van Buren in Hancock County. Subsequently he became operator and station agent at Marysville, and on April 18, 1896, came to Columbus and opened the Broad Street Station for what was then known as the Toledo, Columbus & Cincinnati Railway. The title of this road was later changed to the Toledo & Ohio Central, and finally became officially designated as the New York Central Railroad (Ohio Central Lines).\n\nMr. Wheeler remained the agent in charge of the Broad Street station until 1904. In that year he was made city ticket agent of the company, in February, 1907, was advanced to city passenger agent, and on July 15, 1910, after the New York Central Lines had taken over the Ohio Central, he was made traveling passenger agent. Since January 1, 1916, he has been enjoying the official rank and performing the duties of general agent of the passenger department of the New York Central Railroad (Ohio Central Lines). These lines embrace nearly a thousand miles of railroad, extending from Toledo to Columbus and to Charleston, West Virginia, with various branch lines both in this state and West Virginia. This road is noted for its high class service and equipment. The successive promotions with which Mr. Wheeler has been honored attest his ability as a railroad official, his high standing with the managers of the property, and also his popularity with the public, since his service has been one bringing him in close contact with the patrons of the lines.\n\nMr. Wheeler is one of the prominent Masons of Columbus. He is past master of Humboldt Lodge, Free and Accepted Masons, past high priest of Ohio Chapter, Royal Arch Masons, past thrice illustrious master of Columbus Council, Royal and Select Masters, is warder of Mount Vernon Commandery No. 1, Knights Templar, monarch of Achbar Grotto of the Mystic Order of Veiled Prophets of the Enchanted Realm, a member of the Aladdin Temple of the Mystic Shrine at Columbus, is past president of the New York Central Square Club, a Masonic organization, and is a member of the Shrine Club.

It is essentially a company doing business in its home state, and it was organized following the disclosures of corrupt methods in the insurance business during 1905. The Ohio State Life Insurance Company has made a remarkable record, and while its operations are extended to Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia, Oklahoma and Texas, fully four-fifths of its business is in Ohio. It now maintains insurance in force to the amount of $40,000,000, and assets of over $5,000,000. The larger part of its assets are invested in first mortgage loans on real estate. It is an Ohio corporation, subject to the rules of Ohio governing insurance companies, and its management has kept the resources of the company at all times at a conservative and prosperous standard. Since 1911 the company has also been writing health and accident insurance and it affords all the standard and special forms of policy approved by the most progressive insurance authorities.\n\nThe company has been fortunate in having al-\n\n112 - HISTORY OF OHIO\n\nmost a continuous official personnel. The president, John M. Sarver, the vice presidents, U. S. Brandt, Irving Drew and Joel C. Clore, and the medical directors, C. E. Shilling and T. W. Rankin, have all been identified with the company since 1906, and very few changes have been made in the directors. Joseph K. Bye, secretary and treasurer, has served the company as an officer since 1916.\n\nJohn M. Sarver was born in Stark County, Ohio, November 29, 1865, son of Michael and Eliza Jane (Anderson) Sarver.

The Avery and Loeb Electric Company of Columbus is a large business, handling electrical supplies wholesale and retail, and doing an extensive business with electrical contractors, telephone companies and industrial plants. This business in an important degree represents the energy and resourcefulness and well applied industry of Oscar Avery, who for a quarter of a century has been identified with the business community of the capital city.\n\nMr. Avery was born near Hilliards, in Franklin County, Ohio, July 8, 1880, son of P. S. and Lucinda (Sands) Avery, his father dying in 1886. His grandfather was Peletiah Sylvester Avery, whose father was one of the first settlers at the Hilliards community in Franklin County. For this pioneer Avery Lodge of Masons at Hilliards was named.\n\nOscar Avery was six years old when his father died. As a boy he came face to face with the serious problems of life, and became self supporting as soon as possible. He was educated in the public schools of his home community, graduating from high school, and his first employment was as clerk in a general store at Hilliards. In 1897 he came to Columbus and began his career in the electrical business with the firm of Erner & Hopkins, wholesale electrical supplies. He started as messenger boy, and filled every position with that house except bookkeeper. When he resigned on January 1, 1911, he was sales manager. He left the old firm to purchase the business of the Ross-Hull Electric Company, and organized as its successor the Avery & Loeb Electric Company, of which he has been president. This is one of the largest electrical supply firms in Ohio, and the business has steadily grown and prospered under the capable direction of Mr. Avery.\n\nMr. Avery is a York and Scottish Rite Mason, being a member of the Mount Vernon Commandery of the Knights Templars, the Scottish Rite Cosistory and the Mystic Shrine. He also belongs to the Junia Lodge of Odd Fellows and the Elks., was the first member and the first president of the Kiwanis Club of Columbus, and belongs to the Athletic, Aladdin Country, and Young Business Men's clubs.\n\nMr. Avery married Susan Bolton Young. She was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts. Her father was a native of Scotland and her mother of England. The four children of Mr. and Mrs. Avery are: Robert B., Louise E., Martha Elizabeth and Janet.\n\nHIRAM COOK, who died at his home in Columbus in the year 1921, was one of the gallant young men who represented Ohio as soldiers of the Union in the Civil war, and he had the further distinction of serving as a member of the bodyguard of President Lincoln.\n\nMr. Cook was born in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, in the year 1836, and he was a lad of eleven years at the time of the family removal to Ohio, the home having been established at Adelphia, Ross County, whence removal later was made to Circleville Pickaway County. At that place Hiram Cook ws residing at the inception of the Civil war, and he responded to President Lincoln's first call for volunteers by enlisting in the Second Ohio Volunteer Infantry, one of the first Ohio commands to become active in warfare on Southern soil. He took part in the various engagements in which this regiment was involved up to the year 1863, and was then assigned to duty as a member of the Seventh Ohio Independent Cavalry, comprised of soldiers and officers from every county in Ohio, the command having been organized in consonance with a special request by Governor Tod. This regiment was assigned to duty at the national capital, as a special guard to President Linco, and Mr. Cook was bugler of the famous command. The regimental bugle, now in the possession of Mr. Cook’s son, Howard M., of Columbus, played an important part on the tragic day that marked the assassination of President Lincoln, and it is gratifying to be able to preserve in this publication the statements given by Mr. Cook himself in an interview that\n\noccurred several years prior to his death. Mr. Cook said:\n\n\"I had just sounded taps at the barracks Fifteenth Street and was sitting on my bunk, getting ready to turn in, when one of the guardsmen came running in, and said Secretary of State William H. Seward had been murdered. Without authority from superior officers, I sounded the call ‘boots and saddles.’ In seven minutes the entire company was mounted and off to the Seward residence. On the way we met another guardsman, who excitedly told us the President had been shot at the Ford Theater, Turning the horses, I led the company down Pennsylvania Avenue to the theater, in Tenth Street. We were greeted by a wild roar of helpless fury and despair from the thousands of men and women who crowded the entrance to the theater. The President was carried to a residence across the street, while we dispersed the crowd.\"\n\nThereafter Mr. Cook was attached to the cortege\n\nHISTORY OF OHIO - 113\n\nwhich carried the body of the martyred President from Washington to Springfield, Illinois, and in that capacity he was in Columbus, Ohio, while the remains of the President here lay in state at the capitol. At each place where services were held en route the historic bugle was used in blowing taps, including the final obsequies at Springfield, Illinois. From the Columbus Dispatch of June 17, 1923, are taken the following quotations:\n\n\"Battered and time-stained, but still capable of service, the historical bugle which sounded taps over the grave of Abraham Lincoln has been located in Columbus and will be used in blowing the assembly call in the 'Pageant of Memories, which will be given in honor of the state G. A. R. encampment June 26. The bugle is the property of H. M. Cook of Columbus, who inherited it from his father, Hiram Cook, who was a member of President Lincoln 's body-guard.”\n\nFor a short period after the close of the Civil war Hiram Cook was engaged in the lumber-mill business at Columbus, and he then returned to Circleville, where he established a lumber mill and engaged also in contracting and building. Later, by reason of impaired health resulting from the hardships he endured while serving as a soldier in the Civil war, he disposed of these business interests and established at Circleville the bookstore which he thereafter conducted about forty years, he having been one of the honored and loved pioneer citizens of that place at the time of his death and having been long and appreciatively affiliated with the Grand Army of the Republican. Mr. Cook wedded Miss Delila Long, of Chillicothe, Ross County, and she preceded him to the life eternal.\n\nHoward M. Cook, son of the honored subject of this memoir, was born and reared at Circleville, and he has been for several years a resident of Columbus, where he is associated with the real estate firm of Wollom & Schleckman.
