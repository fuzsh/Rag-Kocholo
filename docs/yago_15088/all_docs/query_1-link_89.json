We notice that Mr. Fairchild at a hearing before The iron trade furnishes a further index to the in­ creased activity which pervades all our industries. In the Banking and Currency Committee on Thursday, the matter of pig iron production new records are in answer to a question by Mr. Cox, of Tennessee, being made every month. It is an old story to say stated that under the bill of the Monetary Commission that we are producing more iron than ever before in if a bank elects to redeem its notes in silver it can do our history, and more, too, than any other country has so, although the note holder requires and demands ever produced.

If this advance shall be maintained, it will mean important benefits to all the companies. It may seem strang3 that prices should be raised at this time when the mild weather has so materially curtailed the demand for coal. But according to the reports in the newspapers the com­ panies have of late been rigidly restricting the output, so that stocks are light. The Long Island Railroad Company has favored us with another monthly statement of gross and net earn­ ings. Like the returns for the previous months, it makes a very encouraging showing. The report is for November, and shows gross earnings for the “ system” of $316,072 in 1897 against $283,253 in 1896, and net of $70,159 against $62,564. For the five months since the beginning of the fiscal year on July 1 gross earn­ ings are reported at $2,446,179 against $2,283,794, and net earnings at $983,351 against $932,552. After allowing for taxes a»d fixed charges, a surplus remains of $498,392 for the five months of 1897, against a similar surplus in the corresponding period of 1896 of only $422,241. The comparison is really better than these figures indicate, for in the expenses for 1897 the management have included $55,000 credited to a reserve fund for new rails, gas fixtures in cars, new freight cars, &c. The New Y ork associated banks now have within $829,400 of the largest amount of loans ever recorded in their history, while the deposit line is at the high­ est point, standing last week at $685,592,500, against $675,169,900 the maximum previously reported. For more than a month, or since the Union Pacific nego­ tiation began, the banks have obtained good rates for all the money and the credits they were enabled to employ, not only in our own money market but in Europe. The statement of last week indicates that though the surplus reserve has increased to $22,264,575 from $11,523,450 December 25, which was the minimum last year, a material in­ crease in the demand for money, resulting from im­ proved business conditions, might possibly cause a curtailment of their loans. But nothing of that kind seems probable now. Returns from the principal financial centres throughout the country show that the outside banks are well supplied with money. At the West nearly all the institutions report an abun­ dance, while the surplus balances being held here for account of Boston banks are abnormally large. At the same time the return movement of currency from the interior is heavy this week, particularly from Boston, while the outward movement has been comparatively small. The indications there­ fore point to a substantial increase in the cash reserves. Consequently, with the existing and immediately pros­ pective somewhat plethoric condition of some of the larger banks, it is not surprising that they should be reaching out for new fields for the employment of their money. The domestic field is apparently fully occu­ pied, but the foreign field is still open. It is estimated by bank officials who are in a position to ascertain the facts that from $50,000,000 to $75,000,000 are being employed by the large banks at this centre, at Boston, and at other important cities, in loans upon sterling or Continental collateral in various forms. This may be regarded by some as an extravagant estimate, but it is a fact that during the current week one bank has 105 been asked to make loans of this character to the ex tent of $1,000,000. Money on call, representing bankers’ balances, has loaned at 3 and at 2£ per cent this week, averaging 2f, though the bulk of the business has been at 3 per cent. The offerings are increasing and the tendency is towards lower rates. Banks and trust companies quote 3 per cent as the minimum. Time loans on good mixed Stock Exchange collateral are 3 per cent for sixty to ninety days and 3£ per cent for four to seven months. The offerings of mercantile paper are increasing but at the same time the demand is good and much of this inquiry comes from out of town, principally from the East. A fair business is done on the basis of 3£ per cent for sixty to ninety day en­ dorsed bills receivable, 3£@4 per cent for prime and 4@ 5 per cent for good four to six months single names. There has been no new feature of importance in the European political situation this week. The Bank of England minimum rate of discount remains unchanged at 3 per cent. The Union Discount Co. of London advised us Friday by cable that it had reduced its rates of interest for call money to per cent and for three to seven days’ notice to I f per cent. The cable also reports discounts of sixty to ninety day bank bills in London per cent. The open market rate at Paris is 2 per cent, at Berlin it is 3§ per cent and at Frank­ fort 3£ per cent. According to our cable from our London correspondent the Bank of England gained £165,216 bullion during the week and held £31,387,268 at the close of the week. Our correspondent further advises us that the gain was due to £752,000 net received from the interior of Great Britain, to imports of £30,000 (of which £24,000 were from the Cape and £6,000 from France) and to exports of £617,000, of which £600,000 were to the Argentine Republic and £17,000 to Peru. The foreign exchange market was dull and steady until Tuesday afternoon when thq tone grew easier. The market was weak on Wednesday and steady again on Thursday and easy on Friday. The only particular feature reported by bankers was a scarcity of commercial bills, these being held at rates very close to those ruling for bankers’ long sterling, and the presumption is that they are being absorbed almost as fast as they are offered through the operation referred to above. The busi­ ness in exchange other than that connected with loans upon sterling seems to be the usual day-to-day counter transactions. It was reported that the ease on Wednesday was due to offerings of bills against purchases of stocks and bonds for European acoount, while the firmer tone on the following day was repre­ sented to be caused by a little better demand. The range for nominal rates on Monday was un­ changed compared with that on Friday of last week, at 4 83£@4 84 for 60 day and 4 86 for sight, and there was no alteration in these rates until Wednesday, when Brown Bros. & Co. reduced their posted rates half a cent, making the range 4 83@4 84 for 60 day and 4 85^ @ 4 86 for sight. On Thursday Lazard Freres reduced the sight rate half a cent, while the Merchants’ Bank of Canada lowered the long rate half a cent, making the range 4 83@4 83| for 60 day and 4 85^@4 86 for sight. The market was dull and stealy on Monday, and the only change in rates for actual business was an advance of one quarter of a cent in short sterling, compared with the close of Fri- 10 5 THE CHRONICLE. day - of last week, to 4 85|@4 85£. On Tuesday the tone was easier while the business was quiet and rates fo r actual business in sight sterling were reduced one «quarter of a cent to 4 85@4 85|, no change being .made either in long sterling or in cable transfers. •On Wednesday the market was easier and rates for actual business in long sterling were re­ duced one quarter of a cent to 4 82£@4 82f, while those for cable transfers were also lowered onequarter of a cent, to 4 85£@4 85£, but no change was made in the rates for sight sterling. The tone was .slightly firmer on Thursday, but without quotable -change in rates for actual business. While quotations for prime and documentary commercial bills closely iollow those for 60-day bankers’ drafts, there is a dis­ tinction made between commercial bills drawn against ¡grain and cotton. Grain payment bills are paid on .the delivery of the grain, and it is the custom when «discounts in London are comparatively high to take payment of these bills under a rebate of 1 per cent below the Bank rate. Cotton bills are not paid, how­ ever, until the maturity of the drafts. The following shows daily posted rates for exchange by some of jthe leading drawers. [Von. LXVI, EN G LAN D A N D THE F A R EAST. Since the move of the German fleet on the Chinese port of Kiao-Chou curiosity has centred on the ques­ tion as to the attitude of the other Powers. That Germany meant to seize and retain this Asiatic port was pretty clearly understood in advance, and the event has proved the supposition to be correct. Sub­ sequent incidents have also suggested that Russia> for its own share, was about to demand concessions re­ garding Corean administration which should further Russian plans for a railway outlet on the Pacific coast. France has made a simultaneous move to enlarge its ownership in the Chinese islands. Each of these dem­ onstrations has been accepted as a prelude to some­ thing more. Naturally, therefore, as the several inci­ dents in the general plan unfolded, the question, what would Great Britain’s attitude be, rose to peculiar in­ terest. There could be no doubt that British interests might be in a considerable degree affected by these moves of the Continental Powers. In addition to its important actual possessions in the Far East, England has of late years materially enlarged what diplomatists call its “ sphere of influence.” Hong Kong and Shanghai DAILY POSTED BATES FOB FOBEION EXCHANGE. are to all intents and purposes British p orts; the F r i.

[VOL. L X VI, seen that, although for the last six months of 1897 the A N IN T E R P R E T A T IO N OF THE F A IL U R E total liabilities and average liabilities have decreased FIG URE8. materially, the failures in that period are large. Indeed Dun’s figures of failures are given in detail on page 117 to-day. We stated last week that compared with 1896 the total liabilities, the average liabilities and number of disasters for 1897 showed a substantial decrease. The number was 13,351 in 1897 and the average liabilities were $11,559 ; in 1896 the number was 15,088 and the average liabilities were $14,992. A more significant fact however is that almost the entire improvement here shown occurred in the last half of the year. For the first six months of 1897 the total number of failures was 6,821 and the total liab­ ilities were $91,692,787, making the average $13,442 ; whereas in the last six months the number of failures was 6,530,¡the total liabilities were $62,639,284, giving an average of only $9,060. This contrast is significant because it shows, what to be sure we all know, that the conditions the past year in business affairs must have changed materially soon after the first of July. But the chief interest does not attach to that contrast. We have during recent years passed through an extremely trying period, and a term of months might be found to present a favorable comparison with those years with­ out indicating a very substantial relief. The actual status is the factor with which every one desires to be acquainted. The question the public naturally asks is — what degree of commercial health do the con­ ditions of this closing half-year indicate ? T o reach a conclusion on that point requires a longer compari­ son. We have consequently prepared the following statement going back to and including 1890, and have divided Dun’s record into the corresponding sixmonth periods. .—F ailures J a n.-Ju ne—Q mos.—. ^ F a ilu r e s July-D ee.—6 mos.—, A m ou n t A verage.

First of all it makes more conspicuous the contrast between the last six months of 1897 as a whole with the same six months of 1896; a glance is enough to convince every observer of the radical character of the improve­ ment in each item. But, as already said, that of itself is not a fair test, for 1896 was a peculiarly trying year. If, however, we carry the investigation further back, it will be seen that the average liabilities for 1897 arc the smallest for any six months in the statement, and that the total liabilities have been smaller only twice. Those are significant results and still further impress the reader with a couviction of the decided character of the change for the better which has taken place. It is certainly an advance worthy of remark and a cause for great gratification that we are freed, for a time at least, from those appalling total disasters which have been such a conspicuous feature in the situation ever since 1890 began. It will be instructive to show shortly that these un­ interrupted large disasters belong to and distinguish the period the above statement covers and did not ante-date it. But before passing to that matter we wish to call attention to one fact, not ref erred to above, w h i c h the foregoing compilation discloses, t It will be the total is only very little less than an average of all the six months in the foregoing statement. We have made up that average for the first and last six months separately; 'the average appears for the last six months of each year to be 6,673 and for the first 6,363. Those results disclose that although the number of failures1 in the last half of 1897 were 6,530, that is considerably less than in the corresponding six months of 1896, they were very little less than the average of the same six months (July to December) for the years 1890 to 1897, both inclusive, and were actually larger than the aver­ age was for the first six months (January to June) of the same years. We thus seem to be brought to the unavoidable conclusion that although the trade conditions in the United States improved in the last half of 1897, the im­ provement was of such a character as to decrease the number of large failures, but at the same time to in­ crease the disasters among men of small capital. Such a state of affairs must mean that the strain to which trade had been subject was not lifted so far a& to relieve the class doing a minimum of business. It so happened that though demand increased, general prices did not advance, leaving in many cases the margin of profit narrower. Under those circum­ stances only the merchant of large capital and largo transactions would be benefited. Those facts may suggest the explanation. We have remarked above that the annual aggregates of liabilities, which were so large and so conspicuous a feature from 1890 to 1897, were much smaller for the years previous to 1890. To illustrate this situation we have compiled from Dun’s records the following statement, made up in the same form as the foregoing, but starting with 1879, the year specie payments werereestablished, and closing with 1889. •-----Six months—Jan.-June . r-S ix m onths—July-D ee.-------- , A m ou nt A m ount A verage Num ber AverageNumber liabilities. liabilit’s. fa ilu res. liabilil’s. liabilit's fa ilu res. 9 $ $ $ 82.955,484 15,722 11,749 5,279 65,828,853 1 8 8 9 -5 ,6 0 3 13,126 5,490 55,715,814 68,114,159 10,149 1 8 8 8 -5 ,1 8 9 4,722 112,422,852 55,138,092 23,808 1887..4,912 11,225 9,782 13.726 4,678 50,434,460 64,209,659 1 8 8 6 -5 ,1 5 6 12,445 4,633 49,497,966 10,684 74,722,355 1 8 8 5 -6 ,0 0 4 22,576 5,458 101,952,145 18,679 1 8 8 4 -5 ,5 1 0 124,391,282 14,274 4,547 66,189,034 106,685,138 23,643 1 8 8 3 -4 ,6 3 7 14,062 3,141 50,966,«44 50,580,920 16,226 1 8 8 2 -3 ,5 9 7 14,297 2,716 40,209,287 14,805 40,946,645 1 8 8 1 -2 ,8 6 6 32,888,763 13,171 2,238 32,863,237 14,675 1 8 8 0 -2 ,4 9 7 65,779.390 16,210 2,600 12,450 32,369,663 1 8 7 9 -4 ,0 5 8 Comparing the foregoing table with the one pre­ viously given in this article, it will be found that the average of total liabilities for the closing six months of the years 1879 to 1889 was $66,349,808, against $99,767,861 in the similar period of 1890 to 1897 ; and for the first six months the average was $65,779,390 in 1879-89, against an average of $96,128,074 in 1890-97. In other words, the item of total liabilities in Dun’s failure figures has increased since 1890, on an average, not far from 50 per cent. These results, too, it should be remembered, have been attained notwithstanding a much lower average value of commodities has ruled in the later period (1890-1897) than in the earlier period from 1879 to 1889. On the other hand, no doubt the collecting of data as to failures is more thorough now than it was in the earler period; that would be a natural development of such work. Granting then these two conditions to have existed, it may be not far from the truth to assume that one would offset. January 15 184:8 J THE CHRONICLE the other; that is to say, that the comparison as it stands is a fair one. Assuming that to be a correct conclusion, these un­ interruptedly large losses become not only an indication but in some degree a measure of the peculiar and in­ creased hardships merchants have been called upon to endure since 1890. Conducting business amid such uncongenial conditions as have existed could only lead to low prices, small margin for profit, disturbed credits, and failures. Indeed all the conspicuous features of Dun’s record seem to illustrate the same state of things and-enforce the same truth. PENSIONS. We are glad to see that as the examination of ways -and means for enforcing Government economy comes to a focus, popular discussion is converging on the pension laws. We believe that no time could be more propitious than the present for dealing properly with this question ; first, because the necessity for public retrenchment is realized by both voters and politicians, and second, because the party in power has always claimed devotion to the true interests of the veteran soldier, and will therefore not be subject to misrepre­ sentation as to its motives in the case. Such insinua­ tions raised against previous efforts at reform of pen­ sion abuses have never had a reasonable basis ; they have appealed usually to the basest passions and the meanest prejudices among the people. But they have had their influence, largely because of the political sources in which they had their, origin, and therefore we say it is fortunate that the pension question should be reviewed in the present Congress and under the present Administration. To get at the root of this question, let us notice briefly, first, the history of the pension appropriations. A t the outbreak of the Civil War, in the fiscal year 1862, considerably less than a million dollars was dis­ bursed by the Government on this account. In 1866, the first full year after the close of hostilities, the roll of pensioners numbered 126,722 and pension expendi­ ture was $15,600,000. This large increase was war­ ranted, though it should be observed that even then the outlay considerably exceeded pension expenditure of any foreign Government at the close of war. By 1871 however the list of pensioners had nearly doubled, and the annual expenditure on that account had risen to $34,413,894. The statesmen of that day regarded the large pension appropriations as a matter calling for explanation and apology. General James A. Garfield, than whom the Union veterans never had a more stanch and faithful friend, declared in the House of Representatives during January 1872, when presenting the Session’ s appropriation bill : “ We may reasonably expect that the expenditures for pensions will hereafter steadily decrease unless our legislation should be unwarrantably extravagant.” Y et in 1878 the annual pension expenditure had risen to $61,000,000 and in 1882 Congress appropriated for the bureau the sum of one hundred millions. Here was a singu­ lar commentary on “ the steady decrease” predicted in 1872 by General Garfield. But there is no mystery about this increase in the pen­ sions. It did not arise from greater needs of veterans, or from a greater Congressional appreciation of their services. It was an expedient adopted . purely for financial purposes. A fler resumption, there was a 109 policy failed to check the absorption of currency into the Treasury. A large part of the Congressional ma­ jority was unwilling to follow President Arthur’ s advice and reduce the import tariff, and appropri­ ations were increased merely to dispose of the surplus. Pensions, however, are the most dangerous possible field of outlay to which to apply the principle of relieving a surplus through extraordinary expendi­ ture. This is true, first, because pensions are usually permanent, and thus fix the budget of expenditure not only for that year but for the lifetime of the applicants, but, second, because the selfish instincts of the entire community are aroused by such wholesale largess. That this should be so is no disgrace to the Civil War veterans as a class; it merely typifies a weakness common to the race. Our soldiers of the War of Independence are placed on a tra­ ditional pedestal. Yet the veterans of that war were not proof against the same temptation, even in days of close public economy, and twenty years after the surrender of Cornwallis it was a common saying at Washington that “ the Revolutionary claimant never dies ; he is immortal.” It was certainly not surprising that the veterans of 1882 should have shared the weaknesses of the veter­ ans of 1803. But the consequence was inevitable ; a host of pension agents descended on Washington ; Congressmen were besieged with applications, and the “ private pension bills ” of the Senate became what wa3 little short of a public scandal. Most unfortu­ nately for this part of the situation, the surplus reve­ nue, after a brief reaction in 1884 and 1885, began mounting up again with great rapidity. In 1888 it became a real and serious embarrassment to trade. Appropriations rose by leaps and bounds. River and harbor improvements and new public buildings were dealt out with a lavish hand ; but beyond all, the budget of pension expenditure was swelled. In th e fiscal year 1893, on the very verge of the collapse of the Treasury’ s surplus fund and of its annual surplus revenue, there was paid out for pensions $159,357,000, nearly five times as much as the sum which General Garfield, twenty-one years before, had declared to be the maximum under honest and economical adminis­ tration. This brief review of the history of our pension legislation will show to the reader why the pension budget is a proper subject for thorough overhauling. Nobody has any wish to deny provision from the pub­ lic treasury to any veteran crippled or disabled by his services to his country. Many people of the United States, though certainly not all, would go as far as President Harrison went in his first annual message of December 18.89, when he advised pensions for all sur­ vivors of the army who should become unable to earn their living, whether their disability originated in the service or not. But as everybody knows, the pension roll has been made, in the wild Congressional extrava­ gance between 1886 and 1890, to cover cases which could not by the most liberal construction be embraced even in Mr. Harrison’s prescribed limits. Pensions have been and still are granted in an enormous total to ablebodied survivors of the war, to well-to-do survivors, to deserters, to youug women who had married aged veterans in the sole expectation of inheriting their pensions. . These are not matters of assertion or con­ jecture ; they are matters of public record, which were known to all, long before Commissioner Evans no THE CHRONICLE. This being true, and the fact being recognized that the pension outlay has been expanded vastly beyond reasonable limits, it will be seen at once that the prob­ lem is not at all a question of restricting the just allowances of Government to those who have fought and suffered in its service. This point, we think, was completely missed by Mr. Edward Atkinson in a recent communication on the subject to the Times.” Mr. Atkinson reasoned that no compensa­ tion could adequately reward the services of the sol­ diers ; that no taxpayer has suffered through the in­ crease in the aggregate pension levy ; that in fact the total expenditure of our Government per capita of population has not materially increased since 1879; and that therefore the general criticism of an exces­ sive pension budget is not reasonable. But this argu­ ment, when reduced to simple terms, would run somewhat as follows : We have plen ty; we have a quarter in which that plenty may be distributed with out wrong-doing ; therefore let us distribute it. It is hardly necessary to point out the exceedingly danger­ ous corollaries to that proposition ; they were pushed to a final demonstration in the days of surplus reve­ nue, and it is the results of that very process under which the Treasury has since been sinking. The truth is, that owing to the accidents in Govern­ ment finance to which we have already referred, Con­ gress, and in a degree the people, have been led far astray from the principles underlying the proper award of military pensions. Services rendered under arms by a citizen to a State can never be rewarded— Mr. Atkinson is right in that— and no Government or people in history has ever asserted that they could be. Such service is the final contribution of a citizen to his country and his race ; it must in its nature be for the most part a voluntary contribution. If the sordid question of “ reasonable” payment were to be ad­ mitted, then the soldier in the field— particularly the volunteer soldier— ought to receive wages infinitely greater than the highest payments made in industrial pursuits. The supposition is of course absurd; but it is no more absurd than the theory that the soldier’s services may be or ought to be rewarded by a money payment later on. That a soldier who has suffered physical disability as a direct result of his military service ought to be cared for by his Government is admitted by all na­ tions. That the dependent widows of soldiers who have fallen at the front have a similar title to support is equally conceded. On these two principles, and on these alone, depends the legitimate theory of military pensions. The total pension expenditure of Great Britain, including army and navy half-pay service, is barely $25,000,000 annually; on the German Empire’s annual account the “ pension fund” and ifinvalid fund” combined are several millions smaller, and neither of these governments has ever been accused of ingratitude or stinginess towards its veterans. Let our own recent annual pension expenditure of $159,000,000, nearly thirty years after the last shot of the Civil War was fired, be contrasted with these foreign pension budgets, and the nature of the American system will be better understood. How far the present standing pension list ought to be or can be revised is a difficult question. But as regards the general question of the budget, the problem is simplified by the fact that a very large part of each year’s pension appropriations may be de­ scribed as outright grants of cash in lump sums. On [Ton. L x v r . this practice a halt ought to be called immediately. A partial halt was called in the Treasury’s hard times between 1893 and 1896, and twenty millions were in that period cut off from the annual pension outlay, nobody suffering from the process. But in the fiscal year ending with June 1897 the pension budget began another ominous movement of increase. It rose then nearly two millions over the year preceding, and the pension appropriations for the current fiscal year were equally large. It is time that the matter should be taken in hand in earnest, unless the old system is to begin again, and that a proper body of experts should go to the root of this mass of old abuses. But in order to accomplish anything there must be some other machinery of reform than a mere expression of interest by standing committees of Congress. The Senate in particular knows by a long experience how to reduce such good resolutions, framed at the opening of a session, to empty nothing. R A IL R O A D GROSS E A R N IN G S FOR 1897. If any one still had doubt as to the substantial char­ acter of the improvement in railroad earnings which occurred during the late calendar year, the compila­ tions which we present below would serve to dispel such doubt. In the magnitude of the gain disclosed the showing will be a surprise we imagine even to those who kept careful watch of the results from month to month. Viewed after its close, the year is seen to have been by all odds the very best the railroad-carry­ ing interest (considering it as a whole) has had for a long term—the best not only since the panic of 1893, but since before that time, say since 1890. In speaking thus we have reference of course to the absolute amount of improvement in earnings shown. On this point the aggregate result is gratifying be yond expectations. We are writing within a short time after the close of the year, when it is not possisible to have complete figures. And indeed, even under the best of circumstances some months must elapse before final and exact data can be obtained. The returns we have already procured, however, afford a sufficiently clear indication of the nature and extent of the improvement (or shall we say recovery ?) which has been established. We have had returns for the full twelve months from 133 companies operating, roughly, one hundred and six thousand miles of roq,d in 1897. These 133 companies earned $602,236,028 gross in 1897, against $564,516,909 gross in 1896, a gain of $37,719,119. In addition we have figures for eleven months of the year from 68 companies operating in 1897 53,732 miles of road. These roads earned $435,266,490 in the eleven months of 1897, against $414,080,848 in the eleven months of 1896, a gain of $21,185,642. Altogether, then, we have a gain of $58,904,761, or 6*02 per cent, on 159,651 miles of road. The final totals, it will be observed, are of great magni­ tude, that for 1897 being over a thousand million dollars ($1,037,502,518), which evidences the compre­ hensive nature of the exhibit and speaks eloquently of the size of the railroad industry.

January 15, 1898.] The list of roads which have as yet reported for only eleven months includes some large companies sure to record heavy gains in the final month, Decem­ ber ; and if we were asked to venture a guess as to the amount of the increase for the full twelve months on the whole railroad mileage of the country, we should say it must be between 70 and 75 million dol­ lars. But even at 58 million dollars the gain is heavy and betokens a large and active volume of business. In no other recent year has the amount of increase been so considerable. In 1895; when the MorganBelmont contract stimulated general trade revival, there was also a marked expansion in the revenues of the roads, but the addition then was not quite fifty million dollars ($49,930,967), the basis of computation having been the same as for 1897— that is, part of the returns being for only eleven months. In 1896 the roads did little better than hold their own, the increase then being only $3,176,917. In 1894 (after the panic o f 1893) they suffered a loss in the large sum of 112£ million dollars ; in 1893 itself they lost over 25 million dollars. But while the 1897 result is thus considerably better than that for these other years, it is of course obvious that the $58,904,761 gain does not represent that much new revenue, but merely a recovery of the large losses sustained in 1894 and 1893, though to be sure it is none the less welcome on that account. The following furnishes a summary for the last five years, both for the twelve months and for December. The latter reflects the conditions at the close of the year, and it will be seen that our remarks above apply also to the figures for the month —that is? the 1897 exhibit is by far the best of any recent year.

In reviewing the figures for the first half, in our issue of July 10, we commented on the fact that though some of the separ­ ate roads had done well the results as a whole afforded no evidence of a marked change for the better. A preliminary table which we then gave covering 159,135 miles showed $1,266,174 loss. A later statement pub­ lished in the C h r o n ic l e of August 28, and covering 163,687 miles, showed a loss for about the same amount, namely $1,115,001. The truth is, the condi­ tions still continued unfavorable during the first six months. Trade was quiet and inactive, and it was not until the last half of the year that the great change in the situation for which the year is distinguished occurred. In both January and February our monthly statements showed a falling off in earnings, .and though the remaining four months of the half-year re­ flected gains, the improvement was small each month, except for May, when the increase amounted to 5T4 per cent. Besides the fact that the uncertainties of tariff legisla­ tion tended to restrict activity in trade, there were spec­ ial depressing influences which kept tonnage and reven­ Ill ues small. The weather was an important drawback for one thing. Out West, while there were no such general snow blockades as have on occasions been noted during other winters, yet some of the individual roads nevertheless suffered severely. At the beginning of the year there were complaints of high winds and drifting snow on theG-reat Northern and the Northern Pacific. Later there were reports of snow blockades on the outlying lines of many of the systems running to Chicago, the main lines, however, remaining com ­ paratively free from obstructions of this kind. T o­ wards the close of February floods at Cincinnati, and throughout the Ohio Valley proved a serious hindrance to many roads. This was followed in March by heavy rains, high water, floods and washouts throughout the whole of the Mississippi Valley. The overflow of the Mississippi was the worst on record, lasting through many weeks, and it was attended by great destruction of property and the loss of many lives. During these six months, too, the grain movement, which proved such a noteworthy feature the last six months, did not run much ahead of the previous year, in certain sections actually falling behind. The 1896 grain harvest, it will be remembered, had been of great magnitude, but in the spring-wheat districts the yield of that cereal did not come up to the phenome­ nal out-turn of the previous year, and the resulting contraction in the wheat shipments from those dis­ tricts counted as an adverse circumstance against many of the large systems extending out from Chi­ cago. As a matter of fact there was a small falling off at Chicago the first half of the year in the receipts even of corn, oats and barley. The comparison at other primary markets was but little better, the deliv­ eries of wheat, corn, oats, barley and rye at Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Toledo, Detroit, Cleveland, Peoria, Duluth, Minneapolis and Kansas City com­ bined having been 213,149,446 bushels in the 26 weeks of 1897, against 204,085,860 bushels in the same period of 1896, giving an increase of only about 9 mil­ lion bushels. At the seaboard, though, there was a more marked increase, the 1897 receipts having been 160,681,070 bushels, against 92,755,067 bushels in 1896. Still even here the gain the second six months was very much heavier, as we shall presently see. The last half of the year the entire situation changed. Dollar wheat again gladdened the hearts of the farmer and of the entire community. Further­ more, the country was once more blessed with bounti­ ful harvests, while the rest of the world had to con­ tend with a shortage. The demand for our cereals reached extraordinary proportions. The increased movement of wheat alone was sufficient to give the roads in the agricultural sections a new era of pros­ perity. But in addition the high prices realized by the farmers for their products made these classes un­ usually prosperous, and through their enlarged pur­ chases stimulated the movement of merchandise and general and miscellaneous freight. The East­ ern manufacturing centres in turn felt the quick­ ening influence, and the close of tariff legis­ lation helped further to promote trade re.vival, which thereafter continued to spread and to gain in force. As a consequence the monthly returns, which in June had shown only 2T7 per cent increase, in July showed 5T6 per cent increase, in August 12-40 per Fcent, in September 14T 4 per cent, in October 8*97 per cent, in November 20*79 per cent, and now for Dec- 112 THE (JH&ONICLE. ember 12*37 per cent. The improvement for Nov­ ember was exceptionally large, because then compar­ ison was with a month last year when things were at their lowest ebb, the effects of the starting up of mills, factories, &c., which occurred after the November election not appearing in earnings until some time subsequently.

The increase here is, roughly,. 95 million bushels, and all but about 9 million bushels of it, as already indicated, occurred during the last six months. We may note that in 1895 the receipts had been only 429,477,590 bushels. Thus in two years the addition has been over 216 million bushels. We may say that, roughly, this is equal to five million tons. of freight. Below we show the grain receipts in de­ tail in our usual form, both for December and the fifty-two weeks. It will be seen that the smaller spring wheat movement the early part of the year is reflected in a falling off of about 8|- million bushels in the wheat deliveries at Duluth. It should not be overlooked that the great improve­ ments in results the last six months occurred, too, in face of some adverse influences of large magnitude. From July 4 until well towards the close of Septem­ ber there was a general strike of the bituminous coal miners, embracing Western Pennsylvania and Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. During September, October and a part of November the yellow fever put an em­ bargo on trade in the South. Furthermore, railroad rates in nearly all sections of the country became steadily more demoralized, the decision of the U. S. Supreme Court the previous March declaring the Trans-Missouri Freight Association an illegal body having loosened the bonds between the roads. Many prominent railroad officials question whether GRAIN FOR FIVE WEEKS ENDING DECEMBER 3 the rates realized on competitive business left RECEIPTS OF FLOUR AND AND SINCE JANUARY 1. any profit to the roads.
