Use of materials in our special collections is reserved for serious scholars, and access to these items is determined by the director of the Working Men's Institute (WMI) and its board of trustees.\n\n2. After reviewing finding aids and determining that secondary sources are inadequate or unavailable, researchers may request items from the archives\n\n3. Requested items will be brought to the researcher in the public reading room where all work must take place. Notes may be taken. However, all photographing, scanning, transcribing or in any way copying of an item must be cleared by the director.\n\n4. Any materials reproduced or quoted in papers or publications must give credit to the WMI as their source. Requests to use materials in papers or publications must be submitted in writing for approval by the board of trustees of the WMI."
