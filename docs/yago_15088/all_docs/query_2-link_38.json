        "text": "I've \"rescued\" two photographs belonging to the WARDER Family. The first is one of Willell \"Willi\" WARDER which was taken at the T. J. Stevens Studio in Maysville, KY. The photograph was taken in the 1860's with Willi appearing to be in her teens at the time the photograph was taken. A note on the back also says \"This was taken four years ago.\" The second photograph is of Isabel WARDER which was taken at the J. G. Mangold Studio in Du Quoin, IL. Isabel appears to be in her teens or 20's at the time it was taken. Based on limited research I was able to locate the following information regarding this information:\n\nWillella “Willie” H. WARDER was b. 4 Aug 1850 in Maysville, KY to parents William Henry WARDER (1821-1894) and Cordelia or Cordella Green ARTUS (1822-1854). Willella was one of four children born to this couple including, Walter James; Harriet Mary “Hattie”; Willella; and Cordelia or Cordella “Corrie” W. WARDER all born between 1847 and 1853. After his wife died William remarried and had 5 additional children including, William Henry; Byrd; June; Amy; and Fred Norcum WARDER, all born between 1857 and 1878. Willella married Ormond Griffith SEXTON (1848-1925) and they had two children, Cordelia “Corrie” (b. 1880) and Ormond Griffith Jr. (b. 1888). Willella died 18 Mar 1939 in Tampa, FL.\n\nIsabella “Belle” WARDER was b. 10 Oct 1848 in Flemingsburg, KY to parents Joseph WARDER (1810-1887) and Anne Thomas KIRKHAM (1822-1890). Isabella was one of 12 children born to this couple including, Mary Elizabeth; Virginia S.; Isabella; Walter; Corrie; William H.; Anne “Annie” Gertrude; Jude; Byrd “Birdie”; Amy; Frederick Morcom; and Walter Joseph WARDER, all born between 1844 and 1879. Isabella married William Hershel BUNDY (1846-1938) and they had three children, Marian “Mamie” or “Mayme” BUNDY (1873-1961); Benjamin Thomas BUNDY (1877-1953) and Elizabeth “Lizzie” T. BUNDY (b. 1878). Isabella died 29 Jun 1883 in Carbondale, IL.\n\nI am hoping to return the photographs to family and would appreciate you contacting me if you are a member of this family, or you know someone who might be.\n\nThanks,\n\nShelley"
