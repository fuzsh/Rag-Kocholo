CALEB FOULKE (WILLIAM5, GWEN4 EVANS, MARGARET3 JOHN, JOHN AP2 EVAN, IEVAN KNOWN AS EVAN ROBERT1 LEWIS) was born February 05, 1735/36 in Gwynedd, Pennsylvania, and died January 25, 1811 in Philadelphia, Philadelphia Co., Pennsylvania. He married JANE JONES January 21, 1762, daughter of OWEN JONES and SUSANNAH EVANS. She was born 1741, and died Abt. 1815 in Germantown, Philadelphia Co., PA.\n\nNotes for CALEB FOULKE:\n\nHistorical Collections of Gwynedd, by H.M. Jenkins pg 259-60 - Caleb was a merchant in Philadelphia; he doubtless went there early in life, and engaged in business. His name is among the signers to the non-importation agreement of October, 1765. for many years his firm consisted of himself and his younger brother Amos, the name being \"Caleb and Amos Foulke.\" (Papers thus signed I have, of 1774.) Later, however, Amos seems to have retired, as the firm in 1790 (and perhaps earlier), was \"Caleb and Owen Foulke,\" the junior partner being Caleb's eldest son. The latter firm did a large foreign trade; among other things they exported flaxseed and imported linens from Newry, Belfast, ad Cork. These operations were, however, finally disastrous; at Caleb's death his estate was heavily involved, a debt to a London firm being large. In 1776 he had bought the Owen Evans farm, on the Swedes Ford road (now the estate of J. Lukens), and this he made his home during the British occupation of Philadelphia, and at other times, and perhaps permanently resided there toward the close of his life. In 1813, the sheriff of Montgomery county, Isaiah Wells, sold it in the hands of his executors, his sons Caleb and Charles, and it was bought by his widow. Jane, who sold it to Dr. Joseph Meredith in 1814. Jane d. in Germantown in 1815; her will was proved December 14th. She appoints her sons Caleb and Charles executors, and names her daughters Lowry Jones, (wife of Evan, of Gwynedd), and Hanna and Jane Foulke.\n\n1762 (document offered for sale on internet) - Partly-printed colonial bond in which \"William McConnell Jr. ... in the county of Roan Province of North Carolina, Traders ... bound unto Caleb Foulke of the City of Philadelphia...\"\n\nOctober 1765 signs the non-importation agreement in Philadelphia opposing the Stamp Act.\n\n1771 George McCandless leased 345 acre Patterson's regulation (Baltimore Co., MD) to Caleb Foulke, and also conveyed 50 acres of Wetherall's Last Addition and Pearsons Outlett to same\n\n1772 Caleb Foulke was the business partner of Jonathan Jones, son of Owen Jones, the Provincial Treasurer who was also Caleb's brother-in-law. Owen Jones led a little revolt in Philadelphia against the expansion of the open air farmer's Market along High Street, which involved the destruction of the construction and pamphlets using words like Freedom and Tyranny.\n\nAt our Monthly Meeting held in Gwynedd the 28th of the 5th 1776\n\n4th Our friend Caleb Foulke gave in a Certificate for himself and his Wife and their Children viz Owen, Hannah, Caleb, Jane and Lowry from Philadelphia Monthly Meeting dated the 26th of the 4th mo last wherein they acquaint this Meeting that they both are friends in good esteem; orderly in life and conversation and careful in the attendance of Religious Meetings, their children Minors. Which was read in this Meeting and well received.\n\nIn January 1778, Caleb Foulke became the Clerk of Gwynedd Monthly Meeting. When the American forces left the area after the British evacuated Philadelphia, Jun 1778, General Smallwood of Maryland breakfasted with Caleb Foulke as the army pulled out.\n\nCaleb Foulke was involved in large scale land speculation in Pennsylvania, New York and Maryland.

Ezekiel Cleaver and Thomas Shoemaker are appointed to visit her to endeavour to find her Sincerity therein.\n\nAt our monthly Meeting held in Gwynedd the 26th of the 3rd mo of 1776\n\n4th The friends appointed to visit Hannah Foulke report that they did accordingly and signified that she seemed desirous to be continued in membership and they believe sincere in her acknowledgement and therefore it is accepted of by this Meeting and received on trial of her future conduct\n\niv.

It passed out of the family by sale to John K. Bready, in 1848. Jacob Spencer dying without a will, his land was divided, by mutual agreement, among his three sons, each receiving a release from the other heirs. These releases were executed in the Spring of 1783. Jarrett received a part of the old tract of 200 acres which Samuel Spencer, 2nd, had conveyed to Jacob, in 1746, and he also received the tract of 47 acres, which Jacob had bought in 1768 of John Care, and Maty, his wife,' and which adjoined the homestead property, lying on two streams, affluents of the Pennypack, and extending out to the \" Keith road,\"  now the Willow Grove and Doylestown Turnpike. (Out of this tract of 47 acres, a curious irregularly shaped \" meadow lot\" of 5 acres was sold by Jarrett to his brother John, Fourth month 2, 1783, as appears by an old deed preserved by Jesse F. Spencer.) A neat draft of the property of Jarrett Spencer, made by Robert Loller, the distinguished surveyor, is among the same collection of papers. This was made in 1783, and shows Jarrett's possession of about 86 acres. (The adjoining properties were those of Thomas Hallowell, Daniel Ryan, Robert Barnes, \" land now or late of Paul Penington,\" and Jacob Spencer.) In 1784 he bought of Caleb Davis, and Margaret, his wife, a tract of 65 acres and 97 perches, and in 1785 sold 8 acres and 114 perches of this to his brother John. It lay along the township line between Moreland and Horsham, and adjoined other land of John's.\n\nJarrett Spencer died Fifth month 17, 18 19.

He was placed apprentice to the carpenter's trade, and afterwardsfollowed that business many years.\" At the period of his religious convincement \"it was a time of great civil commotion, ... and about this period he was drafted as a soldier of the Revolution. While many of the younger members ofthe Society were caught with the martial spirit of the day, he was constrained to maintain his testimony, in support of which he suffered an imprisonment of sixteen weeks.\" \"Having scruples respecting the propriety of doing the ornamental work that was put on buildings, and persons generally declining to meet his scruples by giving him such parts as he was easy to do, he was many times under great difficulty in relation to the means of living, particularly when there was little building of any kind to be done.\" (The memorial says, however, in a later passage, that he retired from business many years before his death, having acquired a competence.)

This was put up by Dr. Franklin. The rod came into the bedchamber in the second story on the gable end, eastern side, and there being cut off from its communication with the rod descending to the ground, the intermediate space of about one yard was filled up with a range of chime of bells, which whenever an electric cloud passed over the place were set to ringing and throwing out sparks of electricity. These bells remained some time after Daniel Wister occupied the house, and were at last reluctantly taken down, to quiet the fears of his wife. Mr. C.J. Wister, who told me of this, told me they even played and conducted electricity sometimes in the winter.\n\nMore About DANIEL WISTER: Occupation: Merchant\n\nChildren of LOWRY JONES and DANIEL WISTER are:\n\ni.

His estate was settled by Roberts Vaux, Esq. of Philadelphia, adminstrator. An obituary article in MS., among the Cadw. Foulke papers (taken apparently from a Philadelphia newspaper) says he was brought up by his grandfather (John Evans who left him valuable bequests), and lived with him till 1805, when he engaged as an apprentice to a mercantile house in Philadelphia. The article describes him in terms of warm praise as a very exemplary and much beloved man, devoted in his leisure to literature and scientific studies, and with \"talents and acquirements remarkably devoted to the good of his fellow creatures.\" He was one of the Directors of the Public Schools; of the Pennsylvania Institution for the Deaf and Dumb; a Manager of the Apprentice's Library, and actively interested in other public institutions.\n\nChildren of JOHN EVANS and ELEANOR YAXLEY are:\n\niii.

CADWALADER EVANS (JOHN5, JOHN4, CADWALADER3, EVAN AP2 EVAN, IEVAN KNOWN AS EVAN ROBERT1 LEWIS) was born December 25, 1762 in Gwynedd twp., Philadelphia (now Montgomery) Co., PA, and died October 26, 1841 in Philadelphia PA. He married HARRIET VERENA MUSSER, daughter of JOHN MUSSER.\n\nNotes for CADWALADER EVANS:\n\nHoward Jenkins:\n\nCadwalader Evans, jr., was the son of John and Margaret. He was born at Gwynedd, December 25, 1762, resided there until 1812, when he removed to Philadelphia, and died in that city in 1841. He received a good education, and with unusual energy and mental vigor, made his mark early. He was trained as a surveyor, and for many years, in his own neighborhood and elsewhere, followed his profession with success. In the mature and later years of his life he performed important work in surveying in distant parts of the State, especially the western counties. In 1790 he was first elected to the State Legislature, and he then entered upon a lengthened career as a member of the House. He was chosen continuously from Montgomery county for nine years, -1790 to 1798 inclusive, -his colleagues including James Vaux, Jonathan Roberts, Nathaniel B. Boileau, Frederick Conrad, and other prominent and able men. Among these, though he was under thirty when first elected, he at once took a prominent part, being placed on important committees in his first year; his name appears in many places in the House journal coupled with that of Albert Gallatin, and others of the most distinguished members in that period. In 1798, the last year the Legislature met in Philadelphia, he was unanimously chosen Speaker of the House. Again in 1802, and in 1805, he was elected from Montgomery county, and in 1814, after his removal to Philadelphia, he was elected one of the city members.\n\nIn 1816 he sold the old family homestead in Gwynedd to Charles Willing Hare, Esq., of Philadelphia. He was one of the local directors of the Bank of the United States, after its recharter in 1816. In 1813 he had been among the first to actively urge the construction of a canal along the Schuylkill, from Philadelphia to the coal regions, and he was elected the first president of the Schuylkill Navigation Company, and served in that capacity for many years. In 1830, when, on account of advancing age, he resigned the presidency, the stockholders, at their annual meeting, voted that he should be presented a silver vase as a testimonial of their high appreciation of his services. Joseph Foulke, in his manuscript Reminiscences, furnished the author, says of C.E.:\n\n\"He began his distingushed career about the 18th or 19th year of his age. One of his first engagements was surveying for the road jury, and laying out what is now called the \"Lower State road\", at least the western section of it terminating in what is now the Bethlehem turnpike. This was in 1786. He was a man of quick and clear perception, of ready utterance, and a powerful disputant; he was eminently gifted in conveyancing, and in drawing instruments of writing....The last office he filled, I think, was one of the electors that made Gen. Harrison President, in 1840. As a surveyor in old time, though a young man, he stood high, and great confidence was reposed in him. He, Robert Loller, and Archibald McClean did most of the surveying in our parts until about 1807, when Cadwalader Foulke came to Gwynedd and took a large portion of the business.\"\n\nChildren of CADWALADER EVANS and HARRIET MUSSER are:\n\ni.

A.D. 1807, aged 69 yrs, 11 mo., 21 d., 14 h., 10 m., and was interred at Exeter on the 6th, the 2nd d. of the week. Abraham Lincoln of Berks Co., the son of Mordedai and Mary Lincoln, was born in Amity Township, Philadelphia Co., subsequently Berks Co., Pa. His father, who died in May of that year, a few months before the birth of Abraham, was the ancestor of President Lincoln. Abraham was brought up on his father's farm. He received a fair education, and became quite prominent in the affairs of his native county. For six years, from 1773 to 1779, he held the office of County Commissioner. He was an active patriot,and was appointed one of the sub-lieutenants of the county Mar. 21, 1777. He served in the General Assembly from 1782 to 1786, and was a delegate to the Pennsylvania Convention to ratify the Federal Constitution in 1787. He did not sign the ratification. Under the act of March 14, 1784, he was appointed one of the Commissioners of Fisherics. He was a member of the State Constitutional Convention of 1780-90, and appears to bhave been a man of much influence in that body. He died at his residence in Exeter Township, in his seventieth year.\n\nThe Lincolns were Congregationalists and the Boones Quakers, consequently Anne Boone's marriage to Abraham Lincoln was \"out of Meeting,\" and considered a disorderly act.
