        "text": "CITY OF SPRINGFIELD - 523\n\nEDUCATION.\n\n(RETURN TO THE TITLE PAGE)\n\nThe schoolhouse dates almost as far back in Springfield as the \" earliest inhabitant.\" In 1804, there were but eleven houses, most of them built of hewed logs; yet, in 1806, we learn that there was a church organized in Nathaniel Pinkhard's Schoolhouse, on the northeast corner of Main and Market streets. In this house the owner taught the first school in the town. From 1812 to 1824 or 1825, Samuel Smith taught the principal school, first in the New-Light meeting house-southwest corner of Main and Center streets-afterward in a house owned and built on a lot owned by him on the north side of Main street, west of Mill Run.\n\nIn the year 1819 or 1820, a Mr. Higgins opened a school in a frame house -south side of Main street-on or near the lot where John P. Allen's jewelry store is now located. A little later Mrs. Minter, wife of a lawyer resident in the town, had a school on Main street, in a small brick house on the lot known as the homestead of the late John Bacon, Esq. Mrs. Minter was succeeded by Mrs. Foster, who occupied the same small brick building. Isaac Teller, Esq., was a teacher of note, who taught about the year 1830, in a frame house, north of Main street, on the grounds known as the Seibert stand, now owned and occupied by William Burns' liquor store. Mr. Teller was left-handed, and his surviving pupils say he was rightly named, for with that left hand he made his strokes \"tell\" with lively effect. One of his pupils says that he was seldom free from marks so inflicted. A little later, two schools were taught in the old Methodist Episcopal Church, situated on the northwest corner of Market and North streets--one by Napoleon Platt and the other by Miss Eliza Cary. The building was an old style frame house, a part of which is still standing. In the autumn of 1824, James L. Torbert located in Springfield and opened a school. He was a man of fine classical education, and while he taught mainly the common English branches to meet the demand of the times, he took great pleasure in bringing up a number of his pupils into the higher branches, both in mathematics and the ancient languages. In the latter he was particularly proficient. He taught a number of years and was admitted to the bar, practiced law many years, was elected Judge of the Court of Common Pleas, and afterward Judge of the Probate Court. Reuben Miller was also a teacher of note from the year 1828. He and Judge Torbert taught in the same school, on the northeast corner of Market and North streets, for a time. He acted a part of the time as County Surveyor. He taught a number of years and afterward served as County Auditor for eighteen years. But as the town increased in population and schools and teachers became more numerous, it is now difficult to name the teachers, their location, etc. Following the two teachers last named, from about the year 1838, we find the names of Cheshunt, Lancey, McWilliams, Stimson, Robert Black, William King, William Reid, Jane Reid, Richard Morris, Miss Brown, Miss Lee as teachers, extending over a period of ten or twelve years, up to 1848 or 1850. A contemporary says, that \" schools were kept in a little frame house, corner of Spring and Columbia streets; a one-story brick, between Factory and Mechanic streets on Columbia; in the basements' of the Universalist and Associate Reform Churches, and up-stair rooms.\" They were called subscription schools, by which it was meant that the teachers were paid\n\n524 - HISTORY OF CLARK COUNTY.\n\nby the voluntary subscriptions of the parents and guardians of the children. This was entirely so during the first years of the schools, and largely so up to 1838, and to some extent thereafter.\n\nIt should here be stated that no record can be found giving any information touching the public schools of the town before the year 1850. All the facts given have been obtained from those left among us, whose lives commenced with the. early years of the century. We have, therefore, been the more careful to put in permanent shape this small 'gleaning of early school history, from the fact that up to the time when the town of Springfield was merged into the city of Springfield, no record whatever is left showing even the existence of schools in the town, much less their character. But this will appear less remarkable when it is stated that no record can be found showing that the town of Springfield had any legal existence--any town council or municipal organization whatever-while it was a town only. But when it became a city, at once it seemed to realize its new importance, and commenced to keep up its own biography: And it is from this journal record of the City Council, that we find any written recognition of the existence of our schools. The first meeting of the City Council occurred May 18, 1850. The first notice of the schools appears in the journal of the City Council of December 25, 1850, as follows: \"On motion, Robert Black and John Ludlow were appointed managers of the public schools, and it is agreed that said managers receive as compensation for their services $1 each per day, for the time actually employed in said schools, provided the services so charged, do not exceed $15, each, for six months.\"\n\nUp to this time, it does not appear that the teachers were employed by a Board of Directors, but that each teacher furnished his own school room, and that parents and guardians \"subscribed\" the number of pupils, each, that they desired to send to his school, and that the managers appointed by the Town or City Council, twice a year, took the number of pupils attending each school, and, upon this basis, made an estimate of the amount to which each teacher was entitled to be paid out of the public funds, and reported accordingly. And whatever additional compensation was received by the teacher, was paid by the parent or guardian according to the number of children sent to the school. The schools appear to have been kept six months each year, and the reports of the managers were made for the first and second quarters, as no report can be found of the third and fourth quarters.\n\nThe journal of the City Council of April 2, 1851, contains the following record, viz.: \"Robert Black and John Ludlow, managers of common schools, presented the certified account of the teachers of public schools for the first quarter; thereupon said account was audited by the council and found to be correct, and the Recorder ordered to draw orders in favor of said teachers on the school fund for the amounts respectively due them as follows: Samuel Wheeler, $60.13; Sarah Ann Foos, $40; William King, $46.27; Messrs. Reynolds & Co., $105.50; J. C. Scholze, $43.12; William Reid, '78.54; Emily Osborn, $40.41; Alvina H. Woods, $44.37; Caroline G. O. Heal, $30.14; Virginia Peters, $25; Sarah J. Rea, $28.12; Marie Johnson, $34.37; E. Parker, $57.70; making a total of $643.67, expended for first quarter.\" A like report was made by the managers, twice a year, up to June 12, 1853. In the meantime the subject of building schoolhouses at the public expense began to be agitated, and, on the 5th of February, 1851, the City Council passed an order directing the \" Mayor to give notice to the householders and resident tax-payers to vote at the annual election for or against a tax to purchase one lot and build two school houses, for the purpose of common schools.\" On the following March 4, the journal shows the following result: \"372 votes given for a school tax and 86 votes against a school tax, and it was declared to be carried.\" The Council pro-\n\nCITY OF SPRINGFIELD. - 525\n\nceeded very leisurely, and, February 23, 1853, Alexander Downey and W. A.. Kills, the Building Committee, reported the purchase of a lot in the east part of the city for $2,000, and one in the west for $1,452.29, and the report was confirmed. These lots are the present locations of the Eastern and Western Schools. The same \"committee, January 23, 1854, presented a draft for the schoolhouses now needed by the city, which was accepted, and notice to receive proposals to build said houses was ordered.\" Contracts were executed for the construction of two schoolhouses according to the plans presented by the Building Committee. The buildings were to be of the same dimensions-about sixty by one hundred feet, two stories high. They had what were called \"flat roofs\" of tar and gravel, and altogether their external appearance was, to say the least, not attractive. In point of convenience and adaptation, the internal arrangement was no greater success than the external. Standing distant from any other buildings, their flat, invisible roofs, and square tops gave the whole a nondescript aspect, which we must leave to the imagination. When the Board of Education took charge of these houses in 1855, it found their roofs leaking badly, and, to remedy this, and to give them a more sightly exterior, the board immediately made contracts for raising the walls about four feet higher, and for putting on shingle roofs, as they now have.\n\nThe first Board of Education in the city of Springfield was elected April, 1855, consisting of three members, viz., Chandler Robbins, Joseph Brown and C. H. Williams. The board organized April 28, Charles H. Williams, President, and William Anderson, Clerk. Probably Springfield has never had a better Board of Education than its first. They were men of liberal education and practical knowledge in school matters, and two of them had large experience as teachers in the higher branches. The schools were therefore organized intelligently and with good judgment, and did good work from the beginning. F. W. Hurt was elected Superintendent at a salary of $80 per month; John Fulton, Principal of the Western, and Daniel Berger, Principal of the Eastern School, at a salary of $55 per month. R. W. Morris and Samuel Wheeler were elected assistants at a salary of $40 per month. Also the following teachers: Misses Minerva E. Criley, Virginia Miller, Clara Gallagher, Carrie Smith, Lizzie Crooker, Ellen A. Whiton, Elizabeth Cummings, Sarah A. Bruscup and Eliza Norton-salaries $25 per month. The janitors were allowed the same salary. M. V. Satis was employed as teacher of German. But the crowded condition of the schools made it necessary to obtain additional school rooms. Rooms were rented in the basement of the Congregational Church, in which was established the Central School, which soon after took the character of the high school, John Fulton, Principal, S. M. Wheeler taking his place as Principal of the Western School. One circumstance created quite a breeze in the community this first year. The Superintendent complained to the board in regard to the deportment of one of the Principals toward him. The board took no action in the case. A week after-November 12-the Superintendent renewed the charges against the Principal. The board considered the matter, and, on motion, laid the whole subject on the table. The subject came up again January 18, and the board \"earnestly exhorted the two gentlemen to lay aside their hostility, and engage heartily in mutual efforts to promote the interests of the schools.\" The following month the Superintendent was arraigned before the civil authorities on a charge of inflicting punishment upon certain pupils, unnecessarily, and unwarrantably severe. The trial was held in a crowded court house. The result of the trial is not remembered, but, for the same cause, the board requested his resignation, and failing to resign April 1, the board declared the office of Superintendent vacant. The services of a Superintendent were dispensed with for the remainder of the year.\n\n526 - HISTORY OF CLARK COUNTY.\n\nAt the spring election the Board of Education was elected under the provisions of the act of 1853, and was composed of six members, viz., Chandler Robbins, Joseph Brown, C. H. Williams, Harvey Vinal, E. G. Dial and Richard Beebe. The succeeding year the board did not employ a Superintendent, but had his services performed, as well as practicable, by appointing one of their number as \"managing agent\" from time to time. But the following year, August 4, 1857, James Cowles, a graduate of Yale College, was elected to the Superintendency. He was a fine scholar and upright, Christian gentleman, but for reasons not now distinctly remembered, he failed to secure harmony and confidence between himself and the teachers, and, at the end of the year, a resolution was passed, \"that, for the present, the services of a Superintendent be dispensed with.\" A few weeks afterward, Chandler Robbins was elected to the office of Superintendent, and served with great acceptance and profit to the schools for one year. At the end of the year he was re-elected, but he declined to serve longer on the terms of the past year. On the pith of February, 1858. the Western School building was destroyed by fire. And eighteen months after, the Eastern building- was damaged by a storm to the amount of several thousand dollars. These two incidents were detrimental to the schools, in that no adequate accommodations could be had while the re-building was going on.\n\nIt should have been stated that the first action of the first Board of Education of the city of Springfield was to pass an order \"to continue the colored schools.\" In 1848, a law was passed to provide schools for colored children. This was the first provision made in Ohio for that purpose. The law went into effect soon after its passage, as when the public schools were organized in this city, we find the colored school in existence. A building was rented for these schools for a number of years, and, when this was found insufficient, the board purchased a beautiful lot on Pleasant street, and put up a substantial brick house, equal in character and adaptation to any of the school buildings of the city. It has been the design of the board to make the colored schools equal in all respects to the others. An effort was made some years ago by colored parents and others, to have the board remove all distinctions in this regard, but the board has held to the idea, that it is better for all concerned that the colored schools be kept separate from the white, but that no further distinction should be made-the colored schools to receive equal attention, and to be made equal to the white in point of school accommodations and institution. And when colored children are sufficiently advanced in scholarship to enter the high school classes, they are permitted to enter such classes on an equal footing with the white children.\n\nAs numbers increased, the Board of Education, from time to time, made additional provision for the accommodation of the schools, by erecting or renting small buildings or both. But, in 1867, it was found necessary to provide large additional accommodations, and accordingly, a school building was erected the following year on beautiful ground on South Limestone street, as large or larger, than either of the existing houses, and, at once, every room was occupied. Again in 1871, the board purchased of Rev. J. L. Rogers the female seminary building and grounds for the sum of $27,150, to be used for school purposes.\n\nBut the improvement surpassing all others was that of the high school building, situated on the corner of High and Factory streets, built in the year 1875. Its reported cost was $70,893.51. The President's report says: \"There. has been but one opinion expressed by the educators of the State who have examined the building, and that is, that, it is a model schoolhouse.\" The exterior of the building is very fine to look upon, its stories are very high, and its halls are so broad as to occupy a large portion of the house-prob-\n\nPAGE 527 - PICTURE OF WILLIAM COFFEY - PLEASANT TP\n\nPAGE 528 - BLANK\n\nCITY OF SPRINGFIELD. - 529\n\nably one-third or more. In point of show, it is certainly a grand success. In regard to the fitness and adaptation, it is perhaps equal to like buildings in other cities erected under like circumstances.\n\nIn his report of 1878, under the head of \"School Accommodations,\" the Superintendent makes the following statement, viz:\n\n\"The schools of the city occupy six buildings. The central or high school building has eleven assembly rooms, one recitation room, library room, and Superintendent's office. It furnishes sittings for 743 children. Two assembly rooms and the recitation room, in this building are occupied by the high school.\n\n\"The north building has seven assembly rooms occupied, and two unoccupied, besides several rooms not adapted to school purposes. It furnishes 323 sittings. \"The south building has eight assembly rooms, and furnishes sittings for 518 children.\n\n\"The east building has eight assembly and furnishes sittings for 356 children.\n\n\"The west building has eight assembly rooms, and furnishes sittings for 450 children.\n\n\"The Pleasant street building has four assembly rooms, and furnishes sittings for 216 children.\n\n\"Total sittings in the city, 2,648.\"\n\nThe Pleasant street building-the colored school-has been recently enlarged to the extent of double its former capacity. \"The buildings are all in good condition, and the furniture of the modern and improved style.\"\n\nWithin the year, 1880, a school building has been erected in the northwestern part of the city of a capacity equal to either of the other buildings except the high school, and it is now nearly completed. This building will afford 350 to 400 sittings, making an aggregate of over three thousand sittings. Thus it will appear that Springfield, like most other cities in the State, has been most liberal, not to say profuse, in providing the material part of school accommodations for our youth.\n\nThe advancement of our schools will also appear by a statement of the number of teachers employed at periods running back a quarter of a century. In 1855, there were fourteen teachers employed in the schools including Superintendent and Principals. In 1860, there were eighteen including the same. In 1865, there were twenty-four teachers. In 1870, there were thirty-four teachers. In 1875, there were forty-two teachers, and, in 1880, there were sixty-two teachers, including Superintendents, Principals and teachers of all the grades.\n\nThe enumeration of youth of school age, and the enrollment for the past eight years are as follows:\n\nEnumeration. Enrollment.\n\n1872-73.................................................4,047 2,120\n\n1873-74 ................................................4,293 2,242\n\n1874-75.................................................4,536 2,439\n\n1875-76.... . ......................................... 5,102 2,590\n\n1876-77.................................................4,994 2,835\n\n1877-78.................................................5,212 2,520\n\n1878-79.................................................5,683 2,683\n\n1878-80.................................................5,789 2,964\n\nThe expenditures for all purposes-including tuition, janitors, salaries and incidental expenses, amount paid on building and interest on bonds-for the last six years, is as follows:\n\nFor the year ending August 31, 1875..............................$66,055 85\n\nFor the year ending August 31, 1876............................... 74,844 62\n\nFor the year ending August 31, 1877............................... 62,690 93\n\nFor the year ending August 31, 1878............................... 58,617 26\n\nFor the year ending August 31, 1879............................... 48,364 32\n\nFor the year ending August 31, 1880............................... 82,257 80\n\n530 - HISTORY OF CLARK COUNTY.\n\nWhen the debt incurred for building purposes shall be paid off, it is believed that the annual expenditures may be materially diminished, without in any respect detracting from the efficiency of the schools.\n\nThe following is the course of study of the high school for the first year, Latin and German being optional:\n\nFirst Year-First Term-Ray's New Elementary Algebra, Hutchinson's Physiology, Hill's Elements of Rhetoric and Composition, Harkness' New Latin Reader and Grammar, Worman's German Course.

One-half day in each week, in the high school is devoted to rhetorical exercises.\n\nThe history of the public schools from their inception is necessarily incomplete, because as already intimated no record has been kept, but the above sketch from Hon. E. G. Dial who has been more or less connected with our schools during his life may be relied upon as accurate.\n\nTHE SPRINGFIELD HIGH SCHOOL.\n\nOn the 1st day of March, 1834, the General Assembly passed an act to incorporate the Springfield, High School in the town of Springfield, Clark County. Ohio. The town at hat time contained a population of about thirteen hundred inhabitants, and is noted as a brisk, enterprising village. The question of improved school facilities had for some time been agitated, and the matter was then taken up and put in tangible form. Little idea can now be had of the interest which this movement awakened in the village; nor of the magnitude of the work to a community in which as yet there was little wealth, and the country around was yet but sparsely settled. It was the question of the day, and men of all parties and religious denominations, united heartily in this measure, and worked harmoniously together. Among them we find the names of Gen. Mason, Gen. Anthony, Judge William A. Rogers (long Secretary of the board), Dr. R. Rodgers, Dr. B. Gillett, Jeremiah Warder, Edmund Ogden. Reuben Miller, James S. Halsey, Levi Rinehart, John Bacon, Charles Cavileer, Henry Bretney, Samuel and James Barnett, William Werden, John Whiteley, James Reid, Rev. Edward H. Cumming, Rev. John S. Galloway, and John M Gallagher (editor of the Republic), nearly all of whom are still represented by families in Springfield.\n\nCITY OF SPRINGFIELD. - 531\n\nUnder the above-mentioned law, a Board of Trustees immediately organized, and in a short time purchased a lot on East High street, the present site of the Springfield Seminary, of Peter A. Sprigman, and proceeded to solicit sub scriptions for the erection of a high school building. An amount was soon obtained to justify the commencement of the work, and the same was prosecuted vigorously to completion. In the year 1835, the high school was organized tinder Milo G. Williams as Principal. A considerable amount of apparatus was obtained as soon as possible, and a nice little library, as well as the commencement of a cabinet. The plan of the school was to make it preparatory to a collegiate course when desired, and not only preparatory, but to pursue the collegiate branches as far as the junior year in college. This not only furnished the youth of Springfield the means of obtaining a partial collegiate education at home., but it brought in young men, from the country and from the surrounding counties, who desired to lay the foundation of a liberal education. And if early catalogues of the high school were in existence, names would be found therein that had since graced the country's history. Among them, Hon. Samuel Shellabarger, Judge William White, of the Supreme Court of Ohio, Hon. R. A. Harrison, Hon. William D. Henkle, Judge A. F. Hume, of Hamilton, Ohio, Hon. John S. Hume, late editor of the St. Louis Democrat, Rev. George W. Harris, Drs. Joseph and James Stout, Dr. George H. Bunyan. Some of these went from the high school to Miami University, at Oxford, Ohio. Some to the Ohio Wesleyan University at Delaware, Ohio, entering the junior class in each institution, and one to Luton College, New York, while others completed their academic education in the high school. But while the high school thus afforded such facilities for commencing and pursuing the higher studies, it also had a primary and intermediate department which received a large attendance from the town. Mr. Williams resigned his position in the school in 1841, and was succeeded by Chandler Robbins, an educator of equal ability with his predecessor. Mr. Robbins, with one or two assistants, continued the character of the school as above stated, and, while the elementary English branches were thoroughly taught, also Greek and Latin, algebra, geometry, surveying, and the like, were thoroughly taught, and the more so, that no more studies were allowed to be pursued at the same time than could be thoroughly mastered. Mr. Robbins continued Principal of the high school until 1845, when he resigned to accept a professorship in Augusta College, Kentucky. Thus in the first ten years of the existence of the high school, it had become one of the most prominent academies of the State, and its reports and proceedings were published in the leading newspapers of Ohio.\n\nIn the meantime, it was proposed to transfer the school and all pertaining to it, to the Ohio Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church. And such a proposition was made to the conference at its session in Urbana in September, 1841, and accepted by it, and, on the 7th of March, 1842, an act was passed by the Ohio Legislature \"To incorporate the Ohio Conference High School in the town of Springfield,\" with the following persons as Trustees, viz.: James B. Findlay, Zachariah Connell, William Young, Reuben Miller, John Bacon, James Barnett, William Werden, Levi Rinehart, Henry Bretney, Lemuel Reynolds, Joseph S. Carter, Edmund Ogden, Samson Mason, David Gwynne, Edward H. Cumming, Robert Houston, William M. Murdoch, William A. Rogers and William Marshall.\n\nThus the institution became denominational in form, though not so as to its Trustees.\n\nProf. Robbins was succeeded byRev. Solomon Howard, as Principal of the school in 1845, and then for the third time it became a \"mixed school,\" admitting girls as well as boys. The public schools were taking character, and, in\n\n532 - HISTORY OF CLARK COUNTY.\n\norder to sustain the high school, a broader patronage was sought, without changing the character of the school in other respects. And the school continued successful under the conduct of Prof. Howard, who was energetic and thoroughgoing, and was especially proficient in mathematics. He resigned in 1852, to accept the Presidency of the Ohio University at Athens, and was succeeded by Rev. John W. Weekly as Principal.\n\nIn the year 1854, an addition was made to the high school building, more than doubling its proportions, and made with the design of converting it into a girls' boarding school. And a new charter was obtained under the name and title of the \" Female College and Springfield High School.\" Mr. Weekly continued at the head of the institution until 1860, when he resigned and was succeeded by E. G. Dial, who continued for four years and resigned. He was succeeded by Revs. W. J. Ellsworth and J. W. Herron, on, the former resigning at the end of one year. Mr. Herron was President of the institution up to 1869, when he resigned and had no successor. The Board of Trustees after waiting for a few weeks and receiving no application for the position, and finding no one who would take charge of the institution, finally executed a lease of the property to the Board of Education of the city of Springfield for five years, the same to be used for the public high school. A little before the expiration of this lease, the Board of Trustees executed another to a corporation newly formed, under the name of the \" Springfield Seminary.\" The boarding school had been abandoned, and the design was to establish a school for girls without reference to patronage from abroad, and to be entirely undenominational in its character. Accordingly Mrs. Ruth A. Worthington was employed as Principal of the seminary, with competent assistants. This board of instructors does not undertake to do more than it can do well. The Principal is exact and thorough in all her work, both as to discipline and instruction, and the assistant teachers catch the same spirit. The course of study is liberal. Mathematics and natural science are taught as thoroughly here as in any girls' school within our knowledge. So is Latin, French, English literature and the other branches. The school numbers about sixty pupils, all residents of this city. It is doing an excellent and a most indispensable work. The building needs to be enlarged and additional apparatus and library. It is difficult to see why all these needs are not supplied, where the means are so abundant to put the institution on a permanent basis. It in no way conflicts with the public schools, but supplies a demand which would be sought elsewhere, if not found at home. Every kind of enterprise in the way of manufactories is in a glow of prosperity and success, yielding splendid returns, while a school whose returns are of more value to its youthful recipients than all the golden profits, \"lives on through all ills,\" because of its own inherent vitality.\n\nOne of the most prominent educators of the city was Rev. Chandler Robbins, A. b1., Principal of the Greenway Boarding School. He was born in Jefferson County, Va., February 20, 1818; was educated at Kent's Hill Academy, Maine, and Wesleyan University, Middleton, Conn. By invitation of the Board of Trustees of the Springfield High School, he came here in the autumn of 1840, took charge of that school, and continued it successfully for five years. In 1845, Mr. Robbins accepted the professorship of Latin and Greek of Augusta College, Kentucky. Three years thereafter, he returned to Springfield and established a select school for boys, under the name of the Greenway Boarding School. The same year of his return, he was admitted to the order of Deacons in the Protestant Episcopal Church, by the Right Rev. Bishop of the Diocese of Ohio, and to the full order of Presbytery, A. D. 1849. He became Pastor of Christ Church immediately upon receiving orders, and continued in that position until the year 1855. About that time, he induced the Vestry of his church to\n\nCITY OF SPRINGFIELD. - 533\n\naccept his resignation, as he insisted that the interests of the church demanded the exclusive attention of its minister, which he could not give. Rev. John T. Brooke, D. D., succeeded him. Mr. Robbins was very successful as an educator. The institution over which he presided had an extensive reputation. Among those who studied within its walls were Gen. Wager Swayne, of Toledo, Ohio; Gen. John Mitchell, of Columbus, Ohio; Judge William White, of the Supreme bench, and Hon. R. A. Harrison, of Columbus. Mr. Robbins died in this city May 8, 1871.\n\nIn the year 1849, Rev. Jonathan Edwards, now of Danville, Ky., had charge of a small select school for ladies. This school was held in the basement of the First Presbyterian Church. It was of a classical nature, and all the branches of a modern seminary were taught with efficiency. The school received great encouragement from its patrons, who subscribed for its support. It was conducted for several years by Mr. Edwards, and, in 1852, he was succeeded by John A. Smith, a gentleman of education and enterprise. Prior to the time that Mr. Smith had charge of the school, an effort was made to establish it on a broader basis, and with greater facilities under the charge and support of the Presbyterian Church. A number of citizens in 1852 took an active interest in this educational venture, among them Dr. Robert Rodgers, James Barnett, Isaac Ward, William Cooper, Dr. N. C. Burt and James S. Christie, who organized a company, and in that year obtained a charter for the Springfield Female Seminary. They selected John A. Smith as Principal, and made a further effort to induce the Presbyterian Church to assume the responsibility of the support of the institution, but nothing more could be accomplished than a recommendation of the seminary as an advantageous school for young ladies. The company which organized the seminary held control of its interests, and managed its affairs, selecting the Principal and the corps of teachers. The building erected was commodious, and located on the site which from an elevated position overlooked the city and surrounding country. The grounds were ample, containing an area of more than four acres.\n\nThe buildings were erected for the purpose to which they were for twenty years assiduously devoted. Special attention was given to secure thorough ventilation, and to provide every other appliance necessary for the comfort and health of the pupils. The rooms were carpeted and neatly furnished, and the whole establishment lighted with gas, and heated by the most approved steam apparatus.\n\nThe noble purpose of the founders of this institution was to establish a school of the highest grade; a school where religion should have a prominent place, where the heart should be cultivated in connection with the intellect where the daughters might receive an education which would fit them for the proper discharge of the important duties awaiting them in active practical life.\n\nRev. L. H. Christian succeeded Mr. Smith as Principal in 1854, who was followed by Rev. Charles Sturdevant in 1855. During the administration of the latter the institution became embarrassed, and heavily in debt. An arrangement was made with Mr. Sturdevant, and the Board of Trustees, by which the former assumed the liabilities, and the company conveyed their interest to him. In 1857, Rev. James L. Rogers purchased a one-half interest in the institution from Mr. Sturdevant, and was associated with the latter in the management of the seminary and in the instruction of the scholars. In 1860, Mr. Sturdevant sold his remaining interest in the seminary to Rev. Henry R. Wilson, D. D., who became the Principal. and five years later Mr. Rogers purchased the inter est of Mr. Wilson, and became sole owner and head of the institution. During the years 1865 and later, the seminary attained its highest degree of efficiency. It sustained a high reputation throughout the State. Its high moral tone, its\n\n534 - HISTORY OF CLARK COUNTY.\n\nstrong corps of educators, and the care and culture of its pupils made it a favored institution.\n\nIt continued its successful career until the year 1871, when the grounds and building were sold to the Board of Education of the city of Springfield, for the sum of $27,150, and Springfield lost an institution which for years had been a prominent and attractive feature. At the time the institution was closed, the following was the corps of instructors: Principal, Rev. James L. Rogers, A. M.; teachers in the literary department, Miss H. V. Haas, Miss 111. E. Mackintosh, Miss E. 111. Sawyer, Miss S. J. Turner, Miss S. E. Goble; teachers in the musical department, Prof. Ed Hardik, Miss Helen J. Macbeth; teacher of French, Prof. John Barthelemy; teacher of painting and drawing, Miss Rebbie Rodgers.\n\nWITTENBERG COLLEGE.\n\nFor beauty and healthfulness, the location of Wittenberg College is not surpassed by that of any other college in the State, or in the entire country. The college with the residences of its professors constitute one of the suburbs of the thriving city of Springfield. The college building proper occupies an elevated situation, comprising as its campus, forty-two acres of ground, skirted by the beautiful stream and valley of Lagonda, and finely shaded with sugar, oak and elm trees of the natural forest, thus rendering the situation of the college perfectly unsurpassable for both beauty and variety of scenery. Wittenberg College was chartered on the 11th day of March, A. D. 184, by an act of the General Assembly of the State of Ohio, which provided that John Hamilton, of Stark County; William G. Keil, and David Tullis, of the county of Guernsey; John B. Beck and Solomon Ritz, of the county of Tuscarawas; George Leiter, of the county of Richland; John H. Hoffman and Jacob Roller, of the county of Columbiana; Elias Smith, of the county of Wayne; Presley N. O'Bannon, of the county of Licking; John N. Kurtz, of the county of Clark; Philip Binkley, of the county of Greene; David Porter Rosemiller, Frederick Gebhart and Peter Baker, of Montgomery County, and George Sill, of the county of Preble, members of the Board of Directors appointed by the English Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Ohio, and Miami Synod, to establish a college at some suitable point in Greene or Clark Counties, State of Ohio, are hereby created a body corporate and politic, by the name, style and title of the Board of Directors of Wittenberg College, and they and their successors in office, as such, have power to sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded, to defend and be defended, in all courts, of equity; to have a common seal, and to alter it at pleasure; to hold all kinds of estate which they may acquire by purchase or donation to any amount necessary, to accomplish the objects of the institution, and to have and to convey at discretion; to form a constitution and by-laws for their perpetuation and government; to make all necessary regulations for the management of their fiscal concerns; to admit, exclude and expel members: to appoint officers, and to do such other acts as may be necessary to effect the promotion of theological and scientific knowledge; provided, however, that said constitution, by-laws and regulations, shall be consistent with the Constitution of the United States and the State of Ohio.\n\nThe following persons comprised the first Board of Directors of the college:\n\nOfficers-Rev. G. W. Neil, President; Rev. John Hamilton, Secretary; Rev. John B. Reck, Rev. C. C. Guenther, Rev. T. J. Ruth, Rev. George Leiter, Judge D. Tullis, Judge J. Roller, J. Lawrence, E. Smith and George Welty, from the Synod in which the institution originated.\n\nTo these were added, from the Miami Synod, Ohio, Rev. D. P. Rosenmiller, Rev. George Sill and Mr. Frederick Gebhart.\n\nCITY OF SPRINGFIELD. - 535\n\nThe institution is in connection with that branch of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, represented by the \"General Synod of the United States.\"\n\nIt originated in the religious and educational want of the Lutheran Church in the West-then so called.\n\nUnder that twofold necessity, the promotion of higher education and the practical Christian piety in the Lutheran Church, the ministry and laity comprising the members of the English Synod of Ohio, at a convention held in Washington, Guernsey County, in the month of November, 1842, Resolved, That in reliance upon the Triune Jehovah, and alone for His honor and glory we do now establish a Literary and Theological institution.\n\nThe district Synods represented in the Board of Directors are: The Synod of East Ohio, the Synod of Miami and the Wittenberg Synod, comprising the territory of the State of Ohio, and the Synods of Northern Indiana, and Olive Branch, in the State of Indiana. The Directors of this institution may, however, be elected by any Lutheran Synod in connection with the Evangelical Lutheran General Synod, which shall adopt the constitution of the college and pledge itself to its support. The representation from each district synod in connection with the college is as follows:\n\nTwo Directors for every ten clerical members of synod; four for fifteen; six for twenty; eight for twenty-five; ten for thirty; and twelve for forty or more members; provided, always, that one-half are laymen, and that one-half the representation of each synod retire from office at the same time.\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors are elected for four years, and are eligible to re-election. The present board is comprised of thirty-six members; thirty-four of whom are from the synods above named; and two from Clark County. Those at present from Clark County are Hon. S. A. Bowman and Mr. Ross Mitchell.\n\nThe Rev. Ezra Keller, D. D., a graduate of Gettysburg College, Pennsylvania, with the Class of 1835, was the first President of the college.\n\nDr. Keller opened the grammar school of the college on the 3d day of November, 1845, in the lecture room of the First English Evangelical Lutheran Church, of Springfield, Ohio. The attendance, on the first day of the session, was eight students and a Faculty of one professor and two tutors. This was increased to seventy-one before the close of the first year, and to 143 during the second year. Three years of steady progress passed away without any unusual occurrence in the history of the institution, but the fourth year opened with an event which filled the hearts of the friends of the infant college with deep anxiety and profound sadness. After a brief illness, the summons of death came to the first President of the institution, in the midnight hour of the 29th day of December, 1848. He was called away from the most of his arduous labors, and in the vigor and prime of his life. He died in the thirty-seventh year of his age.\n\nMr. Joseph Welty, of Tuscarawas County, Ohio, and Mr. Sauerwine, were associated with Dr. Keller during the first term of the institution.\n\nUpon their withdrawal in the month of March, 1846, H. R. Geiger and Michael Deihl, also graduates of Gettysburg College, Pennsylvania, were chosen as professors in the institution.\n\nAfter the death of Dr. Keller, Rev. Samuel Sprecher, then Pastor of the First English Lutheran Church at Chambersburg, Penn., was elected to the Presidency of the institution.\n\nHe was publicly inducted to the chair of Christian Theology in the seminary and as President of the college on the 14th of August, 1849.\n\nIn the year 1850, Isaac Sprecher, nephew of Dr. Sprecher, became connected with the institution, first as Principal of the Preparatory Department,\n\n536 - HISTORY OF CLARK COUNTY.\n\nand later as Professor of Ancient Languages, the chair of which he resigned at a regular meeting of the board held in the month of June, 1877.\n\nTo Dr. Sprecher, Prof. Geiger, Prof. Deihl and Prof. Isaac Sprecher - four teachers long identified with the Wittenberg College, two of whom still remain-Drs. Sprecher and Geiger-the Lutheran Church and the patrons of the college at Springfield and elsewhere, owe a debt of gratitude for their devotion to the cause of higher education, and to the general interest and welfare of Wittenburg College through its darkest hours, and its long\" years of struggle and weakness. Only those who, with their families, have had the experience can appreciate the toil, privation and trial, connected with the establishment of an institution of learning. Meager salaries, as a rule, in proportion to what the professors and teachers could realize elsewhere, and hard work, is the common lot of the teacher and professor in a Western college.\n\nIn failing health Prof. Deihl resigned the chair of ancient languages in 1868, to which he had been chosen in 1846.\n\nAfter the lapse of scarcely a year, he was borne to his burial, honored, beloved and lamented by all who knew him. Having been so long connected with the institution, his influence extended far beyond the college and the city, and his moral worth and spiritual power were above estimate.\n\nFrom October, 1873, to the collegiate year ending June, 1880, Rev. J. H. W. Stuckenberg, D. D., a graduate of the college with the Class of 1859, was associated with Dr. Sprecher in the theological department. Upon the resignation of Dr. Stuckenberg, Rev. S. A. Ort, D. D., a graduate from the college in the Class of 1863, and, at the time of his election, Pastor of the St. James Lutheran Church, New York, was chosen to the chair of sacred philosophy, vacated by Dr. Stuckenberg.\n\nAmong those associated with the faculty of the college, in the past history of the institution, we find the names of Rev. J. G. Harris, T. A. Burrows, Morris Officer, A. J. Imhoff, Rev. F. W. Conrad, D. D., the present editor of the Lutheran Observer, then for a period of five years from 1849 to 1854, Professor of Sacred Rhetoric, Pastoral Theology and Modern Languages. Also Rev. A. Essick, A. M., Professor of Natural Sciences, Rev. Joel Swartz, D. D., Professor of Church History, Homiletics and Pastoral Theology.\n\nRev. S. A. Ort, at present Professor of Sacred Philosophy, was at a former period assistant professor in the mathematical department of the college. Upon his resignation of that department in October, 1874, Rev. S. F. Brackenridge, of the Class of 1860, entered upon the duties of Professor of Mathematics, to which chair he was duly elected at the next regular meeting of the board in June, 1875.\n\nHenry G. Rodgers, of the Class of 1864, was first tutor, then Principal of the Preparatory Department for a period of years. Prof. Rodgers and wife returning from the East, on their bridal tour, were among the victims of the fatal Ashtabula disaster.\n\nProf. Rodgers was a capable teacher, and above all, also a noble Christian man. Prepared for the messenger of death as he and his Christian wife doubtless were, it will nevertheless always be a sad thought that their departure had to be associated with such a horror.\n\nThe following persons have also been engaged in teaching in the Commercial and Preparatory Department of the institution: A. S. Kissell, Edward Harrison, W. B. Yonce, Maurice Kirby, John A. Ruhl, William I. Cutter, J. F. Reinmund, John F. Mitchell, J. W. Goodlin, Thomas Hill, Charles L. Ehrenfeld, at present State Librarian of Pennsylvania, George S. Sprecher, son of Dr. Sprecher, J. Krediel, B. F. Prince, W. W. Evans, Dr. A. H. Shultze. George H. Young, W. S. Hoskinson and F. D. Altman. For several years past, Prof. P.\n\nPAGE 537 - PICTURE OF LEMUEL HUNTER\n\nPAGE 538 - BLANK\n\nCITY OF SPRINGFIELD. - 539\n\nRobertson, of Dayton, Ohio, has given instruction in elocution to the satisfaction of both the faculty and the students.\n\nAfter a quarter of a century of arduous and successful labor at the head of the institution, Dr. Sprecher resigned its Presidency, in order to devote his time more fully to the writing of theological works, long contemplated by him self, and as constantly urged by his friends, and long also a felt want in that branch of the Lutheran Church in which he is, beyond question, the profound theologian and the eminent teacher. Upon Dr. Sprecher's resignation, at a regular meeting of the College Board in the month of June, 1874, the Rev. J. B. Helwig, then Pastor of the First English Lutheran Church, Dayton, Ohio, and a member of the Class of 1861, was elected to the Presidency of the college.\n\nAt the writing of this sketch, the following persons comprise the Faculty and instructors at Wittenberg College: In the Theological Department, Samuel Sprecher, D. D., LL. D.; Frederick Gebhart, Professor of Systematic Theol ogy; S. A. Ort, D. D., Culler Professor of Sacred Philosophy; in the college, J. B. Helwig, D. D., President and Professor of Moral Sciences and Political Economy; S. A. Ort, D. D., Professor of Mental Philosophy: H. R. Geiger, A. M., Ph. D., Professor of Natural Sciences: B. F. Prince, A. M., Professor of Greek and History; S. F. Breckenridge, A. M., Professor of Mathematics and Logic, also teacher of Latin; Chair of English Literature, vacant; Chair of Latin, vacant; Prof. Haake, teacher of German; G. H. Young, A. M., Principal of the Preparatory Department; W. S. Hoskinson, A. M., Tutor; F. D. Altman, A. B., Teacher of Penmanship; instruction in elocution by Prof. P. Robertson, Dayton, Ohio; B. F. Prince, Librarian.\n\nDr. Geiger's professorship at the college has extended through a period of thirty-four years. That of Dr. Sprecher thirty-one years.\n\nProf. Prince has been teaching in the various departments of the college for a period of fourteen years.\n\nDr. Helwig, Profs. Breckenridge and Young, for a period of seven years each. Prof. Hoskinson, two years. Dr. Ort, in his present position, from the opening of the present collegiate year.\n\nThe attendance of students upon the instruction in the various departments of the institution during the collegiate year of 1879 and 1880 was 175, an increase over any of the ten preceding years. These were distributed as follows: Theologians, 18; collegians, 68; electives, 18; preparatorians, 71.\n\nThe full preparatory course now comprises three years. The collegiate, either classical or scientific, four years, and the theological course two years. The alumni of the theological department number 164, of whom 114 are graduates of the college. The alumni of the college number 288.\n\nSixty-one students have graduated from the city of Springfield.\n\nFifty-five from the alumni of the college have entered the legal profession. Of this number now in the city of Springfield are the following, namely: S. A. Bowman, J. J. Snyder, A. H. Gillett, George C. Rawlins, Oscar T. Martin, Amos Wolfe, W. L. Weaver, C. R. White, Milton Cole, J. F. McGrew, James Johnson, Augustus N. Summers, Charles S. Bogle, J. L. Zimmerman, and others.\n\nOther graduates have entered the medical profession, while others still are occupying professors' chairs in the colleges and theological seminaries. A large number occupy prominent positions as principals and superintendents of public schools and academies, while not less than four hundred have been engaged as teachers in the various departments of our common schools.\n\nThere are three literary societies connected with the institution-the Excelsior and Philosophian for the gentlemen, and the Hesperian or the Ladies' Society.\n\nThese societies meet every Wednesday afternoon for exercises in composi-\n\n540 - HISTORY OF CLARK COUNTY.\n\ntion, declamation and debate; and they occupy a very important place in promoting the literary culture and ability of their members. The libraries of the college and societies contain 800 volumes.\n\nA reading-room, under the control of the students, was established a few years ago, in which are found the leading papers and magazines of the day. The college cabinet has many valuable geological specimens, collected and arranged for the purpose of illustrating lithological and historical geography. It has also been recently well supplied with minerals and curiosities from the Pacific coast and the Sandwich Islands.\n\nIn 1874, the college was opened to women. Since that time, at least fifty young ladies have availed themselves of its advantages. Two have been graduated from the college, while nearly all the classes in the institution have those who are pursuing the regular college course. Students are matriculated at fourteen years of age.\n\nWittenberg College has no prescribed course of elective studies, either for gentlemen or ladies, for which she confers degrees.\n\nHer alumni have been graduated chiefly from the classical course. The scientific course, arranged a few years ago, has been made equivalent, in time and work, to that of the classical.\n\nThe prevailing political sentiment at Wittenberg College has been anti-slavery; and in the country's peril, during the civil war, she had honorable representatives in the army and navy for the Union. The young men of Wittenberg have not been studious only, but patriotic as well.\n\nWittenberg College was founded in prayer and religious consecration, and, from its origin to the present day, services pertaining to the Christian religion have been steadily maintained in the institution. And, while the aim has been to maintain religion and morality as positive factors of influence in the college, yet the religion taught has been in no sense sectarian. The broad and fundamental principles of the Christian religion, combined with those moral precepts which are practically helpful to a useful life, and which enter into the formation of an incorruptible character, are inculcated in the college, rather than any denominational doctrines or characteristics.\n\nNearly all the religious denominations have been and still are, from time to time, represented among the students, and with no detriment or injury to any denominational preferences which they hold.\n\nAt the daily chapel service, at which those rooming in the college are expected to be present, the exercises consist of the reading of Scripture, singing and prayer. These exercises are conducted by members of the College Faculty. On Thursday evening of each week is held the regular college prayer-meeting, upon which students are invited and urged to attend, but beyond that, their attendance is voluntary.\n\nAlthough nearly all the parts of our country have been represented by students in Wittenberg College-as, for instance, over one hundred thus far from the State of Pennsylvania-yet the four great States, viz., Ohio, Indiana, Michigan and Kentucky, comprise the special field in the branch of the Lutheran Church, as represented in the General Synod, from which Wittenberg College chiefly draws her supplies of means and of students. Her Board of Trustees are residents of these States. With sufficient means to provide additional and still advanced facilities for education, no institution of learning in this country has a more promising field and future than has Wittenberg College.\n\nINDUSTRIAL INTERESTS.\n\nThe industrial interests of Springfield are of such vast importance that it has been deemed advisable to appropriate a separate chapter to the history of\n\nCITY OF SPRINGFIELD. - 541\n\nthat feature. This chapter has therefore been prepared by Thomas F. McGrew, Jr., who has elaborately and faithfully portrayed the origin, growth, development and present magnitude of our manufacturing interests.\n\nThe inventive, as well as the mechanical, genius of the Champion City of Springfield is wonderful to contemplate. From the early days of the single-shovel plow and the reaping sickle, to the present day of sulky plows, grain drills, corn planters and mowing machines, the genius of our people has kept pace with all wants to such an extent that to-day not only this country,\" but the whole world, is being supplied with agricultural implements of all kinds from the factories within our limits, the products of which exhibit to trade and commerce the ability and excellence of our manufactories. They have produced such improvements in agricultural implements that even the wise men from the east must come to this inland town for what have become farming as well as household necessities. Not long after our first settlement, the water-wheel and steam-engine took the place of horse-power. In early times, the driving qualities of our people built mills for grinding the cereal productions of the Lagonda Valley. Stove foundries soon followed, then the great turbine water-wheel, the mowing machines, grain drills, threshing machines, corn plows, cider-mills and steam-engines, became part of our every-day productions, until now the whole city is one din of machinery, managed and directed by men engaged in making the different implements and shipping them to all parts of the globe, to help mankind to plant, care for and harvest the crops that bring food, wealth and prosperity to the country.\n\nThe natural manufacturing facilities of this city are not large. Almost, if not all, of the water-power has been made by the hand of man, or perhaps, more properly speaking, what nature has deprived us of, the efforts of our enterprising citizens have brought to our door. Many years ago, and at intervals since, the plan of building a water-power, or aqueduct, from Mad River on the north into our city limit has been a theory much thought of; but, while some were spending time looking and thinking over this plan, the steady utilization of timber, stone, brick, mortar and steam-power, has so filled our city with shops and factories that power has been sought in another direction. That is, from steam, the simplest and cheapest power yet invented. The greatest expense in the use of steam is fuel, and Springfield was remote from the coal-fields. This deficiency in manufacturing facilities has recently been removed by the construction of a railroad from this place to Jackson County, Ohio, reaching the coal-fields at that point. Now fuel is more abundant, and easily obtained, if not cheaper.\n\nTo those who can remember the old grist-mill, saw-mill and woolen-factory, in the days when the little log cabin stood where the soldiers' monument now stands, this grand change is like a transformation, which is to them as a child growing into manhood, and becoming not only great and good, but the admiration of all.\n\nThe number of manufactories in the city make it a manufacturing place of no small dimensions, and, while she stands sixth in the State in point of population, her manufacturing interests place her much higher in this list, and it would be bard to find in the whole country another town of its size with anything like the proportions of Springfield in this direction. The extensive factories and small shops, now inclosing some five square miles of floor room, and giving regular employment to over four thousand hands, is a living testimony to the driving qualities of our manufacturers. This condition of business is continually enlarging. The earlier industries were more the work of necessity than profit, the mill to grind the corn for food, the saw-mill and the loom were all built to provide the necessities of life to those who came here to spend their days in making a home for those who would come after to reap the harvest that\n\n542 - HISTORY OF CLARK COUNTY.\n\nthey planted for them. Among the very first, if not indeed the first, to engage in any manufacturing venture in this city, was the determined early settler, James Demint, who, in 1803, built, at the mouth of Mill Run a grist-mill of small proportions, which ground away a whole day to produce a few sacks of meal; but such was the convenience of this mill to the settlers of that day that no complaint was made, but, with pipe and gun, they would go and watch the meal run out, like the sand from an hour-glass, while they would exchange the news of the neighborhood with each other.\n\nSimon Kenton was the next to build a mill, at the point where the village of Lagonda now stands, of which mention is made in connection with the manufacturing interests of that place.\n\nIn Mr. Woodward's sketches of Springfield, he writes: In 1807, Robert Rennick built a flouring-mill on Buck Creek, where Bechtle's old mill was formerly situated, while Mr. Ludlow, in his early history of Springfield, states that this mill was built in 1802. Robert Rennick built a grist-mill either in 1802 or between that and 1807, on Buck Creek, opposite the Bechtel farm, and, from all information gained, it was an improvement on the others; so, to have been an improvement on them, it must have been built after them. Most likely the Rennick mill was built after the Demint and Kenton mills. This was a flour and grist mill, and provided for the wants of the settlers of that day. In 1809, John Lingle built a mill for making gunpowder, near where Mill Run flows into Buck Creek. His magazine for storage stood near where the present City Hall now stands. About 1814, Maddox Fisher built a mill near the mouth of Mill Run, whether a grist or cotton mill, or both, is not a settled point, but it was either used for both at the same time or at different times, and was known as the Fisher Mill until destroyed by fire in 1834. About the same time (1814), Ira Paige and Jacob Woodward had a woolen-factory near where the old paper mill stood, on Mill Run.\n\nIn 1817, Griffith Foos had a small mill in operation where the shops of the. Champion Bar & Knife Company now stand. The same year, James Johnson commenced the manufacture of cut nails, which was a matter of no small importance to the citizens at that time. In 1827, Ambrose Blount, James Lowry and Jacob Kills built the paper-mill on Buck Creek. Part of said mill is now standing, and will be mentioned in connection with the Ellster Table Factory. This brings us to the time of more extensive improvements in the manufacturrng line. About 1820, Joseph Perrin built and operated a sawmill on or near where Engert & Dunkel at present have the ice-pond, west of the Lagonda Pike, and south of the C., S. & C. R. R., about five hundred yards southwest from the crossing of those roads. In 1838, Richard Rodgers built and operated a saw-mill one-half mile below the present village of Lagonda. The water-power used by these mills afterward was turned into the Barnett Hydraulic. In the winter of 1840-41. Samuel and James Barnett purchased of Joseph Perrin, Richard Rodgers and Jeremiah Warder, land and water right, and made the first artificial power of any magnitude. The Barnett Hydraulic, to the present day, supplies power to several large mills. After preparing the power, Samuel and James Barnett built and operated until 1847, a merchant flouring-mill, and to-day the mill stands, with numerous modern improvements, one of the best flouring-mills in the country. In 1847, Samuel Barnett bought his brother's interest, which he held until 1859, when he sold out to William Warder and W. A. Barnett, who have run the mill up to this date, and are now adding improvements to it which will place them in a better condition to compete in the market with the vast number of large mills of the highest class. In 1841, Samuel and James Barnett sold to James Leffel one-twelfth part of the water-power of the hydraulic; also the same amount to Richard Rodgers.\n\nCITY OF SPRINGFIELD. - 543\n\nJames Leffel started a saw-mill and foundry. Soon after, he and Andrew Richards built and run a cotton-mill and machine-shop, which passed through several different hands, until now it forms part of the great Buckeye Works. Richard Rodgers re-sold his power to James Barnett, who built a linseed-oil mill, which he sold to John Foos. This mill is also part of the Buckeye shops. In 1847, the Barnetts leased land and power to Christie, Muzzy and Andrews, who operated a planing-mill, afterward conducted by Kindleberger, and now also part of the Buckeye shops.\n\nIn 1847, the Barnetts sold Rabbitts and Olds the land and power for woolen-mills, which they and others operated with good success until 1874, when the power was sold to Warder and Barnett, and the mill property is now used by Blount & Wilson for the manufacture of agricultural implements. In 1842, John A. Pitts, inventor of the Pitts separator, removed from Rochester here, and bought land and power from the Barnetts, and built shops for manufacturing the Pitts separator. After his death, his sons came into possession of the shops, which have passed through different owners, until the present time. They are now operated by the heirs of James W. Rinehart and Charles P. Ballard and L. H. Pursell, under the firm name of Rinehart, Ballard & Co. Mr. Pursell, the only living member of the firm, is a young man of ability, and to his special attention is due much of their prosperity. This firm manufacture very largely of threshing machines. The shops of the company are situated on the southeast corner of Limestone and Warder streets, and are well adapted for the manufacture of these machines. The Pitts separator, as made by them with their modern improvements, speaks in many a farmer's yard of the great manufacturing genius of our city.\n\nIn 1846, the Barnetts leased land and power to Olly Taylor, who built a linseed-oil mill, which passed to Smith & Dew, then to Smith & Boucher, then to Steel, Lehman & Co, then through John Foos to the Buckeye Works. Henry Croft, Sr., one of the pioneers of Clark County, claims to have been the first inventor of the county, and, while his manufacturing ventures have been in a small way, his inventions are quite a credit to him. In 1846, he built a corn sheller that would shell, large amounts of corn per day, separating the grain and cobs. This was run by horse-power, and was such a success that he was called upon to make some for his neighbors. The same year, Mr. Croft made a separator, and, as he had never seen one before, the credit of the invention in his case was not small. This machine he put on wheels, and was the very first ever in this county on wheels. This one Mr. Pitts saw, and it is claimed by Mr. Croft that from his machine Pitts got the notion, and ever afterward put his separators on wheels. Mr. Croft also made razor-strops, watch keys and hook combined, and, in 1870, he manufactured the Croft Windmill, which is now in the hands of E. C. Leffel, the youngest son of James Leffel, who intends in the near future to erect large shops and push the manufacture of these engines with his best energy and ability.\n\nIn 1829, Henry Bretney, started the manufacturing of leather, which has been carried on by himself and son, at 116 East Main street, ever since 1830, the time Mr. Bretney established himself. Mr. Bretney gave the business his special attention up to the time of his death, in 1869. At that time, the business passed into the hands of his son Charles, who still runs the tannery and general supply business.\n\nThe pioneer carriage manufacturer is David West. He built the first buggies and carriages, in 1.837, at or near where his present factory stands, on West High street, between Market and Center streets.\n\nHe has pushed every point, and now has factory room for 100 hands. The business of this concern grew from manufacturing old-style vehicles to the\n\n544 - HISTORY OF CLARK COUNTY.\n\npresent style of phaetons, side-bar buggies, carriages and coaches, which are finished in the best quality of workmanship. Close behind Mr. West came the Driscol brothers, Elias and James, who started at the carriage manufacturing in 1847, James having been connected with John Beal some two years before in the same business, about one block west of their present shop, No. 48 West Main street. The business of Elias and James Driscol has been carried on by them and their sons since 1847, with the exception of three years. In the year 1870, Asa Whitehead and W. D. Cushman bought the business and ran it for three years. During part of that time, George and John Driscol, sons of James, carried on business some three blocks west of the present factory. In 1873, James Driscol and his sons bought the old business and returned to their starting-ground. Since that time, their business has grown so large that it is now considered one of the great interests of Springfield. In connection with their carriage manufactory, they run a planing-mill, and are manufacturers of carriage wood-work of all kinds. The building of vehicles for the road is very extensively carried on at this time in our city. H. Fehl & Co., of West Main street. Otstot and the Lawrence Brothers on East Main street, are engaged in the same business, besides many other small interests, to add their work to the busy life of this mechanical city.\n\nThe number and value of mills, factories and little shops that clot our town can only be understood when it is known that there are over one hundred of them within our city limits that can lay claim to be manufacturing some particular article of daily use. To mention all of these in chronological order would be almost impossible, from the fact that we have been unable, in many cases. to procure dates and other information regarding them. At the extreme west end are the old furniture factories, used for a long time for making furniture. now used to make the wood-work of the Royal St. John Sewing Machine. On :Main street, near Shaffer, is the factory of Evans & Foos Manufacturing Company, formerly the Evans Manufacturing Company, established in 1876 by J. M. Evans and three brothers, and run by them to September, 1880, when G. S. Robert and W. F. Foos were added to the. firm, and renewed efforts were put forth in the manufacture of corn planters, corn drills and harrows. Near them are the shops of Woliston, Chambers & Burnett. Mr. Woliston formerly manufactured the Whitelly plow, but in 1870 the present firm began operations for the manufacture of sash, doors, blinds, etc. Up to 1880, they also made the I X L plow, but have discontinued that for the present. The Springfield Malleable Iron Company was incorporated in 1878 by S. C. Warner and eight associates, and their foundry was built in the western part of the city, where that company has very fine shops, and are well equipped for manufacturing malleable castings. They now make some two hundred tons per month. Mr. S. C. Warner was one of the very first to make malleable iron in this country, first starting in Connecticut, and then at Cleveland, where he started large malleable foundries. From there he came to Springfield, where he started two concerns. He was one of the few who have made the manufacturing of malleable iron a life study, and, while equipping his last venture, was taken away by death from his friends, with whom he had spent so many busy days. The Eureka Foundry, J. R. Ambrose, proprietor, is one of the busy places of which this city is so full, running continually, manufacturing parts of the Eclipse engine and doing general job work. This foundry was started by its present owner some two years ago, who, after working as molder and foreman of foundries since 1840, started on Washington, east of Limestone street, in 1875. From this point he removed two squares west to his present foundry, between Market and Center, on Washington street.\n\nThe Common Sense Engine Company was started by H. J. Creighton in\n\nCITY OF SPRINGFIELD. - 545\n\n1878, in the alley between High and Washington, Market and Center streets,, as a general job shop. A new shop is now completed, and will soon be occupied by Yakey & Byers, who succeeded Creighton. It is situated on East street, just south of Mound.\n\nNear Main street, in the alley above mentioned, is the Champion Brass Foundry of J. J. Fawcett. It was first established on Limestone street in 1873, by Kelly & Fawcett, and carried on by them some two years, when Mr. Fawcett bought the business and removed it to the present site.\n\nMany years ago, where the St. John shops now stand, Mr. David L. Croft had a silver-plating shop. From this point he removed to High street, and, after many changes, he is now established west of Center street, in the electro plate, belt clamp and blackboard-eraser business.\n\nThe early light of our city, furnished by candles, was made by Mr. Robert Thompson, who had in 1859, bought from James Bean the candle-factory which he had started some two years before. The factory stood on East Main street, at the foot of what was known as Brewery Hill. For twenty years this business was carried on in a large way, until 1879, when it had to succumb to the more civilized blaze of coal oil.\n\nThe firm of Peel & Elster began the manufacturing of dash moldings at 132 West. Main street in 1873, and removed from there to 78 South Limestone street in October, 1878, where they now make dash moldings; neck-yokes, Buckeye wringers and halters. At the same place, T. R. Way makes mill picks, a business he began in 1872, at 65 South Market street, in connection with a general job shop.\n\nAfter many years of activity in the tinware and spouting business, Mr. T. B. Peet took as partner C. A. Schuster, and started, in 1874, at 28 South Market street, second floor, a shop for making galvanized iron cornice, window-caps and finials, which business has grown to very large dimensions, and is to-day one of our important branches of industry.\n\nThe Springfield Cracker Works, started in 1872 by Stafford & Miller, have passed from hand to hand until Cartmell & Erter, the present owners, purchased the business in 1818, and removed from No. 46 West Washington street to No. 14 South Center street, where they now have works of the capacity of baking three and a half barrels of flour per hour.\n\nIn 1817, Griffith Foos had a small oil-mill on the corner of what is now Linden avenue and Monroe street. This mill is said to have been removed to East street, about where the Common Sense Engine Works now stand, and then used as a cotton-factory, and afterward as a flag-mill. In 1834, the flouring-mill known as the Fillar Mill was built on the ground where the Foos oil-mill stood, on the corner of Linden avenue and Monroe street. It was run by an overshot wheel, and was operated for many years, until, in 1871, it was bought by E. R. Hotsenpeller & Co., and used by them for a hominy-mill. In 1873, the mill was destroyed by fire. The ground was bought of E. R. Hotseupeller & Co., by the Champion Bar & Knife Company, in 1874, and the present shops of this company erected on it.\n\nThese shops are now under the management of Charles A. Bauer as Superintendent, who has proved his ability as a mechanical expert in the present perfection of the work done in these shops. No one can fully appreciate his skill, or the excellence of these works, without personal inspection.\n\nSince 1872, L. Patrick & Co., 12 South Center street, have manufactured the Patrick hot-air furnace, for heating dwellings, churches, storerooms and halls, the Star wind-mill, force pumps and lever spring beds. This business is carried on by L. Patrick and L W. Rodgers. The planing-mill of T. L. Arthur was built by Voorhis & Arthur in 1867, and operated by them until 1870, when\n\n546 - HISTORY OF CLARK COUNTY.\n\nJohn H. Voorhis bought the interest of his partner. In 1871, it was Voorhis, Hayward & Co.; in 1872, Voorhis & Spencer; in 1873, Arthur & Lightfoot; and in 1874, Thomas L. Arthur took full control, and is now operating it as a sash, door and blind factory.\n\nA. G. Bethard's planing-mill and job factory, in alley west of Market square, has been operated since 1872 by him.\n\nWilliam H. Bauroth, general job shop, on west side of Fisher's alley, between Main and High streets, has been run by him since 1874, manufacuring pulley, shafting and hangers. On North street, between Spring and Factory streets, the cement, drain and sewer-pipe factory was built by A. W. Eichelberger in 1875, where many necessities in house building are made, besides drain and sewer piping.\n\nSpringfield has had a book-bindery since 1844. At that time, J. D. Smith started in this business on Trapper's Corner. This establishment was sold to a Cincinnati man, who removed the tools to Cincinnati, Ohio. J. W. Kills & Son commenced same business in 1860, and took the place of the one removed. In 1869, the Smith concern, which had again started, in the building known as the old Protestant building, just south of High street. on Limestone, was removed to the Republic building, where it was carried on by different firms until 1880, when J. D. Smith & Co. withdrew and started a bindery at the corner of Main and Limestone streets, and the Republic Printing Company continued the same business in their building.\n\nThere are in this city two breweries-Voice & Blee, on East Columbia street, and Engert & Dinkle, corner of Penn and Section streets. Both are very large concerns, and have been in operation for many years. The Voice & Blee brewery was established in 1840; that of Engert & Dinkle in 1849.\n\nW. Burns' distillery, on East Main street, has been in operation since 1857, doing a very large business for so small a concern. It now has a bonded warehouse in connection with the stillhouse.\n\nJames Lowry & Co. (consisting of James Lowry, J. W. Kills and Dr. Ambrose Blount, father of A. A. Blount, dentist) commenced building a paper-mill in the fall of 1827, on Mill Run, between Columbia and North streets, just northeast of the Columbia street burying-ground. This mill was finished and put into operation on June 21, 1828, as a hand paper-mill, and was run as such until 1836, when it was changed into a machine-mill, with a wet machine only, and in 1840 a drier was added, and so run until May, 1861, making all kinds of paper. In 1836, the mill changed hands, and J. W. Kills & So is operated it until May, 1861, at which time they made an assignment to William D. Hill.\n\nBaker W. Peck laid the stone foundation of the above mill. In 1864, Marshfield Steel purchased this mill property and remodeled it into a tobacco factory, which was run by M. Steel & Co. up to 1867, when J. L. Kidder took possession and manufactured tobacco until 1869. Since then it has been used as a foundry, machine-shop and general job-shop, up to 1880, when it was rebuilt and occupied by J. V. Elster, who manufactures the Wright extension table. This business was started by Wright & Elster at the Stringtown shops, now used by the St. John Company for the manufacture of the wood-work of their sewing machines. The unoccupied shops of the Taylor Paint Company on South Limestone street were built in 1877, by Caleb Taylor and William Pimlott, and used in the manufacturing of dry paints by them and their successors, Taylor & Judson, who had worked up a thrifty business, but which was suddenly stopped by the death of Mr. Taylor on April 15, 1878, and who had been the manufacturing chemist of the firm. In 1869, Thomas Roberts purchased of Thompson & Kingsbury, boiler-makers, their business on Limestone\n\nPAGE 546 - PICTURE OF NATHAN NEER - PLEASANT TP\n\nPAGE 547 - BLANK\n\nCITY OF SPRINGFIELD. - 549\n\nstreet, just south of the United Presbyterian Church, which he removed to Monroe and Gallagher streets, and with his brother, B. F. Roberts, carried on the boiler-making business until 1876, when the brothers parted, each starting separate shops-one on Washington street, the other at the new shop on Bridge street, between Spring and Gallagher streets. Thomas now has the Bridge street shop, also a shop near James Leffel & Co.'s works in East Springfield. B. F. Roberts has a shop at No. 30 West Washington street. The Springfield File Works, on Bridge street, near Spring, was started by A. Noelp, at 155 Limestone street, and afterward removed to 331 East Main street, when C. Unglaub became owner, in 1875, and removed to present place in 1879.\n\nThe Springfield Brass Foundry was started by McLaughlin & Shilling, at 68 South Limestone street, in June, 1880, and bids fair to be a business of some proportion.\n\nThe Ludlow Soap Manufacturing Company started business in the fall of 1880, on Washington street, between Spring and Limestone streets. This business is the outgrowth of a small concern started many years ago by James W. Ludlow, of this city. Mr. Ludlow was with the Proctor & Gamble soap establishment, of Cincinnati, a number of years ago, and then became enamored with the business-so much so as to follow it in an intermittent way ever since. Nearly two years ago he determined to devote his entire attention to making a first-class soap, and out of that determination has developed the Ludlow Soap Manufacturing Company of Springfield, a combination that unites an abundance of capital with the energy and skill requisite to a large business. The firm is now A. R. Ludlow, J. W. Ludlow, J. S. Ludlow and T. W. Ludlow. J. S. Ludlow and T. W. Ludlow are sons of A. R. Ludlow, who is a member of the firm of Thomas, Ludlow & Rodgers, of this city. This company manufactures laundry and toilet soaps of various kinds.\n\nThe soap-factory of Mark Smith & Sons, was started in 1861 at their present place of business, on Buck Creek, just west of Market street. They first made potash and a small amount of soap until 1868, when they started to make both toilet and laundry soap in large quantities. They have now in hand the erection of a large three-story brick building, so as to enable them to meet the large-increased demand for their various productions of soap.\n\nThe saw-mill of I. B. Rawlins & Son, erected by them in 1875, is the only mill of this kind within the city limits. It is used to saw all kinds of hard lumber, and has a capacity of many thousand feet per day.\n\nThe Springfield Curved Elbow Company, on Washington street, started in 1873 by James Brand, as the Curved Elbow Company, and by M. L. Rice, its present owner, changed to the Springfield Curved Elbow Company in 1876. This concern manufactures curved stovepipe elbows in large quantities, and ship them for sale to all parts of the United States.\n\nThe collar-factory of S. T. Irvin, 64 Main street, was started by him in 1862. ' All kinds of horse-collars are made at this place, and in large quantities, for shipment.\n\nIn 1870, Deardorff, Mellen & Co., manufacturers of coffins and caskets, began business at 116 and 118 South Spring street. They manufacture and ship to all parts of the United States many thousand coffins, and caskets of all kinds, from the cheapest painted to the most costly rosewood.\n\nBoyd Hotsenpiller & Co., the pioneer manufacturers of cloth-covered caskets in the West, started on Washington street, east of Limestone street, in 1876, in the mill formerly used by Hotsenpiller & Co. for making hominy. This company make cloth-covered caskets of the very finest quality.\n\nBoyd's burglar-proof grave-vault is manufactured by a company organized for that purpose. Its buildings are on Washington street, along the railroad.\n\n550 - HISTORY OF CLARK COUNTY.\n\nThe company have placed considerable capital in the concern, and propose to push the vault with vim. As it is a new thing, it needs presentation to the people, but it will soon win public favor.\n\nThe Champion City Manufacturing Company, John A. Blount and A. McWilson, proprietors, was started in 1875, by Kissell. Blount & Co., in the old woolen-mills on Warder street. This concern is now doing a thrifty busi ness in manufacturing cultivators, hay-rakes, double-shovel plows, post-hole diggers and garden tools of various kinds. They also have, in connection with the agricultural implement business, a number of knitting machines, making large quantities of woolen stockings of all kinds, which they furuish to large dealers in woolen goods.\n\nThe Robbins & Myers Foundry was removed by them from the old Kills paper-mill property, in 1879, to their new foundry, on East Springfield, near the shops of James Leffel & Co. They began in 1877 to do foundry and machine job work. This increased so fast that they had to build new shops of large size to be able to meet the demand on them. They are now melting from eight to ten tons of iron per day, and the superior quality of their castings and work brings them large custom from abroad.\n\nIn 1861, Mr. John Foos purchased the Barnett oil-mill, which they had built in 1842 on Warder street, and in 1863 he bought the Steel, Lehman & Co. oil-mill, which was built by Olly Tayler in 1846, also' located on Warder street. The machinery in the mills he removed, in 1870, to his present place of business, on the cliffs overlooking Buck Creek, just above Plum street. This is one of the most successful industries of our city, and one of the leading oil-mills of the West.\n\nThe St. John Sewing Machine Company, organized in 1875, is also one of Mr. John Foos' projects. This company made for some time the St. John sewing machine, which has been improved into the Royal St. John, the name it now justly bears. The extensive shops of this company are situated at the corner of Main and Center streets, and are fully equipped with the very best of tools for special work. The cabinet work of the machines is done at their wood-shop, west of Stringtown, just north of the National Road. Mr. John Foos is President of this company, and E. W. Mullikin Secretary, and F. W. Foos Treasurer. The Directors are John H. Thomas, S. A. Bowman, J. S. Goode, C. H. Bacon and John Foos.\n\nThe Cottage Color Paint Company also belongs to Mr. John Foos. It was established in 1865 by Henry C. Barnett, Henry E. Folger, T. B. Peet and Leander Mudge, and removed in 1870 to its present place in the Foos oil-mill.\n\nThe Republic Printing Company, whose building occupies the site of the old National Hotel on Main street, is a joint-stock company, with a capital of $125,000. It not only publishes a daily, tri-weekly and weekly paper, has an extensive bindery, large job and press rooms, with all the facilities for accurate and modern work, but it also has a paper-mill at Enon, Ohio, of large capacity, which is in constant operation. Its job room has five cylinder presses, three jobbers, and three ruling machines in bindery. Its legal blanks have long had an extensive reputation throughout the State for accuracy and adaptability. In addition to its own publication, it prints the Live Patron, the Wittenberger Evangelist, etc. It does a business of $150,000 per annum.\n\nThe Transcript Printing Company, composed of B. O. Elifritz, C. E. Winters and J. P. Winters, have a capital of $75,000, invested in real estate, machinery, etc., in their business. Their building on High street has a front age of fifty feet, including an ell recently added, and extends back 220 feet. The firm have one of the largest job rooms in the State, and a press room which has seven cylinder presses, three power jobbers, folder, paster and coverer for\n\nCITY OF SPRINGFIELD. - 551\n\nthe book department, and a wire-stitcher for pamphlets. Their printing arrangements are unequaled. None of the late improvements are wanting. They employ sixty-two persons regularly, and have a force of thirty-five girls for the folding and other rooms. Their business amounts to $100,000 per annum, and includes large contracts in many parts of this and other States.\n\nThe very large and thrifty concern now known as the Springfield Agricultural Works grew out of an old establishment by the same name, carried on by the firm of Ferrell & Ludlow, the partners being Mr. Alphonso Ferrell and Mr. Abram R. Ludlow. Afterward, the firm was known as Ferrell, Ludlow & Co., and afterward as Ferrell, Ludlow & Rodgers-Messrs. R. H. and I. W. Rodgers being the junior partners. In January, 1872, the firm of Thomas, Ludlow & Rodgers was organized, Mr. Ferrell retiring and the Thomas brothers supplying his place. Mr. I. W. Rodgers also retired, and went into another branch of manufacturing. In 1873, the firm was organized, under its present management, into a joint-stock company, with a capital of $200,000. The buildings are very extensive, occupying the greater portion of an entire square, embracing 80,000 feet of floor, besides the foundry. Here, also, next the smith-shop, is the American Tire-Setter, which fits cold tire to the wheels with such exactness and rapidity as to be really astonishing.\n\nThe shops of this company were almost totally destroyed by fire June 2, 1873, just when most needed to get out work for the fall trade. They were re built at once, and newly equipped in the very best manner. They manufacture grain drills, cultivators and cider-mills.\n\nJ. H. Thomas & Sons, manufacturers of hay-rakes and portable engines, built their shops at the corner of Monroe and Limestone streets, in 1874. They removed from this site the frame shops long used by different companies for plow shops, brass foundry and general job work. Mr. J. H. Thomas, formerly senior partner of Thomas & Mast, has been long connected with the manufacturing interests of this city. When, in 1871, he withdrew from Thomas & Mast, it was only to look for a new business site for himself and sons, who are now connected with him in his present business.\n\nJ. H. Thomas & Sons have, from year to year, built additions to their shops, until now they cover almost half a block. Their horse hay-rakes and portable engines, like all other agricultural implements manufactured in Springfield, are champions of the world.\n\nThe Buckeye Agricultural Works is one of the mammoth manufacturing establishments of the great interior of the United States. It is owned by Messrs. P. P. Mast & Co., and it is located on both sides of Warder street, in Springfield, Ohio. The structures are compactly built, varying from one to three and five stories in height. and cover two acres of ground.\n\nThe concern had its birth nineteen years ago, the original proprietors being Mr. Phineas P. Mast, who came to this city from Urbana in 1856, and Mr. John H. Thomas, who was at that time a rising young lawyer.\n\nIn a very few years, the firm of Thomas & Mast became famous throughout the country. They invented and manufactured the Buckeye Grain Drill, the Buckeye Cultivator and the Buckeye Cider Mill, making improvements each season and enlarging their operations each year.\n\nIn 1871, Mr. John H. Thomas withdrew from the firm, his interest passing into the hands of Mr. P. P. Mast, who at once gathered about him a number of the leading and most efficient men, who, as travelers, or as designers or artisans, had been connected with the establishment, and organized the firm of P. P. Mast & Co. The machines from time to time were radically improved, the purpose of Mr. Mast and his associates being to produce the very best possible results, and to put into the market the best-made and the most useful, servicea-\n\n552 - HISTORY OF CLARK COUNTY.\n\nble machines that ingenuity could devise and that cunning and efficient workmen could construct of wood, iron and steel.\n\nYear by year the works grew to their present dimensions, and now the sev eral departments constitute one of the grandest mechanical and manufacturing enterprises of the day.\n\nIn the season of 1875 was erected, between Main and Columbia streets, in the West End of Springfield, Ohio, near the Institute buildings, one of the finest manufacturing establishments ever erected in the city. These buildings were erected by Messrs. Mast, Foos & Co., for the manufacture of tubular boilers and portable boilers and engines. This company furnished a 400-horse-power boiler to make steam for the engines of the Industrial Exposition at Philadelphia in 1876, since when the company has been incorporated as a stock company, and now manufactures Buckeye and lawn mowers, iron turbine wind engines, and Buckeye force pumps.\n\nThe old shop of James Leffel & Co., that stood on the corner of Limestone street and the C., S. & C. R. R., was one of the first manufacturing interests of the place, built as it was in 1852, by Winger & Anderson in the wood work, and Whiteley & Hatch in iron work. These two firms built box and flat cars, and in the season of 1852 they built twenty-one of the Jackson Cook reapers, the first ever built in this city. One of these reapers was sold to Mr. Andrew Whiteley. They did not prove a success as harvesting machines. After many changes in management, John Pitts, Jr., bought the greater part of the buildings, and sold his entire interest to Mr. James Leffel. In 1864, Mr. Winger also sold his interest to Mr. Leffel. These shops at that time stood on ground leased of Mr. William Whiteley.\n\nJames Leffel, the pioneer foundryman of Springfield, built his first foundry west of Springfield, on the south side of the National Road, near the Buck Creek bridge. This foundry was completed in January, 1840. These buildings are now in a very dilapidated condition. In 1846, as before stated, he and Mr. Richards built a cotton-mill on Warder street. In 1858, the foundation of the present extensive business of James Leffel & Co. was laid. At this time, Mr. Leffel was busy on a water-wheel, which he completed and had pat ented in 1862. This proved to be the very best turbine water-wheel ever invented, and a vast improvement over the old style of wheels.\n\nThe business of James Leffel & Co. was conducted, up to 1878, by Mr. William Foos, Mrs. Leffel and Mr. John W. Bookwalter, when Mr. Foos retired and Mr. Bookwalter took full control of the business, and in 1819 commenced the erection of new shops in East Springfield, where he now manufactures turbine water-wheels and the Bookwalter engines. The shops first occupied by James Leffel & Co., corner of C., S. & C. R. R. and Limestone street, was built by Air. Jacob Winger in 1852, and used as a car-shop and planing-mill. Large additions were made to this building by the Leffel company, until no more ground was left to build on, and Mr. Bookwalter was compelled to move his shops, as he has done, just outside of the corporation limits of Springfield.\n\nThe vast manufacturing interest known as the Champion Reaper manufacturers of Springfield, is, when taken as a whole, by far the largest industry of our city. This interest has five very large factories, and employ many hundred men in building their reapers and mowers.\n\nThe Champion machine was invented by William N. Whiteley, a native of Clark County, Ohio, who was raised a farmer-or at least he spent his boyhood days with his father on a farm near Springfield. At a very early age, he man ifested remarkable mechanical talent, together with inventive genius, and soon determined to abandon the farm for mechanical pursuits, which were better suited to his taste, and to that end he served an apprenticeship as a machinist.\n\nCITY OF SPRINGFIELD. - 553\n\nAt about the age of eighteen, while he was alternating between the work-shop and the farm, his attention was especially directed to harvesting machinery.\n\nIn the year 1852, an exhibition of reaping and mowing machines was held, under the auspices of the State, on the farm of J. T. Warder, near Springfield, and all of the reaping and mowing machines then manufactured were represented. It maybe safely said that no one present at that exhibition, not even the inventors or manufacturers of the respective machines, took more interest in the exhibition than did Mr. Whiteley. Immediately thereafter, he began a series of experiments, which were continued through the years 1852, 1853 and 1854, during which time the different factors of the machine were conceived, machines made, placed in the field and tried, improvements made and further tested, and, in the year 1855, the first successful Champion machine was produced. The manufacture of the Champion machines for the trade was commenced by Mr. Whiteley in 1856, at which time he associated with Mr. Jerome Fassler, who, like Mr. Whiteley, was without capital, but he possessed great mechanical ability, and together they commenced, under the firm name of Whiteley & Fassler, the manufacture of the Champion machines with their own hands. The shop, or factory, first occupied by them, was a wooden structure 20x35 feet, consequently the first production of machines was on a very limited scale.\n\nThe manufacture and sales of the first season aggregated about twenty machines, which was increased each successive year. In the fall of 1857, Mr. O. S. Kelly, ,a skilled mechanic, with limited means, was associated with White ley & Fassler, under the firm name of Whiteley, Fassler & Kelly, which name has been maintained for nearly a quarter of a century, up to the present time.\n\nAs is usually the case in building up new enterprises, they met with many reverses and passed through many \"hard trials and tribulations.\" In fact, to depict the vicissitudes through which they passed while the business was in its infancy would be too great a task. However, not excessively elated with apparent success, or daunted by discouragements, but with unanimity of mind and determined to succeed, they overcame all obstacles, and the results arising from their perseverance will be readily noticed as we pass along, endeavoring to follow them, step by step, to the present time.\n\nIn the year 1860, the firm had overcome many of the obstacles encountered, and succeeded so far as to establish the reputation of the machine, and increase their business to that extent that greater facilities for manufacturing were im peratively necessary. Accordingly, the original establishment, together with adjacent rooms which had been temporarily leased, were abandoned for a part of their present location, a two-story brick building, 50x80 feet, which was equipped with machinery, and to which additions were made yearly, until their main building encompassed the extensive proportions of 400 feet in length by 52 feet -wide. A portion of the building is four stories; and the remainder three stories high, with wings attached, embracing foundry, blacksmith-shop and material rooms, all thoroughly equipped with machinery. But, notwithstanding the firm had increased their facilities yearly, they had been unable, up to this time, to supply the demand for machines, and having occupied all the available space that could be procured in that locality, and in order to make further provisions to supply the rapidly increasing demand for the Champion, in the fall of 1867 an arrangement was entered into with Warder, Mitchell & Co. to manufacture the Champion machines for a Northern district of territory. The lastnamed firm, having been for several years engaged in the manufacture of various reaping and mowing machines, embracing the Ketchum mower, Densmore selfraker, New York reaper. Ohio harvester, Buckeye., Marsh harvester, etc., had large shops, which were situated about one and a half miles from the city, at a\n\n554 - HISTORY OF CLARK COUNTY.\n\npoint called Lagonda, now a suburban village of Springfield, and in 1868 the firm of Warder, Mitchell & Co. first began the manufacture of the Champion machine, and abandoned the manufacture of all other machines previously manufactured by them. During each successive year, they have been compelled to greatly increase their facilities, until their manufactory is now one of the largest in the country. The capacity of their shops, warehouses, etc., has been more than doubled since they commenced the manufacture of the Champion machines.\n\nAbout the same time, during the fall of 1867, and in order to provide further facilities for supplying the prospective demand for the Champion machines, the Champion Machine Company was formed for the purpose of manufacturing machines for the Southern and Western States and Territories.\n\nThe company was organized and placed under the management of Amos Whiteley, its President (who had been for ten years prior connected with the firms of Whiteley & Fassler and Whiteley, Fassler & Kelly, as their principal business manager). Mr. Robert Johnson, the Secretary and Superintendent, is a skillful mechanic, who was formerly successfully engaged in the business of contracting and building in this city. His indomitable energy and perseverance eminently qualify him for the position he occupies. Mr. William W. Wilson, the Vice President, formerly resided at Cadiz, Ohio, where he was largely engaged in milling, mining, merchandising, etc., and was noted for his sound judgment, perseverance and sterling character.\n\nImmediately after the organization of the company, suitable grounds were purchased and buildings erected and equipped with first-class machinery. The buildings were the largest in the country at that time, but proved inadequate to the wants of the company. Hence, large additions were added, embracing one warehouse covering 65,000 square feet of floor space, erected for the purpose of storing machines to economize space in the manufactory; and an office building, 511x100 feet, with repair warehouse attached, the main part of the first floor of which is used for offices, and the second floor for sample rooms. printing rooms, etc"
