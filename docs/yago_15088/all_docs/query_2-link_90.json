        "text": "WARDER, Joseph The True Amazons: or, the monarchy of bees, being a new discovery and improvement of those wonderful creatures. John Pemberton etc. 1713.\n\n12mo. Twentieth century contemporary-style full speckled calf, inlaid brown calf panels to sides, spine with raised gilt bands and red morocco gilt label; pp. xii + [iv] + 160, frontispiece portrait of the author, text diagram of box hive to p.117; wormholes pp. 1-52, a little internal browning, occasional marginal notes, very good.\n\nSecond edition. First published in 1693, this book was well in advance of any former treatise and remained the standard work until Thorley's Melisselogia was published in 1744. Joseph Warder (fl. 1688 - 1718) was a physician in Croydon who devoted his time to the local independent congregation and to bees."
