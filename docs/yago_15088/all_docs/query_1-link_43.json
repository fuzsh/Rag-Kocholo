are not\n\ndetrimental and repetition only is avoided The last annual edition\n\nwhich was increased to two thousand volumes was not found beyond the\n\ndemand for the work and therefore this number was retained and it was\n\nnot thought expedient to return to the former small edition of five hun\n\ndred volumes\n\nThe changes made in circulars of the Department which was apparent\n\nthrough the yearthe introduction of an Inquiry Column the\n\nissuance of a report every month in the year containing matter of interest\n\nin relation to the farm dairy etc has we believe added largely to the\n\nvalue of the volume as a book of reference and information and we trust\n\nthat the contents of the volume are such as will merit its preservation by\n\nthose who receive it The proceedings of

Agriculture\n\nATLANTA GA\n\nThe Franklin Printing and Publishing Company\n\n1893SUGGESTIONS AND INFORMATION\n\nEY THE\n\nGeorgia Department of Agriculture\n\nMONTHLY TALK WITH THE FARMERS\n\nNOVEMBER\n\nDepartment of Agriculture\n\nAtlanta November 1 1892\n\nThe month of October on the whole has been most favorable for gath\n\nering the crops of corn and cotton and the farmers have shown great energy\n\nand care in placing the fleecy staple beyond the reach of injury from un\n\nfavorable weather\n\nThroughout the State the yield is the poorest in ten years Today the\n\nfields are almost bare nothing in the plants to mature In other words\n\nthe crop is gathered for this season and the results are most unsatisfactory\n\nThere has not been in years a season in which the absence of favorable\n\nclimate and soil conditions has been more conspicuously marked\n\nWhere the proper preparations were made in time and the soil had even\n\nin moderate quantities the requisite elements for plant growth and where\n\nenergy and sound judgment have characterized the planting and subse\n\nquent cultivation the yield is notwithstanding adverse seasons fairly\n\ngood But where there was late planting light manuring or no manuring\n\nat all and where the cultivation was slow and imperfect the yield is the\n\npoorest I have ever known\n\nThe experience of the past twentyfive years should convince every\n\nfarmer who was allured by the high prices of cotton directly after the war\n\ninto following the onecrop system that an agricultural people never\n\nmade a greater mistake than in staking their all on a single issue The\n\nmaking of these successive crops has cost not only vast sums of borrowed\n\nmoney but has consumed time and talent and energy and worn out a soil\n\nthat once possessed every element for producing in abundance all the\n\ncrops suited to our climate and section I have been forcibly indeed pain\n\nfully impressed the past season with the undeniable fact that most of our\n\nsurface soil is lost to us forever and even in more favored sections where\n\nthe lands are level the manifest decline in both plant growth and yield\n\nare so marked as to cause grave apprehension for the future success of our\n\nagricultureDEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTUREGEORGIA\n\nThis depleting wearing out system cannot continue indefinitely the end\n\nmust come ere many years roll around and then what are we to do We\n\nhave had all the teams and every farm appliance pulling everything down\n\nhill since the war we have nearly reached the bottom and what then\n\nCan you show me any section of the State where the farms have been made\n\nricher and more productive Of course there are individual exceptions\n\nand where you find these exceptions you generally find plenty of\n\nhome supplies and prosperity But as a rule the answer to this question\n\nmust be unfavorable The truth is our farms are growing poorer with each\n\nsucceeding crop We all realize that it is much easier to exhaust and tear\n\ndown than to reclaim and build up these old fields But they can be re\n\nclaimed and we owe it to ourselves to our children to set about the task\n\nIt is estimated that only about five per cent of those engaged in trade\n\never accumulate wealth quite a large number succeed in gaining a com\n\nfortable support but many in all occupations from various causes often\n\nfrom lack of energy or proper business qualifications fail of their object\n\nand these become the chronic grumblers and faultfinders in every com\n\nmunity and attribute to bad laws and unfavorable seasons the misfortunes\n\nand disappointments which have fallen to their lot\n\nThe successful farmer must be a man of energy and tact wideawake and\n\never ready to take on any information regarding his work He is not a\n\ngrumbler but bravely meets and grapples with every difficulty in his path\n\nto success He secures pleasure as well as independence from his chosen\n\noccupation He recognizes the fact that the limit of production in this\n\ncountry has never been reachedthat we are years behind the farmers of\n\nmany European countries These people from necessity their dense pop\n\nulation forcing them to the most extraordinary efforts to gain a livelihood\n\nhave learned to exercise the greatest care in saving every element of plant\n\nfood in concentrating their work in adopting the most advanced and in\n\ntelligent systems of farming They have learned theleseon which we are\n\njust beginning to studythat is how to reap the largest and most profitable\n\nyield from the smallest area These thoughtful busy workers are demon\n\nstrating that even under continuous cultivation lands can be worked at a\n\nprofit and at the same time kept up to a high degree of productiveness\n\nTo realize the utter absurdity and hopelessness of continuing to cultivate\n\nland in the same crop without rest or change one needs only to ride over\n\nthis State and examine the yield on those fields which have been devoted\n\nto cotton year after year To a thoughtful mind the sight is a most de\n\npressing one\n\nWe generally occupy the position which we make for ourselves and we\n\ncannot reasonably hope to fill a higher one The farmer who allows his\n\nlands to rundown year after and then expects to realize an independence\n\nfrom them is making the grand mistake of his life It is the man and not\n\nthe farm that determines its value It is true that there is a difference in\n\nlocation climate and nature of soil but there is a wider difference in the\n\nmen who use these conditions Professor Brewer well illustrates this idea\n\nby a case which came under his own observation A neighbor bought a\n\nfarm for 20 an acre He so improved it that in three years he was offeredSUGGESTIONS AND INFORMATIONNOVEMBER\n\n5\n\n300 an acre for it At his death it sold for 250 an acre In a few years\n\nthe purchaser sold it for 100 an acre to a man who finally disposed of it\n\nfor 12 an acre\n\nIn our favored climate nature holds out to us every encouragement Let\n\nus read and think for ourselves Let us emulate the example of our more\n\nprogressive and successful neighbor There is plenty of room at the top\n\nof the ladder only crowding and disappointment at the bottom Let us\n\nstruggle higher up where comfort and abundance await us\n\nR T Nesbitt Commissioner\n\nGENERAL REMARKS\n\nSince the October report was issued we have had plenty of sunshine and\n\nwarm weather for harvesting crops over nearly the entire State Farmers\n\nhave availed themselves of the fine opportunity and gathering has pro\n\ngressed rapidly In the southern portion of the State cotton picking is far\n\nadvanced and with a few more weeks of fine weather the entire crop will\n\nbe gathered In Middle Georgia cotton is nearly all opened and picked and\n\nin Northern Georgia much of the crop is out Corn gathering and the\n\nhousing of peas has continued rapidly through the fine weather and a\n\ngreat part of the work is completed\n\nCOTTON\n\nWhile the fine weather has been favorable to cotton picking yet the en\n\ntire absence of moisture has not been without its injurious effects With\n\noccasional showers the small top crop would have matured whereas by\n\nthe dry warm weather small bolls have been forced open prematurely\n\nThe lint from such bolls is very tight and in ginning goes largely to motes\n\nFrom a careful consideration of reports and personal observation of the con\n\ndition of the crop in a part of the State we feel safe in saying\n\nthat the crop for this year will not be more than sixtyfive per cent\n\nof that of last year These figures take into consideration not only the\n\nsmall yield per acre but also the reduction in acreage\n\nCORN\n\nThe corn crop of this year is the largest made in the State for a number\n\nof years While the crop of last year probably in the northern part of the\n\nState exceeded in the yield per acre yet considering the increased acreage\n\nand the yield in other portions of the State the department regards this as\n\nthe largest crop during the past decade\n\nGRAIN\n\nThe sowing of wheat and oats lias been retarded by the dry weather but\n\nwe trust that the farmers will put in larger crops of small grain than here\n\ntofore The fall is the proper time to begin to prepare for a decreased\n\nacreage in cotton and for bringing up land by diversified farming Let\n\nthose who have undertaken to renovate their lands and to make their\n\nfarms selfsustaining continue in their efforts in this the right direction\n\nThe advance made in the price of cotton leads to the hope of higher pricesDEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTUREGEORGIA\n\nbut let it be always remembered that if a better price is to be obtained that\n\nthe acreage must be reduced aud the size of the crop diminished Over\n\nproduction will always result in a depression of the market and living\n\nprices cannot be expected where a surplus remains on hand\n\nWORK OF THE DEPARTMENT\n\nPerhaps more than any other Department of State the Agricultural De\n\npartment has been confronted with opposition In many instances this\n\nopposition grows out of the fact that the work of the department is not\n\nthoroughly understood in other cases out of the idea that supported by\n\ntaxation the expenditures exceed the benefits conferred on the people It\n\nis true that a part of the fund that supports this department is derived\n\nfrom the general fund but such is only the case because a great part of the\n\nfees collected through the agency of the department go to the school fund\n\nIn the bieinial report of the department to the governor the gratifying\n\nresult was shown that the fees collected from inspections that came under\n\nthe supervision of the department were more than ample to meet every ex\n\npenditure for the entire department in all its branches with a balance in\n\nfavor of the State of over 3000 The season from which these figures were\n\ntaken was an unusually small one as regards the business done in com\n\nmercial fertilizers and it is a conservative estimate to place the amount that\n\nwill be usually derived above all expenditures at S10000 During 189192\n\nthe change in the law in regard to the fees of inspectors of oils was not in\n\nfull force and an increase from this source can be reasonably expected\n\nSUPERVISION OF INSPECTION\n\nTwo classes of inspection are under the direct control aud supervision of\n\nthe department and the benefits derived from these inspections perhaps\n\npresent the work of the department in its most tangible form The in\n\nspection and analysis of fertilizers we regard as of the most vital impor\n\ntance to the farmers for whose benefit the department was especially created\n\nThe history of the fertilizer business prior to the inspection system shows\n\nits immense benefits In the courts of nearly every country where ferti\n\nlizers were used were found cases where farmers deriving no benefit from\n\nthe goods purchased were contesting at a great disadvantage the worth of\n\nthe goods\n\nThe following from the report of the commissioner to the governor gives\n\nbriefly the law on the subject of fertilizer inspection with some other\n\nmatters of importance to the department\n\nTHE INSPECTION OF FERTILIZERS\n\nThe imperative necessity for laws governing the inspection of fertilizers\n\nhasbeen recognized by the legislative bodies of nearly all the States The first\n\nlaw passed on this subject in Georgia was in 1868 Being of an experi\n\nmental character it was inadequate to protest against various frauds that\n\nmight be sought to be perpetrated and so framed that the subsequent large\n\nbusiness that developed would have afforded immense revenue to the offi\n\ncials executing the law Under thislaw the inspector or party drawing the\n\nsample was at the same time the chemist making the analysis It was theSUGGESTIONS AND INFORMATIONNOVEMBER\n\nduty of these officers when requested to inspect fertilizers at any point\n\nwithin the State and to furnish certificates of such inspection It made it\n\nunlawful for any person to sell fertilizers without such certificate of inspec\n\ntion for making which the inspector received fifty cents a ton The act\n\ncreating this system provided for no general supervision of the work of the\n\ninspectors each being an independent officer in that section of the State\n\nin which he was located Xaturally therefore when the act of 1874 cre\n\nating the Dspartment of Agriculture was passed the head of this de\n\npartment was placed in charge of all inspections The use of fertilizers\n\nrapidly increasing the necessity for a change in the law became apparent\n\nand to meet this the act of 1877 was passed Could this law have been so\n\nexecuted as to have each shipment inspected the protection would have\n\nbeen ample but the consumption became so large that inspections in bulk\n\nwere made to facilitate business These inspections afforded no sufficient\n\nprotection as the goods remaining in the hands of the manufacturer after\n\nthe sample was drawn were subject to subsequent adulteration and manip\n\nulation in which event the analysis of the sample would not represent the\n\ngoods sold Recognizing this when I came into office I endeavored to avoid\n\nthis class of inspections by passing an order directing all inspections to be\n\nmade after the goods were sacked and ready for shipment With the force\n\nat the command of the department it was found impossible to make all in\n\nspections in this way and that inspections in bulk were unavoidable that\n\nthe business might be conducted without delay Realizing the insuffi\n\nciency of these inspections I presented a bill to to the last General As\n\nsembly which made a radical change in the system This bill became the\n\nlaw and does I believe furnish a perfect protection against any ordinary\n\neffort to place spurious goods on the market and renders any class of fraud\n\nalmost certain of detection Already under its operation honest errors\n\nmade by manufacturers in sacking goods have been discovered and the\n\nmistakes rectified to the advantage of the farmers\n\nThe provisions of the new law are such that the manufacturer or dealer\n\nwho sells goods b3low the State standard places himself in danger of ren\n\ndering void all transactions for the year and of having the State prohibit\n\nsubsequent sales The opportunities and chances for detection are so\n\ngreat that no dealer or manufacturer would risk the great loss entailed by\n\ndiscovery of illegitimate sales for the sake of the benefits that would be\n\nderived from fraudulent transactions That act totally abolishes all inspec\n\ntions in bulk and all inspections are made after the goods leave the hands\n\nof the manufacturer or dealer Briefly stated it provides that all manufact\n\nurers or dealers must register the guaranteed analysis of the brand of a fer\n\ntilizer they sell or propose to offer for sale This guarantee is placed on\n\nrecord in the office and is also branded on the sack that purchasers may\n\nascertain without difficulty the standard up to which the goods must come\n\nIn order to maintain a high standard the law also requires all ammoniated\n\ngoods to contain two per cent of ammonia with a total of eight per cent\n\nof available phosphoric acid and potash To give further protection and\n\nto better enable purchasers by name and without reference to the guarantee\n\nto know something of the goods purchased I passed an order under the8\n\nDEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTUREGEORGIA\n\npower conferred by the bill requiring all fertilizers offered for registration\n\ninspection or sale branded as either of the following Arximoniated Super\n\nphosphate Ammoniated Dissolved Bone Ammoniated Guano Guano\n\nFertilizer or in other words implying that the same is an ammoniated\n\nsuperphosphate The guaranteed analysis must claim that it contains not\n\nless than two per cent of ammonia actual or potential\n\nAfter registration the manufacturer or dealer may order as many tags as\n\nhe sees proper specifying upon what brand or brands they are to be used\n\nThese tags are now more properly speaking registration tags as they do\n\nnot signify that the fertilizer has been actually sampled but only that the\n\nconditions precedent to selling or offering for sale have been complied with\n\nWhen the sales are made it is the duty of the manufacturer to notify the\n\ndepartment of the number of tons the name of the consignee and where\n\nshipped A failure on the part of the manufacturers to comply with these\n\nconditions renders the sale absolutely void The inspectors are directed\n\nwhere to make inspections as each sale is recorded in the office They are\n\nalso sent out on general trips through the territory assigned them taking\n\nsamples wherever found and reporting to the department the name of the\n\nbrands with the guaranteed analysis found on the sack While samples\n\nare not taken from every shipment the fact that a large number aredrawn\n\nin every part of the State and the inability of the manufacturer to tell\n\nfrom what samples analysis will be made upon which depends his future\n\nbusiness in the State and his collections furnishes we believe a perfect\n\nsafeguard\n\nIn regard to the price of fertilizers in the State it is gratifying to report\n\nthat our farmers are able to purchase at as small cost as in any State in the\n\nUnion Our tonnage tax is so low as not to be considered in making the\n\nselling price which was not the case while the tax remained at fifty cents\n\nper ton While the tax is only ten cents per ton it will be seen by the\n\nreceipts from this source that a sufficient sum is raised to maintain the\n\nentire inspection system and without taxation protect our farmers from\n\nmany frauds and impositions Did the manufacturers add ten cents to\n\nevery ton of goods sold which they do not the farmer could well afford to\n\npay this small fee to insure him against adulterated and spurious goodsi\n\nand secure for him a service that would otherwise cost him from ten to\n\nfifteen dollars So firmly am I convinced of the necessity of a thorougli\n\nsystem of inspection that were it necessary to support it by general taxation\n\nI believe the State would be compensated by the amount saved from bur\n\ndensome litigation that would result did no such system exist However\n\nthe present tonnage tax has proven far better than any other method and\n\nsupporting itself adds several thousand dollars annually to the school fund\n\nof the State\n\nGLANDERS\n\nAs your Excellency is aware through the Executive Department and\n\ndirect to this department many complaints have been made by letter and\n\nin cases of alarm by telegram of glanders among stock in the State Our\n\nlaws make no provision for such cases and through your Excellency I\n\nwould respectfully call the attention of the General Assembly to the necesSUGGESTIONS AND INFORMATIONNOVEMBER\n\nsity of providing some means to suppress and prevent the spread of this\n\nloathsome disease without deeming it proper in this report to suggest the\n\nmethod When it has been within the power of the department without\n\ntoo great an expenditure cases have been investigated but with no power\n\nto act beyond the investigation and with no means at the command of the\n\ndepartment except what has been saved from the general fund appropriated\n\nto the department by economy in other directions I feel that the depart\n\nment is unequipped to handle the matter and to prevent the spread of the\n\ndisease now in its infancy and in case of an emergency to do what would\n\nbe necessary to prevent a disastrousdestruction of our stock So far a\n\nwillingness on the part of those who own diseased animals to destroy them\n\nfor the benefit of the community has been shown but should the owner\n\nof one affected animal conclude not to permit it to be killed it is difficult\n\nto say to what extent the disease might spread\n\nAt the last session of the General Assembly Mr Chappell from Laurens\n\ncounty introduced a bill providing for compensation when glandered stock\n\nwas killed but that measure did not meet with the approval of a majority\n\nof the house and failed to pass Competent veterinarian surgeons are of the\n\nopinion that nearly if not all the cases found in the State are brought in by\n\nTexas stock and maintaining tbis view a number of States have enacted\n\nquarantine regulations against such stock requiring its inspection The\n\nfact that this disease not only destroys stock but also endangers human\n\nlife to my mind furnishes sufficient argument why legislative action of\n\nsome character should be taken Again chronic cases of glanders may re\n\nmain in a community for months spreading many cases of the disease in\n\nits acute form without its source being discovered Such conditions evi\n\ndently demand an investigation by a surgeon who thoroughly understands\n\nhis work\n\nEXPERIMENT STATION\n\nIn many quarters complaints have been made against the station on the\n\nground that the expenditures were too great for the amount of good done\n\nThese complaints are generally based on the supposition that the fund that\n\nsupports the station is appropriated by the State when in fact it is derived\n\nfrom the general government and it does not appear to me reasonable\n\nthat any part of our people should wish not to receive or permit the\n\nfarmers to recpive the benefit from an appropriation made by the United\n\nStates As required by law the essential part of the work of the station\n\nhas been reproduced in the reports of this department That many of\n\nthese experiments are valuable there can be no doubt if the results of\n\nsystematic culture and fertilization of various characters are of any benefit\n\nto the farmer That many are unable to avail themselves of the benefit of\n\nthe experiment is doubtless true but the lessons taught remain the same\n\nToe Commissioner of Agriculture is exofficio chairman of the Board of\n\nDirectors of the station The board which is appointed by your excel\n\nlency is made up of successful farmers from each congressional district in\n\nthe State The efforts of these gentlemen have been to make the station\n\nbeneficial to every class of farmers and to illustrate to our farmers what\n\ncan be done in certain branches of agriculture As the head of the departIO DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTUREGEORGIA\n\nmerit my voice in the affairs of the station is only imperative in case of a\n\ndisagreement resulting iu a tie between the other directors but the present\n\npolicy of conducting the station has been agreed upon after general con\n\nsultation among the directors The establishment of a dairy and the\n\nexperiments in tobacco I especially advocated as tending to show the\n\ncapabilities of Georgia outside of our previous agricultural policy The\n\nline now being pursued will I believe result in great benefit and I hope\n\nour farmers will endeavor to profit by the experience of the farm estab\n\nlished for their benefit\n\nA word in this report as to the way in which the station was established\n\nmay not be amiss The land was donated by the people of Spalding\n\ncounty and the State has appropriated 315000 expended principally for\n\nimprovements of a permanent character as the government permits only\n\na small portion of its annual appropriation to be used for that purpose\n\nThe ten thousand dollars came out of the fees arising from the inspection\n\nof fertilizers and so was no addition to the general tax The station is\n\noperated and maintained by 815000 annually set aside by congress for that\n\npurpose\n\nINSPECTION OF OILS\n\nThe change in the law in regird to the fees of oil inspectors furnishes a\n\nsource of revenue from these inspections The object of the law is to pre\n\nvent the sale of oil and other explosive substances of so low a grade that\n\nlife and property would be endaugered In addition to this the depart\n\nment has been able to secure oil of a better burning quality where poor oil\n\nhas been shipped into the State\n\nSEED\n\nThe object and aim of the department in sending out seed is not as some\n\nsuppose simply to furnish seed for ordinary farm and garden purposes\n\nbut to encourage the use of well selected seed test the value of differ\n\nent varieties direct the attention of the farmers to other branches of agri\n\nculture so that whether certain crops can be grown profitably can be\n\nascertained and to introduce seed that have been tested and found of\n\nsuperior value\n\nLITERATURE\n\nThe reports sent out by the department are to give the farmers informa\n\ntion not only oil the condition of the crops and the prospective yield but\n\nalso such information as will be useful on the farm the department\n\nendeavors to make these reports timely and we would be glad to receive\n\nfrom farmers succinct reports of experiments or unusual results obtained\n\nby certain methods of cultivation\n\nAt any and all times the department is willing to give any information at\n\nits command or communicate with the department at Washington when\n\nnecessary to ascertain auy mitter about which there may be an inquiry\n\nIt is our desire to make the department beneficial to the farmers outside\n\nof the supervisions of inspections and by every means at our command\n\nto advance practical agriculture In this work we ask the cooperation\n\nand support of the farmers of the StateSUGGESTIONS AND INFORMATIONNOVEMBER I I\n\nCHEESEMAKING IN GEORGIA\n\nBY HON R T NESBITT COMMISSIONER OF AGRICULTURE OF GEORGIA\n\nFrom the Southern Cultivator\n\nOn a recent visit to Griffin while attending the meeting of the Board of\n\nDirectors of the Experiment Station I was very much interested in exam\n\nining into the details of the cheesemaking experiment now being tried\n\nthere This industry has never been thoroughly tested in Georgia In\n\ndeed it has been supposed heretofore that the difficulties climatic and\n\notherwise here surrounding successful and profitable cheesemaking were\n\ntoo numerous to be easily overcome But a careful review of these diffi\n\nculties and a somewhat extended study of the farm experiment has con\n\nvinced me that the beginning of this industry will open another source of\n\nincome to our farmers and its benefits will be felt not only in the actual\n\ncash it may bring in but in the improvement of our stock and lands as\n\nwell The establishment of cheese factories and creameries in every\n\nneighborhood where they can be supported means a steady and reliable\n\nmarket for milk much of which is now wasted It also means more and\n\nbetter stock and in the natural consequence of farm economy there fol\n\nlows more green crops more and better home manure and crowning\n\nadvantage of all improved and improving lands\n\nThe arrangements for a cheese factory unlike some other of the smaller in\n\ndustries do not require any considerable outlay of capital and while neat\n\nness and care are essential the conditions are such that cheese of excellent\n\nquality can be successfully made at far less risk than where the milk is sent\n\nany distance to market or where butter is the product In the first case\n\nthat is where the milk is marketed at any distance there is the danger of\n\nsouring particularly in midsummer In the second that is where the\n\nproduct is to be butter the variations of the cream as to quality and quan\n\ntity owing sometimes to weather conditions or other circumstances\n\nequally beyond control often cause disappointment In keeping cows for\n\ncheesemaking the factory being established the farmer sells milk at so\n\nmuch the pound which is returned to him either in money or cheese The\n\nprice is fixed the market is at his door his only care is to produce the\n\nmilk in sufficient quantities to pay him for the outlay This being done\n\nhe has not only added to his income but has another wholesome and nu\n\ntritious item among his family supplies In almost every thickly settled\n\nneighborhood one of these factories might be started on the cooperative\n\nplan several farmers combining and one of their number thoroughly\n\nposting himself in all the necessary details of the work At the experi\n\nment station the factory is in daily operation and any one wishing in\n\nstruction will be welcomed and given every facility for learning the\n\nbusiness There is nothing complicated in the process and any man or\n\nwoman of ordinary intelligence can in thirty days learn everything\n\nnecessary for carrying on the work To give some idea of the requirements\n\nI quote from some note3 which were kindly furnished me by Captain\n\nRedding the director in response to some questions which I had asked\n\nI also give his letter bearing directly upon this subject12\n\nDEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTUREGEORGIA\n\nExperiment Ga August 27 1892\n\nlion R T Nesbitt Commissioner of Agricultvre Atlanta On\n\nMy Dear SirIn response to yours of the 25th I enclose Notes

cents\n\nper poundthe whole cheese Wherever it has been tested it has given\n\nsatisfaction Mr Wing says that the conditions here in Georgia for cheese\n\nmaking are more favorable than in Ohio where he has been making cheese\n\nall his life Very truly R J Redding Director\n\nNOTES ON CHEESEMAKING IN GEORGIA\n\n1 Character and cost of building\n\nAny cheap outbuilding or mere shed will answer all purposes for mak\n\ning cheese It is only necessary to be dry and comfortable for the operator\n\nBut the curing room should be tight and close yet capable of ventilation\n\nA good 8x10 pantry or storeroom such as may be found in most well\n\nbuilt farm houses would answer\n\n2 Fixtures machinery etc\n\nA cheese vat consisting of a wooden box lined with tin with a small\n\nfurnace underneath a press with one or more sqrews similar to a cider\n\npress screw a few tin cheese hoops of different sizes curd knives strainers\n\ndipper and a thermometer The entire outfit for a dairy of twentyfive\n\ncows will cost less than 100\n\n3 The process of cheesemaking is briefly as follows\n\nThe nights milk is kept in a cool place until morning when it is mixed\n\nwith the mornings milk and all poured into the cheese vat and beated\n\nup to a temperature of eightyfour degrees A small quantity of prepared\n\nrennet rennetine is then added and the milk is constantly but gently\n\nstirred to prevent the cream from rising until it commences to thicken\n\nIn about forty minutes the milk will become solid it curdles you would\n\ncall it clabber or sweet curds When the curd has become pretty firm it\n\nis cut into small cubesabout the size and shape of diceby means of the\n\ncurd knives which is done in a few moments The heat is then increased\n\nuntil the curds show a temperature of ninetysix to ninetyeight degrees\n\nby the thermometer This heating is to cause tu pieces of curd to con\n\ntract thereby expelling the whey The whey is then drained away and\n\nis used to feed pigs young calves etc being fattening food\n\nThe curd is now salted at the rate of onehalf ounce of salt to the pound\n\nof curd and the latter is enclosed in a press cloth and put into the cheese\n\nhoop and pressed until the whey is all expelled which will be in about\n\ntwenty minutes The cheese is now removed from the press hoop the\n\npress cloth removed and the permanent cloth bandage put on and\n\nthen returned to the hoops and press where it is pressed with the full force\n\nof the press and screw and a threefoot leverthe firmer the better\n\nThe cheese usually remains in the press until next day or say eighteen\n\nhours when it is marked with date of making and placed on a shelf in\n\nthe curing room to be turned over every day and rubbed with the handSUGGESTIONS AND INFORMATIONNOVEMBER\n\n13\n\nThe curing room should be kept at about the temperature of seventy or\n\nseventyfive degrees by opening wiudows and doors at night and closing\n\nup during the day\n\nThe cheese will be ready for use in from three weeks to several months\n\nas may be determined by the maker during the process of making\n\n4 In the south the months of March April May June August Sep\n\ntember and October are the best cheesemaking months but cheese may\n\nbe made at any season Usually cheese is made in spring summer and\n\nfall and butter in winter beeause buttermaking requires a cool tempera\n\nture which cannot be secured in summer without the aid of ice which is\n\ntoo expensive and inconvenient\n\n5 How to dispose of milk when not made into cheese\n\nIt is generally more profitable to sell milk than either butter or cheese\n\nbut milk will keep only a few hours and cannot be sent long distances\n\nTherefore the milk market is easily glutted Buttermaking is the better\n\nway unless a large number of cows are kept and the local market not re\n\nliable for milk Generally cheesemaking will be found more profitable\n\nthan either when operating with a good sized herd\n\n6 In Georgia nine and onehalf pounds of milk are required to make\n\none pound of cured cheese\n\n7 As before stated the curds may be manipulated so as to make a long\n\nkeeping or short keeping cheesesay from three to four weeks to six\n\nmonths may intervene between making and marketing according to the\n\nwill of the maker\n\nWhen a cheese becomes ripe or ready for eating and it is desired to\n\nhold it for a better market it must be kept in a cool roomin summer\n\ntime in cold storage\n\nAt the last meeting of the Board of Directors of the Experiment Station\n\nit was determined that at the State fair to be held in Macon in the coming\n\nOctober the station cheese factory shall be in daily operation Many per\n\nsons who could not otherwise have an opportunity of witnessing the prac\n\ntical working of such a factory can there study every item of labor\n\nexperience etc The field is open to any enterprising person and I trust\n\nsuch will take hold and make it remunerative to themselves and to the\n\nfarmers Every enterprise which opens new avenues of work and fur\n\nnishes fresh sources of iDcome is a blessing and we need all the

as we take a retrospective\n\nview of our labors our successes and our defeats for this year we find much\n\nfood for earnest thought It is our duty to consider and weigh well the\n\ngrave responsibilities which surround us and in making our arrangements\n\nfor another year to ask ourselves if our efforts have been conducted on the\n\nright lines Have we conducted our farms on common sense business\n\nprinciples Have we managed in such a way as not only to reap the\n\nlargest yield from the smallest area at the lowest cost but have we realized\n\nthe full benefits of this result In planting our various crops did we con\n\nsult the ever important condition of supply and demand and in dispos\n\ning of them did we exercise the business acumen which enabled us to\n\nmarket them to the best advantage Is it not too much our habit in the\n\nhurry and often perplexity of arranging our business at the beginning of\n\neach year to overlook these important questions In our anxiety we are\n\nliable to forget that the farmers obligations are not confined to the narrow\n\ncircle of his own farm and home but on each one rests in part the duty\n\nof feeding and clothing the world A failure in this can but bring disap\n\npointment and suffering to the busy toilers in other occupations and trades\n\nand also those who while helping us are not producers whose daily wants\n\nhave to be supplied It is to the farmers that these teeming millions turn\n\nnot only for their meat and bread but for the clothes which they wear\n\nand the farmers alone can produce them This is their supreme right and\n\nthus to them belongs the lever which moves the world Do we realize the\n\nmagnitude of the undertaking Is is not our duty not only to supply our\n\nneeds but to meet this demand which the world makes upon us and are\n\nwe pursuing a system which will accomplish this work To understand\n\nthis question more thoroughly let us go back thirty years At that time\n\nthere were fields in every section of our State that without fertilizer\n\nyielded large returns With ordinary preparation and fair cultivation we\n\nreaped abundant crops of our staple productions We had wide expanses\n\nof woodland pastures which furnished our meat at an almost nominal cost\n\nand a contented thoroughly controlled labor system Prosperity and con\n\ntentment smiled on every side Then came the devastations of war and\n\nan entire change in our system of labor After this from necessity often\n\nbut as truly from mistaken farm methods the tenant and renting system\n\nbegan and also the pernicious and false and I should say easy and elastic\n\nplan of securing advances to the full and often more than full value of the\n\ncrops under cultivation These mistakes have tended to bring about a\n\nspeculative system of farming The ease with which credit could be ob\n\ntained on cotton and the impossibility of securing it on any other crop and\n\nthe cheapness of our lands have influenced many farmers to produce a\n\nmoney crop or rather what they hoped would be a money crop to the ex\n\nclusion of those food crops s absolutely essential to the success comfori6\n\nDEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTUREGEORGIA\n\nand I may say perpetuity of our calling Granted that this system is\n\nhe result of our losses from a most destructive war and the wiping out of\n\nold established customs it is equally true that it has established temporary\n\nmethods which have well nigh bankrupted us\n\nTime has effectually demonstrated the folly of continuing an agricultural\n\npolicy which has brought us only disappointment and defeat in the past\n\nand yet in some cases from apathy in others from a spirit born of despair\n\nwe see our farmers plunging each year deeper and deeper into the whirl\n\npool of ruini Seeking and gaining the consent of their patient and hopeful\n\ncreditors they brace themselves for their new work and by increasing cot\n\nton their only money crop vainly hope to retrieve their failing fortunes\n\nThis new work is only new as far as the season is concerned It is a new\n\nyear but it is the same old methods the same old hopes the same old\n\nefforts to produce a cotton crop on credit to pay old debts\n\nNo mathematical proposition was ever more easily demonstrated than\n\nthis that a farmer cannot purchase supplies on time to make cotton at\n\npresent prices In nine cases out of ten the losses are so great that he finds\n\nhis obligations have been increased rather than diminished by the honest\n\nout mistaken efforts he has made to release himself from the relentless\n\ngrasp of debt Let us resolve on different methods Ours is an honorable\n\ncalling and farming is just as much a business as selling goods or mining\n\nores and requires far more study and preparation Let no man think that\n\nhe can successfully embark in it without some previous preparation or\n\nknowledge of eveu its simplest duties To the man who farms because he\n\nloves it and not simply because he can gain a hard living by it who studies\n\nbusiness as well as the most enlightened agricultural methods who applies\n\nthe knowledge gained from the brain work researches of others as well as\n\nthat gleaned from his own observation and experience who uses brain\n\nforce as well as physical strenthto this man nature opens her storehouse\n\nand pours out her rich treasures In studying her laws we shall realize that\n\neach year we owe a duty to our land as well as to our families and ourselves\n\nWe shall And that we cannot continue indefinitely to draw plant food from\n\nthe soil and expect that soil to remain in fruitful condition Taking even\n\na small quantity each year wears out and depletes and while this depletion\n\nmay not be noticeable at the start a gradual reduction both in the plant\n\ngrowth and yield of fruit must take place and each succeeding year marks\n\na larger decrease in the productive power of the land Let us illustrate\n\nWhen a cotton planter puts his usual 200 pounds of fertilizer to the acre he\n\nhas among other elements put in four pounds of ammonia and when he\n\nrealizes his usual acreage of onethird of a bale to the acre he has removed\n\nfrom the soil in the seed alone twelve pounds of ammonia In other words\n\nhe each year takes off in the seed alone eight pounds more of ammonia\n\nthan he supplies and the land has to make up the deficit Could there be\n\nstronger argument against our present methods Our fathers with a per\n\nfect system of labor trained and disciplined pushed the exhausting pro\n\ncess to such a degree and the consequences of our following this destructive\n\npolicy are so serious that today we find ourselves confronted by conditiors\n\nwhich we must meet and conquer or own ourselves defeated These unSUGGESTIONS AND INFORMATIONDECEMBER\n\n17\n\nsatisfactory methods do not meet the demands of our more enlightened\n\nage They are wrong from any standpoint and with hired labor they are\n\nabsolutely ruinous\n\nIf we are in debt is it possible for us to lessen that debt by taking on us\n\nobligations to make a cotton crop which as I have already stated costs\n\nunder our present methods more than it will bring in the markets Let us\n\nstudy this question thoroughly consider our surroundings examine care\n\nfully the condition and requirements of our lands count the cost and then\n\napply ourselves diligently to the task of ascertaining which methods which\n\ncrops will pay the largest dividends Having determined these let us use\n\nour best judgment and energy to produce the best results Select some\n\ngood agricultural publication nothing better than The Southern Cultivator\n\nand its contemporary The Southern farm both published in Atlanta\n\nand as you sit around your firesides these long winter nights read and\n\nstudy the results which are being obtained in every section by live and\n\nwideawake farmers The day with us is passed when we can do superficial\n\nwork because the elements once so abundantly supplied by our soil are\n\nfrom unwise and careless management greatly exhausted Any one with\n\nordinary intelligence and energy can on rich land dig a support from the\n\nsoil Only intelligent and properly directed skill can wrest success from\n\nour changed condition But here science comes to our aid points out the\n\ntrouble and suggests the remedy and common sense tells us that we\n\nhave the conditions for success in our grasp if we will only control them\n\nScience says there are certain elements necessary to the growth of your\n\ncrops supply these in greater quantities than your crops require and you\n\nkeep up the fertility of your lands Common sense says you have a mo\n\nnopoly on a crop which is absolutely necessary to the world keep it in\n\nproper bounds and your independence is secured Build up a small acreage\n\neach year by a careful system of rotation green crops and manuring\n\nTake a few acres and every spare moment haul out the scrapings from lot\n\nstable and fence corners also from rich spots in your woods Now and\n\nduring the winter months is the time for this work It has been demon\n\nstrated that stable manure spread on the land and allowed to remain during\n\nthe winter has produced seventy bushels of corn per acre The same\n\nquantity plowed under in the spring the same season yielded only fifty\n\nbushels per acre Purchase your acid cotton seed meal and potash now\n\nand during the bad weather mix these ingredients on a tight floor in the\n\nproportion of 600 pounds meal 1200 pounds acid and 200 pounds German\n\nkainit You will save from 4 to 5 per ton have a first class fertilizer and\n\nknow just exactly what you are using Or you can take acid cotton seed\n\nmeal and stable manure in the following proportions and have a fertilizer\n\nequal if not superior to any on the market Acid 650 pounds stable ma\n\nnure 675 pounds cotton seed meal 225 pounds or green cotton seed 675\n\npounds When land is deficient in potash add 200 pounds of kainit In\n\nthis formula deduct 75 pounds each green cotton seed and stable manure\n\nand 50 pounds of superphosphate\n\nAgain let me warn you not to be led into the mistake of raising too much\n\ncotton Dont be tempted to leave the only true plan to success that isDEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE GEORGIA\n\nplenty of food supplies and then all the cotton you can cultivate without\n\nhaving to borrow more than it is worth to make it\n\nThe present condition of the cotton market is sufficient proof of the un\n\nalterable laws of supply and demand The theory that we cannot pro\n\nduce too much cotton is entirely exploded by the experiences of 1891 and\n\n1892 In 1891 we produced the biggest crop on record and the price fell\n\nfar below the cost of production and many farmers more especially those\n\nwho bought their provisions are yet struggling to pay off the obligations\n\nincurred in making that crop In 1892 by reason of reduced acreage and\n\nunpropitious seasons the yield has fallen below the average and now that\n\nthis fact is established beyond controversy we see the price bounding up\n\nin spite of speculative effort to depress it and notwithstanding the fact\n\nthat we have no more money in circulation than we had one year ago when\n\nthere was a popular theory that scarcity of money and underconsumption\n\nand not overproduction depressed the market and was the cause of the\n\ndisastrous low price\n\nHad the majority of farmers by pursuing a sound agricultural policy\n\nbeen able to hold this years crop that is the crop of 1892 they would now\n\nbe reaping the golden harvest over which the speculators are rejoicing It\n\nis true there are farmers who by raising an abundance of provisions reduc\n\ning the cotton area and by careful methods increasing the yield while\n\nlessening the cost are today reaping the benefit from their wise fore\n\nthought But unfortunately they are the exception The bulk of the\n\ncotton has gone out of the hands of the farmers and they are compelled to\n\nsee their crop the result of much anxious thought and weary toil enrich\n\ning others instead of themselves Let me urge you in planting your crops\n\nfor 1893 to remember that when we glut the markets of the world we have\n\nto accept such prices as the buyer sees fit to give but when we have our\n\nsupplies and a cotton crop just sufficient to meet the demands of trade\n\nwe can to a certain extent dictate the price Dont allow yourselves to\n\nbe allured into false methods by the present high price of cotton\n\nThis will be my last talk with the farmers before the opening of a new\n\nyear May they realize the grave responsibilities which it brings and by\n\na wise and careful policy use its opportunities to their own best advantage\n\nR T Nesbitt Commissioner\n\nGENERAL REMARKS\n\nAs this report will be the last issued from the department for the year\n\n1892 we desire to thank the correspondents of the department who have\n\nrendered us such valuable aid in their preparations We are glad to note\n\nthat the estimates made from the reports sent during the growth and\n\ngathering of the crop are proving substantially correct while we regret that\n\nin some instances they are not so gratifying as we would wish The large\n\nincrease made in the number of reporters has rendered the result from the\n\ncompiled figures much more certain as inequalities in the crop in different\n\nlocalities of the same section were more accurately ascertainedSUGGESTIONS AND INFORMATIONDECEMBER\n\n19\n\nCOTTON\n\nIn regard to this crop the present indications and reports are that it will\n\nbe under rather than above previous estimates of the department\n\nWhile in nearly every quarter the crop of 1891 for the State has been\n\nplaced at 110000 bales the department from the best information at its\n\ncommand has never regarded it as in excess of 1000000 bales and of the\n\ntwo great crops the actual production in 1890 as the greater Taking there\n\nfore 1000000 bales as the yield for last year 60 per cent or 650000 bales or\n\nnear that number will be the crop for this year These figures were given\n\nin the November report since issuing which reports have been received\n\nwhich might justify a reduction in the estimate and which assures us that\n\nthe yield will certainly not exceed the amount given\n\nPICKING\n\nThe gathering of the crop in nearly every part of the State has been com\n\npleted and the quantity remaining in the fields is hardly worthy of com\n\nputation While the crop was late the total absence of a top crop concen\n\ntrated the picking within a short time and gathering was finished at an\n\nearlier date than usual\n\nMARKETING\n\nAs soon as ginned and packed cotton has been carried to the markets\n\nand a much larger per cent of the crop has been sold up to this time than\n\nfor several years\n\nPLANT LESS\n\nLet every farmer remember what we have so often said on the reduction\n\nof the cotton acreage and plant less in the year 1893 than in 1892 with\n\nmore grain and forage crops\n\nCORN\n\nThe total yield of corn in the State exceeds that of last year The aver\n\nage yield is not great especially in North Georgia but the loss in this re\n\nspect is more than compensated by the increased acreage We hope to see\n\na large increase this year and for succeeding years until our farmers are\n\nfrom the production of this crop independent of the grain fields of the West\n\nSMALL GRAIN\n\nThe season for sowing full crops of small grain has not been so propitious\n\nas we might desire but we trust that our farmers have not been deterred\n\nfrom increasing the acreage in their crop In those portions of the state\n\nadapted to wheat culture we would urge upon our farmers to study the\n\nbest methods of fertilizing and culivating until all failures in this crop will\n\nbe entirely due to the seasons and not improper methods\n\nFARM VALUES\n\nGovernor Northen in his last inaugural address gave the figures showing\n\nthe large increase in the taxable value of the property of the State during the\n\npast decade These figures were gratifying to all who have the interest of\n\nthe State at heart but their effect was marred by the fact that nearly theDEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTUREGEORGIA\n\nentire increase was urban and the percentage of increase in the value of\n\nfarm lands was very small The figures are particularly striking when we\n\nconsider that our State is classed as agricultural aud that upon the farm a\n\nmajority of our peeple depend for their livelihood and our State for its\n\nfinancial and commercial standing In arriving at the causes that have\n\nled to these results let us consider upon what the value of our farm lands\n\ndepends The land itself does not constitute the farmers wealth but the\n\nconstituents of the soil are his capital If these constituents serve for the\n\nnutrition of plants his land is productive and valuable otherwise it yields\n\nbut little and is of small value\n\nOutside of the productive features as the basis of the value of our lands\n\nother things are to be considered as forming a part of the valuation For\n\nhowever valuable the products if the cost of making approximates or\n\nexceeds its worth there being little or no net earning from the soil its\n\nvalue will not be enhanced by reason of its productiveness\n\nThe three great questions therefore to be considered by the practical and\n\ntheoretical agriculturalist arehow to increase the productiveness of the\n\nsoil how to reduce the cost of making and how to obtain the highest price\n\nin the market\n\nRational agriculture says a writer in contradistinction to the spolia\n\ntive system of farming is based upon the principles of restitution\n\nThe farmer each year with the gathered crop takes from the soil a part\n\nof its actual value This must be restored or to that extent his capital is\n\nimpaired and like the man living beyond the interest on his money con\n\nsumes each year a portion of his principalthus impoverishing himself event\n\nually The rotation of crops as a method of restitution has been repeat\n\nedly considered in these reports When the crops are removed from the\n\nsoil it should be remembered that no rotation will restore land and that\n\nall crops exhaust to some extent certainly as to their own reproduction\n\nThe physical and chemical condition of the soil may be improved and\n\nexisting nutritious matter converted into an available form compensat\n\ning for exhaustion but no permanent improvement is accomplished On\n\nthe other hand if the crop is allowed to remain on the land extracting as\n\nit has certain manurial values from the atmosphere or its product in barn\n\nmanure is returned to the fieldthe soil will increase in productiveness In\n\nany elaborate consideration of the compensation of the soil for removed\n\ncrops it would be necessary to deal with each crop separately and to go\n\ninto the results obtained by scientific investigation is a work too compre\n\nhensive to find space in these reports\n\nA study of these matters are however of vital importance not only\n\nwhere it is sought to restore land after a certain crop but also as indicating\n\nthe class of fertiliser essential to the production of that crop We would\n\nnot be understood as in any way detracting from the merits of rotation but\n\nsimply as suggesting that in studying methods of restoring land or of hold\n\ning them to their present standard not only should such crops be planted\n\nand rotation adopted as will result in the least exhaustion but the plant\n\nnutrition of the crop as often as possible should be returned to the soilSUGGESTIONS AND INFORMATIONDECEMBER\n\n21\n\nThis may in a great degree be accomplished and yet the crop utilized as\n\nfood for farm animals Commercial fertilizer while we approve their use\n\nat the proper time and in the proper place have too often led to a total aban\n\ndonment of the manure pile and farmers have grown lax in returning to\n\nthe soil plant food of which a little care need only be taken to prevent\n\nspoliation of their land and which may be used to renovate and restore it\n\nCare should be taken in saving barnyard manureotherwise it will loose\n\nmuch of its valuable and most soluble nutritious property by evaportion\n\nwasting etc Our open farmyards too often lead to injudicious manage\n\nment of manure where effort is made to husband their resources\n\nand spread over a large area without timely saving our manures loose half\n\nof their fertilizing value In asking our farmers in preparing and fertiliz\n\ning their lands for a crop to consider not only the yield for the year but a\n\npermanent increase in the productiveness of the soil we would emphasize\n\nthe necessity of rotation as improving the physical and chemical condition\n\nof the soil and compensating for exhaustion which attends reproductions\n\nand enjoin the necessity of not permitting anything of manurial value\n\non the farm to waste Do this and with judicious use of chemical fertilizer\n\nmaterial the value of our farm lands will increase\n\nKEDUCE THE COST OF MAKING\n\nIn rendering our lands productive and increasing the yield per acre we\n\nhave done much towards reducing the cost of making as approximately\n\nthe same amount of labor is involved in cultivation where the yield is\n\nsmall as where the yield is large In addition to this the use of labor sav\n\ning implements should be studied and adopted where they can be a sav\n\ning in this direction Here it would not be out of place to say that fine\n\neconomy can be shown on the farm by a proper care of tools harness etc\n\nSTUDY THE MARKET\n\nOf all questions intimately related to profit on the farm the southern\n\nplanter has perhaps paid less attention to a study of the markets than any\n\nother\n\nThis results from the fact that our principal crop is one that has always\n\nfound a ready sale for cash It is the duty of the farmer to study the\n\nwants of the town city or village near which he has located facilities for\n\nshipping to the large marts of commerce and their demand for various\n\nfarm products By doing this he will frequently find side crops which he\n\nmay profitably cultivate and for which he may be able to get cash when\n\nit is much needed\n\nThe diversification that would result would not only be of immense\n\nbenefit in restoring worn land but would aid at arriving at what should be\n\nthe aim of the farmer of the cotton States a reduction of the acreage in\n\ncotton and that crop as a surplus It may be said by some that now that\n\nthe cotton market has gone up it is useless to further urge this upon the\n\nfarmer\n\nTHE NECESSITY OF A SMALL ACREAGE\n\nTo this we need only reply that the same error will again result in the\n\nsame disaster and that living prices can only be obtained by a reduction22\n\nDEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTUREGEORGIA\n\nin the amount made The journey began in the right direction we should\n\nnot turn back allured by the hope of temporary profit when experience\n\nhas demonstrated that it can bring only ruin We wish it was in our power\n\nto convincingly impress on the mind of every farmer if we of the South\n\nwould prosper we must make our farms selfsustaining utilize everything\n\nof value at our command to renovate our waste land and reducing the\n\nacreage in cotton plant it only as an independent mouey crop In con\n\nclusion we reiterate let your doctrine be one of restitution not spoliation\n\nmore grain grass and fruits and less cotton\n\nONE OR TWO PLAIN TRUTHS\n\nBY HON E T NESBITT COMMISSIONER OF AGRICULTURE OF GEORGIA\n\nFrom the November Southern Cultivator\n\nI know what I am about to say will not at first be pleasant or perhaps\n\nacceptable to the majority of farmers but when thinking men analyze\n\nthese plain truths they will pardon their first disagreeable impression for\n\nthe sake of the kernel of good that lies in them I do not claim originality\n\nin presenting them they have been repeated hundreds of times and the\n\nprinciples underlying them are as old as the hills themselves but the\n\nurgency of our present needs demands that they should be impressed again\n\nand again upon the minds of our farmers\n\nFarming all things considered is the best business on earth and the\n\nsafest where the farmer gives the same attention to his work that the\n\ndoctor the lawyer the merchant bestows on his but under our present\n\nmanagement it is actually cheaper for a farmer to buy cotton than it is for\n\nhim to raise it And this is the crop on which we expend all our energies\n\nall our means and on which we depend for our income\n\nTo the owner of land this condition is deplorable but to the farmer who\n\nrents land and borrows money or provisions to make cotton it is ruinous\n\nWhen we examine into the causes which have lead to this distressing and\n\nalmost general agricultural condition we find among other mistakes two\n\nof greatest prominence The first is that we have depended too much on\n\ncommon fertilizers and too little on green crops and home manures The\n\nhistory of agriculture throughout the world shows that in those countries\n\nwhere commercial fertilizers are relied on exclusively or even mainly to\n\nproduce crops poverty and want have resulted while in countries where\n\nit is used in conjunction with thorough preparation of the land that is a\n\npreparation which puts the land in condition to utilize the fertilizer pros\n\nperity and riches even have blessed the farmers intelligent efforts\n\nIt is beyond contradiction that a man cannot permanently enrich his\n\nland with guanos alone They produce an artificial stimulus but they do\n\nnot build it up This building up must be done by green crops and by\n\ncompost applied broadcast over the land The common practice of run\n\nning a furrow drilling in a little commercial fertilizer covering and plant\n\ning on that is positively no benefit to the land and often proves of littleSUGGESTIONS AND INFORMATIONDECEMBER 23\n\nbenefit to the crop And this is not from any fault of the guano the failure\n\nmost frequently comes from our mistaken manner of using it A most\n\nimportant lesson which we have got to learn is that we cannot afford to\n\nuse expensive fertilizers unless by means of these renovating crops and\n\ndeep plowing we put our lands in condition to appropriate to the best\n\nadvantage that large proportion of these fertilizers which is now wasted\n\nOur lands once brought to this condition we need not fear to fertilize\n\nheavily The renovating process is slow and tedious but until we nerve\n\nourselves to this task all undertake it earnestly and systematically we\n\ncannot hope for agricultural prosperity\n\nThis process of renovation is also costly but it is not more so than the\n\npresent plan of planting large areas hastily prepared and imperfectly cul\n\ntivated And in the end the building up plan is far more certain far\n\nmore remunerative\n\nJust here is suggested to our minds the second grave error that is plant\n\ning large areas in the uncertain slipshod manner which has charac\n\nterized our methods for many years in other words undertaking to plant\n\nmore land than we can thoroughly manage There are thousands of acres\n\nthroughout the State which do not begin to pay for the cost of cultivation\n\nLeave these to the kindly offices of Mother Nature select only your best\n\nland and apply there all the energy all the manure which has heretofore\n\nbeen too much diluted by the spreading process\n\nWhat we need is concentration If our last seasons 9000000 bales had\n\nbeen made on half the land which was used to make that crop and the\n\nother half had been applied to improved methods of raising corn wheat\n\noats grass and stock how many millions of money that escaped through\n\nour fingers would have been retained at home and be now adding to our\n\nprosperity\n\nThe big farms of the Northwest have not as a rule proved permanently\n\nprofitable The most prosperous communities are where the farms are\n\nmoderate in size highly cultivated and occupied by intelligent and indus\n\ntrious families who take pleasure and pride in their business and sur\n\nroundings\n\nTo make the cotton producers at the South the richest and most inde\n\npendent people of the globe they have only to cultivate less land in cotton\n\ncultivate it better that is bring it to the highest state of cultivation pos\n\nsible and put the remainder in diversified crops cultivated on the same plan\n\nMATTERS OF GENERAL INTEREST TO THE FARMER\n\nThe following extracts from the exchanges of the Department of Agri\n\nculture do we believe contain sound advice and information of value to\n\nfarmers\n\nCLOVER AS A FERTILIZER SUITED BEST TO MIDDLE AND NORTH GEORGIA\n\nThe clover plant yields the richest manures and that is the stuff that most\n\nfarmers now need Clover gives good wheat corn meat milk and the24\n\nDEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTUREGEORGIA\n\ncheapest and best of all fertilizers Wheat and clover should take the place\n\nof weeds and sassafras bushes\n\nI look back over fifty years and make a note of the fact that the farms of\n\nthis locality on which clover has been grown with the greatest regularity\n\nare today the farthest from exhaustion Clover is such a help in solving\n\nthe problem of available plant food that I believe it to be a work of benev\n\nolence to help in the management of it\n\nThere is one blunder almost universal which I believe largely reduces\n\nthe value of clover both for feed seed and fertility and this is the uni\n\nversal habit of pasturing young clover as soon as the wheat is out of the\n\nfield I do not think it is even a wise policy to pasture for a month or six\n\nweeks after harvest and believe it better to lay down a rule never to past\n\nure the first fall under any circumstances This rule I have followed for\n\ntwenty years and believe that I have been the gainer by it\n\nAs a recapitulation of this article or rather to enforce it I say sow clover\n\nwith all small grain no matter what crop is to follow it Use plenty of seed\n\nit is the cheapest way of fertilizing and keeping your land clean at your\n\ncommand Do not be so greedy for a little feed as to pasture the young\n\nclover before it has made growth enough to cover the land for by so doing\n\nyou will in the long run have much less feed and less benefit to the land\n\nRemember that a soil densely shaded is always improved and that no other\n\ncrop you can grow will furnish as good shade as clover\n\nHOW AND WHEN TO SOW CLOVER\n\nSeptember is the best month in which to sow clover October is probably\n\nthe next best if not sown before the last of October it is better to wait\n\nuntil February It is not considered the best practice by the most expe\n\nrienced clovergrowers in the southern border of the clovergrowing section\n\nto sow the seeds with small grain Success is more certain when clover is\n\nsown by itself or with some other grass like orchard blue grass etc If\n\nyou sow in February we would advise not to sow with oats or other grain\n\nThere is no advantage to be gained in breaking the land earlier than a week\n\nor two before sowing unless it may be necessary to break earlier in order\n\nto get it into good condition The soil should be well pulverized and har\n\nrowed smoothly Sow about twelve pounds of clover seed per acre if sown\n\nby itself if with orchard grass use eight or ten pounds of clover and one\n\nand onehalf bushels of orchard grass seed While the surface is mellow\n\nand fresh from recent harrowing mix the clover seed with ashes or sifted\n\nsoil or with good fertilizer and sow half one way and half the other so as\n\nto get a uniform distribution then sow the orchard grass or other grass seed\n\nin the same way No covering by plw brush or harrow is necessary\n\nthe next rain will cover sufficiently If the soil is not rich enough to bring\n\nhalf a bale of cotton or twentyfive bushels of corn per acre it would be\n\nwell to fertilize it using not less than two hundred pounds of good ammo\n\nniated phosphate\n\nFARMING A SCIENCE\n\nFarming is a real science and not mere plowing and dropping seed in the\n\nground any negro can do that but to sow and plow with judgment to unSUGGESTIONS AND INFORMATIONDECEMBER 25\n\nderstand the laws of nature and to take advantage of these laws means\n\nsuccess When a farmer says It is too much trouble I have not the\n\ntime I know how to gauge his judgment Whatever willgive oradvance\n\nprosperity in any business there is always time to do that thing\n\nADOPT BUSINESS METHODS\n\nOf many remedies one worth trying is business That old saw business\n\ns business contains a world of meaning it is full of sound common sense\n\nEvery farmer ought to be a firstrate business man In this age he must\n\nbe or he will fail as sure as fate Show me a farmer who has no head for\n\nbusiness and you will point to a man who is on the road to ruin\n\nBut what do we mean by a firstrate business man Is the farmer who\n\nproduces abundant crops of the best quality at the least cost a good business\n\nman 3STot necessarily such a man is undoubtedly a good farmer but he\n\nmight at the same time be a poor business man\n\nThere are a large number of farmers in the country who year after year\n\nproduce abundant crops of the best quality and at the least cost and yet\n\ngrow poorer and poorer the longer they live because they are not good busi\n\nness managers\n\nThe pecuniary success of farming as well as every other business depends\n\nnot so much upon production of abundance of products of the best quality at\n\nthe least cost important as this may be as it does upon the proper answer\n\nto the questions What shall we produce in what quantities when shall it\n\nbe producedand how when where and for what price and to whom shall\n\nit be sold\n\nWHY NOT BAISE YOUR OWN WORK ANIMALS\n\nThe following from The Southern Cultivator shows that at eight cents\n\nper pound Georgia pays 100000 bales of cotton for horses and mules Can\n\nour farmers prosper and pursue this course\n\nA careful estimate reveals the fact that most of the counties in Middle\n\nGeorgia have for long years paid in actual cash from 318000 to 30000\n\nannually for mules and horses brought from the West Striking a low\n\naverage from the entire State we find between 3000000 and 4000000\n\ntaken from the State for stock that could be raised for a nominal sum upon\n\nour own fields What stupendous folly when it is conceded on all hands\n\nthat our stock can be raised at less cost than in the markets from which we\n\nbuy Grass grows as freely our soil produces forage as abundantly our\n\nwinters are far less rigorous and the necessary care therefore less ex\n\npensive Everything is favorable to the enterprise wisdom and economy\n\nurge the undertaking Every farmer should raise at least the stock needed\n\nupon his farm It greatly helps the general good to hold annual colt shows\n\nboth as an evidence of progress and an encouragement to others\n\nUSE MORE FERTILIZERS\n\nThe farmers of the South do not use enough manure or to state it in a\n\ndifferent form they take from the soil every year very much more than\n\nthey return to it in manure It is easy to show that fertilizers pay better\n\ndividends than any other investment on the farm The conclusion is irre26 DEPARTMANT OF AGRICULTUREGEORGIA\n\nsistible that we should use more fertilizers not commercial or bought fer\n\ntilizers alone but home manures composts green crops turned under\n\nmarls etc everything that will add more to the yield of the crop than\n\nthe cost of its application To have an abundance of stable or barnyard\n\nmanures there must be an increase in the number of animals fed This\n\ngives diversity to the farm and increases the sources of income A well\n\nfed cow will nearly pay for her keep in manure besides a good profit on\n\nthe butter sold and consumed\n\nA GOOD MAXIM FOR FARMERS\n\nRaising cotton on poor land does not pay I cannot afford to raise cotton\n\nin less quantities than one bale per acre and in order to bring my land up\n\nto that point must make manure and the cheapest is that made from stock\n\nraised on a farm\n\nThe old beaten trackis not always the best The old beaten track\n\nis not the one that will always lead us most quickly or even most surely\n\nto success in agriculture New ideas and new methods have come up in\n\nevery branch of farm practice during recent years and many of them have\n\nalready been tried and found good A prejudice in favor of old ways\n\nshould not keep one from being progressive Read study and keep up\n\nwith the times\n\nFarmers cannot prosper as long as they are compelled to sell their cotton\n\nor starve The situation is an unfortunate one for our farmers but they\n\ncan improve it very much hereafter by their own efforts They can never\n\ncommand the situation so long as they must sell their cotton or starve\n\nThey cau command it when they can live without selling and sell only to\n\nrealize profits The increase in the production of food crops on Southern\n\nfarms shows a tendency in the right direction It is a tendency which no\n\nrise in the price of cotton should stop If it continues long enough it\n\nwill make the production of cotton again profitable and our farmers pros\n\nperous\n\nCULTIVATE WELL IF YOU PLANT LESS\n\nMore work amounts to nothing unless there is reason judgment and\n\ncalculation back of it Judgment and calculation are all important in all\n\nundertakings The know how the know when and the know why are\n\ncalculation and judgment nicely balanced Labor without forethought\n\nand calculation will end in failure or a poor support System plan me\n\nthodical ways do not beget a fussy bustling or an excited way of doing\n\nthings but the machinery of action seems to run itself\n\nAgain a small business with small profits demand long and arduous\n\nlabor There is no expansion in some callings the field is limited and\n\nit will not grow larger for there is no room for enlargement A certain\n\namount of business can be done in a certain calling and no extra efforts\n\nwill add to it Take the newspaper business of today with a paper inSUGGESTIONS AND INFORMATIONDECEMBER 2J\n\nevery county and in some two or three They will have a certain amount\n\nof circulation and no more and all the fuss and fury displayed or put on\n\nwill not add a dollar but rather sink money A piece of India rubber will\n\nstretch to a certain length and any more pulling will break it\n\nAgain two farmersBaldwin and Milledgewith a mule apiece go to\n\nfarming Baldwin cultivates about thirty acres with his mule manures\n\nwell works deep plants everything he consumes on the place corn po\n\ntatoes etc raises his own meat has system judgment and calculation in\n\neverything he does does not rush and push to try to do too much with\n\nhis force and the result is a success His cotton money is all clear gain\n\nMilledge without judgment and calculation wants to cultivate all cotton\n\nand tries to make one mule cultivate about sixty acres Always in the\n\ngrass ground badly plowed everything to buy that he should have raised\n\nand though he works harder longer and wears himself out he is a failure\n\nand grows poorer and poorer every year Far better to make one acre\n\nwell manured produce thirty bushels of corn or a bag of cotton than three\n\nacres half cultivated with all the wear and tear to get thirty bushels

which it brings and begin our work with well defined plans and\n\npurposes Our losses and disappointments are behind us to repine over\n\nthem is folly To apply the lessons which they have taught is all we can\n\ngain from them Unfortunately some of us are in debt but having ar\n\nranged terms with creditors let each take fresh courage and let us all begin\n\nat once to put our plans into

the\n\nresult of that hopefulness which springs afresh in our hearts with every\n\nrecurring season Unless they are founded on the more substantial basis\n\nwe need scarcely hope for progress or for success We should consider\n\nthoughtfully not only wherein we have succeeded but wherein we have\n\nfailed and to what causes these failures are due Have we handled our\n\naffairs on business principles Were our lands thoroughly prepared before\n\nplanting Were manures wisely and judiciously used Were they dis\n\ntributed on land that had some vigor left in it or did we follow the

In investigating these ques\n\ntions I find that\n\nour greatest mistake\n\nlies in this hopeless effort to use elements which are so firmly bound in the\n\nsoil that only the sesame of enlightened agricultural methods will un\n\nlock them to us Instead of applying these methods we go on from year to\n\nyear hoping by taking a little from each broad acre to better our fortunes\n\nwhen\n\nthe

hard lessons of a quarter of a century\n\nBear in mind that while we are to a great extent independent of all other\n\nnations in the production of cottonthat is that no other nation can pro\n\nduce it profitably at ten ceuts yet when we produce a cotton crop at any\n\nprofit if this is done by diminishing the all important food crops\n\nWE SACRIFICE THE INDEPENDENCE\n\nwhich this monopoly would give us and any reduction in the price falls\n\nwith distressing effect upon us We make the worlds cotton We have\n\nno competition worthy of serious consideration The worlds cotton market\n\nis our

the world with bread after the supply in\n\nother countries has been exhausted The South can produce cotton cheaper\n\nthan other countries and to that extent she has an opportunity to make a\n\nprofit on the crop As yet no rival which is strong enough to wrest this\n\nadvantage from us has entered the field But our industry is in a\n\nMOST CRITICAL CONDITION\n\nbecause we put into our

well supplied with humus use liberally and work\n\nwell into the soil If your land is run down take only the best por\n\ntions put all your work on these and by planting renovating crops in\n\nconjunction with fertilization gradually bring up the other poorer\n\nportions\n\nLONG STAPLE COTTON\n\nSince the introduction of commercial fertilizers and their judicious use\n\non the light sandy soil of lower Georgia it has been demonstrated that\n\nthe long staple cotton can be grown successfully in all the lower tier of\n\ncounties and as this commands more than double the price of the short\n\nstaple I would advise its cultivation in that section There is certainly\n\nmoney in it to the farmer who will give it the proper care in both cultiva\n\ntion and gathering I know of instances where farmers have made a bale\n\nto two acres and have received from twenty to twentythree cents per\n\npound for their crops What could we substitute that would pay a largerSUGGESTIONS AND INFORMATIONJANUARY 3 I\n\nper cent per acre The seed will deteriorate but if we are successful in\n\nproducing a fair crop this difficulty can be overcome by the introduction\n\nof new seed every few years High fertilization counts as sensibly on this\n\ncrop as any that we plant and as it is a larger grower it requires great dis\n\ntance Should any farmer wish information as to seed etc I will cheer\n\nfully aid him\n\nTOBACCO\n\nAbout a year ago great interest was manifested in the cultivation of to\n\nbacco and some neighborhoods became greatly excited over the reports of\n\nfortunes being made in the production of this crop In my addresses and\n\nin every article I have written on this subject I have advised a conserva\n\ntive course The results of the past season establish beyond a doubt that\n\ngood tobacco can be grown in Georgia Both bright and mahogany wrap\n\npers of good texture can be made But in many instances farmers have\n\nmade the mistake of planting too large a crop of only one or at the outside\n\ntwo varieties and as the result of inexperience and other attendants on a\n\nnew industry the tobacco has turned out unmarketable\n\nTHE PROPER PLAN\n\nin entering on this to us untried industry is to experiment with small\n\npatches of several different varieties and acquire the necessary knowledge\n\nnot only for the cultivation but for the curing of the crop Everything\n\ndepends on proper handling of the crop after it is made Tobacco is differ\n\nent from cotton in this that the wide margin in prices is due solely to the\n\ncondition of the tobacco marketed and is not influenced by combinations\n\nor speculation The following table approximates prices and gives an idea\n\nof the wide difference between poor and good samples\n\nFILLERS\n\nCommon to medium3 to 6 cents\n\nMedium to good6 to 8\n\nGood to fine8 to 15\n\nA difference of 12 cents from lowest to highest grade\n\nSMOKERS\n\nCommon to medium81 to 6

fillers is always crowded and dull Market\n\nfor fine bright and mahogany wrappers is always active and prices firm A\n\nglance only is needed to see that it will not pay to make large crops of poor\n\ngrade Our plan should be to turn out a large proportion of good quality\n\nIt is said that from 700 to 1000 pounds of tobacco can be grown on one\n\nacre but it depends on its cultivation and subsequent handling whether\n\nthis amount would be marketable If these are properly managed a good\n\nproportion of both wrappers and cutters can be had\n\nTOBACCO FACTORIES\n\nI am convinced from the experience of the past year that unless we can\n\nhave our factories in our own State it will not pay to make tobacco except\n\nfor home consumption Let our farmers demonstrate that they are willing\n\nto bestow the care and attention which this crop requires in other words\n\nlet them raise good tobacco then warehousemen experienced and compe\n\ntent classifiers and also factories will follow\n\nbroom corn\n\nIt has always been our policy to encourage diversification of crops and\n\nexperiments in untried branches of agriculture that the full capacity of\n\nour soil and climate may be thoroughly tested at the same time advising\n\nthat the cultivation of no plant be undertaken on a large scale until a\n\nsufficient number of crops have been profitably marketed to prove that\n\nthere is money in its cultivation It is always necessary before entering\n\nupon a new agricultural undertaking to carefully consider the market\n\nprices and facilities for marketing and the farmer himself is best fitted to\n\ndeal with these questions in regard to his local market its demands other\n\nmarkets their demands freight rates etc We thus preface a few words\n\non broom corn and its cultivation in reply to inquiries on this subject in\n\norder to prevent any farmer from undertaking to cultivate it on too large\n\na scale without having thoroughly weighed the conditions that surround\n\nhim or proved it a profitable crop\n\nThe introduction of broom corn into the United States has been credited\n\nto Benj Franklin It is said that in a whisk broom from the East Indies\n\nhe found a single seed and that from the planting of this seed has ex\n\ntended the cultivation of broom corn until it has reached its present large\n\nproportions Whether this be true or not the plant belongs to the sugar\n\ncane family essentially North American and it can be grown in any part\n\nof the United States\n\nSOIL\n\nAny soil adapted to common corn will be found good for broom corn\n\nand like corn unless the soil is rich or well fertilized the yield will be\n\nvery poor Rotation will be found advantageous though the crop will\n\ngrow on the same ground for years Any ordinary complete fertilizer ap\n\nplied in the hills or drills will do to manure with if required by the soil and\n\nits use and that of barnyard manure will nearly always be found to largely\n\nincrease the yieldSUGGESTIONS AND INFORMATIONJANUARY 33\n\nPLANTING\n\nPrepare your land well as if for ordinary corn and sow in hills three feet\n\nby four or in drills three and a half feet apart The rows should be run\n\nnorth and south that all the plants may receive the benefit of the sun\n\nalike In each hill from forty to fifty seed should be dropped covering\n\nthem from an inch to an inch and a half Where seed are sown in drills\n\nthey should be about two inches apart In thinning out leave from three\n\nto ten stalks to the hill The seed should be planted a little later than\n\ncommon corn\n\nCULTIVATION\n\nIn cultivation weeds should be exterminated and for this reason work\n\nshould begin as soon as the plants are large enough to be distinguished and\n\ncontinue until the plants are a foot or more high The harrow tooth culti\n\nvator with the front tooth removed is the best implement and when the\n\ncondition of the crop demands it it should be hoed over\n\nVARIETIES\n\nAs to habit the plant is both dwarf and standard the former growing\n\nfrom three to four feet and the latter as high as fifteen feet In harvesting\n\nthe dwarf variety the brush is jerked out of the sheath of the upper leaf\n\nwithout bending or breaking In the standard varieties where the season\n\nis likely to be too short for the corn to mature the brush should be lopped\n\nthat is the top bent over twelve or fifteen inches below the brush allowing\n\nit to hang down against the stalk As our seasons are usually long lopping\n\nwill seldom be necessary The time to cut is when the blossoms begin to fall\n\nWith the standard varieties where the stalks are too high to be reached\n\ntabling is required This consists in breaking down the stalks of two rows\n\nabout two and a half feet from the ground so that they will cross each\n\nother diagonally\n\nCURING\n\nThe corn should be cured under a roof where there is a free circulation\n\nof air From two to four weeks will be all the time required The seed\n\nare removed in several ways and this should be done before the corn is\n\ncured though it may be delayed until afterward A hatchel a wooden\n\ncomb or a long tooth currycomb may be used to remove them\n\nWHERE TO MARKET\n\nIn preparing for market the corn is put up in bales weighing from 150 to\n\n450 pounds In putting up the bales a hay or cotton press can be used\n\nNeat and wellpacked corn will bring a better price than when carelessly\n\npacked Before packing the brush should be assorted as crooked and de\n\nfective heads will injure the sale The price of broom corn varies very\n\nmuch the best corn being worth from 7 to 15 a hundred and inferior\n\nqualities from 2 to 10 From four to six hundred pounds can be made\n\nper acre Louisville Cinci nnati and St Louis are perhaps the best markets\n\nfor Southern growers34\n\nDEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTUREGEORGIA\n\nMELON CROP\n\nI wish to call the immediate attention of melon growers to the effect\n\nthata cholera epidemic or even the fearof that disease entering our ports\n\nwould have on the melon trade We would advise our growers to reduce\n\ntheir acreage so that if the disease should again break out the result to them\n\nwould not be so disastrous It is well known that the fear of cholera will\n\noften induce the authorities of large cities to enforce regulations against\n\nthe sale of fruits and that when the disease is across the Atlantic the sale\n\nof melons is greatly effected Confronted by such conditions no farmer\n\ncan afford to plant very largely and none on borrowed capital Should\n\nthe cholera be stamped out in Europe growers will lose but very little as\n\nenhanced price will compensate for reduced yield We trust that all who\n\nraise melons for market will seriously consider the financial loss they might\n\nincur by planting too largely Medical experts have warned us that this\n\ndisease has been lurking in several European states for two years and the\n\nchances are favorable for an outbreak in the United States the coming\n\nsummer The man who is financially able to make the experiment who\n\nhas the money to invest can afford to incur tbe risk if in his judgment\n\nthe chances for success are greater than for failure but the man who bor\n\nrows money to invest in so doubtful an enterprise is courting overwhelm\n\ning disaster\n\nHOGS\n\nAmong the many plans which have sunk into innocuous dissuetude\n\nis that of making our own juicy hams and beautifully white and whole\n\nsome lard In curing our own pork we have the satisfaction of knowing\n\njust how these hogs were raised their condition when converted into pork\n\nand the quality of meat in daily use on our tables We all can remember\n\nwith what pleasure weoncelooked forward to the hog killing But the\n\nvery same reasons which induced us to give up making our corn and wheat\n\nnamely the price of cotton the low figure at which we could obtain our\n\nbread from the West our changed labor introducing the restless tenant\n\nand renter system the ease with which credit could be obtained to make\n\ncotton and buy all food supplies the losses from cholera and other diseases\n\nall combined to iufluence a majority of our farmers to abandon the raising\n\nof hogs But because we have erred in this matter is no reason why we\n\nshould continue in a course which is wrong in principle and should be\n\nabandoned at once\n\nEVERY MAN WHO OWNS A FARM\n\nand fifty per cent of those who rent can with a little extra labor and out\n\nlay prepare pastures and plant crops which will come on at different sea\n\nsons of the year rye and barley in the fall followed by oats then field\n\npeas these to be succeeded by ground peas and potatoes and in this way\n\nhe can raise his meat at a nominal cost The present year I have cured a\n\nbeautiful lot of meat which pastured and at the same time fed on the waste\n\nmilk of
