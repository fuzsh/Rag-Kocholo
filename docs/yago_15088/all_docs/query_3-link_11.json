        "text": "List of mayors of Jeffersonville, Indiana is a list from the first mayor to the current mayor of the city.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nJeffersonville was founded in 1802 and was run by trustees until 1839 in which Dr. Nathaniel Field, a state legislator and trustee of Jeffersonville, secured legislation to make Jeffersonville a city.[1] In April of that year the first mayor would be elected. The position would be a part-time position until 1964 with Mayor Richard Vissing becoming the first full-time mayor.\n\nList\n\n[edit]\n\n# Name Term start Term end Party 1 1839 1843 2 1843 1845 3 1845 1848 4\n\n(1812–1866; aged 54) 1848 1854 5\n\n(?–1872) 1854 1855 6 1855 1856 7 1856 1857 8 1857 1858 9 1858 1861 10\n\n(1808–1895; aged 87) 1861 1865 Democratic 11 1865 1867 12\n\n(1827–1890; aged 62) January 1, 1867 December 31, 1869 Republican 13 1869 1873 Democratic 14\n\n(1805–1985; aged 80) 1873 1875 Democratic 15 (1st)\n\n(1841–1902; aged 60) 1875 1883 Democratic 16\n\n(1843–1925; aged 82) 1883 1885 Republican 17 1885 1887 Democratic 18 Luther Warder (2nd) 1887 1891 Democratic 19 1891 1894 Republican 20 1894 1898 Republican 21\n\n(1859–1904; aged 44) January 1, 1898 December 31, 1902 Democratic 22\n\n(1844–1906; aged 62) 1903 1904 Republican 23\n\n(1852–1932; aged 79) January 1, 1904 December 31, 1906 Democratic 24 1907 1909 Republican 25 1910 1912 Democratic 26 Jonas G.
