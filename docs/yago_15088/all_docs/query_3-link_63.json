        "text": "J. V. SCHOFIELD, M. D.\n\nProbably there is no more popular physician and surgeon in Greensburg, or, indeed, in Decatur county, than the gentleman whose name appears at the head of this sketch. He stands deservedly high in his profession and is called into consultation by physicians in various parts of this and adjoining counties, his skill, particularly in surgical cases, being widely recognized.\n\nThe parents of the Doctor, Joshua and Lucretia (Jowett) Schofield, were natives of Hanley, Yorkshire, England. His maternal grandfather, Samuel Jowett, was of the so-called \"gentry.\" in England, and, being an elder son, inherited large estates. He emigrated to the United States with his family, including his daughter Lucretia, in 1830, and, locating in Dearborn county, bought a farm, and remained there for twenty-five years. Then, disposing of his property, he returned to his native land, where he eventually died. Samuel S. Schofield, the paternal grandfather of the Doctor, also crossed the ocean in 1830, and took up his residence in Dearborn county, and some ten or fifteen years later returned to England, there passing his remaining years. Joshua Schofield was a woolen manufacturer, and was actively engaged in business at Vernon until his death, in 1863, when he was only forty-three years of age. He had three children. The eldest, Samuel, is engaged in the management of a woolen factory at Madison. Indiana, and Joshua also resides at Madison.\n\nDr. J. V. Schofield was born in Vernon, Indiana, April 6, 1856. and was in his seventh year when he went to Madison to live. He received a good education, and left Hanover College, in his sophomore year, in order to take up the study of medicine with Dr. G. A. Kunkler, a celebrated physician of Madison, he having graduated in medicine at Vienna, Austria. In 1878 our subject was given the degree of Doctor of Medicine, in the Miami Medical College, and soon afterward he established an office at Harris City, six miles south of Greensburg. There he was successfully engaged in practice for nine years, at the expiration of which period he came to Greens- burg. He has made somewhat of a specialty of diseases of the eye, and, as previously stated, has been very successful as a surgeon. For several years he has been the local surgeon for the Big Four Railroad, and for about a decade he has been a member of the County and State Medical Societies and the American Medical Association and the American Medical Association of Railway Surgeons. For five years he served as a member of the local board of pension examiners, being its secretary during Harrison's administration.\n\nSocially the Doctor is identified with the Knights of Pythias, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and the Masonic fraternity, being past master of Lodge No. 476, F. and A. M., and past chancellor of Lodge No. 148, K. of P. He takes great interest in whatever tends to uplift and benefit humanity, and is a loyal, patriotic citizen. In 1886 he married Belle Smalley, of this county, and their two children, named Walter D. and Mabel L., respectively, are well worthy of their parents' pride. [Source: \"A Genealogical and Biographical Record of Decatur County, Indiana\", The Lewis Publishing Co, Chicago; pub. 1900]\n\nE. G. SCHULTZ\n\nThe modern spirit of business push and enterprise is nowhere in Greensburg to be seen to better advantage than in the extensive furniture establishment of which the subject of this article is proprietor. The same upright principles which animate him in public life are carried into each of his business transactions, thus winning for him the just confidence of his patrons. Though his has not been an extremely eventful life, there are numerous lessons to be gleaned from it, and a careful review of its details doubtless would serve as an incentive to many a young man who has his own way to make in the world. The following outline of career will be of interest to his hosts of lifelong friends in this thriving city.\n\nA son of William and Margaret (Schwier) Schultz, our subject is of German descent on both the paternal and maternal lines, as their names plainly indicate. The father was born in Ripley County, Indiana, in 1843, and continued to dwell there until 1870, when he removed to Greensburg. In his early manhood he learned the trade of a carpenter and later took and executed contracts for building. In 1860, in company with his brother George, he succeeded in organizing what was known as the Union Furniture Company, of Batesville, a stock company of which he was made president. The brothers were very influential in the actual working out of the plan and attended personally to the erection of the factory and the management of business. After some ten years of flourishing trade, carried on in spite of the depressing war period which intervened, the factory was destroyed by fire, and both brothers lost heavily. Soon after that event they settled in Greensburg, and, under the firm name of George & William Schultz, engaged in the furniture and undertaking business together for five years. At the expiration of that time George Schultz withdrew from the firm and went to the west, while the other partner continued to conduct the business alone for a few years. In April 1899 he retired and is passing his declining days in quietness and freedom from care. For a quarter of a century, he was a member of the Centenary Methodist Episcopal church, and now is identified with the First Methodist Episcopal church, of this city. His wife, the mother of our subject departed this life in 1896. They were the parents of two sons and a daughter. One son died in infancy, and the daughter, Hattie, is the wife of Patrick Ewing, of this county.\n\nThe birth of E. G. Schultz occurred April 29, 1868, in Batesville, Ripley County, Indiana, and as he was brought to Greensburg at the age of two years, he remembers no other home. Here he grew to manhood, attending the common schools until he was fifteen, when he commenced working in a planing mill. At the end of a year spent in that employment he became a clerk in the freight office of the Big Four Railroad, and served for four years in that capacity. His fidelity and general trustworthiness placed him in line for promotion, and during a period of three and one-half years he was a fireman for the same corporation, and soon would have been placed in charge of an engine, as engineer, had he not obtained a ninety-days' leave of absence, and ere its close had resigned from the company's employ in order to join his father in that gentleman's long established business here. They were associated until recently, when, as previously stated, the senior partner withdrew, and the firm is now known as that of E. G. Schultz & Company. The business, now managed solely by E. G. Schultz, has grown to large proportions, and few better locations or more extensive stocks of goods can he found in the state. The handsome store has a street frontage of forty feet, while it extends back one hundred and ten feet, and an additional space, thirty by sixty feet in dimensions, affords necessary storage room. The second floor of the building is also utilized for various departments, and three or more clerks are employed to attend to the needs of customers. Mr. Schultz is a careful painstaking undertaker, and at the time of his examination by the Indiana state hoard of health his standing was ninety-eight per cent.\n\nHe is a member of the Indiana Funeral Directors' Association.\n\nFraternally Mr. Schultz belongs to Greensburg Lodge, No. 476, F. & A. M.; Greensburg Lodge, No. 103, I. O. O. F., and Sexton Encampment, No. 42, of the same order; Greensburg Lodge, K. of P.; Pequannock Lodge, No. 185, I. O. R. M.; and the Order of the Eastern Star. His marriage to Miss Martha Hightower was celebrated in this city in 1892. They have a pleasant home and enjoy the esteem of a large circle of friends.

SEFTON\n\nFor more than three-score years the Sefton family has been closely associated with the upbuilding of Decatur county, and every one bearing the name has been noted for those traits of character which are marked in the ideal patriot and good citizen. It is believed that all of the numerous Selftons in this part of the United States are descended from one of four brothers who emigrated from Ireland to America about the same time, at the close of the last century. These brothers, named respectively William, James, Henry, and Samuel, located in the state of Ohio, and three of the number eventually came to Decatur County, Indiana. The other one, Henry, a native of county Downs, Ireland, died of the cholera, in Ohio, in 1834. He left four daughters and two sons, one of the latter being William O., father of the subject of this narrative. The other, Henry, and his sister, Mrs. Maria Scott, passed their entire lives in the Buckeye state, but all of the other brothers and sisters became residents of Decatur County.\n\nWilliam O. Sefton was born in Butler County, Ohio, February 22, 1806. After he settled in this county, he adopted the letter O for a middle initial (it standing for his native state) in order to prevent complication, as there was another farmer of the same name living in his own township. His marriage to Catherine Shuck, a lady of German lineage, was celebrated in Ohio, October 20, 1831. She was born the same year as was her husband, her birth taking place a few months later, on the 15th of May. Seven years subsequent to their marriage they decided to try their fortunes in Decatur County, and, coming here, took up their abode in a log cabin which had been built on a tract of land entered by Henry Sefton, father of William O. Sefton. This property is within the present boundaries of Clinton township, and here our subject's parents spent the remaining years of their useful lives. In the course of time the old log cabin gave place to a comfortable dwelling, erected by the father, and other material improvements were made by him and his sons. All of them were industrious, frugal, and honest, enjoying the respect of their neighbors and striving ever to perform their duty toward God and man. William O. Sefton owned about a thousand acres of land, the result of long years of toil and indefatigable effort. In political belief, he was a Democrat, and his wife, who was a very lovable woman, was a member of the Methodist church. He passed to the silent land, October 29, 1868, and about a year later his devoted wife passed away, October 5, 1869.\n\nOf the five sons and four daughters born to that worthy couple all but two survive, -Michael, born September 9, 1836, having died June 15, 1869; and Elizabeth, born June 22, 1835, having passed away August 19, 1880. Those living are Henry T., now of Colorado, born January 25, 1833; Eliza, widow of Henderson Scott, born April 2, 1834; Isaac, of Greensburg, Indiana, born September 28, 1837; Edward B.; Mary, wife of Lewis Willey, of Washington township, born April 19, 1840; Sarah, born October 13, 1844, and now widow of John Anderson, and a resident of Greensburg; and William Warder, born August 11, 1846, and now living in Howard County, Indiana.\n\nEdward B. Sefton, who was the first child born to his parents after their arrival in this county, was born in the little log cabin, on the last day of January 1839. There he was reared, and, after an interval of a number of years, during which period he resided in the vicinity of Milford, he returned to his birthplace, and buying out the other heirs has since made his home here. The farm now comprises three hundred and thirty-six acres of land, most of which is kept under cultivation. It is considered one of the most valuable homesteads in the township of Clinton, and everything about the place bears evidence of the careful attention of the owner, who is a practical farmer.\n\nIn his early man hood Mr. Sefton married Caroline K. Smiley, and three sons and two daughters blessed their union. Wilhelmina is the wife of William Ryan, of Tipton, Indiana; Romie Michael is a resident of this county; Henry L. and Edward aid their father in the management of the home place; and Ella is the wife of Henry D. Edmeades. Each of the children of our subject received as good advantages in the way of an education and in practical training for the duties of life as he was able to afford, and now he is rewarded in seeing them useful and respected citizens. Both he and his estimable wife are deservedly esteemed, and, as they enter upon their declining days, they may have the comforting assurance that they have nobly performed the part in life which was assigned to them.

Walsh]\n\nISAAC SEFTON\n\nMr. Sefton is one of the substantial men of Decatur county and an honored citizen of Greensburg, where he has resided for the past three years, since giving up the active management of the farm. He was born in Butler county, Ohio. September 28, 1837. His father, William Sefton, was a son of Henry Sefton, a native of Ireland and the son of an army officer. Henry Sefton came to this country and was a pioneer of Butler county, Ohio, where he carried on farming, and there died of cholera in 1834. His children were: William, father of our subject: Henry, who died in Ohio: Mana, Mrs. A. Scott; Jane, Mrs. Hughes; Ellen. Mrs. Hungerford: and Sarah, Mrs. Brevoort. William Sefton was born in Butler county, Ohio, February 22, 1806, and after his marriage, and the birth of five children, he removed to Indiana, in .1838. settling in Decatur county, on land entered by his father. He there improved a good farm and became a successful and leading citizen. He gradually added to his property until he was the owner of a large tract of land. He was cautious and conservative in his business operations, and seldom made mistakes in his investments. Personally he was a man of fine character, social in his disposition, of undoubted integrity, and honored in all his dealings. He had a high standard of morality, never having used any bad language, and lived up to the commandments to the best of his knowledge, although he never united with any church. Mr. Sefton was a Democrat in his political views, and popular with his party, although he never aspired to office. He once served as trustee, at a time when it took only three men to transact all the business for the township of Clinton, where he lived. His death took place October 29, 1868, from a violent attack of pneumonia.\n\nMr. Sefton was married in 1830 to Catherine Shuck, who was born in Butler county, Ohio, May 5, 1806. She was a daughter of Michael Shuck, of Pennsylvania-Dutch descent, who was a prosperous farmer in Butler county, where he lived until he became quite old. After his family had married and scattered he came to Decatur county, and spent his last days with his daughter, and here he died October 19, 1855. at the advanced age of eighty-eight years. He was a conscientious, religious man, and lived an upright life. His children were six in number: Sarah became the wife of Governor William Bebb. of Ohio; Eliza (Mrs. A. Lawrence), resides in Bartholomew county, Indiana; Peggy (Mrs. Mulholland), resides in Butler county; Hannah, who died near Vevay, Indiana, was the wife of John Shull; Polly (Mrs. Hall), is a resident of Vevay; and Catherine, the mother of our subject, died in Decatur county. Mrs. Sefton was a woman of many admirable traits, being a devoted wife and mother, and was a consistent member of the Methodist church. To the parents of our subject nine children were born, as follows: Henry, born January 25, 1833, lives in Colorado; Eliza (Mrs. Scott) was born April 2, 1834, and makes her home in Ohio; Elizabeth, born June 22, 1835, never married, and died August 19, 1880; Michael, born April 9, 1836, died June 15, 1869. leaving a wife and one child, the wife being a daughter of James Hamilton and a sister of R. A. Hamilton; Isaac is the subject of this' sketch; Edward, born January 31, 1839, is a farmer in Decatur county; Mary, now Mrs. Louis Willie, was born April 19, 1840; Sarah, born October 13, 1844, is the widow of John Anderson and lives in Greensburg; and William W., was born August 11, 1846, and is a farmer in Howard county, Indiana.\n\nIsaac Sefton received only a limited common-school education. He remained at home with his parents until he was twenty-eight years old, then married and settled on land which was owned by his father, and which, after the death of the latter, became his own property. The land is in Clinton township. Decatur county, one and a half miles south of Spring Hill, and comprises one hundred and sixty acres. There was only a log cabin on the place when he took possession of it, and he at once set to work to make improvements. A commodious frame house was built, timber was cleared away, fruit trees were planted and crops were sown, and by degrees he purchased more land, until at present he owns three farms in Decatur county, five hundred and thirty-four acres in all, and a farm of seventy-one acres in Boone county, Indiana.\n\nMr. Sefton has carried on general farming, and has raised cattle and hogs sufficient for his own use, but has never done much trading in stock. He has been careful in his investments, has never indulged in speculation, and as a consequence has never met with any reverses in fortune. In 1886 he bought a fine property in Greensburg, consisting of two lots, on which were two houses, - one a frame structure and the other a brick building. Ten years later, in 1896, he retired from active business and took up his residence in the city of Greensburg. He has rented his farm and employs his time in looking after his various interests. In his political views Mr. Sefton is in sympathy with the Democratic party, although he has never cared for office, finding his time fully taken up in attending to his personal affairs. Both he and his wife are consistent and worthy members of the First Methodist church at Greensburg, in which he is a steward.\n\nMr. Sefton was married October 25, 1865. to Mary E. Myers, and the union has proved a most happy one, Mrs. Sefton being a lady of many excellent qualities, and one who has been a true helpmeet to her husband and a devoted mother to her children, two in number, namely: Katie, born November 13. 1868. is the wife of Frank R. Robbins. and has two children, Lelia N. and William S.; and Cora, born March 26, 1878, married W. H. Robbins, and has one child, Willa, who was born on Easter Sunday, April 2. 1899.\n\nMrs. Sefton is the daughter of Thomas S. and Mahala Myers, who were married, in Decatur county, in 1843. Mr. Myers was a son of Thomas Myers, who was of Pennsylvania-Dutch descent, and settled in Decatur county in an early day. He was a leading member of the Baptist church. His family comprised six children, namely: Anderson, Viana, Thomas S., Margaret, John and Edith. Thomas S. was a prosperous farmer and was prominently identified with the agricultural pursuits of Decatur county. In 1878. he unfortunately met with an accident, by which his spinal column was injured and he was incapacitated for further labor. He removed to Greensburg, where he was a constant invalid for nine years, and there died on October 18, 1887, at the age of sixty-two years. He was a consistent member of the Baptist church. His wife was a daughter of Walter Bradon, who was of Irish descent, but who was born in the United States in 1797. Twelve years after his marriage he brought his wife on horseback to Indiana, settling on a farm in Decatur county. He prospered in his affairs and took an active interest in the work of the Methodist church, to which he was a most liberal contributor. In those pioneer days there were few if any churches, and his house was used as a place of worship and was the home of itinerant preachers who traveled from one place to the other, holding meetings wherever a few faithful souls could be gathered together. Mr. Bradon died in 1879, his wife having passed away in 1855. Their children were: Mahala, Robert, John, Richard, Jane (Mrs. Russell), Landa and James. Mrs. Sefton's parents had seven children, as follows: Mary E., Robert W., Emma (Mrs. Gilmore). Morgan, Willard, Nevada (Mrs. W. S. Minqr) and Maggie B. (Mrs. Stapp). [Source: \"A Genealogical and Biographical Record of Decatur County, Indiana\", The Lewis Publishing Co, Chicago; pub. 1900]\n\nJAMES SEFTON\n\nAs is generally known, by the older residents at least, the Seftons were among the first to settle permanently in Decatur County, and consequently they suffered much more hardship than did those who came even a few years later. Only the hardiest and bravest withstood the privations and discouragements of the frontier life, many returning to the more comfortable homes they had left in the east or south. But the Seftons, as will be seen, were of stanch hearts and determined will, and in the course of a few years of persistent effort, they made a foothold, and in time became wealthy and influential, as many of them are today.\n\nJames Sefton is the only survivor of the family of William and Charlotte (Toppin) Sefton, natives of Ireland, the former born in county Down, about 1770. They were married in the Emerald Isle, and one son, John, was born to them ere they emigrated to America. Their other children comprised Hugh, Henry, Elizabeth, William, Samuel, Maria, and James. After their arrival in this country the young couple settled in Butler County, Ohio, and there, in dense woods, the father cleared a farm.\n\nWishing to increase his possessions and believing that he should be better prospered further west, he at length sold his farm, and with the hundred dollars which he received for the place he started with his family for Indiana, in 1824. Here, on what was then known as the \"new purchase,\" he bought eighty acres of land, at one dollar and a quarter an acre. This property was situated on section 8, of what now is Clinton township. After paying for his farm, all that the little family possessed was a few household utensils and necessities, besides the team and wagon in which their tediously long journey had been made. It was of small moment that their scanty stock of money was now exhausted, for there was no opportunity to purchase supplies, however much needed. While they were busily at work clearing a small tract of land and planting and raising a crop of corn, the family had no place of shelter other than their wagon, but in the autumn a primitive log cabin was erected. Not a board nor nail was to be had; but whereas many of the cabins of subsequent settlers had no floor but the ground, this one boasted of one made of puncheon! Game was abundant; indeed, the squirrels were so numerous that in spite of the heroic efforts of the family most of their valued corn was stolen by the pestiferous little animals. For a long time, the pioneers had no wheat or flour, and the corn which they raised had to be pounded or ground in the most primitive fashion, and it was the staple article of food. Such clothes as they had for years were made from flax grown in the fields, carded, spun, and woven by hand, and later, when a few enterprising farmers introduced some sheep into the county the wool was subjected to much the same process as the flax had been. With the assistance of his sons, William Sefton cleared his land and developed a valuable farm, and ere his death he witnessed a truly wonderful transformation of what had been a wilderness. He was summoned to his eternal rest in 1852, and so well had he filled his place in the community that he was long and deeply mourned. His first wife, the mother of our subject, died in Ohio, and his second wife, by whom he had one son, Thomas, survived him for a number of years.\n\nJames Sefton, who was the youngest child of the first marriage, was born in Butler County, Ohio, March 20, 1821, and was about three years old when he was brought to this county. Of course, there were no schools here for many years, and he was nearly grown when the first ones were instituted. For a few weeks each year, then, he was allowed to seek after wisdom, but beyond learning how to read and write and do simple problems in arithmetic, he has no indebtedness to the public school. He remained on the home farm until after the death of his father, when he became the owner of the place. Later he sold the property and bought the farm in Clinton township which has been his home for many years. By good management and economy, he has surrounded himself and his family with many of the comforts of modern life, yet his thoughts often traverse the rugged pathway his feet have trodden and he sometimes even sighs as he recalls the days of his boyhood, when, though poor and hard-working, he enjoyed splendid health and many a simple pleasure, in the happy companionship of the brothers and sisters who have long since passed away.\n\nOn the 15th of September 1842, Mr. Sefton married Mary Ann Power, who died on the 8th of December 1844, and left a daughter, Martha P., who is now the wife of McKenney Carter. The second wife of our subject bore the maiden name of Harriet Riffe. She was spared to him for many years, nobly sharing his joys and sorrows, but at length she was called from his side by the angel of death, December 2, 1898. Of her seven children two have passed away, namely: Martha and Oliver, and those living are David F., John W., Christopher A., Charles M., and Louisa C. They are citizens of excellent standing in the several communities in which they dwell and are worthy children of a noble father.

M.\n\nWidely acknowledged as one of the foremost educators and scientists of Indiana, Greensburg especially, of which place he was one of the leading citizens, feels that in the death of Professor William Pollock Shannon, an irreparable loss has been sustained. Heartfelt tributes to his personal worth and to his rare achievements came to his bereaved family from every part of the United States, leading educators and scientists uniting in praise of a career which was singularly pure, earnest and progressive.\n\nThe birth of Professor Shannon occurred upon his parents' homestead, near Spring Hill, Decatur county, October 31, 1847, and thus he had reached the half century mark at the time of his demise, December 16, 1897. His father, Thomas H. Shannon, a successful farmer, is deceased, but his widowed mother, Mrs. Mary (Mayne) Shannon, still resides on the old homestead. There it was that the boyhood days of our subject passed, and the love which he then formed for nature in her various manifestations never left him. He attended the district schools and later pursued higher studies under the preceptorship of J. C. Gregg, then principal of Richland Academy, but now superintendent of the city schools of Brazil, Indiana. At the end of three years the young man entered the junior year at Miami University, where he made such an exceptionally creditable record that it has been said that no graduate of the institution, save Whitelaw Reid, surpassed him in scholarship. His alma mater conferred upon him the degree of Master of Arts at the time of his graduation, June 10, 1873. Many positions were open to him, but he eventually decided to accept the principalship of the Glendale high school, near Cincinnati, Ohio. Having made a success of this, he accepted a call to Greensburg and became principal of the high school here. Needless to say that he more than fulfilled the expectations of his most confident friends, and that a higher and better system of management was carried into effect than had ever prevailed here before. It was not a surprise, therefore, that he was elected to serve as superintendent of the schools of Greensburg, in 1882, after his return from Europe. As superintendent he continued to act until his useful career was untimely ended, and thus, in the two responsible offices named, he played a noble, influential part for some twenty-three years. During that period our schools were rapidly advanced, until long ago they were ranked among the best in the state.\n\nBut the grand work of Professor Shannon was not narrowed to even this county, as he was a valued member of the State and National Teachers' Associations and was treasurer of the Indiana Academy of Science, and in innumerable ways came before the scientists and teachers of this land. Quotations from letters of a few of the eminent educators of the United States in regard to his standing will prove of interest to many of his old friends. David S. Jordan, president of Leland Stanford, Jr., University (of California), said: \"As a scientific man he had a high rank. His work was sound and accurate, and he had especial power in developing scientific methods in others. As a teacher he ranked with the best in the state. He was accurate and thorough on the one hand, and sympathetic and helpful on the other. As a man he was above reproach, and was to me one of the most valued of all my friends in Indiana.\" Francis M. stalker, editor of the Inland Educator, wrote: \"I regard Professor Shannon as one of the best men in the state. He certainly had some advanced ideas in regard to nature study in the schools. I have thought many times that the boys and girls at Greensburg had a large opportunity in having Mr. Shannon to show them how to see things. His ideas were practical and full of common sense.\"\n\nProfessor Shannon made for himself a lasting place in the domain of scientific research into the realm of nature in his native county. C. H. Eigenmann, the professor of zoology in the Indiana University (which institution conferred upon our subject the degree of Master of Arts), wrote to the bereaved relatives, among other things, the following: \"W. P. Shannon was a genial, earnest man. The papers he read before the Indiana Academy showed him to be a close and interested observer of the things about him. He was interested in many branches of natural history. He won the esteem of all of his associates in the academy, who made him a fellow of the academy, and elected him treasurer, a position he filled for a number of years. The museum of the Indiana University received many specimens from him in past years, especially of fishes, and his work on the fishes of his own county has made him a lasting name among the naturalists of the state.\" Another sincere friend, A. W. Butler, secretary of the board of state charities, said: \"I have known Professor Shannon for twelve years, and we had become fast friends. I found the longer I knew him, the closer became the ties of friendship. He was a close student, a hard worker, and a good observer and teacher. He has done much good work in science and loved the study of nature. He has been an excellent interpreter of nature's language, and perhaps few in our state have done so much to interest the youth of our public schools in nature studies as he. He was deeply interested in the work of the Indiana Academy of Science. Of that organization he was one of the charter members and was highly regarded by his associates. For several years he has been its treasurer.\" The high estimation in which our subject was held universally is expressed in the following lines from the pen of W. S. Blatchley, state geologist: \"I consider it an honor to have known W. P. Shannon personally. There are few men in Indiana who loved nature more, or who came in closer touch with her than he. With his own mind he reasoned out her secrets. He sought with his own eyes and hands her objects. His life work stands for far more for his thus doing than it would if he had accepted the ideas and works of other men as portrayed in books. His knowledge of the habits, haunts and life histories of birds, insects and other living forms was thus first-hand and manifold in character. With it was coupled an excellent knowledge of the fossil forms of the past ages, and of geology. He was thus enabled to understand much more fully than the average scientist the close relationship and interdependence existing among the various classes of natural objects, and he fully realized that each is not an isolated group standing alone, but that each is kin to all the others, an essential part of one grand and perfect whole,--the universe. His papers on nature study, in the Inland Educator, show how fully he was imbued with the thing itself and not the book concerning it; and how much he could get from a simple object in which the ordinary teacher could see nothing. These papers, if faithfully followed, will give a new impetus to nature study in the common schools of Indiana, which will serve as the best and most lasting monument of his life's work. As a member of the Indiana Academy of Science Professor Shannon stood high, and was always on the program with a paper embodying the result of valuable original observation. He will be greatly missed at its meeting, and with one accord its members will say that a noble-hearted, scholarly, painstaking investigator has forever gone from among their numbers.\"\n\nA loving tribute to Professor Shannon is found in the following letter from Stanley Coulter, then occupying the important chair of biology at Purdue University: \"It was with inexpressible sadness that I read the announcement of the death of W. P. Shannon. I had known him intimately for many years and found him, as did all others who knew him well, to always 'ring true.' Of sterling worth, of exceptional ability, and having accomplished much, he was, withal, so modest and unselfish that it is doubtful if all fully recognized his worth. In a state which for years has been the home of scientist of broad reputation, he was one of the leaders. His opinions carried with them weight, always based upon the most painstaking and careful observation. I have been with him in many field meetings of the Academy of Science, and have often marveled at his broad knowledge, not only of the plants and animals, but of rocks and soils, of topographical features, indeed, of all those factors which in any way modify life. He loved nature, and was very near to nature's heart. He sought eagerly after truth, and the truth to him was both incentive and reward. I am, perhaps, better entitled to speak concerning his work among plants. His knowledge was accurate and complete. He knew the whole life-history of the plants, recognizing them as seedlings or in leaf as readily as in flower. He knew the soil in which they grew, their insect visitors, and could tell the story of varying conditions of soil and air upon their growth. In my preparation of the flora of the state I have often appealed to him concerning some particular point and have received in return a response so full and accurate, so rich in detail, so replete with suggestive facts, that I have urged him to publish over his own name the facts that he so freely gave to others. Had he done nothing but what he has done in botany he would merit great honor from his fellow students of nature, but he did much more, for all life appealed to him, and all that affected life interested him, and as a reward for his great love, nature granted him many glimpses of her deeper truths. The scientists of Indiana mourn his loss because of his constantly increasing contributions to biology, but they mourn him more as a man, for all honored and respected him as one who stood 'four-square to every wind that blew.'\"\n\nThe superintendent of public instruction, D. M. Geeting, said: \"I have known Professor W. P. Shannon twenty-five years, and have been associated with him in many kinds of school work. He was an admirable companion and one of the warmest personal friends I have ever known. His demeanor was so quiet and unassuming that it took a long personal acquaintance to know the worth of the man. I feel that the educational work of the state has lost one of its most capable laborers, and his wise counsel will be missed in all educational gatherings. His work in science was regarded with much favor and his association with young people in such work has been a great inspiration to them in helping them to appreciate and understand nature's work around them.\"\n\nIn similar vein are epistles from Professor A. J. Bigney, who held the chair of natural science at Moore's Hill College; Charles R. Dryer, professor of geography in the Indiana State Normal; R. Ellsworth Call, superintendent of the Lawrenceburg schools; J. C. Gregg, superintendent of the Brazil city schools; Charles T. Powner, George L. Roberts and Mrs. Ida Wray, all of whom were connected with the public schools of Greensburg; and many others prominent in educational and scientific work throughout this state and the country at large. We cannot refrain from making one more quotation, this from the tribute of his friend and co-laborer, Professor Powner, as it gives the key to his unusually successful efforts in the development of the child mind, and the rare sympathy which he felt toward children: \"He was recognized by the pupils as their friend, and, as such, was approachable at all times. His office was visited daily by dozens of boys and girls carrying specimens from every field of nature. His invitations for walks through woods and fields were eagerly accepted, and he never tired of their questions nor their company. It was a frequent remark of his that children are the most acute of observers. It was this genuine faith in their abilities and in their work that secured for him their esteem. Having gained their friendship, it was an easy task to lead them into lines of good conduct. Through the friendship of the pupils he moulded their characters for future good.\"\n\nThrough constantly delving into the deep things of nature, Professor Shannon thus possessed a lofty humility of mind that acknowledged the fact that wisdom oft is hidden from the wise, when it is \"revealed unto babes.\" He was a honorary member of the American Archaeological & British Association, his opinions and views being received with respect and attention whenever he came before any of the various educational and scientific organizations to which he belonged. One of the happiest events of his life was the extended tour which he took through England, France, Switzerland and Italy, in 1881, but perhaps he enjoyed quite as much the frequent trips which he made to different parts of his own beloved land. In his youth Professor Shannon became identified with the United Presbyterian church, and later in life, he, with his estimable wife, joined the Presbyterian church of Greensburg. Here, as might have been expected of one so true and conscientious, he was a very active worker, and, as superintendent of the Sunday-school and at the head of the corps of teachers, the influence which he had for good cannot be calculated.\n\nIn the happy home circle he, nevertheless, was at his best, as is the case with all of the truly good and noble characters whose life records have been handed down to us. He first married Miss Nettie Wampler, a sister of Dr. Wampler, of Richmond, Indiana, their wedding being solemnized in June, 1875. She was a talented musician, and was a graduate of Glendale Female Seminary, of the class of 1869. A little daughter, who was named Nettie, for her mother, was born to the young couple. The musical genius which she inherited has been cultivated, and for some time she has made her home in Spring Hill, where she occupies an enviable position in society. Her young mother was taken from her soon after the daughter's birth, her death occurring in April, 1876.\n\nThe marriage of Professor Shannon and Miss Mary M., daughter of Dr. F. A. and Mrs. R. O. Hester, was celebrated June 29, 1887. Two daughters and a son-Willa, Tom and Marguerite-were born of this union. Mrs. Shannon's father, now seventy-seven years of age, was for a half century one of the most able and active workers in the southeastern Indiana conference of the Methodist Episcopal church. He is now on the superannuated list of that denomination, and with his wife, who though seventy-five, is still an active woman, is living in Greencastle, Indiana. Mrs. Shannon, who received an excellent education and was endowed by nature with rare qualities of mind and heart, was graduated in Moore's Hill College, in 1882. She was engaged in teaching until her marriage, and at present is one of the able and successful teachers in the Greensburg schools.[Source: \"A Genealogical and Biographical Record of Decatur County\", Lewis Publishing Co, 1900; Tr. by Mary Anne Wisterman]\n\nELIZABETH SHAFER SHERA\n\nThis estimable lady, who has spent the largest part of her life in Decatur county, is the widow of Caleb Shera, who was a prominent and wealthy farmer of that county. Mr. Shera was born in Ireland in May, 1809, and when twenty-four years old he came with his father, his mother having previously died, to America, settling at first in Benton county, Ohio. On December 21, 1837, he was married to Elizabeth Shafer, and in 1838 removed to Decatur county. He entered land in Jackson township, but subsequently sold a part of it, on which the town of Sardinia now stands. He improved a farm on the remainder, on which he made his home, one-quarter of a mile south of Sardinia, where he spent the remainder of his life, dying there October 30, 1879. He carried on general farming, and was also extensively engaged in raising cattle and hogs for the market. He added from time to time to his property until he was the owner of nearly six hundred acres in Decatur county, besides a considerable amount of land in Boone county. He was successful in all his business operations, and at his death left a large estate to his wife and children.\n\nMr. Shera did much to develop the township in which he lived, in the way of clearing up land, remodeling farms and bringing them to a high state of productiveness, while his influence was always brought to bear on the side of educational and religious progress. He was a consistent member of the Methodist Episcopal church, active in its work, liberal in its support and a constant attendant in its services. He filled many of its offices, and in his life carried out the precepts of the Master whom he so faithfully served, thereby securing the love and esteem of all who knew him.\n\nMrs. Shera was born in Franklin county, Indiana. February 16, 1818, and is a daughter of John and Catherine (Whitman) Shafer. Her grandfather, also named John, was among the earliest pioneers of Franklin county, and there reared a large and interesting family, many of whom are still residing there. The father of Mrs. Shera spent his entire life in that county, where he brought up a family of eleven children, namely: Jacob, who lives in Greensburg, Indiana; John, deceased, who was a local preacher living in Decatur county; Daniel, deceased, who was an exhorter residing in Indiana;. Elizabeth, our subject, is next in order of birth; David, deceased, who was a farmer of this state; James, deceased, who was a resident of Madison county; Jesse, a farmer of Illinois; William, deceased, who also was an Illinois farmer; Isaac, a farmer also of that state; Mary Ann, who is now Mrs. Wardwell and living in Madison county; and Joseph, a wealthy resident of Franklin county.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Shera were also blessed with eleven children, as follows: John W., who died September 20, 1880; Catharine, residing with her mother in Sardinia; William, who died while a soldier in the civil war; James, an ex-soldier and a farmer living in Boone county, Indiana; Mary E., who died in May, 1850; Thomas, living in Boone county, Indiana; Isaac, a farmer in Decatur county; Martha Ann, who became the wife of Mr. Wadkins, and lives in Kansas; Wilson, a farmer: Sylvester, who resides in Kansas; and Isabel, who died June 16, 1875. Besides rearing this large family Mrs. Shera took an orphan niece, Effie, when only seven months old, who grew to womanhood and had just completed her education at Oxford College when she died, November 21, 1891. All of the children in this family are highly educated, some of them being graduates of Morris Hill College.\n\nMrs. Shera is a woman of strong character and was of great assistance to her husband during their early life in a new state. She has seen the country develop from boundless forests and long stretches of wild land, uninhabited save by the deer, wolf and other animals which disappear as civilization advances, to smiling fields and bounteous orchards, or to prosperous cities filled with pleasant homes. She has fulfilled the Scriptural injunction to \"do with thy might what thy hands find to do,\" and, like the perfect woman of whom Solomon sings, \"her children rise up and call her blessed.\" Mrs. Shera has always been highly esteemed by those who knew her best, all of whom unite in the wish that her last days may be her best days.

SHIRK\n\nAn honored member of a well-known pioneer family, Mr. Shirk, is a valued citizen of the vicinity of Waynesburg, Indiana, where he has resided for many years. He was born in Franklin county, Indiana, May 18, 1837. His parents, Job S. and Mary (Matthews) Shirk, were both born in Franklin county, Indiana, where they were married. Job was the son of Andrew Shirk, who was of Swiss descent, and was a pioneer settler in Franklin county. Andrew's father belonged to the sect of Mennonites, and was opposed to war, but his son was very anxious to enlist in the colonial army and finally left home without his parent's knowledge, and served during the entire Revolutionary war. When it was over he settled in North Carolina, afterward making his way to Indiana, and was one of the pioneers of Franklin county. His son Andrew was a soldier in the war of 1812, and the remainder of his life was spent in farming. His children are mentioned as follows: Andrew and Isaac, neither of whom ever married; Job, father of our subject; Martha, Mrs. C. Craven; Rhoda, Mrs. M. Rudd; Elizabeth, Mrs. M. Wallace; Rachel. Mrs. Jesse Shafer; and Rebecca, Mrs. J. Wynn.\n\nJob S. Shirk grew to manhood and married in Franklin county, and lived on the homestead there until 1839, when he moved to Decatur county and bought the tract of land on which his son Thomas now lives. At that time there was only a log cabin on the place and a few acres had been partially cleared. There were very few settlers in Jackson township, and there were but two families within visiting distance. Many hardships and privations were endured before the wild land was converted into fields of grain, or blooming orchards; but men in those days were strong and brave of heart, and allowed no obstacles to prevent the accomplishment of the tasks to which they set themselves. By degrees the land was improved, more acres were added, and at the time of his death Mr. Shirk was able to leave a good home to each of his children. He was fond of recounting incidents of his pioneer life when there was a plenty of wild game to be had for the shooting, when there were no roads, and only an Indian trail by which to find one's way through the boundless forests, and when the grain had to be carried on horseback for long distances to be ground before the good housewife could have flour and meal for the bread. The people of to-day are reaping the benefits of all this labor and endurance, and no honor is too great to pay to the memory of the men and women who settled this great western country.\n\nMr. Shirk was a general farmer and also raised stock, which he drove to Cincinnati for market. He also did much for his community in this way, buying stock for the other families and furnishing the money for this purpose when they could not raise it. He was an enterprising man, and very successful in his business affairs. In early life lie was a Whig and later joined the Republican party. He served as township trustee and as justice of the peace. He took a deep interest in the success of the civil war and supported the Union cause by all the means in his power, giving two of his sons to fight the battles of their country, both of whom lost their lives. While on a visit to his old home in Franklin county in 1844, Mr. Shirk united with the Big Cedar Baptist church, being baptized by the Rev. Joab Stout. On his return home he became a member of the Dry Fork Baptist church, four miles from his farm, and during the existence of that church, as well as when afterward his church home was with the Mount Arie Baptist church denomination at Letts' Corner, he took an active interest in all church work, and held the offices of deacon and clerk.\n\nJob Shirk was married August 18, 1836, to Mary L. Matthews, who died April 11, 1863. She was the daughter of Thomas Matthews, a farmer of Franklin county. Her brothers and sisters were: Minerva, Mrs. G. M. Fieber; Melinda, Mrs. William Howell; George and Jones. Mr. and Mrs. Shirk were the parents of seven children, as follows: Thomas A., whose name heads this sketch; George, who was a soldier in the civil war and was for a long time confined in the terrible Andersonville prison, from which he was transferred to Florence, South Carolina, and died while still a prisoner; Joab, a soldier in the same war, who was killed in battle at Port Republic. Virginia; Melinda, who married J. M. Proctor for her first husband, L. P. Herod for her second, and is now the wife of W. W. Lowe, of Indianapolis; Samuel, who married Miss Emma Clendenning and resides in Indianapolis; Minerva, who married George Gilchrist; and Rhoda E., deceased, who was the wife of William Kennedy. Mr. Job Shirk was a good neighbor, a kind husband and father, and a man respected by all who knew him.\n\nThomas A. Shirk was reared to manhood on his father's farm, which is now his own property. His education was limited to the primitive schooling of those days, but he used every opportunity to put to a practical use all the knowledge he obtained and became a well informed man, who has made a success of life. During his youth and early manhood Mr. Shirk assisted his father in the management of the farm, which included the care of stock, and he pursued his daily routine of duties without troubling himself about the affairs of state. But in 1861 the cry \"To arms\" sounded throughout the land, and with hundreds of young men the farmer boy threw down his implements of labor and hastened to offer his services in defense of the stars and stripes. In September, 1861, he enlisted, at Lawrenceburg, in Company H, Thirty-seventh Indiana Volunteers, which was assigned to the Fourteenth Army Corps, under command of \"Pap\" Thomas. He saw hard service in many battles, was several times slightly wounded, and attained the rank of sergeant. He participated in the battles of Stone River, Tullahoma, Tunnel Hill, Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge, Buzzards' Roost, Lovejoy Station and smaller affairs, and went through the Atlanta campaign. In October, 1864, he returned to Indianapolis, where he was honorably discharged. He then returned to his home and resumed farming.\n\nIn 1865 Mr. Shirk was married to Miss Mary E. Fulton, and settled on a portion of the home farm. The following year his father built a new house, and the two families lived together until the death of the parent, when, by the terms of his will, the land was divided and our subject became the owner of the homestead and buildings, where he has continued to reside. In addition to this he owns another good farm near by, four hundred and forty acres in all, of well improved land. He was the executor of his father's will and carried out his plans and wishes in regard to the property. He has also been the executor of wills for many other people, has been administrator and trustee of a number of estates, and has been appointed guardian of both old and young. He has the reputation of being an upright, honorable man, of good judgment and practical knowledge in business affairs, and stands high in his community. In politics he has always been a Republican, influential in his party, but never aspiring to office. He is enterprising and public-spirited, and has earned the respect of all who know him.\n\nMr. Shirk's first wife was born January 21. 1843, and died August 31, 1872, when only twenty-nine years old. She was the mother of two children, Mary E. and Martha S., the latter dying when three years of age. Mrs. Shirk was a consistent member of the Methodist church. Her parents were William and Susanna R. Fulton, who were natives of Shelby county, Kentucky, but on account of slavery they left that state and came to Decatur county at a very early day. They first located at Greensburg, but later entered land in Jackson township and improved a farm there on which the father died in 1853. It was said that he was the neatest and most systematic farmer in the township, as well as one of the heaviest taxpayers. He was a consistent member of the Methodist church and took an active part in its affairs. Politically he was a Whig, but never aspired to office. The children in the Fulton family were Catherine, Mrs. J. Keisling; Eliza J., Mrs. S. McCullough; Paulina, Mrs. J. Morrow; Martha, Mrs. G. Laugh; Mary E., wife of our subject; America, deceased; and Samuel David, who resides on the old homestead.\n\nMr. Shirk was again married, December 18, 1877, his second wife being Mrs. Euphamia J. Byers, a widow with one son. She was born December 28, 1846, and was the daughter of Robert and Pamelia (Anderson) Braden, of Kentucky. Her father was the son of James Braden, a native of the Emerald Isle, who emigrated to America and first took up his residence in Kentucky. He came to Decatur county among the first settlers and located near Clarksburg, where he entered land and carried on farming until his death. He and his family were strong in their anti-slavery sentiments. The family comprised nine children: Rebecca, Jane, Mary, Jackson, Walter, William, Richard, Robert and John.\n\nRobert Braden was nine years old when his father came to Decatur county, and spent all his life upon the farm, which he purchased when old enough, and brought it under a fine state of cultivation. He carried on general farming, also stock-raising to some extent, and was very successful. To all the worthy poor he has been charitable and never turned the needy from his door. He was a member of the Christian church, and lived up to a high standard in all his dealings with his fellow men, thereby securing the confidence and respect of all who knew him. He was a Republican in his political views, but did not care for office. He died December 9, 1888, at the age of seventy-four years. Mrs. Braden resides with her son Jeremy in Greensburg. Her other children are: Joseph, who lives in Rossville, Illinois; Euphamia J., wife of our subject; Jeremy and Luther D. The father of Mrs. Braden, Joseph Anderson, was the first settler in Posey township, Franklin county, Indiana, and the town of Andersonville was named in his honor. He kept a country tavern, which was popular and well known throughout that section and was the starting point of Andersonville. Mr. and Mrs. Shirk have no children, but Edgar A. Byers, Mrs. Shirk's son by her first marriage, and Mary E. Shirk, Mr. Shirk's daughter by his former marriage, have been reared by them. Edgar A. Byers was born February 27, 1865, and now has the management of his mother's home farm. He was married April 21, 1890, to Louisa Miers, daughter of Evan Miers, a farmer of Decatur county, and they have one child, Howard T, born June 17, 1897. Mr. Shirk is a member of the Baptist church, while his wife belongs to the Christian church, but they are of one mind in their efforts to do all the good they can and to make the best of life.

SHOEMAKER\n\nAmong the well known business men of Greensburg is the gentleman whose name heads this sketch, and who is at the present time treasurer of Decatur county. He is the son of Peter and Margaret (Seitz) Shoemaker, and was born in Brookville, Franklin county, Indiana, December 30, 1860. He came to Greensburg with his parents when a boy of eight years and was educated in the public schools of that city. When sixteen years old he entered the dry-goods house of the late J. P. Hittle, where he remained for one year, and then went to Cincinnati. Finding employment with a reliable firm he learned bookkeeping in a practical way, and seven months later returned to Greensburg, where he took the position of bookkeeper with John Emmert and later with Emmert & Company, and remained with them until 1892.\n\nIn the spring of 1894 Mr. Shoemaker received an appointment as United States storekeeper in the sixth collection district of Indiana. After serving five months in that capacity he was promoted a deputy, under the collector, Captain W. H. Bracken, of Brookville. Six months later he resigned to accept the position of bookkeeper in the first National Bank of Greensburg, afterward being promoted to assistant cashier. Soon afterward the bank suspended payment and went into voluntary liquidation, and Mr. Shoemaker was made cashier to close up the business. Resigning this position, July 1, 1898, he took up bookkeeping again, being employed by the Garland Milling Company.\n\nMr. Shoemaker has always been an active and influential Democrat, and in November, 1898, he was elected county treasurer, by a majority of one hundred and twenty-two, the usual Republican majority in the county being three hundred and fifty. His term of office is for two years, beginning with January 1, 1900. Socially our subject is a member of Greensburg Lodge, No. 103, I.O.O.F. and Sexton Encampment, No. 42, I. O. O. F. He is a director in the Greensburg Building & Loan Association. He is well and favorably known in business circles.\n\nPeter Shoemaker, father of our subject, was born at Hessen, Hamburg, near the river Rhine, September 12, 1829. His parents were Jacob and Anna (Gerhart) Shoemaker, the former a farmer in good circumstances who spent the greater part of his life at Jeekenbach by Meisenheim, Germany, where he died at the age of eighty-six years. He was a consistent member of the Lutheran church. There were five children in the family, two sons and four daughters, three of whom are now living: Jacob, residing in Franklin county, Indiana; Mrs. Sarah McGregor, of Cincinnati, and Peter. The latter was for nine years a student in the excellent schools of his native land, and acquired a thorough education. He remained at home, assisting his father upon the farm, until reaching his majority, when in accordance with the military laws of Germany, he was drafted into the army. His brother Jacob had already served six years and had taken part in the German and Danish war. The draft was made in November, 1851, and finding that the younger brother would be called into active service the following April, the young men decided to emigrate to America, the \"land of the free.\" Bidding adieu to the loved ones at home they traveled across the country to \"Bingen on the Rhine,\" and went aboard a ship sailing to Havre, France. At this port they secured passports, and on November 27, 1851, set sail for the New World, landing in New York city January 21, 1852, after a long and tiresome voyage.\n\nFrom New York the brothers found their way to Brookville, Indiana, where Jacob settled permanently and now lives retired. Peter secured work on a farm for four months, and then assisted in building a bridge over the Whitewater river. His next job was on the Whitewater canal, and three months later he was made captain, holding the place for a year, when the owner of the boat sold it, and Mr. Shoemaker returned to Richmond, Indiana. For the following two years he drove an omnibus at that place, and then worked for a year and a half on the farm near by. He soon afterward went to Brookville for a short time and while there made the acquaintance of Margaret A. Seitz, of Lawrenceburg, Indiana, to whom he was married April 9, 1858.\n\nMr. Shoemaker then decided to begin farming on his own account, near Laurel, Franklin county. He remained here until 1868, when he removed to Greensburg and entered the employ of his brother-in-law, John Emmert (now deceased), who for many years operated a large flouring mill and elevator. His connection with this concern lasted for twenty-three years, or until 1891, when, on account of impaired health he was obliged to give up active work. His wife died February 18, 1890, at the age of fifty one years. Their only child is George P., who name heads this sketch.\n\nMr. Shoemaker was confirmed in the Lutheran church of his native city when only fourteen years of age, but after coming to America united with the Presbyterian church. He is proud of the free institutions of his adopted county and is one of its most loyal citizens.[Source: \"A Genealogical and Biographical Record of Decatur County\", Lewis Publishing Co, 1900; Tr. by Mary Anne Wisterman]\n\nWILLIAM SMITH\n\nAmong the prominent settlers of Decatur County Mr. Smith is one of the oldest, and he has been an important factor in the development of Jackson township. He is now a resident of Sardinia and is one of its most honored and venerated citizens. He was born in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, December 3, 1812, and was reared on his father's farm, obtaining a limited education in the primitive schools of his day, but put to a practical use all the information gained from observation and experience. His parents were Samuel and Letitia (Updike) Smith, natives of New Jersey, the story of whose pioneer hardships will be told later in this sketch.\n\nWilliam Smith remained under the parental roof until he was of age and was his father's principal assistant in improving his farm and making a start in the new country. When twenty-one years old he married and building a cabin on a portion of the homestead, he lived in this primitive dwelling for five years. He worked early and late, saved his earnings, and entered land in Bickford County, Indiana, seven miles from the nearest settler. He never moved on to his property, however, but subsequently bought forty acres of land in Jackson township, Decatur County, and in March 1840, came here to live. At that time there was a cabin built in a clearing of four acres, or rather it was a partial clearing, with a large amount of big timber still standing. This he cut, and then cleared three acres more, on which he set out an orchard. He planted the seven acres in com, and raised a crop the first spring, the only help he had being that of his faithful wife, who assisted in piling up the brush ready for burning. Prosperity rewarded the efforts of the sturdy young farmer, and it was not long until he was able to add forty acres more to the original forty, and so he kept on until he had one hundred and sixty acres under cultivation. Subsequently he purchased another farm, of eighty acres, and for many years carried on general farming, as well as stock raising. His aim in life has always been to make his way by hard work and fair dealing, and the success which he has attained may be traced to the following out of this principle. After acquiring a handsome competency, Mr. Smith, about 1886, bought a comfortable house with ample grounds, in Sardinia, and there he and his esteemed companion are passing the evening of their lives in quiet domestic happiness, with the consciousness of many well spent years behind them, and the hope of a blissful future. For fifty years they have been members of the Methodist church of which Mr. Smith is a trustee. Originally an old-line Whig, Mr. Smith naturally affiliated with the Republican party on its formation in 1856, and he still takes an active interest in all questions of the day and uses his influence in securing the best men for official positions.\n\nMr. Smith was married in March 1834, to Miss Delilah Smith, who, although of the same name, was no relative. She was born in Butler County, Ohio, but was reared in Franklin County, Indiana. Her parents were David and Margaret (Crooks) Smith, the former of German descent and a native of Pennsylvania, and the latter born in Kentucky. They were married in Ohio, and later Mr. Smith entered land in Franklin County, Indiana, on which he settled and which he improved, and there he successfully carried on general farming until his death. Before leaving Pennsylvania Mr., Smith was captain of a keelboat on the Susquehanna River, and the title clung to him, so that all the rest of his life he was known as Captain Smith. His wife was a devout member of the Methodist church, and both were highly respected wherever they were known. Their children were as follows: Delilah, wife of our subject; Jane, Mrs. Wallace; William C., deceased; Amy, Mrs. Updike; Monroe, living in Missouri; Margaret, Mrs. J. Webb; Milton, deceased, and Louisa, Mrs. Masters, residing in Brookville, Indiana. To Mr. and Mrs. William Smith eight children have been born, as follows: Samuel, a farmer in Jackson township, Decatur County; Ellen married R. Thompson, and both are deceased; David, living in California; Margaret, Mrs. Joab Stout, living in Letts, Indiana; Drusilla, Mrs. Seth Shepardson; John, deceased; Amanda, who resides with her parents; and Katie, Mrs. M. R. Fremain.\n\nSamuel Smith, father of our subject, was a son of Thaddeus Smith. The latter was of German descent and was a soldier in the Revolutionary war. Late in life he came from New Jersey to Indiana and spent the rest of his days among his children, dying at the good old age of one hundred years. His family comprised seven children, as follows: Eli; Zophar; Benjamin; Samuel; Nancy, who married Peter Updike; Sophie, who became the wife of Anthony Abel, and Eliza, wife of John Rogers. Samuel was married to Letitia Updike in Pennsylvania, where William, their eldest child was born in 1817, in company with a few neighbors, Samuel Smith built a flat-boat, in which, with their families, they found their way to Cincinnati. From that city Mr. Smith went to Franklin County, Indiana, where he leased some land and improved a farm. He also worked at his trade of wheelwright, making spinning wheels, and by every means strove to make a living in the wilds of the new state where he had selected a home. How many hardships and privations the early comers of those days endured, we, of the nineteenth century, have but little idea. There were trees to fell and brush to clear away before the little log cabin could be built; every necessary of life had to be hauled over miserable roads for many miles; neighbors were few and far between, the nearest often being ten miles away; and there were no amusements nor recreations, and no opportunity for gaining knowledge or religious instruction, except for the rare visits of the itinerant preachers. Life was, according to Mr. Mantilini, \"one demnition grind,\" and yet those courageous men and women bore their burdens cheerfully for the sake of making a home for themselves and their children, and even managed to extract some humor from the incidents which sometimes occurred.\n\nMr. Smith often tells with amusement the story of one episode of his struggle at this time. Adjoining the land which he leased was a tract of sixty acres of swamp land, of which the owner was anxious to be rid. He finally persuaded Mr. Smith to take it at three hundred dollars, securing his note for the same, at long-time payments. These were not kept up, and finally when all the notes became due the man pressed Mr. Smith for payment. The latter had no money, but he had built a log stable and cleared a few acres, and he offered to take nothing for the improvements if the man would take the land back. This the owner refused to do, but offered to make a trade, which was concluded by Mr. Smith giving him a mare and colt valued at one hundred and eighty dollars, a saddle, some harness, a quantity of cloth which his wife had woven, for all of which he charged good prices, and, in addition, his fur cap. He took up his notes and now owned the land, but had nothing else, not even a cap to wear. However, he managed to get along, and later bought a one-eyed horse for forty dollars, contriving to make a bridle out of a rope and a saddle out of straw stuffed into a bag. Success was bound to crown the efforts of a man of such perseverance, industry, and resources, and with a brave heart, cheered by the companionship and help of his no less brave wife, he surmounted all obstacles, and lived to see the wilderness turned into a beautiful land and to enjoy an old age of ease and comfort. He died at the age of sixty-five years, his wife surviving him, and she passed away at the age of eighty-six years.\n\nMrs. Smith's father, Isaac Updike, who was a native of Pennsylvania, had preceded Mr. Smith to Indiana by a few years, and had purchased and improved a farm in Franklin County, where he died when sixty years old. He became well known and was an honored citizen, respected by all who knew him. He and his wife were consistent members of the Baptist church. They had four children, Betsey, Mrs. Abram Smalley, of Franklin County; Peter and Elijah, both deceased; and Letitia, mother of William Smith, the subject of this sketch. All of these families are worthy of mention in a historical work of this kind, for it is to such men and women, who developed its resources and labored for its improvement, that Indiana owes her proud position in the galaxy of states.

Paul Stewart is the able and beloved pastor of the Spring Hill United Presbyterian church, one of the pioneer churches of Decatur county. Thoroughly consecrated to the noble work of uplifting humanity to a higher plane of living and purpose, he possesses the enthusiasm and spirit of a man in his early prime, while, at the same time practical experience and a rare power of insight and observation keep him from falling into the errors of judgment and the mistaken zeal with which too many young ministers are animated. He is eloquent in his presentation of the truth, and is fearless in the denouncement of evil, thus commanding the respect of every one, regardless of doctrinal differences.\n\nFugit township is fortunate in having two such efficient workers in the cause of Christianity as the Rev. Paul Stewart and the Rev. Robert A. Bartlett, both of whom were born in the closing year of the great war of the Rebellion, and both of whom are natives of the proud state of Ohio. Our subject's birthplace was in Xenia, his father, Dr. Robert Stewart, being a well known and very successful physician of that thriving town for many years.\n\nThe boyhood of Rev. Paul Stewart was quietly spent in his native town, where he was a pupil in the public schools and laid the foundations of the broad education which he later acquired. It was then his privilege to pursue higher branches of learning in Westminster College, at New Wilmington, Pennsylvania, where he was graduated in 1889, and finally to take a course at the Xenia Theological Seminary. In the latter well known institution he was graduated in the class of 1892, and thus, after much preparation, found himself at last on the threshhold of his chosen vocation.\n\nThe first charge of the young minister was at Washburn, Illinois, where he remained for a period of four years, from the time of his graduation until 1896. His earnestness and true manliness of character were felt in the community, and it was a matter of deep regret to the members of his devoted congregation there when he announced his decision to leave them for another pastorate. Three years ago, in 1896, he assumed the charge which he now holds,\" and, needless to say, he has won the love not only of the people whom he serves, but also of the general public. He possesses that liberal, loving spirit of the times, which is as far removed from the old sectarian dogmatism of, say, even a half-century ago, as is the true spirit of Christianity from Pharaseeism. His genial, sunny nature, and his ready sympathy for the unfortunate and sorrowing, make his presence a joy to every one; and when he beholds the power for good which he is enabled to see in this community he must, indeed, feel that \"his lines are cast in pleasant places,\" and that his efforts are being blessed.\n\nThe happy home of the young pastor is presided over by his amiable, helpful wife, formerly Miss Anna Mary Currie, of Xenia, Ohio. Their marriage was solemnized immediately after his graduation, May 10, 1892. They have two children, named respectively, Robert Currie and Martha.\n\nA brief sketch of the Spring Hill United Presbyterian church, over which Mr. Stewart presides as pastor, will prove of interest to many. Organized July 30, 1825, under the guidance of the Rev. David McDill, D. D., and the jurisdiction of the Associate Reformed church, it assumed the present title after the union of the Associate and the Associate Reformed churches, in 1858. Its difference in principle from the regular Presbyterian churches of to-day is very slight, opposition to secret societies, and the exclusive use of a metrical version of the Psalms of David being the chief points of variance. The first pastor of the church was the Rev. James Worth, a native of New Jersey. He was ordained to the ministry here in June, 1830, and for twenty-two years served this church. Then, going to Oregon, he spent the remainder of his life there, his ministerial labors being finished by his death, in July, 1881. From May, 1852, until September, 1867, the Rev. J. R. Walker, a native of Dublin, Ireland, occupied this pulpit, and under his ministry, the membership was greatly increased and every department of the church work flourished. The next pastor, Rev. S. Taggart, a brilliant and highly gifted man, remained but five months, when he was forced to resign on account' of poor health. His successor, the Rev. William Johnson, now deceased, made an efficient pastor during the six years of his stay as shepherd of this people. The next pastor, Rev. William M. Ritchie, remained here only two years, and was followed by the Rev. A. S. Vincent, D. D., a man of sterling Christian character, who labored in this field for a period of nine years. His work was substantial. Much beloved by all, he accomplished a great deal for his Master. He is now the pastor of the First United Presbyterian church of Emporia, Kansas.\n\nThe Rev. T. H. McMichael took charge of the congregation in 1890. A brilliant and attractive preacher, a man of great power, it was his privilege to do much for those who came in touch with him. During his brief pastorate an impetus was given to all branches of church work. The beautiful church in which the congregation worships was built during this time, at a cost of twelve thousand dollars. The Lord called him to a larger work, and in September. 1892, he resigned to take charge of the First United Presbyterian church of Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nThe Rev. H. H. Crawford was the next pastor. A man of very great ability, studious, attractive in the presentation of truth, he labored to the edification of the people. Ill health caused him to resign, in April, 1895, after serving the people most acceptably for a period of a year and a half; and he in turn was followed by the subject of this sketch, whose work is opening out before him with greater promise than ever before. [Source: \"A Genealogical and Biographical Record of Decatur County, Indiana\", The Lewis Publishing Co, Chicago; pub. 1900]\n\nSAMUEL M. STIMSON, D. D.\n\nThis eminent divine, one of the most active workers in the Baptist denomination, and well known throughout New York, Massachusetts, Indiana and many other states, passed to his rest, November 23, 1894, his death coming as a personal loss to his associates in the ministry, as well as to hundreds who knew him through his private work.\n\nRev. Samuel McElwain Stimson was born February 6, 1815, in Winchendon, Massachusetts, but during his boyhood accompanied his parents on their removal to Lockport, New York. He pursued his studies in an academy and afterward engaged in teaching for a number of years. He united with the Baptist church in 1835, was licensed to preach in 1840, and was ordained to the full work of the ministry by the Shelby church, in New York, in 1843. For half a century he was a preacher of the gospel and in 1890 celebrated the seventy-fifth anniversary of his birth, the fiftieth of his entrance into the ministry and the twenty-fifth of his residence in Indiana. During the twenty-five years of his ministry in the state of New York, he filled only three pastorates, those being at Binghamton, Batavia and Brighton. He was twice appointed pastor to the church at Batavia, being there eleven years in all, and severing his connection therewith in 1865 in order to accept the pastorate of the First Baptist church in Terre Haute, Indiana, where he remained for eight years.\n\nIn 1873 Dr. Stimson became district secretary of the Baptist Missionary Union, which position he continued to fill until 1893, - twenty years of active and earnest labor, in which his efforts resulted in great benefit to the society. In addition to his duties as secretary, Dr. Stimson made strenuous efforts to secure the million dollars needed for foreign missionary work, and this he considered the crowning effort of his life. He was remarkably successful in collecting money for this purpose, and it remains for the written history of the church to tell how his labors and the influences he set in motion have benefited and advanced the cause to which he so cheerfully gave his time and talents. He was an ardent advocate of evangelistic work and took especial pains to seek out and assist needy and discouraged churches. He was a man of strong faith, of a hopeful disposition and an untiring devotion to the cause of his Master, to whose service he consecrated the best of his life. At the time of his death he was pastor of the church at Downeyville and was busily at work until a few days before the final summons came; then he peacefully fell asleep, happy in the consciousness of an earthly life well spent, and in the hope of life eternal.\n\nFor many years Dr. Stimson was a prominent Mason, having attained the Royal Arch and Knight Templar degrees. In his early life he belonged to the state militia and was commissioned captain by Governor Clinton. His company was called out during the border wars with Canada and he rendered effective service to the country he loved.\n\nDr. Stimson was three times married, his first wife being Miss Louise Richardson, of New York. By this union three children were born, only one of whom is living. His second wife was Mrs. Jane Davis, of Terre Haute. In 1890 he was again married, Miss Eusebia Craven becoming his wife. She was born near Greensburg, Indiana, and was educated in the Baptist Institute of Indianapolis, being graduated in that institution in the class of 1866, at the completion of a four-years literary course. Subsequently she engaged in teaching for a short time. She has always been a prominent and active worker in the church, and has been secretary of the Woman's Baptist Missionary Society for the past twenty-three years. She is a lady of culture and refinement, has traveled extensively and devotes much of her time to doing good. Her husband found in her an able and willing helpmeet, and no one in the community is more esteemed or respected. She occupies a pleasant, old-fashioned home near Greensburg, surrounded by tall and stately trees, which Dr. Stimson named Cravinia Lodge, and in which his last years were passed in happy domestic relations.\n\nThe parents of Mrs. Stimson were prominent citizens of Greensburg, and a brief sketch of their lives will be of interest to the readers of this volume:\n\nHERMAN JAMES CRAVEN was born in Oxford, Ohio, December 10, 1815, his family being of English and Irish descent. Thomas Craven, the paternal grandfather, lived near Philadelphia in colonial days, and with his two sons took an active part in the Revolutionary war. Thomas Craven, one of his sons, was born near Philadelphia, found his way west and from Pittsburg floated down the Ohio river on a flatboat, landing at Cincinnati, then a small village. From there he went to Franklin county, Indiana, where he remained a short time, after which he entered and settled upon a farm near Oxford, Ohio. He had been for many years a teacher and preacher, and when forty-five years of age entered Miami University, completing the course of study five years later. Dr. Scott, the father-in-law of ex-President Benjamin Harrison, was at that time a professor in the university. In his early life Mr. Craven adhered to the faith of the Presbyterian church, but afterward united with the Baptist denomination, and to that church he devoted his earnest efforts for many years. He led a busy, useful life, being constantly engaged in doing good. He was an old-line Whig, with strong anti-slavery convictions, and the crowning act of his life was the founding of the Eleutherian College, in Jefferson county, Indiana, where students, without regard to race or color, could be educated together. He died at that place in 1860, when sixty-eight years of age. His wife was Rebecca Selfridge, and they had ten children.\n\nHERMAN J. CRAVEN, father of Mrs. Stimson, was reared upon his father's farm, near Oxford, Ohio, and when thirty years of age removed to Decatur county, Indiana, and purchased a farm of more than two hundred acres, one mile southeast of Greensburg, on the old historic pike. This land had few or no improvements, but with the thrift and industry which characterized his entire life Mr. Craven began the task of clearing and cultivating the place and continued his efforts until it became a productive and valuable farm. He began life without capital, but acquired a handsome fortune and became an influential and honored citizen. In those days the labor that devolved upon the farmer was much greater than it is at present, from the fact that there were no railroads and all products of the soil had to be hauled by teams to market; and the nearest market to Mr. Craven was Cincinnati.\n\nMr. Craven was very active in church work, both at Sand Creek and in Greensburg, where he served for many years as deacon and in other official positions. He was a leader in and liberal supporter of all religious and philanthropic movements in the neighborhood. Like his father, and indeed all the members of his family, he was a pronounced anti-slavery man and was one of the most willing workers on the \"underground railroad,\" a term scarcely understood by the present generation. By this arrangement slaves who escaped from their masters and were successful in reaching a free state were passed along at night from the home of one anti-slavery man to another until they could enter Canada, after which they were safe. It required a bold and courageous spirit to thus defy the law of the land and render oneself liable to its penalties by aiding the poor blacks; but Mr. Craven was fearless where right and duty to his fellow men were concerned, and many a poor, trembling fugitive had cause to bless him for his chance to become a free man. He did not live to see the downfall of slavery, his death occurring in 1856; but it was the never ceasing protest of such men as he that bore fruit in the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nMr. Craven was married to Nancy Martin, who was born in Hamilton county, Ohio, near Cincinnati, and they became the parents of five children, but all died before reaching maturity with the exception of Mrs. Stimson.

TALBOTT\n\nIt has fallen to the lot of very few men in the United States to serve the public as long or to have made such a highly creditable record as did Henry H. Talbott, deceased, formerly of Greensburg. Indeed, he is justly accredited as one of the prime factors in the founding of Decatur county, and to his wisdom and counsel was due much of its early prosperity.\n\nHe was of English ancestry, his father, Richard C. Talbott, Jr., and his grandfather, Richard C. Talbott, both having been born in England. The family, including the three or four children of the grandfather, emigrated to the United States prior to the Revolutionary war and located near Baltimore, Maryland. Richard C. Talbott, Jr., later proceeded westward, and for some years dwelt at Stanford, Kentucky, but spent his last years in Ripley county, Indiana, where he bought a farm and cultivated it until his death. He was the father of four sons and one daughter, to whom he gave as good advantages as was possible at that early day in the wilds of the Hoosier state.\n\nHenry H. Talbott, whose birth had occurred March 25, 1800, in Stanford, Kentucky, was a small lad when the family settled in Ripley county, and soon afterward he went to live with an uncle at Madison, the county-seat of Jefferson county, Indiana. That relative was then serving in the capacity of clerk of the courts of that county, and the nephew held the office of deputy for several years, thus becoming thoroughly familiar with the duties of a county clerk. This knowledge, as will be seen, was of great benefit to him thereafter. He came to Decatur county when it was naught but a dense forest, and the town of Greensburg unknown. In company with a few other pioneers, at Kingston, he took measures for the purpose of organizing this county; and as he was the only one present who was competent to draw up the papers in legal form setting forth the matter, he was chosen to perform that important duty. To him also fell the honor of being elected to serve as the first county clerk of the new county, and according to the old records he entered upon his duties as such as early as January 18, 1822, when he was less than twenty-two years of age. He so thoroughly won the esteem and admiration of his acquaintances that it was really impossible for any one to defeat him when it came election time, and for twenty-nine years he held the offices of both clerk and recorder. At the end of this period he was barred by a general state law from holding both offices and was continued as clerk eight additional years.\n\nThroughout his mature life he was a patriot in the truest sense, and, when the civil war broke out and the call for men to serve for three months was made, though he was sixty-one years of age, he offered himself to his country, and while he was not permitted to enlist in the ranks he was given a position as sutler. When his regiment participated in the battle of Philippi, he equipped himself with a gun and ammunition and went into the fray with his comrades. Politically he was originally a Whig and later a Republican. For many years he was successfully engaged in the livestock business, driving cattle to the markets of Madison and Lawrenceburg, and also to Cincinnati, this being prior to the construction of railroads in this locality. In later life he was one of the most earnest members of the Methodist Episcopal church, and died in the Christian faith when in the seventy-third year of his age, July 21. 1872, his death occurring at his old home in Greensburg.\n\nMr. Talbott survived his beloved wife several years, as she was summoned to her reward in September, 1860, when she had attained the age of sixty-one years, nine months and three days. In her maidenhood she bore the name of Eliza Hendricks, her father being Thomas Hendricks, formerly of Greensburg, Pennsylvania, but for years a citizen of this place. To the union of Mr. and Mrs. Talbott four sons and four daughters were born. Four are deceased, namely: Rachel, Sarah A., Richard C. and Thomas H. Drusilla G. is the eldest of the four who survive, and the youngest is Mrs. Mary E. King, of Indianapolis. Abram H. and Henry H. both reside in Greensburg.\n\nAbram H. Talbott, who is next to the youngest son of our subject, was born in this city, May 26, 1837, and was educated in the public schools here. At intervals, until 1856, he assisted his father in the county clerk's office, and about 1860 they entered into partnership, under the firm name of Talbott & Son, and conducted a hardware store for seven years. The father then selling his business, the young man obtained a position as a clerk, and continued to be thus employed until 1877, since which time he has been engaged in the drug business. Success has attended his efforts in the business world, and no one in Greensburg or vicinity enjoys more fully the confidence of the entire community. He owns a farm of one hundred and sixty acres, situated east of the city some three miles, and this place he supervises. Needless to say, Mr. Talbott is a stanch Republican, as was his father before him. He is quiet and unassuming in manner, and never has been ambitious to occupy public office. His chief interest centers in his home and business, though he never fails to discharge every duty devolving upon him as a citizen. His marriage to Miss Clara L. Armington was celebrated on the 19th of May, 1880, that date being the forty-third anniversary of his birth.

Preston Wallace Thomson, of Macomb, Illinois.]"
