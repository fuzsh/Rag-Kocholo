Rawlings has passed from our midst to that mysterious bourne from which no traveler returns. His earthly pilgrimage has ended; his pulse stilled by the chilly touch of death. We scarce can realize the solemn fact though we have stood beside and tearfully gazed upon his cold and lifeless form. He died on Tuesday last, at 11 o’clock, a.m.\n\n“Mr. Rawlings was born in Shawneetown, in this state, in the year 1827, and was therefore, at the time of his death, scarcely in the prime of life. At an early age he graduated at the Louisville Law College, and entered upon the practice of law in Southern Illinois. This country has ever been the field of his action since he obtained the years of maturity, and in that field he readily built himself up a name both as a citizen and professional man, universally regarded as among the first. He has occupied the position of editor, legislator, and state’s attorney—discharging the trusts of each position ably and satisfactorily, but his highest position has ever been in the affections of those who knew him. Endowed with social qualities of the highest order, with liberality almost boundless—a soul full of the noblest emotions that could animate a human heart, none knew but to love and admire him. We have ever been proud to recognize him as OUR friend and the ten years’ acquaintance we have enjoyed with him, has but proved that he was a friend indeed. If the hate of one soul followed him to his death bed, we know it not. Everywhere and by everybody he seemed loved—upon the affections of thousands he had a hold and in the memory of thousands, we can safely add, he will have a place through years and through ages.\n\n“A wife and little girl are left to feel most poignantly the great loss. May heaven soften their sorrows and breathe peace and hope and joy into their now desolate and riven hearts.”\n\nMr. Rawlings was one of the most prominent men of this town, and was referred to as the “founder” of the town. Many of the older citizens of Mound City will recall the Casey Mansion and the building that was used for a school house. Both of these he erected.\n\nThe Mounds Independent, Friday, 4 Feb 1938:\n\nYoung Matron Dies in St. Louis Hospital\n\nMrs. Clide Bernice Brown, age 29 years, wife of George Brown, passed away Thursday, January 27, at Barnes Hospital, following an operation early in the week.\n\nShe had resided in Mounds for the past five years and had been a devoted worker in the Methodist Church and Sunday school.

J. Biggerstaff, pioneer resident of Pulaski County and the first mayor of the City of Mounds, we learned a number of interesting facts about the communities of Villa Ridge, Mound City, and Mounds.\n\nMr. Biggerstaff was born September 2, 1858. His parents, Mr. and Mrs. William Biggerstaff, lived on a farm two and one-half miles west of Villa Ridge, which was then called Valley Forge.\n\nHis father was a large stock grower and at the time the Illinois Central Railroad was built through the county, furnished meat for the camp.\n\nHe recounted to us incidents that his mother had told him pertaining to the Illinois Central tracks. The deep cut at Villa Ridge was dug by hand shovels and the dirt was moved by means of wheelbarrows. The men working on the road lived in a sort of commissary camp. His father and mother were passengers on the first train that ran from Villa Ridge to Cairo.\n\nWhen W. J. was four years old, the family moved to Mound City. That was in 1862. His earliest recollection of this section of the country is that it was a “black oak swamp” populated with wild turkeys, also deer, coons and other animals sought by hunters. He remembers that during the Civil War a building in Mound City was called the Stokes House, was made into a hospital. Wounded soldiers were brought there by boat from battlefields in neighboring states and from those even more distant and there many of them breathed their last breath. The dead were also brought to Mound City and both those who died on the field of battle and those who were wounded in battle and died in this hospital were hauled to the cemetery, now known as the National Cemetery, on old ice barges put on wheels. The cabins of these barges were about 40 x 200 feet in size.\n\nDirt was taken from an Indian mound in Mound City and used to make a mud bridge over a road that led to Cairo. The road wound down to the mouth of Cache River, where Cache was crossed by ferry boat.\n\nThe first settlement near what is now Mounds was called Beechwood and was located where the Illinois Central spur to Mound City branches off from the main line. Beechwood became an incorporated village and Mr. Biggerstaff served on the village board and later on the council of the town of Mounds which was platted by Capt. N. B. Thistlewood, serving altogether for a term of about 20 years. He became an assistant car foreman for the Illinois Central and was an employee of that Railroad during the time of its greatest activity at this place where the Mounds yards held fifty tracks busy with switching engines hauling trains.\n\nHe was mayor when the Central Illinois Public Service Company was granted its first franchise. He was also a member of the Mounds school board for a number of years.\n\nMr. Biggerstaff tells us that forty years ago Mound City had twelve industries along its river front. He has lived to see many changes take place, some for the better, others for the worse, he no doubt believes.\n\nOn September 8, 1938, he will have rounded out 90 active, useful years. He has retained his faculties, is hale and active and continues as always to look on the bright side of life.—a mighty fine view for us all to take.\n\n(His marker in Beechwood Cemetery in Mounds reads: William James Biggerstaff 1856-1939.—Darrel Dexter)\n\nThe Mounds Independent, Friday, 11 Feb 1938:\n\nCharles Droge Dies Early Monday Morning\n\nCharles Droge, age 78 years, son of Henry and Magdalena Droge, was born in Cairo, Ill., Feb. 21, 1860, and died February 7, 1938, at 3 a.m. at his home near Mounds. In 1888 he was united in marriage to Miss Sahara Willard, this union being blessed with 2 sons, Ed, who has always resided with his parents, and Will, who lives west of Mounds.\n\nJan. 4, 1928, the family was bereaved by the loss of their dear mother, who was bed stricken five and one-half years.\n\nMr. Droge was a faithful servant unto his family, was of a quiet disposition, a hard-working citizen and a loving neighbor. He had resided near here for 55 years.\n\nHe leaves to mourn his loss two sons, three grandsons and one sister, Mrs. W. F. Gibson, of Cairo.\n\nFuneral services were held at the residence Wednesday afternoon at 2 o’clock, with interment in the Villa Ridge cemetery, G. A. James directing.\n\n(Charles Droge married Sarah Willard on 24 Dec 1889, in Alexander Co., Ill.

He professed a hope in Christ in 1920 during the pastorate of Rev. O. I. Banks and later joined the Missionary Baptist Church in Cache, Ill.\n\nHe lived a Christian life and was loved by all who knew him.\n\nSurviving him are: his widow, Mrs. Mary Moseby; a daughter, Mrs. Lula Brown; two sons, George and Richard; a brother, Mr. Elim Henderson; and a sister, Mrs. Alice Fields and many friends and relatives.\n\nHis age was 51 years, 6 months and 2 days.\n\nMound City Sued by Administrator of Estate\n\nA $10,000 damage suit naming the city of Mound City as defendant is on file in the office of Circuit Clerk Kenneth Robinson at Mound City. It is being brought by Virgil E. Chambliss, administrator of the estate of Roosevelt Simms, deceased, with Charles Rice, Cairo attorney, listed as legal counsel for the plaintiff, according to the Cairo Citizen.\n\nThe suit is an attempt to recover from the city for the death of Simms, a negro, who along with several other negroes, was drowned on January 27, 1937, between Mound City and Mounds when their boat capsized. Simms had been working on the Mound City levees during the high water and he and other negroes had taken to a boat when the fight to save Mound City was abandoned.\n\nIn the complaint on file it is claimed that on January 26, 1937, the day prior to Mound City’s inundation, the city entered into a contract with Roosevelt Simms by which Simms was to work as an employee of the city on the levees surrounding and protecting Mound City from overflow of flood waters. It is pointed out that the city was then endangered by water.\n\nIt is further claimed that Simms lived at Mounds and it was necessary for him to travel to and from work by boat. The city, according to the complaint, promised safe and adequate transportation to and from Mounds, Simms’ home, and his place of employment, Mound City.\n\nIt is further stated that Simms was carried to Mound City on January 27 to work by “agents and servants of the city of Mound City.” Later, it is claimed, on the return trip, the plaintiff city “negligently and wrongfully furnished and provided unsafe transportation.” The boat was “overcrowded by other employees” and “improperly and unskillfully managed and handled by agents and servants of the defendant city.” It is further claimed the boat overturned as a result of the overcrowding and unskilled handling with the result that Simms was thrown into the water and drowned.\n\nThe complaint asserts that the deceased is survived by a father, mother, John and Fannie Simms, five brothers and four sisters.\n\nThe sum of $10,000 is prayed for the reasons set out within the complaint.\n\nThe Pulaski Enterprise, Friday, 11 Feb 1938:\n\nCHARLES DROGE DIES\n\nCharles Droge, 78, died at his home four miles west of Mounds Monday morning following a short illness.\n\nHe was born in Cairo, but had lived in Mounds for the past 55 years.\n\nHe is survived by two sons, Edwin C. and William, both of Mounds; three grandsons; and one sister, Mrs. William Gibson of Cairo.\n\nFuneral services were held Wednesday at 2 p.m. at the residence. Rev. P. R. Glotfelty officiated.\n\nInterment was made in Villa Ridge cemetery.\n\nG. A. James was in charge of arrangements.\n\nMrs. Ethel McConnell, who was called here by illness and death of her mother, Mrs. William Smith, has returned to her home at Portland, Oregon.\n\nThe Pulaski Enterprise, Friday, 18 Feb 1938:\n\nBirths Exceeded Deaths in County 286 to 184\n\nThe stork is more sociable and makes more visits in this county than does Old Father Time with his reaping stick. Little bundles in swaddling clothes make their appearance more often in homes than does the funeral wreath that adorns the doorpost.\n\nThere were 268 to arrive last year while 184 died in the county. The year before, 1936, the score stood 315 births to 225 deaths.\n\nMounds is the place where people are born—and where they also die. There were 105 births in that town last year and 76 deaths. The year before there were 86 births and 76 deaths, so that the flood, if it did nothing else, brought a pickup in the stork business in Mounds in 1937.\n\nThe ratio of boys and girls is fairly equal, but the number of twins or triplets was not learned.\n\nDIED AT FULTON\n\nWord has been received in Mounds of the death of Mrs. Tom Parham, who died at her home in Fulton, Ky., Tuesday of this week.\n\nMrs. Parham was formerly of Mounds.\n\n(Her death certificate states that Mrs. T.

Galvin, a former pastor of the Mounds Congregational Church, which occurred February 2, at his home in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he has resided for a number of years. A letter from Mrs. Galvin to Mrs. R. W. Wiedenmann brought the news of his peaceful passing. His body was cremated, the final rites being performed in Cincinnati. Mrs. Galvin is left quite alone, as her relatives reside in Switzerland.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Galvin was pastor here for some time. He owned a home on South Delaware and for a short time had an interest in a newspaper here, the Mounds Leader. During the flood of 1927 he took many flood pictures, a number of which were put on postcards and sent to many far places. If we remember correctly, he and his wife left Mounds about the year 1928.\n\nMrs. Thomas Parham Dies at Home in Fulton\n\nMrs. Geraldine Parham, wife of Thomas Parham, died Tuesday, February 15, at her home, 110 Jackson Street, Fulton, Ky.

His mother had later told Mrs. Scanlin, who before her marriage to Thomas in 1887 was Alice Vick of Ullin, of the long and tiresome journey evidently traveled in part by rail, as she spoke of the seats in the cars being of plain boards and affording an uncomfortable place for her and her baby.\n\nIn the early 60s the family moved to Villa Ridge and a little later to Mound City, where Mr. Scanlin’s early boyhood was spent. His father died in 1864.\n\nHe recalls seeing the carloads of Union soldiers as they traveled from the northern part of Illinois to Cairo through what is now Mounds, but was then only the “Junction” where the Mound City branch of the Illinois Central diverges from the main line. They rode in box cars with long seats built along the sides and square holes cut for windows. There was a water tank here and the trains would stop for water. With boyish curiosity Mr. Scanlin would watch the prankish soldier boys clumber on top of the cars while the train stopped. On one occasion, he remembers seeing a flat car loaded with huge bales of hay, which had caught on fire. The entire contents of the water tank were poured on the hay, but to no avail. Cordwood, about two feet long, was used for fueling the engines and it was loaded on the tenders by man power.\n\nOn the left side of the “Junction” near where the sugar house now stands, was a large two-story house owned and occupied by William Burke, whose sister, a Mrs. Dwyer was his housekeeper. She had three sons, John, Charlies and Tom Dwyer with whom young Thomas played as a boy. There were a few smaller houses near that of Burke and the settlement was called “Burkeville.”\n\nLike Mr. Biggerstaff whom we quoted in a recent issue, Mr. Scanlin remembers the hospital in Mound City, standing on the bank of the Ohio, part of which is still in use as a canning factory. He is not quite clear as to whether this building, which was much larger then than it now is, was erected by the Emporium Company or by the Government. He too recalls that at a later time a hotel called the “Stokes House” occupied this same building.\n\nWilliam Burke had the contract to remove to the National Cemetery the remains of the soldiers, whom were killed on nearby battlefields and had hurriedly been buried in trenches or near where they fell. The bones were located by the use of iron hooks as thick as a man’s thumb and from four to five feet long, which were thrust in the ground here and there until they came in contact with a hard substance when digging began. Mr. Scanlin remembers having in his hands one such hook as its use was explained to the group of boys who were playmates. This may account, at least partially, for the large number of unknown dead buried in this cemetery—over half of the more than 5,000 now resting there.\n\nAfter their marriage, Mr. and Mrs. Scanlin settled in Ullin, where their sons, Frank and John Scanlin, were born and reared. Mr. Scanlin became a skilled sawyer and was in the employ of Bell’s Lumber Co. for more than 25 years. At one time he held a position with a company in Mound City that manufactured wooden pumps for wells and cisterns. This company is now known as the N. O. Nelson Mfg. Co., of St. Louis. Mound City at that time was a busy manufacturing town. That part of the town where the courthouse now stands was called “Stumptown,” and the part where the Marine Ways is located was designated as “Sleepy Hollow.”\n\nWhen asked to account for the names of the two towns, Mr. Scanlin told us of the many Indian mounds that were in this section in the early years, most of them having been leveled since. He recalls a large mound on what is now the Gardner farm south of Ullin, formerly called the Ben Anderson farm. A space of about an acre in size had yielded many articles such as flint arrow heads, etc. The supposition was that the depression containing the river Cache and the bottom land around it was the original bed of the Ohio River. Along the banks of Cache, all the way between Ullin and the mouth of the river were numerous Indian Mounds, one or two of which were within the confines of Mound City and remnants of which may still be seen.\n\nThe first Illinois Central agent at the Junction, whom he recalls, was Silas J. Moore, who later settled at Pulaski and whose descendants still live there. The station was but a shack at the side of the track and stood near the Junction.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Scanlin are comfortable and happy in their home at Ullin, with one son and his family living next door and the other living near Villa Ridge. They are able to enjoy the fruits of their labors in earlier years and have the respect and friendship of the entire community.\n\n(Thomas Scanlin married Alice Vick on 25 May 1887, in Pulaski Co., Ill.—Darrel Dexter)\n\nDangerous Prisoner at Chester Commits Suicide\n\nChester—One of the most brilliant and considered most dangerous for all inmates in Menard Prison voluntarily terminated his prison sentence last week by committing suicide. The inmate was Harold St. Clair, 35, a chemical engineer serving a 39-year sentence for the murder in June 1934, of Dr. Homer L. Meyers, wealthy Eldorado, Ill., dentist.

He had been beaten and killed, a broken jaw, broken nose, slashed throat, stabs in the chest and had been a victim of an operation for emasculation.\n\nAdditional things coming to light include the story of a plan to go to Mexico where he would secure a divorce from his wife and the “woman” would also secure a divorce from her husband. A Marion paper published this week, that a relative of Bratten, who had been interested in the case, had received warnings to cease his activities or severe penalties might be expected.\n\n(His World War I draft registration states that Arno Bratten was a teacher in Marion Township High School and lived at 527 E.

The man held for the killing is George Stout, 26, who said that he was attacked. However, before the attack, it seems that Cross and Stout’s sister had had some words. Stout maintained that Cross attacked him and that he was hit first. Witnesses testified that Stout jumped upon the head of Cross when he was down and threatened to whip anyone who interfered. Cross died an hour or so later.\n\n(His death certificate states that Fred George Cross, of Cairo, Ill., a Coca Cola bottler, was born 20 Mar 1899, in Barlow, Ky., the son of John S.
