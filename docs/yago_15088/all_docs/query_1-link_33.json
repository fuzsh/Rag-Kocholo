In recognition of this need, Federal, State, and local government agencies are issuing an increasing number of publications which inform vocational counselors and others about trends and developments which have implications for career decisions. This Guide was prepared to encourage the wider use of these materials. This bulletin was prepared by Gerard C. Smith, under the direction of Neal Rosenthal, in the Bureau’s Division of Manpower and Occupational Outlook. Joseph J. Rooney, Gary G. Rubenstein, and John M. Sumansky assisted in the research and writing of the bulletin. in CONTENTS Page In tro d u c tio n ............... . ................................................................................................ 1 A basic manpower boo k sh elf....................................................................................... 3 Occupational and industry manpower literature ...................................................... 4 National information ......................................................................................... 4 Occupational outlook service information ............................................ 4 Occupational Outlook H a n d b o o k ................................................. 4 Occupational outlook report s e rie s .............................................. 4 Occupational Outlook Q uarterly................................................... 9 Occupational outlook slide series ................................................. 10 Occupational outlook service — miscellaneous publications......................................................... 10 Occupational and industry manpower stu d ie s.......................................... 11 Occupational manpower s tu d ie s ...................................................... 11 Industry manpower s tu d ie s .............................................................. 17 State and local area inform ation........................................................................... 19 Job descriptions....................................................................................................... 21 Careers in the Federal G overnm ent...................................................................... 21 Federal Government jobs in the United States ....................................... 22 Federal Government jobs overseas ........................................................... 32 Education, financial assistance, and placement inform ation....................................... 34 Education, training, and retraining ...................................................................... 34 Financial assistance to students ........................................................................... 38 Job placement in fo rm a tio n .................................................................................. 40 Manpower problems and issues....................................................................................... 42 Defense expenditures and manpower needs ...................................................... 43 Depressed a r e a s ....................................................................................................... 45 Labor standards.................................................................................................... 46 Technological change ............................................................................................ 48 Worker mobility 50 ....................................................................................................

Consider, for example, the pace of technological change in recent years and its effect on job opportunities and job security. Hundreds of thousands of production jobs have disappeared in various regions, occupations, and industries. At the same time, new industries, products, and processes have generated employment opportunities-many of these in new occupations. Educational and training requirements have been raised across a broad range of occupations. Achievement of effective vocational and educational decisions is further complicated by the unusually large numbers of youths and women entering the labor force, and lingering high levels of unemployment among youth, older people, and minority group members. To meet the challenge, counselors must be informed on the major aspects of the Nation’s manpower trends. For example, they should be familiar with the changing job content of occupations; those occupations with excess workers and those with worker shortages; the new occupations resulting from technological change; and those with growing or shrinking employment opportunities. Commenting on the effectiveness of counselors without a full knowledge of occupations, an outstanding leader in the field of counseling points out that “the weak counselor pools his own ignorance of occupations with the ignorance of the client and from this shallow pool tries to help the client to select an appropriate occupation.” 1 A veritable storehouse of occupational and other manpower materials is published by government agencies—both Federal and State—which can help counselors and counselees to achieve the most effective vocational and educational decisions. These publications cover a wide range of subject matters including job descriptions, industry and occupation employment trends, changing occupational structure in industry, entry jobs, training requirements for specific occupations, and starting and managing a small business. Some publications include valuable bibliographies on subjects of particular interest to counselors. Much material published by State agencies deals with current and future occupational employment requirements in individual labor areas; or the duties and characteristics, qualifications required, employment prospects, and related information for individual occupations or groups of related occupations. The Counselor's Guide to Manpower Information previously published in 1964,2 is a selected bibliography of representative materials from all Federal and many State agencies from 1962 through early 1968. Emphasis is placed on the latest available published materials. In addition to the preceding separate publications which provide national information, many publications provide State and local area manpower information. State employment agencies affiliated with the U.S. Department of Labor publish much valuable information on occupations and employment opportunities in State and local areas. These State agencies prepare two principal types of studies—area skill surveys, which analyze current and future occupational requirements in individual labor areas; and occupational guides, which provide career information for individual occupations or groups of related occupations. State agencies also publish special manpower and labor market studies that deal with future manpower supply, characteristics of the work force, changes in State and area economic activity, and the employment structure of industries. 1Robert Hoppock, Occupational Information, 3d ed. (New York, McGraw-Hill Book Company, Inc., 1967), p. 134. 2See the Counselor's Guide to Occupational and Other Manpower Information: An Annotated Bibliography o f Selected Government Publications. U.S. Department of Labor (BLS Bulletin 1421, November 1964). 1 The Guide to Local Occupational Information, compiled by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Employment Security, lists local level occupational guides, occupational guidance publications, and area skill surveys. (See page 19.) No attempt was made to tap the vast field of private publications; counselors should consult the NVGA Bibliography o f Current Occupational Literature, 1966 Edition, published by the National Vocational Guidance Association. Use of the Guide For ease of finding publications pertaining to a specific subject, the Guide is divided into four basic sections: occupational and industry manpower literature; education, financial assistance, and placement information; manpower problems and issues; and special groups in the labor force. Introductions to each section identify the subject area and associated manpower problems. Where applicable, the section introductions describe governmental policies and programs related to them. Each section is divided into several sub-sections which focus on a specific subject. Annotated listings are presented on each subject in alphabetical order. The Guide also includes a section on basic statistics, available from government sources, that can be particularly useful to counselors; and a section on directories, catalogs, and bibliographies. Appendixes include helpful hints to counselors on how and where to order government publications. In citing Federal publications, abbreviations have been used to conserve space. These abbreviations indicate, in order of their appearance, (1) the name of the issuing department and (2) the agency (abbreviation in parentheses) to which requests for free publications may be directed. When agencies within a department are responsible for publications, they are listed immediately after the departmental abbreviation. Free publications may be obtained as long as supplies last. Virtually all priced publications may be ordered from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office. Federal agencies are listed alphabetically, by their abbreviations, in Appendix B, along with their addresses. (See also Appendixes A through E for information on how and where to order Federal publications.) Free State and local government publications may be requested from the agency whose name and address appear immediately following the publication title. Priced publications may be ordered from the organization whose name and address appear in parentheses. Publication citations in the Guide that are preceded by an asterisk are considered suitable for counselees and counselors to use. The titles of periodicals are italicized for ease in identification. Information on subscriptions to selected periodicals is provided in Appendix D. Many of the publications listed in the Guide are available free of charge; the others may be purchased. School and public libraries may be sources for some of these publications. Also, Federal depository libraries may be excellent for Government manpower information. (See Appendix E for list and explanation of Federal depository libraries.) 2 COUNSELOR'S 6UIDE TO OCCUPATIONAL AND OTHER MANPOWER INFORMATION A BASIC MANPOWER B O O K SH ELF Of the hundreds of useful government manpower publications cited in this bibliography, several should be on every counselor’s reference bookshelf because they are basic sources of comprehensive, practical, and up-to-date information. These selected, publications are identified briefly below with references to the pages in this bibliography where they are discussed. The Occupational Outlook Handbook is the most comprehensive source of occupational and industry career information available. Published every 2 years by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, it provides information on the nature of work, long-term employment outlook, and related topics for hundreds of occupations, and major industries. (See page 4.) The Occupational Outlook Report Series consists of individual reprints of statements published in the Occupational Outlook Handbook (119 for the 1968-69 edition). These reprints enable counselors to make occupation and industry information readily available to students interested in specific careers. (See page 4.) The Occupational Outlook Quarterly supplements the Handbook by presenting up-to-date occupational outlook and other timely manpower information. (See pages 9, 86.) The Dictionary o f Occupational Titles (D.O.T.) published by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Employment Security, is an encyclopedia of job definitions and related data. The 1965 edition of the D.O.T. contains information on about 22,000 jobs, of which about 6,000 are new to the D.O.T. since the previous 1949 edition. (See page 21.) The Handbook on Women Workers published every 2 years by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Women’s Bureau, is a sourcebook of facts on women’s employment, occupations, earnings, education, and related subjects. (See page 63.) The Manpower Report o f the President including a Report on Manpower Requirements, Resources, Utilization, and Training published annually by the U.S. Department of Labor is the Federal Government’s primary report on manpower problems. It discusses the many factors affecting manpower requirements, resources, utilization, and training. (See page 42.) Each major branch of the Armed Forces publishes a comprehensive career handbook and other helpful materials, which describe occupations and training programs for enlisted men. These publications include: U.S. Army Opportunities; U.S. Navy Occupational Handbook; U.S. Air Force Occupational Handbook; and Occupational Specialties, issued by the U.S. Marine Corps. (See pages 26, 27.) 3 O CCU PA TIO N A L AND IN D U ST R Y MANPOWER L IT E R A T U R E National Information The Federal Government is the main source of occupational and industry manpower information that is primarily national in scope. A representative sample of the increasing volume of publications incorporating such information is shown below. The subject matter is varied, but in general deals with careers in individual occupations, employment changes in industries, and education and training programs which lead to jobs in specific fields. O CCU PA TIO N A L O U TLO O K S E R V IC E IN FO RM ATION Occupational Outlook Handbook The Occupational Outlook Handbook, compiled by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, is a basic reference book of occupational information. The Handbook is based on information gathered from industry, labor organizations, trade organizations, trade associations, professional societies, Government agencies, and educational institutions. It draws upon an extensive program of research in industrial and occupational trends in the United States. The Handbook, first published in 1949 and every other year since 1957, is now in its eighth edition. It provides comprehensive information for approximately 700 occupations and 30 major industries describing their work, earnings potential, training and educational requirements, and outlook. It also discusses future trends and conditions which are likely to affect employment outlook in the decade ahead. The 1968-69 edition contains 765 pages with many illustrative photographs and charts. The Handbook and all other Occupational Outlook Service publications are available from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402, or from any of the eight regional offices of the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (See Appendix B, page 83 for addresses.)

These State agencies prepare two principal types of studies—area skill surveys and occupational guides. One or more such studies have been published by 50 State agencies since 1957. State agencies also publish special studies that deal with future manpower supply, characteristics of the work force, changes in State and area economics, and the employment structure of industries. Area skill surveys analyze current and future occupational requirements in individual labor areas. Survey data provide a basis for anticipating the occupational needs of area industry and estimating the supply of qualified manpower. Some specific topics covered by most area skill surveys are: The occupational composition of current employment, by sex and broad age groups; future occupational requirements—usually 2 to 5 years hence; current occupational supply and demand situations; the supply of workers expected to be trained over the forecast period; information on apprenticeship and other training programs; the number of workers in training; and employer opinion regarding the need for pre-employment or supplementary vocational training. Occupational guides contain information on job duties; employment prospects; working conditions; entry methods; advancement opportunities; hours and earnings; and education, training, and experience requirements for individual occupations or groups of related occupations. Occupations selected for analysis usually are those important to local industries, or those of interest to particular groups, such as young workers. Special manpower and labor area studies cover a wide variety of subjects, including: (1) manpower projections, (2) studies of State and area economics, (3) studies of labor force characteristics, e.g., age, sex, racial composition, and (4) industry analyses. Counselors should request lists and copies of published reports from the reports and analysis section of the individual State agencies. Also, the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Employment Security has two free publications designed to promote wider acquaintance with and increased utilization of labor information issued by State employment security agencies. These publications are: (1) Guide to Local Occupational Information, which lists occupational guides and area skill surveys issued by State agencies through mid 1966; and (2) Job Opportunities Information, which lists occupational guides and skill surveys currently in process. Examples of studies done by State employment security agencies are listed below: *ARIZONA OCCUPATIONAL BRIEFS. Arizona State Employment Service, Manpower Economics Section, Phoenix, Arizona 85005. 1967. 215 pp. Free.
