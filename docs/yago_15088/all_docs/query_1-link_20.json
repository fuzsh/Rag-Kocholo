George Spence of the tug Theseus and the following:\n\nThe above is a life-like portrait of Mrs. Rosa Mangrum for whose supposed murder at Nashville about two years ago Dr. Herman Feist of that city, is now under sentence of death and whose case on appeal will probably be heard in the Supreme Court this week.\n\nMrs. Mangrum was a daughter of Mr. J. E. Mason, of Hicksville, and was reared in Madison County, but since her marriage resided in Nashville. She mysteriously disappeared in that city on December 14, 1905, and nearly a month later her body was found floating in the Ohio River at Cairo, Ill.\n\nOn the day she disappeared she had drawn $1,500 from a bank in Nashville and is also supposed to have had from $1,200 to $1,500 worth of jewelry on her person. None of this property was found on her body, but there were evidences that she had been robbed. Various circumstances pointed out Dr. Feist as having been concerned in her disappearance and some months later grand jury of Davidson County brought in an indictment charging him with her murder and he was arrested and there was a sensational trial lasting several weeks resulting in the jury bringing in a verdict of murder in the first degree, and he was sentenced to be hanged.\n\nMrs. Florence Trousdale, of Birmingham, Ala., a younger sister of Mrs. Mangrum, was indefatigable in her search for her sister after her disappearance, and after the body was found did most of the detective work in solving the mystery and which resulted in the arrest and conviction of Dr. Feist.\n\nThe action to be taken by the supreme court in the case will be awaited with much interest, not only in Nashville, but here where the relatives and friends of the deceased reside.\n\nThe above is the first picture of Mrs. Mangrum that has appeared in any publication and as will be seen she was a very beautiful woman.\n\nIMPORTANT WITNESS FOR FORD DEAD\n\nNoel Whiteson, Bartender, Died of Heart Disease Saturday Night\n\nNoel Whiteson, better known as “Big Boy” on account of his size, dropped dead Saturday night in Gus Bourgois’ saloon of heart disease.

The operation was performed by a distinguished Chicago surgeon, Dr. Albert I. Bouffleur, the ailment being an old incarcerated hernia. While it was believed up to the last that the patient had chance to recover, his advanced age was against him and his system was unable to rally as it was hoped it would from the shock of the operation.\n\nCharles Feuchter, Sr., was born in Brachbach, province of Wurtenberg, Germany, on May 21, 1831. He was one of a family of three brothers and two sisters and only one still survives, Miss Kate Feuchter, who still lives in the old homestead in Germany.\n\nComing to America in 1854, a few years later he located in Cairo, where he has since resided. In June 1862, he was married to Miss Anna Schwanitz, who survives him with two sons, Charles and William Feuchter. The latter has been in California and on receiving word of the operation, started at once for home, arriving Wednesday afternoon in time to see his father before death came. He was conscious to the last.\n\nFor many years Mr. Feuchter conducted a brewery on Ninth Street, in the building now occupied by the power plant of the Traction Company. It was Cairo’s first brewery, and Mr. Feuchter put up the building. He also built the brick building at Ninth and Washington occupied by the Brewery Saloon. He acquired considerable property, including the home on Ninth Street. In his social life, he was a charter member of the Rough and Ready Fire Company, remaining as an active member until the company disbanded. He was also a charter member of the Cairo Casino.\n\nHe was one of the quiet unassuming, solid German citizens of which the Cairo of the early days had a large number.

They were evidently prisoners of war, and possibly they may have been brought up here mortally wounded, to die here in the hospital and to be buried in an unmarked grave.\n\nSometime ago Postmaster Sidney B. Miller received from William Elliott, who is at the head of the commission that is searching for these graves, a list of those who are supposed to have died in Cairo. He has no knowledge of them, and if there is any old citizen in Cairo who remembers anything about any of these soldiers, they can help the government find their graves by communicating with Mr. Miller. The list furnished Mr. Miller by the department is as follows:\n\nCathcart, W., private 7 Florida Regiment, died Nov. 9, 1862\n\nCarter, W. H., private, 43 Georgia, died Nov. 12, 1862\n\nMeadows, J.

W., 1 Florida regiment, died Nov. 4, 1862\n\nThompson, James, Marion Artillery, Florida, died Nov. 11, 1862\n\nIt will be noticed that these men all died during November 1862, and they were all members of Georgia and Florida regiments, so that it would appear that they must have been brought here wounded from an engagement somewhere in this vicinity in which these two regiments participated.\n\n(They are among the unknown Confederate soldiers buried at Mound City National Cemetery, according to the 21 Jan 1908, issue. W. W. H. Carter enlisted 10 Mar 1862, in Co. F, 43rd Georgia Infantry Confederate Army, and died 12 Nov 1862, at Vicksburg, Miss. John M. Meadows and James Thompson were privates in Capt.

She said that it was desired in connection with some legal matters. Records were not kept by the county clerk of marriage licenses in those days. In fact, no license was necessary. The certificate of marriage was recorded with the clerk sometimes, but it was not always returned for record, so the documentary proof of this marriage has not been found.\n\n(The information about county clerks not keeping marriage licenses is incorrect and marriage license were required by law.

T. Wilson, one of the best known dry goods men in the state, who shot himself at his home yesterday. The former stockholder in the Ely & Walker Dry Goods Company of St. Louis had been in business here for two years, and of late had contemplated opening the largest dry goods house in Southeast Missouri. Inability to consummate the plan because of illness is believed to have led him to fire the bullet through his brain. About 66 years of age, Mr. Wilson was active in business and all affairs which gained the attention of the Commercial Club of Cape Girardeau.\n\nLast Thursday night he was installed as president, after a unanimous election.

He was 77 years of age and was a native of England. He was reared in an orphan asylum and never knew his parents, so that so far as he knew he had no living relatives. It was in England that he learned his trade, and he followed it in Cairo. He was frugal and gradually accumulated a considerable amount of property. It includes considerable Cairo real estate, tenement houses, some of them on Ninth Street, and also stock in a department store in Chicago and in a sanitarium there.\n\nMr. King had been in poor health for about a year. He fell down the steps some months ago and received injuries which developed a cancer. This was removed, but his advanced age prevented his complete recovery.

We further find that the said John Wade was justified in the act, and we therefore exonerate him from all blame. The said shooting took place at the corner of Thirty-second Street and Commercial in Cairo, Alexander County, Illinois, about 12:15 a.m. Jan. 20, 1908.”\n\nThe verdict was signed by W. McEwen, foreman; J. J. Coleman, Roy Clark, Richard Taylor, Walter Noonan, and Joseph Mulvin.\n\nThis was the verdict reached in Cairo’s latest homicide case, after six witnesses had been examined and the jury was out just long enough to prepare their verdict.\n\nAccording to the statement of Wade, who is a Cairo police officer, he was patrolling that vicinity with Officer George Bradley. The officers had separated, Bradley going on, when Wade’s attention was attracted by a noise behind him, and turning around he saw Griggs approaching with a knife in his hand and his arm drawn back to strike. Wade said that his hand was on his gun which was in his pocket and he turned loose and emptied his revolver, shooting five times.\n\nAn examination of the body showed that four bullets took effect. One went through his heart, one entered above the heart, another below, and another hit him in his head.\n\nIt is alleged that Griggs had had an old grudge against Wade and had made threats against him.\n\nThe witnesses examined by the coroner’s jury were Martin Temple, Joseph Boaz, George Bradley, Joe Price, and John Anderson.\n\nA big crowd was present at the council chamber to hear the evidence, and those who knew of the dilapidated condition of the building were fearful that it would give way under the strain. The remains when viewed by the jury were at Hughes’ undertaking establishment.\n\nOne of the witnesses, Martin Temple, when asked how he happened to be in that vicinity at the time of the shooting, said that he had been upstairs over the saloon at Thirty-second and Commercial, where they had some beer, but had been ordered out. This statement is of interest as indicating that the Sunday “lid” was lifted in that vicinity.\n\nJesse Hutchison was sentenced Saturday to serve twenty-five years in the penitentiary for the murder of Hanse Waters of Pulaski.

It is possible I can throw some light on that subject. There were two of my company boys that were wounded and in the Cairo hospital at that time and as I had been discharged sometime previous to that, their people up home sent me down to look after them, and bring them home as soon as they were able to travel.\n\nThese Georgia and Florida men were taken prisoner down near Tupelo, Miss., and sent up on the B. & O. Railroad to Columbus and put on the transfer boat and landed at the old wharf boat and were taken from there to the old hospital that stood out in the Big Four Railroad yard. That was about the last days of October or the first of November. There were eight of them, five of them were badly wounded and died as I remember it. Two of them died on the 11th of November late in the evening and one died on the 12th early in the morning. They were placed in coffins and a fatigue party was detailed and an army wagon took the detail and the dead men to Mound City and buried them where the dead Confederates from Mound City had been buried—that is now the Government Cemetery. I presume the other two were buried at the same place.\n\nThose dead bodies found near the old fair grounds were not soldiers, but some refugees that died from small pox and were buried near the pest house (or tent) early in 1862.\n\nGeorge W.

He also arranged to let Reeves have an ice box that he had purchased at the Fair and for which he still owed $6, if Reeves would pay the balance on it, and agreed to return that night to go with Reeves to see Mr. Newman about the matter. He never came back and naturally those acquainted with the man are wondering what has happened to him.\n\nSmith left his boarding place on Seventh Street at 5 o’clock in the morning without saying anything about getting his breakfast, but he told Reeves that he must hurry back there for breakfast. He never returned.\n\nSmith, who worked for the Lewis Commission Company, sent a note to Louis Walder, that he would not be on hand to work that day, but would come around that night, Monday, but he did not come. Last Saturday he gathered up a lot of fruit which he said he was going to take to his boy in Charleston, but he did not have any bundle when he was last seen.\n\nThe house No. 427 Seventh Street, was searched last night in the hope that some trace of the man might be found.\n\nIt will be remembered that Smith’s wife left him and took up with Otice Strawbridge, taking one of her children. When Smith attempted to take the child away from the boarding house on Seventh Street he was arrested, but was later released. Strawbridge was arrested on the wharf boat as he was about to leave the city with Smith’s wife and Smith’s household goods. The peculiar thing is that Smith failed to swear out a state warrant against Strawbridge, so all that the officers could do was to charge with carrying concealed weapons.\n\nMrs. L. Glauber, of Twenty-second Street, received word today of the death of Mr. Glauber’s mother in Paducah, Ky. Mr. Glauber was at his mother’s bedside at the time of her death.

Howley, James Meehan and Henry Levy.\n\nSMITH TURNED UP LAST EVENING\n\nReturned from East Prairie, Where He Has Now Shipped His Goods\n\nJames Smith, whose mysterious movements were causing his friends considerable alarm yesterday, turned up last night with the explanation that he had been called suddenly to East Prairie, Mo., to see his child, who is ill and had no chance to let anyone here know of his whereabouts.\n\nTwo wagons from East Prairie, in charge of Smith’s father-in-law, came over last night after Smith’s household goods to take them back to East Prairie, where his wife is now living.\n\nNEGRO MURDERER CAPTURED IN CAIRO\n\nWanted for Cold Blooded Murder in Levee Camp in Hickman County, Ky.\n\nWIFE OF VICTIM GIVES NEGRO AWAY\n\nClaims That He Was Following Her in Order that He Might Kill Her to Put Her Out of the Way\n\nSilas Johnson, charged with the murder of William Gibson, another negro at a levee camp near Maple, in Hickman County, Kentucky, was arrested this morning at No. 521 Eighteenth Street and is now in the county jail awaiting the arrival of the officers from that county. It is said that there is a reward of $50 for the capture of the man.\n\nThe arrest was accomplished through the efforts of the wife of the dead man, who saw Johnson here and notified Deputy Sheriff Albert Frost, who with the aid of Jailer Abernathie made the arrest.\n\nJohnson claims that he killed Gibson in self-defense when he shot him in the head with a double barrel shot gun, blowing off the top of his head. Mrs. Gibson tells a different story, and she further states that for fear that she would tell on him, Johnson had been tracking her in order to kill her. Johnson tracked the woman to Bird’s Point, where he worked for a time and followed her over to Cairo when she came to this city.\n\nThe woman says that there are four witnesses right in Cairo and that there are fifteen persons who know about the tragedy which occurred last October.\n\nA tenement house on Pennsylvania Avenue (Mound City), occupied by colored families was totally destroyed by fire yesterday afternoon. A baby who was left in the house by one of the tenants, was so severely burned that there is no hopes for recovery. The building is owned by Daniel Hogan.\n\nA colored boy about 17 years of age was killed here (Villa Ridge) Saturday afternoon by a northbound freight.

She has been confined to the asylum for 26 years, having been taken there because of her worry over the death of her son, Thomas, who was killed 27 years ago on the Illinois Central incline, near Twentieth Street, while switching. The deceased was born in Cork County, Ireland and came to this country when a young girl. She is one of Cairo’s oldest citizens, having come to this city in 1857, from Rome, New York.

The jury was composed of William Magner, H. M. Sullivan, H. A. Ellsworth, Roy Clark, Harry Steinhouse, and John Coleman.\n\nThe witnesses examined were Earl Carver, motorman; David Meehan, engineer for the Halliday elevator; James Gillespie, superintendent of the Halliday elevator; Frank Clark, a steamboat man of 401 Commercial Avenue; Emmett Palmer, laborer of the same address; R. H. Williams, locomotive fireman who also boards at McCann’s; B. H. Lambert, a bartender for McCann; Joseph E. Mueller, real estate dealer; P. H. Hubbard, the tailor; and William Johns, conductor on the car.\n\nCarver’s testimony was substantially as given in The Citizen last evening. He said that the car was running about four miles an hour and he saw the man when he was about twenty feet away. He was then approaching the track. He said that he applied the brakes and rang his bell and slowed the car down to about a mile and a half an hour when the car struck the man. He was asked if he dropped the fender and why if he did not, and he replied that he did not drop it; that he was putting all of his force on the brakes.\n\nDavid Meehan testified that he was on the car talking with some other men and paid no attention to the car slowing up until the motorman opened the door and said that he struck a man. When he got off he found the man lying on his face with his left foot behind the rear wheel and his right foot in front of it with the wheel partially on it. The wheel had passed over the left foot and the car had to be backed up to get the wheel off the other foot.\n\nEmmett Palmer stated that he saw the man about fifteen or twenty minutes before the accident happened, in McCann’s Saloon. When the accident did happen, someone ran into the saloon and said that someone had been run over. He ran out and saw the man lying there and when the body was turned over, he recognized him as O’Neill. Witness stated that as far as he knew the man was not a habitual drunkard. He said that while he saw him drink occasionally, he never saw him drunk.\n\nB. H. Lambert, the bartender at McCann’s, also testified that O’Neill was in the saloon fifteen minutes before the accident. He stated however that the man was a sober man as far as he knew him that he only drank occasionally. Lambert said that when he heard that the man had been run over, he went out and saw him lying with his foot under the wheel. He told the motorman to back the car up and the motorman said “I can’t.” Insisting that the car be backed, Lambert said that the motorman got in his cab and backed it up and witness pulled the man’s right leg out from under the wheel. Just as he did it, the man drew up his leg just a little. He said that he never heard the man speak a word as long as he was out there, but that he heard him groan once or twice.\n\nWilliam Johns, the conductor said that he was on the inside of the car when it struck the man. He knew that there was something wrong when the car stopped for he felt a sudden jerk as though the car has hit something. He said that the motorman rang his bell all the way from Third Street; that he is a motorman who continually rings his bell. When asked whether the headlight on the car was burning all the time, he said that he knew that the light was burning when they started from the depot, and that it was burning after the accident happened.\n\nGov. Hubbard in his testimony said that he had already made his statement; that he wrote it out on paper. When asked how that was the fact, it was brought out that he had filled out a blank that was presented to him for signature by the Traction Company. He handed the statement to the coroner who examined it.\n\nWord was received this morning from St. Louis over the long distance telephone to prepare the body for burial and ship it to E. J. O’Neill, at St. Louis.\n\nThe sewer people say that O’Neill mailed a letter a few days ago to Mrs. Henry O’Neill, 407 Minerva Avenue, St. Louis, which would indicate that he had a wife.\n\nThe body will be shipped to St. Louis tonight.\n\nTwo letters are in the post office, one from St. Louis and the other from an address in Kansas, for the dead man, which it is believed will throw some light on the man’s relatives.\n\nThe St. Louis Star Chronicle today said:\n\nA telegram from Coroner McManus, of Cairo, Ill., apprised Chief Gillaspy Thursday night of the killing in that city of Henry O’Neill, formerly of St. Louis. No details are furnished, but the police here were asked to notify John O’Neill, an uncle, who was mentioned in the message as a street inspector here.\n\nChief Gillaspy sent to 20 addresses in an effort to locate the family. Finally the family of John O’Neill was found at 3830 Sullivan Avenue. John O’Neill is a race horse man, the police were informed and is in Hematite. The family, however, said that John had a nephew named Henry, but he had not been heard of for years and the family did not know what had become of him. No John O’Neill is employed by the street department.\n\nFUNERAL NOTICE\n\nDied—Mrs. E. M. Brickell aged 70 years.

Purdue, aged 54 years, 2 months and 23 days.\n\nNot long since, the deceased accepted a temporary call to the Congregational Church at Grand Chain, but his health did not permit him to remain there long.

C. passenger train No. 23 and almost instantly killed.\n\nThe killing occurred about three miles south of this city at about 9:30 p.m. The passenger train running a half hour or more late from the Carbondale station.\n\nThe dead girl was a daughter of Charles Ferrill, Illinois Central section foreman, the family living in the section house near the railway tracks, about two miles below Carbondale. Saturday night Mr. Ferrill, the daughter Iva and the other children of the family, together with some others living in their neighborhood attended services at the Union Church at Boskydell, the party walking the distance about two miles on the I. C. railway tracks. On their return home the members of the party had covered about half the distance from Boskydell when the shocking tragedy was enacted.\n\nThe young folks in the party were lively and the walk from Boskydell was without special incident until a northbound freight train passed them about a mile north of that place. It is stated that one of the boys was trying to entertain the girls of the party by trying or pretending to board the freight. The girls and some others of the party were intent on watching the boy’s performance and did not notice the passenger train which was coming towards them at a good rate of speed, on the south main on which they were standing. Several of those in the party had narrow escapes from being struck, but all managed to get out of the way but Iva Ferrill. She was struck by the engine of the passenger train, her body being hurled quite a distance. When the body was picked up a minute or two later she was already dead. Mr. Ferrill and little son were some distance in advance of the other members of the party and were not eye witnesses of the killing.\n\nJohn Adams, brother of Enoch and Thomas Adams, of this city, was one of those in the party returning from the Boskydell church. He was ahead of the several girls when he saw the passenger train coming. Noticing that the young folks were in great danger, he succeeded in getting one of the girls named Waddington, off the track by almost tossing her over his head. The two girls were arm in arm at the time, laughing loudly and entirely unconscious of any danger.\n\nTrain No. 23 was brought to a stop immediately. The body of the girl was placed on board and the train backed to the Ferrill home one mile north. The parents of the girl were almost prostrated by the tragic death of their daughter.\n\nThe coroner’s jury completed their inquest Sunday night, the verdict being that of accidental death.\n\nThe Ferrill family formerly lived in or near Makanda. Mr. Ferrill being a nephew of H. E. Ferrill of that place and a cousin of Mrs. Henry Chamness, of Carbondale. Mr. Ferrill has but recently resigned as section foreman with the intention of removing back to Makanda.\n\nThe burial took place today at the Limestone Cemetery between Makanda and Cobden.\n\nT. B.
