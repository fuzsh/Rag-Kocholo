        "text": "I haven’t forgotten about the Alchemist Cabinet, in fact, I’ve been busy compiling more stories than ever! Recent weeks however have seen me become quite busy with various commitments both inside and outside the alcohol industry so updates have been and probably will remain slow until the new year. I recently came across this gem of an article from near Columbus Indiana I thought you might enjoy as it gives a bit of an inside view (albeit from a child) of life around a Hoosier Distillery in the earliest of days. Of note here is the use of the Cordial bottle as a dipping dog and the tread mill and mule used to raise water for cooling the still worms. I have come across both of these before. It is by wanton habit that when searching for still sites I always look for elevated water or nearby water sources but more and more I am realizing that elevated water wasn’t needed if you could raise it yourself and in some cases cisterns/rain water served all the purposes of cooling and the distilleries weren’t always in close proximity to a spring, creek, pond, or well. Enjoy.\n\nColumbus Indiana Weekly Times March 12 1897\n\n“Ye Olden Tyme”\n\nThe Distillery\n\n“The distillery at Arnold’s mills, was probably built in the “20’s” somewhere. At any rate I saw it about 1835 when I crossed the river with my father. He was then building the “cottage house” in which uncle Ephraim’s family and ours resided till the early spring of 1841. My mother, then a widow, chose the uncle Joseph Fassett house and farm of 160 acres, and fourteen acres bought of George Cummings as a equal division of the partnership property, and moved there.\n\nUncle Ephraim took the mills and some timber on the west side of the river, and also took all the credits and debts of the firm.\n\nHog drovers used to buy our still slops and also to use our ten acre ox lot, for their hogs. I remember walking around the lot and looking at the large fat hogs. The slop was first let out, into a large vat 20 x 60 feet and three feet deep to cool. For a while water was pumped from the river for the use of the still house by a mule on a large circular tread wheel lying elliptically. I often earned a tip (6 ¼ cts.) by sitting up close to the mules back and touching him up with a whip when he began to walk slow. Otherwise he would stiffen his front legs and stop the large wheel on which he was treading. I kept my “fips” and “bits” (12 cts) in a Brandtiths pill box.\n\nLater my father ran some long belts to a mill wheel to run the pump at the still house. This relieved the mule but stopped my revenue\n\nOnce I did something out of the way at the house and to avoid punishment took refuge under this big tread wheel, where the hogs slept and fleas abounded. Our hired girl came for me but I refuse to come out, and she would not come under after me. She was unconcerned about it, and said if I would come out mother wouldn’t whip me. But as soon as I came out she grabbed me, and dragged me home where I was chastised severely.\n\nI once saw Jim Chase drink whiskey out of a half gallon measure, and some drops ran down the corners of his mouth. A man said “jim, your mouth leaks”. Chase said “you’re a damn liar!” whereupon the other knocked him down and the back of his head struck the door sill very hard\n\nWe children used a Godfrey’s cordial bottle with string attached as a “proof vial” to try the new whiskey. Of course we little boys were judges of such a matter, and would let our bottle down and draw up some of the liquor to look at, just as the head man did. There was a malt house near by where the soaked corn was dried before grinding for malt meal.\n\nThe distillery was discontinued for a year or so before my fathers death in 1840. Probably fifty barrels of whisky were stored in an old log house at one time. Cousin Addison Pownail, brother George and myself were having some Christmas by shooting at a mark. Add set a board with a spot on it against this cabin to aim and fired. The ball passed through the board, between the logs of the house, and into a barrel of whisky. We left then and did not make a report.\n\nIsaac Talley of Madison Ind, remodeled the flouring mill about 1846. Uncle Ephraim took him in as a partner, but they got into a tangle somehow, and within a year the partnership was dissolved by arbitration. A miller named Whiteside of Columbus was one of the arbitrators and I think Banfill of the same place was another. They allowed Talley *00 and $2.75 a day for his time, including board for himself, wife and child, and the use of a house. Whisky then sold for twenty and thirty cents per gallon. While Talley was at the mills, the old still house, unused for several years was made into a barn for horses.\n\nA bucket of whisky with a dipper in it was always within reach of the “mill hands” and farm workmen. Once when a boy of six or seven years, while in the company of some men, I took two or three drinks from a half gallon measure, to be like them. Soon I concluded to go home some hundred and fifty yards distant and heard my brother George calling as he came towards me. I was much tickled and laughed to myself, thinking that when we met I would throw him into the middle of the mill race; but somehow when we met I thought I was not well and so I went home and told my mother. She made me a nice pallet on the floor and in reply to her questions I told her I thought I had the ague, but when I began vomiting on the floor she seemed to know all about it and I had to skip on hands and knees over the steps and out of doors without getting up.\n\nAnd so I learned I had better not drink whiskey while I had a mother!\n\nThomas H Arnold,\n\nMay 1896\n\nTo anyone else a pile of building stones is just debris, to me it is part of a larger story of Hoosier distilling and our legacy therein. I’ve written here many times of the old Jacob Wesner and later Adam Brewer distillery and of the connections between the distilling families of the Robertsons, Wesners, Hammersley’s, Ryman, and Brewers, usually in connection with Cave River Valley. I’ve known roughly where this old distillery was located but I myself had never been there, nor documented it.\n\nYou see, for me, it’s important to see these places, to get a feel for how they were laid out, for what the daily lives of the people who worked here were like. I know I view this differently from most as I myself am a distiller, but I want to, need to, and seemingly do now have a better understanding of the early distilling in these Hoosier hills. For me these simple building stones can speak and are clearly alive with the memories of yesteryear, they want me to find them. If I don’t document them then who will?\n\nFirst I’ll give you a little background on the Wesner Distillery. You might even want to delve back into the archives and watch the interview I did with a Wesner descendant (who was also a Henry Robertson descendant) or read the several articles I’ve written about Old Clifty, but this will give you a basic primer from a couple of different sources.\n\nJacob Wesner and wife the former of whom was born in Germany and came to America at an early date and located in the Twin Creek hills of Washington county Indiana where he operated a still house. Jacob Wesner was one of the most extensive distillers of the territory and worked at this together with general agricultural pursuits which he followed on his farm in Brown township – Centennial History of Washington County\n\nThe location of the last distillery here was not on the old mill site but about one fourth of a mile to the northeast. It was operated by Adam Brewer, with assistance from Charley Link until prohibition took effect in 1918/19A History of Campbellsburg Indiana\n\nNo commercial distilleries are listed as operating in Brown Township until 1860. Even then, it was not located at Clifty, but was operated a short distance east of there by a firm known as Jacob Wesner and Son. In 1960 it had produced 70 barrels of whiskey valued at $1400. This distillery seems to have been in business but a short time and possibly quit when the government started licensing the distilleries in 1866.A History of Campbellsburg Indiana\n\nAll of this gives us some idea of where the old distillery was located along with descriptions of the existence of a foundation through oral tradition being located near Moscow cave and the cave system being known as the Stillhouse cave system.\n\nI initially hiked into the valley on October 2’nd in hopes of searching out the distillery but started late in the evening and ran out of light, fortunately the scenery as always was beautiful and I did come across a stream bed which itself led to a small cave. I made sure to snap a couple short cell phone videos of this stream to share. I started at the location of the original Robertson distillery and then worked myself downstream (which Ironically is North East due to the unique geography of the box canyon) past where the stream for Endless Cave (which I also hiked out of curiosity) meets the stream for River Cave and down to the old damn which previously held a fish pond I believe.\n\nThe next day I returned to the valley with my friend D.J. Henderson, determined to find the foundation we hiked to my previous days ending point and started moving downstream again, checking out a couple of stream beds as we went, we eventually crossed to the west side of the river where we found a number of old well traveled wagon roads (later used for logging roads) with deep ruts cut into the earth from years of travel. All of these roads converged on a dry stream bed next to the river and a large assortment of limestone building stones that had clearly once been a building of some sort attracting a lot of local traffic. The building itself was no more and closely resembled what I saw at the original Wolfe distillery in Stillhouse hollow, the blocks had tumbled and then been pushed up in a pile (likely by loggers) Had I not known what to expect I would have completely passed up this nondescript pile of debris.\n\nWe stopped to study the debris and landscape a bit closer and do some filming for the upcoming Hells Half Acre Documentary. As I studied the landscape a few things stuck out to me. All of the old roads led to this “building” and there was what appeared to be a dry spring up the side of the hill which could have easily have provided water to a bustling distillery years ago. Amongst the debris and set next to the river was another small pile of stones, many hand shaped, that gave every appearance of a boiler furnace. Just as in the Wolfe distillery and the Green Distillery there appeared to be a purpose to the geography with a hill to one side and a stream drainage moving through the site. I’ve seen this same set up many times, along with the old stone building, it seems that the early Hoosier distillers prefered stone buildings built next to and sometimes on top of small springs/streams, with a hill structure to facilitate gravitational flow of liquids (fermenter to still, still to either animal enclosure or stream to remove waste). Having made my determination I was 95% certain we had found the distillery but I still wanted to make my way to Moscow cave to be sure, so onward we hiked.\n\nIn about 1/8 a mile we found a stream bed and traveled up it. Water was running and two stream beds were visible, one wet, one dry. Some shaped stones were observed but nothing that screamed distillery to us. Shortly in front of us a plateu of limestone and a waterfall made it’s appearance. To the left side of this waterfall we observed some hand cut and stacked stones. If I didn’t know better I might think this was a dam at some point back and it may well have been. Atop the plateu we followed the stream to yet another waterfall atop which we found Moscow cave!\n\nSatisfied the first site was in fact the distillery we hiked back to the truck stopping at the site on our way back to make a few more observations. As always I am glad to have yet identified another of the old distilleries and managed to help keep it’s memory and legacy alive. If this is in fact the site of the old distillery it is also the site of the great failed Paw-Paw experiment that Adam Brewer undertook and got national attention for:\n\nBrewer made news in all the area newspapers in October 1915 with the announcement that he was going to try “an entirely new departure in the distilling line” by attempting to make some paw paw brandy. The reason for this was that the quantity of apples with which to make the noted Indiana apple-jack was very small, only enough perhaps to make 10 barrels, while it was a banner year for paw paws. Brewer expected the new product to be as good for medical purposes as apple brandy. The new product was not a smashing success. Dr. L.W. Paynter, then practicing in Campbellsburg, described it as “…the most potent liquor ever made here, equaled in kick no doubt by nothing less powerful than aguardiente or tequila, of Mexican make, was the paw paw brandy which was distilled here before the World War. It has long been my contention that any single nation engaged in that war, had it been equipped with a few thousand gallons of that paw paw brandy, could have changed history and made over the map of Europe to its own liking, such was the potency of this distillate. But the memories aroused through mention of this brandy, and the ludicrous incidents attendant upon the treatment of some of my patients who had imbibed too freely of it, have caused me to wonder far afield from my subject.” Charles E. Cook, who worked on Dr. Paynter’s farm at the time for 50 cents a day, later reported that one day he took some of Doc’s apples out to Clifty. As was the custom of the times, he received his payment partly in cash and partly in brandy. This time the brandy happened to be of the new paw paw variety. According to Cook, Brewer had “gotten the proof high enough, but could not get the poison out”. As a result, Cook’s eyes, face, and tongue became badly swollen: the same results being experienced by several others who drank the brandy, according to Cook. – History of Campbellsburg Indiana\n\nSadly Adam Brewer was one of the few pre-prohibition Hoosier Distillers who had grand plans to return from prohibition by restarting the old Clifty distillery and mill. In 1931 he was delivering a wagon load of corn down the large hill into the valley to mill for whiskey production when the wagon overturned and killed him. He is buried at the Hop-Thompson cemetery about a half mile south of the old distillery.\n\nI should mention the names here of a few other Brown Township distillers and also make note for future research that there is yet another still house identified not far from the valley, though the proprieter is unknown to me at this time, just south west of the valley at the corner of Middle District and Marshall road is another cave spring known as Stillhouse Cave, I hope to find more information on this location in the near future.\n\nALONZO S. WILCOX\n\nA prominent citizen and native of Brown Township, was born February 14, 1839, being the fifth child of a family of seventeen children born to Hiram and Julia (Clarke) Wilcox, who were natives of the State of Vermont, the former of English-Irish, and the latter French-Scotch descent. Alonzo remained at home and assisted this parents on the farm until he attained the age of thirty-five years. He received a common education such as the facilities of his day afforded. June 16, 1879, his marriage with Elizabeth O’Harrow was solemnized, and to their union the following three children have been born: Mary L., Maud and Otis Otho. His occupation has been principally farming, in connection with which he did some distilling, and operated a saw and grist-mill. He also raised considerable stock, and he has been quite successful in those pursuits. He now owns 1,400 acres of land, of which the greater part is improved. In politics he is very liberal in his ideas, preferring to vote with that party which in his judgment will best contribute to the country’s good.\n\nHistory of Lawrence, Orange and Washington Counties, Indiana\n\nHUGH MCFLEMING\n\nA prominent old citizen of Brown Township, is a native of Ontario County, N.Y., where he was born July 8, 1807, being the fifth child of a family of nine children born to James and Jane (McNeall) Fleming, who were natives respectively of Ireland and Pennsylvania, and came to this State about the year 1817, and settled in this county on the farm now owned and occupied by our subject. Hugh always lived at the old homestead, and received a limited education in the primitive log schoolhouses of his day. October 10, 1860, his marriage with Ageline Jean was solemnized, and to their union the following four children have been born: Jane, Mary E. (who was united in marriage to Millard Jean), Phoebe E. and Bellona. Previous to the date of his marriage he followed wagon-making and distilling in connection with his farming, since which time he has quit distilling. He has been quite successful in these various pursuits, and now owns over 600 acres, about half of which are yet in timber. Mrs. Fleming and children are members of the Methodist Episcopal Church. In politics he is a Republican, having been connected with the party since its organization.\n\nHistory of Lawrence, Orange and Washington Counties, Indiana\n\ncopyright 1884 Goodspeed Brothers and Company, Chicago\n\nThe following name has been mentioned from time to time with the Brewer/Wesner distillery as well, perhaps he was once even proprieter. I do know that he worked some time as the head man/distiller at the Robertson distillery and was there when the boiler exploded:\n\nLEWIS R. SHROYER\n\nA prominent citizen of Brown Township, is a native of Iroquois County, Ill., where he was born August 25, 1841, being the oldest of three children born to John D. and Matilda (Roberts) Shroyer. His parents were both natives of this county and township. After their marriage they removed to Illinois, where the former died, and his mother returned to this State, where she lived with her parents. Lewis received a common school education such as the schools of his day afforded. August 2, 1862, he realized the necessity of the preservation of our Union, and enlisted as a volunteer private in Company A, Sixty-sixth Regiment Volunteer Infantry, where he served for a period of three years, and was discharged in June, 1865, on account of cessation of hostilities. He was present at the following important engagements: Richmond, where he received a gun-shot wound which prevented him from serving for about three months, Resaca, Dallas, Kenesaw Mountain, Atlanta, Bentonville, N.C. December 21, 1865, his marriage with Lovisa Hammersly was solemnized, and to their union four children were born: Mary E., Sarah, Emma and Nora, all at home. October 17, 1877, Mr. Shroyer suffered the bereavement of losing his beloved wife. September 21, 1880, his nuptials with Martha Davison were celebrated, and their union has been blessed with three children: Edith, John D. and Zellah. His occupation has always been farming, and he has been quite successful; he now owns 200 acres of improved land. When a baby, Mr. Shroyer was christened in the Methodist Episcopal Church. In politics he is a stanch Republican, and he takes an active interest in the political affairs of the community in which he lives.\n\nHistory of Lawrence, Orange and Washington Counties, Indiana\n\nAlso, our interview with Larry Wesner\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZGG-cUsG94\n\n“Mango” paw paw variety. Pic courtesy of Darren Bender-Beauregard of Brambleberry Farm.\n\nPaw-Paw Brandy: An Underutilized and distinctly American product.\n\nIn keeping with my historic bent on American Distillation I’ve decided to explore an underutilized Midwest fruit for the production of fruit mash brandy. If one were to enquire of most Midwesterners now days what a “Paw-Paw” is most would stare back in confusion but as little as 20-30 years ago this mostly wild foraged fruit was well known in the countryside as it was considered a fall treat gathered in abundance by many during the prime wood cutting and ginseng hunting season.\n\nAsimina trilobal is known by many names; The Hoosier Banana, Michigan Banana, Kentucky Banana, Quaker Delight, American Custard Apple, and my personal favorite “The Hillbilly Mango”. The Paw-Paw is the largest native tree fruit to the Americas and has wide distribution as far west as Oklahoma and as far east as New York and ranges as far south as Florida and as far north as Canada. The flesh is custard like in consistency, usually of a yellow coloration, and carries flavors of Banana and Mango and the aroma and muskiness of Cantaloupe. Typically the trees are bushy affairs that grow in groves underneath a canopy of deciduous neighbors although they can reach heights of 30-40 feet and can produce prodigious crops of fruit from 2-6 inches long which are very aromatic.\n\nMany of my own personal memories of childhood growing up in the southern Hoosier Hills of Indiana involve taking the time to pick bags of paw-paws with my grandparents to snack on and deliver to an elderly man in town to enjoy between sessions of cutting wood for the winter. To this day the fragrant aroma of the fruit can transport me directly back to any of a handful of Autumn days spent learning the lore of my family and the expectations of farm life from my grandparents. The fruit also attracted large numbers of box turtles to feast upon them as well, providing me hours of joy and the turtles a six year old tormenter. To say that the Paw-Paw was an integral piece of my life would simply be an understatement regarding the importance of this fruit so often though of a “lowly” nature and unfortunately forgotten and consigned mostly to be considered of no commercial value.\n\nAlthough the fruit was looked upon fondly by George Washington who enjoyed them chilled and served for dessert and Thomas Jefferson who cultivated his own at Monticello the true commercial value of the fruit was never realized due to their tendency towards poor storage. At the ripe stage a paw paw will begin to break down and ferment in a short window meaning that shipping of the fruit was never a commercial possibility. The quick breakdown is actually a function of enzymes stored in the skin and seed membrane of the fruit which help facilitate natural fermentation.\n\nIn recent years a renewed interest in the fruit has spurred the breeding of new larger fruited varieties, many with excellent culinary qualities, commercial orchards are currently grown in Ohio (who made the fruit their state fruit in 2009), Kentucky, Indiana, and Maryland. The fruit is incredibly easy to cultivate and suffers little from known pests. Sometimes pollination is an issue and is facilitated by planting two or more genetic varieties or by placing rancid smelling items to attract flied for pollination. Yes, you read that correctly, flies, not bees.\n\nIf you live anywhere in the native range of the fruit the chances are you can easily find a grove that could provide enough raw material to consider the production of brandy from paw-paw or even possibly find a local grower experimenting with cultivated varieties. Considering that the fruit is native to the Americas , is fairly abundant, and is mostly pest free, it would be an excellent candidate for the latest wave of craft distillers. The distillate produced by this fruit resembles in many ways that produced from the fermentation of banana but is far more complex in it’s presentation and carries with it a lot of mineral character not dissimilar to Chenin Blanc grape distillate as well as a strong vanilla aroma and slight tones of butterscotch, all of these making it a strong candidate for proper maturing in used rye barrels which would give some spicy contrast or if affordability isn’t an option then the spicy nature of the French Oak Barrel would be an excellent choice.\n\nThe handling of material for fermentation would present a handful of challenges but those are all easily overcome using simple manual labor. The skin and the seed membrane both contain bittering compounds and the fruit is generally very seedy but the seed is of a large size and easily removed and should be as they too are bitter and were once used as a coffee substitute. The wine would be made in the method of a fruit mash brandy much like slivovitz or palinka. A simple hand press framed with untreated lumber with 1/8 inch stainless hardware cloth could be constructed in order to easily press the ripe fruit against allowing only the inner flesh of the fruit pass through. I would suggest 2-3 gallons of fruit per gallon and aim for a specific gravity of 1.060 or 14.7 Brix using sugar to raise the SG if needed. The aroma of paw-paw is very volatile so I would choose a good fruity white wine yeast and ferment in the mid 60’s. Double pot still distillation will really pull the flavors across into the finished product and give plenty of levity for making cuts.\n\nHere in Southern Indiana the Paw-Paw was a well known distillery feedstock with records of distillation dating back as early as the eighteen teens. Near my home village of Pekin a distiller by the name of Johnathan Spainhour made quite a name for himself distilling this fruit and in the later days of commercial distilleries here (1877-1914) many of the apple and peach brandy distillers made use of the fruit as a tertiary option in years when the orchards of apple and peaches didn’t fare so well, this spirit they sold locally but also on the open market as far away as New Orleans. If we want to build our craft to show the world what we are capable of then these innovative and native distillation feedstocks must be utilized in order to differentiate ourselves.\n\nI first came across the existence of this place via a recent social media post and wondered to myself how I had missed it in the past. For me this distillery, though I have not visited myself yet, has all the hallmarks of high interest. For one it is over 400 years old, tying directly into some of the oldest traditions of pot still distillation in the world, a glimpse into how things were once done. For two, direct fired pot stills, always in my wheelhouse!\n\nAs always I am proponent of keeping distillation as simple and traditional as possible and I was immediately intrigued by the production processes, the history, and the resilience of this 400 year old distillery located in the British Virgin Islands and making rum from sugar cane juice as opposed to molasses. I immediately set about finding as much information as I could about the distillery and added the owner on social media so as to get a better profile. In it’s 400 year history the distillery has definitely had its share of adversity but perhaps no challenge bigger and more fearsome than Hurricane Irma which laid the distillery bare. Fortunately for all of us the walls of the old girl were still standing and the Callwood family were no where near close to throwing in the towel. Who couldn’t or wouldn’t be enamoured with an ancient distillery using ancient pot stills that offers tours for $1.00 and fine rum as cheap as $10 a pint!\n\nPressing the cane.\n\nMatthew, tell us a little about yourself, your family, and the history your family as at the distillery please?\n\nThe distillery was officially started in the 1600s. The first owners were a family named Arundel from England but my family, the Callwood family, bought it in the early 1800s and we are now into the fourth generation.\n\nCollecting the juice\n\nWe here at the Alchemist Cabinet are very passionate about pot stills, tell us about your stills, where they came from and how old they are. Do you guys do double pot still distillation or just a single pass distillation? Do you ever have to have any repair work done on the stills?\n\nWe had two boilers that were operational. One of them got destroyed during a storm when a coconut tree fell on it. Unfortunately we couldn’t get it repaired as there is no copper on island and no skilled workers. We only distill our rum once, making heads and tails cuts. Proof off of the still is 98 but we proof it down to 40% due to our law here.\n\nFiring the pots for boiling the juice\n\nCan you describe to us a typical production day and how the juice is prepared for fermentation and how the stills are fired and what fuel you use? Also, what is your distillation season?\n\nWe have a sugar cane press that came here in the 1800’s which runs off of a diesel engine. The first one we had used donkeys for power but we sold it to St.Croix where it is now on display. Our season for making the rum is March-August and our yield is 25 gallons per day. Our fermentation takes 8-12 days depending on how hot it is.\n\nBoiling the juice to evaporate some water prior to fermentation\n\nWhat is the profile of your spirit from the still? Tell us about the different aged and flavored rums and the “panty dropper”.\n\nWe have four flavors of rum : 10yr old, 4yr old, white rum, and panty dropper which is blended with sweetness (they include a piece of sugar cane in the bottle) for nice flavor for the ladies.\n\nOriginal Alembic Stills. Direct fired\n\nIn 400 years your bound to have some good distillery related stories of either your own or passed down to you, any interesting historical events or funny stories about the distillery?\n\nBack in the day rum was only 10 cents and every Thursday and Friday crowds would gather to come and get drunk and would fall asleep on the squeezed sugar cane skin which is known as bagasse. (they also use the sugar cane after squeezing to fire their cookers in order to evaporate some water from the sugar can juice which takes about 3 hours, if you go longer than three hours you begin to create Molasses which they don’t want)\n\nHow are things progressing after Irma?\n\nEverything is back together after the storm, it was a slow process but we are keeping our heads up!\n\nFiring the stills with discarded wood!\n\nI’ve been rather lax in my writing for the Alchemist Cabinet lately, quite obviously not due to disinterest but due more to a lack of time as my work at Spirits Of French Lick, on the home farm, with Hells Half Acre, and on the current documentary as well as the second book have kept me busy. I still have yet to make my trip to visit the site of the old Sterling Alexander and Kemper Distilleries at Mauckport and New Amsterdam but it is certainly in the que. Thursday night I will be visiting the site of the original Wolfe distillery in Stillhouse Hollow in Orange County with a new made friend who claims that the foundation and possibly more still exist in the remote location. Until then, I continue to learn and uncover more about the history of distillation in “Hoosier Occupied Northern Kentucky.” My friend and Washington County Historian Jeremy Elliott of the John Hay Center in Salem Indiana recently found these and sent them my way.\n\nThis certainly rings familiar to nearly every distillery we have researched so far. The common themes are there; mills were always associated with distilleries and the Southern Hoosier Hills produced a lot of brandy! The letter above even talks about the “feet” of peach pits to yet be plowed out with mirrors our conversation from last year with Mr. Howard Wolfe about the 2 1/2 truckloads of peach pits he removed from the site of the second Wolfe brandy distillry in Stampers Creek Township in Orange County Indiana.\n\nThe history of Lawrence, Orange, and Washington records the following about this distillery on Elk Creek in Washington County Indiana:\n\nEARLY MILLS FACTORIE8 DISTILLEBIEB ETC Daniel Winslow and Joseph Johnson built a saw and grist mill on Elk Creek in Section 11 in 1833 It changed hands several times and was run until about 1808 Joseph Johnson and John F Price Sr built a steam saw and grist mill in 1854 It is now owned and operated by the latter and in its day has been an important industrial feature of the township Simeon Garriott conducted a distillery between 1820 and 1830 on Elk Creek in Section 26 Joseph Johnson built a distillery and made as whisky until the internal revenue was put on it He has distilled some brandy since.\n\nI’m presuming Johnson was distilling prior to the re-implementation of the excise tax in 1862 and was caught distilling illicitly sometime after. The later produced brandy may or may not have been legal. Interestingly enough some other distilling family names and connections are mentioned as well. Winslow is a name associated with Cave River Valley and Old Clifty distillery as they were related to the distiller Henry Robertson and had a distillery further down the valley at Moscow Cave (stillhouse cave system as some documents call it). The Garriott family as well as having their own distillery were relatives of the infamous John and Abraham Fleenor who introduced the famous distilling peach the Fleenor into commerce and production. The Johnson distillery it is important to not is not but just a couple miles from the site of John Fleenor’s old distillery as well and those peach pits were likely of the Fleenor genotype. Much like modern Polinka and Slivovitz distillers the peach distillers of Washington County were making fruit mash brandy by running the peaches through a nut mill. The wine for stillage would have included seeds which would fall free of the flesh and to the bottom of the barrel. The fermentation of the seed would not have harmed their viability any at all and those peach pits were often collected for replanting to furnish new trees for the old orchards.\n\nFrom Warder W. Stevens Centennial History of Washington County Indiana:\n\nDariiel Winslow and Joseph Johnson built a saw and grist mill on Elk creek in section II in I833 It changed hands a nurnber of times and wasfkept running until about I868 when it was abandoned Joseph Johnson and John F Price built a steam saw and grist mill on the northeast quarter of section 22 and for several years it was probably the most important industrial feature of the township Simeon Garriottv conducted a dis_tillery between 1820 and I830 on Elk creek in section 26 Among others who operated distilleries in the township at different periods were Joseph Johnson and John Crockett\n\nHere we see that John F. Price of “Price’s mill” mentioned in conjunction with the distillery of Johnson earlier actually built and operated the mill and subsequently owned it in conjunction with Joseph Johnson."
