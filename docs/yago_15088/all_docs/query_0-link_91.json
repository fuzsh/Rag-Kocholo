        "text": "Efforts to remove or cancel public statues now considered offensive have spread to Indiana.\n\nOfficials in Madison County, Ind., are scrapping plans for a statue of James Madison, the nation's fourth president, because he was a slave owner.\n\n►No thanks: Madison County, named after a slave-owning Founding Father, scuttles statue plan\n\nMadison originated the three-fifths rule, which counted slaves as less than a whole person for the purposes of legislative representation. But he also believed slaves were entitled to a right of liberty and thought slavery was a stain on the nation's reputation.\n\nThe Confederate monument in Garfield Park in Indianapolis stirred calls to move it — one man was arrested and accused of defacing it — even though it was meant to honor 1,616 Americans who died, many from disease, starvation and exposure in a prisoner-of-war camp in Indianapolis. Supporters say it should stay and be restored.\n\nEven Vice President Mike Pence weighed in on the issue in August, calling efforts to pull down Confederate monuments an attempt to “erase parts of our history just in the name of some contemporary political cause.”\n\nClearly the issue is complex and stirs strong emotions.\n\nHere are some public statues and art in Indianapolis and Indiana that may be considered controversial.\n\n1. Pioneer family\n\nThe depiction of a pioneer family is a popular and well-known Indianapolis attraction, keeping watch over Fountain Square at various times since it was installed in 1924. Pioneers helped clear the land and settle Indiana, which just celebrated its bicentennial in 2016. But some might consider it an insult against the first residents of Indiana, once considered home to the Potawatomi, Miami, Shawnee and other tribes. Many of those Indians were later forcibly removed from the state from 1830-46.\n\n2. George Washington\n\nA statue of the nation's first president, long called the \"father of his country,\" stands on the Indiana Statehouse grounds. Entitled \"George Washington as Master Mason,\" it shows him in breeches with an apron and medallion adorned with Masonic symbols. Washington was a slaveholder in Virginia and a member of the secretive Masonic organization, which some people distrust.\n\n3. William Henry Harrison\n\nA statue of the nation's ninth president stands next to the Soldiers and Sailors Monument in Downtown Indianapolis. Harrison ran on a campaign slogan of \"Tippecanoe and Tyler, too,\" to commemorate his defeat of the Shawnee Indians and their allies near Lafayette, Ind., in 1811. He was a well-known Indian fighter and his statue has a plaque that reads \"Conqueror of the Indian Confederacy.\"\n\n4. Christopher Columbus\n\nA bronze bust and pedestal of explorer Christopher Columbus, erected in 1920 by Italian-Americans on the 500th anniversary of his first voyage to the Americas, sits on the southwest corner of the Indiana Statehouse. Columbus' popularity has waned, however, as more people criticize his treatment of Indians and view him as launching centuries-long efforts to eradicate their culture. The plaque on his statue may seem out of place, since it reads: \"May the genius abiding in the Italian race encourage tolerance and acceptance of all cultures as America's ultimate contribution to humanity.\"\n\n5. Thomas Jefferson\n\nThe author of the \"Declaration of Independence\" and the nation's third president has long been admired and there is a statue of him in Warder Park in Jeffersonville, Ind. But the man who penned the words \"all men are created equal\" owned hundreds of slaves at Monticello in Virginia. Jefferson once called slavery a \"moral depravity,\" but his writings also suggest he believed blacks were inferior and he remained tied to slavery throughout his life, freeing only a handful upon his death.\n\n6. Thomas Hendricks\n\nHendricks was the 21st vice president as well as an Indiana governor, U.S. senator, and congressman, and a memorial to him was installed outside the Statehouse in 1890. However, as a congressman, Hendricks voted for the Kansas-Nebraska Act in the 1850s, which left it up to residents of U.S. territories to decide whether or not to permit slavery. He also voted against the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments, which abolished slavery and guaranteed voting rights to males of all races. His reasoning: It wasn't the right time, so soon after the Civil War, to change the Constitution.\n\nCall IndyStar digital producer Dwight Adams at (317) 444-6532.
