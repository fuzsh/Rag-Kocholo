        "text": "It is hard for me to start and simply talk about Argentina, being Argentine and having always lived here. As if talking about this country implied talking about only one or a few topics. I can talk about many diverse topics: economy, culture, politics, soccer, but I can’t stop asking myself where to start.\n\nWe are known for being world champions, for having good meat, tango and drinking mate. Now, these are some of the traditions that make up and identify us, to a greater or lesser extent, but what is it to be Argentine? What does it mean to live here? What does someone who has always lived in the country project for the future?\n\nI’d like to clarify: Argentina is a very large and diverse country, my perspective is from my place of privilege; I have always lived in the capital, Buenos Aires. In my country there are more than 40,000,000 people and probably, each one of us has our own particular point of view and experience.\n\nI often ask myself, if I had to explain to a foreigner what life is like here, what would I say? I could start by telling them that I grew up in this city, I have changed a lot and my vision of Argentina has changed too. I grew up in the neighborhood of Villa Crespo, a neighborhood in the geographical center of the city where middle class people live and where there is a large concentration of the Jewish community. I usually walk along Corrientes Avenue and I see many people passing by, many cafes where I can sit and have a drink; several cars move by slowly due to the traffic. The entrance of the subway Bis in my neighborhood, as well as many bus stops and available cabs. This city makes me feel good, small but at the same time big, important and insignificant. I also think that I am one of the many voices of this huge country and that the beautiful complexity it has is difficult to represent. I have traveled to some countries, and when I say that I am Argentinean, the answer is usually two things: making allusion to Messi or Maradona, or referring to the crisis we have “how cheap it is for us! and for you it is very expensive, isn’t it, it is very complicated to live there, there is a lot of poverty”. The world has different images about us and so do we. I think Argentina is a mixture of all that and a little bit more.\n\nAt times it’s not easy. Argentina’s inflation is growing every year and salaries are becoming less and less. Much of the population lives in a state of constant alert and uncertainty about prices, especially for everyday goods such as food. In addition, it’s no longer certain that if parents work and children study, they will be able to progress in life; the aspiration of owning their own home acquired by their own means is becoming more and more distant. The difficulty of obtaining economic progress that allows a better quality of life is more and more distant: salaries are not enough because “you have just started your working life” or “you have not graduated yet,” but they must be exceptionally good to be able to live well and save. Social mobility has been null or downward.\n\nI think what’s happening is that the possibility of consumption in this context generates a “carpe diem” philosophy. The possibility of saving money is becoming more and more distant and is projected in goods of lesser value. I often talk to people close to me who are between 55 and 60 years old. They tell me that the project of working and earning enough to have a house and a car of their own was not something utopian during their youth. Today, if you’re not lucky enough to have a family that owns property, the idea of making it on your own is pie in the sky. Back then, if you worked, you could save and eventually invest in the projects you dreamed of. Today, money quickly becomes less valuable. Our investments tend to be in expensive sneakers, fancy dinners, instant consumption. This is why many restaurants are full, even during the week. There is a reality and it is that this instant consumerism results from the difficulty of not being able to project an economically stable future. What also ends up happening is that personal trajectories are detached from a common destiny, in many sectors the way out of the crisis is thought of as an individual solution, few sectors think of a collective solution that includes answers adapted to the diverse realities of each corner of the country.\n\nThe cost of food, water and electricity is increasing every month and therefore, so is poverty; at the end of 2022, two out of every five people in Argentina were classified as poor (approximately 16 million people). Low-income people live one day at a time and in many cases what they earn is enough for one meal a day. Community organization is often one of the primary responses to this problem. In the country’s working-class neighborhoods, thousands of soup kitchens and dining halls feed thousands of people every day.\n\nHere I want to pause for a moment to talk about another side of Argentina. I don’t think it’s fair to describe Argentina as a place where inflation and poverty are the only things that prevail, this is a part of everything that shapes us: I can not fit the Argentine identity into a single thing, but I can recognize a common attitude and that is to keep the passion for the things that move us despite the difficulties of everyday life. I’m almost 22 years old and on many occasions I have seen my country divided by political opinions, believing more and more strongly and deeply that who you vote for defines who you are. I have seen moments of great hatred and division, moments of great unity with struggles won and rights conquered such as the Voluntary Interruption of Pregnancy, the approval of the Law of Equal Marriage or the mobilizations throughout the country under the slogan of Ni Una Menos (Not One More), although they have also been moments marked by a deep division.\n\nHowever, a historic event occurred in which, for the first time in a long time, inflation, crisis and political ideology did not matter, but the only thing that mattered was the passion and love for the team. The World Cup in Qatar awakened thousands of emotions and illusions for Argentines. The hope of seeing that player by whom we are all recognized in the world wherever we go and where they name him before asking your own name: the illusion of seeing Messi champion of the world with the Argentine national team. Messi had encounters and disagreements with the Argentine national team; he has been living in Spain since he was very young, having decided to bet on his soccer career, but that never prevented us from feeling him as one of our own. I would also like to say that here in Argentina, the soccer culture is very important. And not only that, it is also very powerful and passionate. Thousands of people have tattoos of their team’s emblem and they name their children after a player they like. Fans follow the team they support, whether it is going to the stadium, watching the games or being attentive to their social networks. Argentines support Boca, River, San Lorenzo, Racing or Estudiantes, but we are all Argentines. As the sports journalist Sofía Martinez said to Messi in an interview after the match against Croatia, thanks to him we all wear the same jersey and that is a lot, whether it is the original, the fake or the imaginary one. This is extremely valuable in a country increasingly polarized by ideologies, economic crisis and poverty. For the month of the World Cup lasted, I felt that we forgot about all this, about everything “bad” that we are told we are, about everything that destroys our self-esteem as a country, marked by ourselves or by outsiders. I felt that after many years, joy was what prevailed in the people. I will never forget the happiness in the streets, not only the day we won the championship where the celebration was absolute and even lasted for days, but also after every match we won. They played, but a whole country won.\n\nIn the face of all the crises, I will keep this with me: with the passion that we Argentines have, with the joy that Messi and the whole national team brought to every home in this country. Because in hard times, it is incomparable that someone gives you a moment of happiness and because even though many things are difficult, Argentines always have reasons to celebrate. I am left with the union that gave us a triumph. We were able to feel for the first time in a long time that we all really won."
