        "text": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Protests began Wednesday against the austerity and deregulation measures announced by Argentina’s newly elected President Javier Milei, whose government had also warned against blocking streets.\n\nFor years it has been common for protesters in Argentina to block streets for long periods of time; while Milei’s administration has said it will allow protests, it threatened to cut off public aid payments to anyone who blocks thoroughfares.\n\nMarchers began gathering in Buenos Aires, the capital, and set out toward the iconic Plaza de Mayo, the scene of protests dating back to the country’s 1980s dictatorship. Police struggled to keep marchers from taking over the entire boulevard.\n\nEduardo Belliboni, one of the march’s organizers, said demonstrators faced “an enormous repressive apparatus.” Belliboni’s left-wing Polo Obrero group has a long history of leading street blockades.\n\nBelliboni claimed marches wouldn’t fit on the sidewalks. “This (the street) is where people move around all over the world … where are we going to fit 50,000 people?,” he said.\n\nMilei, a right-wing populist, is facing the first test of how his administration responds to demonstrations against economic shock measures, which he says are needed to address Argentina’s severe crisis.\n\nThe shocks include a 50 percent devaluation of the Argentine peso, cuts to energy and transportation subsidies, and the closure of some government ministries. They come amid soaring inflation and rising poverty.\n\nREAD MORE: IMF agrees to release $7.5 billion to Argentina as its economy reels from drought\n\nProtesters “can demonstrate as many times as they want. They can go to the squares .. but the streets are not going to be closed,” Milei’s security minister, Patricia Bullrich, told local media.\n\nBullrich announced a new “protocol” to maintain public order that allows federal forces to clear people blocking streets without a judicial order and authorizes the police to identify — through video or digital means — people protesting and obstructing public thoroughfares. It can bill them for the cost of mobilizing security forces.\n\nSome groups say the protocol goes too far and criminalizes the right to protest.\n\nHours before the protest, police officers were deployed in downtown Buenos Aires and other parts of the city but mainly at the entrances to the capital and some public transportation stations.\n\nArgentine labor, social and human rights groups on Tuesday signed a petition asking the United Nations and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to intercede against the new public order procedures. The document states that the security protocol is “incompatible with the rights to free assembly and association, freedom of expression and social protest” recognized in the country’s constitution.\n\nOn Monday, the government announced that people who block streets could be removed from the public assistance benefit lists if they are on one.\n\nREAD MORE: Congressional draft report in Brazil recommends charges for Bolsonaro over insurrection attempt\n\n“To the beneficiaries of social plans: know that no one can force you to go to a march under threat of taking away your plan,” said Sandra Pettovello, head of the newly created Human Capital Ministry, which combines what were the ministries of Labor, Education and Social Development.\n\n“Protesting is a right, but so is the right of people to move freely through Argentine territory to go to their workplace,” she said.\n\nIn Argentina, some people receive social support directly from the government, but others get support through social organizations with direct links to federal offices. Milei’s administration says that many of these groups use this as a way to force people to go out to protests in exchange for support.\n\nWednesday’s march coincides with the 22nd anniversary of a protest against the government’s handling of an economic crisis that left dozens dead and led to the resignation of then-President Fernando de la Rúa.\n\nA recent poll by the University of Buenos Aires’ Observatory of Applied Social Psychology indicated that 65 percent of those surveyed agree with banning the blockades.\n\nMilei, a 53-year-old economist who rose to fame on television with profanity-laden tirades against what he called the political caste, became president with the support of Argentines disillusioned with the economic crisis.\n\nArgentina has an annual inflation rate of 161 percent, and four out of every 10 people are poor. The South American country also faces a $45 billion debt owed to the International Monetary Fund."
