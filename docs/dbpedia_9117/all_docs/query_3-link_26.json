        "text": "Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world and the second largest in Latin America after Brazil. Its capital and largest city is the sprawling metropolis of Buenos Aires, located on the eastern coast of the country. With a huge population of around 17 million in the Greater Buenos Aires urban area, it is one of the most populous cities in the Americas. The city is a highly popular tourist destination, known for its architecture and cultural heritage, as well as its festivals and nightlife.\n\nThe city of CÃ³rdoba is the second most populous in Argentina, with approximately 1.3 million residents. It is known as the Heartland of Argentina because of its location in the center of the country in the foothills of the Sierras Chicas, and still has many historical monuments preserved from the period of Spanish colonial rule. Rosario, in the province of Santa Fe, is also located near the center of Argentina, and has a population of around 1.2 million, making it the third most populous city in the country. Rosario is known for the neoclassical architecture that has been conserved over the centuries in many houses and public buildings."
