        "text": "Life in Buenos Aires can be a stimulating international experience, while simultaneously seeming familiarly modern. It offers very affordable costs, lush green spaces, easy to use public transportation, free bicycle services, and a safe and livable atmosphere, for Spanish and non-Spanish speakers alike. The city is full of international students, global travelers, expats, and locals, and you can weave into whichever scene you prefer. The city is what you make of it - and the options are unparalleled.\n\nThanks to the wealth of international and national businesses and nonprofit organizations based in Buenos Aires, the city offers plenty of engaging professional opportunities in diverse sectors and fields for Puentes participants. Buenos Aires is the country's hub for technology, startups, social organizations, government, big business, production, and education. Outside of the internship office, Puentes participants can take advantage of the many speakers, networking events, and professional gatherings throughout the city.\n\nBuenos Aires has produced some of Latin America’s and the world’s most renowned writers, like Jorge Luis Borges, and athletes, including Messi and Maradona. It has inspired works of art like “Evita.” The city has a vibrant media district and is chock-full of cultural centers, theaters, steakhouses (“parrillas”) and bars. The cultural offerings are endless - see great Latin American art, cheer along with the “hinchas” at a lively soccer game, move your feet to live music, explore the up-and-coming gastronomic scene, and more. Buenos Aires truly has something – indeed, everything – for everyone."
