        "text": "The weather of the city of Buenos Aires is humid (Pampas climate) with warm summers and cold winters.\n\nSummer: Hot and very humid. Temperature between 20°C and 35ºC.\n\nSpring: The climate is very changeable, with sunny days but also abundant rains. The temperatures also suffer oscillations between day and night. The temperature varies between 17° and 25°C.\n\nWinter: The temperature in Buenos Aires is not too low during the day, although during the night the temperatures drop considerably. The coldest month is July, when average minimum temperatures of 7°C and maximum temperatures do not exceed 15°C.\n\nAutumn: Temperature is from 7°C to 26ºC. The weather is hot at midday, and during the early afternoon, mornings and evenings are cool.\n\nFlight: Unless you are in Uruguay or in another city of Argentina, the easiest way to get to Buenos Aires City is the Ministro Pistarini International Airport. Better known as Ezeiza International Airport, it is the most important airport in Argentina. It is located 35 kilometers from Buenos Aires. It receives flights from all over the world. Once at the airport, the best way to get to the downtown area will be with a taxi, shuttle or private transfer.\n\nBus: The most important bus station in Buenos Aires is Retiro, located in the same neighborhood (Retiro) in the center of the city. There you will find long distance buses to all the country, it has more than 70 platforms and the information is in Spanish. The best is to have an offline translator on your phone. For long distance buses you can pay in cash or with a card. We recommend that you buy your ticket in advance, especially for travel on weekends or in high season.\n\nTrain: Buenos Aires has urban trains to connect the city with other nearby attractions. From Retiro you can take a train to the north to enjoy a day on the river or even to get to Tigre. To move within the city you can take the bus or the subway. For the urban trains, buses and subways you must pay with a transport card (called “sube”) in which you load money and it is useful for all means of transport.\n\nIn restaurants it’s customary to tip about 10% of the bill. Note that tips can’t be added to credit-card bills, so carry cash for this purpose.\n\nEstimate around USD 10/15 per person for the guide, for a full day tour and half of it for the driver.\n\nTip hotel porters for handling bags. Calculate an amount of currency equal to about $1.00 for every two bags. Same amount is calculated for drivers if they help you with your suitcases. If you are happy with the housekeeping you may want to consider tipping the maid between US$0.50 – $1.00 per night. You might also tip the concierge staff if you have used them to arrange dinner reservations, transportation or leisure activities.\n\nIn Argentina we don’t regularly tip taxi drivers.\n\nPick up at airports will be upon arrival of your flight, that’s why it is so important to have the most accurate and updated flight information. Our guide or driver will be waiting for you, outside baggage claim area, you will only have to look for a sign with your name on it. Pick up for tours will be at the reception desk/lobby of the hotels. At the end of your itinerary you will find the name and telephone number of each of our local representatives and our emergency phone number, where you can call if you have any urgency or a mismatch, so we can assist you during your trip.\n\nAny foreign consulate can provide a list of area doctors who speak English. If you get sick, consider asking your hotel concierge to recommend a local doctor — even his or her own. You can also try the emergency room at a local hospital. Many hospitals also have walk-in clinics for emergency cases that are not life-threatening; you may not get immediate attention, but you won’t pay the high price of an emergency room visit. For an English-speaking hospital, in Buenos Aires, we recommend The Hospital Británico (4304-1081).\n\nWe strongly recommend that you purchase insurance. Travel insurance helps protect against unforeseen emergencies which can occur at any time. It also helps protect you against other circumstances like travel delay, lost or stolen baggage and personal items, missed connections and so much more.\n\nEverything will depend on the time of year in which you visit the city.\n\nIf you come in the fall or spring, the ideal is to pack fresh clothes and the odd coat, since sometimes the wind coming from the south can generate a sudden change in temperature. Besides that, packing comfortable shoes is vital, since Buenos Aires is a city where you can (and should) walk a lot.\n\nIf you visit in the winter months, remember to bring a warmer coat, some scarves and gloves. Finally, if you choose the summer months, it will be very important that you bring sunscreen, a hat and sunglasses.\n\nA daily pack to wander the city will be really useful during your trip!\n\nThe weather of the city of Buenos Aires is humid (Pampas climate) with warm summers and cold winters.\n\nSummer: Hot and very humid.
