        "text": "need to know so i can include it in my essay for school! i know they transport the iron-ore to Sao Luis but not where in the amazon the project actually is. please help! would be very appreciated! ðŸ™‚ x\n\nI need to write about my school life,social life and home life but im not sure about anything else and i cant seem to start it, any ideas anyone?\n\nI'm doing a bit of homework on the future of Mali and how it is turning into a desert.. So what can farmers grow or farm in desert like conditions in Mali?? Thanks ðŸ™‚\n\nIf I understand correctly, from the map of plate boundaries and direction of the plate's movement in my book, seismic activity is associated with collisional plate boundary but there is not much explanation on this beyond this. Can someone please explain more on this? Is the level of activity less than that at a conservative margin since the plates are moving less rapidly or is there actually more activity due to the extreme pressure?\n\nOr is it simply enough to know that they're related at A level?"
