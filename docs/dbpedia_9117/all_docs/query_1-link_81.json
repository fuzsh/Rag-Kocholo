        "text": "About\n\nBuenos Aires is the second largest metropolitan area in South America, after Greater Sao Paulo: its conurbation numbers about 13 million people (1/5 living in poverty). It is also ranked Alpha in the GaWC5 list about the most influent cities in the world. Furthermore, in relation to Latin America, it: a) has the best quality of life; b) is considered the \"Paris\" of the region, for its buildings' style and train de vie; c) is the most competitive marketplace (producing 1/4 of ArgentinaÂ´s GDP). As Argentina's most populated city and its capital, Buenos Aires is one of the nation's largest energy consumers. The city's highest consumption rate is found within ist residential sector followed by services, commerce, and industry. Government is the lowest energy consumption sector.\n\nSustain Profile\n\nBuenos Aires is not a large producer of energy and consumes more than it produces. Fossil fuels and energy from power stations are imported into the city. The energy market is regulated by the national government, most of which is carried out by the National Energy Secretariat. Generation and distribution facilities are operating at their capacity due to a lack of investments. For this reason, the national government usually imports energy in order to satisfy growing demand."
