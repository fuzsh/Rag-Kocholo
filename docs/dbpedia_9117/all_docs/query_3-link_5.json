        "text": "Cities around the world are striving to be global. Buenos Aires is one of the largest cities in Latin America and dominates Argentina's economic, political, social and cultural processes, exerting great influence over national and regional development. This course examines the emergence of this elegant, cosmopolitan city as Argentina's gateway to the world, the impact of rapid population growth and the influx of trans-national organizations into the city. Students will gain insights into the ways in which globalization has affected the city and its inhabitants; analyze the changing nature of Buenos Aires' relationship with the rest of the world; and examine the major urban challenges facing the city today. The course also aims to help students contextualize their travels and encounters in the city, and to develop informed interpretations of their experience, as well as enhancing their understanding of recent Argentine history, culture and society. Topics will include the legacy of Spanish colonization, transition to democracy and recent impacts of Argentina's debt crisis on the city as well as Buenos Aires' significance as a cultural hub."
