Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI couldn't find pepper shakers on many restaurant tables, but I had no trouble getting my hands on salt.\n\nIn the US, I always see salt and pepper shakers right next to each other on restaurant tables.\n\nThough I could pretty much always find salt at the spots where I dined in Argentina, the pepper was seemingly absent. I learned that salt is a staple of Argentine cooking, but black pepper isn't.\n\nIn fact, the Argentine government passed a law in 2013 mandating the reduction of salt in prepared foods to prevent health issues like heart disease and high blood pressure. It's called Menos Sal Más Vida, which translates to \"less salt more life.\"\n\nRestaurants must limit the number of salt shakers they offer customers, display the risks of overconsumption on menus, and offer dishes that don't contain added salt. If the restaurants don't abide by the rules, the government can impose fines or shut them down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pizza had toppings I'd never tried before, like brown sugar and chickpea pancakes.\n\nItalian immigrants brought pizza with them to Argentina when they came in the late 19th century. However, the pies I saw in Buenos Aires had unique toppings and looked different than the ones I typically eat in the US.\n\nI tried a spin on Hawaiian pizza with pineapple, ham, black olives, and brown sugar. I was quite surprised to see sugar on pizza. Another one had hearts of palm, hard-boiled eggs, ham, and salsa golf, a cold sauce made of ketchup and mayonnaise.\n\nI also tried a white pizza, which looked similar to a deep-dish pie and was filled with cream and spinach. It's typically served with a slice of fainá, a chickpea pancake that goes directly on top of the pizza.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArgentina may be famous for its meat, but I had plenty of delicious vegetarian options to choose from in Buenos Aires.\n\nAs a vegetarian, I was skeptical about my food options in a country known for its meat. To my surprise, there were loads of mouthwatering meals that would make any vegetarian drool.\n\nI was able to order pretty much all of the pizzas without meat, meaning I didn't have to hold back from trying the local specialties.\n\nI also ate roasted vegetables with provoleta, which is provolone grilled to melty perfection, and handmade ravioli stuffed with eggplant, sun-dried tomatoes, and spinach. For snacks, I had walnuts and cheeses.\n\nEmpanadas, which are turnovers made with flour dough and stuffed with delicious ingredients, are another famous Argentine food. They typically have meat inside, but I found some that were vegetarian-friendly with fillings like mozzarella, basil and tomato, cheese and onion, and humita (a corn filling).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany restaurants I went to only offered wine by the bottle, not by the glass.\n\nArgentina produces some of the world's best wines, including its Malbec, and we sampled many types during our trip.\n\nThe wine menus were a bit different than the ones I'm used to seeing in the US. At many restaurants in Buenos Aires, ordering by the bottle seemed to be more common than ordering by the glass, which wasn't even an option at some places.\n\nRed wine also seemed to be more popular than white or rosé. The few times I was able to order wine by the glass at bars, red was usually the only option.\n\nSome waiters also served red wine with ice in it, likely because I visited during the hot summer months. It was new for me, but I grew to love it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe city is massive and very spread out, but I thought it was easy to navigate.\n\nBuenos Aires is really, really big — about 78 square miles, to be specific — and each neighborhood feels like its own city.\n\nDespite the capital's size, I found it pretty easy to navigate. Being from Los Angeles, it's hard to imagine living in a city without a car, but it isn't completely necessary to have one in Buenos Aires.\n\nThe city is accessible by subway, bus, or taxi, and many of the neighborhoods are walkable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite being such a massive metropolis, Buenos Aires has a lot of green space.\n\nThe capital has stunning, restorative parks tucked away amongst the city's hustle and bustle. I loved that I could find green spaces and nature, such as the Bosques de Palermo and the Jardín Japonés, in such a cosmopolitan city.\n\nI spent many days meandering through the parks, smelling fresh flowers, and watching locals take their afternoon strolls.\n\nMy favorite park in Buenos Aires is El Rosedal. There, I found rose gardens and a large lake where people can rent paddle boats and watch ducks float by. It's a true gem.\n\nEven the streets were lined with trees, and the streets themselves were spick-and-span.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuenos Aires has some of the best sweets I've ever tried, and most include some form of dulce de leche.\n\nAs someone with a sweet tooth, I loved being able to try all the unique treats and candies Argentina has to offer.\n\nDulce de leche — a thick, creamy caramel sauce — is the treat I saw most commonly in Argentina, and it was in a lot of different types of desserts.\n\nFor example, I tried the delightful Vauquita candy bars with dulce-de-leche filling. Traditional alfajores also have a dulce de leche spread between two flaky, soft cookies. Some are coated with milk or white chocolate on the outside.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe architecture in Buenos Aires is heavily influenced by European designs, and the buildings are jaw-droppingly beautiful.\n\nBuenos Aires' architecture has such strong French, Italian, and Spanish influences that I felt as if it transported me to Europe — hence the city's nickname: the Paris of South America.\n\nForeign architects built many of these structures in the early 20th century, when the country's economy was flourishing.\n\nOne of my favorite places in Buenos Aires is the Plaza de Mayo, the city's oldest public square. The Casa Rosada, or \"pink house,\" is there, and it serves as the president's office.\n\nThe exterior is filled with intricate details, arched doorways, and windows. A large Argentine flag waves in front — its light blues, whites, and yellows are a splendor against the pink building.\n\nThe Obelisco is just a short walk away. The massive monument was built in 1936 to commemorate Buenos Aires' fourth centenary and still towers over the city center's busy streets.\n\nRead next\n\nTravel Food\n\nAdvertisement"
