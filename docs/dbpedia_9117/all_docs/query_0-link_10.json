        "text": "Located on the shore of the Rio de la Plata, the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires is the federal capital of Argentina.\n\nBy air\n\nBuenos Aires is served by three airports:\n\n- Ministro Pistarini International Airport, Ezeiza (EZE)\n\nThe biggest airport in Argentina is located in Ezeiza, 32km (20 miles) from the centre of Buenos Aires city. Most long-haul international flights arrive and depart from here, along with some domestic and regional flights. The journey from the airport to the centre of the city takes about 50 minutes.\n\n- Jorge Newbery Airport, known as Aeroparque (AEP)\n\nLocated in the city itself, in the Palermo neighbourhood, this airport is within 25 minutes of the main hotels in Buenos Aires. It serves mainly domestic flights and flights to neighbouring countries.\n\n- El Palomar (EPA)\n\nLocated 18km (11 miles) from the city, El Palomar Airport began serving a range of low-cost domestic flights to destinations throughout Argentina in 2018.\n\nGetting to the city from the airports\n\nTaxis are readily available at all three airports.\n\nPrivate transfers can be booked in advance or on arrival. Tienda León runs buses from Ezeiza airport to its base in Puerto Madero, in the center of Buenos Aires city.\n\nAll three airports are served by public bus lines, and there is also a train station at el Palomar. Nore that services can be crowded at peak times and there is little space for luggage. You'll need a SUBE travel card to use the bus or train. These are available from authorised stockists. We recommend using the app \"BA Cómo Llego\" to check how to arrive at your destination by public transport.\n\nBy coach\n\nThe Terminal de Omnibus de Retiro, or Retiro coach station, provides hundreds of coach services to destinations in Argentina and other Latin American countries. Long-distance bus travel is common in Argentina and most coach companies offer very comfortable \"cama-ejecutivo\" (executive bed) class seats, and often provide food on long-distance services. Dozens of companies operate from the coach station. Tickets can be bought at the booths on the upper floor, at authorised vendors in the city, or online. If in doubt, ask for help at our Tourist Assistance Center at unit 83.\n\nBy boat\n\n- Ferries\n\nThere are regular ferry services between Buenos Aires and Montevideo and Colonia de Sacramento in Uruguay. The ferry terminals in Buenos Aires are located in Puerto Madero and La Boca. The following companies run services:\n\nBuquebus\n\nSeacat\n\nColonia Express\n\n- Cruises\n\nNumerous cruise lines visit Buenos Aires, making the city's cruise terminal one of the most important in the region. The dedicated Quinquela Martín cruise terminal is located in the neighbourhood of Retiro, close to the city centre and the main tourist attractions. Taxis and the city sightseeing tour bus serve the terminal.."
