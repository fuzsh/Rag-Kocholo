By doing this, we will get fully immersed in the cultural diversity of South America’s cities, where a lively pulse of life can be heard from every corner and every tale has a backstory.\n\nThe 7 Most Populous Cities of South America\n\nThe list of the 7 most populous cities in the South America, in descending order population-wise, is as follows:\n\nSão Paulo, Brazil (12.3 million)\n\nLima, Peru (9.5 million)\n\nBogotá, Colombia (8.2 million)\n\nRio de Janeiro, Brazil (6.7 million)\n\nSantiago, Chile (5.6 million)\n\nBuenos Aires, Argentina (3.1 million)\n\nBelo Horizonte, Brazil (2.5 million)\n\n1. São Paulo, Brazil\n\nGiant of industry and cultural vitality, São Paulo is a reflection of Brazil’s population domination. Over 12 million people live in this concrete jungle, which is teeming with the energy of fashion, finance, and a thriving art scene. Its bilingual streets and delicious food are testaments to the multicultural fabric that its immigrant heritage has fashioned.\n\nNotwithstanding, São Paulo’s dense population poses several challenges, socioeconomic inequality and transportation choking continue to be major issues. Yet, this city of contrasts never sleeps, forever evolving and offering new surprises at every corner.\n\nSão Paulo, the capital of Brazil’s most populous state, is located in the Brazilian Highlands on a plateau that is located beyond the Serra do Mar. With a total size of 1,521.11 square kilometers (587.30 square miles), it ranks 8th among the state’s biggest municipalities.\n\nThe biggest urban area in Brazil, covering 949,611 square kilometers (366,647 square miles), is found in this metropolis.

Lima, Peru\n\nThe pace of contemporary Latin America mingles with the hushed murmurs of the Andes in Lima, the City of Kings. Built on layers of history, this thriving metropolis of over 9.5 million people is home to colonial churches, modern skyscrapers, and pre-Columbian ruins.\n\nThe population of Lima is varied, reflecting the city’s attraction as a crossroads for cultures, drawing people from all across the Andes. This fusion of the old and the new creates a vibrant food scene where traditional dishes can be found at both busy street markets and Michelin-starred restaurants.\n\nThe main and capital city of Peru, Lima, is situated in the country’s central coastal area, with a view of the Pacific Ocean and borders shared by the Rímac, Chillón, and Lurín Rivers.

It makes up the Lima Metropolitan Area, which has 10,151,200 residents overall and 11,342,100 residents when the constitutional province of Callao is taken into account.\n\nThe agricultural area known as Limaq gave rise to Lima, which subsequently became the capital of both the Republic of Peru and the Viceroyalty of Peru. The Lima metro area is home to around one-third of Peru’s population. The 2019 Pan American Games, APEC Meetings, IMF and World Bank Group Annual Meetings, United Nations Climate Change Conference, and the Miss Universe 1982 pageant are just a few of the big events Lima has held.\n\nAbout 800 square kilometers (310 square miles) make up the urban area. It is primarily flat, with valleys and mountain slopes rising up to 1,550 meters (5,090 feet) above sea level, typical of the Peruvian coastal plain.\n\nThe ethnic composition of Lima’s population is diversified, consisting of mestizos, European Peruvians, Amerindians, Afro-Peruvians, and Asian groups, mostly of Chinese and Japanese origin.

This makes the city highly populated. Rural-to-urban migration has been a major trend in the 20th and 21st centuries, driven by industrialization and societal problems including poverty and crime.\n\nThere is a sizable floating population in the city, believed to number up to 4 million, primarily made up of displaced persons and migrant laborers. Government initiatives to import capital goods, with the city serving as a major destination for these imports, support Bogotá’s role as a major economic and industrial hub.\n\nRead Also: Most Populous Countries in South America\n\n4.

This city, which is always balancing innovation and tradition, offers a window into Chile’s bright future.\n\nSantiago is the main and capital city of Chile, sometimes referred to as Santiago de Chile, and it is situated in the central valley of the country. Several major firms have their regional headquarters located there, making it the political, financial, and industrial hub of Chile. With millions of people living in the Santiago Metropolitan Region, the city accounts for 40% of Chile’s total population.\n\nOver the course of its history, Santiago has seen substantial population expansion due to migration from rural and mining settlements as well as high fertility rates. Alongside the city’s growth has come urban development, as seen by the expansive suburban regions and contemporary skyline.\n\nWith a strong economy that accounts for 45% of Chile’s GDP and a low level of public debt, Santiago is a popular destination for immigrants from both the US and Europe. The metropolis is home to South America’s largest subway system, the Metro de Santiago, as well as a burgeoning theater and restaurant scene, a plethora of retail malls, and other contemporary transit facilities.\n\nSantiago is characterized by socioeconomic differences, with the western part of the city often being poorer than the eastern communes, despite its economic boom.\n\nRead Also: Top 10 Coldest Countries\n\n6.
