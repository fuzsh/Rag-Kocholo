        "text": "With a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of approximately US$640 billion, Argentina is one of the largest economies in Latin America.\n\nArgentina has vast natural resources in energy and agriculture. Within its 2.8 million square kilometers of territory, Argentina is endowed with extraordinary fertile lands, gas, and lithium reserves, and has great potential for renewable energy. Argentina is a leading food producer with large-scale agricultural and livestock industries. In addition, Argentina has significant opportunities in some manufacturing subsectors, and innovative services in high tech industries.\n\nThe economy contracted by 1.6 percent in 2023, due to persistent macroeconomic imbalances and a severe drought that led to a 26 percent decline in agricultural production over the year.\n\nReal GDP is estimated to contract by an additional 2.8 percent in 2024, due to the stabilization plan being implemented by the new government, which includes the realignment of relative prices and the elimination of fiscal and external imbalances. The economy is expected to grow by 5 percent in 2025, driven by improved weather conditions, investments in the energy sector, and the normalization of agricultural production.\n\nInflation rose sharply in December 2023, driven by the effect of a devaluation of the official exchange rate and the removal of price controls. Month-over-month inflation peaked at 25.5 percent in December, declining to 13.2 percent by February. The government implemented social protection measures that included doubling in nominal terms the main social programs (universal child allowance and food support) and extraordinary bonuses for low-income retirees. Although social assistance is well targeted, the real value of social benefits, including pensions and social transfers, has fallen by 30 percent year-on-year by February 2024.\n\nArgentina is under a 30-months Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In January 2024, the IMF Executive Board completed the seventh review of the program. In line with the government's new program, the EFF is focused on implementing a sound fiscal consolidation plan with the objective of achieving a primary surplus of 2 percent of GDP by 2024. This fiscal consolidation plan, coupled with a supportive monetary stance to combat inflation and simplification of the foreign exchange (FX) regime, is expected to result in an accumulation of approximately $10 billion in net international reserves by the end of 2024.\n\nThe stabilization program implemented by the new administration has yielded fiscal results. In January and February 2024, Argentina ran fiscal surpluses for the first time in many years. Inflation is also starting to come down, but it remains at high levels. Country risk has also fallen, from 2,100 points in January to 1,432 in March 2024. However, it remains one of the highest in the region.\n\nLast Updated: Apr 02, 2024\n\nThe World Bank is a long-term strategic partner of Argentina. The Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for 2019-2022 seeks to contribute to reducing poverty through promoting sustainable and inclusive growth. A review of the CPF was carried out in 2022, which lead to a redesign of some of the objectives due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe main areas of work are:\n\n1. Supporting inclusive recovery\n\nThe focus of this area is recovering from the current crisis and setting the foundations for inclusive growth, as well as creating the conditions for private job creation and investment. This area also supports improving effectiveness of public policies and investments, enhancing urban mobility to provide safe and inclusive access to jobs, improving living conditions, improving access to financing – with a focus on small and medium enterprises and marginalized groups – and providing analytical support to prioritize public investments, focus social protection measures, and, to reform tariffs and subsidies for fiscal impact while protecting the poor.\n\n2. Strengthening service delivery to protect the poor and vulnerable\n\nStrengthening service delivery to protect the poor and vulnerable is another key area of the strategy. Moreover, it prioritizes the education sector, with the aim of improving learning outcomes in secondary education and skills building capacity to enter the labor market. It continues also to support the implementation of a universal healthcare coverage system in the provinces.\n\nEnhancing the efficiency of public administration is another key area. It will do so by seeking to strengthen inter-jurisdictional coordination with the goal of improving basic public service delivery such as water and sanitation.\n\n3. Supporting climate measures and long-term sustainable growth\n\nThe main objectives of this area are transitioning to a cleaner energy matrix, making the rural economy more climate smart, and supporting a resilient economy. This key area involves reducing local pollution, managing, and protecting natural resources and biodiversity, and building a more sustainable economy.\n\nLast Updated: Oct 02, 2023"
