        "text": "Montevideo is often thought of as the “little sister” to Buenos Aires. While both cities share similar cultures, delicious cuisine, intriguing history, and of course, the Rio de la Plata, Montevideo encapsulates a more tranquil, low-key vibe. There are a nice variety of activities, since Montevideo has a vibrant music, theater, and arts scene, as well as many museums, notable sports teams, and outdoor leisure spaces. As one of Latin America’s most liberal cities, you’ll feel right at home in no time.\n\nThe city also has an international feel to it, thanks to its many cultural centers and its role as administrative headquarters for Mercosur and ALADI, Latin America’s trading blocs, which has led to Montevideo being compared to the role of Brussels in Europe. Due to its location and economic stability, the city is also becoming a huge player in the entrepreneurial and technological spaces.\n\nOne of Montevideo’s greatest assets is its location on the coast and its vast open spaces, inclusive of the “Rambla” that runs the whole coastline of the city. This 22-kilometer ocean-side promenade is a perfect place to take a break from the office, do some fitness, or watch the sky change colors during sunset. Plus, Montevideo is known for being one of the safest capital cities in all of Latin America, as well as South America's highest ranking city for quality of living."
