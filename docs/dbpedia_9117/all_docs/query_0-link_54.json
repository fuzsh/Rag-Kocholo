        "text": "While the Four Seasons’ main building and mixed-style lounge decor are less dramatic than some of the city’s more stylish properties, the hotel’s mansion, a magnificent Louis XIII–style edifice built in 1916, houses beautiful and traditional suites well-suited to high-rollers, heads of state and celebrities. The adjacent contemporary tower, which is somewhat charmless, contains the other 158 rooms and suites, all spacious and recently refurbished in a neutral color palette. The mansion view rooms are preferable over the city view as these unfortunately look over a highway.\n\nThe Cielo spa, which offers all-natural treatments, ranks among the city’s best, and the restaurant Elena and Pony Line Bar are chic destinations for well-heeled locals as well as guests. In summer the hotel now offers traditional asados, or Argentine open-fire barbecues, on a rooftop garden. Perhaps the biggest draw is the heated outdoor pool, located in the garden. Although it’s not large, it’s an appealing amenity to families and a wonderful place to take an afternoon break from touring during the summer months, from November through March.\n\nThough the palace side of the hotel, which faces Avenida Alvear, is a restored mansion built in 1934, the newly constructed adjoining building (where nearly all of the 165 rooms and suites are located) features a majestic lobby awash in Bordeaux leather and travertine marble and a soaring ceiling. The gentleman’s club–style Oak Bar (a favorite aperitivo and nightcap spot of well-heeled locals), Vinoteca wine bar and cheese room and the expansive gardens have a classical feel, yet Park Hyatt’s cool brand of minimalism kicks in at its impressive underground art gallery and exhibition area, 8,000-square-foot spa and fitness studio (with an eighty-two-foot indoor swimming pool), and within many of the rooms and suites. And while the twenty-three guest rooms of the palace boast Persian carpets, silk curtains and antique crystal chandeliers, those in the modern tower have a minimalist, Asian-inspired ambiance."
