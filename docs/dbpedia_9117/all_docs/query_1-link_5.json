        "text": "The Autonomous City of Buenos Aires is the capital of the Argentine Republic. It is located in the central eastern region of the country, on the western bank of the Río de la Plata estuary, in the pampas plains. It has an estimated population of almost 3 million, with 12 million in its urban conglomerate, known as Gran Buenos Aires, which makes it the country’s largest urban area, the second in South America and the southern hemisphere, and one of the twenty biggest cities in the world.\n\nHISTORY\n\nThe City of Buenos Aires had two foundings: it was first founded by Pedro de Mendoza in 1536 and it was destroyed in 1541 by its own citizens. In 1580, Juan de Garay founded it for the second time. Both foundings took place under the rule of the Viceroyalty of Peru, which was a colony of the Spanish Empire. In 1810, the citizens initiated the May Revolution, which resulted in the expulsion of the viceroy, the establishment of an autonomous government council and the beginning of Argentina’s independence war. Under Bartolomé Mitre’s administration, the Commitment Law [Ley de Compromiso] was enacted, which made the city the seat of both the National Government and the provincial public authorities. Finally, in 1880, the city was federalized and, since 1994, it has had an Autonomous Government, whose authorities are chosen by the people through direct election."
