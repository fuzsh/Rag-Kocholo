Then, a man with short hair and suit, Facundo Gómez Minujín, speaks from an office overlooking Buenos Aires.\n\nText on screen:\n\nFacundo Gómez Minujín, CEO, Argentina, Uruguay, Bolivia, and Paraguay, J.P. Morgan.\n\nFacundo Minujín:\n\nWe have been in Argentina since 1948. We have been here for many, many years and we have a meaningful and strong commitment to the country. This is a bank that has never left Argentina, even during the hardest of times, during the crises we had. J.P. Morgan has always been present helping clients and helping the community. This commitment to clients, to the community, and to our employees is very important to us.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA montage shows Mr. Minujín strolling outside a high-rise office building and walking in a J.P. Morgan lobby past a decorative abstract sculpture.\n\nFacundo Minujín:\n\nFor several years now, our goal at J.P. Morgan has been to help all foundations dedicated to what we call education and labor insertion.\n\nOn screen:\n\nThe flag of Argentina waves in a breeze.\n\nText on screen:\n\nJ.P. Morgan Chase and Company is committed to the Argentine market.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA montage shows J.P. Morgan employees working at their computer desks in a spacious open office area.\n\nFacundo Minujín:\n\nThis means working with NGOs, with foundations in Argentina, that are committed to the entire process of educating people in specific skills that would then enable them to secure employment.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA J.P. Morgan manager gives a slide presentation in an auditorium. An instructor speaks to a classroom of young adults. A montage shows Mr. Minujín greeting community leaders and working with smiling young members of his team.\n\nFacundo Minujín:\n\nThis commitment we have to the region is something that will continue in the future. We have significant expansion and growth plans.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA montage shows different locations in Argentina, including a spacious plaza outside a large J.P. Morgan office building, modern bridges crossing a river with high-rise buildings in the distance, a silver abstract flower sculpture in a park reflecting a cloudy sky, and a bustling avenue in a large city.\n\nFacundo Minujín:\n\nAll the different lines of business cross in Argentina and in the countries we cover here as well, as Uruguay, Bolivia and Paraguay. It is very important to our customers that we can provide our services anywhere. Not only within the region but also worldwide.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA montage shows different cities in South America.\n\nFacundo Minujín:\n\nSeveral years ago, here in Argentina, we decided to create a service center, the Buenos Aires Corporate Center, BACC. Today, we are around 3,000 people and we'll continue to grow.\n\nOn screen:\n\nIn the Buenos Aires Corporate Center building, business professionals review financial information on desktop computers and collaborate in conference rooms.\n\nFacundo Minujín:\n\nOur clients appreciate that we have always been present in Argentina. J.P. Morgan has always remained stable in the country. This is very important because clients value the continuous presence and the opportunity to help them during good times but also during tough times.\n\nOn screen:\n\nMr. Minujín walks past the iconic Obelisk of Buenos Aires in the in the Plaza de la República.\n\nFacundo Minujín:\n\nWe are a global bank with a very large scale and present everywhere. That is what makes J.P. Morgan unique.\n\nOn screen:\n\nMr. Minujín pins a blue and white Argentina ribbon flag on his lapel. Smiling, he stands by a member of the Argentine Honor Guard.\n\nLogo:\n\nJ.P.Morgan.\n\nSide note:\n\nLegal disclosures appear.\n\nText on screen:\n\nCopyright 2022 JPMorgan Chase & Co.
