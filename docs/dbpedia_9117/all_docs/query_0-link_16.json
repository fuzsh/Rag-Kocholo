        "text": "Transcript\n\nNARRATOR: Buenos Aires has been called the Paris of South America. This city is glamorous and gloomy at once, hectic and contemplative, sad and joyous. Over 11 million people live here, and most of them have the tango in their blood. But San Telmo, the city's oldest district is where the tango's true heart is in this city, a city no one leaves feeling lukewarm about.\n\nSUSANNE LORENZ: \"I think you either love or hate Buenos Aires. It is loud, dirty and full of traffic. If you prefer and cherish peace and quiet, you are better off in Hamburg. The quality of life is certainly different, but here there is life, energy and it is very dynamic. Life takes place on the streets, people interact with each other. You have to be very alert.\"\n\nNARRATOR: Buenos Aires has many faces. Every district is different. Locals call the Recoleta Via Freud, because it has the largest concentration of psychotherapist practices in the world. In Palermo Viejo, on the other hand, everything is cool and stylish and full of classy boutiques, fancy restaurants and small designer hotels. This quarter was once peppered with crumbling car repair shops, today it costs a fortune to buy real estate here. Martin Frank came here from New York and, like most Argentina's modern-day immigrants, is rich and educated.\n\nMARTIN FRANK: \"The people that come to Palermo Viejo are a very mixed bunch, both young and old. They are people who like to look good, they like nice things, nice homes and nice furniture. They enjoy spending two hours in a caf√© just talking and enjoying life.\"\n\nNARRATOR: In Latin America the contrasts between rich and poor are very pronounced, and Buenos Aires is no exception. Nearly one in every 10 inhabitants lives below the poverty line, in one of the city's many slums and shanty towns. Not all of Buenos Aires is beautiful. Buenos Aires is a city with many faces and lots of tension. It is an interesting, modern city that elicits great emotions the very moment you come into contact with it."
