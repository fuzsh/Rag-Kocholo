        "text": "< Back to World map\n\nBuenos Aires\n\nBy Fernando Arlettaz\n\nBuenos Aires, the capital of Argentina, is the country's economic and political centre. With three millions inhabitants, it is the most populous city of the country. Buenos Aires is undoubtedly a global city. This report analyses the multiple roles of Buenos Aires as an international actor and the city’s framing in international law structures. In doing so, this report discusses the city’s cooperation agreements with foreign cities and regions, its access to international markets to seek financing, its host role for international organisations and lastly the influence of international norms and standards on Buenos Aires’ local policies."
