        "text": "The Argentina Republic is the second largest country in Latin America with a territorial extension, in South America, of 2,791,810 km2 (1,077,923.86 square miles) also including territories in Antarctica and the Atlantic Ocean. The Country is located in the southern part of South America and shares borders with Bolivia, Paraguay, Chile, Uruguay, and Brazil.\n\nThe country is divided into 24 jurisdictions. There are 23 provinces and the federal district that holds the national capital, Buenos Aires.\n\nCountry Overview Year Figure Population 2021 45,808,747 Country Area (km2) 2021 2,791,810 GDP (billion USD) 2021 491.49 GDP per capita (USD) 2021 10,729.2 World Bank Income 2021 Upper-middle Income World Bank Region 2021 Latin America and\n\nSource: World Bank Data Argentina\n\nWater and Wastewater Sector Structure\n\nThe water and Sanitation Sector in Argentina is marked by local water and sanitation service providers. The provinces have the legal authority to set the regulatory framework for water and sanitation service provision in their area. That gives the plurality and diversity of regulatory environments and organizations provisioning services.\n\nAccording to estimations by the federal government, there are around 1400 water and sanitation service providers in the country. Their legal nature varies and can be public companies, private companies with state participation, local state department, and local service cooperatives\n\nAn example of that regulatory system can be found in the administration of the Capital Buenos Aires. There, water and sanitation services are provided by a company called Argentian Water and Sanitation Services (AySA) which is regulated by a provincial regulatory agency (The Water and Sanitation Regulatory Entity - ERAS) with its own legal instrument.\n\nAuthority Level Role National Directorate for Water and Sanitation National Formulation of sectoral policies and related programs, as well as the medium and long-term planning for investments and the monitoring of the quality of services to achieve universal access to water and sanitation. Argentian Water and Sanitation Services (AySA) Local Water And Sanitation Utility for the Buenos Aires province Water and Sanitation Entity Local Regulates and Controls the water and sanitation service provision in the province of Buenos Aires National Entity for Water and Sanitation Works (ENOHSA) National Fund and execute water and sanitation infrastructure development in the country Provincial Governments Local Responsible for the ownership and regulation of water and sanitation service provision in their areas. National Water Institute National Responsible for the research and development of projects and activities related to water use and conservation.\n\nThe regulation of water and sanitation service provision in Argentina is marked by a decentralized approach. That is characterized by the regions and provinces having the mandate and possibility of approving their own regulatory marks and the service provision titularity in the area.\n\nGiven the degree of decentralization, there is no central regulatory authority. Rather, there is the National Directorate for Water and Sanitation (Dirección Nacional de Agua Potable y Saneamiento) that works to support the provincial authorities. Part of this support is the elaboration of the National Plan for the sector and the National Information System for water and sanitation Service Providers.\n\nThe organizational structure also includes:\n\nNational Water and Sanitation Information Database: A national tool that collects information on key performance aspects of water and sanitation utilities as well as the generation of sectoral reports, with the aim of improving the planning of public policies for the sector\n\nWater and Wastewater Regulations\n\nLegistarion and Policies Year Description National Consitution 1853 Sets the provinces as the owners of service provisions and is legally responsible for its regulations.
