        "text": "Terrorism\n\nThere is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.\n\nUK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.\n\nTerrorism in Argentina\n\nTerrorist attacks in Argentina cannot be ruled out.\n\nAttacks could be indiscriminate including in places visited by foreign nationals. Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.\n\nPolitical situation\n\nPolitical protests\n\nPolitical demonstrations and picketing are more common in Argentina than in the UK. Some demonstrations attract large numbers of people, and they can occasionally turn violent. Demonstrations are particularly common near Congress (‘Congreso’) and the Presidential Palace (‘Casa Rosada’).\n\nYou should:\n\navoid all protests, demonstrations and marches\n\nexercise normal caution at any large gathering\n\nbe aware of your surroundings\n\nmonitor the local news\n\nfollow the advice of local authorities\n\nThere have also been occasional Falklands-related protests, including outside the British Embassy and British-affiliated businesses in Argentina.\n\nDemonstrations\n\nGroups of demonstrators (‘piqueteros’) sometimes block major roads at times of social unrest. These can include the major routes into and out of Buenos Aires City. This can cause significant delays.\n\nWhen planning to travel:\n\nmonitor the local news\n\ndo not attempt to cross blockades\n\nfollow the advice of local authorities\n\nCrime\n\nProtecting your belongings\n\nThieves and pickpockets operate on public transport and at bus and train terminals.\n\nTo reduce the risk of theft:\n\nalways keep a close eye on your personal possessions – do not hang bags on the back of seats\n\ncarry cash out of sight or close to you – a money belt under your clothes is the safest option\n\nyou may need to produce your passport when paying with a credit card, but keep a copy somewhere safe\n\nkeep your bags close while you are checking into a hotel or hostel – thieves posing as hotel guests can snatch them\n\nThefts from unattended vehicles, especially hire cars, are also common.\n\nStreet crime and scams\n\nIn crowded places, thieves can cut handbags open. They can snatch a mobile phone while you are using it on the street. Thieves on motorbikes can snatch bags from pedestrians.\n\nThieves – often women – use distraction techniques and may work in teams of 2 or more. A common form of distraction theft reported in Buenos Aires is the ‘mustard scam’. Thieves take your bags while an accomplice pretends to help you remove mustard they have sprayed on you. If this happens to you, politely but firmly refuse help and walk away.\n\nIn Buenos Aires, be particularly cautious in:\n\nPalermo\n\nSan Telmo\n\nLa Boca\n\nRetiro\n\nFlorida Street\n\n9 de Julio\n\nAvenida de Mayo\n\nAvenida Rivadavia near the obelisk\n\nthe Retiro Bus terminal\n\nIn Mendoza, be particularly cautious downtown.\n\nViolent crime\n\nArmed robberies are a risk – be especially vigilant in:\n\nLa Boca, Buenos Aires – avoid the streets outside the Caminito tourist area and stay in the designated tourist area where there are high-visibility police patrols\n\nRosario Province, Santa Fe\n\nIn early 2024, following an increase in violent crime in Rosario, the authorities deployed additional security forces to maintain public order. If you are planning to travel to Rosario, exercise a high degree of caution, monitor the media and follow the advice of the local authorities\n\nIf you are the victim of a robbery, hand over your cash and valuables without resistance.\n\nCriminal kidnapping\n\nKidnappings including ‘express kidnappings’ – short-term opportunistic abductions – occasionally happen in Argentina. Victims of express kidnap are held and forced to empty their bank accounts by making bank transfers or going to ATMs, after which they are normally quickly released. Be aware of your surroundings and always let someone you trust know your whereabouts. If you are a victim of kidnapping, follow the kidnapper’s instructions.\n\nTo reduce your risk:\n\navoid wearing expensive clothing or jewellery, particularly in public\n\navoid casual taxis – see Transport risks\n\nbe vigilant, especially at night\n\nDrink and food spiking and scams\n\nDrinks and food can be spiked and could put you at risk of robbery or assault. Do not leave drinks unattended in bars and restaurants and do not accept food or drink from strangers.\n\nBe alert to the possible use of ‘date rape’ and other drugs. Alcohol and drugs can reduce your vigilance, making you less in control.\n\nThere have been reports of foreign tourists being robbed or assaulted after inviting into their accommodation someone they have recently met, online or in person.\n\nLaws and cultural differences\n\nIllegal drugs and prison sentences\n\nDo not become involved with illegal drugs of any kind. Possession of even very small quantities can lead to a lengthy prison sentence.\n\nLGBT+ travellers\n\nArgentine society is open and diverse. Discrimination based on sexual orientation is rare. Same-sex marriage is legal. Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.\n\nLegal action against oil and gas companies\n\nThe government of Argentina has stated that it intends to pursue legal action against oil and gas companies engaged in hydrocarbon exploration in the Falkland Islands. If you’re travelling to Argentina and think you may be affected by this type of legal action, seek independent legal advice.\n\nOutdoor activities and adventure tourism\n\nIf you take part in extreme or adventure sports, including paragliding, climbing, off-road driving and hot air ballooning, make sure:\n\nadequate safety precautions are in place\n\nyou only use reputable operators and insist on training\n\nyour travel insurance covers all the activities you want to undertake and includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation\n\nYou will have to pay for most helicopter rescues, including in Mount Aconcagua.\n\nAltitude sickness is a risk when hiking in parts of Argentina. See Health.\n\nTransport risks\n\nRoad travel\n\nIf you are planning to drive in Argentina, see information on driving abroad.\n\nYou’ll need to have both the 1949 version of the international driving permit (IDP) and your UK driving licence with you in the car. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.\n\nRespect for speed limits and traffic signals varies. Drivers can make unexpected turns or brake suddenly.\n\nVehicle crime is a problem. Always keep car windows closed and doors locked when driving in major cities.\n\nTake care when driving in the province of Misiones, close to the borders with Paraguay and Brazil. The area is used to smuggle goods. Seek local advice from customs officials if you intend to drive in this area.\n\nTaxis\n\nBook taxis in advance if possible. If you hail a taxi in the street, only use a ‘radio taxi’. These have a clearly visible logo on the car doors.\n\nThe Buenos Aries government has a list of authorised radio taxi operators (in Spanish).\n\nAir travel\n\nFlights from Argentina can be unreliable. Check for delays or cancellations before travelling to the airport.\n\nSea travel\n\nActivist groups sometimes try to disrupt UK-flagged ships or commercial shipping working off the Falkland Islands. Contact the local authorities before travelling. Most cruise ships and visiting tourists should not be affected.\n\nExtreme weather and natural disasters\n\nFind out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards.\n\nFlooding\n\nMany northern provinces experience occasional flooding. This can disrupt transport and could lead to shortages. Flash floods can occur during heavy rains, in provinces including Buenos Aires. Monitor local media and follow instructions given by the local authorities.\n\nEarthquakes\n\nThere is a risk of earthquakes in Argentina, particularly in the provinces of Mendoza, San Juan, Salta and Jujuy. Monitor media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.\n\nThe US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.\n\nVolcanic eruptions\n\nThe Copahue Volcano on the Argentina-Chile border erupts occasionally, and the authorities will evacuate the area. If you’re travelling to this area, monitor local media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities."
