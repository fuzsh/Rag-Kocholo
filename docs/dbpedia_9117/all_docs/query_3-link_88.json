        "text": "If you cannot make up your mind about what to do on New Year’s Eve in Buenos Aires this post has you covered!\n\nIn the city that never sleeps, New Year’s Eve is not an exception. But… where to go when there are so many options to choose from?\n\nFirst of all, we have to mention that, unlike other major cities in the world, there is no one specific public place where people congregate for the countdown in Buenos Aires. And even though Argentina is a former Spanish colony, we don’t have the tradition of eating twelve grapes at midnight like they do. But something that can be assured is that there are plenty of options for all ages and budgets.\n\nNumber one recommendation: plan ahead!\n\nArgentines are famous for being fashionably late: usually when they invite you to a party at 10 PM, it will be fine if you get there at 10:30 or even 11 PM… and nothing will be ready if you get there on time. But New Year’s Eve is the exception: get there on time, and plan ahead as most venues get fully booked soon and you will rarely find a place without reservation.\n\nAlso, if you are heading to someone else’s house or hosting your own dinner party, take into consideration that shops and supermarkets will close early, so make sure you buy everything beforehand. In this case, you also have to think about transportation to that house and then coming back, as service is limited on that day.\n\nTango Shows\n\nOne of the most original ways to celebrate this date is by booking a New Year’s Eve Tango Show. It includes a mouth-watering three course dinner, open bar, a champagne toast at midnight and, of course, a breathtaking tango spectacle.\n\nAfter midnight, most tango houses turn into a party with a special DJ, so you can dance your night away.\n\nThe most famous tango show that offers New Year’s Eve Special Dinner is Madero Tango with its Masquerade Party. Don’t worry about not having a mask: they will provide you with one and then you take it as a souvenir. This tango house is located in Puerto Madero, and as a plus it offers a great view of the best fireworks in the city.\n\nTheir package includes transportation from your hotel, and shuttles to take you back after midnight every half an hour.\n\nBut there is something very traditional about Argentinian parties: music continues till dawn, so breakfast is also included in their proposal. This is wonderful and unique.\n\nOur recommendation: take a nap during the day and learn first hand why Buenos Aires is known for having some of the longest nightlife in the world.\n\nTake a look at the best Tango Shows in town.\n\nExclusive Hotel Parties\n\nIf tango is not your cup of tea, but you still would like to attend a high-end venue, then the exclusive hotel parties will be the best option for you to have a stylish evening in Buenos Aires during New Year’s Eve.\n\nMost top hotels will offer extravagant dinner parties, being the Alvear Palace Hotel, in Recoleta neighborhood, one of the preferred choices for its gala night. Their offer starts with a 7-step menu, paired with exquisite Argentine wines and will close the night with music to welcome the New Year.\n\nBut if you would like a unique evening for the last night of the year, then Faena Hotel in Puerto Madero will be the right option for you. They offer live entertainment, musical acts, delicious feasts, and, for sure, luxurious décor. Each year they select a new theme for this special event, and the one to welcome 2022 has to do with renewing the spirit to get ready for a new beginning. This is a top choice that for sure will exceed your expectations as every detail is taken into consideration.\n\nIn both cases you can also opt for the complete package that also includes accommodation, breakfast and spa access. If you would like us to help us find the best package for you, please send us a message and we will be happy to assist you.\n\nSpecial Dinner at a restaurant\n\nEven though many restaurants close for Christmas and New Year’s Eve in Buenos Aires, there are a handful of options that may be suitable for you if you are looking for a more accessible alternative than hotel venues, but still would like to enjoy a high quality dinner.\n\nMost options will be in Puerto Madero neighborhood, where some of the most famous Steak Houses in Buenos Aires are located. They offer a special menu and making a reservation in advance is mandatory.\n\nPuerto Cristal, with its key location, will be throwing a live music show this year (2021/2022), an exquisite dinner and from row seats to get the best view of the city’s traditional firework display.\n\nStreet Party\n\nNew Year’s Eve dinner in Argentina is traditionally a very family-oriented affair. But after the final countdown, and when the toast is over, Argentinians head up to the streets to celebrate with their friends and the party goes till the sunrise.\n\nPalermo is the trendiest neighborhood in Buenos Aires, and the party’s Mecca, with the best nightlife scene in town. But on New Year’s Eve, the choice is not a pub or discotheque: partying takes place on the streets! If you want to party where young Argentines go, look no further: head to Plaza Cortázar (a.k.a Plaza Serrano) in Palermo Soho, or to the intersection of Ravignani and Gorriti streets in Palermo Hollywood. Put on comfortable shoes, bring your own drink or grab some beer or Fernet con coca from one of the roadside drinks vendors from the local bars and get ready to have the best night of the year.\n\nPuerto Madero is the other area in Buenos Aires that has a great atmosphere for New Year’s Eve. Every year, it hosts a delightful firework display over the Rio de la Plata and is way quieter than Palermo, so if you are not interested in partying hard, then this may be the best option for you. However, these areas still tend to get pretty crowded so be aware of your belongings.\n\nFinal recommendations\n\nBuenos Aires is known for its nightlife, that is a fact. No matter which day of the week we are on, there will always be something to do in the so called city that never sleeps.\n\nIn this part of the world, friendship and family relations are extremely important, and if there is an excuse to celebrate, we will prepare something special to have for dinner, grab some drinks, and dance till the lights go down.\n\nSo, to make the most of New Year’s Eve in Buenos Aires:\n\nPlan ahead what you will do and where you will go.\n\nBook your table at a restaurant, hotel or tango show if you are dining out.\n\nIf you are hosting a dinner party at home or a rented apartment, don’t forget to buy everything in advance.\n\nTake into consideration that on 1st January, EVERYTHING will be closed.\n\nIf you need to move around the city, taxis normally will work till 9 PM on New Year’s Eve and then they will be back to business after roughly 1 AM. It is important to have some pocket money available.\n\nStreet parties will be at their best after 2 AM.\n\nWe hope this post helps you make the most out of your stay in Buenos Aires during New Year’s Eve."
