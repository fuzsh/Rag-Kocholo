        "text": "Visitors to the cosmopolitan capital of Argentina might think they’ve stumbled upon Europe and not Latin America. The ethnically diverse port city of Buenos Aires, which stretches along the southern shore of Rio de la Plata (Silver River), has a strong European influence with the majority of the population being of Italian, German or Spanish origin. As a result, the city’s architectural style heavily reflects Baroque and French Neoclassical models, giving justice to the city’s nickname as the “Paris of South America”.\n\nThe beautiful Porteños (people of the port) of Buenos Aires take pride in knowing that their city is the cultural hub of all Argentina. Here, travelers can try what are arguably the best cuts of meat in the world; dance the night away thanks to a thriving nightlife that rivals that of European capitals; visit some of the best art museums in all of Latin America; and see masters perform the world’s sexiest dance, the tango.\n\nFootball fans will recognize Buenos Aires, the city of “Fine Airs”, as the home to the world famous Boca Juniors football club, the club who gave birth to legendary football player Diego Maradona. Extreme sport fans who wish to trek the Patagonia and ski in Bariloche usually use this metropolis as the start-off point of their Argentina travel adventure; and with so much to see and do in capital city, it would perhaps be a mistake to start anywhere else.\n\nGeography and Climate\n\nThe Federal District of Buenos Aires lies across 78.3 sq miles (202 sq kilometers) of fertile pampa plains that make up this region of the country bordered by the Atlantic Ocean coast to the west. Home to some three million people who populate the 48 districts (or barrios) of this port city, the remaining 11 million residents live in the surrounding 24 municipalities than make up the metropolis of Greater Buenos Aires, therefore making it one of the ten most populated cities in the world. With one in three Argentines living in Buenos Aires proper, the rapidly modernizing region has always been a desired place to live and visit for natives. However, since main attractions, cultural events, nightlife, etc. are located in the federal district, most tourism is concentrated within this area that only stretches 12 miles (19 k) north to south and 11 miles (17 k) east to west.\n\nBoasting generally mild weather all year long, travelers can visit Buenos Aires virtually any time of year and enjoy an amiable subtropical climate perfect for sight-seeing. The winter season, can get cold but is regulated by the South Atlantic, with the remaining three seasons of spring, summer and fall being a-kin to those of New York City: mild and pleasant with bouts of humid days during the summer. During those hot summer days, porteños escape the city center for cooler areas of the Buenos Aires province, but tourists can take advantage of the lack of crowds during these days. Cold fronts have been known to occur, but rarely, with the most recent 2007 one leaving the city covered in a blanket of snow – something that hadn’t occurred in decades. Rainfall, however, is common during the summer months, with the city receiving an annual rainfall of 900 mm per year.\n\nBuenos Aires Winter\n\nThe perfect time to take advantage of Buenos Aires’ café culture, the average temperatures during the winter months (June-August) range from 7°C (45°F) to 17°C (63°F).\n\nBuenos Aires Summer\n\nThe average temperatures for summer (December-February) in this metropolis range from 17°C (63°F) to 30°C (87°F).\n\nBuenos Aires Spring/Fall:\n\nArguably the best time to visit Buenos Aires, the spring (September-November) and fall (March-May) months boast the perfect climate with highs of 26°C (80°F) and lows of 10°C (50°F)\n\nGetting to Buenos Aires\n\nAs the capital city and the main tourist draw for Argentina, Buenos Aires serves as the chief transportation hub for the entire country and is easily accessible by most forms of transit.\n\nBuenos Aires Airport Information\n\nSituated in the suburbs of the Great Buenos Aires area is the Ezeiza International Airport (also known as Aeropuerto Internacional Ministro Pistarini), 30-45 minutes drive from downtown Buenos Aires. For international departures it is recommended that travelers arrive three hours ahead of time for an international flight and two hours for a national departure, therefore it is recommended to keep peak hour traffic hours in mind.\n\nBuenos Aires Airport Departure tax\n\nAs with many cities in Latin America, there is a departure tax that must be paid when leaving the country. Currently, the rate is US $18 for international flights and US $8 for regional flights. Since this tax is paid separately during your check-in, it is best to arrive early to allow ample time should lines be long.\n\nBuenos Aires Airport Shops and Services\n\nAs expected of any international airport, visitors to this capital city’s terminal will find an array of restaurants, cafes and bars, as well as a duty-free shop, pharmacies, currency exchange outlets, ATM’s and a 24-hour bank. To make your arrival or departure more convenient, the Buenos Aires airport also features a tourist information desk (Terminal A), a left-luggage facility, medical service and a VIP lounge with internet access.\n\nBuenos Aires Bus Information\n\nThe major bus transportation hub in Buenos Aires is the Retiro bus station where buses come in and go out to cities and towns all over Argentina and to other countries. This well-organized and very large bus hub is located on the northern side of the city center and serves this metropolis with frequent national and international bus services that vary on quality of seating and amenities depending on price, something that should be taken into account when traveling long distances. Less expensive bus companies can be found at the smaller bus terminal located in the Liniers neighborhood.\n\nMany taxis stop by the Retiro bus station, therefore hailing a cab should not be difficult. The Subte (metro) is also conveniently connected to this bustling station, and many local buses make a stop outside, as well. Inside the terminal travelers will find waiting areas, shops, cafes and more conveniences.\n\nGetting around Buenos Aires\n\nBuenos Aires is a city that is made for walking. A good portion of the city grid is divided into equal squares with block numbers in the hundreds. This combined with the fact that the terrain is very flat should inspire travelers to walk around the beautiful capital and get to know it on a more intimate level. City maps, usually including all bus routes, are readily available at the local tourist authority or at the Ezeiza Airport, as well as through publishers Guía T and LUMI.\n\nThough if you’re not much of a walker, you’ll be happy to know that the Buenos Aires subway system is very efficient and will take you to most tourist attractions in the city. Another economical form of transportation is the city buses (colectivos) which move inside as well as outside the city borders. Taxis are also very cheap when compared to other world capitals, but a quicker ride is not guaranteed if taken during rush hours.\n\nTaxi\n\nHailing a taxi in Buenos Aires is very easy, especially around major tourist attractions. All feature meters that begin with an initial cost of AR$3.80 and then increase AR$0.38 every 200 meters. Rates are very reasonable and it’s recommended that tourists carry small bills in order to avoid taxi drivers that might not have (or claim to) change. If a cab does not have a meter or the driver claims the meter is broken, this should be a warning sign that a scam is at hand. If tourists exercise caution and even learn a few key phrases in Spanish, then a taxi ride in Buenos Aires can be a pleasant and most convenient way to get around.\n\nIf unsure of how to approach a taxi, your hotel or restaurant can always arrange for a secure one to pick you up. Tipping the driver is not obligatory.\n\nColectivos\n\nMost Porteños use the colectivos (buses) as the main form of public transportation as there are more than 100 lines that service the entire city 24 hours a day and 365 days a year, while the fare is an inexpensive fixed rate of AR$1.25, so long as you move within city borders. Have change on you because ticket machines – located on the bus – only accept coins.\n\nWhile the bus route is easy to figure out – for each route the bus is painted in a different color to differentiate – a tourist can make their colectivo experience easier by purchasing Guía \"T\"; a directory of streets that features bus listings for each map. These hand guides are available at subway stations or kiosks around the city.\n\nOnce on board, tell the driver your destination or tell them “un peso, por favor”. This will indicate to them that you’re traveling a standard distance and wish to pay one Argentine peso. He will press a button on the ticket machine instructing it to take the amount for your destination. After you insert your coins, the machine will automatically dispense your ticket.\n\nThe Buenos Aires Metro\n\nBuenos Aires’ Metro (often called “subte” as a way of saying “tren subterráneo”, which means “underground train”) is not very extensive but extremely efficient for times when you want to save time as well as money – the rate is AR$1.10 for any combination of routes. As always, avoid the lines during morning or evening rush hours as cars can be very crowded and finding space on one can prove to be time consuming. However, if not boarding during peak hours, this method of transportation is one of the best.\n\nComprised of six lines, this subway line – the oldest in Latin America - runs from 5AM to 10PM everyday except Sundays when service begins at 8AM. The magnetic strip tickets used can be purchased at the cashier counter but since they are reusable, you can add credit on them through ticket machines and avoid lines. Signs are readily displayed at each station indicating what stops each line makes. The oldest metro in Latin America and the Southern Hemisphere is located in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The extensive system - often called “subte” a shortened version of tren subterráneo or “underground train” - has now grown to serve much of the city; 1.7 million passengers use some 52km of routes every day.\n\nThe system’s six lines are labeled from “A” through “E” and also “H” (lines F, G and I are currently being constructed) each of which is identified by its own color. These are centered on the downtown area and serve all of the important Buenos Aires districts.\n\nThe metro has a highly regarded place in Buenos Aires’s cultural history. Each station sports a colorful and imaginative mural painted on its walls, all of which fall into similar themes to make the whole system something of an artistic spectacle. The architecture of some stations is also very elegant and unique; in 1997 this was recognized when a number of stations were made National Historic Landmarks.\n\nFares on the Buenos Aires metro are most reasonable; any combination of routes will cost around 1.10 ARS (about $0.31 USD) making this option even more affordable than the city’s bus network. The trains run approximately from 5am to 10.45pm, except on Sundays when the service begins at 8am. Negotiating the metro is straightforward. Each station has clearly marked directions and information which indicates the stops that each line makes. The reusable magnetic-strip tickets can be purchased at the cashier counter; you can add credit on to them through ticket machines and avoid queuing to buy a ticket every time you use the metro. This ticket must be inserted into the ticket barrier system before boarding the train – make sure not to damage the metal strip on your card if you plan to reuse it.\n\nAlthough the metro usually runs smoothly and quickly, it should be noted that routes can become very crowded during morning and evening rush hours, particularly at around 9am in the morning.\n\nMany do not know that this Latin American capital city was founded twice. In 1536, Spanish conquistador Pedro de Mendoza established the settlement as Ciudad de Nuestra Señora Santa María del Buen Ayre (City of Our Lady Saint Mary of the Fair Wind) in what today is the district of San Telmo. Unfortunately, his new city was short-lived as a result of the attacks of indigenous tribes who forced the settlers out of the region, leaving it abandoned until a second Spanish explorer, Juan de Garay, landed on the port once more in 1580. Garay gave the port of the new settlement a similar name - Puerto de Santa Maria de los Buenos Aires – and thus the capital was permanently established.\n\nThe new city thrived as a hub of illegal trade for the region that today contains present-day Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and some of Bolivia. During the 17th and 18th centuries, all official trade with Spain had to be made through Lima so for years Buenos Aires thrived in contraband trade until Spain finally made the city an open port in the late 1700s. Still, Porteños feeling the need for liberation from Spanish rule eventually revolted in May of 1810 – as a secondary effect of British invasions against the colony left the city to defend itself when Spain abandoned it - and established a temporary government after they expelled the Spanish Viceroy. Formal independence eventually came in 1816. 19th century Buenos Aires can be characterized as politically unstable as the country was divided between Unitarians who preferred a strong central government while Federalists wished for autonomy in the provinces. When Federalist Juan Manuel de Rosas did rise to power in 1829, the first Latin America secret police – the Mazorca – made it their mission to persecute the Unitarians who had not fled the city. Thankfully by 1852, Rosas was ousted from power and the first Argentine constitution was ratified in 1853.\n\nDuring these tumultuous years, the city went through more many political changes as from 1853 and 1860 it became the capital of the seceded State of Buenos Aires. For years after that the status was debated and fought over until finally in 1880, the capital became federalized and a seat of government, as the Mayor was appointed by none other than the President.\n\nEconomically, the city prospered during the second half of the 19th century with the region’s fertile pampas providing a great deal of produce and railroad construction business increasing the demand of raw materials to the city’s factories. New railroads also meant an increase in the sale of leather as now the port city was more easily connected to the rural Argentine lands where cattle ranches thrived. The beginning of the 20th century saw in influx in European immigrants to Buenos Aires, most especially Spanish and Italian immigrants, along with residents of Argentina’s provinces and other bordering countries. To accommodate room for some of these groups, villas miserias (shantytowns) began popping up around the city’s main industrial areas. This image of a more downtrodden Buenos Aires was an extreme difference to the supposed affluent appearance of the city that during this time became a cosmopolitan capital to rival its European brother, and now housing the world famous Colón Theater, a top opera venue.\n\n1940’s Buenos Aires saw the rise in power of Juan Perón who reached the presidency in 1946 with liberal ideas. He saw the need to improve education in the country and support the working class. He and his famous wife Evita, who also become a darling of the city’s and country’s blue-collared citizens thanks to her championing for labor rights and woman’s suffrage, were eventually ousted from power by forces within his government after a failed coup d’état that started as one of Buenos Aires’ darkest days - June 16 1955 - when the Plaza de Mayo was bombed and 364 civilians were killed. They would succeed three months later in attaining power.\n\nTerror characterized 1970’s Buenos Aires with citizens fearing for their lives if they rebelled against the military communist government that rose to power after a military coup that overthrew vice president Isabel Perón. Jorge Rafael Videla led the coup and the resulting “Dirty War” where the ruthless government kidnapped and killed opponents to their regime. These unfortunate citizens became known as the desaparacidos (the disappeared) as their deaths were never reported, leaving many families wondering what became of their loved ones. Today, mothers of these victims silently march Plaza de Mayo every week in memory of their children who lost their lives during unjust times in Buenos Aires.\n\nRaúl Alfonsín became president in 1983 and ended the military dictatorship, quickly bringing the leaders of the “Dirty War” into questioning and asking for accountability on the estimated 30,000 desaparacidos. Trials began in 1985 and many top generals, including then President Jorge Vidal, were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. An economic crisis characterized the early 21st century in Buenos Aires, with the economy collapsing in 2001 after an inflated exchange rate between the Argentine Peso and the US dollar led to a devastating recession. Unemployment eventually reached 25% and many businesses and citizens went bankrupt.\n\nFortunately today, Buenos Aires is politically and economically stable and has become a fascinating capital to visit not just within Latin America but around the world.\n\nHeavily influenced by European style, architecture and cuisine, this cosmopolitan port city of Latin America offers visitors a cultural experience that reflects Porteños rich immigrant background. While there are important historic monuments to be seen, travelers to this metropolis would not receive an authentic Buenos Aires vacation experience without also checking out a sensual Tango show or dining on delicious steaks from a true gaucho ranch in the Greater Buenos Aires area. This “Paris” of the Americas - as it is known for its architecture that is reminiscent of the design of the “City of Lights” – has so much to offer, so be sure to plan a lengthy visit to see it all.\n\nThe mammoth Obelisco monument of Buenos Aires was constructed in 1936 to commemorate 400th anniversary of the founding of the city of “Fair Airs”. Situated in the Plaza de la Republica, it measures 267 meters (220 ft) in height, with a base area of 161 square meters (530 square ft) and has come to be recognized as a symbol of not just the city, but of the country. It is the meeting and celebratory point for fans when the national football team does well and also serves as a venue for government sponsored cultural events.\n\nA morbid but captivating attraction in this city is the Cementerio de la Recoleta. Located in the wealthy neighborhood of the same name, this cemetery was meant for the elite of Buenos Aires and houses the body of its most famous figure, Eva Perón. Immense Greek columns welcome visitors, while the inside features distinct marble mausoleums, each unique and some decorated with beautiful statues. “City block” sections separate rows and rows of crypts that feature bronze or brass plaques with family names etched on. Trees line the rows at this graveyard, providing a beautiful resting place to figures that were once the crème de la crème of Buenos Aires society.\n\nFor visitors looking to get away from the bustling crowds, hectic noise and traffic of Buenos Aires, a great and relaxing alternative would be a visit to the Reserva Ecológica Costanera Sur, situated in the dock district of Puerto Madero. The only ecological reserve in the city, it has interesting origins as waste material from demolished buildings were tossed into the river were the reserve now exists. As time went on, sediment mixed with sand and a marshy land developed, which would serve as a foundation for the reserve, eventually becoming home to willow trees, wild flamingos, parrots and more distinct flora and wildlife. With numerous trails that are perfect for strolling, bird watching and cycling, this reserve is the perfect escape from the craziness of this capital city.\n\nOne of the most colorful neighborhoods in all Buenos Aires is the tango and football loving district of La Boca. Here tourists can walk along the famous Caminito pedestrian street, catch a spontaneous Tango dance (and even pose for a picture with the dancers!) and purchase tango-related memorabilia, along with wonderful pieces of art by Boca resident Benito Quinquela Martín who spent years preparing and painting the walls facing Caminito in the vivid colors that the street is now known for.
