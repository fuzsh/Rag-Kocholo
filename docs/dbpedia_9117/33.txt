Buenos Aires is the capital and most populous city of Argentina. The city is located on the western shore of the estuary of the Río de la Plata, on the South American continent's southeastern coast. Buenos Aires is the second-most visited city in Latin America and constitutes a large economy among the world's cities.

The city is the financial, industrial, and commercial hub of Argentina. The city's service sector is diversified and well-developed by international standards, and accounts for 76% of its economy, with advertising, real-estate and financial services being the largest. Manufacturing is also still prominent in the city's economy and benefits as much from high local purchasing power and a large local supply of skilled labor, as it does from its relationship to the massive agriculture and industry just outside the city limits.

Buenos Aires is tackling several challenges due to climate change and urbanisation. The city has less than 2 m2 of green space per person, which is below the recommended standard. Biodiversity loss, pollution, densification and flooding are some of the problems that the city is facing. Flood control and stormwater management is a growing issue for Buenos Aires, due to the city’s location in a low-lying pampas region with year-round rainfall.

Buenos Aires is hoping to implement several nature-based solutions to tackle these challenges, such as green spaces, green facades, permeable pavements and street trees.
