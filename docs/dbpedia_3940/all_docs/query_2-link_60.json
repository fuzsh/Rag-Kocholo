        "text": "Notre Dame will join four other Section 4 schools fielding eight-player football teams.\n\nCrusaders finished 6-2 last season.\n\nMike D'Aloisio ranks third all-time in Section 4 football history with 233 coaching wins.\n\nElmira Notre Dame's football history is filled with classic moments, unforgettable players and championship seasons. The Crusaders' decision to move to eight-person football is more about adding new memories than bidding goodbye to the old ones.\n\nLongtime head coach Mike D'Aloisio said whatever tinge of sadness may exist in leaving 11-person football behind is miniscule when compared to the chance to keep the sport going at a school that has long identified with football, from the 1990 team that won a Class B state intersectional game, to the 1998 group that was one point from a state title, to superstar players such as Mike Bennett, John Maio, Bob Grosvenor, Mike Meck and the late Joel Stephens.\n\nD'Aloisio himself is a Section 4 coaching legend, ranking third all-time in the section's history with 233 coaching wins over 36 seasons. That included a 6-2 record last season, with that team hanging tough with Class D state semifinalist Tioga before falling, 33-14, in a Section 4 Class D quarterfinal.\n\nThe decision to make this change came down to simple math.\n\n\"To me right now it's about doing what's making sense,\" D'Aloisio told me. \"I'm sad the numbers have gone down probably across the board in Class C and Class D, but I'm also happy and smiling that we're still allowed to have a football program at Notre Dame High School for kids who want to participate.\"\n\nHe made the decision to go to eight-player football late last month. With only 18 to 21 players signed up to play in 2018, D'Aloisio wrote a letter on behalf of the coaching staff to Section 4 requesting the move. While the schedule has not been finalized, eight-player football is what fans will see at Brewer Memorial Stadium this fall.\n\nWhile D'Aloisio left open the possibility of returning to traditional football in the future, the unsaid reality is it's not likely to happen. Notre Dame has not had enough players to field a junior varsity or modified team for a full season in more than a decade. For scheduling reasons, it would take at least two years in a row of 25 or more players signing up for football for it to make sense to return to the 11-player mix.\n\nNotre Dame joins Newfield, Oxford, Lansing and Unadilla Valley as Section 4 programs that are converting to eight-player football this season. Binghamton Seton Catholic Central played eight-person football a year ago but won't have any form of varsity football this fall.\n\nEight-player football has been played for years in smaller school districts across the country, with around 30 states offering six-, eight- or nine-player versions of the sport. The obvious downside is it allows for fewer players on the field at once, while also being viewed by some as a lesser version of football. For a big school like Elmira, Corning or Horseheads, it would make no sense to go to this version of the sport. For small schools like Notre Dame, it's a different world.\n\nOn the plus side, beyond providing some form of football, eight-player football doesn't force the hands of coaches and players as much, where someone who should realistically be in the backfield ends up on the line because no one else is willing or able to play up front.\n\nThis transition for Notre Dame and the other Section 4 schools has been in the making for several years. Without hard numbers, I'm confident in saying more games have been forfeited in the last eight years because of a lack of enough eligible players than there were in all years of high school football combined before that among Section 4 teams.\n\nThomas A. Edison, Lansing, Newfield, Watkins Glen, Odessa-Montour and Trumansburg are among schools that shut the door early on recent seasons. Notre Dame forfeited its season opener in 2013 against Tioga, and the Crusaders have had multiple homecoming opponents forfeit games that week.\n\nThe minimum number of players needed to field a team is 16, with injuries, academic issues and players deciding to quit invariably taking anywhere from five to 10 players out of the mix at a given time for most teams.\n\n\"With only 18 to 21 players signed up in the program, we feel it would be difficult to make it through an entire season without having to forfeit a number of games along the way,\" D'Aloisio wrote in his letter. \"The coaching staff feels playing 11-man football this season would be very detrimental to the continued existence and success of football at our school. This is the primary reason for Notre Dame's request to enter the Section IV EIGHT Man Football League for the 2018 season.\"\n\nAccording to the National Federation of High School Sports, participation in 11-player football dropped nearly 26,000 players from 2015-16 to 2016-17, with increases in six- and eight-player numbers. The numbers for 2017-18 have not been announced yet, but don't be surprised if that overall number continues to go down, even as football remains the No. 1 high school sport in terms of participation.\n\nThere are multiple reasons why the sport is on the decline.\n\nIt includes more options for students, whether it be competing on a travel team for a preferred sport in the fall or having choices that didn't exist 30 years ago. I played football at Odessa-Montour in the late 1980s and we didn't have soccer, a sport that was added after I graduated. Numbers concerns weren't even thought of at O-M back then and I have to think some of my teammates would have chosen the soccer pitch if they had an option, even with our consistent success.\n\nIn 2014, O-M had to cancel its season after two games because it didn't have enough players. The decision was made to combine football with rival Watkins Glen. That choice has ended up paying off for both schools. Spencer-Van Etten and Candor have since gone the merger route as well.\n\nI also think there's a drop in athletes who would traditionally help fill out rosters. Players who might not be very good, big or athletic but played football because they loved the sport or wanted to be part of a team are now more inclined to spend their time elsewhere. Maybe that's a sport like cross country, where even the slowest runner is going to get a chance to compete every meet.\n\nAlong the same lines, if someone shows up to the first day of practice and sees only 17 other kids, it's certainly going to occur to that player the season could be over by September, leading to a feeling of \"What's the point?\"\n\nThe landscape of football also changed when New York went to a state tournament in 1993. While in some ways that has helped grow the sport in terms of exposure, the downside is teams lost flexibility in scheduling. For some struggling Class D and Class C teams, that meant they were locked into games with top programs such as Tioga or perhaps Chenango Forks. There's nothing like an 0-8 season with blowout loss after blowout loss to kill interest in a sport.\n\nThen of course there is football's increasing reputation as being unsafe, with parents understandably concerned when they hear about CTE and the long-term impact of concussions. While a 2017 study by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons found the concussion rate for football lower than that of girls soccer, girls volleyball and girls basketball, perception has become reality when it comes to the gridiron.\n\nThat brings me back to Notre Dame's eight-player team, which D'Aloisio expects will get at least seven games against the other Section 4 schools and CJ Finney and Holley, from Section 5. A four-team playoff is also scheduled. D'Aloisio said they're talking about playing a state championship in eight-player football by 2020, and he expects more small schools to convert to this version of the sport.\n\nAs D'Aloisio pointed out, several Division I football players got their start on eight-player teams, as did the late Rashaan Salaam, who won the Heisman Trophy in 1994 at the University of Colorado. D'Aloisio also touted the wide-open nature of the game while keeping the framework of what people love about traditional football, with games in New York state using standard-sized fields.\n\nD'Aloisio said he takes great pride in his players and coaches for hanging in there and having so much success in the last several years without a feeder program. But he said the time is now for a new direction that he expects more schools to follow.\n\n\"I think it's something that's on the rise because they see the handwriting on the wall,\" D'Alolisio said."
