        "text": "We add value to Grosvenor by supporting the delivery of lasting commercial, social and environmental benefit through the provision of business services. We provide centres of excellence and expertise and champion cross-business communication and collaboration, while driving operational efficiency.\n\nHeaded by the Group Executive, each specialist function is led by a senior director in the fields of: Communications & Corporate Affairs, Digital Innovation, the Finance Centre, Health & Safety, People and Reward and HR Information Services, Research, Tax, Technology and Treasury. Some of our roles provide expert advice, assistance and insight to specific parts of the organisation, others work on an international, Grosvenor-wide basis.\n\nWe're part of something much bigger too. Internationally, our business spans urban property, food and agtech, rural estate management and support for philanthropic initiatives. All united by a common purpose: to deliver lasting commercial, social and environmental benefit.\n\nWe are focused on ensuring that our specialist services are delivered to the highest standards of excellence, challenging the status quo and always striving for better.\n\nWe rely on open minds and can do attitudes, and fresh perspectives really matter to us. It’s why we encourage our people to bring everything they are to work.\n\nIt’s purposeful, whether that’s communicating or demonstrating the impact of our activities such as tackling the climate crisis or engaging meaningfully with local communities. It’s commercial, providing exceptional transactional support to our transformational development projects or new investments. And it’s farsighted and ambitious, supporting decisions with high quality research and insights, while optimising environmental and social considerations alongside commercial ones.\n\nWorking in the Group Team is sociable and inclusive, challenging and extremely varied. We enjoy a supportive and flexible working culture and, as a family business, we like to think we’re a little less corporate too.\n\nI’m Nicole and I work in our Finance Centre. Grosvenor’s dynamic and ever-evolving environment means I can use my expertise in varied ways, from systems implementation, to building new ways of operating, to change management projects. As a people person, the advocacy aspect of the role is great – I can work closely with others and help budget holders make decisions.\n\nThere’s a reason I’ve stayed 14 years – Grosvenor fits well with my personal values around fairness and community. I lead the Racial Equality Group in our Culture Network and have worked on our community fund, where Grosvenor financed grass-roots community projects.\n\nOutside of finance, I’m an avid painter, gardener and baker – a brilliant creative outlet that energises me. That creative part of myself also comes through in my role – with constant opportunities to innovate and find better ways to do things.\n\nI’m James and I lead a team of seven people globally. I oversee service desk requests, develop solutions for issues, induct new starters, source new technology and support new initiatives from a tech perspective. I love engaging with people inside and outside Grosvenor.\n\nGrosvenor has fostered my talents and supported my interests – I’ve been able to realise my interests in both customer service and technology by moving from a Print Room temp to the tech team and up through the ranks.\n\nWhat else can I tell you? I love football and play for the Grosvenor team! And my musical interests have proven useful – my audio engineering skills, developed in my home studio, are often called on for work events. I also love obscure bands but won’t name check them here!\n\nI’m Jamie and I’m the Group Reporting Director, looking after both financial and non-financial reporting, as well as strategic planning and continuous improvement across finance. It’s been an exciting career, with six different roles in three different regions. No two days are the same.\n\nWhat makes Grosvenor special is its history and strong values of trust, integrity and respect. People are incredibly friendly and generous with their time.\n\nGrosvenor also respects our life outside work. Following a spinal cord injury, I was given the time I needed to concentrate on my physical wellbeing. This inspired me to co-found our dis(Ability) network, which focuses on inclusivity, raising awareness across the organisation and ensuring that accessibility is a key consideration both internally and in the assets we own and manage.\n\nOutside work, I enjoy being active – lots of walking, and wild swimming in all seasons! I’m also a keen cook and love cooking for family, friends and my dog Bernie."
