        "text": "Past Events of 2023\n\nDr. Zadrozny shared a new Powerful Geography resource at the National Council for the Social Studies Annual Conference in Nashville, Tennessee. This resource can be viewed here.\n\nWe were in Houston for the Texas Council for the Social Studies Conference, held on October 27 - 29, 2023.Dr. Boehm gave the Presidential Address titled “Powerful Geography: Essential Knowledge and Skills for Texas Students”.\n\nIn response to a recent call issued by the National Center for Research in Geography Education, an educator network has been organized to support state-based collaborations as part of the Powerful Geography movement. The network currently includes geography teachers and academic geographers in nine states, including those with active Geographic Alliances (organizations that were once funded by the National Geographic Society to support geography education and teacher professional development).\n\nMembers of the Powerful Geography network met at workshops held over two weekends in September 2023 to initiate the creation of geography educational resources that raise awareness and appreciation among learners of the relevance and usefulness of geography for what they aspire to be and do in the future.\n\nIn July we held the second Leadership Academy bringing together the online PhD geography education students with other professionals from the field. Split into three groups, they worked on writing papers focused on different aspects of Powerful Geography. They included: (1) Powerful Geography: Aligning Student Aspirations and Applied Geography in K-12 Curriculum; (2) Powerful Geography: The Role of Teacher Education (Pre- and In-Service Training and Certifications); and, (3) Powerful Geography: The Role of Geography Organizations\n\nThe Val Wilkie Jr. Award for Excellence in Teaching Geography was awarded to Michelle Crane for 2023. She teaches geography and government at Texas High School in Texarkana, Texas. She is currently working on her PhD at Texas State University with her dissertation focused on Powerful Geography.\n\nThe word of Powerful Geography is being spread through professional development workshops being held at Education Service Center 13 (Austin) in March and Education Service Center 12 (Waco) in April. Thank you for Melissa Solis and Jessica Torres (the social studies coordinators, respectively) for having us to share with the geography teachers in each region.\n\nMarch was our return to in-person meetings for the American Association of Geographers. Dr. Solem and Dr. Zadrozny presented on the latest research on Powerful Geography sharing the results of the last few years of research and progress.\n\nPast Events of 2022\n\nDr. Zadrozny provided a professional development workshop at Education Service Center Region 1 on December 6, on Project GO and Powerful Geography! It was a great turn out from teachers all along the southern border of Texas!\n\nOctober 2022 - Dr. Zadrozny and Stacie Aguirre were at the Texas Council for the Social Studies Conference in Denton, October 14-16. The booth was a hit and our session on Powerful Geography was packed! See you all next year in Houston!\n\nProfessional Development Workshop Galore - Dr. Zadrozny has been busy providing professional development workshops to teachers across the state of Texas sharing the Powerful Geography approach. Workshops include Waxahacie ISD (March), Education Service Center Region 10 and 11 - Richardson and Fort Worth (May), Education Service Center Region 9 - Wichita Falls (July), and Aledo ISD (July).\n\nJuly 2022 - Geography educators, senior scholars, and the three cohorts of the online Ph.D. program in geographic education came to San Marcos to participate in a one-day Leadership Academy focused around current issues in the world of geography education and the research and teaching responsibilities of the PhDs. Check out the briefing report here.\n\nJune 2022 - Stacie Aguirre joins the Grosvenor Center family as the new manager of the Texas Alliance for Geographic Education. Stacie has a decade plus of experience in the geography classroom and we are excited to have her join and share with you her ideas.\n\nMay 2022 - In honor of Valleau Wilkie Jr.'s memory and his monetary contributions to the Grosvenor Center over the past decades through the Sid Richardson Foundation, President Trauth approved a proposal by Dr. Boehm to honor Val Wilkie by creating \"The Val Wilkie Jr. Award for Excellence in Teaching Geography\". This award includes a $500 honorarium and recognition through the Grosvenor Center. This inaugural recepient was Nicole Vickerman, a world geography teacher in Plano ISD.\n\nFebruary 2022 - Drs. Boehm and Zadrozny presented Powerful Geography to social studies supervisors from across the state of Texas at the Texas Social Studies Supervisors Association Spring Conference in Austin.\n\nFebruary 2022 - Drs. Boehm, Solem, and Zadrozny hosted two virtual panels during the American Association of Geographers Annual Conference. The first was on Powerful Geography where graduate assistance Bren Vander Weil provided an update of the work he has done with Dr. Solem on the Encoding Geography grant. The second panel hosted was on AP Human Geography and the commissioned work group and research activities. The four researchers, Yusik Choi, Dr. Michael Scholz, Dr. Carmen Brysch, and Dr. Jorn Seemann shared their research findings, which will appear in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Geography.\n\n​Past Events of 2021\n\nThe latest edition of the Social Studies and Geography Survey for Middle and High Schools (2020-2021) is now available.\n\nThe Texas Council for the Social Studies Conference in Round Rock, Texas was a success! It was great to see all the faces that we have gotten to know over Zoom. Drs. Boehm and Zadrozny had a packed room for the Texas Social Studies Supervisors Association (TSSSA) Conference during their talk on Powerful Geography. And the room was packed with Texas teachers for Dr. Zadrozny's presentation on Powerful Geography during the TxCSS conference. Many of you stopped by our booth for goodies and giveaways.

Encoding Geography is a research-practice partnership (RPP) working at the intersection of geography and computer science. With the new funding, the RPP will develop a curriculum pathway aimed at expanding opportunities for women and underrepresented minorities to pursue geocomputationally intensive college majors and careers. Texas State’s portion of the award is $199,123. Additional institutions in the RPP include the Sweetwater Union High School District, San Diego Mesa College, San Diego State University, and the University of California at Riverside.\n\nIn a separate $39,601 grant from the NSF GEO-PATHS program, Dr Solem will conduct the external evaluation of the Geoscience Exposure and Training in Texas (GET Texas) project led by Sam Houston State University. GET Texas will create a place-based geoscience learning ecosystem inclusive of high school, community college, early university students, their families, and geoscience faculty. The project will integrate informal institutions, including a world-class public natural science museum and YMCA camp, to foster these relationships and ease students into the application, employability, and local relevance of geoscience.\n\nBoth projects feature the Powerful Geography curriculum approach of aligning subject matter with workforce applications and student aspirations.\n\nJuly 2020 -- The Grosvenor Center continued its efforts in Powerful Geography within the state of Texas by hosting another workshop with teachers.
