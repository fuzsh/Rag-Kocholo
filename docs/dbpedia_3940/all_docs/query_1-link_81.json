This change of name from \"Annual\" to \"Own\" appears to have been due to the severe paper shortage and consequent rationing that prohibited the publication of new papers or comics, or guaranteeing to publish on a regular (e.g. annual) basis. SImilar reasoning will have been behind the naming of Billy Bunter's Own when it appeared in 1953. The volumes all sold for 10/6.\n\nSome of the stories from the annuals are now available to read on the Friardale site."
