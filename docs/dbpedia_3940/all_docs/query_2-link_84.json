        "text": "London, 14 September 2023 – Three-time BRIT nominee and chart-topping singer-songwriter Tom Grennan has been announced to headline Legends of Football 2023 as it returns to Grosvenor House, celebrating the careers of Arsenal goal-scoring hero Ian Wright and six-time FA Women’s Super League winning manager, Emma Hayes.\n\nDescribed by Sir Alex Ferguson as “the best night in the football social calendar”, the Legends of Football event is an annual charity fundraising night, supported by the Premier League, in aid of the UK’s largest music therapy charity, Nordoff and Robbins. The event has raised a staggering £8.5 million to date since 1997 when John Charles CBE was the first recipient and has helped Nordoff and Robbins’ trained music therapists to break through the barriers caused by life-limiting illness, disability and social isolation, creating space for people to express themselves and find connection in society..\n\nBefore finding success as a breakthrough singer-songwriter Grennan trained with Luton Town and Stevenage as a teenager and had further trials at Aston Villa and Northampton Town. Deciding to pursue his music career, Grennan burst on to the scene as guest vocalist on Chase & Status’ “All Goes Wrong” in 2016. Fast forward to 2023 with three chart-topping albums, platinum hits like ‘Little Bit Of Love’ and ‘By Your Side’, UK Top 10 singles ‘Remind Me’, ‘Lionheart (Fearless)’, over 1.3 billion streams and sold-out arena tours – Tom Grennan is set to perform a super-charged set at Legends of Football next month.\n\nDespite his music career rocketing since his days as a young professional footballer, Grennan showed he’s still got more than it takes on the pitch as he picked up his second player of the match award in consecutive years at this year’s Soccer Aid.\n\nCommenting on headlining Legends of Football 2023 Tom Grennan said: “Football was a huge part of my life as a kid and through my teenage years. It gave me a sense of community and belonging and was something I always looked forward to. Football helped me become confident, build friendships, understand team unity, and shape me as the person I have become. So, to headline Legends of Football 2023 is a big honour for me. Nordoff and Robbins do vital work, and I look forward to celebrating Ian Wright and Emma Hayes’ amazing achievements on the day.”\n\nAt the prestigious 2023 Legends of Football event on October 2nd Chelsea FC Women’s manager, Emma Hayes, and Arsenal goal-scoring hero Ian Wright will join an esteemed list of past recipients including Pelé, David Beckham, Arsène Wenger and most recently, England manager, Gareth Southgate and Lioness hero, Ellen White to be honoured by Legends of Football.\n\nGrennan, Hayes and Wright will be joined by many other recognisable faces at the star-studded event next month to continue supporting Nordoff and Robbins and further the £8.5 million already raised.\n\nLegends of Football chairman Geoff Shreeves commented: “I’m delighted to invite Tom Grennan to this year’s Legends of Football event celebrating two legends of the game in the shape of Ian Wright and Emma Hayes. He’s shown us all his immense talent on the pitch at Soccer Aid and we’re very excited to see him do his thing on stage on what will be another unforgettable night on 2nd October at Grosvenor House.”\n\nNordoff and Robbins CEO, Sandra Schembri added: “Over the past few years Tom has become one of the UK’s most loved singer-songwriters, so we’re incredibly excited that he will be headlining at Legends of Football 2023 in October. We can’t wait for his performance and would like to thank Tom for supporting Nordoff and Robbins. Every penny raised through Legends of Football will go towards music therapy, helping people to communicate and connect through this superpower we call music.”"
