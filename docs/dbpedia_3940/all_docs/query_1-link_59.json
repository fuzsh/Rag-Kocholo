It was usually tunes from the 40's and 50's, but always asked Joyce if she wanted to hear Beethoven or Mozart for his morning concert!\n\nHe loved his kids and grands and his sense of humor was enjoyed by all and inherited by some. His life was a witness to them in kindness and morals. They never left the house without PaPa saying, \"Be Careful\"!\n\nThis poem personifies Toms life, author Terry Anderson. \" Den Of Lions\"\n\nFAITH\n\nWhere is faith found?\n\nNot in a book,\n\nOr in a church,\n\nNot often or for everyone.\n\nIn childish times it's easier;\n\nA child believes just what it's told.\n\nBut children grow\n\nAnd soon begin\n\nTo see too much\n\nThat doesn't match\n\nThe simple tales,\n\nAnd not enough\n\nOf what's behind\n\nTheir parents words.\n\nThere is no God,\n\nThe cynics say;\n\nWe made Him up\n\nOut of our need\n\nAnd fear of death.\n\nAnd happily they offer up\n\nThere test- tube proofs.\n\nA mystery.\n\nThe priests all say\n\nAnd point to saints\n\nWho prove their faith\n\nand sacrifice\n\nBut what of us\n\nWho are not saints,\n\nOnly common human sinners?\n\nAnd what of those\n\nWho in their need\n\nAnd pain cry out\n\nTo God and go\n\nOn suffering?\n\nI do not know-\n\nI wish I did.\n\nSometimes I feel\n\nAll the worlds pain.\n\nI only say\n\nThat once in my\n\nOwn need I felt\n\nA light and warm\n\nAnd loving touch\n\nThat eased my soul\n\nAnd banished doubt\n\nAnd let me go\n\nOn to the end.\n\nIt is not proof-\n\nThere can be none\n\nFAITH'S what you find\n\nWhen you're alone\n\nAnd find you're not\n\nWe are so thankful and blessed by the love, care and concern shown to Tom by the paramedics, ER staff, doctors, and nurses here in Newton. They tried so hard to keep him on this earth, although God had planned this day for him and welcomed him home in a peaceful quiet transition. May God's richest blessings be on each and everyone of them."
