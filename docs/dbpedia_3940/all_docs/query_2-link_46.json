You don‚Äôt move into a house, you move into a place.‚Äù Thanks Cathy Francis for an engaging session at the Association of Town & City Management‚Äô Place Management Conference. üèòÔ∏è The prospect of Ebbsfleet Garden City was first raised in government in 2003. It‚Äôs taken until 2024 for the keys of the 4,000th home to be handed over to occupants. üë®üíª The tech landscape is completely unrecognisable from 2003. My question would be, how do we ensure planning for digital infrastructure keeps pace with housing delivery to enable local businesses and residents to benefit from the latest available technology? #greentech #communityengagement #energyinnovation Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities / British Property Federation\n\nCommunity Led Housing in action . The Stirchley Co op development of 39 affordable rent homes plus support for community business on the High Street in Stirchley has led the way . Others are ready to follow in Stourbridge , Coventry, Solihull and other sites in Birmingham. Will the new devolved housing funds be used to help not for profits , community organisations with the support of wMUCH, deliver on our target of 5% of affordable social rent homes over the next 4 years. We are currently on target to achieve that 5%, with support from the Combined Authority and Local authorities we believe we can double that target. These homes will not only address housing need but build community resilience , address housing need , reduce council budgets through early interventions and social impact , the road to net zero through MMC , jobs , skills , creativity and enterprise and support for local economies. Empower communities and they can deliver the change we need. #koyannasqatsi #communitypower #democraticeconomy #greensquareaccord #wmuch #richardparker #wmca\n\nRural Reimagined. Does your community have existing plans that sit on a shelf? Does your community have projects that, if developed and funded, could turn the tide and put you on a path to prosperity? Now is the time to dust those off and reimagine what 'could be!' ARI provides hands-on technical assistance to prepare projects for implementation, find the needed resources, and ensure projects are finished. Let us show you how ARI could create impacts in your community. #buildingcommunities #communityprojects #prosperity #communityprojects #funding #communitygrowth #growingyourcommunity #growingyourbusiness #growingruralamerica #growingthedelta #deltaconmunities #deltaprojects\n\n¬£1bn of capital from round two of the #LevellingUp Fund has been awarded, which will be distributed to more than 50 places across the #UK. The cash will go towards a wide variety of projects including #transport and #infrastructure improvements as well as town #regeneration schemes, with a number of #KeyCities set to benefit. #Preston - ¬£20m for parks and travel infrastructure, #Reading - ¬£19.1m for Reading Central Library and the Hexagon Theatre, #Blackpool - ¬£40m boost to create a ‚Äòmultiversity‚Äô, a new education campus, #Bournemouth - ¬£19.9m to restore seafront facilities, #Cumberland - ¬£9.5m for transport and culture projects in Workington, #Kirklees - ¬£12m for the regeneration of Batley town centre, and #Southampton - ¬£20m to improve the city‚Äôs outdoor sports centre.

This model also affords a multifaceted evaluation that‚Äôs helping us understand the impact of place-based investment. For example, with evaluation partner Mastercard Data Services, we‚Äôre learning more about the importance of developing along and near commercial corridors. New investments on bustling corridors like Ogden Avenue in North Lawndale, 47th Street in Back of the Yards, and Chicago Avenue in Austin can spark exponential economic benefits. That‚Äôs because when a new business or community facility opens and draws new traffic, those consumers have the ‚Äúopportunity to spend,‚Äù and do just that. Increased spending in the areas near We Rise Together investments has proven to be correlated with the presence of many nearby pre-existing businesses. As more of the projects We Rise Together has invested in open their doors, we will continue to share what we‚Äôre learning through our ongoing evaluation. #Chicago #Philanthropy #WeRiseWednesdays\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/enREVGas So the Frome \"housing crisis\" gets into The Times, or do we blame The Guardian for pushing Frome's character out to the masses ü§£. Anyway I am glad I'm from north Essex...I've dodged a bullet here This issue is not unique to Frome, and is being played out up and down the country. Many towns have similar issues with not enough homes or too many new homes at the higher ends of the economic scale with no obvious or coherent thoughts on community interaction or the wider infrastructure. Frome in particular has constraints topographically with the hills and narrow streets which provide its character but restrict central development opportunities of significant scale. From what I see there are some good opportunities for smaller developers to revive some dormant land/buildings, alas the number of units and the type would be limited and may not solve the problems raised. Is there a solution, yes there has to be, but it would not be utopian and obviously requires trade offs to look at developments that bring in the right housing across the economic scale alongside the right infrastructure to connect the dots and enhance what Frome already offers. It is big ideas are needed not just short term site by site tick boxes with economical and political wins. This means give and take at political, community, land owner and developer levels to work together and find the right solutions, and not just in Frome. Here's a thought maybe a non-partisan unique master plan vision that looks to the future of Frome long term...."
