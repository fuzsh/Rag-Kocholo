        "text": "On Wednesday 21 May, Grosvenor Casinos selected Tom Ketless from Grosvenor G Casino Plymouth as the winner of its Chef of the Year 2014 competition. With his appealing main of ‘Mediterranean stuffed chicken with orzo pasta’, Tom beat four other chefs from Grosvenor Casinos across the UK. This superb dish will feature on Grosvenor Casinos’ autumn menu across 50 of its venues.\n\nThe annual competition is open to all Grosvenor Casinos team members who believe they can create a winning recipe and cook a main course dish for two people in a commercial kitchen within a given time period. In addition to creating the main course, all finalists were asked to create a dessert to serve two. Over 51 chefs entered the competition this year.\n\nPhil Urban, Managing Director at Grosvenor Casinos commented: “In addition to our excellent gaming experience, we pride ourselves on offering exceptional cuisine in Grosvenor Casinos’ restaurants. We were delighted with Tom’s dish and look forward to adding it to our menu across all our restaurants.”\n\nThe finalists, including winner Tom Ketless, were Steve Kenyon from Grosvenor G Casino Didsbury, Godwin Brown from Park Tower Casino London, Kevin Baker from Grosvenor Casino Sunderland and Ed Cooke from Grosvenor Casino Northampton. The successful six finalists travelled to Reading to prepare their dishes at the final held at Reading College on 21 May in front of the judges, with Tom receiving his award that evening at Grosvenor G Casino Reading."
