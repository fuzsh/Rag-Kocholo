Third-generation jeweler and GIA Graduate Tanishq Gupta views LGDs as revolutionary. âThese are real diamonds. Why else would GIA and IGI certify them? Luxury jewelry is now more accessible and versatile. Get your first Lab Diamond with us â youâll love it,â says Tanishq.\n\nHis brand, MARQA, is committed to quality, finesse, and growth. For the new-age consumer seeking to make a statement without breaking the bank, MARQA is for you. Located at the heart of the capital, their flagship showroom was inaugurated on June 22nd at Central Market Lajpat Nagar II, New Delhi.\n\n\"Lab-grown diamonds are everywhere, but you won't find what we have in store for you,\" says Tanishq, highlighting MARQA's unique offerings. The brand envisions a world where diamonds are an everyday luxury, not an overpriced status symbol. MARQA aims to educate consumers, offering high-quality diamond jewelry at a fraction of traditional prices.\n\nâYouâre saving up to 95% on the cost of diamond solitaires for the same cut, color, clarity, and carat weight. Even jewelers are wearing LGDs instead of natural diamond solitaires. That says something.â\n\nFor decades, the diamond industry shielded the existence of lab-grown diamonds to maintain profitability. The belief that diamonds only form deep within the Earth has fueled conflicts and massive profits.\n\nMARQA embodies the spirit of a young, bold, and adaptable brand, reflecting the dynamism of modern India. \"Diamonds are forever, for everyone, for every day,\" is the ethos of MARQA. Establishing itself as the standard in lab diamond jewelry, MARQA values transparency over presentation, knowledge over authority, and sustainability over wastefulness.\n\nProud of its skilled artisans and Indian roots, MARQA represents years of formulation, multi-generational experience, and a deep desire to build a revolution. Welcome to MARQA.\n\nFor more information:\n\nCall: +91 92 5625 5625\n\nWebsite: www.marqa.in Email: hello@marqa.in\n\nLocation: https://bit.ly/MARQALajpatNagar\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/marqa.official/\n\nHollyBelly: Elevating Culinary Excellence\n\nHollyBelly is a boutique catering company fueled by an unwavering passion for food and gourmet experiences. What began as a passion project in a home kitchen has evolved into one of the premier providers of European and Wild Indian cuisine, restaurant consulting, and premium gift curation. HollyBelly goes beyond traditional catering, delivering extraordinary gastronomic experiences that set new standards.\n\nFrom lavish weddings to sophisticated corporate events, HollyBelly has become synonymous with unparalleled culinary artistry. The company is renowned for introducing innovative concepts such as Small Plates and FoodMoods, featuring unique pairings like Tequila & Tacos and Bourbon & BBQ. HollyBellyâs impressive clientele includes Jimmy Choo, Emporio Armani, Sephora, Kate Spade, and Raw Mango, and the company has also had the honor of hosting royal families.\n\nJaneya Mehta: Culinary Visionary\n\nJaneya Mehta is revolutionizing the catering industry on both national and global scales. An esteemed alumna of the London School of Economics and Le Cordon Bleu, Paris, Janeya boasts a distinguished array of accolades. She thrived as a Human Resources advisor to the Ministry of Water Resources, where she leveraged her intellect, creativity, and expertise for eight years.\n\nIn 2015, Chef Janeya Mehta co-founded HollyBelly Food Boutique with Chef Rishikant Bhardwaj.

He honed his skills with a DiplÃ´me de Cuisine from Le Cordon Bleu, London, and trained under Michelin-starred chefs.

Founded by Mehek Jain and Vaibhav Sharma, the studio envisions reconnecting with Indian craftsmanship and blending it with contemporary lifestyles.\n\nBarkat Designs draws inspiration from the diverse flavors, heritage, and cultures around them. Both founders have honed their skills and design values through education in India, Milan, and London, which greatly enriches their sensibilities. Their approach to design is not committed to a specific genre as they believe every space and its inhabitants deserve a unique design language, and the role of an interior designer is to add value to it.\n\nEstablished in 2018, the duo has worked on various projects across India, the UAE, and London.\n\nMehek Jain believes good design is a balanced concoction of functionality and aesthetics. Vaibhav Sharma complements her with his flamboyant aesthetics and business acumen, helping build the brandâs vision to reach new horizons.\n\nIn 2020, the studio launched their first capsule home collection, with all subsequent collections rooted in Indian craftsmanship, materials, and the foundersâ fine and digital art endeavors. Barkat Designs took a sabbatical in 2021 to explore new realms of design. They moved to London post-COVID and worked with prominent interior designers on projects in prime real estate locations like Hyde Park and Grosvenor Square. They have since re-established their design practice in London and India.\n\nFor an environmentally sustainable future, they aim to revive and build a deeper understanding of heritage techniques and materials, bringing a more holistic approach to their design practice.\n\nwww.barkatdesigns.com\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/barkatdesignsofficial?igsh=MnUzZTJjM3pjM201&utm_source=qr\n\nCrafting Dreams: Ayushi Jalan's Inspiring Journey with The Decor Remedy\n\nIt's easy to imagine a young woman dreaming of transforming her passion into a successful business. However, it takes a special blend of dreams, grit, and determination to make that vision a reality. This is the essence of Ayushi Jalan, the driving force behind The Decor Remedy.\n\nIn 2018, without formal design education, Ayushi embarked on a mission to enhance everyday living with stylish, functional, and affordable home decor. Her collection now includes unique pieces, ranging from planters and tables to wall decor and luxurious bathroom items.\n\nAyushi's journey involved collaborating with local artisans to bring her designs to life. Her dedication bore fruit in 2019 when she won the prestigious \"Good Homes Award\" for her designs, marking the start of an incredible journey. The Decor Remedy, entirely bootstrapped, gained a loyal following and caught the attention of celebrities who shared about it organically.\n\nAyushi often says, \"Itâs not passion that works in the long run; itâs consistency.\" With a degree in clinical psychology, she infuses each product with its own voice, believing that every object in our homes carries meaning and energy.\n\nThe Decor Remedyâs philosophy centres on the idea that our surroundings profoundly impact our mood. Ayushiâs brand offers remedies for different moodsâcalm, festive, productive, or hosting. She believes our home should reflect who we are, serving as a sanctuary that relaxes, rejuvenates, and creates a safe space for us.\n\nAyushi's journey exemplifies the power of determination and consistency. In a short time, her brand has achieved remarkable success in the competitive design world, proving that with dedication, we can achieve anything we set our minds to. Ayushi and The Decor Remedy show that dreams do come true, and with consistency, we can create something truly magical.\n\nwww.thedecorremedy.com\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thedecorremedy\n\nNitya jewels: A Symphony of Diamonds and Design\n\nIn a luxury-dominated world, Zil and Nidhi Vora launched Nitya Jewels last November, merging passion and expertise for modern women.\n\nHailing from a diamond business family, Zil's passion for jewellery and design led to her entrepreneurial journey. Nidhi, with an LLM in Intellectual Property Rights, brought a strategic perspective. Their rigorous training at IIGJ and internships with industry stalwarts have shaped their visionary path in jewellery design.\n\nThe sisters believe that every woman deserves jewellery that enhances her personality, rather than overshadowing it. Diamonds, Polki, and gemstones are not merely embellishments but the soul of every piece. From reimagining Polki, often relegated to traditional jewellery, into modern geometric forms to experimenting with unconventional diamond cuts, Nitya Jewels has pushed the boundaries of design.\n\nNitya Jewels A Symphony of Diamonds and Design\n\nNitya Jewels transforms heirlooms into stunning new pieces, preserving sentiment and promoting sustainable luxury through expert remodelling.\n\nThe brandâs rapid ascent is evident in its global footprint. In less than a year, Nitya Jewels has established a strong presence in the US, UK, Israel, Hong Kong, and Dubai. The overwhelming response, including a staggering repeat customer rate, is a testament to the brandâs allure.\n\nWith their youthful energy and vision, Zil and Nidhi (sister-in-laws) making big strides, inspire young women to dream big.
