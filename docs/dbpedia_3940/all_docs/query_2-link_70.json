        "text": "The First Century of Silhill Football Club: 1908 to 2008\n\nIn 1923 Silhill FC enters the newly formed Birmingham & District Amateur Football League and, to allow for growth, needs to hire the additional ground pictured in Sharmans Cross Road, to run in tandem with Warwick Road, Solihull, its home after World War 1. Here you see the Silhill 1st & 2nd teams combined. A recruit from Wellesbourne FC, Norman Willcox is fifth left in back row. Denis Mansell is far left in front row of six. Bill Haines (1906-71), fifth left in middle row, went on to win Junior International caps for England. Harold S Nock, immediately in front of Bill with the ball at his feet, was 1st team captain, 1923/24 Season.\n\nThe Silhill 2nd team captained by E. Horton lines up proudly in 1923 at the new Sharmans Cross Road ground, with Norman Willcox fourth from the right on the back row. The Birmingham AFA representative team of 1927/28. In the second row back, third from left, with hands on his shoulders, enjoying his second Season in this side, Silhill striker W.H. (Bill) Haines was a fearsome header of the heavy old leather ball who could leap high above opposing defences. The occasion was a Cup tie against the Coventry Works League (now the Coventry Alliance), in which the Birmingham AFA emerged as winners over two legs.\n\nBill Haines went on from Silhill to join four Birmingham Combination sides in succession - Gresley Rovers in 1928, Evesham Town (the highest ranked) in 1930, Nuneaton Town in 1931 and Shirley Town in 1935. He helped Gresley Rovers win the Bass Charity Vase for 1928-29. He scored four goals in Evesham Town's 8-1 FA Cup victory over the Birmingham & District AFAs Wolverhampton Amateurs on 6th September 1930 - and four again when Nuneaton Town trounced another Birmingham & District AFA team in the FA Cup, Walsall Phoenix, 15-0 on 12th September 1931. Around 1930 Bill won his Junior International caps for England as centre forward against France, Belgium & Scotland.\n\nBills brothers, Richard (1907-85) & Alf (1903-88), played for Silhill too in the 1920s, Richard being a defender in the 1927 Birmingham AFA Senior Cup Semi-Final, which rueful Sils lost 0-1 to future stars Moor Green, now Solihull Moors FC.\n\nThe Birmingham County FA representative team line up at an inter-association match against the Scottish Junior FA played at Heart of Midlothian FC, Tynecastle Park, Edinburgh, on 26th April 1930. The County FA players achieved an outstanding 2-2 draw, despite the fact that they were obliged to travel up to Edinburgh and back the same day, a long and tiring journey on pre-War roads. Centre forward Bill Haines, shown in the middle of the front row with the ball at his feet, scored his side's second goal, with a shot from just outside the box, for the 2-2 equaliser.\n\nSilhill 1sts of 1948-49\n\nBack row (left to right): George OWEN (Hon. Treasurer), K. SANSOME, T.D.T. HICKMAN (vice-captain), D.G. TREVERTON, C.J. SHAW (goalkeeper), O.W. DAVIS, Norman WILLCOX (Hon. Match Secretary), Arthur LINLEY (Hon. Social Secretary). Front row (left to right): J. MANSELL, Joe LANE, A.L. FEATHERSTONE, Stan FARMILOE (captain), R. COLLYER, E. PRICE, Eric REEVE.\n\nSilhill 2nd team, Birmingham & District AFA Junior Cup Finalists of 1950, losing 4-2 against Staffs Casuals:\n\nBack row (left to right): R. BROOKES, K. LEWIS, E. DRAKE (goalkeeper), R. MOULD, Eric REEVE, P. KIDD. Front row (left to right): Paul DERRINGTON, Gordon TRINDER, E. LEWIS (captain), Jack ERSKINE, C. GARRETTY.\n\nSilhill 1sts of 1950/51\n\nBack row (left to right) includes: Stan FARMILOE (captain), Sam DOUGLAS, Brian SIMPSON, Les BOURNE. Front row (left to right) includes: Tony GILES, David HOLLINGS, Gordon TRINDER, Mike MARTIN. Stan Farmiloe was long-serving club, i.e. 1st team, captain from 1948 to 1954. A Silhill player for 20 years from 1945 to 1965, Trinder was a Youth team captain in 1947 and later a well-known 1st team penalty-taker & the Fixtures Secretary: he died in June 2010.\n\nSilhill 1sts in early 1950’s\n\nBack row (left to right): Bill SHARP, Ken HARBOURNE, Norman A CORBETT (goalkeeper), Stan FARMILOE (captain), Arthur RICE, Peter BISSENDEN. Front row (left to right): Dai OWEN, Joe LANE, Tony GILES, Gordon TRINDER, Mike MARTIN.\n\nSilhill 1sts of 1951-52\n\nBack row (left to right): Bill SHARP, Tony GILES, John SHAW (goalkeeper), Stan FARMILOE (captain), Jack ERSKINE, Dai OWEN. Front row (left to right): Mike MARTIN (also press officer), P. KIDD, Joe LANE (holding the ball), Brian WATKINS, S. WOOD.\n\nSilhill 3rds of 1951-52\n\nBack row (left to right): L. HOMER, E. SMITH, N. PEAKMAN (goalkeeper), J. DOVEY, J. BOURNE, L. HUSBAND. Front row (left to right): J. BOYDEN, J. DEWAR, Eric REEVE (captain), E. PRICE, A.L. FEATHERSTONE.\n\nSilhill 3rd team, Birmingham & District AFA Minor Cup Finalists of 1954, losing narrowly 3-2 to Staffs Casuals:\n\nBack row (left to right): R. MORTON (reserve), A.J. MILLS, C. GARRETTY, G.E. MORTON, S. OVERTY, J. BOURNE, J. HUNT (reserve), Arthur LINLEY (Hon. Secretary). Front row (left to right): K. GORE, W. DODD, C.J. PEARCE (captain), E. SMITH, F. FLATLEY, R.L. FISHER.\n\nSilhill 1sts of 1954-55\n\nBack row (left to right): Cyril NEWTON (trainer), Ken CLARK, W. BROWN, Ken JONES, Ian TIDEY (goalkeeper), Bill SHARP (captain), Brian SIMPSON. Front row (left to right): Dai OWEN, Joe LANE, Gordon TRINDER, Peter BISSENDEN, Mike MARTIN.\n\nSilhill 1sts 1954-55, again in front of the wooden pavilion at Sharmans Cross Road:\n\nBack row (left to right) includes: Cyril NEWTON, Ken CLARK, Ken JONES (captain), Eric C HALES (goalkeeper), Brian SIMPSON, Norman WILLCOX, Bill SHARP. On the front row, first three on the left are: Roy ATKIN, inside forward Joe LANE, centre forward Gordon TRINDER (who has ball at his feet).\n\nAtkin played his last game in the 1967-68 Season: then he took over from A.G. Bragg as the Club's Hon. Auditor, serving from 1968-73.\n\nSilhill 1st team, 1955-56 Season: Back row (left to right): Ken CLARK (right half), Alan TIDEY (right back), Bill SHARP (left back), Jack KENTISH (goalkeeper), Brian SIMPSON (left half & captain), Gordon TRINDER (centre forward). Front row (left to right): Nigel VAUGHAN (right wing), Joe LANE (outside left), Ken JONES (centre half), Mick FITZGERALD (inside right), Brian NODEN (inside left).\n\nAlan Tidey (1934-2002) was Silhill rightback 1955-70; Birmingham AFA Senior Cup winning captain of 1966; and selected for over 50 Birmingham AFA League representative games.\n\nAs a hard-tackling, ultra-competitive rightback, Alan would summarily bundle over the touchline any leftwingers he caught in possession. Centre half Ken Jones was also picked for over 50 League representative matches.\n\nIn 1957 Ken Jones’s team were proud to lift the prestigious Birmingham Referees’ Jubilee Cup. This trophy was presented for sportsmanship & general behaviour over the season as adjudged by the referees.\n\nBack row, left to right: Brian NODEN, Jack KENTISH (goalkeeper), Bill SHARP, Gordon TRINDER, Brian SIMPSON. Front row, left to right: Alan TIDEY, Nigel VAUGHAN, Ken JONES (captain), Mick FITZGERALD, Joe LANE, Ken CLARK.\n\nThe 1st team from the 1960-61 Season when Silhill were crowned Birmingham & District AFA League Champions for the first time. Shown here is the XI who lost 2-5 to Cresconians in the Senior Cup Final on 15th April 1961 at the Gas Officials ground in Woodacre Road, Erdington, with rightwing Cliff Jones equalising for 1-1 & inside right Ken Scorer for 2-2. And yet, a fortnight later on 29th April, Silhill exacted revenge when they crushed Cresconians 5-0 at Sharmans Cross Road to win the League title: the only change to that Cup Final line-up was Jim Carrick as centre forward for Roger Hudson, in agony from damaged knee cartilages. The five unanswered goals on an historical afternoon accrued to Cliff Jones (2), Noden (2) and Preston.\n\nBack row (left to right): Peter PRESTON, Cliff JONES, Roger HUDSON, Mike STILGOE (goalkeeper), Ken SCORER, Brian NODEN. Front row (left to right): Ken CLARK, Terry LOCK, Brian SIMPSON (captain), Ken JONES, Alan TIDEY.\n\nIn what is generally regarded as the worst British Winter of the 20th Century, 1962/63, Silhill Football Club played their last home fixtures on 22nd December 1962 and one away fixture on 29th December 1962. But thereafter, owing to the big freeze, no further games were played until 9th March 1963, with the 2nd and 3rd teams at Sharmans Cross Road and the 1st team at Malvern, in the Amateur Football Alliance Senior Cup (London Senior Cup) against Malvern College.\n\nTo catch up on the fixture backlog caused by the big freeze, Silhill FC teams had to play 31 home and 20 away games up to 16th May 1963. This challenge, however, was met by the hard-working players of the Club, who during the month of May played 19 games in 16 days, and by the efforts of the two administrative \"giants\" of Silhill history  namely Arthur Linley (General Secretary) and Norman Willcox (Match Secretary).\n\nThe next longest Winter, with a similar catalogue of postponements, was exactly 50 years later  2012/13, when Silhill 1sts had fulfilled only half of their Premier Division fixtures by 1st April.\n\nThe Silhill FC 2nd Team who played at Sharmans Cross Road on 22nd February 1964 in their return League match against Handsworth GSOB 2nds, the result being a 0-0 draw. In the first clash away on 9th November 1963, Silhill 2nds had emerged 2-1 victors, with Alan Ball scoring both their goals. This was in the Combined Section Division 1: in the 1970/71 Season, the top of the League structure was simplified to a Premier and Division 1 for Silhill 1sts and 2nds respectively.\n\nBack row, left to right: T. CLIFTON (right half), D. BULLOUGH (right back), Len LAKE (goalkeeper), Don CREES (centre half & captain), Bill SHARP (left back & vice-captain), Phil LEES (left half). Front row, left to right: Roy ATKIN (outside right), Peter PRESTON (inside right), Terry HANSON (centre forward), Alan BALL (inside left), Bob DALL (outside left).\n\nThe V-neck shirt sported here by Silhill players came in around the late 1950s, when it replaced the old-fashioned, button-up, “collar and cuffs” design, and was a precursor to the “crew neck” style worn later in the 1960s. Silhill 1st team wore the crew neck design in the 1966 Senior Cup Final, as did England in their World Cup Final at Wembley that year.\n\nSilhill 3rds who won the Birmingham & District AFA Minor Cup 4-1 against Old Wulfrunians 3rds on 27th February 1965:\n\nBack row, left to right: Arthur LINLEY, Bob CLEAVELEY, Colin EMMETT, Bunny SHEPHEARD, D LE TISSIER (goalkeeper), Gordon TRINDER, J ALLINGTON, Norman WILLCOX. Front row, left to right: G CHATTOE, Pat HUBBLE, Ron GRANT (captain), Colin DAVIS, L CHATTOE. The goalscorers on an afternoon to remember were Davis, G Chattoe & Grant (2).\n\nA genuine two-footed player at inside forward, Ron Grant again captained the successful Silhill 3rd team who retained their Minor Cup in 1966. Back row, left to right: Barrie COLLYER, Arthur Anthony (Tony) REVILL (goalkeeper, later an esteemed referee for over 20 years in this League, who died on 3rd January 2011 aged 73), Pete FREEMAN, Jeff PEARSON, Roger JOHN, Brian JENNINGS. Front row, left to right: Pat HUBBLE, Rodney HALL, Ron GRANT (captain), John MOLESWORTH, Colin DAVIS.\n\nCollyer, Molesworth & Pearson all scored in the thrilling 3-3 draw in this Final against Staffs Casuals on 26th February 1966, with Molesworth & Pearson again making no mistake in the replay that followed on 5th March for a stunning 2-1 triumph in extra time. Continuing his outstanding debut for Silhill FC in 1965/66, Pearson also played for Silhill 1sts in their first ever Senior Cup Final victory the same season.\n\nBarrie Collyer also made his Club debut in 1965/66 at 34. A prolific scorer, he played for the 3rds - mainly at outside right but also at outside left or centre forward - & sometimes for the 2nds or 4ths. A man who contributed to the lively humour in the dressing room, he was vice-captain to Phil Lees of the 3rds 1968/69 & to Fred Robinson of the 3rds 1970/71. Collyer served on the Clubs Social Committee 1971/72 & died on 24th September 2010 aged 79. His skipper, the gentle giant Ronald Charles Grant, lived from 28th August 1923 to 12th December 2013 & happily attended the Silhill Centenary Dinner held at the George (Ramada) Hotel, Solihull town centre, on Saturday 8th November 2008.\n\n40 years on from their earliest Birmingham & District AFA Senior Cup Final in 1926 (0-1 against Kings Heath), Silhill 1sts won this major trophy for the first time on 23rd April 1966 (3-2 versus Cresconians). Sils’ fourth ever Senior Cup Final relieved the pain of two Final defeats to Crescs in 1958 (1-2) & 1961 (2-5). So, in 1966, leftwing Stokes & rightwing Hudson had put Silhill 2-0 in control by the interval. Later centre forward Carrick shot the 3-1 from Hudson’s fine run and cross. Their great rivals fought back again to 3-2 but then blazed over the bar a late penalty to equalise conceded by Tidey. Back row (left to right): Brian NASH, Jim CARRICK, John MANTLE (goalkeeper), Jeff PEARSON, Roger HUDSON, Peter BRETT. Front row (left to right): Michael STOKES, David GRAYSON (manager), Alan TIDEY (captain), Gary FLINTOFF, Tony HATHAWAY.\n\nSilhill 2nd team, victors over Penncroft in the Birmingham & District AFA Junior Cup Final played on 22nd March 1969, unusually at Sharmans Cross Road itself. Building upon a 2-0 halftime lead from shots by Pallett & then Coleman, Hadley drove in the 3-0. Later on playmaker Brundish, who had provided fine assists for the second & third goals, hammered in for 4-1 to complete the scoring. With the astute & experienced Pearson at the helm, Silhill 2nds went on to retain this Cup for the next two seasons, 1970 & 1971.\n\nBack row (left to right): Alan TURNER, Alan MASON, Dick BRUNDISH, Dave HUGHES, Arthur HEATH (goalkeeper), Gary FLINTOFF. Front row (left to right): Alan HORSLER, Chris PALLETT, Jeff PEARSON (captain), Maurice HADLEY, Mike COLEMAN.\n\nSilhill 1sts line up at the fine Bournville Trust Recreation Ground in the Birmingham & District AFA Senior Cup Final of 18th April 1970 when they were defeated 3-2 by Walsall Phoenix (halftime 1-1). That Season 1969-70 the 1sts also finished a close second in the League on 41 points, one point behind champions Penncroft & with a playing record of P26 W18 D5 L3, goals F85 A32. Such achievements did much to prepare this outstanding team for its golden era which comprised the Senior Cup Final victories of 1972 & 1973 & League Championship of 1973.\n\nBack row, left to right: Referee Tom HUGHES, Mike PYBUS, Chris PALLETT (substitute), Neville GOLDSBY, Alan TURNER, Colin BAMFORD (goalkeeper), Dick BRUNDISH (put Silhill 2-1 ahead from Blackwell's pass), Roger BLACKWELL, Roy TIDEY (team assistant). Front row, left to right: Brian WIGLEY, Danny JONES (scored 1-0), John MULHALL (captain), Mike COLEMAN, Johnny BUTLIN. A great servant of Silhill on match days, Roy Tidey collapsed & died the following Saturday running the line in a League game against the Sutton British Legion.\n\nThe Summer 1975 Devon tour was arranged by Cedric \"Hubby\" Herbert, who had a cousin in whose hotel Sils stayed in Hope Cove, South Devon. The side comprised a mix of players from different Silhill teams. They played one game in Plymouth on Saturday. At the second, against the local Hope Cove coastguards team on Sunday morning, the Sils were captured on film:\n\nBack row, left to right: Neville Goldsby, Bob Taylor, Roger Blackwell, Eric Hales (goalkeeper), Mike Knights, Alan Tidey, Dick Brundish. Front row, left to right: Colin Sanders, Dave Treacy, Geoff Cobb, Cedric \"Hubby\" Herbert, Unknown, Unknown.\n\n“Hubby” Herbert had been a prolific scorer in the 1960’s as centre forward for Moor Green FC in Sherwood Road, Hall Green. Having been formed from an amalgamation of Moor Green & Solihull Borough football clubs in 2007 after an arson attack in January 2005 had destroyed Moor Green’s stand & clubhouse, Solihull Moors play their games at Damson Parkway in Solihull.

He and John Gillham (President 1985-90), also pictured, were members of the unequalled League Championship and Senior Cup double-winning team of the 1972-73 season, captained by John Mulhall.\n\nTen seasons on, in 1982-83, Wigley was the player-manager of Silhill 1sts when they were runners-up in the Premier Division to Sutton United. Stan Bailey played in that team with the likes of Tom Ruane, Martin Carter, Keith Laishley and Richard Moss in addition to Brian and others. Their immense achievement was not matched for 33 years until coaches Paul “Patch” Curran and Martin Humphries achieved the same second spot for Silhill 1sts, behind Wake Green, in 2015-16.\n\nHaving triumphed 2-1 over West Wickham after extra time on a very wet pitch, Silhill 4ths celebrate on 30th March 1985 at Norsemen FC, Church Street, Edmonton, with their captain Hank Hankinson proudly displaying the Amateur Football Alliance London Minor Cup and heroic keeper Roger Mason the Shield. For two long hours, the 21-year-old Mason had played the game of his life between the posts. The two Silhill goalscorers were Denis Cook (2nd left, who headed the 1-1) and Joe Robinson (4th left, who shot the winner).\n\n60 seconds before the final whistle and a certain victory for Kent’s Southern Amateur League giants West Wickham, Cook powered in a superb bullet header to equalise 1-1, after Steve Green had risen and nodded to him a finely struck Keith Cromwell corner. Three minutes from the end of extra time, granite Ulsterman Robinson latched onto a cross from his leftwinger Aldo Ferrarin to lash in the 2-1 winner against all the odds.\n\nOn a later Saturday in front of the Silhill FC stand, the Silhill 4th team who had won the 1985 London Minor Cup Final 2-1: Back row (left to right): Roger MASON (goalkeeper), Adrian “Hank” HANKINSON (captain & left midfield), Martin READY (centre half substitute), Dave HUGHES (left wing > sweeper), Jeff PEARSON (centre half), Ray NABBS (centre forward), Ted WATERMAN (coach).

(Bill) Wright, back on Saturday 13th September 1958 and stood until Spring 1995. The structure cost just £450 and was erected by local woodworkers & builders Smith Bros (Quinton) Ltd.
