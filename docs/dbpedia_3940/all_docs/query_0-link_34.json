I had a look online to research the group and I decided that it would be a good opportunity for me so I applied.\n\nRight now I'm studying and interning and I'm looking to find relative part time work.\n\nThe most important thing in my life right now is expanding my knowledge and experience in different things such as Business and Politics in a relatively short amount of time.\n\nI would like to be involved in helping more young people become more conscious about politics and have them get involved\n\nI'm Elijah and I'm currently studying A-level Psychology, Sociology and English Literature and hope to go on to university to study Psychology and Education. My goal is to work in Educational Research and tackle societal disadvantages people face while trying to access good quality education and how we as a society can improve the education system for all people. I am excited to work within the Future Voices Group to help tackle the youth unemployment struggle in the UK from its core, which I believe is education. I am extremely interested in the wider view and intersectionality of employment and how I can use my voice to advocate for marginalised communities most effected by these issues.\n\nI joined FVG to help bring about systemic change to lower the disparity in employability and education between certain groups in society.\n\nI am currently studying Politics, History and Psychology at A-level and wish to go on to study Sociology and Social Policy at university.\n\nI am a part of my local youth council and the BYC NHS Youth Forum as I believe there is not enough participation in social policy from young people; It is important that we engage with the world around us as we are the future.\n\nWhat led you to be here today and prompted you to want to join the FVG?\n\nI wanted to join the Futures Voices Group because I have a plethora of insights and real life experiences to share about my journey to finding employment. Hopefully I'll be able use my voice to represent others like me who need someone to speak up for them. The FVG is the perfect forum for listening and then taking action.\n\nWhat are you up to now? (eg. In work/study/looking for work/volunteering)\n\nI graduated in 2020. I've had a few roles since then, currently I work for a technology consulting company as a digital consultant. I'm interested in anything digital/product.\n\nWhat is most important to you in your life right now?\n\nBalance! Navigating life as a young adult and balancing all the challenges that comes with this is quite tricky. Being career driven, whilst also finding time for family, friends, hobbies is the key challenge I'm working on in right now.\n\nWhat sort of changes do you want to be involved in making as part of the FVG?\n\nI want to empower young people to influence the youth employment landscape. Often programmes built to help young people are created without the input of young people. The FVG looks to change this, and hopefully we can be an example to other decision makers across the country.\n\nI decided to join the FVG as having seen the barriers young people are facing when getting into employment and I wanted to help young people to concur these barriers and by joining the FVG I think I can make a meaningful change by giving my ideas to help identify and solve the issues currently faced by young people getting into employment.\n\nI am currently in my first year at university studying law. The thing that is most important to me right now is learning new things and exploring new opportunities.\n\nWhat led you to be here today and prompted you to want to join the FVG?\n\nAs a long-time proponent of youth advocacy, when i heard about the work of the youth futures foundation and the opportunities being offered, I knew i wanted to be part of brilliant team working to influence what is one of the most pressing concerns among young people today - being able to find stable, fulfilling, meaningful employment.\n\nWhat are you up to now?\n\nI'm currently working towards completing my environmental practitioner degree apprenticeship, studying part time at Kingston University whilst working within the construction industry.\n\nWhat is most important to you in your life right now?\n\nI'm working on living less out of habit and more out of intent. I've been coming back to my love of music and the arts, and I can often be found wandering round a gallery or old building somewhere, usually with a big mug of tea.\n\nWhat sort of changes do you want to be involved in making as part of the FVG?\n\nSupporting more young women into the workplace and making the apprenticeship pathway more accessible to all are definitely things that I would love to improve through working in the future voices group.\n\nI'm Nedilson Da Silva and I am passionate about education, bodybuilding, martial arts and helping other people. I'm in university right now doing my law degree on my way towards becoming a lawyer. I'm driven to give my time to help others, it makes me feel fulfilling andÂ complete. Always learning and working towards one day being able to fulfil my dreams.\n\nWithin the FVG, I hope to be able to make a real difference to the society, bring a light to those that believe everything is lost and bring awareness towards a problem that concerns not one but all of us and shape the decision making. Ensuring that less young people feel the need to give up from their dreams and the need of going in the wrong direction to get what they want due to their current circumstances.\n\nI am so glad to be part of the new FVG cohort! My passion for young people and their access to employability, education and empowerment is what has influenced my interest in the FVG. As I enter my second year of university studying history and politics, I am excited to explore the career options available in policy making and politics itself. This season of my life is about taking risks and ensuring that each day I am showing up as the woman I hope to be in 5 years. My aim as I join the FVG is to learn as much as possible from those around me, to challenge the status quo and to be honest throughout the process.\n\nWhat led you to be here today and prompted you to want to join the FVG?\n\nThe experience of discrimination that myself and my peers face, as well as my interest in social movements and advocacy, made the FVG a really exciting opportunity for me. I was really interested in the opportunity to confront these barriers.\n\nWhat are you up to now? (eg. In work/study/looking for work/volunteering)\n\nI am a social sciences student at Lucy Cavendish College, University of Cambridge, and I volunteer for SHOUT's texting support service.\n\nWhat is most important to you in your life right now?\n\nMy family, pursuing my education, and doing my part to make a positive difference for others.\n\nWhat sort of changes do you want to be involved in making as part of the FVG?\n\nTackling the barriers to employment that young people face - particularly disabled and neurodiverse people who are disproportionately likely to face discrimination and poverty.\n\nI was motivated to join the FVG because, as an autistic individual who has also struggled with mental health issues, I found that, upon finishing university, I faced numerous challenges in the world of work and employment. My past and current experiences have made me passionate about tackling the issue of youth unemployment, particularly in young people with disabilities. I also want to bring more attention to the incredible pressure young people seem to be under in modern society, which I think is one of the major contributors to the rise in mental health issues we have seen in recent years.\n\nAt the moment I am working full time, but I am also considering a potential career change. I also volunteer with Ambitious About Autism, the National Autistic Society, and Great Ormond Street Hospital, and regularly try to use my lived experiences to improve understanding and awareness of autism and eating disorders.\n\nThe most important thing in my life right now is to somehow make lasting change and help others who are going through similar struggles to my own. I feel strongly that so many people's talents go unrecognised and are overlooked because of a lack of support, and believe we need to create an environment where everyone has the opportunity to fulfil their potential, and lead a happy life.\n\nWhile I am part of the FVG I really want to empower young people with complex mental health issues and disabilities. I want to be a part of creating an environment that allows a much more diverse range of individuals to thrive, in all aspects of life, rather than a culture that embraces a 'cookie cutter', 'tick box' approach.\n\nWhat led you to be here today and prompted you to want to join the FVG?\n\nThe heavy emphasis on putting the first-hand experiences and opinions of young people at the forefront, allowing for the voices of young people to be far than tokenistic, as we are empowered to work on behalf of fellow young people facing the same barriers when it comes to unemployment.\n\nWhat are you up to at the moment?\n\nAt the moment, I am studying at university\n\nWhat is most important to you in your life at the moment?\n\nRight now, my focus is on my studies, faith, and personal development\n\nHello my names Tyler and I am a future voices ambassador.\n\nI have committed to starting this important journey due to many reasons. First and foremost, i myself have Dyspraxia which is a learning disability.\n\nThis has motivated me to take on this role to show that people with disabilities can help just as much as someone without one and never let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\nMy sole purpose of doing this role is to be a voice for others who are struggling accessing employment as-well as people who have hidden disabilities.\n\nI currently work in retail, proudly serving the local community with a smile and a friendly face. I am committed to my current job but truth be told, I would love to take a big role supporting others in need.\n\nFinally, I would like to create awareness to these big topics and I really do hope more employers sign to the disability confident scheme to prevent discrimination and also discuss the disadvantages that people may face in regards to barriers to employment.\n\nI would like to see a future where people are treated equally in all environments and increased employment with youthÂ Â and give them an equal opportunity to access employment and thrive within there chosen career or job\n\nAs someone who identifies as part of the BAME and international student community in the UK, I have lived experience struggling to secure a job myself, and understands the tremendous amount of stress and anxiety that comes alongside this process. Thus, just as many young ambassadors from FVG in the past, I am motivated to be part of the solution, and advocate for better, efficient, and meaningful solutions that tackles youth unemployment issues once and for all.\n\nAs a fresh graduate, I am going to start my first job working for SEO London as its Corporate Law Programme Coordinator, supporting outstanding candidates from BAME or social mobility qualifying backgrounds to secure a career in law. In the meantime, I am also actively volunteering for CIVICUS as its Youth Action Team Member, supporting and amplifying the voices of young people/youth-led organisations worldwide.\n\nTo me, being able to serve my community, alleviate the suffering of others; and at the same time to live a balanced and happy life would be some of my key priorities at the moment. I always believe that every action and step, no matter how small they are, could eventually play a major role in the creation of a better world in the future!\n\nAs part of the FVG, I am determined to gather and amplify the concerns and struggles young people face while seeking employment, and trying to live a better life within our society nowadays. Furthermore, by collaborating with lawmakers and various stakeholders, I look forward to proposing and advocating for significant policy changes in the country's youth employment policies Ã¢â¬â ensuring that they are truly inclusive and equal for all.\n\nWhat led you to be here today and prompted you to want to join the FVG?\n\nI wanted to join FVG since I felt the career advice in education wasn't effective.\n\nWhat are you up to now? (eg. In work/study/looking for work/volunteering)\n\nRight now I am volunteering and studying at sixth form.\n\nWhat is most important to you in your life right now?\n\nFocusing on balancing my work with home life, I am focusing on my relationships.\n\nWhat sort of changes do you want to be involved in making as part of the FVG?\n\nI want to inform young people on how to be confident in the workplace.\n\nAnna shapes and delivers our organisational strategy by leading our stakeholder management and connecting insights to find solutions to drive systemic change.
