Below are a few of the stops Willem made along the way.\n\nAce Hotel Palm Springs | July 2, 2024\n\nCorey Wash Walks on the “Sunny Side”\n\nDon’t forget to log off. That’s the gist of “Sunny Side,” Corey Wash’s commission for the Palm Springs mural wall, which gets a refresh every spring in time for Desert Gold, our Coachella-season shindig.

A vision in all black, the 28-year-old artist dons only a trace of color — the smattering of red tattoos that start on her left cheek and snake their way down her neck and arms, punctuating the thick collage of black ink. Her studio, on the other hand, is almost ethereal. Its white walls hold shelves brimming with machines, tools and containers of organic materials that Hyungi foraged, found or made.\n\nAce Hotel | February 12, 2024\n\nSoy Sauce, Like a Fine Wine\n\nEri Miyagi and Miki Nomura started Brooklyn-based Japanese condiment company Cabi Foods in 2022 for multitude reasons. One, their love of a really good mold called koji. Two, to share the Japanese home cooking they grew up on and its inherent emphasis on flavor and fresh ingredients. And to destroy the idea of Japanese condiments that “just sit there.” Launching with a yuzu vinegar, dashi soy sauce and sansho peppercorn miso — all sourced from small, regional producers — Cabi condiments focus on Japanese-specific flavors that go with anything: kale, chicken, vanilla ice cream.\n\nAce Hotel Los Angeles | January 29, 2024\n\nFantasma Paraiso / Phantom Paradise\n\nHave you ever seen someone you love reduced to a blurry apparition on Google Street View?
