        "text": "Diversity and inclusion are key themes of King Charles III's coronation ceremony, which will take place on Saturday, May 6. The king wanted a less pompous ceremony than that of his mother, 70 years ago – one that is more in line with the reality of a country where Christians no longer represent the majority, where many struggle to pay their bills, and where excessively lavish celebrations would be considered inappropriate. Elizabeth Anionwu, a British woman of Irish and Nigerian descent, will carry the orb, one of the royal symbols. Floella Benjamin, of Caribbean origin, will be in charge of one of the scepters. Three female bishops will also participate in the service, alongside the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. Only 2,000 people have been invited to Westminster Abbey, including representatives of all faiths and hundreds of community leaders. The number of aristocrats in attendance will be much lower than in 1953.\n\nHowever, the close relatives of the Windsor family will still be present, including Hugh Grosvenor, the 7th duke of Westminster, who will have a prominent place in the procession. The blond, youthful-looking man is part of the inner circle: He is the king's godson. His father, Gerald, who was also a member of the House of Lords and a general in the British Army, was a close friend of the monarch. \"Hughie,\" as he is called by his family, according to monarchy experts, is also the godfather of Prince George (second in line to the throne). His mother, Natalia Phillips, a descendant of the Romanovs, is the godmother of Prince William. One of his three sisters, Lady Edwina, had Princess Diana as her godmother. Part gentleman farmer, part fund manager, Grosvenor is part of an exclusive club perpetuating centuries-old and unequal traditions.\n\nHe is also one of the richest Britons in the country, ranking 13th according to a 2022 Sunday Times report. He inherited the immense fortune of the Grosvenor family, estimated at around £10 billion, by avoiding inheritance taxes (the fortune is held in trusts) and according to the old rule of male primogeniture still in force in British aristocracy (but not in the royal family, who abolished it in 2013). Grosvenor is wealthier than the king, who, according to a thorough investigation by The Guardian, has a personal fortune of £1.8 billion.\n\nThe most coveted fiancé in the UK\n\nThe duke of Westminster is at the helm of a fabulous real estate portfolio, including 300 acres (approximately 121 hectares) in the heart of London, comprising a large portion of the posh neighborhoods of Mayfair and Belgravia. These possessions have been in the family since 1677, when one of his ancestors, Thomas Grosvenor, married the heiress Mary Davies. The Grosvenor empire also includes thousands of hectares in northern England, in Lancashire and around Eaton Hall, the ancestral estate in Cheshire. It also includes forests in the Scottish Highlands and 15,000 hectares near Seville, Spain, where Prince William and Prince Harry often go hunting for partridge and wild boar."
