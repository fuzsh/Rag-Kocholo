        "text": "I have been playing football since I was a little boy. I’ve had love for the sport since I first stepped on the field; I have aspired to play at the collegiate level. I know that playing at a college level is a lot of hard work and dedication to the sport and the school.\n\nI am always working to improve my skills mentally as well as physically. I am a very fast learner. I do my best to become one of the best and hardest working student-athletes you’ll find.\n\nOn the field I try to learn as much as I can and always push myself 100% as well as off the field.\n\nI want to attend a college where I can get a good education and learn all I can on the football field and in the classroom. I am open to all options I will take the best choice i am offered"
