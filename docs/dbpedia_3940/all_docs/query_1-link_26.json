        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\n‘What is’t to us if taxes rise or fall?\n\nThanks to our fortune, we pay none at all.’\n\nC\n\nHARLES\n\nC\n\nHURCHILL, 1731–64\n\nAnyone who noticed the photographs of the 6th Duke of Westminster that appeared occasionally over the years in the press and elsewhere will have been struck by the deep, engraved lines of unhappiness that seemed to grow worse as time passed. Compare these pictures, especially those taken when he was unaware that a camera was nearby, with the photograph still held by the duke’s old school, Harrow, and one sees the same look: an ingrained, almost fathomless strain of melancholy.\n\nIn later life, the duke insisted that being plucked from relative obscurity to head the family business was the chief cause of his depression, and there is no doubt much truth in this, but there is something else, which I believe he inherited from his ancestors. I don’t mean inherited through his genes, but rather through the consciousness that for all their exalted status as knights, marquesses and finally dukes, the Grosvenors were failures. Their tragedy, as I argue in this book, is that they were really only good at one thing: making and keeping money.\n\nEven during the heyday of aristocratic power and prestige – when to be a large landowner created a generally accepted assumption that one was a superior being in every way – the Dukes of Westminster had to face the uncomfortable fact that they had never really succeeded as soldiers or politicians, academics, writers or artists. Other rich, landed families had produced writers and intellectuals (Bertrand Russell was the grandson of Prime Minister Lord John Russell, for example) or, more commonly, politicians. Various Grosvenors had several times been elected to Parliament, but only during periods of history when standing and position counted for a great deal among the electorate, and they had never attained ministerial rank. Worse, they had achieved nothing notable during the long centuries when to be an aristocrat meant success was always within reach since the mere fact of being an aristocrat created an assumption that one would be a brilliant soldier or statesman. At its best, this produced the likes of Winston Churchill; at its worst, it produced a long line of incompetents. Service to the state or the arts or sciences might have helped justify unearned privilege, but the Grosvenors never quite made the grade.\n\nAs the political power of the aristocracy declined, it became far more important that the family should at least occasionally produce someone who had ability. Why else should great landowners automatically have the right – a right ninety-two peers retain to this day – to sit in the House of Lords and influence the legislation that governs all our lives?\n\nAs twentieth-century customs and values began to change, aristocratic landowners found it increasingly difficult to justify the fact that for centuries they had benefited from a system largely devised by them, for their own benefit. The historic scandal of enclosure is a good example: for centuries the poor had exercised their ancient right to collect firewood and graze their animals on the vast areas of common land that stretched across much of England. Sensing that greater profits could be made if the poor were deprived of these rights, the big landowners began to enclose – or steal – land, and as the pace of enclosure increased, tens of thousands of cottagers were dispossessed without compensation. A whole class of beggars was created by enclosure and these people were then defined as the feckless, dangerous, threatening poor by the same authorities who had dispossessed them. Something similar was happening in Scotland as late as the mid-nineteenth century: landowners such as the Duke of Sutherland decided that more money could be made from sheep than from the rents received from thousands of crofters, so the crofters were evicted. In Ireland, while largely absentee aristocratic English landlords exported surplus food during the 1840s and 1850s, their rent-racked tenants were allowed to starve in their millions when potato blight destroyed the staple diet of the poor.\n\nThe squalid history of Britain’s big aristocratic landowners has been admirably described in Chris Bryant’s book, Entitled, and there is no need for anything further to be said here on the subject.\n\nThe Grosvenors, and especially Gerald Grosvenor, were not particularly bad landlords. In fact, it was probably the one thing they were really good at. But the 6th Duke was keenly aware that being a landlord was no longer enough; much more was expected of him than of his ancestors. From one point of view, of course, he did not have much to live up to, as the Grosvenors had shown they were really only good at making money, but rather than putting the 6th Duke at his ease, this sense of past family failure made him feel deeply uncomfortable. The great weight of his own family’s history bore down on him and whispered, ‘Where are the great deeds and service to the state that justify your dukedom?’\n\nFaced with this question Gerald Grosvenor could only lament the fact that fate had once more created a Duke of Westminster whose main attribute was keeping the family fortune intact – and nothing else. As we will see, what the 6th Duke really wanted was to be rich and anonymous so he could simply have fun – so he could be as flamboyant a playboy as his ancestor the 2nd Duke had been.\n\nFor much of the latter part of his life, the 6th Duke was also a sex addict who paid for escort girls to visit his small, discreetly situated house just off London’s Oxford Street. Away from the dynastic necessity of sitting at the top of a business he had never wanted to run, and away from his crippling sense of duty, the 6th Duke of Westminster just wanted to have fun – and sex – with beautiful women who had nothing to do with the stultifying attitudes and values of the English aristocracy.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nREINVENTING THE PAST\n\n‘In 1861, 421 men owned nearly 23 million acres of the British Isles.’\n\nA\n\nNTHONY\n\nS\n\nAMPSON,\n\nA\n\nNATOMY OF\n\nB\n\nRITAIN\n\nThe deference paid to dukes is an extraordinary thing, but then the British have always been obsessed with the aristocracy and dukes have an added interest since, compared to most other titles, they are comparatively rare. Genealogists pay great attention to the fact that there are five peerages (English, United Kingdom, Great Britain, Scotland and Ireland) and English dukes take precedence over the others.\n\nDukedoms also have an ancient lineage – the first duke was created more than 600 years ago when Edward III made his eldest son a duke, but there have been fewer than 500 dukes and duchesses in the ensuing 600 years. Compared to knighthoods, which today are given to almost anyone with enough money and influence, dukedoms would appear to be genuinely special, but scratch beneath the surface and the reality is very different. For example, a monarch can make dukes of as many of his or her friends and relatives as he or she chooses.\n\nCharles II created twenty-six dukes, including six given to his bastard sons on the grounds that they were… well… his sons.\n\nIt took a long time for the Grosvenors to reach the dizzy heights of a dukedom. Indeed, their dukedom is the youngest and most recent non-royal dukedom in existence. For centuries they were much further down the list of nobility and only reached ducal status in the nineteenth century – even then for no other good reason than that they were extraordinarily rich.\n\nIt’s important to look in detail at Gerald Grosvenor’s ancestors, for here we will find the seeds of his own character. Despite few of his ancestors achieving much outside the privileges of their positions of wealth Gerald Grosvenor felt the huge weight of his own family history – and it was a weight he found at times unbearable.\n\nThere had been moderate achievers among his ancestors – the 2nd Duke, known as Bendor after his grandfather’s favourite racehorse, was a decorated soldier, for example – but there was a darker side to the past: the 3rd Duke appears to have been so psychologically damaged that he became a recluse living in retirement by the seaside, obsessed solely with breeding ducks. He took no part in running the family business and was allowed only a small allowance throughout his life. One or two ancestors, perhaps especially Bendor, were promiscuous reactionaries who felt that the lower orders should always know their place. Several ancestors were addicted to buying sex – something that echoes the 6th Duke’s own fascination with escort girls.\n\nAccording to family legend, the Grosvenor history really begins in 1066 with the arrival of William the Conqueror. But does it really? Deferential nineteenth-century historians – and the Grosvenors themselves – liked to repeat the story that the first Grosvenor was Hugh Lupus, who they claimed was a nephew of William. Lupus’s nickname was ‘gros veneur’. The Grosvenors claimed that ‘gros veneur’ meant Lupus was the ‘King’s chief huntsman’, or ‘grand master of the royal hounds’. In fact, the name Grosvenor and the surviving records give no indication of status – gros veneur simply meant ‘fat huntsman’ in Norman French, a designation heartily disliked by more recent Grosvenors.\n\nSomeone called Lupus certainly helped with the invasion of England – his father contributed sixty ships to the fleet – and he was rewarded by being made Earl of Chester. He was also a thoroughly unpleasant character. When the 1st Duke of Westminster was rebuilding Eaton Hall in the 1870s, he decided to commission a statue of his putative ancestor Hugh Lupus – until a little research revealed that Lupus was a greedy, vindictive sensualist who fathered more than a dozen bastard children. The statue went ahead but the duke admitted he had almost cancelled the whole project.\n\nOthers have questioned the veracity of the whole Lupus story. One anonymous source explained that early in the nineteenth century, as their wealth and prestige increased, the Grosvenors became desperate for what might best be called a magnificent creation myth. Certainly the Lupus story seems to have sprung into vigorous existence in the early nineteenth century (1802, to be precise) when the 2nd Earl Grosvenor decided the family needed publicly to advertise its ancient lineage.\n\nThe highly regarded Survey of London, founded by Charles Ashbee in 1894 and first published in 1900, had no reason to adopt the usual deferential attitude to noble families, since the survey was intended merely to record London’s architectural monuments at a time when they were being demolished at a shocking rate.\n\nThe survey introduces the Grosvenor family, London’s biggest landlords, in a more matter-of-fact, perhaps even sceptical, manner:\n\n‘The Grosvenors were an ancient Cheshire family claiming a somewhat tenuous descent from Hugh Lupus, first Earl of Chester, one of William the Conqueror’s foremost knights and possibly his nephew.’ (Survey of London Vol XXXIX).\n\nAlternatively, we are told that William the Conqueror’s huntsman, Gilbert le Gros Veneur, was a nephew of Hugh Lupus, who in turn was a nephew of William.\n\nDespite the confusions and tall tales surrounding this much-disputed heritage, we do know that by 1160 Robert Le Grosvenor – who seems to have been a great-nephew of Lupus – had settled on land in Cheshire that had been taken from the native British a century earlier by the Conqueror. That land is still held by the Grosvenor family today.\n\nBut the desire to make people think the first Grosvenor was much more than a tubby hunt servant suggests an unease about position that has afflicted many members of the family since, and none more so than Gerald Grosvenor, the 6th Duke.\n\nIn 1879, the Political Tract Society issued a pamphlet, Our Old Nobility, soon after the Grosvenors had been offered a dukedom, which brutally skewered the family’s pretensions to noble titles:\n\nTo give a fair start in life to a royal bastard, to reward a successful general, to gratify the ambition of a statesman, to add new lustre to a great historic house that has rendered eminent service to the country – these are reasons we can at any rate understand, but to elevate a man to a dukedom because he happens to be the biggest landlord in London is an action one cannot admire.\n\nThe 1st Duke of Westminster was apparently furious at these criticisms, but there was little he could do about it as they were true.\n\nFor centuries the family had become ever richer, but where were the noble acts that should accompany noble titles? Where were the great statesmen and legislators? They were conspicuous only by their absence – an absence that was to prey horribly on the mind of the 6th Duke. Money was the root of their success and also the root of this nagging sense of failure.\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nMARRIAGE A-LA-MODE\n\n‘The tragedy of his life was that the only thing he could make was money.’\n\nP\n\nRIVATE\n\nE YE OBITUARY\n\nAfter Robert Le Grosvenor took possession of that gift of land in Cheshire there followed a line of undistinguished but harmless Grosvenors, mostly Roberts and Hughs. All lived quietly on their northern estates, only stirring themselves when it was time to find a wife – with money – for a son and heir. Almost all their early marriages were financially astute. The Robert Grosvenor who died in 1396, for example, had married the wealthy widow of one Thomas Belgrave – a family connection that survives today in the name of the Belgravia region of London, one of the Grosvenors’ greatest assets. A little over half a century later, in 1453, Raufe Grosvenor married Joan Eaton, whose dowry included a castle and lands just outside Chester.\n\nEven after the most financially spectacular marriage of all – the mid-seventeenth-century union of Sir Thomas Grosvenor and Mary Davies – the Grosvenors were still usually at the front of the queue when a wealthy young woman was in the offing. As one Eaton Estate worker complained, ‘Those fucking Grosvenors can smell money ten miles away.’\n\nThe eighteenth century certainly provided continued rich pickings – in 1794, for example, Robert Baron Grosvenor married Eleanor Egerton, the only child of the enormously wealthy Baron de Wilton.\n\nAs well as marrying into money, the Grosvenors were able to buy position – in 1622 Sir Richard Grosvenor paid £1,000 to James I for a baronetcy. A colossal sum at the time, but no more in real terms than a newspaper baron, businessman or landowner might pay via political donation for a similar title today.\n\nSir Richard’s son, also Richard, made a rare financial mistake by supporting the Crown in the English civil war and his land was confiscated – only to be returned to him upon the restoration of Charles II.\n\nSir Thomas Grosvenor inherited the baronetcy in 1665 when he was just eight and, according to a story that has passed almost into legend, it was Thomas’s marriage that – from a financial point of view – was the greatest the Grosvenors were ever to make. His bride? A mentally unstable twelve-year-old.\n\nPopularly known at the time as the Maid of Ebury, Mary Davies’s wealth was legendary. Calling her the ‘Maid of Ebury’ by a curious kind of reverse psychology had the effect of making her seem even richer than she really was. It created a huge gulf of perception – how, people liked to ask, could an innocent, ignorant milkmaid be in possession of so much?\n\nBy the time she was offered to Sir Thomas Grosvenor, Mary had already been offered elsewhere several times, but without clinching the deal. Her price was high. She had been dangled in front of several wealthy potential husbands, but each time the marriage had not gone ahead because the financial side of things could not be agreed to the satisfaction of all parties. Indeed, the kind of marriage her family were trying to arrange was, for Mary, precisely the loveless arrangement satirised in Hogarth’s famous series of pictures Marriage A-la-Mode. Her marriage was to be an exchange: her fortune in return for entry to the nobility. Mary, of course, had absolutely no say in the matter and when the most likely deal – marriage to Lord Berkeley – failed, her parents simply redoubled their efforts, letting it be known from one end of the kingdom to the other that here was a prize worth having. Word eventually no doubt reached Cheshire and the youthful Sir Thomas Grosvenor hastened to London.\n\n* * *\n\nThe desire for ever greater riches, which has always characterised the Grosvenors, began early. Even without the extraordinary marriage he was about to make, Sir Thomas was already very wealthy indeed. His income from a number of Welsh lead mines (not to mention those earlier family marriages) was estimated at £5,000 a year – to get an idea of the value of that sum in 2018, you need to multiply by roughly 100 to give a figure of around £500,000.\n\nIn the late 1670s, having completed the Grand Tour of Europe, Sir Thomas decided while still in his early twenties to put some of his wealth to good use by rebuilding his house at Eaton in Cheshire. He wanted a home that would reflect his status and his sense of himself as a man of fashion. This meant a long journey from Chester to London by coach to consult a suitably grand and expensive architect. The journey to London would have been arduous and dangerous – Samuel Pepys recorded in 1663 that it was not unusual for a gentlemen leaving his country house for a trip to London to first make his will.\n\nSir Thomas knew all about Mary Davies already and it must have seemed perfectly sensible to combine two business matters – a new house and a new wife – during the same trip. Certainly at some time during this visit to London a marriage to Mary Davies was discussed.\n\nBut how had Mary come to be quite so wealthy? The answer is that she had inherited large areas of what is now London’s West End through the extraordinary money-making abilities of her great-uncle Hugh Audley. Audley had amassed his fortune while working for the Court of Wards and Liveries. This was a much hated, archaic institution whose ostensible function was to manage land and investments on behalf of children who had inherited their lands, businesses and titles while still minors. In practice, instead of managing their money and land, the Court took the revenues and gave them to the king.\n\nHugh Audley had been a scrivener and chief clerk to the Court of Wards and he skilfully used his position to line his pockets. A scrivener at that time carried out many of the duties that would now fall within the jurisdiction of a lawyer, but he also lent money at high rates of interest.\n\nThe money raised by the Court of Wards was, according to London historian Peter Thorold, ‘a complex form of inheritance tax’. It is perhaps ironic that what was to become the major part of the Grosvenor’s fabulous wealth – their London estates – had its origin in the ‘inheritance tax’ work of Hugh Audley. When the 6th Duke died in 2016 he and the Grosvenor Group had arranged their affairs in such a way that – perfectly legally – no inheritance tax was paid on a fortune estimated at somewhere between £9 billion and £13 billion.\n\nLike his descendants, Hugh Audley was so famous for his ability to acquire wealth that towards the end of his life he was even persuaded to write a book explaining how he did it. This was arguably the first in a long line of get-rich-quick guides. The Way to be Rich According to the Practice of the Great Audley (published in 1662) actually says almost nothing about getting rich. It simply explains at some length that in order to be rich you need to be parsimonious. If you look after the pennies, the author tells us, the pounds will look after themselves. The truth is that Audley left out the key means by which his initial fortune had been made – he took bribes and lent money at exorbitant rates of interest through his Court of Wards connections.\n\nBut we must be wary of judging the standards of one age by those of another. The appeal of government posts such as Audley’s was precisely that"
