        "text": "A SUPERCOMPUTER has predicted the final Championship table after the fixture list was released.\n\nThe season kicks off on August 9 with two games as Blackburn take on newly promoted Derby and recently relegated Sheffield United head to Preston.\n\nWayne Rooney has landed the Plymouth job and his reign starts away to Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nAnd the supercomputer at Grosvenor Sport reckons it could be a tough season ahead for the former Manchester United and England star.\n\nThey believe Plymouth will find themselves in a relegation battle but will narrowly avoid the drop by six points.\n\nAnd after simulating every Championship match over 1,000 times, the statisticians claim Blackburn, Cardiff and Oxford will go down instead.\n\nAt the other end of the table, Burnley are expected to immediately bounce back to the Premier League and win the league.\n\nThe prediction comes despite the Clarets not yet appointing a new boss after Vincent Kompany left for Bayern Munich.\n\nBurnley have been linked to Scott Parker, Ruud van Nistelrooy and West Brom manager Carlos Corberan.\n\nLeeds lost to Southampton in the play-off final last month and have been tipped to gain automatic promotion next year.\n\nBEST FREE BET SIGN UP OFFERS FOR UK BOOKMAKERS\n\nHull, Middlesbrough, Watford and Norwich are set to battle it out in the play-offs.\n\nAnd after a valiant effort in the Premier League, Luton are expected to miss out on the top six by two points.\n\nSheffield United also went down from the top-flight last season but are once again expected to have a tough year."
