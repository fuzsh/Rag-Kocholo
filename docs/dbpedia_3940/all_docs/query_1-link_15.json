        "text": "Did you know (or do you remember) that before it was the KeyBank Center, before it was the First Niagara Center, before it was the HSBC Arena, and before it was the Marine Midland Arena, the designated name for the Buffalo Sabres’ home was known as the Crossroads Arena?\n\nHaving recently received a large donation from the Buffalo News archives (more about this to follow in a future blog post), it was fun to discover these building plans amidst the plethora of material. The plans themselves are from 1994, thus for at least two years the building was settled on the Crossroads moniker – then, in 1996, the year the arena opened, Marine Midland Bank paid $15 million (according to this ballparks and arenas history website) to acquire the naming rights.\n\nAs a fan of the Sabres (despite the trials and tribulations that entails), this was a fun piece of sports history to discover. The plans can be viewed anytime at the Grosvenor Room special collections in Buffalo’s downtown Central Library.\n\nWarren Spahn, the left-handed baseball pitcher, didn’t actually graduate from South Park High School when a career in sports intervened. The Cy Young Award winner, who played for 21 years in the National League and has the distinction of having been the left-handed pitcher to win the most games in his career (363), is shown here in the South Park Dial yearbook from 1939, just three years before his debut in the Major League.\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThese Buffalo Bills caricatures were found in the Sports in Buffalo scrapbook at the Central Library’s Grosvenor Room. The Courier Express featured the drawings during the 1965 season, a year that the Bills won the AFL Championship, upsetting the favorite, San Diego, 23-0. Ranked third in team offense and first in defense, many ’65 Bills team members went on to play in the Pro Bowl and were ranked as first team All-Pro players.
