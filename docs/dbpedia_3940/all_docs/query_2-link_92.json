        "text": "With the new season nearly upon us, Director of Sport Kieran Power has announced his first team squad for the 2023/24 National League One campaign.\n\nKIERAN POWER, DIRECTOR OF SPORT AND PERFORMANCE\n\n“I am pleased today to announce our playing squad for the upcoming season. Whilst we say goodbye to a number of players, we are confident we have built on the progress made over the last few seasons through the retention of key players and also adding a range of experience and youth with our exciting new signings.\n\nThe boys have been working hard over the last two months in preparation for the season, and are raring to get going. We hope the Park faithful will all get behind the squad, starting this Saturday at our open-training session, as we aim for another successful season in National League One.”\n\nNEW SIGNINGS\n\nPROPS\n\nConor Carey – Experienced tighthead prop from Connacht, Northampton, Perpignan and Worcester Warriors, Conor will bring a wealth of experience to the pack.\n\nJosh Cilia – Dynamic young ball playing prop joins Park from Bath University having had previous Nat 1 experience with Bishop’s Stortford.\n\nMaurice Nwakor – A familiar face, Maurice returns to the club for his second spell after gaining Championship experience with London Scottish.
