        "text": "John Trumbull created this oil sketch in 1797, a decade after he painted the Battle of Bunker’s Hill. The sketch was commissioned by Anne Flore Millet, Marquise de Bréhan (1749–1826), a French aristocrat and portraitist who particularly admired the detail of Lieutenant Grosvenor (1744–1825) and his servant from the original composition. The servant was long thought to depict Peter Salem (ca. 1750–1816). However, recent research suggests that he represents an enslaved man known as Asaba (dates unknown),\n\nlater recorded as a free servant in Grosvenor’s household."
