Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nHere's a closer look at Britain's richest millennial.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 7th Duke of Westminster, Hugh Grosvenor, was recently named the UK's richest person under 35 by The Times of London. He is worth £9.878 billion.\n\nGrosvenor is the 11th richest person in the UK, according to the Times' 2023 Rich List, which was released in May. It also named him the country's richest person under 35.\n\nIn 2022, he was ranked 12th on the Times' Rich List. In the year since, his wealth has increased to £9.878 billion from £9.726 billion, according to the Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was just 25 when he inherited his wealth and title from his father, Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor, who died suddenly in 2016.\n\nGerald Cavendish Grosvenor, the 6th Duke and a close friend of the Queen and then-Prince Charles, was 64 when he died of a heart attack on August 9, 2016. At the time, he was the 114th wealthiest person in the world, with a fortune of around £9 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nHugh Grosvenor inherited his father's billions, as well as his estates in the wealthy London neighborhoods of Belgravia and Mayfair, and the ancestral home in Cheshire, Eaton Hall. As much of the wealth was passed down through family trusts, he did not have to pay billions in inheritance taxes, The Guardian reported.\n\nThe Grosvenor family's website says, \"As Grosvenor family members, who are the beneficiaries of the trusts, are all UK residents – as their predecessors have been for nearly 1,000 years – they pay UK taxes in the same way as the rest of the UK population, while being entitled to the same exemptions.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir title goes back to 1874. The 1st Duke of Westminster, Hugh Lupus Grosvenor, was friends with Queen Victoria.\n\nThe family can trace its lineage back almost 1,000 years. Much of the family's fortune comes from a 17th-century dowry given to a Sir Thomas Grosvenor, which included 500 acres of land just outside of London, Bloomberg reported.\n\nThe 1st Duke of Westminster was born at Eaton Hall — which remains the family seat — and served as a member of parliament before joining the House of Lords. His wife was a friend of Queen Victoria's, according to Westminster Abbey, and Prime Minister William Gladstone honored him with the title in 1874.\n\nThe duke's oldest son preceded him in death, and the title passed to his grandson, Hugh Richard Arthur Grosvenor. Throughout history, the title has passed on to male heirs, including cousins, brothers, and in the case of Hugh Grosvenor, father to son.\n\nGrosvenor was born on January 29, 1991, to Gerald Grosvenor and his wife, Natalia. He was known as Earl Grosvenor.\n\nGrosvenor's mother, Natalia, is a direct descendant of the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin and King George II, the London Evening Standard reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough he has two older sisters, Grosvenor inherited the title of duke and the family estates thanks to an 11th-century tradition that names the first-born son as heir.\n\nPrimogeniture was established in the 11th century in England and determines that the first-born son inherits power and wealth. So, despite having two older sisters, Grosvenor inherited the Westminster title and estate on his father's death — his sisters, however, did receive trust funds.\n\nThe photograph taken at his oldest sister Lady Tamara Grosvenor's wedding to Edward van Cutsem in 2004 indicates the four Grosvenor siblings.\n\nCircled left is his younger sister, Lady Viola, who is now 30. She runs an art-therapy business, according to the Times of London. She is also married to the Dragoon Guards officer Angus Roberts, Tatler reported.\n\nSecond from left is Lady Edwina, who is now 41 and a prison-reform campaigner. She is married to the British TV presenter Dan Snow.\n\nLady Tamara, 42, remains married to van Cutsem, a close friend of Prince William.\n\nGrosvenor is circled right. He was 13 at the time of his sister's 2004 wedding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the family's extraordinary wealth, Grosvenor's parents reportedly wanted him to have an upbringing that was as normal as possible, and he attended local schools.\n\nGrosvenor attended a local state primary school before going to a private school, Ellesmere College in Shropshire, for high school.\n\n\"His mum, Tally, was keen on the children having a more normal upbringing, so almost consciously didn't want them to go to all those Eton, Harrow sort of places and risk turning into that arrogant, entitled type of person,\" a friend told The Telegraph in April.\n\nHis father said in an interview with the Independent in 1992, \"He's a lucky boy to be given all the material things in life, but he'll need to be robust mentally to survive. There are many pitfalls when one inherits such an enormous amount of money, especially in adolescence.\n\n\"He's been born with the longest silver spoon anyone can have, but he can't go through life sucking on it. He has to put back what he has been given.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe attended Newcastle University and mostly kept a low profile until his 21st birthday, which reportedly cost $6.3 million and was attended by Prince Harry.\n\nGrosvenor studied countryside management at Newcastle University, according to the Times.\n\nIn 2012, he celebrated his 21st birthday with a \"black tie and neon\" party for 800 guests — including Prince Harry — at the family estate, Eaton Hall, in Cheshire. According to attendees, there were fireworks, champagne, and performances from the English comedian Michael McIntyre and the hip-hop band Rizzle Kicks.\n\nIn a speech at the party, his father said Grosvenor was the first heir for 133 years to be both born at Eaton Hall and to celebrate their 21st birthday there, Cheshire Live reported. The last person before him was the second duke, who was born in 1879.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrosvenor is closely connected to the royal family. In fact, King Charles is his godfather, and he is a godfather to Prince George.\n\nThe Grosvenors have remained closely tied to the royal family. Then-Prince Charles, now King Charles, asked Grosvenor's father, Gerald, to be a mentor to Prince William when he was young.\n\nIn turn, William asked Hugh Grosvenor to be a godfather to his own son, Prince George. Grosvenor was 22 when Prince George was christened at St. James's Palace in London in 2013. He was one of seven godparents: Among the others are King Charles' niece — and Prince William's cousin — Zara Tindall, and Edward van Cutsem, the brother to Grosvenor's brother-in-law William van Cutsem.\n\nPrince William and Prince Harry have also reportedly spent time at Grosvenor's hunting estate in Spain.\n\nAnd in June 2018, the duke handed over the then-newly built Defence and National Rehabilitation Centre in Leeds to the nation in an event also attended by Prince William.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the chair of the Grosvenor Group, he now oversees the family's real-estate portfolio, which has properties in 43 cities across 10 countries, according to the Times.\n\nThe estate includes the exclusive London neighborhoods of Mayfair and Belgravia. The centerpiece is Eaton Square, an elongated square of elegant townhouses overlooking private gardens and close to Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe Grosvenor Group's property empire also includes buildings in cities across the world, such as San Francisco and Washington, DC, in the US, and Stockholm, Tokyo, and Beijing. The buildings include luxury retail spaces, shopping districts, offices, and residences.\n\nHe also oversees the family investment office, which manages rural estates across the UK and abroad, and employs 450 people. The Grosvenor Group also invests in other industries, such as food and agricultural technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe is also the chair of the family's charitable foundation, which focuses on vulnerable children, and he donated millions to help fight COVID-19.\n\nHe oversees the Grosvenor Group's charity work and \"is firmly committed to using his position and the resources in his care to make a positive contribution to society, just as previous generations of his family have done before him,\" according to the Grosvenor website.\n\nThe duke also serves as chair of trustees for the Westminster Group, his family's charitable foundation, which provides grants to organizations supporting and working with at-risk children.\n\n\"We want young people to thrive, we want to give them the opportunities,\" he said in a video for the foundation. \"So many of us are lucky enough to have opportunities in life which we often take for granted, but so many aren't.\"\n\nThe Defence and National Rehabilitation Centre in Leeds, a rehabilitation center for injured troops that opened in 2018, was an initiative led by Grosvenor's father, according to a press release. The family has personally gifted £105 million to the project, according to the Grosvenor website.\n\nIn 2020, the duke also made headlines for donating more than $15.6 million to charities to help the United Kingdom fight the coronavirus. Among the donations, he pledged $6.2 million to the NHS to help healthcare workers and their families, as well as $3.8 million for medical research, CNN reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe inherited the family's home in Cheshire, Eaton Hall, which sits on approximately 11,000 acres owned by the Grosvenors.\n\nEaton Estate in the Cheshire countryside has been home to the Grosvenor family since the 1400s. It includes hundreds of residential, commercial, and agricultural properties, which can be rented.\n\nBut at the center of the estate is Eaton Hall, the family's home on the banks of the River Dee, just south of Chester. The property is surrounded by expansive, well-manicured gardens and has undergone various iterations, including demolitions and rebuilds. The current main home was built in 1967, and now has a French-châteaux-style façade.\n\nIn nearby Chester is the Grosvenor Museum, which houses some of the family's collection of art, which was mostly collected during the late 18th and early 19th century. Their collection includes pieces by Velázquez, Rembrandt, and Lucian Freud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe represents Great Britain in skeet shooting.\n\nAccording to the Times, \"a substantial amount of his time\" goes towards skeet shooting, in which participants shoot clay targets that move through the air. He represents the national team at competitions, according to his website.\n\n\"Outside of his business and philanthropic work, the Duke represents Team GB at Olympic Skeet Shooting competitions overseas and in the UK and continues to pursue his ambitions as an elite sportsman,\" the Grosvenor website says.\n\nHe competes under the name Hugh Westminster, according to his ISSF Sports profile, and competed internationally in Doha and Cairo earlier this year. In April, he placed third at an event at the National Clay Shooting Centre, British Shooting shared on Instagram, with a photo of him on the podium.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead next\n\nRoyals Billionaires\n\nAdvertisement"
