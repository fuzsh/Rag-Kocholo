        "text": "Tom Grosvenor was a local lad who started his professional football career in 1928 playing for Birmingham City. In 1933, Tom got his biggest break when he was selected for England, making three appearances and scoring twice. He was sold on to Sheffield Wednesday in 1936 for a record amount of £2,500 in 1936. He finished his professional career playing for Bolton Wanderers which he joined in 1937.\n\nOur July auction which takes place on 22nd and 23rd July, includes a collection of memorabilia relating to this local footballing hero. The lot comprises a Football Association International debut medal awarded to Tom Grosvenor, of Birmingham City, for the England versus Ireland match at Deepdale in Preston on October 4, 1933. During this period players making their debut for England were given an option by the Football Association of receiving a gold commemorative medal instead of their normal match fee. Also included are his three England caps and Tom’s Number 8 England football shirt as well as black and white photgraphs of Tom and his team mates.\n\nThis is a very important part of local footballing history and Fieldings are delighted that it is to be sold close to Where Tom was born in Netherton.\n\nTo read our story in the press CLICK HERE"
