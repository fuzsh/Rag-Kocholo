        "text": "Signing out\n\nSo, what are your thoughts on the draw? Are you happy, or did you expect better?\n\nThat's the end of our coverage here, but you can continue the conversation in our comments section.\n\nNot too much longer\n\nITV has advertised that the draw will take place after the current ad break.\n\nA reminder that City are ball number 13.\n\nA look back in time at City's fourth round opponents\n\nTime to have a quick look back in time as we wait for the FA Cup draw, there is around an hour to go until it gets underway. City have a good record of making it through to the fourth round of the competition, here's a look at how the draw has treated them.\n\nLeicester's last five fourth round opponents\n\nWalsall (A) 2022/23\n\nNottingham Forest (A) 2021/22\n\nBrentford (A) 2020/21\n\nBrentford (A) 2019/20\n\nPeterborough (A) 2017/18\n\nLatest FA Cup odds\n\nMan City are currently favourites to retain the FA Cup according to bookmakers' Grosvenor Sport.\n\nHere's a look at the latest odds.\n\nMan City: 11/4\n\nLiverpool: 5/1\n\nChelsea, Tottenham: 8/1\n\nNewcastle United: 10/1\n\nManchester United: 12/1\n\nAston Villa, Brighton: 16/1\n\nFulham: 33/1\n\nBournemouth, West Ham: 40/1\n\nWolves: 50/1\n\nBrentford, Crystal Palace, Everton, Leeds, Leicester, Nottingham Forest: 66/1\n\nSheffield United: 80/1\n\nIpswich, Southampton, West Brom: 100/1\n\nLuton: 125/1\n\nBlackburn, Coventry, Norwich, Watford: 150/1\n\nBirmingham, Sheffield Wednesday, Swansea: 200/1\n\nBolton, Charlton, Hull, Plymouth: 250/1\n\nWrexham: 400/1\n\nBlackpool, Bristol Rovers: 500/1\n\nBristol City, Wigan: 1000/1\n\nAway from the draw - Mavididi and Daka nominated for POTM\n\nSome news away from the FA Cup draw as it has been announced that both Stephy Mavididi and Patson Daka have been nominated for the December Championship Player of the month.\n\nIt was an impressive month for both players, with Mavidid scoring five times, and Daka making an impact upon his return to the team by scoring four goals in three games.\n\nVoting for the award is now open with fans able to cast their votes right here.\n\nThe draw that Enzo Maresca wants\n\nEnoz Maresca is hoping for a home draw this time around.\n\n“The only thing I can say is that I would like to play at home. We’ve played four cup games this year, three in the Carabao and one today, and all of them were away. So we would like to play at home. Against who, we’ll see.”\n\nWhen it was suggested he could meet former team Man City in the fourth round, he responded with: “Oof. We’ll see. Any game is good to continue in this competition.”\n\nEverything you need to know about the draw\n\nLeicester City are in the hat for the fourth round draw of the FA Cup, after overcoming Millwall in the third round on Saturday.\n\nEnzo Maresca made several changes to his team for the trip to the Den as City came out as 3-2 winners over the Lions. Cesare Casadei, Ricardo Pereira, and Tom Cannon got the goals that sealed their place in the next round of the tournament.\n\nWhen asked who he would like to play in the fourth round, Maresca outlined his desire for a home tie. Every one of City’s cup ties under the Italian so far have been away from home.\n\nHere is everything you need to know\n\nWhat is the ideal draw for City?\n\nPart of the excitement of the FA Cup draw is picking out games teams that you want your team to be drawn against, and teams that won't cause so much excitement.\n\nThere's been a debate among City fans this afternoon over what the team should be looking for in an ideal draw. There has been some suggestion that a mid-table Premier League team would give City an idea of where they are in their development under Enzo Maresca, while other want an easier passage into the fifth round.\n\nFor Enzo Maresca, a home tie would be ideal, with the Italian yet to manage a cup game for City at the King Power Stadium. But some fans may prefer a trip to a new stadium to tick it off their list.\n\nSo what is the ideal draw for City tonight? Tell us in the comments section"
