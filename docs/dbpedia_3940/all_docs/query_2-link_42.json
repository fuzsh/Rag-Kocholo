Both Bangor and Annagh, who have played each of the last two play-off series against first Portadown and then Dungannon Swifts, were left with disappointing ends to highly creditable seasons â indeed, the Yellows finished on 68 points and third-place in their first season since their promotion from the PIL.\n\nThere were chances throughout for Ben Arthurs, Ben Cushnie, Lewis Francis and a last-gasp curler from Conor McDermott that inched past the post, while some last-ditch defending in the Seasidersâ rearguard was also needed and an inspired performance from former Bangor goalkeeper Jason Craughwell in the Annagh goal is also worthy of credit, with the Seasidersâ main focus after a well-earned break being to prepare for a second season of Championship football and hope to be fighting near the summit once more.\n\nGARY'S MATCH GALLERY\n\nBANGOR TEAM:\n\nM.Orbinson, H.Beverland(J.Hughes), R.Neale, L.Francis, B.Walker(C.McDermott), B.Cushnie, T.Mulvenna, S.McArthur(A.Neale), B.Arthurs, T.Mathieson(M.Halliday).\n\nSubs: McConkey, S.Foster, D.Hume\n\n(Posted: Friday, 26th April 2024)\n\nANNAGH UNITED v BANGOR\n\nFriday, April 26 â Annagh United vs Bangor, Playr-Fit Championship, BMG Arena, 7:45pm\n\nBangor pull the curtain down on their Playr-Fit Championship season tonight when they travel to the BMG Arena for a winner-takes-all showdown against Annagh United.\n\nThereâs a lot riding on this clash, with the winner (if there is one) going on to face Ballymena United in the Premiership Promotion/Relegation Play-Off, while a draw on the Tandragee Road would also suit the Seasiders owing to their vastly superior goal difference should Institute fail to beat newly crowned champions Portadown at nearby Shamrock Park.\n\nIt promises to be a night of tension for both sides but, on the back of consecutive victories over Harland and Wolff Welders (3-0) and Dundela (3-1) as well as last weekendâs 1-1 draw with Institute at the Ryan McBride Brandywell, Bangor will enter this tricky clash with Ciaran McGurganâs men in confident mood and believing that they can book a double date with the Sky Blues in the first season back in senior football. With Ben Cushnie cancelling out Oisin Devlinâs opener in the north west last time out for his second goal in as many games, the Yellows will want to return to winning ways against an opponent they have registered three wins out of three against to date.\n\nLee Feeney will also be very wary, though â Annagh have won four times on the bounce in the split, all of them away from home, and ever since Lewis Francisâ double proved enough to defeat them 2-1 back on December 30, the Co Armagh side have lost just once since and thrust themselves into a position where a third consecutive play-off is within their grasp. No chances can be taken on what is a huge night for the club.\n\n(Posted: Friday, 26th April 2024)\n\nBANGOR LADIES 9-0 FOYLE BELLES\n\nBangor made it back-to-back victories to begin the 2024 NIWFA Championship season when they emerged 9-0 winners over Foyle Belles at Clandeboye Park on Wednesday night, added to the previous weekâs 6-1 success away to St Oliver Plunkett Ladies in what has proved to be an impressive start in charge for manager Chris Dougan.\n\nThe Seasiders opened the scoring on 11 minutes through a delicate Amber Dempster chip as she was sent behind the line, with teenager Emi Wynne bagging a superb brace that made it three by the 24th minute, picking out the bottom left corner on both occasions with a couple of well-taken finishes.\n\nOn 29 minutes, Janine Jess netted her second goal in as many games when she thundered a low effort into the net through a crowd, establishing a four-goal lead at the break. Dempster powered in a second goal for herself into the bottom left 18 minutes into the second period, twisting and turning before finding the bottom corner in stylish fashion, while Jodie Shannon added a sixth 20 yards out from goal seven minutes later.\n\nWhat followed was a late salvo in added-time, as new signing Ashleigh Scott-Brown scored a couple of goals off the bench in the second and sixth minutes of stoppage, sandwiching Leah Robinsonâs close-range effort for her first goal of the season in the fourth minute of added-time that secured the three points for Bangor.\n\n(Posted: Thursday, 25th April 2024)\n\nBANGOR LADIES v FOYLE BELLES\n\nWednesday, April 24 â Bangor FC Ladies vs Foyle Belles, NIWFA Championship, Clandeboye Park, 7:30pm\n\nBangor FC Ladies boss Chris Dougan insists the commanding opening victory over St Oliver Plunkett should be the springboard for further success ahead of Wednesday nightâs home clash with Foyle Belles.\n\nThe Ladiesâ first competitive fixture at Clandeboye Park in 2024 pits them against the pink-shirted north west outfit, with Dougan believing this second NIWFA Championship outing presents another chance to make a statement of intent. He says the approach is simply to âpress resetâ and go for glory once again, adding that he will strive for improvement even with last weekâs 6-1 win at Crumlin Leisure Centre in mind.\n\nâPress reset. Weâve had our first big one out of the way, potential banana skin out of the way, a newly promoted team.\n\nâSo, we go on Sunday, we train again, we press the reset button and we do what we do, practise what weâve trained at.\n\nâWeâll look at and analyse that game, thereâs always things that we want to improve and weâll go and work on those and, hopefullyâ¦\n\nâFoyleâs got a big travel, and they wonât want to play us after how we did last year, so if we can go and put another statement out to the league that Bangorâs here to be a serious contender, thatâs whatâs going to motivate us every day.\n\nâWeâve got some great new staff working with us as well, these guys are superb, couldnât ask any more.â\n\nChris Dougan\n\n(Posted: Tuesday, 23rd April 2024)\n\nBEN CUSHNIE REFLECTS ON INSTITUTE DRAW\n\nBangorâs goal hero at Institute Ben Cushnie admits he is satisfied with a point from the visit to a sunny Ryan McBride Brandywell on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe 22-year-old forward delivered a leveller for the Seasiders five minutes out from the end of the first half in response to Oisin Devlinâs deadlock-breaker for âStute, and after the half-time pause, Cushnie felt the visitors would have been worth a victory as centre-back Lewis Francis narrowly missed the mark from a last-gasp free-kick initially soared in by Ben Walker. But a point keeps the Seasidersâ fate entirely within their own grasp; they are second-place in the Playr-Fit Championship still and know that victory at Annagh United on Friday night â irrespective of results elsewhere â will book a two-legged slot against Ballymena United in the promotion/relegation play-off.\n\nGlentoran loanee Cushnie, who hit his sixth goal of a somewhat injury-disrupted season by connecting to Francisâ flick-on 40 minutes into proceedings, insists that after a rocky start, a draw was the least Bangor deserved on their trip to the north west against the only opponent that has went unbeaten in their clashes with the Seasiders across this term.\n\nâI think we probably did (deserve a bit more from the game); the second half, I thought we dominated a lot of the play.\n\nâThe first 15 minutes, we struggled to settle into the game a bit. Obviously, we were coming into a tough place, big pitch, good sideâ¦ early on, they were playing the ball over the top of the defence quite a lot and it wasnât easy trying to stop that. We settled more after the (Institute goal), we began to play our own game a bit more and we got the equaliser.\n\nâIt doesnât matter who gets the goals, just that you do get them, but for me, itâs two in two, I was in the right place for it and I feel Iâve been getting sharper in front of goal every week.\n\nâSecond half, we started it and continued in the same way that weâd ended the first, we kept control of the game, we had good possession and we managed the game well, made sure we didnât give too much away and the defence wasnât under too much pressure.\n\nâObviously, Lewis has the chance at the end, the free-kick fell nicely for him and he had the chance, but it wasnât to be. The goals heâs scored this season, all the goals he scored coming up from the back, youâd probably have bet your house on him scoring there, but I think the ball was just a bit too far ahead of him in the end.\n\nâBut, obviously, going into the game, it was must-not-lose, so I think a draw was probably a fair enough result as well. We came in knowing âStute have had a good record against us this season and theyâve been tough enough games, I think they also have a good home record this season as well, so weâll take a point that keeps things in our hands and try to do the job against Annagh next week.â\n\nBen Cushnie\n\nHaving played 86 minutes of the 3-1 victory against Dundela at Wilgar Park the previous weekend, his neat free-kick kickstarting the comeback in east Belfast with Francis and Ben Arthurs adding to the goal haul, Cushnie got another 84 minutes in the book on Saturday.\n\nLee Feeney has been pleased to have the Hillsborough man at his disposal and fit and firing at a crucial point in the season, and with more than 60 appearances for the Glens under his belt, Cushnieâs pedigree at the top level has the tools to prove difference-making come this pulsating climax.\n\nThe striker adds that the strength of character in the dressing room furthers his belief that even if Bangor find parts of the going tough at the BMG Arena against Annagh, the panel is still able to weather any storms they face.\n\nâFeeno had said in one of his previous interviews, I was building my way up to match fitness again, and I can feel that myself every week.\n\nâIâve had two games in a row now where Iâve played close to the full 90 minutes, probably as close as Iâve got throughout the season, so Iâm feeling sharp and Iâve got a few goals and got a bit of momentum.\n\nâWe went 1-0 down away against the Duns at half-time, came back, won; weâve went 1-0 down here, good side, big pitch, came back and got a draw that means itâs in our hands (play-off) going into the final day.\n\nâI think that shows the character of the team and the mentalities that we have, we have the people in the squad that can go out and get results, and everyone has that responsibility in the team across all areas of the pitch.\n\nâFor me personally, Iâm a player that can contribute more than goals and can do other stuff in the game as well, work hard for the team, and we all work for each other to get results.â\n\nBen Cushnie\n\n(Posted: Monday, 22nd April 2024)\n\nNIFL AWARDS\n\nCongratulations to James Taylor, Reece Neale, Lewis Francis and Scott McArthur who picked up their awards last night for being selected in the NI Football League Championship Team of the Season.\n\nWell done!\n\n(Posted: Sunday, 21st April 2024)\n\nBANGOR RESERVES 8-0 PSNI OLYMPIC\n\nBangor Reserves closed out their home slate of matches in Championship/PIL Development League in some style, with eight different goal-getters putting their name on the scoresheet during Saturday morningâs 8-0 rout of PSNI Olympic at Clandeboye Park.\n\nThe Seasiders, who had earlier in the season despatched the Police side 10-0 at Breda Park, ran goal crazy in this encounter and maintained a clean sheet for their biggest home success of the season. Strikes from Callum Johnston, Jude Healy, Jack McCosh, Charley Craig, Caden McKee, Jay Boyd, Ruairi Wright and Mitchel Watterson sealed the deal for David Downesâ side in the end and ensures that, ahead of their final outing of the season at the Brandywell against Institute U21 on May 10, they kept their grip on second-place in the division.\n\nAdding to the hard-fought success in midweek against Lisburn Distillery U21 when defender McCoshâs late strike kept the Yellows on the winning trail (3-2) despite being reduced to 10 men in the first half, Bangor look well-poised to end the season on a high and will go into that clash with âStute buoyed by their return to form.\n\nIt also means they maintain a mathematical chance at title glory, too, although three defeats for league leaders H&W Welders U21 would be required for that to be so. In any case, their run of four three-pointers in a row after a rocky March inspires belief among the coaching staff and players that the best is still to come.\n\n(Posted: Sunday, 21st April 2024)\n\nINSTITUTE 1-1 BANGOR\n\nBangorâs promotion play-off destiny will both go right down to the final day and be entirely in their own hands following Saturday afternoonâs 1-1 draw with Institute at a sunny Ryan McBride Brandywell.\n\nThe Seasiders found themselves on the back foot just 15 minutes in when Oisin Devlin â the prodigious 17-year-old midfield talent who signed on a three-and-a-half-year deal with Larne in the January window â slid beyond James Taylor to break the deadlock for âStute, but a fighting response from Lee Feeneyâs men against the only team they had yet to defeat in this Playr-Fit Championship season yielded a point reward.\n\nBen Cushnieâs return to fitness has come as a big boost, and the Glentoran loanee struck a second goal in as many weeks five minutes before the end of the first period. A looping ball found Lewis Francis, and the centre-back hooked into the strikerâs path to strike a decisive equaliser that ultimately was to remain until the end.\n\nThe popular Francis almost won it late on from a deflected Ben Walker free-kick but missed the mark at the death, and with the stalemate also confirming Portadownâs status as league champions in line with their 1-1 draw at home to Dundela, it means Bangorâs full focus is authentically on second-place. However, just a point separates the Seasiders, Dundela, Annagh (all 67) and Institute (66) ahead of what promises to be a nerve-jangling Friday night for the right to face Ballymena United in the two-legged shoot-out. The drama has only just begun.\n\nGARY'S MATCH GALLERY\n\nBANGOR TEAM:\n\nJ.Taylor, R.Neale, H.Beverland, L.Francis, B.Walker, L.Harrison(M.Bradley), T.Mulvenna, B.Cushnie(A.Neale), S.McArthur(J.Hughes), B.Arthurs, T.Mathieson.\n\nSubs: McConkey, M.Halliday, D.Hume, G.Beattie\n\nNEXT MATCH:\n\nFriday, 26th April, ANNAGH UNITED v BANGOR, Championship, BMG ARENA, 7:45pm\n\n(Posted: Saturday, 20th April 2024)\n\nDOUGAN'S DELIGHT\n\nBangor FC Ladies boss Chris Dougan toasted his first competitive victory as manager as one built on solid foundations, trust, familiarity and the freedom to play.\n\nHaving succeeded Ethan Boylan in the top job at the start of 2024, Dougan, stepping up from his assistant role, bagged an opening-day victory with a 6-1 success over St Oliver Plunkett in the NIWFA Championship on Wednesday night.\n\nAfter Clodagh Mervynâs opener for the west Belfast-based home team just 56 seconds into proceedings at Crumlin Leisure Centre, the Seasiders largely dominated the play thereafter, with Amber Dempsterâs first-half hat-trick added to by strikes from teenagers Evarose Martin and Janine Jess as well as winger Toni Stewart that ultimately wrapped up a convincing win.\n\nThe NIWFA Division One champions had caused problems for Bangor in the not-too-distant past, but a display of heart, work-rate and energy â not to mention a number of exceptional sequences of football â meant the Yellows asserted their authority delighted Dougan, who also hailed how the new arrivals bedded into the fold.\n\nâThese guys have shown that they have the freedom now to go and play. They have the intensity to be competitive the whole way through the game, weâve got the depth on the bench that they can come on and maintain (energy levels), or even change the game themselves.\n\nâWeâre very, very lucky with the girls that we do have, they followed the instructions and they know what to do. So, they worked their legs off in pre-season, theyâve kept the intensity through the roof and as you can see by the performance today, they trust each other.\n\nâWhen you get that trust, they will go and play some beautiful football. They have that continuity, giving you a complete foundation about how you build a team this year. So, all the new girls coming in are five steps ahead because theyâve had everything built on by watching other players and understanding youâve got perfect examples in front of you at all times.\n\nâWhen they (existing players) come off, they (new players) can replicate that sort of way because they know what to do, theyâve seen it, we do it in training and the girls have all bought in and enjoying everything we do.\n\nâWhen theyâre playing happyâ¦ yeah, we conceded in one minute, from nerves, but after that, it was never a doubt. âI donât think they had more than two or three shots at goal, and the girls could have been a bit more ruthless and it couldâve been an even bigger scoreline â fair play to them.â\n\nChris Dougan\n\nFollowing a slender 3-2 victory for Bangor when they overcame Wednesdayâs opponents in last seasonâs PwC Super Cup quarter-final at Sally Gardens in Poleglass, this fixture had the makings of a potential banana skin that the Seasiders could slip on if they werenât careful. However, the professionalism of the performance and handling of the pressure of being a top-end team in the Championship both came in for huge praise from the manager.\n\nâMassive banana skin, opening game, new team promoted, theyâre going to be excited, theyâre going to be up for the game. Weâve finally got the pressure on us to start performing because we performed so well last year, and the girls havenât been stepping away from the pressure; theyâre embracing it.\n\nâTheyâre going, âWe like to be the team thatâs now being considered one of the top (teams), weâll take that mantle, weâll run with itâ. Asked on whether he reads much into the leagueâs expansion to 10 teams from seven last year, Dougan adds: âNo, not for me.\n\nâI think it adds a bit more excitement, youâve got a higher level of competition. But, the girls back themselves playing against competition from the top level, the girls are here to go and be competitive.\n\nâIâm not sure if we will win it, but weâll definitely be competitive and weâve got great young players coming through that, in the next couple of years, can do some real damage as well.\n\nâSo, Iâm more than happy with how theyâre doing, they deserve the bigger league and they deserve more matches.â\n\nChris Dougan\n\n(Posted: Saturday, 20th April 2024)\n\nBANGOR RESERVES v PSNI OLYMPIC\n\nSaturday, April 20 â Bangor Reserves vs PSNI Olympic, Championship/PIL Development League, Clandeboye Park, 11am\n\nItâs the second from last outing in the Championship/PIL Development League this Saturday for Bangor Reserves, who entertain PSNI Olympic at Clandeboye Park and will be determined to sign off their home slate of fixtures in 2023/24 with three points.\n\nDavid Downesâ men were forced to battle for the maximum spoils in midweek when they edged a five-goal encounter with Lisburn Distillery at Wallace Park, with Jay Boydâs header and Kristian Trainorâs composed penalty cancelled out by a pair of second-half finishes by the Whites that levelled the scores at 2-2 â Bangor had at this stage been reduced to 10 men, too, with centre-back Mackenzie Gray shown a straight red card during the first half.\n\nBut towering defender Jack McCosh notched up his third goal since arriving in January on 82 minutes and ultimately secured the victory, with their penultimate clash with PSNI allowing them to add a third straight triumph â four, if you count the win over Warrenpoint Town via forfeit â and maintain their grip on second-place, with Harland and Wolff Welders U21 still atop the table and two points ahead of the Yellows having played a couple of games fewer.\n\nCapitalising on any potential slip-up is the principal aim for Downes and his charges come the business end, with the second stringâs curtain-closing encounter not coming for another three weeks before they visit Institute at the Brandywell on May 10. Against the leagueâs third-from-bottom outfit, Bangor will back themselves against a side they overcame 10-0 early doors, but they will guard against complacency seeping in while there is still something to play for.\n\n(Posted: Friday, 19th April 2024)\n\nINSTITUTE v BANGOR\n\nSaturday, April 20 â Institute vs Bangor, Playr-Fit Championship, Ryan McBride Brandywell Stadium, 3pm\n\nBangor are in action for the penultimate time in the Playr-Fit Championship when they travel to the Ryan McBride Brandywell to face Institute â a crunch clash that could go a long way to deciding who competes in the promotion play-off versus, in all likelihood, Ballymena United.\n\nThe Seasiders enter Saturday afternoonâs encounter on the back of a stirring 3-1 comeback success away to Dundela last time out. After Jordan Jenkins handed the Duns the lead nine minutes in, a three-goal second half for Lee Feeneyâs men in which Ben Cushnie, Lewis Francis and Ben Arthurs marked the scoresheet inspired an important win that leaves this weekend very finely poised.\n\nThe players will also be motivated to atone for their previous visit to the north west venue, a 4-0 reversal last October when Kirk McLaughlinâs second-half hat-trick added to Shaun Leppardâs headed opener for âStute. Kevin Deeryâs men (65 points) trail their visitors on Saturday (66) by a point and know victory is all but essential to have their play-off fate in their own hands next Friday, with Annagh United (64) â a point further back and on the road to Blanchflower Park where they play Harland and Wolff Welders â also in the frame in what is a pulsating race thatâs guaranteed to go to the wire.\n\nThe playersâ focus is firmly on this weekend and a big travelling support is expected to flock to the Brandywell to will Feeney and his charges to victory; this promises to be a pivotal and deciding duel in what truly feels like the business end.\n\nLEE FEENEY - LOOKING FORWARD TO SATURDAY\n\nThereâs a certain word starting with âpâ on the lips of a lot of people around Bangor right now but manager Lee Feeney insists heâs not getting carried away ahead of Saturdayâs trip to the Brandywell to take on Institute.\n\nThe Seasiders supremo, who takes his side into the penultimate Playr-Fit Championship duel of the season on the back of impressive 3-0 and 3-1 successes over east Belfast duo Harland and Wolff Welders and Dundela, believes his players will be fired up to deliver against âStute, the only team in the division they have not got the better of.\n\nThe north west outfit won 1-0 a few weeks previously when Mikhail Kennedy headed home the only goal of the game just after the hour mark at Clandeboye Park, and Feeney â whose side lost 4-0 on their first trip back in October for what remains Bangorâs heaviest defeat in this campaign â says lessons have been learned and is in confident mood for this encounter.\n\nThe Kilkeel man also shed light on a conversation he had recently with John Boyle. The 38-year-old centre-back was a pivotal member of last termâs Steel and Sons Cup and Premier Intermediate League double-winning team, making 40 appearances and leading that squad for minutes played on 3,405, and the current Warrenpoint Town captain is a seasoned campaigner in the art of promotions through the NIFL pyramid â but after addressing that theme briefly, Feeney returned to present affairs.\n\nâI was actually speaking to Boyler there, John Boyle over Easter. Heâs been a bit of a specialist in promotions over the years, that was his sixth or seventh last year.\n\nâHeâs achieved promotion from the Championship four times, twice with Warrenpoint and twice with Newry, and he was telling me that while it was a nice feeling to win the division and make sure of it, the play-off just has a different feeling to it, and winning a play-off, itâs like winning a cup final.\n\nâThereâs a feeling with the play-off that it is a one-off, and anything can happen; any team can cause an upset on the day. But, that being said, we canât think too far ahead of ourselves, and we have to put all our focus into winning this weekend. We just have to take it one game at a time, and itâs always been the approach that weâve had, just to take each game as it comes.\n\nâThe last time we played Institute, I felt we were the better team in the game and we were unlucky to lose, and weâre motivated to put things right this time around.\n\nâWe went to Dundela knowing the last time we went there that we got beat, and we put in a really good performance to put things right there, and itâs the same going into this weekend.\n\nâThe last time we played Institute up there, it was a tough day for us and it was a lesson, but the players are motivated because we havenât beaten them yet this season and we felt hard done by when they beat us last time.\n\nâWeâre not going to dwell on that result; weâre coming into this game on the back of two convincing victories and we need to keep the momentum going into this weekend.â\n\nLee Feeney\n\n(Posted: Friday, 19th April 2024)\n\nLISBURN DISTILLERY U21 2-3 BANGOR RESERVES\n\nIt wasnât all plain sailing for Bangor Reserves in Lisburn on Wednesday evening, but they got the job done and secured a precious three points with a hard-fought 3-2 victory over Lisburn Distillery Reserves in Wallace Park.\n\nThe Seasiders were two to the good in a feisty enough first half that saw a number of meaty challenges, one which saw centre-back Mackenzie Gray given his marching orders following a high lunge around 10 minutes out from the interval. By that stage, the visitors were two to the good, with Jay Boyd heading home an early opener before Kristian Trainor slotted home a cool penalty after Jude Healy was upended in the penalty area by the Distillery goalkeeper when chasing a loose ball.\n\nOn a bobbly pitch, Distillery fought back and searched for a way back into the game, levelling with two goals in two minutes midway through the second period, but the full reward was headed back with David Downes and his troops when towering defender Jack McCosh delivered the winner eight minutes from time and moved the Seasiders to within two points of league leaders Harland and Wolff Welders â albeit having played a couple of games fewer.\n\nBangor contest their final home match of the season on Saturday when they entertain third-from-bottom PSNI at Clandeboye Park before a break of three weeks, making the long travel to the north west where they will face Institute at the Brandywell in a rearranged match-up.\n\n(Posted: Thursday, 18th April 2024)\n\nSt. OLIVER PLUNKETT LADIES 1-6 BANGOR LADIES\n\nChris Dougan got off to a winning start in his first competitive outing as Bangor FC Ladies manager with a comprehensive and ruthless 6-1 victory over St Oliver Plunkett Ladies at Crumlin Leisure Centre on Wednesday night, picking up all three points in their 2024 NIWFA Championship opener.\n\nBangor couldn't have had a worse start to the game in truth, conceding after just 56 seconds when Plunkett forward Clodagh Mervyn raced behind the defensive line before firing into the top left corner of the net out of reach of Giulia McLaughlin â but what followed was a storming Seasiders response.\n\nAmber Dempster, so ruthless in front of goal in 2023, picked up exactly where she left off in the new year with finishes in the 11th and 19th minutes to turn the tide back in Bangor's favour, while composed drives by Toni Stewart and Janine Jess â both around 10 yards from goal, the former from a well-worked sequence down the left and the latter with a fierce rebound after Dempster's initial shot from a corner was blocked â made it 4-1 before the half-hour.\n\nDempster then completed her hat-trick five minutes out from the interval from the penalty spot, and a second half that started on a less frenetic note than the first offered Dougan the chance to introduce three fresh faces to the fold to a starting XI that entirely comprised familiar faces from 2023's crusade. Substitute Evarose Martin, a summer arrival last term, then struck a sublime free-kick from 25 yards that nestled beautifully in the top left corner and rubber-stamped the scoring on a fine night.\n\nAMBER DEMPSTER'S THOUGHTS ON WEDNESDAY WIN\n\nThey say the best things some in threes, and that was certainly the case on opening night for Amber Dempster, who delivered a fine first-half hat-trick to help Bangor FC Ladies to victory in their 2024 NIWFA Championship opener on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Seasiders faced St Oliver Plunkett Ladies at Crumlin Leisure Centre for what looked like a potential banana skin, having only narrowly overcome the west Belfast outfit in last seasonâs PwC Super Cup quarter-final 3-2, and that reputation was living true inside the first minute when Plunkett forward Clodagh Mervyn stroked in a beauty to give the home side the lead.\n\nBut a fired-up Bangor responded fearlessly and hit the Lenadoon club for six, with Dempster hitting a treble either side of finishes from impressive midfielder Janine Jess and agile winger Toni Stewart before the half-hour mark.\n\nSubstitute left-back Evarose Martin delivered the cherry on top and the finish of the night to round off the goal count 10 minutes from time, the teenagerâs fabulous 25-yard free-kick picking out the top left corner in spectacular style, and 31-year-old Dempster hailed the grit and determination the Yellows showed to clinch victory in Chris Douganâs first competitive clash in charge as manager.\n\nâYeah, definitely, the girls battled hardâ¦ you know, we went behind pretty early on, and I think we were finding our feet, first game of the season.\n\nâYou know, Plunkett are always a difficult team to come away to, you know, obviously travelling an hour out to Crumlin, too. Kind of heavy legs, obviously, whenever you first get going but, yeah, obviously from when we conceded, we managed to pull one back, and from there, it was just a really professional performance from the girls.\n\nâWe managed to get good squad rotation on today, too, which was excellent, and everybody really worked hard. Weâve been playing some tough friendlies in pre-season, itâs really had us ready for this moment, you know, whenever we do go one or two behind.\n\nâThe team always shows really great resilience, and itâs something even last year that we really demonstrated a lot throughout the season. Definitely, the girls, you know, No.1 right through to 18 that were there today really gave their all, which was fantastic.\n\nâEven having the fans down to support us and having them behind us, too, always really helps as well.â\n\nAmber Dempster\n\nDempster, who, alongside ever-reliable Seasiders skipper Sarah Crooks, recently scored for Northern Ireland Futsal in a memorable 4-1 victory over Belgium in Newry, believes those more fresh-faced to the fold showed their quality, too.\n\nNamechecking respected ex-Larne and Crusaders midfielder Amanda Morton (35) and teen talent Emi Wynne, who both debuted off the bench against Plunkett, she feels the familiarity of a starting XI entirely comprised first-team mainstays from 2023 combined with new faces can help the Seasiders take their talents to new heights.\n\nâWeâve made some new additions this year, which has been fantastic, you know, with the likes of Emi and Amanda coming in. I think Emi, obviously, so young, being able to get on there and get her first senior minutes for Bangor was excellent, and she really held her own whenever she went out there too.\n\nâShe almost managed to grab herself a goal in the process so, yeah, definitely, nice to have a mix of new additions and experience in there. Weâve kept the majority of the squad together from last year, obviously thereâs a few have went travelling or went off to university but, apart from that, weâve kept the squad together, weâve continued to go from strength to strength, so weâre excited to see what the rest of the season brings.\n\nâI think it was great to be able to have that squad rotation today and be able to obviously use all our subs, get them on, get them game time, get them minutes. You know, it is fantastic for players last year who maybe didnât get the opportunity to get as many minutes to get them on the ball and get them that experience.\n\nâAnd Evaroseâs free-kick was an absolute worldie, definitely, sheâll be teaching me how to do them on the training ground, sheâll be fighting me for the next one I think!â\n\nAmber Dempster\n\n(Posted: Thursday, 18th April 2024)\n\nRESERVES & LADIES BACK IN ACTION ON WEDNESDAY\n\nWednesday, April 17 â Lisburn Distillery U21 vs Bangor Reserves, Championship/PIL Development League, Wallace Park, 6:30pm\n\nBangor Reserves are on the road on Wednesday night and are aiming to close the season on a high when they travel to face Lisburn Distillery U21 at Wallace Park, their third-from-last outing in the Championship/PIL Development League.\n\nFollowing a 3-0 success over Knockbreda Reserves that put them back on the winning trail â they were awarded a 3-0 win over Warrenpoint Town, who were unable to field a team, but lost the four preceding matches in March that means the sideâs most likely aim is consolidating second-place â David Downes will want his men to keep their composure up against a Whites outfit sitting second from bottom in the table but who have reserves at their disposal to cause other teams problems.\n\nThe Seasiders were victorious during the clash of the teams at Clandeboye Park in February, but the 4-1 scoreline wasnât one that told the whole story given both left chances begging to add even more goals to what was an end-to-end affair. Mitchel Watterson, Charley Craig, Callum Johnston and Jay Boyd hit the target that Saturday morning, and Downes will hope his forward options can produce the goods again and potentially capitalise on any slip-ups from league leaders Harland and Wolff Welders at the summit; Dundela Reserves, in third, are also six points behind with three in hand.\n\nPutting points on the board by hook or by crook is the objective in the run-in, which is then followed with a home clash against PSNI Olympic on Saturday before a curtain-closer at the Brandywell for a rearranged trip to Institute on May 10.\n\nWednesday, April 17 â St Oliver Plunkett Ladies vs Bangor FC Ladies, NIWFA Championship, Crumlin Leisure Centre, 8pm\n\nBangor FC Ladies kickstart their 2024 campaign with a trip to Crumlin Leisure Centre for the NIWFA Championship opener, where newly promoted St Oliver Plunkett Ladies will be keen to throw an early spanner in the works.\n\nIn what is also new first-team boss Chris Douganâs first competitive outing as manager since stepping up from his assistant role to succeed club hero Ethan Boylan in the new year, heâll aim to set the side up for success and build on a highly promising 2023 crusade that saw the Ladies finish third-place in the Championship and reach the Final of the PwC Super Cup â the first showpiece the team has competed in since being brought back into the fold in 2019.\n\nMuch of last seasonâs squad has been retained and they have experience of facing the west Belfast side, given it was in that very knock-out competition where the Seasiders won 3-2 in a nip-and-tuck quarter-final encounter at Sally Gardens in Poleglass. Twice Boylanâs outfit were behind on that early July day, but goals from Erin Hennity, Amber Dempster and Robyn McFadden were enough to edge a five-goal thriller against the would-be Division One champions, who are a west Belfast outfit generally renowned for their youth production.\n\nItâs a tough test to kick things off for the squad, but with the vast majority of last campaignâs playing personnel retained, there is an element of continuity that is poised to stand them in the right stead and begin 2024âs events on the front foot. With Sion Swifts and Ballymena United both dropping down from the Premiership, it promises to be tough but exciting for the Yellows throughout, beginning in Crumlin.\n\n(Posted: Tuesday, 16th April 2024)\n\nLEE FEENEY ON THE TWO BENS\n\nThe two Bens in the Bangor line-up produced the goods on Saturday and delighted manager Lee Feeney with their contributions in the victory over Dundela.\n\nIt was Cushnie who hit the target first, slotting a low free-kick 25 yards from goal past Lewis Hunter and into the bottom right corner to equalise at Wilgar Park after his fellow Glentoran loanee Jordan Jenkins had opened the scoring for the hosts early doors, before his namesake Arthurs rounded off the scoring when he found the net for the 25th time this campaign after capitalising on a loose touch in defence to round the Duns stopper and finish easily for 3-1.\n\nBoth players have repeatedly come in for praise from the Clandeboye chief throughout this campaign and, beginning with versatile forward Cushnie (22) â who struck his fifth of the season having navigated injury turbulence at points â Feeney saluted the Hillsborough aceâs all-round play and called him âunplayableâ at times in east Belfast.\n\nâBen is a great ladâ¦ great lad, and a fantastic player. I think you can see heâs not quite at full match fitness, heâs not at a level to play 90 minutes just yet, but weâre building up to that point and heâs getting closer to that level.\n\nâHe was unlucky a few times before he got his goal, he was finding space on the pitch and was working hard, but then he got his goal which I felt his play deserved.\n\nâThere was a period in the second half where I thought he was just unplayable, the way that he was moving around the pitch, how he was working for himself and others and getting into positions where he could cause problems.\n\nâYes, heâs had his problems with injury, itâs been a tricky season for him, but I have no doubt over what he gives to the team, and I believe thereâs still much more to come from him.â\n\nLee Feeney\n\nOn Arthurs, the masterful 25-year-old from Kircubbin is a player that Feeney has routinely challenged to be even better, and the striker â who has 131 goals in total in the yellow and blue shirt â delivered on the job following his managerâs rally cry at half-time on Saturday.\n\nDealing with experienced centre-halves Jay Magee and Jaimie McGovern in the Dundela defence, âBig Benâ was tasked with creating important spaces for his team-mates to roam into and pounce on any chances that fell his way, deservedly marking the scoresheet with one of the final meaningful actions of the contest.\n\nHaving hit a quarter-century of goals across all competitions in the Ballymena and Provincial League and McReynolds Cup double-winning season in 2018/19, when he scored 38, as well as 31 in last campaignâs Premier Intermediate League and Steel and Sons Cup crusade, Feeney also hailed the predatory marksman â who is also Bangorâs top assister this term with 13 â for repeating the feat in the Championship, an âoutstandingâ achievement.\n\nâI actually had a wee go at Ben at half-timeâ¦ I asked him to do more in terms of keeping the centre-backs occupied and, fair play to him, in the second half, I thought he was outstanding.\n\nâHe was up against big Jay Magee, who I actually thought played a really excellent game with Ben, but Ben was physical and he kept him occupied, and Jaimie McGovern in there as well.\n\nâHe was doing a lot of the dirty work that was allowing Cush and Scott McArthur, and even Jordan Hughes when he came on, to find the spaces that they did, and playing as the lone striker, thatâs what you have to do in games.\n\nâYouâve got to go above and beyond in that sense, to create room for others, and I thought up against two tough centre-backs, he was doing that and caused Dundela a lot of problems and gave us a lot of joy, a lot of territory in the final third.\n\nâHe got his goal late in the second half that I thought he took superbly, how he controlled it and then the finish, and that was a reward for the work heâd been doing for others earlier.\n\nâHeâs scored 25 goals in a season across three different leaguesâ¦ I think thatâs outstanding.\n\nâThatâs just a measure of his commitment, the part heâs played in this team being where it is now and being in a position to challenge at the top end of this league. Heâs someone I know I can look to and will demand more of himself, and I believe heâs got levels to climb as well.â\n\nLee Feeney\n\n(Posted: Tuesday, 16th April 2024)\n\nLEE FEENEY'S REACTION TO THE WIN AT WILGAR\n\nBangor manager Lee Feeney admits the main source of satisfaction from Saturdayâs priceless 3-1 win at Dundela was righting the wrongs of their previous less jubilant visit to Wilgar Park.\n\nThe Seasiders were on the wrong end of a Jordan Jenkins hat-trick and a 3-2 reversal at the hands of the Duns on Tuesday, February 13 â a scoreline that, in truth, was flattering for the visitors that night â but the supporters felt the love much more on post-split Saturday after this fighting comeback success.\n\nJenkins required just nine minutes to shoot Stephen Gourleyâs charges into the lead, but that proved as good as it got for the east Belfast side as a second-half fightback inspired by a Ben Cushnie free-kick special, a powerful Lewis Francis header and a Ben Arthurs classic roared Bangor to all three points this time around.\n\nFeeney took responsibility for that defeat and pledged to carry on board the lessons learned as a direct brand of football failed to yield the desired reward, with the Yellows returning to deploy a fresh style that made a difference this time.\n\nâIt was a big win for us, and I was really pleased with the way we went about ourselves in the end. I took responsibility, and I told the players that, I took responsibility for when we got beat in February and that we would come back here having learned lessons.\n\nâI learned a lot as a manager that night, and that has been the way itâs been at times, either you win or you learn, and you keep learning. We played direct and long from that back that night, but I set us up for this game to play the ball on the ground more and every player worked hard to execute the game plan the way they did and play some of the football we did.\n\nâItâs a tough game here, but I was feeling confident on the back of that experience and the win last week that the players would have taken lessons on board coming back here, and I felt we produced a really good performance.\n\nâTactically, I think we got it spot on, and I felt the players executed the game plan superbly. I felt defensively, with young Jenkins, I know he scored, but I felt we did a good job and marshalled him well, we kept track of his movements and we knew heâd be a threat.\n\nâI felt we were a wee bit were unlucky to be behind, we had a few moments in the first half where we were unlucky, but in the second half, I felt we were outstanding.\n\nâWe controlled the play, we got our foot on the ball, we were creating chances and getting into dangerous areas, we had dangerous territory in the final third and we capitalised in the end for a really important win.â\n\nLee Feeney\n\nReflecting on the turbulent sequence of results that preceded Saturday and the previous weekendâs dominant 3-0 home triumph over Dundelaâs local rivals H&W Welders, Feeney reiterated his confidence in his squad and insists he knew they would turn the tables.\n\nA trio of defeats to Portadown (twice) and Institute could have stunted Bangorâs momentum but that is not in the nature of this squad, who hit back with a vengeance in successive duels to set themselves up perfectly for facing Institute and Annagh United in their final couple.\n\nPraising the standard of football on Wilgar Parkâs oft-discussed compact playing surface, the Clandeboye chief says setbacks are par for the course and is pleased his squad have hit the high notes once again.\n\nâAt this stage of the season, it is about getting the three points, and we have been unlucky recently, but the performances have been really, really good. We have been playing really, really, really well. Apart from, you know, the Portadown game (3-0 defeat at Clandeboye Park on Easter Tuesday), we were playing really well and just not getting the results, not getting the rub of the green.\n\nâBut we have great characters at this club, the characterâs always been there ever since I first came in, and Iâve said to the players that itâs just football, and football throws up these types of setbacks that youâve got to try and put right.\n\nâNow, weâve got two victories, two convincing victories in my opinion, and itâs now a wee bit of momentum for us to push on and go into Institute. People say you canât play football at Dundela, they make it tough, the pitch is too small, itâs compact, some of the football we played on Saturday was outstanding.\n\nâIâm proud of every player for that; every player had a part to play in that, getting from back to front to create chances and create spaces and find spaces on the pitch, and I thought the subs came on and came into that really well as well.\n\nâNo one at this club doubts the character of the boys, I never have any doubt and you can see why.â\n\nLee Feeney\n\n(Posted: Monday, 15th April 2024)\n\nDUNDELA 1-3 BANGOR\n\nA storming second-half performance at Wilgar Park on Saturday showed that Bangorâs intent to end the season strong and vie for a promotion place is burning bright as ever, as the away side came from behind to take all three points against Dundela. Trailing at the interval after Jordan Jenkins blasted the Duns into the lead with less than 10 minutes on the clock in east Belfast, the Seasiders clicked into gear at a venue they lost 3-2 at in the middle of February and converted three unanswered finishes during the second period to wrap up a priceless victory.\n\nJenkinsâ fellow Glentoran loanee Ben Cushnie laid the foundations for the fightback when he slotted in a brilliant low free-kick past home shot-stopper Lewis Hunter on 53 minutes â and after notching up his fifth goal of an injury-disrupted season, defender Lewis Francis racked up his 10th and shot Bangor into the lead for the first time having headed home new CBSC Player of the Month Tiarnan Mulvennaâs corner.\n\nThe cherry on top that propped up the Yellows to 66 points and second-place in the Playr-Fit Championship table was applied by Ben Arthurs, who raced behind the Dundela defence and beat Hunter for the third goal of the afternoon and his 25th of the campaign.\n\nWhile the title is all in Portadownâs hands â they are four points clear at the top and know victory over the Duns at Shamrock Park next Saturday will win them the league any which way â the same can now be said of Bangorâs chances of the promotion play-off, with visits to fourth-placed Institute (April 20) and fifth-positioned Annagh United (April 26) to come in the last two scheduled outings.\n\nGARY'S MATCH GALLERY\n\nBANGOR TEAM:\n\nJ.Taylor, R.Neale, H.Beverland, L.Francis, S.Foster(G.Beattie), L.Harrison(J.Hughes), T.Mulvenna, B.Cushnie(A,Neale), S.McArthur(M.Bradley), B.Arthurs, T.Mathieson.\n\nSubs: M.Orbinson, D.Hume, M.Halliday\n\nNEXT MATCH:\n\nSATURDAY, 20th April 2024 -

This match is high-stakes and should have the bumper crowd to reflect the occasion.\n\n(Posted: Thursday, 11th April 2024)\n\nSPOTLIGHT ON HOWARD BEVERLAND\n\nExperienced defender Howard Beverland has offered an interesting insight into how he has settled in since joining Bangor in January and his expectations of himself and the impact he could have on the team.\n\nThe 34-year-old centre-back, who was an Irish Cup and County Antrim Shield winner as well as Irish League champion with Crusaders, has seen all that there is to see in a distinguished career in the domestic game that also includes two stints with Coleraine and spells playing for Portadown and Ballyclare Comrades.\n\nBeverland linked up at Clandeboye Park from the latter and admits he demanded of himself that he get down to business as quickly as possible, with the culture and atmosphere at Lee Feeneyâs outfit helping him settle speedily and cement a spot in the starting side early doors.\n\nYou can sense the Ballymoney nativeâs winning mentality when he speaks and his desire to help bring success to the seaside, and having recently returned to fitness from a hamstring injury, the prospect of challenging for promotion and competing in big games in the split is right up his alley as the squad aims to make one big final push.\n\nâI came in here and I kind of expect myself at this stage of my career to come in and hit the ground running because Iâm an experienced player.I wouldnât personally have felt Iâd need two or three weeks to kind of get going.\n\nâI was keen to get going and sort of hit the ground, and thatâs what Iâve done, to be fair. Thatâs been helped by the culture, the atmosphere throughout the club and the togetherness, to be honest; itâs a really enjoyable club to sign for and to step into.\n\nâMost importantly, we have something to play for at this stage of the season because thatâs what itâs all about, you know, at this stage, you want to be in the top half, you want to be going into those big games where you put yourself out of your comfort zone.\n\nâYou want to have the confidence to play in the big games, thatâs something Iâve been used to a lot in my career as well, and hopefully, itâs something I can bring when it comes to those games here as well.\n\nâObviously, Iâd a wee injury there for the last five or so weeks, probably just disrupted my momentum because I was in a really good place performance-wise within the team. The Ballyclare game (a 4-0 win at Clandeboye Park on February 23), my hamstring tears and then youâre working hard to get back again because you know itâs a crucial time.\n\nâI worked hard, seen the physios and did my rehab and worked hard at that to get back in again to help the team.\n\nâWeâre in a really privileged place here to have a go and see where it takes us as well.â\n\nHoward Beverland\n\n(Posted: Tuesday, 9th April 2024)\n\nPLAYER REACTION - HOWARD BEVERLAND\n\nHoward Beverland is feeling the love at Bangor and insists repaying the supportersâ faith by doing the hard work on the pitch is key to the clubâs success in the present and future.\n\nThe centre-back turned in a commanding performance during the Seasidersâ 3-0 victory over Harland and Wolff Welders, with a dominant collective display warmly received by a rousing round of applause as the players and management walked off for the final scheduled home match at Clandeboye Park this season.\n\nIrish League veteran Beverland, who linked up from fellow Playr-Fit Championship outfit Ballyclare Comrades in the January transfer window, took in the acclaim and was satisfied after helping the team bounce back from the 3-0 defeat to another of his former sides, Portadown, on Easter Tuesday.\n\nA crowd well into the four-figure mark witnessed that reversal, leaving Lee Feeney and his charges desperate to correct a three-game losing streak, and they produced the goods at a sunny Clandeboye on Saturday to return to winning ways.\n\nâReading there as well, on Tuesday, there were 1,200 or so for the third time this season? That atmosphere, thatâs great for the players to play in as well,â Beverland said. Brilliant (to be clapped off), and not only that; that rubs off on the players, too.\n\nâYou know, you feel the enthusiasm of the support from the fans as well, and they sense that weâre giving everything on the pitch for them. Thatâs what it has to be to make the best home atmosphere and the best clubs as well.\n\nâSo, itâs definitely happening, and we were keen today to put in a moreâ¦ a performance more like us probably from Tuesday against Portadown, you know, we were disappointed.\n\nâItâs disappointing to concede three goals against any team, you know, it doesnât happen very often, so hopefully, we came out today and we were a bit more like ourselves in a way.\n\nâWe did good preparation during the week, we were in training to put things right, to review a few things, to look at things, see what went well, what didnât go so well, and I think that paid off.\n\nâAnd credit to the backroom staff and all for the hard work they put in to get us right today, and the boys took the game plan, actioned it and we came out with a really, really good win and a clean sheet.â\n\nHoward Beverland\n\nOn that note, clean sheets are something Bangor have taken pride in of late, with a record-breaking 24 in last seasonâs double-winning crusade followed up by a commendable 11 so far in their first campaign back in the second-tier.\n\nAdd a Scott McArthur brace that sandwiched Ben Arthursâ 24th of the campaign overall, and you have about as close to a perfect day as Feeney and his staff could have envisioned from the dugout.\n\nFormer Crusaders and Coleraine stalwart Beverland, who celebrated his 34th birthday at the end of last month, understands that feeling and tips the nature of the weekendâs success to inspire a strong end to 2023/24âs events.\n\nWith the Championshipâs top two, leaders Portadown and second-placed Dundela, beaten at home by Annagh United and Institute respectively, just six points now separate the top five, and the defender reckons it is all to play for now.\n\nâItâs huge, and that was really pleasing today, getting the clean sheet in. You know, you bounce back with a win, and you never know where it takes you; you look at results today and all of a sudden, it was kind of doom and gloom on Tuesday, and then after today, youâre feeling your way back into it in a way.\n\nâSo, yeah, long way to go, especially when itâs the split. Youâre playing against the best teams and thereâll be points dropped, and thatâs whatâs happened today elsewhere.â\n\nOn the aspect of capitalising on mistakes for the goals, as was the case with both McArthurâs finishes, Beverland adds: âMassively, and I think, you know, weâre capitalisingâ¦ we played against the wind there in the first half.\n\nâAnd I think the way we controlled the game for near enough 90 minutes, I donât know if they recorded a shot, which is credit to the boys. Those conditions today were as bad a wind during a game Iâve ever played in before, and we kind of managed the game into the wind, against the wind.\n\nâThe boys kept their shape, we kept the line high, we caught them offside today many times, and a really composed performance.â\n\nHoward Beverland\n\nBeverland also felt the bench made a difference, with five substitutes called upon in the second half to ensure Bangor didnât get blown away amid the strong winds he refers to.\n\nâIt was really good across 90, you know, we have a bench that the manager can turn to and he did today,â\n\nâI think maybe four or five players came on, and I think all of them impacted the game really well. Thatâs the way itâs got to be, if you want to be one of the best teams thatâs competing to get promotion at that end of the table, youâve got to have hungry subs.\n\nâYou know, subs can sometimes be the most important people because theyâre the ones that need to be ready to be called on after five minutes or 55, and I thought they all did it today when they came on and impacted the game. It was really pleasing.â\n\nHoward Beverland\n\n(Posted: Monday, 8th April 2024)\n\nPLAYER REACTION - SCOTT McARTHUR\n\nTwo-goal Scott McArthur believes the nature of his goals in Bangorâs handsome victory over Harland and Wolff Welders on Saturday was a much-needed rub of the green after a recent difficult stretch.\n\nThe local lad, who now has 14 goals in the yellow and blue shirt this season, struck a decisive double either side of half-time in the 3-0 win at a sun-drenched Clandeboye Park, with both his openings popping up as a result of lapses in the Welders backline.\n\nMcArthurâs brace sandwiched Ben Arthursâ well-placed finish at goalkeeper Jack Millsâ near post eight minutes from the end of the first period, and the attacking midfielder believed it was a result that reflected a fine performance across both halves that ends a run of three successive defeats over the past couple of weeks.\n\nThere were strong gusts that threatened to sway Bangorâs focus at times, but the players remained planted to the ground and saw out a clean sheet â their 11th of the campaign.\n\nâDelighted for the two goals. I think we havenât had that luck recently, sort of weâve maybe made mistakes where other teams have scored so, yeah, to pounce on that, you know, set us up for the win.\n\nâI thought the first half, we were unbelievable. Created loads of chances, probably shouldâve went in maybe four or five up. We were actually playing against the wind (in the first half), but I think we played better that way.\n\nâSecond half, you know, we got that early goal and, you know, when you go 3-0 up so early, maybe a bit of concentration goes, but we were able to keep the heads.\n\nâObviously, they put on all their attackers and went for it, but we were able to keep a clean sheet, which is important again.â\n\nScott McArthur\n\nDespite recent reversals home and away to Portadown and against Institute at Clandeboye, McArthur insisted the playersâ belief in their ability to turn things around never dipped.\n\nThe 3-0 loss to the Ports on Easter Tuesday was a match where Bangor were firmly second-best, but the heartbreaking 2-1 defeat to the same opponents at Shamrock Park had a fine display to go with it and the 1-0 reverse against âStute was one where the Seasiders battled. McArthur reflected: âThe three games, the three defeats there, we had the confidence, and I actually thought Portadown away, we were very good.\n\nâAnd then Institute at home, I thought we were very good as well. I thought the game against Portadown there at home, I think that was maybe a one-off this season where we were miles off it, didnât really create anything.\n\nâBut, you know, itâs good to get a few goals today, and to keep the clean sheet is really important for us going into the last few games.\n\nâItâs important because you keep clean sheets and you donât lose games, and itâs good that, you know, I think that was me and Ben had gone maybe three or four games without scoring there, so itâs good that weâve got back on the scoresheet.\n\nâYou know, weâre confident here ahead of Dundela away.â\n\nScott McArthur\n\n(Posted: Sunday, 7th April 2024)\n\nBANGOR 3-0 H&W WELDERS\n\nBangor brought an end to their three-game losing slump in convincing style after recording a largely dominant 3-0 win over Harland and Wolff Welders in the last scheduled home outing of the 2023/24 Playr-Fit Championship season.\n\nThe victory cements an unbeaten record against the east Belfast side this campaign, with a pair of successes and two draws from the four encounters, and this outcome at a sunny but blustery Clandeboye Park proved one of the Seasidersâ best performances since achieving promotion into the second-tier last year.\n\nThe hosts broke the deadlock shortly after the half-hour mark, with some short build-up from the back by the Welders going awry and allowing Scott McArthur to capitalise. The attacking midfielder was placed one-on-one with visiting goalkeeper Jack Mills and was clinically incisive to slot low and open the scoring.\n\nWith that finish coming on 31 minutes, only six more were needed to double the advantage. In a back-to-front move that culminated in a fine pass by Tiarnan Mulvenna with the outside of his boot which slipped in the onrushing Ben Arthurs, the big striker showed fine footwork to cut inside the Welders defender and fire in at Millsâ near post to cap off a fantastic piece of counter-attacking and net his 24th of the season across all competitions.\n\nThere was some confusion surrounding the Seasidersâ third when the linesman had his flag raised for offside â against Arthurs â but McArthur was on the defensive blindside and very much onside, pouncing and blasting in at the Wall End for his 14th this term having latched onto an opportunistic ball in behind. Referee Ryan Hanna consulted with his assistant, who clarified the situation, and pointed to the centre circle to signal that the goal did, indeed, stand to extend the initiative.\n\nLee Feeneyâs men, who faced a Welders side that featured former fan favourite midfielder Dylan OâKane from the start, didnât experience too much trouble after and weathered the gusty conditions to wrap up a slick three points.\n\nGARY'S MATCH GALLERY\n\nBANGOR TEAM:\n\nJ.Taylor, R.Neale, L.Francis, C.McDermott(S.Foster), H.Beverland, B.Walker(T.Mathieson), L.Harrison(M.Bradley), T.Mulvenna, B.Cushnie(J.Hughes), S.McArthur(M.Halliday), B.Arthurs.\n\nSubs: M.Orbinson, D.Hume\n\nNEXT MATCH:\n\nSaturday, 13th April 2024 - DUNDELA v BANGOR, Championship, Wilgar Park, 3:00pm\n\n(Posted: Saturday, 6th April 2024)\n\nKnockbreda Reserves vs Bangor Reserves\n\nFriday, April 5 â Knockbreda Reserves vs Bangor Reserves, Championship/PIL Development League, Breda Park, 8pm\n\nBangor Reserves face a Friday night examination this weekend when they visit Breda Park to take on Knockbreda Reserves, hopeful of recording their first victory since the thumping 7-0 success away to Newington at the end of February.\n\nHaving endured a winless March that saw them lose four on the spin before last Saturdayâs clash with Warrenpoint Town was a late postponement â the âPoint were unable to field a team and so the fixture did not proceed â David Downes and his charges are due a bit of feelgood spirit, and that is exactly what the second-string boss will be hoping for against the team that sit third from bottom in the league.\n\nKnockbreda are likewise hungry for a return to winning ways having not won any of their last six outings, but their most recent affairs have tended to be close-run. They drew 3-3 at home to Institute a fortnight ago and ran in-form duo Queenâs University and Portadown close, losing 4-2 and 2-1 respectively, so Bangor must maintain steely determination to pick up all the reward on offer here.\n\nIndeed, it was only by a solitary goal that the Yellows won this match just before Christmas, with Charley Craig scoring the winner just before half-time, but the players will be especially fired up to answer back and keep their hopes of title glory alive. Currently sat five points behind league leaders Harland and Wolff Welders, who have played a game fewer, wins are of the essence and Bangor will be fighting hard to tag another one onto the tally on Friday.\n\n(Posted: Friday, 5th April 2024)\n\nBANGOR v H&W WELDERS\n\nSaturday, April 6 â Bangor vs Harland and Wolff Welders, Playr-Fit Championship, Clandeboye Park, 3pm\n\nItâs the last scheduled home game of the season in the Playr-Fit Championship for Bangor this weekend and, after a run of three successive defeats, the players could hardly be any more keen to give the Clandeboye faithful cause for cheer.\n\nThe Seasiders play host to Harland and Wolff Welders this Saturday on the back of a streak of losses in need of correcting â home and away reversals at the hands of Portadown have sandwiched a slender defeat to Institute in the previous trio â and the determination out on the park to return to winning ways is expected to be tangible against the divisionâs current sixth-placed side.\n\nHaving drawn twice with Paul Keeâs Welders before substitute Adam Neale bagged a winner at Blanchflower Park in the third encounter, Bangor have enjoyed a good record against the opponents on Saturday â former Seasiders Jamie Glover and Dylan OâKane are part of their panel these days â but every game will pose fresh challenges and the prior encounters will not count for much when the ball is set rolling.\n\nThe Welders are 10 points behind Bangor with a couple of games in hand, too, so they will harbour outside hopes of qualifying for the promotion play-off and know that wrapping up victory here will be essential to that aim. For that reason, Lee Feeneyâs charges know they canât let their guard drop given, in a quirk of this seasonâs league and how Dundela cannot be promoted, they are actually two points closer to the play-off than they were before kick-off on Tuesday. Thatâs still very much a live hope for the Seasiders, and a win surely boosts their ambitions here.\n\n(Posted: Friday, 5th April 2024)\n\nA MESSAGE TO SUPPORTERS FROM JOHN DOUGLAS\n\n(Posted: Wednesday, 3rd April 2024)\n\nJOHN DOUGLAS' THOUGHTS ON PORTADOWN DEFEAT\n\nBangor assistant manager John Douglas reflected honestly on a disappointing day for the Seasiders at Clandeboye Park and admits Portadown ran away deserved winners in their penultimate scheduled home match of the season.\n\nNiall Currieâs Ports netted three second-half strikes to rubber-stamp a 3-0 victory which lifts them to the Playr-Fit Championship summit, seven points clear of their Easter Tuesday hosts with just four matches remaining, and Douglas felt the Co Armagh club were well worth the three points that means Bangor stay in fourth position.\n\nThe man who has served as Lee Feeneyâs trusted No.2 for the past four years also felt that Portadownâs desire and commitment to winning first and second balls ultimately proved a pivotal factor and left the Yellows on the back foot for chunks of a game where the yellow and blue display that never really got going nor reflected the feelgood time of year.\n\nHe felt the result was fair but keenly stressed that it gives the North Down pride cause to produce a stirring reaction in their second pre-split outing this Saturday afternoon.\n\nâTo be honest with you, I thought we were second-best all over the park. I think weâve had a lot of hard luck stories this season, draws and defeats where we played well enough to win the game and havenât got our reward, but on this occasion, you know, definitely, the better side won. Weâve no queries about that.\n\n\"I thought every department, they were better than us, and it hurts me to say but I felt they wanted it more as well. They showed a bit more passion, a bit more desire than us; when there was a first ball, they were winning the first ball, the second ball, they won the second ball, and when youâre not winning the first and second balls, itâs going to be very hard for you to get anything from the game, and that was exactly the case.\n\nâI didnât think that we did the basics particularly well, I felt we were reactive rather than proactive, we were waiting for them to come at us and, again, when itâs like that, itâs very hard to get a foothold in the game.\n\nâIâd say Portadown controlled key areas of the game, and it was from winning those first and second balls that they were able to do that and they were able to put pressure on us. I know results are key but I look at performance levels first and foremost, and we just never got started in the game. The better team won, it was as simple as that, and credit to them in the end, they showed the heart and desire to deserve to win the game.\n\nâIn pre-season, people looked at Portadown as favourites to win the Championship and they brought in a lot of talented players to make that happen, and on Tuesday night, I think that was probably the Portadown that people more or less expected to see from the start of the season, and maybe they have clicked into gear. Theyâre a high-quality side, and when youâre facing up to that sort of quality, you have to match that. I thought we were second-best throughout and reacted more than proacted.\n\nâI said to the players after about that passion and desire, and theyâve shown that all season and theyâve rightly been praised for that, but Portadown wanted it more and theyâve come and ultimately deserved the three points here.â\n\nJohn Douglas\n\nDouglas added that Portadownâs quality, which shone through in the form of an Eamon Fyfe brace either side of Dougie Wilsonâs rasping volley just before the hour, called for more and branded the display a âlearning curveâ going forward that Bangor can reap rewards from. Singling out impressive Coleraine loanee Conor McDermott for plaudits, with the 26-year-old right wing-back slotting into midfield after fellow January arrival Tiarnan Mulvenna was a late pull-out of the line-up due to an injury in warm-up, Douglas felt the bar wasnât really raised across the board for a match that demanded it.\n\nâI think, and this is me being brutally honest, weâve needed players delivering eights, nines, 10s out of 10 every week to be where we are and get the results we have. Against Portadown, the only player I would say who played to the best of their capabilities was probably Conor McDermott, the rest I felt werenât at their best, and the reality is that we needed more eights, nines and 10s in a game of this magnitude.\n\nâCompeting with teams at this level, the likes of your Portadowns who have the players that they have, itâs going to take everything to get a result against them, and weâd too many out there, I thought, who probably didnât play to the best of their capabilities, and we ended up being punished for that.\n\nâWe donât have much margin for error being up at the top end and, as I say, facing up against quality opposition, your Portadowns, Dundelas, Institutes, as a newly promoted team in the league this season, weâve needed to deliver to the best of our ability to get to that position. When youâre not at that level and the other team has the quality and the determination on the day, itâs going to be a tough day, and that game there was a big learning curve for us. A big learning curve.\n\nâTheyâre a team with great quality and great depth, a lot of players who are experienced at the senior level and lots of Premiership and Championship experience, and you take a look at their bench as well, itâs got the same level of quality. Thatâs not something we have as much of, the experience at this level of the game, and this season has been about learning, and weâve been learning along the way, learning more and more about ourselves and what it takes to win at this level. Weâve some players whoâve never played at this level consistently before and theyâre learning more about it as well.\n\nâPortadown have more of that experience in their squad and I think that showed a bit here. Iâm a believer that you win as a team and you lose as a team, and we werenât good enough collectively to get something, we had to be on top of our game. Thatâs three defeats in a row now, isnât it? Weâve gone from a run of winning games 5-0, 4-0, 4-0 to stepping into a tough run of games that weâve not been as flowing in, where weâve played top, top opposition and not got anything from.\n\nâTo be in the position weâre in, and I know that we set the bar high in pre-season, but where weâre in a position where weâre in the conversation for potentially being promoted out of this league, itâs been a credit to the players whoâve gone out and performed as consistently as we had been to go on a long unbeaten run and that run in the league over the last few months where weâve got ourselves into where we are now. Theyâre a great squad, great characters and weâve never doubted their commitment.\n\nâNow, weâve got to work on getting that consistency back, and itâs as simple as getting back on the training pitch and working hard to take on this run of games, the final run-in. Our seasonâs not done, make no mistake about that. Weâre far from done, weâre still fighting for that play-off position and we want to have a strong end to have a chance of playing in that. And weâve seen how unpredictable this league can be, so we need to be prepared to capitalise when the chance comes along to make up ground and go for the play-off.\n\nâItâs a learning curve, and if we approach that and look back on that in the right way and we come out with the right mentality, I have no doubt weâll come out better on the other side and be a better team for it.â\n\nJohn Douglas\n\nSpring is a season for blooming rather than wilting, and that is exactly what Douglas will be challenging his players to do when they take on the four remaining games of the post-split.\n\nHe wants the players to stand up and be counted, starting with this weekendâs home clash with Harland and Wolff Welders, and believes the characters in the dressing room have the resolve required to start firing again in the season climax.\n\nâYou could hear a pin drop in the changing room after, the players were hurting and they know when theyâve not performed as well as theyâre capable of.\n\nâThey donât need Lee or me or Deano (Dean Gordon) or Michael (McClelland) to tell them, they know where theyâve fallen short and they know in their heads how theyâll put it right.\n\nâThatâs one reason why it is a great dressing room to be involved in, the players are never saying afterwards that this didnât work in the game or that didnât work in the game. They already know and theyâll work hard to put it right.\n\nâWeâve all a choice to make here for the final four games of the season. Do we curl up and let the season fizzle out, or do we stand up and go and be counted in the final four games and show what weâre capable of?\n\nâI know the players will go into training fired up and determined to give a reaction, thereâs absolutely no doubt in my mind, and weâre looking ahead to whatâs going to be another tough, tough game at home against the Welders and then three games away from home.â\n\nJohn Douglas\n\n(Posted: Wednesday, 3rd April 2024)\n\nBANGOR 0-3 PORTADOWN\n\nIt proved an Easter Tuesday to forget for Bangor as Lee Feeneyâs side suffered a third straight defeat in the Playr-Fit Championship â 3-0 at home to Portadown â to commence their post-split schedule.\n\nA goalless first half was followed by a second period in which Niall Currieâs Ports claimed the game by the scruff of the neck, with Eamon Fyfe the tormentor-in-chief during that spell. Indeed, less than one minute after the restart, the Coleraine loanee capitalised ruthlessly on a slip in defence by Reece Neale before slotting the ball beyond the onrushing James Taylor to break the deadlock for the visitors.\n\nOn 50 minutes, Fyfe contrived to somehow spurn the ball wide from Ryan Mayseâs late lay-off with an open goal to aim for â a miss that you really would have had to see to believe â however the reprieve was brief for Bangor. Seven minutes later, former Ballymena United defender Dougie Wilson rifled an unstoppable shot on the volley into the roof of the Wall End net that doubled Portadownâs advantage.\n\nBen Arthurs almost halved the deficit having crashed a low attempt off the base of the post, but the next goal was again to arrive at the opposite end and again through ex-Dundela forward Fyfe, whoâs hit the target four times against the Yellows this term and who poked low into the bottom right corner on the stroke of added-time that ultimately signed and sealed the three points for the Co Armagh men, who are now seven points ahead of Bangor at the summit.\n\nBANGOR TEAM:\n\nJ.Taylor, R.Neale, H.Beverland(G.Beattie), L.Francis, S.Foster, L.Harrison(B.Walker), M.Bradley(D.Hume), T.Mathieson(B.Cushnie), S.McArthur(M.Halliday), B.Arthurs, C.McDermott.\n\nSubs: M.Orbinson, J.Hughes\n\nNEXT MATCH:\n\nSaturday, 6th April 2024, BANGOR v H&W WELDERS, Championship, Clandeboye Park, 3:00pm\n\n(Posted: Tuesday, 2nd April 2024)\n\nBANGOR v PORTADOWN\n\nTuesday, April 2 â Bangor vs Portadown, Playr-Fit Championship, Clandeboye Park, 7.45pm\n\nBangor begin their post-split on home soil this Easter Tuesday, with Portadown visiting Clandeboye Park in what is the fifth and final meeting between the sides this campaign.\n\nThe Ports, in second, have two wins having recorded two 2-1 victories at Shamrock Park â Zach Barrâs double in the Irish Cup was followed by a last-gasp Kenny Kane gut punch 11 days previous to this encounter â with the Seasiders having added a 2-2 draw at home to Augustâs 1-0 triumph on the road thanks to Scott McArthurâs sublime solo finish that day.\n\nShould the hosts bid to stay on the coattails of those leading the pack, namely Portadown â who are four points better off going into this duel â and league leaders Dundela, who wonât be able to go up but are still chasing the Playr-Fit Championship title, then a win would likely be vital both for picking up a precious three points for the season tally after successive losses and showing the likes of Niall Currieâs men that the Yellowsâ flame hasnât burnt out just yet.\n\nLee Feeney and his charges will enter this rapturous nighttime encounter with hunger, and in the wake of a 1-0 defeat to Institute last time out when captain Mikhail Kennedyâs header 62 minutes in made all the difference, Bangor will hope that this holiday evening can kick off a barnstorming run-in that would do the fans proud for the backing that has been afforded throughout this term. With this also being the penultimate home league game of the split and final floodlit duel involving the Seasiders at Clandeboye in 2023/24 â pending, of course, any potential play-off â the players will be keen to produce their best selves for this battle.\n\nBangor assistant coach Dean Gordon has rallied the players to produce a big finish that befits their status as the âbest teamâ in the Playr-Fit Championship this season.\n\nThe Seasiders tackle Portadown at Clandeboye Park in the first of the final five on Easter Tuesday hopeful of marking their return to winning ways following successive defeats to Institute last Wednesday and the Ports the previous Friday. Now, the current fourth-placed occupiers have the chance for swift revenge on the latter and, speaking after the 1-0 home reversal to Stute in which Mikhail Kennedy headed the winner in just after the hour mark, Gordon insists his players will be going all out to give Bangor supporters cause for cheer in the run-in.\n\nHe explained:\n\nâWe just keep going the way weâve been going and just take one game at a time now. Weâre good enough, we are good enough to go and win every game. Every game in this split, weâre good enough to go and win.\n\nâThereâs not one team in this league that we can say is better than us, and weâre not going to blow the players up and say that, but I strongly believe from a personal perspective that weâre the best team in the league.\n\nâThey (the players) believe that, and weâve just got to show that for the last five games and give the supporters something they deserve.\n\nâStarting off in the season, we were expected to be where we are now? Weâre probably exceeding expectations, and weâve grown as the seasonâs gone on, weâve just grown from strength to strength.\n\nâThe character of the dressing room and the support we get is just, itâs second to none, itâs fantastic.â\n\nDean Gordon\n\n(Posted: Monday, 1st April 2024)\n\nHALLIDAY LANDS NEW 2 YEAR PRO CONTRACT\n\nMichael Halliday has agreed a new 2 year professional contract with Bangor Football Club.\n\nThe 44 year old striker joined the Seasiders in 2018 and has scored 40 goals for the club. Michael's new contract will see him through to the end of the 2025/26 season, with an option to extend even further.\n\nMichael said:\n\n\"I am delighted to commit my future to Bangor Football Club. I might be the club's oldest ever player, but I still feel that I've got the legs to compete at this level and higher for at least another two season.\n\n\"Right now, I feel like i could keep on playing until I am 50. I still have a lot to offer the club both on and off the field.\n\n\"If truth be told, Ben Arthurs actually wanted my signing to be a condition of his recent contract renewal, but I wanted to wait and see.\"\n\nMichael Halliday\n\n(Posted: Monday, 1st April 2024)\n\nRESERVES GAME CALLED OFF\n\nToday's Bangor Reserves game against Warrenpoint Town Reserves was called off, with Warrenpoint unable to field a full team.\n\n(Posted: Saturday, 30th March 2024)\n\nRESERVES AT HOME ON SATURDAY\n\nSaturday, March 30 â Bangor Reserves vs Warrenpoint Town, Championship/PIL Development League, Clandeboye Park, 11am\n\nBangor Reserves bring the curtain down on a rather downbeat March at Clandeboye Park this Saturday morning when they entertain Warrenpoint Town Reserves.\n\nHaving hit the ropes after a run of four consecutive defeats to Dundela (2-0), Portadown (3-2), Queenâs University and Harland and Wolff Welders (both 3-1) this month, the Seasiders are determined to bounce back fighting and clinch victory by hook or by crook against the âPoint, who are 10th-placed in the Championship/PIL Development League and themselves are entering this clash on the back of a three-game losing streak.\n\nPurely for rebuilding momentum and knowing now that they are two points off the league-leading Welders, whose comeback victory at Blanchflower Park last weekend ensured they leapfrogged their opponents into top spot with a couple of games in hand, David Downesâ young Yellows are on the back foot really for the first time this whole campaign and know that they must stay on the coattails of those around them to maintain hopes of hitting their title stride once more with just five games to go.\n\nCharley Craigâs first-half penalty had sent Bangor into the lead and their performance during the opening 45 minutes was deserving of the advantage at the interval, and it was a similar story when Jack McCosh bulleted home a header that had the Seagulls ahead at the break against Queenâs the previous week, but delivering for the full 90 and not dropping their guard is what must be done should those in yellow and blue bid to sustain their momentum right until the dying embers.\n\n(Posted: Friday, 29th March 2024)\n\nTHE PLAYERS REACTIONS\n\nBangor duo Seanna Foster and Ben Cushnie both felt the Seasiders were slightly hard done by in their defeat to Institute at Clandeboye Park in the final outing before the split, though both insist the hard work hasnât stopped and they will be pushing for a reaction as soon as possible. Having ended the traditional set of 33 fixtures in fourth-place, Lee Feeneyâs men now know they will entertain Portadown in the first of the final five on Easter Tuesday when they will bid to end a mini-blip of two successive defeats in the Playr-Fit Championship.\n\nThe Portsâ last-gasp winner over Bangor at Shamrock Park had those in yellow and blue very hungry to respond in this one, but Mikhail Kennedyâs close-range header just after the hour mark proved the difference and saw Kevin Deeryâs Stute leap above their hosts into third. Foster felt his side were good value for at least something from the contest and believes it was as good a performance âfor 90 minutesâ as the Seasiders have given in some time.\n\nâYeah, you seen the football we played throughout the game and we played them completely off the park. Thereâs been times this season when weâve got three points playing scrappy footballâ¦ you know, thatâs probably the first time weâve performed for 90 minutes.\n\nâAnd then you see the reaction in the changing room, the boys are completely disappointed. Weâre not going in arguing with each other, which shows a sign of a good side, and you know youâre going to get a reaction from us because weâve done it all year.â\n\nSeanna Foster\n\nFoster, who was making his first start for the senior side in four months having undergone knee surgery around the turn of the year, is relishing the chance to make amends. The Cliftonville loanee (27), who has notched up almost 60 first-team appearances since first linking up with Bangor at the start of the 2022/23 campaign, reckons a turning point is close and is looking forward to seeing what the team can still achieve.\n\nâThatâs the thing with football. Thereâs always a game the next week, or thereâs always a way to make amends. And, with the two teams thatâs given us a bad reaction in the last week, you know, the tables will turn.\n\nâWeâve to play them again, and hopefully, itâs us coming out on top next time.â\n\nSeanna Foster\n\nCushnie has also had injury turbulence to overcome this term and was introduced as a sub in this one when he replaced midfielder Marty Bradley, with the forward targeting a clean run of match fitness for whatâs left of this term.\n\nâYeah, just, my ankle flared up after the Ballinamallard game, so itâs just about building my fitness back up and getting back in the starting 11 hopefully next week,â he explained. On the game itself, the 22-year-old continues:\n\nâI think Seanna said it, I think we were the better team Iâd say for the 90 minutes, really. I think some decisions arenât going our way, some more obvious than others, but at the end of the day, you canât blame it all on decisions.\n\nâI thought over 90 minutes, we were the better team, we were a bit unlucky.â\n\nBen Cushnie\n\nOn the disallowed goal, Cushnie said:\n\nâI donât know, I think he (the referee) said that it was something to do with the follow-through from Tomâs (Mathieson) tackle, but I was standing right in front of it and he took all the ball.â\n\nBen Cushnie\n\nFoster also believes that lessons will be learned going forward and praised the relationships and responsibility within the team that have underpinned Bangorâs success in 2023/24.\n\nâYou know, they were going to get chances and theyâve scored, and the teamâs going to learn from it, weâre never going to give chances like that away again. The teamâs building a lot of maturity and weâre building relationships across the back and the midfield.\n\nâItâs taken time, thereâs been a lot of changes, a lot of changes in personnel, a lot of injuries which affect things. You know, it just shows that whenever someone drops out and someone steps in, everyone knows their roles, everyone knows their responsibilities and knows their jobs for the team.â\n\nSeanna Foster\n\nDEAN GORDON'S REACTION\n\nSometimes you donât always get what you deserve in football, and that was the view taken by Bangor assistant coach Dean Gordon in the aftermath of the 1-0 home loss to Institute on Wednesday night.\n\nIn the Seasidersâ final pre-split outing, a solitary Mikhail Kennedy header proved difference-making on 62 minutes as the ex-Crusaders hitman bulleted a header from Daniel Laffertyâs free-kick supply past James Taylor and ultimately secured three points for the Foylesiders.\n\nIt also meant Stute leapfrogged their hosts into third-place, meaning that Bangor will begin their Playr-Fit Championship post-split run-in with a mouthwatering battle with Portadown at Clandeboye Park on Easter Tuesday. Gordon, who shed light on the regroup following last Fridayâs last-gasp 2-1 reversal at the hands of the Ports that has now been made successive defeats for the first time since late October, is optimistic going into the final five and insists when Bangor clicked into gear, it made for some fine viewing at times. He also opined that Ben Arthursâ would-be leveller merely 10 minutes from time that was chalked off after an adjudged foul on Stute stopper Gareth Muldoon shouldâve stood, but he is not one to dwell and believes the Yellows will save their best for last.\n\nâObviously, coming off the back of the Portadown game, weâd regrouped, we knew exactly what Institute was going to come in with tonight and they were going to put the three lines of defence up as such and it was going to be hard to break down.\n\nâFirst 20 minutes or so, we probably did struggle to break them down, but then we got into the flow of things, and then for 20 or 25 minutes, I thought we came in, first half, on top of the game. I felt we were creating more chances than what they were creating in the game, and we played some beautiful football at times, some really good football. Second half, we were confident enough to come out to believe that we were going to continue from where we were, and we did.\n\nâThe performances from the boys in there was superb tonight, you couldnât fault a player. Every single player didnât leave nothing out there, emptied the tanks. Weâre beat by a single goal, it was a great delivery from Lafferty, and the man at the near post has scored a header. But again, donât want to talk about referees, but Benâs goal, I thought there was nothing wrong with it, I thought the keeper dropped it and spilt it. People say you create your own luck in football, but we just donât seem to be getting the rub of it at the moment at critical times in the game, et cetera.\n\nâSo, we just regroup again, we go again. We still believeâ¦ thereâs five games left, we win all five games, weâre still going to be in there. Weâre a good side, the boys are gutted there in the dressing room as we are as management and staff, but we go again on Tuesday.â\n\nDean Gordon\n\nGordon praised the midfieldâs application to the cause and sequences of play in the first half that did bring about some flowing moves that led to open-play chances. He also hailed the work-rate of the team as a whole and felt Bangorâs defensive organisation was also a highlight.\n\nâI thought our midfield three, I thought Marty Bradley, Lewis Harrison and Tiarnan Mulvenna, first half, was outstanding in the middle there,â Gordon reflected.\n\nâThey were showing tenacityâ¦ Lee said it at half-time as well, when weâre in possession, the football we were playing, it was flowing, it was one, two-touch, it was triangles being played, it was people running off the ball.\n\nâWhen we lost the ball back, there was tenacity to win it back, you could see the hunger to win the ball back so we could start playing again. So, you know, for me, first half, those three in the middle there, unfortunately we lost Marty Bradley with a bit of a calf strain early in the second half and Cush come on in that No.10 role.\n\nâThe only save James Taylor had to make was really, probably, 10 minutes to go, there was one down to his right-hand side and he got a big strong hand on it and cleared it. And then you could say, putting bodies on the line, the last five minutes, there was a mad goalmouth scramble, I think it was three or four challengesâ¦ they looked destined to score maybe a second goal as we were pushing for the equaliser.\n\nâThe boys just thrown themselves on the line to defend our goal, you know. Every player, every single player, you couldnât criticise one of them, they gave everything tonight.â\n\nDean Gordon\n\n(Posted: Thursday, 28th March 2024)\n\nBANGOR 0-1 INSTITUTE\n\nBangor suffered a second consecutive loss in the Playr-Fit Championship on Wednesday night after a 1-0 defeat to fellow promotion chasers Institute, whose resolve in defence proved a source of frustration all night for Lee Feeney's hosts who slip below the Foylesiders into fourth for the split.\n\nAn opening of few chances threatened to spark into life when Reece Neale's delivery was marginally out of reach of Ben Arthurs on 16 minutes, with Institute stopper Gareth Muldoon stretching shrewdly to prevent any own goal scenario emerging at the Clandeboye Road end. At the other end, James Taylor just kept a looping delivery from crossing the goalline, but precious little in front of either goal emerged until Scott McArthur dragged wide of the left-hand post from Arthurs' layoff five minutes from the interval and Tom Mathieson sliced over from close range on the stroke.\n\nA fantastic goal-saving clearance from the auxiliary centre-back Conor McDermott on the blow kept Bangor's lead intact with Mikhail Kennedy lurking as a cagey battle opened up late in the half, but Kennedy did open the scoring just after the hour mark when he flicked in from the near post from a free-kick scenario. Bangor sought to build up their rhythm yet again, with Tiarnan Mulvenna firing just over the bar from outside the area after a well-worked move involving a number of short interchanges.\n\nArthurs had a goal disallowed following a Reece Neale corner on 80 minutes, with a foul on the Stute goalkeeper adjudged despite extensive protestations from the stands, and Lewis Francis headed a Ben Cushnie cross over in added-time to compound what was a difficult night in front of goal for the Seasiders.\n\nBANGOR TEAM\n\nJ.Taylor, R.Neale, L.Francis, C.McDermott, S.Foster(H.Beverland),T.Mathieson(M.Halliday), M.Bradley(B.Cushnie), T.Mulvenna, L.Harrison, B.Arthurs, S.McArthur.\n\nSubs: M.Orbinson, A.Neale, M.Watterson\n\nNEXT MATCH:\n\nTuesdsy, 2nd April 2024 - BANGOR v PORTADOWN, Championship, Clandeboye Park, 7:45pm\n\n(Posted: Wednesday, 27th March 2024)\n\nGERRY ARMSTRONG CUP WINNERS\n\nBangor Central Primary School were crowned champions at this yearâs Gerry Armstrong Cup at Clandeboye Park.\n\nNine primary schools from across North Down entered the tournament, which was held on Friday 22 March.\n\nBangor FC Community Liaison Officer Paul Cain said: âCongratulations to Central Primary school for winning the trophy and all the teams who took part. The quality of the football was excellent, and I hope all the young people enjoyed the event.\n\nâAs a community-based club, we organise the annual tournament to bring together local primary schools, so they can participate in sport and enjoy the experience of playing at Clandeboye Park with classmates and parents watching on.â\n\nTeams involved in the competition included: Ballyholme, Ballymagee, Bangor Central, Kilmaine, Rathmore, St Comgallâs, St Malachyâs, St Patrickâs, Holywood and Towerview.\n\nPaul continued: âHuge thanks to Chris Turner and his team at McDonaldâs, Bangor for providing fruit and refreshments at the competition. Thanks also to volunteer Sam Gamble who organised the fixtures and co-ordinated the overall event.\n\nâSpecial appreciation, however, must go to former Bangor FC and Northern Ireland footballing legend Gerry Armstrong for his continued support of the tournament. Weâre already excited about the 2025 event.â\n\n(Posted: Tuesday, 26th March 2024)\n\nBANGOR v INSTITUTE\n\nWednesday, March 27 â Bangor vs Institute, Playr-Fit Championship, Clandeboye Park, 8pm\n\nThereâs merely one matchday remaining of Bangorâs pre-split schedule, with Institute visiting Clandeboye Park for a rare Wednesday night kick-off in a clash of third against fourth in the Playr-Fit Championship.\n\nLee Feeneyâs Seasiders are intent on dusting themselves down after the agonising 2-1 defeat to Portadown last time out and, pending how the Ports do on Tuesday evening at home to a basement-dwelling but recently resurgent Knockbreda, could have second-place up for grabs if they better the Shamrock Park outfitâs result 24 hours earlier â but it wonât be easy against the only side they havenât beaten in the league yet.\n\nStute, who first visited Clandeboye Park in early September when Lewis Francisâ 97th-minute headed equaliser cancelled out Kirk McLaughlinâs second-half opener, emerged victorious by inflicting the heaviest defeat of Bangorâs season upon them at the Brandywell â a 4-0 rev"
