After graduation, Thomas settled back in his hometown of Pomfret and established himself as a lawyer.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Thomas Grosvenor served with 1st Connecticut Regiment (1781), Continental Army during the American Revolution.\n\nThomas Grosvenor is a DAR Patriot Ancestor, A048966.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Revolution, Thomas entered his country's service when Connecticut raised and officered the first seven regiments for the relief of Massachusetts in the Revolution. Thomas was commissioned second lieutenant of the Third Regiment on May 1, 1775 under Colonel Israel Putnam and Lieutenant-Colonel Experience Storrs. On the evening of June 16, 1775, Lieutenant Grosvenor was detailed with thirty-one men drafted from his company to march to Charlestown under Captain Thomas Knowlton, and with about a hundred others of the same regiment were stationed before noon next day at the rail fence on the left the breastworks on Breed's Hill (commonly known as Bunker Hill):\n\nOn June 16, 1775, having learned that the British were planning to send troops from Boston to occupy the hills surrounding the city, some 1,000 colonial militiamen under Colonel William Prescott (1726-95) built earthen fortifications on top of Breed’s Hill, overlooking Boston and located on the Charlestown Peninsula. (The men originally had been ordered to construct their fortifications atop Bunker Hill but instead chose the smaller Breed’s Hill, closer to Boston.)\n\nOn June 17, some 2,200 British forces under the command of Major General William Howe (1729-1814) and Brigadier General Robert Pigot (1720-96) landed on the Charlestown Peninsula then marched to Breed’s Hill. As the British advanced in columns against the Americans, Prescott, in an effort to conserve the Americans’ limited supply of ammunition, reportedly told his men, “Don’t fire until you see the whites of their eyes!” When the Redcoats were within several dozen yards, the Americans let loose with a lethal barrage of musket fire, throwing the British into retreat.\n\nAfter re-forming their lines, the British attacked again, with much the same result. The men were now low on ammunition, and when the Redcoats went up the hill for a third time, they reached the redoubts and engaged the Americans in hand-to-hand combat. The outnumbered Americans were forced to retreat. However, by the end of the engagement, the Patriots’ gunfire had cut down some 1,000 enemy troops, with more than 200 killed and more than 800 wounded. More than 100 Americans perished, while more than 300 others were wounded.[3]\n\nColonel Grosvenor relayed in a letter to Daniel Putnam, Apr 30, 1818, respecting General Dearborn's charges against the behavior of General Putnam at Bunker Hill, that his command of thirty men and one subaltern lost eleven killed or wounded; \"Among the latter was myself, though not so severely as to prevent my retiring.\" At Winter Hill, where entrenchments had been thrown up by the Connecticut troops, the Provincials made their last stand. Colonel Grosvenor carried a musket and used to recount that he fired his nine cartridges, under the same precision of aim as if fox hunting, and saw a man fall after each shot. His wound was caused by a musket ball through the hand. Before striking his hand it had passed through the rail and it passed through the butt of his musket after piercing his hand and finally bruised his breast. He bound up his hand with a white cravat and remained on until after the battle.\n\nThis incident was immortalized in Die Schlacht von Bunker-Hill by Johann Georg Nordheim (after John Trumbull's painting of the battle of Bunker Hill). The commanding figure in the right foreground with sword was intended to represent Lieutenant Grosvenor accompanied by his colored servant.\n\nDie Schlacht von Bunker-Hill (The Battle of Bunker’s Hill)\n\nThomas became Captain on January 1, 1776 and served in Colonel Durkee's Regiment, later travelling to New York where he advanced to the rank of Major in the Continental service on January 1, 1777. On March 13, 1778, Thomas was again promoted as Lieutenant Colonel of his Regiment, and in July of 1779 was appointed to the office of General Health Inspector of the Connecticut Division, which he retained until December of 1781. In May, 1782, he was made Lieutenant Colonel Commandant of the 1st Connecticut Regiment, and remained with it on the Hudson until his retirement on January 1, 1783, after nearly eight years of highly honorable service, when the Connecticut regiments were consolidated under act of Congress of August 7, 1782.\n\nAfter returning to life Pomfret, Thomas married Anne Mumford, daughter of Paul Mumford (Yale 1754), of Newport, Rhode Island on 1 July 1785[4], and together had five children, three sons and two daughters. Thomas served as a Representative in the General Assembly during eight sessions between 1789 and 1793[5], and served as one of the Governor's Assistants (Council) from 1794 to 1801.[6]\n\nFrom 1806 to 1815 Thomas held the office of Chief Judge of the Court of Common Pleas for Windham County, having been one of the Associate Judges for over twenty years previously. He also served as Judge of the Probate Court for the Pomfret district for nearly thirty years before 1815.[7] The diploma signed by Washington constituting him a member of the Order of Cincinnati, currently acknowledged to be in the possession of the family of Bertram G. Goodhue, hung until 1891 in the hall of the mansion house which Thomas built at Pomfret and in which he died in on 11 July 1825.\n\nResearch Notes\n\nSiblings\n\nJohn Grosvenor (1733–1775\n\nNathan Grosvenor (1735–1738)\n\nHannah Grosvenor Marcy (1736–1790)\n\nNathan Grosvenor (1740–1764)\n\nPrudence Grosvenor (1741–1743)\n\nSeth Grosvenor (1748–1808)\n\nAbel Grosvenor (1750–1780)\n\nChildren\n\nThomas Mumford (28 Mar 1786)\n\nPeter , I (23 Jul 1787)\n\nAnn (9 Sep 1789)\n\nMajor Peter , II (25 Jan 1794)\n\nJohn Henry (23 Aug 1796)\n\nHannah (19 May 1799)\n\nSources\n\n↑ \"Connecticut Births and Christenings, 1649-1906,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:F749-35G : 11 February 2018), Thomas Grosvenor, 20 Sep 1744; citing ; FHL microfilm unknown.
