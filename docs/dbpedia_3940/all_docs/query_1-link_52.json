        "text": "Walsh College Making Higher Education Affordableâ€¦For All! We all know the \"great degree debate.\" And, we've heard these questions for years... \"Is a college degree really worth it?\" \"Do I need higher education to succeed in life?\" \"How can there be an ROI after all my loans, and all of this debt?\" Despite the value proposition questions, education remains the one asset that no one can take from you. An earned degree can never be lost, and in fact, it pays lifelong returns. Study after study, hiring trends and income data show that a college degree correlates with higher earning potential, better overall health and wealth satisfaction, and greater levels of happiness and well-being. Education creates pathways from scarcity to abundance, and from fear to freedom. It transforms individuals, families, communities, and the world. Itâ€™s not just a social good for business and society. Itâ€™s an invaluable imperative to create a better future and a better world. Thereâ€™s just one problemâ€¦the cost of a degree keeps rising. And this makes it challenging to afford and less accessible. Walsh College wants to change this. We want to make our education #affordable and #accessible to every individual who desires to work hard and earn a Walsh College degree. Thatâ€™s why we created the #WalshWay. Click on the below video to hear more about how we are making higher education affordable for all...for good! #bestcollege #business #technology #changetheworld the #WalshWay #joinourmovement Be part of #WalshWay today: ðŸ‘‡ https://lnkd.in/gCM9yQeA https://lnkd.in/gk3hY4nR\n\nNumerous people have asked me, \"Why didn't you participate in any of Clayton State's commencement ceremonies this past weekend since you are a 2023 graduate?\" First, I want to congratulate all my peers who graduated this semester!! Despite my absence, my spirits and prayers were with you all. But for me, I know that my work isn't done. I've caught my second wind and am focused on what's in store for me next year. So, instead of celebrating, I'm still studying and preparing like I have four more years left. And I will do that every four years for the rest of my life. ðŸ˜Ž I've studied a lot of great athletes, entertainers, politicians, and academics, and they all have one thing in common; They are obsessed with learning from their losses and mistakes and enjoy utilizing their earned wisdom on new challenges while inspiring others. And how well they do that under pressure defines their character and leadership style to the masses. For me, receiving a college degree is just the result of being someone who wanted to spend 1,460 days working on their writing, communication, and time-management skills to prepare themselves for a new set of challenges that requires the addition of even more skills. I've shown people that I can spend 1,460 days achieving a goal against all odds while inspiring and communicating to others that they can do the same. The most beneficial thing I got from being a college student at Clayton State University was the opportunity to practice and receive valuable feedback on my efforts from excellent researchers and practitioners in their respective fields. When I started college, I didn't have an endgame. I had a game plan. That's the difference between me and most people, in and out of college. Besides, I'll be back in Spring 2024. #Dreamsmadereal #NoLimits"
