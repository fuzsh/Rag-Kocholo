        "text": "Smithsonian Institution’s National Air and Space Museum (NASM)\n\nSPACE ARTIFACTS: CRAY-1 SUPERCOMPUTER\n\nThe CRAY-1 is an early example of a class of machines called “supercomputers,” so named because of their ability to solve very complex mathematical problems that ordinary computers-even large commercial systems-cannot practically handle. This machine, serial #14, was sold by Cray Research, Inc. of Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, and installed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. The CRAY-1‘s designer, and founder of the company, was Seymour R. Cray (1926-1996), who before founding Cray Research had previously had designed advanced computers for UNIVAC and the Control Data Corporation. Unlike most computers which consist of rectangular boxes filled with printed circuit boards, the CRAY-1 is wired with thousands of wires soldered by hand, and its circuits are arranged in a three-quarters circle. Both help increase the speeds at which signals travel from one part of the computer to another. Hefty power supplies, covered with naugahyde, are located below each of the circuit bays, giving the overall impression of a very expensive piece of lounge furniture.\n\nAT NCAR, the machine was used between (approximately) 1977 and 1983, where it performed complex calculations involving the numerical modeling of weather phenomena. Other CRAY-1 computers installed elsewhere were used for modeling nuclear reactions inside weapons, code breaking, and the behavior of air over wings an other surfaces. It is, of course, this latter application that is of interest to the National Air and Space Museum and the reason this machine is in its collections. From a mathematical standpoint, however, the equations solved in three of the above four areas are similar, and involve the flows of fluids in complex, nonlinear ways. For the aerospace community the advent of supercomputers has been almost revolutionary. The complexities of fluid flow have always resisted a direct mathematical analysis. From the time of the Wright Brothers aircraft designers have relied on the wind tunnel to develop and refine their designs. Wind tunnels, however, are expensive to operate, and it is especially difficult to build tunnels that operate at the high speeds encountered by modern vehicles such as the Space Shuttle. Supercomputers can thus supplement tunnels in many areas, although earlier predictions that they would completely replace tunnels proved to be naive. A CRAY-1 cost on the order of $10 million, but when properly used it could easily pay for itself in terms of reduced wind tunnel time, and resulting vehicles that flew with better performance. Modern transport aircraft like the Boeing 777, and new-generation space vehicles like the Lockheed Martin Venture Star, would be inconceivable without supercomputers."
