        "text": "PORTLAND, Ore. (AP -- The thing that makes a supercomputer super today is the\n\nsame thing that drives a home computer. But more of it.\n\nSupercomputers were once room-sized machines and the stuff of technology\n\nlegends, helping the government forecast weather or scientists analyze\n\nearthquakes, create new drugs and understand nuclear physics.\n\nTheyre still the most powerful and expensive computers being made but now\n\nthey look like big refrigerators. And theyre different inside, using\n\nmicroprocessors, the chips that run desktop computers, by the dozen or\n\nsometimes hundreds.\n\nAnd the market, once dominated by Cray Research, has opened up to include\n\nfirms like Intel Corp., the worlds leading chipmaker, and Silicon Graphics\n\nInc., known best for the computers used to make the film Jurassic Park.\n\nCompanies now use one of two approaches to building supercomputers: stringing\n\nchips together to share one central memory core, or stringing chips together\n\nand giving each its own separate memory.\n\nThe first approach is called symmetric multiprocessing, or SMP, and the second\n\nis known as massively parallel processing, or MPP.\n\nThe big difference is that SMP supercomputers can grow only so big. In theory,\n\nthere is no limit to the size of massively parallel machines because each\n\nmicroprocessor carries its own memory.\n\nAt some point, as you keep adding processors in the SMP design, efficiency\n\ndeclines because theyre all trying to get into the same memory, said Wendy\n\nVittori, operations director for the Intel scalable systems division, based\n\nnear Portland.\n\nThe main role of the supercomputer in the big picture is primarily to do\n\nsimulations of physical events, anywhere you have complex physical\n\nphenomena, Vittori said.\n\nThey are the tasks that Cray Research began building supercomputers to handle\n\nwhen the main customers were universities, the military and the government.\n\nBut things have changed since 1976, when Cray delivered its first\n\nsupercomputer.\n\nIts a market thats shrinking mainly because of government contractors\n\ndeclining with the end of the Cold War and the Evil Empire, said Steve\n\nConway, chief spokesman for Cray, based in the Minneapolis suburb of Eagan,\n\nMinn.\n\nCray still dominates sales of supercomputers costing more than $5 million,\n\nwith 71 percent of the 1994 market, said Gary Smaby, founder of the Smaby\n\nGroup, a Minneapolis computer marketing research firm.\n\nCray also holds 35 percent of the $1 million to $5 million market, with Intel,\n\nIBM and the three main Japanese supercomputer makers, Fujitsu, Hitachi and\n\nNEC, all fighting for second place in the 5 percent to 15 percent range.\n\nBut in the rapidly-growing market for small supercomputers in the $100,000 to\n\n$1 million range, the leader by far is Silicon Graphics with more than a third\n\nof the market share. Cray has only a tiny slice of the pie.\n\nHoward Richmond, analyst at the Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn., said Silicon\n\nGraphics grabbed a large share by offering relatively low prices for reliable\n\nSMP machines that run on proven software.\n\nThe combination not only appeals to researchers and engineering companies, but\n\nit also appeals to commercial customers.\n\nThe issue is how you make money with technology, Richmond said. Follow\n\nthe money. Its in industry, never in universities and government.\n\n(Published text ends here\n\nWilly Shih, marketing director for Silicon Graphics supercomputer division,\n\nsays the company has exploited the supply of cheap computer chips and its own\n\nexperience in computer graphics software to build SMP machines that operate\n\nmore efficiently than more expensive competitors.\n\nBecause its more affordable, you attract more mainstream users, Shih\n\nsaid.\n\nSales of massively parallel machines have lagged behind symmetric\n\nmultiprocessor computers partly because nobody has developed software that\n\ntakes advantage of the design.\n\nParallel processing is software intensive, and the key to getting it to work\n\nis the software, said Irving Wladawsky-Berger, head of IBM Power Parallel\n\nDivision in Somers, N.Y.\n\nIBM and Intel are battling each other in the high- and mid-range of the\n\nsupercomputer market, holding roughly equal market shares. But IBM is busily\n\ncourting commercial customers while Intel remains focused on the scientific\n\nand university market.\n\nThe only reason they were selling anything was that government and academics\n\nwere buying for laboratories, Gartner Groups Richmond said of Intel.\n\nTheyre good at components. But if it takes more than a couple pieces of\n\nsilicon, theyre out of their league.\n\nHe said Intel appears to be adopting a strategy of supplying chips to\n\nsupercomputer manufacturers, just as it does for personal computer makers.\n\nFor instance, Unisys Corp. recently announced a line of small supercomputers\n\nrunning on Intels Pentium desktop chips. The Unisys machine is aimed at\n\ndepartment stores, airlines, banks, insurance companies and other customers\n\nthat handle huge databases every day.\n\nCertainly its the growth market, said Nancy Stewart, an analyst at\n\nDataquest, a San Jose, Calif., market research firm. Supercomputing is\n\nmigrating to the commercial environment.\n\nINFOBOX:\n\nHD:Supercomputing facts:\n\nn Supercomputers have been in use in the United States for about the past 20\n\nyears, but had been confined to government research laboratories such as the\n\nLos Alamos and the Lawrence Livermore national labs. Most were used in defense\n\nprojects, and access was extremely limited.\n\nn A team of scientists from Sandia National Laboratories and Intel Corp. own\n\nthe most recent world speed record for supercomputing after linking two Intel\n\nParagon computers. Last January, the team beat the previous Japanese\n\nperformance record, achieving performance of 281 gigaflops, or billions of\n\nfloating point operations per second."
