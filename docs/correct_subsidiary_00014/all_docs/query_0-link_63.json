        "text": "Hyphenation for 'cray'\n\nShowing how to split the syllables of 'cray'.\n\nSyllabification or syllabication is the separation of a word into syllables, whether spoken or written. The written separation is usually marked by a hyphen when using English orthography (e.g., syl-la-ble) and with a period when transcribing in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). For presentation purposes, typographers may use an interpunct, or a special-purpose \"hyphenation point\".\n\nAt the end of a line, a word is separated in writing into parts conventionally called \"syllables\" if it does not fit and if moving it to the next line would make the first line much shorter than the others. This can be a particular problem with very long words. Word processing has automated the process of justification, making syllabification of shorter words often superfluous.\n\nCray Inc., a subsidiary of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, is an American supercomputer manufacturer headquartered in Seattle, Washington. It also manufactures systems for data storage and analytics. Several Cray supercomputer systems are listed in the TOP500, which ranks the most powerful supercomputers in the world. Cray manufactures its products in part in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, where its founder, Seymour Cray, was born and raised. The company also has offices in Bloomington, Minnesota (which have been converted to Hewlett Packard Enterprise offices), and numerous other sales, service, engineering, and R&D locations around the world. In 1972, the company's predecessor, Cray Research, Inc. (CRI), was founded by computer designer Seymour Cray. In 1989, Seymour Cray formed Cray Computer Corporation (CCC), which went bankrupt in 1995. In 1996, Cray Research was acquired by Silicon Graphics (SGI). In 2000, Cray Inc. was formed when Tera Computer Company purchased the Cray Research Inc. business from SGI and adopted the name of its acquisition. In 2019, the company was acquired by Hewlett Packard Enterprise for $1.3 billion."
