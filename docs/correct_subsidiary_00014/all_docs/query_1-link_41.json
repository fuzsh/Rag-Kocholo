        "text": "Let me be the first to say, SGI's new look completely sucks.\n\nI, and everyone Ive talked to agree that was a horrible mistake.\n\nSGI, your target market was advanced computing audiences.\n\nWe have long held SGI as the high-end masters. The ones that realize that\n\ndesign and visualization is an integral part of computing. The name \"Silicon\n\nGraphics\" wields authority, its familiar and powerful. The chrome 3D logo\n\nhas long been a symbol of exactly what the machines are capable of.\n\nThat's now changed.\n\nWelcome, the new SGI. The new SGI name, and the new \"sgi\" logo that brings\n\nthem down to the childrens level. It kills me to see youve cast aside your\n\nlongtime expert image in favor of a look that is in line with the Apple iMac\n\nand the Dodge Neon. Set aside your aire of elite, and instead turn to the\n\nsimplistic, the clownish.\n\nWhat a mistake.\n\nWith your dying UNIX legacy, and your underperforming RISC hardware we all\n\nwere saddened to see Silicon Graphics fade away. We all reluctantly turned\n\nto the NT world to stay in business. For a brief time my collegues and I had\n\nour hope re-inspired, SGI entered the market with a new breed of powerful,\n\ndominating NT Workstations. Workstations that demanded respect. They would\n\nbring thier vision, thier expertise, thier power, and thier look to the\n\nworld of animators and visulization experts once again. The Visual\n\nWorsktation - the first Silicon Graphics NT machine to bear the well-known\n\n3D logo reinspires us to own the best.\n\nOr so we thought.\n\nThe two strongest things Silicon Graphics had going for it was thier name,\n\nand thier look. Undeniably, you could DO things on an SGI that you couldnt\n\non any other machine, just by looking at them you knew this. Those last two\n\nsteadfast defining qualities of Silicon Graphics have just went the way of\n\nApple. SGI now looks to align themselves with the iMac. Expert traded in for\n\n\"easy to use\". Visionary traded in for \"daily driver\". Advanced traded in\n\nfor \"simplistic\".\n\nThats what this world needs, another Packard Bell.\n\nMuch like the logo, what once was very capital, is now all \"lower case\".\n\nIf indeed your target market has changed. If indeed your trying to butter up\n\nto the low-budget college kids, the housewife chat-a-holics, the\n\none-mouse-buttoners out there, then congratulations - youve probably entered\n\nthe market as a big hit.\n\nI know all us, real workstation users, all us CAD/CAM professionals, all use\n\nGIS and Visualization experts, all us Simulation designers are sad to see\n\nyou go. I used to be proud to have a granite textured monitor, with a thick\n\nchrome 3D Silicon Graphics logo dead center. I wont be proud to have a\n\ntranslucent toaster with a cheaply screenprinted, white lettering \"sgi\" on\n\nthe bottom corner. But maybe my little brother will.\n\nIs this sappy? Yes. Is this probably over-dramatized? Yes.\n\nHowever, does the look of a company have an effect on who buys thier\n\nhardware? You better believe it. And I think you just upset alot of people,\n\nand most likely those were the people that bought from you.\n\nBad idea.\n\nRM\n\n\n\n\n\nAggghhh. I just checked the page in question. That new image is not ugly,\n\nIT IS PAINFUL TO WATCH. I thought the NT feecees were their ugliest thing\n\nyet, until I checked their new logo. Oh, my god! I have seen kids in\n\nkindergarten making better logos. Unbelieveable.\n\nWhat was wrong with the Silicon Graphics brand name. As far as I was\n\nconcerned it was a recognizable brand name, and the 3d cube logo was quite\n\nclever. As the old saying goes, \"if it ain't broke don't fix it'.\n\nWhe a CEO is willing to spend so much money in a stupid piece of crap like\n\nthe new logo, it pretty much tells us that he has no idea what the heck is\n\ngoing on. If SGI had invested the money and resources that has wasted on\n\nthe NT machine and the new logo, in renovating its Irix offerings, they\n\nwould be back on their feet. Oh, well.....\n\nThen I searched on Mr. Belluzzo's background. And to my surprise this\n\nfellow has a bachelor's degree in accounting. And then it all made sense.\n\nAnd nitwit with a degree in accounting trying to direct an engineering\n\ncompany. That dude is probably making more money than most PhDs within SGI\n\ncombined. And SGIs website seems to be a shrine to his persona. 'Keynote'\n\nspeech at comdex. This is pretty much what does it for me, an accounting\n\nmoron trying to give a keynote speech on technology. With statements like:\n\n' The talk will center around how technology too often gets in the way of\n\ntoday's urgent need for solving problems and how visualization is the road\n\nto insight.\", I love this other one \"In a very real sense, technology has\n\ncreated as many problems as it has solved. Although technical advances\n\nwill continue to simplify and standardize computing,\" So if technical\n\nadvances have made things harder to deal with, how come they made\n\ncomputing simpler? Can anyone tell me what the hell he is talking about?\n\nClearly he is letting us know how he is technology challenged.... but then\n\nagain, why is he directing a technology company? Are the stock holders\n\ngoing to do anything about this? I want to know the state of SGI before\n\nand after this guy took over.... sgi.... maybe they should change their\n\nletters altogether, here is my new logo: R.I.P.\n\n--\n\nFrancisco J.

I was thinking the same exact thing. The prestige is gone.\n\nI don't agree. A vast proportion of SGI users already refer to the\n\ncompany as SGI (I do), but far too many business-oriented people haven't\n\nconsidered SGI for servers because of the name 'Silicon Graphics'. You\n\ndon't believe me? Check any issue of Information Week. All they ever talk\n\nabout when discussing 64bit computing is Sun, HP, IBM and SCO; never SGI,\n\neven though SGI adverts are found in the magazine, and SGI currently\n\noffers the most scalable 64bit OS available.\n\nSGI needed a brand rethink. The server market is very important to the\n\ncompany and that was not being served by the 'Silicon Graphics' name in\n\nthe modern market place (were you actually not aware of this? It was\n\nobvious to me 2 years ago). For far too long, reporter after reporter\n\nin the media starts an article about SGI by referring to them as 'the\n\ncompany made famous for its ground-breaking effects in Jurassic Park'.\n\nEven yesterday, some reporters covering the name-change used exactly this\n\nkind of wording which is precisely why SGI has made the change. See:\n\nhttp://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,35022,00.html?tt.yfin..txt.ni\n\nOne probably won't see short term effects, but in the long term the\n\nbusiness market and customers who desire servers will turn to SGI more\n\nand more because they won't be put off by the inaccurate visual-effects\n\nand graphics-oriented image used by the media. You may not think this is\n\nimportant, but it *is* important to SGI's future. Half their revenue\n\ncomes from the server business. In fact, when SGI first started selling\n\nweb servers, the revenue rocketed to $400M in the first year alone!\n\n> ... The\n\n> highly respectable, highly elite Silicon Graphics is now dead. ...\n\nThis is a really stupid statement. The company is still there, the\n\nproducts are still there, the future plans are still there. It was the\n\nelitism which was harming SGI in recent years. I can clearly remember,\n\nback in 1994, a poster on this newsgroup (PC user) asking what an SGI\n\nwas; the response from an SGI employee: \"If you don't know, you can't\n\nafford one.\" At the time, it was funny, but now it just seems stupid\n\nand snobbish.\n\nI already call the company 'SGI' and so do vast numbers of others (I\n\nbet you do too). SGI is much more than a graphics company now and that\n\nmust be recognised. Personally, I find most of the longer articles I\n\nwrite these days are about the scalable technology of Cray, Origin and\n\nIRIX, not the graphics topics which can be covered via online info\n\nand existing tech report data.\n\n> ... Aside from that,\n\n> the new look is HORRIBLE. Besides, what they claim \"sgi\" stands for doesn't\n\n> even make sense. ...\n\nMakes sense to me. Servers, graphics, insight.

Who is going to want to pronounce it \"Servers, Graphic\n\n> Workstations, Insights\". Lame. They screwed up badly!\n\nIt's only typical that gfx-oriented people are going to moan about\n\nthe change, but the fact is that SGI must now begin to appeal to a\n\nmuch wider audience. If you look closely at the other web pages such\n\nas the O2 page, the individual letters are used in the background. In\n\nthe long term, this will be important for brand identity and corporate\n\nawareness.\n\nIf there was a real fear at all amongst people like myself, it was that\n\nthe name would be changed to something *completely* different like\n\n\"Silicon Computing\", losing the link with SGI's heritage and technical\n\nlead in graphics design altogether. That hasn't happened, for which I\n\ncheer them loudly. My original world view of SGI (5 years ago) was that\n\nthey were indeed a graphics-focussed company because my first exposure\n\nto their technology was an Onyx RE2, then an Indigo2 Extreme, and then\n\nan Indy. But not anymore. Researching all their products and services\n\nreveals a company targeting a far wider audience, offering (IMO) the\n\nmost advanced server technology in the world (go read all the docs on\n\nBlue Mountain).\n\nThe Onyx2 is still the Onyx2. The Origin is still the Origin. Octane is\n\nstill Octane, IRIX is still the wonderfully scalable and reliable IRIX,\n\netc. And all the praise I could throw at SGI for designing such high-\n\nquality systems is still to hand. If you seriously think that a name\n\nchange somehow takes away from that, then you're contradicting your\n\nstated original faith in the technology that SGI has developed.\n\nStop being so gfx-focused. There's much more to modern markets than\n\npolygons.

Bitter\n\nUNIX admin and consultant, MCSE, BOFH\n\n\"Collect the iMac, get the entire\n\ncollection with your happymeal!\"\n\nTime for me to speak.\n\nI'm with everyone else here when it has been expressed that the old logo\n\nwill be missed.\n\nThere's where we part company.\n\nFor some inexplicable reason, even though I've recommended (and will\n\ncontinue to recommend) SGIs as high-performance server or visual computing\n\nsolutions, I didn't really care what the logo looked like. I don't buy\n\nmachines for their logos, I buy them for what's inside the box. I've\n\nnever even bought computers because of the color of the box their\n\ncompnents are housed in, as the lack of iMacs in my lab will attest (I do\n\nown a PowerBook 1400, dark grey, and an SMP Apple 8500 PowerMac,\n\nplatinum).\n\nHow does it hurt a company to provide a bit of lip service to those that\n\ncontrol the flow of money in the current economy? *Of course* it doesn't\n\nmatter if a logo and a name are changed for a corporation. *Of course*\n\nit's just repackaging what is essentially the same thing, through and\n\nthrough, and of course it is purely for the benefit of appearances.\n\nBut I've been seeing a lot of nonsense on Slashdot and these newsgroups\n\nabout how SGI is now finally utterly tootally stupidly doomed and is now\n\ngoing out of business for sure and their 5-billion dollar a year upward\n\nspiral will suddenly completely reverse itself and plummet the company\n\ninto bankruptcy within a fortnight.\n\nBring me a loaf of *real* bread to the table, please. It's not a total\n\nrebranding (Borland-Inprise), and I've never heard anyone else call SGI\n\nanything other than SGI *anyway*, so the name change is merely bringing\n\nthe name of the firm in line with what people call it anyway. (Even Bill\n\nAmend, creator of Foxtrot, writing for a largely a mainstream,\n\nnot-necessarily computer-literate audience, calls 'em SGIs in his strip,\n\nnot Silicon Graphics UNIX workstations.)\n\nOr weren't you aware that acronyms cannot be trademark-protected under\n\ncurrent patent and trademark law in the US?\n\nSome of these people have been making the fortnight bankruptcy prediction\n\nat least since 1995. But when diehard supporters start making these\n\nsuppositions, I wonder what you're all smoking.\n\nI like the new logo (but then, I am rather fond of type in general, that\n\nbeing whence I came). Maybe not as much as the old one, but I admit to\n\nnot caring what SGI is called so long as I can still call it SGI.\n\nSay whatever you want, but they're still here, they're still growing, and\n\nthey're still the best solution right now for the kinds of problems I\n\nstill need solved. Logos don't change the reality of the situation all\n\nthat much.\n\n--\n\nScott Elyard ~~~ooOOoo~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|\n\n| Peregrinus expectavi pedes meos in cymbalis est. |\n\n| sc...@SPAMLESSstonebug.net |\n\n^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~'\n\nIn article <iAtR2.2$Yy4...@news.uswest.net>, \"RenderMan\" <n...@one.com> wrote:\n\n> What youre effectively saying is that you dont think corporate image\n\n> matters.\n\n>\n\n> \"I didn't really care what the logo looked like.

What's valid are things like OS, features,\n\nperformance, and service.\n\nAs to my being ignorant about the importance of logos, I'd say you're\n\nwrong there, if for no other reason than I never said the logo *wasn't*\n\nimportant. I just said it wasn't *that* important, and certainly not\n\nimportant enough to wind up getting all bent out of shape.\n\nI *do* appreciate the issues of corporate identity and so on. But even\n\nso, nothing has changed that much: the name, and the logo. That's it.\n\nUltimately, this is strictly cosmetic, and will only matter to those who\n\nonly see SGI as a vendor of gfx workstations, not a supercomputer or\n\nserver vendor.\n\nI don't necessarily think I'm a bad example, either. While I might\n\nfrequently urge people to do research before they plop any part of their\n\nbudget into a computer (or a car or a hamster cage or an ant farm), I\n\nsuspect the sort of thinking I do is actually the way many people do buy\n\ncomputers.\n\nRe: Coke's logo. Since I can scarcely taste any difference in most\n\ncolas, I buy what's on sale, like most people who buy soda. I don't spend\n\nmoney on Coke because they had a prettier (subjective) logo than Pepsi or\n\nSafeway brand.\n\nRe: SGI does indeed make servers and supercomputers. It is a part of the\n\naudience they want to hold. How is it an oxymoron to change the name of\n\nthe company to abstract it from the relatively nichie\n\ngfx-workstation-vendor-only perception?\n\nFurther, complaining strictly here isn't likely to do much good. Another\n\nposter has already suggested issuing a more formal (hopefully polite)\n\nrepsonse to Belluzzo himself, and then sabotaged it by stating that doing\n\nso will get nothing.\n\nIf that's how you feel, why open your mouth here at all in the first\n\nplace? If you believe that your opinion is only relevant in this\n\nnewsgroup or on slashdot, basically forums few CEOs (unsurprisingly)\n\neschew, how can you possibly express any valid cynicism on the irrelevance\n\nof complaining?\n\nOr, to make my point lucidly:\n\nA show of hands please: how many of you actually believe Belluzzo reads\n\nthis newsgroup?\n\nA show of hands please: how many of you think that complaining here will\n\ndo any good?\n\nA show of hands please: how many of you will be unsurprised if nothing changes?\n\nFrom thence comes my own cynicism.\n\n\n\nIn article <LCKR2.222$HP5....@news.uswest.net>, \"RenderMan\" <n...@one.com> wrote:\n\n>\n\n> RM\n\n>\n\n> P.S.

I think it is pretty funny how employees from the company\n\nformely known as Silicon Graphics rush trying to give any kind of\n\njustification, to their company's sequence of disasterous decissions in\n\nthe past few years. I am pretty sure that if Mr. Belluzzo had opted to\n\nchange the Silicon Graphics\n\nto F*CK in bold 80 point hot pink letters, there would be people trying to\n\nexplain how much sense the new change actually does.\n\nSilicon Graphics last worry was their logo or identity. After all it is\n\njust a name, and the fact that they concentrate so many resources in an\n\nunecessary change is a blatant proof of a company without much directior\n\nor 'insight' (how ironic). Maybe too many heads in the marketing dept were\n\nidle since they were not doing their job: sell systems, and decided to\n\nhave some fun. But these same people never stop and looked around and saw\n\nhow come some of their most important rival's names are even less related\n\nto high performance computing, lets compare:\n\nSGI: Silicon Graphics Computer Systems Inc. (silicon, graphics & computer)\n\nHP : Hewlett-Packard (?????)\n\nSUN: Stanford University Network. (Network)\n\nIntel (??????)\n\nCompaq: (??????)\n\nDell : (??????)\n\nAnd I don't see HP nor SUN dropping their logos. What about apple, what is\n\nthere in that name that says 'fast easy to use personal computers'? Yet,\n\neven when they were in their worst quarter, I never saw a report from\n\nApple's execs blaming the bad performance of their company on the fact\n\nthat the logo of their company was the shilouette of a bitten multicolored\n\napple (speaking of logos that have to\n\nbe printed in monochrome....). Or when people buy a BMW little do they now\n\nthat the blue and white divided circle represents the propeller of a\n\nplane. Or why would anyone buy a japanese computer. Is there anything in\n\nthe Fujitsu name that says 'servers and supers'? (NEC or hitachi for that\n\nmatter). Or what about the name Compaq, or Dell, do they say \"peecee\"? In\n\nfact if you look at some of the most sucessful companies in the industry,\n\ntheir names have little if anything to do with their activity, it is after\n\nall just a name. And same goes for corporate logos. The 3D cube was open\n\nto interpretation. Not everyone was required to see a 3D cube, maybe some\n\nshaw 3D pipes (the geomery engine pipeline concept). Some shaw 3 arrows\n\ncomming together, or a futuristic flower... whatever. The fact is that it\n\nwas a recognized symbol. Art is left to be interpreted, it can not be\n\ndefined, it has to be felt. And that is what the 3D cube was, it was one\n\nof the most clever, stream lined and elegant corporate emblems that boring\n\ncorporate America had. And they throw it away, why? I just don't get it.\n\nThat is why I usually enjoy European corporate identity a bit more. Lots\n\nof corporations over there have logos that are abstract paints, it doesn't\n\nhave to mean anything is just art for art. Something that just looks good,\n\nor different, there is not a single guideline that especifies what\n\neveryone has to see when they see that logo, it means different things to\n\ndifferent people, yet they all relate that\n\npersonal image with the company that uses it. In fact I didn't know what\n\nthe heck that think next to Silicon Graphics in the machines I saw was.\n\nAnd that is why that logo stayed longer than most of the 20000000 I have\n\nbeen exposed in my life, because I had to spend time thinking about that\n\ncrazy shape.\n\nJeez, and now SGI people are insulting my intelligence because they seem to\n\nthink that I am unable to remember four words. It is just a succession of\n\ndissasters after another: Release a PC with non standard architecture,\n\nwith drivers not even close to spec (I still remember the guy that came to\n\ndemo the NT feecees and all he did was saying... \"well when the drivers\n\nare ready\". Not very professional). Drop MIPS, then revive MIPS again. Got\n\nto bed with intel and Microsoft. Drop Cray's name, drop Silicon\n\nGraphics.... and what is the result?\n\nSGI... yet even after I saw their explanation... I don't even remeber what\n\nthis sgi stands for'something something insight'? .... and this is why a\n\nperson with an accounting degree should not be allowed to ruin I meant run\n\nan engineering company.\n\n\n\nJavi wrote:\n\n> SGI: Silicon Graphics Computer Systems Inc.

Not some acronym. `HP' is firmly implanted in the brain\n\nas `Hewlett-Packard' (names).\n\nSo `SGI' is a problem. Either it means nothing (as bad as ACME), or it's\n\nan acronym (less personal, but better than ACME). If it's an acronym,\n\neven if `insight' has always been around in the SGI marketing literature,\n\nand indeed it identifies the mission of the company, it sounds too much\n\nlike marketbabble and vapor. From a mass-market perspective, it would\n\nbe much better for SGI to mean Servers, Graphics, and Internet (what's\n\nmore scalable than SGI for your web servers? 4Dwm was also the\n\nfirst web-enabled desktop. VRML. Streaming).\n\nRegarding the logo. You've explained very well how logos work. A good\n\nlogo is a _very_ difficult thing to come by, and the `cube' is just brilliant (can\n\nyou also see the `S' and the `G'?). The thing is so good that it would be a pity\n\nto just use it for the `Silicon Graphics' line (and then it would only serve a\n\nnostalgic purpose).\n\nThe `sgi' must appear on all products. While having just the `cube' with `sgi' below\n\non generic literature/products would be _the_ thing, you have to thing how you would\n\nput combine those coherently on a machine so that it's not confusing, eg:\n\ncube Slicon Graphics O2\n\nsgi\n\nBut a satisfactory way might exist.\n\nNow, this seems be another `dubious graphic/industrial design' issue, eg:\n\nBeige monitors: `I thought color perception was important to SGI. At least the front\n\npanel should be black'\n\nIndigo II: `That's _too_ green. It hurts my eyes to put it on the desk.'\n\nIndy: `You _don't_ put a monitor on a computer (no way I'm using a 17 incher)'.\n\nMosaic era: `Yuck, those SGI web pages look too cheesy (and are a waste of\n\nbandwitdh)'.\n\nGranite keyboards: `What a silly idea. That makes harder see the lettering (not\n\neverybody touch-types 100%)'\n\n--\n\nFernando D.
