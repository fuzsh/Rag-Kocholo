In late January, the company surprised other computer makers with new machines that rival the power of Cray Research Inc.'s supercomputers. That helped push its stock to an all-time high of 33. In February, the company leaped into the media spotlight when President Bill Clinton and Vice-President Al Gore used a visit to its Mountain View (Calif.) headquarters to kick off their national technology initiative. And the company's 3-D graphics workstations, which have been creating movie special effects since The Abyss in 1987, played a key role in creating Steven Spielberg's upcoming Jurassic Park. SGI machines will even appear in scenes of the modern-day dinosaur tale.\n\nBut none of this may be as important as what Silicon Graphics still has on its calendar. Before the year is out, Chairman James H. Clark and Chief Executive Edward R. McCracken expect to position SGI squarely in the middle of what could prove to be a huge new market. As computers, communications, consumer electronics, and digital media converge, cable-TV operators and phone companies are planning information superhighways to carry digitized movies, interactive games, video phone calls, and on-line shopping. These \"digital media\" services will require powerful computers called servers to store reams of digitized data as well as technology to reproduce graphic images on TV screens."
