BUSINESS\n\nGENERAL\n\nSilicon Graphics provides computing solutions that range from cost-\n\neffective high performance desktop workstations to database and compute servers\n\nto Cray Research supercomputers. The Company's systems enhance the productivity\n\nof organizations engaged in technical, scientific, corporate and entertainment\n\napplications across a wide range of industries.\n\nSilicon Graphics' Cray Research subsidiary, acquired in fiscal 1996,\n\nprovides supercomputing tools and services to help solve customers' most\n\nchallenging problems. Another subsidiary, MIPS Technologies, designs the\n\nindustry-leading MIPS-Registered Trademark- RISC microprocessor. The Company\n\nlicenses its designs to semiconductor partners, who manufacture MIPS\n\nmicroprocessors for use in the computer, embedded control and consumer\n\nmarkets. The Company's Alias|Wavefront subsidiary provides innovative\n\nanimation and advanced modeling software for entertainment and industrial\n\napplications.\n\nCORE TECHNOLOGIES\n\nThe Company's strategy has been to identify and to invest heavily in the\n\nkey technologies that will enable it to set the pace of innovation. With\n\nrespect to these core elements, the Company's objective is to have the world's\n\nleading technology and to be the first to deliver that technology in new\n\nproducts. This approach has given Silicon Graphics a clear strategic focus and\n\nhas allowed it to obtain high productivity from its research and development\n\ninvestment. With respect to the other, non-core elements required to develop\n\nits products, the Company seeks to form strategic relationships with leading\n\nsuppliers worldwide.\n\nThe Company's core technologies are:\n\nGRAPHICS Leading graphics performance has been a distinguishing\n\ncharacteristic of Silicon Graphics' products since its inception. The\n\nCompany's systems use its proprietary dedicated graphics subsystems, which\n\nnot only provide strong graphics capability but also improve overall system\n\nperformance by freeing up the central microprocessor for other tasks. These\n\nsubsystems, such as the Onyx-TM- InfiniteReality-TM- and Indigo2 Impact-TM-\n\nfamily of graphics subsystems, perform complex functions that allow the user\n\nto render, display and manipulate realistic 3D objects and images in real\n\ntime. In addition, Silicon Graphics has developed the OpenGL-Registered\n\nTrademark-, an application programming interface (API) that evolved from the\n\nCompany's IRIS GL-TM- API and has become an industry standard for developing\n\n2D and 3D graphics applications. The OpenGL API is controlled by an\n\nindependent architecture review board that governs its direction and is\n\nlicensed to more than 30 leading companies, including all of the principal\n\nUNIX-Registered Trademark- workstation manufacturers.\n\nRISC MICROPROCESSORS The acquisition of MIPS Computer Systems in 1992 gave\n\nthe Company ownership of what it believes to be the industry's leading reduced\n\ninstruction set computing (RISC) technology, and the Company continues to devote\n\nsubstantial resources to extending this technology. Since 1992, the Company and\n\nits semiconductor partners have developed and introduced several new families of\n\nMIPS RISC microprocessors optimized for use in products ranging from consumer\n\nelectronic products to high-performance supercomputers.\n\nSCALABLE COMPUTING The ability to build computer systems that use more\n\nthan one processor without major changes in applications software has been an\n\nimportant factor in the performance of the Company's systems, particularly for\n\nthe technical and scientific markets. This multiple CPU design optimizes the\n\nperformance of a single application or maximizes system throughput when handling\n\nmany applications or users at one time. Silicon Graphics' substantial\n\ninvestments in symmetric multiprocessing since the late 1980s have enabled it to\n\nbecome the leading supplier of low and midrange supercomputers. The acquisition\n\nof Cray Research in 1996 has enhanced the Company's capability to deliver large\n\nmultiprocessing systems involving hundreds of processors.\n\nDIGITAL MEDIA Digital media integrates 3D graphics, animation and text\n\nwith video, audio and video conferencing capabilities. The Company believes\n\nthat digital media technology delivers a fundamentally better way to work and\n\ncommunicate, especially in a networked computing environment enabling\n\ncooperative work in real-time. Examples include \"collaborative engineering\",\n\nwhere engineers in different countries share visual information and work\n\nconcurrently on 3D models and designs.\n\nCOMPUTER SYSTEM PRODUCTS\n\nThe Company's computer systems range from desktop workstations to servers\n\nand supercomputers. All of these systems (other than the current Cray Research\n\nproduct families) are designed around MIPS RISC microprocessors developed by MTI\n\nand the IRIX-TM- operating system, which is the Company's enhanced version of\n\nthe System V Release 4 (SVR4) UNIX operating system. The IRIX operating system\n\nincludes the Indigo Magic-TM- user environment, a complete family of tools\n\nincluding desktop utilities, digital media applications and collaborative tools.\n\nBecause of their common microprocessor and operating system technology, the\n\nCompany's systems generally are binary-compatible, meaning that software\n\napplications run without modification across the entire product line.\n\nDESKTOP SYSTEMS\n\nSilicon Graphics desktop workstations combine key elements of workgroup\n\ncollaboration, interactive media and computing at a range of prices and\n\nperformance. Systems in this family can be used for tasks as diverse as\n\nmanipulating 3D models for computer-aided design (CAD), crunching numbers for\n\nchemistry and geographic information systems applications, or functioning as a\n\ntool for video editing, animation rendering, technical publishing, World Wide\n\nWeb and intranet authoring and serving, and software development.\n\nINDY The Indy-TM- family of entry-level desktop workstation features\n\nadvanced 3D graphics and imaging, real-time video capability and interactive and\n\nprofessional quality graphics, audio and imaging capabilities. The Indy has\n\nsignificant appeal in markets such as mechanical CAD, chemistry, color\n\npublishing, film and video, software development, education and media authoring.\n\nINDIGO(2) The Indigo(2)-TM- family of workstations is designed to\n\nprovide the strongest graphics and computational capability available in the\n\ndesktop category, for applications such as 3D solids modeling, mechanical\n\nCAD, digital prototyping, 3D visualization, animation, architectural design\n\nand professional audio and video production.\n\nWEBFORCE The WebFORCE-TM- family of computer systems, one of the first\n\nproduct lines for creating and serving content for the World Wide Web,\n\nintegrates hardware and software for professional Web content authoring and\n\ncommercial Web serving, and includes Indy and Indigo(2) Impact desktop systems\n\nas well as Challenge-Registered Trademark- servers.\n\nHIGH END SYSTEMS\n\n-2-\n\nONYX This family of graphics supercomputers uses multiple microprocessors\n\nand sophisticated graphics subsystems to handle the most demanding visual\n\ncomputing tasks. Graphics subsystems available with the Onyx systems\n\ninclude the InfiniteReality and Reality Engine(2)-TM- graphics subsystems. The\n\nOnyx family is well-suited for applications such as computational chemistry, oil\n\nand gas research, molecular modeling, global weather modeling, structural\n\ndynamics, fluid dynamics, image processing, visual simulation, medical imaging\n\nand chemistry, interactive entertainment and digital film and video production.\n\nCHALLENGE The Challenge family of network resource servers includes a\n\nrange of capabilities, from single processor deskside systems used by small to\n\nmid-size workgroups up to systems employing dozens of processors and capable of\n\nsupporting enterprise-wide distributed computing environments. Challenge\n\nservers efficiently store, manage and move large amounts of audio, video and\n\ngraphics data as well as traditional databases and textual data for a wide range\n\nof commercial and other applications. Key uses include data mining (to analyze\n\nand organize database information), product data management for manufacturing,\n\nand commercial transaction processing. Challenge servers also are used as media\n\nservers, World Wide Web site servers and file servers.\n\nPOWER CHALLENGE The POWER Challenge-TM- family of supercomputing servers\n\ncombines low-cost, high-performance CMOS RISC technology, advanced parallel\n\nsystem architecture and a simple shared-memory programming model. Key\n\napplications in the technical and scientific markets include finite element\n\nanalysis (to determine the impact of elements like stress and temperature),\n\nquantum chemistry calculation, seismic analysis and computational fluid\n\ndynamics.\n\nCRAY RESEARCH PRODUCTS\n\nCray Research, founded in 1973 and acquired by the Company in 1996, is the\n\nworld's leading supplier of advanced supercomputers. Cray Research has\n\ncontinued as a separate division of Silicon Graphics focused on the high end of\n\nthe supercomputing market. Cray Research is working closely with the Silicon\n\nGraphics advanced systems division to develop and introduce over the next\n\nseveral years an integrated family of highly scalable systems that will\n\neventually cover the full range from affordable deskside servers to the world's\n\nmost powerful supercomputers.\n\nThe CRAY T90-TM- family of supercomputers deliver maximum performance for\n\nvectorized supercomputing applications. The large memory bandwidth of T90\n\nsystems make them ideal for problems involving huge amounts of data, such as\n\nweather and climate modeling and large-scale auto engineering.\n\nThe CRAY J90-TM- family uses low-cost CMOS technology to deliver affordable\n\nsupercomputing for vectorized applications like molecular modeling, ecosystem\n\nsimulation, medical imaging and vehicle dynamics simulation.\n\nThe CRAY T3E-TM- highly scalable supercomputing systems employ a massively\n\nparallel architecture ranging from 16 to as many as 2,048 processors for a\n\nbroad range of scientific and industrial applications as diverse as petroleum\n\nexploration, aerospace enginering and traffic system simulation.\n\nMIPS RISC MICROPROCESSORS\n\nAll of the Company's system products (other than the current Cray Research\n\nfamilies) incorporate the MIPS RISC microprocessor architecture. The Company's\n\nMIPS RISC microprocessor designs incorporate a general purpose architecture and\n\ninstruction set designed for high performance over a wide range of applications.\n\nThe MIPS RISC microprocessor designs make efficient use of instruction\n\n\"pipelining\" techniques and proprietary compilers, allowing significant\n\nperformance gains to be realized by optimizing the tradeoff between compiler and\n\nmicroprocessor functions. The versatility of the MIPS\n\n-3-\n\nRISC architecture makes it suitable for computer applications from entry-level\n\ndesktop systems up to supercomputers.\n\nMIPS RISC microprocessors are also used in a wide variety of noncomputer\n\napplications, including disk drives, printers and copiers and, increasingly,\n\nconsumer electronics products. Silicon Graphics computers represent only a\n\nsmall percentage of the worldwide consumption of MIPS RISC microprocessors.\n\nThe Company does not manufacture or sell MIPS RISC microprocessors and\n\nrelated devices. It licenses its designs to \"semiconductor partners\" who\n\nmanufacture and sell the parts. The Company's current licensees are:\n\nIntegrated Device Technology, Inc.; LSI Logic Corporation; NEC Corporation; NKK\n\nCorporation; Philips Semiconductor; and Toshiba Corporation. Each semiconductor\n\npartner paid an initial license fee at the beginning of the license period and\n\npays unit royalties based upon sales.\n\nAPPLICATIONS SOFTWARE\n\nBecause the Company has historically developed only a very limited set of\n\napplications software, its customers must either develop or license from a third\n\nparty the software necessary to address their needs. The Company maintains\n\nactive programs to encourage independent software development for its systems,\n\nincluding training, technology support and cooperative marketing. The Company\n\nbelieves that there currently are over 2,000 registered application software\n\nprograms offered for use on its systems.\n\nThe Company's Alias|Wavefront division supplies modeling and animation\n\napplication software used by creative professionals in the entertainment,\n\nindustrial design and visualization and graphic design markets. Its industry-\n\nleading products include Alias PowerAnimator-TM-, Alias Studio-TM-, and\n\nWavefront Composer-TM-. Alias|Wavefront has also announced the next generation\n\nMaya-TM- product architecture, which will be incorporated in products beginning\n\nin fiscal 1997. Alias|Wavefront is based in Toronto, Canada with sales offices\n\nacross North America, Europe and Asia and worldwide distribution.\n\nIn fiscal 1996 the Company introduced the Cosmo-TM- family of content\n\ncreation, browsing and management tools for the World Wide Web and intranet\n\nmarkets. The Cosmo products are intended to facilitate the creation of media-\n\nrich three dimensional environments and especially to take advantage of the\n\npower of the industry standard Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML)\n\ndeveloped by Silicon Graphics.\n\nMARKETING, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION\n\nThe Company sells its products through its own direct sales force and\n\nthrough several indirect channels. In fiscal 1996 direct sales accounted for\n\napproximately half of the Company's product revenues. The direct sales and\n\nsupport organization operates throughout the United States and in all\n\nsignificant international markets. The Company serves smaller international\n\nmarkets through distributors.\n\nThe principal indirect channels through which the Company operates are the\n\nfollowing:\n\n_ VARS, or value added resellers, are software companies that develop\n\nor customize their proprietary software specifically for use with the\n\nspecial graphics hardware of the Company's workstations. VARs\n\npurchase workstations from the Company or its North American\n\ndistributor, incorporate their applications software and resell the\n\nsystems to end-users.\n\n_ VADS, or value added dealers, are typically direct sales\n\norganizations that sell primarily into a single vertical market and\n\nincorporate appropriate specialized third-party software with the\n\nCompany's hardware for sale to their customers.\n\n-4-\n\n_ OEM (\"original equipment manufacturer\") customers generally are\n\ncomputer systems vendors that customize applications software for use\n\non the Company's workstations and sell turnkey systems under the OEM's\n\nproduct name. OEMs also provide independent marketing, service and\n\nsupport programs to their customers. The Company's principal OEMs\n\ninclude Tandem Computers Incorporated and Siemens Nixdorf AG.\n\n_ SYSTEMS INTEGRATORS include Silicon Graphics systems in much larger\n\nsystems customized for use by the federal government and large\n\ncommercial clients.\n\nInformation with respect to international operations and export sales may\n\nbe found on page 60 of the 1996 Annual Report to Stockholders, which is\n\nincorporated herein by reference. See also \"Risks That Affect Our Business\"\n\nbelow. Although no customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company's total\n\nrevenues for fiscal 1996, 1995 or 1994, a significant reduction or delay in\n\nsales to major customers could adversely affect the Company's operating results.\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE AND SUPPORT\n\nThe Company believes that the quality and reliability of its system\n\nproducts and the ongoing support of such products are important elements of its\n\ncompetitive strategy. The Company's customer service organization includes\n\nfield service engineers, field product and applications specialists, product\n\nsupport engineers, training specialists and administrative support personnel.\n\nIn addition, the Company provides customer education through regularly scheduled\n\ncourses in system software administration, applications programming and hardware\n\nmaintenance. The Company provides local customer support from its regional\n\nsales and service offices located in North America, Western Europe and the\n\nPacific Rim, with spare parts inventory stored at each location. International\n\ndistributors provide training and support for products sold by them.\n\nThe Company typically provides a standard \"return to factory\" hardware\n\nwarranty against defects in materials and workmanship for periods of up to\n\none year.\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nThe Company's research and development program is directed principally\n\ntoward maintaining and enhancing the Company's competitive position through\n\nincorporating the latest advances in microprocessor, hardware, software and\n\nnetworking technologies. This effort is focused specifically on developing and\n\nenhancing its computing architectures, MIPS RISC microprocessors, graphics\n\nsubsystems, VLSI technology, compiler software, operating system, applications\n\nsoftware and development tools. Simultaneously, the Company seeks to develop\n\nnew ways in which to increase product reliability, reduce manufacturing costs\n\nand improve product development lead times.\n\nDuring fiscal 1996, 1995 and 1994, the Company spent approximately $353\n\nmillion, $248 million and $191 million, respectively, on research and\n\ndevelopment. Those amounts represented 12.1%, 11.1% and 12.4%, respectively, of\n\nrevenues.\n\nMANUFACTURING\n\nThe Company's manufacturing operations primarily involve assembling high\n\nlevel subassemblies and systems and testing major purchased subassemblies. All\n\nproducts are subjected to substantial environmental stress and electronic\n\ntesting prior to shipment to customers. The Company primarily manufactures and\n\nships its products from its main facility in Mountain View, California and the\n\nCray\n\n-5-\n\nResearch facility in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. The Company also has a European\n\nmanufacturing and support center near Neuchatel, Switzerland.\n\nThe Company continually evaluates the allocation of manufacturing\n\nactivities among the Company's own operations and those of suppliers and\n\nsubcontractors. This allocation may be affected by fluctuations in the volume\n\nof business, geopolitical, economic and technological developments and other\n\nfactors.\n\nThe Company attempts to utilize standard parts and components available\n\nfrom multiple vendors rather than to integrate its manufacturing operations\n\nvertically. The Company believes that there are a number of competent vendors\n\nfor most of the parts and components used in its system products. In certain\n\ncircumstances, despite the availability of multiple sources, the Company may\n\nselect a single source or a very limited number of sources in order to maintain\n\nquality or price control or to develop a more strategic relationship with the\n\nsupplier.\n\nReliance on single or limited source vendors involves several risks,\n\nincluding the possibility of a shortage of certain key components that meet the\n\nCompany's product specifications and reduced control over delivery schedules,\n\nmanufacturing yields, quality and costs. These issues tend to be especially\n\nacute in the early or \"ramp-up\" stage as the Company attempts to reach volume\n\nproduction of new products. In particular, the Company is dependent on a\n\nlimited number of semiconductor manufacturers with state of the art fabrication\n\nfacilities. During fiscal 1996, for example, the Company was dependent on a\n\nsingle supplier, NEC, for the great majority of its requirements of MIPS R10000\n\nmicroprocessors, a dependency that will continue through at least the first half\n\nof fiscal 1997 until a second source begins volume production. Other components\n\nfor which the Company currently does not have multiple sources include certain\n\napplication-specific integrated circuits (\"ASICs\"). These are currently\n\nobtained from IBM, LSI Logic, Motorola, VLSI Technology and Toshiba. Components\n\navailable from limited sources include floating point coprocessors and certain\n\nmemory circuits.\n\nThe Company also has single sources for certain peripherals, communications\n\ncontrollers and power supplies, and the monitors and plastic cabinets used\n\nacross the Company's system products. The Company believes that, in most of\n\nthese cases, alternative sources of supply could be developed over a period of\n\ntime. However, a reduction or interruption in supply or a significant increase\n\nin the price of one or more single or limited source components would, at least\n\nin the short term, adversely affect the Company's operating results.\n\nMany of the Company's suppliers are located outside the United States,\n\nespecially in Japan. The prices of parts from these suppliers have been and may\n\nbe affected significantly by such factors as protectionist measures and changes\n\nin currency exchange rates between the United States and other countries. In\n\naddition, changes in the availability of certain memory chips (DRAMs, SRAMs and\n\nVRAMs) have caused, and in the future may cause, significant changes in their\n\nprices.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nThe computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by rapid\n\ntechnological advances in both hardware and software development. These\n\nadvances result in frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles\n\nand increased new product capabilities, typically representing significant\n\nprice/performance improvements. The principal competitive factors in the\n\nCompany's market are product features, price/performance, networking\n\ncapabilities, product quality and reliability, ease of use, capabilities of the\n\nsystem software, availability of applications software, customer support,\n\nproduct availability, corporate reputation and price. The strong competition\n\nfaced throughout the Company's product line can result in significant\n\ndiscounting from list price.\n\n-6-\n\nThe Company's principal competition has historically come from other\n\nworkstation and computer system manufacturers and, to a lesser extent, from\n\ngraphics subsystem and terminal vendors and graphics integrated circuit\n\nmanufacturers. The principal workstation and computer manufacturers that\n\ncompete in the Company's markets are Digital Equipment, Hewlett Packard, IBM and\n\nSun Microsystems. The Company is facing increasing competition at the lowest\n\nend of the workstation market from systems based on personal computer\n\ntechnologies such as the Windows NT operating system, Intel microprocessors and\n\ngraphics acceleration cards.\n\nIn the high end of the supercomputer market, the Company faces competition\n\nfrom IBM as well as from NEC, Hitachi and Fujitsu. In the applications software\n\nmarket and certain other emerging markets the Company's principal competitor is\n\nMicrosoft.\n\nThe Company's MIPS RISC microprocessor architecture and technology compete\n\ndirectly with microprocessor products offered by manufacturers of other\n\nmicroprocessor designs, in particular those offered by IBM, Digital, HP, Intel,\n\nMotorola and Sun. Although the Company believes its RISC architecture offers\n\nadvantages over these other designs, some of these architectures have a larger\n\ninstalled base and wider availability of application software, which may\n\nadversely affect the adoption of the Company's RISC architecture.\n\nRISKS THAT AFFECT OUR BUSINESS\n\nSilicon Graphics operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a\n\nnumber of risks, some of which are beyond the Company's control. The following\n\ndiscussion highlights some of these risks.\n\nPERIOD TO PERIOD FLUCTUATIONS The Company's operating results may fluctuate for\n\na number of reasons. Other than in the Cray Research business, the Company has\n\nshort delivery cycles and as a result generally does not have a large order\n\nbacklog, which makes the forecasting of revenue inherently uncertain. This\n\nuncertainty is compounded because each quarter's revenue results predominantly\n\nfrom orders booked and shipped during the third month, and disproportionately in\n\nthe latter half of that month. Because the Company plans its operating\n\nexpenses, many of which are relatively fixed in the short term, on the basis\n\nthat its revenue will continue to grow, even a relatively small revenue\n\nshortfall may cause a period's results to be substantially below expectations.\n\nSuch a revenue shortfall could arise from any number of factors, including lower\n\nthan expected demand, supply constraints, delays in the availability of new\n\nproducts, transit interruptions, overall economic conditions or natural\n\ndisasters. The timing of customer acceptance of large Cray systems may also\n\nhave a significant effect on periodic operating results. Margins are heavily\n\ninfluenced by mix considerations, including geographical mix, the mix of service\n\nand non-recurring engineering revenue, the mix of high-end and desktop products\n\nand application software, as well as the mix of configurations within these\n\nproduct categories.\n\nThe Company's results have followed a seasonal pattern, with stronger sequential\n\ngrowth in the second and fourth fiscal quarters, reflecting the buying patterns\n\nof the Company's customers. Sales of Cray Research systems generally reflect\n\nsequential growth from quarter-to-quarter through the calendar year.\n\nThe Company's stock price, like that of other technology companies, is subject\n\nto significant volatility. If revenue or earnings in any quarter fail to meet\n\nthe investment community's expectations, there could be an immediate impact on\n\nthe Company's stock price. The stock price may also be affected by broader\n\nmarket trends unrelated to the Company's performance.\n\nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND INTRODUCTION The Company's continued success depends on\n\nits ability to develop and rapidly bring to volume production highly\n\ndifferentiated, technologically complex and innovative products. The Company\n\nplans to introduce several new product families in the first half of fiscal\n\n1997, including products that will replace virtually the entire current product\n\nline. A number of risks are inherent in this process.\n\n-7-\n\nThe development of new technology and products is increasingly complex and\n\nuncertain, which increases the risk of delays. The introduction of a new\n\ncomputer system requires close collaboration and continued technological\n\nadvancement involving multiple hardware and software design and manufacturing\n\nteams within the Company as well as teams at outside suppliers of key components\n\nsuch as semiconductor and storage products. The failure of any one of these\n\nelements could cause the Company's new products to fail to meet specifications\n\nor to miss the aggressive timetables that the Company establishes. As the\n\nvariety and complexity of the Company's product families increase, the process\n\nof planning production and inventory levels also becomes more difficult.\n\nShort product life cycles place a premium on the Company's ability to manage\n\nthe transition from current products to new products. In order to minimize\n\nproduct transition issues, the Company often announces new products in the\n\nearly part of a quarter, while the product is in the final stages of\n\ndevelopment, and seeks to manufacture and ship the product in volume in the\n\nsame quarter. In the case of the Cray Research product line, new products\n\nare generally announced well in advance of availability, due to the longer\n\nsales cycle for these systems. The Company's results could be adversely\n\naffected by such factors as development delays, quality or yield problems\n\nexperienced by suppliers, variations in product costs, and delays in customer\n\npurchases of existing products in anticipation of the introduction of new\n\nproducts. On September 25, 1996 the Company announced that its revenues for\n\nthe first quarter of fiscal 1997 would be only slightly higher than for the\n\nsame period in the prior year and that its net income for that period would\n\nbe materially below expectations. The results for the quarter are\n\nattributable, at least in part, to customer anticipation of new high-end and\n\ndesktop products that the Company plans to introduce in October 1996.\n\nCOMPETITION The computer industry is highly competitive, with rapid\n\ntechnological advances and constantly improving price/performance. As most of\n\nthe segments in which the Company operates continue to grow faster than the\n\nindustry as a whole, the Company is experiencing an increase in competition, and\n\nit expects this trend to continue. This competition comes not only from the\n\nCompany's traditional UNIX workstation rivals and Cray's traditional\n\nsupercomputing competitors, but also from new sources including the personal\n\ncomputer industry. In particular, during fiscal 1996 the Company experienced\n\nincreasing competition at the lowest end of its business from workstations based\n\nupon the Intel Pentium microprocessor, Microsoft's Windows NT operating system,\n\nand a variety of 3-D graphics acceleration cards. Many of the Company's\n\ncompetitors have substantially greater technical, marketing and financial\n\nresources and, in some segments, a larger installed base of customers and a\n\nwider range of available applications software. Competition can result in\n\nsignificant discounting and lower gross margins.\n\nVOLUME STRATEGY The Company believes that its long-term success is dependent\n\non achieving substantial increases in unit volumes over the next several\n\nyears. The Company has created a new business unit, the Silicon Desktop\n\nGroup, with the charter of implementing a comprehensive strategy for\n\nincreasing volumes of desktop products, including new product development,\n\ngreater emphasis on lower-cost manufacturing and the strengthening of\n\nindirect distribution channels. Risks associated with this strategy include:\n\n- increased direct competition with the personal computer industry,\n\nportions of which have been seeking to move upmarket to compete with\n\nlow-end workstations (see \"Competition\");\n\n- the impact of lower gross margins, to the extent not mitigated by\n\nsavings in distribution costs and other operating expenses; and\n\n- the extent to which the Company is able to adapt its manufacturing and\n\nservice philosophies to the demands of higher volumes and lower costs.\n\nACQUISITION OF CRAY RESEARCH The acquisition of Cray Research will require,\n\namong other things, integration of the Cray Research organization, business\n\ninfrastructure and product offerings with those of the Company in a way that\n\nenhances the performance of the combined business. The challenges posed by the\n\nacquisition include the management of a business with a different approach to\n\nproduct design, manufacturing and sales and service, the development of a\n\nconsolidated product road map from a number of incompatible products and the\n\nintegration of several geographically separated research and development\n\ncenters. The success of this process will be significantly influenced by the\n\nCompany's ability to retain key management, sales, and research and development\n\npersonnel. The integration process will\n\n-8-\n\nalso require the dedication of management resources, which may temporarily\n\ndistract attention from the day-to-day business of the Company.\n\nThere are several other aspects of Cray Research's business that are different\n\nfrom the Company's current business and may affect the operations of the\n\ncombined business:\n\n- Government agencies and research institutions represent a major\n\ncustomer group for Cray Research products. As a result of the\n\nacquisition, a greater percentage of the Company's revenue will be\n\nderived from sales to such customers, whose purchasing decisions may\n\nbe adversely affected by reductions or changes in government spending.\n\n- International sales of Cray Research's products are more likely to be\n\nsubject to export licensing constraints than international sales of\n\nthe Company's current products.\n\n- Cray Research derives most of its revenue from the sale of a small\n\nnumber of large systems, which generally have a longer sales cycle.\n\nRevenue for these systems is recognized at customer acceptance rather\n\nthan upon shipment. Cray Research's results for any period are\n\nsignificantly influenced by the number and mix of systems accepted and\n\nwhether a system is sold or leased. Changes affecting even a small\n\nnumber of systems can have significant financial implications.\n\n- At June 30, 1996, the combined Company's backlog was $572 million,\n\nrepresenting orders scheduled to ship during fiscal 1997. This\n\nbacklog primarily consists of orders for Cray Research T90 and T3E\n\nsystems, which only recently had their first commercial shipments.\n\nIMPACT OF GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS A significant portion of the Company's revenue\n\nis derived from sales to the U.S. government, either directly by the Company or\n\nthrough system integrators and other resellers. This proportion will increase\n\nas the result of the Cray Research acquisition. Sales to the government present\n\nrisks in addition to those involved in sales to commercial customers, including\n\npotential disruptions due to appropriation and spending patterns and the\n\ngovernment's reservation of the right to cancel contracts for its convenience.\n\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 1996, for example, the Company's results were\n\nadversely affected by purchasing slowdowns related to the federal government\n\nbudget impasse.\n\nGLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKET RISKS The Company's business and financial results are\n\naffected by fluctuations in world financial markets, including foreign currency\n\nexchange rates and interest rates. The Company's hedging policy attempts to\n\nmitigate some of these risks, based on management's best judgment of the\n\nappropriate tradeoffs among risk, opportunity and expense. The Company\n\nregularly reviews its overall hedging policies, and it continually monitors its\n\nhedging activities to ensure that they are consistent with policy and\n\nappropriate and effective in light of changing market conditions. Management\n\nmay as part of this review determine at any time to change its hedging policies.\n\nHowever, it is important to recognize that the Company's risk management\n\nactivities are not comprehensive, and that there can be no assurance that these\n\nprograms will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact\n\nresulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest\n\nrates.\n\nBecause more than half of the Company's revenue is from sales outside the United\n\nStates, and many key components are produced outside the United States, the\n\nCompany's results can be significantly affected by changes in foreign currency\n\nexchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the\n\nCompany distributes its products. The Company is primarily exposed to changes\n\nin exchange rates on the Swiss franc, British pound, Japanese yen, German mark\n\nand French franc. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies,\n\nthe value (as expressed in U.S. dollars) of non-U.S. dollar-based sales and\n\ncosts decrease. The opposite happens when the U.S. dollar weakens. Because\n\nthe Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, it\n\nbenefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar\n\nrelative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, a strengthening of the\n\nU.S. dollar tends to affect negatively the Company's revenue and gross margins.\n\n-9-\n\nTo mitigate the short-term impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates on the\n\nCompany's non-U.S. dollar-based sales and intercompany receivables, the Company\n\nregularly hedges certain of these net exposures. Historically, the Company has\n\nnot sought to hedge future revenues. However, as a result of the Cray Research\n\nacquisition, the Company is continuing Cray Research's policy of entering into\n\nforeign exchange forward contracts that hedge firmly committed Cray Research\n\nbacklog. Currently, these hedges extend through December 1999. Beginning in\n\nfiscal 1997, the Company also expects to hedge a portion of anticipated\n\nquarterly revenues from international operations. The Company utilizes foreign\n\ncurrency forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar intercompany receivables.\n\nThe Company has generally not hedged capital expenditures, investments in\n\nsubsidiaries or inventory purchases. However, because the Company procures\n\ninventory and its international operations incur expenses in local currencies,\n\nthe financial effects of fluctuations in the U.S. dollar values of non-U.S.\n\ndollar-based transactions frequently mitigate or tend to offset each other on a\n\nconsolidated basis.\n\nThe Company's interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in\n\nthe general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in U.S.\n\ninterest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash equivalents and\n\nmarketable investments as well as interest paid on its borrowings. To mitigate\n\nthe impact of fluctuations in U.S. interest rates, the Company has entered into\n\nan interest rate swap transaction intended to better match the Company's fixed\n\nrate interest expense on its zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures\n\nwith the floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and marketable\n\ninvestments.\n\nOTHER RISKS OF INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS The Company's results could also be\n\nnegatively affected by such factors as changes in trade protection measures,\n\nlonger accounts receivable collection patterns, or natural disasters. The\n\nCompany's sales to foreign customers also are subject to export regulations,\n\nwith sales of some of the Company's high-end products requiring clearance and\n\nexport licenses from the U.S. Department of Commerce. The Company's export\n\nsales would be adversely affected if such regulations were tightened, or if they\n\nare not modified over time to reflect the increasing performance of the\n\nCompany's products.\n\nMANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS The Company replaced its United States\n\ninformation management system in the third quarter of fiscal 1996 with a\n\ncomprehensive system used to manage the entire revenue cycle, including order\n\nadministration, billing and collection, as well as manufacturing and finance.\n\nThe Company expects that the system will provide operational efficiencies and\n\nsupport future growth. However, as the system has been in operation for a\n\nrelatively short period, there remains a risk of functional or performance\n\ndifficulties, particularly if the system is extended to the Company's\n\ninternational operations and to the Cray Research business.\n\nDEVELOPMENT AND ACCEPTANCE OF MIPS RISC ARCHITECTURE Most of the Company's\n\nsystem products incorporate microprocessors based upon the Company's MIPS\n\nRISC microprocessor architecture. The Company licenses the manufacturing and\n\ndistribution rights to these microprocessors to selected semiconductor\n\nmanufacturing companies. The Company believes that the continued development\n\nand broad acceptance of the MIPS architecture are critical to its future\n\nsuccess.\n\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY The Company routinely receives communications from third\n\nparties asserting patent or other rights covering the Company's products and\n\ntechnologies. Based upon the Company's evaluation, it may take no action or it\n\nmay seek to obtain a license. In any given case there is a risk that a license\n\nwill not be available on terms that the Company considers reasonable, or that\n\nlitigation will ensue. The Company currently has patent infringement lawsuits\n\npending against it. The Company expects that, as the number of hardware and\n\nsoftware patents issued continues to increase, and as the Company's business\n\ngrows, the volume of these intellectual property claims will also increase.\n\n-10-\n\nEMPLOYEES The Company's future success depends in part on its ability to\n\ncontinue to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified technical, marketing\n\nand management personnel, who are in great demand.\n\nBUSINESS DISRUPTION The Company's corporate headquarters, including most of its\n\nresearch and development operations and manufacturing facilities, are located in\n\nthe Silicon Valley area of Northern California, a region known for seismic\n\nactivity. Operating results could be materially affected by a significant\n\nearthquake. The Company is predominantly self-insured for losses and business\n\ninterruptions of this kind.\n\nPROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND LICENSES\n\nThe Company has been granted or has applications pending for a significant\n\nnumber of U.S. patents, and will continue to seek patent coverage for its\n\ninventions in both the United States and foreign countries. The Company also\n\nhas applied for and holds various trademark registrations in the United States\n\nand in selected foreign countries. The Company will continue to seek protection\n\nfor its inventions, trademarks, maskworks and copyrights where appropriate.\n\nAs is customary in its industry, the Company licenses from third parties a\n\nwide range of software for its internal use and for the use of its customers.\n\nThe Company licenses the UNIX operating system on a non-exclusive basis from\n\nNovell, Inc., and sublicenses it to its customers.\n\nThe Company's ability to compete may be affected by its ability to protect\n\nproprietary information and to obtain necessary licenses on commercially\n\nreasonable terms. The extent to which U.S. and international intellectual\n\nproperty laws protect the Company's products, and the enforceability of end-user\n\nlicense agreements, have not been fully determined, and the computer industry\n\nhas seen a substantial increase in litigation with respect to intellectual\n\nproperty matters. Such litigation or changes in the interpretation of\n\nintellectual property laws could expand or reduce the extent to which the\n\nCompany or its competitors are able to protect their intellectual property or\n\nrequire changes in the design of products which could have an adverse impact on\n\nthe Company. There can be no assurance that the Company will not be made a\n\nparty to litigation regarding intellectual property matters in the future. See\n\n\"Legal Proceedings.\"\n\nEMPLOYEES\n\nAs of June 30, 1996, the Company had approximately 10,485 full-time\n\nemployees. The Company's future success will depend, in part, on its ability to\n\ncontinue to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified technical, marketing\n\nand management personnel, who are in great demand. The Company has never had a\n\nwork stoppage, and no employees are represented by a labor union. The Company\n\nbelieves that its employee relations are good.\n\nCORPORATE DATA\n\nThe Company was originally incorporated as a California corporation in\n\nNovember 1981, and reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in January 1990.\n\nThe Company acquired MIPS Computer Systems, Inc. through a merger in June 1992,\n\nand acquired Alias Research Inc. and Wavefront Technologies, Inc. through\n\nmergers in June 1995. The Company recently acquired Cray Research, Inc.\n\nthrough a merger effective June 30, 1996.\n\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\n\nThe Company believes that, while it currently has or is developing\n\nsufficient facilities to conduct its operations during fiscal 1997, it will\n\ncontinue to acquire both leased and owned facilities throughout the world as its\n\nbusiness requires. The Company's corporate offices and its primary research and\n\n-11-\n\ndevelopment and manufacturing operations are located in Mountain View,\n\nCalifornia. The Company leases twelve adjacent buildings comprising a total of\n\napproximately 726,500 square feet under leases terminating during 2000 through\n\n2005. The Company owns 7.5 acres near its Mountain View headquarters, on which\n\na 112,000 square foot headquarters building for its sales organization was\n\ncompleted in fiscal 1995. The Company also leases sixteen other buildings near\n\nits Mountain View headquarters, comprising approximately 736,000 square feet.\n\nThe Company also has leased 22 acres of land near its other facilities in\n\nMountain View on which a four-building, 500,000 square foot general office\n\ncomplex is being constructed to be leased to the Company for occupancy in fiscal\n\n1997.\n\nAs a result of the acquisition of Cray Research, the Company also owns\n\nmanufacturing, research and development and service facilities comprising\n\napproximately 747,000 square feet in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin and\n\nmanufacturing, research and development, sales and administrative facilities\n\ncomprising 479,300 square feet in Eagan, Minnesota. The Company has vacated\n\nand intends to sell a general and administrative and sales office comprising\n\napproximately 118,900 square feet in Mendota Heights, Minnesota. The\n\nCompany's computing services operation leases approximately 100,100 square\n\nfeet in Minneapolis.\n\nThe Company's European manufacturing and support center near Neuchatel,\n\nSwitzerland is located in a facility owned by the Company, consisting of\n\napproximately 75,000 square feet An additional facility comprised of\n\napproximately 60,000 square feet is under construction and due for occupancy in\n\nJanuary 1997.\n\nThe Company also leases sales, service and administrative offices\n\nworldwide.\n\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nThe Company is defending the lawsuits described below. The Company\n\nbelieves that it has good defenses to the claims in each of these lawsuits and\n\nis defending each of them vigorously.\n\nThe Company is defending a securities class action lawsuit and a derivative\n\nsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in\n\nJanuary and March, 1996. These suits allege that the Company and certain of its\n\nofficers and directors made material misrepresentations and omissions during the\n\nperiod from October to December 1995. On September 25, 1996, the District Court\n\ndismissed the securities class action, while allowing plaintiffs one opportunity\n\nto amend their complaint, and dismissed the derivative action with prejudice.\n\nThe Company also is defending securities class action lawsuits involving\n\nMIPS Computers Systems, Inc., which the Company acquired in June 1992, and Alias\n\nResearch Inc., which the Company acquired in June 1995. The MIPS case, which\n\nwas filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in\n\n1992, alleges that MIPS and certain of its officers and directors made material\n\nmisrepresentations and omissions during the period from January to October of\n\n1991. On September 11, 1996, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth\n\nCircuit reversed the summary judgment granted in defendants' favor in June 1994.\n\nThe Company intends to seek rehearing of the Court of Appeals' decision. The\n\nAlias case, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of\n\nConnecticut in 1991, alleges that Alias and certain of its officers and\n\ndirectors made material misrepresentations and omissions during the period from\n\nMay 1991 to April 1992. Alias' motion to dismiss the amended complaint is\n\npending.\n\nThe Company also is defending a patent infringement lawsuit filed by Martin\n\nMarietta Corp. in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida in\n\nSeptember 1995. The Company has filed a counterclaim seeking to invalidate the\n\nprincipal patent at issue in the lawsuit, and Martin Marietta has requested the\n\nU.S. Patent and Trademark Office to re-examine the patent. The District Court\n\nhas set a trial date for the lawsuit in February 1998.\n\n-12-\n\nThe Company routinely receives communications from third parties\n\nasserting patent or other rights covering the Company's products and\n\ntechnologies. Based upon the Company's evaluation, it may take no action or\n\nit may seek to obtain a license. There can be no assurance in any given case\n\nthat a license will be available on terms the Company considers reasonable,\n\nor that litigation will not ensue. Management is not aware of any pending\n\ndisputes, including those described above, that would be likely to have a\n\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of\n\noperations or liquidity. However, management's evaluation of the likely\n\nimpact of these pending disputes could change in the future.\n\nEXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT\n\nThe executive officers of the Company and their ages as of September 20,\n\n1996, are as follows:\n\nExecutive\n\nOfficer\n\nName Age Position and Principal Occupation Since\n\n---- --- --------------------------------- -----\n\nEdward R.
