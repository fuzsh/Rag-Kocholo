(DEC) DECchip Alpha AXP microprocessor is referred to as the 21164. From the viewpoint of numerically-intensive computing, the primary difference between it and its predecessor, the 21064, is that the 21164 has twice the multiply/add throughput per clock period (CP), a maximum of two floating point operations (FLOPS) per CP vs. one for 21064. The AlphaServer 8400 is a shared-memory multiprocessor server system that can accommodate up to 12 CPUs and up to 14 GB of memory. In this report we will compare single processor performance of the 8400 system with that of the International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) RISC System/6000 POWER-2 microprocessor running at 66 MHz, the Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) MIPS R8000 microprocessor running at 75 MHz, and the Cray Research, Inc. CRAY J90. The performance comparison is based on a set of Fortran benchmark codes that represent a portion of the Los Alamos National Laboratory supercomputer workload. The advantage of using these codes, is that the codes also span a wide range of computational characteristics, such as vectorizability, problem size, and memory access pattern. The primary disadvantage of using them is that detailed, quantitative analysis of performance behavior of all codes on all machines is difficult. One important addition to the benchmark set appears for the first time in this report. Whereas the older version was written for a vector processor, the newer version is more optimized for microprocessor architectures. Therefore, we have for the first time, an opportunity to measure performance on a single application using implementations that expose the respective strengths of vector and superscalar architecture. All results in this report are from single processors. A subsequent article will explore shared-memory multiprocessing performance of the 8400 system.},\n\ndoi = {},\n\nurl = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/219456}, journal = {},\n\nnumber = ,\n\nvolume = ,\n\nplace = {United States},\n\nyear = {Thu Feb 01 00:00:00 EST 1996},\n\nmonth = {Thu Feb 01 00:00:00 EST 1996}\n\n}"
