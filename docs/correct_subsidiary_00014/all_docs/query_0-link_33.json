(NYSE:SGI) and Cray\n\nResearch, Inc. (NYSE:CYR) today announced that they have entered into a\n\nmerger agreement, pursuant to which Silicon Graphics will acquire the\n\noutstanding shares of Cray Research. The combined organizations will unite\n\nSilicon Graphics' commitment to scalable, deployable supercomputing and 3D\n\nvisualization with Cray's global leadership in large-scale supercomputing.\n\nThe two companies have a combined revenue run rate of nearly $4 billion.\n\n\"The combination of Silicon Graphics and Cray Research will create the\n\nworld's leading high-performance computing company,\" said Edward R.\n\nMcCracken, chairman and CEO of Silicon Graphics, Inc. \"The two companies\n\nshare not only a passion for innovation but also a remarkably similar\n\narchitectural vision for the future of high-performance computing. The\n\nacquisition of Cray will be instrumental in expanding our scalable\n\narchitecture from high-volume, low-cost desktops to teraflops, while\n\nretaining the unequaled brand equity established by Cray as the worldwide\n\ngold standard for supercomputing solutions\".\n\nCray Research is a recognized leader for its technology, its people\n\nand its strong customer base. With the introduction of a string of\n\nlandmark systems, the company has created the category of\n\nsupercomputing, representing the ultimate in performance for the\n\nscientific and engineering community.\n\nOver the past 18 months, Cray Research has restructured and refocused its\n\nbusiness on the most demanding segments of the high-performance computing\n\nmarket. With the introduction of powerful new products like the CRAY T90\n\nparallel vector system and the CRAY T3D and CRAY T3E highly scalable\n\nproducts, Cray Research returned to profitability in the quarter ending\n\nDecember 31, 1995, and closed that quarter with an all- time high year-end\n\norder backlog of $437 million.\n\nSilicon Graphics is continuing to revolutionize high-performance\n\ncomputing among systems priced at less than $1 million by leveraging\n\nits open CMOS-based MIPS RISC microprocessor technology into its POWER\n\nCHALLENGE family of shared memory multiprocessor supercomputing\n\nsystems.\n\n\"Cray's performance portfolio and reputation, combined with Silicon\n\nGraphics' leadership in revolutionizing the entry-level supercomputing\n\nmarket with deployable solutions, 3D graphics and desktop products, will\n\nposition the new organization as the premier supplier of information\n\ntechnology,\" said J. Phillip Samper, chairman and CEO of Cray Research, Inc.\n\n\"The combination of these two companies will provide not only the world's\n\nmost powerful computers, but also the most aggressive price/performance\n\nsolutions across a broad spectrum of customer requirements.\"\n\nThe definitive merger agreement has been approved by the Boards of\n\nDirectors of Silicon Graphics and Cray Research. Under the terms of the\n\nagreement, Silicon Graphics will make a first step cash tender offer of\n\n$30.00 a share for 19,218,735 shares, approximately 75 percent of the\n\noutstanding common stock of Cray Research. The tender offer is expected to\n\ncommence this week. The offer is subject to the tender of at least 51\n\npercent of Cray Research's shares on a fully-diluted basis in the tender\n\noffer and to customary conditions, including required government approvals.\n\nFollowing completion of the offer, the remaining shares of Cray Research are\n\nexpected to be converted at a one to one ratio into Silicon Graphics' stock.\n\nIf fewer than 19,218,735 of the shares are purchased in the tenderoffer, the\n\nremaining Cray Research shareholders will receive a fraction of Silicon\n\nGraphics stock and cash for each share so that the aggregate cash and stock\n\nconsideration paid in the merger is the same as if the offer had been fully\n\nsubscribed. The merger will be accounted for on a purchase accounting basis.\n\nThe transaction is expected to be closed in Silicon Graphics' quarter ending\n\nin June 1996.\n\nThe closing prices for Silicon Graphics and Cray Research common stock on\n\nFriday, February 23, 1996, the last trading day prior to the board meetings\n\nto approve the transaction, were $27.50 and $25.25 respectively.\n\nThis news release contains forward looking statements that involve risks and\n\nuncertainties, including the satisfaction of the conditions to the\n\ntransaction and the successful integration of Silicon Graphics and Cray\n\nResearch, and other risks detailed from time to time in the SEC reports\n\nfiled by Silicon Graphics and Cray Research, including the report on Form\n\n10-Q filed by Silicon Graphics for the quarter ending December 31, 1995, and\n\nthe report on Form 10-Q filed by Cray Research for the quarter ended\n\nSeptember 30, 1995. Actual results may vary materially.\n\nCray Research provides the leading supercomputing tools and services to help\n\nsolve customers' most challenging problems.
