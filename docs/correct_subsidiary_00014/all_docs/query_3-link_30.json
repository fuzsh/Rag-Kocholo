This prospectus contains forward-looking statements that speak only as of the date they are made and involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors including those described under the heading Risk Factors and elsewhere in this prospectus. All references to we, our, us, Cray and the Company refer to Cray Inc. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Certain technical terms used herein are defined in the glossary of this prospectus.\n\nOur Company\n\nWe design, develop, market and service high performance computer systems, commonly known as supercomputers. These systems provide capability and capacity far beyond typical mainframe computer systems and address the worlds most challenging computing problems for government, industry and academia. We expect that most of our 2003 product revenue will come from sales of our Cray X1 system, the production version of which first shipped in December 2002. In mid-2002 we began a development project with Sandia National Laboratories to design and deliver a new, high bandwidth, massively parallel processing supercomputer system called Red Storm in 2004. We provide maintenance services to the worldwide installed base of Cray computers. We also offer professional services that leverage our industry technical knowledge.\n\nIndustry Background\n\nSince the pioneering Cray-1 system arrived in 1976, supercomputers  defined simply as the most powerful class of computers at any time  have contributed substantially to the advancement of knowledge and the quality of human life. Problems of major economic, scientific and strategic importance typically are addressed by supercomputers, which usually sell for several millions of dollars each, years before becoming tractable with less capable systems.\n\nSilicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) acquired Cray Research in 1996 and cancelled the Cray Research product development activities. This factor, combined with the imposition by the U.S. government in 1997 of anti-dumping duties on Japanese vector supercomputer vendors, curtailed the availability of high bandwidth supercomputers to U.S. users. As a result, todays supercomputer market is replete with low bandwidth cluster systems that loosely link together multiple commodity servers or personal computers with commercially available interconnect products. Because these systems lack sufficient bandwidth, they are most suited for applications easily partitioned into discrete tasks that do not need to communicate often with each other.\n\nApplications promising future competitive and scientific advantage demand significantly more supercomputer power  10 to 1,000 times greater than anything available today  that cannot be addressed by current low bandwidth systems or existing enterprise-class and mainframe servers. There are three principal drivers to the predicted substantial growth in the high performance computing market: the continuing need for advanced design capability, increased focus on national security issues and the recognized need for more powerful scientific research tools. The recently introduced Cray X1 system is designed to meet the needs of the advanced design, national security, scientific research and emerging biosciences markets.\n\nOur Competitive Advantages\n\nWe believe we are well-positioned to meet the growing demand for increased performance because:\n\n we are dedicated solely to the high performance computer market;  our high bandwidth systems are designed to provide greater sustained performance on difficult computational problems, lower long-term costs of operation and greater operating efficiencies;\n\n1\n\nTable of Contents\n\n we expect our recently introduced Cray X1 system to set the sustained performance standard as the worlds most powerful supercomputer system; and  we plan to continue our research and development efforts with Red Storm and other government funded projects.\n\nWith the Cray X1 system as the cornerstone, we now have developed a product roadmap of high performance computer systems that stretches past 2010, with a goal of delivering systems capable of running a variety of challenging applications at sustained speeds in excess of one petaflops (1,000 trillion floating point operations per second).\n\nOur Strategy\n\nOur mission is to become the premier provider of supercomputer solutions for our customers. Key elements of our strategy include:\n\n focus on high performance computer systems with high bandwidth that run customer applications at high sustained speeds;  leverage our strong brand, reputation and pioneering position to increase our market share;  pursue an aggressive research and development plan to implement our product roadmap; and  build relationships with key researchers to penetrate emerging government and industrial markets.\n\nCray Research Acquisition\n\nOn April 1, 2000, we acquired the operating assets of the Cray Research business unit from SGI, and changed our corporate name from Tera Computer Company to Cray Inc. Prior to the acquisition, we had one supercomputer product in development, sales to one customer, limited revenue and approximately 125 employees. Through the acquisition we acquired about 775 employees located in over 20 countries, ongoing sales of existing supercomputer systems with several products in development, integration and final assembly operations, an established service organization, product and service inventory and real property. For these reasons, period to period comparisons that include periods prior to April 1, 2000, are not meaningful. Discussions that relate to periods prior to April 1, 2000, refer to our operations as Tera Computer Company, and discussions that relate to periods after April 1, 2000, refer to our combined operations as Cray Inc.\n\nWe were incorporated in Washington in 1987 under the name Tera Computer Company. Our executive offices are located at Merrill Place, 411 First Avenue South, Suite 600, Seattle, WA 98104-2860, and our telephone number is (206) 701-2000. Information contained on our web site does not constitute part of this prospectus.\n\n2\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Offering\n\nExcept as described in the financial statements incorporated by reference in this prospectus or as otherwise specified in this prospectus, all information in this prospectus assumes no exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option.\n\nCommon stock offered by Cray\n\n6,000,000 shares\n\nCommon stock offered by the selling shareholders\n\n250,000 shares\n\nCommon stock to be outstanding after the offering\n\n62,039,216 shares\n\nUse of proceeds\n\nFor general corporate purposes\n\nNasdaq National Market Symbol\n\nCRAY\n\nThe number of shares outstanding after the offering is based on 56,039,216 shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2002, and excludes:\n\n 3,125,000 shares of Series A preferred stock convertible into 3,136,763 shares of common stock;  warrants to purchase 8,964,373 shares of common stock;  stock options to purchase an aggregate of 13,396,390 shares of common stock, of which 6,811,975 options were exercisable as of December 31, 2002.

We derived the operating data for the years ended December 31, 1997, and 1998 from our audited consolidated financial statements, which are not incorporated by reference in this prospectus. We derived the balance sheet data as of September 30, 2002, and the operating data for the nine months ended September 30, 2001, and 2002 from our unaudited consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference in this prospectus. We have prepared the unaudited consolidated financial statements on a basis substantially consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference in this prospectus and, in the opinion of management, these statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for fair presentation of such data.\n\nFinancial data for the year ended December 31, 2000, in the following table includes nine months of activity of the Cray Research business unit we acquired on April 1, 2000. Period to period comparisons that include periods prior to April 1, 2000, are not meaningful. See Business  Our History  Cray Acquisition. Application of the non-amortization provisions of SFAS No. 142, which we adopted effective January 1, 2002, resulted in an increase in net income of $5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2002. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\nThe As Adjusted data set forth below gives effect to the receipt of the net proceeds from the sale by us of 6,000,000 shares of common stock in this offering at the public offering price of $l, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

These statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as may, will, expect, anticipate, estimate, continue, or other similar words. When considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in this prospectus. The risk factors described below and other factors noted throughout this prospectus could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those contained in any forward-looking statement.\n\nIn this prospectus, we rely on and refer to information and statistics regarding the markets for various products. We obtained this information from third party sources, discussions with our customers, and our own internal estimates. We believe that these sources and estimates are reliable, but we have not independently verified them and there can be no assurance that they are accurate.\n\n5\n\nTable of Contents\n\nRISK FACTORS\n\nThe shares of common stock offered by this prospectus are speculative and involve a high degree of risk of loss. Before making an investment, you should carefully read this entire prospectus, including the information incorporated by reference, and consider the following risks and speculative factors:\n\nRisks Related To Our Business\n\nIf we are unable to produce the Cray X1 system on a sustainable basis, our revenue and profits would be reduced. We expect that our success in 2003 and beyond will depend largely upon our ability to turn the Cray X1 system into a stable production quality product. We depend on our vendors to manufacture components for our systems. If our vendors were unable to manufacture components to our design specifications on a timely basis and with sufficient yields, increased repair charges would reduce margins and profits and any delayed deliveries of production quality Cray X1 systems to customers would adversely affect our revenue and profits. We have received Cray X1 system components with unacceptable yields and are working with our vendors to achieve higher yields of reliable components. We have redesigned, and in the future we may have to redesign further, hardware components of the Cray X1 system because of previously unforeseen defects. Redesign work is costly and could cause delays in the production and sale of Cray X1 systems. We also need to achieve reliable system software to sell Cray X1 systems to production environment governmental and industrial customers. We continue to fix reported software problems and anticipate additional software problems to be reported in the future.\n\nWe may not be successful in completing the Red Storm project on time and on budget, which would adversely affect our earnings. Our efforts to complete the development and delivery of the Red Storm project for Sandia National Laboratories in 2004 on time and on budget are subject to significant risks. Our work is pursuant to a fixed-price contract with payment against significant monthly milestones setting out a tight development schedule and technically challenging performance requirements. Our success depends on third-party software development, some of which is to be supplied by Sandia. Continued funding of the project is subject to future federal government appropriations. This project is lengthy and technically challenging, and requires a significant investment of engineering and other resources. Falling behind schedule or incurring cost overruns would adversely affect our capital resources and earnings.\n\nIf the U.S. government purchases fewer supercomputers, our revenue would be reduced and our profitability would be adversely affected. Historically, sales to the U.S. government and customers primarily serving the U.S. government have represented a significant market for supercomputers. From January 1, 2001, through September 30, 2002, approximately 67% of our product revenue was derived from sales to various agencies of the U.S. government. We expect that our initial sales of Cray X1 systems in 2003 will be predominantly to government agencies in the United States and other countries. Sales to government agencies may be affected by factors outside our control, such as changes in procurement policies, budget considerations and international political developments. If the United States or other governments were to stop, reduce or delay their use and purchases of supercomputers, our revenue would be reduced.\n\nIf we lose government support for supercomputer systems, our capital requirements would increase and our ability to conduct research and development would decrease. A few government agencies and research laboratories fund a significant portion of our development efforts. Agencies of the U.S. government historically have facilitated the development of, and have constituted a market for, new and enhanced very high performance computer systems, including the current Cray X1 system and our planned Cray X1e, Black Widow, Cascade and Red Storm development projects. U.S. government agencies may delay or decrease funding of these development efforts due to change of priorities, international political developments or for any other reason. Any such decreases or delays may cause an increased need for capital and may adversely affect our research and development expenditures and our ability to implement our product roadmap.\n\nProcurement proposals based on theoretical peak performance reduce our ability to market our systems. Our high performance computer systems are designed to provide high actual sustained performance on difficult computational problems. Some of our competitors offer systems with higher theoretical peak\n\n6\n\nTable of Contents\n\nperformance at lower comparable prices, although their actual sustained performance on real applications frequently is a small fraction of their theoretical peak performance. Nevertheless, a number of requests for proposals, primarily from governmental agencies in the United States and elsewhere, continue to have criteria based wholly or significantly on theoretical peak performance. Unless these criteria are changed, we are disadvantaged in these instances by being unable to submit competitive bids, which limits our revenue potential.\n\nIf third-party application software were unavailable when needed, we might have difficulty selling our systems to some customers. To make sales in the automotive, aerospace, chemistry and other engineering and technical markets, including certain governmental users, we must be able to induce independent software vendors to port their software application programs so that they will run at sufficient speeds on the Cray X1 and our other systems. The Cray X1 system has a new architecture that may make porting of application programs difficult. The relatively low volume of supercomputer sales makes it difficult for us to attract independent software vendors. We also modify and rewrite third-party software applications to run on our systems and so facilitate the expansion of our potential markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to induce these vendors to rewrite their applications, or that we will successfully rewrite third-party applications for use on our systems.\n\nTermination by NEC Corporation of our distribution rights for the Cray SX-6 system may decrease our revenue and increase competition. We market a rebranded product known as the Cray SX-6 system, which was developed and is built in Japan by NEC Corporation. This product first became available for delivery in North America in the first quarter of 2002, and we are the exclusive distributor of NEC vector supercomputer systems in North America and a non-exclusive distributor outside North America. If we do not achieve certain volumes of sales of Cray SX-6 systems through March 2003, NEC can terminate or make non-exclusive our North American distribution rights for this product and can terminate our distribution rights for NEC vector supercomputers outside North America. Supercomputer customers in the United States have been reluctant to purchase supercomputers from non-U.S. sources, and domestic demand for the SX-6 systems has been far less than we anticipated. We believe there is a reasonable probability that we will not meet the required sales volumes under our agreement with NEC. Loss of our exclusive distribution rights to NEC vector supercomputer systems would result in competition from NEC in North America, and loss of our distribution rights would result in loss of our ability to sell the SX-6 system and successor systems. Any loss of these distribution rights may decrease our revenue and increase competition from NEC. Outside of North America, NEC has competed aggressively based on price.\n\nLower than anticipated sales of new supercomputers would further reduce our service revenue from maintenance service contracts. High performance computer systems are typically sold with maintenance service contracts. These contracts generally are for annual periods, although some are for multi-year periods, and provide a predictable revenue base. Revenue from maintenance service contracts has declined from approximately $125 million in 1999 to approximately $83 million in 2001 and approximately $68 million in 2002 as our older systems are withdrawn from service. This revenue is expected to decline further until a sufficient number of our new computer systems are placed in service to balance the withdrawal of our older systems.\n\nOur reliance on third party suppliers poses significant risks to our business and prospects. We subcontract the manufacture of substantially all of our hardware components for all of our products, including integrated circuits, printed circuit boards, flex circuits and power supplies, on a sole or limited source basis to third-party suppliers. We use a contract manufacturer to assemble our components for the Cray X1 and other systems. We are subject to substantial risks because of our reliance on these and other limited or sole source suppliers. For example:\n\n if a supplier did not provide components that meet our specifications in sufficient quantities, then production and sale of our systems would be delayed;  if a reduction or an interruption of supply of our components occurred, it could take us a considerable period of time to identify and qualify alternative suppliers to redesign our products as necessary and to begin manufacture of the redesigned components;\n\n7\n\nTable of Contents\n\n if we were ever unable to locate a supplier for a key component, we would be unable to deliver our products;  one or more suppliers could make strategic changes in their product lines, which might delay or suspend manufacture of our components or systems; and  some of our key suppliers are small companies with limited financial and other resources, and consequently may be more likely to experience financial and operational difficulties than larger, well-established companies.\n\nFrom time to time, we have experienced delays in obtaining manufactured components and completed assemblies on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities from our suppliers, which have resulted in delays in the development and production of our products.\n\nOur ability to use the SGI IRIX operating system is limited by our agreement with SGI, which may require us to develop an alternative operating system for our Black Widow and other future products. The technology agreement through which we acquired and licensed patent, know-how and other intellectual property rights from SGI restricts the use of certain SGI technology. Most significantly, the technology agreement limits our use of SGIs IRIX operating system to the Cray X1 product family. If we are unable to obtain a license from SGI to use its IRIX operating system on successors to the Cray X1 product family, starting with the Black Widow product, then we would need to develop or acquire our own UNIX-based operating system for these successor systems. This could be a costly and difficult process, and might delay the availability of such successor systems.\n\nThe high failure rate in the Cray T90 installed base may reduce our earnings. Some of the components in the Cray T90 vector computers, a product we acquired through the Cray Research acquisition, have an unusually high failure rate. The cost of servicing the T90 computers exceeds the related service revenue. In connection with our acquisition of the Cray Research business unit from SGI, we recorded a warranty reserve to provide for anticipated future losses on the T90 maintenance service contracts. The balance of this reserve was $7.2 million as of September 30, 2002. We anticipate that almost all of our T90 systems will be deinstalled by the end of 2003. We believe that the warranty reserve balance at September 30, 2002, is a reasonable estimate of the extent to which our costs to service these computers will exceed the revenue generated from existing service contracts. Our estimates may prove to be inaccurate, and our actual costs may differ materially from our estimates. In addition, the T90 failures have adversely affected our reputation for quality products with some customers and may adversely affect sales of our new systems.\n\nIf we cannot attract, retain and motivate key personnel, we may be unable to implement effectively our business plan. Our success also depends in large part upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled management, technical and marketing and sales personnel. Competition for highly skilled management, technical, marketing and sales personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.\n\nWe may infringe or be subject to claims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others, and we are defending a lawsuit asserting infringement claims. Third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us, and such claims, if proved, could require us to pay substantial damages or to redesign our existing products. Regardless of the merits, any claim of infringement requires management attention and causes us to incur significant expense to defend. For example, we currently are defending a recently commenced lawsuit alleging that the evaporative spray cooling system in our Cray X1 system infringes patents and trade secrets held by a third party. The complaint seeks injunctive relief and damages. While we intend to defend this lawsuit vigorously, pre-trial discovery is just beginning and at this time we cannot predict the outcome of this lawsuit.\n\nWe may not be able to protect our proprietary information and rights adequately. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trade secret protection, non-disclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to establish, protect and enforce our proprietary information and rights. We have a number of patents and have additional applications pending. There can be no assurance, however, that patents will be issued from the pending applications or that any issued patents will protect adequately those aspects of our\n\n8\n\nTable of Contents\n\ntechnology to which such patents will relate. Despite our efforts to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights, we cannot be certain that we will succeed in doing so or that our competitors will not independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies. The laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent or in the same manner as do the laws of the United States. Although we continue to implement protective measures and intend to defend our proprietary rights vigorously, these efforts may not be successful.\n\nU.S. export controls could hinder our ability to make sales to foreign customers and our future prospects. The U.S. government regulates the export of high performance computer systems such as our products. Occasionally we have experienced delays in receiving appropriate approvals necessary for certain sales, which have delayed the shipment of our products. Delay or denial in the granting of any required licenses could make it more difficult to make sales to foreign customers, eliminating an important source of potential revenue.\n\nRisks Related To Our Industry\n\nIf we are unable to compete successfully against larger, more established companies in the high performance computer market, our revenue will decline. The performance of our products may not be competitive with the computer systems offered by our competitors. Many of our competitors are established companies that are well known in the high performance computer market, including IBM, SGI, Hewlett-Packard, NEC (outside of North America), and Sun Microsystems. Each of these competitors has broader product lines and substantially greater research, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and financial resources than we do. Periodic announcements by our competitors of new high performance computer systems (or plans for future systems) and price adjustments may reduce customer demand for our products. Most of our potential customers already own or lease very high performance computer systems. Some of our competitors offer trade-in allowances or substantial discounts to potential customers, and engage in other aggressive pricing tactics, and we have not always been able to match these sales incentives. We may be required to provide discounts to make sales or to provide lease financing for our products, which would result in a deferral of our receipt of cash for these systems. These developments would limit our revenue and resources and would reduce our ability to be profitable.\n\nWe may not compete successfully against innovative competitors or new entrants. Our market is characterized by rapidly changing technology, accelerated product obsolescence and continuously evolving industry standards. Our success will depend upon our ability to sell our current products, and to develop successor systems. We will need to introduce new products and features in a timely manner to meet evolving customer requirements. We may not succeed in these efforts. Even if we succeed, products or technologies developed by others may render our products or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete. New companies have capitalized on developments in parallel processing and increased computer performance through networking and clustering systems. Currently, these products are limited in applicability and scalability and can be difficult to program. A breakthrough in architecture or software technology could make parallel systems more attractive to potential customers. Such a breakthrough would impair our ability to sell our products and reduce our revenue.\n\nGeneral economic and market conditions could decrease our revenue, increase our need for cash and adversely affect our profitability. While much of our business is related to the government sector, which is less affected by short-term economic cycles, a slow-down in the overall U.S. and global economy and resultant decreases in capital expenditures have affected sales to our industrial customers and may continue to do so. Cancellations or delays in purchases would decrease our revenue, increase our need for working capital and adversely affect our profitability.\n\nRisks Related To An Investment In Our Company\n\nWe have experienced annual losses from operations in prior years, and we may not achieve net income on a consistent basis. We have experienced net losses in each full year of our operations. We incurred net\n\n9\n\nTable of Contents\n\nlosses of approximately $35.2 million in 2001, $25.4 million in 2000, and $34.5 million in 1999. For the nine months ended September 30, 2002, we had net income of $4.1 million. Whether we will achieve net income on a consistent basis will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\n our ability to market and sell the Cray X1 system and other products, maintain the Red Storm project on schedule and engage professional services clients;  the level of revenue in any given period;  the cost of servicing the Cray T90 installed base;  the terms and conditions of sale or lease for our products; and  our expense levels, particularly for research and development and manufacturing and service costs.\n\nBecause of the numerous factors affecting our results of operations, there can be no assurance that we will have net income in the future.\n\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly. Our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations due to many factors. One or a few system sales may account for a substantial percentage of our quarterly and annual revenue, and thus revenue, net income or loss and cash flow are likely to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. This is due to the high average sales price of our products, the timing of purchase orders and product delivery, and our general policy of not recognizing product revenue until our customers accept our products. Red Storm revenue and margin may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the level of contract activity, including purchases of materials and changes in the estimates of the cost to complete. Because a number of our prospective customers receive funding from the U.S. or foreign governments, the timing of orders from our customers may be subject to the appropriation and funding schedules of the relevant government agencies. The timing of orders and shipments also could be affected by other events outside our control, such as:\n\n the timely availability of acceptable components in sufficient quantities to meet customer delivery schedules;  changes in levels of customer capital spending;  the introduction or announcement of competitive products;  timing of the receipt of necessary export licenses; or  currency fluctuations and international conflicts or economic crises.\n\nOur stock price may be volatile. The stock market has been and is subject to price and volume fluctuations that particularly affect the market prices for small capitalization, high technology companies like us. The trading price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in response to many factors, including our quarterly operating results, changes in analysts estimates, our future capital raising activities, announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors and general conditions in our industry.\n\nA substantial number of our shares are eligible for future sale and may depress the market price of our common stock and may hinder our ability to obtain additional financing. As of December 31, 2002, we had outstanding:\n\n 56,039,216 shares of common stock;  3,125,000 shares of Series A preferred stock convertible into 3,136,763 shares of common stock;  warrants to purchase 8,964,373 shares of common stock; and  stock options to purchase an aggregate of 13,396,390 shares of common stock, of which 6,811,975 options were then exercisable.\n\nAlmost all of our outstanding shares of common stock may be sold without substantial restrictions. All of the shares purchased under the warrants and exercisable options are available for sale in the public market,\n\n10\n\nTable of Contents\n\nsubject in some cases to volume and other limitations. All outstanding shares of Series A preferred stock are owned by NEC Corporation. The Series A preferred stock is not convertible into common stock unless the Series A preferred stock is sold or we sell substantially all our assets or we are acquired and the holders of our voting stock own less than a majority of the voting stock of the entity surviving the acquisition. Any shares of Series A preferred stock that are sold automatically convert into common stock. NEC has agreed not to sell the Series A preferred stock before May 10, 2003. After that date, NEC can sell the Series A preferred stock without restriction, except that NEC cannot sell privately to any person who is, or by such sale would become, a beneficial owner of 5% or more of our common stock. In addition, after May 10, 2003, if requested to do so by NEC, we are obligated to register for public resale the common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A preferred stock. Warrants to purchase 3,524,523 shares of common stock, with exercise prices ranging from $3.00 to $6.00 per share, expire between September 28, 2003, and November 2, 2004. Warrants to purchase 300,442 shares of common stock, with exercise prices ranging from $4.50 to $6.00 per share, expire between November 7, 2005, and September 3, 2006. The remaining warrants outstanding as of December 31, 2002, to purchase 5,139,408 shares of common stock, with an exercise price of $2.53 per share, expire on June 21, 2009. Sales in the public market of substantial amounts of our common stock, including sales of common stock issuable upon the exercise or conversion of the warrants, options, and Series A preferred stock, may depress prevailing market prices for the common stock. Even the perception that sales could occur may impact market prices adversely. The existence of outstanding warrants, options and Series A preferred stock may prove to be a hindrance to our future equity financings. Further, the holders of the warrants and options may exercise them for shares of common stock, and NEC may sell its Series A preferred stock, at a time when we would otherwise be able to obtain additional equity capital on terms more favorable to us. Such factors could impair our ability to meet our capital needs.\n\nProvisions of our articles and bylaws could make a proposed acquisition that is not approved by our board of directors more difficult. Provisions of our restated articles of incorporation and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us. These provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock. For example, our articles of incorporation and bylaws provide for:\n\n a staggered board of directors, so that only two or three of our eight directors are elected each year;  removal of a director only in limited circumstances and only upon the affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote to elect directors;  the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock, without shareholder approval, with rights senior to those of the common stock;  no cumulative voting of shares;  calling a special meeting of the shareholders only upon demand by the holders of not less than 30% of the shares entitled to vote at such a meeting;  amendments to our restated articles of incorporation require the affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on the amendment, unless the amendment was approved by a majority of our continuing directors, who are defined as directors who have either served as a director since August 31, 1995, or were nominated to be a director by the continuing directors;  special voting requirements for mergers and other business combinations, unless the proposed transaction was approved by a majority of continuing directors;  special procedures must be followed to bring matters before our shareholders at our annual shareholders meeting; and  special procedures must be followed to nominate members for election to our board of directors.\n\nThese provisions could delay, defer or prevent a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business transaction between us and a third party.\n\n11\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAdditional financings may be dilutive to our shareholders. We may need to raise additional equity or debt capital if we experience lower than anticipated product sales due to delays in availability of Cray X1 systems for delivery to customers or general economic conditions, or if we fail to receive sufficient governmental support for our products and research activities. In addition, we may raise additional funds to enhance our working capital position. Financings may not be available to us when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms and may be dilutive to our shareholders.\n\nWe do not anticipate declaring any dividends. We have never paid any dividends on our common stock, and we intend to continue our policy of retaining any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. In addition, our credit facilities prohibit us from paying cash dividends without the consent of our lenders.\n\n12\n\nTable of Contents\n\nUSE OF PROCEEDS\n\nOur net proceeds from the sale of the 6,000,000 shares of our common stock offered by us at the public offering price of $l per share are estimated to be $l after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and our estimated offering expenses. We expect to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes. Pending such use, we intend to invest the net proceeds from the offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment grade securities. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of 250,000 shares by the selling shareholders.\n\nPRICE RANGE OF COMMON STOCK\n\nOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol CRAY; prior to April 1, 2000, our stock traded under the symbol TERA.

See Business  Our History  Cray Acquisition. Application of the non-amortization provisions of SFAS No. 142, which we adopted effective January 1, 2002, resulted in an increase in operating results of $5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2002.\n\nNine Months Ended Year Ended December 31, September 30, 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2001 2002\n\nOperating Data:\n\nProduct revenue\n\n$  $ 1,274 $ 1,794 $ 46,617 $ 51,105 $ 45,333 $ 55,491\n\nService revenue\n\n 714 320 71,455 82,502 62,213 60,397\n\nCost of product revenue\n\n 3,759 15,165 32,505 30,657 24,777 29,242\n\nCost of service revenue\n\n 584 273 34,077 41,181 29,780 32,755\n\nResearch and development\n\n13,142 13,664 15,216 48,426 53,926 40,398 26,440\n\nGoodwill amortization\n\n   5,217 6,981 5,318 \n\nNet income (loss)\n\n(15,755 ) (19,803 ) (34,532 ) (25,388 ) (35,228 ) (17,896 ) 4,075\n\nNet income (loss) per common share\n\nBasic\n\n$ (2.13 ) $ (1.70 ) $ (1.74 ) $ (0.78 ) $ (0.87 ) $ (0.45 ) $ 0.09\n\nDiluted\n\n$ (2.13 ) $ (1.70 ) $ (1.74 ) $ (0.78 ) $ (0.87 ) $ (0.45 ) $ 0.08\n\nWeighted average outstanding shares\n\nBasic\n\n8,785 12,212 19,906 32,699 40,632 40,130 46,221\n\nDiluted\n\n8,785 12,212 19,906 32,699 40,632 40,130 51,291\n\nDecember 31, September 30, 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2001 2002\n\nBalance Sheet Data:\n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\n$ 13,329 $ 3,162 $ 10,069 $ 4,626 $ 12,377 $ 4,306 $ 27,350\n\nWorking capital\n\n14,342 7,269 9,208 (25,970 ) (5,724 ) 3,247 22,251\n\nWarranty reserves, long-term portion\n\n   14,285 8,479 9,896 3,262\n\nConvertible subordinated debentures\n\n    8,387  8,472\n\nOther long term obligations\n\n532 573 1,412 538 4,349 5,107 2,605\n\nTotal assets\n\n20,859 20,288 23,410 136,193 127,087 126,245 140,697\n\nRedeemable securities\n\n9,478      \n\nShareholders equity\n\n6,368 11,889 14,307 36,147 39,750 56,233 70,826\n\n15\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act, as amended, and is subject to the safe harbor created by those sections. Factors that realistically could cause results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements are set forth above under Risk Factors. The following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto incorporated by reference in this prospectus.\n\nOverview\n\nWe design, develop, market and service high performance computer systems, commonly known as supercomputers. These systems provide capability and capacity far beyond typical mainframe computer systems and address the worlds most challenging computing problems for government, industry and academia. We expect that most of our 2003 product revenue will come from sales of our Cray X1 system, the production version of which first shipped in December 2002. In mid-2002 we began a development project with Sandia National Laboratories to design and deliver a new, high bandwidth, massively parallel processing supercomputer system called Red Storm in 2004. We provide maintenance services to the worldwide installed base of Cray computers. We also offer professional services that leverage our industry technical knowledge.\n\nWe have experienced net losses in each full year of our operations. We incurred net losses of approximately $35.2 million in 2001, $25.4 million in 2000, and $34.5 million in 1999. For the nine months ended September 30, 2002, we had net income of $4.1 million.\n\nWe recognize product revenue from sales of our computer systems upon acceptance by the customer, although in limited circumstances, depending on sales contract terms, revenue may be recognized when title passes upon shipment or may be delayed until funding is certain. We recognize product revenue from the Red Storm project using the percentage-of-completion method. We recognize service revenue for the maintenance of our computer systems ratably over the term of each maintenance agreement. Funds from maintenance contracts that are paid in advance are recorded as deferred revenue. We recognize service revenue from our professional services activities as services are rendered.\n\nFactors that should be considered in evaluating our business, operations and prospects and that could affect our future results and financial condition are set forth above under Risk Factors.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nThis discussion as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this prospectus are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingencies. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the estimates used, including those related to estimates of warranty liabilities, valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or market, the percentage complete and estimated gross profit on the Red Storm contract, and impairment of goodwill. We base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n16\n\nTable of Contents\n\nT90 Reserve\n\nWe acquired service contracts in the acquisition of the Cray Research business unit in April 2000 for Cray T90 vector computers. Some of the components in the Cray T90 vector computers have an unusually high failure rate. As of April 1, 2000, the date of our acquisition of the Cray Research business unit from Silicon Graphics, Inc., we recorded a warranty reserve of $47.5 million, of which $46.3 million reflected our estimate of the amount by which the cost of servicing the T90 vector computers would exceed the revenue generated from servicing them until they were no longer in use by our customers. As we incur costs to service these computers in excess of the related service revenue, we reduce the amount of the T90 warranty reserve. As of September 30, 2002, our total warranty reserve balance was $7.5 million, of which $7.2 million related to the T90 vector computers. We continually monitor the reasonableness of our estimate of the warranty reserve. This involves analysis of our assumptions with regard to the length of time the T90 vector computers will be in use by our customers, the failure rate of modules in the computers considering actual historical failure rates, and personnel and resources, including service spares, that will be required to correct failures that occur in the future. We believe that the T90 warranty reserve balance at September 30, 2002, is a reasonable estimate of the extent to which our costs to service these computers will exceed the revenue generated from existing service contracts. It is possible, however, that our estimates may prove to be inaccurate and that our actual costs may differ materially from our estimates.\n\nRed Storm Contract\n\nProduct revenue from the Red Storm contract is accounted for using the percentage of completion method. Revenue is recognized as costs are incurred, and margin is based on the total estimated cost to complete. The estimate to complete is based on several factors, including estimated labor hours to complete certain tasks and estimated cost of purchased components at future dates. Our estimates may need to be adjusted from quarter to quarter, which would impact our revenue and our margin on a cumulative basis.\n\nInventories\n\nWe record our inventories at the lower of cost or market. We regularly evaluate the technological usefulness of various inventory components. When it is discovered that previously inventoried components do not function as intended in a fully operational system, the costs associated with these components are expensed. Due to rapid changes in technology and the increasing demands of our customers, we are continually developing new products. As a result, it is possible that older products we have developed may become obsolete or we may sell these products below cost. When we determine that we will likely not recover the cost of inventory items through future sales, we write down the related inventory to our estimate of its market value. As of September 30, 2002, we had an allowance for excess and obsolete inventory of $8.2 million applied against our gross inventory balance of $26.4 million. Because the products we sell have high average sales prices and because a high number of our prospective customers receive funding from U.S. or foreign governments, it is difficult to estimate future sales of our products and the timing of such sales. It also is difficult to determine whether the cost of our inventories will ultimately be recovered through future sales. While we believe our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market and that our estimates and assumptions to determine any adjustments to the cost of our inventories are reasonable, our estimates may prove to be inaccurate. We have sold inventory previously reduced in part or in whole to zero, and we may have future sales of previously written down inventory. We may also have additional expense to write down inventory to its estimated market value. Adjustments to these estimates in the future may materially impact our operating results.\n\nGoodwill\n\nApproximately 16% of our assets as of September 30, 2002, consisted of goodwill resulting from our acquisition of the Cray Research business unit from SGI in 2000. As discussed in the Recent Accounting Pronouncements section in the notes to the financial statements, which are incorporated by reference in this prospectus from the 2001 Form 10-K Annual Report, we adopted SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002, and we no longer amortize goodwill associated with the acquisition, but we will be required to conduct ongoing\n\n17\n\nTable of Contents\n\nanalyses of the recorded amount of goodwill in comparison to its estimated fair value. These ongoing analyses of whether the fair value of recorded goodwill is impaired will involve a substantial amount of judgment. Future charges related to goodwill could be material depending on future developments and changes in technology and our business.\n\nResults of Operations\n\nWith the acquisition of the Cray Research business unit on April 1, 2000, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results that include periods prior to the acquisition are not meaningful.\n\nProduct Revenue\n\nWe had product revenue of $55.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, compared to $45.3 million for the respective 2001 period. Product revenue represented 48% of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, compared to 42% for the corresponding 2001 period, and consisted primarily in the 2002 period of $17.4 million for our Cray SV1 and SV1ex product line, $16.3 million for our T3E product line, $5.7 million for shipments of early production Cray X1 systems, $5.0 million for our MTA-2 product line and $11.0 million for our other products.\n\nWe had revenue from product sales of $51.1 million for 2001, up from $46.6 million in 2000 and $1.8 million in 1999. Product revenue represented 38% of total revenues for 2001 and consisted primarily of $19.1 million for our SV1 and SV1ex product line and $27.3 million for our T3E product line. 2001 revenues included $2.2 million from the sale of inventory previously written down to zero. Product sales revenue was less than anticipated due to delays in completing the SV1ex enhancements, with the first complete SV1ex product shipment occurring in late November 2001. Product revenue in 2000 primarily consisted of $19.1 million for our SV1 product line and $27.3 million for our T3E product line. Product sales for Cray Research products declined during each of the three years prior to our acquisition of the Cray Research business unit, primarily because SGI had stopped development funding of new Cray Research products. Product revenue in 1999 included $1.7 million from the upgrade of the MTA system at the San Diego Supercomputer Center to eight processors.\n\nWith the delivery of the Cray X1 system to customers and the performance of the Red Storm project, we expect our product revenue in 2003 to increase and be a larger percentage of total revenue. We expect our product revenue to vary quarterly. If we lose our distribution rights for NEC vector systems in North America, we may experience increased competition for domestic sales of our products. See Business  Competition.\n\nService Revenue\n\nWe had service revenue, which includes revenue from maintenance services and, beginning in 2002, from professional services, of $60.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, compared to $62.2 million for the 2001 period. The 2002 results include $6.2 million from professional services for the first nine months, including $3.0 million for preliminary engineering services on the Red Storm project in the third quarter. Revenue from the Red Storm project will be reported as product revenue in subsequent quarters. Service revenue represented 52% of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, and 58% for the corresponding 2001 period.\n\nWe had service revenue of $82.5 million in 2001, up from $71.5 million for 2000 and $320,000 in 1999. Services are provided under separate maintenance contracts with our customers. These contracts generally provide for maintenance services for one year, although some are for multi-year periods. The overall increase in service revenue is due to the acquisition of the Cray product line and related service business in April 2000. Service revenue represented 62% and 61% of total revenues for 2001 and 2000, respectively. We expect maintenance service revenue to decline slowly over the next year or so as our older systems are withdrawn from service and then to stabilize as our new systems are placed in service.\n\n18\n\nTable of Contents\n\nProfessional services are provided under separate contracts for a particular activity such as development, design and study of a new high performance computer system, deinstalling a computer system, porting a certain application to one of our platforms or use of our computer resources for a particular period, and we expect contracts to vary greatly in size. We recorded our first revenue from professional services in the first quarter of 2002, and we expect our professional services revenue, adjusted for future reporting of the Red Storm project as product revenue, to increase modestly.\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nCost of Product Revenue. We had cost of product revenue of $29.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, compared to $24.8 million for the 2001 nine-month period. Our cost of product represented 53% of product revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, compared to 55% for the corresponding 2001 nine-month period. Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 includes $5.9 million from the sale in the first quarter of obsolete inventory recorded at a zero cost basis.\n\nCost of product revenue was $30.7 million for 2001, $32.5 million for 2000 and $15.2 million for 1999. Cost of product revenue represented 60%, 70%, and 845% of product revenue for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The high cost of product revenue in 2000 is due to the age of the SV1 and T3E product lines and inventory adjustments for SV1 and MTA gallium arsenide parts. Cost of product revenue was high in 1999 as a percentage of the revenue due to the inclusion of manufacturing costs and inventory adjustments relating to the MTA product line and favorable pricing terms provided to our first MTA customer.\n\nWe expect that, compared to 2002, our cost of product revenue in 2003 will be adversely affected by start-up costs incurred in the Cray X1 ramp-up and lower margins on the Red Storm project. In addition, we may grant favorable pricing for large multi-system contracts.\n\nCost of Service Revenue. We had cost of service revenue of $32.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, including $8.3 million of cost of professional services revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, compared to $29.8 million for the corresponding 2001 nine-month period. Our cost of service revenue represented 54% of service revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, compared to 48% for the corresponding 2001 nine-month period. The lower cost of service revenue in the first nine months of 2001 was due to favorable cost variances. In 2002, lower cost of maintenance revenue, due in part to $2.7 million reduction in warranty reserves, was largely offset by higher costs for professional services revenue due to the start-up of those services.\n\nCost of service revenue was $41.2 million for 2001, $34.1 million for 2000 and $273,000 for 1999. Cost of service revenue represented 50%, 48%, and 85% of service revenue for 2001, 2000 and 1999.\n\nGiven that maintenance revenue is expected to decline slowly and our professional services revenue will increase only modestly, we expect our overall cost of service revenue to increase to over 60% as a percentage of service revenue for 2003.\n\nResearch and Development\n\nResearch and development expenses for the nine month period ended September 30, 2001, and 2002 reflect our costs associated with the enhancements to the Cray SV1 and T3E systems in the 2001 period and the development of the Cray X1, and to a lesser extent, the Cray MTA-2 in both the 2001 and 2002 nine-month periods, including related software development. Research and development expenses for 1999, 2000 and 2001 reflect our costs associated with the enhancements to the Cray SV1 and T3E systems and the development of the Cray MTA and X1 systems, including related software development. These costs also include personnel expenses, allocated overhead and operating expenses, software, materials and engineering expenses, including payments to third parties. These costs are offset in part by government funding for development and services, including development related to the Cray X1 systems, enhancements and successors to the Cray X1 system and other products, and our efforts on the Red Storm project. Research and\n\n19\n\nTable of Contents\n\ndevelopment expenses for 1999, 2000 and 2001 and the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2001, and 2002 were as follows (in thousands):\n\nFor the Nine Months For the Year Ended December 31, Ended September 30, 1999 2000 2001 2001 2002\n\nGross research and development\n\n$ 15,288 $ 57,730 $ 66,549 $ 50,111 $ 40,927\n\nGovernment funding\n\n(72 ) (9,304 ) (12,623 ) (9,713 ) (14,487 )\n\nNet research and development\n\n$ 15,216 $ 48,426 $ 53,926 $ 40,398 $ 26,440\n\nGross research and development expenditures have continued to decline as we completed the major development work on the Cray X1 system as well as the Cray SV1ex and MTA-2 systems. At the same time we have received increased governmental funding for our continued development efforts. Net research and development expenditures represented 40%, 41%, and 720% of revenue for 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively, and 23% of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, compared to 38% for the corresponding 2001 nine-month period.\n\nWe expect that gross research and development expenses will increase in 2003 to reach or slightly exceed the 2001 level. However, we expect that net research and development expenses will remain flat or decline for the fourth quarter of 2002 and into 2003, primarily due to increased governmental funding. As a percentage of overall revenue, we expect net research and development expenses to continue to decrease as we expect to increase our overall revenue and receive increased government funding.\n\nMarketing and Sales\n\nMarketing and sales expenses were $14.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, compared to $14.9 million for the 2001 period. Marketing and sales expense were $20.0 million in 2001, $14.4 million in 2000 and $2.5 million in 1999. The increase in these expenses from 1999 to 2001 was due to the acquisition of the Cray Research business unit, which required us to re-establish the Cray sales and customer support staff and increase expenditures in connection with sales and marketing, benchmarks and development of third party applications software.\n\nWe expect quarterly marketing and sales expenses to grow modestly in the fourth quarter of 2002 and into 2003, but to decline as a percentage of revenue.\n\nGeneral and Administrative\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $6.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, compared to $6.3 million for the 2001 period. General and administrative expenses were $9.2 million for 2001, $7.0 million in 2000 and $3.1 million in 1999. The increase in these expenses from 1999 to 2001 was due to the acquisition of the Cray Research operations, which required us to add managerial and administrative staff and to incur increases in legal, accounting and consulting expenses in connection with establishing foreign operations and implementing new accounting systems.\n\nWe expect quarterly general and administrative expenses to grow modestly in the fourth quarter of 2002 and into 2003, but to decline as a percentage of revenue.\n\nRestructuring Charges\n\nRestructuring charges were $1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, compared to $1.3 million for the respective 2001 period and represent severance expenses related to the termination of 20 employees in the first quarter of 2002.\n\nWe incurred restructuring charges of $3.8 million in 2001. These charges were primarily for severance expenses related to the termination of 102 employees in the third and fourth quarters of 2001.\n\n20\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAs of December 31, 2001, we paid $1.3 million and the remaining $2.5 million is included in accrued payroll and related expenses.\n\nGoodwill\n\nWe incurred no amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, compared to $5.3 million for the 2001 period. Amortization expense relates to the goodwill resulting from the acquisition of the Cray Research business unit on April 1, 2000. Following the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142, we determined that there was no impairment related to goodwill as of January 1, 2002, and we will not record any further amortization of goodwill in 2002. See Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference in this prospectus from our 2001 Form 10-K Annual Report.\n\nWe incurred amortization expense of $7.0 million in 2001 and $5.2 million in 2000, primarily related to the goodwill and intangible assets from the acquisition of the Cray Research business unit.\n\nIn accordance with SFAS No. 142, the effect of this accounting change is reflected prospectively from January 1, 2002. Supplemental comparative disclosure as if the change had been retroactively applied in the prior year periods is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\nFor the Year Ended December 31, For the Nine Months Ended 1999 2000 2001 September 30, 2001\n\nReported net loss\n\n$ (34,532 ) $ (25,388 ) $ (35,228 ) $ (17,896 )\n\nPlus: goodwill amortization\n\n 5,217 6,981 5,318\n\nAdjusted net loss\n\n$ (34,532 ) $ (20,171 ) $ (28,247 ) $ (12,578 )\n\nReported basic and diluted net loss per share\n\n$ (1.74 ) $ (0.78 ) $ (0.87 ) $ (0.45 )\n\nPlus: goodwill amortization\n\n 0.16 0.17 0.13\n\nAdjusted basic and diluted net loss per share\n\n$ (1.74 ) $ (0.62 ) $ (0.70 ) $ (0.32 )\n\nOther Income (Expense)\n\nOther income was $2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, compared to other expense of $255,000 for the 2001 period. The increase in other income consisted primarily of a negotiated settlement of an accrued cancellation charge on a purchase commitment. See Accrued Loss on Purchase Commitment in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference in this prospectus from our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2002.\n\nOther expense was $336,000 for 2001 compared to other income of $675,000 for 2000, and other expense of $106,000 for 1999. Other income (expense) for 2001 and 2000 consisted primarily of realized gains and losses from the effects of foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nInterest Income (Expense)\n\nInterest income was $59,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, compared to $96,000 for the 2001 period. Interest income was $224,000 for 2001, $690,000 for 2000, and $537,000 for 1999. The higher amounts in 2000 and 1999 reflect our increased cash position due to the sales of equity securities in the first quarter of 2000, and in 1999.\n\nInterest expense was $1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, compared to $1.6 million for the 2001 period. Interest expense was $2.0 million for 2001, $2.4 million for 2000 and $815,000 for 1999. The interest expense for 2001 was largely due to a non-cash charge of $747,000 in the first quarter of 2001 associated with the value of the conversion feature of certain investor promissory notes, and a $225,000 non-cash charge for the value of options, also in the first quarter of 2001, compared to a non-cash\n\n21\n\nTable of Contents\n\ncharge of $435,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, associated with the convertible debenture financing completed in November 2001.\n\nThe increase in 2001 and 2000 over 1999 was largely due to $1.0 million of non-cash interest associated with the value of the conversion feature of certain investor promissory notes and $1.0 million of interest paid on our term loan, line of credit, capital lease and debt obligations in 2001. In 2000, we recognized imputed interest expense of $1.4 million on the non-interest bearing note issued to SGI, a non-cash interest expense of approximately $336,000 associated with the value of the conversion feature of certain investor promissory notes, a non-cash expense of $200,000 for the value of warrants issued in conjunction with investor promissory notes and $92,000 of interest paid on a line of credit.\n\nTaxes\n\nWe recorded a provision of $1.5 million for income taxes in foreign countries and certain states for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, compared to $961,000 for the 2001 period. There has been no provision for U.S. federal income taxes for any period.\n\nWe made a provision of $994,000 and $831,000 for international income taxes in 2001 and 2000, respectively. As of December 31, 2001, we had net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $137.1 million, of which approximately $323,000 expires in 2003, none expires in 2004 and the balance of approximately $136.8 million expires in years 2005 through 2021, if not utilized.\n\nNet Income (Loss)\n\nNet income was $4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2001, and net loss was $17.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2000. The improvement in net profit was due to increased product revenue, lower expenditures, principally research and development expenses, and the absence of goodwill amortization charges.\n\nOur net loss in 2001 of $35.2 million was greater than our net loss in 2000 of $25.4 million and $34.5 million in 1999. The 2001 net loss largely was due to lost revenue resulting from the delay in completing the SV1ex enhancements until late November 2001. The 2000 net loss includes a loss of $8.0 million during the first quarter, prior to our acquisition of the Cray Research business unit.\n\nWe expect that our revenues in 2003 will be at least $200 million and that our pre-tax net operating income will be in the range of 5% to 10% of revenue.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nCash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable totaled $52.6 million at September 30, 2002, compared to $37.1 million at December 31, 2001, and $30.5 million at December 31, 2000. Over that period, cash increased from $4.6 million to $27.4 million, while restricted cash balances, which serve as collateral for capital equipment loans and leases, decreased from $761,000 to $38,000. At September 30, 2002, we had working capital of $22.3 million compared to working capital deficits of $5.7 million at December 31, 2001, and $25.9 million at the end of 2000.\n\nThe reduction in net cash used in operating activities for the first nine months of 2002 of $4.5 million compared to $27.7 million for the first nine months of 2001 was primarily due to $4.1 million of net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, compared to a net loss of $17.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2001. For the nine months ended September 30, 2002, net operating cash was used primarily by increases in other assets and decreases in other accrued liabilities, warranty reserve and accounts payable.\n\nNet cash used by operating activities was $26.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to net cash provided of $5.1 million in 2000. For 2001, net operating cash flows were primarily attributed to our net loss, offset by depreciation and amortization, along with decreases in accounts payable and warranty\n\n22\n\nTable of Contents\n\nreserves. The increase in net cash used in operating activities in 2001 over 2000 was primarily attributed to the acquisition of the Cray Research business unit in April of 2000.\n\nNet cash used by investing activities was $5.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, compared to $8.7 million for the corresponding 2001 period. Net cash used by investing activities for the 2002 period consisted primarily of $3.9 million spent primarily for computers and electronic test equipment, computer software and furniture and fixtures, and $1.5 million for service spares. In the 2001 nine-month period, the net cash used in investing activities was primarily for electronic test equipment and computer hardware purchases. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $57.4 million for 2000, principally for the Cray Research acquisition.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $24.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, compared to $36.2 million for the corresponding 2001 period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2002, we raised $15.6 million through the sale of common stock and warrants, and received another $10.8 million through the exercise of warrants that otherwise would have expired. Net cash provided by financing activities was $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $47.0 million for 2000. In 2001, we raised $24.9 million through the sale of preferred stock to NEC, and in November we issued $9.3 million in convertible subordinated notes. We also obtained a three-year term loan of $7.5 million in 2001.\n\nOver the next twelve months, our significant cash requirements will relate to operational expenses, consisting primarily of personnel costs, costs of inventory and spare parts as we ramp-up production of Cray X1 systems, third-party engineering expenses, and acquisition of property and equipment. Our fiscal year 2003 capital expenditure budget for property and equipment is estimated currently at approximately $9.5 million. In addition, we lease certain equipment used in our operations under operating or capital leases in the normal course of business. We expect that operations over the next twelve months will generate positive cash flow. The following table is a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of September 30, 2002 (in thousands):\n\nPayments Due by Periods Less Than 1-3 4-5 After 5 Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year Years Years Years\n\nNotes payable\n\n$ 278 $ 278 $  $  $ \n\nTerm loan payable\n\n4,464 2,143 2,321  \n\nCapital lease obligations\n\n548 286 262  \n\nOperating leases\n\n20,147 3,134 8,762 5,500 2,751\n\nTotal contractual cash obligations\n\n$ 25,437 $ 5,841 $ 11,345 $ 5,500 $ 2,751\n\nAt any particular time, given the high average selling price of our products, our cash position is affected by the timing of payment for product sales, receipt of prepaid maintenance revenue and receipt of government funding of research and development activities. While we believe our current cash resources plus the net proceeds of this offering will be adequate for the next twelve months, we may need to raise additional equity or debt capital if we experience lower than anticipated product sales due to general economic conditions or delays in the availability of Cray X1 systems for customer deliveries and delays in the receipt of governmental funding, or require additional capital for increased production requirements for the Cray X1 system. In addition, we may raise additional capital to enhance our cash position and working capital position. Future financings may not be available to us when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms and may be dilutive to our shareholders.\n\n23\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBUSINESS\n\nWe design, develop, market and service high performance computer systems, commonly known as supercomputers. These systems provide capability and capacity far beyond typical mainframe computer systems and address the worlds most challenging computing problems for government, industry and academia. We expect that most of our 2003 product revenue will come from sales of our Cray X1 system, the production version of which first shipped in December 2002. In mid-2002 we began a development project with Sandia National Laboratories to design and deliver a new, high bandwidth, massively parallel processing supercomputer system called Red Storm in 2004. We provide maintenance services to the worldwide installed base of Cray computers. We also offer professional services that leverage our industry technical knowledge. Certain technical terms used herein are defined in the glossary of this prospectus.\n\nOur History\n\nIn many ways our current history began on April 1, 2000, when we, as Tera Computer Company, acquired the operating assets of the Cray Research division from SGI, and renamed ourselves Cray Inc.\n\nTera Computer\n\nTera Computer Company was founded in 1987 with the purpose of developing a new supercomputer system based on multithreaded architecture. We had an initial public offering in 1995. In 2000 we were still in the development stage with limited revenue from sales to one customer, the San Diego Supercomputer Center, and approximately 125 employees, almost all of whom were located in our Seattle office.\n\nCray Research\n\nCray Research was founded in 1972 by Seymour Cray and introduced its first product, the Cray-1, in 1976. Cray Research pioneered the use of vector systems in a variety of market sectors and dominated the supercomputer market in the late 1970s and 1980s. Cray Research introduced a series of vector based systems, including the Cray Y-MP, C90, J90, T90 and SV1 systems. Cray Research also developed leading high bandwidth massively parallel systems, notably the Cray T3D and T3E systems, using Alpha microprocessors from Digital Equipment and later Compaq Computer. In 1996, SGI acquired Cray Research and cancelled the development of the successors to the only two U.S. produced capability-class supercomputers at the time, the Cray T90 and T3E systems. In 1997, at the instigation of Cray Research, the U.S. government imposed extensive anti-dumping duties on Japanese vector supercomputers, effectively preventing them from competing in the U.S. market. SGI also moved a substantial number of the established Cray Research customers from Cray Research products to the SGI Origin line of products. In 1998 SGI and the Department of Defense entered into a cost-sharing contract for the development of the Cray X1 system (then code-named the SV2). In 1999 SGI announced that it would consider offers to purchase the Cray Research division.\n\nCray Research Acquisition\n\nOn April 1, 2000, we acquired the operating assets of the Cray Research business unit from SGI and changed our corporate name to Cray Inc. In that transaction, we acquired the Cray SV1, T3E and other product lines, the Cray X1 development project and related cost-sharing contract, a service organization supporting Cray supercomputers installed in about 200 sites in the United States and overseas, integration and final assembly operations, software products and related experience and expertise, approximately 775 employees, product and service inventory, real property located in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, and the Cray brand name. Pursuant to a technology agreement, SGI assigned to us various patents and other intellectual property and licensed to us the rights to other patents and intellectual property. We paid SGI $50.3 million in cash and issued SGI 1,000,000 shares of our common stock.\n\nAs part of the acquisition, we assumed responsibility for the cost of servicing the Cray T90 vector computers. We agreed with SGI that we would not utilize specified technology to develop successor products\n\n24\n\nTable of Contents\n\nto the T3E product line, and we agreed to limit our use of SGIs IRIX operating system to the Cray X1 product family.\n\nPost-Acquisition\n\nWith the acquisition, we had to integrate our approximately 900 employees into one company, establish company-wide financial, communication and other networks, move employees out of SGI facilities into new offices, establish over twenty subsidiaries for our foreign sales and service operations, and either have service, sales and other contracts assigned to us or enter into new contracts with customers and vendors.\n\nWe immediately focused most of our available financial resources on the continued development of the Cray X1 system to keep the development on track both in terms of system capability and schedule. A majority of our revenue in 2000 and 2001 came from maintenance services on the worldwide installed base of Cray products. In order to generate product revenue until the Cray X1 development was completed:\n\n we brought back the Cray T3E product from its end of life, with sales starting in the first quarter following the acquisition;  we continued to sell the Cray SV1 system and made processor and memory enhancements to it, resulting in the Cray SV1ex system which became available for sale in the fourth quarter of 2001; and  we continued development of our multithreaded architecture by re-implementing our Cray MTA-2 system in CMOS, a process essentially completed at the end of 2001.\n\nIn May 2001 the U.S. anti-dumping order was lifted, NEC invested $25 million in us through our Series A convertible preferred stock and we became a distributor of the NEC SX series of supercomputers, re-branded under the Cray name, with exclusive rights in North America and non-exclusive rights in the rest of the world. In mid-2002 we began a development project with Sandia National Laboratories to design and deliver a new supercomputer system called Red Storm in 2004. While we continue to market the Cray SV1ex, the Cray MTA-2 and the Cray SX-6 systems, we expect that most of our 2003 and 2004 product revenue will come from sales of the Cray X1 system, with a smaller portion from the Red Storm project. See  Product Offerings and Projects below.\n\nDiscussions that relate to periods prior to April 1, 2000, refer to our operations as Tera Computer Company, and discussions that relate to periods after April 1, 2000, refer to our combined operations as Cray Inc.\n\nThe High Performance Computer Industry\n\nSince the pioneering Cray-1 system arrived in 1976, supercomputers  defined simply as the most powerful class of computers at any time  have contributed substantially to the advancement of knowledge and the quality of human life. Problems of major economic, scientific and strategic importance typically are addressed by supercomputers, which usually sell for several millions of dollars each, years before becoming tractable with less capable systems. For scientific applications, the increased need for computing power has been driven by highly challenging problems that can be solved only through numerically intensive computation. For engineering applications, high performance computers boost productivity and decrease risk and the time to market for companies and products in a broad range of industries. The U.S. government has recognized that the continued development of high performance computer systems is of critical importance to the national defense and the economic, scientific and strategic competitiveness of the United States.\n\nIncreasing Demand for Supercomputer Power\n\nApplications promising future competitive and scientific advantage create a significant demand for more supercomputer power  10 to 1,000 times greater than anything available today, according to users. There are three principal drivers to the predicted substantial growth in the high performance computing market: the continuing need for advanced design capability, increased focus on national security issues and the recognized need for more powerful scientific research tools.\n\n25\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe need for design capabilities grows seemingly without limit. Automotive companies are targeting increased passenger cabin comfort, better fuel mileage and improved safety and handling. Aerospace firms envision more efficient planes and space vehicles. Using genomic and proteomic technologies for drug development are areas of intensive research and substantial spending by research centers and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.\n\nGovernments have a wide range of unmet security needs, heightened by the recent emphasis on anti-terrorism. These needs primarily relate to burgeoning cryptanalysis requirements arising from a more diverse and growing number of sources and requirements for rapid and accurate analysis and fusion of information from many disparate sources. In addition, governments need better simulation and modeling of a wide range of weapons and battlefield scenarios and the computational ability to address various classified applications.\n\nIn the spring of 2002, the Japanese government announced the completion of the Japanese Earth Simulator project. This high bandwidth vector-based system currently is acknowledged as the worlds most powerful installed computer system, with a peak speed of approximately 40 teraflops and high sustained operating performance on real applications. The Japanese Earth Simulator validates our proposition that high bandwidth and sustained performance are critical, and provides Japan with the opportunity to lead in scientific research in fields such as weather and climate, geophysics, nanotechnology and metallurgy.\n\nThe High Performance Computer Market\n\nInternational Data Corporation (IDC), a leading industry market research firm, provides information regarding the high performance computing technical systems market, including projections. IDC segments the technical systems market based on prices, complexity and intended use, with classes for capability, enterprise, divisional, and departmental systems. Our focus primarily is on the highest-priced ($1 million and up) capability segment where the features we are known for  high speed processors coupled with extreme communication speed  are needed to solve the worlds most difficult computing problems. There are also needs for supercomputing systems of our caliber in portions of the technical enterprise segment, especially in production-oriented environments.\n\nAccording to IDC, the 2001 combined capability and technical enterprise market totaled approximately $1.9 billion. We believe that our addressable portion of this total is approximately $1.2 billion. In our addressable portion in 2001, in approximate percentages, IBM led with 31%, followed by Hewlett-Packard with 22%, NEC with 16%, SGI with 15%, Fujitsu with 9%, and Cray with 7%.\n\nThe annual revenue for capability class systems historically has fluctuated as much as 25% due to new product introductions, large system procurements and government funding cycles. The expected growth from 2001 to 2006 in our target market, based on data from IDC, is from approximately $1.2 billion to about $1.9 billion, an annual growth rate of around 10%.\n\nAgain using data provided by IDC, our 2001 addressable market can be divided into the following usage-based segments: scientific research - 40%, biosciences - 20%, design engineering - 15%, classified/defense - 15% and other - 10%.\n\nScientific Research. This sector includes government laboratories and research centers that may also collaborate with university consortia to reach their objectives. These centers investigate computational modeling of a broad range of physical phenomena in such fields as astrophysics, chemistry, materials science, nuclear fusion and particle physics. Weather forecasting and climate modeling comprise about one-fourth of this market. The scientific research sector requires supercomputers with increasing levels of throughput and faster turn-around time, system robustness and the ability to process large volumes of data. With the success of the Japanese Earth Simulator, the U.S. Department of Energy has indicated its intention to support a\n\n26\n\nTable of Contents\n\ncompetitive U.S. response. If this initiative is funded, the revenue in the scientific research segment will increase accordingly.\n\nBiosciences. Since the mapping of the human genome, there has been an explosion in the volume of genomic and proteomic data available. High performance computers are used to predict molecular structure at various levels of detail based on these data and to search genomic and proteomic data for structural similarities among and across individuals and species.\n\nDesign Engineering. Simulation of new products before they are built is an invaluable industrial tool. The automotive sector uses simulation to design lighter, safer and more durable vehicles. In the aerospace sector, software running on supercomputers simulates flight dynamics as well as aspects similar to those of the automotive sector. Government agencies such as NASA and the Department of Defense employ these techniques to improve design effectiveness, improve product quality and decrease the time to deployment.\n\nClassified/ Defense. According to IDC forecasts, the long-term spending on national defense and homeland security is expected to inc"
