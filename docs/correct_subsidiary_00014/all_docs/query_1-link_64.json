        "text": "- Five years after the late computing pioneer Seymour Cray founded Colorado Springs-based SRC Computers Inc., the company is on the verge of rolling out its first products.\n\nDon't look for them at Circuit City. These computers are designed to sort through problems as complex as a strand of DNA, and compute answers at dizzying speeds.\n\nThey are used in scientific and academic laboratories and commercial businesses to calculate everything from weather forecasts to the power of nuclear explosions. The price: $1 million and up.\n\n\"We'll be bidding on systems that might go into several hundred millions,\" said Greg Fenner, the firm's president and chief executive officer. At the heart of SRC's computers is technology that could win it a serious chunk of a market valued at $4 billion a year, said Earl Joseph II, research director with market research firm IDC in St. Paul, Minn. Demand for the machines is growing anywhere from 3 percent to 12 percent annually, depending on how they're used. SRC's computers will be built around chips as common as the ones in a desktop PC. Hundreds of Intel Corp. chips will be arrayed in each computer.\n\nBut the combination of hardware and software driving the systems and the way they're designed will supercharge the chips' ability to solve problems. Fenner predicts SRC's computers will clock speeds up to thousands of times faster than even the swiftest machines now can reach.\n\nThose are speeds that would make Cray, considered the daddy of the supercomputer, a happy man. The inventor, who died of injuries sustained in a car crash in 1996, devoted his life to speeding up computers.\n\nOver more than 30 years of work his name grew synonymous with supercomputing. But SRC will play in a market where competition among a small number of industry heavyweights is fierce. Compaq, IBM, NEC, Fujitsu, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, and Silicon Graphics all offer high-speed computers. Each of them has staked out a piece of the market, with IBM leading the pack among more specialized machines used by scientists and for some particularly tricky engineering problems, said Joseph.\n\nIn 1999, H-P and Compaq made the bulk of sales to more generalized customers like automobile makers that use the computers to design their vehicles, said Joseph. SRC's technology is cutting-edge in the supercomputer business, said Gary Montry, chief executive officer of Southwest Parallel Software in Albuquerque.\n\nThe company isn't alone in exploiting new technology. Mountain View, Calif.-based Silicon Graphics Inc., is planning to roll out a system in the near future that also is expected to top the best speeds now available, said John Towns, division director for scientific computing at the National Center for Super Computing Applications at the University of Illinois. In fact, most of the companies are moving toward solutions similar to the one SRC is using, Towns said.\n\nThough SRC was founded by Cray, the company has no track record and arrives on the scene a relative unknown.\n\n\"We have been in a tight market so they're going to have to fight a little bit to get in,\" Towns said. Cray's reputation won't hurt the firm's case. In the 1950s, Cray began replacing bulky vacuum tubes used in computers with transistors, leading the way toward the subsequent miniaturization of electronics.\n\nIn 1972, he founded Cray Research where he developed supercomputers that quickly became the standard by which others were judged. His computers held that position for years. Cray Research became too large and bureaucratic for him and in 1989, he left to form Cray Computer Inc. in Colorado Springs. He continued working to develop another generation of supercomputers using circuits made with gallium arsenide, which held promise as a faster alternative to silicon chips. As demand for supercomputers slacked off after the end of the Cold War, his firm faced difficulty raising money on the stock market and went bankrupt. Two months before he died at 71 he launched SRC.\n\n\"We think we'll build computers, but who knows what kind or how,\" he told the Colorado Springs Gazette Telegraph when he launched SRC.\n\nThe company's computers are enhanced versions of Cray's last design, Fenner said. Five years may sound like a long time to bring a product to market, but it's not unusual for supercomputers.\n\n\"They're very complex systems and it takes a long time to build them,\" said Towns. Companies have to write software that acts as a framework for their machines. That in itself is a time-consuming task, said Montry.\n\nDeveloping the computers is expensive, too. Though Fenner said his firm has spent less than $50 million, design and development of high-performance computers can cost more than $100 million, Montry said. \"Seymour's legacy was simple elegance and we have seen that in the amount of money we needed to spend,\" Fenner said.\n\nFenner wouldn't discuss the privately-held company's funding stream other than to say that the cash comes from a group of well-heeled individuals.\n\nHe expects to take the company public within three years.\n\n\"When you're selling a multimillion dollar piece of equipment, you can grow very fast.\"\n\nSRC's first computer is expected to roll out in the early spring. The company already has been pitching its wares to potential customers, a group that includes government, academic and scientific laboratories, drug companies and other businesses that have to unravel complex problems.\n\nThough the company will initially target traditional supercomputer customers, the Internet also could provide a niche for the hardware, said IDC's Joseph. The computers could deliver customers access to databases containing clips of every movie ever made, for instance, and do it cheaper than others on the market, Joseph said.\n\nSRC will expand as the company goes into its new production stage. The number of employees, now 50, is expected to double by the end of the year and the firm plans to move into larger digs than the 24,000 square feet it now occupies. The company doesn't plan to manufacture the hardware itself. Instead, SRC will contract with Microelectronics, a St. Paul, Minn. manufacturer, to produce the computers.\n\n\"We want to focus on what we do best, which is designing and marketing these things,\" Fenner said."
