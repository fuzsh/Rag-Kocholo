Clark, who left in early 1994 to head Mosaic Communications, which became Netscape Communications. SGI's quarterly sales in August 1994 was $433 million, with profits of $44 million.[1] In 1996, it acquired supercomputer designer Cray Research.[2]\n\nDecline and bankruptcy[]\n\nHowever, amid declining sales, Silicon Graphics was forced to lay off over 1,000 of its staff and sell its Cray subsidiary in 2002.[2] The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2009 and was sold to Rackable Systems.[3]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nSilicon Graphics official website (archived 2011-05-07, 1997-04-12)\n\nSilicon Graphics at Wikipedia\n\nArticles[]\n\nWhatever Happened to SGI? at Wired (2004-11-26)"
