Silicon Graphics Inc. said Monday it agreed to acquire struggling supercomputer-maker Cray Research Inc. for $783 million, creating a computing giant with about $4 billion in revenues.

Silicon Graphics said it will pay $30 a share for about 75 percent of Cray Research stock, or about $576 million for 19.2 million shares, in the first part of a two-step transaction that includes cash and stock. The computer maker said that, after the initial tender offer, which is expected to begin this week, it will later exchange one share of its stock for each remaining share of Cray Research.

The deal combines Silicon Graphics' prowess in powerful, 3D graphics computers known as workstations with Cray's expertise in multimillion-dollar supercomputers used by weather forecasters, the Defense Department and other researchers.

Since its founding in 1972, Eagan, Minn.-based Cray has become synonymous with supercomputers, the worlds's most powerful computational machines.

However, the company has struggled for several years as procurement budgets have been cut by its biggest customer, the U.S. government.

"The combination of Silicon Graphics and Cray Research will create the world's leading high-performance computing company," Silicon Graphics Chairman Edward McCracken said in a statement announcing the deal.
