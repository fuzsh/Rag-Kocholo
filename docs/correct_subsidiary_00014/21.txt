Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) was a manufacturer of workstations and software for graphics and image processing.

History[]

SGI was founded on November 9, 1981 by Dr. James H. Clark, who left in early 1994 to head Mosaic Communications, which became Netscape Communications. SGI's quarterly sales in August 1994 was $433 million, with profits of $44 million.[1] In 1996, it acquired supercomputer designer Cray Research.[2]

Decline and bankruptcy[]

However, amid declining sales, Silicon Graphics was forced to lay off over 1,000 of its staff and sell its Cray subsidiary in 2002.[2] The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2009 and was sold to Rackable Systems.[3]
