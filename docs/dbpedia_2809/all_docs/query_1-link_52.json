        "text": "Richard ''Rick\" Jacobchick, 89, of Mandan. passed away Saturday, August 3, 2024 at Miller Pointe in Mandan.\n\nMass of Christian Burial will be held 10:30 A.M., Thursday, August 8, 2024 at Christ the King Catholic Church, Mandan, with Father Fred Harvey celebrating. Burial will be in the North Dakota Veterans Cemetery.\n\nVisitation will be Wednesday, August 7, 2024, from 5:00 â€“ 7:00 P.M. at Christ the King Catholic Church, with a Rosary/Parish Vigil at 7:00 P.M. Visitation will continue at the church one hour prior to the service on Thursday.\n\nOn April 20, 1935 Rick was born to Frank and Cele (LeDuc) in Oakes, ND.\n\nAt an early age, his father, the manager of the J.C. Penny Store in Oakes, told Rick, \"You be honest and nice to people, and they'll be nice to you.\" His father also instilled in him that if he was going to be in business, he had to be prepared to give. Judging from his history, Rick took his father's advice to heart. He has been deeply involved in a long list of activities: the Mandan Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors, the Mandan Chamber Ambassadors, the Mandan Elks Lodge, the First SW Bank of Mandan Board of Directors, the Bismarck-Mandan Development associations, the Mandan Beautification Task Force, District 34 Republicans, the Bismarck-Mandan United Way Board and his favorite, the Board of the Morton County Housing Corporation. He was instrumental in organizing the Mandan Progress Organization. Also, he has been an active member of Christ the King Parish.\n\nRick hasn't always been a Mandan mover and shaker. In 1951 his life changed. That summer the family moved to Mandan, and by the time his junior year began he had been absorbed into the local teen life. He thought Mandan was \"awesome\" and jumped into the basketball and football programs at school.\n\nWhile he was in high school, Rick began working for Lee Mohr Photography. To this day, he thinks perhaps he should have stayed in photography, but other jobs came his way. Proudly, he joined the North Dakota National Guard and served for 12 years. Also, he worked at the Amoco Oil Refinery from 1954 to 1964. Then in 1964, before the interstate highway was built, he and Dick and Lorraine Froelich started the Sunset Service Center, where he worked until 1969. That year, Rick and Don Russell combined forces in a new business, Speedy's Tire Service. In 1981, when Don decided to devote his full energies to Cloverdale, Rick bought him out and continued to run the business, making it a long-time fixture in downtown Mandan.\n\nThanks to the family's early move to Mandan, Rick met his high school sweetheart, Rosemary. On July 14, 1955, they were united in marriage. To this unity, they had 3 children, Pam, Steve, and Jeff. The Rick and Rosemary team shared a steadfast devotion to their family. Rosemary died on December 27, 2013, ending a long romance. Years ago, he told Rosemary he would like to move to Liberty Heights one day, now sadly, he would move without her to the community to which he had given years of time and effort.\n\nA special thank you to Darwin and Irene Vandervorst for their wonderful friendship.\n\nRick will be deeply missed by his children, Pam (Dave) Helbling of Fargo, ND, Steve (Erna) Jacobchick of Maple Grove, MN, and Jeff (Shirley) Jacobchick of Bismarck, ND; 11 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents; his wife, Rosemary; and sister, Donna Ferrell.\n\nMemorials in Rick's name are suggested to benefit Christ the King School or the North Dakota Veterans Cemetery."
