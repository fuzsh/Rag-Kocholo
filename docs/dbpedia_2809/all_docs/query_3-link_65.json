        "text": "Thanks to a Chronic Fatigue flair up, I have been trying to read as many comics as possible to take my mind off of the pain. This finally led me to finally read Daredevil: Born Again. It’s been on my shelf for several years, along with Daredevil Yellow, and Daredevil: The Man Without Fear, but I just hadn’t gotten around to it. I had just finished the first volume of Daredevil by Chip Zdarsky, and since I don’t have volume 2, I just needed to find something that filled the void. Which meant that it was finally time to crack open Born Again.\n\nI’d seen Matt Draper’s video on the story a while ago, and I had a basic idea of the plot, but beyond ‘Karen Page sells Matt’s secret identity for drugs, and the King pin now tries to ruin Matt’s life’, I was largely unsure of what would happen.\n\nI walked away with a newfound appreciation for the work of Frank Miller as a writer, and particularly Dave Mazzuchelli’s art. The story is indeed compelling, and one where you can easily see why it’s so lorded by fans. The weight of everything happening to Matt feels real and plausible, it’s not hard to see someone fall so quickly. The same is true for Karen. The depths she sinks to just to get her next fix, you feel her desperation and understand both why she did it, and just how horrible she must be feeling. As good as the story is as a whole, the moment that really stands out to me is with the reporter Ben Urich as he tries to investigate just why someone would want to frame Matt Murdock.\n\nDuring #230: Born Again, reporter Ben Urich receives a call from the Lieutenant who initially accused Matt of jury tampering. The Lieutenant having done it only to afford the operation his young son desperately needs. With his son now dead regardless, and sitting in a hospital bed, the Lieutenant calls Ben Urich to go on record and clear Matt’s name. During the call however, the phone line goes quiet. The nurse now takes hold of the phone and says to Urich, ‘My employer would like you to hear this, Mr. Urich’. While the sound of the office continues in the background, Urich is horrified by the sound of the Lieutenant slowly having the life choked out of him. The look of horror on Urich’s face as the last gasps of life are heard is truly terrifying. The normality of the environment around him, someone calling for the copyboy, someone else asking if Mr Finch is finished with his piece. All that normality, and yet Ben is hearing a man die on the other end of the phone. The framing, colour in Urich’s face, and that juxtaposition between the office and the hospital. It creates a feeling of dread like no other.\n\nAs the Lieutenant dies, the nurse says one more thing before hanging up the phone.\n\n‘I thank you for listening, Mr Urich.’\n\nA line so simple but chilling that it leaves you feeling just as cold and horrified as Urich must feel.\n\nThe Man of Steel #37 [Simonson & Bogdanove.1994] acts as a tie in to the then current event comic Zero Hour: Crisis in Time [Jurgens & Ordway.1994]. As such, the issue deals with the fall out of the event, and how time is being disrupted. In this case, the focus is on variations of Batman being disrupted through time and showing up in Metropolis. Interestingly, the issue doesn’t just use an intertextual approach by changing Batman’s costume to match the reference, which would have been the simplest option. But instead, they chose to render these various Batmen in a style that replicates the eras they are from. Noticeably, the work of Neal Adams, Frank Miller and Bob Kane.\n\nFor an early 70s interpretation, the creative team chose to mimic the work of Neal Adams. One of the minds behind Batman villains Man-Bat [Robbins & Adams.1970] and Ra’s Al Ghul [O’Neil & Adams.1971], as well as the artist behind the landmark issue The Joker’s Five-Way Revenge! [O’Neil & Adams.1973]. Neal’s style is heavily detailed, which was uncommon for the era, but his work is so intrinsically tied to that period in comics, especially given the works Superman vs. Muhammad Ali [O’Neil & Adams.1978], and Green Lantern/Green Arrow #85: Snowbirds Don’t Fly [O’Neil & Adams.1971]. In Man of Steel #37, the art emulates Adams’s style, most noticeably in the use of facial expressions. Layouts even attempt to mimic Adams’s issues when specifically focused on his Batman.\n\nThe appearance of a Frank Miller inspired Batman is interesting. While clearly taken from The Dark Knight Returns [Miller & Janson.1986], which was released in 1986, the story itself is set in the future with a much older Batman.This is used to great effect though, as it allows the ‘breaking of time’ theme to feel less one sided and firmly routed in the past. For including Miller’s style, the colouring in particular is well used. Using not only a similar palette, but it’s uses of shading.\n\nFinally, the inclusion of the Bob Kane interpretation from Batman’s first appearance, Detective Comics #27 [Finger & Kane.1939]. This version is perhaps the most obvious. The heavily simplistic style, and drastic change in costume make his appearance stand out far more than any of the other incarnations.\n\nTaking these creators specifically seems to be the most appropriate when discussing a character like Batman through time. His first appearance, his rise in popularity, and arguably his most well-known issue. The specific use of art style however, directly evokes these issues, and gives the reader a greater sense of the character being taken out of time. However, the question now arises. If this were a readers first experience of the character, would they get that they are from different eras just by looking at the style? When it comes to the first appearance Batman, it’s highly likely given the simplistic style. With Adams, I feel that this is less noticeable given how detailed his artwork is. While it’s certainly different from the main style of the issue, it’s not that dissimilar from other works you would find in the mid-90s. Finally, with Miller, the link between time would come more from the rendering of Batman himself. He appears bigger and generally older than the others.\n\nFinger, B. & Kane, B.

DC Comics: Burbank\n\nGoing through paperbacks and hardcovers, I’ve been creating a database of all the single issues and where they can be found. All the writers and artists, what year the issues come from, and creating a timeline of events in the Batman franchise. It’s a fun and incredibly informative exercise, but it does lead way to an interesting question. Was Jason Todd always supposed to die?\n\nFamously, the fate of Jason Todd, the second Robin, was decided by the fans. During the publication of the story arc Death in the Family, DC gave readers two numbers to call to vote on weather or not Jason would survive both a beating from the Joker and an explosion. Fans voted to kill him off, though there are rumours that it was one person who had programmed their phone to dial the ‘death’ number every 90 seconds.\n\nHowever, it feels like a number of stories involving Jason as Robin strongly hinted at him not lasting long. It’s possible I’m seeing this because I know what happens to him, and I’m making associations that aren’t really there. But it’s difficult to ignore.\n\nJason Todd’s post-Crisis origin was told in Batman #408 (1987). Twenty-One issues later, in Batman #429 (1988)we reach the end of Death in the Family. Making Todd’s tenue as Robin very short compared to others, with possibly only Stephanie Brown holding the title for less time.\n\nInterestingly, the name of Jason’s first issue is Did Robin Die Tonight? Granted, the title is referring to Dick Grayson, as the media mistaking believes that Robin died in the issues event. But it’s a hell of an issue title to introduce the new Robin with. A year before this, we had the infamous Dark Knight Returns (1986)by Frank Miller. Granted, he’s referring to the Pre-Crisis, blonde haired Jason, but during the first issue, Bruce make’s reference to Jason having died, with his uniform on display in the cave in his memory and as a reminder to Bruce. That’s already a rough start for Jason’s career.\n\nPerhaps given the state of Batman comics at the time, Jason while Robin was involved in some brutal storylines. The Cult (1988)being the strongest that comes to mind. Made especially brutal by the wonderful art by Bernie Wrightson. Despite his short time in the position, Jason had so much brutality to go through. In Detective Comics #571 (1987), Both Batman and Jason find themselves heavily exposed to Scarecrow’s fear toxin. Batman finds himself terrified that he might lose Jason, the story even ends with Batman seeing the grave of Jason Todd.\n\nIn Jason’s last appearance before Death in the Family, he finds a group of criminals holding a girl hostage, having beaten her, and it’s heavily hinted to have raped her to. By the issues end, it’s hinted that Jason is the one responsible for the criminal’s death. With everything Jason goes through up until this point, is it any wonder that he would do that?\n\nWhile it’s mostly in small hints, and possibly reading far too much into things. It does feel like DC were setting Jason up to die, or at least be put out of his misery. We may never know if the plan was to introduce him just to kill him. But it feels like Jason was handed an unlucky life from the moment of his creation.\n\nSuperman #76: The Mightiest Team in the World\n\nMay/June 1952\n\nWriter: Edmond Hamilton\n\nPenciller: Curt Swan\n\nInker: John Fischetti\n\nWhen it comes to the icons that are Batman and Superman, the question that often comes up is ‘Who would win in a fight?’. When people ask for stories involving the pair, it’s usually stories of them at opposite ends. 1986 “saw the publication of Frank Miller’s historic miniseries The Dark Knight Returns [Miller.1986], with its revamping of the two heroes’ relationship. Since then, things have been a little strained to say the least between the two superheroes” [Anders.2005]. Miller presents an older Batman going up against Superman in the final act, as one is continuing illegal vigilante work, while the other is now a ‘lapdog’ to the President. Another notable example is Batman: Hush [Loeb & Lee.2003] which includes a notable scene of the pair fighting, while Superman is under the control of Poison Ivy. Even on a cinematic level, the first time the two met on the big screen, excluding animated outings, was in a film explicitly titled Batman Vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice [Snyder.2016]. It seems that our fascination with these two heroes when together, is that of conflict. However, this raises the question. Have they always been at each other’s throats?\n\nWhile they had previously appeared in the same issue in 1941’s All Star Comics #7 [Fox, et.al.1941]. Batman and Superman first met face to face in 1952’s Superman #76 [Hamilton & Swan.1952]. Despite the cover depicting Batman and Superman almost fighting over who gets to save Lois Lane from an oncoming train. The two become fast friends in the 12-page story contained within. The closest to an argument the pair engage in, is one partly planned by the two and somewhat encouraged by Lois.\n\nThe story opens with a text box addressing this monumental issue. “Superman, might man of steel whose super-powers have conquered catastrophes and wrecked wrongdoers! Batman, hooded foe of crime whose flashing feats have crushed crooks for years! Are any two names in the world more famous than these? Yet these two mighty champions of the right have never met – until now! Yes, at long last Superman and Batman meet face to face on a voyage of peril – and strange and startling is the outcome when two legendary figures form… The mightiest team in the world!” [Hamilton & Swan.1952:01]. The issue follows Batman and Superman as they have both independently booked spots on a cruise in their civilian identities. Due to over booking, Bruce and Clark end up being bunk mates and both start to worry about the other finding out their secret identity. When a fire breaks out on the docks, the lights go out and they both change, but as light comes in through the window, their identities are discovered. They worked together to stop those that started the fire, and while they got away, it’s discovered that a diamond has been stolen. It’s believed that the criminal is on board the ship as one of the passengers. Batman and Superman decide to continue their cruise as their secret identities. Problem is that now Lois Lane has decided to tag along in hopes of getting a scoop from both Batman and Superman. The pair come up with different tricks and tactics to hide their switching places. Pretending Clark is sea sick and in bed, using port holes to sneak back in. Even Superman flying Batman back to Gotham overnight, so no one would notice that Batman and Bruce Wayne were not out of town at the same time once the heroes have supposedly left the ship.\n\nThe pair show a high level of respect and admiration for each other. Their level of trust and comradery feels natural. Even the final take down of the crooks, a sort of Superman/Batman “Fast Ball Special” ala, Wolverine/Colossus. Shows an incredible level of confidence and skill. While the pair do team up every now and then. There is always this notion that one doesn’t always trust the other. That it’s easy for them to bicker, or even be on opposing sides.\n\nLooking back at their first team up is an incredibly refreshing experience. The thrill of seeing the two side by side when the issue originally came out must have been a dream come true for readers of the time. While we see them together often now, the spirit of this first meeting seems to have been forgotten.\n\nAnders, L. (2005) A Tale of Two Orphans: The Man of Steel vs. The Caped Crusader.

The star of campy 60s tv shows, multiple big budget films, critically acclaimed video games, generation defining cartoons, and almost 80 years of comics. It’s easy to become engrained with the world surrounding the Batman without ever picking up a book, but those who choose to, know the great depth and wealth of stories available. While the works of Alan Moore (The Killing Joke), Frank Miller (The Dark Knight Returns), and Grant Morrison (Arkham Asylam: A Serious House on Serious Earth) are often among the first recommended to new comers. They are far from the only must-read material.\n\nWith 78 years of history, here are 9 stories NOT by Moore, Morrison or Miller, that are more than worth your time…\n\nBatman: The Long Halloween (1996 – 97) by Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale\n\nSet early in Batman’s career, The Long Halloween follows a yearlong investigation into a mysterious killer known as Holiday. A vicious killer who strikes ever holiday, once a month. With the assistance of Captain Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent, Batman races against the clock to figure out who it is that’s committing the murders, and try to save the next victim. Along the way we encounter many members of Batman’s famous rogue gallery, including Scarecrow, The Joker, and Poison Ivy, as well as the slow transformation and creation of Two Face.\n\nAvailable here: Batman: The Long Halloween by Loeb, Jeph (2011) Paperback\n\nBatman: The Cult (1988) by Jim Starlin and Bernie Wrightson\n\nPossibly one of the most brutal Batman stories written, The Cult focusses on the kidnapping and attempted brainwashing of Batman by Deacon Blackfire, and his army of homeless followers. During Batman’s absence, Gotham city has been driven into turmoil, as politicians are assassinated by Blackfire’s followers. Attempts are made on Commissioner Gordon’s life, leaving him hospital bound, and martial law is declared in Gotham, as the city decays. The books tone is helped phenomenally by the art of the late Bernie Wrightson, and is a story that is remarkably hard to shake after reading.\n\nAvailable here: Batman The Cult TP\n\nBatman Hush (2002 – 2003) by Jeph Loeb and Jim Lee\n\nBatman is being stalked. The culprit’s identity, unknown. His intent seems to sabotage Batman’s every move, and something about him seems to know Bruce Wayne intimately. Complete with a large number of guest appearances by Batman’s rogue gallery, and the inclusion of Superman, Hush contains an all-star cast, for a truly interesting mystery. Including the incredible detail of Jim Lee’s art, the story is rather hit and miss among fans, but still an interesting read just to uncover the mystery.\n\nAvailable here:Batman Hush Complete TP\n\nBatman Black and White (1996) by Various\n\nA wonderful example of what happens when you give creative minds just a few pages, and complete free rein of the Batman world and characters. With an incredible array of talent from Bruce Timm (Batman: The Animated Series), Neal Adams (Superman: Kryptonite Nevermore), Simon Bisley (Judge Dredd), Katsuhiro Otomo (Akira), Alex Ross (Kingdom Come), and more! It’s hard to find a more intriguing, varied, and fascinating creative pool of tales.\n\nAvailable here: Batman Black And White TP Vol 01 New Edition (Batman Black & White)\n\nBatman: New 52 Run (2011 – 2016) by Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo\n\nIt’s hard to pick just one story from this incredible run. The opening arc Court of Owls was an unbelievable debut. Death of the family was chilling to the bone. Zero Year gave us a truly interesting interpretation of Batman’s first year active. Even Jim Gordon’s turn in the suit was notably interesting, even if a little strange. The 52 issues of Batman from Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo are a must read, particularly for those looking to inject just a little bit of horror to their Batman. The pair are currently re-teaming for the Dark Metal event, but it’s this run that made them both synonymous with the Bat.\n\nAvailable Here: Batman Volume 1: The Court of Owls TP (The New 52) (Batman (DC Comics Paperback))\n\nBatman and Robin: New 52 Run (2011 – 2015) by Peter Tomasi and Patrick Gleason\n\nDespite his role as a surrogate father figure to all the Robins. When it comes to the 5th Robin, Damian Wayne, there’s no surrogate about it. The 40-issue run by Peter Tomasi and Patrick Gleason explores Bruce and Damian’s relationship with one another while working as partners. The battle-hardened Batman having to work with, and train his own bloodthirsty son. One who sees himself as greater than his father. Ready to kill those in his way, boast of his assassination skills. Tomasi and Gleason are masters at the father/son dynamic. Something they are currently exploring over in the Superman title. But their work with Bruce and Damian stands just as strong.\n\nAvailable here: Batman and Robin Volume1: Born to Kill TP (The New 52) (Batman & Robin (Paperback))\n\nDetective Comics #27 (1939)/Batman #1 (1940)\n\nOn the list more for history buffs than anything, but still two incredibly important issues in Batman’s life time. His first appearance in 1939, and the first appearance of both The Joker, and Catwoman in 1940. Certainly not the best that Batman has to offer, but hugely important. Learning the history behind these two issues, does add an extra layer of enjoyment. Did you know, The Joker was supposed to die in his first appearance? Or the story of Bill Finger, the long ignored co-creator and writer of these historic stories.\n\nAvailable here: Batman The Golden Age TP Vol 1\n\nBatman: Dark Victory (1999 – 2000) by Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale\n\nA sequel to The Long Halloween, though heavily enjoyable on its own. The same creative team takes the next step in Batman’s early years, and tackles the origin of the young Dick Grayson. The first Robin. The story deals heavily with the themes of isolation and loneliness, especially after the events of The Long Halloween. Affecting not only Batman, but the now traumatised and orphaned Dick Grayson, and the struggling Commissioner Gordon.\n\nAvailable here: Batman: Dark Victory (New Edition)\n\nBatman: Death in the Family (1988 – 89) by Jim Starlin and Jim Aparo\n\nHeavily controversial at the time it was released, and still a major talking point when discussing fan outcry and involvement. Death in the Family is a defining point in Batman’s career. The death of Jason Todd, the second Robin. Another death that Bruce couldn’t prevent. A death he feels heavily responsible for. Death in the Family also holds a significant point in pop culture history as the moment where fans killed Robin. DC held a call-in poll to help decide whether or not Jason would make it out of the story alive, dying with just a hand full of votes separating the options. The death of Jason is an important moment in not only Batman’s history, but in comics and pop culture. Much like Detective Comics #27 and Batman #1, not a great story, but hugely important.\n\nAvailable here: Batman: A Death in the Family (Batman (1940-2011))\n\nThese are just a handful of amazing stories of the Caped Crusader to try, aside from The Dark Knight Returns, Year One, The Killing Joke, or Batman and Robin. Batman’s history now spans almost 80 years, and it’s incredibly unlikely that his popularity will fade. There are still plenty of stories to be told in Gotham.\n\nAvoid All-Star Batman and Robin, the Boy Wonder….\n\n(Above is the opinion of the writer solely. Everyone is entitle to their own opinion, this is just mine. I have not read every Batman story in existence.)"
