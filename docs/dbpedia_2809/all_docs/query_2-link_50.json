        "text": "The great thing about creating a list of the ten essential Frank Miller books is that I got to look back over more than two decades of incredible work. The bad thing is that Frank Miller truly has far more essential books than a mere ten. I could have made a list of 20 easily. So here's the caveat before you read the list: This is not intended to be the \"Best of Frank Miller.\" Were that so, some of these books would have been left off and other put in their place. Instead, this list is a starting point for people who may not be familiar with all of Miller's work.\n\nIn some instances, I chose the first book in a series over the best book. I always hate backtracking as a reader, as I'm sure you do too. I attempted to pull in a good variation of Miller stories rather than just listing every Sin City book or Daredevil trade. I love Family Values, I love Hard Boiled, but they were left off the list as were many other greats.\n\nBelow are ten books every comic-book fan needs to read before they go blind (Sin City just isn't the same in brail). Included are some other books that should also be read, but simply aren't spotlighted. If you haven't read these ten, get cracking. You won't be sorry.\n\n300\n\nBased on a true story (and now a major motion picture), 300 is a fictionalized retelling of the famous battle of Thermopylae. In 480 BC the Persian army, which numbered in the tens of thousands, looked to conquer a divided Greece. Three-hundred Spartans stood before an army and held them at bay, wore them down and put up an historic fight. Their sacrifice inspired a country. Though Miller's telling takes a few liberties, this is an insightful view of the Spartan army and of uncompromised valor.\n\nThis is a unique work from Frank Miller. It's still gritty and bloody as so many of Miller's works, but moves with a different purpose. Collected in a horizontal format to preserve the incredible artwork from Miller and Lynn Varley, the hardback edition is currently out of print, but worth seeking out.\n\nBatman: The Dark Knight Returns\n\nDeservedly called the best damn Batman story ever told. The Dark Knight Returns takes place in the not-too-distant future. Batman's gone into seclusion and Gotham's gone to hell. A mixture of noir cynicism and wild west bravado, DKR offers an intense study of Batman, his city and the public's perception of heroes. Along the way old man Bruce is joined by everyone's favorite Robin, the spunky Carrie Kelly. Key to the story is Batman's oldest foe, the Joker, and his greatest rival, Superman. Boy Blue has become a tool for the man (perennially re-elected Ronald Reagan) and in the end comes to pick a fight with the over-the-hill Bat. What follows is a scene that can never be forgotten.\n\nMiller's since done better art, but his writing was never more insightful or more pure than with DKR. There are two comic books that every person should read. Watchmen is one, DKR is the other.\n\nAlso Worth Reading:\n\nBatman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again\n\nBatman: Year One\n\nThe original Batman was a bad ass for his time. But thanks to the success of the campy '60s TV show, Batman's comic book image went soft for well over a decade. While Frank Miller isn't the only person responsible for putting the \"dark\" back in the Dark Knight, he deserves much of the credit. Though nearly two decades have passed, no writer or work has since captured the essence of Batman as Miller has here. Along with Alan Moore's Watchmen, Batman: Year One helped bring sophistication to comics. More importantly, it's an incredibly well-written documentary of Batman's first year.\n\nMiller realizes that Batman is the opposite of Superman. He was made from the streets, he lives and fights below the skyline. He is motivated by fear and anger and without super powers, he has only his wits and his skill to keep from getting killed. Every Batman writer of the past 20 years owes Miller a debt of gratitude and so do comic-book readers.\n\nAlso Worth Reading:\n\nBatman: Black and White\n\nBig Guy & Rusty the Boy Robot\n\nFrank Miller shows a softer side with one of his few kid-appropriate works. To be honest, it's Geof Darrow's incredibly detailed work that really stands out in this oversized book, but Miller deserves credit for telling a solid story. First and foremost, Big Guy & Rusty the Boy Robot has, well, giant friggin' robots, aliens, and an enormous city to admire. It's a buddy tale, a coming of age story and a passing of the guard yarn all rolled into one. For years Big Guy has been his city's protector, but a new, more efficient robot has been created to take his place. They call him Astrobo--errr Rusty the Boy Robot. Though they should be at odds, the two must work together to save the city of certain destruction.\n\nThis work may take the longest of any Miller story to read, because you could spend a half hour ogling the details Darrow's placed on every page. Did we mention it's kid friendly?\n\nAlso Worth Reading:\n\nHard Boiled (also with Geof Darrow)\n\nThe Comics Journal: Frank Miller\n\nThis oversized coffer-table collection features numerous interviews with Frank Miller through every stage of his career. It's amazing to see the differences and a few of the similarities between a young Miller getting his big break working on Daredevil and the wise veteran with his creator-owned projects such as Sin City. Miller discusses not only his own work, but the craft of creating comic books. Included are numerous pieces of art from Miller and a cover gallery of some of his best books.\n\nAlso Worth Reading:\n\nFrank Miller: A Work in Progress\n\nDaredevil Visionaries: Frank Miller Vol. 1\n\nWhile Miller did wonders for Batman, he actually did far more for Daredevil. A Second-tier character, Daredevil once drew the kind of giggles people now give to promos for CBS' Blind Justice. No longer thanks to Miller's well-crafted work. There are two different sets of trades collecting Miller's DD work, but the Visionaries series is a good starting point for new readers. Miller starts out merely as the artist, but he slowly begins to take over the book until it truly becomes his to run with.\n\nDaredevil is, in all honesty, somewhat of a hokey character. Miller makes him respectable and adds layers to a once two-dimensional character. Once you reach the second volume and are introduced to Elektra, there's just no way you'll be able to put this series down.\n\nAlso Worth Reading:\n\nDaredevil Visionaries: Frank Miller Vol. 2\n\nDaredevil Visionaries: Frank Miller Vol. 3\n\nDaredevil: Born Again\n\nDaredevil: The Man Without Fear\n\nElektra Lives Again\n\nMartha Washington: Give Me Liberty\n\nMiller's funniest book is a satire of pop-culture set in the future. Fast food chains and amusement parks have grown so large they have their own armies. The gap between rich and poor has grown so large, there's no hope for repair. America is in the crapper. Enter Martha Washington, a young girl from the projects looking to make something of her life. She joins PAX, the citizen's army, and in turn gets a first-hand view of America the ugly.\n\nWhat's unique about the Martha Washington series, is that it's easy to forget it's written by Frank Miller. That is, this is one of the few books Miller has done that seems independent of his own success. There are numerous surprises and one hell of an Evil Surgeon general in this first trade. Is this where America is really headed? Probably.\n\nAlso Worth Reading:\n\nMartha Washington Goes to War\n\nHappy Birthday Martha Washington\n\nMartha Washington Stranded in Space\n\nMartha Washington Saves the World\n\nRonin\n\nMiller's first stab at a futuristic story was this samurai tale set in 21st century New York. A ronin, or masterless samurai, finds himself reborn from the 13th century and brought into modern times. His one quest remains to restore his honor by defeating the ancient demon Agat. But not everything is as it seems as you'll discover in this strange, sometimes clumsy tale or honor and redemption.\n\nNot at all Miller's best or strongest work, Ronin remains a worthwhile read. It's very ambitious, especially for an unproven author. This is Miller in his creative infancy and the groundwork for the future is clearly on display.\n\nAlso Worth Reading:\n\nBad Boy with Simon Bisley\n\nSin Ciy Vol. 1: The Hard Goodbye\n\nThe first Sin City book isn't the best, but it's darn close. Starring Marv, the most lovable ugly loser to ever grace a comic book, The Hard Goodbye takes the concepts of noir introduced by Raymond Chandler and Dashell Hammet, grabs it by the balls and twists. Over the top with incredible black and white artwork from Miller, Sin City is unlike any comic ever created. It's tough, ballsy, funny, sweet, sexy and brutally violent.\n\nThe Hard Goodbye is one of stories used in the upcoming Sin City movie. While you can read the books of Sin in any order, it's always nice to start at the beginning. Sex, betrayal, greed and murder are all on gleeful display. It's not for kids, but then, we all know comics aren't for kids, right?\n\nAlso Worth Reading:\n\nSin City: A Dame to Kill For\n\nSin City: The Big Fat Kill\n\nSin City: That Yellow Bastard\n\nSin City: Family Values\n\nSin City: Booze, Broads and Bullets\n\nSin City: Hell and Back\n\nFrank Miller: The Art of Sin City\n\nWolverine\n\nChris Claremont is the one true defining force behind Wolverine, but Frank Miller sure gave a helping hand in this classic miniseries. Though Claremont gets credit for the script, the concept of re-vitalizing Wolverine began on a trip back from the San Diego Comic-Con. Claremont and Miller gave Wolverine a proper origin (minus the whole not remember his past thing), set him up as a Ronin, and added new dimensions to an otherwise annoying little runt with claws. The Wolverine you love now is the Wolverine defined in this series.\n\nThe story is fantastic, one of Claremont's best outside of his long run on X-Men and Miller's artwork is his best during his run at Marvel. There's a reason why people love Wolverine and the genesis for that devotion is found in this book.\n\nWhat's your favorite Miller book? and let us know!"
