        "text": "Love him or hate him, Frank Miller has accomplished a lot in his 40+ year career. From his iconic run on Daredevil, to delivering superhero fare to a mature audience with The Dark Knight Returns, and escaping into the noir world of Sin City, Miller has made an indelible impact on comic book history.\n\nBut who is Frank Miller? What is his life like? While Miller has done a few interviews, he remains mostly a private person. In the absence of an official Frank Miller biography, it takes some digging to compile a useful, interesting list of Frank Miller trivia. Here it is for you, in all its glory.\n\nHe Is a Self-Taught Artist\n\nYep, that's right. The highly touted artist had no formal training whatsoever in drawing, inking, or any other visual art. Just a lot of practice and advice from his mentor, Neal Adams.\n\nHe Is Pro-Hillary Clinton\n\nWhile he identifies himself as a Libertarian, Miller has openly stated that he has voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton and \"will again, when she gets the nomination next time.\"\n\nHis Most Prized Possession Is a Personal Drawing by Will Eisner\n\nMiller was fond of fellow artist and author Will Eisner as a fan and, eventually, a peer. As per a Reddit AMA Miller participated in 2014, Miller's most prized possession is a personal drawing Eisner did for him. Miller kept mum about what the actual drawing was, and keeps it safe and protected at his home.\n\nHe Inspired the Creation of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\n\nFrom the late '70s through the early '80s, Miller did some his best work on Daredevil, which included introducing ninja elements to the character's mythos.\n\nIndependent comic artists Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird created a satire partially inspired by Miller's work. That satire eventually became Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, a massive franchise still popular three decades after its inception.\n\nSavvy comic fans believe it was a young Matt Murdock (that's Daredevil, for the uninitiated) who bumped into the glass bowl containing four baby turtles, knocking them into a sewer, where they mutated into TMNT. Another theory holds that Murdock was blinded by the same canister of toxic waste that mutated the turtles.\n\nEver wonder why the turtles' mentor was named Splinter? Because Daredevil's mentor during Miller's run was named Stick.\n\nHe Owns Over 200 Die-Cast Metal Cars\n\nMiller said in his 2014 Reddit AMA and other interviews that he collects toys. His collection includes more than 200 die-cast metal cars. He likes to use them as references when drawing vehicles in his stories.\n\nEmmylou Harris Makes Him Cry\n\nMiller enjoys the music of Emmylou Harris so much he chose her cover of Neil Young's \"Wrecking Ball\" to use for a pivotal scene in the Sin City film. He loved the combination of the song and scene so much it made him weep. He also enjoys her collaborations with Bob Dylan."
