        "text": "Frank Miller was born in Olney, Maryland. He would soon move to Montpelier, Vermont where he would grow up becoming a comic fan and eventually became an artist. Miller received his first gig as an artist in 1978, drawing “The Twilight Zone” for Gold Key Comics. This opened more doors of opportunity for Miller as he would soon be offered various jobs from DC Comics and Marvel Comics. Eventually Miller would stay with Marvel Comics and became a regular fill-in and cover artist. One day, Miller filled in for “Spectacular Spider-Man” #27 and #28. Daredevil was a supporting character in these two issues and currently had a poor selling title. Miller would ask Marvel Editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter for the opportunity to work on “Daredevil,” Shooter agreed and became the penciller for “Daredevil.”\n\nHe started his career drawing with Marvel's “Daredevil” title in the 1980's. He worked alongside writer Roger McKenzie and would insert his style of art into “Daredevil.” This proved successful as Miller soon became one of Marvel’s brightest rising stars. He made “Daredevil” so successful that it was upgraded to a monthly comic, whereas it used to be bi-monthly. Miller took over full duty as both writer and penciller in issue 168, this was the first appearance of Elektra. Perhaps his most well-known and influential work to date was his next foray into writing/penciling; the seminal miniseries “The Dark Knight Returns,” where Miller told the story of an older and darker Batman coming out of retirement to save Gotham City yet again. “The Dark Knight Returns” would become one of the biggest selling trade paperbacks and would remain on store shelves for over 20 years after its original publishing date. This miniseries had one of the biggest impacts in not only Batman titles, but the entire comic industry. However it changed Batman comics forever, as it made him become a darker character and also removed the 60’s television Batman from the image of Batman overall. It also revived Batman’s best friend relationship with Superman.\n\nMiller went on to write scripts for “RoboCop 2” and “RoboCop 3” and was also turned into a comic book series. During the 1990's Miller started up one of his most-read titles, \"Sin City,\" published by Dark Horse Comics, which was turned into a film co-directed by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller.\n\n“Sin City” is a moody, violent crime drama set in a fictional version of Las Vegas where corruption and greed have a strangle-hold on local authorities and an unlikely cast of anti-heroes must take care of themselves...and each other.\n\nIn 1998 Miller released the five issue miniseries “300,” based on the ancient Greek telling of the Battle of Thermopylae with the main protagonist being the Spartan King Leonidas. This book was made into a major motion picture that was released in the summer of 2007.\n\nFollowing up on the success of “Sin City” and “300” both titles received sequels. “300: Rise of an Empire” and “Sin City: A Dame to Kill For” starring Jessica Alba, Bruce Willis, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and others."
