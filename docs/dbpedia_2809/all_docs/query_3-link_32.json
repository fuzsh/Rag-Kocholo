        "text": "Lives and works in New York.\n\nAuthor - draftsman and screenwriter - of comic strips, screenwriter and film director.\n\nHe began his career in 1978, working at Gold Key then DC Comics before returning to Marvel Comics. He was quickly appointed draftsman, then also screenwriter for the Daredevil series for which he produced 42 episodes, creating the character of Elektra along the way. It radically redefines the contours of the series and profoundly upsets the traditional production codes of 80s comics. The pinnacle is reached with the \"rebirth\" cycle (Born Again) written by Frank Miller and drawn by David Mazzucchelli.\n\nIn 1986, Frank Miller scripted and drew Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, giving the series a dark, cynical, violent, oppressive and political side and the character a violent, psychopathic and extremist side that he would keep even in Christopher's films. Nolan. Two sequels will see the light of day, Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again then Dark Knight III. In 1987, he wrote Batman: Year One, illustrated by David Mazzucchelli.\n\nFrank Miller also created his own series, Ronin, Martha Wasdhington with Dave Gibbons drawing, Big Guy and Rusty the Boy Robot and Hard Boiled with Geof Darrow drawing as well as the Sin City series or the historical 300 series.\n\nFrank Miller writes scenarios for the cinema, in particular those of Robocop 2 and Robocop 3. He co-directed with Robert Rodriguez the adaptation of Sin City for the big screen in 2005, as well as its sequel Sin City: I Killed for She\" in 2014.\n\nIn 2005, he released the All-Star series Batman and Robin The Boy Wonder, drawn by Jim Lee, under DC's new All-Star label.\n\nIn 2007, he embarked on the adaptation of the comic strip Le Spirit by Will Eisner for the cinema. The film will be released in 2008.\n\nIn 2022, Frank Miller created the publishing house Frank Miller Presents in which he will notably publish the sequel to Ronin and Sin City 1858, Ancient Enemies.\n\nFrank Miller has profoundly renewed the codes of comics, both from a narrative and graphic point of view. The framing, cutting and staging of the bodies are profoundly innovative, drawing inspiration from the codes of American film noir, expressionism and the codes of manga from the 1970s with the icons of cartoonists Goseki Kojima (Lone Wolf and Cub ) and Hiroshi Hirata. The Sin City series is of extraordinary formal ambition, pushing the medium to its limits, through the use of black and white, the game between positive and negative never seen before, earning it 4 Will Eisner Awards including best draftsman / inker and Best Writer/Draughtsman."
