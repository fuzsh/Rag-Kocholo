        "text": "Tag: Frank Miller\n\nGH: DAREDEVIL #193\n\nFor the past couple of years, DAREDEVIL had been one of the best and strongest titles in the industry, mainly under the guiding hand of writer/penciler Frank Miller. Miller completely shifted the emphasis and the tone of the series, making it into much more a crime noir book, and being inventive with his storytelling and … Continue reading GH: DAREDEVIL #193 →\n\nBHOC: PETER PARKER, THE SPECTACULAR SPIDER-MAN #28\n\nThis was the second of two issues of PETER PARKER, THE SPECTACULAR SPIDER-MAN that were illustrated by a young Frank Miller, before that name really meant anything. Even more meaningfully, Daredevil, the character he would go on to reinvent, was a guest star in these two issues as well. It almost feels like fate. At … Continue reading BHOC: PETER PARKER, THE SPECTACULAR SPIDER-MAN #28 →\n\nBHOC: DAREDEVIL #157\n\nIn 1979, DAREDVIL was a series that had been limping along for years. Perhaps its only saving grace, the thing that kept it from being cancelled, was the fact that it was one of the original Marvel titles that had been launched at the start of the 1960s at the dawn of the Marvel Age. … Continue reading BHOC: DAREDEVIL #157 →\n\nBHOC: PETER PARKER, THE SPECTACULAR SPIDER-MAN #27\n\nThis issue of PETER PARKER, THE SPECTACULAR SPIDER-MAN is probably the most noteworthy and sought-after one in the whole of the run, for reasons that were not apparent to me when I first read it. And that's because it represents the first time that artist Frank Miller works on the character of Daredevil--a series that … Continue reading BHOC: PETER PARKER, THE SPECTACULAR SPIDER-MAN #27 →\n\nBHOC: DAREDEVIL #156\n\nThis next issue of DAREDEVIL featured the return of a hallmark of the series. Not DD's original yellow costume--something that I was excited to see, having read the first DAREDEVIL issue in SON OF ORIGINS OF MARVEL COMICS--but rather artist Gene Colan returning to the book that he'd labored on for many years throughout the … Continue reading BHOC: DAREDEVIL #156 →\n\nBHOC: DAREDEVIL #144\n\nThis is another unfamiliar cover for me. Unfamiliar because the copy of this book that I got had been stripped of its cover, which was sent back to the distributor for credit. However, rather than destroying the remainder of the book as he was required to do, the wholesaler instead sold it and a mountain … Continue reading BHOC: DAREDEVIL #144 →\n\nPerfect Game – BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, Book One\n\nThis is, I think, one of the most discussed comic book stories of all time, so I don't know that I'm going to have a whole lot that's new to add to the conversation. What I can bring to the table is some personal perspective. I would have been 19 years old in 1986 when … Continue reading Perfect Game – BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, Book One →\n\nComics Creators in the Wild 8\n\nMore photographs from years and decades past showcasing the writers, artists and editors of our favorite comic books. Mark Gruenwald in M.C. Hammer costume for Halloween, early 1990s John and Virginia Romita at a convention, circa 1986 Stan Lee plays the Atari Spider-Man video game, circa 1981 Steve Ditko, 1960s Stan Lee and costumed fans, … Continue reading Comics Creators in the Wild 8 →\n\nBHOC: DAREDEVIL #146\n\nThis is another comic book whose cover is a bit unfamiliar to me. And the reason for that is that this is another book that I got in one of those plastic-wrapped bundles of coverless recent comics from my local Drug Store chain. I think that to this day, I don't possess a copy of … Continue reading BHOC: DAREDEVIL #146 →\n\nThe Sales Figures of Marvel’s Jim Shooter\n\nWell, not really Jim Shooter's directly, not in the same was as the Irwin Donenfeld sales charts we looked at last week. But I'm reasonably certain that I cribbed these newsstand tracking sheets from Jim Shooter's old web page a decade or so back, and he would have been there when they came in--so we'll … Continue reading The Sales Figures of Marvel’s Jim Shooter →"
