        "text": "Miller, Frank\n\nEntry updated 23 December 2023. Tagged: Artist, Author, Comics.\n\n(1957- ) US Comic-book writer and artist, with a distinctive fragmented narrative technique; also film scriptwriter and director. During 1979-1985 Miller worked on Marvel Comics's Daredevil, producing work that was later re-released in three collections: Child's Play (graph coll 1988), Marked for Death (graph coll 1990) and Gang War (graph coll 1992). He then produced two apocalyptic dramas for DC Comics: Ronin (1983-1984; graph 1987) and Batman: The Dark Knight Returns (books #1-#4 1986; graph 1986) (see Batman; Batman: The Dark Knight Returns; Nuclear Winter). All of this work brought a new integrity to the gritty, toughly narrated drama in comics, and paved the way among prospective publishers for other hopeful writer/artists. Further work from this period included Elektra Saga (1984; graph coll 1989) and, written by Chris Claremont, Wolverine (1982; graph coll 1987).\n\nFollowing the phenomenal success of The Dark Knight Returns – nominated for a 1987 Hugo in, absurdly, the Best Nonfiction Book category, coming second – Miller has collaborated with other comics artists including: David Mazzuchelli on Daredevil: Born Again (1985; graph coll 1987) and Batman: Year One (1987; graph 1988); Bill Sienkiewicz on Elektra: Assassin (1986-1987; graph coll 1987) and Daredevil: Love and War (graph 1986); Dave Gibbons on Give Me Liberty (1990-1991; graph 1991; exp vt The Life and Times of Martha Washington in the 21st Century graph coll 2010); and Geoff Darrow on Hard Boiled (1990-1992; graph 1993) and Big Guy and Rusty the Boy Robot (1995).\n\nMiller's other work during this period includes Elektra Lives Again (graph 1990) and the gritty crime drama, Sin City (1991-2000), first serialized in Dark Horse Presents, then released as a mini-series and original graphic novels. Miller also collaborated with Walter Simonson on a series tied to the RoboCop and Terminator films (see The Terminator; Terminator 2: Judgment Day). Miller has also collaborated on the screenplays for RoboCop 2 (1990) and RoboCop 3 (1993), the former being based on his original story.\n\nHe returned to Batman in 2001 with Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again (2001-2002; graph 2002) and All-Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder, an irregularly published ongoing series begun in 2005 and currently continuing.\n\nSin City was adapted to film in 2005 in collaboration with Robert Rodriguez; Miller co-scripted and co-directed. In 2008, he wrote and directed an unwatchable film adaptation of Will Eisner's The Spirit.
