        "text": "By Charlie Phillips | July 9, 2017\n\nI’m going to start things off with a statement that sounds stupid on its face. Superhero comic books reflect reality. Not totally and not with any sort of realism, but in the ways that count cape & cowl books—from DC, Marvel, Valiant, IDW or any number of publishers—take place in worlds that mirror our own. Spider-Man swings down the streets of a recognizable Manhattan, while Judge Dredd defends a city that embodies all of our excesses to the nth degree. Look past the colorful costumes and the crash bang zoom of the battles and you’ll see humanity staring back at you.\n\nAll in all this is a good thing. It anchors the reader to the story and a personal perspective makes you care more about what is happening than if it were just a bunch of hugely powerful abstract beings fighting over mind-bending abstract stakes, a problem that can sometimes crop up in more “cosmic” superhero storytelling. But to the extent that superhero stories reflect reality, they also sow the seeds for disagreement and even hostility. Because when you deal with reality, you’ll inevitably run up against people’s moral and political values. And woe betide any writer who goes up against those. One such besieged creator is the legendary Frank Miller.\n\nIn most comic book circles Frank Miller is held as a visionary creator who’s writing and art are celebrated as paragons of a gritty and punchy noir style. But he has also come under fire for his newer works allegedly promoting bigoted views through his work and for the deterioration of his artistic ability. This criticism has become frequent enough that some people question if he was ever great, could the esteemed Frank Miller be overrated?\n\nNot a chance. Frank Miller’s body of work both in terms of art and writing should be the envy of any comics creator. He produced some gorgeous artwork as the artist for Chris Claremont’s run on Wolverine and his stint as both writer and artist on Daredevil is quite possibly the definitive take on the character. And, of course, no list of Frank Miller’s greatest works would be complete without mentioning The Dark Knight Returns. Criticism of Frank Miller’s other work may be warranted (I haven’t read all of it by any means) but The Dark Knight Returns is more than just influential, it’s downright amazing. Its importance isn’t just due to how it has influenced other stories, but primarily boils down to how it’s a bona fide classic and easily a candidate for one of the best graphic novels of all time.\n\nNow to the extent that Miller’s most lauded work is criticized it’s usually because it is perceived as being too dark, and responsible for ushering in an era of joyless storytelling. I’d encourage those who hold this view to give the work another glance. Far from being depressing The Dark Knight Returns is exciting, invigorating, and really really funny.\n\nI’d wager that, besides the portion of the book when he’s in retirement, Miller’s Bruce Wayne is one of the least broody since the halcyon days of the Silver Age, look at that smile! And the Joker’s appearance on a talk show is a hilarious commentary on our status-obsessed voyeuristic society.\n\nThe Dark Knight Returns isn’t about a depressed Batman nihilistically brutalizing people to heal the hole in his heart; it’s about a Batman who fulfills his calling to save the common man while inspiring them to make a stand against the forces of crime and social impotence. After all, “The world only makes sense when you force it.”\n\nSome have misinterpreted Batman’s zeal and his brushes with the law as being evidence of a dangerous authoritarian bent to Miller’s work. The book shows us a gang called “The Sons of Batman” who emulate the Caped Crusader but with a dash of vigilante killing thrown in. Perhaps Miller’s critics fear that readers of his will follow suit. Well, these worriers can sleep tight because the comic itself doesn’t support this idea. “The Sons of Batman” only become good narratively speaking when Batman rides in and converts them to his non-lethal crime fighting methods.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that Batman only declares himself to be the ultimate authority in Gotham when the fair city has been sent into anarchy by an electromagnetic pulse. And it was only on a temporary basis, he didn’t overthrow the government and erect Bat-Schools while collecting Bat-Taxes.\n\nRather than teaching us to acquiesce to any authority that wears a cape & cowl, The Dark Knight Returns asks that we question authority, and not in a limp-wristed way. To look at your government, from the president to the police precinct, are they doing everything they can to keep you and your neighbors safe and secure? Are they protecting your freedom, or just pocketing your vote? To look at the media and academia, are they upholding universal principles? Or are they engaging in brain numbing schlock, intellectual masturbation, and outright malfeasance?\n\nDemand better from society. But also demand better from yourself. If things are going wrong, don’t bury your head in the sand and expect things to get better. Find the people who are helping and do some helping yourself. I admit that this is a tall order, but most aspirations are."
