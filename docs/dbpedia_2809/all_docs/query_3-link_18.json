        "text": "2.3K\n\nIf you are a Batman fan, then the name Frank Miller means something to you. While it has been a while since his name was synonymous with greatness in the Batman world, Miller is responsible for two of the Caped Crusader’s most iconic stories in his 77-year history with Batman: Year One and The Dark Knight Returns.\n\nOne of Miller’s strengths as both a writer and artist is that he treats the city and environment in his stories as its own character. Gotham City feels like a real, breathing, corrupt place that Batman needs to save. The same can also be said in his Daredevil and Sin City runs.\n\nMiller, who lives in New York City, uses his urban home as inspiration for the visuals in his stories. “They’re a perfect vehicle for a radical use of perspective. Also, they’re packed with people. There is a story behind every window.” More specifically, he goes on to say that the rooftops of New York are where he feels the most inspired. Speaking about the showdown between Batman and Harvey Two-Face in The Dark Knight Returns, Miller says “the climax takes place at a stylized version of the Chrysler Building, complete with art deco eagle ornaments.”\n\nCurrently, Frank Miller is working on The Dark Knight III: The Master Race, the sequel to his previous work The Dark Knight Returns and The Dark Knight Strikes Again. Already 5 issues in, it was announced late last month that a ninth issue will be added in the spring to conclude the story."
