        "text": "He claimed in the introduction to \"The Dark Knight Returns\" that he got the idea of writing of a Batman in his mid 60s from a age crisis he had. He \"could stand that his little brother was older than Spider-Man, but that he himself getting older than Batman, was something that had to be stopped.\" He was 29 years old, closing up on 30, writing \"The Dark Knight Returns.\"\n\nMoved to New York in 1976, when he was 19. Within a week of his arrival he had found work as a comic book artist.\n\nHas told in several interviews that he got the inspiration for the \"noir and gritty experience\" of all his comics (especially Sin City) from noir writers Mickey Spillane, Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett. The pacing was very influenced by the Lone Wolf & Cub manga by Goseki Kojima & Kazuo Koike.\n\nHas said that \"The Romantic Manifesto\" by Ayn Rand, a book of collective essays about art and romanticism, helped him to determine how he'd go about creating his heroics.\n\nHis comic book \"RoboCop Versus The Terminator\" was originally envisaged to be made into movie but the rights to make it come true weren't that easy to obtain since Terminator (1984) director James Cameron wouldn't allow it.\n\nWriting and illustrating \"Sin City\", a comic series, for Dark Horse; co-writing the script for _Batman: Year One (2011)_, a feature film adaptation of his comic series for Warner Brothers; writing and illustrating \"The Dark Knight Strikes Again\" for DC, a sequel to \"The Dark Knight Returns\"; outlining \"Jesus!\", a comic-book version of the life of Christ for Dark Horse Maverick. (2001)\n\nHe originally envisioned The Dark Knight Returns as a short story, but as he worked on it, he realized it needed to be something bigger.\n\nHis first DC comic Ronin, was originally going published under Marvel's Marvel Graphic Novel series, but when the then publisher of DC comics Jenette Khan promised him complete creative freedom , he agreed to make it at DC.\n\nHe was initially reluctant to draw the Wolverine miniseries, as he saw Wolverine as nothing more than a one dimensional berserker, but was won over by Chris Claremont's pitch of Wolverine as a failed samurai."
