        "text": "The sequel to 300 is finally hitting theaters this week. And while 300: Rise of an Empire isn't directly based on a Frank Miller comic like the original, it still has us reflecting back on Miller's long, impressive career in the comics industry. Miller is a versatile creator who distinguished himself as a writer and an artist, and often both at once. He was instrumental in the evolution of characters like Daredevil and Batman in the 1980's. His creator-owned projects like Sin City and 300 have proven to be very successful, hence the movie deals. We've selected what we consider to be the ten best and most enduring stories Miller has worked on over the years. Let us know what your favorites are in the comments section below!\n\n10 . Big Guy & Rusty the Boy Robot\n\nBig Guy and Rusty the Boy Robot TPBMuch of Miller's work is steeped in Japanese elements like wandering samurai and ninja crime cartels. But Big Guy and Rusty the Boy Robot explored a different branch of Japanese pop culture - giant robots and kaiju. Miller offered a coming-of-age tale where the hulking robo-warrior Rusty and his Astroboy-esque replacement, Rusty, must band together to save their city from rampaging monsters.\n\nThis series reunited Miller with artist Geof Darrow after their previous collaboration on Hard Boiled. Darrow's intricate, energetic work was a perfect fit for the story, which might not have worked as well as it did had Miller illustrated it himself. Big Guy and Rusty the Boy Robot also deserves credit for (despite some violence) being more family-friendly than most of Miller's work. It seems even Miller has a soft side.\n\n9 . 300\n\nIn what is probably the last of his great works, Miller turned his attention to historical Greece (a heavily fictionalized version of it, at least) for 300. Miller offered his own take on the Battle of Thermopylae, the famous clash between King Leonidas and his uber-elite Spartan warriors against a massive Persian invading force. As much as the series simplified the real events of Thermopylae as recorded by Herodotus, 300 proved to be a rousing tale of a courageous few defending their home against a seemingly insurmountable enemy.\n\nIt was also a terrifically violent and stylish look at Spartan warfare. Would you expect anything less of Miller? It helped that 300 adopted a novel widescreen format. Each issue consisted of a series of double-page spreads, which really paid off when the book was collected in hardcover format. The already cinematic comic was faithfully and lavishly adapted by Zack Snyder for the 2006 film, which relished in every display of Spartan machismo and gushing torrent of blood.\n\nSeveral years ago, Dark Horse announced a follow-up to 300 called Xerxes, which will explore the origins of the self-proclaimed \"god-king\" and the events of the Battle of Marathon. Xerxes was supposed to have been released in time for the theatrical debut of 300: Rise of an Empire, but seems to have dropped off the radar for now. It should be interesting to see how this prequel pr\n\n8 . Ronin\n\nAfter immersing himself in the world of samurai, ninja, and martial arts for his Wolverine and Daredevil work, it seemed Miller had samurai on the brain. And that informed his first major project for DC, which explored a very different sort of wandering samurai hero. In this case, a ronin kills himself and his nemesis, the demonic Agat, in feudal Japan, only for both to be reborn in a dystopian, 21st Century New York City.\n\nRonin is perhaps a bit rougher around the edges than much of Miller's later creator-owned work. But it's a bold, imaginative story nonetheless. Miller's art shows a clear influence from Lone Wolf & Cub, with its bold figures and woodcut-esque texture. The series also marked the first collaboration between Miller and colorist (and future wife) Lynn Varley.\n\nRonin's influence is clear, not just on his future work, but other creators as well. Nowhere is that influence more apparent than Genndy Tartakovsky's surreal animated series Samurai Jack. And alongside Brian Bolland's Camelot 3000 and Alan Moore's Saga of the Swamp Thing, Ronin paved the way for more intellectual, adult-oriented stories at DC and the creation of the Vertigo imprint.\n\n7 . Sin City: The Hard Goodbye\n\nHaving spent much of the '80s churning out character-defining runs for Daredevil, Batman, and Wolverine, Miller began focusing more on creator-owned projects as the '90s dawned. One of his most popular and influential, Sin City, made its humble debut in the pages of Dark Horse Presents.\n\nThe first Sin City saga is still the best, though The Big Fat Kill and That Yellow Bastard certainly make strong cases as well. The Hard Goodbye first introduced readers to Basin City, a dank, shadowy cesspool of crime and corruption. Their guide was Marv, a hulking brute driven to avenge the murder of Goldie, a prostitute whose only crime was showing him a but of tenderness and humanity. Marv's ensuing path of destruction was as tragic as it was violent.\n\nSin City has always been one of the strongest showcases for Miller's distinctive art style. Color is used sparingly, with the art instead focused on the interplay between light and shadow and delivering a stark, noir atmosphere. As with any Sin City comic, there's never any question of who illustrated The Hard Goodbye.\n\n6 . Martha Washington: Give Me Liberty\n\nHumor is not an element common to much of Miller's work prior to the days of The Dark Knight Strikes Again and All-Star Batman & Robin. And that's something that set Give Me Liberty apart from the rest of Miller's resume when it debuted in 1990. Miller was certainly no stranger to dystopian futures by that point, but Give Me Liberty featured a heavy satirical element. It also boasted one of his more complex and memorable characters in the form of the 21st Century freedom fighter named after a certain First Lady. And Dave Gibbons' art certainly didn't hurt either.\n\nUnfortunately, the Martha Washington saga peaked early with Give Me Liberty, and Miller and Gibbons never quite recaptured the magic in subsequent stories. But it's hard to complain too much when the entire saga is now collected in one $30 trade. Miller fans can follow the entire life's journey and struggle of Martha Washington as she struggles in the Chicago slums, becomes a military hero, and eventually defender of the globe.\n\n5 . Daredevil by Miller & Janson Vol. 2\n\nWhen Miller first came on board Marvel's ailing Daredevil series, his role was largely visual. But seeing how well fans were responding to Miller's darker style, he eventually took full control of the series. And that's where the magic truly began. The most beloved portion of his Daredevil saga came when Miller introduced the deadly assassin Elektra, the underground cartel of ninja known as the Hand, and the homicidal maniac Bullseye. Along the way, Daredevil embarked on a haunting romance with Elektra, supplanted Spider-Man as the #1 nemesis of the Kingpin, and gained a new aura of respectability.\n\nThe final showdown between Elektra and Bullseye that punctuated this storyline remains one of the most iconic moments in comics. Once a series that seemed to perpetually flirt with cancellation, Daredevil became one of Marvel's most popular titles, and a real showcase for the up-and-coming Frank Miller.\n\n4 . Batman: Year One\n\nFollowing Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC began streamlining and modernizing many of its iconic heroes, stripping away some of the sillier Silver Age elements. Batman wasn't overhauled as heavily as characters like Superman and Wonder Woman, but DC did see fit to give the Caped Crusader a new, more in-depth origin story. And naturally, they turned to the creator who had so recently shaken up Batman's world with The Dark Knight Returns.\n\nMiller only wrote Batman: Year One, while David Mazzucchelli handled the art. It proved to be quite a match, as Mazzucchelli captured the gritty, harsh nature of Miller's storytelling but with a more subdued, classical approach befitting a Batman just embarking on his war on crime. The creators presented a serious, dramatic take on Batman's first year, exploring a Bruce Wayne who had the will to save Gotham but was only just discovering the way. Part of Year One's genius was in how it focused just as much attention on Lt. James Gordon, who simultaneously experienced his first troubled year in Gotham.\n\nYear One solidified DC's darker, more grounded take on Batman, and continues to serve as a model when it comes time to update and modernize a character's origin. How many other books have featured the \"Year One\" subtitle since?\n\n3 . Wolverine by Claremont & Miller\n\nWolverine's popularity as a character has a lot to do his his bad-ass loner mystique. In the early years of Chris Claremont's Uncanny X-Men run, that's pretty much all there was to Logan. It wasn't until this collaboration between Claremont and Miller that Wolverine became the tragic, complex hero we know him as today.\n\nWolverine's first solo book took him to Japan, where he encountered the fair Lady Mariko, her ruthless, domineering father, Shingen, and the wily ninja, Yuriko. Wolverine's rivalry with Shingen, his fall from grace and subsequent rise, firmly established him as a failed samurai. Suddenly, he had depth and suffering to go along with the sharp claws and fierce attitude. And Miller's art has rarely been so dynamic and bold. This is a story that can only be truly appreciated in oversized format.\n\nSome aspects of this mini-series may seem overly familiar to readers only experienced with contemporary X-books. But that's only because this story had and continues to have a profound influence on so many Wolverine comics that followed. Without it, Wolverine wouldn't be the best there is at what he does.\n\n2 . The Dark Knight Returns\n\nDespite the best efforts of creators like Neal Adams and Denny O'Neil, by the 1980's Batman was still closely associated with the camp and silliness of the Silver Age and the 1960's TV series. Leave it to Miller to remind Bat-fans how dark and brooding the Caped Crusader can be.\n\nThe Dark Knight Returns was born out of Miller's realization that he was now older than the superhero he idolized as a boy. He presented Bruce Wayne as an aging recluse in a world where most heroes had given up or gone to ground, only for him to be spurred back into action by the spiraling state of Gotham and the yearning in his heart. Together with a new, female Robin, this hulking, grizzled Batman set about striking fear into the hearts of criminals once more.\n\nLike much of Miller's work on this list, The Dark Knight Returns was hugely influential. It offered a bold new take on Batman and inspired a wave of \"grim and gritty\" imitators. ts influence can be seen on many other interpretations of Batman, including The Dark Knight Rises and the upcoming sequel to Man of Steel sequel.\n\n1 . Daredevil: Born Again\n\nGenerally, a creator who can both write and draw is going to deliver their best work when they handle both sides of the equation. But if there's one artist who seems to bring out the absolute best from Frank Miller, it's David Mazzucchelli.\n\nBorn Again saw Miller return to the Daredevil franchise several years after making his mark with Matt Murdock. Miller plunged the troubled hero into even greater darkness before. After a drug-addicted Karen Page sold Daredevil's identity, Kingpin set about systematically destroying every aspect of Murdock's personal and professional life. But as Kingpin soon discovered, \"A man without hope is a man without fear.\" Like so many of Miller's heroes, Daredevil rose from the gutter and conquered his enemy, proving more than ever why he's one of Marvel's greatest heroes.\n\nMaybe we sound like a broken record at this point, but Born Again has proven hugely influential throughout the industry. It serves as a model for creators who want to push their heroes to the limit and see them come back stronger. It set the stage for writers like Brian Michael Bendis and Ed Brubaker to continue tormenting Matt decades later.\n\nMiller framed Born Again as the final Daredevil story, allowing Matt and Karen to walk happily into the sunset together. And while Marvel certainly didn't stop publishing Daredevil comics, it would have been a worthy sendoff. Jesse is a mild-mannered writer for IGN.
