        "meta_description": "American, b. 1957 Frank Miller was born in Olney, Maryland in 1957. In Montpelier, Vermont, where he was raised with his 6 siblings, he grew up a comics fan. In 1979, 22-year-old Frank Miller began drawing for Marvel’s bi-monthly Daredevil comic book. Just over a year later Miller was given complete control over writing and drawing Daredevil, for which he created the character Elektra. In his comic art creations, Miller is noted for combining film noir and manga influences, which gave to his Daredevil art an authentic feel not commonly seen in superhero comics at the time. Miller made his feature film directorial debut in 2005 with Sin City, the adaptation of his graphic novel, which he co-directed with Robert Rodriguez. The critically acclaimed film was nominated for a Palme d'Or at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival, won the Austin Film Critics Award, and garnered a Czech Lion nomination. Miller has received every major comic book industry award, and in 2015 he was inducted into the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame. Beyond comics, Miller’s prowess encompasses authorship, cartooning, screenwriting, and directing. He is one of our generation's masters of the graphic novel and resonates as a 20th-century \"Ninth Art\" trailblazer, leaving an indelible imprint on the creative landscape.",
