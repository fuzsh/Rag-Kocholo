        "text": "May 31, 2021\n\n(ARC provided by Goodreads - thank you so much!)\n\n\"August doesn’t believe in most things, but it’s hard to argue that Jane wasn’t put on the Q to fuck up her whole life.\"\n\nRed, White & Royal Blue was one of my favorite books of 2019. I was able to get a very early ARC of it, and I fell so deeply in love with this alternate reality I so desperately wanted to live in as a queer biracial with a hopeless romantic heart. Casey’s prose, characters, romance, banter, and (obviously) themes were everything to me, and I knew that they would take the book world by storm with their expectation-shattering debut. But then when they announced their next book would be sapphic Kate & Leopold, with an Asian love interest? Be still, my entire heart and soul. So when I tell you that I ignored every single ARC I needed to read and review before this one for the next eight months, I say that with my whole chest because there was no way I could stop myself once it hit my kindle.\n\nOne Last Stop is a story about a twenty-three-year-old bi girl named August who has moved from university to university, state to state, looking for a place that will feel like a home she has never known. Her whole life, her mother has expected her to assist in solving a missing person case from the 70s, but August just wants to find herself, her own way, and wants to feel like she finally belongs somewhere. At the start of this story, she has made it to New York where is she going to finish her degree, and thanks to a questionably placed looking-for-roommates advertisement in a Popeyes she starts to feel like maybe she could eventually call this city and these roommates home.\n\nThe Roommates:\n\n➽ Niko – trans Latino psychic (good) bartender (not so good)\n\n➽ Myla – queer Black electrical engineer turned artist (has an adoptive Chinese mom, who really added to the story so beautifully to me, so I am mentioning it here too!)\n\n➽ Wes – queer Jewish tattoo artist\n\nOh, and I am fully in love with all three of them and the found family depicted in this book is so heartwarmingly perfect, I promise you! There are even more side characters who will easily steal your heart, too, and there is also a big emphasis on New York’s drag scene, and how queer people of color are still paving the way in 2020. This book has a very diverse cast, and we see so many different cultures, sexualities, genders, religions, and more. (There is for sure bigger body representation with August, but I’m not sure that I would say it is fat representation. I will edit this and quote an ownvoices reviewer mutual once they read and review! Also, it is brought up a couple times that August’s mom conceived her via in vitro fertilization, and I just feel like we don’t really get to see that a lot in books and I really loved that too!)\n\nBut on August’s very first day’s commute to school, where she takes the Q train subway line, she is having a bit of bad luck and an exceptionally large coffee stain. But all that luck seems to change right before her very eyes, when she meets a girl who gives August her red scarf without hesitation. She can’t stop thinking about the girl who saved her bad day, and the low chances of her being at that exact spot when she needed someone in a city that is so busy second meetings never happen, especially on the subway. That is, until she sees the girl again, and again, and starts to realize that she not only is on the Q every time August is on it, but in the exact same train car.\n\nOh Jane, where do I even begin? Jane is a Chinese lesbian who is displaced from the 70s in some kind of magical timeslip, where she can’t remember much of anything about her past, only what she carries in her bookbag. That is, until Jane seems to be the only person who helps her remember, while also being the only person she can’t seem to forget. Oh, and come the Mid-Year Freak Out Tag? Every sapphic in the book community with have Jane Su as their fictional crush. On God and on everything else. When I tell you Casey McQuistion wrote most everyone’s sapphic dream, I say it honestly.\n\nBut basically, since August has been taught her whole life how to solve missing persons cases, and because she is very gay and can’t stop thinking about the incredibly swoon worthy girl on the train, she decides to do whatever it takes to help not only figure out Jane’s past, but to try to rescue her from the subway she is tethered to. Even if helping her means lots and lots of kissing, maybe especially so actually.\n\n\"It’s probably going to break my heart, and it’s still worth it.\"\n\nThe romance in this book? A tier above. I feel like One Last Stop gave a new definition to the word “yearning” if you want my very honest opinion. Truly, this is the type of book that will make even the most cynical of readers believe in love. The emotions (and tears) it was able to evoke from me was nothing short of astounding. And now I will be forever longing for someone to have a notebook filled with me. Like, this book is truly so goddamn romantic, and the one-liners left me utterly gasping and fully quaking.\n\n\"but none of those girls were you.\"\n\nOn top of the fact that the sex scenes were probably the best I’ve read in any f/f book in my entire life. The range of sexual acts, the different kinds of sex that queer people are extra blessed to have if they want to have sex, the learning of your partner’s wants and needs and body in general; it was all just so perfect, so sexy, and so realistic. And this book was so sex positive, especially when you are in your early twenties and learning what you want and like! Also, there was a very important (and seamlessly woven in) discussion on virginity and how the concept is truly something of dated myth, especially in queer communities.\n\n\"She read about San Francisco, about the movements happening there, about Asian lesbians riding on the backs of cable cars just to show the city they existed\"\n\nCasey McQuiston constantly pays homage to the lgbtqiap+ community (especially queer people of color) who came before us, who paved the way, and who are the reason that we in present day have so many more rights and freedoms. And they do not shy away from talking about the costs so many paid with heartbreaking loss.\n\nThe UpStairs Lounge fire happened in the 1973 and was the largest gay mass murder prior to the Pulse shooting in 2016. The Stonewall riots in 1969, where people refused to be silenced and erased by the police or anyone else, and in return gave us some many civil rights advances. To HIV and AIDS activists who had to live during the Carter and Reagan administrations who not only encouraged hate with racism and homophobia, but who heartlessly let so many die, while also eventually administrated drugs that would lead to toxic overdoses, simultaneously promising a vaccine that would never come. Victims had to wait until 2003 for baseline adequate help after so many had already been lost because of the virus.\n\nThere are so many challenges still with being unapologetically who you are in present day, but it is so important to honor and remember all of the lgbtqiap+ activists (again, especially the people of color) who came before us and made what we do have today possible. And Casey McQuiston truly keeps that at the forefront and makes it the heart of this story.\n\n\"two different generations of messy, loud, brave and scared and brave again people stomping their feet and waving hands with bitten nails, all the things they share and all the things they don’t. the things she has that people like Jane smashed windows and spat blood for.\"\n\nAnd surrounding yourself with people who see you, amplify you, support you, celebrate you, and love you unconditionally and unapologetically is so important, too. I think it’s always really important to mention that even though Casey honors the past, they filled me with so much hope for the future, and for future generations of marginalized voices who will more easily be amplified, more easily be heard, and so much more easily be seen.\n\nFriendly reminder, if you haven't found a place that feels like home yet, or the people who uncondiontally love and respect you, I promise you will and I promise are never alone in the meantime. Putting yourself and your safety first will always be the most important thing in all the different stages of life. And just know I see you, and I'm proud of you, and I'm cheering for you, always. But if you ever need extra help The Trevor Project and PFLAG can be wonderful recourses.\n\nOverall, this book just meant so much to me, and I know it is going to mean so much to so many. 2020 has been so hard, so fucking hard, on so many, and this book was the 2020 escapism that I want to fold myself into forever. I haven’t left my home’s property in eight months, but with One Last Stop I got to feel whole and happy and seen on a New York subway, while watching two girls fall in love and carve out the lives that they want, unapologetically. Truly, this book made me even more proud to be a queer Asian, I only wish I was half as cool as Jane Su.\n\n\"you’re the first thing I’ve believed in since—since I don’t even remember, okay, you’re—you’re movies and destiny and every stupid, impossible thing, and it’s not because of the fucking train, it’s because of you.\"\n\nOh, and this will probably be my favorite 2021 publication.

This is going to be a niche review for a niche audience: people who take the Q train, the real Q train, the actual physical space that barely gets a decent physical description once in this entire book but that supposedly was this big source of inspiration to Casey McQuiston. Also this review is for people who have actual emotions about Flatbush, a vibrant and complex community that similarly never really gets described properly, but that, like the Q train, just sort of gets pulled into this book to form a few scattered sentences of \"colorful\" backdrop for a twee white out-of-towner fantasy. I don't expect anyone who doesn't fit into these groups to care about the points raised in this review and if you don't want your vibe harshed because you think this book is sweet and harmless and delightful, go with god and know that I support your desire to check out -- we all need to check out sometimes. But this review is not for you. This review is for crotchety New Yorkers who can only tolerate a certain level of \"I just love the subways and I see the magic in them the way natives cannot\" nonsense.\n\nOK. Did you leave? Click away? I don't want to hear complaints. I'm giving you space to walk away before we get into the meat of what makes this book so bad for me. This is your last warning. Click the back-button, or forever hold your peace.\n\nA f/f time-travel mystery set in Flatbush, Brooklyn, with an Asian-American punk queer love interest, is a fantastic pitch. So I wanted this to be good. Instead it is unforgivably lazy.\n\nTo explain how, I have to start with the trains. So much of the way McQuiston pitched this book was about loving our local trains. Loving the Q line. Seeing romance and magic in the Q line where no one else (definitely not a jaded and unmagical local) can. Etc.\n\nHere's my question to McQuiston: if they love the Q train so much, why did they get so much about the Q train, and the train lines in general, wrong?\n\nTo be honest, many of the details McQuiston gives us about NYC are wrong. Like, factually wrong. Like, \"a simple google search would have cleared this up\" wrong. Like, \"oh my god, you didn't even do your readers the decency of checking wikipedia before you wrote this\" wrong. There are too many places where McQuiston cites a supposed NYC-specific thing that actually reveals McQuiston sees NYC as an empty canvas with no real human beings or history, so I won't cite them all. I'll just focus on the train stuff, since trains are a Big Deal in this book.\n\nI'll try to work my way from small complaint to big one.\n\nThe way McQuiston describes August's train station -- Parkside, a below-ground and yet outdoor station -- is factually wrong. McQuiston perplexingly insists it's an above-ground station. It's not and would not be referred to that way, because the Q from Parkside to Newkirk was specifically constructed to fall below the street level in order to conceal the sightline from the wealthy who once lived in Flatbush (much of the area by the Q line was originally developed for the rich, which makes the place where this book is set physically distinct from many other corners of NYC in ways McQuiston never so much alludes to or touches on. There's some extremely basic local history anyone from Flatbush could tell you. You're welcome).\n\nMcQuiston also describes August getting drenched with rain at the station. The station has an overhang and an upstairs lobby/stairwell space to wait out the rain. Was August hopping onto the tracks? How did she get so wet?\n\nThen there's the commute August supposedly takes to get to college: take the Q train to Avenue H and walk 2 blocks. This is also factually wrong. Congratulations, August! You're not in Brooklyn College. You're standing in the front yard of a random Victorian house in a wholly residential area, staring at the Brooklyn College athletic fields glistening in the far distance across Ocean Avenue. A family of Orthodox Jewish people is probably wondering if they can politely ask you to leave.\n\nNow -- August taking the Q to get to and from work. This is not strictly wrong. But she supposedly lives at Parkside and Flatbush and works at Church and Bedford. To take the Q train to get between these two locations would mean taking it from Parkside to just the very next station: Church Avenue. And that is baffling. I'm serious. It's the work of a deranged person who wants to give the New York City MTA a chunk of her waitressing tips for no reason. The Q line runs away from Bedford Avenue, so this commute takes August out of where she actually needs to go. But, more critically, the entrance to the Parkside station is no more than four or five blocks from the nearest entrance to the Church Avenue station. August could walk that in less than five minutes. She doesn't. At one point she takes the Q home from work (again, to get to the very next stop) and she has a full conversation on it with her love interest, Jane, and then gets off at Parkside, and I was like: what? How did you manage to talk for so long? There is no way you were on the train for more than a minute. You took the train to cross like four blocks.\n\nFinally, August insisting that she sees finance guys on her morning commute also makes no sense. If she lives at Parkside and heads to Avenue H every day, she's going deeper into Brooklyn. The NYC Financial District is in Manhattan, in a completely different direction, so even assuming the Brooklyn morning Q train is packed with finance guys, they would be taking a different Q train entirely, because they'd be going the opposite way.\n\nAnd, actually, August mostly takes the train deeper into Brooklyn in this book, barring a few places where she's heading to Chinatown to get dumplings for Jane or trying to have sex on the Manhattan Bridge for some reason, and yet August keeps referencing \"commuters,\" even though the only direction August would ever have to commute in, to get to work or school, would take her away from Manhattan. And if she's commuting home, well, then she's going towards Manhattan, but the City's commuters aren't. They're still on the opposite train, heading back into Brooklyn. Do you see what I'm saying? McQuiston constructed August's journeys so that August is like never going the way any of the commuters on the Q line would be going, and yet August somehow keeps encountering \"commuters.\" Are they all lost? Where are they going? Why doesn't August notify them that they're on the wrong train?\n\nAll of these details could have been fact-checked. A look at google maps or a subway map could have cleared up a few of these errors! Hell. A look at a subway map would have helped McQuiston see that \"MTA\" stands for Metropolitan Transportation Authority. McQuiston, bafflingly, tells us that it stands for Manhattan Transit Authority. It has, to my knowledge, never stood for that. No, not even in the 70s.\n\nThis kind of thing happens so often in this book that one fact becomes inescapable, if you know the area McQuiston is writing about: McQuiston decided that a place is the perfect backdrop for a romance, and then proceeded to learn absolutely nothing about that place. McQuiston decided they want a magical realism romance on the NYC train system, and then proceeded to learn nothing about that system. Not where the stations are or what they look like, not who actually takes the train and where they go, not even the name of the goddamn train system.\n\nBecause August meets Jane (we will get to Jane; I actually didn't mind Jane) on the Q train, over and over, the Q train is supposedly this all-important place. It's August's \"home,\" and we're supposed to feel, I don't know, magical and swoony inside when she declares the Q line is \"a time, a place, and a person.\"\n\nBut. Uh. Since August keeps getting very basic facts about the train line wrong, to anyone who regularly rides the Q train, this line comes across like Aubrey Plaza in Parks and Rec going \"I LIKE PEOPLE...PLACES...AND THINGS...\"\n\nAnd the problem is: the way McQuiston didn't do basic research about the train line is emblematic of the way McQuiston didn't do basic research about the surrounding area and the broader city. McQuiston, to their credit, does have a sort of general idea that NYC is a diverse place, that queer people can meet lots of other queer people here, that it's fun, and the the Q line at Coney Island ends in a really pretty vista that includes the Wonder Wheel. These things are mostly correct, and that's great! But they're also a pretty shallow dive into what makes NYC NYC, and on top of that the way all that gets strung together feels riddled with moments where the book reveals how very much it doesn't know about the area.\n\nIt's not that McQuiston's city is bad. It's diverse, in its own way. There are Colorful Characters. Drag queens and trans Puerto Rican boys from Long Island who are psychic. Etc. But these people are not deployed to create the living city that's actually here. They're deployed to meet a romantic plot point or swell a scene or to just construct a quippy friends-group of transplants to the city who get to fantasize about taking up the cause of anti-gentrification. It's a little bit RENT, but mostly what it reminds me of is a 21st-century queer Friends. An approach to place that really doesn't concern itself with the actual place. If you liked Central Perk, you'll love Billy's Pancake House, a similarly made up location that doesn't actually feel like it would be located in Flatbush (vampire guys? What?? Czech ladies? Only one West Indian person???). We're told this pancake place, a place that has roots nowhere but in McQuiston's fantasy land of pretend-NYC, is super important, even while the real locations and real energy of Flatbush, Brooklyn are carefully excised and omitted from the book.\n\nBecause I need you all to understand that Flatbush is not just any old place. It's not even any old Brooklyn. Flatbush is a hyper-specific part of the city, a place that even today has resisted enough gentrification to remain distinct in ways other parts of the city have largely lost. There's a lot here that makes it special, and McQuiston picked up on none of it. Except the Popeye's, for some reason. They got this one Popeye's right, which is incredible to me. But Flatbush, Brooklyn is more than a Popeye's. It's home to a nearly 50-year-old thriving West Indian-American community, several Orthodox Jewish enclaves, a booming Pakistani immigrant community, Prospect Park, the Parade Grounds, the Dutch Reformed Church, and numerous local architectural wonders like Erasmus Hall High and the Kings Theatre. Brooklyn College, the place August supposedly goes to school, educates something like 11,000 local New Yorkers, the vast bulk of whom are immigrants and/or non-white, on a strikingly beautiful campus that is integrated into the surrounding area in ways other NYC schools can only dream of (take that, NYU!) and therefore is a somewhat unique place. August is enrolled there, but spends no time there, and speaks to almost no one on the campus, because of course she doesn't, because McQuiston namedropped the school without bothering to learn anything about it or why it would, in fact, be a very critical part of August integrating herself into New York if she actually went to Brooklyn College. But it's not just Brooklyn College. Nothing unique to Flatbush merits so much as a line in this book, except for that one Popeye's.\n\nThis all made it really hard for me to handle McQuiston shoehorning in a gentrification plot about the fake pancake restaurant, after they failed to do a single bit of research to portray the real places in the area. The pancake place subplot reads like McQuiston realizing they're writing a shallow and lazy white out-of-towner fantasy and deciding to (half-heartedly) course-correct, by trying to get the reader to care about a fake location shutting down even while the real places in the book, like the Q train, keep being mined for poorly-researched nonsense scenes that ignore real-world history and context.\n\nThe most stunning example of this ignoring comes a little bit before we learn the pancake place will be shut down due to rising rents (oh no not the fake pancake place). August fantasizes about living in an \"East Village brownstone with a West Elm sofa.\" The East Village? The same East Village that had many of its low-income residents forced out due to rising rents once wealthy out of towners started coming in to fulfill their adorable RENT fantasies? Which is precisely what August is doing? That East Village? \"Of course,\" says this book. \"See, it's true that gentrification is bad because they might shut down the fictional pancake place that feels like a generic quirky diner set on any old TV show. But also the real gentrification of a formerly immigrant, formerly low-income, and formerly very queer community is something to aspire to.\"\n\nAnd here we come to another point. This book is billed as having \"a deep respect for queer history.\" But...does it? The book does devote a few pages to Jane's past as a queer woman in the 70s, and her experiences with institutional disregard for queerness and queer lives, and I will level with you: this is the best part of the book. The book should have spent, like, more than seven total pages on it, which is about what the book devotes to it. But all of that -- memories relayed secondhand by Jane, which August later like briefly sort of reflects on for a second or so -- takes place almost entirely outside NYC. So we get some queer history, but it's...over there...in New Orleans, or California, or sort of all over but not really in New York. Meanwhile, the queer present is a placeless Friends-style fantasyland romp, that takes place in the dead zone of McQuiston's pretend Brooklyn, where the real details don't matter so much. So the queer history bit of the book is effectively segregated from the parts of the book that pretend to be about a current NYC community. And this segregation makes structural sense. It is a necessary evil, so that McQuiston can keep ignoring the real Flatbush, Brooklyn in order to instead craft their breezy, placeless gang of partying queer kids.\n\nSee, queer history in NYC is intimately tied up in real struggles for community. It's a history that's woven into and inextricable from the broader history of New York's neighborhoods. The gentrification of a place like the East Village couldn't really take off until AIDs did away with a whole -- and largely queer -- swath of that neighborhood's community. The current gentrification of Flatbush is tied to city-wide real estate booms that swelled out of an initial push by city leaders in the 70s and crescendoed under Mayor Bloomberg in the 2000s, a push to favor real estate interests over real people in a bid to transform the city from a resourceless city of the poor, marginalized, and weird, to a place where the wealthy could invest in luxury condos that sit empty for most of the year. This process made many affordable brownstones across the city into luxury accommodations for the hyper-wealthy, locking NYC's communities out of the places they once lived in (see, this is why it's kind of gross for a white girl from New Orleans to shed tears for the fake pancake place but then go \"oh but I'd like a brownstone in the EV, please!\"). It also hastened the clearing out of many queer spaces, spaces zoned out of existence or aggressively shut down all across the city, from the Bowery to Times Square, and sure, those spaces were in many ways unsafe and dangerous but in other ways they were all certain kinds of queer people had. When I heard Casey McQuiston was doing a time travel romance with a punk nyc lesbian from the 70s, I was like, \"Wow! There's so much to mine there! This could be interesting! We could get to see a pre-AIDs, pre-real estate capture NYC queer person crash into the historical realities we live with today! We could get a romance that looks at some fascinating, heartbreaking, and deeply interesting historical trends that underscore how the city's current problems arose in part from persistent institutional disregard for the city's queer residents!\"\n\nUm. Nope.\n\nI get that a lot of you loved this book. You all do you. To me, it took a place, community, and history that I love, and hung it out to dry to construct a bland, faux-progressive narrative of ~swoony magic~ for people who know nothing about this (largely non-white and in many ways still working class) part of New York City, and who aren't interested in learning, either.\n\nJust to say a few nice things: I did like end up mostly liking Jane? She starts out as dead air that happens to be wearing a leather jacket, but by the end she grew on me. Also, the twist with August's uncle was good until it was undercut for no reason. And some of the parties August went to were fun, although I could have done without McQuiston weirdly implying that \"New York families\" are \"landlord[s]\" (what?? Casey, there are so many poor and asset-deprived New York City-based families that have rented for generations, like what are you talking about). But overall this book mostly alienated me, and I don't know why it was set in Flatbush when it functions to basically ignore and erase the entire living community of Flatbush. Why wasn't it set in New Orleans? I guess because Casey McQuiston really likes trains and the idea of fighting NYC gentrification.\n\nIt's nice that Casey wants to be against gentrification, and in favor of subway trains. It is. But before writing another book set in NYC, Casey should consider, like, learning literally anything about these topics. I'm begging you, Casey McQuiston. Please. At the very least? Learn the name of our goddamn subway system before you write about our subway system.\n\nAugust 11, 2022\n\nMcQuiston’s stories have a way of destroying my heart in all the best deepest ways. I still well up with joy when I think about Red, White & Royal Blue , a book I still return to, from time to time, to scrape out some solace from the harsh, ugly world. I’m happy to report that none of the author’s enchantment has faded away in this sophomore novel. If anything, One Last Stop only cemented for me that I will be reading every Casey McQuiston book for as long as they keep writing them.\n\nOne Last Stop is premised upon the romance of a magical public transit encounter: the ephemeral, lightning strike of recognition when two eyes meet and something unlocks with a soft and subtle click, a sudden revealed landscape of possibility. In this novel, McQuiston gives that short-lived moment of stillness within the roiling crowd a longer lease on life—with a time travel twist.\n\nAugust, our protagonist, steps inside the Q train every day and spots the same girl with the “devastating cheekbones and jawline and golden-brown skin.” The girl looks curiously out of pattern with the life around her, as if balancing right at the teetering edge of space and time, with only August’s gaze to keep her there, rooted. Jane is strange and mysterious and utterly charming, and August feels charmed, and immediately worries at being charmed. Because it means August, who has a documented inability to leave well enough alone, has to give up her withdrawn existence and seek out the mysteries of Jane—before the awful hourglass in August’s mind runs empty and Jane vanishes from August’s life like a blown-out candle.\n\nThe first time August met Jane, she fell in love with her for a few minutes, and then stepped off the train. That’s the way it happens on the subway—you lock eyes with someone, you imagine a life from one stop to the next, and you go back to your day as if the person you loved in between doesn’t exist anywhere but on that train. As if they never could be anywhere else.\n\nOne Last Stop hit me in so many ways. With clear-eyed prose and tender characterization, McQuiston describes the shape of young adulthood, the compendia of fears and hopes and longings that many of us are so intimately, intolerably acquainted with: about a future that yawns out to the horizon hungry and unknown, and a past that hangs over everything like an ineradicable ghost, the two pressing so hard on either side that there’s scarcely any room left for the present at all.\n\nThere's a specific feeling that this novel captures with so much clarity and grief: the state of being in your twenties and feeling that the years have fallen right out of your pocket when you weren’t looking, that you’ve been merely drifting along, a feather caught on a draft, with no roots to sink into the ground, and awakening suddenly, dazed to realize that you are lonely in some horrifically deep way. That you’ve been living outside and away from yourself, with no possessions to spindle into memories, no place or person to call home. This thematic exploration is so honest and true and sharp, and it lands so powerfully on the page because the author sees their characters—really sees them—, all the humiliating things in their hearts, the fears and longings that push and pull at them in a hundred painful ways and makes us see ourselves in them with the wondrous reciprocity of a reflection in the mirror.\n\nAugust, who’s existed on a diet of solitude and caution for years, told herself that love and close friendships were things that happened to other people and in faraway places, and that some people were simply meant to be lonely, were made to disappear. August held her secrets close and her pocketknife closer, and locked away all thoughts of being loved, being known, being wanted before they could turn into a real longing inside her head, something she could ask for and be denied. That is, until our lonely and wary protagonist is gently ambushed by a motley crew of strangers (consisting of an annoyingly perceptive psychic, a gentle nerd with arsonist tendencies, a former trust-fund baby, a drag queen, and a delightfully butch immortal) who offer her a gift as precious and simple as friendship.\n\nThe portrayal of found-family in this book is more comforting than a hug. On the page blooms the kind of love that is offered with both hands, freely and wholeheartedly—and I'm hard put to think of anyone who wouldn't be shocked into pure longing reading about it. August’s friendship with this tangled, mismatched family of people rose like a spring tide, hurtling toward her in great waves of terrifying tenderness, and August—who has lived for so long on so little love—was utterly stunned to be caught in its blast. August did not remember any world where she did not distrust everything, where she wasn’t always hideously alive to the possibility of disaster; she didn’t know how to fit friendship into her life, how to adjust herself within this new, bewildering configuration. But through failed séances, drag shows, and late-night brunches, August’s hopes begin to snap through her fears, and her feeling of being nowhere slowly, exquisitely gives way to the feeling of being home.\n\nAnd, of course, there's Jane. Also known (mostly to August) as: \"tall butch subway angel\" Jane, \"the guitarist of an all-girl punk rock band called Time to Give August an Aneurysm\" Jane, \"dark-haired and ruinous\" Jane, \"sexy poltergeist\" Jane, \"distressingly hot\" Jane, \"a smirking shot of dopamine\" Jane, etc etc.\n\nAugust and Jane are a gorgeous double act. They are opposites who fit so perfectly into the jagged contours of each other. Where August is quiet and cautious and pulled into herself, Jane is bright and loud and lively, as if she contains too much energy for the confines of her body. August, whose upbringing was defined by a dark family tragedy, is versed in the art of keeping her head down and keeping everyone at a carefully measured distance, but Jane, on the other hand, is a carelessly sociable fighter, an activist, and a runaway, gliding through life like an exposed wire. Jane’s entrapment outside of time—and August’s desperate attempts to loosen whatever hold the Q train has on Jane—gives their collision a precarious, doomed edge, but it is the shape and texture of the relationship they slowly build between them that form the thread holding the beads of this novel together. And it is such a joy to discover. Their moments together will make you feel light and giddy enough to float off the ground: the intense, longing gazes through train windows, the strictly-for-research stolen kisses, the laughter in between feeding each other overstuffed dumplings.\n\nThere aren’t perfect moments in life, not really, not when shit has gotten as weird as it can get and you’re broke in a mean city and the things that hurt feel so big. But there’s the wind flying and the weight of months and a girl hanging out an emergency exit, train roaring all around, tunnel lights flashing, and it feels perfect. It feels insane and impossible and perfect. Jane reels her in by the side of her neck, right there between the subway cars, and kisses her like it’s the end of the world.\n\nThere is a line in this book that I cannot shake from my brain: “ you gotta make your own place to belong .” One Last Stop is a compass, and a harbor, to those of us who have yet to make their place to belong—those of us who suffer the scarcity or absence of love, who are collecting more bruises of unbelonging every day. It is a shining paean to the extraordinarily healing power of love and queer communities, to that inimitable joy of finding another like yourself, of grappling and strengthening and being together. You might turn the last page, dear reader, and feel a little raw, a little chafed, like a still-gaping wound, but you will also feel hopeful, determined, and ready to carve your own place to belong.\n\nMay 1, 2021\n\nreading vlog available now.\n\nMy biggest issue was August as a protagonist. Most of her actions felt very convenient and the way that the things continued to fall into place for her [ such as never having to do any assignments, to the way her family was intertwined with Jane's story, to the way she was absent from work for long stretches of time and was yet still able to pay her share of the rent and never get fired ] was all too coincidental for me. So much of the book also had the romance feeling very one-sided to me, and not in a fun unrequited way, but in a rather disturbing I was uncomfortable with how the relationship had been framed way. There was something about this dark-skinned Asian woman being saved by this white girl from the south that just rubbed me the wrong way. The way the narrative was framed as Jane being in this position where she couldn't remember anything without August and August being the key to unlocking everything, it never felt as though Jane had any sort of agency in a story that was essentially about her but was being relayed to us through August. Even August was odd as several times throughout the novel it read as though we were experiencing things through an unnamed third narrator as the running commentary in the book just didn't make sense. It was also hard for me to believe that August would dive so headfirst into trying to unlock the mystery surrounding Jane given how the novel sets her up as no longer wanting to be in the kind of life her mother had raised her in, and even the final decision August makes about her future later in the book doesn't seem grounded in any kind of reality that had been conveyed to me.\n\nI also was not a fan of the pacing. This book seemed to drag for large stretches of filler content only to then speed through what could have been important and plot-related content. Not that I think any of it would have actually helped because by the time I hit the 50% mark I was fully ready to call it a day and be done with this reading experience. By that point, things had been o slow to develop that the adding tensions didn't really do anything for me as a reader. Especially given that as a romance I knew that nothing bad could really happen to our characters and the efforts in the last third to subvert that were more annoying than feeling like they offered any kind of meaningful payoff.\n\nOverall I did not enjoy my time reading this and I likely would not recommend it to others as I simply had too many issues and there weren't nearly enough things I enjoyed to counterbalance any of the things that didn’t work for me.\n\nJanuary 3, 2024\n\nThe thing about this book is that it is fundamentally about one of the worst subcategories of human there is:\n\nPeople who engage in PDA on public transit.\n\nYes, there is a lot of good in this. Wonderful background characters, for example. Great banter. A through-line theme of gay rights. Pancake descriptions. People who do drugs and have sex and are deeply and profoundly irresponsible (my favorite kind of people both of the fictional and reality-based varieties).\n\nBut it almooooost doesn't matter. Because the protagonist and the love interest are both very realistically PDA-ers.\n\nBasically what I am saying here is that I liked everything about this except for three things: the romance and the two biggest characters.\n\nAnd it turns out those are kinda important.\n\nBottom line: I love to be a curmudgeon with an unpopular opinion that is sure to shower hate upon me!\n\n------------\n\ncurrently-reading updates\n\nIT IS FINALLY TIME.\n\n------------\n\ntbr review\n\nall i want in life is a copy of this book, and also the outfits the characters are wearing on the cover.\n\nthis seems reasonable to me, so i will begin waiting by my mailbox now.\n\n------------\n\n...2021?!???!!!1\n\n------------\n\n\"may or may not involve some light romcom-style time travel\" uh\n\nmy body is ready\n\nJuly 19, 2021\n\nTotally biased because if the protagonists weren’t both women I probably wouldn’t have rated it 5 stars. But dammit the last 1/3 of the book really nailed the whole sapphic-fated-epic-once-in-a-lifetime love which is a very specific concept that is near and dear to my heart! The emotions were written so tenderly that it got me in my feels and sucked me in throughout the final act, bumping it from 4 to 5.\n\nI’m also pleasantly surprised at the author’s writing. I had my reservations before starting the book because it’s very easy to have saccharine writing and white liberal queer stereotypes for these types of stories. However, I found McQuiston to be a strong writer on both a technical level and in how they piece an atmosphere of magical/fun/spontaneous New York without being too hipster-cringe. I could tell there was lots of love and care to the city and the cast of characters, and fortunately it was executed well.\n\nSide note: the third act conflict here was actually pretty sensible. I’m glad it wasn’t a dramatic breakup like most books, and that it was a normal fight any couple would have, considering their circumstances. This is a rare thing to find in romance books (from my experience) so bonus points for this, too.\n\nApril 26, 2022\n\nAfter reading this book, I feel cognitively and emotionally weary.👉👈\n\nFebruary 8, 2021\n\nthis novel will live in my mind rent-free, it is so amazing and wholesome.\n\nWant to read\n\nDecember 16, 2019\n\nThere is a circle in hell full of all the things I would do to get my hands on this book.\n\nJuly 31, 2023\n\nCasey McQuiston’s One Last Stop follows the cynical August who’s just trying to get by in a new city and Jane, a punk lesbian displaced from the 70s, unable to leave the subway. This F/F time slip rom-com brings a nuanced exploration of queer communities past and present, full of McQuiston’s typical humour, vibrant characters and, of course, a gorgeous romance.\n\nAs with Red, White and Royal Blue, this book’s strength lay in its characters. McQuiston has this incredible ability to create authentic characters — reading their books is like peeking into real lives. I adored how One Last Stop’s diverse cast of characters played off each other, with natural dialogue and humour. In particular, our core characters — August, Jane, and August’s roommates — were fantastic together, with inside jokes and a deep love and support for one another. The found family trope in this book is incredibly well done and I loved this messy family of queer misfits.\n\n‘Jane is spun sugar. A switchblade girl with a cotton-candy heart.’\n\nJane is the perfect sexy and mysterious love interest and I’ve honestly fallen in love with her. She’s the type to throw an impromptu dance party on a broken down subway (and have the whole car dancing) while also being this gritty lesbian punk from the 70s. And McQuiston doesn’t shy away from showing this side of Jane — the radical who protested and rioted, who isn’t afraid to throw a punch and who suffered so much pain and tragedy as a lesbian heavily involved in the queer scene of the 70s. She’s also incredibly upbeat and hopeful and loving and I adored how McQuiston portrayed this without sacrificing her grit.\n\nAugust is a great main character and has quickly cemented herself as one of my favourites, and as one of the characters I relate to most. I’m also going to talk about a large part of her character, loneliness and growing up, later on — these feelings and the way she sees the world and experiences relationships really resonated with me and I adored seeing how it played into her character arc. August’s personality felt so clear — she’s cynical and full of dry humour; self-doubting and determined; she struggles to connect with other people but wants to do what’s right, even when it seems impossible. She’s this kind of ‘reformed girl detective’, as one of her roommates put it: she loves mysteries and research and reading and Jane’s the perfect enigma.\n\n‘she can’t believe Jane had the nerve, the audacity, to become the one thing August can’t resist: a mystery.’\n\nI adored both of these characters on their own, but together? That’s something else. The unravelling of the mystery surrounding Jane is flawlessly interwoven with the development of their relationship. I loved the narration when it came to describing Jane and August’s feelings for her, both the wholesome and the horny. Their relationship is incredibly tender and develops at the perfect pace. The sapphic pining and flirting and build up is immaculate and I loved it almost as much as I loved them together, they fit perfectly and naturally.\n\nThe writing and narrative styles are another area where the authenticity, the realness of this book shines through - the descriptions felt like what a real twenty-something would say, they weren’t over the top or flowery. In fact, they were often made up of millenial humour and gay yearning. Despite this, the book also had several casual instances of profoundness (although often followed by a dirty joke) and was full of beautiful, hard-hitting lines. The writing brought the story and setting to life and had the characters and their emotions leaping off the page.\n\n‘For queer communities past, present, and future’\n\nThis book was also a celebration of queer identity. McQuiston explores queer life in the past through Jane and her experiences as a lesbian in the 70s and never hesitates to show how hard those times were, the way queer people suffered. However, with Jane’s typical positivity and hope, we can also reminisce about the good times. I found these discussions incredibly moving, and I really appreciated the sensitivity with which they were handled. One Last Stop had an almost entirely queer cast and I loved how different experiences were represented and the important role queerness played. This book features a diverse range of identities, with a bisexual main character, lesbian love interest, gay, trans and queer side characters, as well as several drag queens.\n\n“And there I was, punk, Asian, dyke. Everywhere I went, someone loved me. But everywhere I went, someone hated me.”\n\nThe setting played an important role in this book and I loved how NYC was explored and presented; it felt alive and real and just as important as any of the characters. I also loved McQuiston’s portrayal of the vibrant communities of the city, the history and the ongoing gentrification. The NYC of One Last Stop felt like the real NYC: a diverse blend of people and cultures, the subtle magic of the city as well as the less magical subway rats and shitty apartments. Although, admittedly, I’ve lived my whole life in rural Scotland so I’m not exactly an NYC expert.\n\nThis book explores the aching loneliness of growing up and not finding your place or people, of feeling as if you're a universe away from your peers, spinning aimlessly and waiting for life to begin. I can see this being a book I revisit again and again, when I'm feeling lost or need to find myself, when I need the comfort of knowing that I am not the only one to have ever felt like this. Casey McQuiston has taken an experience, a feeling, that can be so isolating and written this book and these characters to tell you, you are not alone. You are not the only one. It's very powerful, being seen.\n\n‘But what I’ve figured out is, I’m never as alone as I think I am.’\n\nNow, this could make it sound depressing, but it's not: it's incredibly hopeful. This book is full of queer joy and found family and finding yourself and your place in the world, it gives you hope that one day, you too, will find your people and your purpose. Combined with McQusiton’s talent for portraying authentic characters, relationships and emotions, this book is really something special. It’s a story full of New York charm and young adult shenanigans, a romance both tender and sexy, and queer community.\n\n-\n\nI also have a video review/discussion available on my youtube channel where I talk a bit more about the characters, rep, Red, White and Royal Blue and also just gush about this book and how much it means to me so if you fancy checking that out, you’ll find it here.\n\nI also talk about books here: youtube | instagram | twitter\n\n*physical ARC received in exchange for an honest review via Melia.

Moving to New York City at twenty-three was supposed to prove to her the exact opposite, that the world is indeed just as cynical as she expected; but with a weird new group of roommates, her new job at a 24-hour pancake diner, and the gorgeous stranger who keeps magically reappearing on her morning commute, August is far from being proven right. Subway girl is Jane, and Jane is everything August could possibly want. There’s just one problem: Jane is not just some girl swept up in the nostalgia of old school rock, she’s literally been stuck on the subway since 1970. Having been confronted with the impossible, August is more than ready to help Jane get off the train, but doing so means returning to a past she promised would stay buried. Something that may be precisely what she needs in order to find a future worth believing in.\n\nOne Last Stop is marvelous, full of all the wit and charm that McQuiston brought to their first debut Red, White & Royal Blue. This book could be pitched as Nancy Drew meets a time travel romantic comedy, which are two things I never expected to be mashed together in a contemporary novel. When it comes to Casey McQuiston however, I have learned to expect the unexpected. Their previous book is proof of that. In her sophomore novel, McQuiston crafts a heartwarming testament to the queer community wrapped up in 70’s nostalgia and breakfast food. The characters shine through in the same way that those in Red, White & Royal Blue did, yet there is a realness to the space in which they occupy that is wholly different. Set in the backdrop of New York City, this story brings together a diverse group of people, creating one of the most wholesome queer-found families I have read in a long time. Though most of the plot deals with August and her quest to save Jane from the subway, there is a lot going on in the background with the side characters and their own lives. I can again report that I have formed an unhealthy attachment to certain characters that aren't the core focus of a novel (Nora Holleran and Wes I am looking at you). There is just something about the way that McQuiston writes their characters, how genuine each of them comes across on the page, and how I begin to feel for every single one without fail. The variety of relationships portrayed in this novel make it shine even more so. Casey McQuiston is clearly becoming a force to be reckoned with in new adult romance, an author I know I can rely on for impactful queer stories. I'll never stop being grateful for everything they have done, past, present, and future. This book is straight-up magic, a beautifully crafted love letter to belonging, community, and finding your place in the world.\n\nThank you to NetGalley and the publisher for providing this arc in exchange for an honest review\n\nTrigger warnings: racism, homophobia, anxiety, death of a loved one, blood\n\nJune 4, 2021\n\nYou guys! This. Book.\n\nOne Last Stop is a sapphic chaotic time-loop romance with immaculate junior-millennial vibes and I fell in love with the bonkers story, the incredible characters (not just the MCs but everyone in their lives), the sense of queer community and - last but certainly not least - the giddy firecracker of a romance at its heart.\n\nThink of the wildest, happiest, most impossible night of your life, one where you were surrounded by love and touched by luck and everything felt magic and cinematic. This entire book feels like that. It shattered my brain cells with its brilliance. Brilliant as in clever and beautifully done (I have an author crush), but also brilliant as in BRIGHT AND FABULOUS.\n\nI loved the wonderfully realised heroines - the way August’s upbringing sometimes hurt her but was also something that made her skilled and powerful. Watching Jane’s journey unravel, seeing so much queer history through her, seeing so much queer history at all. (Also, while we’re on the subject: MARRY ME, JANE SU. KIDNAP ME. SMILE AT ME, EVEN. SERIOUSLY, HOWEVER YOU WANNA PLAY THIS, I’M OPEN.)\n\nI even loved the supernatural element of the time loop, despite the fact that I usually hate time travel because it involves… science and maths and characters being separated? But Casey is a romance god so the whole thing was perfect and amazing.\n\nBasically… I loved this book and you should read it too.\n\nSeptember 11, 2022\n\nThis book is extremely smart, refreshing, unconventional, exhilarating, truly original with its remarkable historical references, quirky, unique, extremely likable characters!\n\nMCs are August: raised like forced Veronica Mars meets Nancy Drew style to search for the disappearance of her missing uncle with her hyper, hoarder, conspiracy theorist mother and Jane: vintage chic, friendly hipster, a true old soul, wait a minute she’s truly 70: stuck in subway and her only desire is returning back to her own timeline to leave a permanent mark on the life she’s experienced!\n\nBut in this different reading journey: you’re not introduced to these unique, peculiar MCs. The eccentric, quirky roommates stole the entire show at some chapters! They were like living in their own unique planet and they were truly living proof that being different could be so much incredibly entertaining !\n\nMyla; queer Black engineer, graduated from Columbia, changing her major, pursuing her passion in arts, putting mouse traps in every corner of house, trying to create art with awkward object choices, quickly connects with August, helping her to fight against her insecurities! She’s such lovely friend! ( her relationship with her adoptive Chinese mother and her heartfelt contribution to this story are also most meaningful parts of the book.)\n\nNiko: trans Latino psychic, reciting Neruda poems to plants, inventing original games in household, trying to be bartender but he didn’t achieve his goal yet!\n\nWes: depressed Jewish tattoo artist, concentrating on his daily hobby to disassemble and rebuild a piece of IKEA furniture, living like a ghost, lurking around the apartment.\n\nLet’s not forget friendly, entertaining, drag queen accountant neighbor Annie who has been in love with Wes for years!\n\nThe book is not only great representation of LGBTQ community by presenting us a various characters from different genders, sexualities, it also helps us to learn more about different cultures, religions, philosophies.\n\nThe book also sheds light to some of the most devastating, shameful events of the history including gay mass murders that occurred at Upstairs Lounge fire, 2016 Pulse shooting.\n\nAugust is raised to find missing people when 70 years old Jane who is Chinese lesbian has no idea why she’s trapped in subway, she thinks she has to find a way to solve her problem. But lots of tender kisses, blooming feelings will not help them to find a proper solution.\n\nThis is heartbreaking impossible love story centered around civil right movements, well crafted clever characters with thought provoking writing style.\n\nI enjoyed this book and I liked the historical time travel helps us to learn our lesson for being more respectful to the diversity, becoming more open minded, acceptive, kind, understanding people!\n\nI am not still so sure about the science fiction/ time travel premise of the story but overall the characters, the originality, the well researched parts drag you into story, you don’t want to leave it and fully enjoy your unique experience!\n\nMillions of thanks to NetGalley and St. Martin’s Griffin for sharing this incredible digital reviewer copy with me in exchange my honest opinions.\n\nMay 4, 2021\n\nThis book was queer, found-family perfection and I loved it with every single fiber of my being!!!!!!!!! It was the perfect mix of hilarious and heartwarming and horny as heck and I just really, really fucking loved it and I cannot wait for all of you to fall just as much in love with August and Jane as I did. Brb while I swoon to the moon and back bc this book was absolutely EVERYTHING\n\nAugust 3, 2024\n\nCasey McQuiston...\n\nIt's nearly impossible for me to review this without swooning like a fangirl, but I'll give it my best shot.\n\nIn One Lost Stop, we follow 23-year old college student, August, who has recently moved to New York City for school.\n\nAmongst the hustle and bustle of the city, August is on a journey of self-discovery. She's on her own for the first time and is a little desperate to find her place in the larger world around her.\n\nSecuring a room in an apartment with three other people, as well as taking a job at a 24-hour pancake diner, seem like steps in the right direction.\n\nAugust is establishing herself as a functioning-adult, no matter how meager her resources, yet she still feels alone.\n\nThe stars align, however, the day she meets a girl on the Q. The sexy and mysterious, Jane, gives August a scarf in her hour of need. After that, August cannot get the subway girl out of her mind.\n\nSubsequently, she runs into Jane every time she is on the train and a relationship develops. It very quickly becomes clear that something about Jane is a little off.\n\nJane's not just a random punk rocker, razorblade girl with a cotton candy heart, taking her style inspiration from the 1970s. She's actually from the 1970s, and somehow, someway, finds herself trapped on the Q-line.\n\nI know this seems like a trippy idea, but it was such a phenomenally fun and creative way to frame a story.\n\nAugust coming to the revelation that Jane cannot leave the train and trying to figure out what exactly that means and why; it was bloody fantastic and so incredibly entertaining.\n\nAugust's roommates, Myla, Niko and Wes, all become involved in the relationship, as well as their neighbor, Annie. Together this vastly diverse group of souls evolve into one of the most beautiful found-families that I have ever read.\n\nEach person had their own unique story, voice, personality and contribution to August's growth and maturation. I absolutely adored the way they interacted and supported one another.\n\nFriendship goals. McQuiston packed so much into this book and watching the evolution of August's character was immensely satisfying.\n\nThere were many moments when I laughed, a few when I felt my heart-breaking and times where I was just left contemplating this thing we call life.\n\nThe release date for this book coinciding with the 1st day of Pride month couldn't be more perfect!\n\nThe representation includes a plethora of Queer identities and romances. I particularly enjoyed how OLS is just a story of Queer individuals living their lives in the way they choose.\n\nIt didn't really have individuals having to hide who they were, or having to come out to anyone in a dramatic way.\n\nThey were just living their day-to-day lives in New York City; dealing with family, work, relationships, LIFE. There was a certain sense of peace to be found in that, even when the narrative got a little crazy.\n\nI think August learned a lot from her friends. Particularly how to open up, be herself and allow herself to need and accept other people in her life.\n\nThat it was okay if things were complicated, what with her love interest being trapped in time and all.\n\nJane was a fascinating character as well. I loved how her life was pieced together through her continual interactions with August.\n\nIt was particularly clever how McQuiston used Jane's character, in a way, as a plot device to compare the experiences Jane had, as a Queer person in the 1970s, versus the experiences that August and her friends have in the present time. It felt like a subtle, respectful nod to those who came before.\n\nAt the end of the day, this book has it all. If you enjoyed Red, White & Royal Blue, you should love One Last Stop. It's next level. This book made me overflow with feeling!\n\nThank you so much to the publisher, Macmillan Audio, for providing me with a copy of this to read and review. I greatly appreciate the opportunity!\n\nA new favorite!!!\n\nJuly 30, 2021\n\nThank you St. Martin's Griffin for the ARC! All opinions are my own.\n\nedit: i’m lowering this down to 4 stars simply because there’s a line the author included which basically says “yeah no one is racist anymore; racism has been fixed” (august said it) and i didn’t catch that when i read it the first time but Sami @samisbookshelf on tiktok has a great video explaining it.\n\ni still think the author is great and we should continue supporting them. but i have to agree it’s disappointing something unrealistic like that was included in this book.\n\ngreat book. Not only did i connect to almost every character, but each character now holds a special place in my heart. This story may be a work of fiction but i don't think i have ever read anything more real. The romance? 10/10 The intricate plot? 10/10. My emotions? all over the place. There were many feel good moments, cute moments, emotional moment, and heart touching moments that had me shedding actual tears. Don't be fooled, this ain't a sad book. It's just the rawness and emotionally driven characters got to me.\n\nJanuary 23, 2024\n\nThe short version is: This author just isn’t for me, but I’m happy for them and I hope more queer books get published because of their success.\n\nThe slightly longer version is: They have sex on the New York subway eeeeeeEEEeEeeEEewWwWWWW nooooooOOOOOOoooooooOOOOOOO.\n\nThe long version is:\n\nI couldn’t finish Red, White, and Royal Blue, but I wanted to support the first queer-girls romance to get this much publishing hype. And while I liked it more than reading about relentlessly romanticized imperialist nouveau riche/old money boys, I found the depiction of New York to be such utter B.S. that it really threw me off. On the spectrum of love letters to New York, where N.K. Jemisin’s fantastic The City We Became is on one end and Taylor Swift’s “Welcome to New York” is on the other, One Last Stop is touching the Swiftie side.\n\nThe premise sounded cute but it turns out I fundamentally hate it. I’m tired of people who make jokes about subway delays and expensive rent in New York, but they haven’t actually lived in the city long enough to register how bad things have gotten, why they’re happening, and how the quality of life in New York is decreasing. In this book, subways are delayed because queer time-slipped ghosts are feeling electrically horny. It uses a real problem that is happening now and happening for distinct, political reasons and turns it into an apolitical cutesy plot point.\n\nSometimes I really like mixing fantasy with real life, like in P. Djeli Clark’s Ring Shout, where a real life KKK propaganda film has fantastical dark powers, or N.K. Jemisin’s The City We Became, where Starbucks is infiltrated by Lovecraftian monstrosities. But I think the difference is that those books acknowledge political realities and use fantasy elements to highlight them. This book uses fantasy to hide reality. There’s no de Blasio in this book, no corrupt Albany controlling the MTA from afar, no mention even of anyone facing consequences for being late to school or work when the train stops.\n\nNothing bad has ever happened in this version of New York. This is a New York where you love your roommates, who immediately turn into the chosen queer family of your dreams—who all smoke pot and love astrology, of course. Where you’re a white transplant from the South but you never have to think critically about race or experience the least bit of racial or cultural tension. Where you don’t have to take your college midterms on time but somehow you still pass (lollllll whaaaaat) and your professors congratulate you for having a great GPA. Where you get a job easily and coincidentally at the first diner you walk into, without even having to properly apply and without any restaurant experience. And of course this diner is full of Classic New York Archetypes who all hold infinite wisdom on account of having lived in New York for so long. :)\n\nThen it was just small things that got me: She buys a used mattress off of Craigslist. I’m, like, pretty sure no one has ever done that in New York. Her apartment is now 100% infested with bed bugs, but we never hear about it. She eats food on the subway constantly. I have never seen people eating on the subway without getting chastised by strangers. There’s this scene where August and Jane walk between train cars, but they talk about it like they’re skydiving or cave exploring. It literally says it’s something Jane does “to feel alive,” and I’m still so confused by this. Walking between train cars on the subway is something people do all the time.....? I literally reread this part because I felt like I was missing something. Tbh, usually when women walk between subway cars it's because men are being creepy to them. I just can't buy into it being a queer mountain climbing adventure, sorry.\n\nMcQuiston’s whole brand just isn’t for me, and that’s fine. I really hope their success creates more opportunities for queer books in mainstream publishing.\n\nFor fantasy books I liked about contemporary New York: The City We Became by NK Jemisin (have I mentioned that enough times yet?) and The Changeling by Victor Lavalle.\n\nFor contemporary f/f romances I recommend: The Music and the Mirror by Lola Keeley and Satisfaction Guaranteed by Karelia Stetz-Waters.\n\nFor a historical queer book set in New York: The House of Impossible Beauties by Joseph Cassara\n\nJune 14, 2022\n\nFor the first time in a multitude of months, I have finished a book not for work or class! This is extremely exciting given one of my New Year’s resolutions is to start reading again!\n\n“I swear to God, if a ghost kills me, I’ll haunt the shower. You guys will never have hot water again.”\n\nOne Last Stop is an excellent romance between August, a bi former amateur detective recently moved to New York in search of a home, and Jane, a Chinese lesbian displaced in time from the 1970s.\n\nI think the strongest element of this book is probably the found family. There’s a charming roommates Wes, Nico, and Myla; her neighbor, Annie/Isaiah, the object of Wes’s affection; Winfield, Jerry, and Lucy of her pancake shop. But there’s a lot to love about the romantic and character elements of this as well. August’s cool narration, unwilling to let on deep feeling, is ultimately rooted in her past with her mother, but its writing is slow-building. The slow unveiling of the mysteries of Jane’s character is so excellent, with a perfect balance between interesting twists and her growing humanity. And the sex scenes... are good. Good sex is hard to write. That's all I'm going to say.\n\n“Two different generations of messy, loud, brave and scared and brave again people stomping their feet and waving hands with bitten nails, all the things they share and all the things they don’t. the things she has that people like Jane smashed windows and spat blood for.”\n\nMcQuiston refers to One Last Stop in their epilogue as an \"Unbury Your Gays\" book, and I think that's an apt description for what this book does so well: It takes a character long thought dead, and gives her new life. Whether in August's life or not, August has allowed for Jane to have new life. Through her queerness, she is reborn. And that's what is, I think, so resonant about this book: When queerness has so often led us to death, it here allows for new life.\n\nBlog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Spotify | About |\n\nRead\n\nNovember 12, 2022\n\nOhhhh I loooooved this! It was unique and adorable and everything I wanted and more. I loved August and Jane and found their relationship has a ton of chemistry. I will say I found that the synopsis almost gives away too much, I think this is one that would be great to go into blind. It didn’t affect my enjoyment but I think the initial intrigue was a bit lost on me. This has amazing characters all around, a found family you root for, and really celebrates the LGBTQ+ community in a beautiful way. It was unexpected and just such a fantastic read.\n\nRead\n\nJuly 19, 2021\n\nWhen August moves to New York City, she thinks the city will prove her right that magic and earth-shattering love stories don’t exist in real life. But then she spots Jane and soon August’s subway crush develops into something much deeper. There’s just one problem: Jane isn’t from this time. She’s from the 1970s, stuck in a year that is not her own. You will swoon!\n\nAugust 13, 2021\n\nNajcudowniejszy romans na świecie. Dał mi ogrom ciepła i otulił mnie miłością.\n\nJune 1, 2021\n\nrep: bi mc with anxiety, Chinese American lesbian li, Black sapphic sc, Puerto Rican American trans sc, gay Jewish sc, Black gay sc, Black pan sc, Czech sc\n\ntw: past homophobic violence, off page death\n\nReview also on Reads Rainbow. ARC provided by the publisher.\n\nI am once again crying about fictional lesbians. Actually Jane Su is the fictional lesbian, she's the book girlfriend, she's the blueprint. This is really all for her. I'm not in a group chat called “Dicks out for Jane Su” for nothing.\n\nThis of course is not to say that other parts of the book don’t work. In fact, they work perfectly well. If you’re not expecting exact science from this time-travel book, that is... It's not about science, it's about people coming together and loving each other with their whole hearts.\n\nYes, this is a romance. And it might actually be one of the best f/f romances to ever enter the mainstream. There are multiple reasons why I say that, but the most important one is the intensity of emotions and feelings between August and Jane. It's not usual for sapphic books to allow their characters to be, well frankly, more than a cute aesthetic. Unlike m/m romances, the ones starring sapphic characters tend to be more soft and delicate, and tend to focus on how sweet it is that those people love each other, and not so much on the fact that they’re horny.\n\nOne Last Stop doesn't have those hesitations, it explores all sides of the relationship between August and Jane. It uses the same kind of focus and detail to talk about August yearning after Jane, as it does to talk about August finding Jane hot and desirable. I mean, for the love of god, August literally keeps a journal of all the sex things she wants to try with Jane. Name one other mainstream sapphic book doing it like that.\n\nBut it's not just a romance. It's also a story about people loving each other in various different ways. It's a story about found family, which is frankly a quintessential kind of story for LGBT folks. This idea that we will always find each other, and we will always understand each other, and support each other. That is a very definition of the found family. And is portrayed in the most beautiful way in One Last Stop. It works so well because the characters are fleshed out to the extent that they truly do feel like real people.\n\nAnd because literally the whole cast is LGBT, Casey provided for themself a great opportunity to talk about our community. It doesn’t come across as a history lesson, but at times that’s what it essentially is. And given how little we ourselves know about the LGBT people who came before us, it’s actually an excellent choice. It also helps that Jane is from the 70s’ and provides a whole other perspective on the community.\n\nI initially said that One Last Stop is “a gay history lesson wrapped up in a found family wrapped up in a romcom wrapped up in, once again!, a love letter to the LGBT community” and I was right. It’s also a gift to sapphics everywhere.\n\nJune 23, 2021\n\n*Updated with review*\n\nIt makes me so sad that I didn't enjoy this as much as I wanted to! This was one of my most anticipated releases of 2021 but I had a few issues with it.\n\nWe stumble, yet again, onto eternal chapters. I encountered this same issue in Red, White and Royal Blue but these felt even longer (I'm talking 30[+] pages at a time). This contributed to the scenes feeling choppy and the transitions being out of place which led to the story feeling very disjointed.\n\nThen we have the characters, sadly I did not care for anyone else besides Jane. The psychic's guy whole personality being only the \"psychicness\" was something I didn't enjoy. I personally felt like it was overwritten and just put into the book because that's hip and in and people have taken such a big liking to it. On the flip side, Myla annoyed me half the time and the other half she was mildly funny because she was written that way.\n\nWhich brings me to my other issue, these characters were given no room to be themselves. Everything fell into a position of convenience for August and it was deliberately done that way on the author's end. They don't stand on their own nor have a life of their own. The romance felt incredibly one sided to me as well and I was a little uncomfortable reading it. Yes, their chemistry was good and yes, they had their cute moments. But it definitely came across as August being way more into Jane than equally into each other.\n\nAlso, Jane's story being so connected to August's was a little off to me? I don't know, I can go into a whole other rant about the white person being the POC's salvation but... yeah not the day for that🥲\n\nI'm sure there are things I'm forgetting as I type this up but I'm sure they'll come up in my monthly wrap up.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nJune 13, 2021\n\nI'm a jaded, long-time romance reader, and I loved Red, White & Royal Blue so much that it was urgent that I keep my expectations in check for One Last Stop. One Last Stop is Casey McQuiston's sophomore book, and I thought to expect it to be anywhere near as successful as Red, White & Royal Blue would be foolish. In truth, I barely read the blurb (and then promptly forgot what I read, as is my custom with blurbs), so the book was almost wholly a surprise to me. And, guys, I loved it. I loved it so much.\n\nI started One Last Stop last night intending to just read a few chapters, and I stayed up all night last reading. I almost cried when it ended. I never wanted it to stop.\n\nHowever, when I started the story, I felt a little... uneasy. Third person, present tense writing isn't my thing, and I was feeling a little disconnected from the story. At 10% in, I wasn't sure about it, didn't know where the plot was taking me, but once I started to piece things together, I was hooked (remember, didn't read the blurb...).\n\nI'm a time-travel, time-slip junkie, and books with those elements have a huge statistical advantage over contemporary books to be favorites of mine. Imagine my utter delight when I realized the full plot of this story. I was obsessed.\n\nAlso, let me wax poetic about the chemistry. I've read a lot of romance books in my time, and I have certain preferences that are long established. I like my romances slow-burn and with enough sexual tension that it's thick and almost tangible. I like things to build and build and build until everything explodes. Casey McQuiston paced this romance perfectly. The physical and romantic chemistry grew and grew until it was unbearable, and then everything crescendoed and exploded. As someone who reads a lot of explicit romance, I would probably categorize this as on the tamer side, but because the sexual tension is incredibly built-up, it felt so satisfyingly erotic.\n\nAside from the physical, I ached for these characters. I absolutely loved them together and I was rooting for them as a couple like I haven't in a long time. I was near tears at time while reading, just because of my own overwhelming feelings about the romance. Casey McQuiston made me love this couple and their epic romantic story.\n\nWhile the main characters were enough to carry the story alone, the side characters were all so amazing and well-developed that it enhanced an already amazing story. I'm talking the queer cast of my dreams, each with their own backstory and interest and flaws. I fell in love with each of them, and I found myself wanting to live in a little 6-story walk-up in Flatbush, just so we could hang out. They were all so impossibly interesting and cool, and Casey McQuiston wrote them all with such care and nuance.\n\nThere are so many factors that I can't touch upon completely in this review because it's already extremely long and embarrassingly gushy. I'm talking about the Asian rep (an Asian butch character in a leather jacket, seriously be still my f*ing heart), the bisexual MC in a F/F romance, DRAG QUEENS, the humor, the backdrop of New York (in my opinion, the greatest city in the world), the 24 hour pancake house, and the mystery of the MCs uncle. I could wax poetic about this book for another 1,000 words, but instead, just read the book yourself. I'm seriously just ordering you to order it now.\n\nCasey McQuiston, you did it. One Last Stop was the time-slip, sapphic romance of my dreams.\n\n*Copy provided in exchange for an honest review*\n\ngoodreads|instagram|twitter|blog\n\n****************************************\n\nI'm not one to post \"casting\" pictures, but I couldn't help but picture my ultimate crush.
