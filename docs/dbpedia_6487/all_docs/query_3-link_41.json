If you do that,\n\nthen you are failing in your job.\n\nIt is not that there is anything\n\nwrong with controversy. Indeed, it is\n\ngood. Lack of it sometimes is a sign\n\nof a poor editor. But when there is\n\nnothing of a controversial nature on\n\nwhich to comment, the editor should\n\nnot be chastisedand it Is when\n\nthere is nothing controversial that\n\nthe editor's job becomes thr most\n\ndifficult.\n\nCordelia, there exists the unfor-\n\ntunate tradition within our college\n\nsocieties that the good campus news-\n\npa. er is the radical newspaperop-\n\nposed to a conservative organ which\n\nstands up to he counted when circum-\n\nstances demand it. If you're not ag-\n\ngravating some of the people all the\n\ntime, then you're failing in your\n\ntask.\n\nThis almost universal conception\n\nis wrong. It is wrong because it as-\n\nsumes radicalism is good journalism;\n\nit is wrong because our campus news-\n\nI apers become organs of 20-year-old\n\nthought instead of an outlet for ma-\n\nture reasoning and criticism within\n\nlimit.\n\nEditorial opinion is worthless with-\n\nout reportorial presentations to serve\n\nas its basis. Unless \"facts\" are in\n\nevidence to support allegations, unless\n\nyour reporters disclose fallacies and\n\nuncover bad j ractieethen the edi-\n\ntor stands helpless in the perform-\n\nance of his office.\n\nCordelia, listen to your criticism.\n\nBut never succumb to it if it requires\n\na radical newspaper whose editorial\n\ncolumns are ill-conceived and dis-\n\naffect an innocent party all for the\n\nsake of producing a controversy.\n\nAnd Woman's College students, if\n\nthe only time you take an interest in\n\nyour newspa; er is when the editor\n\nseems to be failing in her job, then\n\nyou aie even more guilty of apathy\n\nlowa i (I expression than all \"The\n\nCarolinian\" Staff combined.\n\nIt is, after all. not a publication of\n\nthose whose names appear on its\n\nmasthead.

Every-\n\none talks about it but no one does\n\nanything.\n\nI thought I would digress on the\n\npresent situation, not that I have\n\ncome up with any brain storming\n\nideas, but I have heard several stu-\n\ndents make some excellent sugges-\n\ntions and thought they might be\n\nworth passing along to you for opin-\n\nion on these discords.\n\nAs usual, whether talking or writ-\n\nIng, I guess it is best that we put\n\nthe unpleasant part first and that\n\nwill enable us to look forward to\n\nsom thing leasant toward the end.\n\nTo get rig! t down to what seems\n\no be the biggest gripe concerning\n\nour parking situation, besides in-\n\nadequate room of course, i the one\n\ndealing with visitors or non-college\n\npersonnel on our campus I have\n\npersonally heard from a close friend\n\nof mind that. as a visitor here, he\n\nhas received numerous tickets and\n\nafter letting them accumulate, he\n\ntalked Jo someone with authority\n\nand lad them torn up.

'\n\nv\n\nLetter To\n\nStudents\n\nDear Students;\n\nI have been a s udent here for four\n\nyears and at the beginning of every\n\nquarter I hear more and more com-\n\nplaints concerning registration and\n\npi -registration. Finally the SGA has\n\ndecided to see if it can help find pos-\n\nsible solutions to this problem\n\nthrough verbal ami written suggest-\n\nions and lans from you, the stu-\n\ndents.\n\nIt seems that the present system\n\nhas a number of flaws in it which if\n\nironed out would ease the congest-\n\nion on Registration Day. An example\n\nof this could he seen this past Regis-\n\ntrar ion Day as all the students tried\n\nfrantically to register before noon. It\n\nis my belief that each department\n\nshould hold its majors cards until\n\nthe specific classes senior, junior,\n\nsophomore, and freshmanare sched-\n\nuled to sign up for subjects. Allowing\n\nstud nts to register for classes in\n\ntheir major and minor fields on a\n\nnight before Registration Day would\n\nI revent some confusion.\n\nBelow I am listing a couple of so-\n\nlutions which I think could help our\n\nregistration problem. If you think\n\nthey are good let us know by tearing\n\nthem out and dropping them in the\n\nballot box which will be set up in\n\nStudent Union. If you have other sug-\n\ngestions write them down and drop\n\nthem in too.\n\nDo ou think it would help ii' tea-\n\nchers wouldn't sign up a student be-\n\nfore 1 is class is scheduled to regist-\n\ner?\n\nDo you think it would help on Reg-\n\nistration Day if each department\n\nwould already have its majors and\n\nminors signed up by having two\n\nnights for pre-registration and then\n\nfollow the above schedule on Reg-\n\nistration Day?\n\nWould a planned schedule of the\n\nrourses to be taught by each depart-\n\nment for tie entire year be of help\n\nare a visitor, much less more than\n\none If an East Carolina student\n\nreceives a ticket in town he will pay\n\nor else. If a visitor from town gets\n\na ticket at DC his chances of paying\n\nare very small. This is a well known\n\nfact. Sure, the visitors don't know\n\nwhere to park when coming on cam-\n\npus. We realize that there is only\n\none area on the entire campus- for\n\nvisitor parking. Why don't East\n\nCarolina erect signs at each entrance\n\nto the campus stating that visitors\n\nshould park only in designated park-\n\ning spaces in that area or be sub-\n\nject to the $2.00 fine that students\n\nhave to pay? Then they would have\n\nno excuse for illegal parking.\n\nMany students, including myself,\n\nwonder why a college the eize of ours\n\ncould not adopt a uniform policy on\n\nparking that would have to be fair\n\nto everyone. Mr. Melvin Buck has no\n\ndoubt spent many sleepless nigh'ts\n\ntrying to figure out a system that\n\nwould be fair, adequate, time saving,\n\nmoney saving and welcomed by all.\n\nWe all know that Mr. Buck along\n\nwith Mr. Harrell and his men are\n\n'Cussin' N Discussin'\n\nBy NANCY LILLY\n\nContrary to the opinions of my carrying a\n\ntwo readers, this column isn't in the\n\naper merely to give me a chance to\n\nmake sarcastic remarks about ad-\n\nministration, faculty, students, and\n\nother forms of animal life here on\n\ncampus.

Enough opinions have\n\nbeen expressed on the subject. Most\n\nof them are unfavorable, particularly\n\nfrom the viewpoints of faculty and\n\nadministration. You may decide for\n\nyourself. These are several incidents\n\nwhich have happened to me in the\n\nlast year or so.\n\nThe night before exams begati\n\nlast spring quarter a girl who lived\n\ndown the hall came into my room\n\nto you?\n\nmould seniors have the privilege\n\nof registering first?\n\nSincerely,\n\nRay Joyner, Chairman of SGA\n\nCommittee for Improvement on\n\nRegistration Day.\n\ndoing an excellent job and their first\n\njob is to keep the student from park-\n\ning in an improper place so he will\n\nnot leave himself wide open for a\n\nticket.\n\nOne suggestion as to how all these\n\nconditions might be alleviated is one\n\nconcerned with the numbers system.\n\nWe mean by this, paint a number in\n\nwhite paint on every student dorm-\n\nitory parking slot. The white num-\n\nber would certainly be quite domi-\n\nnant against the black asphalt. For\n\nexample, start with the parking slots\n\nbe! ind Ragsdale Dormitory running\n\nwest towards the cafeteria. Paint\n\nnumber \"1\" in the first slot, number\n\n\"2\" in the second, etc. Every dormi-\n\ntory parking slot on the campus\n\ncould be numbered. Then on regis-\n\ntration day assign a particular num-\n\nber to the driver whose dormitory\n\nis next to the numbered parking slot.\n\nThis assignment could be made an-\n\nnually. Then if a student came com-\n\nplaining about getting a ticket be-\n\ncause he was parked in, lets say\n\nnumber 93's parking spot and his\n\nnumber is 34, he not only deserves\n\nbook in one hand and\n\nseveral sheets of paper in the other\n\nhand. \"Will you help me?\" she\n\nasked. \"Sure. What can I do for\n\nyou?\" 1 answered. \"Well, my boy\n\nfriend got a copy of my government\n\nexam for me, but I can't answer\n\nthe questions. Will you look th.m up\n\nin the book for me?\"\n\nAnother incident happened Juring\n\na test last fall quarter. A boy in a\n\nnice white shirt and tweed sport coat\n\nsat a few- seats away from me. He\n\nevinced an extraordinary interest in\n\nthe cuffs of his shirt. They were al-\n\nmost black with pencil scribblings.\n\nAlter class, I asked bim how he had\n\nknown what questions would be on\n\nthe test so he could have written\n\nall the conect answers down. He\n\nsaid, \"Oh, Dr. 's secretary\n\nand I are real good friends\n\nAfter careful consideration, I de-\n\ncided perhaps I had better get on\n\nthe band wagon too. A casual friend\n\nof mine who always seemed to have\n\nadvance information on all tests and\n\nexams told me her secret. \"It's sim-\n\nple she said, \"if you're real good\n\nfriends with some of the boys who\n\nlive in the dormitory. My boy friend\n\nalways gets th tests for me. I don't\n\nknow for sure, but lie told me that\n\nthey have a file in the dorm with\n\ntests and exams of almost all the\n\nteachers. Besides, he has a set of\n\nkeys to two teachers' offices, which\n\nhelps a lot\n\nThere are people on this campus\n\nw o don't cheat.

And yet, there is\n\nno future in turning in the ones who\n\ndo; if you did, you would find you\n\nhad very few, if any, friends left. It\n\nwould not stop the cheating, because\n\nit's a physical impossibility to rid\n\nthe campus of all cheating students.\n\nIi you did, there probably wouldn't\n\nbe enough students left to make\n\nclasses possible.\n\nBui what's the difference? Nobody\n\ncarts anyway.\n\na $2.00 ticket but should be fined\n\n$5.00 as there could be no excuse\n\nfor something like this. Day students,\n\nemployees and college faculty mem-\n\nbers could still park ag they do. A\n\ntemporary parking area could be\n\nestablished for those dormitory stu-\n\ndent. not having an available park-\n\ning slot. Freshmen and transfer stu-\n\ndents could be assigned to the tem-\n\nporary area until the slots, one by\n\none, become vacant.\n\nThis entire suggestion is highly\n\nsimplified and many details would\n\nhave to be worked out, but it is a\n\nsuggestion and that is what we need.\n\nMany of our students have good\n\nideas right now but they will never\n\nhe noticed unless put into writing\n\nand sent to the East Carolinian or\n\nMr. Buck.\n\nIts time we quit griping about the\n\ncollege not having enough parking\n\nplaces and did something to improve\n\nthe situation from the point of view\n\nthat the students just have too many\n\ncars for the college.

Civic minded\n\nVVilming nians planned for a parade\n\nthat would have at least one float.\n\nThe event was, however, much more\n\nsuccessful than anyone had hoped\n\nfor, because it had not one, but\n\neleven float- gracing the \"big\" pa-\n\nrade.\n\nParade\n\nEach year, to that eleven-float pa-\n\nrade something has been added, and\n\nin 1957, the Azalea parade had more\n\nthan one hundred floats and bands\n\nin it. Outstanding events were held\n\na member of tre Queen's court.\n\nEast Carolina ColLge has been send-\n\ning an Azalea Queen court member\n\nfor several years. Some of these\n\nattendants were Pat Everton who\n\nwas the 1956 Azalea Princess from\n\nEas Carolina and in 1957 B tty Jc\n\nButts. For the 1958 Azalea Festival,\n\nEast Carolina has chosen Betty\n\nPhillips, a very beautiful and talent-\n\ned senior, to represent our campus.\n\nGuided Tours\n\nThere are guided tours throughout\n\nC e Wilmington area that persons\n\nof all ages enjoy.

It is\n\ni five-fingered lake in a fantastic-\n\nlly Seautiful setting. The lake and\n\neverything around it is simply in-\n\ndescribable except that one can say\n\nthat the sight is breath taking.\n\nAround the lake is a display of every\n\n'lor, and it is really magnificent\n\nduring the latter part of March and\n\nthe early j art of April.\n\nWilmington has the distinguished\n\nti 1 - of \"City of a Million Azaleas\n\nbut in any one of the gardens of\n\nplantation courts alone Cere are far\n\nmore than a million Azaleas. It has\n\nbeen suggested that this title be\n\nchanged to \"City of a Zillion Aza-\n\nleas\n\nIt is true that the millions of\n\nAzaleas, the thousands of visitors\n\nand guests, the hundreds of floats\n\nand bands, and the dozens of events\n\nfor entertainment summarize the\n\nannual Azalea Festival held in the\n\nPort City of Wilmington, North\n\nCarolina .\n\nScout Camps Need\n\nSummer Workers\n\n\"Summer is a'cumen College\n\ngirls and women graduate students\n\ninterested in summer jobs which com-\n\nbine scholastic values with oppor-\n\nunities for outdoor living will find\n\nthousand of openings awaiting them\n\nin Girl Scout camps.\n\nOpera ed by nearly 650 Girl Scout\n\ncouncils ti roughout the country, these\n\ncamps give 150,000 girls 7 through\n\n17 years old a chance to live, work\n\n.n.i lay with girls of differing back-\n\ngrounds, in the informal atmosphere\n\nif the out-of-doors.\n\nHundreds ot' counselors over 18\n\nears old are needed to share these\n\nwholesome experiences on a part-\n\nnership basis.

The results are very\n\ninter sting. Thirty-three percent of\n\nthe classes are daiir.g casually or\n\nnh.ying the field; eight percent, are\n\ngoing steady; eight percent are pin-\n\ne.l; i percent are engaged; and\n\nforty-four percent are married.\n\nIn answer to the question \"How\n\nmany different individuals have you\n\nia od?\" the average answer is that\n\naeh man has dated 52 girls and each\n\nivoman has dated 43 boys. This shows\n\nmen have \"played the field\"\n\nmore t an women. On the other hand,\n\nwhen asked \"To how many persons\n\nhave you been engaged?' 58 percent\n\nor IS men answered that they had\n\ni- en engaged once and 50 percent\n\nor 7 women that they had bten en-\n\ngaged to il different boys. A reason-\n\nexplanation for thus large dif-\n\nference could be that girls attach\n\nmore significance to being pinned\n\nban do boys. Possibly, some boys\n\nplace a pin on a girl in older to \"tie\n\ni r down\" while he makes up his\n\nmind an i she thinks that \"this is it\n\nThe last question With how many\n\nersons have you gone steady?\" indi-\n\na es that more boys have gone\n\nsteady with more different girls\n\nthan have girls shifted from boy to\n\nhoy. The figures on this are that\n\none boy has gone steady with 4 girls\n\nand on & has gone steady with 3\n\nhoy We could say that the boys\n\nhave gone steady 33 percent more\n\nor that t e girls have gone steady 25\n\npercent less.
