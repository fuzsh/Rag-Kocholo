        "text": "U.S. Senate — Incumbent Maria Cantwell (D) and Susan Hutchison (R)\n\nSenator Cantwell supports reproductive rights, CHIP, net neutrality, affordable college, worker training, universal healthcare, affordable housing, sanctuary cities, and clean energy. She’s endorsed by Sierra Club, League of Conservation Voters, NOW, and The Stranger.\n\nHutchison called Brett Kavanaugh “a brilliant jurist highly regarded across the political spectrum.” She supports a border wall. She has said deeply disgusting things about addicts. She believes in cutting regulations. She supports moving the U.S. Embassy to “Israel’s capital in Jerusalem.” To me, it seems like she’s increasingly parroting Trump talking points, including building partisan resentments.\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\n\nDistrict 1 — Incumbent Suzan DelBene (D) and Jeffrey Beeler (R)\n\nDelBene has been in the House since 2012, and her voting record shows her commitment to protecting healthcare, voting down anti-abortion legislation, and helping immigrants, refugees, and disaster victims. She voted to require research of vulnerabilities of the Keystone XL pipeline. She participated in the SNAP challenge in 2013, which involved feeding herself for a week on the average benefit level of a SNAP (food stamp) recipient. She’s for higher taxes for the wealthy, better worker training programs, and more college tuition assistance. She endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nHer opponent Jeffrey Beeler wants to “stem the tide of illegal immigration.” He thinks the ACA/Obamacare is a “debacle.” He wants to prioritize American workers over immigrant workers, and believes there is rampant abuse in immigration programs.\n\nDistrict 7 — Incumbent Pramila Jayapal (D) and Craig Keller (R).\n\nJayapal is the first Indian-American woman in the House of Representatives. She’s vocal about her opposition to the Muslim ban and child separation, and proposes alternative plans and solutions. She cares about reproductive rights, clean energy, the LGBTQ community, healthcare for all, and holding government and other entities responsible for their corruption. She wants to terminate ICE and reform immigration in a compassionate manner. She opposed Kavanaugh, AG Sessions’ marijuana crackdown, and Trump and Devos’ systemic removal of student protections. On a personal note, she seems to me like one of those championing candidates that make people excited to vote for them. She also seems like someone who manages to keep a national and international viewpoint without ever losing sight of her constituents in Seattle and their needs.\n\nKeller wants to require all employers to hire only legal residents of the U.S, and wants stricter voting regulations. He calls undocumented folks “illegal aliens” and “illegals.” He claims, “There are many cases of illegal aliens killing and child raping legal immigrants of their own ethnic group.” He wants to deny undocumented people a driver’s license, a “vote” (he implies they vote illegally), and any other “taxpayer-funded benefits.” He lists no other platforms or issues on his website.\n\nDistrict 9 — Incumbent Adam Smith (D) and Sarah Smith (D)\n\nThese are two very progressive, white democrats. Both support universal healthcare, reproductive rights, clean energy, unions, DACA, and the LGBTQ community. Both want to raise the minimum wage, enact serious gun control, protect social security, fight climate change, expand treatment for veterans, and fund education. Essentially: they have all the same core progressive “requirements.”\n\nSarah is farther left than Adam. She wants to abolish ICE, end intersex genital surgeries, require de-escalation training for all law enforcement, demilitarize the police, remove firearms possessions rights from convicted domestic violence offenders, cancel all existing student loan debt, make tuition free at public colleges and universities, provide affordable public childcare, expand disability rights, regulate the relationship between politicians and lobbyists, enact a federal jobs program, and create fair treatment for Puerto Rico. She has sections on her website for racial justice and Indigenous peoples’ rights, and seems to be an extremely well-informed ally. She’s also more anti-war than Adam.\n\nState Senate\n\nDistrict 30 — Claire Wilson (D) and incumbent Mark Miloscia (R). This is an extremely flippable seat — Clinton won it by 20 points in 2016, Obama by 19.5.\n\nMiloscia was a Democrat for 20 years before switching to the Republican party in 2014. Miloscia is pro-life but, as the Stranger points out, rather selective in his application of those “pro-child” values. The Stranger asserts that, as of July 2018, he has been completely silent about the family separation and child internment perpetrated by the Trump administration, although he claims to be pro-DACA. He wants to ban safe injection sites for drug addicts, which show evidence of reducing death by overdose. He takes PAC money, unlike Claire Wilson. He’s certainly moderate in many issues, and there are many areas, especially in his past legislative work, where I agree with him. Miloscia is endorsed by the Seattle Times for his transparency.\n\nWilson “spent 25 years working for the Puget Sound Educational Service District, specializing in early education and family involvement.” She lists her key issues as fully funding education, expanding healthcare access, protecting the environment, reforming taxes, and implementing commonsense gun laws. She wants to tax the wealthy in order to fund education and allow middle class families some reprieve. She wants to protect immigrant families and DACA recipients, increase teacher pay, invest in local traffic congestion relief, and protect reproductive rights. Wilson is endorsed by WA Senators Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray, Governor Jay Inslee, the Alliance for Gun Responsibility, EMILY’s List, Equal Rights WA, Fuse WA, LGBTQ Victory Fund, Moms Demand Action, MoveOn, NARAL Pro-Choice WA, NOW, Planned Parenthood Votes NW & Hawaii, Sierra Club, Washington Conservation Voters, and many more. Wilson also “proudly identifies as a lesbian woman,” which I believe is important to consider in terms of representation (after a candidate has proven their core competency, of course).\n\nDistrict 36 — Incumbent Reuven Carlyle (D) and Bryan Simonson (L).\n\nCarlyle won a wild 89.4% of the primary vote in August, and his pet issues seem to be education, foster care, and climate change. Progressive Voters Guide refers to him as a “tireless advocate for environmental protections and…closing wasteful tax loopholes for special interest groups.”\n\nSimonson opposes the ACA, and seems to hate that politics “is everywhere” and he “can’t even watch football in peace.” If I’ve got his Twitter right (and it certainly looks like him, but I can’t guarantee this is the same Bryan Simonson), he’s frankly disgusting. Assuming that Twitter does belong to him, he believes that Chuck Schumer is behind Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh, and called her a “garbage person.” He also claims that Obama has “Muslim brotherhood handlers,” and wants HRC and Obama locked up. He refers to undocumented folks as “illegals” and links to wildly dubious articles from Breitbart. Even if we assume the Twitter account doesn’t belong to him, he’s still inexperienced and opposes the ACA. (Update: he has since denied that the account belongs to him, in what I consider a very weird coincidence if true.)\n\nDistrict 44 — Incumbent Steve Hobbs (D) and Doug Roulstone (R)\n\nHobbs is a moderate Democrat, endorsed by such organizations as The Seattle Times, NARAL, Planned Parenthood Votes Northwest & Hawaii, and various workers unions. He lists his own key issues as bipartisanship, fully funding (and equitably distributing funds for) education, and funding strong and efficient transportation infrastructure. For job creation, he promotes his affinity for cutting red tape that inhibits small business growth, promoting reasonable tax breaks, and committing to forward-thinking businesses like “aerospace, renewable energy, and life sciences.” He’s been in office since 2007, has a background in the National Guard, and holds a Bachelor’s in political science and a Master’s of Public Administration from the UW. He’s also mixed race (his mother is Japanese), which I consider an important factor for promoting diversity and equal representation (after one’s core qualifications for the job have been established). The Times specifically praises him for his willingness to introduce new plans to achieve consensus, rather than simply downvoting the things he disagrees with and leaving it at that. The Times mentions Hobbs’ “grievous error” by voting for a bill to exempt lawmakers from the state’s Public Records Act, but nevertheless says he’s the best candidate for the job.\n\nRoulstone has a 27-year background in the U.S. Navy, and has been a small business owner for over 20 years. He’s a founder of the Snohomish Boys and Girls Lacrosse Club, and a fundraiser for the Snohomish Education Foundation. He’s an advocate for career and technical schools, and claims to be “the driving force behind the creation of the Educational Pathway Partnership in Computer Aided Design (CAD), Precision Machining and Biotech Engineering,” raising over 30 million dollars in private donations and grants to create programs at Snohomish and Glacier Peak High Schools. As far as I can tell, he lists no other issues or stances on his website. Governor Inslee appointed him briefly to the Washington House of Representatives to fill Mike Hope’s vacated seat from Oct 2014 to late Nov 2014, when Mark Harmsworth, the winner of the general election, was certified. He’s a life member of the NRA. Vote Smart claims he previously promised to work to pass legislation to require proof of citizenship in order to vote.\n\nState House of Representatives\n\nDistrict 30a — Incumbent Mike Pellicciotti (D) and Linda Kochmar (R)\n\nPellicciotti refuses to accept campaign donations from corporations. He supports government transparency, education funding, and addressing unique Federal Way area issues like combatting airplane noise. He “successfully urged the governor” to veto $80 million dollars in tax breaks for corporations, and introduced legislation to use those saved funds to reduce property taxes for low-income homeowners. He wants to expand housing for domestic violence survivors, especially as a former sexual assault and domestic violence prosecutor. He wants to expand vocational training and education funding. He’s endorsed by the Seattle Times and the Federal Way Mirror; he offers a Korean-language version of his candidate website; and he lists his own cell phone number on his website. In 2016, he was one of only 161 candidates endorsed by President Obama, where he went on to defeat Kochmar.\n\nKochmar has plenty of political experience, holds some moderate/centrist opinions, and has in the past co-sponsored bipartisan legislation. She’s somewhat vague on her positions, listing unobjectionable things like “job creation” and “crime prevention” without directly explaining what that means for her. She’s a self-professed “fiscal conservative who believes in limited government and low taxes.”\n\nDistrict 30b — Incumbent Kristine Reeves (D) and Mark Greene (R)\n\nReeves wants to increase minimum wage, paid family leave, access to healthcare, and gender equity. She wants to help veterans, improve public transportation, and champion education. She’s endorsed by NARAL Pro-Choice WA, Alliance for Gun Responsibility, WA Conservation Voters, Sen. Patty Murray, Sen. Maria Cantwell, Gov. Inslee, The Seattle Times, and many more.\n\nGreene wants to make English our state’s official language, fight the “Radical Left” takeover, stop the “Caravan” from crossing our border, and calls America “Western, Anglophone, Christian & Libertine.” He claims to receive no campaign cash from corporations. He’s anti-choice, anti-“globalist,” and wants to enact a law giving American citizens job priority over undocumented immigrants.\n\nDistrict 36a — Incumbent Noel Frame (D) and Sydney Gillman Wissel (L)\n\nFrame received 89.1% of the primary vote in August. She sponsored a bill to extend the period for voter registration. She doesn’t accept corporate contributions to her campaign, and is against massive tax breaks for large corporations and the wealthy. She lists her dedication to reforming criminal justice systems, expanding affordable housing, and prioritizing child welfare. She’s endorsed by the Seattle Times despite her less-than-ideal vote to “partly exempt the Legislature from the state Public Records Act,” after which she “expressed contrition.”\n\nOn Wissel’s Facebook page for her campaign, she replies to the issue “Balanced Budget” with “YES! A budget must balance.” She has no elected experience. The Seattle Times said she “lacks…depth on state issues.”\n\nDistrict 36b — Incumbent Gael Tarleton (D) and Matt Dubin (L)\n\nTarleton has held her job as State Representative since 2013, and received 86.8% of the vote in her primary against Matt Dubin in August. She previously served as the Port of Seattle commissioner, where she worked on environmental cleanup, as well as job creation in “maritime, aerospace, fishing, seafood, and manufacturing-industrial sectors.” Her primary issues are education, environment, and healthcare. She co-sponsored a successful bill to make community service a high school graduation requirement, and another to protect Seattle houseboat owners. She voted to pass a bill prohibiting employers from requiring sexual assault nondisclosure agreements, voted to ban bump stocks, voted to pass a bill establishing net neutrality in Washington, and (unfortunately) voted to exempt legislators from the Public Records Act, for which she has since expressed contrition. Tarleton is endorsed by the Seattle Times, NARAL Pro-Choice Washington, Planned Parenthood Votes NW & Hawaii, The Stranger, Washington Conservation Voters, Alliance for Gun Responsibility Victory Fund, and many local councils and unions.\n\nAttorney Dubin opposes I-1634 (grocery tax), and refuses to support I-1639 (gun safety) due to its “safe storage” requirements, although he does support raising the minimum age of purchase and other common sense gun safety measures. He has some ideas I support, like directing the vast money we spend on homelessness into actual effective solutions like providing housing for homeless individuals. I hope his support of such matters will push Tarleton towards similar measures.\n\nDistrict 44a — Incumbent John Lovick (D) and Jeff Sax (R)\n\nSax published 20-year-old abuse allegations claiming Lovick had sexually abused his daughter. Lovick’s daughter strongly denies these allegations, supports her father for office, and attributes them to her “estranged biological mother.” Sax’s team had previously sent the documents alleging the abuse to media outlets like the Seattle Times, which “reviewed them, independently obtained other records and interviewed his daughter, among others. In part because of his daughter’s denials…[they] declined to publish a story on the allegations.” When the media refused to publish the story, Sax’s team published it themselves. While it’s possible the allegations are still true despite Lovick’s daughter’s denials, I’d be hesitant to throw him out when there isn’t a single witness (namely, his daughter) backing the allegation. I don’t like that there are allegations out there, and I’d primary him the next chance we get, but in the meantime I’m not sure there’s evidence (and I’d take a single word from his daughter as more than enough evidence) to say he did it. I don’t know. I hate everything.\n\nDistrict 44b — Jared Mead (D) and incumbent Mark Harmsworth (R)\n\nJared Mead is endorsed by such organizations as Planned Parenthood Votes Northwest & Hawaii, NARAL Pro-Choice Washington, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, and the Alliance for Gun Responsibility, as well as WA Senators Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray. Mead is a former licensed investment banker, a two-term city planning commissioner, and just recently, a legislative aide in the State Senate. He earned his Bachelor’s from UW Bothell in International Studies and Business. He lists his priorities as reducing traffic congestion, funding public schools, and ensuring government accountability through strong public disclosure laws. He is against property tax increases and tolls. Personally, he caught my eye when he said it’s unacceptable that school counselors in Snohomish County are shared between schools, and that special education is insufficiently funded. I’d prefer someone with more legislative experience as well as someone further left.\n\nMark Harmsworth is also against property tax increases and tolls, also wishes to relieve traffic congestion, and also claims to be for increasing funding for education. He claims that such companies as Amazon, Boeing, Monsanto, Kroger, and many more support his candidacy. He co-sponsored: 1) a partisan bill to amend the Constitution to prohibit taxation of individual income 2) a partisan bill to amend the Constitution to require a two-thirds majority vote of the legislature to raise taxes 3) a bill to recognize “the right of Israel to exist as a sovereign state with secure and defensible borders” 4) a partisan bill to eliminate the use of common core state standards and assessments in Washington 5) a bipartisan bill “establishing a priority for the use, reuse, and recycling of construction aggregate and recycled concrete materials 6) a nearly completely partisan bill to “Recognizing the constitutional right to bear arms and revising background check requirements for firearms transfers only between and among persons who are not otherwise disqualified from legally possessing a firearm.” And 7) an act requiring the department of children, youth, and families to provide a written explanation for a determination of unsuitability for unsupervised access to children in care.\n\nKing County Prosecuting Attorney — Daron Morris (NP) and incumbent Dan Sattenberg (NP)\n\nSattenberg has held this position since 2007. He is a co-convener of the Domestic Violence Initiative, which he calls a “multi-disciplinary task force dedicated to improving our region’s response to domestic violence. According to his website, he helped convince WA State legislature to expand second degree assault to include strangulation, which was previously only a misdemeanor. His record shows assertively going after repeat DV offenders and implementing new measures to hold them accountable and prevent future harm. He’s against U.S. Attorney General Sessions’ war on drugs, and against the death penalty. Daron Morris dropped out of the campaign in late September due to health reasons. I would vote for Dan Sattenberg, as he seems well-qualified with good values.\n\nState Supreme Court\n\nPosition 2 — Incumbent Justice Susan Owens\n\nOwens is running unopposed. She’s endorsed by NARAL Pro-Choice Washington and passionate about domestic violence issues. I would vote for Justice Owens.\n\nPosition 8 — Incumbent Justice Steven Gonzalez and Nathan Choi.\n\nJustice Gonzalez is endorsed by NARAL Pro-Choice Washington, Planned Parenthood Votes Northwest & Hawaii, and the Stranger. Nathan Choi was formally reprimanded by the King County Bar Association a year ago for violating its fair campaign practices guidelines. In February of 2018, Attorney General Bob Ferguson filed a lawsuit against him, and the case is still open. I would vote for Justice Gonzalez.\n\nPosition 9 — Incumbent Justice Sheryl Gordon McCloud\n\nMcCloud is running unopposed. She’s passionate about constitutional rights and widely rated by Bar Associations as “Exceptionally Well Qualified.” She’s endorsed by Fuse Washington, The Seattle Times, NARAL Pro-Choice Washington, and many, many more. I would vote for Justice McCloud.\n\nState Ballot Measures\n\nInitiative 940\n\n“Initiative 940 would create a good faith test to determine when the use of deadly force by police is justifiable, require police to receive de-escalation and mental health training, and provide that policy have a duty to render first aid.” It would remove the requirement that prosecutors show that a law enforcement officer acted with malice to be convicted. The committee in support of the initiative is De-Escalate WA I-940. The top contributor to the campaign was the Puyallup Tribal of Indians, which contributed $500,000. The committee in opposition to the measure is Coalition for a Safer WA. The top contributor was the Seattle Police Officer’s Guild, which contributed $90,000 in cash. Other top contributors in support are the ACLU of Washington\n\nThis initiative was initially conducted by signature gathering for over 350,000 signatures, and was sent to the legislature, which approved the initiative mostly among party lines and passed a bill (HB 3003) to immediately amend the initiative. Tim Eyman (a conservative political activist) sued, and a lower court ruled that the initiative had to be kicked back to the ballot process.\n\nWashington is the only state requiring proof of malice for the conviction of an officer who has killed unnecessarily — a nearly impossible standard to meet, De-Escalate claims. “Since 2005, police have killed over 300 Washingtonians, up to a third showing signs of mental illness. Only one officer was charged, and acquitted.”\n\nPolls conducted in 2017 and 2018 found nearly 70% support for the initiative. Six various police orders, councils, guilds, and associations are against the initiative, and place the blame (for what, it’s not exactly clear) on opioid addiction, homelessness, and an underfunded mental health system.\n\nI would vote to support Initiative 940. Its creation seems to have been an extensive process involving many groups, its proposals seem reasonable, and it combines judicial action with the crucial de-escalation and mental health training.\n\nInitiative 1631\n\nThis initiative would enact a carbon emission fee beginning in 2020. It aims to reduce Washington’s greenhouse gases. The fee would be imposed on “large emitters” and would exempt smaller emitters and other special cases. The revenue generated would be set aside for a “clean up pollution fund,” and after covering administrative costs, it would be put to use as follows: 70% to the clean air and clean energy account, 25% to the clean water and healthy forests account, and 5% to the healthy communities account. Supporters of this initiative include Bill Gates, officials like Governor Inslee and Representative Pramila Jayapal, and a lengthy host of businesses (like REI, many renewable energy groups), organizations (like NAACP Spokane, Our Revolution, Fuse Washington, Indivisible, Northwest Energy Coalition), conservation groups, labor organizations, faith groups, healthcare organizations (like NARAL, American Lung Association, Planned Parenthood Votes NW & Hawaii, Toxic-Free Future), and Native tribes and nations. The top donors supporting the initiative are The Nature Conservancy, League of Conservation Voters, Craig McKibben, Sarah Merner, and Chris Stolte.\n\nOpponents include the Western States Petroleum Association and the Association of Washington Business. They claim it will be ineffective, cost Washington billions, and has no real plan. The top donors opposing the initiative are Phillips 66 (an energy company headquartered in Texas), BP, Andeavor, American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, and U.S. Oil and Refining Company.\n\nI would vote to support this initiative. It seems well thought out; it includes common sense measures like regularly required effectiveness reports, board oversight, and cooperation with local tribes for their “free, prior, and informed consent for the project.” If passed, Washington would be the first U.S. state to have a carbon fee, over ten years after British Columbia implemented their carbon tax that inspired preliminary carbon tax initiatives.\n\nInitiative 1634\n\nThis initiative would prohibit local governments (but not state governments) from imposing taxes on groceries. Tim Eyman, the same conservative activist who sued to send I-940 back to the ballot, attempted a similar initiative (1635) that didn’t make it to the ballot, which would have prevented both state and local governments from imposing taxes on groceries. It’s worth noting that Tim Eyman has proposed 20 initiatives, 10 of which were passed by voters, and 6 of which were later found to be unconstitutional.\n\nI would vote against this initiative. While grocery taxes are an undeniable pain and a hindrance to affordability, I believe a ban on such taxes refuses to see any nuance to the issue. And, following the money on this campaign, the initiative is wildly supported by huge lobbyists and the food industry. This leads me to believe that they wish to straightforwardly protect their own interests and profit margins rather than the people of Washington. The Seattle Times also suggests a no vote.\n\nInitiative 1639\n\nThis initiative would raise the minimum age to 21 to purchase semiautomatic assault rifles. It would increase requirements on background checks, waiting periods, and storage of firearms. In support are such organizations as The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, Planned Parenthood Votes Northwest & Hawaii, Vets Place Northwest, and the League of Women Voters of Washington. The Alliance for Gun Responsibility argues “In Washington, it is currently easier to buy an assault weapon than it is to purchase a handgun because assault weapons are treated the same as hunting rifles. This must change.”\n\nThe NRA sued and filed a legal challenge to try to stop this bill, but a higher court overturned a lower court’s ruling to ensure that this initiative remained on the ballot. Alan Gottlieb, chairman of the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms and founder of the Second Amendment Foundation, claims the bill is “discrimination,” “social prejudice,” and “principle sacrificed for political correctness.” The NRA is the top donor in opposition to the initiative. Paul Allen of Microsoft is the top donor in favor of the initiative.\n\nI would vote to support this initiative. These are commonsense gun regulations, nothing overly restrictive whatsoever, in my opinion. It’s alarming to me that some gun owners and big lobbyists like the NRA resist this much to basic background checks, safety measures such as locking up a firearm (to prevent access by children or other people not allowed to access guns), waiting ten days to complete a purchase, and setting the minimum age to 21 to purchase assault rifles.\n\nAdvisory Vote 19\n\nMaintaining this bill would fund oil spill prevention and cleanup. I would vote to maintain this tax increase. It’s a bipartisan bill and the only reason it’s subject to an advisory vote is because Tim Eyman (him again) had an initiative passed that requires one every time a bill passes that closes a tax loophole or raises revenue."
