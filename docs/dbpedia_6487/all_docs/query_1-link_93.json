        "text": "Today’s the day! 5 weeks of hard work is to be presented today.\n\nMet up with my app-solutely amazing group at 7 o’clock – we wanted to run through everything once before our presentation. I was so nervous! I’ve never presented in English before. I had the strangest experience with my ‘script’. I think I was so into making it sound professional – combined with the fact that I had to explain a lot in few minutes – that I ended up writing a full script with text I couldn’t relate to at all. It made it really hard for me to remember. I’ve spoken English so many times before – and even at work (at the International Department) I’ve had to present things, which I’ve been able to do off the top of my head, but this time was different.\n\nI had expected the room to be packed with people – it was not. A few students from some of the Bostonians’ classes, few people from our working life partners (none of the people we’ve been working with), our mentors and the deans from each collaborating school (Metropolia Helsinki, Seton Hall New Jersey, Metropolitan University College Copenhagen & Massachusetts General Hospital Institute of Health Professions Boston).\n\nAt first were the two groups who had been working with the LGBT community. One group had created a kit to help educate health professions on how to engage in the important conversation of gender & sexuality. The other group had created a social website for the elderly LGBT community to meet each other. Both of them were great projects with good outcomes – I really hope they both get implemented.\n\nThen was the first of 3 groups working with the organization w. housing for elderly homeless.\n\nThis group had created an activity kit and assessment tool for the organization to use to assess which needs (in terms of activities) a resident has. The assessment tool was so cool! I really want to see that in use – or see them do research on whether or not it is valid and reliable.\n\nThen it was us.\n\nOur challenge was to create awareness of our organization as well as elderly homeless – if you want a full description (along with images) of our solution please see blog post from Sept. 8th.\n\nOur answer to this challenge consists of:\n\n– A website with two different purposes (explanation follows)\n\n– Start up of collaboration with different Universities in Boston.\n\n– An activity development guide (to my OT friends: basically a framework for creating an activity analysis)\n\n– A contact list to the different schools with description of schools and what they can offer\n\n– A interview/image consent form\n\n– An interview guide for the students to use when interviewing homeless people in the streets.\n\nThe website has two purposes/“parts”.\n\nThe first is our STORY CORNERTM, which is basically a compilation of stories from homeless people in Boston. Only, in order for people to relate to this, the viewer has to click through different demographic aspects which then sends you to a true story of a homeless person with whom you have something in common. Our theory is, that this way you’re relating to the people you read about and this might help the general public to realize that homelessness can happen to anyone and (especially in the US) homelessness is really only one paycheck away.\n\nAfter coming up with this idea we were faced with a hurdle: How are we going to promote awareness of the website?\n\nWe took inspiration in the resources around us: Boston has a very large amount of schools and therefore a huge amount of students. And who’s better at sharing knowledge of something via word of mouth?\n\nIn order for our idea to be sustainable we had to make sure that this was not something a group of students (who change every 3 years) had the responsibility to keep running. These days Service Learning Opportunities are really buzz words in the US (I bet it will be in DK too at some point). Service Learning Opportunity is a teaching method that provides students with an immediate opportunity to apply classroom learning to enhance the work of a local organization.\n\nA good fit? I think so!\n\nNext hurdle: Would we be able to sell this idea to our organization and would the schools in Boston buy in to the idea too?\n\nLauren and Ty did a great job contacting universities and much to our surprise they were very interested in being a part of this project. We ended up with answers ranging from “nope – not at all” to “yes!”, “I’m intrigued – let me hear more!” and all the way to “come and present this at our school!”. We were thrilled to have come up with a connection that’s actually wanted and feasible.\n\nWe wanted to make sure that our organization has an overview of what activities are executed in their name so we came up with the activity development guide with a step-by-step plan the students can use when planning their event and all events must be submitted to our organization.\n\nSo part 2 of our website contains all of the above (that is not the STORY CORNERTM)\n\nWe (Ty) then thought: hey, our organization doesn’t have a lot of hands/time/money – let’s make it faster and easier for them to get in touch with different universities when the organization has a project. He then researched a ton of schools, and created a table with the schools names and the types of services they can provide + contact information and an explanation of the different categories.\n\nThe presentation went really well! I didn’t mess up at all! Hehe. #AchievementUnlocked! We all did great. Pam, our mentor, had done an amazing job prepping us for questions so we answered most of the questions of sustainability, implementation etc. during the presentation.\n\nTheme song of presentation: I need a dollar, Aloe Blacc\n\nWe were asked if we’d thought of how to use this knowledge in our home countries. Interestingly enough, this summer, the group of graduates from our school receiving the “Bachelor Price” from our OT Union was a group who worked with homelessness. It would be fun to get in contact with them and see if we could share knowledge/combine forces and help homeless people in DK.\n\nLastly, group “Spark” had created a video for our organization to show to new residents – a welcome video if you will. There have been issues with residents not being able to adjust to finally having a home. They created a really sweet video with some great interviews – a concept I’m sure the organization will use in the future.\n\nlink to recorded presentations. — I have not yet received this but I’ll post it as soon as I get it.\n\nAfter our presentations we had pictures taken!\n\nI had the weirdest anti-climatic feeling, not knowing wether to laugh or cry. Ty was spot on as he put a hand on my shoulder and said: “This isn’t the end, Maj – it’s the beginning”. Of course he’s right. I’m excited to see where this project can go in the future and even more excited to have been in a group with people with whom I see a lot of future international and inter-professional projects.\n\nI think that’s one of the most important things I’ll take with me from this adventure.\n\nAfterwards we went home, changed clothes (into something a little more comfortable) and went to have lunch at Papagãyo’s.\n\nThen it hit me – It’s been 13 years since 9/11 and there I was, at a restaurant/bar, having lunch and celebrating our project and new relationships. Above the bar was 3 TV screens; one showed baseball, one showed the news and the one to the right showed a documentary about that horrifying day. A couple of flags were flying half-mast but in general the world has – in lack of better terms – moved on. Of course we think about it and obviously situations like that changes the world we live in, but I find it remarkable that it only takes us a decade to move on.\n\nI know a lot of you will think about: what about XX situation; thinking of things I don’t even know about, episodes in our history that I’m either too young to remember or don’t know of due to lack of media coverage, however to me it’s an important moment in my life — realizing that I too am oblivious to what has happened before ‘me’, I am but a speck in history and I can only take from this what my parents have tried to do throughout the past 24 years of my life: share history and knowledge to those younger than me in order for us all to remember and thereby make sure not to repeat history.\n\nOnly once before have I had a similar – but a hell of a lot more fun – experience:\n\nI used to work at a daycare/after school program, with kids 3-9 years old. This little boy is walking around, wearing a print t-shirt with the image of a tape and a walkman. I asked him if he knew what was on his shirt, to which he responded:\n\n“Silly Maj, there’s nothing on my t-shirt. It is just doodles”. It is possible I felt a tad old that day.\n\nAfterwards Sof, Stine, Sofie, Mariia & Sanna walked to North End to buy Boston t-shirts.\n\nSof, Stine and I went to get Ice cream and sat down by a fountain on the Freedom Trail. It was really lovely sitting there, talking to- and enjoying each other. Living three people in an apartment meant for 2 has had its up’s and downs – not to mention the fact that we’ve been together 24/7 for 6 weeks. But walking together now, talking, laughing, talking about our future travel plans etc. was a really nice ending to this experience – and truly: there are no other girls I would rather have been on this adventure with. Sofie – you know it! Stine – I really hope you know it! You’re lovely in every way! (Except when you fart like a crane.. although.. I kinda enjoy that too)\n\nAfterwards, we walked to the Victor where we engaged in – what would turn out to be – a ‘deadly’ game of Civil War. Never ever have I been that drunk and still standing up. We ended up at a bar – can’t remember which – and boy should I’ve gone home instead. Aaaaaanyway. We had fun though!\n\nSoundtrack of IIP Boston 2014:\n\n– Magic!: “Rude”\n\n– Meghan Trainor: “All about that bass”\n\n– Jason Derulo ft. Snoop dogg: “Wiggle”\n\n– Anna Kendrick: “Cups”\n\nToday is the beginning of our last week in Boston.\n\nIt mainly consisted of getting our presentation finished and ready to show Pam, our mentor, tomorrow morning. She’s been really great along the way to challenge our ideas and reasons to make different decisions. I’m excited to show her what we’ve come up with by now. As Ty said today, I too hope she’ll ‘rip it apart’ so we’ll be prepared for the questions after our formal presentation.\n\nI had to finish the website I’ve been building and Ty had some last-minute troubles with a computer that is acting up. Lauren has been busy contacting Colleges & Universities that could be interested in being part of our project.\n\nSalla & Christina have put the final touches on our ‘Activity Development Guide’, the image consent form and our interview guide. Hameed has been busy writing the beginning of our presentation. I know this may not make sense as I have yet to explain what we ended up with for our solution to our organization’s challenge. Perhaps now is a good time to explain.\n\nOur organization (one of several organizations in Boston working with housing for elderly homeless) has, along the way, expressed different challenges; one of which is generating funds. What we also heard is that this organization is very well known within the homeless community but not so much with the general public. This means, that when other ‘housing for elderly homeless’-organizations in Boston receive grants etc. our organization is overlooked. Therefore: we decided following challenge for our project:\n\nThe challenge ended up being a threefold ‘circle’ of equal parts: Awareness of Elderly Homeless, Change Perception of Homelessness within the general public and Create Awareness of our Organization. We figure ‘funding’ will come as a probable ‘bi-product’ of our awareness project however it is not part of our immediate challenge.\n\nOur first idea (as far as I remember I’ve explained this earlier in this blog, however alcohol and time has happened so I’ll quickly go through it again) was an app with 2 sections: “Need help” and “Want to help”. “Need help” was meant for homeless people – filled with information of shelters, housing options, food banks, weather alerts etc. The “Want to help” part was for the general public. This section would contain stories of homeless people in Boston as well as a donate button, a way to sign up for volunteer services etc. This app would be installed on a tablet or iPad which would then be placed at a ‘kiosk’ at the train stations.\n\nI really thought it was a F****** good idea! However, our organization did not.\n\nA couple of weeks worth of brainstorming later and we ended up with our final idea.\n\nWe decided to use the “want to help” section of our original idea.\n\nThis section proposes to improve\n\n– Awareness\n\n– Perception of Elderly Homeless and\n\n– Potentially generate funding for our organization.\n\nThat idea turned into a website – Untold Stories Of Boston™ – with the purpose of creating awareness for our organization AND Elderly Homeless.\n\nThe website has 2 sections:\n\n1. Story Corner™:\n\nStory Corner™ is designed to humanize homeless individuals by linking the viewer to a specific true story of a homeless person who shares the viewer’s demographics.\n\nFor instance, say you’re between 50-59 years old\n\nand you happen to be in marketing – or perhaps these demographics aren’t actually yours but the ones of your father, mother, sibling or another loved one.\n\nYou’re then sent to a true story of a homeless person in Boston with whom you actually have a lot in common – even some of the things that define most people in the western world and culture – and you get to read about the unfortunate events that placed him or her in the streets.\n\nThat story is actually one of the stories we gathered as we went out and interviewed homeless people in the streets. And I will think of this specific person (whose name is not actually Ben) every time I see a full moon.\n\nAfter we came up with the website we had to figure out how to keep it sustainable and how to promote it.\n\nWe decided to take advantage of the resources around us.\n\nThe large amount of schools in Boston inspired us to recruit students.\n\nWe decided we would turn our project into a Service Learning Opportunity (which is a learning method that offers students immediate opportunities to apply classroom learning to support the work of local organizations).\n\nThe students can plan and execute different types of events. One example is students expressing homeless peoples’ stories through pictures – which can then become a part of our website.\n\nOther examples include sport events, volunteer services, engaging other schools etc.\n\nThe events will be college-specific as we encourage student to be creative and using their skills while advocating for our organization and elderly homeless.\n\nUnder ‘Service Learning Opportunities’ you have 3 options.\n\n1. You can choose to generate stories for the Story Corner™\n\nYou’ll then be able to download our interview guide and our image/interview consent form.\n\nyou can click our activites/events button – you’ll then be able to find a list of the different purposes your event can have.\n\nThe Activity Development Guide provides expectations and purpose of the activity – as well as a step-by-step guideline to follow when forming and executing the event.\n\nYou’re also able to see a list of previous events to provide inspiration for your activity.\n\nAt last you’ll find a list of our collaborating schools. (The images below are of the schools we contacted and who showed interest in our project. However, this is just an example and not necessarily an exact image of the schools participating in the project)\n\n3. Lastly, you’ll be able to contact the organization to gather more information about additional needs they may have.\n\nI hope that gave you a more clear idea of our project.\n\nAfter school Sofie and I went to pilates at Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway in North End with Ali – she’s apparently quite the pilates-guru. She’s a great instructor, filled with energy! Once again she ruined our bodies, made me feel muscles I’m pretty sure I’m not supposed to be feeling. It was great!\n\nWe walked to the Tavern to meet up with Morten and Colleen. This is probably our last chance to see Colleen so even though we were wearing work out clothes and were pretty tired we wanted to hang out and have a bit of food. Eric stopped by as we were about to leave so we only just got to say hi to him.\n\nWe ended up being quite a few people there; Colleen, Morten, Sofie Stub, Sofie Lund, Sanna, Eric, and some friends of Colleen – along with a couple of the other girls who were in the same program last year (with Eric and Colleen).\n\nIt turned out Lauren and Karen had been there the entire time too but they had been sitting in the other end of the bar, watching a football game.\n\nSof and I walked home and we ended up falling asleep with our clothes on watching Grey’s Anatomy.\n\nWith a massive hangover, Sofie and I wandered from Charlestown to Cambridge. We’ve been talking about seeing MIT & Harvard since before leaving DK and we decided today was the day. Today, with the worst hangover in weeks, in 34°C.. G.R.E.A.T. idea!\n\nWe took advantage of a potentially horrible situation, took our shirts off and did a walk/tan session along the riverside.\n\nWe saw Harvard-people on their boats (ya, sorry I’m not familiar with the proper terms). It was pretty cool! A beautiful view too.\n\nWe got to MIT – “stille og roligt universitet” – their ‘main’ campus. We walked out into the Killian Court, enjoyed the sun and ate lunch.\n\nAfter having spent a little time walking the halls of MIT, peeking in on one of their dance classes, we walked towards our next stop – Harvard.\n\nWalking around the site of this university is a great experience. I advise everyone (who’s interested in feeling inspired and motivated) to go for a walk behind the Harvard walls. We were never inside so I can’t say anything about that but walking through that gate (see pic above) gave me goosebumps. You can almost feel your knowledge expand as you’re walking around, looking at students reading, buying books, throwing ‘yard sales’ and showing tourists around.\n\nIt was such a surreal experience looking at these students – most of them even younger than me – living their lives at (friggin’) Harvard! I couldn’t help but think:\n\n“These intelligent people will be running the world some day”. I really hope they realize their future opportunities when attending such a prestigious school.\n\nIt might just be nostalgic me realizing I really wish I’d been more enthusiastic about school. School was never really difficult for me (except calculus – F that!) but I’m beginning to realize what opportunities I’ve missed due to laziness or lack of motivation.\n\nOne of the girls (Carmen) I met here in Boston (she’s a friend of New Jersey girl, Steph Durakis) is a teacher. She often posts pictures of the things she does for her students – how she uses her motivation and creativity to make her students’ school days a lot more interesting. I have had mostly good teachers throughout my 17 years of school however I’ve also come across some with poor teaching skills. Whether it was lack of motivation, the habit of ‘just doing what we’re used to’ or forgetting the need for diverse teaching methods in order to reach all students, I’ll never know. All I know is, that the best teachers I’ve had were people who not only knew what they were trying to teach but also people who understood what my mentor here in Boston, Pam, so brilliantly phrased “you don’t become a good mentor overnight”.\n\nLuckily, the past 3 years I’ve had the pleasure of being educated by some very fine professors etc. I’ve also been so fortunate to meet and have some great and intelligent people around me on a daily basis; colleagues, co-students, friends and family. People, who have inspired me to network, read, seek information, reflect and analyze the world and people around me. I know that may seem/sound sappy (at least to my Danish readers) but am I wrong? 🙂\n\nHeard at Harvard: “This is where all the intelligent people are… So many Asian people..\n\nAfter our inspiring walk around Harvard yard, we went to find FroYo. I bought a book called Outliers. Hameed from my group is reading it right now and told me thought I’d like it. It is by Malcolm Gladwell and is about how talent may be overrated – or misunderstood – how where we grow up has a huge effect on the opportunities we’re given in life and our ability to take advantage of them. I’m looking forward to read it in the sun in SoCal next week.\n\nWe found a Pinkberry (frozen yogurt) at Harvard Square which we enjoyed while listening to a peculiar street musician who was very into spreading his love for reggae music.\n\nAs our hangover had yet to pass, our feet were sore and the weather was still hot and humid, we decided to rent bikes and bike home to Charlestown.\n\nThe Hubway system is really neat – I saw it in action for the first time earlier this year in Paris. You buy a pass and you can then pick up a bike at any ‘bike station’, ride the bike for 30 min for free and then leave it at another ‘station’. After seeing them in Paris they’ve either spread quickly or I’ve just only now started to notice them in the different cities I’ve been in. We have them in Copenhagen now (although I feel they’re a little irrelevant as almost everyone in Denmark have bikes – I guess they’re nice for tourists, though) and they were also in Manhattan, NYC. It’s a really nice system and it’s pretty cheap. We rode our bikes back to Charlestown – oh boy I miss my bike!!!\n\nAs we got ready for our roof top dinner date it started to rain. A lot! Thunder and lightening included.\n\nDan, the guy whose apartment we’re renting, is home this weekend, staying upstairs in the other part of the house.\n\nHe invited us up for a rooftop BBQ along with Eric, my student-mentor, and some of their friends. Fortunately, the thunderstorm passed Charlestown as we got ready for dinner.\n\nDan had bought sirloin, vegetables and beer – best dinner yet!\n\nIt was a very “hyggelig” evening, and as it got darker we were lucky to be able to set on the roof top terasse, watching the dark sky over Downtown Boston being lit up by lightening. It was incredibly beautiful.\n\nAfter delicious food and good beer (did I mention Dan brews his own beer? We didn’t get to taste those but obviously he’d bought some fine beer for us – just the way we Danes like it!) we had to go to bed early. Once again I don’t get to sleep in on a Sunday. What does a girl have to do to sleep in on a friggin Sunday around here?! I thought you people were supposed to be Christian?!\n\nWe have to get up early to go to Peabody for the 5K Grafitti Run! It’s is the same concept as Colorrun – you run and get dyed corn starch thrown at you, resulting in colorful, dirty, sweaty people with happy smiles on their faces. I can’t wait!\n\nBack at school after a great weekend – surprisingly well rested!\n\nWe did a risk analysis today. It’s basically an analysis of the risks and road bumps we might come across in our project. It was actually really nice to do because unlike what it might seem like, a risk analysis actually also give you an image of whether or not the perceived risks are likely to become an actual problem.\n\nThe main risks of our project (at least as we figured today) were if we weren’t going to be able to get testimonials from homeless people or pictures to our website.\n\nWe had two visitors at school; Eric (my mentor) and John – both former IIP students.\n\nThey talked about what impact this project has had on their working life after graduating and how they’ve used the skills learnt during this project.\n\n(sidenote: Found out today that it’s normal for people to one full time job + 1 part time job after finishing school – just in order to be able to pay off student loans. Every time I hear something like that it makes me feel incredibly idiotic to be bitching over lack of money in my everyday life. I get paid to take a free education for crying out loud. One thing I will definitely take home from this international experience, is something I wish I had learned a long time ago: The sense that school is not just school but a full time, paying job/internship and it is my responsibility to gain as much knowledge as possible while I have this job.)\n\nWe had a site meeting with the Associate Director of Volunteers & Communication in the organization we’re working with so I went home to change clothes (from pretty dress to business casual skirt + shirt). I haven’t looked this good/professional so many days in a row (what happened to my usual sports clothes and sneakers?!). The girly-girl inside me kinda wishes it could be like this back home too. The lazy like-to-sleep-in part of me is thankful I can just roll out of bed at home, jump on my bike and not really care about looking presentable.\n\nMet up with Sala & Hameed at North Station and we went to our meeting. We got some good ideas and information to use in our project – so nice to feel like we’re going the right way!\n\nI got back to North Station and decided I didn’t want to just go home so I went to my favorite café, Equal Exchange Café, for a cup of coffee and a chance to catch up on my blog.\n\nThis turned out to be quite a beneficial choice for me.\n\nI ended up talking to the woman sitting next to me, Ryn. Ryn was a Rotary member and was – right before we started talking – e-mailing a young guy who is in Boston during his gap-year. This young guy is named Simon and guess where he’s from?! Yup, Denmark! This opened up a really long, good conversation! Turns out, Ryn’s very interested in both Innovation and OT (she’s been working with innovation projects at different hospitals in MA) and her daughter went to school in LA, majoring in Occupational Science + 2 other majors (I forgot the exact name of them and to make sure i don’t mess up I will leave out their titles). 3 majors – not very common – but they all made perfect sense from an OT point of view.\n\nRyn is an absolutely lovely woman, who was more than happy to give me the e-mail addresses of several people within my field of studies and interests.\n\nOne was her own daughter who still lives in L.A. and whom I might be able to grab a cup of coffee with while I’m in SoCal the last 2 weeks of Sept.\n\nAnother was an OT (her old neighbor), who has gone on to a 2nd career in mediation -from what Ryn told me, it really made sense to combine those two educations/careers and it would be really interesting to hear more about it.\n\nWe got evacuated from the Café due to an overheated A/C that had started blowing out smoke in the office spaces upstairs (you know it is hot & humid when the A/C overheats).\n\nI went home, in a really good mood – so happy to have experienced the American networking culture. Something I also hope to bring back from this trip. Actually, inspired by my brother Lasse, I have tried to network a lot during my time at Metropolitan University College (OT-school) but it is really different in the US. Last year, as I was visiting Lauren, her mom put me in contact with a (OT-)friend of hers with whom I would be able to do an internship.\n\nI really like the idea of sharing knowledge – especially across countries.\n\nI hope to get in/keep contact with some of these people and widen my horizon and knowledge within the scientific milieu.\n\nI am currently sitting in the bedroom, finishing the blog posts from our NYC-trip, while Sofie and Stine are watching Grey’s in the living room. I like my life.\n\nWe woke up really early (with a Jalapeño-induced hangover!) to go to TKTS at Times Square.\n\nTKTS is a ticket booth in NYC that sells Broadway and Off-Broadway shows, music and dance events at discounts of 20-50% off the face value. We really wanted to go see the Lion King but unfortunately that wasn’t discounted – still too popular, I think.\n\nWe got there at 9.30am – we had been told to be there at that time because it would open at 10am and people start lining up early. As it turned out, the booth doesn’t open until 11am on Sundays so we got there really early! It was pretty good as it resulted in us being almost the first people in line for tickets. By the time it was 10.30 the place was packed and it would’ve been absolute hell trying to get tickets.\n\nSofie stood in line while I went to Dunkin’ Donuts to get breakfast (yeah yeah, we went there again!)\n\nWe ended up getting tickets for Chicago – the longest running show to have premiered on Broadway.\n\nAfter we got our tickets I had made plans for us to go have lunch with my friend Suzanna. Suzanna is the daughter of my mom’s friend, Lisa, from when my mother was an exchange student in Connecticut in ’74/’75. I first met Lisa, her husband Jim, and her 3 children: Suzanna, Josiah and Mark in ’05 during my very first trip to the US. I stayed with them for a week again in ’09 on my way to hang out with my friend, Alexandra, in California. It was really great to see Suz again! unfortunately Jo & Mark weren’t close to NYC so I’ll have to see them next time.\n\nI find it funny that I have known these people for 9 years, hung out with them on no more than 3 separate occasions and yet I would call them my friends.\n\nBefore meeting up with Suzanna, Sofie and I called to ask our Hostel (International Student Residence) in East Harlem (Manhattan) if we could check in early or at least just stop by and leave our luggage so we didn’t have to drag it along to the theater etc.\n\nThis was where our luck ran out!\n\nWhen we called we were told that our reservation had been transferred to ISR’s collaborative hostel, WestWay, in FU****G Queens!\n\nWe were pretty upset that we hadn’t heard anything about this (not even an e-mail!) and so we tried telling them how this would mess up our entire schedule of the day. It would take us at least an hour each way w.public transportation to get there and leave our luggage.\n\nAfter a looooong and uncomfortable discussion on the phone with a dude, who apparently didn’t know the meaning of the word ‘enunciation’, I talked them into paying for a cab-ride to the hostel. We would have to pay for a cab ride back to Manhattan ourselves (spending an hour on public transportation was not an option because of our newly bought tickets to see Chicago at 3pm).\n\nBy the time I was done talking to the guy (after waiting half an hour for him to call back – ended up having to call him back to which he said: oh ya.. I forgot to write down your phone number..) we didn’t have time to go before the show so we decided to just go enjoy Chicago and deal with this issue later.\n\nAfter lunch, Suzanna walked with us to the theater, wee took some pictures and said goodbye.\n\nThe show was very entertaining!\n\nI had watched the Danish production and the American screen version. Sofie hadn’t seen any of it and I thought it would be a very appropriate show to see as our first Broadway experience. It was very entertaining. The woman playing Roxie Hart is originally from Mexico and I found it really funny how they’d used her characteristics, and what I can only imagine as her actual personality, in her role. She was hilarious!\n\nthe woman they had playing Velma Kelly was a little stiff for my taste but she was a good singer.\n\nAfter the show we had approximately 3 hours until we had tickets for a StandUp Comedy Show with New York Comedy Club in midtown.\n\nWe decided to just hurry and take a cab to Queens, leave our luggage and take a quick shower (you wouldn’t believe how hot and humid it had been all day! – It had actually rained quite a bit while we were watching Chicago but it was still humid when we got outside. I feel like saying: you know pollution and weather is bad when it doesn’t ‘freshen up’ after raining).\n\nIn the cab we found a person on Airbnb who were willing to have us stay with her so we decided to just cancel our booking at ISR when we got there (completely unnecessary trip to Queens. Oh well.) – We ended up scaring her off because of some troubles with payment, lack of time and our general level of stress.\n\nWhen we got to WestWay there was of course a line of people at the desk and only one person at work. When he asked us if we were checking in I tried to explain the situation (and no, I was not at all as diplomatic as I should’ve been but I was angry, frustrated and pretty f*ing hungry!) to which he (Miguel) responded with:\n\n“I don’t know anything about this – I just clocked in”\n\nMaj: “Well, could you call and ask the guy who was at work before you?”\n\nMiguel: “No” (NO JOKE!)\n\nMaj: “I would like to speak to your manager then”\n\nMiguel: “Yeah, that’s not going to happen. I just clocked in – I don’t have their phone number”\n\nMaj: “You must have their phone number somewhere? It is your manager.. You don’t have to give me the phone number you can just call him and let me talk to him?”\n\nMiguel: “No, that’s not going to happen”\n\nMaj: “Okaaay… well, then I’ll have to call the police”\n\nMiguel (laughing): “Okay.. yeah, you do that”\n\nMaj: “Okay, well can I borrow the hostel’s phone?”\n\nMiguel (pointing at Sofie’s phone which was out of battery): “No, you can use that one”\n\nMaj: “I can’t – it doesn’t have battery”\n\nMiguel (pointing at another customer on the phone with someone): “I can’t use my phone – it is currently being used by another customer”\n\nMaj: “But I can use it when she’s done?”\n\nMiguel: “Yeah, I’ll call my colleague when she’s done”\n\nWHAT.THE.ACTUAL.FUCK.IS.YOUR.PROBLEM?!?!?!?!\n\nHe ended up calling his colleague who confirmed what I had said and we got the money for our cab ride to the Hostel. Miguel told us that we had to send an e-mail to ISR in order to cancel the booking – he couldn’t do it because the booking wasn’t made with them. I sent an e-mail right after talking to him (as I am writing this it is Tuesday Sept. 2nd and I have still heard nothing from them – nor have they charged us for the room so it might all be good).\n\nwe took a cab back to Mahattan as we were now running late for the Comedy show (at least if we wanted to get dinner before). We got out and ran to a diner 30 min before we had to be at the Comedy Show.\n\nThe food was actually really good but we had to stuff our faces due to lack of time! SO UNCOMFORTABLE! We had some good laughs and cracked some jokes about us eating in warp speed at a restaurant where life could not possibly be more chill and slow.\n\nWe then ran to the Comedy Show!\n\nA lot of really great comedians – SO many good jokes!! I laughed so hard! It was a long show with, I think, 8-10 comedians. As Sofie was (literally) falling asleep during the last few comedians we decided to pack our stuff and head towards New Jersey and our Knight In Shining Armor: Jas! We’d texted her, asking if we could come sleep at her place – to which she said “Of course!”.\n\nThe train ride to NJ wasn’t that long (actually I don’t know as I fell asleep the minute I sat down) and Jas was so sweet to come pick us up at the station around 11pm.\n\nWe got to her house, said hi to her mom, went to Jas’ room, inflated the air mattress, we noted that this was a ‘hyggelig’ slumber party and then fell asleep!\n\nA really good day turned hectic ended up perfectly well!\n\nWe woke up early, showered and got ready to take on the Big Apple. Of course when I say ready I mean doing our hair, full war paint and our best outfits – after all it is the hometown of Sex and the city & Gossip Girl.\n\nWe walked to Pick A Bagel, bought bagels, coffee and a blueberry muffin to share. We walked down to the Hudson River, sat on a bench and enjoyed our breakfast while people watching. So many people were out early, running, walking with strollers, talking and enjoying the sun. NYC is a pretty busy city – even though we’d been told many people leave town on weekends and Labor Day the riverside was full of people from early in the morning. Of course a lot of these people were tourists like ourselves.\n\nWe walked along the Hudson to the bottom of Manhattan from where we took the ferry boat to Staten Island, passed right by the Statue of Liberty. You get pretty close – close enough to see her and get an idea of how tall she is. The ferry ride was really nice. We hadn’t been in NYC for long before the dense pollution got to me so it was really nice getting out on the water. It hit me that we’ve been on the water quite a few times within the past couple of weeks; kayaking, whale watching, duck tour and now on our way to Staten Island.\n\nHeard at the Staten Island ferry:\n\n(With a slight fear of getting seasick in her voice)\n\n“I think we’ve been sailing a quite a bit on this trip… Oh. Now we’re sailing. ….again.”\n\nWe got to Staten Island and had to use the restroom before catching the next ferry back. In the line to the women’s restroom this tiny, short cleaning lady walks by Sofie, looks up and says: “wow! Big!” Wtf?! I mean, yes Sofie’s tall but how is that less of an insult than walking up to a person and bursting out: “wow! Asian!” Or white, redheaded, fat or anything like that?! None of them a choice and all pretty out of people’s hands to do anything about – the human kind is weird with diversity. We say it is good (which, from a biological point of view is true, I guess) yet we have such a hard time appreciating it?\n\nWe’ve been told that guided tour busses are a good way to get a sense of the city you’re staying in. None of us have tried a tour bus and we’d decided to spend money on sightseeing and food during these days in New York so after we got back from Staten Island, we decided to go on a hop on/hop off tour bus.\n\nIt went up the east side of Manhattan, through Battery Park City, Tribeca, Hudson Square, Greenwich Village and Chelsea. We got off close to the Empire State Building, walked down 34th and went right past Macy’s. We’d decided on not shopping in New York (mostly because it is a lot more expensive than Boston) but I had to go in – Chanel was calling. I ended up buying the prettiest nail polish, Blue Satin (one of my friends back home has it – I forget who – and it is absolutely stunning! Weee! No more shopping, I promise!)\n\nWe walked by Empire State Building to see how much it was to go up – the choice was between Empire State or the Rockefeller. I guess there are different opinions about this but from what we’d heard top of the rock is cheaper and has a better view. Anyhow, we still wanted to see the Empire State building.\n\nThere was construction by their main entrance (as with so many other place in Manhattan) so the marquise I remember from my ’05 trip wasn’t there anymore.\n\nWe saw, we adored and then we went across the street and had $1 pizza – yes, I know I just told you we wanted to spend money on good food but this was (believe it or not) on our bucket list — and it was actually really good!!\n\nWe walked up to Times Square and was bedazzled by the people, the lights, the adds, the crowd and the fact that in that moment, we were standing in the middle of Times Square!\n\nWe walked to the box office of the theatre currently staging the Lion King to see how much tickets are. They were way too expensive so we decided to go to TKTS tomorrow and hope for cheap tickets.\n\nWe walked further up Broadway and was stopped by a street vendor-guy who tried to sell tickets for a StandUp Comedy-show – in which he succeeded. He also told us about some places to go get dinner and drinks (something we’ve been talking about non-stop for the past week!) – and also about our next stop: w 55th street to see a How I Met Your Mother-themed bar called McGees.\n\nHeard in New York:\n\n“Where do pretty people drink cocktails?! That’s where we’re going!”\n\nWe walked up to Central Park (now would’ve been a good time to hop back on one of those tour busses but we forgot so we actually only got to ride the tour bus once. Oh wel.. At least we did it).\n\nWe continued out of the park, to Madison Avenue.\n\nHeard in Upper East Side, between 5th & Madison Ave:\n\n“….I think this is an expensive street”\n\nWe got to The New York Palace – the place where the Van der Woodsen family (Gossip Girl) is supposed to live. An absolutely stunning place!\n\nWe then walked to Rockefeller Center, bought tickets for the next available ‘trip’ up to The Top of The Rock.\n\nWe had about 40 minutes so we decided to have dinner at TriTip (a burger place in the ‘basement’ of Rockefeller Center.\n\nAfter having enjoyed the view from the top of Rockefeller Center, Sofie and I were desperate to have our first Cosmo in NYC!\n\nThe first bar we ran into was an Irish Pub (yes, we are aware that this may not be the ideal choice but desperate times call for desperate measures!). We ordered Cosmo’s (FINALLY!!) and decided to play a game of 500 (card game) – I think it’s fair to say that Sofie won…\n\nWe wanted a real bar so we Yelp’ed roof top bars and found one close to us; 39 Pod.\n\nWe walked towards roof top bar, drinks and fun! On the way we passed the Chrysler Building and Grand Central Station. Sofie was eager to see the spot where Serena (Gossip Girl) was first spotted in the beginning of the show, so we walked inside Grand Central.\n\nIt really makes sense that they’ve named it ‘Grand’ Central – it is huge and unbelievably spectacular – such a pretty place!\n\nWe spent half an hour walking around, taking picture, making snapchat videos of Sofie Lund spotted at Grand Central! It was so much fun! Pretty sure people around us thought we were on drugs.\n\nWe arrived at 39 Pod but was told that the roof top bar had reached capacity.\n\nWe put down our number and decided to have a few drinks at Salvation Taco while waiting. We had the strangest drinks there! We had Chilean Sangria and some other really strong drink with jalapeño-induced rum and caramelized ginger. The first drink was good (and strong) the last one made my mouth and throat burn — probably killing more than one brain cell on its way.\n\nHeard at Salvation Taco:\n\n“Oy! We have NOT had enough cake!”\n\nWe were waiting for quite a while and just as we had decided to go home they called us, telling us we could go up to the roof top bar.\n\nIt was beautiful! Great view over the city – all in all a pretty idyllic scene.\n\nWe ended up talking to a guy (don’t remember his name – oops) and a girl, April. (Yeees – we did have a laugh about how we were Maj & April..) They were really nice people! As soon as April heard we were staying in East Harlem the next night she gave us her phone number – just in case.\n\nWe went home and passed out on the unbelievably comfortable air mattress. Gosh, I really love NYC!"
