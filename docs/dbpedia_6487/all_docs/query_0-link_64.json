        "text": "by Tyler Evilsizer | 2009-05-13\n\nOverview\n\nOn January 29, 2009, Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire and legislative leaders announced a package of climate-change legislation that would \"create jobs, expand [Washington's] green economy, and make important progress toward energy independence.\" These bills would have invested almost $500 million in green transportation and building projects, energy efficiency, and clean-energy technology. The package also included a cap-and-trade bill for carbon emissions as part of the Western Climate Initiative.\n\nIn the final days of its session, debate in the Washington state legislature focused on solving a $9 billion budget shortfall. Few other bills were discussed. However, in a news conference the day after the legislature adjourned on April 26, Gov. Gregoire left open the possibility to call a special session to deal with several bills left languishing when time ran out, including those from her climate-change package.\n\nThe National Institute on Money in State Politics analyzed 2008 campaign contributions from members of industry groups that oppose legislation to address climate change. These groups include the Alliance for Energy and Economic Growth (AEEG), the Consumer Energy Alliance (CEA), certain members of the American Council for Capital Formation (ACCF), and the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM).\n\nIdentified donors within the industry groups contributed $1.5 million to state-level candidates an political parties during Washington's 2008 election\n\nKey findings from this study show:\n\nIdentified donors within the industry groups contributed $1.5 million to state-level candidates and political parties during Washington's 2008 election. On the other side of the issue, environmental groups gave only $36,950.\n\nOne-third of the industry contributions came from the energy sector, which distributed half a million dollars among Washington candidates. The agriculture industry — almost exclusively timber companies — came in a close second with $489,615.\n\nIndustry groups targeted their giving to candidates who went on to serve in the Washington State Legislature. 94 percent of the money given to all legislative candidates went to winners, and senators not up for election\n\nLegislative leaders received 38 percent more from these industry groups than those not in a leadership position\n\nIndustry groups spread out their contributions among the legislators. All but two elected representatives received contributions from an industry group, as did every senator who was up for election in 2008.\n\nIndustry groups also gave more heavily to legislative leaders. The average legislative leader received 38 percent more than non-leaders.\n\nCampaign contributions correlated with votes on the cap-and-trade bill. The \"no\" voters had received an average of $13,556 in industry contributions; the yes voters had received only one-third of that ($4,323).\n\nMethodology\n\nThe National Institute on Money in State Politics analyzed the 2008 contributions made to Washington state-level candidates and party committees. The Institute searched for more than 3,000 members of prominent industry organizations that have spoken against carbon control, such as the American Coalition for Capital Formation, National Association of Manufacturers, Alliance for Energy and Economic Growth, and the Consumer Energy Alliance. The Institute only examined contributions from companies and their political action committees, not individuals who worked for those companies. The Institute also searched for and identified pro-environment and alternative energy contributions.\n\nWho Gave?\n\nMembers of groups that oppose climate-change legislation at the national level, such as the National Association of Manufacturers, gave $1.5 million in Washington during the 2008 election cycle, when every statewide office and 124 of 147 were up for election. These industry groups gave 2 percent of the $71 million total that was given to candidates and political parties in the state.\n\nOne-third of that industry money came from donors within the energy sector, who distributed half a million dollars among Washington candidates. Within that energy sector, electric utilities gave $288,600 and oil & gas companies gave $138,175. The agriculture industry -- almost exclusively timber companies -- came in second with $489,615.\n\nTABLE 1: Industry Group Contributions by Economic Sector, 2008 ECONOMIC SECTOR TOTAL Energy & Natural Resources $499,855 Agriculture $489,615 Construction $172,330 Transportation $124,400 Finance, Insurance & Real Estate $119,104 Other Interests $127,182 TOTAL $1,532,486\n\nMost of the industry money was given by a few major donors. The top 10 donors were responsible for 58 percent of the total. Weyerhaeuser, a timberland and wood products company, gave the most, at $151,504. Three-quarters of the company's money went to legislative candidates, and 61 percent of it went to Republicans. Two other timber companies, Port Blakely Companies and Simpson Investment Company, also made the top contributors list, giving $63,800 and $52,000 respectively. Electric utilities Puget Sound Energy and Avista Corp. also ranked in the top four. Although energy companies gave the largest portion of contributions, only two energy companies made the top 10 list. Many energy companies made the top 20 list, however, including oil giants Chevron, BP America, Tesoro, and ConocoPhillips. See Appendix A for a complete list of companies and how much they gave.\n\nTABLE 2: Top Industry Contributors ORGANIZATION TOTAL Weyerhaeuser Co. $151,504 Puget Sound Energy $125,750 Boeing Co. $108,700 Avista Corp. $97,700 Associated General Contractors Of Washington $78,850 Farmers Insurance Group $76,200 Associated Builders & Contractors $69,300 Washington Forest Protection Association $65,974 Port Blakely Companies $63,800 Simpson Investment Co. $52,000 TOTAL $888,678\n\nEnvironmental Contributions\n\nOn the other side of the issue, identified pro-environment organizations gave candidates and party committees only $36,950. Washington Conservation Voters and its affiliates gave $36,250; Sierra Club chapters contributed $700.\n\nWho Got the Money?\n\nDespite the fact that the governor's race attracted more money than all legislative races combined, two-thirds of the $1.5 million given by industry groups in Washington went to legislative candidates. In contrast, only $92,922 went to the gubernatorial race. More than $225,000 was given to party committees.\n\nContributions also were targeted toward successful campaigns. Industry groups gave almost exclusively to candidates who ultimately won their campaigns. Winners received $990,774; incumbent senators not up for re-election received $16,300. In total, industry groups gave 94 percent of all their legislative contributions to those who went on to serve in the 2009 Legislature.\n\nThe industry groups slightly favored Republican candidates and committees with 56 percent of their contributions. Republican legislative candidates received $574,973; Democrats $493,251. When contributing to party committees, however, the industry gave almost twice as much to Republicans.\n\nTABLE 3: Industry Contributions by Recipient Type OFFICE DEMOCRAT REPUBLICAN PROGRESSIVE NON-PARTISAN TOTAL Legislative $493,251 $574,973 $3,500 $0 $1,071,724 Party Committees $79,680 $146,550 $0 $0 $226,230 Other Statewide $17,960 $113,900 $0 $9,500 $141,360 Governor $64,180 $28,742 $0 $0 $92,922 TOTAL $655,071 $864,415 $3,500 $9,500 $1,532,236\n\nDue to campaign contribution limits, contributions were spread out among various candidates. No legislative candidate received more than $27,000, and the average was just over $7,000. All but 2 of the 124 representatives and senators up for election received contributions from these industry groups. See Appendixes B and C for a complete list of legislators and the total they received from industry groups.\n\nIndustry groups targeted incumbents with 85 percent of their contributions. Nine of the top 10 recipients were incumbent officials — the one exception was Dino Rossi, the challenger to Gregoire in the high-profile governor's race. The three top legislative candidates — Sens. Hewitt, Schoesler, and Zarelli — all sit on the influential Senate Ways & Means committee, which eliminated the cap-and-trade system from SB 5735 as discussed below.\n\nTABLE 4: Top Recipients of Industry Contributions CANDIDATE OFFICE RESULT TOTAL McKenna, Rob (R) Attorney General Won $55,800 Sutherland, Doug (R) Public Lands Commissioner Lost $50,250 Gregoire, Christine (D) Governor Won $46,900 Rossi, Dino (R) Governor Lost $28,742 Hewitt, Mike (R)* Senate Republican Leader Won $26,200 Schoesler, Mark G.

The average legislative leader received $8,775, 38 percent more than the $6,322 average for non-leaders. The six leaders to receive the most money were key Republican leadership positions.\n\nTABLE 5: Legislative Leadership Receiving Over $10,000 LEGISLATOR BODY POSITION TOTAL Hewitt, Mike (R) Senate Republican Leader $26,200 Schoesler, Mark G.

Gregoire and legislative leaders announced a package of climate-change legislation that would \"create jobs, expand [Washington's] green economy, and make important progress toward energy independence.\" The Green Jobs and Climate Change package includes a cap-and-trade system designed by the seven states (including Washington) and four Canadian provinces in the Western Climate Initiative. Gregoire also proposed investments totaling $455 million in the next biennium for energy-reducing transportation projects, energy efficiency projects, green buildings and clean-energy technology. Another piece of legislation provides a state tax exemption for plug-in electric vehicles. Citing the $9 billion shortfall facing Washington, the tax incentives were abandoned.\n\nCap and Trade\n\nPart of Gov. Gregoire's climate change package was a cap-and-trade bill that would have authorized Washington to take part in a regional cap-and-trade system of Western states. The bill, SB 5735, introduced on January 29, was narrowly passed on February 25 by the Senate Committee on Environment, Water & Energy, with minor changes. The bill then went to the Senate Committee on Ways & Means, where it underwent major revisions. The bill no longer authorized the state to implement a carbon cap, but rather found that a cap was unnecessary due to the economic downturn and subsequent decline in greenhouse gas emissions. The amended bill directed a study to be presented to the 2011 Legislature, and laid out general guidelines for future plans to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Despite the changes, environmental groups still strongly pushed for the bill's passage. Although the bill was not passed before the legislature adjourned on April 26, it may be included when Gov. Gregoire calls a special legislative session for bills that the legislature did not have time to consider.\n\nOn February 25, SB 5735, sponsored by committee chair Phil Rockefeller, passed on a 6-5 vote out of the Senate Committee on Environment, Water, & Energy. The committee members who voted \"yes\" all received more in contributions from industry groups than those who voted \"no,\" though this comparison may be skewed by the fact that four of the five senators who voted \"no\" were not up for election this year, while only one senator who voted \"yes\" was not up for election.\n\nTABLE 6: Industry Contributions to Senate Committee on Environment, Water, & Energy SENATOR PARTY VOTE ON SB 5735 INDUSTRY TOTAL % OF CAMPAIGN FUNDS Hatfield, Brian Democrat Y $19,250 11% Rockefeller, Phil (Chair) Democrat Y $11,100 7% Pridemore, Craig (Vice Chair) Democrat Y $10,350 8% Fraser, Karen Democrat Y $5,700 8% Ranker, Kevin Democrat Y $2,600 1% Marr, Christopher J.* Democrat Y $2,150 3% Honeyford, James D.* (Ranking Minority Member) Republican N $1,300 19% Holmquist, Janea Republican N $1,000 12% Sheldon, Timothy M.* Democrat N $1,000 3% Morton, Robert H.* Republican N $500 12% Delvin II, Jerome L.* Republican N $300 4% TOTAL $55,250 6%\n\n*Not up for reelection in 2008.\n\nOverall, the \"no\" voters received much more in industry contributions, averaging $13,556 per senator\n\nThe Senate Committee on Ways & Means amended the legislation into a study bill, rather than a cap-and-trade program. The substitute bill passed the Ways & Means Committee on a 12-8 vote on March 2. Of the committee members up for election in 2008, the five who against the study bill received the most money from industry donors. Overall, the \"no\" voters received much more in industry contributions, averaging $13,556 per senator (total $108,450). In comparison, the \"yes\" voters received $51,881, or $4,323 per senator. Five of the 12 senators who voted in favor of the study bill received no contributions from industry donors. Interestingly, a number of senators sit on both the Environment, Water & Energy and the Ways & Means committee, including bill sponsor Phil Rockefeller and Sens. Pridemore, Fraser, and Honeyford.\n\nTABLE 7: Industry Contributions to Senate Committee on Ways & Means SENATOR SB 5735 VOTE PARTY INDUSTRY TOTAL % OF CAMPAIGN FUNDS Hewitt, Mike N Republican $26,200 12% Schoesler, Mark G.

Contributions to members of the House committees are not shown. However, the Institute's Legislative Committee Analysis Tool (L-CAT) shows energy industry or agriculture/timber industry contributions to members of the House Ecology & Parks Committee, which heard the bill on March 17, and the House Ways & Means Committee, which heard the bill on April 4. For instance, electric utilities Puget Sound Energy and Avista Corp. were both top contributors to Ecology & Parks members. Puget Sound Energy gave $9,400 to seven of the 14 representatives, while Avista Corp. gave $8,100 to eight of the committee members. Timber companies distributed $32,350 to committee members.\n\nAppendix A: List of Industry Donors\n\nTABLE 8: Industry Contributors Contributor Member Of Total Weyerhaeuser Co.
