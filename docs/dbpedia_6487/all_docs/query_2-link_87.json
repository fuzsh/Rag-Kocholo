        "text": "Earlier this week, while the air quality across King County was extremely unhealthy due to wildfires in Canada, Governor Jay Inslee used the opportunity to grandstand and promote a gas tax (Initiative 1631). The Governor’s alter ego, “Captain Planet,” has been pushing a gas tax for years, and the idea has failed to pass in both the Legislature as well as an initiative in a previous election. Inslee and the rest of those advocating for this tax do not seem to understand one very clear issue: a gas tax is unwanted.\n\nSadly, a gas tax in Washington State has no impact on the smoke blowing down from Canada to pollute the Puget Sound region. But that didn’t stop our governor. Last week, as our state was blanketed in smoke and haze from forest fires, Inslee surrounded himself with children on a smoky playground scene, claiming the virtues of his latest gas tax initiative at a press conference. The smoke from this week’s wildfires in Canada (a country that already embraces a carbon tax) is hardly related to combustion engine emissions. Connecting the smoke from wildfires with a gas tax is simply misleading and dishonest.\n\nAccording to Todd Myers from the Washington Policy Center, “the tax would start at 20 cents per gallon and increase about six percent per year (3.5% plus inflation). In 2029, the tax would be about 36 cents per gallon.” The idea of imposing a tax on gas and carbon emissions has been on the Democrat’s minds for a while now, as they worked to try and pass it as an initiative in 2016. I-732, or the Washington Carbon Emission Tax and Sales Tax Reduction, was overwhelming rejected by voters, losing 59.25% to 40.75%. Thankfully, we are happy to report that SB 6203, a bill that would create a gas tax, failed to pass the state Senate this year. Now, Democrat leaders have pushed for it to be on the ballot again as an initiative.\n\nA gas tax was soundly rejected by Washington voters in 2016 and fell flat in the legislature earlier this year. Yet “Captain Planet” and the rest of those advocating for a gas tax are still trying to find a way to force its creation, this time as another initiative. Voters should do what they did in 2016 and vote no on a gas tax (I-1631 when it appears on ballots across the state this November.\n\nEarlier this week, it was reported that 8th Congressional District candidate Kim Schrier compared her campaign to fighting in World War II. These comments made by Schrier are extremely disrespectful to the selfless veterans who actually put their lives on the line and served in WWII. A political campaign involves no physical threat compared to fighting in a war and the comparison that was made is simply appalling.\n\nAfter learning of these comments from Kim Schrier, veterans from across the region released a joint statement that was distributed by the Washington State Republican Party. The statement opened with the veterans expressing their “deep concern and disappointment in congressional candidate Kim Schrier’s comments, comparing the sacrifices made by veterans to her political campaign.”\n\nKIRO radio host Dori Monson picked up the story on his show and added “this is a nauseating comparison. It shows such a lack of perspective. You’re not likely going to take a bullet in your brain like all of the young men at the front of those landing boats in the first wave at Normandy.”\n\n8th Congressional District candidate Kim Schrier’s extremely hyperbolic comparison of campaigning to fighting in WWII proves that she is out of touch with reality, and out of touch with the constituents of the 8th Congressional District. Current Congressman Dave Reichert has always focused on veterans during his time in office, and Republican candidate Dino Rossi would do the same. Schrier, on the other hand, does not seem to respect our veterans in the way they have so earned and deserve.\n\nLast month, The News Tribune reported that the Federal way light rail project is $460 million over budget, adding up to a total projected cost of more than $2.5 billion. This news comes just one year after it was announced that the Lynnwood light rail station was $500 million over budget and would be completed six months late. After a huge increase in car tab fees, an increased sales tax, and more, voters from across the region are fed up with Sound Transit. It is time for the organization to be held more accountable.\n\nSound Transit is quickly building a pattern of going significantly over budget. Mariya Frost at the Washington Policy Center explains that “In just one year, Sound Transit has reported over $1 billion in cost overruns.”\n\nIn both the Lynnwood and Federal Way projects, Sound Transit has deflected the blame, putting it on labor, materials, and land costs rather than owning up to their huge mistakes.\n\nThis past year, Sound Transit has been taking a great deal of taxpayer money through insanely high car tab fees, an increased sales tax, and more. Yet the transit agency has proven that they are not able to handle taxpayer money properly. Voters should stand up against Sound Transit and communicate their opposition to cost overruns and delays. The organization must be held accountable. Going over budget by hundreds of millions of dollars (twice!) is simply unacceptable.\n\nThe deadline to cast your ballot for the 2018 primary election is less than a week away and closing in quickly.
