PAGE 2\n\n2. BY BILL SKOWRONSKI Director of Communication and Marketing Central Province, USA I n 1968, Fr. Jim Marchionda, O.P. left home for the Dominican novitiate (at that time, located in Winona, MN). Although he packed everything needed, he left his clarinet at home in a heroic, quasi- saintly gesture, signifying his old life was all behind him and he would start this Dominican life anew. It was a mistake. It was all wrong. Born in Ohio, Fr. Marchionda was raised in New York City, Kansas City, New Jersey, and Minnesota. His father, an Italian immigrant, tailor and clothing designer, passed on his love of music as well as his own e-flat clarinet. Early on, Fr. Marchionda switched to the b-flat clarinet and began private lessons. He excelled quickly, winning contests throughout the East Coast, marching annually in the Atlantic City Miss America Pageant, and serving as student director of a 150-piece high school marching band and 17-piece stage band. Though he had been accepted at a School of Music outside Boston as a clarinet major, Fr. Marchionda followed his parents to St. Paul, Minnesota, to attend the College of St.Thomas planning to return to Boston after one year. During that year, he played with the St. Paul Civic Orchestra and the St. Thomas clarinet quartet, performing in several concerts and large scale events. St.Thomas required freshmen to take courses in Theology and it was there that Fr. Marchionda met the Dominicans for the first time. His freshman teacher, Fr. Jerome Langford, O.P., as well as his sophomore teacher, Fr.Tim McCarthy, O.P., significantly influenced him, but he still felt compelled towards a career in music instead of pursuing the priesthood. Because he was so committed to a music career, Fr. Marchionda wouldn’t even have the conversation about a vocation. It took Fr. Dan Davis, O.P. playing a trick on him, in order to get Fr. Marchionda into the same room with the vocation director, Fr. Bob Perry, O.P. After Fr. Davis left the two alone, Fr. Marchionda finally agreed to talk. He spoke to Fr. Perry for an hour and received regular letters from Fr. Perry for the next six months. Still, it wasn’t until Fr. Marchionda went on a retreat to the Dominican novitiate, that he seriously considered choosing the priesthood over music. “Meeting the novices turned everything around,” Fr. Marchionda said. “It was because of their example. I fell in love with the common life, the fact that so many people could be so happy. I realized it was the lifestyle that was making them this happy. “Previous to that, my religious practice was pretty private, me and Jesus, me and God, going to church, 2 DOMCENTRAL QUARTERLY | SUMMER 2015 SUMMER 2015 | DOMCENTRAL QUARTERLY 3 CONTINUED ON PAGE 4 » sitting in a pew by myself, and loving it,” Fr. Marchionda continued. “What I saw at the novitiate was a whole different world, one that wasn’t singular. I experienced the beauty of common prayer that I had never known before.” The following year, Fr. Marchionda joined the novitiate. A year later in Philosophy studies, he witnessed the happiness of the brothers in the Order of Preachers, but didn’t feel it as completely himself. It felt like something was missing. He realized, in leaving behind his clarinet and his own musical identity, he wasn’t living his life fully enough. He felt incomplete. With the permission and encouragement of the Formation Team, he worked toward a degree in music theory and composition at Chicago’s DePaul University while completing his philosophy studies. After recapturing the missing piece of himself, Fr. Marchionda began to fully realize the happiness he saw in his Dominican brothers. “If you totally abandon who you are to become a Dominican, then you’re not bringing what you know to be your best self to Dominican life,” Fr. Marchionda said. “I don’t think God wants us to abandon what He has already given us. Instead, God intends us to discover new ways in which all the gifts given can become integrated in the same life. “Music is so much a part of the beauty of the prayer. I had never experienced music and prayer coming together so powerfully,” Fr. Marchionda added. “All of the sudden, my worlds merged.They came together in a way that I never would have expected.” His deep love of music and itinerant preaching made Fr. Marchionda one of the best- traveled friars in the Central Province. For over 20 years, he has preached throughout the United States. During some months, he locks himself away to compose music to present to World Library Publications, who publishes his work. Then, he records a CD and shares it with people throughout the year wherever he preaches. Although brothers in the Central Province had asked him to consider the role of Provincial leadership, he has not been so inclined because the combined career of preaching and music has been so rewarding. He feared accepting a leadership role would require his leaving the music behind once again. This summer, during the 19th Provincial Chapter, the friars discussed the ongoing challenges of living Dominican common life in a world polluted by distractions and overburdened by demands of time. The Chapter delegates recognized the importance of their common life and once again thought Fr. Marchionda may be the ideal person to tap for its renewal. “He has a heart for the brothers that is difficult to match,” said Central Province Promoter of Vocations, Fr. Andy McAlpin, O.P. “He is often one of the last men to leave the table at mealtime and his joyful spirit is infectious and inviting.” So, on June 17th, his 68th birthday, Fr. Marchionda accepted the call from his brothers to lead them as the Central Province’s 12th Prior Provincial. He jokingly remarks that he is the oldest man elected to the position in the province’s 76-year history. “Even though this is a change in direction from where I was headed, it’s exciting at the same time,” Fr. Marchionda said. “The brothers have been so incredibly supportive with emails, texts and phone calls. I think it is simply God’s way of directing me.” It seems to work out for Fr. Marchionda when he backs into things. He backed into the College of St.Thomas when his parents asked him to move with them to the Twin Cities—and he met the Dominicans. He backed into a conversation with the Dominican Vocations Director when his best college pal tricked him into the meeting. He backed into a composition degree at DePaul University because it was the only one he could achieve in the amount of time the province had allotted him during Philosophy studies. And now he has composed and published well over 100 works. Now, as he considers the many times he’s backed in to the circumstances of his life, guided by God’s grace, Fr. Marchionda looks at the tasks ahead and to the coming year with joy and enthusiasm as the Order of Preachers prepares for its 800th Jubilee in 2016. “We seem to have a healthy tension in the Order, with many men in limited service, a good number of newly ordained and many young men still in formation,” he said. “We have to ask ourselves how we can live a common brotherhood, forming a depth of community rooted in sincere fraternal love.” His early life growing up with three younger brothers living in four different states prepared him well for the Dominican common life and itinerancy to draw from. He SENT TO preach THE NEW PROVINICIAL\n\n3. BY BILL SKOWRONSKI Director of Communication and Marketing Central Province, USA E ach of us has been sent by God for a reason. As we prepare to celebrate the Dominican Order’s 800th Jubilee in 2016, we’re asking ourselves, What am I SENT TO do? When she was 14 years old, Carmen Rodriguez asked herself what she was here to do and how she could help others. Looking at the world around her, she recognized a growing population of Spanish-speaking people. She wanted to serve God and she thought the best way would be as a woman religious. Several years later, she joined a convent, but found the life wasn’t right for her. She even left the Catholic Church for a period of time. “I know some people have left the Church, but God never forgets us,” Carmen said. “In order to be at peace with ourselves and others, having a deep and profound relationship with God is important and the rest follows.” And so it did. Carmen became very involved at two parishes, one in the western suburbs of Chicago and one in the city itself. She earned her teaching degree, finally found her niche working with people with disabilities, children affected by drugs, and needy residents in the Hispanic community of St. Pius V, a Dominican parish in Chicago’s Pilsen neighborhood. At St. Vincent Ferrer Parish (a Dominican parish in River Forest, IL), Carmen received the spiritual direction she needed and became a Lay Dominican. Today, she is a faithful parishioner and a retired special education teacher. For years, Carmen considered teaching to be her vocation because she felt she had something to offer the handicapped community. “I like to help,” Carmen said. “Every person has a unique gift from God. He has been so wonderful to me; He gives and I give back.” Now, Carmen gives back financially to help support the Dominican Friars in formation.This year, 26 men count on donors like her in order to pursue their own vocations. “I feel like the role of the priest and continuing God’s church is one of the most important professions, so I want to assist young men who choose to answer that call,” Carmen said. “To preach for the salvation of souls is to be Christ to the entire world, which is a very difficult task, but one the Order of Preachers emphasizes.” In the model of St.Therese of the Little Flower, Carmen prays for priests every day. She recognizes their important role in the Church, as well as hers. “Jesus was sent here to save us,” she said. “We all have a place within the body. Each part has a function to do. I want to help in any small way I can to help build the Kingdom.” Some people have a favorite charity and hers is the young friars in Dominican formation. “All the saints left something before us. I live my life as a very simple woman so I want to continue donating money as long as I can for the education of the Dominican student brothers,” she said. “The Dominican family is my community and my legacy as a Catholic. Now God’s plan is unfolding within it.” To learn more about supporting the Dominican student brothers, visit www.OPCentral.org/support. Ω « CONTINUED FROM PAGE 3 4 DOMCENTRAL QUARTERLY | SUMMER 2015 SUMMER 2015 | DOMCENTRAL QUARTERLY 5 DONOR PROFILE A glimpse into the life of donor and Lay Dominican Carmen Rodriguez has maintained strong relationships with the brothers of the province. He seems to have a gift for relating to the men in the Order and an artistry to finding creative solutions to issues facing the province. “As different as we are, our differences cannot be the defining factor. Our brotherhood has to be the defining factor,” Fr. Marchionda said. “It’s up to us to be so creative and committed to being what we need to be to each other that our differences don’t harm us or interfere with our common life.” This common life, he feels, is perhaps the best gift the Order can offer the Catholic Church and its people. “The highest form of preaching we can offer is the witness of our lives. Secondarily, it’s what we say, how we say it and where we say it,” Fr. Marchionda said. “If people see Dominican brothers, as different as they are, dwelling together in unity, they are already being preached to.” Attributed to St. Francis and echoed more recently by Pope Francis, Fr. Marchionda recalled the quote, “Preach always, if necessary use words.” The first preaching is not the preaching of words, but the witness of lives. It was the example of his first two Dominican teachers at the College of St.Thomas that attracted Fr. Marchionda’s attention. He strongly believes that same witness must be at the heart of each community in the Central Province and that it can make a real difference in the lives of families today. “Families can see brothers as different as night and day making sacrifices to live together and spend time together no matter how busy schedules are,” Fr. Marchionda said. “Witnessing this, families learn that they too can have much more if they just stay connected, pray together, attend Mass together, share more meals together and do more together than society demands.There’s a way in which the nitty gritty of community life can rekindle what all family life should be.” In the months and years to come, Fr. Marchionda plans to meet with the Dominican brothers throughout the Central Province in order to encourage and reinforce their community lives, both for their sakes, and as a witness to the people they serve. Regarding the laypeople who assist us in our mission, Fr. Marchionda says, “Be grateful for what they have to give, learn who they are, and do what you can to reinforce and align their gifts with our Dominican values.” True to the servant-leadership model,Fr.Marchionda is already working hard to encourage people to be aware of their gifts and to use them to the best of their ability,instead of leaving their clarinets at home. Ω SENT TO build the Kingdom In June, the Provincial Chapter elected Fr. Jim Marchionda, O.P., to be its 12th Prior Provincial. THE NEW PROVINICIAL “As different as we are, our differences cannot be the defining factor. Our brotherhood has to be the defining factor. It’s up to us to be so creative and committed to being what we need to be to each other that our differences don’t harm us or interfere with our common life.” — Fr. Marchionda\n\n4. I n this issue of the DomCentralQuarterly magazine, we want to give readers a chance to learn some of the common language of the Dominican Order as a way to better understand its unique organizational structure and governance leading up to the 800th Jubilee (anniversary) in 2016. In 1216, when St. Dominic de Guzman gathered his band of friars to preach, he decided they would govern themselves through regular meetings, or chapters. In the early years, the Order was small enough that all the communities of brothers could gather together in a General Chapter. But by 1221, the Order had grown to a size that the General Chapters were no longer able to address all the issues from the various parts of the world. That year a decision was made to divide the Order into provinces, or geographic regions. Over the centuries, it became part of The Book of Constitutions and Ordinations that Provincial Chapters would be held every four years to elect leaders and legislate those things necessary to guide the province. For the 19th Provincial Chapter of the Province of St. Albert the Great, held in St. Louis this summer, each of the Central Province’s six priories sent its elected leader (Prior), as well as a second delegate, while the six remaining houses and brothers living alone created clustered colleges and selected representatives of their own. A student brother was elected to have a voice at the Chapter, but no vote. Historically, the Prior Provincial governs the province and also sits on the Provincial Council, which is made up of representative brothers. As soon as the Chapter convenes, the Prior Provincial leaves office so the Chapter can elect or re-elect its leadership for the next four years. Because of its importance, the Dominican Order’s Constitutions require that there be days of prayer and discussion before any voting takes place. Elections cannot take place before the fourth day of a Chapter and must be completed by the eighth day. Any delegate can propose the name of a friar to be considered for all the offices that have become vacant. No friar can 6 DOMCENTRAL QUARTERLY | SUMMER 2015 SUMMER 2015 | DOMCENTRAL QUARTERLY 7 THE 19TH PROVINCIAL CHAPTER BR. ED VANMERRIENBOER, O.P. Blessed Sacrament Parish, Madison, WI What is the 19th Provincial Chapter? vote for himself. Our leaders are always under our Constitutions in a similar way that the United States President and elected officials must obey the nation’s Constitution. The 18 delegates (the Student Peritus cannot vote) elect or re-elect the Prior Provincial and then select four diffinitors, who will ultimately finalize the Acts of the Chapter— the document containing the recommendations, ordinations, and commendations decided during the proceedings. The Province of St. Albert the Great (Central Province, USA) is generally governed by 10 Provincial Council members. By virtue of their office, the Council includes the Prior Provincial, the Socius (“associate” or “companion” of the Prior Provincial), and the Regent of Studies (overseer of brothers enrolled in formal studies).The Chapter elects three councilors to join the four diffinitors, rounding out the new Provincial Council.The Chapter also elects a delegate to represent the Central Province at the General Chapter (in 2016), at which the worldwide Order continues to meet on its own three- year schedule. Each Chapter also appoints members of the province to various Boards and Commissions. All are given a term of office and a mandate to do a particular task. In addition, some friars belong to the Admissions Board and they give their vote on men applying to enter the province. Others will be appointed to promote study among the members.These groups are under the oversight of the Provincial and Council during their term of office. This year, the delegates formed four commissions to address the issues that face the province: Evangelization, Intellectual Life, Leadership, and Mendicancy. After all the work is completed the “Acts of the Chapter” are sent to the Master of the Order who with his Council will give approval or correct their actions so that the unity of the universal Order is maintained. Similar to our American political system, the goal of a Provincial Chapter is to seek the common good of the province. This means that all decisions should promote the preaching for the salvation of souls for which the Order was founded. Policies, projects, budgets and appointments are all means to improve the preaching of the gospel. In particular, for the Central Province it challenges us to help people come alive with the spirit of Christ in their daily lives. All who are elected are merely servants of the Word of God.

BY FR. MICHAIL FORD, O.P. Spiritual Director, Dominican Shrine of St. Jude What Are the Ministries of St. Jude? T he Dominican Shrine of St. Jude has helped people grow in their faith and find hope through intercessory prayer since 1929. In its 86-year history in Chicago’s Pilsen neighborhood, hundreds of thousands of people have visited the Shrine inside St. Pius V Catholic Church and attended our Solemn Novenas, as well as weekly Masses.The Shrine itself may be a destination for devout visitors worldwide, but the Dominicans also provide a wide range of outbound educational and spiritual programs for parishes, schools, and other Catholic groups to bring St. Jude’s message of hope to God’s people.We call these programs the Ministries of St. Jude. Is Devotion to St. Jude Still Relevant? The Apostle St.Jude Thaddeus was sent by our Lord Jesus to proclaim the Gospel throughout the world.In recent decades,many of our Catholic brothers and sisters were not taught about our patron saint or our life- giving,traditional devotions.Many don’t know why we ask our great saints to pray with us and for us,or why we venerate their remains in the form of relics.Yet we all still find ourselves in need of hope.Where there’s prayer, there’s hope,and these devotional practices are just as relevant today. What Ministries Do The Dominicans Offer from The Shrine Of St. Jude? • Mass with a blessing of St. Jude Oil • Full nine-day St. Jude Novenas • St. Jude 3-day and 1-day Missions • Retreats, Workshops, Lectures Presentations on: • Catholic Spirituality • Catholic Devotions including the veneration of relics Catholic prayer for: • RCIA • CCD classes • Home School classes • Catholic schools (elementary and secondary) • College and University Catholic Centers We ask participating parishes or organizations to take up a collection to support the Ministries of St. Jude. The proceeds from these programs fund our outreach to schools and other student groups.The Ministries of St. Jude make it possible for the Dominicans to reach future generations of Catholics and deepen their faith wherever they are.

Master General of the Order of Preachers, Father Bruno Cadoré, O.P. confirmed the election of the capitulars of the 19th Provincial Chapter. Following days of discerning the needs of the Province, and an open dialogue to articulate community hopes and dreams, the Chapter delegates gathered in Saint Louis, Missouri, elected Fr. Marchionda the 12th Prior Provincial in its 76-year history. Seeking a renewal and strengthening of common life, a desire that all members of the Province embrace a deeper unity of life, mission, and ministry within and among themselves, and the discovery of new ways of evangelizing, the Chapter delegates determined that Fr. Marchionda was the fitting choice to lead at this time in the Province’s history. Please join the Friars of the Province of St. Albert the Great, U.S.A. in appreciation and gratitude for the service of Fr. Charles Bouchard, O.P., whose term as Provincial has ended. Please also join us in prayer and celebration for the newly elected Prior Provincial!

BY BOB DIXON Director of the Office for Mission Advancement T here’s an old expression, “What do you give the person who has everything?” While tempted to think this may apply only to very few people, when we think about it, a good number of us have what we need and even most of what we desire. We work hard to care for those around us. We accomplish our very best at work, at play, in our families and in our spiritual lives. And while we are at it we gather a few things around us. At the end of the day, we also generously support those people and places in which we believe. We do all of this out of Caritas, rooted in our deep belief Deus Caritas est, “God is Love.” Those who have this sort of “everything,” you and I, yearn deeply in our humanity to move from just doing things to contributing to something truly important and transformative. Indeed, when we become part of something transformative we ourselves are converted in ways our own success and wealth – no matter how large or small - cannot fulfill. Oddly, we are changed for the better by giving things away. Of course it is not unusual that we would find this difficult and hard to comprehend.That said, this is as much our duty as is anything else we undertake. When we avoid giving, we withhold from ourselves that unique, inspired, God-given opportunity we have to participate in building God’s kingdom in ways only each of us can. Noted theologian and priest Fr. Henri Nouwen once said in his groundbreaking piece, The WHAT’S NEW AT NEW PRIORY PRESS?

HOW YOU CAN HELP OUR MINISTRIES We welcome your transformative support of the Dominican Friars and our ministries. Here are just some of the ways you may help. • The 1216 Annual Fund underwrites the annual $1 million + investment of the Province in the formation of young men entering the Order as well as the costs to care for friars no longer active in ministry • The Ministries of the Dominican Shrine of St. Jude spread the promise of hope to those in need and the message of prayer and devotion to young and old • The Society for Vocational Support provides direct support to the growing number of men entering the Order and the work of the Promoter of Vocations • The St. Dominic Mission Society assists the Province in its obligation to our own friars still serving in Nigeria and to the friars who minister in the Vice Province of Bolivia • The Fr. Michael Kyte, O.P. Fund for Excellence in Preaching honors the memory of this beloved friar by supporting the education of friars in the Province • Estate Gifts to the Province of St. Albert the Great, U.S.A. (Central Province) provide current and long term support to the ongoing work and ministries of the Province To make a gift, call Bob Dixon or Fr. Andrew Carl Wisdom, O.P. at 312.243.0011 or visit www.OPCentral.org Spirituality Of Fundraising, “Fund- raising is proclaiming what we believe in such a way that we offer other people an opportunity to participate with us in our vision and mission…Fund-raising is always a call to conversion.” He further says, “We are inviting people into a new way of relating to their resources. By giving people a spiritual vision, we want them to experience that they will in fact benefit by making their resources available to us. We truly believe that if their gift is good only for us who receive, it is not fund-raising in the spiritual sense. Fund-raising from the point of view of the gospel says to people: ‘I will take your money and invest it in this vision only if it is good for your spiritual journey, only if it is good for your spiritual health.’ In other words, we are calling them to an experience of conversion: You won’t become poorer, you will become richer by giving... Those who need money and those who can give money meet on the common ground of God’s love.” So, to you who have been generous in your support of the many Ministries of the Dominican Central Province, thank you and welcome. Welcome to our life of prayer, study, community and preaching.Welcome to the transformative power of God’s love.Welcome to the common ground of God’s love, where Deus Caritas est. We are truly grateful. Ω Bob Dixon has served the Central Province since 2012.

SAMUEL HAKEEM, O.P. 5th Year Student Brother “…And Jesus in the crucifix speaks to St. Thomas and says, ‘You’ve written well of me, Thomas. What do you want as your reward?’ St. Thomas answered, ‘Non nisi te, Domine. Non nisi te.’ Nothing but you, Lord. Nothing but you.” S o preached Br. Vincent Dávila, O.P. to a group of young adults at St. Dominic Priory in St. Louis one Saturday night in January.These men and women, 27 in all, had joined us for the inaugural Non Nisi Te event—two hours of Eucharistic Adoration with preaching, music, silence, night prayer, and the Sacrament of Reconciliation. During this Year of Consecrated Life, and as we move closer to the 800th Jubilee of the Order, the Dominican student brothers in St. Louis desired to begin a ministerial project which would both contribute to the Archdiocese and increase the Order’s visibility in St. Louis. Our goal was to offer a space and time for Catholics to build a personal relationship with Jesus, on the foundation of Eucharistic Adoration. The event borrowed cues from monthly Adoration nights the brothers had attended in other cities. However, everybody involved in the planning agreed that Dominican identity was important in shaping the event.This led to the inclusion of preaching by the brothers; a mix of modern praise music,Taizé, and more ancient chant from our Dominican tradition; a period of at least 30 minutes of silence during adoration; and ending the event with Dominican night prayer, recently translated and arranged by Fr. David Wright, O.P. and Br. James-Peter Trares, O.P. The student brothers promoted the event largely through word-of- mouth. We reached out to young adults we knew from our ministries in the city’s parishes, to fellow students from the Aquinas Institute, and to students at Saint Louis University. Word spread, thanks in part to an article covering the event printed in the St. Louis Review. Each month’s Non Nisi Te saw larger and larger crowds.The largest event brought 67 people, filling the priory chapel. While the focus was on young adults, the events have been attended by a wide audience. We’ve also seen an increase in people joining us for the Liturgy of the Hours and for daily Mass. Kayla Essner, a graduate student at the University of Missouri, drove nearly two hours to attend the event. “I really enjoyed the praise and worship during adoration, mostly because that is one of my favorite ways to pray,” she said. “I really enjoyed getting to meet the Dominicans and other young adults in St. Louis.” Kayla has been acquainted with the Dominicans assigned to the Newman Center at the University of Missouri in Columbia, MO. Non Nisi Te gave her the opportunity to get to know more Dominicans, connecting the ministry in Columbia with that of the wider province. Saint Louis University medical student Stephen Grote attended each of the four Non Nisi Te events. “It was a good chance for me to leave behind the craziness and anxiety of medical school for a couple of hours,” he said. “I really appreciated the good mix of silent prayer, wonderful music, thought-provoking scripture and preaching, and Reconciliation. I always left refreshed and renewed in spirit. It came at a time when I was struggling, and gave me the loving reminders of God in our world that I really needed.” The Dominican character of the event had a significant impact on Saint Louis University student Maria Miloscia. Following Br. Vincent’s preaching during the first event, Maria said, “I’ll never forget how I experienced a deep-seated desire to echo Thomas in his profession, ‘Non nisi te, Domine’: Nothing but you, Lord.” Maria’s desire to echo St. Thomas led her to discern a call to religious life. She has recently been accepted to the Dominican Sisters of Saint Cecilia, and will begin as a postulant in August. “Non Nisi Te has been a precious time for reflection and communal prayer in my life. It has strengthened me in my faith and augmented my appreciation for my Dominican brothers.” As we enter a new school year, we look forward to continuing this ministry, providing opportunities for men and women to encounter Christ. Our next event will be on Saturday, September 19, from 7:30pm-9:30pm at St. Dominic Priory in St. Louis, MO. If you are in the St. Louis area, please join us!

BY BILL SKOWRONSKI Director of Communication and Marketing Central Province, USA W hen a friend studying at Aquinas Institute of Theology asked Raymond Bryce if he wanted to meet her for Vespers with the Dominicans, he replied, “What’s a Dominican?” That was 2006, when the Dominicans lived in Jesuit Hall at Saint Louis University. His friend is now a member of the Dominican Laity and Fr. Raymond Bryce, O.P. is now an ordained Dominican Priest in the Central Province. His first experience with the Order of Preachers was overwhelming and wonderful. “A flood of guys in white pouring into the chapel,” he said. He came back every week after, and was eventually invited to a Come See vocation weekend. “Being in St. Louis was nourishing and enriching for my faith and prayer life,” Fr. Bryce said. “It was like being guided along by the provident hand of God” It’s possible Fr. Bryce would not have found his way to St. Louis were it not for this guidance, which he felt in a real way during the Easter season in 2006. While stationed at the Air Force base in Little Rock, Arkansas, Fr. Bryce met Max Elliott, a retired Air Force Deacon. Max’s wife Pricilla lured him to attend a Confirmation Mass on base by offering a chicken dinner afterwards. “It was one of the few homilies I’ve never forgotten,” Fr. Bryce said. “I remember preachers who were good, but this homily was burned into my memory.” Someone has probably told you that because you’re being confirmed, you have to know all the answers now because you’re Catholic adults. I’m 70 and I don’t have all the answers. Let me give you some good advice for the days and years to come. Pray every day. When you’re praying, if the Holy Spirit ever comes and asks you to do something, no matter what it is, just like when the angel Gabriel came to the Blessed FRIAR PROFILE Have the Courage to Say Yes Fr. Raymond Bryce, O.P. receives a special blessing from Fr. Leobardo Almazan, O.P. during the Mass of Ordination. BY BILL SKOWRONSKI Director of Communication and Marketing Central Province, USA O ur primary experience of Catholic priests is often limited to the Mass and the Sacraments— every Sunday, with baptisms, as well as First Holy Communion, weddings and funerals sprinkled in over the years. But there are also a few uniquely gifted men who are called to serve the Church somewhat behind the scenes, pouring over theological texts, publishing philosophical papers and working intellectually to restore credibility to our Church, which is under attack now as much as it ever has been. Father James Dominic Rooney, O.P. was born in Akron, Ohio. By middle school, when he began seriously considering a vocation, he had already lived in Okinawa, Japan, where his father was a Naval Officer. His parents Thomas and Maryanna are physicians and exposed him to French, German, and Latin while raising him in Virginia, South Carolina and Toledo. Oddly enough, Fr. Rooney was turned on to deeper religious and philosophy study while reading pop science books by Stephen Hawking and Jacques Maritain, particularly The Degrees of Knowledge, which he credits for leading him to his personal conversion. Although, Fr. Rooney was educated by Jesuits, he knew he wanted to join the Order of Preachers even before meeting the Dominicans. Today, there may only be three U.S. Dominicans who are bi- ritual and 25 worldwide, of which he is one. His upbringing influenced his decision to pursue Eastern bi-ritual faculties (Byzantine) to help hear confessions and preach. Growing up, Fr. Rooney attended a Byzantine church once a month and on major holidays. Father seems to be following in the footsteps of the great intellectual friars from the Order’s history. His role in the Order will more likely be forming others, preparing future Dominicans to be good thinkers, publishing philosophical papers and continuing advanced research. “He is one of the more widely read brothers I know—however what continues to impress me is his love of prayer,” Dominican classmate Br. Patrick Hyde, O.P. said. “Often times it is easy to overlook the absolute necessity of prayer in our lives and unfortunately the role of prayer in our theological and philosophical studies. James Dominic was always the first one in the chapel each morning in the novitiate and often times throughout our time of study in St. Louis.” He has already been published in Oxford’s Journal of Church and State, and as a novice brother was given the Young Scholars Award by the American Catholic Philosophical Association, but Fr. Rooney acknowledges not everyone is going to be an academic. Still, having good Catholic academics is a way to form and educate other people to know their faith and to be evangelizers. “Dominicans have a heck of a lot to contribute to evangelization. I’m supporting the faith by doing theological philosophy,” Fr. Rooney said. “If you don’t have the academics to make the faith credible, explain the faith, and deal with problematic issues, how can we get into places where nobody is reaching the unchurched?” It’s hard to keep people in the Church and address various ethnic groups, Rooney says, because Catholics in the United States aren’t used to evangelization. “He is constantly asking himself and others how best to bring the good news of Jesus Christ to those who don’t believe,” Br. Hyde said. “James Dominic is not simply an intellectual, he is a man who loves all of his brothers and sisters, and has zealously gone out of his way to search out and nourish those who have fallen away from the faith and those who have turned to atheism and agnosticism.” At one point, someone close to Fr. Rooney practically nearly converted to Buddhism. In an amazing act of love, Fr. Rooney read a nearly 1,000 page Buddhist book so that when he spoke with his friend about Buddhism, he was informed and could adequately respond to his questions. And James Dominic extends his willingness for dialogue FRIAR PROFILE Embracing the Intellectual Life Fr. James Dominic Rooney, O.P.

Himself only 28 years old, he encourages other young brothers to engage philosophers who are not Catholic. Further, he has been a resource and a voice of reason for his brothers. “For the Gospel to be preached effectively, we need more men like James Dominic who are willing to take risks in bringing people to the Word,” Br. Hyde said. “In good times and in difficult times, he was always quick to remind me of the importance of our vocation and the primacy of Christ, not ourselves in following that vocation.” Ω Father Rooney was ordained a Dominican priest on May 16th in St. Louis, where he earned a Masters of Theology from Aquinas Institute of Theology and where he will now pursue a Doctorate of Philosophy at Saint Louis University. BY ANDRÉS TRUJILLO Dominican Novice I t is still incredible for me to think that just last year I began discerning a call to the Dominican Order, and now I have been accepted to the novitiate. It all began as inklings in my heart about the priesthood, which then led to a fascination. In truth, I avoided the priesthood for a long time. But after watching videos by the Dominicans about discernment, I had to ask myself a question that was presented by the late Fr. Benedict Ashley, O.P., who said that the first thing a man ought to think about when it comes to a vocation is the Church herself, in the sense of what it needs from YOU at this present time. “What does the Church need from me?”When I am really honest with myself, I can see that the Church needs me to be a religious priest.The more I begin to explore and discover who I am, what I am attracted to, what I like and what I like to do, the more I can see that where I find peace is in a life dedicated to holiness in a religious order. It is important for every man who is discerning any kind of vocation to ask himself Fr. Benedict’s question. It is a very interesting time in history to be saying yes to a religious vocation. We live in a world where secularism grows every day.This has created a society where so few people think about God every day, if they think about Him at all. Further, as secular values try to replace religious ones, we begin to see that people are now hungering for lasting truth more than ever.Their souls and their hearts are starving for truth, and yet truth is to be found in one person because that one person is truth itself.That person is Jesus Christ.This presents those in the Dominican Order with a unique and exhilarating challenge similar to the one St. Dominic faced as an early preacher against heresy.This challenge is bringing Christ to the people, to illuminate a society that has been very much darkened with things that do not and cannot satisfy.This challenge is taken up out of great love and compassion for the people to whom we preach.We are called to bring people the Truth, the knowledge of Christ, and to provide them with the tools needed to grow as human beings made in the image and likeness of God. There is a great need for meaning in our world today, and the Dominicans have always been the ones to rise up to the challenges of the times. Having studied diplomacy and the Russian language, I could have been a lot of things. I ultimately learned that I was being called to something much more. I left behind the possibilities of becoming a government agent, a diplomat, or an interpreter for a life of prayer, study, community, and preaching. It is a life dedicating every minute to the salvation of souls either through prayer or through preaching and teaching. It is a life dedicated to growing so close to God and so like His Son Jesus Christ that you become a saint.The sacrifices will be great, but the fruits are irresistible and beyond imagination. I am nervous, but by no means am I afraid. Christ has been calling me for a long time to the service of His Church and His people.There is a need in His Church to preach the Gospel more than ever, and I feel I am truly doing everything to meet this need, this call he is issuing out to me. So to those who are still discerning, ask yourselves: “What does the Church need from me?” Ω What does the Church need from me? Mother, just do what she did and have the courage to say yes, even if you don’t know how it’s going to happen. When the bishop gave that homily, at the point where he said “the angel Gabriel,”Bryce felt the undeniable sense the Lord spoke to him and He said the thing the bishop is saying is what I am saying. What I want you to do is become a priest. Father Bryce broke down in tears right there. The first time he visited Chicago, Fr. Bryce made the trip with Sr. Maria Vianney, O.P., who at the time was still discerning her call to religious life as well.That night, he met Fr. Marty McCormick, O.P., who had been diagnosed with brain cancer and given only six months to live.The two men shook hands and Fr. Marty said, “If I could do it all again, I wouldn’t just walk back, I would run back to the Dominicans. My life has been so blessed, it’s been such a gift.” Dominican life has also been a gift to Fr. Bryce. He chose the Order for its focus on Community Life, which he admits is both supportive and challenging in a constructive way. “You get into religious life and you realize you have support to lean back on when days get tough.The brothers are there for you,” Fr. Bryce said. “Of course we’re all also working on growing which means we’re not perfect and we get on each other’s nerves, but all the rough edges help you grow in holiness as well.” As a C-130 pilot, he enjoyed being part of the five-man crew it took to fly the plane. Now he brings that unique leadership ability into active ministry. “I met people in the military in my first year who were solid Christians and they were able to show me what Christian leadership looks like,”Fr. Bryce said.“It has its own particular flavor.You can tell someone that you should care about your people, be professional and work hard, but when you see a Christian doing that, there’s more than an obligation, there is a genuine capacity to care for people— it’s a part of their Christian witness.” “There was nothing I loved more than being in the military and being an Air Force pilot,” Fr. Bryce added. “The only thing I could’ve loved more was God, and it was him that came calling.” Ω Fr.
