        "text": "The aim of this article is to outline the issues related to the specificity of the image of the writer and his role in society created in Tadeusz Konwicki’s early works. This stage in the writer’s life opens with the first short story that Konwicki published, namely “Kapral Koziołek i ja” from 1947, after which the initial model of his writing is subject to gradual erosion and ends between 1954 and 1955 with the novel titled Z oblężonego miasta. Investigating the motif of the creative work house on the basis of Z oblężonego miasta is a pretext for reflection on the category of the writer’s work. The article traces the motifs of the professional category of the writer, through analysing the constructions on which Konwicki’s narratives are based. At the same time, due to the analysis of social discourse in which the author participated, the article outlines the social functions he performed at a given time.\n\nAbst rac t It is indeed rare to consider Tadeusz Różewicz’s ‘lyrical Self’ as melancholic, but many interpreters and critics do point to the motif of ‘lack’ in Różewicz’s poetry. Naturally, not all lack must be related to melancholy: we speak of melancholy only when the loss breaks away from the object and attaches itself to the subject, becoming its integral part. In Różewicz’s poetry, however, from the beginning we can fi nd yet another characteristic fi gure of melancholy. These problems are considered in this article on the basis of the later works of Tadeusz Różewicz in sections devoted to topics such as: the object of loss, the passage of time, ‘the birth and death of God’ as a double, the fundamental lack, the existence of the poet in ‘time’, ‘worthlessness’ and fi nally, the kulturkritik by Tadeusz Różewicz with a focus on repetition, melancholy and mourning.\n\nThis text is an attempt at repaying the author’s debt (both as an academic intellectual and as a regular reader) towards two inspiring essayists: Marta Piwińska and Józef Czapski. From the latter, the author of the article gained a lesson in establishing an intimate relationship with a work of literature he reads or a painting he views. From Piwińska he learnt the poetics of a mentally disciplined essay and gained the ability to associate the readings of the literature of the Polish Romanticism with contemporary sensitivity and the grand works of high modernism of the 20th century. In this article, the author analysed the records of fragments of the life and artistic struggles included in eight essays by Czapski (from the Patrząc and Czytając collections) as well as extensive essays with a literary studies’ focus by Piwińska (from books: Złe wychowanie and Juliusz Słowacki od duchów). The author focussed on the essayistic studies of the experiences of lostness and tiredness, the wor...\n\nIn this essay I would like to consider the tension between communication and perception in Polish poetry after 1989. The poets I will discuss avail themselves of the expressive means of the visual and performing arts as well as music to convey their negotiations of communication and perception. But it is a special avatar of the poet that stages the drama in which perception and communication clash – the derelict. The poet-derelict occupies the space between the arts. I propose that the transformation of this derelict figure from Świetliki to Penerstwo to Rozdzielczość Chleba’s “cyber-drunks” (cyberżulerstwo) illustrates the history of Polish poetry and Polish art after 1989, which is at the same time a story of the dissolution of the tension between perception and communication.\n\nThe author analyses a certain phase in the work of Paweł Demirski. She argues that, with his deeply politically engaged, brilliantly intelligent theatre, Demirski appeared almost as a dream come true for all those who yearned for a new Sławomir Mrożek, a Polish Bertolt Brecht or a national verbatim theatre. And yet at the same time they were all absolutely disappointed, as his plays were utterly different from those with which political theatre had come to be associated in Poland. The playwright himself said that he owed most to the furious communist theatre of Dario Fo. As for his creative techniques, however, he is closest to the French situationists. It soon turns out that Demirski is at his best making critical approaches (i.e. dramaturgical rewritings) to found material (i.e. the cultural memory of his audiences). Each time, the unsuspecting audience is violently confronted with the brazen tricks of the playwright, who shifts the meanings, subverts sense and makes countless transgressions against good middle-class and traditional notions of logic. Demirski does not wish to free himself from Polish myths, heritage, history and memory. On the contrary, he does not lay claim to creating new orders of ideas and philosophical-aesthetic systems."
