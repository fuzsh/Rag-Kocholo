        "text": "The Irish Theatre of America found success as well as resistance at the Neighborhood Playhouse. This was likely due not only to the group’s not staging sentimental fare, but also to its putting on peasant plays. One angry theatergoer disrupted a performance of the Red Turf, because he objected to the story about a husband in western Ireland whose wife encourages him to murder a neighbor. Kane later recalled that the man directed everyone in the audience to see what he deemed an authentic Irish story at the Lexington Opera House: “There, we were informed, we would see a play about the real Ireland everybody loved, not a sordid story of bickering farmers.”[9]\n\nKane took the man’s advice and found himself seated at a typical melodrama. “I knew,” he explained,“the whole Chauncey Olcott recipe. I knew the minstrel hero would be a rebel; I knew the daughter of the aristocrat would fall in love with him: I knew the father would discover the hero in disguise at a masked ball: and I knew that the aristocrat would order the arrest of ‘the damned rebel dog.’”[10]\n\nIn May 1915 the Irish Theatre of America moved uptown to the Bandbox Theatre and lost its Irish audience.[11] This meant fewer, if any, interruptions. It also defeated the purpose of impressing Irish-Americans.\n\nBetter opportunities for the actors and directors lay elsewhere. In early 1917, the Irish Theatre of America announced it would cease production until after the war in Europe.[12] Members of the company found work in Irish plays, but not those in the tradition of the Abbey.\n\nIn 1917, some of the group performed in a Broadway production set in Ireland called Grasshopper.\n\nCo-written by Colum and starring Campbell, the play was relatively well received, but it was a compromise of artistic values. The first act was typical of Abbey productions: heavy on dialogue and lacking in high emotional intrigue.By the the end of act one, however, the play changed. “With no preliminary warning,” a Sun observer noted, “the spirit of the stage Irishman of Dion Boucicault suddenly stalked during the second act into the drama.”[13] The Grasshopper did reflect some of the characteristics and traditions of the Irish national theater movement, and cast members Lilian Jago and Máire Digges had professional ties to the Abbey.[14] But the production could not sustain Abbey standards and achieve commercial success.\n\nDark Rosaleen, another Broadway show linked to members of the Irish Theatre of America, took compromise even further. Produced in 1919 and co-written by Kane, the play demonstrated his willingness to pander, the plot centering on a romance and a horse race in Ireland. Writing for the New-York Tribune, Heywood Broun described it as “in the manner of the old-fashioned drama which was popularized in this country by Dion Boucicault” and “a sentimental portrait in which the son of Erin is held up as drunken, irresponsible, and guilt-hearted.”[15]\n\nHiring actress Mollie Carroll also served as a means to drumming up potential ticket sales. Known for her work in Dark Rosaleen and other plays, Carroll drew national attention in April 1920 by flying a plane over Washington, D.C. and showering the city with leaflets demanding recognition of the Irish Republic.[29] If any actress could attract ticket-buyers, especially Irish-American ones, to modern Irish drama in the summer of 1920, it was her.\n\nDespite their differences, the Celtic and the Irish Players both intended to establish Irish national theaters.Moreover,at the same time both staged The Rising of the Moon, written by Abbey co-founder Lady Augusta Gregory. Theater critics did not take kindly to the duplicate productions.[30]\n\nThe Irish Players’scheduled eight-week run closed after only a week because of insufficient ticket sales. Bierne kept trying, incorporating the National Irish Theatre Company with plans to unite the Celtic and Irish Players on a commercial basis. In 1921, “Deborah Bierne’s Irish Players,” as they were called, continued those efforts. But that endeavor also failed. By December 1922, Actors’ Equity was out looking for Bierne to settle claims against her for unpaid wages.[31]\n\nKane, on the other hand, came to accept that New Yorkers did not want to see plays about Irish peasant life.[32] He soon tried to change his group’s focus to Shakespeare, arguing that Elizabethan drama was, in fact, part of a Gaelic theatrical tradition rather than an English one, and that they could put on the Scottish play Macbeth because it was “Celtic.”[33] Dixie Hines, Kane’s own theatrical representative, dismissed the plan as “O’Shakespeare.”[34]\n\nThe goal of establishing a permanent Irish national theater in New York proved insurmountable in the early 1920s, but these thespians’ efforts were not in vain. Some, of course, moved on. Henry O’Neill, notably, found success in Hollywood films.[35] For others, the work to start an Irish theater proved to be one element in a lifetime commitment to promoting Irish culture in the five boroughs. Eileen Curran, for example, championed Irish music and folklore on the radio, gave concerts, and, in 1935, directed a feis, a festival celebrating Gaelic arts, dance, and music, attended by some 2,000 people.[36]\n\nMore immediately, the push for an Irish national theater in New York City proved important to local Irish republican activism. Several of the actors and actresses belonged to the Irish Progressive League and like organizations. Peter Golden, who had performed with Irish Theatre of America in 1915, led the league as its general secretary. Mollie Carroll assisted the league from its start 1917. Actor Emmet O’Reilly was a founding member of both the league and the drama company. Kate Morgan, also of the Irish Theatre of America,was active in Citizens of the Irish Republic.[37]\n\nIrish republican groups worked to generate publicity for the sake of encouraging Americans to support U.S. recognition of the Irish Republic. The name recognition of theatrical members served such efforts. The Irish Theatre of America, the Celtic Players, and the Irish Players may have struggled to find their audiences, but reporters and photographers were happy to cover Irish republican protests -- if only to give the public a glimpse into the lives of attractive actresses such as Curran and Carroll who, in turn, were very comfortable being in the spotlight.[38]\n\nCatherine M. Burns holds a Ph.D. in U.S. History from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Her work has appeared in New Hibernia Review and The Irish in the Atlantic World (University of South Carolina Press, 2010). In 2009, the New York Irish History Roundtable awarded her the John J. O’Connor Graduate Scholarship for her work on the Irish in New York City.\n\n[1] Mary Trotter, Ireland’s National Theaters: Political Performance and the Origins of the Irish Dramatic Movement (Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2001), especially pages xii-xiv, 11-13; Eugene McNulty, The Ulster Literary Theatre and the Northern Revival (Cork, Ireland: Cork University Press, 2008), 3-6, 9-11, 74-76, 116-117.
