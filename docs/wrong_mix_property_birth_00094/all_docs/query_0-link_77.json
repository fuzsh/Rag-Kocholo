        "text": "Man of the Century\n\nBernard Shaw: The Lure of Fantasy, 1918-1950.\n\nby Michael Holroyd.\n\nRandom House. 544 pp. $30.00.\n\nFor a very long time, George Bernard Shaw’s status as an all-purpose sage appeared unassailable. His was the kind of personality around which cults form and flourish; when he died in 1950 at the age of ninety-four, President Truman issued a statement of condolence and the lights of Broadway were dimmed. Such was the charm of Shaw’s impudent self-assurance that his legions of admirers seemed perfectly willing to ignore the fact that the West’s greatest living playwright had, in Samuel Lipman’s biting words, “used the freedoms of an Englishman to plump for the slavery of Russians.” Only now that the Evil Empire has crumbled do the fulsome tributes paid to this committed Stalinist begin to look rather like exercises in black comedy.\n\nWhatever posthumous decline Shaw has suffered as a political prophet, however, has had no obvious effect on his standing as a playwright; from that point of view, Michael Holroyd’s decision to devote twenty years of his own life to writing a three-volume biography of Shaw seems quite unexceptionable. Shaw’s eventful life had previously been very poorly written up. Shaw himself had a hand in all the full-length biographies published during his lifetime, and the results were invariably second-rate or worse. Holroyd, by contrast, is the first author of a major Shaw biography not to have known his subject personally, and the first to have sifted through the vast mound of biographical data that researchers have piled up in the four decades since Shaw’s death.\n\nThe Lure of Fantasy, the final volume of the trilogy, is fully as impressive as its two predecessors, The Search for Love and The Pursuit of Power. The work as a whole is, of course, too long, and one hopes that Holroyd will eventually produce an abridged edition similar to his Shorter Strachey, but few multivolume literary biographies have proved so consistently rewarding. Holroyd has a strong sense of the relevant and a good, clean style that never irritates and never cloys. Like all first-rate biographers, he is sympathetic but unsparing, especially when dealing with Shaw’s political philosophy, a subject that comes up frequently in The Lure of Fantasy. One assumes Holroyd’s own politics to be at least mildly leftish, but there is nothing offensive or euphemistic about his treatment of Shaw’s Stalinism.\n\n_____________\n\nIn recounting the life, Holroyd confirms in depressing detail what Shaw’s kept biographers were only allowed to suggest: that Shaw’s “devil of a childhood . . . rich only in dreams, frightful & loveless in realities” (as he described it in a letter to Ellen Terry) left him a lifelong emotional cripple. A godless puritan par excellence, the mature Shaw was so afraid of ordinary human feelings that he eventually entered into a mariage blanc with a frigid heiress, pouring his stunted passions into his work and his extravagant epistolary flirtations. A vegetarian teetotaler, he turned to music as his only sensual pursuit, yet in this area too he became uncomfortable whenever he strayed very far from the shallows: “He had an aversion,” writes Holroyd, “to reflective, inward-looking music, and was sometimes a poor judge of chamber music because it tended to conflict with his commitment to optimism and the 24-hours-a-day cheerfulness which the public personality of G.B.S. piped forth.”\n\nIf Shaw’s background crippled him, it also left him determined to rise above the shabby gentility of his Dublin childhood. Looking back on his early years as a writer, he recalled a decade of “unbroken failure and rebuff, with crises of broken boots and desperate clothes . . . penniless, loveless, and hard as nails.” But the poor boy who at the age of twenty came to London to make his way in the world had a strong mind and an even stronger will, and by the time he was forty he had turned himself into “G.B.S.,” a public speaker of extraordinary force, a key figure in the Fabian movement, and the most successful English-language playwright of his time.\n\nHaving constructed himself, Shaw assumed that the rest of the human race could do the same tiling. Like many self-made men, he had an expansive, even sentimental conception of the possible and a severely limited grasp of the impossible. “In his world,” Holroyd writes, “there were no evil men except the insane; but there were evil circumstances which he could identify, attack, and eliminate.” People who hold such views are doomed to disillusion, or worse. “The last stage of sentimentalism,” as Irving Babbitt said, “is homicidal mania.” Shaw lived long enough to reach that stage, though his mania, like everything else about him, was cheerfully impersonal.\n\nUnmistakable signs of it had been visible throughout the first part of his career, even in the strangely violent metaphors of his music criticism, in which inept musicians are constantly being torn from limb to limb or tossed into lethal chambers. And when Shaw, appalled by the carnage of World War I and the short-sighted peace terms exacted by the Allies at Versailles, finally lost his faith in the power of democratic socialism to create a workers’ paradise, he turned with apparent relish to the bloodiest brand of optimism known to man: totalitarianism.\n\n“Beware of the pursuit of the Superhuman,” the Devil says in Shaw’s Man and Superman; “it leads to an indiscriminate contempt for the human.” The first clear indication that Shaw had acquired such contempt was the utopian play cycle Back to Methuselah, completed in 1921; as Holroyd remarks, “Here was a 300-year-ro-mance by an extremely fastidious man whose disgust with the physical condition of human beings compelled him to eliminate them from his philosophy.” Characteristically, Shaw sent an inscribed copy of Back to Methuselah to Lenin, “the only European ruler who is displaying the ability, character, and knowledge proper to his responsible position.”\n\n_____________\n\nThe climax of Shaw’s indefatigable efforts to spruce up the image of Soviet Communism was his 1931 visit to the Soviet Union, during which he belched forth an endless stream of quotable remarks that, even in Holroyd’s clipped summaries, have not yet lost their power to nauseate:\n\nHe likened the penal colony at Bolshevo to Battersea Park, salivating over its menus, applauding its entertainments, and sympathizing with the criminals who “will not leave at the expiration of their sentences.” . . . He looks forward to a good performance at “the torture chamber of the Cheka . . . [with] a victim or two ready, so that we may witness the process.”\n\nNo less revolting was Shaw’s own sprightly post-tour summary of life under Big Brother:\n\nOur question is not, to kill or not to kill, but how to select the right people to kill . . . the essential difference between the Russian liquidator with his pistol (or whatever his humane killer may be) and the British hangman is that they do not operate on the same sort of person.\n\nTo understand all, we are told, is to forgive all, and one feels from time to time that Michael Holroyd, who understands much about Shaw’s twisted psyche, has tried too hard to forgive his itch for power. But Holroyd never seeks to justify the unjustifiable, and his only real mistake is in supposing that Shaw’s “fantasies of longevity and dictatorship, which in the actual world did harm to no one, brought some relief to his despair.” Shaw’s Stalinism may have eased his growing sense of political impotence, but it was by no means harmless. By far the most celebrated fellow traveler of the 30’s, Shaw did his best to confer moral legitimacy on Stalin’s regime at precisely the time when the repudiation of Soviet Communism by a world-famous English writer could conceivably have made a difference. But the difference Shaw sought to make, and succeeded in making, was of the opposite kind. “The Webbs,” Holroyd notes, “were Shaw’s preeminent converts to Soviet Communism. But numerous fellow travelers in the 1930’s heard his crusader’s cry ‘Vive Stalin!’ and took their inspiration from him.” Among Western intellectuals, Stalin never had a better salesman than George Bernard Shaw.\n\n_____________\n\nArchibald Henderson, Shaw’s first and most fawning biographer, called his book Man of the Century. Indeed, Shaw is one of the exemplary figures of the 20th century, the very model of the left-wing intellectual. One inevitably wonders how his reputation will hold up in the century to come. Certainly his sheer virtuosity is undeniable, and it is sometimes possible to ignore the political agendas of his plays and revel in the glitter of their electric prose rhythms, as anyone who has ever become caught up in a good performance of Pygmalion or the “Don Juan in Hell” interlude from Man and Superman can testify. But Shaw saw himself primarily as a propagandist, and he would surely have expected his propaganda to be judged by its effectiveness rather than by its artistry. In the wake of the worldwide collapse of Communism, it is hard to see how Shaw can continue to be taken seriously as a playwright of ideas (except, perhaps, at certain American universities). Anyone who reads Holroyd’s Shaw from beginning to end is likely to come away echoing Max Beerbohm, who, asked to contribute to a ninetieth-birthday Festschrift, responded with this trenchant epitaph for his old colleague:\n\nI think that no great man at the moment of his reaching the age of ninety should be offered anything but praise. And very fond though I am of G.B.S. and immensely kind though he has always been to me, my admiration for his genius has during 50 years and more been marred for me by dissent from almost any view that he holds about anything."
