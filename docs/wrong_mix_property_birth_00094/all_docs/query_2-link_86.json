        "text": "No proposal has been made to me for display of a statue of Shaw in St. Stephen's Green.\n\nIt has not been possible to trace any expression of a wish by Shaw to have his statue by Troubetzkoy exhibited in St. Stephen's Green. The statue referred to appears to be one in bronze by Troubetzkoy which is in the National Gallery—for which it was purchased in 1938—and this statue is on exhibition in one of the rooms there.\n\nIn some private letters (addressed to a Mr. Paddy O'Reilly) Shaw did express a wish that this statue should be exhibited (after his death) outside the Gallery—either in Merrion Square or on Leinster Lawn. (In one of the same series of letters he made a reference (probably facetious) to the possibility of a reproduction of it being set up on College Green.) There is no reference therein to St. Stephen's Green.\n\nOther representations of Shaw in painting or in sculpture were bequeathed by him to the several institutions in which they stood at the time of his death."
