        "text": "The LÉ George Bernard Shaw will sail into Dún Laoghaire Harbour tomorrow ahead of the St Patrick’s Day Celebrations.\n\nNamed after the renowned playwright George Bernard Shaw, who had a significant influence on Western theatre, culture, and politics, the naval ship will be open to the public for guided tours on Saturday 16 and Sunday 17 March.\n\nThe crew will also be taking part in the St Patrick’s Day Parade, Dún Laoghaire on Sunday at 11am.\n\nThe 90m Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPV) will be docked at Carlisle Pier, Dún Laoghaire Harbour, with tours by the crew available from 12-3pm on Saturday and 1.30-4pm on Sunday.\n\nThis is a unique opportunity for visitors to explore the ship, learn about its capabilities, and gain insight into its role in defending Ireland’s interests at sea.\n\nTours are free of charge, no booking required and last approximately 20 minutes.\n\n“Dún Laoghaire harbour has a well-established connection with the Irish Naval Service for over 100 years and we continue to build that relationship through our shared maritime heritage.\n\n“We are honoured to welcome the captain and crew of the LÉ George Bernard Shaw to Dún Laoghaire Harbour this weekend.\n\n“This is an opportunity for a new generation to visit and see this incredible Offshore Patrol Vessel, which has the endurance and capability to defend Ireland’s interests at and from any sea in the world” said Councillor Denis O’Callaghan, Cathaoirleach, Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council.\n\nDún Laoghaire Harbour has a strong connection with the Irish Naval Service, highlighted by the yearly visits and the naming of the Irish ship L.É. James Joyce during an official ceremony at the harbour.\n\nIn 2017, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council bestowed the Freedom of Entry to the County on the Irish Naval Service in recognition of its humanitarian service on behalf of the people of Ireland, recognising the shared maritime connection between the Irish Naval Service and Dún Laoghaire Harbour.\n\nThe Dublin built gun boat HMS Helga frequently stationed in Kingstown and shelled Dublin city during the Easter Rising, was later bought, and renamed Muirchú, the first fishery protection principal vessel of the Irish Coastal & Marine Service in 1923 which subsequently became the Irish Naval Service in 1946.\n\nHMS Helga was also responsible for rescuing 90 passengers after the RMS Leinster was torpedoed off Dublin Bay in 1918.\n\nFrank Curran, Chief Executive, Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council said:\n\n“Dún Laoghaire Harbour is embarking on an exciting transformation that will pave the way for a vibrant and inclusive future.\n\n“The Harbour Master Plan and the establishment of a National Watersports Campus will revolutionise the harbour, turning it from a traditionally industrial port into a people-focused space that benefits the entire community and the Irish Naval Service visits to Dún Laoghaire will be an important consideration within that plan.\n\n“This transformation aligns with the town’s vision of becoming a premier maritime, tourism, and economic destination”."
