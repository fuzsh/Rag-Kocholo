        "text": "The Harcourt Hotel is situated on Harcourt Street off the south west corner of St. Stephen’s Green in Dublin City Centre. The Harcourt Hotel is formerly the home of George Bernard Shaw (Irish Playwrite and Critic) who resided there for 1874-1876. All major attractions are within walking distance of the hotel. Additionally, the hotel is located on the Green LUAS Line (tram system) which is a convenient way to travel to Grafton Street, Ireland’s most exclusive shopping district as well as the popular Temple Bar area.\n\nOur Hotel facilities include over 100 bedrooms, 1900 Bar & Restaurant, Harcourt Bar & Garden. The Harcourt Bar is Dublin City Centres newest addition, boasting a chic interior with a spacious outdoor garden lounge. The Bar & Garden has both indoor and outdoor areas of all sizes on offer, from booth style seating to lounge and semi-private areas, the HH caters for all events.\n\nBecause of the city centre location and the fact that the hotel operates a nightclub (on some nights of the week) and a beer garden, some rooms can suffer from noise. This is particularly, but not exclusively related to weekends. All rooms are supplied with ear plugs."
