        "text": "Is this new? 4 years ago, I was able to buy 2 matchday tickets at Willem II w/o a club card. Of course, I had been in contact with the ticket manager for the weeks leading up to the match, so maybe they let me slide.\n\nIf you arrange this in advance with the club, as non-Dutch resident, I'm sure you can buy a ticket without a club card. The rule in Holland though is that you can only buy tickets to a Dutch league game with a club card. You can only buy tickets to league games through the official supporter service units. And they will only sell tickets to club card holders. Unless you can talk yourself into guesting at a VIP box of course.\n\nFor cup games and European games, Dutch clubs typically give first rights to tickets to season ticket holders, then next club card holders, and then if there's any tickets left, non-club card holders. Generally when you don't live in the NL, your chances of of obtaining a ticket to a Dutch game are quite big in the cup, and quite small in the league.\n\nA club can make exceptions to the rule. The rule however is that you cannot buy a ticket without a club card. Jamooky who is not Dutch bought a ticket without a club card five years ago. I am Dutch and a longtime season ticket holder. Who do you think is better versed in Dutch league ticket purchasing affairs? I know the answer to that but I'm sure deep down even you can see that that says more about what you think about me than about the actual subject under discussion here.\n\nI'm just trying to help out a foreign visitor to the Dutch board and answer his question.\n\nI've put some effort in for you and think that you're good to go for the ADO game, see here\n\nhttps://ado-denhaag.voetbalticket-shop.nl/web/show/id=314355\n\n\"Clubcard-verplichting: nee\" means no clubcard necessary at both gate and Primera. Prices are also on that page.\n\nWhen you look on \"wedstrijdoverzicht\" you will get an overview of their upcoming matches. When clicking on both the Ajax and Feyenoord games you will notice that for those games it says \"ja\" meaning yes for clubcard and that every clubcard holder can only buy 1 ticket, this is not the case for the other matches where a clubcard holder can buy up to 4 tickets.\n\nAjax and Feyenoord have rivalries with ADO so are considered high risk, the other games including Twente are not. Since AZ - RKC isn't considered a high risk either, I'm positive that you don't need a clubcard for that match and will have no problem getting tickets since I don't think the stadium will be sold out.\n\nThanks for the updates. Appreciate all the help. Looking good for ADO Den Haag then. Another issue with AZ is apparently the game is likely to be moved as they are in the cup semi final.\n\nAs I can only make a late saturday night game I had picked ADO ahead of Breda and Heracles anyway.\n\nOne more question if the AZ game is moved do I need a clubcard for any of the following 2nd division games. I'll be staying in Delft but don't mind travelling. I assume Willem II in Tilburg is the closest.\n\nFri23/03/12Emmen 19 : 00Fortuna Sittard\n\nMore info\n\nCambuur 19 : 00Den Bosch\n\nMore info\n\nZwolle 19 : 00AGOVV\n\nMore info\n\nHelmond Sport 19 : 00Go Ahead Eagles\n\nMore info\n\nVolendam 19 : 00Sparta Rotterdam\n\nMore info Fri23/03/12Almere City 19 : 00Oss\n\nMore info\n\nWillem II 19 : 00Dordrecht\n\nNot sure about the eerste divisie.\n\nFor the eredivisie, again, in principle you need a club card to buy a ticket to any Dutch professional game.\n\nBut you need to be a resident of the Netherlands (i.e. have a Dutch address) to buy a club card.\n\nIf you don't have a Dutch address you have two options:\n\n1. Get a fan of the home side to buy a ticket for you. On matchday just ask anyone stood around the stadium. They'll probably be happy to oblige, seeing that they can buy multiple tickets on one club card without a problem. Alternatively go to a fan forum of the club and ask if anyone can help you out in advance.\n\n2. Contact the club directly, in advance, and explain your situation. Most clubs are happy to help.\n\nIf you need contact details of a specific club just ask us on this forum."
