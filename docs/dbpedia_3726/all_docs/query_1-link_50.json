We plan to make a comparison between the last two seasons before the fluwelen revolutie (2008-09 and 2009-10) and the seasons 2013-14 en 2014-15 (as far as possible) using some objective and quantitative measurements.\n\nFiled under: FC Dordrecht - Ajax 2 - 1 (5/17/2015)\n\nPlayers who left Ajax for Feyenoord\n\n09/01/2014 - www.afc-ajax.info\n\nIn the early years of the Eredivisie Feyenoord was the rich club and Eddy Pieters Graafland and Henk Groot left Ajax for the money when Feyenoord came.

With this feat he, like other members of the current Ajax selection Jairo Riedewald, Ricardo Kishna, Davy Klaassen en Niklas Moisander, earned a place in the list of players that scored during their Eredivisie debut.\n\nFiled under: FC Dordrecht - Ajax 2 - 1 (5/17/2015)"
