        "text": "In 1956, GVAV became founder members of the Eredivisie, the first tier in Dutch football. GVAV were one of the four professional sides from the city of Groningen, the others being Be Quick, Velocitas and Oosterparkers [nl]. Although GVAV averaged home attendances of at least 10,000 during the early 1960s, it became mired in financial difficulties. It led to the establishment of \"Stichting Betaald Voetbal GVAV\" (lit. 'Professional Football Foundation GVAV') in 1963, a triumvirate of GVAV, the Groningen municipality government and an organization representing local businesses. The three parties paid 300,000 Dutch guilders each to be the foundation's shareholders; GVAV's finances remained in a weak position and their future as a professional side was uncertain; GVAV were also the only remaining professional team from the city of Groningen. The club remained in the Eredivisie until it was relegated to the Eerste Divisie in 1969–70.\n\nIn February 1970, Harm Brink, the chairman of amateur club GRC Groningen [nl], suggested the foundation of a new professional team representing Groningen. Several other amateur clubs from the city supported Brink's idea, and the local businesses and the Groningen municipality government were willing to remit the debt of Stichting Betaald Voetbal GVAV. In September 1970, the GVAV members accepted the plans. GVAV won promotion to the Eredivisie after a one-year absence, and \"Football Club Groningen\" were founded on 16 June 1971 as the successor of GVAV, who returned to amateur football. During the 1970–71 season, GVAV goalkeeper and Dutch international Tonny van Leeuwen conceded only seven goals; no goalkeeper conceded fewer during the year, and Van Leeuwen was honoured by the Royal Dutch Football Association in Rotterdam. On his way home, he died in a car accident, one day before the club's foundation. Groningen played their first match on 17 July, defeating German Regionalliga side TSR Olympia Wilhelmshaven 6–0. The team played in a green and white kit, the colours of the city's coat of arms.\n\nGroningen lost their first league game 1–0 at home against FC Utrecht in front of an attendance of 13,000 spectators. The team recorded their first league victory on the 10th matchday—a 2–1 win at Vitesse—and finished the 1971–72 Eredivisie season 12th out of 18 sides. The club was still mired in financial difficulties; to cut transfer expenses, Groningen established a scouting system. In 1973, Piet Fransen retired after playing 484 matches for GVAV and Groningen, and gaining 6 caps for the Dutch national team. The following year, Groningen ranked bottom and were relegated to the Eerste Divisie; during the season, the team lost 9–0 to Ajax, Groningen's record defeat. The club came very close to bankruptcy but was saved by the Groningen municipality government. In 1974–75, the side finished runners-up to NEC Nijmegen because of a worse goal difference. Groningen qualified for the play-offs which determined the second and final team to gain promotion to the Eredivisie; the side finished second behind FC Eindhoven and remained in the second tier.\n\nIn 1975, Groningen established a youth boarding school, and the club tried to rebuild the squad with youth players. The side placed 8th in the 1976–77 Eerste Divisie—Groningen's lowest league finish—before they missed promotion to the Eredivisie on goal difference in the promotion play-offs in 1977–78, despite the 31 goals of Peter Houtman during the season. Groningen finished runners-up to Excelsior in 1978–79, but returned to the Eredivisie as champions in 1979–80 under coach Theo Verlangen [nl], losing only 4 times in 36 matches. Most of the squad came from Groningen's youth academy.\n\nIn 1982–83, Groningen qualified for European competition for the first time following a 5th-place position in the Eredivisie. Ronald Koeman left the club in 1983 and joined Ajax, while his brother Erwin remained at Groningen; both players had made their professional debut at Groningen. The team debuted in the 1983–84 UEFA Cup first round with an away match against Atlético Madrid—European Cup finalists in 1974—and lost 2–1. Groningen recorded a 3–0 victory in the return game and won 4–2 on aggregate. They faced Inter Milan in the second round; Groningen won 2–0 at their Oosterparkstadion but lost 5–1 in Italy and were eliminated from the competition. Groningen competed in European competition again on five occasions from 1986 until 1992, with a place in the third round in the 1986–87 UEFA Cup (eliminated by Vitória de Guimarães) and the 1988–89 UEFA Cup (eliminated by VfB Stuttgart) as their best results.\n\nAs a result of their successful spell, Groningen became almost fully professional during the mid-1980s—only Jan van Dijk and Adri van Tiggelen remained semi-professional—and the club recorded the fourth highest average home attendances in Dutch football—behind Ajax, PSV and Feyenoord—as it attracted at least 10,000 fans for each match. In 1989, Groningen reached their first KNVB Cup final but lost 4–1 against PSV. During the same year, Groningen chairman Renze de Vries [nl] was found guilty by the Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD) of embezzlement and using dirty money to lure players into signing for the club. De Vries, Groningen's chairman since 1980, stepped down and later spent several days in prison. Although several other clubs were also investigated and punished by the FIOD during this period, Groningen received an additional assessment of 700,000 Dutch guilders from the Tax and Customs Administration. The club was saddled with millions of debt and came close to bankruptcy.\n\nDespite the financial situation, Groningen recorded their highest-ever league finish in 1990–91—third place. Managed by Hans Westerhof, Groningen competed for the league title with Ajax and PSV until the last part of the season, when suspensions and injuries to first-team players saw the team drop points. Groningen's Henny Meijer was named Dutch Footballer of the Year after the season ended.\n\nAlthough Groningen recorded a 5th-place finish in 1991–92 and qualified for the 1992–93 UEFA Cup, the team began to slide down the league table; they were eventually relegated to the Eerste Divisie in 1997–98. Groningen had little financial resources left and made many managerial changes in a search for success. The side returned to the Eredivisie in 1999–2000 following a first-place finish in the promotion play-offs group. During the season, Groningen set several club records: they scored 81 goals, won 10 matches in a row and recorded their largest victory—10–1 against DVS '33 in the KNVB Cup. In December 2000, 16-year-old Arjen Robben made his professional debut under coach Jan van Dijk; Robben was soon sold to PSV for a fee of 3.9 million euros. Groningen avoided relegation in their first seasons back in the Eredivisie; under coach Ron Jans, appointed in 2002, Groningen began to return into the top half of the Eredivisie.\n\nIn January 2006, Groningen moved from the outdated Oosterparkstadion—the club's first home stadium—to the newly built Euroborg. The club's average home attendance increased from about 12,000 in the Oosterparkstadion to around 20,000 in its new stadium. The team went the first 15 league games unbeaten at Euroborg, and the stadium was soon nicknamed \"De Groene Hel\" (\"The Green Hell\"). At the end of the 2005–06 season, Groningen finished in fifth place and qualified for the play-offs which determined a place in the preliminary round of the UEFA Champions League. Groningen reached the final but lost against Ajax on aggregate in the last minutes of the second leg; the team qualified instead for the 2006–07 UEFA Cup in which they were eliminated by Partizan Belgrade in the preliminary round. Groningen again qualified for the UEFA Cup preliminary round the following season but were eliminated by Italian side Fiorentina after a penalty shootout. In 2010, Jans left the club and went to local rivals Heerenveen; his successor was former Groningen player Pieter Huistra.\n\nUnder Huistra, the team finished 5th in 2010–11 and reached the European competition play-off final; Groningen turned around a 5–1 deficit against ADO Den Haag but lost after a penalty shootout. In 2013–14, Groningen won the European competition play-off final under coach Erwin van de Looi and qualified for the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League, losing against Aberdeen in the second qualifying round. Groningen claimed their first major honour during the season, however, defeating PEC Zwolle 2–0 in the 2015 KNVB Cup final. The side became the third Groningen-based team to win a major honour, after Be Quick won the 1919–20 Dutch League Championship and Velocitas claimed the 1933–34 KNVB Cup. By winning the cup, Groningen qualified for the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League group stage, gaining only two points from six matches and finished the group in bottom place. In 2019, Hans Nijland [nl]—Groningen's CEO since 1996 and the longest-serving director in Dutch professional football—stepped down and was replaced by Excelsior's Wouter Gudde. In 2020, Arjen Robben came out of retirement and returned to Groningen as a player; Robben made seven appearances for the club before retiring again in 2021.\n\nIn 2022–23, Groningen finished the season in bottom place, winning only 4 times in 34 matches, and were relegated to the Eerste Divisie for the third time. Before the start of the season, the German Frank Wormuth was appointed coach. He was sacked in November 2022, after which Wormuth labelled the working conditions as \"mentally unsafe\". Under his successor, Dennis van der Ree, Groningen won only once in 21 matches, and were eliminated from the KNVB Cup at home by amateur club SV Spakenburg. During the season, director of football Mark-Jan Fledderus was sacked, and two board members stepped down. Gudde concluded the squad was unfit, unbalanced, and lacked quality and \"personality\". Under coach Dick Lukkien, Groningen finished runners-up the following season and were promoted back to the Eredivisie with a squad composed of many players who were recruited from Groningen's youth academy; the team defeated direct rivals Roda JC 2–0 on the last matchday to take second place from them."
