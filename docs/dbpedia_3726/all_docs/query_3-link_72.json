        "text": "Zwolle and Almere City square off against each other in the Eredivisie round 22 in what is expected to be a close encounter. Zwolle have been in a fine form of late, with the team beating both Vitesse and Sparta, while sharing the spoils with Go Ahead Eagles and it is no suprise the bookies see them as favourites to beat Almere on home soil. Even though Bram van Polen is banned for the match due to the accumulation of yellow cards, home win should be considered.\n\nThe visitors, on the other hand, did well to hold AZ Alkmaar to a goalless draw in their last league match. Almere City have collected 11 points in total on the road this term and, taking everything into account, the share of spoils is on the horizon. There are no fresh injury concerns in the visiting team.\n\nThis match will be played on 17/02/2024 at 21:00\n\nFounded on June 12, 1910, PEC Zwolle is a Dutch football club which competes in the Eredivisie. Zwolle have yet to win the national championship, but they did remarkably well to lift the Dutch Cup trophy in 2014. Ron Jans’s troops impressed in the title game, with the team rolling over Dutch giants Ajax 5-1.\n\nThe Blauwingers play their home games at MACPARK Stadion, the venue with the capacity of 14,000 people. The multi-use stadium was opened on August 29, 2009. Zwolle’s home kit is blue and white, while the colour of their away jersey is green and white. In the 2014/15 season the Blauwingers represented the Netherlands in the Europa League, with the team losing to Sparta Prague in the play-off round.\n\nThe likes of Henk Timmer (237), Johan Hansma (231), Bert Konterman (219), Arne Slot (208), and Jasper Drost (182) are the players with the most league appearances for the club. Go Ahead Eagles are considered the club’s biggest rivals as both teams are located at the river Ijssel."
