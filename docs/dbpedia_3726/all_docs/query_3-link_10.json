        "text": "View attachment 19192\n\nI've decided to give managing in Holland to try and bring back a country with a history of beautiful underachievers; lets not forget Cruyff's total football of 1974 or the late golden generation of the 90's, Berkamp, Davids etc. Yet this nation that produced great footballers time after time had only1 title to call their own, the 1988 European championship and they have failed to qualify for the last Euro and World Cup. Holland is a faded footballing titan and its time to bring it back to former glories.\n\nFootball Club Twente are a professional club from the city of Enschede, a city located in Eastern Netherlands. The club were formed in 1965 and play their home games in the De Grolsch Veste also known as The Grolsch Fortress.\n\n​\n\nTwente’s stadium, De Grolsch Veste, has a capacity of 30,000 people and is named after the alcoholic beverage Grolsch who’s headquarters are located in Enschede. FC Twente have only ever won the Eredivisie title once back in the 2009 – 2010 season when former England manager Steve McClaren lead them to glory by just a single point over Ajax.\n\nNotable former players for FC Twente include ex-Spurs winger Nacer Chadli, who won the KNVB Cup in his first year with the club, the late great Cheick Tiote who went on to make 52 appearances for the Ivorian National team before his death in 2017 and also Dutch national team player Eljero Elia who spent a couple of years at the club before moving to Hamburg and then to Juventus back in 2011.\n\n​\n\nDuring the 2014–15 Eredivisie season, Twente found themselves in financial trouble again, forcing the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB) to deduct the club three points from the side in March 2015. Club President Munsterman, who had announced to leave the club at the end of the season, then already quit the club on 1 April 2015 over allegations of financial mismanagement. The team fired 18 employees and stopped with their scouting department after they received a second three-point penalty in April 2015. They also decided to withdraw Jong Twente from the Eerste Divisie for the 2015–16 season and the women's professional team was relocated in a separate foundation. On 18 May 2016 the KNVB declared its intent to relegate FC Twente to the Eerste Divisie. This was however still subject to appeal by FC Twente and on 17 June 2016 the KNVB appeal committee decided that Twente can remain in the Eredivisie. At the end of the 2017–18 Eredivisie season, Twente relegated to the Eerste Divise by finishing at the bottom of the table at the end of the season, after having fired two managers that season.\n\nFinances\n\nSo to make this save even harder the clubs finances are in no great shape and it will take a few seasons to be able to make any real signings unless we get a ridiculous offer for somebody. the transfer and wage budget little to be desired as well and there will be no real signings to made this year.\n\n​\n\nView attachment 19197\n\nBoard Expectations\n\n​\n\nView attachment 19195\n\nLuckily we aren't expected to win the league and only reach the play offs as the second string teams for PSV and Ajax are both favourites for the league and will be tough to beat depending on who gets dropped down for those games.\n\nThe aim of this save is going to be to try and get Twente back to where they were 10 years ago with using youth to try and get them all into the Dutch team and to get them back on top as well. Whenever the Dutch job comes up I will keep trying for it until I get it to try and win a major honour with them.\n\n​\n\nSquad Overview\n\nGoalkeepers\n\nView attachment 19185\n\nIn goals Joel Drommel will be my number 1 and at only 21 he should be with the club for a while even if he becomes number 2 after a couple of years.\n\nDefenders\n\nView attachment 19184\n\nIn defence we are ok with Gonzalez being our strongest CB. We will need to strengthen over the next few years though to compete. Van de Lely will be staying with us as the leading RB with Ramos being the understudy. At LB we are very short with only 33 year old Ricardinho coming in during the summer. We will be looking to the loan market at first to bring in some cover.\n\nMidfielders\n\nView attachment 19183\n\nIn the middle of the park Javi Espinosa will be key for us playing as a play maker to link up with the strikers and create chances for them with Wout Brama playing just behind him to soak up any loose balls and to help out with the defence. Down the right Aitor Cantalapiedra will be key with Dylan George as his back up. Down the left we will be utilising Zekhnini until Assaidi comes back from his injury in 6-7 months.\n\nStrikers\n\nView attachment 19182\n\nUp front we are lacking with Tom Boere being our best option. I will be looking at the loan market to try and bring in 1 or two strikers to take over.\n\nAll in we have a pretty good squad and should make the playoffs comfortably in our first season and I will be hoping for promotion. I will be looking at the loan market to bring people in as I just don't have the wages to sign anybody permanently yet.\n\nMy tactics will all depend on who we're able to attract over the transfer window​\n\nTransfers and Preseason\n\nSo for the transfers we've had to be very smart as its been very difficult due to having no money for wages. With this in mind I used the transfer budget to pad it out to try and bring some players in for free but nobody decent was wanting to join so we looked to the loan market. The issue with this again came down to the wage budget and not being able to offer the wage contribution the clubs were wanting. So with this in mind every player we have bought in on loan is having 100% of their wages paid by their respective clubs.\n\nView attachment 19098\n\nThe main players to have been brought in are Timothy Weah and Sergio Cordova who will both be spear heading our front line and fire us to promotion. The other notable player is Erik Majetschak who will be adding great rotation option in the centre of the park and is also available to play in the AMC role. Everybody else joining the club is merely in to provide backup to both the full back positions and striker.\n\nTom Boere was the only one to leave the club and was going to be 4th choice so he leaves for £575,000 and that was too good to reject for somebody not to play especially in our financial situation.\n\nOver the course of the season I'll be looking at the transfer list to see if anybody becomes available in our price range or if anybody decent gets released from their club\n\nTactics\n\nView attachment 19097\n\nWe'll be looking to play as a 4-4-2 to give us options going forward and hopefully staying defensively solid as well. With the squad we have I feel this utilises everybody's skills the best.\n\nPreseason\n\nView attachment 19096\n\nWith new players coming in I decided to try and play plenty of friendlies to get everybody use to the formation and try and get as many players fit as well. A disappointing defeat to Arminia Bielefeld was put right with the last game with a massive confidence boosting win over Schalke 04.\n\nOnwards and upwards now as we take our fight to the league.\n\n​\n\nAugust\n\nView attachment 19094\n\nA nice short month since we only had to play half of it with competitive games and we got off to a great start against Sparta and Helmond. Then Came the match against Roda JC.\n\nThen came the match against Roda which with only my third game has reminded me how this game can make you think its a walk in the park and then gives you a fright.\n\nView attachment 19093\n\nErik Majetschak comes in for his debut and gets us off to a great start getting a debut goal. Timothy Weah then scored either side of half time to give us a 3-0 lead. At this stage I think its all over and then Cristian Gonzalez manages to header the ball into his own net from a corner before Simakala bangs a second in for Roda JC with 16 minutes to go. We get battered for the remaining time but manage to hold on to take the 3 points and record a perfect month.\n\nView attachment 19092\n\nThe draw for the Dutch cup has also taken place where we will meet Almere City at home which should be pretty straight forward and we should make it through to the second round.\n\nView attachment 19090\n\n​\n\nSeptember\n\nTo start the month I'd thought I'd try my luck with a couple of board requests to see what happened, especially with the limited bank balance I wasn't sure what they would agree to and it couldn't of gone any better. They have agreed to upgrade the youth recruitment and facilities which I plan of making full use of during this save to get my team to the top.\n\nView attachment 19088\n\nView attachment 19087View attachment 19086\n\nWe really manage to pull off the perfect month here in the league as not only do we manage to win every match but we go one better and manage to keep clean sheets in every game. Our defence have finally come together and working as an established unit. The only worry just now is the strikers just aren't getting in the goals and most of them are coming from midfield.\n\nFor the cup we had a walk in the park and managed to progress with a great win\n\nView attachment 19085\n\nAgain we looked like we could of thrown this away after being 2-0 up after 9 minutes but thankfully with 20 minute to go we managed to bag another 3 goals to take a comanding lead to see us into the second round where we will come up against FC Utrecht\n\nView attachment 19083\n\nView attachment 19084​\n\nOctober\n\nView attachment 19002\n\nThe big match of the month was the cup game against FC Utecht which came after playing against their second team which somehow went better this time around against the stronger team but it sees us progress to the third round to play Heracles Almelo away from home which gives us our first taste f the Twentse Derby.\n\nIn the league we played relatively well but drop our first points of the season. Again our strikers are still struggling to finding the back of the net.\n\nView attachment 18997\n\nSo along came Jong Utrecht and I honestly thought we were going to get hammered after going 2-0 down in 12 minutes thanks to Nick Venema but we managed to keep the score line there until half time. At half time I tore through the lads and we got an instant response with Cordova finally getting on the score sheet to get his first goal of the season. We then get some luck when Lukas Gortler deflects a shot into his own net. We then get a penalty and I think the full comeback is there but our left back Ricardinho puts it wide and we have to settle for a 2-2 draw.\n\nWe manage to hold onto top spot in the league as well with holding a 3 point lead and a game advantage.\n\nView attachment 18989\n\nAs you can see we have already achieved a play off spot as well after 10 games. Its all a bit strange but it seems the league is done in 4 periods with teams achieving play off spots each period.\n\nView attachment 18985\n\nNovember fixtures\n\nView attachment 18999​\n\nDecember\n\nView attachment 18676\n\nAnother month we go undefeated as we increase our standing in the league with only dropping 2 points against FC Volendam. In the Dutch cup we even manage to beat our local rivals after an extremely boring game with no team creating any great chances we manage to nab it in penalties to make it through to the quarter finals where we will be playing AZ Alkmarr away from home.\n\nThe big match this month was at home to second placed Go Ahead.\n\nView attachment 18674\n\nTimoth Weah gets the opening goal to see us off after getting a yellow card and then Ricardinho getting a vital penalty in the third minute of extra time in the first half to send us in with a great confidence boost. Sergio Cordova then adds to the score sheet to boost his confidence in front of goal before Ricardinho gets his marching orders for a soft tackle just outside the box. Jeroen Veldmate steps up to the free kick and slots it home to get a consolation goal.\n\nView attachment 18673\n\nWe go into January with a 9 point lead at the top of the table and will be looking at the loan market and contracts that are expiring in the summer to see who we can get that will help us stay up next season.\n\nJanuary Fixtures\n\nView attachment 18672​\n\nJanuary\n\nView attachment 18639\n\nIn the league we remain unbeaten with another 9 points taken. In the cup we finally bow out in the quarter finals. Az were just far too good and the gulf of class showed as we threw away a 1-0 lead to lose 3-1.\n\nView attachment 18638\n\nJong Utrecht was the stand out game this month with Haji Wright getting us off to a great start with a goal in the second minute to get us off to the best possible start. Cristian Gonzalez then manages to bag a brace just before half time. Yangel Herrera then slots home from the penalty spot in the second minute of injury time to get himself a debut goal.\n\nView attachment 18637\n\nWith transfers we were pretty much beaten to every pre-contract due to not being able to offer wages to compete with everybody else. The only player we managed to sign on a pre-contract was Abdou Diakhate from Fiorentina. We even took the chance to sign him now for £215,000 as he will be a great addition in the middle of the park just now.\n\nView attachment 18635\n\nThe other player we managed to sign on a permanent deal was Javi Jimenez from Valencia for £1,100,000 and he will go straight into the first team as CB.\n\nView attachment 18634\n\nThe other transfers we made were loan deals to try and fill out the team to give us the best opportunity to complete an unbeaten season to allow us plenty of rotation if its needed.\n\nView attachment 18636\n\nFebruary Fixtures\n\nView attachment 18633​"
