My first post will take us up to the end of Maurice Steijn's reign, comparing my results on the pitch against the performances of Steijn's Ajax.\n\nThe beauty of FM24 is that the Eredivisie is a licensed league, and therefore the fixtures are aligned to those played IRL, making the game against FC Utrecht on 22 October 2023 the perfect place to review our performances.\n\nIf you have somehow missed out on all the action regarding AFC Ajax IRL, my previous post 'Setting the scene' is a perfect place to start before reading this blog.\n\nThere are 13 games which will be documented in granular detail in this post, this will provide you with an insight into how I play the game, make tactical decisions, and perform analysis.\n\nI am highly unlikely to cover matches in as much detail throughout my series 'The Ajax way' and therefore this post will help to provide you with the all important insight.\n\nAUGUST 2023\n\nAFC Ajax vs Heracles Almelo\n\nThe first competitive fixture of my reign as AFC Ajax manager, sees me face off against John Lammers newly-promoted Heracles Almelo, a side from Almelo, a municipality and a city in the eastern Netherlands, which is situated 92 miles east of Amsterdam.\n\nLammers side are predicted to finish the Eredivisie in 13th place, and find themselves 350-1 outsiders, compared to our 2-1 odds as Eredivisie favourites.\n\nLammers side have played their previous seven matches in the 4-3-3 shape and four of a total 11 goals scored across their pre-season stemmed from deep positions.\n\nKnowing that Lammers will likely field his favoured 4-3-3 for the entirety of the match, I am opting to start the game playing in our 3-3-3-1 shape, with the view to creating central overloads, forcing the opponent to play long and into our hands when you take into account the first-touch weakness below.\n\nAnalyst reports are a great place to pick up on any trends.\n\nThe team are effective at playing through balls, and Lammers side will be looking to punish us through any dead ball situation, as they possess a number of players who can take a long throw, and also individuals who will pose a threat from corners.\n\nIn order to ensure we have enough height on the field of play to negate the potential threat, I have opted to play a back three of Hato (6'2), Šutalo (6'3), and Medić (6'4). Along with deploying Tahirović (6'4) in the DM strata for additional cover in transition.\n\nLammers squad are weak with regards to their first-touch and anticipation. Without the ball we have pressing set to 'more often' which will hopefully see us force individuals into giving the ball away, along with looking to exploit them with our total football, playing the Ajax way.\n\nScout reports again hold significant value, these staff members aren't simply employed for recruitment purposes.\n\n*Note clicking on the below image will provide you with the match statistics and supporting visuals, provided in the Statman24 skin.\n\nTwo early goals set the tone for the day, in a match in which we amassed a whopping 4.11 non-penalty expected goals. This equated to 0.20xG per shot, showing the frequency in which we were able to create shots of high goal scoring chance.\n\nWe also finished the game seeing 79% possession, and 72% ball share. Whilst completing 607 passes in total, with the majority of key passes coming from central areas and the all important zone 14.\n\nOur dominance on the ball showed as we made 141 passes in the final third, compared to our opponents 31. As predicted Heracles Almelo played a high percentage of long balls, with 42% of their total passes completed being either medium or long.\n\nOur pressing intensity paid dividends, we had a PPDA of 2.19 compared to our opponents 5.45\n\nJakov Medić played a key role in negating the oppositions aerial threat, he won nine aerial duels, two of which were key headers.\n\nMOTM: Branco van den Boomen\n\n93% pass accuracy (89/96)\n\n7 progressive passes\n\n2 open play key passes\n\n1 goal\n\nSteijn Watch\n\nExcelsior vs AFC Ajax\n\nMarinus Dijkhuizen's side were up next, the team from Rotterdam had kicked off their season with a 0-0 draw away at N.E.C. Nijmegen. Excelsior on paper are a weaker side than our first opponents, and have been predicted to be one of three sides which are media favourites for the drop, Almere City and FC Volendam the other two.\n\nAgain, a similar approach will be made with regards to selection decisions, as 66% of assists have stemmed from either a throw-in or long ball.\n\nGiven Marinus' preferred tactical style is 'Wing Play' I am conscious that playing in the 3-3-3-1 can leave us susceptible to attacks down the flanks. Again, FM's AI is well aligned with the manager profile, as reflected in Excelsior's key passes from their opening match. Therefore, I have given both carrilero's in midfield the added player instruction of 'tackle harder', with the view to breaking down play on transition. If after 15 minutes of play I feel worried of the threat, I will play the 4-2-3-1 which should provide the additional cover, whilst still occupying their DM with the AM strata covered by our shadow striker.\n\nAn all important win on the road, in another fixture which saw us maintain our strong momentum. An early injury to Benjamin Tahirović (tight hamstring) saw us shift formation, handing Borna Sosa his debut. A change which didn't impact the flow of the game, as we were extremely dominant in the second half.\n\nLooking at the difference in average positioning when in possession, you can see how the change to the 4-2-3-1 affects our shape. We are more compact playing with four at the back, players find themselves closer together offering more protection if the ball is lost. Whilst the 3-3-3-1 utilises space more effectively, creating bigger voids between the opposition to exploit, it is also more focused on central overloads.\n\nTaking an early look at Josip Šutalo in the role of the Libero, you can see how important the role is in terms of both ball progression and switching play. Josip played an excellent game, racking up three key passes in a match in which he completed the second highest passes.\n\nMOTM: Josip Šutalo\n\n94% pass completion\n\nthree key passes\n\n100% headers won (7/7)\n\nSteijn Watch\n\nLugano vs AFC Ajax\n\nDomestic action takes the back seat for the next two fixtures, we face Lugano from Switzerland in the UEFA Europa League Playoffs, knowing that qualification is essential for the team in terms of sustainability. The additional revenue (£540k per victory) paired with the additional gate receipts for securing a spot in the continent's second tier competition places added pressure on the management team.\n\nThe first-leg is away from home, against an in-form side who find themselves in first place of the Suisse Super League. Lugano have finished in the top four of the Swiss league over the past three seasons and lifted the Schweizer Cup in 2022.\n\nTaking my time to study the scout and analyst reports one point has stood out to me, they have conceded 60% of their goals from balls down their left-side. This is likely to be due to how they line-up with Uran Bislimi as the Volante, leaving the side exposed in transition. We will look to exploit this by playing our 4-3-3 shape in this fixture, looking for Branco van den Boomen in the role of the advanced playmaker to stay wider, with the view to stretch the game in this area of the pitch and hopefully have an impact in transition.\n\nIn a match showcasing a clash of styles, the controlled possession of Steinkelsson's Ajax overcame a Lugano team favouring a gegenpress system.\n\nThe assist provided by Branco van den Boomen in setting up Steven Bergwijn's goal was exactly what I had in mind when setting up the team to face our opponent, a progressive pass from deep after a turnover, down the opponent's left-side, setting up a goal scoring chance.\n\nSivert Mannsverk was also nearly another benefactor of a similar play in the 68th minute, scuffing his shot wide of the post (0.26xG).\n\nMOTM: Steven Bergwijn\n\n100% shots on target (2/2)\n\n87% pass completion\n\n1 assist\n\n1 goal\n\n3 tackles made\n\nAFC Ajax vs Lugano\n\nPlaying at the Johan Cruyff Arena, paired with a two goal buffer, enables me to think about providing a few peripheral players with some game time.\n\nA first leg win proved a successful foundation for Ajax, who secured a 6-2 aggregate victory over Lugano. The second leg clash produced our second highest xG per shot performance of the season (0.19 xG).\n\nKudos to Kristian Nökkvi Hlynsson for providing the assist for Georges Mikautadze's brace. The Georgian put in his best performance in an Ajax shirt, completing 97% of his passes, and working the opposition's keeper with three of his four shots.\n\nMOTM: Borna Sosa\n\n1 goal\n\n1 assist\n\n5 key passes\n\nSEPTEMBER 2023\n\nUEFA Europa League Draw\n\nThe draw was made for the UEFA Europa League, we have an exceptionally tough group, seeing us drawn against Freiburg who closed the 2022/23 Bundesliga in 5th place, as well as re-uniting us with the likes of Mohammed Kudus, and Edson Álvarez of West Ham. The final team in the group is FK TSC Bačka Topola, who finished runners-up in the Serbian Mozzart Bet Super liga.\n\nFortuna Sittard vs AFC Ajax\n\nWith only two days rest after the Lugano game, we travelled to Sittard to play Danny Buijs Fortuna. A side which finds themselves in 11th place of the Eredivisie, suffering defeats against both Feyenoord (0-3), and Excelsior (0-2). Buijs side prefers to line-up in the 4-2-3-1 formation, favouring wing-play.\n\nWith dribbling and flair listed as two of their strengths, I am expecting Iñigo Córdoba and Tijjani Noslin to provide threats down the flanks, so we will line up playing our 4-3-3 shape in today's game.\n\nSteven Bergwijn couldn't fully recover in time or the game, providing Amourricho van Axel Dongen with the opportunity to start the match.\n\nLooking at the post game analysis, we struggled to penetrate Fortuna's 18-yard box, with Sadik Fofana a defender deployed in the DM strata, having an exceptional game, as displayed in his defensive actions visual.\n\nWe finished the game in second place with regards to the following statistics., again showing our inability with regards to chance creation. The post game match report sums up the performance exceptionally well;\n\nIn a low key affair, the fixture was marred by a succession of fouls by Fortuna Sittard that prevented the match from ever truly getting into a rhythm. Ajax had the better of the possession but often wasted it with too many wayward shots from long range.\n\nMOTM: Diant Ramaj\n\n6 saves\n\n5 saves from inside the box\n\n1.32 xG prevented\n\nFC Twente vs AFC Ajax\n\nNext up are FC Twente managed by Joseph Oosting, who likes to play a fluid counter-attack style of play. Their pressing intensity visual, is a great example of how they base their game on drawing the opposition forward, to leave them vulnerable on the break.\n\nAfter spending a little time in the 'Data Hub' I also found that FC Twente holds the best conversion rate in the Eredivisie to date (23%). Therefore, I will be looking to play some of our fastest players in the defensive line to ensure we can get men behind the ball, making those effective counters less of a threat.\n\nThe players on the pitch were a sight to behold in the passing department, making a total of 562 passes. Josip Šutalo was the heart of everything good, exchanging a total of 179 passes with his team-mates.\n\nThis result felt like the players were grasping to play 'the Ajax way', we had 68% possession and amassed 16 key passes. The football played was pure champagne, I think that Cruijff would have been proud.\n\nThe standout performer was Kenneth Taylor, the 21-year-old put in a superb performance for Ajax, and will no doubt be delighted with his match ball performance. The first player of my reign to score a perfect 10 match rating.\n\nMOTM: Kenneth Taylor\n\nHat-trick\n\n95% pass completion (79/83)\n\n10 progressive passes\n\n3 key passes\n\n1 assist\n\nAFC Ajax vs Freiburg\n\nOur opening game in the UEFA Europa League is at home against Freiburg, Christian Streich's men find themselves in 10th place in the Bundesliga, and have had a mixed start to their campaign.\n\nThere will be no changes from the victory over FC Twente, if it ain't broke, don't try to fix it!\n\nDespite the final result, the performance on the pitch leaves enough optimism that we can secure a victory away in Germany. We maintained stronger momentum when looking at the match overall, and were significantly dominant after Maximilian Eggestein opened the scoring.\n\nOne slight concern is that seven players have featured in over 400 minutes of competitive football (maximum playable 630), and their conditions are starting to decline faster in-match.\n\nMOTM: Lucas Höler\n\n2 key passes\n\n1 assist\n\nAFC Ajax vs Feyenoord - De Klassieker\n\nArne Slot's Feyenoord are the in-form team in the Eredivisie, boasting a 100% record, and holding a superior goal difference. In fact, the side from Rotterdam have only conceded in one game this season, and have won all but one game by more than a three goal margin.\n\nThe origins of \"De Klassieker\" can be traced back to the early 20th century when both Ajax and Feyenoord were established as prominent football clubs in the Netherlands. The rivalry's foundation is rooted in the geographical, cultural, and social differences between the two cities that these clubs represent – Amsterdam and Rotterdam.\n\nAmsterdam, the capital city, and Rotterdam, a major port city, have long held distinct identities, and the football rivalry between Ajax and Feyenoord became a reflection of this regional pride and competition. The first official league match between the two clubs took place on October 9, 1921, setting the stage for what would become one of the most iconic rivalries in Dutch football.\n\nOver the years, as both Ajax and Feyenoord achieved success and dominance in Dutch football, the intensity of the rivalry grew. The clubs' clashes began to carry not only the weight of regional pride but also the aspirations for national football supremacy. This historical context, combined with the passionate fan bases and the high-stakes nature of their encounters, solidified \"De Klassieker\" as a fixture that transcends the sport, becoming a significant part of the cultural and sporting heritage in the Netherlands.\n\nRegarding formation, we were again heavily influenced by our scout report.\n\nThe defeat must have been hard for Arne Slot to swallow. I am looking forward to seeing how these types of rivalries pan out across the duration of the save. I am a firm believer in the need to have a strong consistent competitor, to ensure that we stay strong.\n\nMomentum was always with us as the home side, the result was something which I was not expecting, well not as convincing, it could have been five if Branco van den Boomen scored his penalty in the minute.\n\nFeyenoord will be frustrated with their inability to even work Jay Gorter between the posts in the Ajax goal.\n\nLooking at the following stats, it is clear to see how effective we were in this fixture;\n\n7 shots on target vs ZERO shots on target\n\n5 clear cut chances vs ZERO clear cut chances\n\n2.74 NPxG vs 0.75 NPxG\n\n70% headers won (23/33) vs 23% headers won (8/35)\n\nMOTM: Jorrel Hato\n\n99% pass accuracy (78/79)\n\n67% aerial duels won (4/6)\n\n1 goal\n\n1 assist\n\nAFC Ajax vs FC Volendam\n\nThe next two games see us play against opposition from the foot of the Eredivisie, FC Volendam are currently in 15th place, whilst RKC Waalwijk are in 17th place, and without a victory.\n\nMatthias Kohler's men have only secured the single victory, away at Go ahead Eagles (currently in 6th place). They have secured five points in their last five Eredivisie games, a perfect opportunity to introduce some fresh blood into the starting eleven, given we are at home.\n\nA strike from Amourricho van Axel Dongen helped send Ajax to the top of the Eredivisie after a 1-0 Noord-Hollandse derby victory over rivals FC Volendam.\n\nThe score-line could have been greater with Ar'jany Martha and Georges Mikautadze both having efforts chalked off for marginal offsides. We picked up a monstrous 74% possession in the game and completed a whopping 93% of passes attempted, making for a very busy pass map. I am sure you will appreciate that again we have shown our quality at creating chances from central areas, Branco van den Boomen currently has our highest open play key passes (9), although he is still a country-mile away from first placed Sven Mijnans of AZ (15).\n\nMOTM: Ar'jany Martha\n\n91% pass completion (57/62)\n\n3 key passes\n\n5 dribbles\n\n100% tackles made (2/2)\n\nRKC Waalwijk vs AFC Ajax\n\nWith only a three day gap between our last fixture and the match away in Waalwijk, there would be minimal time for tinkering. With a European clash against West Ham on the horizon, players such as Martha, van Axel Dongen, and Salah-Eddine kept their places in the starting eleven. Gabriël Misehouy was also given a starting berth, with the view to keeping Branco van den Boomen fresh.\n\nReading into the scout report, RKC Waalwijk are most effective from the set piece, averaging a xA of 0.11 from 7.2 set pieces per game, which is the 6th best across the division. Given our aerial dominance, performing above average in terms of headers attempted and headers won ratio, I'd like to think we can handle whatever Waalwijk sends our way.\n\nThe result has seen us notch up four straight league wins, again we dominated our opposition on the field, Benjamin Tahirović in the half-back role acted as the metronome, completing 78 passes, and linking up with a total of 13 players.\n\nAgain we were able to impressively restrict our opponent from taking just the four touches in our penalty area, across the duration of the game.\n\nMOTM: Jakov Medić\n\n94% pass accuracy (34/36)\n\n100% tackles made (2/2)\n\n67% aerial duels won (2/3)\n\n1 goal\n\nOCTOBER 2023\n\nWest Ham vs AFC Ajax\n\nWe travelled to England to play West Ham, who find themselves in 16th place in the Premier League. Whilst on paper it looks as if David Moyes team are having a bit of a 'mare, their opening five fixtures have come against Chelsea, Aston Villa, Liverpool, Arsenal, and Manchester United. In which they picked up three points against Aston Villa and drew with Chelsea.\n\nOn paper, we got an absolute stuffing. However, looking at the fine print you will see that West Ham scored three goals in a three minute period. Both of these stemmed from errors by Jorrel Hato who played sloppy balls out from the back, which West Ham capitalised from.\n\nThe other two goals scored by Kurt Zouma, stemmed from the set piece, notably James Ward-Prowse's precision delivery.\n\nThis game is a prime example of possession isn't everything, as West Ham only saw 31% of the ball, and only made 40 final third passes, compared to our 115.\n\nMOTM: Kurt Zouma\n\n2 goals\n\n100% tackles won (1/1)\n\n100% aerial duels won (9/9)\n\n5 interceptions\n\nAFC Ajax vs AZ\n\nPascal Jansen's team have had a mixed start to the season, they failed to win any of their opening four Eredivisie games (3D, 1L), and have now hit a run of form, winning their last three games.\n\nWe are keen to bounce back after defeat on the road, and have selected the strongest starting 11 minus Steven Berghuis and Brian Brobbey, both who are nursing minor knocks from midweek.\n\nWe have lost back to back games for the first time of my reign. Looking at the underlying numbers, it is hard to swallow, given we had the better NPxG 2.02 plays 1.02 and also hit the woodwork twice (Carlos Borges, and Georges Mikautadze), on another day we would have been walking away with all three points.\n\nLooking at the analyst's report in the Data Hub, with regards to conceding, we have conceded all but one goal from inside our box (expected), and there is a fairly even spread in terms of where the assists are coming from.\n\nWhilst I enjoy looking through the data, there is no real need to dig too deep just yet as the defensive efficiency visualisation shows how effective the defensive unit was in nullifying our opponents threat.\n\nMOTM: David Møller Wolfe\n\nFC Utrecht vs AFC Ajax\n\nThe final game of this blog comes against FC Utrecht at the Stadion Galgenwaard. Ron Jans's team are well established in the Eredivisie, finishing in the top 11 places for the last 20 years. In game they are currently in eighth place and rely heavily on crossing, within the top five for crosses attempted, yet have the lowest completion rate, along with us. (crossing is integrated in our game model, maybe I should opt to play at least one winger as an inverted winger, to try and reduce this given the 'cross more often' PI attached to a winger on support).\n\nWhilst evidently we have played significantly better than under Maurice Steijn, I do feel the Dutchman was dealt a poor hand from Sven Mislintat as the squad isn't balanced in terms of depth, with too much focus on bringing in players with 'unproven' potential. Especially given the quality of player that went out the door, I feel his strategy could have been a little more refined.\n\nAfter conceding two early goals, I thought we were well on our way to losing three games on the bounce. Fortunately for us, Steven Bergwijn put in a real captain's performance to drag us out of the muck.\n\nKristian Nökkvi Hlynsson also deserves a mention, the youngster from Iceland was brought on in place of Sosa at the break after switching back into the 3-3-3-1 formation. Whilst I have been enjoying the 'Project 4-3-3' formation, I can't seem to get the left-sided wing back firing and our central overloads aren't effective due to having two players holding width on the left-flank.\n\nMOTM: Steven Bergwijn\n\n77% pass completion (44/57)\n\n100% tackles won (5/5)\n\n8 dribbles completed\n\n3 key passes\n\n2 assists\n\nWe close this blog in third place of the Eredivisie, two points off early leaders Feyenoord, with PSV the only side in the division to not suffer a defeat. Both teams showing their right to play in the UEFA Champions League.\n\nComparing our actual performance against the expected points table, we find ourselves positioned exactly where our performances merit. FC Volendam are the least fortunate side in the Eredivisie, picking up seven less points than their performances have deserved. PSV are the toughest opponent to breakdown, they have a xGA of 6.3, whilst Heracles Almelo are the most open with an xGA of 20.\n\nWith regards to scoring, it should come as no surprise that Feyenoord have the best xG in the division at 26.3, whilst NEC Nijmegen are the polar opposite, only accumulating 6.5 xG from their opening nine games.\n\nThe above rolling NPxG visual shows just how effective we have been in our opening nine games, with Fortuna Sittard the only side to create more NPxG than ourselves. Looking at the granularity, we are currently averaging an NPxG per shot of 0.16, the work ball into box team instruction is working exceptionally well.\n\nWith regards to playing football 'the Ajax way' we find ourselves ranked second for average possession (63%), chances created (60), and conversion rate (19%). This is having a positive impact on how the supporters view my management.\n\nThe below shows some of the key individual performers from the first few months in charge, whilst he doesn't feature on the list, I would like to bring the performances of Branco van den Boomen to your attention.\n\nThe 28-year-old has played the third highest amount of minutes (802), with only Josip Šutalo (847) and Kenneth Taylor (848) securing more playing time. He is showing his ability to play as a highly creative outlet for the side from open play, whilst also playing a key role in ball progression. I can see why over the past few years a few individuals have made reference to Branco, and hold his skillset of the highest regard.\n\nAnyway, that's enough waffling on from me, as stated at the beginning of the blog, I will not be covering every match in as much detail going forward, or else the save will be moving at such a pace that I will be worried that I won't be able to document the youth development side in the detail desired.\n\nI will likely cover updates now on a bi annual cycle, looking at our performances at the mid-season point and then again at the close of the campaign. This will allow me to hopefully write about different aspects of the game which I have been focusing on across the duration.\n\nI hope you all have enjoyed this 4,000+ word extravaganza, as much as I have done playing\n\nBuilding on from the Ajax way DNA blog, which focused on how DNA can be used to drive talent identification at AFC Ajax. I wanted to document how I will use the DNA score to create player pathways, ensuring that I apply a consistent approach to providing talent with the same opportunities.\n\nPLAYER PATHWAYS IN FOOTBALL\n\nTHE ROLE OF A PATHWAY\n\nIn the intricate tapestry of English football, pathways emerge as not just a vital thread but a dynamic force, echoing the wisdom that Rome's grandeur was not erected in a mere day. These pathways transcend mere routes; they are the lifelines that guide young players through the labyrinth of development, infusing them with not just direction but an unwavering motivation to sculpt their own destiny. A shining exemplar of this football alchemy is the legendary \"Class of 92,\" a masterpiece sculpted by the visionary Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United—a testament to the club's artistry in cultivating talent that blossomed into triumphant success within the first team.\n\nPathways, akin to artistry, assume myriad forms, whether through a carefully orchestrated ballet of loan moves or an enchanting pas de deux in first-team training sessions. Each step is a brushstroke, painting the canvas of a player's journey with experiences that shimmer like the finest strokes of a masterpiece. These meticulously laid-out avenues not only offer fledgling players the chance to dance with destiny but also provide a front-row seat to the symphony of the professional game, fostering the hope that they will one day command the grand stage of the first team.\n\nTHE CHALLENGES\n\nWhile academies and pathways play a crucial role in player development, there are also challenges associated with their implementation. One of the most significant challenges is ensuring that there is a clear pathway from the academy to the first team. This can be difficult, as first-team managers often have a short-term focus on results and may be hesitant to give young players a chance.\n\nAnother challenge is ensuring that young players receive a well-rounded education and are prepared for life beyond football. This can be particularly challenging for players who leave school early to pursue a career in football, as they may miss out on important life skills and experiences.\n\nPLAYER PATHWAYS IN FOOTBALL MANAGER\n\nTHE PROCESS\n\nGiven that player development in my save 'The Ajax way' will be driven by the individual's performance against DNA, it made sense for me to set KPI's at given points in a player's development to ensure that we have a consistent approach.\n\nFor those of you who are science heads, you will know the importance a constant plays in any experiment, a constant variable does not change throughout the course of the experiment, enabling conclusions to be understandable.\n\nIf I were to provide variable pathways into the first team, how would I be able to judge the impacts fairly, different players would have experienced different journeys, which would not help me to understand what factors impact progress and ones which do not.\n\nTHE AJAX WAY\n\nThe below will walk you through the different stages of the Ajax way player pathway, covering any specific actions which I apply at each given stage.\n\nIt is important to remember that I have refined my Jong Ajax side to conform with the Ajax way, in which youth sides are made up with 16 players, the squad is as follows.\n\n2 – Goalkeepers (Sten Kremers and Charlie Setford)\n\n4 – Right footed players for positions 2,6 and 7. (Olivier Aertssen, Gabriël Misehouy, Amourricho van Axel Dongen, and Alvaro Henry\n\n4 – Left footed players for positions 5,8 and 11. (Ethan Butera, Rico Speksnijder, Ar'jany Martha, and David Kalokoh)\n\n3 – Players for positions 3 and 4. (Ahmetcan Kaplan, Oualid Agougil, and Avery Appiah\n\n3 – Players for positions 9 and 10. (Skye Vink, Yoram Boerhout, and Jaydon Banel)\n\n140 DNA POINTS - JONG AJAX REGULAR\n\nAt 140 DNA points this is where the fun begins, for those of you who play FM simply for the matches, this approach will not be for you. For others, who enjoy taking control of a club, with the view to maximising talent and fully submerging yourself into the role, strap yourselves in!\n\nThere are two things which I like to control when players secure enough DNA points to be considered a Jong Ajax regular.\n\nTake control of a player's individual training - with this I mean selecting what positional training the individual will participate in. Position training enables a player to become more familiar with any playing position that is not natural to him, thus improving his performances when playing in that position. However, at this time I will not be looking to train the player in the role which I think he is best in, I will simply select the role which has a wider attribute spread, helping to form a well rounded player. At this stage think more, Ball Playing Defender, Central Midfielder, Winger, and Deep-Lying Forward, the more vanilla options.\n\nInfluence selection - in game you will receive inbox notifications from the B Team Manager asking for confirmation of the first team players that you want to make available for the upcoming fixture. Use this opportunity to ensure the selection aligns with the DNA, as the B Team Manager often will look to play individuals based upon their current ability, which could lead to less game time for those that align better to the DNA.\n\n150 DNA POINTS - POSITION SET/ EXPLORE PATHWAY\n\nAt 150 DNA points, the focus changes from a wide lens to one with a little more attention to detail, here we dial things in a little in terms of development, and also make our first key decision with regards to the individual's development pathway.\n\nHere we review the pathway into the first-team, analysing the route, exploring the level of competition ahead. This will decide if we make the plyer available for loan, this isn't the crossroads for the player but a key moment in deciding which pathway the individual will follow for the next season.\n\nHere are two examples to help demonstrate the process.\n\nExhibit A, Ethan Butera - Ethan is a left-footed wide centre-back, looking at the potential players ahead of him in the above DNA visual, there is only Gastón Ávila and Jorrel Hato ahead of him, when considering the individual's natural position. Given that Ávila has also played a significant number of his matches in the DM strata, Butera has a clear pathway as no other individuals are blocking his pathway. If there were multiple players entering the first-team integration phase at the same time this would lead me to exploring an alternative route.\n\nExhibit B, Don-Angelo Konadu - at 17 years of age, Don-Angelo is still playing in the under 18s, he has nearly drawn down enough DNA points to enter the assessment phase. Given that we already have three strikers in the first-team and the likes of Skye Vink and Yoram Boerhout nearly entering the First Team Integration phase, Don-Angelo's pathway is blocked. Therefore, for me I would look to send the individual out on a short-term loan, given his access to minutes at the next level (Jong Ajax) will be limited due to the players mentioned. If Skye Vink and Yoram Boerhout also enter the First Team Integration phase at a similar time, the same will apply to one of the two, a move to another team in the Eredivisie or a league with a similar reputation would provide exposure to a similar level of competitive football.\n\nAfter the pathway review has taken place, and of course, notes added to the players profile, there are a few more tasks to action.\n\nSet Loan Status - For individuals who have a pathway which isn't clear, the emphasis is placed on securing them access to significant exposure to football at a relevant level. Here you can utilise affiliate clubs, or look to chance the market by placing the individual up for loan. Remember, always favour loan moves to sides who are offering increased playing time, and if possible those clubs which have a solid infrastructure, to aid development off the pitch.\n\nTargeted positional training - Now the player should be more rounded as an individual, the focus dials into specifics. Here we look to only focus his individual training to either the best role aligned to our current tactic, or the role which the player will excel the most in. Remember just because a player is playing in a given role, doesn't mean he will carry out the duties in match the same as another.\n\n155+ JONG AJAX KEY PLAYER\n\nKey players within the Jong side, but not quite ready to take the full step into the First Team. These players need a taste of what is to come, but only for a select few. Those who have read any of my previous work on youth development know I value the importance of praising individuals.\n\nHere at Ajax it is no different, I like to keep track of the best trainers at the club and have been rewarding those that finish in the top three for two consecutive months with the following.\n\nAdd to First Team training - Exposure to first team training, training with players who are accustomed to playing at a higher standard is key to any youth players development. Youth prospects will be given the chance to impress, whilst gaining access to better coaching staff, who in theory should aid their development. Again, providing individuals with this opportunity should impact both morale and overall happiness.\n\n165+ DNA POINTS - FIRST TEAM INTEGRATION\n\nAt 160 DNA points, I believe players to be at the stage where they need their armbands removed, these players have been playing a significant role in the Jong side and should have been given exposure to first-team training, it is time for them to be a small fish in a big pond.\n\nMove to Senior Squad - this speaks for itself.\n\nMentoring - the mentoring system consists of placing individuals in groups where they will learn off each other. Now there isn't a one size fits all to mentoring, different clubs have different personalities within the playing staff with varying levels of experience and personality types. However, what essentially we are looking to do is place a younger, less experienced player with either a senior player, or someone who has exemplary behaviours. The view, to improve determination, personality type, adopt traits, and harvest good relationships.\n\nExposure to First Team football - Ideally you only want to move players into the senior squad if they can add value, exposure to playing first team football will aid the development of talent. However, be warned that if you bring players into the senior squad and do not provide them minutes on the pitch, you are directly impacting their development. Exposure at first can be from the bench, 15 minutes here, and 15 minutes there, whilst the player finds his feet. The importance here is making the player feel a part of the match day squad and providing opportunities, why have a focus on a youth philosophy, if you aren't going to trust youth! The Ajax way philosophy ensures players have the opportunity to showcase their talent, performing what they have learned through their years within De Toekomst.\n\n175+ DNA POINTS - FIRST TEAM REGULAR\n\nAt this stage in the journey, players will be well on their way to entering their prime, individuals would have benefitted from exposure to the best coaching available at the club and took part in many training sessions geared towards your game model. These individuals find themselves familiar with the Ajax way philosophy and will be placed well with regards to the clubs hierarchy and social groups.\n\nThe average lifespan for an Ajax player within the first team is four years, hence the importance of ensuring there is a consistent pipeline of talent running through the production line in Amsterdam.\n\n185+ DNA POINTS - KEY PLAYER STATUS\n\nLooking at the clubs experience matrix you will note that only three of the key players when regarding DNA stem from the Peak, and Experienced footballer. This differs from the more traditional way of viewing players, in which most key players will either be in their prime or beyond.\n\nThese individuals are key to the success of the group, they epitomise the club and are fully aligned to the game model. This is clear to see when looking at minutes played to date, with three of the top four players regarding minutes on the pitch stem from the Key player status group.\n\nA point to note, given the exposure these individuals are getting, paired with their alignment to the game model, it is likely to be these individuals that are the ones being heavily scouted by some of the continent's bigger clubs.\n\nADDITIONAL VALUES OF ADOPTING A DNA WITHIN YOUR FM SAVE\n\nAGREED PLAYING TIME\n\nThe KPI against the Ajax way DNA also provides managers with a system which can help dictate agreed playing time. Looking at the snippet below from in game, you can see how our 'Important Players' are those which hold the highest DNA, our key players.\n\nCONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAs per the above, player pathways can aid when to offer players new contracts. Prior to this save I always used to offer new contracts to draw down talent of key performers, other than that simply wait until just before the players final year, before offering players an extension.\n\nUsing the player pathways system, you can see that it provides perfect opportunities as players pass through each stage to ensure they have a contract which reflects not only their ability but their individual pathway and player status.\n\nWAGE STRUCTURE\n\nFinally, by implementing a DNA related player pathway, like I have in the Ajax way, will ensure that you aren't handing out bumper contracts to individuals that are not aligned to the clubs philosophy, and reward players that are progressing up the DNA hierarchy.\n\nLooking at the above, you can see that five of the top six earners within the AFC Ajax squad, are those individuals who have the best DNA alignment.\n\nTL;DR\n\nThis week's blog discusses the implementation of a player pathway system, focusing on DNA scores, in football management, particularly within the context of managing Ajax in Football Manager. The pathway involves stages based on DNA points, guiding players from the youth team to the first team. The author emphasises the importance of consistent development, challenges in player pathways, and how the DNA approach influences training, loan decisions, and integration into the senior squad. The system is also linked to playing time, contract negotiations, and wage structure, aligning with the club’s philosophy.\n\nEdited December 2, 2023 by MattyLewis11\n\nFive blogs into the Ajax way and over 12,000 words written, and we have only just reached the midpoint of our first season in charge of the club. I hope readers are enjoying following my save and detailing my thoughts and key findings.\n\nToday we pick up from where we left off in the Steijnkelsson post, covering a few notable fixtures from both November and December, before looking at some of our underlying data, development, and then look at the wider gaming world.\n\nEREDIVISIE TABLE\n\nOne game shy of the official midway point, which will be played after the winter break. We are sitting pretty in second place of the Eredivisie, with our only defeat coming against AZ.\n\nWhilst our supporters are only satisfied with the job we are doing, they are delighted with our attacking brand of football, and are very pleased with our ability to entertain on the pitch. We are the highest scoring team in the league, out scoring Feyenoord by 10 goals. However, this brand of football comes with its flaws, unlike catenaccio, the Ajax way places an emphasis on attacking football, placing trust in the team to always outscore the opponent. This is reflected when viewing our goals against column, where we have the fifth best defence in the league, conceding nine more than Feyenoord.\n\nArne Slot's side are well placed to secure back to back Eredivisie titles, an achievement which has not been secured since 1961/62, the only time in the club's history.\n\nNOVEMBER 2023\n\nNovember was certainly a month for the neutral, we failed to score less than four goals in each match across the month, whilst the average total goals scored per game stood at seven.\n\nThe month belonged to Georges Mikautadze, who scored six goals and contributed with two further assists, I have dedicated a small segment of this blog to focus on our Georgian striker.\n\nAFC Ajax vs sc Heerenveen\n\nKees van Wonderen's side find themselves in fourth place of the Eredivisie and to-date have only lost the one fixture (Feyenoord), winning the other six, and drawing three. Outside of the big-three (Ajax, Feyenoord, and PSV) sc Heerenveen have the best xGA output.\n\nThey have only conceded more than one goal on two occasions, the defeat against Feyenoord (0-3) and victory against N.E.C. Nijmegen.\n\nClicking on the below visuals will take you to the match statistics.\n\nGiven the spiel I provided above, I wasn't expecting the game to take the course which it followed. Chance creation was not an issue in the match, we carved out 22 shots to their seven, of which four were clear cut chances.\n\nWhen you then take the amount of times we hit the woodwork into play (4), we could have chalked up significantly more goals than our xG for the match 3.6. Again, our ability to create shooting opportunities from a central zone is what is really impressing me with this 3-4-3 formation.\n\nMOTM: Brian Brobbey\n\n2 goals from 1.1 xG\n\n94% pass completion (16/17)\n\n3 key passes\n\n2 dribbles\n\nDECEMBER 2023\n\nAnother great month in December in the Eredivisie, failing to not pick up maximum points due to the draw at home against Sparta Rotterdam. PEC Zwolle were hit for SEVEN, whilst the spread of players hitting the back of the net continues to expand with the likes of Stanis Idumbo Muzambo and Anton Gaaei adding themselves to the list.\n\nAFC Ajax vs West Ham\n\nAfter Steven Bergwijn's talismanic performance in November at the Europa-Park Stadion, we knew that anything better than defeat against West Ham would see us progress to the knock-out stages of the UEFA Europa League. In doing so we would pass the Boards end of season expectation to reach at least the knockout stages.\n\nDespite losing the reverse fixture 2-4 away, the overall performance was decided on three minutes of madness, in which West Ham scored three goals, and an inability to defend the set-piece. We finished the match with a similar xG 2.01 vs 2.29, more clear cut chances 2 vs 1, along wit significantly more possession in dangerous areas, final-third passes 115 vs 40.\n\nI explored the post game analytics post game, with the view to understanding what contributed to the victory this time around against West Ham. It didn't take me too long to find, we won the aerial battle.\n\nLooking at each team's performance in the air in the defensive half really tells the story, West Ham finished the game with a 64% aerial duel success rate, compared to our 82%. For context in the reverse fixture we had a 49% success rate, compared to West Ham's 80%.\n\nMOTM: Benjamin Tahirović\n\n96% pass completion (29/30)\n\n1 goal\n\n1 assist\n\nThe result was enough for us to top the group, which means we now avoid the Knockout Play Off Round, and are guaranteed to earn another £1.02 million for appearing in the Round of 16.\n\nUNDER THE HOOD\n\nNow for some fun, for those of you who have followed my content over the years, you know how much I enjoy delving into the data. Now, given that I pointed out earlier the supporter culture desired for us to play attacking football, the team attacking performance visual is as good a place to start as any.\n\nIf you click on any of the below visuals it will take you to the underlying player data of interest.\n\nWe are performing well above average in attacking statistics, which is great to see, we are playing the Ajax way.\n\nThe Ajax side of 1994/95 won the Dutch championship and Champions League without losing a single game. Winning 27 games of a 34 game domestic season, scoring 106 goals and only conceding 28. That's over 3.1 goals scored per game.\n\nOur 3.25 goals per game is well above the Eredivisie average, the by-product of having a better pass completion rate, shots and shots on target (0.24 higher).\n\nThe one statistic which will need toning down if we are to look to accurately replicate the great Ajax side of 1994/95 is our dribbles per game. I will look to provide more detail on this in my tactical blog The Iron Tulip (3-4-3) which I am currently writing. In fact, we have made 285 dribbles across the range of games, 42 more than second placed PSV. For those of you that simply want the foundations of the tactic, please see the below.\n\nThe dribbles are heavily linked to our wingers, with Carlos Borges the league's volume dribbler (no surprise given his). The others (Bergwijn, Muzambo, and Berghuis) are all averaging over 4.3 dribbles per match.\n\nNext up the attacking efficiency visualisation, Ajax are a total outlier. No club has a conversion rate of over 19%, whilst ours sits at 23%. Feyenoord are taking the most shots in the Eredivisie, which isn't surprising given they lead the chances created metric.\n\nTaking a deeper look into the linked visual, Brian Brobbey is hitting the target with a high number of shots per 90, these have a expected goals per shot of 0.25, which shows the high quality opportunities which he is getting, aiding the conversion rate.\n\nIN POSSESSION\n\nPassing plays a key role in the Ajax way, in possession we have two team instructions which heavily rely on the ability to be confident on the ball to retain possession. PSV (10,408) have completed the most passes in the division, with AZ (92%) with the highest pass completion. We lead the final-third passes (1785) compared to PSV (1597) and AZ (1492) which highlights our attacking intent, with both other sides likely to be playing a higher percentage of sideways/backwards passes.\n\nLooking at the passing defenders confirms my initial thoughts with the bunch of five outliers in the top right quadrant all coming from AZ and PSV, apart from Calvin Verdonk of N.E.C. Nijmegen.\n\nOUT OF POSSESSION\n\nOur 'out of possession' team instructions focus on a high-press and high defensive line, two key features of a style long associated with the Ajax way. Therefore the pressing intensity visual within the data hub, should be one in which I'd like to see Ajax dominate.\n\nLooking at the above, we have the third highest defensive line per game, something which I have been trying to work out, given we hold the highest amount of passes in the final third, which in my opinion should provide the defence time to get into the high shape, for longer.\n\nI am simply going to attribute this to having a ball playing defender with a cover duty as the individual who sits between our wide centre backs, as covering will make the player drop a little deeper and sweep up any through balls behind the defensive line.\n\nWe also have the eight lowest opposition passes per defensive action, which currently is displayed in-game incorrectly as y-axis is showing ascending, but should be descending to reflect high OPPDA being negative in a pressing system.\n\nCurrently 8% of our possession gained is in the final third, and 25% in the opposition's half, for those of you playing high-pressing systems I would be intrigued to see what your numbers are.\n\nA FOCUS ON DEVELOPMENT\n\nI stated in the Ajax way DNA post that I would bi-annually assess individual's performance against the DNA. The winter break feels as good a point as any to cut the data, to assess changes.\n\nLooking at the above, Silvano Vos, Jorrel Hato, and Jay Gorter have seen the largest improvement in these key attributes, with the first team averaging a 1.82 increase.\n\nLooking for any trends, influencing the individuals with the best return on investment, personality isn't one, as the players personalities are as follows, Vos (Balanced), Hato (Balanced), and Gorter (Fairly Ambitious).\n\nThe accelerated development could well be due to the individuals gaining exposure to first-team football, as individuals prior to this save only had Gorter (one senior appearance at Ajax and four at Aberdeen), Hato (11 Eredivisie appearances), and Vos (two senior appearances at Ajax).\n\nMaybe it would be worthwhile investing in the in-game editor for research purposes at the end of the same to examine under the hood.\n\nA FOCUS ON GEORGES MIKAUTADZE\n\nI wanted to take a little time to expand on the performances of Georges Mikautadze, the 23 year-old Georgian has been extremely effective playing in a role which was made famous by Ajax legend Dennis Bergkamp, the schaduwspits, or more commonly referred to across the globe, the 'shadow striker'.\n\n1,142 minutes played, 14 goal contributions (nine goals, five assists)\n\nGeorges in the attacking phase is often very clinical in the box with accurate finishing abilities, this is reflected in his 45% conversion rate which is the second highest in the division, when looking at individuals who have taken over 20 shots.\n\nGeorges has also demonstrated that he is a capable passer and playmaker. He's astute at executing flicks to nearby teammates and looking for quick combination sequences. The shadow striker has also demonstrated a willingness to end his dribble attempts with a deft through ball or cross, leading to 1.58 key passes per match.\n\nThe Georgian is currently outperforming his xG of 5.89 by 3.11, as he has scored nine goals in the league.\n\nLooking at his form over the last 20 games, it is as expected for a player who secures the first player focus. Georges has an average rating of 7.41 which places him in third place, behind Kenneth Taylor (7.47), and Steven Bergwijn (7.50).\n\nUsing the Statman skin (which I love for player analysis due to the FBREF style visuals) you can easily see how effective Georges has been in the role. His per 90 stats are through the roof!\n\nThe schaduwspits is a role which I will be looking to dedicate a post to later in the series, very much along the lines of the one I covered last year on the Trequartsta. This will include a more detailed analysis of the role, including some in-game images.\n\nTHE INVINCIBLES\n\nTo date there are currently three teams in Europe's top seven leagues (Nation Club Coefficients) that are on track to potentially record a special achievement of finishing the campaign labelled as invincible.\n\nBelow are the profiles of the managers, along with a brief summary of their seasons to-date.\n\nPep Guardiola's Manchester City find themselves three-points clear of Liverpool with a game in hand, the Cityzens have taken maximum points in all bar two games (drawing with Arsenal and Wolves). City are averaging 2.5 goals per game, whilst maintaining an immense defensive record, conceding only five goals to-date.\n\nThey have scored three goals or more in seven games, the biggest result of the campaign so far against Brighton (6-0). Erling Haaland is top of the goal scoring charts (10), whilst Kevin De Bruyne (9) is one assist away from Martin Ødegaard (10).\n\nSérgio Conceição's FC Porto sit joint top of Liga Portugal Betclic with SL Benfica, although they have played a game more. Porto have taken maximum points in 12 of their 15 games, dropping points against Boavista, Casa Pia, and Arouca. Porto are averaging 2.4 goals per game, although compared to Cit they have a weaker defensive record (13 against).\n\nThey have scored three goals or more in six games, their most notable scoreline was the 3-1 victory over SL Benfica, they also ran out 2-1 winners against Sporting CP (Sorry Dan). Toni Martínez (12) leads the goal-scoring charts, three more than team-mate Mehdi Taremi. Whilst Alan Verela (7) is one assist behind João Moutinho of Sp, Braga.\n\nPeter Bosz' side find themselves in third place of the Eredivisie, five points clear of Feyenoord. Whilst the other two managers can tell the tale of dominance and attacking threat, Bosz has a different narrative. His PSV side have won 10 of their 16 games, drawing the other six, Peter's tale could be labelled the 'what ifs' as his side have conceded late goals against AZ, sc Heerenveen, and Ajax, costing them maximum points.\n\nJoey Veerman appears to be central to his side's creative threat, his 2.45 open play key passes per match see's him placed in second place behind Calvin Stengs (2.75).\n\nThis brings me to the end of this post of the Ajax way, we are well placed and most importantly performing well in all competitions. Early signs are promising, we could well be on the way to achieve all of the board's expectations, which were.\n\nReach the knockout stages of the UEFA Europa League\n\nQualify for the UEFA Champions League\n\nChallenge for the KNVB Beker.\n\nYou will find your answer in todays update @_Ben_\n\nThis blog picks off from where we left off at the Ajax way mid-point analysis, concluding the first season in charge of AFC Ajax.\n\nI must admit, the Ajax way save is providing me with an abundance of entertainment, having a clear identity which I am looking to build on, along with my usual focus on youth development, is providing me with a laser focus as I strive to take the club back to the top of the European game.\n\nIn today's blog I will look to provide you with a synopsis of the 2023/24 season, including some data analysis, key matches, and individual accolades. Before providing a foreword look to next season, exploring the board and fans demands, along with a dip into the transfer market.\n\n2023/24 SEASON REVIEW\n\nEREDIVISIE\n\nIf you are here for silverware, I am afraid you are going to have to wait, despite finishing as the Eredivisie's top scoring side, we closed the season in third-place. Feyenoord's improved defensive efficiency, paired with their ruthless scoring, has seen the side from Rotterdam secure back to back Eredivisie titles for only the second time in the clubs history.\n\nIf you are keen on viewing our full list of results from the second half of the season in the Eredivisie, the link has been provided. In today's post I will look to provide some key analysis, along with a breakdown of a few key fixtures, as I look to the future, with a view to improving our performance.\n\nGOAL SCORING\n\nThe above visual shows the areas on the pitch from which our goals have been scored (right), and the areas from which the assists have stemmed from (left). Firstly, looking at the area's from which our assists come from, it is pleasing to see just how much stems from central areas, particularly zone 14. The right flank plays a greater role in goal scoring, which shouldn't come as too much of a surprise, given the winger on this side of the field has the support duty. Finally, our ability to work the ball into the box is reflected in goals scored, with well over 90% of all goals being scored from those all important high xG areas.\n\nWITHOUT THE BALL\n\nOut of possession we are making considerably fewer defensive actions compared to the average side, this is what you would expect from a team which has closed the season with the second highest possession (61%) in the league. You can see that the majority of possession gained has been just before the halfway line, a figure which has been influenced by our high defensive line, most turnovers stemming from a CB winning an aerial duel. With regards to pressing, we are in an exclusive club of four sides, who have been effective at playing a high-press, along with being effective at breaking the opposition's continuity with the ball.\n\nIN POSSESSION\n\nWe closed the Eredivisie with a pass accuracy of over 90%, and are one of three sides to complete over 600 passes per match. When looking at the pitch tilt, you can see our final third dominance, we produce a high number of passes in the final third compared to the average. Interestingly only PSV had a better pass completion against figure, highlighting our effectiveness at playing the Ajax way, favouring possession. This paired with our high goals scored, ensured that entertaining football has been delivered.\n\nCHANCE CONVERSION\n\nOnly FC Twente had a better conversion rate than us in the Eredivisie. However, when you factor in the fact that we have taken 167 shots more than Julio Velázquez side, for information both sides xG per shot closed at 0.17. As stated earlier, Feyenoord were the most effective side out of possession, they closed the season with an expected xG against of 0.59, 0.35 better off than second placed PSV!\n\nAN APRIL TO FORGET\n\nLooking back at our results, it is clear to see that the month of April was a game-changer in terms of our title charge, we only managed to secure five points from the 12 available. Whilst it is unfair to state that taking maximum points across the month would have seen us crowned champions, I think even securing three points against both Go Ahead Eagles and FC Twente, could have put Slots team under more a greater pressure, as they always had a nice buffer to rely on, although it wasn't needed.\n\nThis one hurt...\n\nFeyenoord vs AFC Ajax\n\nAt De Kuip, Feyenoord got their redemption for the 4-0 defeat which they suffered in the reverse fixture.\n\nLooking at the game in finer detail, we failed to penetrate our opponents box, which reflected in our chances created. You can see from this chalkboard visual the importance placed on exerting pressure in the final-third, as we could only muster up a total of five shots.\n\nMOTM: Yankuba Minteh\n\n1 goal, 1 assist\n\n4 key passes, 2 clear cut chances created\n\n7 dribbles\n\nA special mention must also go to Peter Bosz' PSV, even if his side join an exclusive club of sides which have failed to win their domestic title, despite closing the season invincible. PSV closed the season with the best away record (P17, W13, D4), along with having the second best defensive record in the Eredivisie (26 conceded).\n\nUEFA EUROPA LEAGUE\n\nOur UEFA Europa League campaign was abruptly derailed by Milan, with my side not having the success of Louis van Gaal's Ajax of 1995. Despite salvaging a little pride in the second leg (0-0), we were well and truly demolished at the San Siro.\n\nThis game served as a little bit of a wake-up call, it highlighted that we still have a little way to go in terms of our performances on the continent. I don't think the problem is a lack of quality, it could well simply be the fact that the players need more time together as a unit, playing the system. This paired with a little more rotation for those lesser games in the Eredivisie, to ensure our key players are firing on all cylinders come the business end of the season.\n\nMilan vs AFC Ajax\n\nAs stated above, this wasn't as bad a result as the score line reflected, we finished the game with a non penalty expected goals figure of 1.31 compared to Milan's 2.04. Everything good for Milan stemmed from the work of Samuel Chukwueze, the Nigerian had an exceptional game.\n\n77 passes received (1st)\n\n3 key passes (1st)\n\n10 dribbles (1st)\n\n3 fouls against (1st)\n\nKNVB BEKER\n\nOur failure to secure victory against FC Twente in the KNVB would mean that we would go the season without securing any silverware. FC Twente lifted the trophy after defeating FC Groningen (1-0) in the final.\n\nINDIVIDUAL ACCOLADES\n\nWhat would an end of season analysis be without a squad profile comparing players age, to minutes played. Looking at the below, you will firstly note just how young our side, the vast majority of players are below 24. This provides me with hope for the future, if I can persuade a large proportion of the current playing squad to extend their contracts at the club, we will have a squad which contains a high volume of players in their prime.\n\nLooking at the average minutes line above, you will see that Chuba Akpom, despite being in his prime, has secured less than average minutes on the pitch. Chuba was signed from Middlesbrough at the end of the 2022/23 season for £10.5m. Despite the hefty fee, Akpom only scored six goals in 1,146 minutes of football, and his conversion rate of 15% is way below Brian Brobbey (38%) and Georges Mikautadze (30%). Again comparing his xG per shot of 0.19 to Brobbey (0.26), and Mikautadze (0.27), the Nigerian is also failing to get shots away in high scoring value positions, this led me to make my first executive decision at the club, I placed Akpom on the transfer list.\n\nLens instantly showed their interest and Akpom joined the French side on loan (£1.1m fee), with a mandatory future fee of £7m secured. Not a bad piece of business if I do say so myself.\n\nWith the return to full fitness of Gerónimo Rulli, we now have three goalkeepers in the first-team. Will another decision need to be made next season? Time will tell, for now I am hoping that I can ply one in the cup (Ramaj) and have Rulli accept that he will play as back-up to Gorter, my first choice.\n\nBrian Brobbey picked up the two biggest individual accolades, winning both the fan's player of the year and the young player of the season award. The striker had an excellent season playing as a trequartista as he had his best season to-date, putting behind his failure at RB Leipzig, a move which in my humble opinion was made too early on in his career.\n\nAbove is our best eleven, I am looking forward to seeing how this develops as we get deeper into the save. However, after such a good first season, it will take some effort to break into the so-called 'best eleven'. I have no idea as to why Medic is featured in the BPD role, as he always plays on the right of the three, and Rensch has never played on the left...hey ho!\n\nThe manager timeline - I really like this feature, I think this year a little more work has gone into the detail.\n\nThe below items make the timeline, you can see that I have made a conscious effort to bring back individuals to the club that can relate to the Ajax way. Edgar Davids a.k.a. 'The Pitbull' and Dennis Bergkamp, 'The Shaduwspits' have both played key roles for the club during their playing days and they both will be valued, Dennis joins as my Assistant Manager, whilst Edgar is a coach in the under 18s.\n\nThe appointment of Louis van Gaal for the club as the Director of Football had to be done, we are looking to replicate his tactical style 'The Iron Tulip'. Therefore excluding him from the journey, well simply would have been rude.\n\nTHE AJAX WAY - OFF FIELD EXPECTATIONS\n\nTHE SUPPORTERS\n\nFailing to win the Eredivisie, and having to endure Feyenoord retaining the label as the 'best team in the Netherlands', it was never going to be a season to remember for our supporters. However, we are doing well when taking into consideration their desires of playing an entertaining brand of attacking football.\n\nTHE FIVE YEAR PLAN\n\nThe Board have a clear plan and expect us to win the Eredivisie in 2025/26. Therefore, the heat is most certainly on and although this season's goal is to challenge for the title, we could well see ourselves at risk if we don't put up a significant challenge for silverware this season.\n\nACTIONABLE OBJECTIVES\n\nSome absolute beauties of actionable objectives below, which I will try to meet, to ensure that I am ticking all the boxes required by the hierarchy.\n\nSpend the original transfer budget - Spend as much of the transfer budget made available at the start of the season as possible.\n\nI haven't seen this objective before in all my years of playing Football Manager, and to be honest I am not 100% certain as to why it is associated with Ajax, as the side historically have invested roughly 50% of all transfer revenue back into player acquisitions. However, I am not one to argue and immediately engaged in conversation with Brighton and Hove Albion over the loan signing of Joao Pedro, the Brazilian is well aligned to the Ajax way (179 DNA) and can play anywhere across the front four positions.\n\nHaving featured only 11 times for Brighton and Hove Albion last season, I thought I was in with a good shout to secure the player for a short-term deal. However, Tony Bloom would only let him leave for £4.3m per month! That's £51.6m even before including the mandatory £77m to make his signature permanent, after the initial deal. £128.6m combined package, I know inflation is high, but they only signed him from Watford for £29.5m, he is one to watch for the future.\n\nGrow the club's reputation - continue improving the club's reputation\n\nFM is well aligned to the real world in terms of reputational development, as far as I understand elevating your club's reputation in Football Manager demands a strategic blend of on-field success, financial prudence, and astute management.\n\nPrimarily, success in matches stands as the cornerstone of reputation enhancement, especially those against clubs with a higher reputation; along with consistent high league standings, again another fundamental way to drive reputation. Whilst attracting and nurturing top-tier talent is pivotal, as the acquisition of skilled players can significantly bolster your team's competitive edge.\n\nAnother way to gain an improved reputation is through youth development itself, a continuous pipeline of homegrown talent, one which contributes positively to the club's identity both on and off the pitch will lead to long-term dividends. Additionally, success in European competitions, such as the UEFA Champions League or Europa League, serves as a powerful catalyst for elevating your club's reputation on the global stage. The prestige associated with triumphs in continental tournaments can attract attention and admiration from football enthusiasts worldwide.\n\nEffective media relations are an often underestimated aspect of reputation management. Interacting positively with the media, maintaining composure in interviews, and praising your players contribute to a favourable public image. A manager's conduct off the field can have a resounding impact on the perception of the club.\n\nNegative transfer budget business model - sell players to fund player purchases\n\nRECRUITMENT\n\nI wanted to spend a significant amount of our transfer budget on bringing in a new midfielder, I have been scouting a large proportion of the world cross the season, with my scouts assigned to the above regions, looking at players aged 15-23, with a potential ability of 3.5 stars or more, and a current ability of 1.5.\n\n*click on the players image to view his attributes\n\nThe decision was made to invest in Gabriel Moscardo from Corinthians in Brazil, in a deal worth £18m. The youngster is well aligned to the Ajax way, and holds a DNA value of 183, which sees him already as a first-team regular.\n\nUsing the same approach as the one which I covered in my Thiago Motta: The Value of The Ball blog, the below table helps to show the diversity of our midfield, and really highlights what Moscardo can offer. Hence, deciding to sign him, rather than promote from within.\n\nThe below visual compares players attributes in relation to different profiles of midfielder (ball player, dynamic, aggressor, goal scoring, and the engine). This can easily be replicated across any position, you simply need to think of what attributes fit your selected descriptor, and then use a conditional format to colour the cells on a scale, from lowest to highest.\n\nFirst and foremost, if you can remember from the earlier blog The Ajax Way - DNA, the Eredivisie attribute average is 11. Taking Moscardo's attributes across the board you will note that he rates above average for all but one of the criteria, the Brazilian is well rounded, and has the ability to play a multitude of roles in the midfield.\n\nWhen comparing him to our other young talents, both of which will be securing first-team minutes this season, he is more dynamic, stronger, has a better goal instinct, and engine than Silvano Vos. Whilst he out performs Gabriël Misehouy in all areas, apart from ball-playing.\n\nThe 18-year-old was signed with a release clause written into his contract with the value of £38m, the beauty of this deal is that it expires in September 2026. If met it will provide us with a significant profit, if not then I am anticipating his future fee could well be even bigger.\n\nAdditionally two further acquisitions were made as Jhojan Torres, and Óscar Perea join from Columbia. Both individuals are loaned out immediately, with Atlético Nacional S.A. taking the loan-back option on Perea, whilst Torres moves to Belgium with KAS Eupen, to continue his development.\n\nBoth players are again well aligned to the Ajax way, with Torres having 160 DNA points (Jong Ajax Key Player), and Perea with 173 DNA points (First Team Integration). With regards to players leaving Amsterdam, there were a few moves which are documented below.\n\nThe one departure which I wasn't expecting was the exit of Owen Wijndal, who moved to al-Hilal for a deal worth £17.75m. The offer came in for Owen after I had decided to move on Borna Sosa to Al-Qadsiah on loan (£1.4m), with a mandatory future fee of £10m. Sosa, despite scoring a high DNA, had the squad status of an important player, but wasn't really effective at playing as a wide-centre back, unsurprising given he is an excellent complete wing-back, who has one of the best deliveries (crossing 18) in the game.\n\nThe unexpected sale will see Ahmetcan Kaplan join Gabriël Misehouy, Ethan Butera, and Skye Vink progress from the Jong Ajax side into the first team. Whilst, Naci Ünüvar (187 DNA) is the only player returning from a loan spell that is retained by the club. The 21-year-old will play a supporting role for captain Steven Bergwijn.\n\nKian Fitz-Jim (187 DNA) loaned to sc Heerenveen (7th place) for the season to build on his development, after spending last season at Excelsior Rotterdam, who finished in 13th place.\n\nFrancisco Conceição (177 DNA) loaned to RB Salzburg with £5.25m fee after 20 matches\n\nThe season preview has placed us as favourites to be crowned the Dutch national champions, can we add to the clubs illustrious history and etch ourselves in the AFC Ajax history books for eternity, only time will tell.\n\nJoin me next time for the next edition of the Ajax way. The next post will be the one which you have all been waiting for, the tactic in all its glory in a blog called The Ajax Way - Masterclass in Total Football"
