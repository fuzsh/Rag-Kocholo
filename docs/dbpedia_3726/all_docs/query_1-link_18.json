        "text": "We reflect on Chelsea's 2014/15 title-winning campaign with top stats, quotes and pundit views...\n\nChelsea\n\nFinishing position: 1st (+2 on last season)\n\nTotal points: 87 (+5 on last season)\n\nChampions League: Eliminated by Paris St Germain in the Round of 16\n\nFA Cup: Eliminated in the fourth round by Bradford City\n\nCapital One Cup: Winners\n\nSeason review\n\nJose Mourinho had always stressed that the second season upon his return to Chelsea would be when we’d all see what his team was capable of and it didn’t take long for the summer signings to click into gear. Diego Costa scored seven goals in his first four Premier League appearances, while Cesc Fabregas’s pass against Burnley was Jamie Carragher’s moment of the season.\n\nChelsea hit top spot that Monday night after the first round of games and proved to be the Premier League’s dominant team from that stage onwards – picking up 36 points from the first 14 games. That period included magnificent performances in the process with Mourinho’s men hitting Everton for six, winning at Anfield against Liverpool and easing past Arsenal.\n\nIt’s not been quite so fluent since those early efforts but that’s not been evident in the results. When is a blip not a blip? When Chelsea go 16 Premier League games unbeaten from New Year’s Day with Mourinho maintaining his unbeaten record against title rivals since his return to English football.\n\nSo while there was Champions League disappointment with a round-of-16 exit at the hands of Paris St Germain, the domestic crown was wrapped up with three games to spare. It’s Chelsea’s first league title since 2009/10 and the fifth in the club’s 110-year history.\n\nGary Neville's star player: Eden Hazard\n\n“The best player in the league is Eden Hazard. Now he’s got to go up again. That can’t be the end for Hazard. He’s now got to get to the Arjen Robben levels and the Gareth Bale levels to score more goals. He should be aiming that high with his talent.”\n\nQuotes of the season\n\n“What can we expect? I expect Diego. This is the player we bought and we were waiting for since last season.” – Jose Mourinho on Diego Costa in August\n\n“We are not favourites, we are candidates.” – Jose Mourinho downplayed Chelsea’s title hopes in January despite having led since the first weekend of the season\n\n“The people who have a big face to say we don't deserve it are the ones who, in my country, say the dogs bark and the caravan goes by.” – Jose Mourinho after winning the Premier League title\n\nStats of the season\n\n- Chelsea’s tally of 87 points is their best haul since the 2005/06 season – Jose Mourinho’s previous title-winning campaign at the club\n\n- Having conceded 32 goals, Chelsea boasted the best defensive record in the Premier League – just as they have in each of the previous four full seasons in which Jose Mourinho has been in charge\n\n- Cesc Fabregas totalled 18 assists in the Premier League season – no other player in the division managed more than 11 of them\n\nGary Neville's view\n\n“The rest are miles away from this Chelsea team, tactically and defensively. I don’t think it’s a Chelsea team like the first Chelsea team in 2005 that Mourinho had, but it’s a very good team that needs to improve to get to that next level.\n\n“I’ve not seen a title-winning team that plays well the whole way through. You have to be pragmatic at times and recognise the strengths of other teams. Mourinho does that – he adapts. They’re all at a pretty good age. They’re going to go again and again, and they’re the team to catch over this next couple of seasons.”"
