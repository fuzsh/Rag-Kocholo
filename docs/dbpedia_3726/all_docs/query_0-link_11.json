        "text": "Aug. 7, 2015\n\nHUNTINGTON, W.Va. - Former Marshall men's soccer captain Travis Brent has been signed by Almere City FC to a one-year deal.\n\nThe Dutch club competes in the Eerste Divisie, which is the second tier of professional soccer in the Netherlands.\n\nIn 2014-15, Brent, of Virginia Beach, Va., played for Heracles Almelo in the Eredivisie, the top tier in the Netherlands. The club finished the season 14th in the table, avoiding relegation by two places.\n\nBrent played in all 67 games during his four-year career at Marshall, starting 64. Known for his consistent play and leadership, Brent became the anchor of Marshall's back line. In his junior season, he helped lead a very strong defense. Marshall placed third in the nation in shutout percentage.\n\nBrent received many honors while at Marshall, including being named to the Conference USA third team in 2013. Brent was also named to the Conference USA All-Freshman team in 2010 and the C-USA Commissioner's Honor Roll for the same season."
