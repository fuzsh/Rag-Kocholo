        "text": "We reflect on the 2014/15 Premier League season with the help of stats and pundit views...\n\nSo that’s it. The 23rd Premier League season is over. Chelsea are champions, while Hull City join Burnley and Queens Park Rangers in losing their top-flight status.\n\nWith the help of our team of pundits, we’ve put together a club-by-club review of the season. Do you agree with Jamie Carragher that Alexis Sanchez was Arsenal’s top man? Do you share Charlie Nicholas’s view that Manchester City have underachieved?\n\nFrom John Carver’s claim that he’s the best manager in the Premier League to Alan Pardew comparing Crystal Palace to Brazil, we have picked out the best quotes of the season and found out what the managers regarded as their team’s moment of the campaign.\n\nWe’ve also picked out some of the best statistics of the season for each Premier League club. So you can find out which team dropped the most points from winning positions and which player has scored more than half of his Premier League goals after coming off the bench.\n\nFor all that and lots more, follow the links through to our Premier League season review for your club…\n\nArsenal season review\n\nAston Villa season review\n\nBurnley season review\n\nChelsea season review\n\nCrystal Palace season review\n\nEverton season review\n\nHull City season review\n\nLeicester City season review\n\nLiverpool season review\n\nManchester City season review\n\nManchester United season review\n\nNewcastle United season review\n\nQueens Park Rangers season review\n\nSouthampton season review\n\nStoke City season review\n\nSunderland season review\n\nSwansea City season review\n\nTottenham Hotspur season review\n\nWest Bromwich Albion season review"
