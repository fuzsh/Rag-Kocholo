        "text": "As it is summer, we wanted to dig ourselves deep into transfer pieces. Who would join, who would leave and so on and so forth. But it’s being done to death everywhere, so how could we make our next feature a little different? So Sam came up with a fun twist on the regular “who should we sign?” articles. We were each assigned a league:\n\nPremier League – Moz\n\nSerie A – Sam\n\nBundesliga – Chris\n\nLigue 1 – David\n\nLa Liga – Jase\n\nThe task was simple – pick two players from each relegated side, and make a case for them to be (semi) viable targets for Stoke in the upcoming summer transfer window. So without further ado, let’s delve into the Premier League…\n\nPremier League – MOZ\n\nNEWCASTLE UNITED\n\nandros townsend\n\nAge: 24\n\nPosition: RW, LW\n\nA player I have personally liked for a long-time is the former Spurs man. He has been one of the few shining lights of their season and his form was so good he has come back into the England fold.\n\nHe became a regular at Newcastle with 13 appearances, scoring 4 goals and had 2 assists which is a really good return in such a small amount of time.\n\nWith a rumoured £8m release clause, I think we should be all over that as we could be possibly in dire need for two wingers.\n\nJAMAAL LASCELLES\n\nAge: 22\n\nPosition: CB\n\nA player highly regarded during his time at Nottingham Forest had found his chances at Newcastle very slim, until injuries to a couple of centre halves he was given his chance under Rafa Benitez and had several good performances.\n\nNot one to slide in, but more of a game reader which Hughes’ has been signing since he arrived; however he does have the build and strength like Ryan.\n\nA big centre back, a future captain and still really young, could be a well worthy long-term scoop.\n\nnorwich city\n\nnathan redmond\n\nAge: 22\n\nPosition: RW, LW, AM\n\nA player we have been strongly linked with us already this Summer. A quick, a winger who likes to cut in, very much like Arnautovic; so you can see why Hughes has kept a close eye on the ex-Birmingham City player.\n\nLast season he scored 6 goals and assisting 2, which for a low scoring team is a decent effort.\n\nBest mates with Jack Butland and a player Stoke have tried to sign before, being from Birmingham also. You do feel as long as Norwich and Stoke can agree to a deal, it will happen.\n\nTIMM KLOSE\n\nAge: 28\n\nPosition: CB\n\nA January signing and one who had impressed for the Canaries before an injury.\n\nA big, no-nonsense CB is what many Stoke fans are crying out for. With rumours of the Wollscheid possibly returning to Germany, and with the injury concerns our defence has had all season, a new CB is a very high possibility and there is a very decent one in the Swiss International.\n\naston villa\n\njordan ayew\n\nAge: 24\n\nPosition: CF, RW, LW\n\nThe only player who proved himself to have any form of talent. Quick, pacy, tricky and an eye for goal with 7 goals in 28 games for such a pathetic side is some real effort.\n\nHe is still only 24 and plenty of years left in him, there is no doubt he will be moving on from Villa Park, and one I believe Hughes should be looking at, will certainly be a lot cheaper than brother Andre.\n\nJORDAN AMAVI\n\nAge: 22\n\nPosition: LB\n\nHe only played 10 games before getting a season ending injury, but he showed himself to be capable, speedy, likes to get forward and more importantly Pieters needs competition at LB.\n\nAmavi was highly rated in is his native France, but his injury is going to take a long time to get over fully and at the age of 22 he has plenty of time to improve; could be a shrewd move albeit a hefty gamble.\n\nSerie A – SAM\n\n“Pickings are slim in Italy. All three relegated teams were pretty poor, especially going forward. However here are six of the not worst.”\n\nVerona\n\nMatteo Bianchetti\n\nPosition: CB\n\nAge: 23\n\nBianchetti is a CB for Hellas Verona, he’s a no-nonsense defender who loves a good tackle. While not a cultured defender in the mould that Mark Hughes has looked for at Stoke there is certainly a need for a back up option for Ryan Shawcross.\n\nLast season was Bianchetti’s first as a regular in the first team, starting 19 games and coming on as a sub in a further 6. There’s a lot of room for this young defender to grow and he could be a fairly cost effect option for Stoke.\n\nFederico Viviani\n\nPosition: DM\n\nAge: 24\n\nAn all-round midfielder, Federico Viviani is probably the pick of the bunch from Serie. In 20 games last season for Verona he contributed 3 goals and 6 assists in a poor campaign for the Gialloblu.\n\nViviani comes in the same mould as Italy most successful midfielders. While he’s no Pirlo or Verratti he offers a similar style of the play to the two. A great passer of the ball Viviani is decisive in key situations, is a hell of a threat from set pieces – that’s right, this guy can actually get a corner past the first man – and more than willing to put a challenge in. Viviani would be the perfect solution to Stoke’s porous midfield.\n\nFrosinone\n\nNicola Leali\n\nPosition: GK\n\nAge: 23\n\nCheating a bit here, as Leali is on loan from Juventus but with Shay Given’s injury problems this season and Jakob Haugaard struggling after being thrown to the wolves it’s not inconceivable that Stoke could look for goalkeeping help in the summer.\n\nLeali is young enough to improve and despite some lapses in concentration he has a number of appealing traits. The Italian is athletic and has shown the ability to command his box, he’s also impressively accurate with his goal kicks.\n\nLuca Paganini\n\nPosition: RW, CF\n\nAge: 22\n\nPaganini, best described as a right sided forward, is a product of Frosinone’s youth academy and has an impressive 82 games under his belt at the age of 22. Certainly not prolific by any means with just 2 goals and 2 assists in 27 games this season he does however show a number of desirable attributes.\n\nHe’s an impressive player in terms of work rate, something that Jon Walters currently offers Stoke and something that they’ve tried to bring into the team with a number of players. Not least Jonathan Calleri last summer. His position in the Stoke squad would be as an understudy on the right wing, but there’s room for him to grow.\n\nCarpi\n\nSimone Romagnoli\n\nPosition: CB\n\nAge: 26\n\nIn a similar manner to Bianchetti, Romagnoli would be an interesting option for Stoke to pick up as a potential squad player covering for Ryan Shawcross. He’s older and so offers less room for improvement but is more of the finished product anyway.\n\nPlaying in 33 games last season for Carpi Romagnoli displayed great aerial ability as well as the athleticism and instincts to make multiple crucial blocks on shots.\n\nKevin Lasagna\n\nPosition: CF\n\nAge: 23\n\nLet’s face it. He was the top scorer for Carpi but he’s only in here because his name is Lasagna. WhoScored, whose metrics I’m using because I can’t remember seeing him play, state his weaknesses as finishing, offside awareness and passing. Pretty much perfect for a Stoke forward.\n\nDespite this he managed to score 5 goals in just 8 starts (and 28 appearances from the bench) for Carpi so there must be something there.\n\nBundesliga – CHRIS\n\nSome say his real name is Chris Bratwurst. His interest and love of the Bundesliga knows no bounds, and he relished the chance to dive into his favourite league for this feature.\n\nIt’s worth noting before we go any further, that (as I’m sure a lot of you know), the Bundesliga operates a “relegation play off” system, where the 3rd from bottom team in the Bundesliga, and the 3rd highest team in the 2.Bundesliga play a two legged match. If the 2.Bundesliga team wins, they swap places with their opposition for the next season. This season, Eintracht Frankfurt survived the test of FC Nuremburg, so only 2 teams were relegated, Hannover 96, and VfB Stuttgart.\n\nVfB STUTTGART\n\nTIMO WERNER\n\nAge: 20\n\nPosition: Forward\n\nA very talented youth, now Stuttgart have been relegated, Timo Werner is just as likely to get game time in the 2.Bundesliga as he is to move on. The potential is there, and Werner, given the right environment will become one of the best German players of his generation.\n\nHe’s very raw at the moment, and is in need of a nurturing environment, but under the guidance and tutoring of a former Striker like Mark Hughes, alongside the Barca graduates could be just what he needs. Again, it’s unlikely, but if there is one player we could pick from the disaster of Stuttgart (sorry Sam), then it is Timo Werner.\n\nTIMO BAUMGARTL\n\nAge: 20\n\nPosition: CB\n\nLike Werner, Baumgartl is another talented German youngster who should make the breakthrough in a few years. It’s difficult to see him leaving Stuttgart, let alone Germany, but if he was to make the trip across to the Premier League, we would find a player who is still developing, but has match experience, with great defensive abilities.\n\nHim signing for Stoke would be definitely be one to file under “one for the future”, rather than an instant impact, but under the right guidance, and in the right environment, he would no doubt grow into a very good central defender.\n\nHANNOVER 96\n\nSALIF SANE\n\nAge: 25\n\nPosition: DM/CB/RB\n\nIt’s been a poor season for Hannover, and picking players from their team is difficult, as there are little positives to talk about after they came bottom of the Bundesliga. Salif Sane, the Senegal international, however is one player who could potentially leave the wreckage that is Hannover, and do a decent job for Stoke.\n\nIt’s no secret that we will need a defensive midfielder soon to replace the aging Glenn Whelan, and at 25, Sane is a decent option. A strong option in the middle of the park, Sane would offer a decent option in that holding, defending the back 4 position.\n\nA bid for him would probably cost only cost a couple of million, but with him still being relatively young, there is potential for growth.\n\nRON-ROBERT ZIELER\n\nAge: 27\n\nPosition: GK\n\nObviously, Jack Butland is our No1, and will be until the day he retires or the inevitable day one of the big 4 comes and steals him away. But questions have been raised over our backups. Ron-Robert Zieler would be a brilliant fit, even if it is a little bit unrealistic (he is more likely to be picked up by another Bundesliga team if any).\n\nA commanding figure, he has had a rough season this year, but his quality has been proven in the past. Good reflexes, positioning and handling, he would be a good keeper for mid table premier league team.\n\nLigue 1 – David\n\n“Signing a single player from this mob would be absolutely insane”\n\nTROYES\n\nJOHAN MARTIAL\n\nAge: 25\n\nPosition: CB\n\nWell, relegated French sides don’t seem like a natural hunting ground for Stoke City’s scouts. But didn’t Leicester sign N’Golo Kante from a French second division side? No, Caen finished 13th the season before he went to the King Power. Ah.\n\nOkay, let’s look at who we’re dealing with here. At the bottom of the pack are Troyes, who finished the season on 18 points, winning 3 games all season and conceding 83 goals. Sorry, they may have a fantastic prospect or two in their youth academy but signing a single player from this mob would be absolutely insane.\n\nThe only Troyes we should be even considering are Deeney and Archibald-Henville. They do have Johan Martial, brother of the Man United striker Anthony, a centre-back who probably has PTSD from the rings his little bro used to run around him in the garden. So best to avoid him.\n\nGAZALEC AJACCIO\n\nANDREY PANYUKOV\n\nAge: 21\n\nPosition: CF, RW, LW\n\nIn 19th place are Gazelec Ajaccio, the Corsican side. I know Stoke-on-Trent doesn’t have the weather, but every player here should be jumping at the chance to join us. Ajaccio were quickly sent back to Ligue 2 after finishing winning promotion in 2014-15. Is there anybody that may be of interest to us though? Their top scorer in all competitions can’t really hold down a place in the Morocco side so once again this looks unlikely.\n\nPerhaps though, there’s potential in the form of Russian forward Andrey Panyukov. The Moscow-born 21-year-old can play all across the front three positions and has a n impressive 8 goals in 17 games for his country at U-21 level. He could be another Pavlyuchencko, but he’d cost absolute peanuts. He was on loan at Ajaccio from Atlantas (Lithuanian side, in case you were wondering).\n\nHUGO VIDÉMONT\n\nAge: 23\n\nPosition: LW, RW, #10\n\nAlso, there’s Marseille-born left-winger Hugo Vidémont, Ajaccio’s most valuable player according to transfermarkt.co.uk. He’s only 23 years old and could be a cut-price replacement for Arnie. Not a natural goalscorer with only 2 goals last season, he is however quite a handsome chap who suits red and white stripes.\n\nREIMS\n\nAISSA MANDI\n\nAge: 24\n\nPosition: CB, RB, LB\n\nReims suffered a heart-breaking relegation on the final day of the season, so the standard of players should be better than that of Ajaccio and Troyes. However, how good can a squad with David N’Gog in it actually be?\n\nTheir best player is France-born Algerian right-back/centre-half Aissa Mandi. Having represented his country 23 times, the 24-year-old clearly has talent in abundance. Given our problems at the back last term, this guy could actually be a decent acquisition. However, we’ve got to act fast as Middlesbrough are leading the chase for Mandi, who was linked with Arsenal during the January transfer window.\n\nPRINCE ONIANGUÉ\n\nAge: 27\n\nPosition: CM, DM, AM\n\nReims’ next-best player is Prince Oniangué, an all-action midfielder and Congo international, with 7 goals in 32 games for his country. With us having spent millions on Imbula, signing a 27-year-old from a relegated French side to play in his position seems rather unlikely. However, if you lovesexy football, Prince is the way to go.\n\nLa Liga – Jase\n\n“For reference I know nothing about La Liga beyond Steven N’Zonzi. So this will probably be terrible…”\n\nRayo Vallecano\n\nDiego Llorente\n\nAge: 22\n\nPosition: CB/DM\n\nNow, I’m sort of cheating here. Llorente has played 33 league games and 2 Copa Del Rey games for Rayo this season, but technically he’s a Real Madrid B (or Castilla) loanee.\n\nThe young Spaniard has made 35 appearances this season, and whilst the club have fallen into the second tier it’s not all bad news for the defender.\n\nA strong reader of the game, Llorente has more interceptions this season (104) than Shawcross and Cameron combined this season (96), and more than Wollscheid (75).124 clearances surpasses all but the German’s 175 for the season. A steady 79% pass completion also helps. He even knows where the net is, having bagged 2 goals and 1 own goal this season.\n\nThe problem here is that there’s an indication that Llorente’s move to Rayo may be made permanent, so it’s likely a long shot this summer. Come January however, we could look into this one…\n\nJozabEd Sanchez\n\nAge: 25\n\nPosition: #10, LW/RW\n\nNearly hitting double figures in a season of doom is rather impressive. Even more so from midfield! Jozabed managed to fire in 9 goals and 3 assists in 27 league games this season, a significant improvement from 2 goals and 1 assist in the 27 games prior for Rayo. Purple patch? Or player development? Let’s go with the latter, for my sake.\n\nA 1 in 3 strike rate from attacking midfield this season is very impressive, especially in a side languishing at the bottom of the table. We need someone to rival Bojan in the #10 role without disrupting a more creative style evolution, and we could probably do worse than Jozabed Sanchez. Probably.\n\nGetafe\n\nPablo Sarabia\n\nAge: 24\n\nPosition: #10, LW, RW, CM\n\nA fairly young and exciting prospect, yet to reach his prime. Exactly the kind of player we need to be targeting to make an impact and still develop in the side!\n\nSarabia is incredibly versatile across midfield and attack, but seems to shine in the right wing role more than anything. 7 goals and 6 assists in 31 games this season with goals and assists coming from both wings and the #10 role.\n\nWhoScored’s descriptions seem to bill him a set piece specialist too, which would be nice given our awful attempts this season.\n\nSarabia could be good utility man in midfield to rotate, cover and challenge when the inevitable injuries and dips in form strike.\n\nEmiliano Velazquez\n\nAge: 22\n\nPosition: CB\n\nAnother cheating loanee, this time from Atletico Madrid, Velazquez is a young centre half with a mixed season at Getafe.\n\n12 appearances is limited game time compared to the others in this piece, but Emiliano is still young and has plenty of years ahead of him for regular games and development.\n\n3 goals in 12 games is strikers form, let alone that of a defender, and the 1 assist is a bonus.\n\nLabelled a no nonsense defender, excelling in tackling and ball interception according to WhoScored. That will please the fans who loathe playing it out from the back at least!\n\nInjuries limited his season, but overall he still did well. Could be one for development in the future.\n\nLevante\n\nGuiseppe Rossi\n\nAge: 29\n\nPosition: CF\n\nThe man, the legend…the fallen?\n\nRossi is an incredible talent with no luck whatsoever. Prone to long term injuries that have shattered his career for long stages, it has ruined one of the great scorers of my generation. Despite this, there’s life in the old dog yet.\n\n8 goals and 4 assists this season sounds alright, but it’s more impressive when you break it down it looks a lot more impressive. 2 goals in 4 games in the Europa League. 6 goals in 15 starts (and 2 sub appearances) in La Liga. 2 Assists in Serie A prior to his Fiorentina exit.\n\nRossi is injury prone, but ruthless. Which is one better than our current squad. Go get him, Hughes.\n\nJefferson Lerma\n\nAge: 21\n\nPosition: CM, DM, RB\n\nOn loan from Atletico Huila, Lerma is a young prospect with significant game time this season, playing 33 games over the course of the La Liga campaign.\n\nDepiste his age and with 4 fewer games than Whelan, Lerma stacks up fairly well. With only 5 fewer tackles (46 to 51), 10 fewer interceptions (63 to 27) and slightly better chance creation (27 to 25). Lerma even managed 1 goal and 2 assists in the side.\n\nA tough tackling central midfield who has shined when dropping into a deeper DM role, he provides the more solid side to Imbula’s roaming and box to box running. Available fairly cheap (£1m-£2m?) and only 21, he could be a long term project to work on.\n\nSo there you have it, a complete selection of players from the Top 5 leagues’ relegated sides. Let us know who you’d pick over at 4231 Stoke Twitter.\n\nThere’s much clamour for the homegrown lads this summer. The British born and bred, those with graft and all the other myths that are associated with a passport. So here you go, let’s see what we can do. I’m Jase and I’ll take you through a squad of British players that Mark Hughes may seek to delve into this summer…\n\nStarting XI\n\nJohn Ruddy – Norwich City\n\nJack Butland’s injury and Jakob Haugaard’s baptism of fire have opened up a fresh debate regarding the #2 role, and naturally we look to those who have fallen through the Premier League’s trap door for inspiration. Vastly experienced keeper John Ruddy would be a great addition for cover and to push Jack Butland, as well as potentially resurrecting his own England chances for one final hurrah in 2018.\n\nWith Declan Rudd favoured over him for spells last season, it may be that Norwich are beginning to plan for the future. Surely it’d be better to be a Premier League #2 than a Championship #2, eh John?\n\nKieran Trippier – Spurs\n\nThe assist king of Burnley hasn’t quite made the impact he’d have hoped at title challengers Tottenham, with a somewhat incredible resurgence in Kyle Walker being the reason for his limited game time.\n\nGlen Johnson is a terrific option for Stoke as a first choice, with Bardsley a solid back up, but neither are getting any younger. Trippier would offer a longer term solution to the role, and could battle it out with Johnson at full back across the season. Our new style of play relies heavily on full backs creating chances and therefore Trippier, who bagged 18 assists in the two seasons prior to his Spurs move, would be a perfect signing.\n\nMichael Keane – Burnley\n\nThe links with Keane, stretching back as far as January are common knowledge by now. Rumours that a £7m bid for the Burnley centre half was rejected and that it may need £10m to prize him from the Clarets.\n\nTheir convincing title win and subsequent promotion will only make it harder to get Keane, but what a terrific signing he’d be at centre half.\n\nOver 90 mins Keane averages more blocks than Wollscheid and Cameron, as well as nearly toppling both Stoke defenders for interceptions and clearances. 5 goals is a solid haul for a defender too – more than some of our forwards!\n\nJamaal LascElles – Newcastle United\n\nIn a season of despair on Tyneside, Lascelles’ late season breakthrough was a shining light. Rafa seems to rate the youngster a hell of a lot more than Steve McClaren, with the majority of his appearances coming in the second half of the season.\n\nHe’s a young English centre half with Premier League experience, a huge future ahead of him and time on his side – he’s still only 22. WhoScored has him down as excelling in aerial duels, blocks and above all concentration – something our defenders have lacked at times this season!\n\nLacelles was rated highly at Nottingham Forest, and the league is slowly understanding why. Jamaal could be a excellent long term option to take over from Ryan Shawcross. Certainly worth a bid this summer.\n\nAndrew Robertson – Hull City\n\nA young full back with a bright future, and one that Sam at 4231 has championed for a few years. Robertson is a marauding left wing back with pace and attacking intent, and (as with Trippier) this would fit Stoke’s style terrifically well. He could be the perfect competition for Erik Pieters, who looks in need of a rest at times.\n\nThe flying Scotsman has 33 tackles, 61 interceptions and 99 clearances for a rampant Hull City this season. Where Robertson flourishes however is in attack. With 3 goals to his name, Andy also has 4 assists amongst 56 chances created this season.\n\nA lot hinges on the play off final outcome, but Robertson is one that Stoke should be monitoring very closely this summer.\n\nPhil Jones – Manchester United\n\nMake no mistake, this would be a terrific move. And a serious coup.\n\nA torrid season at Man United, in which he’d only played 7 games due to injury and being frozen out, finally came to an end last week. One of England’s regulars has been reduced to a forgotten memory, and it’s time for Stoke to rebuild him.\n\nHere’s my angle. We look at bringing him in as a defensive midfielder, competing an/or displacing Whelan. He can provide the energy, physicality and ability to let Imbula run the box to box tackles. Smart on the ball and quite a unit in stature, Jones would be a welcome addition to the midfield – and still only age 24. That’s long term planning, friends.\n\nVersatility means he could fill in capably at centre half and even at full back in emergencies. It’s one of the smartest pieces of business that Stoke could do this summer, in my view.\n\nJack Colback – Newcastle United\n\nDon’t let his below-par season at Newcastle fool you – there’s a real player in here.\n\nAs with Jones, Colback is a younger defensive midfielder than Glenn Whelan and can offer fresh legs in a position that’s unfortunately stagnated in our side.\n\nYounger DM, loves a tackle, had a terrific season at Sunderland prior to his move to Tyneside, completed more tackles than Whelan last season despite 8 fewer games. Needs to be careful (gets a lot of yellows) but Colback should definitely be a consideration for Hughes this summer as we aim to add depth to the defensive midfield role.\n\nNathan Redmond – Norwich City\n\nRumoured for a long time, and it looks like it could finally happen.\n\nStill only 22, despite being around for an eternity, Redmond is a dynamic winger who can operate on both flanks to great effect. 6 goals and 2 assists in a poor Norwich side, in which he wasn’t a starter for every game, is a steady amount for a wide player.\n\nYoung, bags of pace and creativity, can play either side and scores goals. Basically the perfect wing option. Recent strong displays for Norwich at the end of the season, and a classy showing for England U21’s to well to underline that. With £7m-£8m rumoured, Redmond should be the first deal of the summer for Stoke City.\n\nWill Hughes – Derby County\n\nBack from a long term injury, still highly rated. Will Hughes will be a terrific signing for someone this summer, and with some luck it could be Stoke.\n\nStill only 21, Hughes is remarkably smart on the ball. Sharp passing, movement and an eye for creating chances and goals. The only question mark is where he’d fit in to the Stoke side. Will he feature alongside Whelan and Imbula in a flatter 433 role, or will he rotate and rival Bojan for the #10 position?\n\nIt would seem the former may be the preferred approach, using him as a long term option to Ibrahim Afellay. If Hughes continues to mould the side into a 433, Will Hughes may become a serious target.\n\nandros Townsend – Newcastle United\n\nThe name on everyone’s lips, it seems. A strong end to the season with Newcastle, following a January move from Tottenham, has Andros Townsend very much in demand from all corners. From Stoke to Sporting Lisbon!\n\nA strongly rumoured £8m release clause, in line with Newcastle’s relegation, is probably the reason. It’d be hard to argue against value on the face of it, too.\n\nTownsend’s whole spiel is to maraud down the wing, cut inside onto his left and destroy anything in his wake. Which works terrifically well for the Inside Forward style approach that Mark Hughes is coaxing out of wide players.\n\nFor competition out wide and a player with the ability to win games, Stoke could do a lot worse than Andros Townsend.\n\nSaido Berahino – West Brom\n\nWe love a transfer saga don’t we? But few snuck up on us so abruptly than the Berahino bid rejection in January 2016. And boy it was weird.\n\nAnyway, rumour has it we’re set to bid again, but lord knows what the price will be – anywhere between £10m-£22.5m as it stands.\n\nHis attitude (obviously) comes into question, but it can be argued he’s been mistreated and would flourish in a caring environment. Stoke have done incredibly well to hone the likes of Arnautovic, who suffered similar, and turn them into devastating players. Berahino had already exploded onto the season in terrific fashion, sinking Manchester United amongst others in his breakthrough season. If Sparky coaxes the full potential out of Saido, we could finally have our 20 goal a season man.\n\nSubs\n\nDavid Marshall – Cardiff City\n\nHighly lauded in his Premier League stint with Cardiff, all has gone quiet on the Marshall front. That being said, he’s still a solid keeper and would offer quality to many squads.\n\nUnlike John Ruddy though, the chances of Marshall sacrificing the chance of being #1 to come and challenge as a #2 are slim, but Cardiff aren’t exactly tearing up trees in the Championship. Perhaps a European push may persuade him?\n\nCameron Borthwick-Jackson – Manchester United\n\nInjuries ruined Manchester United more than us this season, and yet youth graduates kept coming through for the Red Devils. One of the most exciting prospects was Borthwick-Jackson, a young left wing back with great pace and a solid delivery from out wide.\n\nAged 19, he’s young full back who’s at the perfect age for Stoke. Enough experience to stand in for games and learn from Erik without the expectation to want to play every Premier League game yet. He’s a free agent as it stands this summer – with Jose coming in I can’t imagine that will change. Get get him, Sparky.\n\nMichael Carrick – Manchester United\n\nA cultured professional and a classy footballer, few sides in the league wouldn’t benefit from Michael Carrick in their squad. Age 34, you’d imagine the only one he’d be competing with in terms of a position is Age 32 Glenn Whelan. It’s a potential move that doesn’t particularly scream “long-term planning” but Hughes often likes a proven veteran on a free transfer.\n\nJesse Lingard – Manchester United\n\nI’ll rob United of all their players, I swear. A sublime reflex finish to seal the FA Cup Final underlines the quality Lingard has, and his versatility across the front four positions is a terrific asset. His youth probably won’t hold him in high regard under Jose, and he’s more than welcome to come and fire in Stoke City’s FA Cup Final winner next season.\n\nJordan Ibe – Liverpool\n\nAn unlikely target, but it’d be worth a shot at the very least. Ibe seems to only be on the fringes at Liverpool, and with a summer for Klopp to rebuild his own side it could spell the end for Ibe amongst others. He’s more than good enough to get regular football here, with serious pace and strength to match it. He’s also known to score a handful, particularly from distance. Like a homegrown Shaqiri. Everyone will be happy.\n\nMatt Phillips – QPR\n\nProbably three years too late to be considered a brilliant transfer, but there’s an opportunity here nonetheless. A strong stint in the Premier league with QPR (including a Goal of the Season contender) only strengthened his case, yet no one seems to have come in for him.\n\nThere are question marks over attitude but his ability is unquestionable. 8 goals and 5 assists this season, deemed unspectacular, is still a decent haul. At the age of 25, Phillips could be a solid buy for depth out wide.\n\nDanny Ings – Liverpool\n\nFollowing a long spell out injured, Klopp has begun to build his Liverpool revolution without Danny Ings. Will there be room for him? A rich vein of form in his initial Premier League season with Burnley seemed to show signs of continuing at Liverpool, before an ACL stopped him in his tracks. Admittedly he’s likely to suit Klopp’s style more than Christian Benteke, but Danny Ings is certainly worth an enquiry this summer.\n\nThe Football League structure is going from strength to strength, with the quality and competition improving each season. Put simply, it’s probably the best it has ever been.\n\nWith the transfer window closed and the emergency loan window open, we’ve already started seeing some players move out to get regular game time. Dion Teixeira has gone to Fleetwood Town, whilst at lower levels we’ve seen Oli Roberts move to Tamworth and Dom Kurasik to Stafford Rangers, whilst Dale Eve is currently at Forest Green Rovers.\n\nSo who else from Stoke’s squad could benefit from a loan move for regular game time? We take a look at six possible candidates…\n\nJakob Haugaard – Goalkeeper\n\nWhat’s His Situation?\n\nVery little has been seen of Haugaard since a frankly incredible debut performance against Everton in the Asia Trophy. An appearance against Wrexham’s mixture of U21 and first teamers yielded a clean sheet for the stopper, but it isn’t the level in which he’ll progress at. In truth reports suggested he barely had a save to make.\n\nWhere Could He Go?\n\nWith no disrespect to the U21 setup, Haugaard gave a serious indication in pre season that he’s beyond that. He needs regular game time to prove he’s capable of making the eventual step up to the first team. Jakob is probably the highest rated talent that’s able to be loaned out at present, and I would expect any potential loan move to reflect this. If pre season is anything to go by, the Danish giant would strengthen any Championship side.\n\nExpectation: Championship – Top Half\n\nDan Bachmann – Goalkeeper\n\nWhat’s His Situation?\n\nBachmann enjoyed a very productive loan season at Wrexham during the 2014/2015 campaign either side of a relatively mid-term injury. The young Austrian keeper had a string of strong performances that had the Welsh faithful praising his performances and thanking him for his contribution over the course of the season.\n\nWhere Could He Go?\n\nA Championship move wouldn’t be outside the realms of possibility for Bachmann, but similarly he needs to go somewhere where he’ll get game time. His recent loan at Ross County was ended prematurely for what we assume was a lack of games, and he needs to avoid the similar outcome in his next loan spell. For this reason it may be more beneficial for him to move to a League One side, if it means more first team football.\n\nExpectation: League One – Mid Table\n\nEddy Lecygne – Defensive Midfielder\n\nThe arrival of Real Madrid C captain Sergi Molina, also a defensive midfielder, will increase competition further in the U21 ranks. Between Molina and Lecygne, it’s going to be one or the other missing out on game time. With Molina being a new addition from abroad, the bedding-in process is likely to mean that he remains within the development squad for now. So it may be time for Lecygne to take the plunge into the Football League.\n\nWhere Could He Go?\n\nIt’s new territory for Lecygne. There’s no telling where he could start or end, but the Football League will always have a place for a tough tackling and tidy midfielder in its clubs. Being realistic, a League One move would be best suited for him to begin with. It gives him a chance to find his feet within the league structure and to get regular game time in competitive matches. Perhaps the local clubs – Crewe and Port Vale – may take a look at him?\n\nExpectation: League One – Mid Table\n\nOllie Shenton – Dynamic Midfielder\n\nWhat’s His Situation?\n\nOllie Shenton has been the poster boy for Stoke’s academy since the beginning of last season. A first team debut against Portsmouth followed by a Premier League cameo against Man City gave the impression that we were going to have a youngster break into the first team.\n\nIt feels weird talking so definitively about a 17 year old, but it’s time. It really is time. Shenton needs a football league loan. The move from U18 to U21 was seamless for the youngster, and he’s shone at U21 level already. But now he needs to take the step to go out on loan and get real experience under his belt.\n\nWith the centre midfield battle fairly packed as it is within the first team, you get the impression Shenton won’t be able to force himself in just yet. He needs a loan.\n\nWhere Could He Go?\n\nThere were rumours a few weeks ago that Derby were interested in Shenton, which was a surprisingly good link for an initial loan move. Nothing materialised unfortunately and with time going on it seems like he may be better off looking elsewhere. The recurring theme with this blog is regular game time, and Shenton should prioritise that over necessarily moving to a top Championship club from the off.\n\nExpectation: Championship – Bottom Half\n\nMark Waddington – Imposing Box To Box Midfielder\n\nWhat’s His Situation?\n\nAlongside Dom Telford, Waddington joined Stoke in the summer from the unstable surroundings of Blackpool FC. He’s slotted in to Stoke’s U21 side seamlessly and has been winning plaudits for his early showings. Of course it comes as no surprise given that he already has Championship football under his belt.\n\nWhere Could He Go?\n\nThere’s a growing demand for imperious box to box midfielders in the modern game. We’ve seen it ourselves with Van Ginkel attempting to emulate Steven N’Zonzi’s impact on the side. Lower league is no different and you feel that with his experience and talent, Mark Waddington could make an impact back in the Championship at a mid table side. Playing regular football at such a level will improve him hugely and could give us our long-term N’Zonzi replacement.\n\nExpectation: Championship – Mid Table\n\nGeorge Waring – Technical Battering Ram\n\nWhat’s His Situation?\n\nWaring was one of the players who had a football league loan last season, taking a half season loan at Barnsley where he netted 6 goals in 18 appearances. A more than modest 1 in 3 strike rate, which isn’t bad at all for his first taste of the Football League.\n\nUnfortunately injury seemingly plagued his summer and has meant that his pre-season match time and the U21 fixtures to follow have been somewhat few and far between. He’s only played for the U21’s twice since he left Barnsley, and will need regular game time at this point in his career to avoid stagnating.\n\nWhere Could He Go?\n\nDespite a good return in the initial loan spell, you feel like Waring may be playing for a move to a club chasing promotion within the league this time around. He’s slightly older than some of the U21 squad and will be wanting to make a career out of the game, so his approach will be to go out and impress for a transfer. A loan move to a side within League One gives him another chance to shine and develop within an ever-improving league structure.\n\nExpectation: League One – Top Half\n\nDom Telford – Technical Finisher\n\nWhat’s His Situation?\n\nNow here’s an interesting case. Dom Telford actually moved into Stoke’s U21 side from first team football at Blackpool. However a move to a Premier League club and a stable environment was the justification for the move, and Telford has already praised the club for all he’s learning thus far. A promising cameo in pre season saw him score a sharp finish against Wrexham, whilst his U21 performances have also been fruitful, with 2 goals in 6 appearances thus far.\n\nWhere Could He Go?\n\nGiven he’s just arrived from a Championship side, it would be unfair for Dom to move anywhere lower than that. Especially given that he started well for Blackpool and shone in some performances. A loan move into the chasing pack of the Championship, maybe in a front two of sorts, will help Telford to get the regular game time he needs.\n\nExpectation: Championship – Mid Table\n\nWe asked Stoke fans who they’d loan out…\n\nhttps://twitter.com/hayden_w_10/status/651828897890332672\n\nThe window creaked shut with a whimper, as a drawn out deadline day ended with no new additions following the collapse of a late Mile Jedinak deal (Boo! – Sam). Keen to draw out the positives for the seemingly never-ending summer, the 4231 team downed tools and got together to review the club’s business during the window.\n\nWHAT IMPRESSED YOU MOST ABOUT THE TRANSFER WINDOW?\n\nChris: I was particularly impressed by the fields of influence we now find ourselves operating in in the transfer market. We’ve certainly increased the quality of our squad and attracted an entirely new type of player. I also loved that Mark Hughes is essentially signing my Stoke team from Football Manager 2012, we won the title in 2017…but that was with Danny Welbeck up front, so maybe it’s not entirely realistic to think that that is just around the corner!\n\nJase: Breaking a transfer record, signing a world class player, strengthening the key areas of the side and building for the future in academy signings. All for a net spend which was the second lowest of the entire league. HUGHES THAT.\n\nMoz: Aiming high, we got the one big fish that was promised, and if it was not for mental Ukrainian owners – who knows what could have been?\n\nSam: The speed and ruthlessness that we showed in working through our targets once the window had actually opened was extremely pleasing to see. Also the depth to our transfer team’s work as we addressed key areas, not just from the previous season but also on the fly as a certain player left.\n\nWHO WAS YOUR BEST SIGNING OF THE WINDOW?\n\nChris: In terms of pure excitement, it’s got to be Shaqiri. I never thought I would see the day where a player of such quality, and such reputation would sign for Stoke. Him aside, I got quite excited by Shay Given…Sam alluded to it in an earlier piece, but it’s ace to see someone of his class in a Stoke shirt, even if it is a good few years after I would have liked.\n\nJase: I’m going to have to be boring on this one, and go for Shaqiri. I had visions of Hughes’ deal for Odemwingie signalling that we’d go another season without a first choice right winger, and thankfully he proved me wrong with a £12m deal that could well prove to be a steal in these absurd times. If he settles and clicks quickly, we’re a whole new side up top.\n\nMoz: It is a toss up between signing Shaqiri and Wilson telling the world he is still here until 2018.\n\nSam: This is a really tough call for all the right reasons, last year I jinxed Steve Sidwell (sorry Ginger Scholes) but this year from incoming signings it’s probably Glen Johnson. I’ve been a big critic of the right back but he’s coming into the right club for his level and I’ll be honest, anything that keeps Phil Bardsley out of the team is a plus in my eyes. Marco van Ginkel is a close shout and would’ve been my pick if it had been a permanent deal. There’s a hell of a player in there and he could – in time – combine the driving runs of N’Zonzi with the defensive work of Whelan. Also worth mentioning Geoff Cameron’s new deal. This guy is proving all of his critics wrong and showing that he’s a great player. Shawcross might struggle to win his place back by January.\n\nWHO WAS THE BIGGEST RISK?\n\nChris: Afraid it’s going to be Joselu. The amount we paid for him may be little in terms of what some other clubs have paid this summer, but any striker coming into this Stoke team will always have that “He’s not a 15-20 goal a season striker!” shouted at them as soon as they miss a sitter.\n\nJase: Strikers are always likely to be slaughtered more than any other player, because scoring from armchairs is easy business. For that I really consider Joselu as the biggest risk. He’s been brought in to replace Peter Crouch, who’s been regularly top scorer in recent years, and to provide competition for Mame Diouf, currently in the form of his Stoke career. There is pressure from all sides for him to succeed, and he’s barely had a kick of the ball in the league as of yet. He’ll need time to adjust as with all signings, but you better believe he’ll be given grief if the risk fails to come off.\n\nMoz: Joselu, cost big money, shown glimpses, but his performance vs Luton was Pericard-esque, obviously needs time, but for so much money, needs to deliver a lot quicker than others.\n\nSam: The entire fate of Mark Hughes’ Potteries Blaugrana project rests heavily on the success of each new acquisition, while Muniesa and Bojan have proved early successes the signing of Moha will take time to develop, so for me the biggest risk is Afellay. The oldest of the Catalan – ok not really! – recruits Afellay should be the most ready to make an impact, however it also means that he’s the least malleable. We’ve already seen the fiery side to the Dutch prodigy, if he can control that fire into quality performances then we could have something special. If he can’t however, any new comings will be tinged with an edge of trepidation rather than raw excitement.\n\nHOW DOES THIS WINDOW COMPARE TO HUGHES’ PREVIOUS WINDOWS?\n\nChris: I’ve felt this has been the best window under Hughes so far. The crazy levels of Bojan euphoria were beaten by Shaq-Mania, we strengthened our team in areas necessary, and bought youngsters for the future. Folks will point to the lack of a DM or the signing of a last minute CB as a failure, but personally I think our team will grow and work together. The partnership of Muniesa and Cameron will develop over the weeks, and will find their rhythm, and Van Ginkel will find his feet (I thought he was one of our most determined and best players in the West Brom battle).\n\nJase: Once we kept Walters on the last day, I’d argue against popular opinion but I think this is the most complete window we’ve had under Hughes. We needed a first choice right winger and got Xherdan Shaqiri. Hate him all you like but Wollscheid came in to provide options at centre back, whilst Afellay and Van Ginkel offer central cover to fill the N’Zonzi void. We signed Joselu to freshen up the attack behind Diouf and covered Begovic’s bench position with Given and the surprisingly impressive Haugaard. It may not have been the perfect window for everyone, but I’m extremely happy with how it’s gone. I even like Glen Johnson now!\n\nMoz: We signed Shaq-attaq!! Even though some think we have not got the players we needed (obviously suffer from goldfish syndrome) – we were desperate for a right back – got one, desperate for a winger – got one, needed a N’Zonzi replacement – got one (albeit needs time), experienced backup goalkeeper – got one. Ideally another winger would have been perfect at the start of it and I would not have complained if we managed to get a left back and defensive midfielder in, but our most needed players we got in.\n\nSam: This was very much a summer of putting the finishing touches to a very strong squad with much needed improvements at right back and out wide while fleshing out a few of the shallower areas of the team and we were well on course to do that prior to N’Zonzi leaving. That left us with a few questions in the centre of midfield but it’s been evident to me so far that we have enough about us there to not have to worry too much. We were also in an excellent position to pick and choose the necessary players, unlike previous windows where it was a case of getting any quality we could in as soon as possible and fleshing out areas of the team with no players.\n\nHOW FAR CAN THE CURRENT SIDE GO?\n\nChris: Oh god. I don’t want to be conservative, but I would be more than happy with another top 10 finish. This year will be a bigger battle than ever, despite our record signing. It will take us time to work things out, but things will click. For me it’s just a matter of how long it takes for that to happen. If we hit that early, we can reach 7th. That’s what the team seem to want to aim for anyway…and with a bit of belief in the squad it is perfectly possible. I’ll accept 11th, be happy with 9th, ecstatic with 7th.\n\nJase: I said before the season started that I’d happily take 11th place, and I stand by that for the course of the season. The signings will need to gel in a notoriously slow spell for Hughes’ sides, so expect a few more frustrating weeks before things start to click. I think there’s an outside chance of the Top 10 this season, but I feel like this is a season of revolution rather than evolution.\n\nMoz: Similar to what last season did, realistically we are close to the ceiling, and people need to realise this – we have had our spine ripped out and it will take time for it to adjust, but glimpses of quality and the heart they have shown makes me comfortable, with Shaqiri and Bojan, we could be a delight to watch and a headache for the League.\n\nSam: It’s very hard to say just how far this side could go. At full strength as a first team XI it’s not incomparable to sides that have spent far vaster sums of money. There are very few players in the Liverpool or Spurs XI’s that we’ve faced this season that I’d swap for their corresponding Stoke player. That said we don’t really have the quality in depth of either of those clubs so right now 7th would probably be our limit in the best of cases. Maintaining our top half status has to be the minimum target though.\n\nSTOKE FANS’ THREE WORD WINDOW\n\nSome were quite pleased with the business:\n\nThere was special praise for Shaqiri:\n\nA few expressed concerns:\n\nOthers got a tad sarcastic:\n\nA couple fired shots:\n\nAnd one is off our Christmas card list:\n\nFranco Di Santo\n\nReports in Germany (primarily Bild) suggested that both Stoke and Sunderland were looking at the Werder Bremen striker, with a rumoured £8m-£10m price-tag. Di Santo is a name majority of you will be familiar with as he spending the majority of his career on these shores with Chelsea, Blackburn Rovers and Wigan Athletic. He arrived as a fresh faced teen who had been making waves in Chile for Audax Italiano as a young teenager which gained him attention from Chelsea, who signed the then 18 year old for £3.4m in January 2008 – he left The Los Tanos scoring 13 goals in 55 League Appearances*.\n\nHe was a reserves player for Chelsea for the remainder of the 07/08 season with 12 goals, in 8 games – this saw him promoted to the first team for pre-season; but with Chelsea’s superstar team he failed to make an impact making all of his 8 appearances for the Blues coming off the bench*. Chelsea sorted him a loan move, he then spent a season at Blackburn; but he failed to make an impact and was dropped towards then end of the season with just 1 goal in 22 appearances – this was obviously not to the standard of Chelsea and was sold to Wigan for £2m.\n\nHe spent 3 years in Lancashire, his first season he was in out of the starting XI; the following 2 seasons he was a main feature of a constantly struggling Wigan side until they final got relegated; he made 92 appearances, scoring 13 goals for The Lactics*. He was released by Wigan, and joined Germans Werder Bremen on a free transfer. His time in Germany has been a successful one thus far, he has improved an awful lot, showing a bit of the potential Chelsea saw back in 2008; this season his goalscoring record has been so impressive he is actually the joint 4th top goalscorer with 13 goals (alongside Bas Dost, Thomas Mueller and & Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang) with only Alex Meier, Arjen Robben & Robert Lewandowski ahead of the Argentine. All this, has been a bit of a waste – as Mark Hughes confirmed he had no interest in signing him.\n\nClaudio Beauvue\n\nA player linked last season, but according to FranceFootball – Stoke, Hull and Everton are once again looking at the Guadelopean striker of Guingamp following a very fruitful season, scoring 22 goals in all competitions. It is very likely the striker will leave the team from Brittany with interest both over here in the United Kingdom and a few bigger French sides. It may come a bit of a surprise that he is only in his third season in Ligue 1 spending most of his time in Ligue 2 with Troyes (98 league appearances; 17 goals)* and Chateauroux (58 league appearances; 16 goals)*, not exactly outstanding. But since his arrival in North-West France he has sprung to life and the 27 year old has become a secret gem of French football. I personally think this is just a rehash of last season’s rumours, his stock may have raised to a level we are looking at – I just don’t see this happening.\n\nJavier Hernandez aka Chicharito\n\nThe man of the moment in Madrid, even if he has been used bit part for the Champions League Semi-Finalists this season; following a surprising loan move to the Spanish capital. The Manchester United man is largely appreciated in these circles with his excellent goalscoring record vs The Potters. Although a talented player – he has been largely used as a superb sub in his time at Old Trafford; certainly a player of his talents should be playing regular football. It is quite astonishing he will turn 27 at the start of next season and a move is definitely on the cards – obviously being a striker West Ham are strongly linked with a £7m for the Mexican; you would feel Stoke as a club could be in with a good shout of getting him with location, league standing, a well respected club, regular game time – but the big question is, how would he fit in to the system? Will we be interested? Almost definitely, but the question is – how many larger clubs will also have a passing interest? I expect a lot.\n\nRudy Gestede\n\nAs it was very obscure, I will not spend too much time on this; but Stoke alongside other sides, specifically Swansea have been linked with the Benin international. The big target man has come into his own since arriving at Ewood Park following 2 seasons in South Wales with Swansea’s arch rivals Cardiff. A player Stoke came into close quarters with this season in the FA Cup, destroying the defence for the entire game as they ran out 4-1 winners. A player I saw great potential in him since his Cardiff days. He will be linked all Summer, and for me it can go either way – Blackburn will either be bold, keep him as the eye promotion back to the Premier League, or the Venky’s will see easy big profit on a player they bought for a nominal fee.\n\nSven van Beek\n\nOne of the most exciting youth prospects to come out the Feyenoord academy that has produced a string of exceptional players in the past few years; Leroy Fer, Robin Van Persie and Daryl Janmaat to name a few who have impacted the premier league. Van Beek is a forward thinking central defender, comfortable on the ball and strong in the tackle. However his most important trait is his reading of the game and his ability to intercept passes that put many in mind of the Dutch giant Jaap Stam. The potential is also there for van Beek to reach similar heights to Stam.\n\nThe central defender actually made his first start for Feyenoord at right back, replacing Janmaat who had fallen ill. He acquitted himself well in the game and looked incredibly calm and composed for a youth team graduate of just 18 years old. With the summer exodus from the Feyenoord defence (Janmaat, De Vrij and Bruno Martens Indi all moved on) leaving a gap to be filled van Beek stepped in, making 28 appearances, to become the keystone of a defence, average age just 21, that has conceded only 31 goals this season. If van Beek is available for a reasonable price then it’s a deal that Stoke should complete without a second thought, it’s unlikely however that van Beek will come cheap. Anything under £5m would be a bargain.\n\n* All stats came from SoccerAssociation.com"
