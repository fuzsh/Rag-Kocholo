        "text": "We saw a total of 36 goals over the ten Eerste Divisie games this weekend, Will Burns is here with all the action.\n\nGo Ahead Eagles are the frontrunners at the top of the table after two games, however only on goal difference as TOP Oss, RKC Waalwijk and Roda JC, like the Eagles, have won both of their games.\n\nJohn Stegeman’s Go Ahead defeated FC Eindhoven 2-1 thanks to goals from Istvan Bakx and Richard van der Venne. Debutant Portuguese winger Marcelo Lopes replied for Eindhoven.\n\nTOP Oss smashed Jong PSV 4-1 as Huseyin Dogan (2), Norichio Nieveld and Bryan Smeets got on the scoresheet.\n\nFive goals were shared as RKC defeated FC Den Bosch 3-2. Mario Bilate grabbed a brace in his first goals for the club since moving from FC Emmen in the summer.\n\nMario Engles (mobbed in the picture above) hit a double last week against Jong Ajax and managed another two in a 2-1 win over Almere City this week to give Roda JC their second win. I said in the Eerste Divisie season preview that the German would make an impact this season but I did not expect him to notch four goals at this stage.\n\nResults\n\nFriday 24th August\n\nAlmere City 1-2 Roda JC\n\nFC Den Bosch 2-3 RKC Waalwijk\n\nFC Eindhoven 1-2 Go Ahead Eagles\n\nHelmond Sport 2-2 FC Twente\n\nJong Ajax 5-2 FC Dordrecht\n\nSC Cambuur 2-1 Jong AZ Alkmaar\n\nSparta Rotterdam 2-0 FC Volendam\n\nTelstar 0-1 MVV Maastricht\n\nTOP Oss 4-1 Jong PSV\n\nMonday 27th August\n\nJong Utrecht 1-2 N.E.C. Nijmegen\n\nClick the name above to follow Will on Twitter.\n\nTotalDutchFootball.com\n\nThe first week of the Eerste Divisie is complete and as usual it was a weekend full of goals with only one goalless draw across the fixtures. Will Burns is on hand to describe the action.\n\nThe big winners this week were Go Ahead Eagles who thrashed Jong FC Utrecht by five goals. It was the dream start for new coach John Stegeman as Richard van der Venne notched the opener on 22 minutes and defender Gino Bosz doubled the scoring by half-time. Thomas Verheijdt, Maarten Pouwels and Paco van Moorsel completed the rout after the break to send the De Adelaarshorst faithful home optimistic about the new campaign ahead.\n\nOn Monday night, Almere City defeated Jong AZ as the era of Michele Santoni began. The Italian left his role as Technical Coach for Cagliari in the summer to up sticks to the Netherlands and began life with a 3-2 win. It was eventful game that saw Almere three goals to the good before half-time with goals from Niek Vossebelt, Tim Receveur and Stijn Meijer. Almere left-back Moustpha Seck was shown red for a foul in the area and AZ’s Jelle Duin missed the spot-kick. AZ got a goal back against the ten-men through Tijani Reijnders and Ferdy Druijf scored in stoppgae time but there’s where the comeback ended.\n\nIn the Eindhoven derby, Jong PSV came from behind to dispatch FC Eindhoven 2-1 at De Herdgang. The visitors took an early lead when Siebe van der Heyden rose like a salmon to beat Dirk Abels to head home a 6th minute free-kick. However, Zakaria Aboukhlal equalised in first-half stoppage to level the game up with a long range effort that took a deflection. Full-back Jordan Teze found himself in unfamiliar territory to hit PSV’s winner.\n\nFormer Eredivisie champions FC Twente had a successful start to the campaign at home to fellow relegated side Sparta Rotterdam. German loanee striker Ulrich Bapoh notched after ten minutes played but former Nottingham Forest target man Lars Veldwijk equalised in the 16th. Tom Boere converted a penalty before half-time to wrap the game up for Twente.\n\nElsewhere, SC Cambuur clawed back a 2-0 deficit away to N.E.C. to take a point back to Leeuwarden with two late goals. Anass Achahbar, formerly of Feyenoord, and Sven Braken gave Nijmegen to lead only for Frank Sturing to score in the wrong goal three minutes from time. Full-back Emmanuel Mbende was the hero notching five minutes in stoppage time to make it 2-2 and send the away fans home in jubilation.\n\nRoda JC dispatched last year’s champions Jong Ajax thanks to two goals from German winger Mario Engels (pictured above) in a 2-1 victory.\n\nThere was further wins for RKC Waalwijk, TOP Oss and FC Den Bosch before the weekend was over while FC Dordrecht and Helmond Sport played a goalless draw.\n\nResults\n\nFriday 17th August\n\nFC Dordrecht 0-0 Helmond Sport\n\nGo Ahead Eagles 5-0 Jong FC Utrecht\n\nJong PSV 2-1 FC Eindhoven\n\nMVV Maastricht 0-2 TOP Oss\n\nN.E.C. 2-2 SC Cambuur\n\nRoda JC 2-1 Jong Ajax\n\nFC Twente 2-1 Sparta Rotterdam\n\nFC Volendam 1-2 FC Den Bosch\n\nRKC Waalwijk 1-0 Telstar\n\nMonday 20th August\n\nJong AZ 2-3 Almere City\n\nClick the name above to follow Will on Twitter.\n\nTotalDutchFootball.com\n\nA total of 20 teams will take part each week in the Eerste Divisie, also known as the Jupiler League. It will be the fifty-ninth edition of the competition, since its establishment in 1955. The season will run from the beginning of August 2014 until May 2015, as teams fight for promotion into the Dutch top flight – the Eredivisie.\n\nAfter facing relegation last season from the Eredivisie, Roda JC Kerkrade will begin their new campaign in the Eerste Divisie, also joined by NEC Nijmegen and RKC Waalwijk also faced relegation but this time through the playoff rounds after finishing second and third from bottom in the top flight last season. All three clubs will be hoping that their time spent in the Eerste Divisie will be short lived, as they battle for promotion during the 2014/15 campaign.\n\nWANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE DUTCH DOMESTIC LEAGUE?\n\nOnly the club that tops the table at the end of the season guarantees themselves automatic promotion to the Eredivisie. Teams finishing between second and fifth will enter the second round of the Eredivisie promotion/relegation play-offs, which also gives the sides a chance to qualify for the top flight.\n\nThere is also a slight chance for teams who finish the season between sixth and ninth to gain entry into the Eredivisie, as the teams will also enter the Eredivisie play-offs in the first round of the knockout format. The rest of the ten teams finishing from 10th to last will remain in the Eerste Divisie for the following season.\n\nWHO ARE FAVOURITES TO GAIN PROMOTION?\n\nWithout a doubt the main objective for the three clubs that have been relegated to the Eerste Divisie will be hoping that they can rejoin the top sides next season, but other clubs such as FC Den Bosch, VVV-Venlo, FC Eindhoven and De Graafschap will all be hoping they can finish in a promotion place, whether it be a round one or two entry into the playoff faze, they will still be in with a chance to gain promotion.\n\nThere is also an odd side chance that FC Volendam and Fortuna Sittard may upset the odds and surprise many this season, a chance to battle for a place in the Dutch top flight means high attendees in the ground on match day, which no club would refuse, considering the impotents of finance in clubs these recent years. The league will be occupied by three reserve teams from Dutch giants – Jong Ajax , Jong PSV and Jong FC Twente. Last season, the PSV youngsters managed to finish ahead of the other two’s ‘B’ teams and ended the season in tenth with a + 5 Goal difference. It is impossible for any of these three sides to gain promotion, due to the fact the clubs already have teams in the top flight.\n\nThere is four sides that I believe will struggle to compete in the league this season, they are Almere City , FC Oss , Telstar and Achilles ’29. These sides appear not to have the strength in their squad to compete for any type of silverware or promotion this coming season. All four sides ended the season on a minus goal difference last campaign, and that may not change come the end of the 2015/16 season.\n\nUsually in the Eerste Divisie matches are played on a Friday evening at 7pm (BST) and this weekend is the opening weekend of games in the league.\n\nWHY SHOULD YOU WATCH THE EERSTE DIVISIE 2014/15 SEASON?\n\n– Remember the Dutch legend Jaap Stam? Well, he will manage Jong Ajax this season as he attempts to bring his experience to the players of future who hope to break into Frank de Boer’s Ajax side.\n\n– Other popular names such as Ruud Kaiser will manage the FC Den Bosch side, Kaiser coached Dutch stars such as Robin Van Persie , Wesley Sneijder , Nigel de Jong and several other current Dutch internationals as he coached the Dutch in the 2005 European Under-17 Championship.\n\n– Many young stars are loaned out from major clubs in the Netherlands to smaller clubs, where they get the chance to show their qualities and learn their trade\n\n– Not forgetting that the fans and atmosphere each week is not to be forgotten as the crowds for the Dutch first division continues to grow.\n\nWHERE YOU CAN FIND OUT MORE?\n\nEvery week here at Total Dutch Football, I will doing a ‘Game of the Week’ feature and weekly round-up for the league so stay tuned for full coverage of the 2014/15 season.\n\nClick on Kalkeren’s name to follow him on Twitter\n\nWillem II are now the favourites to earn the automatic promotion spot to the Eredivisie after overcoming league leaders FC Dordrecht 3-1 on Friday night. The Tilburg side stay in second but are now just one point adrift from the top spot with a game in hand over their rivals.\n\nWillem’s top scorer Ruud Boymans, on loan from AZ Alkmaar, lead his side to the all-important victory scoring a double including the opener after just three minutes. Brazilian forward Bruno Andrade got the second just after the half-hour mark to send the hosts in two goals to the good. As Dordrecht pressed for goals to try and get back into the game, Boymans hit his second on 68 minutes to cement all three points. The visitors got a last minute consolation goal through Paul Gladon but Dordrecht will be hoping that De Graafschap can do them a favour on Wednesday, when Willem II travel to Doetinchem in their game in hand.\n\nThe biggest win of the weekend was Excelsior 8-0 drubbing of Telstar in game which saw the Rotterdam side five goals up at half-time. Eerste Divisie top scorer Lars Veldwijk took his tally to 25 goals in 33 games with a hat-trick as fellow striker Kevin Vermeulen notched a brace. Scoring was complete by Moroccan midfielder Adil Auassar, Ricky Kruys and Lars Hutten netting the other three goals.\n\nThird-placed VVV Venlo maintain their playoff position with a 2-1 home victory over FC Emmen, thanks to goals from Oguzhan Tuerk and Prince Rajcomar after Ronald Bergkamp had grabbed a equaliser for the away side.\n\nRESULTS\n\nFriday 4th April\n\nWILLEM II 3 – 1 FC DORDRECHT\n\nVVV VENLO 2 – 1 FC EMMEN\n\nFC OSS 0 – 3 ALMERE CITY\n\nTELSTAR 0 – 8 EXCELSIOR\n\nHELMOND SPORT 0 – 1 FC VOLENDAM\n\nSaturday 5th April\n\nMVV 3 – 0 ACHILLES ‘29\n\nSPARTA ROTTERDAM 2 – 3 FORTUNA SITTARD\n\nSunday 6th April\n\nJONG TWENTE 2 – 1 DE GRAAFSCHAP\n\nMonday 7th April\n\nJONG PSV 1 – 2 DEN BOSCH\n\nJONG AJAX 1 – 4 FC EINDHOVEN\n\nSTANDINGS\n\nLeague table courtesy of WhoScored.com\n\nClick the name above to follow Will on Twitter.\n\nTotalDutchFootball.com WorldFootballWeekly.com\n\nWith only seven games taking place due to a large amount of police presence issued to work this week’s Nuclear Security Summit 2014 in Den Haag, only two of the top five played with both coming out on top.\n\nSecond-placed Willem II were not in action this past Friday evening which allowed FC Dordrecht to stretch their lead to four points on Friday night with a 3-1 victory over Jong Twente. Youri Leon put the league leaders ahead after 20 minutes but soon after the half-time break, Kristopher Vida equalised for the Twente reserve side. Two goals in the last six minutes courtesy of Paul Gladon and Genaro Snijders clinched the victory.\n\nVVV-Venlo comfortably sit in third four points ahead of Excelsior in fourth with a hard-fought 3-2 win over FC Oss. Venlo took a first-half lead through a Leon de Kogel penalty, which was the strikers 11th goal of the campaign. After Jorzolino Falkenstein equalised just before the hour mark, VVV stepped it up a gear and regained the lead nine minutes later with Oguzhan Turk grabbing the goal.

The division’s top scorer Robert Mühren notched twice to take his tally to 23 in 27 games with a Ludcinio Marengo goal in injury time to seal the win. PSV’s young central defender Menno Koch scored a second-half penalty which proved to be nothing but a consolation.\n\nRonald Bergkamp scored the only goal of the game in FC Emmen’s win over FC Eindhoven as the highly-rated Abdelmalek El Hasnaout notched Jong Ajax’s only goal in their 1-0 away win to Fortuna Sittard.\n\nHelmond Sport and Telstar cancelled each other in a 1-1 draw with an early Serhat Koç goal giving the hosts the leas but a late Toine van Huizen leveller meant the points were shared.\n\nDown at the bottom, Achilles ’29 gained a point at home to Sparta Rotterdam but they still sit rock bottom on just 22 points.\n\nRESULTS\n\nFriday 21st March\n\nFC EMMEN 1 – 0 FC EINDHOVEN\n\nFC VOLENDAM 3 – 1 JONG PSV\n\nFC DORDRECHT 3 – 1 JONG TWENTE\n\nACHILLES ’29 1 -1 SPARTA ROTTERDAM\n\nVVV VENLO 3 – 2 FC OSS\n\nFORTUNA SITTARD 0 – 1 JONG AJAX\n\nHELMOND SPORT 1 – 1 TELSTAR\n\nSTANDINGS\n\nLeague table courtesy of WhoScored.com\n\nClick the name above to follow Will on Twitter.\n\nTotalDutchFootball.com WorldFootballWeekly.com\n\nOn Friday evening the most unlikely result of the Eerste Divisie season so far was witnessed as 19th place FC Oss handed 15th place FC Emmen an unbelievable EIGHT-nil pasting writes Will Burns.\n\nThe relegation threatened FC Oss have been improving in recent weeks but no-one expected a score like the one we saw on Friday evening. Dennis Janssen opened the scoring after a quarter of an hour before Jonathan Opuku and Lorenzo Pique added to the tally before half-time.

Ryan Sansai and Guyon Phillips added to the rout before Maletic grabbed his brace to send Emmen home with their tails between their legs.\n\nFC Dordrecht grabbed top spot after a great 2-0 away win against title rivals VVV Venlo on Friday night. Paul Gladon gave the visitors the lead in the first half before Giovanni Korte added a second in second half stoppage time.

Ruud Boymans scored his 20th of the season and Terell Ondaan add a second to fire the Tilburg side ahead but PSV full-back Joshua Brenet grabbed on what was thought to be an 85th minute consolation for the home side. The PSV reserve side did not give up and in the final kick of the game Alex Schalk scored the equaliser to send Willem II back to Tilburg with just the point.\n\nExcelsior missed the chance to go in third falling at home by the single goal to MVV Maastricht. Twenty-one-year-old Belgian midfielder Marco Ospitalieri notched the only goal of the game.\n\nDe Graafschap moved up to fifth with a 2-0 win away to Telstar thanks to the young strikeforce of Nathan Kabasele and Vincent Vermeij notching the all important goals.\n\nJong Ajax came from behind to defeat Achilles ’29 in a great 2-1 win on Saturday. The part-timers went ahead through Thijs Hendriks on 54 minutes before Serbian winger Dejan Meleg equalised just after the hour mark.

Sparta hosted the league leaders on Saturday knowing that they were yet to be beaten at home, but it all went wrong for Sparta in the first half as Dordrecht managed to lead 0-3 at the break thanks to goals by Gladon, Meulens and Danso. Sparta did pull back to 2-3 in the second half and even got the opportunity to level the game, but Bilate failed from short distance.\n\nFC Eindhoven benefited from Sparta’s loss by easily beating Achilles ’29 at the Jan Louwers Stadion. Three Eindhoven goals before half time meant they could sit back and relax after the break, in which Achilles scored a consolation goal to make it 3-1.\n\nThe day before these two matches, FC Den Bosch went back to winning ways. After two trashings against Dordrecht and Sparta, they beat Helmond Sport 3-1 at home with goals from Van Den Broek and Quekel in the last twenty minutes. Willem II humiliated Almere City by putting five behind Van Duin. The win keeps them in fourth place, seven points behind Dordrecht. Meanwhile, bottom of the table side Oss got a draw against in-form Excelsior to keep the pressure on Achilles and Almere City. The first half was most exciting as all four goals were scored before the break.\n\nJong Twente and Jong PSV both grabbed wins in their fixtures. Twente had an easy game against Telstar (3-0), while Jong PSV continued their run by beating mid-table rivals MVV Maastricht 3-2 in an interesting match. Jong PSV now find themselves fiercely involved in the period title battle with 16 points from the last 7 games.\n\nTheir run contrasts sharply with that of rivals Jong Ajax, who lost their seventh game in a row, this time in a 1-2 defeat at home to De Graafschap. Although the Ajax reserves did grab a lead through former De Graafschap man Sam Hendriks, De Graafschap eventually got the win. First, De Graafschap were lucky as Ajax were denied a free kick, followed up by a quick counter attack that Anco Jansen finished off. Then, in the second half, Martina got sent off for allegedly bringing down Vincken in the box, although Vincken himself indicated he was not sure if it was a foul. Parzyszek scored the following penalty kick to score the final goal of the game, 1-2.\n\nFULL RESULTS\n\nFriday 8th November 2013\n\nFC Den Bosch 3-1 Helmond Sport\n\nFC Oss 2-2 Excelsior Rotterdam\n\nFortuna Sittard 2-0 FC Emmen\n\nJong FC Twente 3-0 Telstar\n\nWillem II 5-0 Almere City\n\nSaturday 9th November\n\nSparta Rotterdam 2-3 FC Dordrecht\n\nFC Eindhoven 3-1 Achilles ‘29\n\nSunday 10th November\n\nFC Volendam 1-1 VVV Venlo\n\nMonday 11th November\n\nJong Ajax 1-2 De Graafschap\n\nJong PSV 3-2 MVV Maastricht\n\n————-\n\nClick on Joost’s name above to follow him on Twitter and also visit his blog at FM Holland.\n\nTotalDutchFootball.com WorldFootballWeekly.com\n\nWEEK 15\n\nFC Oss take three points, Eindhoven win key match\n\nFC Oss will no doubt be delighted with this weekend as they finally managed to get their third win of the season by winning 1-2 De Geusselt in Maastricht.

After the 7-1 loss last weekend, Den Bosch now find themselves in 17th place with just three points from their last six games.\n\nAlmere City managed to grab a point against Fortuna Sittard, moving past Achilles ’29, who lost against Volendam on Saturday, and again on Tuesday against Sparta Rotterdam. Sparta had also won their match on Saturday (away to Emmen), which means Sparta are now only 1 point away from first place and firmly on top in the second period table.\n\nFC Eindhoven had an amazing match as they visited De Graafschap. With Willem II surprisingly losing 3-1 to Telstar on Friday, the game at De Vijverberg in Doetinchem meant a battle for third place. An excellent performance by the boys from Eindhoven meant they took the three points back home.\n\nHelmond Sport once again proved they don’t give up easily as they beat Jong Ajax 3-2 after going 0-2 down. Hoesen scored an amazing lob ball for Jong Ajax but it turned out to be not enough for the Amsterdammers. Rivals Jong PSV extended their great run of form with a surprising 0-2 win over recently relegated VVV Venlo, while Excelsior managed to grab all points against Jong FC Twente.

The hosts opened the scoring with Jeffrey Fortes after 17 minutes but MVV’s Tom van Hyfte got the leveller before the break. After referee Rogier Honig showed Marvin Peersman the red card on 55 minutes, Giovanni Korte got the winner with twenty minutes remaining against the run of play.\n\nAfter a goal-less first half, goals from Abdelaziz Khalouta and a Vlatko Lazic own goal in the second period gave Fortuna Sittard a 2-0 win against the travelling De Graafschap. And the game between FC Eindhoven and VVV Venlo ended without either team finding the net.\n\nAfter just eight minutes into the game, Excelsior‘s Lars Veldwijk and Helmond Sport’s Ferry de Regt collided heads and had to be both substituted. Excelsior took the lead with Lars Hutten on 33 minutes but Helmond replied straight from the restart with a Serhat Koc goal.

The now-defunct SC Veendam, who went bankrupt last month, is removed from the list, while FC Emmen have dropped into Category 1 from the last report.\n\nMark Boetekees, who is responsible for the KNVB report is pleased with the progress. “It’s good to see that clubs now realise that a good and consistent financial policy is important. They must continue to work on financial recovery to ensure that their future is secure.”\n\nIn total they are 23 of the 34 professional clubs in the safe category 2. These are: AZ, FC Den Bosch, SC Cambuur, FC Dordrecht FC Eindhoven, Excelsior, Feyenoord, De Graafschap, Helmond Sport Heracles Almelo, MVV Maastricht, NAC Breda, NEC, RKC Waalwijk Roda JC, Sparta Rotterdam, Telstar, FC Twente, FC Utrecht, Vitesse, VVV-Venlo, Willem II and PEC Zwolle.\n\nEight clubs are in excellent financial condition and are listed in Category 3: Ajax, Almere City FC, Go Ahead Eagles, FC Groningen, Heerenveen, FC Oss, PSV and FC Volendam.\n\nAll clubs have to submit their figures to the federation for the year 2013/14 by the next financial assessment, which will be on June 15.\n\n——-\n\nClick the name above to follow Will on Twitter.\n\n——-\n\nhttp://TotalDutch.wordpress.com\n\nhttp://www.WorldFootballWeekly.com"
