        "text": "From 2014:\n\nFormer Belmont University men's soccer standout Nico Olsak (Boca Raton, Fla.) is currently playing professionally in Israel.\n\nOlsak, who graduated with honors following the 2013 campaign as the program's career leader in assists (25) and fifth in points (47), is playing for Maccabi Kabilio Jaffa FC in the Liga Alef.\n\nhttp://www.belmontbruins.com/sports/m-soccer/2014-15/releases/20141015yz08k7\n\nHis Belmont profile which confirms his birth in Argentina:\n\nhttp://belmont.prestosports.com/sports/m-soccer/2012-13/bios/olsak_nico_4prq?view=bio\n\nMaccabi Netanya 3-0 Hapoel Jerusalem\n\nFulltime\n\nOslak and Netanya are having a great season. On Thursday, they trounced Hapoel Jerusalem and erased the negative points they incurred before the season started, so they have five points from 4 wins and two draws. Olsak has played every minute of every match for them which means he is definitely respected in the Liga Leumit. The IFA website does not record assists so I have no idea how many he has but I am sure he's got a few.\n\nHapoel Beersheba 1-1 Maccabi Netanya\n\nFulltime\n\nOlsak came off the bench in the 74th minute replacing Aviv Avraham. As such, I believe this means that the US now has two Americans playing in the top division in Israel. This was the former Belmont Bruin's first game in the Israeli Premier League having spent the entirety of his time in the lower divisions.\n\nF.C. Ashdod 0-3 Maccabi Netanya\n\nFull time\n\nOlsak again goes 90 minutes. I think Netanya has surpassed people's expectations this year. Still early, but having gone down in flames to the second tier with Schoenfeld, their success this season has been a good storyline for the league.\n\nOlsak is going to be offered a 3 year contract extension by Maccabi Netanya. Article on One says that they see the Argentine American as one of their long term pieces to success.\n\nhttp://m.one.co.il/Mobile/Article/17-18/1,1,8,0/306015.html?ref=hp\n\nOlsak started Maccabi Netanya's second league cup group stage on July 31st and was subbed out during the 68th minute in a 2-1 road loss to Ironi Kiryat Shmona. He made a 66th minute substitute appearance in their first match and was not in the squad for their second match on Saturday.\n\nDuring the 2018/2019 season, Olsak played in 29 games (26 starts) in the league recording 1 goal and 3 assists. He also made 5 starts in the domestic cup picking up an assist and a red card and made 5 starts in the league cup. Maccabi Netanya lost the State Cup (domestic cup) final on penalties. Olsak converted a penalty.\n\nNico was at Maccabi Netanya this whole season, in Israeli first division. Scored on June 28. But his contract expired on June 30, so now a free agent. Israeli press says he has returned to the US.\n\nhttps://www.one.co.il/Article/19-20/1,1,8,56246/361958.html?ref=hp\n\nhttps://www.transfermarkt.us/nicolas-olsak/profil/spieler/422158\n\nHapoel Tel Aviv is very interested in Olsak for next season. Discussions with his agent should start soon. Additionally, there is interest in Poland and Cyprus thanks to his Polish passport.\n\nAccording to One.co.il, Olsak has interest from a club in a bigger league and is reported to now not be so close to finalizing a deal with Hapoel Tel Aviv.\n\nHe's not a U.S. citizen yet. He's a green card holder. He is taking steps to become a U.S. citizen and getting married soon to an American will help.\n\nPlayed 35 minutes in season opener for Waalwijk. Played at right-wing. Surprisingly has never been called up by Israel. According to his instagram, his wedding isn't until May 2021. So could be awhile before he's eligible for US. (Unless he gets civil marriage certificate at some point before ceremony.)\n\nhttps://us.soccerway.com/matches/2020/09/13/netherlands/eredivisie/rkc-waalwijk/sbv-vitesse/3304501/"
