        "text": "Netherlands - List of Second and Third Division Champions\n\nA nationwide second class was introduced in the 1890/91 season (also the first season an official first class championship was held) and existed until 1896 (from the 1896/97 season on, four regional districts were formed and the number of second class competitions rose to six; by the end of the amateur era there were twelve).\n\nOnly after sixty years, in 1956/57, a unified national league, called \"eredivisie\", was formed again, two years after professionalism had been introduced in the Netherlands. Originally two levels of professional football existed below the eredivisie, the \"eerste divisie\" (which literally translates as \"first division\") and \"tweede divisie\" (second division). Both were sometimes played in one, sometimes in two groups.\n\nAt the end of the 1970/71 season, the second division was abolished after it had been found that too many teams had been allowed to turn professional in the fifties. Over the years, several had voluntarily returned to the amateur leagues, some had been relegated, and on two occasions teams had been promoted as amateur champions to the professional section (Xerxes and Velox). In 1970/71 many of the remaining small clubs, which were deemed incapable of sustaining in professional football, were forced to return to the amateurs and only two divisions (eredivisie and eerste divisie) of professional football remained, both played in one group. Since then, the number of professional teams has varied from 34 to 41, teams occasionally going bust or (from the eighties) being admitted to professional football when meeting certain criteria (R.B.C., R.K.C., Emmen, T.O.P. and V.C. Vlissingen - the last team folding after two unsuccessful seasons).\n\nIn 1972/73 a special promotion regulation was introduced: teams that had been the best in an (usually) eight game \"period\" were allowed to fight for (usually) one promotion place in an end-of-the-season playoff called \"nacompetitie\".\n\nBelow all the group winners of the Eerste and Tweede Divisie since 1956/57 are listed. From 1972/73 onwards, winners of the nacompetitie (obtaining promotion) are listed as well.\n\nTweede Klasse Champions 1890-1896\n\n1890/91 Victoria (Rotterdam) 1891/92 Go Ahead (Wageningen) 1892/93 Sparta (Rotterdam) 1893/94 Rapiditas (Rotterdam) 1894/95 Victoria (Rotterdam) 1895/96 H.B.S.

Breda [1] Heracles and Fortuna Vlaardingen played a decisive match for promotion, won by Heracles. Fortuna remained in the eerste divisie and are therefore not counted as \"Eerste Divisie\" Champions in the following list. In the years before, no matches between group winners were played to decide championship or promotion. [2] From 1991/92 on, and until 2005/06, the nacompetitie was played in two groups. In 1991/92, the second group was won by Go Ahead Eagles who lost the promotion playoff against B.V.V. Den Bosch. (They later obtained promotion by beating eredivisie side F.C. Den Haag.) [3] From 1992/93 on, eredivisie sides finishing just above the automatic relegation spot(s) had to fight for their survival in a nacompetitie group. Since 2006/07, the group system was replaced by a knock-out format. Teams given in italics were eredivisie sides who managed to retain their place in the nacompetitie. [!] Jong Ajax won the league but were ineligible for promotion, so Fortuna Sittard were promoted automatically as runners-up.\n\nList of Eerste Divisie Champions (since 1956) (72)\n\n6 F.C.

However, they play at the former D.S. '79 ground.
