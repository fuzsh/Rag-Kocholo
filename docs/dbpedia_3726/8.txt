Emmen 1-4 Almere City (2-8 on aggregate)

Behind 4-1 from the first leg, FC Emmen had it all to do in the second leg, but they gave themselves a chance when Erixon Danso netted early on.

However, any chance of the hosts progressing was ruined on 54 minutes when Tom Siekman was shown his second yellow card. From that point, Almere City took full control and Jason Oost’s hat-trick put them well in front before Soufyan Ahannach sealed victory late on.

In the second round, Almere City will meet the side that finishes 16th in the Eredivisie. That is currently Willem II, but Excelsior could also fall into that position on Sunday.

Volendam 1-2 MVV Maastricht (2-4 on aggregate)

Volendam went into the game in a good position having netted an away goal on Monday, but they were stunned by MVV forward Jordy Croux.

The attacker opened the scoring in the first half before sealing his side’s progress on 73 minutes. Kevin Kippersluis pulled one back for Volendam late on but it proved to be nothing but a consolation.

MVV move onto the next round where they will face De Graafschap.
