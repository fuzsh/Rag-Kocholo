        "text": "La Robla Green is the most innovative integrated green energy generation project in Europe and will have two large cutting-edge facilities working in synergy.\n\nRoblum is the first green biomass power plant with a negative carbon footprint, capable of generating energy for the consumption of around 50,000 households.\n\nBiomass is a renewable energy source from the controlled combustion of organic waste from agriculture. This waste represents millions of tonnes, part of which is not used nowadays.\n\nLa Robla Nueva Energía is the largest green e-methanol plant in Europe. At its facilities, the CO₂ extracted from the Roblum biomass energy generation plant is mixed with green hydrogen to produce a new generation product. It is an essential product for decarbonising two sectors that are facing problems in reducing emissions from their activities: the chemical industry and the transport."
