        "text": "Three photovoltaic power generation projects, totalling 470 MW, which are expected to generate 622 direct jobs and 495 indirect jobs and 25 direct jobs and 20 indirect jobs in the operation phase.:\n\nLos Corrales (250 MW)\n\nLa Serna (50 MW)\n\nLa Pradera (300 MW)\n\nA renewable hydrogen production plant, together with Enagás Renovable, where the production capacity will reach up to 280 MW. With an estimated investment of 485 million euros, this new plant is scheduled to come into operation in 2026. This plant will prevent more than 430,000 tons of CO2 from being emitted into the atmosphere per year, contributing to the decarbonisation of industrial processes and the development of sustainable mobility. Approximately 2,000 direct, indirect and induced jobs are estimated to be created during the construction phase, and 275 in the operating phase, also including direct, indirect and induced jobs."
