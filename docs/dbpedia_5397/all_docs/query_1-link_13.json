        "text": "Hi all, as you probably know Spain is a mecca for train travel in Europe, and while our high speed trains get all the press, perhaps what is lesser well known is our slower more scenic regional tourist trains. I came across an interesting article detailing the many tourist trains of Spain:\n\nThe Transcantabrico Train\n\nGet to know the oldest and most important train for luxury tourism in Spain; the Transcantabrico train, which travels around northern Spain and features many landscapes that will transmit a peaceful view with golden sunsets. The train has preserved its romanticism of the beginning of the 20th century, and you will be able to enjoy an eight-day trip from San Sebastian to Santiago de Compostela.\n\nLa Robla Express\n\nLet’s stick to the north of Spain, with trains offering journeys through beautiful passages following the Camino de Santiago, which is offered in July, September, and October. While the classic decoration makes the train so special, the outside has the most romantic views.\n\nGalicia’s tourist trains\n\nEvery year there are many themed tourist trains that usually run between May and October and pass through some of the most beautiful spots in Spain. Some of the best routes include the Mansions and Historic Gardens Route, as well as the Roman Lugo Route. During trips with this train, you might as well taste Galician wine, which has become very famous among travellers.\n\nTren dels Llacs\n\nYou can either take a journey in vintage carriages or explore the modern and panoramic trains, but either way, the experience is incredible. There are many stops at Calatonia, Castell de Mur, and other National Parks. Most of these historic trains can offer rides most Saturdays from April to October, as well as some Saturdays in July and August.\n\nThe Al Andalus\n\nThis train is one very luxurious train that was designated to transport the British Royal Family between France and Spain. Travel through different cities like Ronda, Cadiz, Cordoba, Baeza, and Ubeda while also having the chance to try delicious delicacies from train chefs.\n\nCampos de Castilla Train\n\nHere we recommend travelling to Soria from the Capital in order to spend the weekend surrounded by poetry and local food. Before the train arrives here, some special passengers will entertain the whole cabin, actors that live up to the journey with jokes about Machado. This trip can usually be taken during weekends in May and November.\n\nThe Cervantes Train\n\nIt is called so due to its destination, the historic city of Alcala de Henares, where Miguel Cervantes, the Spanish writer, was born. The train offers trips over several days as well as day trips, during which various actors in costumes entertain the travellers.\n\nPhilip II Train\n\nThe train ride starts from San Lorenzo de El Escorial and ends near Madrid, with this train being a 20th-century locomotive that was built by Philip II in the 16th century. Here you can see the Royal Pantheon, the Library, the Basilica, and the Hapsburg Palace.\n\nSiguenza Medieval Train\n\n“The City of the Young Knight” is just 130 kilometres from Madrid, and it has a very medieval feel. There are many folk singers and actors that entertain travellers throughout their journey. After reaching Siguenza, a tour guide takes visitors to the Castle, the Plaza Mayor Square as well as the Cathedral. The train offers trips usually between April and November.\n\nThe Strawberry Train\n\nTrips are ideal for the weekends in Spring and Autumn, starting from the capital city of Madrid to Aranjuez, which is famous for strawberries, and also protected by World Heritage. Once reaching Aranjuez, you can visit the gardens or the Palace or sightsee bus-train."
