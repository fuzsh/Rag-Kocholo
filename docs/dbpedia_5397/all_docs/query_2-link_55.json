Hope to do it in 5 days which seems doable. But we'll have traveled the two days prior so i hope we'll be rested enough to walk the first day. Hence my idea was to take it slow the first day and stop in Cabanillas but it seems like that will really slow everything else down a lot, unless you want to do it over 7 or 8 days, with having to stay in La Robla the next day. We continue on to the Primitivo after and we won't have unlimited time. We are pretty strong walkers at home but of course the unknown environment etc will affect how fast we can walk. We walked part of the Frances last year and have to admit i haven't practiced with my backpack since! So the weight might be a bit of a shock, but it was the same last year and i guess you just get on with it and push on. So i'm just wondering about what the general consensus is about the first day from Leon to La Robla. I'm conscious of the days getting shorter but don't want to start in the dark. How long would it take on average? Last year we walked late Sept/Oct also and would start around 7.30am and that was fine. We don't mind walking long days but still i would really appreciate your advice and thoughts on the Salvador and the first day particularly. Many thanks\n\nI walked it with kids as young as 8 but they were accustomed to walking. That was in June so long days. That said, we did not rush but dilly-dallied around. We must have arrived between 2 and 5pm because I recall needing to wait for the fiends to open so we could buy something.\n\nYou could always take the bus the first 8 or 9km our of Leon to shorten the distance.\n\nHi Rachael\n\nI walked it with kids as young as 8 but they were accustomed to walking.

You must be leaving soon too?! By sounds of it we should be fine, even if it takes a bit longer. We walk long distances very regularly at home, just not so used to our camino backpack weight until we get there but feel fit enough. We see how the journey goes but we plan to walk all the way, so taking a bus is not an option! Unless of course something happens on the way but i think my son would not be very enthused ..\n\nHi, Mgardener,\n\nI agree with those who encourage you to start out with La Robla as your goal. If you stay off the pavement and take the river trail for the first 8.5 km to Carbajal, your feet will be in much better shape. It is not marked, but it is impossible to go wrong since it goes along the river. Gronze has a schematic map: https://www.gronze.com/etapa/leon/robla\n\nThere are about 450 m of elevation gain that day, which is mainly between Carbajal and Cabanillas, so by the time you get to Cabanillas you will probably be able to gauge whether you can deal with another 9 pretty flat kms.\n\nHope the weather is glorious for you. I walked my first Salvador at the very end of September and it was great!\n\nHi everyone,\n\nMy son and I will be starting our Camino the Salvador on Saturday the 22nd of September.

We don't mind walking long days but still i would really appreciate your advice and thoughts on the Salvador and the first day particularly. Many thanks\n\nHola!\n\nIf you want to do shorter first day and wish further stages to be approximately of the same length then 6 days would be ideal:\n\n1.) Cabanillas, 18,3 (stock up in Carbajal or 2km further and over the river in Seca),\n\n2.) Buiza, 23,9 (stock up in La Pola de Gordon),\n\n3.) Pajares, 22,6,\n\n4.) Benduenos, 17, 0 (shorter but you could enjoy Sandra's albergue, one of the best on many Caminos),\n\n5.) Mieres, 24,4,\n\n6.) Oviedo, 17,9 (shorter day gives you enough time for afternoon sight seeing if you want to start the Primitivo in the morning).\n\nBuen Camino!\n\nwow great Link Lauren, this is sxactly what i was looking for.\n\n2 questions what is the difference between the atapa 3 & 3b please?\n\nalso, I want to do the 5 stages but stay at Benduenos is there any way to make day 1 & 2 longer in order to make day 3 (which is the hard one?) shorter? I really would prefer the short day on day 5 to have time in oviedo?\n\nHi, Pieces,\n\nThat's a bit tougher:\n\n1.) La Robla, 27,3\n\n2.) Poladura de la Tercia, 23,5 (call a day in advance for a supper in CR)\n\n3.) Benduenos, 30,9 (or 2 km less if you arrange that Sandra pick you up in Herias by the lavadora/fuente. But it's the toughest stage both by length and elevation!)\n\n4.) Mieres, 24,4\n\n5.) Oviedo, 17,9.\n\nVariante 3B is 2km uphil and downhill to the valley from Buiza to Villamanin (I took it in downpour) where you have many infrastructure but also heavy traffic. It's almost all road walking after Villasimpliz and especially after Villamanin. In good weather go over the mountains\n\nBuen Camino!\n\nI personally would not want to take the national highway from Buiza to Villamanin in a downpour. It is a route travelled almost exclusively by trucks, and even though it was a Sunday when I got out there on the highway (by mistake, things were then very confusing in Buiza) and it was sunny it was god awful. I can’t even imagine it in a pouring rain, surely it is extremely dangerous.\n\nKinky has given you one option. Here’s another, which is silly because of the uneven stages but would keep it to 5 days and preserve the Bendueños night.\n\nFirst day to Pola de Gordón where there is a pensión or two. That makes the first day very long, but I have found it very do-able if you start early from León and are in good form and the weather cooperates.\n\nSecond to Pajares\n\nThird to Bendueños, which would be a very short 14 km day.\n\nThen your original 4 and 5.\n\nThe one drawback with this stage other than the uneven kms is that you collapse all the mountain walking into one day. The best mountain walking is between Buiza and Pajares. So it’s nice if you go Buiza to Poladura and Poladura onward the next day. Of course you never know about the weather, but it’s good to know you can mix it up if things are either really glorious or really bad, to adjust stages in response with the weather.\n\nyes I tried to make to puzzle, but my brain will not make the pieces fit\n\nIt is hard to puzzle it because you don't know what to expect or is it because your moniker That's why Laurie emphasizes the weather also.\n\nI knew there would be a lot of traffic on the 3B variante but I was also a rock climber/mountaineer in my youth and I really don't want to get caught in the (unknown) mountain area in that kind of weather, although I have excellent sense of orientation. Once the fog sets in even I would be lost in matter of minutes. Just don't want to be up there in that kind of weather. And I had a lot of it that year\n\nThe Italian couple that went over the hill that day were washing themselves and entire gear for almost 3 hours being all muddy. I don't remember how many slips they had but there was a count number\n\nI don't like to shave off any distance on my Caminos and I also don't like to encourage people to do so but IF you decide that could help you with shortening the stages that would be on only two stages in my eyes:\n\n1.) Pola de Lena - Mieres del Camino (13,5km)\n\nor\n\n2.) Leon - Carbajal del Camino (8,5km)\n\nHi, Mgardener,\n\nI agree with those who encourage you to start out with La Robla as your goal. If you stay off the pavement and take the river trail for the first 8.5 km to Carbajal, your feet will be in much better shape. It is not marked, but it is impossible to go wrong since it goes along the river.

I walked my first Salvador at the very end of September and it was great!\n\nThanks so much for your advice and positive response. It seems to make a lot of sense to go to La Robla and i think we be fine on the first day, even if tired!"
