        "text": "Bathed by the Cantabrian Sea and with long fishing tradition, Llanes has lots things to offer to the visitor, such as its picturesque old town; its port, where the emblematic monument “Los Cubos de la Memoria” and its beaches, such as Toro and Sablón and its majestic cliffs. Llanes also has many parties, pilgrimages and varied cuisine, based on meats and seafood as well as its llambionadas and sweets such as Asturian beans.\n\nLlanes is situated at the most eastern part of Asturias and its coast is bathed by the Cantabrian Sea. It has 13.759 inhabitants and a climate which is warm and temperate with an annual average temperature of 14,3ºC.\n\nIt is a city with a history which starts in the Paleolithic era. In the twelfth century it belonged to the Aguilar Administration Center, which was organized around the Castle of Pico Soberron, located at 374 meters above the sea. Even nowadays one can see some archeological ruins of this edifice.\n\nIn the thirteenth century the King Alfonso IX offered its protection to it. After a series of laws established by the King, the building of the city´s wall and tower started. The objective was to defend the city from those families who wanted to take control over it. In the same century, the inhabitants of Llanes built the Basilica of Santa Maria.\n\nWhile visiting Llanes, we can walk along various places such as the old part of the city, its harbor and beaches and its “Indian” (“Indiano”) part, of course. We can realize the long-standing fishing tradition of Llanes while strolling along its walkway, where we can enjoy seeing its cliffs, beaches as well as the entire village.\n\nClose to the city´s port, there is a modern piece of art called “The Cubes of Memory” (“Los Cubos de la Memoria”), made of big pieces of cement. This artistic creation of Agustin Ibarrola, a distinguished Asturian sculptor and painter, is considered to be the emblem of the city.\n\nOut of the most important beaches of Llanes there are two which stand out: the Beach of Toro and Sablon, from where we can see the walls of the city at a distance. The beach of Gulpiyuri is particularly special because of the sensation it gives to be swimming in a lake, because the cliff right beside this beach makes the sea invisible.\n\nThere are many feasts and religious festivities (“romerías”) which can be enjoyed in Llanes. They are divided in groups, such as the one of Santa Maria Magdalena in July, the one of San Roque in August and Ntra. Sra. Virgen de Guía in September.\n\nThe cuisine of Llanes is very varied and is based on meat and seafood. Some of the best dishes are the broad beans (“verdinas”), which are used to cook a dish like the “fabada” of Asturias (a traditional stew of Asturias made with a local variety of beans), or to make a stew with venison and seafood. There is a great variety of fish to taste in the city. Among its famous “llambionadas” (sweets) there are the “frixuelos” of Asturias, rice with milk and “milhoja” cake with walnuts and hazelnuts."
