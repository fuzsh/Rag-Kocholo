        "text": "2019-07-11\n\nSince November 23 we post every week on our Facebook page a 'did you know' about Spain and Northern Spain. A colorful collection of facts about this beautiful country. We are curious: how many did you know?\n\nDid you know that?\n\n1. The first known stapler was made in the 18th century in the Basque country for the French King Louis XV? Every single staple was engraved with the royal emblem.\n\n2. The oldest cave drawing in Europe and even in the world can be found in Cantabria, Spain? In the region you can find Cueva de Altamira, discovered in 1868 and with cave drawings that are more than 22,000 years old and have been exceptionally well preserved.\n\n3. Woody Allen has a statue in Oviedo? He loves this northern Spanish city, choosing to film portions of his 2008 hit Vicky Cristina Barcelona.\n\n4. Cider is a famous drink in Asturias? Pouring cider is not that simple: you swing the bottle above your head, lower the glass and then the cider must reach the edge of the glass in a long radius. Read here more about Asturias.\n\n5. The bagpipes are played in Galicia? This region is originally Celtic, therefore it has similarities in culture, music and traditions with other European Celtic areas, such as Scotland and Ireland.\n\n6. The camino along the Portuguese coast, after being partially forgotten and perhaps overshadowed by the Camino Frances, has received an almost explosive interest in recent years? Want to know more about this camino? Click here.\n\n7. La Rioja is Spain's very own Jurassic Parc? Rioja is an area that is best known for its wines, but has so much more to offer. You can read it here.\n\n8. The famous Game of Thrones has made several recordings in the north of Spain? Including San Juan de Gaztelugatxe in the Basque Country\n\n9. Spain is the only country in Europe, apart from a few Portuguese islands, where bananas grow?\n\n10. The word ´electroencefalografista´ is the longest word in the Spanish language? This word has a total of 10 syllables! It means: the person who detects the electrical activity of the brain through an investigation.\n\n11. Life in a Spanish city revolves around the plaza mayor (a square in the middle of the city)? In the past bullfights and executions took place, now markets and events.\n\n12. The Holy Week, the week before Easter, is celebrated grandly in Spain? During Semana Santa daily processions take place that show the suffering of Christ and Mary\n\n13. Spanish is the second world language? More than 500 million people all over the world speak Spanish.\n\n14. Rioja wine is not only available in red, but also as white wine? Riojas are old-fashioned blends, for which traditional Tempranillo, Mazuelo, Graciano and Garnacha are used. Rioja is a very famous wine region in northern Spain\n\n15. Spain has four official languages? Castilian (Spanish), Catalan, Basque and Galician. But there are also many variants like the Balearic or Valencian\n\n16. Cantabria is a paradise for surfers? Many beaches of Cantabria are hidden between a large number of different coves along the Cantabrian coast. And these bays makes Cantabria one of the best surfspots in Europe! Read more about it.\n\n17. The Basque language is also spoken in part of France? Basque is not just a language spoken in Spain, but also in the Basque region of Southern France, which is across the French border in the Pyrenees. Some of the famous French cities where Basque is spoken include Bayonne and Biarritz.\n\n18. There are more than 200 different types of paella in all kinds of combinations. Among other things, with chicken, fish, shellfish, game, vegetables and more...\n\n19. The Galician coastline consists of more than 700 beaches? We can guide you to some of the best ones.\n\n20. Rioja is on the south side of the Cantabrian mountain rug? The vineyards are located in a valley of the Ebro and its tributaries. One of the rivers is the Oja. But whether the Rio Oja is now the name of the area, the views differ.\n\n21. In Spain Friday the 13th is not an accident day but Tuesday the 13th? This has never been scientifically proven, so it's a myth. Yet there are still many Spaniards who do not get out of the home on Tuesday the 13th.\n\n22. One of the oldest cave of Europe and even the world is found in the El Castillo cave in Cantabria, in the north of Spain? This UNESCO-protected cave was discovered in 1903 and houses caves of 40,000 years old.\n\n23. The name of Spain is thanks to the Phoenicians calling the Iberian Peninsula Hispania, a name that probably means \"Land of the Rabbits\"?\n\n24. During the ice age, Spain remained free of ice, while all Europe was covered in a thick layer and had many glaciers? Thanks to that, 2000 out of the 8000 plants, trees and other species that survived, can be found in Spain.\n\n25. Eating 12 grapes at midnight (one for each stroke) on New Year's Eve is a tradition in Spain? This tradition was introduced by wine-growers who were looking for a way to get rid of leftover grapes. Strange is the Spaniard who will risk their fate for the coming year by skipping the grapes.\n\n26. Spain is one of the few countries whose national anthem has no text?
