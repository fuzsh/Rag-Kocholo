Members of Reclaim Our Schools LA (ROS-LA), a\n\ncoalition of educators, labor unions and social justice organizations,\n\ntold a December media event attended by about one hundred parents,\n\nstudents and supporters in the library of South L.A.’s Dorsey High\n\nSchool, that the key to substantive school reform is to transform LAUSD\n\ninto a “community school district.” Community schools, which have roots\n\nin the progressive movement of the early 20th century but have been\n\nundergoing a recent revival, look beyond academics to the entrenched,\n\npoverty-related social, emotional and health barriers that keep kids in\n\nhigh-needs districts from succeeding in school. The approach redresses\n\nthose needs by partnering with families, local government and\n\ncommunity-based organizations to provide “wraparound services” — health\n\nclinics, mental health counselors, after-school programs or parent\n\nsupport services — on school grounds.\n\nSchools must have a role in ending dating abuse\n\nKathy Moore and Patty Giggans, EdSource\n\nYoung people experiencing dating abuse often live in a world of\n\nisolation, self-doubt and fear that affects every aspect of their lives,\n\nincluding school. Jessica, a survivor of teen dating abuse, has a story\n\nthat is all too common. When Jessica was a sophomore at Fairfield High\n\nSchool, she began dating a fellow student. She believed that the\n\nintensity of his feelings for her caused his initial jealousy. But that\n\nsoon transformed into a pattern of overbearing control. He declared that\n\nno one else existed besides the two of them. He forbade her from\n\ntalking to girlfriends and young men. He dictated that she not wear\n\nmakeup or skirts. Beginning to feel her independence diminishing,\n\nJessica became depressed and agonized over how to end a relationship\n\nwith someone who said he would commit suicide if she broke up with him.\n\nNot surprisingly, her classroom participation declined. In a class she\n\nand her boyfriend shared, she fell silent and stopped participating in a\n\ngroup project when he stared at her with threatening disapproval at the\n\nprospect of her interacting with other boys in the group. She felt\n\nhumiliated and defeated. One in four youth in the United States\n\nstruggles through some form of dating abuse. Nearly half of students who\n\nhave experienced dating abuse report that at least part of the abuse\n\noccurred at school. It’s not unusual for a student’s academic\n\nperformance to suffer as a result, as it did in Jessica’s case.\n\nIn a paved, urban world, nature makes a rare appearance — delighting kids near MacArthur Park\n\nEsmeralda Bermudez, Los Angeles Times\n\nNathan Hobbs couldn’t believe his eyes. He rubbed them with his fists,\n\nhe blinked, then he looked once more. There it was, just a few days\n\nafter Thanksgiving, perched on the branch of a coral tree outside Ms.\n\nGil’s classroom. Some sort of owl with long legs, white brows and\n\nbright, yellow eyes. Nathan, 9, had no idea how the bird found its way\n\nto the courtyard of his school, Esperanza Elementary, near MacArthur\n\nPark in the middle of the city. “This is a big deal,” he thought. Nathan\n\ntold a teacher, who then told Brad Rumble, the school’s principal and a\n\nman who takes bird matters very seriously. Rumble pulled a few students\n\nout of class to observe the visitor, identified as a burrowing\n\nowl. In a neighborhood of asphalt, street vendors and crowded apartment\n\nbuildings, this was their closest encounter yet with nature.\n\nDoes handing out sanitary pads really get girls to stay in school?\n\nNurith Aizenman, NPR\n\nTalking publicly about women’s menstruation has long been a taboo. But\n\nin 2016 the world made big strides getting over the squeamishness. There\n\nwas the Chinese swimmer at the Rio Olympics who had no qualms\n\nexplaining that she was on her period after she finished a race\n\ngrimacing in pain. Some medical students in India launched a “haiku”\n\ncontest on menstruation. New York joined the growing number of states\n\nthat have ended taxation of tampons and sanitary pads. The new openness\n\nhas also sparked a widening conversation about how menstruation might\n\naffect girls in poor countries — their health, their confidence, even\n\ntheir education. Marni Sommer, a professor at Columbia University, was\n\namong the first social science researchers to look into this topic —\n\nand, for a while, one of the only ones. “When I started doing this in\n\n2004 it was a pretty lonely world,” she says. But not anymore. The work\n\nthat she and other pioneers have done suggested that girls are having\n\ndifficulty managing their periods — and it could be harming their\n\neducation. And that has helped spur a groundswell of interest from\n\ngirls’ advocates, policymakers and researchers.\n\nDecember 16, 2016\n\nThe playground where babies learn to talk\n\nEmily Deruy, The Atlantic\n\nAt first, the playground at Officer Willie Wilkins Park looks pretty\n\nstandard. There’s a slide to skid down, ramps to climb up, bridges to\n\ncross, and nooks to investigate. But there’s also something relatively\n\nunusual: words, and lots of them. Mixed in among the bright primary\n\ncolors of the structure are white panels plastered with whimsical\n\nillustrations and phrases like “let’s talk about the sunshine” and\n\n“let’s talk about food.” They’re not a random addition; the panels are a\n\ndeliberate attempt to foster early language and brain development in\n\nbabies and toddlers. The park sits in the eastern part of the city, in a\n\nneighborhood with high poverty rates and low educational attainment.\n\nStudies suggest that a 30-million “word gap” exists between low- and\n\nupper-income children: Poor children hear, understand, and use fewer\n\nwords, which can have long-term negative consequences. Babies who hear\n\nfewer words are less likely to do well in school and kids who drop out\n\nof school are less likely to be healthy adults.\n\nThe brain science behind student trauma\n\nBruce D. Perry, Education Week\n\nThe most remarkable feature of humankind is the flexibility of our\n\nbrains. This neuroplasticity—or the brain’s ability to adjust its\n\nactivities in response to new situations—is what has allowed our species\n\nto make dramatic changes from generation to generation. Humans have\n\nevolved from small hunter-gatherer clans to urban, digitally connected,\n\ninternational communities. The most malleable part of our brain is the\n\nneocortex, which can absorb and store more bits of information than the\n\nbrains of any other species. This capacity for cognitive thinking\n\nallowed us to create language, democracy, and thousands of other\n\ninventions. In fact, our most remarkable invention is public education: a\n\nstructured system to provide the social and cognitive stimulation\n\nchildren need to take advantage of their brain’s malleability and\n\ndevelop knowledge and skills in mathematics, science, and history. By\n\nproviding structured cognitive and social experiences, the U.S. public\n\neducation system has expressed the potential of millions of children,\n\nwhich has, in turn, led to invention, creativity, and productivity that\n\nhas transformed the world.The key to the success of any educational\n\nexperience is the capacity to “get to the cortex.” Yet, each year,\n\nnearly one-third of all children attending U.S. public schools will have\n\nsignificantly impaired cortical functioning due to abuse, neglect,\n\ndomestic violence, poverty, and other adversities. Understanding the\n\neffects of trauma on a child’s brain and how these effects alter the\n\nability to learn is essential to improving our public education system.\n\nThe case for abolishing class rank\n\nValerie Strauss, The Washington Post; Alfie Kohn, author of Schooling Beyond Measure\n\nWhen students are rated with letter or number grades, research shows\n\nthey’re apt to think in a shallower fashion — and to lose interest in\n\nwhat they’re learning — as compared with students who aren’t graded at\n\nall. Alternative methods for reporting student progress are not only\n\nless destructive but also potentially more informative. Given the\n\nabsence of pros to balance the cons, then, you have to wonder why grades\n\npersist. The only explanation that seems even halfway persuasive is the\n\nfear that kids won’t get into college if they aren’t tagged with a GPA.\n\nBut of course that doesn’t explain why grades would be used in middle\n\nschool (or, heaven help us, elementary school), where students’\n\nperformance is of no interest to colleges.[1] Moreover, some (public and\n\nprivate) high schools do not give any grades at all, and their\n\ngraduates are regularly accepted by both large state universities and\n\nsmall, selective colleges.\n\nDecember 9, 2016\n\nArt that transformed a Miami neighborhood now making its schools cool\n\nGreg Allen, NPR\n\nEvery December, Miami’s annual Art Basel fair draws artists, dealers and\n\nbuyers from around the world. This year, dozens of artists could be\n\nfound not in galleries or at cocktail parties, but painting at an\n\nelementary school. Spanish painter Marina Capdevila was one of more than\n\n30 artists working at Eneida Hartner Elementary School in Miami’s\n\nWynwood neighborhood. Her cartoon-style painting of elderly women doing\n\nwater aerobics is intended, she says, to get the kids to smile. “Always\n\nI’m trying to, when I do murals, to bring a little of my sense of humor\n\nto make people laugh,” she says. Over the last decade, Miami’s Wynwood\n\nneighborhood has been revitalized by art. Galleries, restaurants and\n\nartists’ studios have moved in. Walls throughout the area are now\n\ncovered in murals and Wynwood has become a tourist destination. Now,\n\nEneida Hartner Elementary is getting in on the action.\n\nWhy this high school works: ‘We are in a perpetual state of improvement.’\n\nValerie Strauss, The Washington Post\n\nIf you have paid attention to the school reform debate in recent years,\n\nyou would be forgiven for thinking that public schools across the board\n\nare failing students and that schools that are struggling can only\n\nimprove if they fire all of their staff, become a charter school or let\n\nthe state take them over. It’s just not so. This is clear in a project\n\ncalled the Schools of Opportunity, launched a few years ago by educators\n\nwho sought to highlight public high schools that actively seek to close\n\nopportunity gaps through 11 research-proven practices and not\n\nstandardized test scores (which are more a measure of socioeconomic\n\nstatus than anything else). The project assesses how well schools\n\nprovide health and psychological support for students, judicious and\n\nfair discipline policies, high-quality teacher mentoring programs,\n\noutreach to the community, effective student and faculty support\n\nsystems, and broad and enriched curriculum. Schools submit applications\n\nexplaining why they believe their school should be recognized.\n\nA research synthesis of the associations between socioeconomic background, inequality, school climate, and academic achievement\n\nRuth Berkowitz, Hadass Moore, Ron Avi Astor, and Rami Benbenishty, Review of Educational Research\n\nEducational researchers and practitioners assert that supportive school\n\nand classroom climates can positively influence the academic outcomes of\n\nstudents, thus potentially reducing academic achievement gaps between\n\nstudents and schools of different socioeconomic status (SES)\n\nbackgrounds. Nonetheless, scientific evidence establishing directional\n\nlinks and mechanisms between SES, school climate, and academic\n\nperformance is inconclusive. This comprehensive review of studies dating\n\nback to the year 2000 examined whether a positive climate can\n\nsuccessfully disrupt the associations between low SES and poor academic\n\nachievement. Positive climate was found to mitigate the negative\n\ncontribution of weak SES background on academic achievement; however,\n\nmost studies do not provide a basis for deducing a directional influence\n\nand causal relations. Additional research is encouraged to establish\n\nthe nature of impact positive climate has on academic achievement and a\n\nmultifaceted body of knowledge regarding the multilevel climate\n\ndimensions related to academic achievement.\n\nDecember 2, 2016\n\nThe push for positive school climate bumps up against Trump rhetoric\n\nJane Meredith Adams, EdSource\n\nIf President-elect Donald Trump were a high school student in\n\nCalifornia, he might find himself in a restorative justice circle making\n\namends for his hurtful words and behavior.\n\n“He would be in a lot of trouble,” said Jaana Juvonen, a UCLA researcher\n\nwho studies student bullying. Supported by civil rights laws, brain\n\nscience and research on learning, schools in California and across the\n\nnation have increasingly made it a priority to try to create classrooms\n\nthat are welcoming to all. The goal is civil discourse, improved\n\nacademic performance and fewer discipline incidents. Positive school\n\nclimate is part of the idea behind elementary school students shaking\n\nhands with their teachers in the morning, middle school students\n\ncreating “No Bullying!” posters and high school students talking it out\n\nin stress management support groups. In California, improving “school\n\nclimate” is part of the new education accountability system, although no\n\none is quite sure what to measure.\n\nThere are 63,000 homeless youths in L.A. County. These are the children of skid row\n\nJoy Resmovits, Los Angeles Times\n\nTheir eyes shift from joy to fatigue as they walk hand in hand and take\n\nin the tents, the smells, the people. The smaller ones tune it out,\n\nfaces blank. The eldest openly stare. These are the children of skid\n\nrow — black, white, Latino. They have pink and red Adidas sneakers or\n\nthumbs in their mouths or studs that glint like diamonds in their ears\n\nor the first hint of hair above their lips. They’re sisters and friends\n\nwho profess their love for each other, who like listening to music when\n\nthey study, who talk in class without raising their hands. They could be\n\nany kids.\n\nWhen the students on campus have kids of their own\n\nNoah Adams, NPR\n\nThe young women in this story have labels. Three labels: Single, mother,\n\ncollege student. They’re raising a child and getting an education —\n\nthree of the 2.6 million unmarried parents attending U.S. colleges and\n\nuniversities. Getting a degree is hard enough for anyone, but these\n\nstudents face extra challenges. And when it comes to helping out with\n\ntheir needs, Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pa., is considered one of\n\nthe best in the country. It’s a liberal arts school with 1,100 students.\n\nThere’s a large farm, an equestrian program, and 15 students in the\n\nSingle Parent Scholars program. This year all are moms, though men are\n\nwelcome too.\n\nNovember 18, 2016\n\nWhy kids need recess\n\nAlia Wong, The Atlantic\n\nIn Florida, a coalition of parents known as “the recess moms” has been\n\nfighting to pass legislation guaranteeing the state’s elementary-school\n\nstudents at least 20 minutes of daily free play. Similar legislation\n\nrecently passed in New Jersey, only to be vetoed by the governor, who\n\ndeemed it “stupid.” When, you might ask, did recess become such a\n\nradical proposal? In a survey of school-district administrators, roughly\n\na third said their districts had reduced outdoor play in the early\n\n2000s. Likely culprits include concerns about bullying\n\nand the No Child Left Behind Act, whose time-consuming requirements\n\nresulted in cuts to play. Disadvantaged kids have been\n\nthe most likely to be shortchanged: According to a 2003 study, just 56\n\npercent of children living at or below the poverty line had recess,\n\ncompared with 83 percent of those above the poverty line; a similar\n\ndisparity was noted between black children and their white peers.\n\nFirefighting program at high school gives students hands-on training\n\nFermin Leal, EdSource\n\nDaniel Chambers’ classes at Banning High School in Los Angeles include\n\nhoisting a heavy water hose around his shoulders and running around the\n\ntrack, lifting a 20-foot ladder to climb up the sides of buildings, and\n\ndressing in heavy fire coats and other gear within one minute. Chambers,\n\na sophomore, is one of 70 students from Banning High enrolled in the\n\ncampus’ first-ever Fire Academy, a four-year career pathway that will\n\nprepare them for jobs as firefighters, paramedics and emergency medical\n\ntechnicians. “I’m receiving training I wouldn’t be able to get almost\n\nanywhere else,” Chambers said. The Fire Academy is also part of a new\n\nwave of career training pathways that school districts are creating\n\nto prepare students for very specific jobs. For example, Los Angeles\n\nUnified students can now enroll in pathways such as coding, which was\n\npreviously under the computer sciences umbrella; radiology,\n\nformerly part of the healthcare program; or filmmaking, which was part\n\nof the broad multimedia pathway.\n\nCSUSM launches art programs to improve childhood learning\n\nGary Warth, The San Diego Union-Tribune\n\nCal State San Marcos will launch a series of summits, special events and\n\ntraining sessions aimed at improving literacy through the arts in a new\n\ncountywide campaign. The program, called ART=OPPORTUNITY, will be\n\nfunded with a $200,000 grant from the Student Foundation and is focused\n\non providing access to better education for all children and will\n\ninclude technical assistance to implement arts plans, professional\n\ndevelopment, and mentoring. ART=OPPORTUNITY will be implemented by\n\nMerryl Goldberg, executive director of Center ARTES, a university center\n\ndedicated to restoring arts to education. Goldberg, a CSUSM professor\n\nof music, will be joined by a leadership team of arts educators,\n\nprofessionals and area nonprofits in leading the program.\n\nNovember 11, 2016\n\nNew campaign promotes power of teachers to reduce stress of traumatized students\n\nJane Meredith Adams, EdSource\n\nMost of the 3rd-graders in Anita Parameswaran’s class at Daniel Webster\n\nElementary in San Francisco have had experiences so awful that their\n\nbrains won’t let them easily forget. “Whether it be that they’ve been\n\nsexually molested, or they’ve seen domestic violence, or shootings, or\n\nthey know somebody who’s passed away,” Parameswaran said, “I would say\n\nevery single year about 75 percent, give or take, come in with a lot of\n\ntrauma.” Now a national campaign is recognizing, backed by research on\n\nbrain development, the power of teachers like Parameswaran to lower the\n\nlevels of stress hormones in a child’s body and strengthen the neural\n\nconnections needed for learning and self-control. The campaign,\n\ncalled Changing Minds and launched last month, is a partnership of the\n\nU.S. Department of Justice, the nonprofit group Futures Without\n\nViolence and the Ad Council, a nonprofit agency that creates public\n\nservice advertisements.\n\nBlack frames rule at annual eye clinic for kids\n\nChristine Huard, The San Diego Union-Tribune\n\nMore than 1,500 students from every school district in South County\n\nreceived comprehensive eye exams and picked out a new pair of glasses\n\nlast week. Whether because of a lack of access or the cost, some of the\n\nchildren had never had their vision tested. And for others, it had been\n\nyears since they last had their eyes looked at by an optometrist. As\n\nthey excitedly waited in line, many had only one thing on their minds.\n\n“Do they have black frames?” 10-year-old Nicolas Mendez asked. “I want\n\nblack frames that say ‘Raiders’ on the side.” Two of his classmates from\n\nIra Harbison Elementary School in National City wanted the same. And\n\nfrom the look of the dwindling number of color choices available last\n\nThursday morning at the annual OneSight San Diego clinic, so did a lot\n\nof other kids. “They all want black,” volunteer Brigette Messbarger\n\nsaid. “And all the kids want big glasses this year.” OneSight is a\n\nnonprofit organization with a mission that reaches around the world.\n\nIt’s aim is to unlock each person’s full potential through clear sight.\n\nThe National City Host Lions Club has partnered with the organization\n\nfor 11 years now to provide eye clinics each November at Camacho Gym in\n\nLas Palmas Park.\n\nOut of options, this school got UBER to pick up its students\n\nLydia Emmanouilidou, NPR\n\nWhen Patricia Gentile was settling in as the new president of North\n\nShore Community College in Massachusetts — about twenty miles north of\n\nBoston — she remembers looking out her window and seeing something\n\nstrange. “All of these cars rolling up, and tons of folks getting in and\n\nout,” Gentile says, thinking about that January day a couple years ago.\n\n“So I asked my assistant, ‘What’s going on down there?’” Turns out\n\nthat’s where students were picked up and dropped off, but Gentile\n\nwondered why there were just so many cars. “And that’s how I found out\n\nthat this campus was not accommodated by public transportation.” The\n\nclosest option? A bus stop at a mall about four miles away. Once you\n\narrive there, though, getting the rest of the way is up to you.\n\nNovember 4, 2016\n\nHow a happy school can help students succeed\n\nKat Lonsdorf, NPR\n\nEvery day at Weiner Elementary School starts with a dance party, usually to Best Day of My Life by\n\nAmerican Authors — and that’s before the 7:50 a.m. bell even rings.\n\nThen comes the morning assembly, where all 121 students and the staff\n\ngather for 20 minutes in the cafeteria of the school in Weiner, Ark.\n\nThey sing songs and learn about an artist, a musician and an\n\ninternational city of the week. They celebrate birthdays. A lucky\n\nstudent is crowned Student of the Day. And Pam Hogue makes it her goal\n\nto be an educator instead of a principal. That assembly — and the many\n\nother things this school does to create a sense of community and\n\nhappiness — is part of what experts call school climate.\n\nDon’t bribe kids with sugar to persuade them to drink more milk\n\nEditorial Board, Los Angeles Times\n\nIf students in local public schools refused to quench their thirst with\n\nwater, would the schools offer them soda instead? Of course not. And if\n\nthey won’t drink milk, the answer shouldn’t be to add sugar, chocolate\n\nor artificial strawberry flavoring and coloring to it. L.A. Unified\n\nschools are in a tough position. The only drink they are allowed to\n\noffer students that meets federal school-lunch rules for high-nutrition\n\nfoods is milk. Under federal rules, that milk can be sweetened\n\nand flavored. But under a separate L.A. Unified rule, sugar-sweetened\n\ndrinks are banned — including flavored milk. So in effect, the only\n\ndrink schools can provide to students in their school lunches is plain\n\nmilk.\n\nNumber of home-schooled students has doubled since 1999, new data shows\n\nEmma Brown, The Washington Post\n\nApproximately 1.8 million U.S. children were home-schooled in 2012, more\n\nthan double the number that were home-schooled in 1999, when the\n\nfederal government began gathering data on national home-schooling\n\ntrends, according to estimates released Tuesday. The estimated number of\n\nhome-schooled children represents 3.4 percent of the U.S. student\n\npopulation between the ages of 5 and 17. The increase was fastest\n\nbetween 1999 and 2007, then slowed between 2007 and 2012, according to\n\nthe estimates from the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nThe figures show that most home-schoolers were white and living above\n\nthe poverty line in 2012. An estimated 4 in 10 home-schoolers\n\nhad parents who graduated from college, while about 1 in 10 had parents\n\nwhose formal education ended before they graduated from high school.\n\nOctober 28, 2016\n\nFeds release guidance for block grants to support a ‘well-rounded’ education\n\nJane Meredith Adams, EdSource\n\nMoving away from the no-frills, test-driven approach to education of the\n\nNo Child Left Behind era, U.S. Secretary of Education John B. King Jr.\n\non Friday released guidance about new federal block grants designed to\n\nfund a more varied curriculum, a more positive school environment and a\n\nmore integrated use of technology. The newly authorized Student Support\n\nand Academic Enrichment Grants are intended to provide schools the\n\nflexibility to fund programs they feel are most crucial to well-being\n\nand intellectual curiosity of their students. Created under the federal\n\neducation law known as the Every Student Succeeds Act, the grant program\n\nconsolidates targeted grants that were used under the previous federal\n\neducation law, No Child Left Behind.\n\nAiming to curb drug abuse, new program will teach teens the science of addiction\n\nMoriah Ballingit, The Washington Post\n\nChuck Rosenberg is the acting administrator of the Drug Enforcement\n\nAdministration, a former prosecutor and investigator with more than two\n\ndecades of experience. His administration is on the front lines of a\n\nrising opioid abuse epidemic that is projected to kill about 30,000\n\npeople in the United States this year. But when it comes to teaching\n\nteenagers about the dangers of opioid abuse — about how the drugs are\n\nkilling their peers — he said he realizes that he might not be the best\n\nsource.\n\nWho’s minding the neighborhood?\n\nJonathan F. Zaff and Thomas Malone, Center for Promise\n\nA new brief from the Center for Promise explores whether increasing the\n\nnumber of adults in a community results in more young people on a\n\npositive path to adult success. While there has been a steady\n\nimprovement over the last 40 years in the overall rate of youth leaving\n\nschool, researchers have long noted substantial variation by state, city\n\nand neighborhood. Using Decennial Census data (1970-2010), Center for\n\nPromise researchers looked into reasons for the variation.\n\nOctober 21, 2016\n\nMore than half of U.S. kids don’t get dental sealants, and the CDC wants schools to change that\n\nKaren Kaplan, Los Angeles Times\n\nHow can elementary schools save nearly $50 per student? By bringing in\n\ndental professionals to put sealants on their molars, federal health\n\nofficials said Tuesday. If that doesn’t sound like an education-related\n\nproblem, consider this: Cavities that go untreated cause kids to do\n\nworse in school.\n\nThe new focus on children’s mental health\n\nEmily Goldberg, The Atlantic\n\nAcross the United States, up to one in five children suffers from a\n\nmental disorder in a given year, according to the Centers for Disease\n\nControl and Prevention. This equates to more than 17 million young\n\npeople who meet criteria for disorders that affect their ability to\n\nlearn, behave, and express their emotions. Giving children access to\n\nmental-health resources early in their education, however, can play a\n\nkey role in mitigating negative consequences later in life, said David\n\nAnderson, the senior director of the ADHD and Behavior Disorders Center\n\nat the Child Mind Institute.\n\nSixth grade camp: 70 years of nature, human and otherwise, at Cuyamaca\n\nPeter Rowe, The San Diego Union-Tribune\n\nSixth-grader Josh Zientek literally immersed\n\nhimself in a cutting-edge educational tool: a tub of mud. “Get your\n\nhands in there and mix it up,” Sharyl Massey, an instructor, told\n\na gaggle of 12- and 13-year-olds gathered in a greenhouse. They were\n\npreparing soil for milkweed seeds that some day will sprout and nourish\n\nflocks of migrating Monarch butterflies.\n\nFor 70 years, Cuyamaca Outdoor School — better known as sixth grade camp\n\n— has specialized in such hands-on, low-tech assignments. Even\n\ntoday there’s a decided lack of laptops or iPads, but few seem to mind.\n\nOctober 14, 2016\n\nHere’s how schools can soften the blow of sixth grade\n\nKat Lonsdorf, NPR\n\nMiddle school is tough. Bodies change. Hormones rage. Algebra becomes a\n\nreality. But there are things schools can do to make life easier for\n\nstudents — like this big study we wrote about showing that K-8 schools\n\nmay be better for kids than traditional middle schools.\n\nBut aside from re-configuring an entire school system, are there other ways to make the sixth-grade experience better?\n\nHow a farm at an L.A. continuation school became a refuge for both students and animals\n\nSonali Kohli, Los Angeles Times\n\nMost school days, 17-year-old Alex Snyder eats lunch with a pot-bellied pig named Peanut.\n\nJohn R. Wooden High School is small. It doesn’t have a football field or\n\na swimming pool or a gym. But it has a farm. And the farm has become a\n\ncentral part of Alex’s life. “It’s my job to go around…every morning\n\nand feed the animals,” Alex recently told students visiting the\n\ngrounds during his first-period animal behavior class as he took them\n\nby a pair of tussling goats, past the shed filled with hay for the two\n\nalpacas, toward the pigs who were lying by the small pond.\n\nNew effort to promote social-emotional learning in schools\n\nEvie Blad, Education Week\n\nHelping schools figure out how to better teach social and emotional\n\nskills to students alongside traditional academic subjects will be the\n\nfocus of a new, multiyear endeavor recently announced by the Aspen\n\nInstitute. The aim of the National Commission on Social, Emotional, and\n\nAcademic Development, which has members from all three sectors, is to\n\n“advance a new vision for what constitutes success in schools,” the\n\nAspen Institute said in a statement announcing the group’s formation.\n\nOctober 7, 2016\n\nGender-neutral bathrooms, high-quality ethnic studies class and other changes coming to California schools\n\nHoward Blume, Los Angeles Times\n\nAnyone looking for confirmation of the nation’s cultural divide can add\n\neducation and gender-neutral bathrooms to the list of proof points.\n\nNorth Carolina sparked a national furor by requiring transgender people\n\nto use bathrooms corresponding to the gender on their birth\n\ncertificates, citing risks to children in schools as a primary\n\njustification. California has been shifting the other way with little\n\nfanfare.\n\nFree Wi-Fi: San Jose, East Side schools to bring internet to neighborhoods\n\nSharon Noguchi, The Mercury News\n\nAt least two Saturdays each month, a few hundred students crowd into\n\nOverfelt High School’s library and classrooms to research papers, catch\n\nup on homework and collaborate on projects.\n\nIt’s not that the students love spending weekends at school. Some are\n\ngetting extra credit or making up work, but many are drawn by the\n\nschool’s internet access — something that an estimated 400 students,\n\nnearly a third of Overfelt’s student body, don’t have at home. Soon,\n\nthat problem could disappear. In one of the nation’s first efforts at\n\ncreating a school-district-wide network that reaches into students’\n\nhomes, the East Side Union High School District and city of San Jose are\n\nteaming up to provide free wireless internet access in some of the\n\ncity’s poorest neighborhoods.\n\nSeptember 30, 2016\n\nCalifornia passes legislation requiring suicide prevention policies in schools statewide\n\nChristina Cox, The Santa Clarita Valley Signal\n\nCalifornia is now the first state in the county to require suicide prevention policies in middle schools and high schools statewide. Assembly Bill 2246 “Suicide Prevention Policies in School,” authored by Assemblymember Patrick O’Donnell (D-Long Beach) and sponsored by Equality California and The Trevor Project, was signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown Tuesday. The new law requires local district schools to adopt unique suicide prevention, intervention and follow-up plans for students in grades 7 to 12. Policymakers hope the law will save lives and reduce the statistics of what the Center for Disease Control and Prevention calls the second-leading cause of death among young people ages 10 to 24.\n\nPhysical fitness central to Sacramento district’s focus on the ‘whole child’\n\nMichael Collier, EdSource\n\nWhen Gov. Jerry Brown pushed his idea for giving local schools and districts more control over decision making, few people would have predicted that in at least one California elementary school district physical education would rise to the top of its list of priorities.\n\nThat’s what happened in the K-6 Robla School District on the outskirts of Sacramento, which serves mostly low-income Latino and Asian students. Using funds received from the Local Control Funding Formula, the district hired five new physical education teachers this year – one for each school in the district. But school leaders have gone way beyond more P.E. They have come up with an ambitious plan to revolutionize the way the district’s 2,200 students, their families, teachers and staff eat, exercise and relax – with additional help from charitable organizations.\n\nNo grammar schools, lots of play: the secrets of Europe’s top education system\n\nPatrick Butler, The Guardian\n\nIn Finland, whose comprehensive school system has sat at the top of Europe’s rankings for the past 16 years, the narrow, heated debates on school governance and structure that obsess the UK – free schools, academies, grammars – do not exist. Schools ultimately deliver academic success, the Finns would agree – and there has been intense worldwide interest in how they manage it (see below) – but they would also argue that groundwork for good school performance begins earlier, long before children enter formal school, and arguably while their future pupils are still in nappies.\n\nSeptember 23, 2016\n\nCalifornia moves forward in 8-state collaboration on social and emotional learning\n\nJane Meredith Adams, EdSource\n\nThe California Department of Education has named 13 educators to a planning team to develop social and emotional learning guidelines for schools across the state, a sign of the growing state and national interest in teaching students the interpersonal skills that contribute to success in college and work. The planning team marks the start of California’s involvement in a new eight-state project known as the Collaborating States Initiative, launched in July by the Collaborative for Academic, Social and Emotional Learning, a Chicago-based nonprofit. The two-year initiative is intended to help state educators understand what social and emotional learning — which includes teaching students to listen respectfully, manage stress and set personal goals — looks like in the classroom and how states might map out a grade-level guide to developmentally appropriate skills.\n\nPeer-led anti-bullying efforts yield payoffs\n\nSarah D. Sparks, Education Week\n\nNo matter how diligent teachers and administrators are, it’s easy for bullying to happen under the noses of adults at school. In the bathrooms, the hallways, and on social media, students are often the only ones around to police themselves. That’s why researchers at Princeton, Rutgers, and Yale universities are analyzing middle schoolers’ social networks to find the students most likely to change their classmates’ attitudes around bullying. They are finding that bullying is generally driven not by a few bad apples but by a majority of students within the overall culture of a school.\n\nHere’s how schools can support students’ mental health\n\nMeg Anderson, NPR\n\nAbout one in five children in the United States shows signs of a mental health disorder — anything from ADHD to eating disorders to suicide. And yet, as we’ve been reporting this month, many schools aren’t prepared to work with these students. Often, there’s been too little training in recognizing the problems, the staff who are trained are overworked, and there just isn’t enough money. When there are enough people to handle the job, how should all the different roles fit together?"
