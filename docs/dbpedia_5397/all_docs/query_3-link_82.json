        "text": "The lack of external regulation about the form and substance of the financial statements that railroad companies had to report during the implementation phase of the Spanish railway, meant that each company developed its own accounting model. In this study we have described, analysed and interpreted the more relevant changes in the accounting information in relation to the business result. Using the analysis of an historical case, we developed an ad-hoc research tool, for recording all the changes of the operating account. The results of the study prove that MZA's operating account reflected the particularities of the railway business although subject to limitations, and the reported information improved during the study period in terms of relevance and reliability Resumen La falta de regulación externa de la forma y fondo de los estados financieros que debían reportar las compañías ferroviarias durante la fase de implantación del ferrocarril español, hizo que cada ferroviaria desarrollase su propio modelo contable. En este trabajo hemos descrito, analizado e interpretado los cambios más relevantes de la información contable reportada sobre el resultado del negocio. Utilizando el análisis del caso histórico, desarrollamos una herramienta de investigación ad-hoc, para recopilar todos los cambios de la cuenta de explotación. Los resultados del estudio demuestran que la cuenta de explotación de MZA reflejó las particularidades del negocio ferroviario aunque sujeto a limitaciones, y la información reportada mejoró en términos de relevancia y fiabilidad a lo largo del periodo de análisis. Palabras clave: contabilidad ferroviaria, Compañía ferroviaria MZA, Cuenta de Explotación, proceso productivo ferroviario. * Acknowledgements We gratefully acknowledge helpful comments and suggestions from the editor, two anonymous reviewer, Trevor Boyns, and Richard Edwards (Cardiff Business School, UK).\n\nThe history of the Estrada de Ferro Sorocabana is highly idiosyncratic. Owned and run successively by Brazilian businessmen, the federal government, and the government of the State of São Paulo, it would be rented out to a foreign company over the period 1907-1919. When it began operating, coffee did not represent a significant share of its overall freight receipt, and even later it would not achieve the relevance it did in Mogiana and Paulista, considered the typical \"coffee railways.\" Unlike these two profitable companies, Sorocabana remained in dire financial straits almost throughout the period 1872-1919. This paper focuses on what lay behind its financial distress. The literature on pioneering railway companies in Brazil emphasises that profitability hinged on the type of ownership as well as on whether coffee was the main source of freight receipt. Besides this, the following hypotheses are evaluated: oversanguine expectations about future cash flows; poor management; shortage of governance engendered by its financing structure; bad luck; and bad governmental policy.\n\nThis paper intends to analyse the legal framework of the International Accounting Standard (IAS) 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and its implantation in Portugal. The methodology presented is subdivided in a theoretical analysis, with a literature review, and in an empirical analysis, with a case study (Yin, 2018). The available data provided is based on the annual accounts of the railway sector. The results show that accounting information is substantially different from the globality of the other corporations."
