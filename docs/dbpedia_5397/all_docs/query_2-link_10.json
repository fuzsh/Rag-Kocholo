        "text": "113\n\nThe transformation of La Robla\n\nLa Robla is a town in Leon located in the Eastern Mountain. With a population of around 3,600 inhabitants, in the past it reached close to 6,000 inhabitants at the beginning of the 80s. However, the town has had to deal with several closures, such as that of the thermal power plant that operated in the town and the coal mines of Hullera Basc Leonesa. This has posed a challenge for the future of La Robla, but the town is determined to reinvent itself and bet on renewable energies.\n\nThe Robla Green project\n\nTo overcome the closures and promote sustainable development, La Robla is promoting a project called Robla Green. This project will allow the inhabitants of La Robla to continue producing energy, but in a completely different way. Now, the town will generate energy through photovoltaic panels and the burning of biomass. This initiative seeks to take advantage of the area’s natural resources to produce clean and sustainable energy.\n\nNaturgy’s photovoltaic plants\n\nIn addition to the Robla Green project, La Robla has received good news this spring. Naturgy has obtained authorization to build two photovoltaic plants near the old La Robla coal plant. These facilities, called ‘La Prada’ and ‘Els Corrals’, will have an installed capacity of 195 MW and 225 MW respectively. They will generate a total of 700 GWh of electricity per year, enough to supply more than 210,000 homes. This energy production will contribute to the Robla Green project and help the transition towards a more sustainable energy model.\n\nThe production of biomass and e-methanol\n\nWithin the Robla Green project, a biomass plant called Roblum will be built. This plant will use agricultural waste such as corn straw and other crops to generate energy. In addition, a green methanol factory called La Robla Nueva Energía will be developed. This green methanol will be produced by electrolysis of green hydrogen generated from biomass. E-methanol is an emissions-neutral fuel and will be used to decarbonize the chemical industry and transport sectors.\n\nInvestment and job creation\n\nThe implementation of the Robla Green project will require an investment of 440 million euros. This investment will allow the construction of the biomass plant and the green methanol factory. The works will start in 2024 and it is expected that they will employ around 450 workers. Once the facilities are operational, 100 direct jobs will be created and another 90 related to biomass production. Although these figures are lower than previous employment levels, the project will contribute to revitalizing the Ciñera-Matallana region and diversifying the local economy."
