        "text": "Discovery Day of La Robla Green, the world's first biomass power plant with a negative CO₂ balance. Located in La Robla (León, Spain).\n\nIt is the response from Reolum, Spanish developer in renewable energy, to a global challenge,\n\nMeeting commitments to curb Climate Change.\n\nMoving towards energy autonomy.\n\nAchieving net-zero CO₂ emissions by 2050.\n\nDecarbonizing the Spanish electricity sector (at least 37% of the energy generated in 2022 came from non-nuclear fossil sources).\n\nAdvancing the ecological transition process in industries towards sustainable circular economy models.\n\nResponding to the search for alternatives to fossil fuels in transportation through green e-methanol.\n\nLa Robla Green is also our response at the local level,\n\nPromoting a new green economy in territories affected by the end of coal-related activities (these areas are labelled as ‘Transición Justa’ in Spain).\n\nDriving projects with a boosting effect on the local economy.\n\nHalting depopulation in La Robla. The town has lost 35% of its population in recent decades.\n\nCreating quality employment in an area managed as ‘Transición Justa’.\n\nMaking better use of renewable agricultural resources in the region and valorizing them for emissions-neutral energy generation.\n\nLa Robla Green is the fusion of two projects, ‘Roblum’ and ‘La Robla Nueva Energía’ resulting in a synergistic powerhouse greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nMeet Roblum,\n\nThe world's first biomass power plant with a negative CO₂ balance. The CO₂ absorbed by biomass offsets the emissions produced by the facilities, and it will also be captured for use in green e-methanol production.\n\nMeet La Robla Nueva Energía,\n\nThe world's first green e-methanol plant. Methanol is highly demanded due to its numerous industrial applications: solvent, antifreeze, paints, construction materials, textile industry, chemical and pharmaceutical industry, as well as fuel production. Green e-methanol is produced from hydrogen generated using renewable electricity (known as green hydrogen) and carbon dioxide captured from biomass combustion. Green e-methanol is a key component in the decarbonization of the chemical industry."
