        "text": "Liked: To start, Chris is the most amazing host you will ever meet. Coming to Thorpe Hall is a blessing if you are looking for a place to get away from it all. This is a working farm, so if your coming in your Guccis, look elsewhere, however if you want to be somewhere where you are greeted by goats in the morning, want to walk through glorious land for miles on end and escape for a few days, this is for you. The caravan itself is well equipped with everything you need, including a small oven and hob, which I’ve successfully used to cook many meals! The double bed is comfortable and a Z bed is usually available if you have an extra guest, make sure you ask in advance. There is a bucket style toilet and no shower, however you have use of the facilities in the main manor opposite for this purpose. Chris goes out of his way to interact and make sure you’re comfortable, despite being extremely busy with his farm and business - nothing is too much hassle. He had a sound understanding of the area, and can happily guide you to the nearest pub or town, some of which are on foot, if you like a walk! Haddiscoe train station is easily accessible with trains into Lowestoft and Norwich, making this an ideal location for a visit to the seaside or to a major city, boasting an amazing cathedral. I cannot fault this place - some might - if they are expecting 5G phone signal, a TV or the ultimate in luxury - it’s not that and doesn’t pretend to be. It’s a beautiful rural setting, where you go to escape from it all, see clear skies with gleaming stars and embrace nature. Chris, we cannot wait to return\n\nRecommend to friends Visit again"
