Haddiscoe station is similar.\n\nIn that area, there are several other stations just beyond a 0m line, so they must be at just a couple of metres above sea level . Are there are any other - surface(!) - stations in the country below sea level?\n\nThe first place I looked was around the Duddon Estuary (Kirkby-in-Furness, Foxfield, Green Road) but these are all between 0 and 10m!\n\nSponsor Post - registered members do not see these adverts; click here to register, or click here to log in\n\nR\n\nRailUK Forums\n\n22 Aug 2019\n\n#2\n\nphiljo\n\nEstablished Member\n\nJoined\n\n9 Jun 2009\n\nMessages\n\n2,904\n\nI think the town of Spalding is about 10m above sea level. Though one section of the line in that area was shown as below sea level when I was looking at the map during an ECML diversion a couple of years ago.\n\n22 Aug 2019\n\n#3\n\n61653 HTAFC\n\nVeteran Member\n\nJoined\n\n18 Dec 2012\n\nMessages\n\n17,917\n\nLocation\n\nYorkshire\n\nI've heard it said that Dundee station is below sea level, no idea if that's true.\n\nThough not surface, Liverpool James Street is below sea level, not sure about the rest of the Merseyrail central stations. The Wirral line platforms will probably be below, if not the Northern line ones.\n\n22 Aug 2019\n\n#4\n\nnlogax\n\nEstablished Member\n\nJoined\n\n29 May 2011\n\nMessages\n\n5,483\n\nLocation\n\nMostly Glasgow-ish.
