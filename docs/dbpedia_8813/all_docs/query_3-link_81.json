Alternatively, the Gatwick Airport website gives further information train, coach and bus routes, and also car hire.\n\nTrains\n\nThe Gatwick Express provides a non-stop service to London Victoria station departing every 15 minutes and taking about 30 minutes journey time. Details of prices, special offers and advance booking can be found on the Gatwick Express website or by calling 0845 850 1530 (UK only).\n\nRegular rail services from Gatwick link the airport directly with destinations to London and to the south coast including Brighton and Eastbourne, as well as to Portsmouth, Southampton and Guildford. Most towns and cities in the region also have good rail links to other destinations throughout the South East and to other parts of the country.\n\nThe National Rail Enquiries website and Trainline website provides full details on rail services and ticket prices throughout the UK which will help you to plan your visit to the area.\n\nRoads\n\nThe region is well served by several motorways including the M25 London orbital, M23 connecting Gatwick Airport with London and the south coast, as well as the M2 and M20 to Kent and the east, and M3 to destinations in the west.\n\nTravelling by bus can be a rewarding way to see the countryside up close and to experience some of local life.\n\nMany destinations and visitor attractions can be visited by rail or bus, and details of public transport options to each destination have been provided on this website wherever possible. However, due to the rural nature of the countryside where many historic visitor attractions are located, it is not always possible to easily visit by public transport alone. You may therefore want to consider using public transport and combining this with local taxi services to your final destination.\n\nInternational Travel"
