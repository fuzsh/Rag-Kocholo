        "text": "Serving the Derbyshire town of Buxton, the station was opened in June 1863. Originally two stations were planned, however, the town council believed that the beauty of the local area would be adversely affected, so the stations were built next to each other. Given identical designs, including locally quarried stone, a wrought iron and glass roof, and beautiful semi-circle fan windows. Although most of the two stations were demolished in 1969, the iconic fan windows have been saved.\n\nSitting in the heart of Buxton, the station is the perfect place for visiting the heritage and attractions of the area, and with the University of Derby nearby, the station serves nearly half a million passengers every year.\n\nHow far is Buxton Station from Manchester Airport?\n\nIt takes around an hour and a half to travel by train from Buxton Station to Manchester Airport.\n\nHow far is the walk from Buxton Station to Buxton city centre?\n\nThe walk from the station takes approximately 4 minutes.\n\nDoes Buxton Station have car park facilities?\n\nThere are 53 car parking spaces at Buxton Station.\n\nAre there secure bike storage facilities at Buxton Station?\n\nBuxton Station has 24 secure bike parking spaces.\n\nWhat facilities are available at Buxton Station?\n\nToilets\n\nTelephones - coins and card\n\nDisabled Access - step-free access throughout, plus ramps and induction loops available"
