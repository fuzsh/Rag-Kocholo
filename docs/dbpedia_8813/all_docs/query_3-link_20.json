        "text": "Having spent a couple of days at Oulton Broad where they hired some rather nice wooden motor launches and visited the seafront at Lowestoft, the end of the previous post saw the family casting off from the Yacht Station to continue their holiday on the Broads in June 1933.\n\nThe next section of the film shows them heading upstream on the Waveney and the first scene we see is of St. Mary’s Church at Burgh St. Peter as they pass. It is quite a different scene to that which we see today as the church was then highly visible from the river. This is one of the very dramatic differences seen in some of the landscape on the southern rivers in this film – areas that are now quite heavily tree lined were very open and stark. Much of this was as a result of the deliberate cutting down and clearance of trees to allow the maximum amount of wind possible to reach the sails of the wherries which once plied their trade up and down the rivers …. too many trees would obviously hamper their progress! The distinctive, tiered tower of St. Mary’s Church was clad with ivy at the time this film was shot and must have been quite an impressive sight from the river, dominating the landscape as it did. It’s a fascinating little church and we spent a few hours wandering around looking at some of the gravestones last year. The great age to which some of the past inhabitants, several of whom were wherryman, lived in the late 1800s was remarkable really … proof that Broadland air must be good for you! The main body of the church is medieval, but by the late 1700s the tower had fallen into disrepair. The local Lord of the Manor, Samuel Boycott, was granted permission to build a new tower which was reputedly based on a church which his son had seen in Italy whilst on a grand tour. Boycott apparently thought it would be a fitting mausoleum for family burials within the church.\n\nThe film cuts to more scenes of the family as they cruise along. It’s obviously a hot and sunny day as sun lotion of some sort is being liberally applied to one of the son’s ears! The next scene shows the dad and three children rowing in the tender. It took me a while to work out that this was actually filmed at Geldeston Lock as there is very little background seen. Knowing that they have just travelled up the Waveney, and that the following scenes show them cruising back through Beccles, Geldeston must be the obvious location really, and what you can see in the clip does fit with this. They appear to be rowing out of the cut which now leads to the BA 24 hour moorings and would have led directly to the lock itself back then. They have just reached the corner of the island where the channel splits and leads off up to the footbridge today but, when the lock was still operational, led to a sluice. In 1933 the lock was still working …. just! How navigable the river beyond it was by this time, I don’t know, as use of the Bungay navigation had been in severe decline and it was actually closed the year after this film was shot. Sadly there is no footage of the lock itself or of the inn and there is no evidence of the family having travelled any further up the Waveney.\n\nBack on the river aboard Countess of Light, they are now seen cruising through Beccles and we encounter one of the lost railway bridges of Broadland as they approach, and then pass beneath, the old fixed rail bridge which crossed the river a little way upstream from the road bridge. This was part of the Waveney Valley line which ran between Beccles and Tivetshall where it then connected with the main London to Norwich line – there were stations at Geldeston, Harleston and Pulham along the way. It was originally intended to run from Beccles to Diss, but the terminus was eventually moved slightly further north, although I haven’t been able to establish why this was as yet. The line opened in 1863 and later became part of the Great Eastern Railway Company who’s initials can be seen on what remains of one of the bridge supports at the side of the river, the other support (on the Beccles side) has since had a house built on it. I believe that passenger services ceased around 1953 although I have read that freight continued to use the line up until the bridge was demolished c1966.\n\nThe family are following another small motor cruiser as they pass beneath the bridge and there are various boats and houseboats seen moored to the side. The film cuts to see them approaching the old road bridge and it’s interesting to see people bathing in the river there, climbing out via a ladder which is attached to the quayside. Once again, the passage beneath is filmed, whilst a couple of people standing on the bridge watch on, and it’s definatelyt another “duck” moment as the camera rolls until the last second! I am not entirely sure what the large building seen beyond the bridge to the right was … possibly a warehouse of some sort? Further along the Waveney they encounter what appears to be a Thames barge travelling in the opposite direction, the cameraman looks behind to continue filming it once it has passed and you can see that they are only a short way out of Beccles. The barge is presumably under engine power as the sails are down.\n\nThe cameraman does appear to have been extremely interested in the Broadland bridges, which makes me wonder whether he possibly had some sort of engineering background as he filmed so many of those which they encountered during their holidays. The next scene was presumably shot on the Waveney somewhere between Beccles and Haddiscoe and shows a very nice little sailing boat with an unusual sail arrangement. My knowledge of sailing craft is extremely limited so I have absolutely no idea whether this is a half decker or something else. There don’t appear to be any markings on the sails which might give me some clues …. any help with identifying this would be very welcome!\n\nMoving on, the camera now captures footage of yet another long lost bridge as they film their passage beneath the old Haddiscoe lifting bridge which crossed the New Cut slightly south of where the current road bridge runs. My notes on the history of this particular bridge are a little patchy at the moment but it was apparently built as a toll bridge and a fee was collected for passing over it or beneath it. In the 1930s the toll was two shillings which you dropped into a bag which was held out on a long poll as you passed – sadly this transaction wasn’t caught on camera as they are quite close to the bridge itself when the filming begins. It really was a rickety looking old thing! I believe that the new road bridge was built c1960. Once through, the cameraman looks back towards the bridge and you can clearly see the Haddiscoe High Level rail swing bridge in the background. The piers on which the rail bridge once stood are a familiar obstacle in the middle of the river now, but it was once part of the line which carried trains between Beccles and Great Yarmouth, crossing the Waveney at Aldeby (where further piers still remain in situ in the river) and then back over at Haddiscoe before heading in to Yarmouth. This particular line closed to passengers in 1959, although I believe part of it continued to be used by freight trains during the sugar beet season until the two swing bridges were finally demolished in the latter half of the 1960s.\n\nThere is a little more footage of the wash hitting the piling along the the New Cut, and the dinghy being towed behind them as they cruise along. As they reach Reedham, the swing bridge is closing as they approach and we see the youngest son sitting on the bow. Sadly, there is no further footage of Reedham, which is a real shame! The next section of the film is quite intriguing as it is obviously shot inside a Broadland inn and shows the two youngest children standing next to a pianola. The boy is waving his arms in time to the music and pretending to play a trombone. He then winds it up again using the handle at the side and both children do some more conducting along to the music.\n\nI can only assume that this was in fact taken inside the Red House at Cantley as the next shot shows Countess of Light moored directly in front of the pub. The walls are almost completely covered by climbing plants but the building is very distinctive and easily recognisable. This seems to have been filmed from the tender once again, the rest of the family are sitting on the coach roof and one of the boys is fishing. Cantley had been an extremely popular sailing center and fishing resort during Victorian and Edwardian times, before the sugar beet factory was built in 1912, and the Red House was a well frequented inn. The name was changed to the Reedcutters in 2004. The next post will cover the last part of their holiday when the family have returned to the northern rivers, stopping at Stokesby once again before heading to Horning, Wroxham and the Upper Bure beyond."
