        "text": "At the end of this month, track replacement works at Somerleyton on the line between Norwich and Lowestoft.\n\nOn Saturday 28th/ Sunday 29th November and on Saturday 5th / Sunday 6th December and Sunday 13th December with replacement bus services in operation.\n\nThe work will see one mile of track replaced using 2420 concrete sleepers and 6240 tonnes of ballast. In addition, new decks will be installed at two user worked level crossings.\n\nThe work will avoid the need for speed restrictions on the worn-out track.\n\nOn Saturdays buses will replace trains between Norwich and Lowestoft via Oulton Broad North all day. Buses will run between Great Yarmouth, Oulton Broad North and Lowestoft, connecting out of train services from Norwich to Great Yarmouth (via Reedham), with a shuttle bus between Haddiscoe and Lowestoft via Somerleyton.\n\nOn Sundays, buses will replace trains between Norwich and Lowestoft via Oulton Broad North all day, with buses also operating between Great Yarmouth, Oulton Broad North and Lowestoft.\n\nPassengers should check National Rail Enquiries for full details.\n\nEllie Burrows, Network Rail's route director for Anglia, said: “We're carrying out this work to keep services running safely, smoothly and reliably. The work will reduce the number of delays and cancellations caused by track faults at Somerleyton, benefitting passengers travelling between Norwich and Lowestoft.”\n\nJamie Burles, Greater Anglia Managing Director, said: “This work will help to improve punctuality and performance along this vital part of the line.\n\n“We will be running a rail replacement bus service while the work takes place so customers will be able to complete their journeys. Passengers should check before they travel, allow more time for their journey and wear a face covering when travelling by train or rail replacement bus.\n\n“We would like to thank customers for their patience while this work takes places.”\n\nWhere Next?"
