They can be collected at any time, but you’ll need to make sure you have them with you before you travel. If you choose to collect your ticket at the station, the delivery fee is £1.00. For some bookings you'll need to use the card you paid with to collect your tickets.\n\nYou can collect your tickets from any UK station with a collection machine, it doesn’t have to be the station you’re travelling from.
