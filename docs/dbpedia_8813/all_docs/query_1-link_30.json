        "text": "There are a number of historic bridges in The Broads which present a navigational challenge to yachts and larger vessels.\n\nYachts will typically need to lower their masts when navigating through most bridges in The Broads. There are also rail bridges at Somerleyton, Reedham, Trowse and Oulton Broad that have been constructed with swing mechanisms which are staffed and opened by Network Rail as required by individual vessels. Other types of bridges open by lifting mechanisms and these are at Breydon Water, Novi Sad, St Julian's and Carrow Road bridge in Norwich.\n\nPlease note that the Broads Authority does not operate the swing bridges or lifting bridges in the navigation area. However, for the three Norwich bridges an opening can be arranged through Broads Control on 01603 756056 providing at least 24 hours notice.\n\nAlthough the rail swing bridges at Somerleyton and Reedham may be opened by Network Rail without a direct contact being made with the operator, individual vessels may use VHF channel 12 to request a specific opening where required. The bridges can be swung 24 hours a day.\n\nTrowse bridge currently is currently experiencing mechanical problems requiring extra assistance to operate. Network Rail therefore require seven days’ notice to open the bridge. The opening times are 9.05 am on Sundays and any day between 02.00 am and 04.00 am. To arrange opening please call Network Rail on either 01603 675297 or 01603 763440. Any problems in arranging the opening of the bridge should be reported to the Broads Authority Monitoring Officer on 01603 756085 or to rob.rogers@broads-authority.gov.uk, who will be pleased to assist.\n\nBridge contact information\n\nYou can now contact the Network Rail swing bridge operators directly using the following details:\n\nTrowse swing bridge: Tel 01603 675297 or 01603 763440 (seven days notice required for openings).\n\nOulton Broad swing bridge: Tel 0330 852 5351.\n\nReedham Swing Bridge: Tel 0330 858 4655.\n\nSomerleyton Swing Bridge: Tel 0330 858 4656.\n\nContact to the Swing Bridge operators is also available on VHF Radio Channel 12.\n\nFor vessels entering the Broads from the sea, through Great Yarmouth, the information giving estimated bridge air draughts to Chart Datum is provided on the Peel Ports website. See section 4 of this downloadable Great Yarmouth Bridges document (PDF).\n\nThe values in the table of Section 4 of the linked document give the approximate clearances (in metres) at the height of tide indicated. Tide tables are available on the Peel Ports Great Yarmouth website (times and heights used by Peel Ports refer to the mouth of the River Yare).\n\nMutford Lock\n\nMutford Lock, at the western end of Lake Lothing, allows craft visiting Lowestoft access to the Broads. Lowestoft Harbour bridge and the rail/road bridges at Oulton Broad must be passed before reaching the lock.\n\nThe lock is operated by Oulton Broad Yacht Station and passage can be organised by using VHF Channel 73, or phoning 01502 523408 (Yacht Station) or 01502 531778 (Lock).\n\nOpenings:\n\nApril to October: 08:00 - 18:00, seven days per week but bank holidays are 24hr advance booking only.\n\nNovember to March: 08.00 - 12.00, seven days per week but not available on bank holidays.\n\nA charge of £17.00 per day is made per vessel for the use of the lock (which includes a return journey on the same day). This charge also covers visiting vessels for the use of Oulton Broad (only) on the day of entry and up to midnight on the day following. For longer stays or to cruise further into the system a Short Visit Toll remains payable.\n\nBreydon Bridge\n\nBreydon Bridge carries the A47 in Great Yarmouth across the River Yare close to Breydon Water. It is a single-span drawbridge with an opening span width of 23m.\n\nVessels will be grouped together on lifts whenever possible. When craft are to transit the bridge in opposite directions, those vessels going ‘with the tide’ will be given priority.\n\nLifts for weekends should be booked by 16:00 on Friday or on the previous working day in the case of Public Holidays.\n\nTo arrange passage phone the bookings line on 01493 651275, email greatyarmouthbreydon.bridge@peelports.com or use call sign “Breydon Bridge” on VHF Channel 12.\n\nThe Bridge is only manned ten minutes before a lift and vessels waiting for a lift should seek advice from the Bridge Master if in any doubt.\n\nOther Great Yarmouth Bridges\n\nHaven Bridge\n\nHaven Bridge is a double bascule lifting bridge located in Great Yarmouth, with an opening span width of 26.8m.\n\nVessels will be grouped together on lifts whenever possible. When craft are to transit the bridge in opposite directions, those vessels going ‘with the tide’ will be given priority.\n\nLifts for weekends should be booked by 16:00 on Friday or on the previous working day in the case of Public Holidays.\n\nTo arrange passage phone the bookings line on 01493 335522, email greatyarmouthoperations@peelports.com or use call sign “Haven Bridge” on VHF Channel 12.\n\nThe Bridge is only manned ten minutes before a lift and vessels waiting for a lift should seek advice from the Bridge Master if in any doubt.\n\nHerring Bridge\n\nHerring Bridge (also known as 'Third River Crossing') is a newly-built bascule bridge which crosses the River Yare in Great Yarmouth. It is outside of our executive area but large vessels wishing to visit the Broads from the sea will need to pass through it.\n\nThe location of Herring Bridge is between Breydon Water and the North Sea, near William Adams Way. It connects Harfrey’s Roundabout (A47) on the west side of the River Yare to the peninsula of Great Yarmouth on the east side, at South Denes Road (A1243).\n\nFor information on the bridge and arranging passage see the Norfolk County Council website.\n\nList of bridges\n\nClearance measurements for bridges given are at Average High Water during summer. There will be greater clearance near Low Water, especially at Great Yarmouth and in the southern rivers. Barometric pressure, rainfall and wind conditions affect river levels so caution should be exercised and bridge gauge board carefully noted.\n\n* Arched bridges\n\nNB In all cases, tidal levels can vary considerably and so affect the above figures.\n\nBridge Pilots\n\nAt Potter Heigham hire boats must use the bridge pilot from Phoenix Fleet boatyard. Pilot service available 8.30am-6.00pm, depending on tide and weather conditions. Telephone 01692 670460.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nWill my boat pass through the bridge?\n\nPassing under bridges can be dangerous if not done properly. Know the air draft of your boat (the height of your boat from the waterline to the highest part of the boat) and check the clearance available on the gauge board at each bridge every time you pass through. Tides and rainfall amounts can alter the level of the water and so the amount of clearance will also vary by several feet in some places.\n\nWhat is a gauge board and how does it work?\n\nMost bridges have a gauge board which give you the definite current clearance available (below you can see a picture of a gauge board). Where the water lines up with a measurement will give you the clearance currently available at any given time. e.g. in the picture the water lines up with 9'9\" or 3m, and so this would be the clearance available. You still need to take account of other issues, including wind and waves as this can mean you boat rises and falls, so please allow more clearance in poor conditions.\n\nYou should also consider the shape of bridge (arch bridges can mean more clearance will be required for wider boats), the design of the boat and the experience of the person at the helm. Most bridges also have advance gauge boards in place so you can see the available clearance before reaching a bridge in order to plan your timings ahead of your arrival.\n\nWho has right of way?\n\nVessels travelling against the current (into the flow) must give way and allow vessels travelling with the current (being pushed by the flow) to pass through the bridge first.\n\nFlow of water under bridges\n\nBe aware that bridges create a narrowing in the river and can cause the flow to increase in speed meaning you may feel like your boat has slowed, do not increase speed as this will lead to an increase in wash. Once through the bridge the flow will return to normal.\n\nWhat about the people onboard?\n\nThe helm should ensure the boat and everyone onboard is prepared well in advance of reaching the bridge. If required, windscreens should be lowered and anything that has been placed on top of the vessel removed. Crew members must get to a lower part of the vessel and prepare to duck down if necessary. Life jackets should be worn by everyone out on deck.\n\nHow can I get a swing bridge to open?\n\nA single red flag indicates the bridge is working and in service, two red flags indicate it is not working and it is not in service. In the photograph you can see Reedham Swing Bridge flying one red flag to show it is working and in service.\n\nYou will also need to take note of any bridge keeper’s signboards. The 'bridge will open' board relates only to the waiting time. This is a fixed sign and will not be withdrawn even when the bridge goes 'off service'.\n\nThe signal requiring the bridge to open is three prolonged blasts on the horn or whistle. Most bridges also monitor VHF Channel 12, but during urgent or emergency matters relating to the rail network, the radio will not be answered.\n\nIf you have any problems you can contact Broads Control on 01603 756056.\n\nMy boat might not clear the bridge if I don't lower my screen etc. but I'd rather leave the boat as it is. Will the bridge still open?\n\nThe bridge will only open for craft clearly unable to pass under.\n\nWhat should I do whilst waiting for the bridge to open?\n\nPower driven boats navigating against the current or tidal flow should ease speed or stop when approaching a bridge to allow boats navigating with the current or tidal flow to have right of way.\n\nWhilst waiting for the bridge to open, keep well clear. Tides can run very strongly, especially at Reedham and Somerleyton. Pontoons are available for boats waiting for bridges at upstream and downstream of Reedham and Somerleyton bridges. Please take note of the tidal flow direction when mooring on the pontoons and ensure you approach into the tide.\n\nDo bridges have scheduled opening times?\n\nReedham and Somerleyton swing bridges have no scheduled times, but opening throughout the day is dependent on the train timetable. Trowse swing bridge requires advanced notice to open which can be arrange through Broads Control 01603 756056.\n\nA train crossed over the bridge 10 minutes ago but the bridge has still not opened, why?\n\nThe bridge operator has to wait for a safety clearance signal from operators further down the line before opening the bridge.\n\nAlternatively there may be another train due, or there may be an emergency which takes priority over opening the bridge.\n\nWhen I see the bridge open should I hurry through?\n\nNo, you should never ‘race’ for a bridge. Please consider moored boats and monitor your boat wash and keep to the speed limits."
