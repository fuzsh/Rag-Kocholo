        "text": "Railway station in Norfolk, England\n\nFor the former Norfolk Railway station in the same town, see Haddiscoe railway station (Norfolk Railway).\n\nHaddiscoe railway station (formerly Haddiscoe Low Level) is a stop on the Wherry Lines in Norfolk, England. It named after the village of Haddiscoe, some 2 miles (3.2 km) away; however, the village of St Olaves, sited on the other side of the River Waveney, is closer. The station is 16 miles 11 chains (26 km) down the line from Norwich, on the route to Lowestoft; it is situated between Reedham and Somerleyton. Its three-letter station code is HAD.\n\nHaddiscoe station is managed by Greater Anglia, which also operates all trains serving the station.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nAn earlier Haddiscoe station was opened by the Norfolk Railway in 1847 but was later closed by the Great Eastern Railway in 1904. It was replaced by this station, originally named Haddiscoe Low Level, at the junction of the Wherry Line and the now closed Yarmouth-Beccles Line from London to Yarmouth.\n\nAn existing station on the Yarmouth-Beccles Line at this junction was renamed from Herringfleet Junction to Haddiscoe High Level at the same time.[1]\n\nBoth the High Level station and the Low Level station operated until the British Transport Commission withdrew services on the Yarmouth line in 1959 and closed the associated High Level station. British Railways subsequently renamed the remaining station Haddiscoe.[1]\n\nA link between the two lines existed, controlled by Haddiscoe Junction signal box. In 1961,the signal box was preserved in the transport gallery at the Science Museum, Kensington, where it was adapted to display various kinds of signalling equipment.[2] In 1995 it was moved to the Mangapps Railway Museum.\n\nServices\n\n[edit]\n\nThe typical off-peak service at Haddiscoe is as follows:[3]\n\nOperator Route Rolling stock Typical frequency Greater Anglia Lowestoft - Oulton Broad North - Somerleyton - Haddiscoe - Reedham - Cantley - Brundall - Norwich Class 755 1x every 2 hours in each direction\n\nPreceding station National Rail Following station Reedham Greater Anglia\n\nWherry Lines\n\nLowestoft branch Somerleyton\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nSources\n\n[edit]\n\n^ Ordnance Survey (2005).
