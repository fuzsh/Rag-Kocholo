        "text": "Region & Route:\n\nEastern: Anglia\n\nNetwork Rail will be conducting essential track maintenance and timber renewals between Norwich and Cromer, Sheringham, Great Yarmouth, and Lowestoft on five consecutive weekends starting this October.\n\nWork will take place over the following weekends:\n\n- Saturday 7 October and Sunday 8 October\n\n- Saturday 14 October and Sunday 15 October\n\n- Saturday 21 October and Sunday 22 October\n\n- Saturday 28 October and Sunday 29 October\n\n- Saturday 4 November and Sunday 5 November\n\nRegular maintenance is essential to keep the signalling and control systems functioning correctly, to maintain safety of rail users. We’ll also be working to improve the stability of the railway tracks by clearing wet beds; sections of track saturated by water which can cause dips in the rails, giving passengers a ‘bumpy’ ride.\n\nWe will also be renewing sleeper timbers in the Brundal Gardens area. These timbers have reached the end of their service life, and their renewal is necessary to maintain safe operations and prevent potential speed restrictions.\n\nInformation for Greater Anglia Passengers\n\nBuses will replace trains between Norwich and Sheringham each weekend except for 14 and 15 October when the railway will remain open. Buses will call at all stations except Gunton, as it cannot be served by inaccessible roads.\n\nOn the East Suffolk line buses will replace trains between Lowestoft and Halesworth on 14 and 15 October only. Connecting trains will operate between Halesworth and Ipswich.\n\nOn the weekends of 28 and 29 October, and 4 and 5 November, buses will also replace trains between:\n\n- Norwich and Great Yarmouth, calling at Brundall Gardens, Brundall, Lingwood, and Acle.\n\n- Lingwood and Reedham, calling at Cantley.\n\n- Norwich and Lowestoft, calling at Oulton Broad North.\n\nBuckenham, Haddiscoe, and Somerleyton stations cannot be served by rail replacement buses due to inaccessible roads.\n\nFull details and journey planners are available on greateranglia.co.uk or nationalrail.co.uk\n\nMark Walker, Network Rail Anglia route infrastructure engineer, said: Mark Walker, Network Rail Anglia route infrastructure engineer, said: “We’re focused on delivering important maintenance tasks, to maintain the safe and efficient running of the railway.\n\nCompleting these tasks will directly contribute to the reliability of train journeys and safety which is our top priority. I want to thank all our customers for their patience while we carry out these essential maintenance tasks.”"
