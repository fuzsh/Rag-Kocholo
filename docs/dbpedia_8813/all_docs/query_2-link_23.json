        "text": "Background on flood defences\n\nThe Environment Agency owns the land that includes the bed of the Haddiscoe New Cut and a thin strip of land between it and the railway, as well as the flood defences.\n\nIn 2001, the agency kicked off the Broadland flood alleviation project, which aimed to strengthen the flood defences in the area. It contracted the planning, design and construction work for the project to the Broadland Environmental Services consortium, comprising Bam Nuttall and Jacobs.\n\nDue to the undulating nature of clay banks in the area, crest piling was used to provide a consistent flood defence height.\n\nThe service level, or nominal flood defence height, alongside the railway at New Cut was determined as 1.7m above ordnance datum (AOD), which was higher than the adjacent railway track level at about 1.25m AOD. An allowance for ongoing ground settlement meant that the consortium installed the crest piles along New Cut to a minimum crest height of 1.9m AOD.\n\nIn May 2021, the Environment Agency took back responsibility for the assets.\n\nRAIBâ€™s investigation into the incident showed that in some locations, the top of the crest piles was lower than the 1.7m AOD service level. It said that ongoing ground settlement due to compression of natural soils is a feature of the Broadlands and affects both embankments and crest piles. This is demonstrated by the crest pile settlement that was found to have occurred between November 2006 and March 2010. Ongoing settlement may thus be an explanation for the tops of the crest piles being below 1.58m AOD.\n\nFollowing the incident, the crest piling was reinstated along a 50m length at Haddiscoe. The levels were checked in June 2022 and the crest height was found to be around 1.8m AOD in the repair area."
