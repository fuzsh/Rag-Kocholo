        "text": "DescriptionHaddiscoe High Level Station.jpg\n\nEnglish: Haddiscoe High level railway station - the waiting room\n\nNothing remains of the station building but the station platforms > 1483143 and a waiting room > 1483155 - incorporated into a private garden - are still in place, as are the (converted) signal box > 1483245 and adjoining buildings. A railway station at Haddiscoe was first opened by the Norfolk Railway in 1847 at the Herringfleet Junction. In 1854 the Halesworth, Beccles and Haddiscoe Railway (later renamed the East Suffolk Railway Co.) was opened between those towns and extended via Darsham to Ipswich in 1859. The original Haddiscoe station was closed by the Great Eastern Railway in 1904 in favour of the current location at the junction of the Wherry Line > 1483031 - 1483039 and the now closed Yarmouth-Beccles Line from London to Yarmouth. Both stations operated until withdrawal of services on the Yarmouth line in 1959 which resulted in the closure of the Haddiscoe high level station. Until closure the two stations were linked - the link being controlled by the Haddiscoe Junction signal box. The East Suffolk line crossed the then Great Eastern line via a (since dismantled) bridge > 1483050 just south of Haddiscoe high level station, now a private property which was accessed by kind permission of the owner."
