Looking over an OS Map of the Norfolk Broads, I noticed that Berney Arms station falls between two 0m contour lines, ie, it is below sea level. Haddiscoe station is similar.

In that area, there are several other stations just beyond a 0m line, so they must be at just a couple of metres above sea level . Are there are any other - surface(!) - stations in the country below sea level?

The first place I looked was around the Duddon Estuary (Kirkby-in-Furness, Foxfield, Green Road) but these are all between 0 and 10m!

I think the town of Spalding is about 10m above sea level. Though one section of the line in that area was shown as below sea level when I was looking at the map during an ECML diversion a couple of years ago.

I've heard it said that Dundee station is below sea level, no idea if that's true.

Though not surface, Liverpool James Street is below sea level, not sure about the rest of the Merseyrail central stations. The Wirral line platforms will probably be below, if not the Northern line ones.

Mostly Glasgow-ish. Mostly.

I've read here (coincidentally or otherwise) that Dundee is the only heavy rail station in the UK below sea level, being positioned in a cutting that descends towards a tunnel that passes under the old docks.

Presumably not counting underground stations on Merseyrail and East London Line, which are also National Rail (London Underground and Glasgow Subway are technically heavy rail too).

Merseyrail will have a few in cuttings that aren't classed as underground so bypass your restrictions

Green Lane perhaps?

I can't see any 0m contours around Shippea Hill station on the OS map, but some of the online altitude calculators give it as being 1 metre below sea level.

Churn (closed)

With the current rate of sea level rise, how many will be under water in 30 years?
