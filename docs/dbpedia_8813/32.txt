Rather like Stromeferry (no ferry) as the road sign says, here is Haddiscoe Swing Bridge (no bridge) signal box in Norfolk. Haddiscoe had 2 stations, the High Level station (renamed from Herringfleet Junction in 1904), shown here in July 1969, had been closed 10 years previously when services on the Yarmouth line were withdrawn. The Low Level station, on the line from Norwich to Lowestoft, is just off to the right. A complex junction existed here when both lines were operational and, following closure of the high level Yarmouth route, the former signal box at Haddiscoe Junction became an exhibit in the Science Museum, Kensington. The box is now housed at Mangapps Railway Museum, Burnham-on-Crouch.
