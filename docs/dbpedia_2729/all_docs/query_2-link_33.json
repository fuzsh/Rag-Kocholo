        "text": "The paper provides an analysis of Dirk de Villiers’ South African film ‘Snake Dancer’ (1976), an exploitation/biopic featuring the notorious exotic dancer, Glenda Kemp. Kemp’s life of notoriety and cult stardom (and her subsequent turn to born-again Christianity) are linked to the chaotic production and distribution of the film. Ultimately, however, the film was a commercial failure, suggesting an interesing paradox: While local audiences (deprived of pornographic material under apartheid’s strict censorship laws) wanted the racier, uncut international version, overseas audiences were nonplussed by the amateurish production and comparatively tame nude dance scenes. The film provides an interesting historical glimpse of white South African thinking in the 1970s, and the paper argues that the fascination with Kemp arose not only because of her risqué nightclub act, but also because she persistently emphasised the extent to which racial and sexual politics remained intertwined during apartheid.\n\nThis issue’s theme is documentary in the digital age. A trilogy of articles develop a strong sub-theme, namely the treatment of women and the subaltern on the Indian subcontinent. Coupled with excellent writings on some contemporary documentaries are probing interviews with talented young filmmakers."
