It's very sad to see a director that gave us masterpieces like Time of the Gypsies and Underground and that was once considered a master of Cinema, fall so low, presenting Zavet as a film of his own. To those who know Kusturica's pre new-millennium work, is almost unbelievable that Zavet is directed by the same person. It looks like a Kusturica's fan film. Yes, the themes are similar to those of his earlier film(even if much more reactionary...) but all the genius is gone. The question that comes to mind is: is Kusturica on his right mind or has he (unfortunately...) gone nuts? Zavet has a preposterous script, bad taste humor and all the maniac energy, always present on a Kusturica film, is wasted on bullshit. It seems he tried to incorporate elements from Fellini, Jeunet and Tarkovsky's Andrey Rublyov but the result is null. Nothing makes any sense artistically. It's no wonder that, since 2007, Kusturica didn't direct another feature (his doc Maradona by Kusturica is also bad...). Zavet may be watchable for those less demanding but it's a complete waste of time to the serious film lover.
