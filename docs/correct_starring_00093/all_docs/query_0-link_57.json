        "text": "The third link in the chain is here and Jack’s actor choice for episode 3 is Charles Dance in the intelligently, Meta, action extravaganza, ‘Last Action Hero’.\n\nAs are the rules, this choice was connected via Dance who was featured in Carl’s movie choice from our last episode ‘Alien 3’.\n\nHe and Carl run through the flick in great depth along with Dance’s career and contribution to this criminally underrated 90s movie.\n\nAs always the lads also catch up with what else they've been watching recently, including: 'Messiah of Evil' & ‘Wicked Little Letters’. Not only that but the two butt heads on their divided opinion for Denis Villeneuve's 'Dune: Part Two'\n\nWhich actor and movie would you choose for episode 4? (Remember the rules, they HAVE to have been in 'Last Action Hero'!).\n\nIf your ears had a good time, please like, subscribe, share and follow our socials at @chainedpodcast\n\nAnd don't forget to check out⁠ ⁠Dark Matter Films⁠⁠ &⁠ ⁠Jacked In⁠⁠ while you're at it!"
