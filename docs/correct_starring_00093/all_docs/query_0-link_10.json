        "text": "“ Gentlemen. Since you are about to die anyway, I may as well tell you the entire plot! Think of villains, Jack. You want Dracula? Dra-cool-la? Hang on, I'll fetch him. Dracula? Huh. I can get King Kong! We'll have a nightmare with Freddy Krueger, have a surprise party for Adolf Hitler; Hannibal Lecter can do the catering, and then we'll have a christening for Rosemary's Baby! All I have to do is snap my fingers and they'll be here. They're lining up to get here, and do you know why, Jack? Should I tell you why? Hmm? Because here, in this world, the bad guys can win! „ ~ Benedict's speech.\n\nMr. Benedict is the main antagonist of the 1993 action-comedy film Last Action Hero and the secondary antagonist of the in-universe movie Jack Slater IV.\n\nHe was portrayed by Charles Dance, who also played David Carlton in Ali G Indahouse, Tywin Lannister in Game of Thrones , the Master Vampire in Dracula Untold, Emhyr var Emreis in the Witcher video game series, and Alan Jonah in Godzilla: King of the Monsters.\n\nBiography[]\n\nMr. Benedict starts out to be one of the villains in the film-within-a-film Jack Slater IV and tries to kill Arnold Schwarzenegger's character Jack Slater. Jack Slater IV is a film that the young moviegoer Danny Madigan goes to see at the cinema. Danny is then given a magic ticket that transports him inside the film, thus making it become real.\n\nMr. Benedict works for the mafia boss Tony Vivaldi and later comes to know about Jack Slater and Danny working together to stop him; after a face-off with the two, he manages to steal the magic ticket and travel from the movie world into our world, though not before having killed Vivaldi.\n\nJack and Danny run after him, and soon find out that Benedict has been watching and entering different films. He soon extracts an old enemy of Jack from Jack Slater 3, The Ripper, and gives him the direct order to kill actor Arnold Schwarzenegger so he cannot play Jack anymore. The Ripper fails when Jack arrives in time to stop Schwarzenegger's murder.\n\nLater, Benedict confronts Jack on a rooftop and announces his plan to bring an army of villains to our world, such as Dracula, King Kong, Freddy Krueger, Adolf Hitler, Hannibal Lecter, and even Rosemary's Baby. He then shoots Jack in the chest, but Danny disarms him. Benedict them pulls a knife and begins to wrestle with Jack, but with Danny's help Jack grabs Benedict's revolver and then kills Benedict by shooting him in his glass eye, detonating the explosive inside it and blowing him to smithereens.\n\nPersonality[]\n\n“ If God was a villain, he'd be me! „ ~ Mr. Benedict\n\nOn the film Jack Slater IV, Benedict was a suave and charismatic henchman hired by Tony Vivaldi and he also has one glass eye. He was cold-blooded, manipulative, greedy, obnoxious, ambitious, and cruel as the main villain of the film.\n\nBenedict also has high intelligence and advanced skills as an assassin, making him dangerously unpredictable.\n\nQuotes[]\n\n“ I understand you are interested in drug dealers. „ ~ Benedict to Jack\n\n“ I should tell you that I have killed people smarter and younger than you. „ ~ Benedict to Danny Madigan\n\n“ HELLO!? I've just shot somebody and I did it on purpose! „ ~ After shooting a pedestrian dead in New York, where no one cares\n\n“ Here Jack, the bad guys can win! „ ~ Benedict's last words to Slater moments before his death\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nMr. Benedict's appearance is that of a very elegant but cold-blooded killer who wears a glass eye with a different symbol on it every time he appears in a scene; for example, in some scenes, he is wearing an eye with a smiley face on it while other times, he wears one resembling a tiger's eye.\n\nBenedict's main sidearm is a custom .357 Dan Wesson revolver. It features a muzzle brake compensator on the end of the barrel to dissipate recoil and improve accuracy. It also has large, hand-hugging target grips, and adjustable target sights."
