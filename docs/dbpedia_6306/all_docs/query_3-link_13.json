        "text": "I agree with Bob. I thought that losing a blade may result in the quick loss of the engine. If that happens you are dead.\n\nPeople need to be cautious about being early adopters of new components. Just because your plane is experimental and you have wide latitude does not make it safe.\n\nNot always.\n\nThis is a picture of a good friend's Waco UPF-7 sitting in NY's Staten Island Ferry parking lot:\n\nThe prop lost 17\" off of one side. The NTSB took what remained of the prop for analysis. Their conclusion, the failure was due to intergranular corrosion, not a nick. In other words, there were no visible signs of an impending failure. In this case the prop was a certified all aluminum Curtis Reed fixed pitch prop.\n\nNote the weeds in the right landing gear, he bounced it off the berm in the background to make the parking lot and then swerved between the light poles missing everything. Eddie is one heck of a good pilot!\n\nHis only comment to me after the incident was, \"I felt s a small vibration, pulled the throttle back, looked up and realized the engine was gone, it happened that quickly. That Old Bird is a little draggy with the engine hanging down there like that.\"\n\nF-1 guys do..\n\nBefore I raced my Cassutt in 1974, the PRPA (Prof. race pilots assn) required a retaining cable from the top left motor mount over the rear cylinder and down, under the engine and back up between the other two cylinders and attached at the other top mount. It was a 3/8 cable with double nicopress sleeves on each end.\n\nOne racer, Jim Wilson was ferrying his Cassutt home from Indiana to Texas and slung half a blade off his metal race prop and managed to land safely with a dangling engine....saved his bacon from frying. They implored us to ferry only the wooden props.\n\nAnother old crop-duster I knew in the 70's had half a blade let go on his Stearman while he was in the field spraying cotton. The airplane did an immediate loop, or 90% of one and went in at a steep angle but he did survive to fly again. They found the missing piece and it had a rock strike some time ago on the rear of the blade and that's exactly where it separated.\n\nRegards,\n\n...even further off topic...\n\nIf you lose the engine off the aircraft, the CG shift is so extreme you're done - no maybes.\n\nRoberta is correct. There are instances where successful landings have been made minus an engine.\n\nI am aware of one that occurred in TX (I think) many years ago. Instructor and student in a C-172. Airplane was configured in slow flight with flaps down (probably contributed to successful landing because of the resulting nose down pitching moment) and the student had a hood on.\n\nThey had a midair with a tweety (T37) which took the engine off the front of the 172. The instructor directed the student to help him push hard on the yolk and he made a successful forced landing in a field. Only after they were down did the student remove the hood and see what had happened. I don't remember what the outcome was with the T37.\n\nMoral of the story...never give up...fly the airplane. (as the RV pilot did in this thread so I guess that makes it sort of on topic)\n\nI know at least two guys who threw a blade out of a GSC ground-adjustable after the wood sheared along the grain. Really dumb design.\n\nMy buddy Ron Collins was just about level at the end of a loop in an Avid Acrobat when he heard a loud bang and the nose of the cowl exploded. A forced landing in a field came shortly after. When he walked around to the front, he found the entire Rotax gearbox missing, propeller and all.\n\nWhen I arrived with the rescue trailer, he was convinced the gearbox had somehow seized or locked, tearing the box off the engine due to propeller inertia. The engine was hanging by one remaining unbroken mount tube. Both the carbs and the exhaust Y-manifold had been thrown off the engine. In the case of the exhaust, that meant it had shaken hard enough to break six 8mm screws. Given the evidence, I told him he had lost a blade.\n\nIt took two evenings of air-searching with my L-4, but Ron finally spotted the gearbox with one blade attached, in the edge of a treeline near where he thought he was at the time. The empty socket contained the epoxy cup and sheared wood fiber from the missing blade.\n\nLooked like this (photo from a different airplane. The feeler gauge says the clamping is correct per GSC.)\n\nHere's a sectioned GSC blade butt:\n\nPitch Control Systems\n\nMy, my, my! How the rumor mill flourishes! It has come to my attention that there have been a lot of rumors and half truths on this website concerning an incident I had with my aircraft on Friday, the 28th of March. We were up testing the performance on our propeller system when I detected a vibration and a loss of power. We were on a course for a left downwind to runway 17 at Aurora, OR airport. I felt that I didn?t have enough altitude to make the field safely and attempted an off field landing. The field I chose was extremely wet with standing water (does it rain in Western Oregon?) and we dug the left landing gear leg in. There were no injuries, only bent landing gear and injury to my pride. There was NO failure of the propeller or system, other than breaking a shaft when we hit the ground. We knocked the tip off of one blade. There were no separations of the blade from the hub. The FAA and NTSB have investigated and we suspect that we had a stuck or broken exhaust valve. When the ground dries out a little and we can get a vehicle to the aircraft, we will retrieve the aircraft tear down the engine. (I had the same thing happen to me several years ago in a Comanche with an 0-360, and it felt the same way.) Because it was a new prop, under the watchful eye of the FAA I did a tear down and found no evidence of any wear or malfunction. Again, there was no failure of the propeller or any of it?s supporting systems.\n\nWe have quite a bit of time on this propeller, and the results have far exceeded our expectation. We are dedicated to building a high performance and safe product. I know how the rumor mill works, and there are those out there that are competitors that would like to see us fail.

It has come to my attention that there have been a lot of rumors and half truths on this website concerning an incident I had with my aircraft on Friday..... Larry Morgan, Pitch Control Systems, 503-804-5508, [email protected].\n\nLarry,\n\nIn reviewing the thread, I find nothing like a rumor or half truth about you or your business.\n\nThe thread starts with a note about an accident report in the FAA database (reproduced in part below....that is you, right?).\n\nMost of the posts relate stories of propeller failures, none of which noted your product.\n\nPerhaps you're being a wee bit over-sensitive?\n\n__________________________________\n\nIDENTIFICATION\n\nRegis#: 65MK Make/Model: RV6 Description: RV-6\n\nDate: 03/28/2008 Time: 2251\n\nLOCATION\n\nCity: AURORA State: OR Country: US\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nPROPELLER FAILED INFLIGHT, AIRCRAFT MADE AN EMERGENCY LANDING IN A FIELD WITH APPROXIMATELY 1 FOOT OF STANDING WATER AND THE GEAR COLLAPSED, AURORA, OR\n\nPRELIMINARY Reports!\n\nMy NTSB data only goes up to 26 March for some reason. I suggest that the owner contact the FAA and/or NTSB to correct any possible errors.\n\nI read the preliminary reports almost daily, and one thing that is true about \"first stories\" is that they are almost always wrong in some aspect. This is a one sentence summary, usually a quote from a local sheriff or other nontechnical person.\n\nI for one am a bit embarrassed for VAF that people wanted to take Mr. Morgan to task for this. It was clear that folks wanted to make something of this incident when there wasn't any data - and then when he came on to set the record straight, he was challenged - what a great way to welcome an experimental aviator to our group. That's a good way for folks here to get a reputation that we don't want, and most don't deserve.\n\nDeveloping propellers is probably one of the most difficult and unforgiving things to do in this business. I expect some failures, and have respect for guys that are willing to do it.\n\nAnd folks - take those preliminary reports with a grain of salt - they frequently don't even get the type of aircraft right!\n\nJust my opinion...\n\nPaul\n\n<<I for one am a bit embarrassed for VAF that people wanted to take Mr. Morgan to task for this.>>\n\nNow wait a second Paul. Yep, FAA prelims are often wrong, but I don't think the thread originator had any intention of rumor-mongering by beginning a thread with a reference to one. He noted a report, nothing more.\n\nFurther, no subsequent post knocks Mr Morgan or his product. Most relate stories about prop failures, and just how darn quick they can get you killed. When the engine comes off the mounts, most of the time you die, and there are surely a lot of folks here who don't understand how a blade loss results in unbalanced forces measured in tons.\n\nMr Morgan accused the VAF community of rumor, half-truth, and under-handed competitor activity. I appreciate hearing his account, but the included accusations are untrue. I gently chided him.\n\n<<Developing propellers is probably one of the most difficult and unforgiving things to do in this business. I expect some failures, and have respect for guys that are willing to do it.>>\n\nAgreed.\n\nRisky props\n\nGlad to hear that it was a good outcome of this accident.\n\nPierre: You mentioned a retaing cable. Have thought about this earlier. Is it maybe something that is worth adding to our constructions? What is the risk of having a prop damage with vibrations ripping the enginge from its place? A cabel wont weight so much...\n\nThe F-1's back then ('70's) used cut down Sensenich props..both chord width and length. They were also re-pitched for the 235MPH + speeds and 4000+ RPM's the guys were/are turning their 100 HP Continentals. Each prop came with a chart and an area of RPM's to avoid at all costs, around 2900-3100 or so..(resonance, nodes, modes,etc)...and to transition through that range as quickly as possible. The guys were also told to ferry with a wooden prop but some guys wouldn't do it because they were so much slower than the racing props and I'd guess that some guys were just hard-headed and blades were slung. That in itself is an instantly destructive vibration...one guy said that his instruments appeared to be 12 inches tall, it shook so bad for a few seconds.\n\nOur current props by Catto, Sensenich and most other commonly used ones are nowhere near the risk of losing a blade....especially when staying within the manufacturers RPM limits.....kinda like putting a ballistic recovery chute on a 6G RV...not necessary since there's so little risk involved.\n\nMy .2c,\n\nRegards,"
