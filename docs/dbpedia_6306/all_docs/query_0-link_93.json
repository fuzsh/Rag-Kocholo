        "meta_description": "Howdy all; \n  \nOk, I finally was able to get the performance numbers off a flying Kitfox-4-1200 with a 2180 Great Plains VW motor installed, itâs the one in St. Louis, currently listed on Barnstormers. \n  \nThe great thing about this plane is itâs a known quantity.  As VW aero engines can be anything from a 1600 cc 45HP engines to a 2300cc 100+ HP  monsters (with water cooled heads), this engine has been identified as a 76 HP Great Plains 2180 cc engine turning a Sterba 62x32 prop at 3000",

        "text": "Roger,\n\nI applaud you for exploring alternative engines for the Kitfox in the spirit of experimental aviation.\n\nThe Kitfox has undergone a metamorphosis with engine changes over the years. From the diminutive two-cylinder two-stroke to the Rotec radial. If no one had the courage to try a different engine, all Kitfox aircraft would have that wonderful ring-ding-ding two stroke exhaust note.\n\nMany engine combinations are flyingâ¦ some good, some not.\n\nYour inquiry into the VW engine is not without merit. On the positive side it is significantly lower in cost than a Rotax. It can be purchased completely assembled. You can get an off-the-shelf motor mount to fit the Kitfox. Parts are cheap and many are available at your local auto parts store.\n\nOn the negative side is additional weight and a slight reduction in available power for a reduced level of performance. However, the performance of a Kitfox is so sprightly; you might give up a little without putting the aircraft into the flying dog category.\n\nIf the cost difference between the Rotax and the VW is the make or break point on being able to afford the airplane, Iâd say go for the VW. Thatâs better than no airplane at all.\n\nFor example, there are Champs and Cubs flying with 65 hp engines and some versions flying with 180 HP. To be sure, the higher HP versions have great performance; but, that doesnât make the lower performers any less fun.\n\nSo it is with the Kitfox. I donât think any Model 1 or 2 owner will say his aircraft is worthless because it doesnât perform as well as a Model IV with a Rotax 100 hp. To the contraryâ¦ I only hear of how much fun they are having flying. If you decide to put in a VW it should be a great flying airplane and who cares if it isnât the superstar of performance. You can buy a lot of gas for the $10,000 saving in engine acquisition.\n\nI donât think reliability is an issue. The VW runs and lasts just fine. Itâs been flying in airplanes for over 50 years. When you look at most engine failures, youâll find they are usually fuel system related with few mechanical failures. I wouldnât hesitate to fly behind a VW from Great Planes.\n\nI first looked at the Kitfox in the early 80âs then 90âs and 00âs. When the Rotax 912 80hp first hit the scene, lots of naysayers touted it was too big and too heavy. How things have changed.\n\nOne factor has popped up of which you may not be aware. The Kitfox factory is phasing out the Model IV. It is currently special order only and it is not public how much longer they will produce the airframe. Unless you buy a used Model IV to do an engine swap, you are probably looking at a Super Sport for a new Kitfox.\n\nThat may change your engine specification window due to the heavier airframe. Certainly the days of 65 hp engines in a new Kitfox are over. And perhaps the days of 76 hp engines are over, too.\n\nThis should give you a lot to chew on.\n\nEnjoy your quest.\n\nJohn Pitkin\n\nGreenville, TX\n\nJohn;\n\nThank you for your well thought out remarks, it's nice to see others understand that without lower cost engine options for the Kitfox in these tough times, fewer Kitfoxs airframes will be sold and fewer people will get to enjoy this wonderful airframe.\n\nI am painfully aware that the Kitfox model 4 is being phased out, and I have told the Kitfox owners that I think it is a big mistake !!! They risk locking the company into producing an airframe that can only be powered by a an expensive European engine. What will happen to their airframe sales when that Rotax 912 engine starts selling for $39,000 ??? Donât laugh, it will a happen !!! It used to be a $9000 engine, then a $19,000 engine and I think we all know itâs going to be a $29,000 engine soon enough, with the state of the US dollar / Euro exchange.\n\n$39,000 Rotax 912 engines will become a reality; itâs just a matter of when !!!!\n\nThe Kitfox-4 is different; it CAN use cheaper American made alternate Engines like the VW. Yes, some of the new parts come from Brazil, but we arenât loosing that $$ exchange race. Most of the Aircraft VW parts are made in the good old USA, the crank, the Cam and other major parts.\n\nIf Kitfox wants to keep selling airframes, even in tougher times, they need to offer the Model -4 as it will remain the aircraft that can STILL be powered economically, with smaller engines like the VW and others.\n\nMy three cents worth.\n\nRoger\n\nHowdy all;\n\nThe question was \"Do you think it's possible to install an engine as so heavy, then a Rotax 100 HP on a kitfox 2 or not ?\"\n\nI had the Kitfox 2 with a 582, and I think that that is really the limit on weight and HP on his model (though some have used heavier engines) It just didn't have a lot of structure to support anything more than that in my opinion, and was very limed on the tail feathers Also, even with the lighter 582 it flew terrible. Slow with the old wing design, and the worse adverse yaw imaginable, in my opinion. Also, on the ground it was very tippy due to the narrow gear, but climbed good.\n\nI would not consider any Kitfox before the Model 3 anymore, and even the model 3 should have model 4 upgrades installed. But that is only my opinion, and is directed at the \"average\" pilot.\n\nThe model 3 can handle the VW, but upgrading the lift struts is recommended, (both main wing and tail struts) as well as the rudder peddles, landing gear and perhaps also raising the tail and increasing the elevator size.\n\nFinal note, a \"light weight\" VW engine variant is available, it uses aluminum cylinders and single magneto ignition with a Posa or Aerovee carb. Total install weight is something like 15 lbs less than typical VW installed weight.\n\nHope this helps\n\nRoger"
