        "text": "We are a group of 3 western Pennsylvanians who built and have been flying a ?homebuilt? version of the Mountain Goat.\n\nMany years ago, I enjoyed a ride with Bill Montagne and was so overwhelmed by the airplane and that flight that I bragged about it for months. We practically jumped off the runway and did a quick climb to altitude where he demonstrated a fast cruise, slow cruise, stalls, a very slow climbing turn (I remember seeing 23 on the ASI). The landing was incredibly steep and short. It was, by far, the most fun I?ve ever had in the sky. I returned home and proceeded to sell my partners on the\n\nplane.\n\nSeveral months later, we got lucky. Bill called and said he had a ?bare bones?, tacked fuselage and some wing parts he wanted to be rid of because he wanted to move. Shipping turned out to be a real problem and considerable damage ensued, but we had enough to build on. Several years later, after a lot of work and dollars, and a lot of phone calls to Livermore, Ca., we completed our ?homebuilt? Mountain Goat.\n\nWe?ve been flying it now for about 3 years and it is every bit the airplane we hoped for, even though we don?t have many of Bill?s special components. We do not use his induction system, special exhaust system he designed nor his landing gear. We used the Bearhawk LG which we like very much. Our goal was more focused on the STOL end of the speed envelope.\n\nOn an average day we can get off the runway in about 200 ft, climb like the veritable angel, and cruise at about 130 mph at 75% power. Landings with flaps produce very short rollouts. Stall speeds are 27 with full flaps, 38 with one notch, and 48 clean(half fuel and 2 people). Stalls are gentle and predictable in all configurations. Cruise is very comfortable. Our engine is a low compression Lyc 0-360(168hp) and our wood prop is a Sterba 76-60. Our empty weight is 1240 lbs w/80 lbs tail weight. His design is extremely unique and a barrel of fun to fly. With performance like we get, its hard to imagine how much better the performance\n\nwould be in one of his production models.\n\nThere is plenty of room in front and rear seats, and lots of room for many pounds of hunting, fishing and camping gear extending about 5 feet from the back of the rear seat.\n\nWe think Bill is an amazing fellow - he is honest, honorable and he has always been very kind and helpful to us - a very good friend.\n\nShelly and partners--Fred and Jeff\n\npics at http://shellenberger.net/goatworks/\n\nShelly,\n\nThanks for the report, and I can ditto the comments about Bill. I got to know him when he first built the original MG and have flown with him when he was \"green\" with it. Granted the plane has a lot of potential, but it is not a SC for many of the same reasons, neighter is my modified PA-12.\n\nThose of us that have the fortunate opportunity to fly most all kinds of Bush planes in \"real conditions\" and as well have modified, rebuilt, wrecked/survived and \"still fly\" are not easily swayed to another configuration of airplane that is \"like a cub\" only better?\n\nFrom my perspective, what Bob was and is attempting (and has done quite well) is to develop an aircraft that will carry a comparitive large load of \"family camp gear, along with 2 people\" and get you where you want to at a speed that will make flying there take less time then the average VW. AS well be an a/c that will open up the oportunities to the moderately competent TW pilot to that beyond the local tarmac.\n\nWhile I don't claim to be an engineer, or even have near the welding and construction talent that my friend Bill has, I do have a pretty good handle on what a cub will do, and what pilots that operate them are expecting of them in the the bush!\n\nThe NUMBER ONE (1) (uno) first priority to a Bush pilot is that he can work the plane, get it home and do it again, and not If, but when he bends it, that it can be repaired in the sticks, with common tools, flown home, and then repaired with out the need for exodic materials, skills, and or $$$. There is not much on a cub that can't be done by anyone with \"homespun roots\" I am not sure that can be said for the MG, BH, Rebel, Husky, or even the more exotic TC's?\n\n(just my opinion)\n\nTim"
