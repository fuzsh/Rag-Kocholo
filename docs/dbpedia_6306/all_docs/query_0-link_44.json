        "text": "I have a Classic 4 with a 52 hp 3:1 geared 503 Rotax. First had a 68 inch 3 blade GSC. Very smooth at all rpms, looked good and pretty respectable climb considering the low power engine. I had a prop strike that shattered all three blades but didn't kill the engine. I sent the engine in to a Rotax service center for tear down and inspection. Everything was still within new specs.\n\nWanting the best possible climb performance out of the low power engine I called warp and asked. Ther recommened and I bought a 72 inch 2 blade square tip Warp. Better climb than the GSC and cruse at 85 mph. Smooth at all rpms except a slight vibration at 3000 rpm and kind of ugly.\n\nI'm kinda leaning to the 3 blade 72\" Ivoprop Ground adjustable UL\n\nI was having a hard time getting IVO to tell me where the performance degradation would be if I went with the above rather than their recommended 2 blade medium. They never did tell me.\n\nMy mission: 1200' grass strips, sand bars farm fields etc... Not really going anywhere but around the neighborhood so a fast cruise is not necessarily required\n\nGreat Review! Thanks!\n\nI wish IVO recommended the 3 blade UL for my combo. Alas, they have the medium 2-blade set up for the 618/3-1...\n\nSo if I \"have\" to go with a 2 blade, I decided to run a few more tests. I sent Culver and Tennessee props an email with my specs to see what they come up with. Waiting their reply...\n\nI do like the \"old fashioned\" look of wood. I'll take a bit of a performance hit to have the \"look\"\n\nDeejayel - Just in case... I have an IVO Medium In Flight Adjustable for sale that will work on your 618. 6 hours total time. It has and can be configured with 2 or 3 blades. Also includes 2 blade spinner. I loved it and it performed really well in climb and cruise, but it was a little on the heavy end for the HKS as far as inertia. Your 618 should handle it fine though as IVO recommends. Easily saw about 1200 fpm climb with the HKS. May be beter with your high ratio gearbox. The in flight adjust makes for wonderful performance across the pitch range.\n\nOne more thing - I really wanted a 3 blade, but trust me. Once it's spinning you can't tell . And the in flight adjust is so nice. I really hate to not be able to use it.\n\nany prop will be decent\n\nIVO Med 72 \"\n\nIVO 3 blade 68\" - Make sure the tape is SS tape and not Alum like some have done......\n\nWARP 2 blade 70 to 72\" Both warp get Niickel LEAding Edge\n\nWARP 3 blade 68 \"\n\nGSC 2 or 3 blade -- Get urethane leading edge\n\nGSC in flight prop with WARP blades\n\nI find 618 a bit differnt toadjust than the 582\n\npower band is a bit higher and the exhasut valve do no open till I think 6000 to 6500 if I recall.\n\nWhat do you have for exhaust on it \"? Send a pic....... The 618 pipe is differnt than what they used on the 582 -- It is a sidemount muffler with a cut made in it and ree welded to fit. Works good and simple.\n\nThe y pipe is also shortened as well as the elbow -- you loose about 5 HP or so. This is one reason the 582s go 500 plus hours in Kitfox. Easily.\n\nFun while it lasted....\n\nSo I installed an Ed Sterba wood prop and got one of those little skull cap spinners. Nice classic touch. Well today the spinner departed the airplane and it was encouraged with a kick by my nice wood blade.... BANG and then rough running limping back to the airport. Blast.\n\nThe blade that was struck didn't splinter, but it did sustain some nice cracks. So it's a hangar wall ornament now..\n\nThe spinner was quite cheap. All it has was a PK screw into a tinnerman. I replaced that with an an bolt and nutplate. But the vibration and the slight off center of the spinner really must have put some torque on it.\n\nSo I'm back looking at other props again. I sure would like to find something on the shelf somewhere. I have been keeping my ear tuned to the reports on the IFA ivoprop. Seems like someone always has an issue at some time or another with the control.\n\nSo that leaves me thinking the Medium IVO ground adjust would be the simplest way to go? Looks like the spinner is very similar to the skullcap that took me out of commission today? If so, I'd sure like to avoid it. I do want a spinner....\n\nI swear I'm not saying this because I have one for sale, but I think the dependability issues with the IVO IFA is way overblown. Of all the cases that I am aware of, the malfunctions were on the \"light\" version which has a smaller motor and overall smaller setup. The medium version has a much better and stronger motor which in my experience and others I've talked with works wonderfully with little maintenance other than a brush change every once in a while."
