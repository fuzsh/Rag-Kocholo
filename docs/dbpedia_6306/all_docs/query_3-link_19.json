You and your significant other are lugging carry-ons, purses, and laptop cases, slugging them back to steerage, praying for a sliver of overhead space to avoid flying with your knees up in your chest. A flight attendant spots you and comes racing in for the rescue. You and your companion have been se- lected for an upgrade to first class. Mimosas, here we come! Yeah, those are not the aviation upgrades we are talking about today. No, these upgrades donât come with steamy towelettes and tons of legroom. The upgrade on the docket is a little more involved as we go about removing legacy components that have been in place for decadesâah, the stories they could tellâ and replacing them with repurposed avionics from a once hangar mate. Out with the old and in with the new! When last we left Corey, he had received the pull-off avionics parts from Ste- phenâs Saratoga and was prepping to install them in his 1966 Cessna 172H Sky- hawk. All set up in his T-hangar, it was time to get down to business. You heard\n\nme correctly, ladies and gentlemen. After months of planning and a can-do atti- tude, Corey got busy pulling apart his panel. Careful, Diligent Removal Disassembly is easier than it sounds though one does not simply go ripping and snatching on aircraft components. While it is true these are pull-off units, they do have value. Corey could pass them along to another, as Saratoga Stephen did for him, sell them as cores, or keep them as souvenirs. The first order of business was to map what was to be accomplished before laying wrenches on it. As the pieces come out, it is important to take time to tag them with relevant information. Part number, serial number, condition âARâ for as removed, the date, and N-number of the aircraft. This is helpful if you need to identify the item later, especially if Corey passes them on to someone else. Once removed and tagged, Corey placed them out of harmâs way and began the task of preparing the panel for installation. Installation Prep Step one for the installation is to inventory everything. Steve and the crew from\n\n4 Aircraft For Sale | May 2024\n\nBEFORE YOU MAKE AN OFFER, MAKE A CALL.\n\nDonât buy anything until you talk to us. Weâll tell you if you qualify to insure it and what it will cost. Call us (800) 353 9110 Avemco.com\n\nfor frayed, chafed, or broken wire. Check for visual discrepancies like cracks or corrosion. Use this time to get to know things behind the panelâyou are not here all that often. There is a fair amount of dust and debris that collects behind instrument panels. Give everything a thorough cleaning and use a high-powered light and inspection mirror to see those hard-to-reach places. Another good ex- ercise is to replace any loose or damaged hardware. Stripped screws, bro- ken lock plates, and cracked brackets are common occurrences. Again, use this time to correct any and all issues you find. As a mechanic, one cannot âunseeâ problems once they arise. Now that everything is prepped, we will move forward. What Comes Next Alright, sports fans, we have come to a stopping point. Yes, I know you want to keep going, but Corey is doing this after hours, and he has a family and a full- time gig to attend to. Trust me when I say you donât want to rush aircraft mainte- nance. Even so, it is important to make steady progress. Just like anything in life, your repetition creates your reputation. Donât rush or skip steps, and always stick to the maintenance plan. I asked Corey to share his next steps. Here are some maintenance actions that are forthcoming in the refurbishment: â¢ Install the new avionics panel. â¢ While I had the interior out, Corey pulled all the old fiberglass insulation and discarded it. He is planning on upgrading to a better and newer soundproof- ing insulation. While the airplane is down for maintenance in one area, you can always use that time to perform additional upgrades. â¢ Next, Corey will need to install GPS antennas and wire them up. We will fol- low this process with him as well. â¢ We removed the old automatic direction finding (ADF) system. After remov- ing the old antenna, we will have to patch the hole made from it. â¢ Lastly, we still need to remove the vacuum system. Thatâs it for now, folks. Stay tuned as we keep working on Coreyâs Cessna 172 project. Donât forget we are also tracking Stephen and his Saratoga. There is still so much to do. Take care and stay safe!

Follow him on X (Twitter) at @RScarCo.\n\nItâs important to accurately tag components as they are removed.\n\nOasis Aviation manufactured and delivered the wiring harness, and it looks fan- tastic. The team even created and provided a wiring diagram. This will assist Co- rey with the installation of his replacement equipment, and it will become part of the aircraft technical documents to be retained for future reference during main- tenance events. Once inspecting it, Corey loosely installed the new wiring har- ness. Also, the avionics trays are installed loosely. Once the harness is cleaned up, he will secure them in place. Next, itâs time to wire in the circuit breakers and fasten the routing. This is ac- complished with zip ties and a stand, making everything nice and tidy. This will ensure everything stays in place when the new components are installed. It takes more time on the front end but will pay dividends in the long run. Oftentimes, mechanics will race through removals and not take proper pictures or notes. This is a mistake. While in the area, go ahead and do an impromptu inspection. Look\n\nWith everything removed, itâs a good time to check behind the panel for anything that might need cleaning or repairs.\n\nNow that everything is prepared, the next step will be the installation of the new panel.\n\n6 Aircraft For Sale | May 2024\n\nTHE FASTEST AND EASIEST AIRCRAFT FINANCING\n\nwww.flyingfinance.com Backed by the brands that help 700,000+ pilots and aircraft owners buy smarter, fly safer, and unlock their love for aviation. flyingfinance.com 423.558.2122\n\nAFS_FLYING Finance Cub Ad.indd 1\n\n10/12/23 8:43 AM\n\n150,000 AVIATION PRODUCTS READY FOR TAKEOFF\n\nSame-day shipping on everything for every pilot and every plane, from student to ATP and renter to owner.

Whether itâs a single-day business trip allowing for dinner plans at home to stay intact, or the entire family loading up to visit friends in a neighboring stateâliving with your airplane unlocks opportunities. For most, living in a fly-in community requires a trade-off between the amenities expected from a master-planned development and those required by an operating airportâto satisfy everyoneâs needs in the householdâand thus it remains a dream. At its core, The Fields has been developed to solve this dilemma. Designed by pilots and keeping family, friends, and non-aviation residents in mind as a priority, The Fields marries the best of fly-in community living with world-class amenities everyone can enjoy. âWe wanted to design a development that has community at its core, allowing for pilots to enjoy the advantages aviation unlocks while focusing on the key aspects that make a new urbanist community attractive,â says Jon Ricketts, partner in The Fields. âThis concept is unique to aviation, as other developments donât cater to the non-aviation spouse or family. We wanted a community that our spouses would be proud to call home and invite their friends to visit.â In addition to the onsite amenities surrounding a 4,300-foot runway, The Fields is strategically located in southeastern Tennessee. The area features a long list of beautiful flying adventures nearby, close proximity to major metropolitan areas, and a tax-friendly state for residents. By pilots, for pilotsâThe Fields is the new standard for fly-in communities.\n\nFLYTHEFIELDS.COM\n\nFLYTHEFIELDS.COM/AMENITIES\n\nDISCOVER AT THE FIELDS\n\nDream Destination â¯ TABLE ROCK LAKE FLY-IN COMMUNITY â¯ NEAR BRANSON, MO\n\n157 Acre Tract with 7000â of Shoreline.
