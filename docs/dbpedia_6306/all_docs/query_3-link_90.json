        "text": "Harry Fenton is an A&P and has owned numerous airplanes over the years. He's been providing a lot of good advice on maintaining Continental engines to the Fly Baby mailing list. With his permission, I've begun archiving the information he's provided into this web page. If you have a question, you can email Harry directly. Note: This \"mailto\" link is deliberately messed up to prevent automated process from grabbing Harry's address and flooding him with spam. After you click the link, type in his first name in front of the \"@\" symbol. In other words, his address is: When you write Harry, do him a favor and give as much information about the airplane and engine as you can...total time, prop info, etc. Note that Harry will respond with a personal email.He cc's me on the messages, and I update this web page on occasion. Realize that your email exchange with him will probably end up on this page to help others, but I make every effort to delete personal information such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, and even aircraft types, in some cases. Please note that Harry answers questions from people with a wide range of engine-maintenance experience, from absolute tyros to A&Ps with Inspection Authorization. As such, Harry's advice sometimes covers some pretty complex procedures, procedures that tyros really shouldn't tackle. The instructions provided are informational and not necessarily the absolute step-by-step process to the do the job. It is assumed that the person conducting the maintenance meets the FAA requirements for training or field experience and is appropriately rated. To quote Harry, \"Should something go wrong, the responsibility of the \"smoking screwdriver\" is yours, not mine.\" Text in italics are quotes from other folks' emails...they aren't Harry's words. If you're looking for general information on engine options for Fly Babies, see the main page."
