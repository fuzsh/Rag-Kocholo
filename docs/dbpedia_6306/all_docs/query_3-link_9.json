        "text": "In the busy city of Concord, New Hampshire, United Therapeutics commenced construction on a hangar that introduced numerous groundbreaking features which set new standards in the industry. The new hangar measures at a total of 170 feet deep by 210 feet wide. The front of the hangar is equipped with two state-of-the-art Schweiss hydraulic doors with the smaller of the two doors measuring 50 feet wide by 27 feet tall. Unlike anything Schweiss has manufactured before, the larger of the two doors measures at a tremendous 120 feet wide and 27 feet tall. The face of the hydraulic doors are made up of Kalwall translucent panels offering a sleek and clean look. Due to the sheer size of this project, Silver Maple Construction opted to equip both Hydraulic doors with Schweiss' free standing headers, which carry the weights and reactions of the hydraulic doors. With a weight of 55,000 pounds, the hydraulic hangar doors are powered by a 15-horsepower motor and open quickly and conveniently.\n\nUnited Therapeutics initiated the advancement of 3D bioprinting, which resulted in the establishment of the Concord, New Hampshire hangar. The hangar is home to some of the most captivating aircrafts to be seen. The largest aircraft has a wingspan measuring an immaculate 100 feet long. The massive size of this aircraft led to what is now Schweiss Doors' largest hydraulic door that they have manufactured. Inside the aircraft hangar, you will find multiple models of aircraft ranging from small to large. With the combination of aircrafts inside, a large door and opening is a necessity, which Schweiss Doors was able to provide.\n\nFor the past 15 years, Silver Maple Construction has been operating out of the small town of New Haven, Vermont. With a workforce of over 90 employees, they undertake some of the most significant construction projects in the region. Evan Herron, a project manager at Silver Maple Construction, has been with the company for the past two years. During this time, Evan has been involved in overseeing remarkable builds in the area, including the build of United Therapeutic's very first net-zero wood truss airplane hangar. The construction of the hangar began in June and was wrapped up in February, taking a total of 9 months to construct the aircraft hangar. Unlike other hangars, this building's entire framework consists of glulam from Art Massif derived from black spruce trees, which have been finger-jointed together to form columns and trusses. Hangars worldwide are typically constructed using steel, contributing to the substantial carbon footprint of the planet. However, United Therapeutics has set a different precedent by constructing their hangar entirely from wood. This choice significantly reduces the carbon footprint associated with building such structures. Upon completing the installation of the hydraulic doors, Silver Maple expressed utmost satisfaction with the outcome. Evan commended the exceptional assistance provided by Schweiss, particularly highlighting Brent's exemplary support. Evan states, “Brent went above and beyond to ensure a seamless process, offering guidance throughout the installation.” The Hydraulic doors were installed smoothly using experienced installer David Fitzpatrick with Irishspan, from Arundel ME. Evan further states, “Schweiss shipped the hydraulic doors with no shipping delays or faulty parts. All parts arrived on time and in great condition.” With such a great experience, Evan continues to recommend Schweiss Doors and is currently working on another Schweiss Doors install.\n\n“Schweiss shipped the hydraulic doors with no shipping delays or faulty parts. All parts arrived on time and in great condition.”\n\nEvan Herron\n\n“I've been to the Schweiss Doors manufacturing site a couple of times now and have had a full tour of the facility, I met with the owners and sat down with them. I was also able to meet the sales guys - the guys that quote out the doors, and everybody is just great, which all leads to a nice way to do business.”\n\nDave Fitzpatrick\n\nDave Fitzpatrick, the owner of Irishspan Industries, is usually found working with pre-engineered steel buildings, which opened the niche market need for hangar door installation. Irishspan Industries was utilized on this project for their expertise with Schweiss Doors leading them to be the only choice to erect the 120-foot wide by 27 feet tall Schweiss hydraulic hangar doors. Dave states, “I absolutely recommend Schweiss Doors to others, they have wonderful doors. When working with Schweiss Doors, the communication is great. They offer an amazing amount of support when installing and servicing.” He further states, “I've installed many different types of doors, but Schweiss has by far the best quality and service. I've been to the Schweiss Doors manufacturing site a couple of times now and have had a full tour of the facility, I met with the owners and sat down with them. I was also able to meet the sales guys - the guys that quote out the doors, and everybody is just great, which all leads to a nice way to do business.” David greatly appreciates Schweiss Doors and enthusiastically recommends them to everyone based on his excellent experiences with Schweiss Doors.\n\nHistory of United Therapeutics\n\nIn 1996, Martine Rothblatt founded United Therapeutics with the goal of improving healthcare by developing new and better treatments for people with serious illnesses.
