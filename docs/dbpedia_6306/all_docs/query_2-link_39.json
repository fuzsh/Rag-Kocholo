The props were long, slender  and flexible. When turning at speed (400 to 500 rpm), the straight blades bent slightly toward the trailing edges, assuming an S-shape.\n\nThis bending at speed put the leading edge of each blade under tension and the trailing edge under compression. This in turn caused the blade to buckle slightly, increasing the pitch  the angle at which it met the air. Consequently, the blade lost thrust at speed.\n\nTo prevent this, the Wright brothers decided to widen the blades, adding stock at the propeller's center of pressure where it was most important to keep the blade at the proper angle. The result was an elongated diamond or spade-shaped blade with squared ends. This worked, but only partly  the forces of tension and compression at the edges still caused the blade to change pitch.\n\nRather than strengthen the propeller yet again, the Wrights decided instead to design propellers that would balance the forces to retain the proper pitch. Experimenting with the spade-shaped blades, they added triangular pieces of wood (nicknamed \"little jokers\") to the trailing edges, changing the way the compressive and tensive forces were distributed. This did the trick  at speed, the prop remained at the proper pitch and produce the predicted thrust.\n\nNext, they carved props with the little jokers incorporated into the blades. The resulting set of propellers looked as if they were pre-bent. Later, when the Wrights began to make public demonstrations, observers described these as \"bent-end\" propellers and the name stuck.\n\nThe Wrights carved a set of bent-end propellers for the 1905 Flyer and found that they produced 210 pounds of thrust (compared to the 120-130 pounds produced by the 1903 props). Afterwards, they used these distinctive bent-end propellers on all their aircraft up until 1916. They were able to improved the efficiency of the props from 66% in 1903 to 78% in their commercial aircraft. By comparison, modern propellers convert 82-83% of their rotational energy to thrust.\n\nReferences:\n\nOrville Wright, deposition in Montgomery vs. the United States, 2 Feb 1921\n\nMcFarland, Marvin W.
