        "text": "Airline of the United States\n\nThis article is about the one specific US-based airline named \"American Airlines\". For its parent company, see American Airlines Group. For a full list of all US-based airlines, see List of airlines of the United States.\n\nAmerican Airlines is a major airline in the United States headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, within the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. It is the largest airline in the world when measured by scheduled passengers carried, revenue passenger mile. American, together with its regional partners and affiliates, operates an extensive international and domestic network with almost 6,800 flights per day to nearly 350 destinations in 48 countries.[8] American Airlines is a founding member of the Oneworld alliance. Regional service is operated by independent and subsidiary carriers under the brand name American Eagle.[9]\n\nAmerican Airlines and American Eagle operate out of 10 hubs, with Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) being its largest. The airline handles more than 200 million passengers annually with an average of more than 500,000 passengers daily. As of 2023 , the company employs 103,200 staff members.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: History of American Airlines\n\nAmerican Airlines was started in 1930 as a union of more than eighty small airlines.[10] The two organizations from which American Airlines originated were Robertson Aircraft Corporation and Colonial Air Transport. The former was first created in Missouri in 1921, with both being merged in 1929 into holding company The Aviation Corporation. This, in turn, was made in 1930 into an operating company and rebranded as American Airways. In 1934, when new laws and attrition of mail contracts forced many airlines to reorganize, the corporation redid its routes into a connected system and was renamed American Airlines. The airline fully developed its international business between 1970 and 2000. It purchased Trans World Airlines in 2001.[11]\n\nAmerican had a direct role in the development of the Douglas DC-3, which resulted from a marathon telephone call from American Airlines CEO C. R. Smith to Douglas Aircraft Company founder Donald Wills Douglas Sr., when Smith persuaded a reluctant Douglas to design a sleeper aircraft based on the DC-2 to replace American's Curtiss Condor II biplanes. (The existing DC-2's cabin was 66 inches (1.7 m) wide, too narrow for side-by-side berths.) Douglas agreed to go ahead with development only after Smith informed him of American's intention to purchase 20 aircraft. The prototype DST (Douglas Sleeper Transport) first flew on December 17, 1935, the 32nd anniversary of the Wright Brothers' flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. Its cabin was 92 in (2.3 m) wide, and a version with 21 seats instead of the 14–16 sleeping berths of the DST was given the designation DC-3. There was no prototype DC-3; the first DC-3 built followed seven DSTs off the production line and was delivered to American Airlines.[12] American Airlines inaugurated passenger service on June 26, 1936, with simultaneous flights from Newark, New Jersey, and Chicago, Illinois.[13]\n\nAmerican also had a direct role in the development of the DC-10, which resulted from a specification from American Airlines to manufacturers in 1966 to offer a widebody aircraft that was smaller than the Boeing 747, but capable of flying similar long-range routes from airports with shorter runways. McDonnell Douglas responded with the DC-10 trijet shortly after the two companies' merger.[14] On February 19, 1968, the president of American Airlines, George A. Spater, and James S. McDonnell of McDonnell Douglas announced American's intention to acquire the DC-10. American Airlines ordered 25 DC-10s in its first order.[15][16] The DC-10 made its first flight on August 29, 1970,[17] and received its type certificate from the FAA on July 29, 1971.[18] On August 5, 1971, the DC-10 entered commercial service with American Airlines on a round trip flight between Los Angeles and Chicago.[19]\n\nIn 2011, due to a downturn in the airline industry, American Airlines' parent company, the AMR Corporation, filed for bankruptcy protection. In 2013, American Airlines merged with US Airways but kept the American Airlines name, as it was the better-recognized brand internationally; the combination of the two airlines resulted in the creation of the largest airline in the United States, and ultimately the world.[20]\n\nIn December 2023, the company was added to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index.[21]\n\nDestinations and hubs\n\n[edit]\n\nDestinations\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of August 2024 , American Airlines flies (or has flown) to the following destinations:\n\nCountry or Territory City Airport Notes Refs American Samoa Pago Pago Pago Pago International Airport Terminated Antigua and Barbuda St. John's V.

It is available on all of the mainline fleet and American Eagle aircraft.[117] Main Cabin Extra seats include greater pitch than is available in main cabin, along with free alcoholic beverages and boarding one group ahead of main cabin.[120] American retained Main Cabin Extra when the new Premium Economy product entered service in late 2016.[119]\n\nMain Cabin\n\nMain Cabin (economy class) is American's economy product and is found on all mainline and regional aircraft in its fleet. Seats range from 17–18.5 inches (43–47 cm) in width and have 30–32 inches (76–81 cm) of pitch. American markets a number of rows within the main cabin immediately behind Main Cabin Extra as \"Main Cabin Preferred\", which require an extra charge to select for those without status.[117]\n\nAmerican Airlines marketed increased legroom in economy class as \"More Room Throughout Coach\", also referred to as \"MRTC\", starting in February 2000. Two rows of economy class seats were removed on domestic narrowbody aircraft, resulting in more than half of all standard economy seats having a pitch of 34 inches (86 cm) or more.[121] Amid financial losses, this scheme was discontinued in 2004.[122]\n\nOn many routes, American also offers Basic Economy, the airline's lowest main cabin fare. Basic Economy consists of a Main Cabin ticket with numerous restrictions including waiting until check-in for a seat assignment, no upgrades or refunds, and boarding in the last group.[123] Originally Basic Economy passengers could only carry a personal item, but American later revised their Basic Economy policies to allow for a carry-on bag.[124]\n\nIn May 2017, American announced it would be adding more seats to some of its Boeing 737 MAX 8 jets and reducing overall legroom in the basic economy class. The last three rows were to lose 2 inches (5.1 cm), going from the current 31 to 29 inches (79 to 74 cm). The remainder of the main cabin was to have 30 inches (76 cm) of legroom. This \"Project Oasis\" seating configuration has since been expanded to all 737 MAX 8s as well as standard Boeing 737-800 and non-transcontinental Airbus A321 jets. New Airbus A321neo jets have been delivered with the same configuration. This configuration has been considered unpopular with passengers, especially American's frequent flyers, as the new seats have less padding, less legroom, and no seatback entertainment.[125][126]\n\nReward programs\n\n[edit]\n\nAAdvantage\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: AAdvantage\n\nAAdvantage is the frequent flyer program for American Airlines. It was launched on May 1, 1981, and it remains the largest frequent flyer program with over 115 million members as of 2021.[127] Miles accumulated in the program allow members to redeem tickets, upgrade service class, or obtain free or discounted car rentals, hotel stays, merchandise, or other products and services through partners. The most active members, based on the accumulation of Loyalty Points with American Airlines, are designated AAdvantage Gold, AAdvantage Platinum, AAdvantage Platinum Pro, and AAdvantage Executive Platinum elite members, with privileges such as separate check-in, priority upgrade, and standby processing, or free upgrades. AAdvantage status correspond with Oneworld status levels allowing elites to receive reciprocal benefits from American's Oneworld partner airlines.[128][better source needed]\n\nAAdvantage co-branded credit cards are also available and offer other benefits. The cards are issued by CitiCards, a subsidiary of Citigroup, Barclaycard, and Bilt card in the United States,[129] by several banks including Butterfield Bank and Scotiabank in the Caribbean,[130][131] and by Banco Santander in Brazil.[132]\n\nAAdvantage allows one-way redemption, starting at 7,500 miles.[133]\n\nAdmirals Club\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Admirals Club was conceived by AA president C.R. Smith as a marketing promotion shortly after he was made an honorary Texas Ranger. Inspired by the Kentucky colonels and other honorary title designations, Smith decided to make particularly valued passengers \"admirals\" of the \"Flagship fleet\" (AA called its aircraft \"Flagships\" at the time).[134][better source needed] The list of admirals included many celebrities, politicians, and other VIPs, as well as more \"ordinary\" customers who had been particularly loyal to the airline.[citation needed]\n\nThere was no physical Admirals Club until shortly after the opening of LaGuardia Airport. During the airport's construction, New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia had an upper-level lounge set aside for press conferences and business meetings. At one such press conference, he noted that the entire terminal was being offered for lease to airline tenants; after a reporter asked whether the lounge would be leased as well, LaGuardia replied that it would, and a vice president of AA immediately offered to lease the premises. The airline then procured a liquor license and began operating the lounge as the \"Admirals Club\" in 1939.[135]\n\nThe second Admirals Club opened at Washington National Airport. Because it was illegal to sell alcohol in Virginia at the time, the club contained refrigerators for the use of its members, so they could store their liquor at the airport.[136] For many years, membership in the Admirals Club (and most other airline lounges) was by the airline's invitation. After a passenger sued for discrimination,[137] the club switched to a paid membership program in 1974.[138][139]\n\nFlagship Lounge\n\n[edit]\n\nThough affiliated with the Admirals Club and staffed by many of the same employees, the Flagship Lounge is a separate lounge specifically designed for customers flying in first class and business class on international flights and transcontinental domestic flights.[140]\n\nCorporate affairs\n\n[edit]\n\nBusiness trends\n\n[edit]\n\nThe key trends for American Airlines are (as of the financial year ending 31 December):\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net income (US$ million)[a] 7,610 2,676 1,919 1,412 1,686 −8,885 −1,993 127 822 Number of employees (FTE, thousands)[b] 98.9 101 103 102 104 78.3 96.8 102 103 Passenger enplanements (millions)[a] 201 198 194 203 215 95.3 165 199 210 Load factor (%)[a] 83.0 81.7 81.9 82.0 84.6 64.1 75.3 82.9 83.5 Fleet size[b] 946 930 948 956 942 855 865 925 965 References [141] [142] [143] [144] [145] [146] [147] [148] [149]\n\nOwnership and structure\n\n[edit]\n\nAmerican Airlines, Inc., is publicly traded through its parent company, American Airlines Group Inc., under NASDAQ: AAL Nasdaq: AAL, with a market capitalization of about $12 billion as of 2019, and is included in the S&P 500 index.[46]\n\nAmerican Eagle is a network of six regional carriers that operate under a codeshare and service agreement with American, operating flights to destinations in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean, and Mexico. Three of these carriers are independent and three are subsidiaries of American Airlines Group: Envoy Air Inc., Piedmont Airlines, Inc., and PSA Airlines Inc.[46]\n\nHeadquarters\n\n[edit]\n\nAmerican Airlines is headquartered across several buildings in Fort Worth, Texas that it calls the \"Robert L. Crandall Campus\" in honor of former president and CEO Robert Crandall. The 1,700,000-square-foot (160,000 m2) square-foot, five-building office complex called was designed by Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects.[150] The campus is located on 300 acres, adjacent to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, American's fortress hub.[151]\n\nBefore it was headquartered in Texas, American Airlines was headquartered at 633 Third Avenue in the Murray Hill area of Midtown Manhattan, New York City.[152][153] In 1979, American moved its headquarters to a site at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, which affected up to 1,300 jobs. Mayor of New York City Ed Koch described the move as a \"betrayal\" of New York City.[154] American moved to two leased office buildings in Grand Prairie, Texas.[155] On January 17, 1983, the airline finished moving into a $150 million ($459,000,000 when adjusted for inflation), 550,000-square-foot (51,000 m2) facility in Fort Worth; $147 million (about $450,000,000 when adjusted for inflation) in Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport bonds financed the headquarters. The airline began leasing the facility from the airport, which owns the facility.[155] Following the merger of US Airways and American Airlines, the new company consolidated its corporate headquarters in Fort Worth, abandoning the US Airways headquarters in Phoenix, AZ.\n\nAs of 2015, American Airlines is the corporation with the largest presence in Fort Worth.[156]\n\nIn 2015, American announced that it would build a new headquarters in Fort Worth. Groundbreaking began in the spring of 2016 and occupancy completed in September 2019.[157] The airline plans to house 5,000 new workers in the building.[156]\n\nIt will be located on a 41-acre (17 ha) property adjacent to the airline's flight academy and conference and training center, west of Texas State Highway 360, 2 miles (3.2 km)[157] west from the current headquarters. The airline will lease a total of 300 acres (120 ha) from Dallas–Fort Worth International Airport and this area will include the headquarters.[156] Construction of the new headquarters began after the demolition of the Sabre facility, previously on the site.[157]\n\nThe airline considered developing a new headquarters in Irving, Texas, on the old Texas Stadium site, before deciding to keep the headquarters in Fort Worth.[156]\n\nCorporate identity\n\n[edit]\n\nLogo\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1931, Goodrich Murphy, an American employee, designed the AA logo as an entry in a logo contest. The eagle in the logo was copied from a Scottish hotel brochure.[158] The logo was redesigned by Massimo Vignelli in 1967.[159][160] Thirty years later, in 1997, American Airlines was able to make its logo Internet-compatible by buying the domain AA.com. AA is also American's two-letter IATA airline designator.[161]\n\nOn January 17, 2013, American launched a new rebranding and marketing campaign with FutureBrand dubbed, \"A New American\". This included a new logo, which includes elements of the 1967 logo.[162]\n\nAmerican Airlines faced difficulty obtaining copyright registration for their 2013 logo. On June 3, 2016, American Airlines sought to register it with the United States Copyright Office,[163] but in October of that year, the Copyright Office ruled that the logo was ineligible for copyright protection, as it did not pass the threshold of originality, and was thus in the public domain.[163] American requested that the Copyright Office reconsider, but on January 8, 2018, the Copyright Office affirmed its initial determination.[163][164] After American Airlines submitted additional materials, the Copyright Office reversed its decision on December 7, 2018, and ruled that the logo contained enough creativity to merit copyright protection.[165]\n\nAircraft livery\n\n[edit]\n\nAmerican's early liveries varied widely, but a common livery was adopted in the 1930s, featuring an eagle painted on the fuselage.[166] The eagle became a symbol of the company and inspired the name of American Eagle Airlines. Propeller aircraft featured an international orange lightning bolt running down the length of the fuselage, which was replaced by a simpler orange stripe with the introduction of jets.[167]\n\nIn the late 1960s, American commissioned designer Massimo Vignelli to develop a new livery. The original design called for a red, white, and blue stripe on the fuselage, and a simple \"AA\" logo, without an eagle, on the tail; instead, Vignelli created a highly stylized eagle, which remained the company's logo until January 16, 2013.[168]\n\nOn January 17, 2013, American unveiled a new livery.[169] Before then, American had been the only major U.S. airline to leave most of its aircraft surfaces unpainted. This was because C. R. Smith would not say he liked painted aircraft and refused to use any liveries that involved painting the entire plane. Robert \"Bob\" Crandall later justified the distinctive natural metal finish by noting that less paint reduced the aircraft's weight, thus saving on fuel costs.[170]\n\nIn January 2013, American launched a new rebranding and marketing campaign dubbed, \"The New American\". In addition to a new logo, American Airlines introduced a new livery for its fleet. The airline calls the new livery and branding \"a clean and modern update\".[171] The current design features an abstract American flag on the tail, along with a silver-painted fuselage, as a throw-back to the old livery. The new design was painted by Leading Edge Aviation Services in California.[172] Doug Parker, the incoming CEO, indicated that the new livery could be short-lived, stating that \"[the] only reason this is an issue now is that they just did it right in the middle [of the merger], which kind of makes it confusing, so that gives us an opportunity, actually, to decide if we are going to do something different because we have so many airplanes to paint\".[173] The current logo and livery have had mixed criticism, with Design Shack editor Joshua Johnson writing that they \"boldly and proudly communicate the concepts of American pride and freedom wrapped into a shape that instantly makes you think about an airplane\",[174] and AskThePilot.com author Patrick Smith describing the logo as 'a linoleum knife poking through a shower curtain'.[175] Later in January 2013, Bloomberg asked the designer of the 1968 American Airlines logo (Massimo Vignelli) on his opinion over the rebranding.[176]\n\nIn the end, American let their employees decide the new livery's fate. On an internal website for employees, American posted two options, one the new livery and one a modified version of the old livery. All of the American Airlines Group employees (including US Airways and other affiliates) were able to vote.[177] American ultimately decided to keep the new look. Parker announced that American would keep a US Airways and America West heritage aircraft in the fleet, with plans to add a heritage TWA aircraft and a heritage American plane with the old livery.[178] As of September 2019, American has heritage aircraft for Piedmont, PSA, America West, US Airways, Reno Air, TWA, and AirCal in their fleet.[179] They also have two AA branded heritage 737-800 aircraft, an AstroJet N905NN,[180] and the polished aluminum livery used from 1967 to 2013, N921NN.[181]\n\nCustomer Service\n\n[edit]\n\nAmerican, both before and after the merger with US Airways, has consistently performed poorly in rankings. The Wall Street Journal's annual airline rankings have ranked American as the worst or second-worst U.S. carrier for ten of the past twelve years, and in the bottom three of U.S. Airlines for at least the past twelve years. The airline has persistently performed poorly in the areas of losing checked luggage and bumping passengers due to oversold flights.[182]\n\nWorker relations\n\n[edit]\n\nThe main representatives of key groups of employees are:\n\nThe Allied Pilots Association is an in-house union which represents the nearly 15,000 American Airlines pilots; it was created in 1963 after the pilots left the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA).[183] However the majority of American Eagle pilots are ALPA members.[184]\n\nThe Association of Professional Flight Attendants represents American Airlines flight attendants, including former USAirways flight attendants.[185]\n\nFlight attendants at wholly owned regional carriers (Envoy, Piedmont, and PSA) are all represented by Association of Flight Attendants – Communications Workers of America (AFA-CWA). US Airways flight attendants were active members of AFA-CWA before the merger, and they are honorary lifetime members. AFA-CWA is the largest flight attendant union in the industry.[186]\n\nThe Transport Workers Union-International Association of Machinists alliance (TWU-IAM) represents the majority of American Airlines employed fleet service agents, mechanics, and other ground workers.[187]\n\nAmerican's customer service and gate employees belong to the Communications Workers of America/International Brotherhood of Teamsters Passenger Service Association.[188]\n\nPAFCA-AAL represents the nearly 550 FAA-certificated Aircraft Dispatchers and Operations Specialists at American Airlines. This specialized group, many of whom are licensed pilots, former Air Traffic Control personnel, and military airmen share equal responsibility with the Pilot-in-Command for the safe conduct of each the flight.[189]\n\nSubsidiary companies\n\n[edit]\n\nSky Chefs\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1942, American Airlines established Sky Chefs, a wholly-owned subsidiary, as a catering company to serve their fleet.[190] In 1986, Sky Chefs was sold to Toronto-based Onex Capital Corporation for $170 million.[190][191] Sky Chefs became a subsidiary of Onex Food Services Inc.[192][citation needed] Since 2001, it has been fully owned by the LSG Group.[193][194]\n\nFlagship Hotels / Americana Hotels\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the late-1960s, American Airlines established the Flagship Hotels chain as a subsidiary of Sky Chefs. On July 21, 1972, American Airlines leased four hotels from the Loews Corporation, three of them branded as Americana Hotels, for a period of thirty years. American merged the hotels with their Flagship Hotels, and rebranded the entire chain as Americana Hotels.[195] In 1980, American Airlines sold Americana Hotels to Bass Brothers Enterprises of Fort Worth, Texas.[196]\n\nConcerns and conflicts\n\n[edit]\n\nEnvironmental violations\n\n[edit]\n\nBetween October 1993 to July 1998, American Airlines was repeatedly cited for using high-sulfur fuel in motor vehicles at 10 major airports around the country, a violation of the Clean Air Act.[197]\n\nLifetime AAirpass\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: AAirpass\n\nSince 1981, as a means of creating revenue in a period of loss-making, American Airlines had offered a lifetime pass of unlimited travel, for the initial cost of $250,000.[198] This entitled the pass holder to fly anywhere in the world. Twenty-eight were sold. However, after some time, the airline realized they were making losses on the tickets, with the ticketholders costing them up to $1 million each. Ticketholders were booking large numbers of flights with some ticketholders flying interstate for lunch or flying to London multiple times a month. AA raised the cost of the lifetime pass to $3 million, and then finally stopped offering it in 2003. AA then used litigation to cancel two of the lifetime offers, saying the passes \"had been terminated due to fraudulent activity\".[199]\n\nCabin fume events\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1988, on American Airlines Flight 132's approach into Nashville, flight attendants notified the cockpit that there was smoke in the cabin. The flight crew in the cockpit ignored the warning, as on a prior flight, a fume event had occurred due to a problem with the auxiliary power unit. However, the smoke on Flight 132 was caused by improperly packaged hazardous materials. According to the NTSB inquiry, the cockpit crew persistently refused to acknowledge that there was a serious threat to the aircraft or the passengers, even after they were told that the floor was becoming soft and passengers had to be reseated. As a result, the aircraft was not evacuated immediately on landing, exposing the crew and passengers to the threat of smoke and fire longer than necessary.[200][201]\n\nOn April 11, 2007, toxic smoke and oil fumes leaked into the aircraft cabin as American Airlines Flight 843 taxied to the gate. A flight attendant who was present in the cabin subsequently filed a lawsuit against Boeing, stating that she was diagnosed with neurotoxic disorder due to her exposure to the fumes, which caused her to experience memory loss, tremors, and severe headaches. She settled with the company in 2011.[202]\n\nIn 2009, Mike Holland, deputy chairman for radiation and environmental issues at the Allied Pilots Association and an American Airlines pilot, said that the pilot union had started alerting pilots of the danger of contaminated bleed air, including contacting crew members that the union thinks were exposed to contamination based on maintenance records and pilot logs.[203]\n\nIn a January 2017 incident on American Airlines Flight 1896, seven flight attendants were hospitalized after a strange odor was detected in the cabin. The Airbus A330 involved subsequently underwent a \"thorough maintenance inspection\", having been involved in three fume events in three months.[204][205]\n\nIn August 2018, American Airlines flight attendants picketed in front of the Fort Worth company headquarters over a change in sick day policy, complaining that exposure to ill passengers, toxic uniforms, toxic cabin air, radiation exposure, and other issues were causing them to be sick.[206][207]\n\nIn January 2019, two pilots and three flight attendants on Flight 1897 from Philadelphia to Fort Lauderdale were hospitalized following complaints of a strange odor.[208][209]\n\nDiscrimination complaints\n\n[edit]\n\nOn October 24, 2017, the NAACP issued a travel advisory for American Airlines urging African Americans to \"exercise caution\" when traveling with the airline. The NAACP issued the advisory after four incidents. In one incident, a black woman was moved from first class to coach while her white traveling companion was allowed to remain in first class. In another incident, a black man was forced to give up his seats after being confronted by two unruly white passengers.[210] According to the NAACP, while they did receive complaints on other airlines, most of their complaints in the year before their advisory were on American Airlines.[211] In July 2018, the NAACP lifted their travel advisory saying that American has made improvements to mitigate discrimination and unsafe treatment of African Americans.[212]\n\nAccidents and incidents\n\n[edit]\n\nAmerican Airlines reported total CO2e emissions (direct and indirect) for the twelve months ending December 31, 2020, at 20,092 Kt (-21,347 /-51.5% y-o-y).[217] The company aims to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.[218] In November 2023, American Airlines purchased the first carbon credit contract (for 10,000 metric tons of CO2 sequestered at $100 per ton) from Graphyte, a carbon removal startup company invested in by Breakthrough Energy that compresses sawdust, tree bark, rice hulls, plant stalks, and other agricultural waste into biomass bricks wrapped in a polymer barrier to prevent decomposition that are stored underground.[219][220]\n\nAmerican Airline's annual total CO2e emissions - Location-based scope 1 + scope 2 (in kilotonnes) Dec 2016 Dec 2017 Dec 2018 Dec 2019 Dec 2020 39,254[221] 39,388[222] 40,604[223] 41,439[224] 20,092[217]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nAAirpass\n\nAir transportation in the United States\n\nList of airlines of the United States\n\nList of airports in the United States\n\nUS Airways, which merged with American Airlines in 2015\n\nNotes and references\n\n[edit]\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]"
