        "text": "The concept of human flight is virtually as old as humankind. Ever since man first walked the earth, he has dreamed of ascending above it.\n\nMike Schweiss, founder of Schweiss Doors in Hector, Minnesota, fulfilled a piece of those dreams with his first solo flight behind the controls of a Cessna 172 in 1991. Although he continued to fly after earning his license, he got sidetracked with an occupation that gave a distinct boost to the world of aviation.\n\nIt has been said that necessity is the mother of invention. Alfred North Whitehead took that one step beyond saying, “The greatest invention of the 19th Century was the invention of the method of invention.”\n\nKnowing that Mike was continually coming up with various mostly agricultural-related manufacturing projects such as farrowing crates and the well-known Chicken Plucker from his home farm site eight miles south of Hector, an acquaintance suggested one evening at a wedding dance that Mike should consider building a bifold door. Ironic as it may seem, that man died soon after on the dance floor that evening, but the lightbulb that glowed in Mike's mind kept burning bright. And so ideas churning within his ever-enlightened brain, the bifold door came to fruition followed a few years later by a one-piece hydraulic door and a line of bifold and hydraulic Designer Doors.\n\nAlong the way, Mike continued to make significant improvements on his design, notably among those was the advent of the patented liftstrap bifold door that soon outsold cable-lift doors. What started out as a two-man operation in what was once a milking parlor has now grown to a 250,000 square foot facility, covering 30 acres. The family-owned business now employs about 65 year-round jobs that deliver doors to every continent in the world to include China and Russia.\n\nIt soon became apparent that these types of doors could not only be used for agricultural, industrial and even residential uses, but would fill a very much needed product for aviation hangars; a much better option than cumbersome sliding doors that were especially difficult to open during winter months. These custom-made doors, offering no loss of headroom, leave the factory daily and are shipped worldwide in sizes big and small with the tallest hangar door on a rocket hangar at Cape Canaveral that spans 90 ft. wide by 60 ft. tall.\n\nMike took center stage April 20, during the 34th Annual 2024 Aviation Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony held at Mystic Lake Hotel and Casino in Prior Lake. He joined an illustrious group of six other highly regarded aviation personalities who in one way or another made a significant contribution to the progress and development of aviation in Minnesota and elsewhere.\n\nAlways a family man, in his acceptance speech, Mike took the stage with one of his beautiful granddaughters, Cora Mead.\n\nSix months after the bifold door idea was born, Mike started production of his first bifold door that ended up on a small county building.\n\n“The first year we sold one or two doors, but we just kept trying and trying, and now our doors go all over the world. I asked one of my installers one day if he would like to supervise an install. He asked where I was sending him to. I told him Dubai. When he asked where that was I told him it was on the other side of Minneapolis!\n\n“When we got going manufacturing doors, people would call and say ‘I've got a hangar, can you come and look at it?’ I got keen to it, and said if you fly here to the Hector airport, I won't charge you anything for my time. I got a lot of free plane rides and thought that was great - I was in a lot of different little planes. One day a guy called up and said he had some bad news . . . ‘The plane I was going to bring you is not going to work, I'll bring my Citation.’ I said no problem, you can land in Hutchinson or New Ulm. I told my brother, Dave, I'm going to forfeit this ride to you. So Dave got the first jet ride in the family.\n\n“It's been a good run and family operation with my grandchildren with us every day. I want to thank all my family, friends and customers and thank you for this high honor,” said Mike.\n\nThe 2024 Inductees\n\nPresent this night, along with Mike Schweiss, receiving recognition were the likes of Curtis Brown, Jr., a member of the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame who among many other accolades participated as a crewmember of six Space Shuttle missions.\n\nStevan Petrich, before his death in 2022, was well known as a North Central and Delta Airlines pilot. But he was drawn to floatplanes and discovered there was a need for equipment related to it. His catalog business was later purchased by Whipaire.\n\nCherise “Cheri” Rohlfing pursued a degree in aviation becoming a flight instructor, moving forward, flying corporate jets prior to flying for Northwest Airlines. One of her most noted achievements was with Delta Airlines in creation of WING, an acronym of “Women Inspiring our Next Generation”, Flight which is designed to inspire female high school students to explore careers in aviation.\n\nThe wife of William “Pat” Magie III was present to accept the award on his behalf. Pat had died in 2022. He used his GI Bill to take flying lessons in 1952 and along with his love of seaplanes opened Wilderness Wings Airways in Ely. He went on to instruct hundreds of young pilots who went on to making a career in aviation. Over the years, he owned 488 aircraft and had logged over 40,000 hours of flight time.\n\nJonathan “Max” Haynes, who died in 2022, made a name for himself as a skilled air-to-air photographer and artist. He photographed numerous annual Hero Flights and documented the creation of the Red Tail Squadron and Women's Air Force Service Pilots (WASP) community and its “Rise Above” traveling exhibit. He took part in the creation of 16 books to inspire young people to become authors and illustrators.\n\nRounding off this list of inductees was Paul Dye. Born in Bemidji, he began flying as a teenager and went on to earn a degree in Aeronautic Engineering, specializing in aircraft design and flight testing. He went on to Houston to join the NASA Manned Spaceflight Program working on Shuttle Orbiter systems. He was a flight director for the first shuttle to rendezvous with the Soviet/Russian space station, MIR, in 1995.\n\nThe Hall of Fame is also proud to award annual scholarships to youth engaged in aviation studies or flight training. Five young individuals were present to receive these scholarships at the banquet."
