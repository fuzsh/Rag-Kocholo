The Company also designs proof of concept propellers for emerging applications. Hartzell Propeller plans to retain the WhirlWind brand and product offerings.\n\nJJ Frigge, president of Hartzell Propeller said, “The acquisition allows Hartzell to further expand WhirlWind’s rapid propeller development capabilities for the design, tooling and manufacturing of advanced carbon composite propellers.”\n\nHartzell will retain the services of Jim Rust, former President of WhirlWind Propellers. Rust’s technological expertise with rapid prototyping composite propeller systems further enhances Hartzell’s existing capabilities.\n\nRust added, “I am excited to be part of the Hartzell Propeller team and eager to see the WhirlWind brand continue to thrive under Hartzell’s leadership.”"
