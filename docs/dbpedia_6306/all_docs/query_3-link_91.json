        "text": "Wade Jones (N725WJ, #152) just reached the 50 hour milestone on the eve of his 79th birthday. Here's his post to the CX4 Yahoo group:\n\n\"Hello group, Today I reached the 50 hour mark on CX4 #152 .It has been a pleasure to step out my back door to my hanger 20 feet away, open up the hanger, pull out the CX4 and after a good preflight, hit the starter and fly about 1 hour each time.\"\n\n\"My strip is about 40 miles south of Galveston, Texas and 12 miles inland from the Gulf of Mexico. There are three other owners but I am almost the only one that flies. Tomorrow I will be 79 years old and the CX4 fits my needs very nicely. For the builders on this list my advice is to keep building, the finished product is very rewarding.\"\n\nEditor Note: Wade, you're an inspiration to us all! Thanks for the report and the best of wishes for your Birthday tomorrow!\n\nIn response to a couple of questions asked, Wade added the following the next day:\n\n\"Thanks for the kind replies about my 50 hr mark and my birthday. As to the questions asked by Kenneth:\n\nMy engine is 1915cc by Scott Casler and prop is a 54X40 from Ed Sterba.\n\nI change the oil at 25 hrs and set the valves - both as recommended by Scott.\n\nI use 100LL fuel.\n\nAt 2900 rpm I indicate 100 mph and have enough rpm left to indicate 125 at full power.\n\nThis is a tough little plane. I fly off a 2900' grass strip that gets pretty rough at times. I have landed so hard at times that I thought I may damaged the plane. I have found some of the 1/8\" rivets with the heads popped off on the vertical seam above the gear .I drilled them out and replaced with 5/32\" rivets. I did not bother Dave with this minor change. New builders may want to consider this upgrade if flying off rough strips (with Dave's approval}.\n\nThis is with bigger tires and no wheel pants installed.\n\nNot much else to add at this time -\n\nWade Jones\"\n\nStep back in time to August 2011 and AirVenture. Those wandering the rows of flight line parking took notice of the first CX4 to actually fly into Oshkosh. Tom Stallings bird (S/N 0200; N949DC) flew \"under everyone's radar\" from Garden City, Kansas and took the title of being the first CX4 to fly into an EAA AirVenture convention. At that time, a check of Tom's hourmeter revealed that he had flown 217 hours since his maiden flight in August 2009.\n\nFast forward to early 2012. Tom had been busy flying his bird but became increasingly interested in Dave's Tri-gear modification. Dave and Glen both mentioned that it would become a whole different airplane... Tom finally decided it was time to make the conversion and see for himself!\n\nAbout three months later, the hanger door went up, and 949DC was rolled out on it's new gear, and sporting new position lights and landing lights in the main wheel fairings as well.\n\nTom reports that the Tri-gear conversion by itself wouldn't have taken so long, but the light installations added to the total down-time. Following his initial flights, he said that Dave and Glen were right. It is a whole different airplane. Cross winds where he lives have been known to be a challenge, but the Tri-gear modification makes them easy to deal with. After he got over his crushed ego with his bird no longer being a tail dragger, he does admit it's more fun to fly now.\n\nEditor Note: Thanks for sharing your updates Tom. Your bird was looking great to begin with, but she's looking even better now. We're certain everyone will agree! Please keep us updated with pireps of your flight experiences with the new gear configuration.\n\nJon Ward (CX4 #222), Cornwall, UK sent this to Dave today:\n\n\"Just thought you might like a picture of my CX4 at the UK's biggest gathering of homebuilts last weekend. The little plane attracted a huge amount of interest, and has become a bit of a star! All the LAA senior engineering folk that have been bugging you had a really good look and declared the design a little cracker! I hope to make good progress this coming year. Best wishes, Jon\"\n\nEditor Note: The LAA (Light Aircraft Association) is the UKs principal representative body for amateur-built and vintage light aircraft. With history dating back to 1946, originally known as the Ultralight Aircraft Association and more latterly the Popular Flying Association, the LAA is proud to have His Royal Highness, Prince Michael of Kent as patron.\n\nThe LAA is a not-for-profit association, owned by it's members, providing airworthiness services under direct delegation from the UKs Civil Aviation Authority. They represent the aviation interests of over 8,000 pilots, amateur builders, vintage aircraft owners and enthusiast members, providing sector-leading consultation and lobbying on UK and European aviation regulatory matters. With over 2,500 operational aircraft, including 500 microlights and 100 autogyros, and another 1,700 aircraft under construction, they report their technical competence is second to none, worldwide.\n\nThere are 13 CX4 builders (plan holders) currently in the UK (England & Scotland). The LAA has cleared the building of CX4's and is monitoring their progress closely, but has not yet issued the type permit to fly. Here's a link to the their website: LAA Website\n\nReminder: Our friends in the UK need a constantly updated list of CX4 fleet flight hours. This has been requested because it has become necessary for eventual type certification by the LAA for them (the magic number is 2500 hours). We felt it was a good idea to add this info to the \"Complete & Flying\" page. So far, 20 builders/owners have responded.\n\nYour help is still needed. Of the 33 planes flying, 13 owners have not yet responded. If the MIA owners could email their planes current hours directly to us (using the link at the top of this page), we'll get them listed on the \"Completed & Flying page immediately. If you know the owners/builders, could you take a few minutes to contact them and ask them for their help with getting this info to us so our list can be 100% accurate? Thanks!\n\nCX5 Tri-Gear Prototype Update\n\nDave was asked on the Yahoo site how things are going with the CX5 development. He reported the following:\n\n\"Progress is moving now. We have the fuselage and controls ready except it is not on the gear yet, The tail is finished, the instrument are in and the radios are going in now. I have the engine but it is not installed. We are starting on the wings now. Work on the ribs-to-spar installation was done today.\n\nWith over 500 sets of plans out for the CX4, making parts for people keeps me real busy. This seems to be the big problem with getting time to work on the 5. I have a real nice gentlemen helping me now, and this has given me a real boost on the CX5.\n\nBest regards,\n\nDave\"\n\nEditor Note: We've asked Dave for a few photo's to share...\n\nA new vendor, Motorav, caught our attention at Sun n' Fun and Oshkosh last year, and was at Sun n' Fun again this year.\n\nRIMA Industrial S/A, Brasil, employees 5000+ people in its various Brazil operations, and is a global leader in the production of Silicon Metal, Ferro-alloys and Magnesium. Since 1981, Rima had been the exclusive supplier of magnesium used in engine cases to Volkswagen Brazil. In 1999, Rima purchased Volkswagens Brazilian foundry and began the direct manufacturing and distribution of Volkswagen engine cases in many global markets (1500 cases were sold in 2011 in the US market alone).\n\nVolkswagen never expressed an interest in developing a higher horsepower engine. RIMA was repeatedly contacted by several companies about such a development once it acquired VWs foundry. In 2006, Rima president Ricardo Vicintin, himself a pilot, launched a program within the company to begin R&D to redesign the engine for these higher horsepower aeronautical applications.\n\nFinite element analysis tests were conducted on the original cases by the Brazilian Institute of Aeronautical Technology (ITA). The stress tests confirmed the need to redesign the engine block (at the casting die level) to strengthen key areas, including increasing the size of the front crankshaft bearing area. In on-going dyno cell testing, these modifications have proven to be very effective.\n\nAfter six years of R&D and the feedback received during these efforts, Rima decided that they had a viable product to bring to the global experimental aircraft market, and began structuring a new division (MOTORAV Industria e Comercio Ltda) to support the effort.\n\nIt is clear to us that this company has made a commitment to this project which warrants further attention to its developments. We have created a Motorav Community website, similar to our efforts with this CX Community site, to keep the global LSA builder community informed of RIMA's Motorav activities and developments.\n\nOn a related note, a CX4 has been flying with a Motorav engine since last year. The 22nd CX4 flying (S/N 151) took its maiden flight in May of 2011. Owner/Builder partners José Morgon & Paulo Kessler have posted several video's on YouTube - Direct links can be found on the Motorav Community website. Paulo Kessler has also been flying a second plane fitted with a Motorav engine. His video's are linked on the Motorav Community website as well.\n\nWhat will the future hold? RIMA has several other projects currently undergoing R&D. Cylinder heads with more fins for increased cooling, IGNIFLEX electronic ignition, electronic fuel injection for increased fuel efficiency & reduced emissions and turbo charging for more power. This company is serious, and its people are focused and committed. We're keeping our eyes on this, and will keep you informed.\n\nEditor Note: RIMA has just launched a dedicated Motorav website (http://www.motorav.com), It is in an early development stage, but I'm certain it will be made current in short order. Keep an eye on it as well! Thanks!\n\nSylvain Bélanger, Montreal QC Canada, posted this on the Yahoo group site today:\n\nGentlemen,\n\n\"My bird left the ground today for its first flight. I wish I could have the pride to say it was me flying but I got an offer from a 10,000 hrs + experienced test pilot and 23 times builder... The Thatcher was also the134th type of plane he flew. I just could not say no! The 15 minutes flight was uneventful. The flight testing, trimming, adjusting will continue but soon with me as the pilot.\"\n\nSylvain added the next day:\n\n\"This morning was the moment for me. I just had my first 15 minutes flight. To be confirmed: more than 125 mph at 3000 rpm. Fast, slippery, pleasingly nervous and responding. At first sight, I did not feel the plane pulling on one side or the other (needs to be confirmed by more flying). Keep on building, it is worth it...\n\nI need to go now to do something to get rid of some adrenalin...\n\nEditor Note: Sylvain, the next time your bird heads for the sky, could you have someone take a few photo's and pass them along to us for posting? Thanks!\n\nSince the CX Community site was created, we've received many requests from builders and others to add products they have developed to the \"Plans, Parts & Engine\" webpage. We have resisted adding the wide variety of offered parts and kits because we have not had an opportunity to actually review the items offered, review the vendors offering them or inquire with Thatcher Aircraft, Inc. regarding their endorsement or approval.\n\nTechnology, and the popularity of this website, have evolved. Feedback on its value and content is received daily from around the world. With that in mind, the decision was made to create a new page where builders and others can announce their custom products to the entire CX community (http://www.cx4community.com/accessories.htm). A \"Accessories\" link has been added to the list at the top of every page.\n\nWe value all visitors to this site, and our constant goal is the integrity of all content this site contains. It is our opinion that the community will advise us if any listing on this page results in a negative experience with either the product or the vendor, ultimately resulting in our removal of the listing from the webpage.\n\nBoiler plate language aside, our first listing on the page was a result of an experience shared with us by a CX4 builder in Maine, USA. He contacted a gentleman in Michigan that has been making parts and kits for other model types for years. A turtle deck access door kit was developed that achieved all the builders needs, and through word-of-mouth advertising, has become very popular with others. In our humble opinion, sharing this type of information is what our community is all about.\n\nCheck out the new page and our first listing. If you'd like to see a product added, or have any comment on a current listing, use the email link at the top of the \"Accessories\" page to notify us.\n\nCX5 Tri-Gear Prototype Update\n\nFollowing the effort required to bring the CX4 Tri-gear modification to reality, Dave has resumed work once again on the CX5. He recently reported:\n\n\"The prototype I am making is a tri-gear with front seat solo. Peter Beck is working on the tail dragger. I have ordered the engine and have the canopy. The forward section of the fuselage is going together nicely back to the rear seat. I have the wheels, tires and brakes. The instrument panel has been cut.\"\n\n\"As soon as I get the instrument panel installed I can begin to fit the canopy, windshield and latch system. The flaperon control system has been worked out. The flaps will be electric. The plans are drawn, but until I make everything and fly it, there will be no announcement as to availability.\"\n\n\"I'll be 80 in January so do not get your hopes too high. I am having fun building it though.\"\n\nMay Gods Blessings rest on you all.\n\nDave Thatcher\n\nForward Section Mock-up\n\n(August 10, 2010)\n\nPrototype Forward/Center Section\n\n(March 26, 2011)\n\nCanopy Fitment\n\n(December 6, 2011)\n\nDave Thatcher has just announced that design and testing of the CX4 Tri-gear Modification has been completed, and that complete plans and a builder manual for the conversion are now available!\n\nThe Tri-gear plans and manual set can be ordered directly from Thatcher Aircraft, Inc. at a cost of $65.00 (USD). Standard shipping is included.\n\nAlthough the plans are complete to produce all of the required parts, many have requested that individual conversion parts be made available separately. Dave is currently coordinating production of the preformed strut and nose wheel fork, and will announce availability and pricing shortly. Complete conversion kits are also in the works and will be available soon.\n\nErnest Martin (Ardin, NC USA) has announced the availability of CX4 wheel fairings for the CX4. Main gear fairings and the new nose gear fairing can be ordered from him now at a cost of $80.00 (USD) per individual fairing. Contact Erni directly for additional information.\n\nDave has appreciated the strong interest in this project, and thanks everyone for their patience with his bringing this much anticipated CX4 option to market.\n\nSince the launch of the CX4 Community Website over two years ago, it has been regularly visited by people in over 60 countries. In an effort to make viewing the entire website easier for those that have a native language other than English, a new feature has been added to every page.\n\nJust underneath the header is a Google translation tool that will convert the entire page to one of 16 available languages. The automated translations may not be perfect, but they should make site and content navigation easier for those that use the tool.\n\nIf anyone would like additional languages added, or have any other comments, please email me directly at the link just above this list.\n\nDave Thatcher has set the LSA world on fire with the announcement of his new CX5 two-place design project. He has received many emails wondering how soon plans will become available.\n\nIn a brief summary from his latest post on the Yahoo site, Dave has reported that there is a great amount of work yet ahead for the CX5. Although most of the plans have been drawn and work on the front fuselage section has begun, proving out the plans is a long process and many changes are expected to crop up as the prototype construction continues.\n\nAs Peter Beck outlined in his recent EAA Experimenter article, Dave will \"release plans only after the prototype has been flown and completely flight-tested.\" At this point, it's not possible for Dave to provide a firm date when this will happen.\n\nStay tuned for further developments...\n\nThe best just keeps getting better! Dave just posted this announcement on the Yahoo group site:\n\nGentlemen:\n\nRequests from many of you who are building, or thinking about building the CX4 have been heard. Although I like the looks of tail wheel aircraft, the last large volume tail wheel aircraft of any kind was about 50 years ago. The cost of getting a tail wheel endorsement and the cost of insurance, and other factors have led me to offer the CX4 as a tri-gear or tail wheel. The CX5 will also be offered as a tri-gear as well as tail wheel.\n\nI appreciate and respect your advice and comments about this subject. I hear you. I'll get to work on this right now.\n\nDave Thatcher\n\nEditor Note: CX4 & CX5 Tri-gear illustrations have been added to this site. Click on the \"3-View Drawings\" link at the top of this page. Additional information will be added here as it becomes available."
