        "text": "<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<--->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\n<< Lancair Builders' Mail List >>\n\n<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<--->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\n>>\n\nIn a message dated 8/20/2001 7:09:17 PM Pacific Daylight Time,\n\nrbelshe [at] home.com writes:\n\n<< My engine is a IO320 with 9.5:1 pistons, dyno'ed at 196hp, by Lycon. >>\n\nBob:\n\nNice of you to take the time to publish those numbers. However, my response\n\nis based upon the belief that the common cause of greater knowledge will be\n\nbetter served by the dissemination of realistic data.\n\nFirst, your numbers don't specify a density altitude at which they were\n\nmeasured, nor do they indicate the methodology by which the speed numbers\n\nwere determined. Without the density altitude numbers, the power being\n\napplied to the prop can't be determined, even though you specified 2700 RPM.\n\nAre we to assume that all the speed measurements are TAS? If so, how were\n\nthey determined, and were they all determined at the same density altitude?\n\nIf not, what was the actual power being appied to the prop for each dataset?\n\nAnd is it just coincidence that all three of these fixed-pitch props just\n\nhappened to max out at 2700 RPM at full throttle at the density altitude you\n\nchose?\n\nThe other issue is: I'd like for anyone (including Ken Tunnell at LyCon) to\n\nexplain to the world how an IO-320, which on its BEST day, MIGHT have\n\nactually made 160 HP at 2700 RPM (with a special dyno exhaust system), can,\n\nby means of installing 9.5 pistons (regardless of any unmentioned changes to\n\nthe intake system, heads, cam, etc.) increase it's power output at 2700 RPM\n\nby 36 BHP. That's a 22.5% increase, and represents a BMEP of 180 psi, which\n\nis pretty close to the max BMEP from my very best angle-valve, injected, 11.0\n\ncr, trick-heads & induction system-IO-540's at 2700 RPM. (Maybe Visalia HP\n\nare different from standard SAE HP).\n\nI can promise you, from having modified lots of this stuff (and dynoed it on\n\nan honest, computer-controlled, calibrated Superflow 901 dyno) that, unless\n\nyour heads have been replaced with angle-valve heads and cylinders off an\n\nO-480, even with flow-improved ports and intake system, your 320 won't make\n\nmuch more than 180 HP (the same power-per-cubic inch as a 200 HP IO-360-A, C\n\nor D engine), and at 9.5 cr, it's pretty unlikely. Further, the the 9.5 cr\n\nsuggests strongly that the heads are the same old straight-valve heads as\n\nother 320's. (However, if I monkey with the dyno calibration, I could show\n\nyou 500 HP out of your 320 at 2700 RPM, if that's what you wanted to see!)\n\nIf you DO have the angle-valve heads, then with some SERIOUS mods (big cr,\n\nheat-barrier and friction coatings, radical accel-ramps on the cam lobes,\n\nhighly-modified ports, very-trick intake tubes and and very-trick plenum\n\nmods) you might see your 196 HP at 2700 RPM.\n\nJust for a reality check, assume you can actually achieve 100% volumetric\n\nefficiency on your engine at sea-level standard conditions (highly unlikely).\n\nAt 100% VE and 2700 RPM, your 320 pumps 250 CFM. Since\n\nHP = airflow (cfm) x 2.737 x thermal efficiency,\n\nthen the thermal efficiency needed to produce 196 HP is 28.6%. Now, in order\n\nto evaluate whether that is probable, consider that the BEST of the Winston\n\nCup engines achieve a thermal efficiency of about 29.4% at cr's in excess of\n\n12 and at crank speeds in excess of 7000 RPM. I don't believe for a second\n\nthat you'll ever get close to that kind of thermal efficiency out of an\n\nair-cooled engine at 2700 RPM.\n\nSorry to rain on your parade.\n\nBut if those airspeed numbers are TAS, then regardless of the advertised\n\nengine HP, you've got a pretty satisfying machine. Hope you can get another\n\nPerformance Prop .\n\nJack Kane\n\nEPI, Inc.\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nLML website: http://www.olsusa.com/mkaye/maillist.html\n\nLML Builders' Bookstore: http://www.buildersbooks.com/lancair\n\nPlease send your photos and drawings to marvkaye [at] olsusa.com.\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\n<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<--->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\n<< Lancair Builders' Mail List >>\n\n<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<--->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\n>>\n\nGosh Jack, I wasn't making any claims at all. Certainly did not intend\n\nto tread on the \"common cause of greater knowledge\". All I have is\n\npiece of paper from Lycon that says the HP at 2750 rpm, 29 inches, using\n\na Lycon exhaust, air inlet and test club, is 185.877 and when corrected\n\nto a 60 degree day is 196.107. The (new) parallel-valve cylinders were\n\nported and flow balanced and Lycon 9.5:1 pistons installed. It has a\n\nAirflow Performance fuel injection system. The engine runs like a top,\n\nand whether it is 175HP or 195HP, I am very pleased with it.\n\nAs for my data, here is what I said:\n\n> Data is from linear trend lines fitted to a large number of data points\n\n> taken on different days at different altitudes and temperatures.\n\nI made no attempt to determine the power being applied to the prop,\n\nrather am simply comparing the speed achieved with different props\n\nin the range of RPMs where I normally operate.\n\nWhat I did is put a bunch of raw data points (IAS, RPM, Altitude) into a\n\nspreadsheet, calculate TAS, and make a graph. Then I looked at the trend\n\nline (that's what Excel calls it, I would say its a least squares\n\nstraight line fit) and read the TAS shown on the graph at 2700 rpm. I\n\nnever said all 3 props max out at 2700, in fact they will all go\n\nfaster, I don't know how much because I don't intentionally\n\nrun the engine above 2700.\n\nI calculated TAS from a simple formula which uses ONLY IAS and altitude\n\nand is at best good to a few percent. This is not \"lab quality\" data,\n\nbut I think it does average out the errors and makes a valid comparison\n\nbetween different propellers on a real Lancair, under real flight\n\nconditions.\n\nI hope others will contribute to this thread. Judging from the speed\n\nnumbers, the Performance prop was a better match to my airplane.\n\nThe Felix prop has more pull at low RPM, (I have to relly mash the\n\nbrakes during runup) and it feels smoother.\n\nThe Warnke 2 blade has too little ground clearance for the 235, but it\n\nclimbed better than either of the other two. I decided to try the\n\nFelix prop because the price/delivery time was better.\n\nBob Belshe\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nLML website: http://www.olsusa.com/mkaye/maillist.html\n\nLML Builders' Bookstore: http://www.buildersbooks.com/lancair\n\nPlease send your photos and drawings to marvkaye [at] olsusa.com.\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>"
