        "text": "Nidec Aerospace LLC to Provide Electric Propulsion System; BAE Systems to Provide Energy Storage System; DUC Hélice Propellers to Provide Rotors and Propellers\n\nPARIS - June 18, 2023 — Eve Air Mobility (“Eve”) (NYSE: EVEX, EVEXW) today named the first three suppliers for its electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. Nidec Aerospace LLC, a joint venture between Nidec Corporation and Embraer, will provide the electric propulsion system, BAE Systems will provide an advanced energy storage system and DUC Hélice Propellers will supply the rotors and propellers for the eVTOL.\n\n“The announcement of the first suppliers is a key milestone in the development of our eVTOL aircraft,” said Andre Stein, co-CEO of Eve Air Mobility. “As we advance toward entry into service, our goal is to make sure that we produce and deliver a mature aircraft that not only exceeds expectations but enables our customers to operate safely and efficiently with the lowest cost of operation.”\n\nNidec Aerospace LLC, a joint venture between Japan’s Nidec Corporation (TSE: 6594; OTC US: NJDCY) and Brazil’s Embraer (B3: EMBR3, NYSE: ERJ), will develop the electric propulsion system for Eve’s eVTOL. Nidec Corporation, the world's leading comprehensive motor manufacturer, will be backed by Embraer’s more than 50-year history of aerospace experience to design, certify, produce, and commercialize next-generation electric propulsion systems based on well-proven technologies.\n\n“We are excited to have Eve as our launch customer for Nidec Aerospace’s new electric propulsion system,” said Michael Briggs, senior vice president and president of the Motion & Energy Business Unit at Nidec. “With our cutting-edge technologies, Nidec Aerospace and Eve together are well-positioned to drive and accelerate advances in electrified urban air mobility towards a more sustainable future.”\n\nBAE System’s energy storage system will be integrated into Eve’s eVTOL and will allow the aircraft to efficiently operate with zero emissions and low noise. The new energy storage system leverages the company’s more than 25 years of experience in providing dependable electric power and propulsion for transit buses and other heavy-duty vehicles. That experience combined with their history of developing flight critical control systems for aerospace is ideal for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) applications that depend on safety, reliability and efficiency.\n\n“BAE Systems is leading the development of advanced technology solutions and systems that will help create a more sustainable future in aviation,” said Ehtisham Siddiqui, vice president and general manager of Controls and Avionics Solutions at BAE Systems. “We are delighted to support Eve Air Mobility with our innovative energy storage system for their eVTOL aircraft.”\n\nDUC Hélice Propellers will supply the rotors for the eight lift motors and the cruise propeller. Based in France and also present in the United States, the company has more than 25 years of experience and expertise in the analysis, design, development, manufacture and maintenance of propellers, rotors, fans & others carbon composite aeronautical accessories acquired through the multiple aviation programs in which it participates.\n\n“We are extremely honored to have been selected by EVE Air Mobility as the supplier of the rotors for the eight lift motors and the cruise propeller for their production vehicle,” said Duqueine Vincent, president and founder of DUC Hélices Propellers. “This recognition is a testimony to experience and expertise in the analysis, design, development, manufacture and maintenance of carbon composite propellers, rotors, fans and other aeronautical accessories. We are grateful to EVE for putting their trust in us.”\n\nDuring the past year, the company has been working closely with certification authorities to define certification requirements while also continuing to engage with customers to understand how they will operate the aircraft and incorporate their feedback. The company has continued to advance its testing phase as part of maturing its eVTOL design. Eve recently completed wind tunnel and propeller tests and began testing its vertical lift rotors aboard a new custom truck-mounted platform in May. Eve has continued to update the aircraft to match its vehicle design to customer needs with a focus on efficiency, safety, reliability, sustainability and cost of operation.\n\nEve’s eVTOL aircraft utilizes a lift+cruise configuration with eight dedicated propellers for vertical flight and fixed wings to fly on cruise, with no change in position of these components during flight. The latest concept includes an electric pusher powered by dual electric motors that provide propulsion redundancy while ensuring high performance and safety. While offering numerous advantages including lower cost of operation, fewer parts, optimized structures and systems, it has been developed to offer efficient thrust with low sound.\n\n“Eve has taken a ‘building blocks’ approach to further enhance the maturity of the technology and its eVTOL,” said Alice Altissimo, vice president of program management and operation of Eve. “We continue to make very good progress and we are looking forward to working with these new suppliers as we accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable air travel.”\n\nEve expects to name additional component suppliers including flight-control systems, avionics, airframe and power-management systems in the future. The company plans to start the assembly of its first full-scale eVTOL prototype during the second half of 2023, followed by the test campaign in 2024. Eve’s eVTOL is scheduled to begin deliveries and enter service in 2026.\n\nImage: https://bit.ly/3PinctK\n\nFollow Eve on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn and YouTube: @EveAirMobility\n\nAbout Eve\n\nEve is dedicated to accelerating the Urban Air Mobility ecosystem.
