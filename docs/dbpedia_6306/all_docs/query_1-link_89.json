        "text": "The company up and decides to have a week of mandatory overtime that isn't technically ot because the campaign is closed for holidays. There will be no time and half pay for this because you're just getting 40 hrs. The company is shady. There are all sorts of policies that are broken, dress code violations that go unnoticed because of who the person is friends with. They tell you you can make up to 1.25 more an hr but make it nearly unattainable. The only way to move up in the company is to have a criminal record. You literally do mot know who is sitting next to you all day, are they a thief, a drug addict, sex offender. How do you have a contract with a state organization if you have people working for you with felonies? Oh, and in order to get up to use the bathroom, you have to call workforce and ask permission"
