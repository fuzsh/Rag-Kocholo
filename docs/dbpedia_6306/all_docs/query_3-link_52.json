        "text": "TL3.12 Issue date: 05 Oc<strong>to</strong>ber 2012 ENGINES AND PROPELLERS FITTED TO LAA AIRCRAFT This Technical Leaflet lists all of <strong>the</strong> propeller/engine combinations that have been approved by LAA Engineering, for information purposes only. This list may be useful when trying <strong>to</strong> decide which propeller <strong>to</strong> fit <strong>to</strong> your <strong>aircraft</strong>. This list should be treated with caution, as <strong>the</strong>re is no guarantee that if a combination has been approved in <strong>the</strong> past it will be approved again <strong>to</strong>day. It follows that none of <strong>the</strong>se combinations can be considered “LAA recommended”. Indeed many of <strong>the</strong>m may be far from optimum <strong>and</strong> may have been approved for a special purpose such as a ferry flight. Those which have been approved on one <strong>aircraft</strong> only should be treated with particular suspicion. Propellers are expensive items so if <strong>the</strong>re is any doubt regarding <strong>the</strong> suitability of any propeller <strong>to</strong> a particular airframe/engine, LAA Engineering should be contacted for advice. Unless a particular propeller is specified on <strong>the</strong> Operating Limitations Sheet of <strong>the</strong> Permit <strong>to</strong> Fly of an <strong>aircraft</strong>, or on <strong>the</strong> Propeller List PTL/1 for <strong>the</strong> specific type, it may not be <strong>fitted</strong> without authorisation from LAA Engineering.
