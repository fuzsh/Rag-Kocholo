I lucked into a great deal on a Prince Prop and that is the only reason I am selling. I can accept PayPal. Check must clear bank before shipping - please allow 10 days for check to clear. Putting on Barnstormers next week...:\n\nSTERBA PROP Good Recent Re-finished Condition, 70/76 pitch, 160 mph indicated at 2k msl off my Tailwind/Cougar Lycoming O-320 160 hp engine $325. https://photos.app.goo.gl/HerSBDSmV5PWdKTB7\n\n3/8\" PROP BOLTS and CRUSH PLATE with adapters to fit above Sterba Prop, $50. https://photos.app.goo.gl/M52b1sdqkvdhNNsAA\n\n4\" SABER PROP EXTENSION 3/8\" bolt holes to fit above Sterba Prop, $325. https://photos.app.goo.gl/GLEy293TvsZvTPtZA\n\nYes the Sterba Prop could be installed with 7/16 or 1/2 inch bolts. With the attached picture I have tried to show how the prop is setup. The bolt is 3/8 in a tubing adapter which is in a 1/2 hole (the 6 bolt holes are about .500 -0/+.03 diameter). If you wanted to put tubing adapters in the prop holes you would probably have to lathe down the right size tubing.\n\nThe crush plate is 6 inches. I can make a new custom crush plate out of aluminum or steel any thickness and diameter you want for 50 to $60. I have the NC vertical mill and the code for these already done.\n\nI have two 4\" extensions for sale, one is 3/8 and the other is 7/16.\n\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/kCBzt7cjtZGZWriJ7\n\nRandy\n\n719 371-3158 text ok\n\nNaa73x at Yahoo dot com\n\nN103BJ\n\nBoth of my friends sure bragged about their Prince props\n\nOn Jan 10, 2020, at 1:33 PM, \"naa73x@...\" <naa73x@...> wrote:\n\ntoggle quoted message Show quoted text\n\nLocated Silver Cliff, Colorado.
