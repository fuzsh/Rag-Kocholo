Calhoun\n\nBoeing Company, American aerospace company—the world’s largest—that is the foremost manufacturer of commercial jet transports. It is also a leading producer of military aircraft, helicopters, space vehicles, and missiles, a standing significantly enhanced with the company’s acquisition of the aerospace and defense units of Rockwell International Corporation in 1996 and its merger with McDonnell Douglas Corporation in 1997. Formerly Boeing Airplane Company, the firm assumed its current name in 1961 to reflect its expansion into fields beyond aircraft manufacture. It is headquartered in Arlington, Virginia.\n\nBoeing Company’s constituent business units are organized around three main groups of products and services—commercial airplanes, military aircraft and missiles, and space and communications. Boeing manufactures seven distinct families of commercial aircraft, which are assembled in two facilities—Renton and Everett—in Washington state and one facility in California. The Renton plant builds the narrow-body Boeing 737 and formerly built the 757 aircraft (discontinued in 2004), while the wide-body Boeing 767 and 777 aircraft and a limited number of the largely discontinued 747s are assembled at the Everett plant. The 787 aircraft are assembled at the Everett plant and at a facility in North Charleston, South Carolina. Boeing Business Jets, a joint venture of Boeing and General Electric Co., makes and markets business jets based on the 737-700 airliner as well as VIP versions of the 747, 777, and 787 airliners.\n\nThe company’s military-related activities are centred on the design, manufacture, and support of fighter aircraft, bombers, transports, helicopters, and missiles. Its products include, among others, the F-15 Eagle, F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, and AV-8 Harrier fighters; the C-17 Globemaster III airlifter; the AH-64 Apache series of attack helicopters; the CH-47 Chinook transport helicopter; and the AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control System) aircraft, based on the 767. Boeing contributes to the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor air-superiority stealth fighter and the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. In partnership with Bell Helicopter Textron, it builds the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, and, with United Technologies’ Sikorsky division, it made the RAH-66 Comanche armed reconnaissance helicopter. The company also builds the Harpoon antiship missile, the air-launched Standoff Land Attack Missile (SLAM), and the air-launched cruise missile (ALCM).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nHistory of Flight Quiz\n\nFootage of an X-15 rocket-powered aircraft being launched from a U.S. Air Force B-52 mother ship, c. 1960s.

It participates in processing, ground operation, and training activities for the U.S. space shuttle fleet through United Space Alliance, a joint venture with Lockheed Martin Corporation. As the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA’s) prime contractor for the International Space Station (ISS), Boeing leads an industry team comprising most major U.S. aerospace companies and hundreds of smaller suppliers and integrates the work of ISS participants from non-U.S. countries. It is also building a crewed spacecraft, the CST-100 Starliner, to carry astronauts to the ISS. Its involvement in commercial space development includes partnerships in the multinational Sea Launch Company and in the Teledesic consortium formed to build a satellite-based, Internet-like telecommunications service. It also makes satellites for the Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS). In 2016 Boeing employed a workforce of about 150,500 people in 65 countries and 27 U.S. states.\n\nOpen full sized image\n\nA Boeing Delta IV Medium+ rocket launching the GOES-N weather satellite into space, May 24, 2006.\n\nCarleton Bailie/NASA\n\nOpen full sized image\n\nThe International Space Station, imaged from the space shuttle Endeavour on December 9, 2000, after installation of a large solar array (long horizontal panels). Major elements of the partially completed station included (front to back) the American-built connecting node Unity and two Russian-built modules—Zarya, a propulsion and power module, and Zvezda, the initial habitat. A Russian Soyuz TM spacecraft, which carried up the station's first three-person crew, is shown docked at the aft end of Zvezda.\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nHistory of Boeing Company\n\nBoeing’s origin dates to 1916 when the American timber merchant William E. Boeing founded Aero Products Company shortly after he and U.S. Navy officer Conrad Westervelt developed a single-engine, two-seat seaplane, the B&W. Renamed Boeing Airplane Company in 1917, the enterprise built “flying boats” for the Navy during World War I, and in the 1920s and ’30s it successfully sold its trainers, pursuit planes, observation craft, torpedo planes, and patrol bombers to the U.S. military. In the late 1920s Boeing Airplane expanded into airmail services, and in 1928 William Boeing formed Boeing Airplane & Transport Corporation to encompass both manufacturing and airline operations. The next year the company was renamed United Aircraft and Transport Corporation and acquired several aircraft makers, among them Chance Vought, Avion (which became Northrop Aircraft), Stearman Aircraft, Sikorsky Aviation, engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney, and aircraft and propeller maker Hamilton Metalplane. In 1931 it combined four smaller airlines under its ownership into United Airlines. In 1934, under new U.S. antitrust legislation (the Air Mail Act of 1934), aircraft manufacture was required to be divorced from air transport, and a newly incorporated Boeing Airplane Company became one of the three companies to emerge from the dissolution of United Aircraft and Transport. The other two were United Aircraft Corporation (now United Technologies Corporation) and United Airlines.\n\nOpen full sized image\n\nConstruction of HS-2L “flying boats” at Boeing's Seattle facility, c. 1917.\n\nNational Archives, Washington, D.C.\n\nOpen full sized image\n\n(Foreground) Boeing B-9, a twin-engine all-metal monoplane bomber, and (background) Boeing P-26, the first monoplane fighter produced for the U.S. Army Air Corps, 1932.\n\nU.S. Air Force photograph\n\nPrior to and during World War II, Boeing Airplane Company built several famous commercial aircraft, such as the Model 247 twin-engine monoplane, the Model 314 flying boat (one of Pan American’s Clipper-class aircraft), and the Model 307 Stratoliner, the first airliner with a pressurized cabin. Boeing’s legendary bombers, the B-17 Flying Fortress (first flown in 1935) and the B-29 Superfortress (1942), played key roles in the Allied war effort in World War II. In the postwar years Boeing continued its military commitments with the six-engine B-47 Stratojet (1947) and eight-engine B-52 Stratofortress (1952) jet bombers.\n\nOpen full sized image\n\nNational Archives, Washington, D.C.\n\nOpen full sized image\n\nTwo Boeing B-29s in flight over Laredo AAF, Laredo, Texas, on Army Air Force Day, August 1, 1945.\n\nAir Force Historical Research Agency\n\nWhile Boeing was successfully selling military aircraft, its commercial products lagged behind those of rivals Douglas and Lockheed. To compete in the fierce and expanding world market after World War II, the company decided to develop an airliner, powered by turbojets, with enough range to cross the North Atlantic. After initial hesitation from airlines (most of which had committed to popular and less-expensive propeller-driven airliners from rival firms), but buttressed by sales to the U.S. Air Force in the form of an aerial tanker (the KC-135 Stratotanker), the four-engine plane, designated the 707, went into commercial service in 1958 on a Pan American transatlantic route. The aircraft quickly won over passengers with its shorter flight time and smoother ride and subsequently helped to revolutionize air travel. The 707 was followed by the 727 trijet and 737 twinjet, which entered service in 1964 and 1968, respectively. The 737 was developed into a modern family of planes, and by the end of the 20th century it had become the world’s best-selling commercial aircraft. The high development costs of the 747 “Jumbo Jet,” the world’s first wide-body jetliner, almost forced Boeing into bankruptcy, but, when the 400-seat aircraft went into service in 1970, it allowed airlines to offer affordable long-range air travel for the general public and gave Boeing a monopoly position in this market segment.\n\nU.S. Air Force KC-135A Stratotanker taking off on a test flight of its winglets (bendable wing tips), c. mid-1970s.\n\nNASA/Dryden Research Aircraft Movie Collection\n\nOpen full sized image\n\nUnited Airlines Boeing 737-522.\n\nDylan Ashe\n\nOverview of a Boeing 747 undergoing a comprehensive inspection known as the D-Check.\n\nContunico © ZDF Studios GmbH, Mainz\n\nIn 1960 Boeing purchased Vertol Corporation, then the world’s largest independent manufacturer of helicopters. As Boeing Helicopters, the unit focused on tandem-rotor helicopters and was responsible for the development of the CH-47 Chinook and CH-46 Sea Knight military transport helicopters (first flown in 1961 and 1962, respectively). Boeing’s work on missiles, which began in 1945, resulted in such weapons as the silo-launched Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile (deployed in 1962) and the AGM-86B/C air-launched cruise missile (deployed in 1982).\n\nIn the space sector during the 1960s and ’70s, Boeing built the Lunar Orbiters, NASA’s first spacecraft to orbit the Moon (1966–67), and the Mariner 10 space probe, which took the first close-up pictures of the surface of Mercury (1974–75). It also designed and built the first stage of the Saturn V rockets that sent Apollo astronauts to the Moon and the battery-powered Lunar Roving Vehicles used in the Apollo 15, 16, and 17 missions. In 1976 it entered the upper-stage-rocket arena when it was selected to develop the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS), a two-stage payload delivery vehicle that can be taken into space by either a space shuttle or a launcher such as the Titan. In 1993 NASA selected Boeing as the prime contractor for the ISS, and two years later the company became responsible for the integration and verification of ISS systems and the design, analysis, manufacture, verification, and delivery of the American components of the station. In 2014 NASA awarded a commercial spaceflight contract to Boeing to finish the development of its CST-100 spacecraft to carry crews to the ISS. Since the discontinuation of its space shuttle program in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian transports to take astronauts to the ISS.\n\nThe Lunar Roving Vehicle, used on the Apollo 15, 16, and 17 missions. Built by Boeing largely of aluminum alloy, the vehicle was designed to carry two astronauts and their tools, instruments, and lunar samples up to a total payload of 490 kg (1,080 pounds), which was more than twice its own weight; nevertheless, it could be folded into a space 1.5 metres (5 feet) wide and 0.5 metre (20 inches) thick for stowage in the Lunar Module. Each steel-mesh wheel was driven by a small electric motor, which gave the rover a maximum speed of 12 km (8 miles) per hour on clear ground. Its large dish antenna transmitted a TV signal from a front-mounted colour camera directly to Earth.\n\nNASA\n\nIn the 1960s and ’70s Boeing also diversified into areas such as marine craft (hydrofoils), transit systems, energy production, and agriculture but later refocused on aerospace. In 1981 the company first flew its twin-engine, wide-body Boeing 767, followed by its twin-engine, single-aisle 757 the next year. By featuring a common flight deck for the two aircraft, pilots who trained and qualified on one plane could also fly the other, thus reducing cost and increasing productivity for carriers. This concept of commonality also applied to more than 40 percent of all 757-767 parts. For its next jetliner, the twin-engine, wide-body 777, Boeing involved several key airlines in the development process in order to ensure that market needs and customer preferences were satisfied. Advances in computers and computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) software allowed Boeing to develop the 777 entirely on computers without having to build a physical mock-up of the airplane. The first flight took place in 1994.\n\nOpen full sized image\n\nBoeing 777-200 aircraft (the baseline model) in operation with United Airlines.\n\n© Nicolas Economou—NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nOpen full sized image\n\nAdrian Pingstone\n\nOpen full sized image\n\nContinental Airlines Boeing 757, c. 2005.\n\nAdrian Pingstone\n\nIn 1991 the U.S. Air Force chose a design offered by a consortium comprising Lockheed (later Lockheed Martin), Boeing, and General Dynamics for a twin-engine advanced tactical fighter with stealth features; the aircraft was named the F-22 Raptor and was first flown in 1997. In 1996 Boeing and Lockheed Martin received U.S. defense contracts to build competitive technology demonstrators for the Joint Strike Fighter, intended as an affordable, next-generation, multirole fighter for the armed services of the United States and Britain. In 1995 Boeing joined Ukrainian, Russian, and Anglo-Norwegian partners to form Sea Launch, a commercial launch services company that sent satellites into geostationary orbit from a floating platform at an equatorial site in the Pacific Ocean. Commercial launches began in 1999. In 2000 Boeing acquired the satellite business of Hughes Electronics.\n\nIn 2003 Boeing began taking orders for the 787 Dreamliner, a mid-range jet with speeds (Mach 0.85) that would match the fastest wide-body long-range planes but with vastly improved fuel efficiency, thanks to new high-bypass turbofan engines built by Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce and a radically innovative body design. Roughly half of the primary structure of the 787, including the fuselage section and the wings, was made of carbon-fibre and plastic composite materials, lighter than the aluminum alloys used in most aircraft. Many airlines, faced with rising fuel costs, saw the 787 as key to upgrading their fleets in the following decade and ordered hundreds of the new planes. Originally scheduled to be delivered for commercial service starting in 2008, the 787 was beset with several production problems, not the least of which was failure of the crucial fuselage section in stress tests. Consequently, Boeing did not make initial delivery until 2011. In January 2013, following an airworthiness directive issued by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that was subsequently taken up by regulators worldwide, all 787s in operation globally were temporarily grounded until a potential risk for battery fire was corrected."
