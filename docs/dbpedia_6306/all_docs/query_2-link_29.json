        "text": "We hand-craft powered paraglider propellers! GSC Systems is one of the oldest and most globally-renowned propeller manufacturing companies for the light aircraft and airboat industries today.\n\nWe began with handmade hardwood fixed-pitch propellers and also developed the ground adjustable TECH II and TECH III. With the TECH series, customers are able to replace single blades rather than changing the complete propeller.\n\nWith our modern production equipment, we can offer the PPG customer the same high-quality products that our conventional aircraft customers have depended upon. We offer the best of both worlds; a complete line of fixed-pitch props, or choose from our 2-blade and 3-blade fully ground-adjustable product lines.\n\nOur advantage is that we have a CMM in house, which means if you have a unique or damaged prop, we can duplicate the original. Even better, we can even modify it if necessary to get the optimum RPM and thrust that you require."
