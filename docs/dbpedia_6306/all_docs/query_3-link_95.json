        "text": "WE NEED A CFIG at Shreveport Soaring Club, Inc.--\n\nShreveport Soaring Club in Gilliam, LA is a 50 year old plus gliding club. It is the oldest and only gliding club in Louisiana. Unfortunately our CFIG Wayne Crank, Jr. passed away suddenly. The Club needs a CFIG to teach prospective glider students and to survive as a club. If anyone is a CFI we can work with you to pay all or part of a CFIG certificate to get your CFIG. The Soaring Society of America offers $2500 toward a CFIG rating.\n\nIf interested and you can teach on weekends, please contact Glenn McGovern, Shreveport Soaring Club Inc. email gcmcg@mac.com and cell 504 908 1404.\n\nAs most of you know, Charlie Hammonds is a new member of the Louisiana Aviation Hall of Fame and is currently in the process of selling his hangar and business. Throughout his career, Hammonds acquired a vast collection of aviation artifacts ranging from antiques from WWII, aviation memorabilia, to signed Top Gun paraphernalia…. So much so that it fills a small museum that he created in his hangar on the Houma-Terrebonne Airport (KHUM). Charlie would like to sell this collection. Here are a couple of pictures of Hammonds in his museum which gives you a glimpse of what is available. If you are interested in aviation artifacts, you definitely don't want to miss this opportunity to contact Charlie, go see what he has available and make an offer to acquire it. You can call him at 985-637-9800 or email him at hammondskhum@gmail.com.\n\nNOW FOR SALE, 20% INTEREST IN N15FP, A 1977 C-172N\n\nOur aircraft is hangared at KMJD, Picayune Mississippi. This is a five member co-ownership non-profit LLC named Foxtrot Papa, LLC. Monthly dues are $200.00 and flight time is $90.00 per hour wet. The 2024 annual was just completed in May 10th and the next IFR cert is due in September 2024. Our last annuals (June, 2017, May 2018, February, 2020, Feb. 2021, March, 2022 and April, 2023) were extensive and through by Phillips Aviation. At the time for the 2019 annual N15FP was down awaiting the new engine. The last and most recent annual was done by Dispatch Aviation and completed May 10th, 2024. N15FP is equipped with ADS-B in and out (Stratus ESG and Stratus 2S) and a KLN-64 DME. VOR and LOC/GS approaches capable. Recently 7/2022) a Garmin GPS-175 and GI-106B CDI was installed for RNAV approaches Currently N15FP has a Lycoming factory “zero time” O320-H2AD, 160 hp. engine (installed Sept. 2019) which is broken in and currently has about 277 hours on the engine. The aircraft has an L.E.D. Landing light and a dynamic prop balance was done in June, 2020. It has fresh main Goodyear tires (balanced) with new brake pads and rotors as well. Recent added features include Rosen visors, door stewards and a CHT (cylinder head temperature by ASL ECT204B) monitor. We also have an EZ-Go gas powered tug to move N15FP around with. When hangared a battery maintainer is connected.\n\nInterested parties may be low-time but for insurance reasons it is preferred they have their private pilot’s license. To become a partner, existing partners must approve the candidate as well as our insurer AVEMCO. My name is George Palm and I am the managing partner. With the new engine, this share normally would go for $20,000.00 based on an aircraft valuation of $100K plus. However, we (Foxtrot Papa, LLC) are willing to negotiate on your offer. If you are interested please contact me using the following contact info:\n\nGeorge Palm\n\nE-Mail: jardonyx@att.net\n\nTelephone: 985-643-5326\n\nThe East Baton Rouge Sheriffs Office dive/rescue team sometimes works air shows where they have to respond if an aircraft goes down in the water. Their team is very well trained and has the most modern equipment to respond to vehicles, evidence, persons, etc in the water. However, they do not have experience in attempting to rescue a warbird pilot from the water. After team discussion, they are now attempting to locate a T6, T28, etc/warbird fuselage that they can practice opening the canopy, giving life support to the pilot, cutting the straps, etc and getting the pilot out safely.\n\nThey would really appreciate it if someone has one they would like to donate. They can pick it up within 5-600 miles from Baton Rouge. Please contact John Buie at 225-773-0190 if you can help.\n\nAviation Academy of Louisiana is proud to announce that we are now an official Robinson R66 dealership!\n\nAs the only R66 dealership within approximately 600 miles in New Iberia, LA, we are thrilled to offer this exceptional helicopter to our customers.\n\nThe Robinson R66 Turbine helicopters are renowned for their reliability, economy, and ease of maintenance.

This unique aircraft would make an incredible addition to any warbird enthusiast's collection! Presently owned by the Commemorative Air Force and operated by the Big Easy Wing, this aircraft was built by Louis Langhurst in the US over a 6-year period and completed in 1979. With no original blueprints available, Langhurst developed the plans for the replica based on one of the only two original, intact Stukas in existence. The aircraft is based on the most produced type during WWII, the Ju 87B-2 Stuka.\n\nThis Stuka replica is painted in the same scheme and unit markings as that of Germany's most highly decorated Stuka pilot, Oberst Hans-Ulrich Rudel, who commanded III Gruppe/Stuka Geschwader 2 Immelman (III./StG2) on the Eastern Front during WWII. In November of 1980, Rudel was actually able to fly in this very aircraft! Of the plane's performance he stated: \"It is handling exactly as the real Stuka, only how nice to fly one and not be shot at!\"\n\nThe world class aircraft was on display at the San Diego Air and Space Museum for ten years and has since been featured in a number of videos throughout the years and has flown in airshows around the country, including EAA Airventure in Oshkosh, WI.\n\nThe Langhurst Stuka has completed conditional inspections and is fully airworthy. Currently, the aircraft is in need of an ADS-B. The aircraft is equipped with smoke oil generator and a working siren to simulate WW2 aerial action.\n\nLocated in New Orleans\n\n$900,000\n\nClick For Details\n\nSupply chain issues?

Aircraft values across the industry have also spiked due to this demand and limited supply of training and advanced aircraft.\n\n“Our focus is on the pilots and operators that have big demand for flight time, but lack the aircraft acquisition capital to stay in the air,” according to Taffet. “With this surge in pilot instruction, more training and advanced aircraft are needed quickly to facilitate flight operations and pilot proficiency, and we’ve attracted a great team of investors to our company to underwrite the critical aircraft supply needed to address this demand.”\n\nMore information on the aircraft leasing program is available at https://www.gracenjules.com/.\n\nNOW FOR SALE, 20% INTEREST IN N15FP, A 1977 C-172N\n\nPictures taken 9/28/2018 at KMJD\n\nNOW FOR SALE, 20% INTEREST (5th Share) IN N15FP, A 1977 C-172N\n\nOur aircraft is hangared at KMJD, Picayune Mississippi.
