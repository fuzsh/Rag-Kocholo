        "text": "There, spread across two acres of pavement, stood a carnival of contraptions—mirrors, clamps, hoses, reflectors, converters, wires, propellers, ducts, cables, sails, meters, gauges, and, here and there, something referred to as an anaerobic digester or a Darrieus rotor.\n\nALBUQUERQUE, Aug. 17—It looked as if Rube Goldberg had gone berserk.\n\nAnd amid the hardware, dozens of hard‐hatted college students fiddled, eager to explain how, if you put, say, cow manure in here, mixed it here, passed it through here, converted it to something else here, and piped it over here, you'd end up with more than enough methane gas to fry your dinner steaks.\n\nOr they would explain how to light an oceanside cottage with the surf, how to play a stereo with the wind, how to run a movie projector in an isolated village on sugar cane, and how both to heat and air‐condition a house with the sun.\n\nThe students, contestants in a competition aimed at solving the energy crisis, were trying to design and build hardware to tap energy from such unconventional sources as the sun, the wind, the waves and biological wastes for use in the home, on the farm, or in small factories.\n\n40 Teams Take Part\n\nForty teams from 33 universifies in the United States and Canada spent a year readying their entries—mostly solar collectors and wind machines—for testing and evaluation by experts here last week on the grounds of Sandia Laboratories, a nuclear research company.\n\n“Americans are just catching on to the fact that it is now practical to provide some or a lot of their home energy needs using alternate energy sources, and one of the aims of this competition is to demonstrate how,” said Mark Radtke, the 24‐year‐old president of a nonprofit corporation called SCORE, an acronym for Student Competitions on Relevant Engineering.\n\nThe organization started three years ago with a contest to build safe, low‐polluting automobiles. Last year competing students turned their attention to innovative fire‐fighting apparatus.\n\nThis year, more than two dozen teams entered solar collectors. The best over‐all entry, according to the experts, was a lightweight and efficient flat‐plate collector system built by a team from the Illinois Institute of Technology. Its main virtue, the judge said, was that it was simple and could be built and installed now by the average homeowner to save on heating bills by turning the sun's rays into space heat and hot water.\n\nIt works like this: The sun's rays are absorbed by flat black panels under which copper tubes carry water that is heated and then stored in holding tanks for later heating use.\n\nMost of the solar entries, however, were disappointing to William M. Bohon, a 22‐ year‐old University of Oklahoma graduate engineer whose focusing collector, which utilized extremely thin glass reflectors, impressed the experts and won him a special award.\n\nHe has applied for two patents on his solar device for home or neighborhood energy use and, last year, with another student, he applied for a patent on a design for a car that runs on both solar energy and gasoline.\n\n“I came here hoping to see new ideas,” he said, “but from what I've seen there is really nothing new here. Probably 90 per cent of the solar entries are flat‐plate collectors which have been around for years. A lot of teams just put together things that are old hat.”\n\nMr. Bohon's entry has extra‐thin silver‐coated glass reflectors attached to Fiberglas to cut down on the cost, weight and fragility of conventional solar reflector mirrors. The reflected sun's rays are used to heat water stored under pressure at 400 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nInnovative or not, the competition is important because it can help demonstrate to the public what is feasible, said Harold A. Spuhler, a National Science Foundation representative on the expert evaluation panel.\n\nAnother panelist, Robert Schlesinger, a solar researcher at Cal Tech's Jet Propulsion Laboratories, agrees.\n\n“This is sort of a seed‐corn operation compared with the state of the technology,” he said. “However, it is important because it helps show that for the first time since the water wheel, an individual can produce his own energy.”\n\nExamples of Work\n\nFor example, teams from the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, Iowa State, the University of Florida, Penn State and Michigan State rigged solar and wind energy systems together to produce enough space heat, hot water, air conditioning and electricity for the average home. Michigan State added a biodigester to make methane for cooking out of household wastes and booked the whole system up to a low‐cost minicomputer that monitors the production and allocation of energy.\n\nEntrants from Clemson, Oklahoma and Forsyth Technical Institute used the farm's Most plentiful by‐product—cow manure — to produce methane gas used to heat water and run a small internal combustion engine to produce electricity.\n\nTeams from Washington State and the University of Wisconsin entered systems to burn coal relatively pollu tion‐free in home heating furnaces.\n\nAmong the windmill entries was a device holding what looked like four giant ice cream cones. It was devised by the team from North Carolina State at Raleigh to work in the slightest breeze. Two hours after it was set up here, howeVer, a 65 milean‐hour gust came along, picked it up and demolished it.\n\nGary Garriott, a 27‐year‐old former Peace Corpsman, headed a team from the University of Wisconsin at Green Bay using space‐age fuel cells to make electricity from alcohol. He hopes to adapt it for use in underdeveloped countries where commercial electricity is not available.\n\nAlcohol, made from sugar cane or any other plant substance used to make liquor, is turned into hydrogen, which passes through a fuel cell, which electrochemically changes it into electricity that is stored in batteries.\n\nThe only wave ‐ power project was submitted by the University of Houston. Using an “artificial reef” and a ramp to build up the height of the waves, Houston's apparatus collects water from them in a holding tank from where it rushes out to turn an electrical generator.\n\nMike Morris, a 21‐year‐old Houston team member, said energy researchers seemed to be ignoring wave power except in Britain. But, he said, with projections showing that 75 per cent of the United States population will probably be living within 50 miles of the ocean by the year 2000, waves could be an important source of power."
