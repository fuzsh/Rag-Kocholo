        "text": "The Wright brothers perfected their design to the point where they could sustain flights of 24 miles in which they could bank, turn and do \"figure eights.\" But in 1905, when the Wright brothers offered their invention to the United States Army, it was rejected without any consideration. Even the patent office was skeptical; an application filed in 1903 was finally approved and granted in 1906 for a \"flying machine.\" In 1909, the first great international aviation meet was held in Rheims, France. Sure of victory, the Wright brothers entered three planes in hopes of dominating the event. A young unknown won the competition. His name was Glenn Curtiss.\n\nAs a result of Glenn Curtiss' early success, The Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company became the largest aircraft manufacturer in the world during World War I and went public in 1916 with Curtiss as president. Curtiss had become the world's largest aviation company, employing 18,000 at its Buffalo facility and 3,000 at its Hammondsport, New York location. They produced 10,000 aircraft during World War I, more than 100 in a single week.\n\nWorld War I greatly accelerated the pace of airplane development worldwide; speed, range and reliability constantly increased together with a newly emerging engineering discipline, aerodynamics, that would guide airplane development forever after.\n\nWhen Wright Aeronautical was incorporated in 1919, its charter was the design and manufacture of aero engines. Although the Wright brothers were no longer involved with the company (Wilbur had died and Orville had other interests), it can be said that the Wright Aeronautical engine tradition began with the first Wright brothers' engine in 1903.\n\nMost engines of the period were water-cooled and suffered frequent cooling system failures. Radiators came apart; porous engine castings, lines, hoses and gaskets leaked. Failure rates were of great concern, particularly to the Navy where over-water flying was more hazardous. Wright did some work with air-cooled engines for the Army, but success came when the company developed a relationship with Charles J. Lawrance.\n\nThe Lawrance Aero Engine Corporation bore his name. Lawrance was an engineer devoted to the development of air-cooled radial engines. He had started the development of a series of promising engine designs and demonstrated a working model to the Navy. With a union between Lawrance and Wright, Lawrance could provide technical leadership and Wright its formidable financial, engineering and manufacturing resources. Wright bought his company and installed him as Chief Engineer, starting what would be their principal business for the next 40 years.\n\nAfter purchasing the Lawrance Aero Engine Corporation, Wright Aeronautical was able to successfully design and build the J-5C Whirlwind. It had 9 cylinders; was light at 510 lbs.; had no water-cooling appurtenances. It was simple and easily maintained. The Whirlwind developed 220 HP at 1800 rpm, a low speed that contributed to its reliability.\n\nWright Aeronautical now had a first-class product and looked for a way to advertise the engine and show it to the world. On May 20, 1927, a sleek Ryan monoplane named \"The Spirit of St. Louis\" took off from Roosevelt Field in New York. Piloted by Captain Charles A. Lindbergh, the little plane touched down at LeBourget Airport in Paris, France, 33 hours, 39 minutes and 3,610 miles later. The powerplant which performed flawlessly on this epic journey: a Wright J-5 Whirlwind, Engine No. 7331. Lindbergh's story is aviation history. Lindbergh's flight was an international triumph for Wright Aeronautical. The Whirlwind engine never missed a beat. Lindbergh's feat made the J-5C the most popular engine for long distance air travel. Soon more flights were made to Europe, to the North and South poles and across the Pacific with Whirlwind power.\n\nAs a result of the successes of the pioneers of the aviation industry, Curtiss-Wright Corporation was formed from the merger of 12 Wright and Curtiss affiliated companies on July 5, 1929. On August 22nd of that same year, Curtiss-Wright Corporation was listed on the New York Stock Exchange where it still trades today.\n\nCurtiss-Wright's transition from an overdependence on mature products such as reciprocating engines and propellers to the balanced multi-market, multinational structure in existence today truly began to accelerate in the 1960s. While Curtiss-Wright continued to support military and commercial users of their reciprocating and jet engines, and propellers, with parts and overhaul services, a new management team began to push the technological capabilities of Curtiss-Wright into new and allied growth markets. While the Company became involved in a number of businesses during the coming years, it was during this decade that the cornerstones of what the Company is today were put into place.\n\nAs the space program began to form, Curtiss-Wright was able to bring its skills in metalworking to bear on that new and growing area. The Company took on the role of major subcontractor, and developed the equipment and sophisticated methods for the mass production of precision-machined rocket motor cases and exhaust nozzles. Decades of expertise in precision design, engineering and machining in propellers and transmission systems were redirected to the engineering and production of mechanical, hydraulic and electro-mechanical control and actuation systems for aerospace and defense applications.\n\nWith the acquisition of Target Rock Corporation in 1961, the Company laid the foundation of what is now our industrial valves business. With this addition, Curtiss-Wright moved into the highly specialized field of safety and relief valves for use in United States Navy nuclear propulsion systems on submarines and aircraft carriers. This market entry was broadened in 1967 when Target Rock Corporation received their first order for valves for a commercial nuclear power plant - an offshoot of their original military programs.\n\nThe Company's Surface Technologies division began with an acquisition made in 1968 that took the corporation into the industrial service field. Metal Improvement Company, which provided shot-peening and shot-peen forming services to industrial and aerospace customers, had only three plants at the time of acquisition.\n\nThe unprecedented replacement cycle of the world airline industry coupled with increased traffic growth and new routes combined to swamp the three major commercial airframe manufactures - Boeing, McDonnell-Douglas and Airbus Industrie - with new orders. At the time, Curtiss-Wright supplied actuation and control systems and components to Boeing for the 737, 747 and 757 programs. Peen forming of wing skins for commercial programs at Boeing, McDonnell-Douglas and Airbus Industries were being performed. Curtiss-Wright now possessed some of the most technologically advanced capabilities in our industry to design and manufacture, or form and peen, aerospace components.\n\nHowever, developments in the military and commercial aerospace industry provided some cause for concern. Improvements in East-West relations and the growing pressure to reduce the Federal deficit resulted in a reduction in military spending by the US Government. A slowdown in the commercial airline industry led to declines in commercial airline ridership and reduced orders for new aircraft. These changes in the aerospace/defense industry in the 1990s required participants to re-examine how they would conduct business in the future with one result being a consolidation movement within the industry that is, to some extent, still in progress. While production rates of commercial aircraft eventually began to increase, there would be few new commercial and military aircraft programs. Under these circumstances, the ability to gain position on these programs became increasingly important.\n\nIn order to deal with the cyclical nature of the industry, Curtiss-Wright expanded first into the overhaul servicing of the Company's manufactured transmissions and actuators primarily for the wing-flap systems. In 1996, we acquired a maintenance, repair and overhaul business from Aviall and became a complete overhaul and repair provider by expanding our capabilities to include other aircraft components and systems.\n\nIn 1995, because of the Company's diversification efforts, our nuclear business commenced shipment of multiple valve programs for the Korean commercial nuclear power generation construction program, which included safety relief valves, solenoid valves and motor operated valves. In addition, we expanded the products we could offer our commercial nuclear customers when we acquired Enertech in 1998. In addition to marketing our own products, Enertech is also a distributor for other manufacturers. When added to Curtiss-Wright's existing line, we were now fully equipped to meet the needs of our customer base.\n\nAnother sign of our diversification efforts was the 1998 acquisition of Curtiss-Wright Drive Technology. Drive Technology designs and manufactures drives and suspension systems for armored military vehicles and tilting systems for high-speed railway car applications. Headquartered in Switzerland and now part of the Defense Solutions division, its addition not only introduced us into these new markets but also provided us with hydraulic and electronic capabilities that are applied to the Company's aerospace product lines."
