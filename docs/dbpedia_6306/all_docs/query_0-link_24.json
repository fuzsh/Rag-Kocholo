I've found a flight controllable IVOprop whose moment of inertia fits within the Hirth 3502 specs. But I wondered, 'What about prop diameter?' \n \nMy first though was to keep the same pressure differential through the prop disk. The slower turning prop needs a larger diameter to move the same mass at the same pressure differential. It turns out this  is the square-root of the ratio of the two",
