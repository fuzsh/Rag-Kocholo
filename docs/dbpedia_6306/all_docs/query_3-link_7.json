        "text": "Sensenich's Guide # 612, their current propeller selection online lists the W72CK44 (but not the 72C44). Aircraft #1 has no propeller and the TCDS specifically lists the 72C44. Aircraft #2 has an ancient 72C44, it's definitely wood. The \"Sensenich 72x44 wooden propeller\" is listed on the performance charts in the maintenance manual but the TDCS just says:\n\n\"Propeller - wood (fixed or adjustable pitch) 11 lb. (-58)\"\n\nSo to be legal I could buy a W72CK44 and have an A&P mount it on aircraft #2, and have him swap the prop from #2 onto #1, unless they are the same. Then I don't have to do double work to separate parts that are working well together for no actual gain.\n\nFrom an old revision of P-170 (the prop TC)...\n\nType Fixed pitch wood Material Laminated birch/maple with fabric and metal tipping; or with synthetic leading edge No. of blades Two...\n\n72C 691 65 2350 72” 50”-40” 6 25/64\" 4-3/8” 6-1/8\" 3-3/8\" 10 1,2a\n\n72CK 691 65 2350 72” 50”-40” 6 25/64\" 4-3/8” 6-1/8\" 3-3/8\" 10 1,2a\n\n(Current) Revision 28 of P-170 lists the W72CK with the same data as the 72CK above and it states in notes that Sensenich began prefixing wood blanks with a W in March 1968, but propellers sometimes are not manufactured for years after a blank is laminated. I am wondering if they just added \"additional\" nomenclature when they added new features. Looking at six sales sites I do not believe that the 72C is still being made / sold unless its really the same as a 72CK / W72CK. Which 5/6 of those sites have offered for sale.\n\nbut the TDCS just says:\n\nSo to be legal I could buy a W72CK44 and have an A&P mount it on aircraft #2,\n\nYou put a lot of credence in the TCDS but keep in mind it is created for a certain purpose and you may need other documentation in order to complete your intended maintenance/alteration per Part 43. In reality, TCDSs play a very small role in maintenance and usually only when a conformity issue as arisen. The older Aircraft Specification sheets played a slightly different role under the CARs but under todays FARs they are considered equal to the TCDS. So as mentioned, best to either find the Sensinich docs I indicated above or contact Sensinich direct to ensure your swap above will be a minor vs a major alteration.\n\nwith the same data as the 72CK above and it states in notes that Sensenich began prefixing wood blanks with a W in March 1968,\n\nFYI: as I mentioned previously, back in the day (pre-68), there were wooden and metal props with the same specs. Sensinich differentiated them by adding “M” or “W”. The \"W\" has always been there. After ’68 the M was dropped. But you don’t have to take my word about it:\n\nOne, no human is perfect. I'm not, but I can't rain legal repercussions down on others because of my ignorance or capriciousness.\n\nTo put it frankly, I don't put any technical credence whatsoever in the TCDS, it's crap, albeit legal crap. I have a file with literally thousands of errors the FAA made converting files and making revisions. The FAA maintenance station that reweighed the aircraft (in the late 40s). Made a THREE INCH error in the empty C.G. point because in their math they equated the arm of the main wheels (+3) and the datum point. This was partially offset in that they also made a forty pound error in computing a weight because they used the previous number instead of the one they just obtained.\n\nI know the two are 100% interchangeable. I want some sort of paperwork to toss in the file to show that.\n\nAlso I have little confidence in what any firm puts out as sales material. Engineers design things, Craftspeople build things, salesmen tell the customer whatever they want to hear (a polite way of saying lie). Obviously the first propellers that Sensenich made were wood. Obviously they did not mark wood propellers W when all of their propellers were made of wood. They only thought to add an M or W after they began making metal props. Then it made warehousing and shipping easier.*\n\nSensenich Memo #46 dated December 1976 states \"Wood aircraft propellers shipped after April 25, 1968 include \"W\" prefix.\" That supports the TCDS (deleted in Revision 24) note concerning the \"W\" prefix. Sadly that is not the issue here.\n\n*Playing Machiavelli, I bet they deleted the \"M\" because customers figured out that there was an identical, but less expensive, wooden propeller with the same properties.\n\nFrom; https://www.sensenich.com/company/: Sensenich Propeller was established in 1932 to manufacture fixed pitch wood aircraft propellers for the growing aviation market. In 1949 we began to manufacture wood propellers for the burgeoning airboat market. Aluminum propellers for aircraft was added to our product line in the 1950’s. During the 1960’s the use of UAV’s became prevalent and Sensenich was right there with propellers for the new industry. In 1999 We began our highly successful line of ground adjustable composite propellers for Airboat, Aircraft and UAV’s.\n\nThis fits my view of events: The Army -1 lists a \"Sensenich 72x44 propeller,\" the company produced \"MANUAL OF MAINTENANCE\" says that the aircraft has a \"Sensenich 72x44 wooden propeller\" as listed in the performance charts. The Original CAA T.C. (NOT TCDS!!) lists a \"Sensenich 72C44 propeller.\" I submit that the three are the same.\n\nThe aircraft was built as an observer for the Army. It never had an engine driven electrical system. It did have a strut mounted wind driven generator, radios, antennas, and batteries that weighed 40 or so pounds. When surplussed, the Army removed the radios. The rest came out when it was civilianized.\n\n(Note: The main wheels are 3” aft of datum, the leading edge of wing, and at flying attitude, the tail wheel is 186” aft of the main wheels or 189\" aft of datum-- facts not considered.)\n\nFrom 1947 Reweigh: CAA form 309:\n\nSECTION I - WEIGHT\n\nA.

They weighed the airplane and recorded the empty weight as 717.5 pounds. \"B.\" says, \"EMPTY WEIGHT AS WEIGHED INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING,\" which I believe. Because it's quite close to what it weighs today when changed items are backed out. But then the Balance part lists the empty weight as 756.8, the pre-re-weight empty weight. )\n\n\"My\" 1942 Taylorcraft (a TG-6 converted to a DCO-65 in 1947) has an ancient 72C44 on it. In spite of what I am told Sensenich didn't prefix wood propellers \"W\" in 1947. Why would they? They didn't make metal props until the 50's. Those I seek answers from don't know this. And nobody ever taught them to think, just to parrot. They say \"we have always...\"\n\nNo, you haven't, maybe you have since 1958... The FAA is worse, they took the original T.C.s and altered them-- adding material errors. It's a good thing people don't actually follows the rules. That would be unsafe. The \"notes\" on the paper copies of the Propeller T.C. (thanks Aaron) have been omitted from the electronic version.\n\nOn the paper copy the 72C prop is on the airframe approval and the airframe on the prop approval. On a subsequent paper version the nomenclature change is explained. But it is nowhere to be found on the \"new official copy.\""
