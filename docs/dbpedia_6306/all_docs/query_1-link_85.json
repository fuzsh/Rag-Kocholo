        "text": "Hello Follow Fournier Followers\n\nFrance lead the way with bicycling / velocipeding , by the second half of 1869 interest began to wane just innovations and massive improvements to the machines were being offered ( suspension, tension wheels, rubber tires, gearing, free wheel etc). The same race to to innovation and collapse of public interest occurred in America in the late Spring of 1869. The new bicycling / velocipede industry in France was struggling to gain renewed interest from the vast public end of 69 and early 1870 by hosting bigger and better races and shows , tri-cycling became a fade spring of 1870 ..but when France shot itself in the foot by picking on the Germans summer of 1870 ....it was all over before the croissant could be eaten.\n\nFrance spiraled into a depression and bicycling was the last thing on the average Frenchman mind. There were a few diehards that keep the candle burning , but just barley.\n\nThe bicycling industry swam across the channel to merry ole England ...and it stand there for a very long time. The few remaining bicycling manufacturers in France produced some outstanding pieces but in very limited numbers. During the 1872-5 period ( dark cycling days for France) when you find a machine they are all different , many one of kind ...now WW1 and WW2 could have clean the street of these machines but still a handful remain ..... many ( sometimes ) exquisite examples of early cycling .\n\nSearching Robert Sterba's site ..touring his collection and the world's finest cycling museum of from the comfort of your desk ... you can get an inventory of the many varied styles of bikes that remain.\n\nClick and prepare for a several hour visit ...click and learn\n\nhttp://www.sterba-bike.cz/en/?lang=EN\n\nThis period can be loosely called the \"transitional period\" when the basic Velocipede designed gave way to the high bike of the times.\n\nYou had custom makers like Meyer with English clients who were ordering the high bikes early on where as the local ( French) clients stayed with the velocipede. It was an interesting period the bikes being offered with the long saddle springs ( like a velocipede ) or the newer shorter saddle spring found on the high bikes.\n\nBelow are a few more photos of the Fournier ...with a shot of the double step...\n\nLast 4 photos are of some of my bikes also from the period all presumed French ... last one a Meyer that started life with the long saddle spring ....the long saddle springs give the rider a lot of spring and sway ( left to right) ... hence the forward movement o the shorter springs ..all machines here with tension wheels\n\nJust for reference..the high wheel design ..these early French machines are not all that high ... normally in the 40-44\" range .... it was England who pushed the wheel to the 50-60\" range in the early period (1871-2)\n\nCheers Carey\n\nHello Adrian, Carey,\n\nFirst, thank you Adrian and Carey for your efforts and assistance, they a most welcome and appreciated.\n\nCarey your transitional bicycles are fascinating. I have been getting my feet wet in this early bicycle history in France and can honestly now understand what is meant by the dark ages. It is if someone has ripped a chapter from a great novel only to leave me confused on my understanding of what has transpired over this time and pondering the existence of characters that held my interest on the previous pages.\n\nI came across this posting with the Fournier Aime bicycle while looking into Henry Fournier and pondered any family ties. Henry’s history starts after the Franco-Prussian war so I’ve been able to find a lot of good information on him. This all started with a poster I picked up at auction and have been putting together some of the history behind this man.\n\nThis poster is of an event that took place in 1893 between horses and a tandem bicycle. The main characters’ are of course S.F. Cody (Samuel Franklin), Henry Fournier, and Gaby (Pierre Huguet). The poster comes to life for me as I begin an understanding of the history of these men. S.F. Cody an American Wild West show host, a man who emulated the great Buffalo Bill Cody in almost every respect, he even changed his name from Cowdery to Cody, and his similar appearance is astonishing. He lived a life that is non-stop, and became an important figure in England early aviation. Cody is considered the father of aviation for England, much like we embrace the Wright Brothers here in the States. Henry Fournier got a start in French bicycle racing and became a great auto racer. He raced here in the U.S.A. as well as abroad and became very well respected champion. Henry eventually went into aviation as well, and I’ve just begun reading about that chapter of his life. I read an article where he crashed a plane when the support wires to the wings failed, he was hundreds of feet up when it happened but survived and continued to pursue aviation. Gaby, is really Pierre Huguet, a champion tricycle racer. He too participated in some of the early auto racing.\n\nThis race however, was won by the tandem riders of Fournier and Gaby by 5 kilometers. It was a six hour race over a two day period. Cody was allowed up to change six mounts during the event. It was quite a spectacle for the very large crowds.\n\nHi Kurt,\n\nI love the Cody poster (-:\n\nYou are right about his influence on early UK flying history, and military aviation. A couple of years ago I visited a museum at Farnborough which has some original parts of his planes, his flying trophies and a replica of his first military plane.\n\nhttp://www.airsciences.org.uk/galleries.html#bookmark25\n\nhttp://www.airsciences.org.uk/codyflyerproject/\n\nFunny how circular things are, I visited that exhibit since I was in the area, and I have an interest in early French (pre WW1) military aircraft. You can see a presentation plaque on a piece of propeller that I own from one of the first dedicated military planes ever built at the bottom of this page.\n\nhttp://albindenis.free.fr/Site_escadrille/Souscription_nationale.htm\n\nIf I do find anything of interest in the future for you, I'll be sure to let you know.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nAdrian"
