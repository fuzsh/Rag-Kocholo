        "text": "February 7, 2023\n\nSÃO PAULO, Feb. 7, 2023 – Hartzell Propeller has appointed Diamond – São Paulo as the company’s second Recommended Service Facility (RSF) in Brazil. It joins Diamond Aviação’s shop in Goiânia, which was designated a Hartzell RSF 40 years ago.\n\nDiamond’s two facilities are recognized as the only propeller shops in Brazil appointed by Hartzell Propeller to provide technical support, service, delivery, product sales and Hartzell warranty. Both shops are owned by Licurgo and Geisa Sousa.\n\n“In 1983 Diamond Aviação in Goiânia, Brazil was named by Hartzell as a Recommend Service Facility. Forty years later our family has had a second propeller shop appointed by Hartzell, in São Paulo,” said owner Licurgo Sousa.\n\n“It is an honor to be part of this select group of Recommended Service Facilities. The Diamond São Paulo facility will provide even better support to the southeast region of Brazil,” he added.\n\nPartnership and Friendship\n\n“We would like to thank Licurgo and Geisa Sousa for the partnership and friendship that we have had with them for so many years,” said Hartzell Propeller President JJ Frigge. “They successfully represent the very best in Hartzell Propeller support and maintenance and have done so for decades. They truly have kept the Hartzell-equipped fleet in Brazil flying.”\n\nThe addition of Diamond – São Paulo as Hartzell Propeller’s 25th Recommended Service Facility exemplifies the company’s commitment to increase facilities around the world capable of meeting rigorous standards for customer service. In many cases, Hartzell Propeller requirements significantly exceed those of the governing airworthiness authorities.\n\nHartzell Propeller encourages customers to use a company designated Recommended Service Facility for propeller repairs and overhauls. As a member of the network, Diamond – São Paulo and its sister shop in Goiânia provides the highest-quality propeller overhaul and repair work available, reflecting Hartzell’s customer commitment to quality and performance.\n\nExacting RSF Network Standards\n\nDiamond – São Paulo joins a network of Hartzell Propeller RSFs located throughout the Americas, Europe, Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand. This group of affiliated facilities, with factory trained technicians and state-of-the-art equipment, ensures that owners and operators of Hartzell Propeller-equipped aircraft are only a short flight, or drive, away from the best Hartzell recommended propeller service in the industry.\n\nTo achieve Hartzell Propeller’s RSF designation, Diamond – São Paulo met a number of stringent requirements, including on-site quality systems and process audits and use of factory trained and highly qualified propeller experts. In addition, the new Recommended Service Facility is required to maintain Hartzell-approved specialized propeller tools and equipment along with meeting the company’s special process approvals on an ongoing basis.\n\nAbout Diamond\n\nDiamond has the best propeller workshops in Brazil, offering services with maximum quality propellers and aeronautical engines. Its modern service infrastructure for the sale of products and services, offers the customer convenience and security. The company’s success is based on equipment, personnel training, its ISO 9001 quality management system, facilities and exclusivity of propeller manufacturers.
