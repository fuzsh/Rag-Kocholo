They tested just about anything on the market and what they found is that the next best thing to a CS prop, was still the wooden prop like the Sterba on most of the RV line. A wood prop can bend in such a way that, particularly at high speed, it almost has the same pulling effet as a CS prop you'd be adjusting on the fly.

It will not crack, the paint will flex with the prop.\n\nThe disadvantage is you will not be able to inspect the prop as you can now.\n\nTed\n\nThe pilot formerly known as Twin Engine Ted\n\nJoined\n\nOct 9, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n29,952\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\niFlyNothing\n\nFeb 2, 2012\n\n#10\n\nThank you sir!\n\nUmm... she ain't no sir.\n\nBut it is a pretty plane (and I ain't no ma'am)!\n\nNo opinions as far as fixed-pitch props go, I only know about constant-speed ones.\n\nsteingar\n\nTaxi to Parking\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 6, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n29,248\n\nLocation\n\nLand of Savages\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nsteingar\n\nFeb 2, 2012\n\n#11\n\nWhy the OP thinks he needs to change a thing on that gorgeous airplane is beyond me.

Now he only works 40 hours a week.\n\nCatto prop is a wooden prop. The proven performance increase over the Sterba is well known in the RV world, and in my experience having changed out Sterba props for Catto.\n\nThe smoothness you feel is due to balance of the engine and prop. A 2x4 can be made to feel smooth, but it is not an efficient air foil.\n\nA prop is an airfoil. Look at the Catto and look at the Sterba. Call Craig Catto and give him your engine specs and current performance numbers. He can tell you want performance improvements you can expect with his superior airfoil, and at no charge! Consultations are free.\n\nWhy not get the most out of your plane you can? Buy a Catto, sell the Sterba. Cheap performance mod.\n\nLast edited: Feb 2, 2012\n\nTed\n\nThe pilot formerly known as Twin Engine Ted\n\nJoined\n\nOct 9, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n29,952\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\niFlyNothing\n\nFeb 2, 2012\n\n#13\n\nWhy the OP thinks he needs to change a thing on that gorgeous airplane is beyond me.

I think it perform extremely well and the plane is smooooth.... It would be a waist to sell it or pay for a brand new one...\n\nBut I was afraid of the results. From the answers I received since the begining of the week, from actual repair shops and prop guys (Catto included), you can definetly paint it and get a good and lasting result.\n\nWhat I like about that is I don't have to mess with my spinner and other hardware\n\ndenverpilot\n\nTied Down\n\nJoined\n\nNov 8, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n55,473\n\nLocation\n\nDenver, CO\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nDenverPilot\n\nFeb 2, 2012\n\n#20\n\nIsn't the old mechanic's joke, \"Pilots always buy paint?\"\n\nIt looks and works great, as only wood can.\n\nWhy cover it with $2 of colored paint that makes it harder to inspect and makes the beautiful wood disappear?\n\nVarnished wood looks better than paint, IMHO.

No hardware to change out. Bulk heads do not need to be changed. A new spinner for a 6 is $110.\n\nLast edited: Feb 3, 2012\n\nTom-D\n\nTaxi to Parking\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 23, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n34,740\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nTom-D\n\nFeb 3, 2012\n\n#24\n\nBecause he came on a message board and asked for opinions.

Very light on the controls, and exceptionally good at overhead breaks.\n\nThis is a beautiful plane BTW.\n\nLast edited: Feb 3, 2012\n\nsilver-eagle\n\nEn-Route\n\nJoined\n\nMar 11, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n4,649\n\nLocation\n\nMassachusetts\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\n~John\n\nFeb 3, 2012\n\n#27\n\nI like the wood prop. To me, if you built it, you'd want a wood prop as nakad as it is. It's a beautiful plane. The natural wood adds to it.\n\nlockeed\n\nPre-takeoff checklist\n\nJoined\n\nJan 18, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n151\n\nLocation\n\nGaspe - Quebec\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nJohn\n\nFeb 3, 2012\n\n#28\n\nStunning airplane.\n\nAnd timing the pic to get the yellow flowers in the grass was a good idea too.\n\nCare to share some performance numbers you are seeing ?\n\nThanks.\n\nBen.\n\nThx a lot Ben.\n\nAgain, Van's published performance numbers for the 180HP looks to be dead on in my case.\n\n75% cruise = 190-200mph\n\nI usualy do local flights at 2200rpm @ 3-4000ft = +/-175mph\n\nSingle, I often see 2000 to 2500FPM / Gross is anywhere between 1600-2000fpm\n\nVery happy with that.\n\nI often stay in ground effet till I hit 150-160mph then pull a 45' climb to patern altidude within 10 seconds - I always enjoy the pull of that O-360 at the front\n\nGeico266\n\nTouchdown!
