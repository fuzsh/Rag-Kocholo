        "text": "Monster Crap Inductee: Jeepers Creepers 2\n\nThe Real Creeper Is Behind The Camera\n\n2003\n\nSometimes there are movies that you dread reviewing or in my case, inducting and it has nothing to do with the movie itself and more to do with who is behind the camera. This is one of those movies because we are dealing with Victor Salva, a director who is a protégé of Francis Ford Coppola…..and also a sexual predator.\n\nThe Photo That You See Is From The Sexual Offender Registry Which He Is A Lifetime Member Of\n\nYou see in the 80s, Victor was an up and coming director who caught the eye of one Francis Ford Coppola (director of The Godfather trilogy) after making a horror short called Something In The Basement. Coppola then gave him the money to make his first theatrical feature film in a film called Clownhouse, a horror film about boys stalked by escaped mental asylum patients dressed as clowns. It’s a film that has some pretty good reviews for it, but you probably have never seen because of what went on behind the scenes as during filming, Victor was alone with one of the underage actors and had that boy (who was 12) give him a blowjob which he recorded.\n\nWhen his house was raided, they also found videotapes and magazines containing child pornography so this guy was pretty much caught red-handed and had to plead guilty to lewd and lascivious conduct, oral sex with a person under fourteen, and procuring a child for pornography. Sadly, this was the 80s and for some stupid reason, the courts did not hold child sex abuse as that much of an issue so Victor Salva was sentenced to 3 years in prison (he only served 15 months of that sentence) and a lifetime registration as a sexual offender.\n\nBut despite that, Francis Ford Coppola kept Victor Salva as his protégé (because Hollywood has a very bad history of being okay with child abusers) and he was able to make films despite protests for these actions that sadly most people (me including) didn’t know about. In 2001, Victor Salva got his biggest hit with Jeepers Creepers.\n\nJeepers Creepers was a film where a brother and sister have to deal with a monstrous killer who takes body parts of individuals and you will know he is coming is the song “Jeepers Creepers” is playing. This made good money so of course, we got a sequel and that is where we are for this movie. Unfortunately for them, the actress who played the sister who survived would not return for the sequel, but hey….they got the brother, but because he died in the movie, they couldn’t use him too much other than dream sequences.\n\nFor the lead, they decided to go with a veteran actor Ray Wise who you may know as Leland Palmer in the Twin Peaks series, Dr. Alec Holland in Swamp Thing (he was not in the Swamp Thing costume), and Leon Nash in Robocop. After that, a bunch of actors who did not have any real name value was added to the rest of the cast.\n\nAnd here is a huge shocker….there is not a Monster Crap alumni in this film. So let’s just get to the induction.\n\nWe begin with words on the screen explaining the purpose of this creature.\n\nAnd We Also Find Out That It Is Day 22\n\nWe then go to a farm where our farmer Taggart is working on the farm with his youngest son Billy Taggart.\n\nBilly is putting up scarecrows as his dad is making a fence with his post puncher. He thinks someone is messing with the post puncher and blames Billy first, who says it wasn’t him and then blames his older son, Jack Taggart Jr, who also says he didn’t do it and also as well thinks Billy did it.\n\nHey, Billy Heywood From Little Big League. Guess Times Got Tough After You No Longer Were Able To Own The Minnesota Twins.\n\nWhat none of them realize is that the third scarecrow out there is not a scarecrow at all, but instead the creature known as the Creeper hiding in plain sight.\n\nThe Dog Definitely Knows Something Is Up\n\nBilly gets the sense the third scarecrow is weird and looks into it. He sees the scarecrow has talon like feet and definitely knows that is not a scarecrow.\n\nThose Ain’t Scarecrow Feet\n\nBilly makes a run for it, but pretty soon gets tackled by the Creeper. His screams are heard by his dad and Jack Jr., who see that something is wrong. Taggart gets his gun and the two chase the Creeper, who has dragging Billy along while running.\n\nProbably Should Shoot The Creature With The Shotgun. I Mean, It Won’t Work, But You Don’t Know That.\n\nUnfortunately for them and fortunately for the Creeper, the Creeper remembers that he has freaking wings and just flies away with Billy, presumably to Billy’s death.\n\nThe two are saddened by Billy’s loss and the dog is sad too. We then go to a school bus holding a men’s basketball team coming back from winning the state title.\n\nOne of the players named Scott “Scotty” Braddock who is not happy that he didn’t get more playing time as the team’s main star in the game despite winning the freaking state championship.\n\nThe rest of the team is undaunted as they put up a banner for a passing by pest exterminator with a cockroach on top of his car.\n\nAnd We Find Out That It Is Day 23 AKA Last Day For This Creature\n\nWe see the three girls on the team and one of them is the girlfriend of Scotty who knows that he is upset and knows that he does not want to be bothered right now. The bus gets a flat and the coach, assistant coach, and bus driver take a look to see what caused the flat. They are disturbed to see that it is a shuriken made of bone and having a human tooth attached to it.\n\nScotty says something to another player (DeAundre “Double D” Davis) about how he sucked so bad that he may need to the one to change the tire. Double D has a perfect response.\n\nThe Double D We Know Would Never Do That\n\nOn the radio, they hear about a fire in an old church and the horrors they have founded with people being sewn to the walls and like more than 300 bodies have been found. Yeah, those are all events from the first movie which as you all know is a much better movie than the sequel. The bus driver eventually comes in and turns the radio off so she can call for a mechanic on the dispatch. We go back to the farm as Jack Jr. are looking for clues and come across a knife that looks like it was definitely made by a guy who knows what he is doing. He gives it to his grief stricken dad.\n\nIt somehow gets loose from his grip and destroys the screen of a lamp.\n\nHow Or Why This Happen? Who Knows As It Never Happens Again.\n\nWe then go back to the bus as some players have decided to suntan on top of the roof.\n\nAfter getting no signal and in the middle of nowhere, the bus driver and coaches decide that they can still continue with 5 tires if they go slow. Several players have to pee and the girls nearly get caught smoking cigarettes by Coach Charlie Hanna\n\nWe also find out that a school newspaper writer named Izzy Bohen is rumored to be gay, which gets an awful nickname of “Izzy Or Isn’t He”. He also has scars that some people say was at a gay bar.\n\nIt’s 2003 So Sadly There Was Still Really Strong Bigotry Towards People Who Of That Persuasion.\n\nOh and we also see them treating the equipment manager (the guy in glasses) like shit.\n\nAs Someone Who Was The Equipment Manager For Both The Football And Basketball Team, This Might Shock You To Learn I Was Not Treated Horribly By The Team.\n\nEveryone is made to get back on the bus as they will be traveling slow. One of the players named Kimball “Big K” Ward thinks he sees something weird (it being the wings of the Creeper) and gets scared by a bunch of birds that causes the other players to laugh at him.\n\nThis Guy Was Actually Written To Be Killed, But That Scene Was Never Filmed\n\nWe once again go to the farm as Taggart has decided to repurpose the post puncher into a homemade harpoon gun with special custom harpoons (the custom knife is going to be the sharp point of one of those harpoons) as he plans on hunting for the Creeper.\n\nLater in the night, Scotty and his girlfriend Rhonda Truitt talk about the game and Scotty being only in the game for 12 minutes. We find that Scotty may be a bit of a bigot as far as Double D goes and definitely thinks of himself above the team, blaming his short play time on the Coach Charlie Hanna who he thinks has it in for him, even when Rhonda rightfully tells him that Hanna probably wanted everyone to play since this was the last game of the season.\n\nAlso on the bus, the blonde girl named Minxie Hayes has a dream about two people (Darry Jenner from the first movie and Billy Taggart) warning her about something evil that is out there.\n\nShe also sees something running in the fields.\n\nIt’s The Creeper And He’s Throwing A Shuriken\n\nAnd if right on cue, another tire goes flat and they are definitely not able to go anywhere as a bus can’t move safely with two flat tires.\n\nCoach Hanna puts out flares and tells a passing car to contact authorities so they can get a tow truck to help them get home.\n\nHey, That Is Voice Actor Bob Papenbrook And Largo Woodruff From The Funhouse.\n\nThe One Whose Head Was Cut Up By The Industrial Exhaust Fan After Having It Pushed In There By The Monstrous Gunther\n\nAs Coach Barnes and Betty the bus driver get the kids off the bus, Betty sees another shuriken has taken out this wheel as well.\n\nAnd This One Has A Belly Button\n\nCoach Hanna is putting flares on the road and while Betty and Barnes are talking, he gets taken away by the Creeper, never to be seen again.\n\nThis Is The Best Shot I Can Get You Because It Is Too Blurred For Anyone To See, But That Is What Happened.\n\nThey hear his scream and a flare falls to the ground, which leaves everyone confused. Betty decides that everyone needs to get back on the bus and she will finish with Hanna’s flares. And to no one’s shock, she gets taken too never to be seen again after all the kids gets back on the bus.\n\nNinja Creeper\n\nOne of the kids named Jake Spencer ends up seeing this one and everyone realizes that something is hunting them. Coach Barnes comes in and asks what the hell just happened and all Jake can muster is that she just flew away.\n\nEveryone Giving Him That Look Is Brilliant\n\nThey wonder what is going on, but they get a clearer picture when the Creeper grabs Barnes.\n\nScotty tries to save Barnes, but the creature just takes Barnes away never to be seen again. At this point, all the kids decide that they need to shut the doors and close all the windows. The bigger issue though that there is no more adults to tell them what to do so we kind of have a Lord Of The Flies kind of situation on this bus plus knowingly having an outside threat that can just fly away with their asses and there isn’t much they can do about it.\n\nOh And Scotty Has Coach Barnes’ Blood On His Face\n\nBack at the farm, Taggart is listening in to his police scanner and basically figures out that the creature is somewhere in Kissell County and they are going to head there.\n\nBack on the bus, the equipment manager (named Andy “Bucky” Buck) tries on the dispatch radio to try and contact anyone, but gets no response. Meanwhile, we find out that there is a javelin on the bus. Scotty thinks they should all try and make a run for it to some farm that may be on this road. When he is told by Izzy that is a bad idea, Scotty decides to be a bigot and question Izzy’s sexuality. Double D tries to calm him down and Scotty decides to be an asshole to him and calls him bro. Double D knows by the look on Scotty’s face that he may have wanted to say a different word. Rhonda breaks it up as now it is not the time to be fighting. This all gets stopped when Minxie backs away in horror. They all go to see what she is backing away from and it is The Creeper who is at the bus door looking at them.\n\nAnd Sniffing Like A Creep\n\nHe goes to the windows and sniffs as well.\n\nSomehow Sticking To The Bus Sideways Like A Bug\n\nThe Creeper gets on top of the bus and then creepers up to the back door of the bus.\n\nWho Wants To Give Me The Spider-Man Kiss?\n\nHe smiles at several of them and in probably one of the creepiest moments (especially when you consider who is directing this film) the creature looks at Double D and licks the window.\n\nYeah, Victor Salva Really Should Not Be Directing This Movie.\n\nThe Creeper starts shaking the bus, which scares everyone. It goes back on the roof and Minxie faints.\n\nOh No…..She Has The Vapors\n\nMinxie has another dream where she is at the Taggart farm, seeing the Creeper pretend to be a scarecrow.\n\nOkay….Continuity Issue As He Was Pretending To Be A Scarecrow All The Way To The Left And Now He Is Pretending To Be A Scarecrow In The Center.\n\nDarry also shows up and explains that “Every 23rd Spring, for 23 Days, it gets to eat.”\n\nWhen Minxie asks what it gets to eat, Jarry comes back with no eyes and says “Us”.\n\nMinxie wakes up and explains to everyone else what she saw and basically explains the rules of this creature, also that it can smell fear in people and certain people have a certain fear smell that it likes to eat. It can also tell what parts of people that it wants to eat. Scotty is having issues believing this dream and is as much of an asshole enough to laugh at her dreams. Bucky goes back to calling on the radio for help.\n\nMeanwhile, Taggart and his son come across a car that crashed into a tree and as you might have guessed, it is the car from earlier that Coach Hanna was able to flag down and attempt to tell the authorities about their situation.\n\nSuffice To Say That Never Ended Up Happening As The Creeper Killed Them\n\nThey also end up getting the radio SOS from the bus that Bucky was sending out. Taggart asks where they are calling from and all they can tell them is they are on East 9 in Kinsell County, which is not much help as East 9 is a big street and Kinsell is a big county, but Taggart says they are on their way. Taggart also lies and says he will call the authorities to help them, but he doesn’t do that as he wants to deal with The Creeper on his own.\n\nEveryone on the bus is happy with Bucky’s vigilance in getting them some help, but that doesn’t last long as The Creeper breaks through the roof and grabs Bucky.\n\nThe rest hold on to Bucky to keep him from getting pulled up, but The Creeper’s grip is still strong. Rhonda decides to grab the javelin and stab the creature. The first time it goes through the shoulder, but The Creeper hasn’t let go yet. But the second one goes right through the head and that causes the monster to let Bucky go.\n\nOoooh…..Nasty\n\nAlso instead of pulling the javelin out the long clean way, The Creeper decides to pull this thing out the quicker, but more messy way by pulling it to the side and losing part of his head.\n\nThe Creeper then flies up to the air and dives onto the bus, breaking all the windows from the force.\n\nIzzy looks up through the hole and sees that The Creeper is sorta KOed by the whole dive.\n\nWith the creature out, Scotty thinks they can escape by getting the door open, but the creature’s hard landing basically made both the bus’s main door and its backdoor both jammed so they wont open. They are about to try and break the door when one of its wings falls through a slit in the ceiling.\n\nSeveral players go under the wing and get to the front end of the bus, but Dante Belasco is not so lucky as the “shower curtain” or “toilet paper” like wing wraps him up.\n\nThey try to save Dante, but he gets pulled up and he loses his head.\n\nOne Of The Few Not So Great Effects In This Film\n\nWe then get to see The Creeper rip out its own head and regenerate a new head using Dante’s head.\n\nPretty Cool Scene\n\nWith its new head, The Creeper flies away again. Meanwhile, Scotty is able to get the bus’s main door open. Scotty says that it is time to make a run for it, but some people think that is a bad idea. He also says it is time to stop being polite and wants to separate people who the creature wants to eat from people that the creature doesn’t want to eat. He is specifically thinking of Jake, Bucky, and Double D. Double D is particularly upset by that notion and mentions that he saw that creature want Scotty to so he might need to can it with that kind of talk. Double D does say though that it is time to get off the bus and most get off the bus, except for Jonny.\n\nYeah, This Shithead Is Going To Stay On The Bus And Lock Everyone Else Out For Now.\n\nBecause he won’t let anyone in, they rest all have to run in the fields and hope The Creeper doesn’t get them. The Creeper throws another shuriken and it kills Jake.\n\nIt tries to go after Double D, but he trips on a rock and The Creeper barely misses him. The Creeper then throws a dagger and it pins Scotty’s arm to a tree.\n\nStick Around\n\nSgt. Zim Of Starship Troopers Approves Of This Tactic\n\nIzzy, Double D and Rhonda eventually free Scotty from the tree, but as soon as they free him, The Creeper takes Scotty away, never to be seen again.\n\nSo Scumbag Scotty Is Dead\n\nMinxie runs back onto the road where Taggart and Jake Jr. are also there in their truck. Minxie tries to warn them that it can’t be killed, but Taggart still wants to give it a shot as he shows her his man-made harpoon gun that is mounted to the truck. Meanwhile, Bucky is able to get back on the bus through one of the holes and sees that Jonny let one person in the bus.\n\nHe Let Chelsea Farmer In.\n\nBecause the creature went after Bucky, the two want Bucky out and the Creeper immediately tries to get Bucky again.\n\nBut once again, Bucky gets saved, but this time by Taggart who has arrived with his man made harpoon gun and is looking for revenge.\n\nThe Day Is Mine!!!!\n\nAfter a short stare down, Taggart shoots it with the harpoon\n\nThe Creeper flies up and tries to crash the truck into the bus. Taggart, sensing this, tells his son to turn the truck so they are no longer behind the bus, which he does. The Creeper flies around like a bass caught on a fishing hook and like a fishing rod, Taggart tries to reel him in. The Creeper eventually gets free of the harpoon and throws it back at them, but nobody is hurt.\n\nJack Jr.’s Jacket Is Not So Lucky\n\nJack Jr. has to get out of his jacket just to get behind the steering wheel. They then drive away from the bus and Taggart puts in another new harpoon with reel. The Creeper tries to fly at them and Taggart shoots through the bus, which hits the Creeper on the other side.\n\nThe Creeper is down, but not out. The Creeper then flies up in the air and the truck has to move so it doesn’t get leveled by the falling bus.\n\nThe bus is cut in half because of the metal reel and both father and son have to get out of the truck before it flips.\n\nBoth Double D and Rhonda hear the action, but get told by Izzy that he found a working vehicle and they need to follow him to the vehicle with the big ugly bug on it.\n\nThis Basically Signifies That The Guy In This Car Who Passed The Bus By Way Earlier, Was Also Taken By The Creeper.\n\nIzzy reveals that he knows how to hotwire the vehicle and reveals that is how he got into a fight at the bar because he was trying to steal a car. Double D asks if it was a gay bar and that is never answered. Of course, they don’t need to hotwire the car as the keys are still in the ignition. They see the Creeper flying overhead and Izzy and Rhonda get in the truck through the driver side, but sadly the passenger side door’s handle is broken so Double D can’t get inside the safe area so he has to take his luck in the wide open back of the truck. They drive while The Creeper follow and Double D has to shoot the creature with a flare gun.\n\nThis is only a minor inconvenience as The Creeper tries to catch up with them again, but Izzy has an idea. Izzy makes Rhonda get out of the moving truck.\n\nIzzy then tells Double D to stay down and hold on as he then hits the breaks and the creature flies right throw the two windows.\n\nDouble D is flown right out of the truck as the truck flips."
