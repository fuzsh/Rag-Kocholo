        "text": "While a lot of fans of the Jeepers Creepers franchise are excited about the third installment approaching release, a lot of other genre fans have made it clear that they will not support any film involving the franchise’s writer-director Salva.\n\nFor those of you who know nothing of Salva’s past, let me explain. In 1987 Slava was arrested on eleven counts of sexual abuse of a child. Yeah, he’s a peodophile. In fact, that’s his mugshot (above). He was smiling. His victim, Nathan Forrest Winters, was the young boy who played the role of Casey in Salva’s ’87 film Clownhouse. Reportedly, Winters is not Salva’s only victim.\n\nWinters in Clownhouse\n\nWinters has finally broken his silence about what he and others suffered at the hands of Salva with help from filmmaker Connar Frazier will be making a documentary and using his experiences to raise awareness, educate, and help others who have been through the same horrible crimes.\n\nWinters now\n\nNathan on his project:\n\nHello, this is Nathan Forrest Winters. You may know me from my role as Casey in the 1987 film Clownhouse. I am a sexual abuse survivor. For six years of my childhood I was molested by writer/director Victor Salva, who I starred in two films by. Victor is best known for the ‘Jeepers Creepers’ franchise and Powder.\n\nTowards the end of ’87 he was arrested on eleven counts of sexual abuse on me and others, convicted on four of the less severe. He was sentenced to three years in prison, for which he served a mere eighteen months in a rehabilitation facility in Napa Valley, California. A three-year sentence, eighteen months served, for crimes it took him six years to commit.\n\nI am currently outlining a nationwide speaking tour at various key and pertinent venues to raise awareness, educate, and provide information and tools to stop sexual child abuse at all levels. The entire process will be documented for a film about my story conceived and helmed by my partner, filmmaker Connar Frazier. The film will show my journey from victim to survivor. It is my belief that we as a whole in this country have been too afraid to face such an unspeakable topic and continue to turn a blind eye, which has allowed these predators of our children to go unchecked for too long.\n\nJust a few of many disturbing facts: Every 98 seconds an American is sexually assaulted. Every 8 minutes that victim is a child. Meanwhile, only 6 out of every 1,000 perpetrators is convicted. United victims and survivors, parents and children can make this world safer. Education is prevention, and the more light we shed on this darkest of crimes, the fewer shadows there will be for them to hide.\n\nYou Can Donate To Winters’ GoFundMe Page HERE.\n\nFor decades reports of sexeal abuse in the film industry has been made with little justice for victims. Many stars have confessed to being victimized and raped, like Lady Gaga, Madonna, Gabrielle Union, Corey Feldman, and Corey Haim. Sexual abuse and assault is more common than you realize, not just in Hollywood but everywhere. Statistics say:\n\nA sexual assault happens every 98 seconds in America.\n\nEvery 8 minutes one of those victims is a child.\n\n1 in every 6 women have been the victims of rape or attempted rape.\n\n21% of transgender college students have been sexually assaulted.\n\n1 in 33 men have been sexually assaulted."
