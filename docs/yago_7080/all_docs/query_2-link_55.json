        "text": "A casting call has been yanked and a petition launched in response to a convicted pedophile's move to direct a movie in British Columbia.\n\nThe Union of BC Performers issued a warning to its members earlier this month about Victor Salva, a convicted child molester, and the production of “Jeepers Creepers III.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“A performer has the right to refuse work if they believe the nature of the work is unsafe,” the union’s memo said.\n\n“Given the nature of Mr. Salva’s prior conviction, we ask that agents disclose this information to the parents/guardians of any minor performers who are being put forward for roles on this production.”\n\nSalva was convicted of sexual misconduct involving a 12-year-old boy who played the lead role in the director's 1988 horror film, \"Clownhouse.\"\n\nAccording to Salon, Salva served 15 months of his three-year sentence.\n\n“A performer has the right to refuse work if they believe the nature of the work is unsafe.”\n\nA “Jeepers Creepers III” casting call had advertised for an 18-year-old woman to play the role of 13-year-old girl.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe notice was only recently pulled by Breakdown Services, Deadline reports.\n\nAnd now one B.C. man is calling on Premier Christy Clark to step in.\n\nA petition spearheaded by an Abbotsford man is asking for Salva to be kept out of the country.\n\n“This man should not be granted access to Canada and I am absolutely disgusted that he's coming to B.C.,\" it read. \"Let's try and stop this scum bag!”"
