        "text": "DUNNELLON, Fla., Aug. 30 -- Filming on a motion picture continues outside three Dunnellon, Fla., public schools although school officials have learned the director is a convicted sex offender.\n\nHopes of having students visit the set of \"Jeepers Creepers\" or serve as interns have been dropped since Victor Salva's past came to light.\n\nThe $10 million film is being produced by American Zoetrope, a company owned by famed director Francis Ford Coppola, who is serving as executive producer. Coppola is not expected to visit the set.\n\nSalva was paroled in 1992 after serving 15 months of a three-year sentence for five felony counts based on sexual involvement with a 12-year-old boy in 1988. The boy appeared in a low-budget film he directed. Salva also directed \"Powder,\" \"Nature of the Beast,\" and \"Rites of Passage.\" He has registered with police as a sex offender as required by Florida law.\n\nMarion County school officials were not told about Salva's criminal record when location director Sue Gummerson negotiated payment for use of parts of a street ouside the elementary, middle and high schools.\n\nAlthough the filming is being done largely at night, street closings have required rerouting school buses. An abandoned high school and rural areas will also be used as film locations.\n\n\"We have a drama department and we also have a TV production class,\" Dunnellon High School assistant principal Cynthia Saunders said. \"We were talking about what could we get out of it educationally.\"\n\nOnce she learned of Salva's past, the idea of having students interact with the film crew was abandoned. On-set publicist Joe Hemingway said Salva has paid his debt to society and was focused on making the film. He said they never offered to have students on the set. The filming will take about two months."
