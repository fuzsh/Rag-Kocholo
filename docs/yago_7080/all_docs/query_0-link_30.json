        "text": "Victor Salva, a former child-care worker who impressed Hollywood filmmakers with his early cinematic work, was sentenced to three years in state prison in 1988 for molesting a 12-year-old boy who had acted in two of his films. Salva videotaped one of the encounters.\n\n[...]\n\nThe revelations came as the now 20-year-old victim, Nathan Winters of Concord, Calif., picketed a screening of \"Powder\" on Monday night in Westwood.\n\nWinters passed out leaflets urging the public to boycott the movie and said his family and friends would continue protesting after the film debuts Friday on more than 1,500 screens nationwide.\n\nWinters said he was \"in awe\" that Disney would even make a movie with Salva.\n\n\"I can't believe [Salva] is allowed to work with children again,\" Winters said. \"He should not be allowed around children ever again.\""
