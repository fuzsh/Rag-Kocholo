        "text": "by\n\nTo many people that’s a title writer/director Victor Salva really does deserve. As much as I had a blast with both his JEEPERS CREEPERS creature-features, what I’d later learned about the director during the making of his eerily impressive 1989 debut CLOWNHOUSE beggars belief and turned my stomach! As some may argue though, he’s paid his debt to society and later continued his career against the odds of his dark past. America really does believe in second chances.\n\nWhile Salva’s last film, ROSEWOOD LANE starring flame-haired stunner Rose McGowan, sank with trace, he’s set to replace PET SEMATARY director Mary Lambert on Cat and Mouse Films’ supernatural western PURGATORY. The plot is set in 1893 New Mexico and follows a washed up gunslinging lawman who teams up with an English vampire hunter to stop a clan of evil bloodsuckers from feasting on the inhabitants of an isolated, weapons-free town.\n\nSounds an intriguing premise in the same way as David Slade’s 30 DAYS OF NIGHT. I’ve a feeling if this is a success upon release, expect the studio to stump up the cash for Salva to complete his JEEPERS CREEPERS trilogy, which he finished the script for some time ago.\n\nSource: The Hollywood Reporter\n\nCraig was our great north east correspondent, proving that it’s so ‘grim up north’ that losing yourself in a world of film is a foregone prerequisite. He has been studying the best (and often worst) of both classic and modern cinema at the University of Life for as long as he can remember. Craig’s favorite films include THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, JFK, GOODFELLAS, SCARFACE, and most of John Carpenter’s early work, particularly THE THING and HALLOWEEN.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLatest Posts\n\nRoad to FrightFest: Joanne Mitchell shares all on the creation of ‘Broken Bird’\n\nHaving started in the year 2000, Pigeon Shrine FrightFest is celebrating its 25th anniversary...\n\nBy Kat Hughes\n\n‘Alien: Romulus’ review: Dir.
