        "text": "There's a brand spanking new trailer for \"Final Destination 5\" out and hey did you know Tony Todd's in this one? So that's something, right? And it's in 3D. Tony Todd in 3D. Man this one is going to be awesome. And I didn't think I'd have anything to say about the new trailer. Thank god and baby Jesus for Tony Todd.\n\n\"Jeepers Creepers\" mastermind and official NAMBLA member Victor Salva recently let out that if and when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" happens it'll be the last installment in the series. Please Victor, say it aint so. He did come out and say that 3D probably wouldn't be an option for the film that's had a script for some time now and just can't seem to get off the ground. Let's keep our fingers crossed that things work out for the convicted sex offender.\n\nIf you're holding your breath for a \"Zombieland\" sequel you better have some pretty hefty lungs my friends. In a recent interview Jesse Eisenberg gave an update on the status of the follow up and it looks like other than some form of a script being worked on not too much else has happened. He does go on to say that all the actors are on board but the longer it takes the less interesting the film will be. Then he kicked a puppy and shot a bald eagle.\n\nAnd because it's a slow day here's the trailer for a new Cuban zombie flick cleverly titled \"Juan of the Dead\". As you can expect it's a nod to Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright's \"Shaun of the Dead\". And by nod I mean there's a cigar smoking mental patient in the corner giving himself whiplash he's nodding so hard. Ay caramba.\n\nDespite my undying hatred for Kevin Smith, \"Red State\" actually looks pretty good, and it kills me to say that. Well to keep the ball rolling Mrs. Smith (see what I did there) released a new clip to the fine people at MTV. Because if you want to stay indie, you go to the channel that brought you \"The Grind\".\n\nRosamund Pike, who has a stupid name but was apparently in \"Doom\" so I like her, has been added to the cast of the \"Clash of the Titans\" sequel currently titled \"Wrath of the Titans\". The movie will be bad but it's got the girl with the stupid name who was in \"Doom\" so maybe it'll make me think of The Rock, the wrestler not the movie, and it'll make me happy and I'll like it. That's logic people, logic all over your face.\n\nVictor Salva is the guy responsible for ruining my senior year by making the movie \"Powder\", bald pale white guys aren't all freaks, people! Now he's got a new movie titled \"Rosewood Lane\" that has just cast Rose McGowen. If this one turns out to be about a guy with a mild drinking problem and horrible grammar who sits on NJ transit for 2 hours a day I'm going to think Victor has it out for me.\n\nSuck on that \"Snakes on a Plane\"! David R. Ellis has topped you for best movie name ever. He wants to release his new film under the title \"Untitled 3D Shark Thriller\". Try to guess what the movie is about and what dimension it'll be shown is. I bet you guess right. If you didn't you might want to get that looked at.\n\nSome great remake news today. After going through test screenings in preparation for a remake of the moc-doc \"Paranormal Activity\", Paramount has decided that the film tested so well that there is no need to remake it. The film, which has garnered heavy buzz in the horror community lately, will debut September 25th at Midnight at Fantastic Fest 2009 in Texas.\n\nRyuhei Kitamura (\"Versus\", \"Midnight Meat Train\") is going to be directing an adaptation of one of Stephen Kings \"Nightmares & Dreamscapes\" tales, titled \"Home Delivery\".\n\nVictor Salva says \"Jeepers Creepers 3: Cathedral\" is finally coming together money wise, with Gina Phillips slated to reprise her role as Trish, 23 years later. He also uses the phrase \"you have to keep four or five balls in the air at a time\", which might not be the smartest thing for a man with his past to say. Hey, just pointing out the obvious here.\n\nI have an idea for the most annoying film ever. \"Fight Club\" with werewolves. Oh crap, looks like someone beat me to it."
