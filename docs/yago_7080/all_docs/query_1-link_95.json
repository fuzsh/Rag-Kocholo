        "text": "kinda fucked up how the reason anybody can make an \"amityville\" movie is cuz its nonfiction & a real guy killed his whole family there. anyway dustin ferguson (HORNDOGS BEACH PARTY) just keeps getting better! this has the worst sound mixing ive ever heard in a real (non-worldstar/dash-cam) movie but hes got some fun shit going on here, esp. the first couple scenes which feel almost like alex disanto or something. it falls apart quick tho when he forgets about the clown & having funny/bitchy slasher victims; imo the amityville plot hits a lil harder when its a traditional nuclear family breaking down & not some childless mid-30s thinkgeek couple who seem like the high point of their marriage was finding out samuel…\n\nGoodbye Shark Month, hello Amityville month.\n\nPerhaps even more horrifying and daunting than the stupid CGI shark movie binge I went on last month... and, of course, I had to start with a Ferguson classic here just to make me feel the most hopeless about this.\n\nDustin seems to have tried for approximately 5 entire minutes while making this -- the opening is serviceable enough for a 2017 Amityville Movie (probably #85, who knows, I have no idea how many there are!) but then we are immediately thrust into the pits of microbudget movie hell. Shockingly horrible sound mixing, everyone else has mentioned this but until you experience it for yourself you won't understand. Constant scenes where dialogue is inaudible…\n\nIt is HorrorPack time again and I did get the new boxes in time to watch one of the movies from them. This one is from the DVD box. Apparently, it is the sequel to another low-budget Amityville film from the same director that I haven't watched yet, which I didn't know until after I watched this one. That ended up being fine though, I wasn't struggling to understand the plot for this one even though it is a sequel. The story has to do with a couple who buys one of those toy monkeys with the cymbals After buying it, the husband starts to get rather violent and the wife finds out that the monkey was bought at an…\n\nApparently we all loved Amityville Toybox so much, they had no choice but to make a sequel!\n\nOh boy, boy, oh my, oh damn, holy moly... I'm honestly speechless, I can not believe what I have just witnessed. No wonder only 4 actors are credited, who would want to be associated with this?\n\nI'm not at all exaggerating, I really don't understand what happened. I kid you not, the first 10 minutes of this are actually pretty good. The first 10 minutes almost look like a real movie, the first 10 minutes sound like a real movie, the first 10 minutes have gore (not the best looking gore, but there was some creative stuff happening). And then we just switch…"
