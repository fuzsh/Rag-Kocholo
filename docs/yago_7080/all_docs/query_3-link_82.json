        "text": "For those of you who don’t already know, there’s actually a pretty dark story behind the Jeepers Creepers franchise. Director Victor Salva was convicted of molesting a child back in 1988, and filming the incident. Most people didn’t know about it when the first film came out, though in the age of the internet, it’s now out for everyone to see. Naturally, when the director returned for Jeepers Creepers 3, his past has resurfaced.\n\nJonathan Breck, the actor who has played The Creeper in every movie, spoke with IGN recently, saying that people should give the director a second chance:\n\n“Obviously it’s a very serious issue. But I can truthfully say the very first time I met Victor it was 2000 and the Internet wasn’t what it is today. I didn’t even know anything about his background when I met him. I had the advantage of just getting to know him for who he was, how he treated me, what kind of artist he was. I got to know him through my own personal experience with the guy. It’s one off the best creative experiences I’ve ever had working on these films, a real highlight of my career. I just think it’s a shame because in this day and age, the Internet being what the Internet is, it’s been great in a lot of respects and in some respects it’s really cheated us. We can sit in our office or sit in a room and type somebody’s name and read something about somebody and judge them in ten seconds and think we know them.”\n\nHe added:\n\n“The truth is, Victor’s not the same guy he was 33 years ago. He’s just not. Most people aren’t. I believe people deserve second chances. It was a horrible thing that happened and a horrible mistake that Victor made and nothing can change that. But I know who the guy is today and he’s not the same person and I’d like to see him have a second chance. But then there are those who feel like he should just crawl in a hole and bring the dirt in on top of him, that he should haven’t the chance to make a living and he should just go away and never been seen or heard from again. And that’s certainly their right to feel that way. Working for him has been one of the biggest privileges of my career. I can say that with a hundred percent confidence. There is redemption in all of us.”\n\nThese comments will undoubtedly cause some controversy, and there’s nothing really more I can add to it. Decipher them how you see fit.\n\nJeepers Creepers 3 is currently available to stream."
