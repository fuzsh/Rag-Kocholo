Victor Salva

Victor Ronald Salva (born March 29, 1958) is an American film director, screenwriter, and convicted sex offender. The self-described protégé of Francis Ford Coppola, he is best known for writing and directing the horror films Jeepers Creepers (2001), Jeepers Creepers 2 (2003), and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017). Salva's career has been controversial due to his 1988 conviction for sexually abusing Nathan Forrest Winters, the 12-year-old star of his debut feature film Clownhouse (1989), during its production; he also videotaped one of the encounters and was found to possess child pornography, though this was not publicized until 2006 .
