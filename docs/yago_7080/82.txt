âClownhouseâ (1989) was a slasher film directed by Victor Salva as his feature-length directorial debut. In the film, just before Halloween, three young brothers alone in a big house are menaced by three escaped mental patients who have murdered some traveling circus clowns and taken up their identities. The true horror, however, was behind the scenes as in 1988, Victor Salva was convicted of sexually abusing the lead actor, Nathan Forrest Winters, this generated enough controversy that the film would never be re-released following its initial theatrical run and home media release in 1990. There was a DVD release in 2003 as a promotional tie-in to Victor Salvaâs other then-upcoming horror directed sequel, âJeepers Creepers 2â, but online outcry led to it being pulled from sale after a brief period, with the sold copies becoming collectorâs items.
