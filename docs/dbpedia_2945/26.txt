“

Death at a Funeral

” does not exactly arrive DOA, especially with a pedigree that includes a

2007 British farce

which legitimately funny

Chris Rock

loved and had the clout to remake and star in just three years later.

Still, there's much to roll your eyes about in this all-star comedy, including an absolutely disgusting bathroom scene featuring Danny Glover as the miserable Uncle Russell and the built-for-laughs Tracy Morgan as cousin Norman. There's also some tepid male nudity (from James Marsden and even Glover, again), both due to accidentally taking hallucinogenic drugs.

Unless you’re the proverbial dirty old man, creepy insinuations by lecherous

Martin Lawrence

toward a just-turned-18 friend of the family won’t raise anyone’s laugh quotient, either.

The film’s sad brood is led by brothers played by Rock, the straight and stable one, and Lawrence, the somehow successful one, grieving with Mom (the too, too frenetic Loretta Devine) over the death of their well-respected father and husband.

Apparently all loved the dearly departed, including a mysterious guest (Peter Dinklage, who played the same role in the original) who surprisingly becomes more the brunt of gay-sex jokes than easy-target little people gags. Regardless, the evil-minded Dinklage persona does just about steal the movie from everyone else’s, including an uncle played by Ron Glass (from TV’s “Barney Miller”) and his along-for-the ride adult kids (likable Columbus Short and sexy Zoe Saldana).

The laugh-inducing Marsden portrays the fiancée of the latter, but an intrusive and ever-smug Luke Wilson is also pursuing her. Naturally, he seems ready to offer up one of his omnipresent AT&T commercials at any second.

Rock does interact nicely with wife Regina Hall ("Law Abiding Citizen"), whose anxiety to get pregnant easily produces the film's funniest line. Otherwise, "Death" doesn't really deliver.
