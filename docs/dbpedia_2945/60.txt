Ron Glass, known for his roles on the television shows Barney Miller and Firefly, died late Friday of respiratory failure, a rep for the actor confirmed to EW. He was 71.

Glass’ first role was on All in the Family in the 1970s, but he was perhaps best known for playing Ron Harris, the NYPD detective and aspiring author from the Emmy-winning ABC sitcom Barney Miller. He earned an Emmy nomination in 1982 for Outstanding Supporting Actor for the part. Glass also portrayed Shepherd Book on the cult sci-fi series Firefly and its big-screen follow-up, Serenity.

He also appeared in the American remake of Death at a Funeral, Lakeview Terrace, and TV shows including Hawaii Five-0, Sanford and Son, and Friends. More recently, Glass appeared as Dr. Streiten on Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Paul Lomax on C.S.I.: Crime Scene Investigation.

In addition to his long list of TV and movie appearances, Glass performed voiceover for shows including Rugrats (Susie Carmichael’s dad, Randy), Aladdin (for one episode as Kwanseer), and The Proud Family (the talking baby).

Glass’ Firefly costar Alan Tudyk tweeted, “Ron Glass was one of the greatest actors to work with. His laugh was beyond infectious and his generosity was ever present.” He added that Glass was “a sassy smart a– and I prize that very much. A leaf on the wind.”

Nathan Fillion and Sean Maher, two others from the Firefly cast, also tweeted in honor of Glass. “What an honor it was to know you, to work beside you and to have called you my friend. You will be missed. I love you sir,” Maher wrote, while Fillion recalled a moment from their series (“Don’t go far”).

Glass’ family has released no further details at this time.
