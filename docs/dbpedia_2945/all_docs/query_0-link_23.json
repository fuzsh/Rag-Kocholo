        "text": "Aaron opens the coffin -- and it's the wrong body.\n\nNot good, obviously, but it's a relatively simple problem to fix, a simple matter of physical exchange. Aaron's (Chris Rock) other issues are much more difficult, if not impossible, to solve: Writing and delivering the proper eulogy for his father. Getting his ovulating wife Michelle (Regina Hall) pregnant. Finishing his long-in-gestation novel. Overcoming his rivalry with brother Ryan (Martin Lawrence), a bestselling novelist.\n\n\"My father's dead! Put your panties on!\" an exasperated Aaron urges his wife.\n\nIn \"Death at a Funeral,\" Aaron is at the eye of a storm before families and friends arrive to mourn his father's passing. His cousin Elaine (Zoe Saldana) has accidentally fed psychedelic drugs to her fiance Oscar (James Marsden). Norman (Tracy Morgan) is a family friend assigned to take care of Uncle Russell (Danny Glover), the type of crotchety old man who disregards social convention and says whatever is on his mind.\n\nDerek (Luke Wilson), Elaine's ex-boyfriend, wants her back, at the urging of her disapproving father Duncan (Ron Glass). Her brother Jeff (Columbus Short), a pharmacology student, provided the pills that have Oscar running amok, all but flapping his arms and quacking like a duck. Unsurprisingly, recent widow Cynthia (Loretta Devine) is very fragile.\n\nAs if this mess of familial dysfunction wasn't enough, Frank (Peter Dinklage) peers into the frame. He carries a secret. He corners Aaron and presents a heretofore unseen truth. Not just an assertion -- Frank has proof. And the film becomes a variation on the Biblical passage about the sins of the father.\n\nA remake of the 2007 British comedy of the same name (why remake it? One word: accents), \"Death at a Funeral\" almost has something interesting to say about the complexity of human relationships, specifically when the awareness of death hovers close. But such commentary is compromised by director Neil LaBute's emphasizing slapstick instead of suggestiveness, and the script's deployment of bad-taste gallows humor, which only occasionally works.\n\nI'd like to say Aaron learns that the body is just a vessel, that the mind and soul of the deceased lingers long after burial or cremation. However, that's reading too much into the film, which never really engages our emotions or funny bones until after a grim, clever third-act twist. The cast is game and talented, and Dean Craig's screenplay (he also wrote the original) is on the verge of saying something poignant about extended-family relationships. But go figure -- gross-out poop jokes and upended coffins tend to distract one from uncovering any subtext."
