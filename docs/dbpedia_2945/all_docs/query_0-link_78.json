        "text": "01 of 130\n\nCarrie Fisher\n\nActress Carrie Fisher died Dec. 27 after suffering a heart attack on a flight days before. She was 60. Fisher, the daughter of Debbie Reynolds (who died the day after Fisher at age 84) and Eddie Fisher, was most known for playing Princess Leia in the Star Wars films, and recently chronicled her experience filming those movies in the 2016 memoir The Princess Diarist. She returned to the franchise in 2015 for a cameo in The Force Awakens. Aside from acting, Fisher was also heralded for being candid about her mental health: She openly discussed her struggles with substance abuse and bipolar disorder in multiple interviews and in her books, including 2011's Shockaholic, where she wrote about her experience with electroconvulsive therapy. She's survived by daughter Billie Lourd, an actress best known for her role on Scream Queens.\n\n02 of 130\n\nDebbie Reynolds\n\nScreen and stage legend Debbie Reynolds died Dec. 28 at age 84 after a possible stroke, just one day after her daughter Carrie Fisher died at age 60. \"She wanted to be with Carrie,\" Reynolds' son Todd Fisher told Variety. Spanning nearly seven decades, Reynolds' career dates back to the Golden Age of Hollywood, when she signed with Warner Bros. at 16 and went on to star in Singin' in the Rain (1952). The American sweetheart's personal life drew as much press as her career; in 1959, her marriage to Eddie Fisher crumbled when the pop singer left Reynolds for close friend Elizabeth Taylor. Reynolds later revealed she reconciled with Taylor when the icons found themselves on the same cruise before Taylor's death in 2011. A singer with a No. 1 Billboard hit under her belt (\"Tammy\" from her 1957 movie Tammy and the Bachelor), Reynolds was also known for her energetic live shows in Las Vegas. Throughout her multi-faceted career, Reynolds collected Hollywood memorabilia, including Marilyn Monroe's white subway dress from The Seven-Year Itch, which she sold for $5.6 million in a 2011 auction.\n\n03 of 130\n\nGeorge Michael\n\nSinger-songwriter George Michael was found dead on Dec. 25 at his home in England. He was 53. As one-half of musical duo Wham! with bandmate Andrew Ridgeley, Michael catapulted up the music charts and into the hearts of teenagers in the early 1980s with hits like \"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\" and his shaggy hair and tight jeans. Bit by the solo bug, Michael traded bubblegum pop for risqué fare in 1987, declaring \"I don't need no bible\" in \"I Want Your Sex,\" the first single from his first solo album, Faith, which also spawned the rockabilly-soul hit of the same name. The singer's art was overshadowed by his personal life in 1998 when Michael came out as gay following an arrest for lewd behavior. He went on to release new music — his 2004 album Patience was partly inspired by his relationship with former long-time partner Kenny Goss — and triumphantly belt his anthem \"Freedom! '90\" at the London 2012 Olympic Games closing ceremony. Michael largely remained out of the spotlight following his Symphonica tour in 2012.\n\n04 of 130\n\nRicky Harris\n\nEverybody Hates Chris actor Ricky Harris died Dec. 26. He was 54.
