        "text": "'DATE NIGHT'\n\nSteve Carell? Tina Fey? Comedy film? A combination of those three elements should be like the planets aligned and culminated in some cosmic event of hilarity, but instead we get 'Date Night,' which is ... well, it's fine, but not the best anyone involved could do, I'm sure. Carell and Fey play a married couple with kids who live in the suburbs and fear their marriage has entered a rut and so on and so on — you know, the usual drill. After a spontaneous date night and trip to a trendy Manhattan restaurant, the two are mistaken for another couple by two dirty cops (Common and Jimmi Simpson) who believe they are in possession of some incriminating evidence. After a failed attempt to murder them, the couple go on the run to figure out why they're being attacked and to clear their names. Mark Wahlberg, William Fichtner and Ray Liotta co-star as figures involved in the intrigue, which is inspired at times, kind of dull at others, but pretty consistently funny for what it is, if you're not expecting anything. Fans of '30 Rock' and 'The Office' know to expect better, though. $29.98 DVD, $39.99 Blu-ray.\n\n'DEATH AT A FUNERAL'\n\nSomething about this remake of 'Death at a Funeral' clicked with me more than the stodgy, British 2007 original, which I never found quite as funny as everyone else did. For one, this version has a more appealing cast, which goes a long way in making everything seem a lot funnier. Martin Lawrence and Chris Rock play two brothers who come together upon the death of their father, the former a big-shot writer, and the latter a failed writer stuck in the shadow of his sibling and forced to pay the bulk of the bills for the funeral. Of course, everything that could go wrong does at the funeral: First, the undertaker (Kevin Hart) brings the wrong body; then cousin Elaine (Zoe Saldana) shows up with her boyfriend (James Marsden) who has accidentally been dosed with a hallucinogenic drug; then Elaine's annoying ex-boyfriend (Luke Wilson) shows up, as does a cranky uncle (Danny Glover) and a little person (Peter Dinklage) who threatens to reveal a big secret about their father. It's a funny, madcap comedy that makes good use of its ensemble, which also includes Ron Glass, Tracy Morgan, Loretta Devine, Regina Hall and Keith David, all of whom have moments to be funny and come through. The film was directed by Neil LaBute, who cut his teeth with lacerating independent dramas, so it's odd that such a broad — though effective — comedy came from him. A bit of trivia: Dinklage played the same role in the original film. $28.95 DVD, $34.95 Blu-ray.\n\n'THE JONESES'\n\n'The Joneses' has an interesting premise, but the execution leaves something to be desired. That's not to say this social satire is a bad film — it's not — but that it pulls its punches when it should be getting angrier and angrier as it goes on. Demi Moore and David Duchovny play what seems like the ideal couple — the Joneses of the title — with two teenage children (Amber Heard and Ben Hollingsworth) and a new house full of stuff that their neighbors envy. Of course not all is what it seems, as it turns out the Joneses are a family unit designed and packaged with the purpose of selling new merchandise, all four employed to show off goods to assorted neighbors and townspeople by just being the nicest, most perfect people on the block. Naturally this so-called family unravels as Mr. Jones comes to fall in love with his fake wife, and their children go through their own individual crises. As the neighbors fall over themselves trying to keep up with — well, you know — it seems like the film is headed for sharper, more incisive commentary, but it dulls down as it heads to the ending, becoming sentimental and preachy in a way that feels more like a sermon than a satire. And it's a shame, too, because this seems like ripe material, no? Also starring Gary Cole, Glenne Headly and Lauren Hutton. $22.98 DVD, $29.99 Blu-ray.\n\nn"
