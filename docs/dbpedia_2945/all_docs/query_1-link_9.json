        "text": "Friends remains one of the biggest TV shows of the 90s and early aughts. The show was one of the most popular for a decade, with performers like Jennifer Aniston, Matt LeBlanc, Courteney Cox, David Schwimmer, and more going on to become major stars. Friends continues to be discovered by new generations through re-runs and syndication. The main cast even reunited for an HBO special in May 2021.\n\nAs it’s been nearly 20 years since Friends came to an end, some of the actors who were featured on the show have passed away. Matthew Perry’s tragic death at age 54 on October 28 shook fans, as he starred as one of the core characters Chandler Bing. Hollywood has lost other memorable characters, such as Ron Leibman as Rachel’s father, and A-listers who made guest appearances such as Robin Williams have died in the years since the show ended. Look back on some of the stars who have died here.\n\nMatthew Perry\n\nChandler was a favorite character on the sitcom, and the role even earned Perry an Emmy nomination in 2002. He delighted fans and added an unmatched level of comedy to every episode. Perry himself knew he was the right man for the role.\n\n“It was as if someone had followed me around for a year, stealing my jokes, copying my mannerisms, photocopying my world-weary yet witty view of life,” he wrote in his 2022 memoir, Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing. “It wasn’t that I thought I could play ‘Chandler’; I was Chandler.”\n\nPerry was found dead in a jacuzzi at his Los Angeles home on October 28, TMZ reported. Law enforcement sources believe the actor drowned. He was 54.\n\nPaxton White\n\nOn the sitcom Friends, he played Mr. Waltham, the Bloomingdale’s boss of Jennifer Aniston’s character Rachel Green; in Hollywood, Paxton Whitehead was beloved as a prolific actor who was on every hit show of the 90’s, including The West Wing, Desperate Housewives, Mad About You, and Frasier. Sadly, the TV veteran and Tony-nominated star died on June 16 at the age of 85.\n\n“Paxton was loved and respected by his family and everyone who knew him,” Whitehead’s rep Robert Attermann confirmed to USA TODAY in an emailed statement.\n\nRon Leibman\n\nRon Leibman only appeared in four episodes of Friends, but he’s undeniably memorable to fans who have seen every single episode. He was Rachel’s overbearing father Dr. Leonard Green. He made his debut in season 2’s “The One With Two Parties” and made his final appearance in season 10’s “The One Where Joey Speaks French.”\n\nAside from his role on Friends, Ron was a celebrated actor appearing in a variety of roles through his lengthy career. He won a Primetime Emmy for his performance in the series Kaz in 1979, and he earned a Tony for playing Roy Cohn in Angels In America in 1993. Some of his other major roles included Dr. Lior Pepler in The Sopranos and Dr. Cohen in Garden State. Ron died following difficulties with pneumonia in 2019. He was 82.\n\nJames Michael Tyler\n\nJames Michael Tyler is one of the most recognizable characters from Friends as the lovelorn barista Gunther. While not one of the main six, he appeared in 148 episodes of the series. After the show ended, he kept the spirit alive, appearing at Central Perk pop-ups and even making a cameo alongside Matthew Perry on Episodes. While he appeared in a few other shows and movies, Friends remains his best-known role.\n\nJames was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2018. He first revealed his diagnosis in June 2021. He said he wanted to help others with his remaining time in a Today interview. “My goal this past year was to see my 59th birthday. My goal now is to help save at least one life,” he said. He died following his battle with the disease at 59 in October 2021. “The world knew him as Gunther (the seventh “Friend”), from the hit series Friends, but Michael’s loved ones knew him as an actor, musician, cancer-awareness advocate, and loving husband,” his family said in a statement.\n\nRobin Williams\n\nWhile beloved for his comedy and many memorable movie roles (Dead Poet Society, Good Will Hunting, just to name a few) Robin Williams was one of the biggest stars to make a cameo appearance on Friends. He appeared as Tomas alongside fellow comedian Billy Crystal in the season 3 episode “The One With The Ultimate Fighting Champion.” Tomas discovered that another man was sleeping with his wife, who turned out to be Tim (played by Billy) and the two men stormed out of Central Perk.\n\nRobin died by asphyxia by hanging in August 2014. After his passing, an autopsy on his brain revealed that he’d had Lewy Body dementia. He was also diagnosed with a form of Parkinson’s.\n\nFred Williard\n\nFred Williard had a small cameo in the season two episode “The One After The Super Bowl: Part 1” as Dean Lipson. Known for a bunch of different characters, including appearances in This Is Spinal Tap, Best in Show, and the Anchorman films, Fred’s Friends character was an admin at the San Diego Zoo who delivers some (false) bad news to Ross that a monkey has died.\n\nFred died in May 2020 at the age of 86. He’d gone into cardiac arrest after struggling with both myelodysplastic syndrome and coronary artery disease.\n\nCharlton Heston\n\nWhile many stars played characters on Friends, a few actors did make appearances as themselves throughout the show, and Charlton Heston is one of them. Charlton is an Academy Award-winning star, who appeared in tons of classic movies, like Ben-Hur and Touch of Evil. It’s fitting that in his appearance in the season 4 episode “The One With Joey’s Dirty Day,” he and Joey are supposed to appear in a movie together, and Joey uses the actor’s dressing room shower.\n\nLater in his life, Charlton was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. He died in April 2008 at 84 years old. It was later revealed that he was battling pneumonia when he passed away.\n\nGary Collins\n\nGary Collins was another actor to appear as himself in the season 5 episode “The One Where Phoebe Hates PBS.” He appears as himself hosting a fictional telethon pledge drive, which Joey is working the phone bank for. The role was fitting for Gary. As an actor, he had numerous daytime roles and even won a Daytime Emmy award. While some of his biggest roles were Night Gallery or the series The Sixth Sense, he appeared in tons of other TV programs, like Charlie’s Angels, The Love Boat, and many more. He also hosted numerous shows.\n\nHe died in October 2012 at age 74 from natural causes.\n\nRon Glass\n\nRon Glass appeared in two episodes of Friends as Ross’ divorce lawyer Russell. Other than his cameo in Friends, Ron was known for his role as Shepherd Derrial Book on the cult classic series Firefly and the film Serenity. He also played Det. Ron Harris in Barney Miller.

The disease was in remission until 2019, when he died following complications at 75.\n\nConchata Ferrell\n\nConchata Ferrell was a small but memorable role during the season six episode “The One With Joey’s Porsche.” She played the judge who denied Ross and Rachel an annulment. She was most well-known as the character Berta on the sitcom Two and a Half Men, a role that earned her a Primetime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.

She died after going into cardiac arrest in October 2020 at the age of 77.\n\nTaylor Negron\n\nTaylor Negron was another one-off appearance as Allesandro, who owned a restaurant named after him.
