        "text": "“The Losers”\n\n** 1/2 stars (out of 4)\n\nIn this zipping, volatile, silly comic-book ride, a team is betrayed. No, not the A Team, but a handsome crew of CIA operatives headed by Clay (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). On the Blow Stuff Up meter the movie rates an 8. But there’s wet-towel snap to some of the dialogue. And Chris Evans nearly steals the show as the newest IT guy, as in info technologies. Jason Patric has smarmy fun as dapper and despicable nemesis Max. Zoë Saldana, Idris Elba, Columbus Short and Oscar Jaenada.PG-13. 1 hour, 48 minutes. Lisa Kennedy\n\n“Death at a Funeral”\n\n** 1/2 stars (out of 4)\n\nColumbus Short, Ron Glass, Tracy Morgan, Danny Glover, Chris Rock and Martin Lawrence in a remake of the 2007 movie. Rock and Lawrence are brothers whose father has passed away. They do not know much about their father’s down-low life and are shocked by the blackmail photos a mystery person brings to the funeral.R. 1 hour, 30 minutes. Michael Phillips, Tribune Newspapers\n\n“Vincere”\n\n*** stars (out of 4)\n\nOne of the more surprising things about watching the wrenching “Vincere,” the story of Ida Dalser, Mussolini’s secret wife and his first-born son, Benito, is that when the relationship went sour that Il Duce just didn’t have her killed. Ida’s life became a torturous hell spent locked away in an insane asylum.Not rated. 2 hours, 8 minutes. Betsy Sharkey, Los Angeles Times\n\nMore Releases\n\nAvailable today\n\nClone Hunter\n\nCrumb\n\nThe Diplomat\n\nThe Good Heart\n\nHelen\n\nThe Joneses\n\nJust Say Love\n\nLetters to God\n\nLooney Tunes Super Stars: Bugs Bunny Hare Extraordinaire\n\nLooney Tunes Super Stars: Daffy Duck Frustrated Fowl\n\nLouie Bluie\n\nManuela & Manuel\n\nMax Headroom: The Complete Series\n\nMy Name Is Khan\n\nNumb3rs: The Sixth Season\n\nSay Goodnight\n\nTapped\n\nTrauma: Season 1\n\nTriage onvideo.org"
