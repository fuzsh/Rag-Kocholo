        "text": "Emmy-nominated TV actor Ron Glass has died, aged 71.\n\nThe actor, who starred in countless television shows throughout his career – including Friends, Star Trek and CSI – is said to have passed away peacefully in his LA home on Friday (November 25).\n\nNo further details have been made available at this time.\n\nGlass was well known for his role of Shepherd Book in Joss Whedon's Firefly and movie seuqel Serenity, and he has also starred in Rhythm & Blues, Mr. Rhodes and Teen Angel, as well as guest appearances on All in the Family, Sanford and Son, The Streets of San Francisco, Amen and Friends.\n\nIn recent years, he appeared in episodes of Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Major Crimes.\n\nIn 1975, Glass had his breakout role in \"Barney Miller,\" set in an NYPD station.\n\nHis character was obsessed with launching his career as a writer. This role earned Glass a Primetime Emmy nomination in 1982 in the best supporting actor category.\n\nMany of his former co-stars and friends paid tribute to the actor last night, led by Joss Whedon himself who shared a video clip of the actor.\n\n\"He got there with grace, humor & enormous heart,\" Joss wrote. \"He was, among so many other things, my Shepherd. Raise, appropriately, a glass. Rest, Ron.\"\n\nA friend of Glass, Star Saulter, wrote a heartwarming message on Facebook, which began: \"My Buddhist Brother and Friend, Ron Glass passed last night.\n\n\"I had called him 11/15/16 to find out how is doing since it's been a few months since I had see him last and his nurse said he was not up to talking.\n\nI called back on 11/16/16 and said to the nurse: 'let him know that I love him and really care, if you find me annoying, I just missed seeing him. The man that look so good as he age's'.\"\n\nHe ended the heartwarming post by saying: \"With Ron and I, he has always been very congenial with me. I will miss his voice, smile, kindness; but most of all his good looks. On to the next journey my \"Silver Fox\"!\""
