        "text": "Ron Glass, an Emmy-nominated actor best known for his roles on Barney Miller and Firefly, died on Friday, November 25, according to multiple reports. He was 71.\n\nThe late TV star’s rep confirmed the news to TMZ, saying, “Ron passed late last night of respiratory failure. Ron was a private, gentle and caring man. He was an absolute delight to watch on screen. Words cannot adequately express my sorrow.”\n\nBorn in 1945 in Evansville, Indiana, Glass made his television debut in the early 1970s with guest appearances on All in the Family, Sanford and Son and Hawaii Five-O, among others.\n\nIn 1975 the actor landed the part of Detective Ron Harris on the ABC sitcom Barney Miller. The role earned him a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy or Variety or Music Series in 1982, but the prize went to Taxi‘s Christopher Lloyd.\n\nAfter Barney Miller, which ended in May 1982, Glass costarred alongside Demond Wilson in the short-lived Odd Couple remake The New Odd Couple. He also made appearances on The Twilight Zone, Star Trek: Voyager and Family Matters. In the ’90s and ’00s, Glass voiced Randy Carmichael on Nickelodeon’s Rugrats and All Grown Up!\n\nIn 2002, Glass joined the short-lived Fox sci-fi drama Firefly as series regular Shepherd Derrial Book. He later reprised the fan-favorite role in the 2005 film Serenity.\n\nAs the news of Glass’ death broke, several of his former costars took to social media to pay tribute. Samuel L. Jackson, who worked with Glass on 2008’s Lakeview Terrace, tweeted: “It was an Honor & a Pleasure to work with the Amazing Ron Glass! RIP, Sir!”\n\nFirefly alum Jewel Staite added: “Ron Glass was one of the greatest actors to work with. His laugh was beyond infectious and his generosity was ever present.”"
