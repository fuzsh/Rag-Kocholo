        "text": "The only realistic thing here is the funeral because this cadaver arrived at the multiplex already in an advanced state of rigor mortis on the edge of putrefaction. [Full review in Spanish]\n\nOctober 26, 2022\n\nMost likely to satisfy those unfamiliar with the vastly superior 2006 original and/or those who simply embrace all things Chris Rock or Martin Lawrence.\n\nSeptember 5, 2020\n\nThe result is as uneven as the original, albeit in different places:the drug stuff is hilarious; the toilet humour just yucky.\n\nApril 6, 2021\n\nIt's not a great movie, but far exceeds expectation and remains very true to the original film but with a clever African-American slant (which may actually make it even funnier).\n\nSeptember 11, 2017\n\nIt remains a mystery to me how a street-smart, wise-cracking comic of Chris Rock's pedigree failed to see the laughter limitations of this remake of Frank Oz's British film, which was equally uninspiring.\n\nAugust 22, 2017\n\nWhile it isn't a shot-for-shot replica, certainly no one can accuse Hollywood of dumbing things down here.\n\nAugust 15, 2017\n\nWhat we end up with here is the most pointless remake since Gus Van Sant made his shot-for-shot remake of \"Psycho\" back in 1998.\n\nJune 22, 2017\n\nA funny film, but it's not one that I found myself growing passionate about as I watched.\n\nJune 22, 2017\n\nIf the film is so close to the original as to also be pretty much disposable once its over, at least it as well serves up a healthy amount of laughs during its very brief and brisk run time.\n\nJune 22, 2017"
