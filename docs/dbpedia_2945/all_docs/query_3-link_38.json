        "text": "Ron Glass, the TV actor known for playing Ron Harris in the sitcom “Barney Miller” and Shepherd Derrial Book in TV’s “Firefly” and its movie sequel, “Serenity,” has died. He was 71.\n\nThe actor’s rep confirmed the death to Variety, but had no further details regarding the cause or location.\n\nGlass was born in Evansville, Ind., and went on to study drama and literature at the University of Evansville. He began his career in Hollywood in episodes of “Sanford and Son,” “Hawaii Five-O” and “All in the Family” in the early ’70s.\n\nIn 1975, Glass found his breakout role in “Barney Miller,” set in an NYPD station. His character was a dapper and ambitious intellectual, obsessed with launching his career as a writer. The role earned Glass a Primetime Emmy nomination in 1982 in the supporting actor category."
