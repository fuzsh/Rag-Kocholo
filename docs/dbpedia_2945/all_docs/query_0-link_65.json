        "text": "In 2002, the short-lived sci-fi series “Firefly” made its entrance on the television landscape. However, given the lethal combo of being labeled a “western in space” and premiering on the Friday night death slot, “Firefly” only aired 11 of its 14 original episodes before it was cancelled. There were other adverse factors such as the broadcast network aired the series out of order which resulted in the pilot being aired last and the show was frequently preempted for sports events — all of which confused viewers and was guaranteed to kill even the best of television shows. “Firefly” was thus doomed from the start with all those factors against it. But then a miraculous thing happened.\n\nAfter the show was canceled, it rose from the ashes. While the series did not return to the television airwaves, it did return as movie “Serenity” which nicely wrapped up the series. It also became one of the best selling television DVD sets of all time. The show may have been undiscovered during the brief few months it was on, but its legacy continues to grow. New fans are introduced to “Firefly” each year and each is grateful to have fallen under its spell, while simultaneously disappointed that the 13 episodes and the movie is all that was produced.\n\nIn the 8 years since “Firefly’s” cancellation, the cast of this extraordinary series has continued to pop up all across the television landscape endearing them even more to their devoted fans that have followed them.\n\nNathan Fillion, who played Captain Malcolm Reynolds, went on to play one of the more notorious villains on Joss Weldon’s other cult favorite, “Buffy, the Vampire Slayer.” He then moved quickly on to work with Alicia Silverstone in “Miss Match,” with a brief detour to appear in the “Firefly” sequel, “Serenity,” and continued to win over fans of all genres by appearing in the horror comedy “Slither.” Nathan then ricocheted between film and television to appear in “Lost” with Evangeline Lily, “White Noise 2” with Katee Sackoff, “Waitress” with Keri Russell,” and the short-lived television series “Drive” with Amy Acker. He also did a guest arc in “Desperate Housewives” reunited him with his “Pasadena” co-star Dana Delany. One of his more eye-catching and fan-favorite roles was playing Captain Hammer in another Joss Whedon creation, “Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog” along side Felicia Day and Neil Patrick Harris. Nathan has never been one sit still in one genre very long and now appears in the drama television series “Castle” which allows him to showcase his natural charms and his heart of gold.\n\nMorena Baccarin, who played professional companion Inara Serra and Mal’s star-crossed love interest may have been an unknown when she debuted on “Firefly,” but in the intervening years, she has made appearances in “The O.C.,” “Heartland,” “Kitchen Confidential,” “How I Met Your Mother,” “Stargate SG-1,” “Dirt,” “Numbers,” and “Medium.” But by far, Morena is best known today as the diabolical Anna, leader of the Visitors in the ABC alien-invasion series “V.” [NOTE: As of Fall 2011, Morena is appeaing in the Showtime series “Homeland”]\n\nAdam Baldwin, who played hired-gun Jayne Cobb, kept busy working on just about every kind of film and television project he could, which included Joss Whedon’s “Angel,” Tim Minear’s “The Inside” and co-starring with Morena Baccarin in “Sands of Oblivion.” He also did work on the children’s series “Justice League” and “Jackie Chan’s Adventures” — managing to do 48 episodes while simultaneously guest starring on “Bones,” working on the short-lived series “Daybreak,” and has for the past 3 season appeared as Major John Casey in the spy dramedy “Chuck.” [NOTE: “Chuck” concluded its 5-year run in January 2012.]\n\nSummer Glau, who played the haunted River Tam, has also maintained a strong presence in a variety of television roles appearing briefly in “Cold Case” and “CSI” before doing an extended arc on “The Unit.” She then quickly moved on to appear as Tess Doerner in “The 4400” and scored a major role in the sci-fi series “Terminator: Sarah Connor Chronicles” as a kick-ass terminator replicant. She also made an indelible impression appearing in Joss Whedon’s “Dollhouse” as the demented, but brilliant Bennett Halverson. After briefly appearing alongside Chris Carmack in “Deadly Honeymoon,” Summer was cast as the mysterious Orwell in the upcoming NBC superhero series “The Cape.” [NOTE: “The Cape” ended in Spring 2011.]\n\nGina Torres, who played stalwart first mate Zoe Washburne, has made a series of guest appearances in “Matrix Revolutions,” “CSI,” “24,” “Justice League,” “The Shield,” “Alias,” “Boston Legal,” “Bones,” “Criminal Minds” “Dirty Sexy Money,” “Pushing Daisies,” “Eli Stone,” “The Unit,” “Drop Dead Diva,” “The Vampire Diaries” and was a series regular on “Standoff” and most recently the ABC Family series “Huge” as sympathetic director Dorothy Rand. [NOTE: Gina Torres currently appears in the USA Network series “Suits,” which will return June 2012.]\n\nAlan Tudyk, who played pilot extraordinaire Hoban Washburne, went on to a startling film career appearing in “Dodgeball” with Colin Hanks, “I, Robot” with Will Smith, “RX” again with Colin Hanks and Eric Balfour, voicing roles in “Ice Age” and “Ice Age: The Meltdown,” “Knocked Up” with Katherine Heigl, “3:10 to Yuma” with Christian Bale, and the British film “Death at a Funeral.” His notable television appearances were on “V” which reunited him with former “Firefly” co-star Morena Baccarin and on “Dollhouse” which reunited him with “Firefly” co-star Summer Glau. Clearly, not only does Joss Whedon like to cast his favorite actors in all his projects, but the casting directors like to tease the sci-fi audiences by bringing these uniquely gifted and charismatic actors back on screen together. [NOTE: Alan Tudyk now appears on the ABC comedy series “Suburgatory.”]\n\nJewel Staite, who played vivacious mechanic Kaylee Frye, followed writer Tim Minear to his audacious series “Wonderfalls,” where she played an unrepentant cheating wife. Jewel then went on to co-star in the sci-fi series “Stargate: Atlantis” and the film “Stargate: Extinction.” In a delightful guest-star appearance, she also recently appeared in the sci-fi series “Warehouse 13″ alongside her “Firefly” co-star Sean Maher. [NOTE: Jewel Staite is a series regular in the new CW series “L.A. Complex” which premieres April 2012.]\n\nSean Maher, who played the brilliant doctor Simon Tam, appeared briefly in “CSI: Miami,” co-starred with Michelle Trachtenberg in “The Dive from Clauson’s Pier,” “Wedding Wars” with Eric Dane and John Stamos, “Ghost Whisperer,” “Drop Dead Diva,” “The Mentalist,” “Human Target,” and appeared alongside “Firefly” co-star Jewel Staite in a recent episode of “Warehouse 13.”\n\nFinally, Ron Glass, who played the enigma Shepherd Book, made a brief appearance on “The Division,” appearances in “Secret History of Religion: Knights of Templar” and “Secret History of Religion: Doomsday,” the legal drama “Shark,” “Dirty Sexy Money,” and most recently in Chris Rock’s “Death at a Funeral” (not to be confused with the British version in which Alan Tudyk appeared).\n\nWhile “Firefly” ended all too soon, it introduced viewers to an appealing cast of actors who continued to grace both the film and television screen with their remarkable talent — and for Browncoats everywhere, “Firefly” still lives in our hearts.\n\nRelated:\n\n“Comic-Con 2011: Fun candid pictures and video interviews from the CASTLE press room”\n\n“Comic-Con 2011: Fun candids and video interviews from the press room with the cast of CHUCK”\n\n“Saying Goodbye to CHUCK: The Little Series That Could”"
