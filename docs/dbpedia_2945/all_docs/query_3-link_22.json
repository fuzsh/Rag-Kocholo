        "text": "Editor's note: The Courier & Press and The Gleaner are marking Black History Month with a collection of stories about people, places and events from local Black history.\n\nEVANSVILLE â€“ \"Right now it looks good.\"\n\nThat's how Ron Glass summed up his prospects of becoming a professional actor back in 1968, when the University of Evansville star was one of 75 students from across the U.S. selected to audition for a national theater association in Chicago.\n\nHe had no idea how much he'd undersold himself.\n\nThe Evansville native would go on to become a TV star in shows such as \"Barney Miller\" and \"Firefly.\" In the former, he played the witty and impeccably dressed detective Ron Harris, who was just as interested in writing novels as solving cases.\n\nIt mirrored Glass' own life. He started off at UE as a literature major. The role earned him an Emmy nomination in 1982.\n\nDespite his success, he kept close ties with his home city, serving as chairman of the Evansville African American Museum's national capital campaign. He even donated his \"Barney Miller\" badge to the collection.\n\nDuring return trips to the city, he'd sometimes meet with local kids and give them advice. In the midst of a talk with area high school students in 1974, a girl from Bosse asked him \"what qualities are necessary to be a good Black actor?\"\n\n\"He has to be good,\" Glass said. \"And he has to be Black.\"\n\nGlass died of respiratory failure in 2016. He was 71 years old."
