Glass was known for his role on the long-running workplace sitcom Barney Miller, as well as portraying the character of Shepherd Book on the sci-fi series Firefly and its film follow-up Serenity.\n\nGlass’ television career spanned several other well-known series, including All in the Family, Sanford and Son and Friends. He also lent his voice to shows like Rugrats and video games such as Fable II. Recently, he had appeared in episodes of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and CSI.\n\nMany of Glass’ former Firefly castmates took to social media over the weekend to share fond memories of their late co-star–including Nathan Fillion, Jewel Staite, Alan Tudyk, Adam Baldwin and Sean Maher–as well as the show’s creator Joss Whedon:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/AdamBaldwin/status/802621797778628608\n\nhttps://twitter.com/AlanTudyk/status/802622027085422592\n\n—The Mary Sue has a strict comment policy that forbids, but is not limited to, personal insults toward anyone, hate speech, and trolling.—"
