DirecTV is one of the two direct broadcast satellite companies beaming television programming to the United States (Dish Network is the other). The history of DirecTV is a history of television technology, a history of American Federal law, but mostly, it's a history of Rupert Murdoch.

The Birth of Direct Broadcast Satellite

In the U.S. in the mid-to-late 1970s, cable television began to change from being "community antenna television," merely a method of getting better reception on existing local broadcast channels, to being a true value-added entertainment option, with channels such as HBO, USA Network, and WTBS being uplinked to a communications satellite in geosynchronous orbit and received by local cable companies on their own satellite dishes. Electronics hobbyists were, in fact, setting up their own satellite dishes in their backyards in order to try to get everything that was out there; dishes were also popular in parts of the country that were not served by cable TV, mainly rural areas.

These satellite dishes were big and expensive, and part of the problem was that they had to be motorized: since the various channels were being broadcast from satellites that were in different spots above the Equator, tuning to a different channel required actually moving the dish to point at a different satellite.

The solution for some of these problems seemed to be direct broadcast satellite, abbreviated DBS. DBS would act like a cable company in space, with all of the available channels broadcasting from one satellite; therefore, the dish could be smaller and not need to move. Also, not only would DBS provide rural areas with what was, in effect, cable TV service, but it would serve as competition for local franchised cable TV companies throughout the country.

In 1980, a company called Satellite Television Corporation made the first proposal to the Federal Communications Commission for a DBS service. Eight different proposals for DBS were eventually approved, and companies ranging from Western Union to Hubbard Broadcasting received FCC licenses to provide service. One of the approved proposals was for a service called Skyband, which was proposed by an Australian company called News Corp., then best known in the United States for publishing the New York Post newspaper. News Corp.'s owner Rupert Murdoch was simultaneously setting up a DBS service called Sky TV in the United Kingdom; Sky TV went on the air and became a success, but Skyband was stillborn. The main problem was lack of capital (since the service would have to be built from the ground up), but Murdoch had also underestimated the differences between the status of broadcast and cable television in the U.S. and in the U.K. and Europe. Sky TV was an easier sell to the British, with only four over-the-air channels available, than Skyband would have been in the U.S., where early 1980s cable systems were delivering as many as 36 channels into the homes of many Americans.

None of the other proposed DBS services got off the ground, either, and most of the companies returned their licenses to the FCC.

The Real Birth of DBS and DirecTV

By 1990, News Corp. had become well-known to Americans as the owner of the 20th Century Fox movie studio, and more importantly for this writeup, the owner of the Fox television network. So it was that Rupert Murdoch formed Sky Cable, a new DBS service joint venture with another programming provider (NBC), a cable television multiple system operator (Cablevision), and an electronics firm with satellite interests (Hughes Electronics). The partnership soon fell apart, though, mainly due to lack of capital, and Sky Cable's FCC licenses ended up in the hands of Hughes.

Finally, in July 1991, a DBS service actually went on the air: Primestar, owned by a consortium of cable operators, used analog transmission from leased transponders on a General Electric-owned satellite. Primestar subscribers used a 24-to-30-inch dish, usually mounted on the ground, to receive programming.

A year later, the Federal government passed the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, which assured the future viability of DBS by requiring network owners to provide their programming equally to both cable systems and DBS services.

Hughes finally managed to get around the "lack of capital" problem by raising money from its corporate parent (General Motors), as well as from the National Rural Telecommunications Cooperative (in exchange for giving the companies in the NRTC the exclusive rights to sell Hughes' DBS service in rural areas without cable TV service). The "Sky Cable" name was trademarked by News Corp., so Hughes came up with a new name: DirecTV.

Meanwhile, Hubbard Broadcasting was still holding its DBS licenses from the early 1980s, under the corporate name United States Satellite Broadcasting, a.k.a. USSB. USSB and DirecTV agreed to share transponder space on the same satellite, as well as use the same transmitting and receiving technology, allowing viewers to use the same satellite dish and receiver to subscribe to either or both service. The two services jointly marketed themselves as "DSS," for "Digital Satellite Service," indicating that they were using digital transmission using MPEG-2 compression to deliver their programming. The digital transmission and the higher power of the signals coming from the satellite meant that subscribers could use a smaller dish than Primestar subscribers; the 18-inch-diameter DSS dish could be mounted to a structure's roof or chimney.

In December 1993, Hughes launched a brand-new satellite, called DBS-1, to a position at 101 degrees longitude. 22 of the transponders were used by DirecTV, with the rest used by USSB. Once satellite testing was completed, DirecTV and USSB began operations in early 1994, beginning sales of DSS receivers at Cowboy Maloney's Electric City in Jackson, Mississippi, my new favorite store name ever. Each service had signed exclusive deals with the various networks; DirecTV provided most of the "basic cable" channels and pay-per-view movies, plus the Encore and Starz! premium movie channels, while USSB had the major premium movie channels, such as HBO and Showtime, and a handful of other popular channels such as Nickelodeon and Lifetime. In practice, most DSS subscribers were paying for a mix of DirecTV and USSB channels and not really noticing which was which until it was time to pay the programming bill at the end of the month.

In the first few years, DSS had several disadvantages over cable television. Most off-putting for the average television viewer was that, while cable systems usually only required a converter box for premium movie channels and not only gave the boxes away for free but would also install them for free, DSS required the purchase of a dish and a receiver for every TV on which it would be viewed, plus charged for installation. In 1994 and 1995, the cost for having a full DSS system installed could approach $1,000.

Also, only cable television could offer local broadcast channels. DirecTV offered a package of two affiliates each of ABC, CBS, and NBC (one from the Eastern and one from the Pacific time zone), plus Fox and PBS national feeds; however, due to both FCC regulations and United States copyright law, these channels could only be subscribed to by DSS viewers with no local affiliate in their area. DSS subscribers in most parts of the country had to either use rabbit ears to get their local affiliates, or remain subscribed to cableâ€¦or lie to DirecTV about their service address.

Despite the drawbacks, the two DSS services boasted 320,000 subscribers by the end of 1994. In 1995, DirecTV gained a major advantage over cable by signing an agreement with the National Football League to be the only DBS or cable service offering the NFL Sunday Ticket package of out-of-town Sunday afternoon football games. Competition then began to drive equipment prices down, with Primestar converting to digital transmission and with a competing DBS service, EchoStar Communications' Dish Network, beginning service at the beginning of 1996.

Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. again tried to get into the American DBS market in 1996, announcing a joint venture with MCI called American Sky Broadcasting (ASkyB). This service never actually went live. Murdoch then tried to take over EchoStar, but was rebuffed by its founder Charlie Ergen, and then tried to take over Primestar, but was rebuffed by its owners, notably Time Warner.

DirecTV Matures, and Murdoch Keeps Coming Back

In 1998, DirecTV acquired USSB, thus ending the "DSS" marketing concept and unifying all the channels under the DirecTV name. A year later, DirecTV managed to acquire Primestar, doing what Rupert Murdoch couldn't, and began a 2-year process of shutting down the Primestar service, swapping out Primestar subscriber equipment for DirecTV equipment (most Primestar subscribers had been leasing the equipment from the company).

In 1999, the Federal government passed the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act, which among other things, allowed DBS services to begin offering local broadcast channels via satellite (called "local into local"), with the only caveat being that by January 1, 2002, full "must-carry" provisions would come into effect in each market in which a DBS service chose to carry local channels. DirecTV immediately began providing major network affiliates in a number of larger markets, eventually launching a new satellite solely devoted to local channels in order to be able to comply with the must-carry rules. By early 2004, DirecTV provided all local channels in 64 metropolitan areas, with plans to add another 59 areas at some point during the year.

In 2001, DirecTV introduced receivers with built-in digital video recorder functions, signing deals with both TiVo and with Microsoft's Ultimate TV. Both had the capability of recording two shows simultaneously, capturing two streams of DirecTV's MPEG-2 video directly to their hard drives. DirecTV could now claim many advantages over the local cable companies in the U.S., including lower rates (in most cases), fewer signal outages, and better picture quality, in addition to the DVR's, something cable companies didn't start rolling out until 2003.

Enter Rupert Murdoch again. General Motors made no secret of the fact that they wanted to get rid of their controlling stake in Hughes, and whoever controlled Hughes would control DirecTV. Murdoch made no secret of the fact that he still wanted to get into the DBS business in the U.S. He first made overtures toward Hughes in 2001, but was rebuked when EchoStar offered to buy Hughes at three times the price Murdoch was offering. That potential deal ran afoul of Federal regulators, but there was no problem with Murdoch's deal. And so finally, in 2003, Murdoch had his American DBS service; he acquired the controlling interest in Hughes and DirecTV in a deal worth about $6.6 billion.

(The first obvious sign of Murdoch's ownership of DirecTV was when the TV Guide Channel was added to the lineup in early 2004. TV Guide is owned by a company called Gemstar-TV Guide in which News Corp. has a significant minority stake, although not controlling ownership.)

Actual Information Not Involving Rupert Murdoch

DirecTV currently broadcasts signals from six satellites in geosynchronous orbit; three at 101 degrees longitude, one at 110 degrees, and one at 119 degrees, all receiving signals from DirecTV uplink facilities located around the United States and sending signals back down at 200 to 240 watts of power. (The main DirecTV uplink facility is in Castle Rock, Colorado, with a backup facility in El Segundo, California; each metropolitan area in which DirecTV provides local broadcast channels also has its own uplink facility for those channels.)

Two of the satellites, one at 101 degrees and one at 119 degrees, are solely devoted to over-the-air channels, and broadcast them on spot beams aimed in the general direction of the metropolitan area they're serving. (Therefore, it is physically impossible for someone in Tampa, Florida to get channels intended for, say, Boston, Massachusetts.) Channels on the 101 satellite tend to serve larger metropolitan areas than the ones carried on the 119 satellite.

The other satellites in the 101 position carry DirecTV's "core channels," i.e., all of the "cable" channels that most DirecTV subscribers would want. Therefore, many DirecTV subscribers need only an 18-inch-diameter satellite dish pointed at the 101-degree position. However, the 110 and 119-degree satellites carry high-definition channels and Spanish channels, in addition to the aforementioned local channels in smaller markets; receiving programming from those satellites requires a special oval-shaped dish measuring about 18 by 24 inches.

In the spring of 2004, DirecTV is expected to launch a new local-channel-only satellite into the 119-degree position, and move an existing satellite to 72.5 degrees (an orbital slot being leased from a Canadian company). The equipment required to receive local channels being carried at 72.5 is to be determined.

DirecTV now has about 12 million subscribers nationwide.

Special Bonus Feature, Which You Probably Should Ignore If You're Not a Big Geek: This is a comparison between the DSS (DirecTV/USSB) channel lineup as of March 1996 and the DirecTV channel lineup as of yesterday morning. A semicolon indicates a channel that's changed its name. I wish I could have found an earlier channel listing (e.g., the original 1994 lineup), but no such luck. Some channels are not listed, including the one where they show you how to hook up your receiver, which you can't watch if your receiver isn't hooked up.
