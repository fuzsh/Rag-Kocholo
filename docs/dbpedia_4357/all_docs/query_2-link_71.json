        "text": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nBelow is a numerical representation of the DirecTV channel lineup. Some channels have both east and west feeds, airing the same programming with a three-hour delay on the latter feed, creating a backup for those who missed their shows. The three-hour delay also represents the time zone difference between Eastern (UTC -5/-4) and Pacific (UTC -8/-7).\n\nContents\n\n1 Technical Aspects\n\n1.1 High definition\n\n1.2 Special channels\n\n1.3 Infomercial channels\n\n2 List of DirecTV channels\n\n2.1 Color Legend\n\n2.2 Channels 2â99 Primarily local channels, MPEG-2 HD channels and flagship feeds\n\n2.3 Channels 100â199: In-house channels and pay-per-view\n\n2.4 Channels 200â299 General entertainment, informational, sports and educational\n\n2.5 Channels 300â378: General entertainment, informational, educational, and religion\n\n2.6 379â399 Distant Network Channels (Flagship feeds) in MPEG-4\n\n2.7 Channels 401â443 and 460-461: Spanish channels\n\n2.8 Channels 450â455: Chinese Channels\n\n2.9 Channels 456â458: Pay-Per-View Soccer\n\n2.10 Channels 470â475: MLS Direct Kick (also available in HD)\n\n2.11 Channels 477-479 Cricket Ticket\n\n2.12 Channels 480â497: Test Channels\n\n2.13 Channels 500â552, 589-599 Movie Channels\n\n2.14 570â578, 582 Private networks\n\n2.15 579-580 Pay-Per-View Special Events (Currently Unused)\n\n2.16 Channels 600â699 Sports Channels\n\n2.17 Channels 700â799 Out-of-market and supplemental sports packages\n\n2.18 Channels 801-869 Sirius XM Radio\n\n2.19 Channels 870-879 Sonic Tap (Spanish Radio)\n\n2.20 Channels 1000-2000: DirecTV On Demand\n\n2.21 2000-2999: International programming\n\n2.22 9560â9574: XM for Business\n\n3 Future DirecTV channels\n\n3.1 Locals\n\n3.2 Rebrandings\n\n3.3 Future HD feed additions of current channels\n\n3.4 Channels yet to be launched or that were previously unavailable\n\n4 Carriage controversies\n\n5 See also\n\n6 External links\n\n7 Notes\n\n8 References\n\nTechnical Aspects\n\nHigh definition\n\nMost high-definition (HDTV) and foreign-language channels may require a certain satellite dish or set-top box. Additionally, the same channel number is listed for both the standard-definition (SD) channel and the high-definition (HD) channel, such as 202 for both CNN and CNN HD. DirecTV HD receivers can tune to each channel separately. This is required since programming may be different on the SD and HD versions of the channels; while at times the programming may be simulcast with the same programming on both SD and HD channels. Some channels will be listed as XXX-1, (regional sports networks and out of market sports packages on channels 615-617 and 636-799), of which some programs are not available in HD, so DirecTV only turns on the HD version during live games to save bandwidth. Older HD receivers will only receive the MPEG-2 HD programming on channels 70-99.\n\nFor a list of areas with local channels available in high-definition, see List of DirecTV local channels with HD.\n\nSpecial channels\n\nIn addition to the channels listed below, DirecTV occasionally uses temporary channels for various purposes, such as emergency updates (e.g. Hurricane Gustav information on channel 363 in September 2008), channel announcements, and news of legislation that could affect subscribers. The News Mix channels (102 and 352) have special versions during special events such as the 2008 United States Presidential Election night coverage and during the Inauguration of Barack Obama.\n\nInfomercial channels\n\nInfomercial channels are rented on a leased access basis. Their positions may change frequntly.\n\nList of DirecTV channels\n\nColor Legend\n\nChannel Types\n\nStandard Definition High Definition Music Channels (Audio Only) Sports International Spanish Movies Family Pack High Definition Private Networks Interactive Channels Test Channels\n\nChannels 2â99 Primarily local channels, MPEG-2 HD channels and flagship feeds\n\nChannel Network Minimum Package Notes 2â69 Local channels Family Virtual channels that are mapped from actual satellite channel numbers to local broadcast channel numbers for easy access by subscriber.
