        "text": "In 2018 Netflix’s stimulus to Spanish VoD platforms became noticeable with the consolidation of pioneering companies and the arrival of new actors, multiplying the fictional programming offer and intensifying the competitiveness of the space. Pay TV beat its own record thanks to the increase in paid streaming OTT services. Meanwhile, and despite the sustained decline of lineal viewing, open TV, both national and autonomic, has maintained its audience level. The production of fictional programming by VoD platforms has aided premiere total numbers to return to levels prior to the economic crisis. It has also ratified some trends observed in recent seasons, such as the reduction in the number of episodes and the success of stories set in the past. The rise of the action-thriller, to the detriment of comedy, is another highlight of the year, both in the offer of pay television and in open TV.\n\nThe present OBITEL Yearbook is the sixth of a series started in the year 2007, and it reflects the maturity of a methodological model that combines quantitative study with the contextual analysis of television fiction, its transmediation into other screens and the sociocultural dynamics that are circumscribed to each of the different member countries. OBITEL is made up of eleven national research groups that throughout a year systematically monitor fiction shows that are broadcast through open television channels in their respective countries. The results of this monitoring are presented through the singularities and tendencies of fiction in each country. In addition, every OBITEL yearbook has a comparative chapter that provides a general panorama of the member countries. Fiction, as industry and format, is one of the most representative cultural and media products of television in Ibero-America. Its cultural, symbolic tradition is a place of agreement and disagreement that is now the setting not only of the main characters' loves and intimate secrets in the telenovelas and series, but also that of public life, politics, the citizenship, since ever more fiction anchors its narrative on the multiple problems that affect us as a region and at the same time separate us as countries. The Obitel countries decided to make the theme of \" transnationalization in the fiction television \" the topic of the year for this 2012 Yearbook, with the objective of mapping the characteristics of the transnational flows among and outside the countries participating in this project. OBITEL 2012 reflected on the three spheres where the transnational element makes an impact or is reflected: the industry, the contents and the flows and audiences.\n\nIntroduction. This paper analyzes the current state of the production of serial Spanish TV fiction for Video on demand platforms, from a canonical perspective that allows to establish common characteristics and patterns in serial products of Spanish TV production of VOD platforms and that offers the possibility of outlining a recent history of Spanish TV fiction created to be broadcast in the streaming universe. Metodology. Based on a mixed methodology that combines qualitative analysis with quantitative data, the article analyzes 60 series created for the most far-reaching platforms in Spain and establishes patterns on forms, styles and narrative issues. Results. The results point to a growing interest in the production of Spanish fiction for VOD with its own productive characteristics, which mark the new way of making Spanish fiction, Discussion and Conclusions. Despite the fact that little innovation and transgression is evident in terms of narrations and stories refers, this paper reveals a nascent productive canon that is repeated and that establishes a personal stamp that benefits the reception of Spanish fiction on VOD platforms.\n\nAbstract In this paper I intend to revisit from a critical perspective some issues related to the contemporary landscape of fictional TV storytelling: scripted shows whose consumption and reputation have witnessed significant changes in the 21st century. My interest focuses on what I call “narrative plenitude”, the exceptional profusion of serialized fictions that are now available, anytime, anywhere, on the myriad of channels and platforms in the ever-expanding media environment. In this context, priority attention will be given in the article to the case of Netflix. In particular, I will try to unravel the coexisting mixture of gains and losses embodied in key aspects of the modus operandi embraced by the world’s leading streaming platform. Then I will address the problematic readiness of contemporary television studies to concentrate a great deal of scholarship on just a select body of scripted shows, which come under the category of ‘prestige TV’. I join the dialogue among others in the field who take issue with patterns of choice largely based on the questionable cultural divide between quality niche TV and ordinary broadcast programming. Furthermore, I make the claim that this tendency fails to account for the unprecedented amplification of the contemporary landscape of storytelling, as if television studies “can’t see the forest for the trees”. Keywords: storytelling system; narrative plenitude; Netflix; prestige TV\n\nAs expected, the deep political and economic crisis experienced in Brazil over the past years has affected various segments in the audiovisual field. Paradoxically, however, the dynamism of the television industry in 2015 has rarely been matched in the past. This ambivalent scenario has led to an extremely interesting synthesis: even in the midst of the crisis (or to survive it), certain trends we observed in previous years have been reinforced, such as an increasing adherence to new forms of production, distribution and consumption of TV fiction, like on demand contents and mobile applications, the predominance of a “cycle of short stories,” with new formats of television fiction, in addition to the continuous profusion of national productions on payTV.\n\nThis Obitel Yearbook 2016 is the 10th volume of a series started in 2007. Since then, the OBITEL established itself in the Ibero-American Communication studies field as an international research network that produces quantitative and qualitative analysis with the main objective to identify through comparative study, similarities, characteristics, adaptations, appropriations among the various national television narratives produced and displayed in the region. The theme of the year for this Yearbook is the (Re)Invention Gender and formats of TV Fiction, which attempts to analyze the changes identified in television narratives over time, concerning the serialization and the fictional genres. We observe that these narratives have become increasingly hybrids mainly due to advances in transmedia production and reception. The most important outcome is that the comparative analysis identified in all countries a greater diversity of formats and genres in TV fiction."
