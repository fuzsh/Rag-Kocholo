        "text": "Cable TV\n\nEvery residence hall room has a television hook up. The cable is exclusively digital, meaning your TV must have a digital tuner. Unfortunately, digital adapters do not work on the campus infrastructure because the service provider only gives UW Oshkosh a digital signal. This means if your TV is analog only, when you scan with your TV it will not find any channels. If you are unsure if your television has a digital tuner, review your owner’s manual or search online.\n\nScanning For Channels\n\nScanning (or rescanning) for channels is mostly an automated process. While these steps are different for each TV, the process is similar on most TVs. Here are some more general instructions, which should help you get the scan process going on your TV:\n\nMake sure your TV is connected to the cable TV jack in your room/apartment.\n\nPress the Menu button on your remote control. If you don’t have a remote, your TV should have a built-in Menu button.\n\nFind and select the Channel Scan option in your TV’s menu. This option is could also be labeled Rescan, Tune, or Auto-tune.\n\nIf you cannot find the Channel Scan option, dig through the TV’s Settings, Tools, Channels, or Options menu. Make sure you scan the Cable TV channels.\n\nIf given a choice between digital or analog, select digital.\n\nOnce your TV starts scanning for channels, it can take up to 10 minutes.\n\nWhen scanning is complete, your TV will either display how many channels are available or drop you back into a broadcast channel.\n\nStill missing some channels? Try running another scan.\n\nIf you are having trouble finding the Channel Scan option on your TV, then you can usually find a manual by searching the web for the TV’s make and model along with the word “manual.”\n\nOther Notes\n\nNon HDTV’s or devices without a digital tuner will no longer work on Campus.\n\nCable jacks in the Residence Life dorm rooms should work, other cable jacks around campus may or may not be connected.\n\nUWO has its own channel lineup from Spectrum and a cable box/cable card/descrambler/something from the cable company is not needed.\n\nUW Oshkosh Campus Channel Lineup\n\nLOCAL GUIDE GUIDELO 10.1 SPECTRUM NEWS SPCNEWS 10.2 WBAY ABC ABC 11.1 WBAY ABC Weather ABC2 11.2 WFRV CBS CBS 11.6 WLUK FOX FOX 12.1 WLUK 2 Antenna TV FOX2 12.2 WGBA NBC NBC 12.6 WCWF CW CW 13.1 WPNE PBS PBS 13.6 WPNE2 PBS WI CH PBS2 13.7 ION ION 23.1 WGBA2 MeTV METV 23.2 WACY IND MYNET 23.3 WYTU Telemundo TELEM 24.3 UniMas UNIMAS 25.1 Univision UNV 25.2 Daystar DYSTR 25.3 TBN TBN 26.1 BALLY Sports Wisconsin RSN 28.1 BALLY Sports Wisconsin Plus RSN 28.2 DELUXE GUIDE 1 GUIDED1 30.1 USA NETWORK USA 30.2 AE AETV 30.3 TNT TNT 31.1 TBS TBS 31.2 AMC AMC 31.3 DISCOVERY DSC 32.1 HISTORY HISTORY 32.2 FX FX 32.3 BBC AMERICA BBCA 33.1 SYFY SYFY 33.2 TRUTV TRUTV 33.3 COMEDY CENTRAL COMEDY 34.1 PARAMOUNT NETWORK PAR 34.2 VH1 VH1 34.3 MTV MTV 35.1 TV LAND TVLAND 35.2 FREEFORM FREEFRM 35.3 HALLMARK CHANNEL HALL 36.1 NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC NGC 36.2 ANIMAL PLANET APL 36.3 SCIENCE SCIENCE 37.1 AMERICAN HEROES CHANNEL AHC 37.2 HGTV HGTV 37.3 FOOD NETWORK FOOD 38.1 TRAVEL CHANNEL TRAV 38.2 TLC TLC 38.3 BRAVO BRAVO 39.1 E!
