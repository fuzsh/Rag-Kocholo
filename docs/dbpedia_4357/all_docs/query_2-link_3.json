        "text": "Date Event 2 The Al Jazeera Media Network announces that they will acquire Current TV from an ownership group fronted by Al Gore and Joel Hyatt, with the intention to replace it with an American version of its Al Jazeera News network later in 2013.[1] The announcement becomes the catalyst in Time Warner Cable's decision to drop Current TV from its systems, as TWC plans to drop several channels due to low viewership and to contract renegotiations within the year.[2][3] Cox Communications removes eight stations owned by Raycom Media in six markets due to a retransmission dispute. The markets affected were Cleveland (two stations), Baton Rouge, Tucson, Lake Charles, Louisiana, Richmond (two stations), and Panama City, Florida.[4] 4 Nick Jr. celebrates its 25th anniversary. 5 For the first time since 2002, music video channel VH1 changes its logo font (VH+1, with the H+ combined) and rebrands with a new slogan, \"We Complete You\", to focus on their conversion to a broader entertainment channel.[5] VH1 Classic and VH1 Soul do not have logo changes. Also, Food Network changed their logotype to a slightly less-serifed typeface of lettering the following day.[6] 7 Univision Communications rebrands its TeleFutura network as UniMás.[7] 8 ESPN issues an apology involving Brent Musburger's comments he made about Alabama quarterback A. J. McCarron and his girlfriend, Katherine Webb, during the telecast of the 2013 BCS National Championship Game.[8] A week later, Musberger said, live and on the air, that sideline reporter Holly Rowe was \"smoking hot\".[9] ABC moves Jimmy Kimmel Live! to the 11:35 pm (ET) slot, putting it in direct competition with NBC's The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and CBS's Late Show with David Letterman. Nightline moves to the 12:35 am (ET) timeslot and will expand to a primetime hour-long edition that will air on Friday nights in the 9 pm (ET) timeslot starting in March.[10] 10 After only one season, Britney Spears announces that she will leave The X Factor (amid rumors and tensions between her and the show after the conclusion of the second season) to return to recording.[11] 11 Sinclair Broadcast Group announces it will sell CW affiliate WLWC/Providence, Rhode Island to OTA Broadcasting, LLC for $13.75 million, pending FCC approval.[12] 14 CBS affiliate WBKB-TV in Alpena, Michigan, the only commercial television station in its market, begins carrying ABC programming on its third digital subchannel, giving the Alpena market its first full-time ABC affiliate.[13] 15 Communications Corporation of America announces its intent to sell all 25 of its stations in ten markets located in Texas, Louisiana, and Indiana.[14][15] 16 Former Democratic United States Congressman and Presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich joins Fox News Channel as a political analyst and contributor.[16] 17 OTA Broadcasting purchases My Family TV affiliate WYCN-LP/Nashua, New Hampshire from New Hampshire 1 Network, Inc. for $4.1 million. Under the deal, New Hampshire 1 Network (run by Bill Binnie, whose Carlisle One Media owns independent station WBIN-TV in nearby Derry) will continue to operate the station upon consummation of the sale.[17] 18 NRJ TV acquires 2 stations owned by Titan Broadcast Management. It acquires Estrella TV affiliate KTNC/San Francisco for $13.5 million and independent station KUBE/Houston for $19 million. Titan will continue to operate both stations upon the sale's consummation. The acquisition of KTNC will create a legal duopoly in the San Francisco market with MundoFox affiliate KCNS (which was bought by NRJ, a company which Titan holds a minority equity stake, for $15 million in 2011).[18] Time Warner Cable announces that they will no longer accept ads for guns or any form of firearms on all its cable systems. The move comes after an ad from the National Rifle Association of America (which in turn was a response to a plan that is being implemented by the Obama Administration to issue a ban on assault weapons in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting) began airing on The Sportsman Channel, which TWC happens to offer on their systems[19] 20 Former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice joins CBS News as a contributor/commentator.[20] 24 Fox affiliate WXXA/Albany officially discontinues its 5 and 11 pm newscasts, concentrating instead on its morning and 10 pm newscasts. The move is related to WXXA's shared services agreement with ABC affiliate WTEN, which has its own newscasts at 5 and 11 pm[21] After years of being \"bumped\" due to the show \"running out of time\", Matt Damon exacts revenge on Jimmy Kimmel by taking over as host of this date's airing of Jimmy Kimmel Live![22] 25 Sarah Palin parts ways with Fox News Channel after a three-year stint as a contributor.[23] The separation is short-lived, as Palin rejoins Fox News on June 13.[24] 28 Major League Baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers confirm the formation of a new regional sports network, SportsNet LA, in partnership with Time Warner Cable. The network, whose content will be controlled by the Dodgers, will air Dodgers broadcasts beginning in 2014 (a 25-year deal estimated at $7–8 billion and subject to MLB approval), supplanting incumbent rightsholders Prime Ticket and KCAL-TV.[25] Fox Television Stations announces its purchase of the Capitol Broadcasting-owned duopoly in the Charlotte market: WJZY (The CW) and WMYT-TV (MyNetworkTV).[26][27] The $18 million deal, which is completed on April 17, leads to the end of WCCB's 27-year run as Charlotte's Fox affiliate, with the network's programming moving to WJZY on July 1 (WCCB takes over CW affiliation on that date).[28][29][30] 31 Married political analysts James Carville and Mary Matalin parts ways with CNN, both citing the network's desire to move in a new direction and to focus on other projects.[31] After seven seasons and 138 episodes, 30 Rock aired its final two episodes, \"Hogcock!\" and \"Last Lunch\", which featured a cameo from Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, and a nod to the final scene from St. Elsewhere in which NBC programming president (and revealed to be immortal) Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) is pitched a pilot for a sitcom, aptly named 30 Rock, by Liz Lemon's (Tina Fey) great-granddaughter 100 years in the future.[32] Date Event 3 CBS airs Super Bowl XLVII, which includes a 34-minute power outage in the third quarter, a surprise reunion of Destiny's Child during the halftime show,[33] and a Baltimore Ravens victory over the San Francisco 49ers by a score of 34–31.[34] With an estimated 108.4 million viewers, it ranked third on the most-watched list, behind Super Bowls XLIV and XLVI.[35] 4 Fox affiliate KLRT/Little Rock discontinued its weeknight 10 p.m. newscast, while in turn debuting a new weekday morning newscast and reducing the hour-long 5 pm newscast to a half-hour 5:30 pm show. This is related to KLRT and its CW-affiliated sibling KASN forming an outsourcing agreement with Nexstar Broadcasting Group (owners of NBC affiliate KARK and MyNetworkTV affiliate KARZ), forming a virtual quadropoly, in which all four will be based in KARK's studios.[36] CBS' Hawaii Five-0 aired an updated remake of the original series' sixth-season episode \"Hookman\", using the same scripts and locations from the 1973 broadcast. The episode was directed by Peter Weller, who also played the amputee sniper (that was originally played by real-life amputee actor Jay J. Armes) who has a hatred for Honolulu Police Department officers by targeting the individuals, including Commander Steve McGarrett (Alex O'Loughlin), whose father, in this version of the remake, was responsible for his loss of his hands.[37] 5 Fox News Channel announces that it has dropped political analyst Dick Morris from the network and will not renew his contract. Morris believed that the decision by Fox to drop him can be traced to his \"prediction\" that Mitt Romney was going to beat Barack Obama in a landslide during the 2012 Election, only to be proven wrong on election night.[38] 6 Nexstar Broadcasting Group announces its acquisition of NBC affiliate KSEE/Fresno, California from Granite Broadcasting for $26.5 million. The station will be operated in tandem with CBS affiliate KGPE, which it acquired in 2012 from Newport Television, through a time brokerage agreement until the sale is approved.[39] Nexstar also settles a lawsuit against Granite Broadcasting that alleged that the latter company controlled advertising sales through its carriage of five network affiliations on two Fort Wayne, Indiana stations (WISE-TV and co-managed WPTA), resulting in that market's Fox affiliation returning to WFFT-TV from WISE's second subchannel on March 1, reversing a 2011 switch that resulted from a dispute between Nexstar and Fox over retransmission compensation.[40][41] After announcing in 2012 that they would exercise their option to buy six stations from Sinclair Broadcast Group, Fox Television Stations decides to pass on acquiring any of the stations.[42] However at the same time, Sinclair announces that they are looking to add more stations to the 87 they own or operate in 47 television markets.[43] Catamount Broadcasting agrees to sell CBS affiliate KHSL/Chico, California to GOCOM Media, LLC for $7 million. The deal includes its local marketing agreement with NBC affiliate KNVN (owned by Evans Broadcasting).[44] 7 Wheel of Fortune taped one week of shows with the second $1,000,000 and a recent $100,000 (the usual grand prize) win on concurrent episodes, the first time Wheel had done so in giving out consecutive grand prize wins since the $100,000 prize was introduced in 2001 (see May 30 below).[45][46] Jeopardy! produced its second \"triple zero\" finish (all three contestants finished with a score of $0) in the second semi-final of 2013 Teen Tournament, resulting in the elimination of three contestants and one wildcard contestant was brought into effect (the contestant was later revealed to be Leonard Cooper, who gone on to win the tournament overall). This was only the second time in the show's history that a triple zero occurred during a tournament, with the first being the quarter-finals of the 1991 Seniors Tournament.[47] 8 Charter Communications acquires cable provider Optimum West from Cablevision Systems Corporation for $1.6 billion. The sale closed during the third quarter of 2013 with Optimum West customers directed to Charter's site thereafter.[48] 11 The Emergency Alert System infrastructure of CBS affiliate KRTV/Great Falls, Montana is broken into with a false audible warning of a zombie apocalypse over both the main signal and their CW digital subchannel, along with a request to tune into 920 AM – a station that does not exist in Great Falls – for more information (an audio recording of this incident that was broadcast February 12 on WIZM-FM/La Crosse, Wisconsin simultaneously set off the EAS receiver of CBS affiliate WKBT).[49][50] The station quickly denied the EAS warning was true, suggesting a hacker invasion into the EAS system.[51] A similar EAS intrusion incident took place hours later in Marquette, Michigan, when PBS member station WNMU and ABC affiliate WBUP had the same message carried over both stations' signals.[52][53] 12 Comcast announces it will purchase the remaining 49% stake of NBCUniversal from General Electric for $16.3 billion, ending 27 years of GE's ownership of NBC in some capacity.[54] 13 LIN Media rescinds its 24% ownership stake in (de facto) NBC owned-and-operated stations KXAS-TV/Fort Worth-Dallas and KNSD/San Diego, paying NBCUniversal a $100 million withdrawal from the joint venture involving the two stations.[55] Former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown, who turned down an offer to run for the seat that was vacated by John Kerry in the special election, joins Fox News Channel as a contributor/analyst.[56] A day later, Herman Cain also joins the network for the same duties as well.[57] Upstart company Rural Broadband Investments (created through a partnership with private equity firm GTCR) acquires cable provider New Wave Communications, which serves rural areas of Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and Arkansas, from Pamlico Capital. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.[58] 14 CBS Corporation acquires a minority ownership interest in event-oriented cable channel AXS TV (joining stakes owned by Mark Cuban, Anschutz Entertainment Group, Ryan Seacrest Media and the Creative Artists Agency in the joint venture). The specific percentage of CBS' stake in the network was not disclosed.[59] 16 All seven stations owned by Grant Broadcasting System II disappear from Dish Network due to a dispute over retransmission consent|retransmission fees (markets affected by the blackout are Huntsville, Alabama, Davenport, Iowa (two stations), Roanoke, Virginia (two stations) and La Crosse, Wisconsin).[60] 18 Reflecting the new direction of CNN under the leadership of new network president Jeff Zucker, the 'flipper' ticker on the bottom of the screen, which displayed headlines from CNN.com's RSS feeds, is replaced with a traditional scrolling news ticker, returning the scroll to CNN for the first time since 2008.[61] 19 16-year-old Prince Michael Jackson I joins Entertainment Tonight as their new correspondent, making him the youngest reporter ever in the 32-year history of the program. However, due to his status as a minor, his role will be on a limited basis.[62] Another former political veteran switches jobs to television, as Barack Obama's former campaign advisor and former journalist David Axelrod joins NBC News and MSNBC as their political analyst/commentator.[63] 24 The 85th Academy Awards telecast makes history when First Lady of the United States Michelle Obama announces the winner for Best Picture (Argo) live from the White House.[64] 25 Cox Media Group sells its four small market television stations in El Paso, Texas, Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Reno, Nevada and Steubenville, Ohio to Sinclair Broadcast Group for $99 million. Cox is selling these stations in order to focus on its larger market stations.[65] Concurrently, Deerfield Media will acquire the license assets of Reno's KAME-TV, which has long been operated by Cox, from Ellis Communications.[66] Sinclair also announced the formation of a subsidiary, Chesapeake Television, which will focus on smaller markets such as those served by the four former Cox stations.[66][67] Hubbard Broadcasting acquires MyNetworkTV affiliate WNYA/Pittsfield, Massachusetts from Venture Technologies Group, which will create a duopoly with nearby Albany, New York NBC affiliate WNYT for $2.3 million, pending FCC approval. The station is seeking a 'failed station waiver' to acquire the station.[68][69] Diane Dostinich acquires the 51% ownership stake in Daystar affiliate KKJB/Boise that was held by station co-owner Gary Cocola of Cocola Broadcasting for $1.2 million.[70] 26 Cablevision files an antitrust lawsuit against Viacom in a Manhattan federal court, alleging that the media conglomerate illegally forced the cable provider to carry 14 lower-rated channels (such as VH1 Classic, Palladia and MTV Hits) in order to carry higher-profile cable networks owned by Viacom such as MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central.[71] 28 Sinclair Broadcast Group reaches a retransmission consent agreement with DirecTV. The removal of 87 Sinclair owned or operated stations in 47 markets would have occurred on March 1, if a new retransmission consent agreement was not reached before the prior carriage deal expired.[72] Sinclair also adds more stations to its portfolio, as it acquires the 18 Barrington Broadcasting stations (and the LMA/SSAs of six that Barrington operates) in a $370 million deal. However, Sinclair will spin off WSYT/Syracuse (including transferring the LMA of WNYS to another company) and WYZZ/Bloomington-Peoria due to overlapping in the two markets, along with turning over four others to Cunningham Broadcasting.[73] Negotiations break down between \"Judge\" Joe Brown and CBS Television Distribution over plans to cut his salary for his self-titled syndicated court show, which could see Brown splitting from CTD and taking his show elsewhere if the dispute is not resolved, as Brown has yet to sign a new deal. CTD announced that if Brown leaves, it would offer stations another courtroom show to make up for Brown's series contract into 2015 as a backup. On March 26, CTD announced that Judge Joe Brown was canceled and scrubbed plans for another courtroom show after stations balked on having a replacement. Brown is still looking for a new deal to have his show sign with another distributor.[74] The creators behind the ABC sitcom Home Improvement, Matt Williams, Carmen Finestra, Tam O'Shanter and David McFadzean (under the banner Wind Dancer Productions), file a lawsuit against The Walt Disney Company, seeking millions of dollars in revenue for failing to properly exploit the series after it went into syndication in 1995, including claims that they never received 75% of the show's profits after the series ended its run (in 1999).[75] Date Event 1 Fox Sports South and SportSouth announce they have picked up 45 more Atlanta Braves games, ending the team's contract with WPCH-TV.

Production of the program will move to CNBC's studios in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.[77] ABC affiliate WKPT-TV/Kingsport, Tennessee debuts local newscasts at 6 and 11 pm, the first full-fledged newscasts broadcast on the station since it terminated a news share agreement with CBS affiliate WJHL-TV in 2008 (and the first to be produced in-house since WKPT's previous news department shut down in 2002). The half-hour newscasts – which air only on weeknights – originate from WKPT's studios in downtown Kingsport.[78] 5 Major League Soccer announces a deal with MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated station WPWR-TV/Chicago (owned by Fox Television Stations) to broadcast 20 Chicago Fire games during the 2013 season (WPWR previously served as the team's over-the-air television broadcaster during the 2011 season).[79] 13 Disney Channel airs the Wizards Of Waverly Place special The Wizards Return: Alex vs. Alex. Kroenke Sports Enterprises acquires the Outdoor Channel for $227 million.[80] 14 MSNBC names Chris Hayes (host of the weekend morning program Up with Chris Hayes) as its new 8 pm ET host effective April 1.

On March 21, a New York appellate court lifted the injunction following an appeal filed by Lifetime, alleging the risk of financial damage due to its $3 million investment in the film and violations of constitutional speech protections.[84][85][86] Tribune Company forms Tribune Studios (not to be confused with the formerly owned Los Angeles studio facility that once held the same name), which will primarily produce programs for the company's 23 television stations and WGN America. This is Tribune's second production company, having operated Tribune Entertainment from 1984 to 2007.[87] Liberty Media acquires a 27% ownership interest in cable provider Charter Communications for $2.62 billion.

The contract (which will run through 2025) includes rights to televise all men's and select women's regular season and tournament basketball games, and all Olympic sports from the conference. Sporting events from the new Big East will be broadcast primarily on the forthcoming national sports network Fox Sports 1.[89] The deal follows a broadcast contract signed on March 19 between ESPN and the American Athletic Conference (the original Big East) through the 2019–20 academic year.[90] Comcast SportsNet Chicago suspends Chicago Bulls analyst (and former Bulls shooting guard) Kendall Gill following a March 19 physical altercation in the regional sports network's newsroom with Big Ten Network analyst Tim Doyle, over comments Doyle made about Gill's analysis of the March 18 Bulls-Denver Nuggets game on the panel discussion show Sports Talk Live.[91] 21 NBCUniversal, through its NBC Owned Television Stations subsidiary, acquires Telemundo affiliate WWSI/Atlantic City, New Jersey (part of the Philadelphia media market) from ZGS Communications for $20 million. The deal will create a duopoly with NBC owned-and-operated station WCAU.[92] A transmitter problem takes CBS affiliate KPHO/Phoenix off the air on the network's first day of NCAA Division I Basketball Tournament coverage. The disruption also affected subscribers of Dish Network, and cable providers Western Broadband Cable and Orbitel Communications (Cox Communications and DirecTV customers in the area were not affected).[93] 24 NBC affiliate KTEN/Sherman, Texas is knocked off the air due to a lightning strike that caused significant damage to some broadcasting equipment at the station's main studio in Denison.[94] 26 The Young and the Restless celebrates its 40th anniversary.[95] CBS Corporation acquires a 49% interest stake in TV Guide Network from One Equity Partners, with Lions Gate Entertainment retaining its 51% stake in the cable channel.[96] A collaborative rebranding effort of the network, seen in 80 million homes, later occurs: The network adopts the TVGN name on April 15, and a complete end of on-screen listings is expected. A war of words erupts between Fox News Channel and actor Jim Carrey: FNC reporter Greg Gutfeld makes a critical statement on this date over \"Cold Dead Hands\", Carrey's anti-gun video for the viral website Funny or Die, with Gutfield taking issue with Carrey's views on gun control by stating that, \"He [Carrey] is probably the most pathetic tool on the face of the earth and I hope his career is dead and I hope he ends up sleeping in a car.\" Carrey responds on March 29 by calling the network \"A media colostomy bag that has begun to burst at the seams.\"[97] Date Event 1 In a lawsuit filed by the four major broadcast networks, a New York judge rules that Aereo, a pay service which streams broadcast station signals online and through mobile devices without paying fees to the networks or their stations, does not breach federal copyright rules as it utilizes antennas leased to its subscribers to stream station signals.[98] The ruling sparks a threat during an NAB conference presentation on April 9 from News Corporation COO Chase Carey to turn Fox into a subscription-only service, if pending court proceedings do not rule against Aereo (similar statements were later made by executives of Univision and CBS).[99] General Hospital, the last of the remaining ABC soap operas, celebrates its 50th anniversary.[100] Shield Media's ABC affiliate WLAJ/Lansing, Michigan begins simulcasting Young Broadcasting CBS affiliate WLNS/Lansing's 6 and 11 pm newscasts.[101] Lockwood Broadcast Group announces it will acquire CW affiliate WCWG/Greensboro, North Carolina from Titan TV Broadcast Group for $2.75 million.[102][103] 2 ACME Communications sells its last operating asset, the syndicated morning show The Daily Buzz, to Mojo Brands Media.[104][105] 3 Confirming a month of speculation, NBC announces that Jay Leno will retire from hosting The Tonight Show in Spring 2014 (his second retirement from the show), and that Jimmy Fallon will be promoted from Late Night to succeed him.

The acquisition includes 20 television stations in eight markets (including KOMO-TV/Seattle and KATU/Portland, Oregon) and three radio stations in the Seattle market.[113] On April 22, an unnamed Fisher shareholder filed a lawsuit to stop the Sinclair acquisition, alleging that Fisher Communications management breached their fiduciary duties by agreeing to sell the company to Sinclair at a $41/share offer that undervalued the company via an \"unfair process\".[114] 15 At approximately 2:50 pm (EDT), two explosions around Copley Square, just before the photo bridge that marks the finish line, were caught live on camera during the telecast of the Boston Marathon, about three hours after the winners crossed the line. The event causes local stations in the Boston media market and the major networks, including ESPN, to cancel regular programming to carry continuing coverage of the tragedy.[115][116] At least three deaths were reported and 280 people were injured.[117] Four days later, just hours after the suspects' pictures are aired on national TV, all Boston news outlets preempt programming for nonstop coverage of the massive manhunt for the suspects, brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, after a police chase and standoff that left an MIT campus police officer and one of the two suspects dead from gunshots and the other suspect escaping into a Watertown neighborhood, eluding capture for most of the day until finally being arrested.

Viewers in the northern portion of the market were still able to watch the new episode over WCVB's sister station WMUR-TV/Manchester, New Hampshire. It was also made available on demand and to Hulu viewers in the Boston area the next morning.[122] WBIN/Derry, New Hampshire drops its Independent News Network-produced weeknight 10 pm newscast, replacing the newscast with syndicated programming.

These four stations will be operated by Sinclair through joint sales and shared services agreements; WSWB, WNBW, and WTLF are owned by MPS Media but have long been operated by New Age Media through such agreements (which Sinclair will continue), while WTLH cannot be acquired by Sinclair directly due to its existing ownership of WTWC-TV.[255][256] In ABC's Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, Josina Reaves became the second contestant to unsuccessfully attempt the $1,000,000 question (a question regarding Nostradamus's section of making jams and jellies; she incorrectly answered grave digging), its first time on doing so since Ken Basin failed to correctly answer the final question on August 23, 2009. Unlike Basin, Reaves risked only $75,000 (out of $100,000) due to her using the \"Jump\" lifelines on both $250,000 and $500,000 questions prior to the $1,000,000 question. 26 Stating that its \"technical justification... no longer appears valid\", the FCC formally submits a proposal to eliminate the discount, adopted in 1985 during the analog TV era, that counts a UHF station's reach to be one-half of its market when applied to a broadcaster's national ownership limit. The proposal would grandfather portfolios of any broadcaster with existing or pending ownership of UHF stations that would put them over the 39% national cap without the discount at the time of the proposal's submission.[257] 27 The Price Is Right devotes all six \"pricing game\" segments to one of its best-known and most-popular games, Plinko in honor of the game's 30th anniversary.

The move did not sit well with the Astros, which stated that the filing was made \"improperly\" to prevent the Astros from ending its agreement with CSN Houston; the team also revealed that it did not receive the rights fees from Houston Regional Sports Network (the network's legal name) for the final three months of the 2013 season.[258] 28 Litton Entertainment takes over CBS' Saturday morning lineup with a teen-oriented block of programming bearing the umbrella title CBS Dream Team.

Due to a power failure at South Park Studios, the producers of South Park are unable to make the network deadline for airing the new episode \"Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers\", a first in the series' 17-year run that an episode was not completed in time.
