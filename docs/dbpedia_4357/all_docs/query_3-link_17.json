You may browse availability and options within the video services listing of the IT Service Catalog.\n\nColumbus On-Campus Basic Cable\n\nBasic Cable Service is provided as a standard service in many undergraduate residence halls, and must be ordered in other main campus locations.\n\nCustomers must have Basic Cable and TV equipment with the appropriate QAM tuner/receiver to receive and view the Basic Digital (Free-in-the-Clear) Channels. Customers with an analog TV will need a special digital-to-analog receiver to view these channels. Customers with an older digital or HDTV that does not have a built-in QAM tuner/receiver will need a digital-to-digital receiver to view these channels."
