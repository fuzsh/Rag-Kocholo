        "text": "Rapper Snoop Dogg continued his Summer Games exploits this weekend in the 2024 Paris Olympics. So far he's been one of Team USA's top cheerleaders in gymnastics and went swimming with Olympic legend Michael Phelps.\n\nOn Saturday, he attended equestrian dressage events - in full gear - with longtime TV cohost and friend Martha Stewart in Versailles. The two later were featured in primetime at Le Cinq, a three-Michelin-star restaurant in Paris.\n\nThe duo hosted three seasons of the variety show \"Martha & Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party\" on VH1 from 2016 to 2020. They tried canape, escargot, and more from La Cinq in NBC's clip during primetime.\n\nSnoop Dogg and Martha Stewart take in dressage\n\nThe two had front-row seats for the equestrian team dressage event in Versailles.

German team dressage competitor Isabell Werth became the first athlete to win a medal at seven different Olympic Games. She's won gold in either team or individual dressage in the 1992, 1996, 2000, 2008, 2016, 2020, and 2024 Summer Games.\n\nWhat's next for Snoop Dogg on NBC?\n\nSaturday isn't the last time viewers will see Snoop and Martha in primetime. NBC host Mike Tirico teased more from the two friends for Sunday night in prime time.\n\n\"The dynamic duo was in Versailles in full equestrian attire,\" Tirico said on the broadcast. \"We'll show you how this went tomorrow.\"\n\nParis Olympics 2024: How to watch the Summer Games across TV and streaming\n\nEvery event at the 2024 Paris Olympics will be aired live across NBC, USA Network, E!, CNBC, GOLF Channel, and there will be a Spanish broadcast on Universo and Telemundo.
