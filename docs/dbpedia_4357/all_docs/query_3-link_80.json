        "text": "Editor's note, Aug. 6, 2024: Since this review was written, Sling TV has increased the cost of Sling Blue to $45 and Sling Orange to $40, while Sling Orange & Blue has become $60. Due to ongoing changes in the competitive marketplace, we have removed the Editors' Choice award and will update this review as soon as possible. The following is as it originally ran on Sept. 21, 2021.\n\nLive TV streaming services are designed to replace cable TV by letting you stream live channels over the internet. Yet for the budget-conscious TV viewer, not all services are created equal: For instance, YouTube TV offers a lot of channels but it costs twice as much as the cord-cutter-friendly Sling TV. Starting at $35, Sling TV offers an excellent value with plenty of channels on offer, and it finally looks the business with its new coat of paint.\n\nSling TV is different from rivals because it offers two main plans for the same $35 entry price: Sling Orange and Sling Blue. They share many of the same channels (like CNN, History and TNT) but others are exclusive to one or the other. Sling TV Blue is essentially the Fox and NBC option, while Sling Orange is the ESPN and Disney package.\n\nThe biggest downside to both is that if you want a full slate of local channels -- namely your local ABC, CBS , Fox and NBC stations -- you'll have to augment Sling TV with an over-the-air antenna and even something like the $99 AirTV 2 DVR. While the company recently integrated local streaming startup LoCast into its program lineup the service has since been suspended. Meanwhile, more expensive alternatives such as Hulu Plus Live TV do offer local channels with no antenna required.\n\nIn January this year, Sling TV increased the price on its two main packages from $30 to $35 while also increasing the DVR storage to 50 hours (up from 10). Existing customers got to keep their $30 price until Aug. 1 but now pay the same as newer patrons.\n\nDespite its lack of local channels Sling TV remains my favorite affordable live TV streamer for the money, and the Blue plan in particular is a great deal. Even with that slight price bump you can still save money compared to cable, and Sling TV Blue remains the CNET Editors' Choice as the best budget live TV streaming service.\n\nRead more: YouTube TV vs. Sling TV: Which live TV streaming service is best for you?\n\nWhat is Sling TV, anyway?\n\nSling TV is a subscription service that lets you stream a selection of TV channels live over the internet. The channels are just like the ones offered by cable and satellite TV, but Sling has fewer of them and costs less money every month. You can watch Sling TV on televisions using the Sling TV app on media streamers (like Roku, Amazon Fire TV), smart TV systems LG and Samsung ) and game consoles (Xbox Series S and X), as well as to phones , tablets and computers, no cable box required.\n\nSling TV was the first of its kind, having debuted in 2016, but it now has a bunch of competitors at different prices, including Hulu Plus Live TV, YouTube TV, DirecTV Stream, Philo and FuboTV. For ease of categorization, I've separated these services into budget ($35 and under) and premium (over $50) services. Even with this year's price hike, Sling TV can still be considered a budget service, alongside the $25 Philo (as of Sept. 21, 2021).\n\nOf the two $35 tiers, I believe Sling Blue offers the best deal for most people. It has more channels than Orange and allows up to three people to watch different streams at once, while Sling Orange only allows one stream at a time. You can combine the two Blue and Orange services for $55 a month, but you're only getting five more \"top\" channels than Blue (though this does include ESPN and ESPN 2). If you're already paying that much, then FuboTV ($65) or YouTube TV ($65) are better options as they offer way more channels (including locals) and improved DVRs.\n\nSling is also the only live TV service to offer a bunch of add-on channel packages. You can pay $5 or $10 monthly for packages such as Sports Extra, Comedy Extra, Hollywood Extra, The Best of Spanish TV and more. The channels in each vary depending on whether you have Blue or Orange, and some channels (like Animal Planet and Nickelodeon) are missing completely, but between its Extras and multiple base packages, Sling offers more ways to customize your channel lineup than any of its competitors.\n\nCheck out the chart at the end of this article for all of the top 100 channels Sling's numerous services offer. It's a condensed version of our complete list of the Top 100 channels offered by every service.\n\nSling stays inexpensive by eschewing most local channels. The Blue package has Fox and/or NBC in a handful of major cities but doesn't include any ABC or CBS stations. The Orange package offers no local channels, period. As any cord-cutter knows, local channels are also available by connecting an HD antenna to the back of your television. Sling TV offers another option, however: the AirTV series of over-the-air streamers. The AirTVs connect to an antenna and your network and streams any local channels you receive into the Sling TV interface, integrating them right into Sling's program guide and other areas. You can also connect an external hard drive to the AirTV to record over-the-air channels. Other OTA DVRs are available too, although no others feed into Sling's interface.\n\nWhether you use an AirTV or not, Sling includes a cloud DVR for free that allows you to record almost any streaming channel on the service (the only exceptions are Local Now, ESPN3, ACC Network Extra and SEC Network Plus). It comes with 50 hours of storage but the free version won't let you protect your recorded shows. You have to pay an additional $5 a month for 200 hours of storage and the ability to prevent recordings from becoming automatically erased.\n\nWhat's Sling TV like to use?\n\nUntil now, the user interface has been the worst part of the experience, it simply lacked the sophistication of its rivals. The new menu system looks similar to Disney Plus in that it organizes your content horizontally on the left hand side. While the previous interface had way too many options, the menu has now been whittled down to Search, Home, Guide DVR and On-Demand. It's more aesthetically pleasing in addition to being easier to use.\n\nRegardless of which version you are using -- new or old -- navigation is zippy, and I found it was easy to find the shows I wanted to watch and record. With the multiple discovery screens, including the main Home screen, there was plenty of programming available even when I didn't know what I was in the mood for.\n\nSling has made numerous upgrades to its cloud DVR since launch, such as the bump to 50 hours of recording space. In addition it now allows you to record and live-pause channels you couldn't before, including the Disney and ESPN channels bundled with the Orange packages. Of course, there's also its...\n\nIntegration with AirTV\n\nWhile they're not the most elegant OTA solutions I've seen, the AirTV 2 and higher-end AirTV Anywhere are still solid options for integrating local channels into Sling TV. They will let users tune in to all of the available channels in the area and, in my own tests in New York, I was able to view and record 75-plus different stations.\n\nWhile the AirTV Anywhere incorporates four tuners and an integrated 1 terabyte drive, the AirTV 2 requires a compatible external hard drive to turn it into a DVR. The company says, \"Hard drives must be larger than 50GB, AirTV 2 currently supports recording up to 2TB of storage for DVR.\" I connected a WD 2TB Elements Portable without issue.\n\nDuring my initial tests with the AirTV 2 I was unable to pause live TV, and while I am unable to test the device again, I can confirm that the AirTV Anywhere will enable you to freeze the action for up to 60 minutes.\n\nThe AirTV recorders have one main limitation that stunt their usefulness, however. The AirTV doesn't work on Apple TV or via a browser -- you won't be able to see any of the OTA channels or watch any of the recordings provided by AirTV. To use the tuner, you'll need to use the Sling TV app on Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Android TV, iOS or Android, or via the AirTV mini or AirTV player.\n\nAlso, be aware that the AirTV can't record streaming channels, just local ones, and so you're still limited to either the 50- or 200-hour recording times there.\n\nSetup of the AirTV devices has also been streamlined and users can now access them from within the Sling TV app's settings: It's called Over the Air Channels. There is no longer any need to download a separate app.\n\nShould you subscribe to Sling TV?\n\nWhile you can save some money with Philo ($25), it is definitely worth spending a bit more on Sling TV Blue. The upgrade to the DVR alone makes even the recent $5 upcharge seem justified, especially when other rivals cost almost twice as much. The experience is better than Philo overall; it's zippier and it offers more channels. It's not perfect, but it's getting better as a cable replacement, and it should save you a chunk of change in the long term. In the absence of LoCast just be sure to have a local channel contingency in place before you start."
