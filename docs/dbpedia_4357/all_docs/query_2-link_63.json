        "text": "Many are under the misapprehension that you require a massive 4m dish to receive Sky TV in Turkey and this is indeed true if you want to receive every channel including BBC 1, 2, 3, 4, ITV 2, 3 & 4 etc.\n\nHowever, even with a smaller dish of 90cm you will still get plenty channels with a good selection of Entertainment channels (including ITV 1 and Channel 4 etc) Sports (including Sky Sports & ESPN), Documentaries (Discovery, Animal Planet etc) News (BBC News etc) Music (MTV, VH1etc) and a few Kids channels. You can also receive a good number of Radio channels. I have listed all the channels in one of the attachments as I was unable to put the table on here.\n\nWith a larger dish of 1.8m to 2m you will get even more channels.\n\nThis was tested in Akbuk so should work further West from there and possibly further East.\n\nBefore I continue I would point out that this set up probably doesn’t fall within the rules of Sky i.e use outside the UK / Ireland, but as it involves still paying your subscription they may turn a blind eye. I am not saying it is right or wrong. I am just explaining what can be done.\n\nTo set up you will require a Sky or Sky + box and a Sky viewing card with subscription to the channels you want. If you have a Sky HD box the method of setting up and the channels you receive may vary slightly. Channels will also vary slightly if you have an Irish Sky box.\n\nIf you use your property in Turkey just for holidays you just take out the box, card, cables to join to the TV and remote control that you have in the UK. Even better, if you do not subscribe to the premium Sports channels or can live without sports during your holiday buy a second hand box on ebay for about £20 and leave it in Turkey. If you want Sports you have to take the box back and forward from the UK as cards, which include Sports subscriptions, are tied to a particular box. You can still get all the other channels with that card in any Skybox.\n\nIf you are resident in Turkey you could perhaps ask a friend or relative in the UK to set up a Sky subscription for you with the payments coming from a UK bank by Direct Debit. They could then get the box and card sent out to you. Do not be tempted to use a Sky Multiroom subscription as Sky periodically check these are connected to your UK landline and whilst it may be ok to take that box for a few weeks holiday it will be no use for all year round use.\n\nAnyway, let’s assume you now have your box etc at your Turkish property. Firstly connect the cables between the box and TV and connect the cable from your dish to the box. Your existing dish is likely pointing at another satellite such as Nilesat or Hotbird. You need to get it aligned to Astra 28.2E and your local satellite man should do this for about 20TL. If you want full functionality of Sky + e.g record one programme whilst watching another you will need a dual LNB with a second cable running to the box. With one cable you can still record a programme you are watching or record one programme while you are out.\n\nThe box will not yet work as the default transponder is set to 11778 V. This setting will not work on a 90cm dish in Turkey so will need to be changed. You can change it back when you return to the UK. To do this press Services on your remote the press 4, 0, 1, then Select button and this will bring up the Engineers menu. For a Sky HD box I believe you need to press 0, 0, 1. Press 2 Default Transponder. Change the top line to 12402 and move the cursor to Save New Settings and press Select. The box will now search for Channel Listings. After a few minutes Channel 999 should appear and you should have all the channels listed in the attachment (subject to what you subscribe to). There are a few Free to Air Channels e.g True Entertainment, True Movies, BBC News, several Music Channels etc which you can get even without a card and these are marked with FTA.\n\nIn addition to those listed below there are some channels you can get but not at the usual number on your Sky Channel Listing. These have to be keyed in manually and accessed differently. To add these channels press the Services button then 4 System Set Up then 4 again Add Channels. For example to add Sky Sports 2 change the top line to 12110 line 2 to H and leave the other 2 lines at 27.5 and 2/3. Move the cursor to Find Channels and press Select. Move the cursor to the channel you want (in this case Sky Sports 2) and press the yellow button to store. If there are any other channels on that page you want again move the cursor to the channel you want and press the yellow button. Once you have selected the channels you want press Select to continue and following the above instructions you can add further channels. Bear in mind that some of the channels listed on these pages are duplicates of channels which can be accessed the normal way and therefore you do not need to add them this way. Other popular channels you may wish to add and their settings are in the second attachment.\n\nIn my test Sky Sports 4 worked sometimes but at other times it showed Sky Sports 1.\n\nYou can of course add these channels whilst your system is set up in the UK so that you can access them straight away when you set up in Turkey.\n\nAlthough some of the channels listed above are Free to Air in the UK you will still need a card to add them the above way to view in Turkey.\n\nIf you have a Sky HD box you can also try adding channels using the additional settings in the second attachment. I did not test an HD box so not sure what will work. Note that the Symbol rate and FCC are different for most of the HD channels.\n\nIn the future when you want to watch these channels press the Services button, 0 Other Channels and pick the one you want.\n\nWhen on BBC News, BBC Parliament and BBC Alba you should be able to access the News multiscreen and Sports multiscreen by pressing the red button or Text button and keying 1001 and 3001 respectively. I must admit the News one worked ok but I could not access the Sports one during the test.\n\nIf you do not have the current version of Microsoft Office Excel you may need to use the last 2 attachments. oldfogy confirms that they work with Microsoft Office 2000.\n\nThe first 2 should work fine for those with the current version or at least Excel 2007 onwards.\n\nAttachments\n\nChannels.xls\n\nSky Settings.xls\n\nChannels Sky.xls\n\nSettings Sky.xls\n\nMany are under the misapprehension that you require a massive 4m dish to receive Sky TV in Turkey and this is indeed true if you want to receive every channel including BBC 1, 2, 3, 4, ITV 2, 3 & 4 etc.\n\nHowever, even with a smaller dish of 90cm you will still get plenty channels with a good selection of Entertainment channels (including ITV 1 and Channel 4 etc) Sports (including Sky Sports & ESPN), Documentaries (Discovery, Animal Planet etc) News (BBC News etc) Music (MTV, VH1etc) and a few Kids channels.
