        "text": "This software update FAQ relates to the following products:\n\naSeries, cSeries, eSeries, eS Series, gS Series\n\nPLEASE READ\n\nPlease fully read this page before attempting to update your Raymarine System. This page contains each step for you to sucessfully update your Raymarine system\n\nIMPORTANT TERMS OF DOWNLOADING SOFTWARE\n\nFirmware update processes are done at your own risk. Before initiating the update process be sure to backup and make copies of all important files.\n\nIf the firmware process is interrupted your product may not function properly, therefore do not interrupt the process and ensure the unit is on a reliable power supply. Damage caused by incomplete upgrades will not be covered by Raymarine warranty.\n\nBy Downloading the software, you agree to these terms.\n\nStage 1: Backing Up Your Waypoints, Routes and Tracks (Optional)\n\nIt may be necessary to reset your MFD after the update if there is an issue. Please make sure you take a backup of any important data. However it is always wise to keep a backup of any important data you may have\n\nThe steps for restoring this data to the MFD are also contained in this same FAQs.\n\nNote: A single Flash memory card to both backing up the data within one’s MFD as well as for performing the software update. When using this Flash memory card for backing up the data within one’s MFD, be certain to not insert the memory card into the MFD’s memory card reader/writer until the MFD has been powered up and has completed its startup initialization.\n\nStage 2: Populating the mSD Flash Memory Card with the MFD Software\n\nNote: To avoid potentially corrupting the data on your chart card, DO NOT copy software update files to your chart card and DO NOT back up waypoint/route/track data to your chart card. MicroSD cards are commonly available in most stores selling consumer electronics products. Waypoint, route, track data, and system configuration data can be stored on a microSD memory card which also contains software update files.\n\nYou are NOT required to update the products software versions sequentially. For example, you can go from v6.27 to v14.36\n\nThe mSD (Micro SD) memory cards used with a/c/e/eS/gS Series MFDs should have a memory capacity of no less than 1GB and no more than 32GB.\n\nThe mSD card should be formatted to FAT32. (External link: Instructions)\n\nInsert a compatible Flash memory card into the computer's memory card reader or into a memory card reader which has been interfaced to the computer.\n\nSelect the appropriate software download for your product\n\nUpon completion of the download, click on the downloaded file to open it\n\nCopy all files to the Root of the Flash card (Root is the first level you access when selecting the Flash). Make sure the files are not in any folders on the card\n\n(See video below for examples. Files will vary depending on update)\n\nFor example: if your computer has assigned Removable Disk (E:) to your memory card reader/writer, then the software update files should be copied directly to Removable Disk (E:), not to any folders created on the memory card.\n\nNote: You are only opening the ZIP file that is downloaded. You cannot open the files contained in the ZIP file, these have extensions such as .dob .pkg .sh .sh.sig.iso with various file names. If you attempt to open these files you will see an error as they are designed to update your Raymarine products and not for use in a Windows, Apple or Linux PC.\n\nRemove the memory card from the computer's memory card reader.\n\nPlease note these videos do not have audio\n\nStage 3: The update method\n\nAbout the update\n\nThe a, c, e, eS, gS Series software download now contains the latest version of software for the following peripherals:\n\nAdaptors – ST1-STNG Converter, ECI-100, iTC-5\n\nFishfinders – CP100, CP200, CP370, CP470, CP570\n\nInstruments – i50, i60, i70, iTC-5, p70\n\nPilots – Evolution ACU, Evolution CCU, p70\n\nNote: The included R4 pilot software requires recalibration of the autopilot once complete. Uncheck during the MFD software installation if you are not prepared to recalibrate your pilot at this time.\n\nRMK-9\n\nVHF - Ray50, Ray60, Ray70 (not the 2nd Station Handset)\n\nOnce the Master MFD has updated, any connected MFD or peripheral will be updated as well.\n\nPower ON all Raymarine electronics\n\nTurn off the Master MFD and insert the mSD card containing the software update\n\nPower ON the Master MFD\n\nWait until the screen notifies you that the software update has completed (this can take time, DO NOT power down the display during this procedure)\n\nReboot the unit (c/e Series will do automatically, a/gS Series you need to turn power off to the display) and acknowledge the Usage limitations\n\nAt this point, if you have additional MFD's or any accessories that are eligible to be updated, you will be prompted to update these too.\n\nFollow the onscreen instructions\n\nOnce all the devices in the system are updated, please verify that this is correct by going to the following screen:\n\nChecking the software versions of your Raymarine products\n\nThe MFD's and peripherals software version may be verified via the command sequence:\n\n[Home screen] Setup > Maintenance > Diagnostics > Select Device\n\nPlease note: You will only see Raymarine devices that are connected on SeaTalkNG and RayNet only. Other devices may not be listed\n\nPower on reset (Optional)\n\nHistorically, the Raymarine Technical Support teams have encouraged users to perform the power-on reset (also, known as factory reset, hard reset or master reset) on the Multifunction display products after a software upgrade. This nature of reset is not deemed necessary when upgrading with the Lighthouse II software.\n\nHowever, should you feel there is any reason to perform a reset, you should only have to perform the “Settings Reset” within the menu ([Home screen] Setup > Maintenance > System Settings Reset). This will retain the waypoints/ routes & tracks in the unit. The “Power-on Reset” should only be required if the MFD will not boot correctly and will delete all data (Settings/Waypoints/Routes/Tracks) from your MFD.\n\nc, e, eS Series Power on Reset\n\nTurn the unit off\n\nPress and hold the Back Button\n\nKeeping the Back Button pressed in turn the unit on\n\nAfter the Splash screen you should see a Dark screen, Press the WPT Button (Waypoint) which is the option for Factory Reset\n\nAfter confirmation n that FLOB has been dumped, Press Exit and then restart the unit\n\na, gS Series Power on Reset"
