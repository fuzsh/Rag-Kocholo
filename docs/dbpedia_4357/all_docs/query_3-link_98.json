You can also swap or add/remove extra packs on a whim (at no extra charge), so you may want to try a few out and adjust as needed. The table below includes all the channels available in the starter as well as the top 10 channel packs. The packs are sorted by the following legend:\n\nLocals Pack ($12/mo)\n\nKids Pack ($10/mo)\n\nNews Pack ($10/mo)\n\nRegional Action($12/mo)\n\nNational Action ($10/mo)\n\nVariety Pack ($6/mo)\n\nHeartland Pack ($6/mo)\n\nOutdoor Pack ($4/mo)\n\nStars & Stripes ($10/mo)\n\nLatino Bonus ($10/mo)\n\nFor over 4 decades, DISH Network has been a leader in satellite TV entertainment, and now a growing player in wireless and over-the-top TV.\n\nOur DISH Network rating: 98/100\n\nFrom a fledgling startup (Echostar) to multimedia giant, DISH is doing a solid job of evolving with the digital times. While satellite TV isn't going away anytime soon, DISH smartly expanded into streaming TV with the launch of Sling TV (2015). It's always owned a huge band of wireless spectra and recently began to build out its infrastructure (DISH is now the 4th largest wireless carrier in the U.S.).\n\nBack to satellite TV, DISH has over 8 million customers and still provides a very cost-effective way to watch a ton of channels. If streaming is too restrictive and/or you want plenty of live TV, we routinely recommend DISH to mid to large size families looking for plenty of options."
