        "text": "VH1 (originally an initialism of Video Hits One) is an American pay television network based in New York City owned by Viacom. It was originally created by Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment, at the time a division of Warner Communications and the original owner of MTV, and was launched on January 1, 1985, in the former space of Turner Broadcasting System's short-lived Cable Music Channel.\n\nThe original purpose of the channel was to build upon the success of MTV by playing music videos, but targeting a slightly older demographic than its sister channel, focusing on the lighter, softer side of popular music. More recently, much like MTV, VH1 has been in the area of reality television programming, such as Behind the Music, the I Love... series and the Celebreality block of programming, as part of the channel's current focus on programming primarily aimed towards women.\n\nAs of January 2016, approximately 90.2 million US households receive VH1."
