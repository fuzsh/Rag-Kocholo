Channel HD, Meridian South HD and Yorkshire East HD appear to have been licensed by Ofcom.\n\n1\n\nAccording to a516.digital website local tv station Made TV has teamed up with CBS Reality to show blocks of It's programming on It's network of channels reaching a larger audience. CBS content will be shown from 9am to 11am 1pm to 5pm and 9pm to 2am. Shows will include Judge Judy, Voice and Serial Killer. CBS Reality has taken over the slots true tv occupied.\n\nWhat they should do is strike a deal with a FTA channel that is not on Freeview, say CNN output that for a few hours.\n\nHere in Swansea Bay TV puts out Talking Pictures TV, now that Talking Pictures has launched on its own channel that can now be received in Swansea, don't know how long they will keep that agreement\n\nMade TV have recently relaunched their News programme as Made TV News: Tyne and Wear etc. They have launched an hour long programme at 18:30 called The Big Daily which has replaced The Lowdown and also there is another discussion programme that has been introduced.\n\nI would like more to be done such as a Breakfast programme rather than repeats from the night before etc. It would be nice if, failing any funding for a Breakfast programme, if Made could go along the lines of other local channels and on Made in Tyne and Wear, broadcast Metro Radio at Breakfast time and have a camera in the Metro Radio studio.\n\nI mean, just how long can a channel carry on showing repeats day in, day out of programmes from the previous night between 6/7am and 9am etc. I'm not sure what the viewing figures are like for their Made TV News and The Big Daily but if they are not very high then the ratings will be low in the mornings.\n\nAs for broadcasting CBS reality and I saw that there will be a selwction of shows shown, either that or that CBS Reality is not available widely meaning that it will now be available widely.\n\nAnyway, with limited budgets, what else can channels such as Made TV do?.\n\nThat is why I felt that the Tory way of trying to get people to vote for them was wrong and a dupe, they could have funded the BBC or made ITV regional again. But no, they decided to come up with poorly funded Local TV channels of which some have already failed and it is anyones guess how many years others will be around for.\n\nAlthough I would say from reading about the people behind Made TV, that I don't see that failing and they now operate quite a few channels.\n\n0"
