        "text": "I've seen it once or twice. The first time I saw it was nearly a year ago on Lady Marmalade (from Moulin Rouge), but I've hardly ever seen them. It's only certain videos.\n\n0\n\nYou would think that they would tell you aswell if they had gone to the bother. They could put something in that large white box at the start of the video - like \"subtitles\" or some icon.\n\n0\n\nOriginally posted by dotdashdot\n\nstrange, does anyone know why they go to the trouble of getting some vids subtitled?\n\nFirst of all, do you know what subtitles are for? They are so that hard-of-hearing viewers are able to take part in watching the programme as 'normal' viewers. Hence, this answer your question. However....\n\nMTV broadcasts on ITV Digital as well, therefore it falls to the laws of subtitle requirements. The same applies for the Paramount Comedy Channel.\n\nAt present the requirement is to broadcast a minimum of 50% (unless the channel is less than 2 years old, where it is 30%).\n\nD.B. - when did you see subtitles on VH-1 Classic? As I heard from them recently that they have no plans.\n\nCheers,\n\nMark\n\n0\n\nOriginally posted by MarkBeer\n\nFirst of all, do you know what subtitles are for?

Hence, this answer your question.\n\nThank you for explaining that, although i feel that over emphasising such an obvious fact was unneccessary.\n\nI also understand the requirement of having certain percentages of shows subtitled. the point of my original message was to why in maybe a 3 or 4 hour run of non stop music videos one of them would be subtitled with the lyrics.\n\n0\n\nIt's simply to do with the fact that MTV will only meet the minmum requirment and nothing more (have you noticed that the subtiled ones are shown a lot - a way of meeting the 30% mark?).\n\nThe lower amount of subtitles means they actually lose out more, as less people will notice that they are carrying subtitles. Plus also the fact there is zero amount of information being given to the puiblic as to which videos are actually subtitled.\n\nCheers,\n\nMark\n\n0\n\nOriginally posted by MarkBeer\n\nD.B. - when did you see subtitles on VH-1 Classic? As I heard from them recently that they have no plans.\n\nIt was a while back now - quite a time before they started showing them on MTV. I'm not sure whether the words to the song being shown at the bottom of the screen were actual subtitles put on by VH1, or just lyrics that were part of the video, though a lot of videos actually had the 'subtitles', all in a font similar to the one used on VH1 Classic, so it seemed to me that it was VH1 that wanted subtitles to some songs.\n\n0"
