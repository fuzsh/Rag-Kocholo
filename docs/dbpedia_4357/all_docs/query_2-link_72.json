        "text": "DirecTV Channel Guide\n\nIn this channel guide for Directv, we’ll go over where to find the most popular channels for the satellite provider. We’ve also uploaded a full list of available channels.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that DIRECTV is a satellite provider. Unlike cable companies like Spectrum and Comcast, the channel number for most channels will be the same throughout the country.\n\nWant to save money on your TV bill?\n\nSwitching to Fubo could save you $200+ a year.\n\nThe first month is free and you can cancel any time.\n\nCheck it out by clicking the link below.\n\nDIRECTV Sports Channels\n\nDirectv is most known in terms of sports channels for NFL Sunday Ticket, but regular and premium plans have access to the most popular sports and games you might want to watch.\n\nOne thing that we’ve found is that most of the leagues have their own channels where they place content.\n\nHere’s examples and a list below.\n\nNFL Network: 212\n\nMLB Network: 213\n\nNHL Network: 215\n\nNBA TV: 216\n\nTennis Channel: 217\n\nGolf Channel: 218\n\nESPN has a lot of channels, but we’ve written down the biggest ones below.\n\nESPN: 206\n\nESPN News: 207\n\nESPNU: 208\n\nESPN2: 209\n\nESPN Deportes: 466\n\nFS1 is on Channel 219 on DirecTV while Fox Sports 2 is on Channel 618.\n\nFor college football, other channels besides ESPNU include the ACC Network and the Big Ten Network.\n\nBTN is on Channel 610 while ACC is on Channel 612.\n\nNews/Business Channels\n\nOn the business side, the major channels for DirecTV are Fox Business, CNBC, and Bloomberg.\n\nFox Business is on Channel 359 while Bloomberg TV is on Channel 353.\n\nCNBC has two channels – 355 for CNBC and 357 for CNBC World.\n\nIf you watch Fox News, you generally don’t watch MSNBC.\n\nMore conservative-leaning outlets include Fox News and Newsmax. The correct channel for Fox News on Directv is 360 and 349 is the channel for Newsmax.\n\nFor those with a more liberal slant, go to Channel 356 for MSNBC or Channel 202 for CNN.\n\nCNN is also available on Channel 358 as CNN International and 419 as CNN En Espanol.\n\nGuide To Movie Channels On Directv\n\nThere are premium and nonpremium movie channels included in your TV subscription to Directv. This doesn’t include regular channels where movies will sometimes be available.\n\nSome of the free channels that focus on movies include FXM, TCM, and The Movie Channel.\n\nFX Movies is on Channel 258 while Turner Classic Movies (TCM) is on 256.\n\nThe Movie Channel has an east and west channel – 553 for East and 554 for West.\n\nThere’s also a paid movie tier called the Movies Extra Pack. It has channels like Sony Movies and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries.\n\nCheck out where you can watch these channels.\n\nKids & Cartoon Channels\n\nThe big channel groups for cartoons and for kids are Cartoon Network, the Disney Channel, and Nickelodeon.\n\nCartoon Network has two channels – 269 and 297 for the East and West Coast. This just means that you have more options for what shows to watch.\n\nDisney has a similar grouping with their Western Channel being on 291 while its Eastern Channel is on 290.\n\nThey also have smaller channels like Disney Junior on Channel 289 and Disney XD on Channel 292.\n\nNickelodeon has a huge number of channels. I’m just going to list them below – that’s going to be the easiest way to find what you’re looking for.\n\nMusic Channels On Directv\n\nIf you want to listen to some good music on your TV, DIRECTV has some channels where that’s possible.\n\nThe major ones are BET, CMT, and MTV.\n\nCMT is for country music and the right channel is 327 while BET is for hip hop and you can watch videos on Channel 329.\n\nFor more classic tunes, check out VH1 or MTV Classic. VH1 is located on channel 335 while MTV Classic is on Channel 336.\n\nThe leader in the space MTV is on Channel 331 and there’s a second channel called MTV2 on 332.\n\nDirectv Local Channel Guide\n\nOne of the more complicated channels to find on Directv is the broadcast channels.\n\nUnlike most entertainment channels, these channels will be on different channel numbers depending on where you live.\n\nDirectv actually doesn’t have these channels in their channel guide so a lot of the time you’re on your own.\n\nWhat we’ve found in our experience is that these channels have lowered numbered channels that are all over the place and a high numbered channel which you can find throughout the country.\n\nFox is available on channels 398 and 399 while you can watch CBS on 390 and 391.\n\nFor NBC, you’ll need to go to Channel 392 and for ABC your options are 396 and 397.\n\nThe CW and PBS are like the broadcast channels in being on multiple channels on Directv.\n\n394 and 395 are the right channels for CW and 389 is the place to go for PBS.\n\nIf you want lowered number channels, we’ve found those for you below.\n\nWhat Channel Is ABC On DirecTV\n\nCBS DirecTV Channels\n\nDirecTV Fox Channel Guide\n\nNBC Channel List\n\nPBS Channel Overview\n\nCW Tips\n\nPremium Channel Directv\n\nWhile it’s awesome that you can stream premium cable channels now, there are some people who would prefer to watch HBO and Showtime on their TV.\n\nThe big premium cable channels are HBO, Cinemax, STARZ, and Cinemax.\n\nAll of these premium cable channels have multiple channels in a tight range where you can watch their latest content but there are primary channels.\n\nFor HBO, there’s HBO East and HBO West on 501 and 504 respectively. Showtime East is on Channel 545 and Showtime West is on Channel 546.\n\nThe right channel for Cinemax is 516 in the East and 516 in the West. STARZ is on 525.\n\nEntertainment Channels\n\nDirectv customers have options to watch some great entertainment channels on their TV.\n\nOur favorites are the Paramount Network on Channel 241 and the Lifetime Channel on Channel 252.\n\nFor the rest, look out below!\n\nLower Your TV Bill With Fubo!\n\nTo wrap it up, we’ve combined all the lists and channels so you can find whatever channel you’re looking for on your DirecTV subscription.\n\nTired of overpaying on your phone and cable bills?\n\nIf you want to save money and get more channels, try out Fubo.\n\nThey have channels like NFL Network and GAC that aren’t in all DirecTV packages.\n\nClick the link below to get started."
