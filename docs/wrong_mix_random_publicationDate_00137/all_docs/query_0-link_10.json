        "text": "Director David Esbjornson's cast for the Atlantic Theater Company production will also include Patricia Conolly, Lisa Emery, Zach Grenier, Samantha Soule and Libby Woodbridge.\n\nOpening night is May 13. According to ATC notes, \"Gabriel is set around a largely forgotten moment in British history — the German occupation of the Channel Islands during World War II. A naked young man washes up on a Guernsey beach. Unnervingly handsome and fluent in both German and English, he has no recollection of who he is — patriot or Nazi…innocent or madman. Gabriel explores the heart of memory, identity and imagination, as well as the lies people tell themselves and each other to make the darkness light again.\"\n\nGabriel will play a limited engagement through June 6 at ATC's Linda Gross Theater, 336 W. 20th Street.\n\nThe 1997 world premiere production of Buffini's Gabriel was awarded the U.K.'s prestigious London Weekend Television Plays on Stage Award and the Meyer Whitworth Award. Her play Dinner, commissioned by the National Theatre, was nominated for an Olivier Award for Best New Comedy and was recently staged at The Bay Street Theatre in a production starring Mercedes Ruehl. Her latest screenplay, an adaptation of the U.K. comic strip \"Tamara Drewe,\" will be directed by Stephen Frears.\n\nConolly recently appeared on Broadway in Is He Dead? and at Lincoln Center in The Coast of Utopia trilogy. Obie Award winner Emery was nominated for a 2009 Lortel Award for Distracted Off-Broadway. Grenier was nominated for a 2009 Tony Award for his performance as Beethoven in 33 Variations on Broadway. Rosen makes his Off-Broadway debut following appearing in the Fringe Festival production of A Contemporary American's Guide to a Successful Marriage and in Wet at the Summer Play Festival. Soule returns to Atlantic after starring in The Voysey Inheritance and most recently appearing on Broadway in The Philanthropist. A recent graduate of Boston University, Woodbridge will make her New York theatrical debut. The creative team for Gabriel will feature scenic design by Riccardo Hernandez, costume design by Martin Pakledinaz, lighting design by Scott Zielinski and sound design by Obadiah Eaves.\n\nGabriel will play Tuesday through Friday at 8 PM, Wednesday at 2 PM, Saturday at 2 PM and 8 PM and Sundays at 3 PM.\n\nTickets are $65 and available by calling Ticket Central at (212) 279-4200 (ticketcentral.com).\n\nFor more information, visit www.atlantictheater.org."
