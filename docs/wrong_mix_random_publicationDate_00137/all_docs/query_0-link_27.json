        "text": "Special Group and Uber Eats have set a pretty high bar for themselves with their work for the Australian Open in the last few years, particularly with the TV-hacking (and Cannes Lions-winning) 'Ambush' campaign of 2019.\n\nThis year, the duo has developed a trio of choose-your-own-adventure stories starring players Ash Barty and Nick Kyrgios, as well as commentator Todd Woodbridge. Each star appears in a 30-second ad (running online and broadcast) that sets up a situation: Barty experiences a blackout, Kyrgios starts to lose his temper at the umpire, and Woodbridge loses his voice. The spots end with QR codes that lead to three different online films, each exploring what happens when the star chooses to receive a different item via Uber Eats. In one, Barty asks for batteries. In another, Kyrgios decides to relax with an on-court bubble bath.\n\nWhile all this might be less impressive to jaded adland folk than the 'Ambush', it's a lot of fun. Kudos to Special Group and the participants for pushing the spots into delightfully bizarre territory. The Woodbridge series is particularly absurd (one might even say it's 'Todding awesome').\n\nAd Nut has enjoyed all of this so much that Ad Nut wants you to as well, so Ad Nut has gone to the trouble of providing all 12 videos for you here (each player below will automatically show you all four spots). Enjoy.\n\nAsh Barty:\n\nNick Kyrgios:\n\nTodd Woodbridge:\n\nThe campaign began with the Open on January 17 and runs for three weeks. It include TV, social, online and OOH, as well as reactive social content (created by Hello Social) during the tennis.\n\nCREDITS\n\nCLIENT: Uber Eats\n\nSENIOR DIRECTOR, HEAD OF APAC MARKETING: Lucinda Barlow\n\nMARKETING DIRECTOR ANZ: Andy Morley\n\nHEAD OF MARKETING UBER EATS ANZ: David Griffiths\n\nCULTURE LEAD: Josh Pickstone\n\nBRAND LEAD: Channa Goonasekara\n\nCOMMUNICATIONS LEAD: Nick Vindin\n\nANZ MEDIA LEAD: Louisa Chu\n\nAPAC STRATEGY LEAD: Ally Doube\n\nAPAC SOCIAL LEAD: Isaac Lai\n\nGLOBAL CREATIVE DIRECTOR: Viktor Jacobsson\n\nAGENCY: SPECIAL\n\nCCO/PARTNERS: Tom Martin & Julian Schreiber\n\nAPAC CREATIVE DIRECTORS: Max McKeon & Sarah Parris\n\nCREATIVE TEAM / CREATIVE DIRECTORS: Jade Manning & Vince Osmond\n\nCREATIVE TEAM: Cat Williams & Jessica Roberts\n\nCREATIVE TECHNOLOGIST: Laurent Marcus\n\nCEO/PARTNERS: Lindsey Evans & Cade Heyde\n\nHEAD OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT: Tori Lopez\n\nBUSINESS DIRECTOR: Liam Walker\n\nBUSINESS MANAGER: Maddie Armstrong\n\nGROUP STRATEGY DIRECTOR: Celia Garforth\n\nSENIOR STRATEGIST : Kellie Box\n\nHEAD OF FILM PRODUCTION: Sevda Cemo\n\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCER: Wendy Gillies\n\nINTEGRATED PRODUCER: Stephanie Wilkinson\n\nSTILLS PRODUCERS: Sonia Ebrington & Emily Willis\n\nDIGITAL PRODUCER: Stacey Szabo\n\nCASTING DIRECTOR: Emily Stewart\n\nSOCIAL LEAD: Lachlan Stewart\n\nSOCIAL SPECIALIST: Sarah Mckie\n\nPRODUCTION COMPANY: SCOUNDREL\n\nDIRECTOR: James Dive\n\nPRODUCER: Jules Shelton\n\nDOP: Danny Ruhlman\n\nCASTING:\n\nSydney - Leon @ i4casting\n\nBrisbane - Michelle @ Ben Parkinson Casting\n\nPOST PRODUCTION: The Editors\n\nEDITORS: Stu Morley / Mark Burnett\n\nCOLOURIST: Andy Clarkson\n\nHEAD OF PRODUCTION: Liv Reddy\n\nSOUND: Rumble Studios\n\nSOUND ENGINEER: Tone Aston / Cam Milne\n\nMUSIC SUPERVISOR: Adam Moses\n\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCER: Michael Gie\n\nPHOTOGRAPHY: The Pool Collective\n\nPHOTOGRAPHER: Sean Izzard\n\nMANAGING DIRECTORr: Cameron Gray\n\nPRODUCTION COORDINATOR: Zoe Izzard\n\nREACTIVE CONTENT AND COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT: Hello Social\n\nMANAGING DIRECTOR: Sam Kelly\n\nDIRECTOR OF CX / CLIENT LEAD: Maddie Marovino\n\nMEDIA AGENCY: Mediacom\n\nGROUP CLIENT DIRECTOR: Lynsey Mogridge\n\nASSOCIATE INVESTMENT DIRECTOR: Patrick Fakiye"
