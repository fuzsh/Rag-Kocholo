        "text": "Australian tennis great Mark Woodforde has spilled details about his non-existent relationship with former doubles partner Todd Woodbridge.\n\nSpeaking on the Soda Room podcast with 7NEWS’ Mark Soderstrom, Woodforde said the pair “don’t have a lot to talk about these days” and the relationship breakdown “absolutely cuts” him.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: Alexander Bublik obliterates three racquets in all-time tennis meltdown\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\nWoodforde and Woodbridge, affectionately known as the ‘Woodies’, enjoyed great success during their careers as the dynamic duo combined to win 11 grand slam doubles titles, 61 ATP doubles tournaments, a Davis Cup and an Olympic gold medal.\n\nHowever, in a sad development, it was revealed a few years ago that the pair do not speak to each other with Woodforde recently revealing new details about their non-existent relationship.\n\n“We don’t have a lot to talk about these days,” Woodforde said.\n\n“I would love to be able to play some more of the legends events together, but it’s just at a position … it is where it is right now.\n\n“For someone you could rely upon for as many years and have great fun and success and joy with, to be at this stage now, it’s really hurtful – I’m still the same person.”\n\nWoodforde revealed that he would “without a doubt” want to mend the relationship with his former tennis partner.\n\nWoodforde is believed to be hurt by Woodbridge’s decision to team up with Sweden’s Jonas Bjorkman on the legends tour instead of him.\n\n“Todd’s elected to move on and play with Jonas Bjorkman in some of the legends doubles events, who he played with once I retired,” Woodforde said in 2020.\n\n“He developed a partnership with Jonas and they had success together, but not anywhere near on the same level as the Woodies.”\n\nThe ‘Woodies’ team began in 1990 and initially struggled on the court, however it didn’t take them long to find success.\n\n“The first tournament we didn’t do so well. It was abysmal … we lost first round. We got our butts kicked so badly we were thinking ‘yeah, there’s nothing really here between us’,” Woodforde said.\n\n“But the second tournament, that very first match, we beat a seeded team. There was something there. We just kind of walked off and we were like ‘hey, this is pretty good.’\n\n“We actually changed back to our original sides, me being the left-hander on the ad(vantage) court, Todd the righty on the first court. It just flowed. It flowed for a number of other matches that week. We ended up losing in the semis, which wasn’t a bad loss.\n\n“But our coach and a trainer at the time, they saw something on the sidelines as well.”\n\nYour cookie settings are preventing this third party content from displaying.\n\nIf you’d like to view this content, please adjust your .\n\nTo find out more about how we use cookies, please see our Cookie Guide."
