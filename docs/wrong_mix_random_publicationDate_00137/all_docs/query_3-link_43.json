        "text": "For a man who has never smoked, barely drinks, and describes himself as “boring”, the new chief executive of Seven West Media, Jeff Howard, clearly likes a bit of drama.\n\nA numbers man, and Seven’s former CFO, Howard has held the scythe as it swung through the upper management of the steadily declining broadcaster. It takes guts to sack your colleagues – chief sales officer (Kurt Burnette), chief marketing officer (Melissa Hopkins), sport sales chief (Lewis Martin) – and green-light both a company-wide restructure and wholesale regime replacement in the newsroom under Stokes whisperer Anthony De Ceglie."
