        "text": "Cricket fans were left baffled on Thursday night when they tuned into Channel Nine’s coverage of the Ashes.\n\nBut it had nothing to do with what was happening on the field.\n\nWhen the coverage kicked off half an hour before the first ball, fans were stunned to see none other than Aussie tennis tennis legend Todd Woodbridge hosting.\n\nWoodbridge did a fine job and seemed to know what he was talking about, but viewers were very confused nonetheless.\n\nFormer Aussie cricketer Jamie Cox tweeted: “So how’d we get Todd Woodbridge hosting the cricket?”\n\nChannel Seven journo Dean Felton was particularly bemused, mocking Woodbridge’s cricket expertise in a series of tweets.\n\n“Test cricket veteran Todd Woodbridge expects England to take the new ball after nine games, or seven if it was used during the warmup,” he tweeted.\n\n“Former Ashes skipper Todd Woodbridge wonders if Steve Smith’s game might be better suited to clay,” he said in another tweet.\n\nWith Nine and Seven switching their coverage of the cricket and tennis this year, Seven and Fox Sports have all the former cricket greats working in commentary.\n\nSome suggested Woodbridge was all Nine had left.\n\nWoodbridge ‘privileged’ to be hosting\n\nWoodbridge said he’d grown up watching cricket and felt privileged to host Channel Nine’s coverage.\n\n“Like most Australians, I grew up watching the cricket on our screens every year,” Woodbridge said.\n\n“Hosting something as iconic as The Ashes is a real privilege, and I can’t wait to work with some of the legends of Aussie cricket.”\n\nAnd it wasn’t all negative, with many praising Woodbridge’s work."
