        "text": "The tennis player takes on new challenges after leaving the court.\n\nEighteen months after Todd Woodbridge's abrupt retirement from the global tennis circuit, the former doubles champion says he still loves the game and plays a couple of times a week.\n\n\"A lot of people get out [of the sport] and don't care if they never hit another ball,\" says Woodbridge, 35, who is a commentator for Channel Seven at the Australian Open.\n\n\"I don't miss playing because I know the effort you have to put in to play at that level. But I've always loved the tactical part of it and that's what I try to bring to the commentary.\"\n\nWoodbridge, who now lives in Melbourne, is also coaching some elite young players at Melbourne Park and working with the Australian Open marketing team to learn about the infrastructure of staging the event.\n\nWould he like to run the Australian Open? \"I'm sure if I show talent there might one day be an opportunity,\" says Woodbridge, who learned about the politics of the game during stints as president and vice-president of the Players' Association. \"I enjoy being around my sport.\"\n\nDuring his 17-year professional career, Woodbridge won a world record 83 ATP men's doubles titles - 61 of them in the 10-year \"Woodies\" partnership with Mark Woodforde. Their tally included 11 grand slam titles, most notably five straight Wimbledon men's doubles titles from 1993 to 1997.\n\nWhen Woodforde retired after the Sydney Olympics in 2000, Woodbridge formed a new partnership with Swede Jonas Bjorkman and amassed a further five Grand Slam titles. But his next partnership, with India's Mahesh Bhupathi, was less successful and, after the pair was bundled out of the 2005 Wimbledon second round, Woodbridge announced his immediate retirement.\n\n\"I retired earlier than I thought I would but I wasn't getting the successes I was used to,\" says Woodbridge, who estimates he may have played another 12 or 18 months if things were going well. \"It felt like things were getting out of control and I like to be in control.\"\n\nAfter spending at least 35 weeks away from home each year, Woodbridge took five months off to enjoy the simple things like dropping his two children at pre-school, playing golf twice a week (his handicap is down to seven) and watching a bit of television. \"I felt relieved,\" he says. \"For the first time I could unpack my bags and put them in the attic.\"\n\nWoodbridge had wanted to be a professional tennis player from the age of seven, focusing on two dreams: to play Davis Cup for Australia and to play at Wimbledon. His mother played in local tennis tournaments and Woodbridge started competitions at 6 .\n\nHe won each of the under 12, 14, 16 and 18 Australian doubles titles twice, and was also ranked the No. 2 junior singles player in the world at age 18. Although he's best known for his doubles career, Woodbridge points out that he was a top 40 singles player for eight years (reaching the Wimbledon singles semi-final in 1997) and only quit playing singles at age 30.\n\nAs for his most memorable tennis experience, Woodbridge nominates the Sydney Olympics in 2000, where he and Woodforde won a silver medal. \"Every time we walked out onto court it was like a carnival. It felt like we were riding a wave.\"\n\nThe big questions\n\nBiggest break Going to the Australian Institute of Sport in 1985. It had the best coaching and facilities and if I was good enough it gave me the chance to really pursue my sport.\n\nBiggest achievement Winning an Olympic gold medal at Atlanta in 1996 and becoming a Wimbledon champion, the first time [in 1993, partnering Mark Woodforde]. If you can say, 'I'm the Wimbledon champion', you've made it.\n\nBiggest regret I don't have any, honestly I don't. I feel like I've got the best out of everything so far.\n\nBest investment Financially, I invested the first decent amount of prize money I won in an apartment in Cronulla. I was about 19. If anything happened in my career, I knew I'd have a roof over my head. Personally, my best investment has been investing in my own ability, backing myself. I never skimped on getting the best coach and trainer.\n\nWorst investment Building our dream home in America [Orlando, Florida]. We ended up moving back to Australia two years later because we wanted our kids to grow up here. We didn't lose money on it but we would have been better off putting all that time and effort in here.\n\nAttitude to money At times you have to spend money to make money.\n\nPersonal philosophy/motto Do everything as thoroughly as you can. I don't like leaving things half done."
