        "text": "Last week, I wrapped another session of teaching a Business & Entrepreneurship class in Berkeley to a group of very talented, smart and motivated high school students. One of my favorite questions that a member of the class asked me on the last day was \"What would you go back and tell your high school self now?\" My answer: \"Don't sweat the small stuff - or anything, really. The days or moments that seem bad are just a blip on the radar, and in the grand scheme of things, aren't really that bad at all. Every setback is a learning lesson - which means that it isn't really a setback at all. It's an opportunity. And don't feel like you have to have your whole life mapped out; I'm in my 40's and I still don't (just please don't tell my Mom that; she thinks I have it all figured out)\". And btw, I try to remind my present day self of those words all the time. What would each of you share with your high school selves? I'll share your thoughts with the class. Thanks so much to Claudine Jones for bringing me back for another summer of teaching. And thank you to Cecile Murias, Reggie Williams, David Mandelbrot, Chris McGill, Ben Lee, Rose Ferraro and Ronal Bhagat for adding their wisdom and life lessons to the class. I appreciate all of you!\n\nAn AI PS2 filter craze is taking over! ‚ùì A trend using AI image generation software to digitally edit pictures to make the subjects appear as Playstation 2 video game characters has seen an enormous spike in popularity in recent weeks, with people turning everything from Dua Lipa to random TikTokers into their respective video game versions. A full rundown of the filter and how to use it yourself can be found on Know Your Meme: https://bit.ly/49iEVr6 üìà AI technology is progressing incredibly quickly, and it seems like each month there is some new AI toy to play with. Memes and internet culture move in tandem with technological progression, so it's no surprise that AI-related memes are experiencing a huge moment online. üéµ Another AI application that made the meme rounds this month is Suno AI's music generation software, that allows users to create songs about nearly anything in just about any style they can think of. Just enter a prompt like \"Notorious B.I.G. rapping about Skidibi Toilet\" and boom, you have the next hip hop masterpiece. Think you have what it takes to generate the next AI meme hit? #memeoftheday #mememarketing #memes #knowyourmeme\n\nA 20+ year old beer commercial is back in the news... ‚ùì Over the last week, a series of Chilean commercials for the beer brand Cerveza Cristal from back in 2003 have seen an enormous resurgence on social media. The internet found the ads absolutely hilarious, as they were stitched with various iconic scenes from the Star Wars trilogy. üì∫ The commercials were originally aired in 2003 and 2004 on the Chilean television channel Canal 13, which frequently broadcast the Star Wars films. Ads for the beer brand were spliced directly into scenes from the film, with a man loudly singing the brand's theme song. üåü This recent surge in popularity hit the Spanish language web in February with a tweet from X user @OutOfContxtDubs, and then the English speaking web with a post by X user @heyitswendy. Even Stephen Colbert got in on the action this week, bringing out a bottle of the alcoholic beverage on \"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.\" üìà The @heyitswendyt post gained over 37.5 million views on X over the last week, sparking the enormous surge in popularity we're seeing right now. While there isn't any publicly available data yet, we've seen that it's very common for sales to explode when a company's products go viral in memes (classic example: memes around Old Spice's \"The Man Your Man Could Smell Like\" campaign were shown to have materially impacted sales). I'm headed to the grocery store right now for some Cerveza Cristal. Who's joining me for a drink?! #memeoftheday #mememarketing #memes #knowyourmeme\n\nSometimes a job is more than a job. Last week, I had the honor and pleasure of visiting my team in Israel - my first time back since the horrors of October 7th. Israel has always held a special place in my heart. I spent every day of every summer of my life there from age 0 to 13, visiting my grandparents - both Holocaust survivors. When I took this job at Literally Media, I was impressed by the business, impressed by the people and the culture, and driven by the excitement in my belly that life would come full circle for me - and that I‚Äôd reunite with a piece of my life that played a big role in shaping who I am today. This job has done that in a big way. Our offices are an 8 minute drive away from my grandparents‚Äô home, walking distance to their cemetery, and so close to a lot of fond memories I‚Äôve had since childhood. My visit last week re-exposed me to all of Israel‚Äôs beauty - the people, the scenery, the food, the strength and solidarity of the nation. I continue to be thankful to Jacob Nizri and the Literally Media team for allowing me to reconnect with my roots and heritage in such a meaningful way. This experience has deepened my connection to my work and is a powerful reminder that we often find strength and purpose in the most personal aspects of our lives, which in turn, enriches our professional journey and the communities we serve.\n\nLast week's biggest meme: Google sunsetting Gmail hoax. The backstory: ‚ùì On Thursday last week, a rumor surfaced that Google was going to shut down its wildly popular email service after a fake email screenshot was circulated widely on places like X/Twitter. üë®üé® The hoax was orchestrated by a digital artist named Shl0ms, who stated the hoax was intended to be performance art to raise awareness about \"societal over-reliance on centralized systems by corporations that frequently make user hostile decisions\" üìà What made it so hot? The hoax was perpetuated amid the viral discussions about Google's new Gemini AI release, which had garnered a public backlash due to controversial images and prompt results. Hoaxes like this commonly go viral on social media (Know Your Meme has over 700 entries documenting various internet hoaxes) and they often appear to be surprisingly simple to execute. Did anyone see this and fall for it? #mondaymeme #memeoftheday"
