        "text": "Australian tennis great Todd Woodbridge believes Alex de Minaur is playing better than ever and can launch a career-best Australian Open run to the semi-finals.\n\nWoodbridge, a 22-time grand slam doubles champion, commentated on de Minaur’s stunning United Cup victory over world No. 1 Novak Djokovic for Channel Nine on Wednesday night and was left in no doubt about the Sydneysider’s bona fides.\n\n“The draw’s important, and he needs to be in the right section, but that goes for every one of those top players,” Woodbridge said of 12th-ranked de Minaur.\n\n“But can he get to a semi? Yes, he can. Alex has traditionally played quite well at this time of year, in Sydney and the United Cup, but he is in a position, ranking-wise, where he can give himself a better schedule in the week before the Open.\n\n“You can see everything in his game is incrementally getting better, and no one on tour puts in more effort, day in, day out, than he does, and he is building an aura among tour players that if you’re a little off your game or not prepared to dig in, you won’t beat him.”\n\nThe 6-4, 6-4 defeat of Djokovic, who sprayed an uncharacteristic 33 unforced errors, comes nearly 12 months after the Serbian legend dismantled the Sydneysider 6-2, 6-1, 6-2 in barely two hours in the fourth round of the Australian Open.\n\nIt was Djokovic’s first loss in Australia in six years, snapping an incredible 43-match streak of dominance, after which he said an existing wrist problem hindered his forehand and serve most.\n\n“It feels amazing. It’s hard to put into words. It’s a very good feeling,” de Minaur said. “Everything that could have gone well, went well. I’m happy that I can say I got a win over the GOAT.”\n\nDe Minaur’s giddiness in victory contrasted with Djokovic, who said besides obvious disappointment about any defeat, it would not “stay with me much”.\n\nLoading\n\nThe 24-time major winner has battled several injuries before and during Australian Open title campaigns, including an abdominal tear in 2021 and a hamstring setback last year, but was unconcerned about his wrist.\n\n“I have enough time to get myself in the right shape for the Australian Open, and that’s what matters the most at this point,” Djokovic said.\n\n“I think I’ll be OK, to be honest. I knew that I probably wasn’t going to be at my 100 per cent physically, emotionally, mentally, game-wise, in the opening week of a season.\n\n“Neither did I expect that. Neither did I want that, to be honest. It’s all a part of the build-up for the Australian Open. That’s where I want to perform at my best.”\n\nDjokovic long ago perfected how to peak for grand slams, whereas de Minaur – for all his improvement in a standout season last year – still needs to prove himself at the sport’s highest level.\n\nThe 24-year-old has reached just one quarter-final from 25 majors, at the COVID-19-weakened US Open in 2020, while he blew a two-sets-to-love lead against Cristian Garin in their last-16 clash at Wimbledon two years ago.\n\nDe Minaur’s rivals tend to overwhelm him with power on those stages, from Djokovic at the AO, to Matteo Berrettini at Wimbledon, Daniil Medvedev in New York and Jannik Sinner in the Davis Cup final.\n\n“He’s aware he has to keep beefing up his game,” Woodbridge said. “But he’s physically starting to do that, and you can see his legs are getting stronger, and he’s maturing into a bigger frame, which he needs to do to absorb and create his own power.\n\n“He physically probably won’t be at his best until he’s 27, 28 or 29, but he’s building a body that’s strong and robust enough to give him an opportunity to achieve victories at bigger tournaments.”\n\nLoading\n\nDe Minaur said after his second Newcombe Medal triumph last month that improving his slam record was a priority: “We want to be among the top 10 players in the world and play the second weeks of slams – and really the end of slams – so that is a big goal of mine.”\n\nThe Djokovic result delivered de Minaur back-to-back top-10 scalps at the United Cup, following his comprehensive 6-4, 6-2 beat down of American Taylor Fritz two days earlier.\n\nThat puts him on track to match his six such victories last year, including Rafael Nadal at last year’s United Cup, after three top-10 triumphs in 2022, none in 2021, one in 2020 and three in 2019.\n\nDe Minaur’s career-high tally came amid what was easily his best season on tour: a first ATP 500 title in Acapulco, Mexico, a maiden Masters 1000 final in Toronto, Canada, two other finals (Queen’s and Los Cabos), and performing an integral role in Australia advancing to the Davis Cup decider.\n\n“He clearly believes he doesn’t have a ceiling, and he’s already No. 12 in the world and beating top 10 and top 20 guys consistently,” Woodbridge said.\n\n“What a lot of tennis players and athletes forget is you have to put yourself in that position every day to give yourself a chance when it arises. More importantly, the weaknesses are improving – his forehand has more shape, and his serve is technically better and has more pop.\n\n“Alex also looks in a comfortable space on and off court, and his relationship with [fellow player] Katie Boulter seems to be helping both of them. His tennis is the best he’s ever played, and ultimately the opportunity awaits.”\n\nWatch the United Cup and Brisbane International tennis live and free on the 9Network with every match streaming live on 9Now and ad-free on Stan Sport."
