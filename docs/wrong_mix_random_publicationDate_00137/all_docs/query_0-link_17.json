        "text": "Channel 9 has confirmed it is set to provide viewers an early look at its brand new game show format, TIPPING POINT AUSTRALIA.\n\nThe new game show, which is seen as a key component for reviving Channel 9’s fortunes in 2024 is now set to premiere in a special 7pm primetime presentation on Christmas Eve just before Carols By Candlelight commences at 8pm.\n\nCarols By Candlelight is traditionally a ratings blockbuster for the network and Channel 9 will be hoping plenty of viewers become addicted to Tipping Point, which is set to replace Hot Seat airing before the 9News in 2024.\n\nTipping Point Australia stands out with its unique ‘endgame’ segment, which offers a substantial $40,000 prize. This addition is expected to add an extra layer of excitement to the conclusion of each episode as it looks to compete with current ratings wiiner The Chase on Channel 7\n\nAs revealed earlier this year by TV Blackbox, the Australian version of this global game show phenomenon will be hosted by the Australian sporting icon, Todd Woodbridge. The show marks the Australian adaptation of the popular UK game show, Tipping Point.\n\nChannel 9 filmed 10 episodes of the new series in the UK featuring expat Australian contestants before commissioning a full-season filmed in Melbourne. It’s understood over 100 episodes have now been filmed with production continuing at an express pace.\n\nThe format involves three contestants answering general knowledge questions to win counters.\n\nThese counters are then used in a large, arcade-style coin pusher machine. Contestants from across Australia will compete not only for cash prizes but also for various mystery prizes, all while attempting to outsmart the machine.\n\nThe show promises to deliver edge-of-your-seat excitement, as contestants vie for the impressive jackpot. The question remains: who will reach their Tipping Point and claim the grand cash prize?\n\nTIPPING POINT AUSTRALIA is produced by Endemol Shine Australia, a subsidiary of Banijay, specifically for the 9Network. This new venture is poised to become a staple in Australian television, offering viewers an engaging and thrilling game show experience.\n\nTIPPING POINT AUSTRALIA premieres Christmas Eve, Sunday December 24 at 7pm on Channel 9 and 9Now"
