        "text": "\"He came to my room and told me face to face,\" said Woodbridge. \"He said he was a bit uncertain about my future. I've only been playing a three-quarter schedule the last few years because it wasn't worth going to some tournaments when it cost more to go than I could make from playing.\"\n\nBut the news still came as a shock to Woodbridge, who was disappointed he did not have a chance to put his case to Bjorkman before he made his decision.\n\nHaving won five grand slam titles together, Woodbridge had his eye on a fourth consecutive Wimbledon crown - which would be his 10th overall. And a French Open title would have completed a career grand slam for the pair, who had made more than US$500,000 ($645,753) annually in prizemoney and been ranked no lower than No. 3 in their four seasons together.\n\n\"To be honest I really don't know what he is thinking,\" says Woodbridge. \"It is very disappointing to throw the chance to achieve some pretty special things away. I'm not bitter about it. I still respect him. But I'm disappointed he has thrown that opportunity away.\"\n\nWoodbridge says the thought of retirement immediately crossed his mind. He bought a house in Melbourne this year and would love to spend more time there with his two children, aged four and two. And while 33 is not quite the spinster stage in doubles terms, it is an advanced age to be \"out there\" looking for a new partner.\n\nBut with the support of his wife Natasha, he decided he was not ready to put his racquet away and began thinking of new combinations. Davis Cup teammate Wayne Arthurs came to mind, but he has a steady relationship with Paul Hanley and is also nursing a rib injury.\n\nThen came the news that another lonely heart, Indian Mahesh Bhupathi, was available. So Woodbridge made a call and a new team was born.\n\nThere is some poignancy to the new combination. Bhupathi was dumped by Mirnyi so that he could play with Bjorkman. So, next season, any match between the jilted pair Woodbridge-Bhupathi and their former partners Bjorkman-Mirnyi will be keenly anticipated. \"I think we will all be going for it,\" agreed Woodbridge. \"But we would be doing that anyway.\"\n\nA further twist in the tangled saga of the doubles teamings is that Bjorkman and Bhupathi will play together at a tournament in Chennai before Woodbridge and Bhupathi begin their permanent double act at the Sydney International. Woodbridge did not want to go to India and Bhupathi was eager to play at home.\n\nBut, when they do get together, Woodbridge is confident the new combination will work well. He knew Bhupathi through his Australian coach, the late Bob Carmichael, and respects the ability of the former Wimbledon doubles champion. As for the cultural differences: \"I guess I'll be eating a few more curries next year,\" he said.\n\nWhich introduces an important element of a successful doubles combination, the off-court chemistry. Woodbridge believes that was a vital ingredient in his long and successful partnership with Mark Woodforde and also his association with Bjorkman.\n\n\"When Mark retired at the end of 2000, we were still good friends,\" said Woodbridge. \"We had a lot of things in common and we also knew when to give each other some space.\n\n\"Jonas brought a lot of different things out of me. Things like dress, fashion, going out - I was pretty staid before I played with him. A good example is the Australian Open with all the Swedish fans. I was dancing after every match, which was never quite my style.\"\n\nHaving decided to play on for another year in search of that amazing 10th Wimbledon doubles title and - most likely with Arthurs - a shot at the Davis Cup, Woodbridge hopes his new partnership will give him some extra edge.\n\nIn their first two tournaments together, Woodbridge and Bjorkman had match points in Sydney before losing the final and then won the Australian Open. So Woodbridge believes, if the chemistry is right, a new team can work straight away."
