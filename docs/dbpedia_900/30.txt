Washington DC: 11th Street

[The Need] Bridges are no different than any other form of infrastructure, eventually they break down and need to be either repaired or replaced. Inspection occurs at least every two years, yet bridges are often pushed to their absolute limits of usability. In Washington DC, the 11th Street Bridge Project aims to replace two bridges built in the 1960s with three new bridges.

That was pertinent as with the rise in technology and suburban flight, people were increasingly traveling into the city in the morning to work and out at night to go home. Secondly, the bridges were deteriorating and had reached their maximum life capacity. Without action, the city was facing not only greater travel times, but a …show more content…

In a crisis, whatever bridge has less traffic can be used by emergency vehicles. The new bridges also have more space so that vehicles can move over to make way for the emergency vehicles. Therefore, the travel time of a vehicle in need can be cut down significantly. On the topic of evacuation, the addition of lanes will cut down on the amount of traffic that is backed up on the bridge. Thus, allowing people to leave the city at a much quicker rate than before.
