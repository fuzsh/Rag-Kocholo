I assume this was done for bicycle safety, however, bikers flaunting traffic laws are what have caused the near misses in my experience. Just recently, a few days apart, bikers going west, blew through stop signs which give First street traffic the right of way. Had I not braked hard, each might have been hit.\n\nopen #192802\n\nStreet Lights\n\n298 S Eagleson Ave\n\nCase Date:\n\n8/10/2024\n\nWalk light at 3rd and eagleson. Is not functioning.

We would very much like to have it removed. It’s gross.\n\nopen #192799\n\nBiking & Walking\n\n401 N Morton ST\n\nCase Date:\n\n8/10/2024\n\nWalk light at 3rd and eagleson. Is not functioning.

Coming out of alley at 918 west second street very dangerous\n\nopen #192797\n\nRequest a new Street Light\n\nS Buffstone Ct\n\nCase Date:\n\n8/10/2024\n\nIt’s very dark on this cul de sac and there have been numerous break ins to cars as well as homeless people evicted from Switchyard now coming thru our area. How do we get a street light installed\n\nopen #192796\n\nStreet Lights\n\n3084 W 3rd St\n\nCase Date:\n\n8/10/2024\n\nRed light bulb is out\n\nopen #192795\n\nPotholes, Other Street Repair\n\nKirkwood and Washington st\n\nCase Date:\n\n8/9/2024\n\nDestruction of curb\n\nopen #192794\n\nTraffic Related Complaints\n\n412 S Lincoln ST\n\nCase Date:\n\n8/9/2024\n\nThere have been 2 cars parked in the alley for over 24 hours and despite trying to make contact with those who live in 412 S Lincoln St, they have not moved their cars from the road. It is blocking my parking spot and access to my backyard. I have visitors coming who will get tickets if they do not move their vehicles from the road so I can access my parking. Additionally, there is a lot of through traffic in that alley so it may be a safety concern as well."
