Probably the first homes at Ocean Springs were named by families relocating here in the 1850s from plantations in the Mississippi Delta and South Louisiana. House naming may have been a function of affluence, family tradition, pride of ownership, etc. The reason isn't relevant to the fact that house nomenclature is now an integral part of our local history.\n\nIf your home has a name and it hasn't made this list and you would like to share this information, or if it is on this list and you find fault, please contact me and I will make appropriate changes. If anyone has photos of these older homes especially those that no longer exist, I would appreciate knowing that some historical record is available. In addition, I would sincerely appreciate some input into this column. Please address all comments, questions, etc. to: PO BOX 617, Ocean Springs, Ms. 39566-0617.

Hansen (1823-1900), a Danish born mariner who settled at New Orleans. Captain Hansen later resided at 520 Jackson Avenue where he expired in October 1900. Image by Ray L. Bellande in June 1995.\n\nPrologue\n\nThe Hansen-Hanemann Cottage at 305 Front Beach Drive was another victim of Hurricane Katrina. The structure was damaged beyond salvation and the remains of what were once a charming, vernacular, beach cottage were removed from the lot in the post-Katrina cleanup of late 2005. As of this date, the lot remains empty. The Hansen-Hanemann Cottage was situated at an elevation of about 10-13 feet above mean sea level in Lot 2 and Lot 3 of the Austin tract, which was surveyed by H.A. Boudousquie in March 1872. These two lots have an 80-foot front on the Bay of Biloxi and run back to the north approximately three hundred-fifty feet.\n\nJerome Ryan\n\nOn August 31, 1846, Jerome Ryan (1793-c. 1878) and his wife, Euphrosine LaFontaine Ryan (1802-c. 1852), in the partition deed of the Widow LaFontaine Tract, a 237-acre plot of land encompassing all of Section 37, T7S-R8W, received Lot No. 1. It ran five hundred sixty-one feet east of Martin Avenue along the shore of Biloxi Bay and north to Section 19, T7S-R8W, a distance of approximately 2900 feet as surveyed in 1853. Catherine Bourgeois LaFontaine (1768-c. 1845), the Widow LaFontaine, and Louis Auguste LaFontaine (1762-c. 1813) were the parents of Euphrosine L. Ryan.(JXCO, Ms. Land Deed Bk. 4, pp. 548-549)\n\nMartha E. Austin\n\nPrior to the division and donation of Lot 1, the Jerome Ryan tract, to his children in November 1853, Jerome Ryan and his legal age children had conveyed the water front acreage of Lot 1 to Martha E. Austin (1818-1898), the wife of Dr. William Glover Austin (1812-1894), a New Orleans physician of Maryland birth. The sale of this approximate fourteen-acre tract was authorized by the Probate Court of Jackson County, Mississippi at its June term 1853. The sale to Mrs. Austin was consummated on September 21, 1853.(JXCO, Ms. Land Deed Bk. 12, pp. 632-633)\n\nAlso in 1853, Dr. W.G. Austin with would build the Ocean Springs Hotel a few blocks east of here on Calhoun (now Cleveland) and Jackson Avenue. In 1854, the Ocean Springs Hotel gave its name to this developing village on the eastern shore of the Bay of Biloxi. It had been called Biloxy by French Canadian explorer and soldier of fortune, Pierre Le Moyne, sieur d'Iberville (1661-1706), in 1699. By 1720, the French referred to the area as Vieux Biloxy when they moved across the Bay of Biloxi to present day Biloxi. In the early 1840s, people from New Orleans called the area East Biloxi and by 1853, the name Lynchburg Springs had been given to the first post office. Fortunately for the people of Ocean Springs, this appellation lasted only one year.\n\nLawrence N. Hansen\n\nOn March 1, 1871, Lawrence N. Hansen (1823-1900) purchased Lot 2 of the Austin Tract from Martha E. Austin for $200. He would acquire Lot 3 of the Austin Tract from Mrs. Austin in May 1871 for $300. By mid-April 1872, Lawrence N. Hansen also owned Lot 4 and Lot 5 of the Austin Tract. He now had one hundred-seventy feet on Biloxi Bay, just east of Martin Avenue and invested $1300 in these four lots.(JXCO, Ms. Land Deed Bk. 12, pp. 627-633)\n\nIt is believed that in 1872, Lawrence N. Hansen built the beach cottage, which before Katrina’s unwelcome visit on August 29, 2005 stood at 305 Beach Drive. This structure was described by the Mississippi State Department of Archives & History in their architectural survey of Ocean Springs (1986) as: One-and-one-half story, wood frame Creole cottage with a side gable roof, full-width undercut gallery with a scalloped architrave. Twin centered French windows with transoms. Circa 1880.\n\nIt is known with a high degree of certitude that in 1875, Lawrence N. Hansen owned a residence valued at $1000 and Lots 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the Ryan Tract. This information is recorded on page 74 in the Jackson County, Mississippi 1875 Land Roll Book. This fact seems to corroborate that L.N. Hansen built a cottage here before 1875.\n\nLawrence N. Hansen was a Danish mariner who lived at New Orleans and Ocean Springs. He came to America in his youth. In 1853, Hansen married Sophia Clasen (1834-1912), a native of Hanover, Germany.(1880 Jackson Co., Mississippi Federal Census T9_650, p. 13, ED 144)\n\nHansen-Dodds House\n\nOn January 13, 1873, Lawrence Hansen acquired Lot 3 of Block 34 (Culmseig Map of 1854) from Charles McMicken. At this time a Greek Revival cottage was probably located here at present day 520 Jackson Avenue. This house is referred to today as the Hansen-Dodds House and may have been built in the late 1850s. Captain Hansen died here on Jackson Avenue on October 14, 1900. His corporal remains were sent to New Orleans for internment in the Metairie Cemetery.(JXCO, Ms. Land Deed Bk. 2, pp. 417-420 and The Pascagoula Democrat-Star, October 19, 1900, p. 3)\n\nSophie C. Hansen left Ocean Springs after the demise of her husband and relocated to New Orleans to the domicile of Christian C.A. Hansen (1845-1914), a nephew of L.N. Hansen, her deceased spouse. She planned to rent her cottage on Jackson Avenue.(The Pascagoula Democrat-Star, October 26, 1900. p. 3)\n\nOn June 9, 1905, Sophia Clasen Hansen sold her Jackson Avenue home at Ocean Springs to Christian C.A. Hansen (1845-1914). The consideration was $1500. Christian C.A. Hansen was born in Denmark. He was a shipmaster and later entered the cotton brokerage business where he did well financially. Christian C.A. Hansen had married Magdelena Grob (1845-1929) in 1871. She was born in New Orleans, and was the widow of Henry Clasen (1814-1870). She and Henry Clasen had a daughter, Louisa Clasen Hatry (1852-1911), who died April 11, 1911. Louisa married Theodore Hatry (1851-1896) in June 1875.(JXCO, Ms. Land Deed Bk. 29, p. 599)\n\nFrench Hotel-Edward House\n\nLawrence N. Hansen had sold his beach cottage property to Mrs. Kate Lewis Staples (1859-1930) for $3500 on July 24, 1891. She sold Lots 4 and 5 just west of her home to Marie Gouax Bertuccini (1863-1930) in December 1895. Corsican immigrant, Antoine Bertuccini (1844-1921), built the French Hotel on these lots at the southeast corner of Martin and Font Beach circa 1896. This structure later became the Edwards House, owned by James H. Edwards (1893-1950) and family.(JXCO, Ms. Land Deed Bk. 12, pp. 634-635 and Bk. 17, pp. 133-134)\n\nKate L. Staples\n\nKate L. Staples (1859-1930) was born Katherine L. Lewis. She was the daughter of Colonel Alfred E. Lewis (1812-1885) and Ann R. Farrington Lewis (1821-1901) who built Lewis Sha, a Greek Revival style plantation home at Gautier in 1845. The home is called Oldfields today having received this appellation from William Wade Grinstead (1864-1948), the father-in-law of Walter I. \"Bob\" Anderson (1903-1965).\n\nKate Lewis married Frederick “Fred” Staples (1852-1897) on April 3, 1880. Fred Staples was the son of Solomon G. Staples (1817-1870+) and Adeline A. Terrell Staples (1829-1902) of New Orleans. In 1874, Mrs. Adeline A. Staples bought a large tract of land on the Fort Point Peninsula at Ocean Springs, Mississippi. Here, the Staples family built a summer home on the Bay of Biloxi. One of their daughters, Mary Eleanor \"May\" Staples (1847-1932) married Captain Junius Poitevent (1837-1917) of Hancock County, Mississippi in 1865. In 1876, the Poitevents built their home, \"Bay View\", adjacent to the Staples place on present day Lovers Lane at Ocean Springs.\n\nFred and Kate Staples had three children: Alfred L. Staples (1881-1969), Catherine A. Putnam (b. 1883), and Ethel E. Burns (b. 1886). Fred Lewis made his livelihood at Ocean Springs as a merchant. His partners were his brothers-in-law, Robert W. Staples (1858-1886) and G.T. Beauregard Staples (1861-1880+). This joint venture commenced operations in October 1879, when they began to occupy the building formerly of Moses Smith Park (1846-1910+). Mr. Park was a Texan by birth and had been a resident of Ocean Springs as early as December 1870. At this time, he acquired two tracts of land from Cales Anderson in the Azalie LaFauce Clay Strip with frontage on County Road, now Government Street. A part of this land situated on the southeast corn of Washington and Government would become known as \"Lundy's Corner.\" The 1926 Standard Oil-Zanca Service Station was demolished here in June 2005 by SEFCO LLC, a Mississippi limited liability company domiciled at 712 Washington Avenue. (JXCO, Ms. Land Deed Bk. 5, pp. 107-108)\n\nKate L. Staples’s granddaughter, Emily Staples Hearin (b. 1914), resides at Mobile. Emily S. Hearin relates in her booklet, Colonels, Cotton, and Camellias, that the Staples and Lewis Wharf was located at the foot of Jackson Avenue adjacent to the Antonio Catchot oyster shop.\n\nIn May 1895, Mrs. Staples sold her beach cottage property to Mrs. V.H. Hattier, nee Grazeilla M. Gourdain, of New Orleans for $1800.(JXCO, Ms. Land Deed Bk. 16, pp. 451-452)\n\nGrazeilla Gourdain Hattier Leonard\n\nGrazellia Louise Gourdain (1859-1931) was born at New Orleans, the daughter of John V. Gourdain (1813-1899) and Marie Odile Gourdain (1820-1898). Her father was an auctioneer and exchange broker in the Crescent City. Graziella married Victor Henry Hattier (1833-1898) at New Orleans on March 19, 1889. He was the widower of Rosa Castanedo Hattier (1831-1888). V.H. Hattier made his livelihood as a cotton classer.\n\n(1870 and 1880 Orleans Parish, Louisiana Federal Census M593_522, p. 125 and T9_462, p. 41, ED 50)\n\nAfter Victor H. Hattier’s demise, Grazellia G. Hattier married Leonce Leonard (1862-1940), the widower of Mary Meyer Leonard. Their vows were exchanged at New Orleans on September 8, 1900. Leonce Leonard made his livelihood in the sugar industry. In 1920, they were domiciled on Orleans Street at New Orleans.(1920 Orleans Parish, Louisiana T625_620, p. 1B, ED 90)\n\nIn September 1905, Mrs. Graziella M.G. Leonard, formerly Mrs. V.H. Hattier, conveyed her real property on the water at Ocean Springs consisting of Lots 2 and 3 and improvements to J.B. Morin of St. Martin Parish, Louisiana for $2000.(JXCO, Ms. Land Deed Bk. 30, p. 171)\n\nJean-Baptiste Morin\n\nJean-Baptiste Morin (1881-1918+) was February 25, 1881 in St. Landry, Parish Louisiana to Joseph Morin (1852-1918) and Eliza Kidder (1859-pre-1900), the daughter of Jean-Baptise Kidder and Florence Kidder. They married in February 1878 at Opelousas, St. Landry Parish, Louisiana. Jean-Baptiste Morin made his livelihood as a farmer and in 1918 was residing in Arnaudville, St. Landry Parish, Louisiana.(WW I Draft Registration St. Landry Parish, Louisiana R 1684999 and 1880 and 1900 St. Landry Parish Federal Census T9_471, p. 49, ED 39 and T623 582, p. 2A, ED 77) In August 1910, Jean-Baptiste Morin conveyed his real estate at Ocean Springs to Clebert J.

Lindbergh (1902-1974), who flew The Spirit of St. Louis, the first aircraft to make a nonstop solo flight, across the Atlantic Ocean in 1927.(Dorothy Hunt Applegate Pennebaker, June 13, 2000)\n\nThe Jackson County Times of June 15, 1929, announced that \"Mr. and Mrs. A.B. Hunt and family were honored by the newly wedded Lindberghs having received individual boxes of wedding cake. With the cake were cards in which had been written \"with love Anne\". The Hunts are related to the Morrow family\".\n\nIn February 1934, Dorothy Hunt received a personally autographed photograph from Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh. She was frequent correspondent with the Lindbergh family.(The Jackson County Times, February 3, 1934)\n\nBreezy Hill\n\nThe Hunt family referred to their cottage on Biloxi Bay at Ocean Springs as \"Breezy Hill\". Before a road was built on front beach, the home entered from the rear via a driveway from Martin Avenue through the Edward’s hotel property to the west. In the late 1920s, Mr. Arthur B. Hunt developed throat cancer and was sent to New York City in May 1928 for surgery. As a result of the surgery, he lost his voice and had a hole in his throat, which was covered by cheese cloth. He had been operated on at New York City in May 1928. Lost his voice.(The Jackson County Times, May 26, 1928, p. 2)\n\nMr. and Mrs. Hunt both had cancer and they eventually succumbed to it. He expired at Ocean Springs on December 8, 1951, and his corporal remains sent to the Metairie Cemetery for internment. Mrs. Rose Viguerie Hunt died circa 1972. It appears Dorothy Hunt Applegate inherited the property as she sold it to her son, Arthur Hunt Applegate of Houston, Texas in January 1982. (JXCO, Ms. Land Deed Bk. 728, p. 155)\n\nIn June 1983, Arthur Hunt Applegate now of Dallas, Texas conveyed the aging Hansen-Hannemann cottage to H. Duane Nowlin and Debra Jean Nowlin.(JXCO, Ms. Land Deed Bk. 768, p. 185)\n\nH. Duane Nowlin\n\nH. Duane Nowlin and spouse were domiciled at Del Ray Beach, Florida when they sold their Front Beach Drive cottage to Carl and Cheri W. Hanemann of New Orleans on February 5, 1985. No further information.(JXCO, Ms. Land Deed Bk. 815, p. 389)\n\nCarl C. Hanemann\n\nCarl C. Hanemann (b. 1944) is the son of Albert H. Hanemann and Marie Blancq. He was born at New Orleans. His father made his livelihood as a coffee taster in the Crescent City. Carl studied psychology at Tulane and matriculated to Harvard Law School where he was awarded a Law degree.(Cheri W. Hanemann, July 8, 2006)\n\nIn 1969, Carl C. Hanemann married Cheri Elise W. Hanemann (b. 1946),the daughter of Milton McClellan Walther (1920-1994), a chemical engineer and lawyer, who managed NOPSI gas, and Elise Cambon (b. 1922 ). Elise studied ceramic arts at Newcomb College. Carl and Cheri are the parents of two daughters: Elise “Peaches” Hanemann (b. 1970) and Marilee H. Gloss (b. 1975). Cheri is active in historic preservation in New Orleans and at Ocean Springs, her adopted home. She landscaped a garden in the Little Childrens’ Park, which became known as “the Butterfly Garden”.(Cheri W.

Maginnis Estate\n\nThe commencement of the Maginnis family history at Ocean Springs is obfuscated somewhat by the destruction of the land deed records of Jackson County before March 1875. It is very probable that during the post-Bellum years and pre-1875, Arthur Ambrose Maginnis (1815-1877) and or his son, A.A. Maginnis Jr (1846-1901), two of the wealthiest men at New Orleans, purchased several lots in Block 17 (Culmseig Map of 1854), Section 25, T7S-R9W. Here on a high bluff, at the west beach, with over six-hundred feet of water front acreage, between present day Hillendale and McNamee, the Maginnis family erected a large mansion and several outbuildings. C.E. Schmidt (1904-1988) in his Ocean Springs French Beachhead (1972), describes the Maginnis estate as \"along the Bay front East of Hillendale, and back to Porter Street. There was also a smaller house on the front, and servant cottages on Porter\".\n\nThis beautiful site with an outstanding view of the Bay of Biloxi and Deer Island was just west of Oak Cottage, the family boarding house, owned by Irish immigrant, Julia Ward (1830-1894+). Charles W. Ziegler (1865-1936) and the Puringtons later occupied the Oak Cottage site.\n\nThe Maginnis family at New Orleans was synonymous with cottonseed oil and cotton mills. Arthur A. Maginnis Sr. (1815-1877), a native of Maryland, was the pioneer in the making of cottonseed oil at the Crescent City, when in 1856, he commenced the A.A. Maginnis' Cotton Seed Oil & Soap Works, and later Maginnis' Oil & Soap Works. With John H. Maginnis, possibly a brother or nephew, Arthur A. Maginnis founded A.A. Maginnis' Sons, who in 1882, promoted the Maginnis' Cotton Mills. The Maginnis' Cotton Mills were bounded by Calliope, Poeyfarre, Annunciation, and Constance Streets. The mills were considered models of their kind and employed nine hundred people. These workers operated 12,000 looms and 41,000 spindles to produce over 21,000,000 yards of cotton sheeting, shirting, osnaburg, yarn, bating, and duck cloth from over 12,000 bales of cotton.\n\nArthur Ambrose Maginnis married Elizabeth Jane Armstrong (1822-1901). She was a native of Liverpool, England, and immigrated to the United States with her Scottish parents as a small child. Her mother was Sarah Affleck Armstrong (1796-1882). The Maginnises had a least nine children: Sarah M. Nolan (1841-1894), John H. Maginnis (1845-1889), Arthur Ambrose Maginnis Jr. (1846-1901), Emma M. Gilmore (1849-1901+), Margaret C. Pescud (1852-1919), Charles B. Maginnis (1856-1909), William D. Maginnis (1858-1938), Laura M. Penrose (1861-1933), and Albert B. Maginnis (1864-1917).\n\nFrom the land deed records of the Chancery Court of Jackson County, Sarah Armstrong, A.A. Maginnis's mother-in-law, also acquired a summer home at Ocean Springs. In 1862 and 1863, she bought eighty-two acres for $2200 from Joseph R. Plummer (1806-c. 1864) in Lot 5, Section 24, T7S-R9W.(1,2) This is on the Bay of Biloxi in an area of town that is now called Lovers Lane.\n\nThis estate came into the Maginnis family in January 1882, when Mrs. Armstrong sold it to her daughter, Elizabeth A. Maginnis.(3) Benjamin F. Parkinson (1859-1930) of New Orleans purchased the property in June 1907, for $2000 from the A.A. Maginnis Land Company. Parkinson was in the insurance business at New Orleans and Ocean Springs. He raised prize-winning chickens as a hobby at Ocean Springs. (4)\n\nA.A. Maginnis Jr.\n\nArthur A. Maginnis Jr. (1846-1901) succeeded his father in the company operations and management. As such he was the president of Maginnis' Cotton Mills, Lafayette Warehouse Company, Planters Fertilizer Manufacturing Company, Hermitage Planting and Manufacturing Company, and the Louisiana Oil Company. Mr. Maginnis was also resident vice-president of the American Surety Company of New York.\n\nA.A. Maginnis Jr. married Julia C. Fassman (1848-1867) of New Orleans. She died in the Crescent City on September 21, 1867, shortly after their espousal. He then wedded Mary Amelia Tweed (1851-1887). She may have been the daughter of William Marcy Tweed (1823-1878). W.M. Tweed was born at New York City and became leader of Tammany, the New York City Democratic political machine. He controlled party nominations and was known as Boss Tweed. His brother, John H. Maginnis (1853-1882), was married to Elizabeth Cornellson Tweed, possibly a sister of his wife. Arthur A. Maginnis Jr. and Mary A. Tweed had two children: Arthur A. Maginnis III (1874-1895) and Charles D. Maginnis (1878-1880).\n\nAs a child, A.A. Maginnis Jr. attended the New Orleans public schools. He abandoned his studies in 1862, to enlist in the forces of the Confederates States of America. At the mere age of fourteen, Maginnis was known as the youngest Rebel in active service. He served with his uncle, Captain John Tighlman Nolan, until the unit was disbanded. Maginnis was honorably discharged in 1864, as a member of the Miles Legion. After the Civil War, Arthur A. Maginnis Jr. was sent to New York to manage the family cottonseed oil company, which was headquartered at Coscob, Connecticut. In 1871, he returned to New Orleans and soon took command of the many Maginnis' family enterprises.\n\nAs a man of affluence at the Crescent City, Maginnis belonged to many social and fraternal organizations. He was one of the organizers of the Southern Yacht Club. Mr. Maginnis enjoyed several yachts. In addition to his flagship, Pickwick, which was built at New Orleans, he owned the Gypsy and Agnes. Maginnis served as Commodore of the Southern Yacht Club from 1881-1883, and was a member of Chalmette, Louisiana, La Variete, French Opera, Louisiana Jockey, and the Pickwick Clubs. In addition, his interest in Carnival saw him reign as Rex in 1880. At New Orleans, the family resided on the corner of Jackson Avenue and Prytania Street.\n\nAt his west beach villa at Ocean Springs, Mississippi, A.A. Maginnis Jr. owned a large olive grove planted with thousands of bearing trees imported from Italy. He also attempted to grow peanuts on his estate to manufacture peanut butter. This venture attracted two German immigrants, Augustus von Rosambeau (1849-1912) and Charles E. Pabst (1851-1920), from the Leon Godchaux sugar plantation in Louisiana to Ocean Springs. Although the peanut butter venture failed, von Rosambeau and Pabst remained at Ocean Springs and made successful careers here in business and horticulture respectively. Maginnis also oversaw a 3,000 acre sugar plantation at Ascension Parish, Louisiana near Donaldsonville. His sister, Mrs. John T. Nolan, probably lived on the farm with her family.\n\nIn an interview by Captain Ellis Handy (1891-1963), a writer for The Gulf Coast Times, Joseph L. \"Dode\" Schrieber (1873-1951) related the following about A.A. Maginnis Jr.: Ambrose McGinnis (sic) was a wealthy New Orleans man who built a large home here on the front beach not far from the bridge today. He commuted to work on the Club car of the Coast train. He was connected with Boss Tweed of New York by marriage. He planted olive trees, which did not do well. He raised cotton in the hope of developing a good oil from it. He raised peanuts in shares in the hope of making a butter from them. It was this venture, which brought Pabst and Rosambeau to Ocean Springs. Pabst sold out his share for three dollars. A son was killed by a flash of lightening as he came out of swimming.\n\nMr. McGinnis was a very positive man who wanted a yes or a no. He complained that the train whistles annoyed him and had the L&N put up signs \"Blow Softly\". He told his Negro manservant he was tired when he got in from the train and wanted a cold glass of milk brought to him each time he arrived. The man milked a half hour before train time and put the milk in bowls on ice. When Mr. McGinnis tasted the tasted the milk he said it was sour. The man said it could not be as he had just milked. Mr. McGinnis pulled a gun and made the man drink all the milk about two gallons, for contradicting him.(September 2, 1949)\n\nWhile at Ocean Springs, the Maginnis family suffered several misfortunes and tragedies. In February 1888, the residence was burglarized. A.A. Maginnis Jr. lost $50 in cash and a gold watch and chain, which had been a gift to his late wife. It was valued at $500. In addition, the suspect, one John Clark, alias Doyle, had filled his satchel with food and wine from the Maginnis pantry. Clark had just been released from the jail at Biloxi.\n\nThe gale of August 1888 uprooted trees and dispersed limbs and leaves on the grand lawn of the Maginnis estate. They were less fortunate on July 4, 1889, when their brother, John A. Maginnis, was killed by a lightning bolt on the Maginnis pier as he returned from a swim in the bay.\n\nA.A. Maginnis died on December 27, 1901, at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. He was taken ill by a disease, which puzzled the finest physicians of Gotham and expired two weeks after succumbing to the malady. His brothers, Albert and Charles Maginnis, sister, Mrs. Thomas Gilmore, and nephew Harry Maginnis, were at his death bed.\n\nThe corporal remains of Arthur Ambrose Maginnis Jr. were sent to New Orleans and interred in the family mausoleum at the Metairie Cemetery. The large Maginnis tomb is on \"Millionaire Circle\" next to the twin mausoleums of the Schmidt and Ziegler families. It is interesting to note that the summer estates of these very wealthy New Orleans men were also contiguous to each other on the front beach at Ocean Springs, extending from present day Hillendale to just west of Martin Avenue.\n\nThe A.A. Maginnis Land Company of New Orleans took title to the Maginnis lands at Ocean Springs in the early 1900s. In December 1911, they leased the Maginnis property to the Keewatin School for Boys from Mercer, Wisconsin. The lease had a three year term with an option to purchase. Professor Keewatin's philosophy of education was to offer a maximum of outdoor life while maintaining a high grade of scholarship.\n\nThe Maginnis estate began to break up in June 1913, when the A.A. Maginnis Land Company sold a one-acre lot off the northeast corner of the tract to Katherine C. Ver Nooy (1863-1953).(5) Mrs. Ver Nooy was the daughter of D.V. Purington (1841-1914) and Jennie Purington (1846-1933) who resided east of the Maginnis property. Her husband, Charles B. Ver Nooy (1860-1921), was the vice-president and treasurer of the Illinois Brick Company of Chicago.\n\nIn April 1917, during WW I, The Jackson County Times reported that a squad of Mississippi soldiers under the command of Lieutenant Bond arrived at Ocean Springs to guard the L&N railroad bridge across the Bay of Biloxi. The small span across Davis Bayou was also under their surveillance. The troops were bivouacked on the Maginnis estate. By late April, the soldiers made their first arrest when Halstead Staples was incarcerated for failing to obey Lieutenants Bond's order to pass only through the draw. Staples in a skiff was attempting to pass under the bridge and was fired upon by one of the soldiers.\n\nIn June, the Army troops hosted a large picnic for the benefit of the Red Cross at their camp on the Maginnis estate. A large group of people attended the outdoor fete with their well stocked picnic baskets. A string band played music. There was also dancing, games, and amusement for everyone. In August 1925, the Maginnis Land Company sold the old Maginnis vacation home and the seventeen acres associated with it to Frederick B. Thomas for $8,500. F.E. Lee (1874-1932) was their real estate agent. Mr. Thomas came to the area from Winnetka, Illinois, and owned a home on East Beach, called \"Oak Haven\". Here he had an orange grove, Japanese persimmons, and a pecan orchard. James S. Bradford (1884-1963) was the manager of the Thomas orchards. Thus ended the long reign of one of New Orleans most wealthy families at Ocean Springs.\n\nIn the April 1943, Marko Skrmetta (1889-1943+), a native of Dalmatia and resident of Biloxi, acquired approximately three-quarters of the west segment of the former Maginnis estate from Marian L. Thomas, the widow of F.B. Thomas, for $8,000.(6) Mr. Skrmetta platted the Oak Bluff Subdivision here in September 1950.(7)\n\nIt is believed that the large Maginnis home was damaged by fire in the 1940s and dismantled. The heirs of F.B. Thomas may have been the owners at this time.\n\nREFERENCES:\n\n1.

Fournier received a patent from the U.S. Government in 1849 on 160 acres comprising the SW/4 of Section 19, T7S-R8W. By 1877, E.W. Clark of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania owned large tracts of land in the Ocean Springs area including the lot that the Cochran-Letoha now rests. It is believed that he was speculating on land values through his local agent, entrepreneur George Allen Cox (1811-1887).\n\nThomas Cochran\n\nIn July 1877, Thomas Cochran (1852-1883), a native of Mobile, Alabama, who made his livelihood as a house carpenter purchased 1.25 acres (150 feet on Washington Avenue by 363 deep) on the southwest corner of present day Robinson and Washington Avenue from Mr. Clark for $140.(Jackson Co., Ms. Land Deed Bk. 5, pp. 622-623)\n\nIn the northwest corner of his tract circa 1880, Cochran built a one story wood frame house with a side gable roof and full width undercut gallery. A five bay facade with three transomed doors is flanked by two six-over-six double hung windows in the outer bays. Chamfered post with sawn brackets. Balustrade and intricate balusters.\n\nCirca 1878, Thomas Cochran married Charlotte Franco (1862-1939), the daughter of Antonio Franco (1834-1891) and Genevieve \"Jane\" Rodriguez (1844-1915). Franco was a Portuguese immigrant while Jane Rodriguez was the daughter of Spanish immigrant Juan Rodriguez and Marie-Martha Ryan. The Juan Rodriguez and Pierre Ryan Families were the original settlers of present day Gulf Hills. They received land patents from the U.S. Government before 1850.\n\nIn 1874, the Francos settled on Old Fort Bayou and probably built a home, which later became the Bayou Inn of Dr. Henry Bradford Powell (1867-1949) in the early years of this Century. We know this place today as Aunt Jenny's Catfish Restaurant.\n\nThomas Cochran and Charlotte Franco Cochran had two children: Thomas Antonio ‘Tom’ Cochran (1879-1951) and Lillie Cochran (1881-1961). About the same time that he built his home, Thomas Cochran also built a two- story, wood frame building on the southwest corner of Washington Avenue and Robinson. This structure became known as the Franco Saloon when it was run by Antonio Franco, Tom Cochran's father-in-law. Unfortunately in 1883, Thomas Cochran died intestate at the young age of thirty- one years. Probably with the help of her parents, Charlotte Cochran reared her small children near the depot grounds.\n\nIn March 189 , a few years after the death of her father, Antonio Franco, Charlotte Franco Cochran effected a Commissioners sale on her saloon lot (80 feet on Washington by 120 feet on Robinson) through Jackson County Chancery Court Cause No. 675. George E. Arndt (1857-1945), a young entrepreneur from Rodney, Mississippi paid $1500 for the property. Arndt called his saloon the Paragon Saloon.(Jackson Co., Ms. Land Deed Bk.\n\nIn 1900, Charlotte Cochran was in real estate. She probably retired before WWI. She and her children resided at No. 5 Robinson Avenue for the remainder of their lives. In 1904, she rented her home to Illinois people and stayed with her daughter at New Orleans.(see Progress)\n\nOn January 14, 1939, Charlotte Cochran met death at an early hour. She was sitting in her chair at 4:30 AM watching the Theo Bechtel Home on Porter Avenue burn to the ground when she suffered an apparent heart attack. The Bechtel Home was a total loss, but Mrs. Theo Bechtel, her son, and Mrs. Guiterrez were saved. Charlotte Franco Cochran was survived by her two children and three brothers, Thomas P. Franco (1869-1951+), Walter Edward Franco (1883-1939+), and Antonio M. Franco (1878-1939+) who lived at Mobile.(The Daily Herald, January 14, 1939, p. 6 and The Jackson County Times, January 21, 1939, p. 3).\n\nTom A. Cochran worked as a railroad telegraph operator at the L&N Depot in Ocean Springs. He attended Soule's Business College at New Orleans in November 1898, and joined the L&N about 1904. Cochran worked for that organization for about forty-five years. Cochran was a member of the Order of Railway Telegraphers.\n\nMiss Lilly Cochran\n\nLilly Cochran, who was named for her aunt, Lillie Franco Geiger (1863-1905). She attended the Industrial Institute and College (now MUW) at Columbus, Mississippi, in September 1898. Miss Lilly taught school at the Cochran House. Some of her pupils circa 1920, were the Bradford sisters: Bette Bradford Milsted (b. 1914), Eleanor Bradford Lemon (b. 1916), and Vertalee Bradford Van Cleave (1918-2004), Standish J. Bradford (1914-1992), and John Mitchell (1915-1963). Mrs. Cochran would bake bread for everyone. Miss Cochran also taught music and piano at the Cochran home. She also taught telegraphy to several local men, including Ralph Beaugez, who went on to become excellent telegraphers for the L&N Railroad.(The Daily Herald, July 16, 1954, p. 5)\n\nAfter her brother died, Lilly Cochran rented the west side of her house as an apartment. One tenant was Joseph L. \"Roy\" Modlin (1927-1982) who worked as a plumber. Lilly Cochran died on December 29, 1961 in her home at 900 Robinson. She was found in bed that morning apparently the victim of a heart attack. The Cochran family was close. Neither child ever married, but it is related that Tom Cochran had many lady friends.\n\nIn an unusual request, Lilly Cochran had asked in her will that half of the proceed from the sale of the house be put into an account at the Ocean Springs State Bank to purchase flowers on All Saints Day, Easter, and Mother's Day for the graves of the Cochran-Geiger Families which are both interred at the Evergreen Cemetery on Fort Bayou. The remainder of the money was given to heirs of Miss Cochran.(JXCO, Ms. Chancery Court Cause No. 16440-1962)\n\nThe Cochran House lie empty for nearly three years before the Cochran Estate, administered by Frederick L. Westbrook Jr. sold it to Wallace and Marilyn Cassanova on December 16, 1964. The selling price was $3770. Dolores Davidson \"Bobbie\" Smith assisted Cassanova with procuring the house.(JXCO, Ms. Land Deed Bk. 266, p. 215)\n\nWallace E. Cassanova\n\nWallace Eugene Cassanova (1928-2014) is a native of Biloxi. In November 1951, married Marilyn Johnson (b. 1930), the daughter of Ralph Johnson who hails from Chicago.(The Daily Herald, November 20, 1951, p. 5)\n\nThey had met the previous year in Jackson, Mississippi where both were employed with Coca Cola. The Cassanovas had four children: Linda C. Barker (b. 1952), Laura Louise C. Telarico (b. 1953), David Cassanova (b. 1954), and Loretta C. Bamford (b. 1956).\n\nLaura Louise Casanova married Dominic J. Telarico on November 25, 1972. He was the son of Dominic J. Telarico and Angela A. Telarico.(The Ocean Springs Record, October 19, 1972, Sec. II, p. 2)\n\nMr. Cassanova worked for Barqs Root Beer in Biloxi as a vending machine mechanic before joining Chevron at Pascagoula about 1974. At the oil refinery, he worked as an operator in the blending and shipping division.\n\nWhen the Cassanovas purchased the house from the Cochran Estate, it was in a state of demolition by neglect. In fact, it was referred to by children in the area as the \"haunted house\". Among those repairs effected by the new owners were: ceilings replastered, chimney between the two bedrooms on the east side removed because the mortar had turned to sand, composition roof over wooden shingles replaced with tin sheeting, replace broken window lights with with old glass, light fixture replaced by Mr. Mangin (Biloxi), dilapidated picket fence removed, rotten ballusters replaced, pine flooring repaired and refinished. Gerald Richard of Biloxi did the carpentry work for Wallace Cassanova.\n\nMr. Cassanova sold the Cochran House to the First National Bank of the South in October 1979 for $53,000. After the sale, the Cassanovas left their old home for a new residence in the Windsor Porte Subdivision located north of Fort Bayou.(Jackson Co., Ms. Land Deed Bk. 634, p. 251)\n\nFirst National Bank of the South\n\nAfter the bank bought the house, E.W. Pettus, a local carpenter, refurbished the house and Jumonville redid the floors under the supervision of J.K. Lemon. The old balusters that were placed in the attic by Cassanova were used as the model to construct new ones. The First National Bank of the South conveyed the Cochran-Cassanova house to Marvin L. Smith and Connie S. Smith of Harbor Realty in December 1983.(Jackson Co., Ms. Land Deed Bk. 779, p. 289)\n\nConnie Smith\n\nCentral air and heat added and house leveled.

It is estimated to date from circa 1881. The structure was built as a Greek Revival cottage, but survives today highly modified. A survey by the Mississippi Department of Archives and History (1979) describes the house as:One and one-half story, wood frame house with a front gable roof. Three-bay undercut porch supported by Doric columns. Off center entrance with eared architrave. Second floor balcony recessed within the gable. New brick foundation. Greek revival and chalet. Circa 1880. (Mississippi Department of Archives and History-State Wide Survey of Historic Sites (1979), \"Old Ocean Springs Historic District\", p. 13)\n\nIn March 1880, Mary Ann “Mollie” Soden von Rosambeau (1857-1937), the wife of German immigrant, Augustin von Rosambeau (1849-1912), bought a tract of land on the southeast corner of Jackson Avenue and Calhoun from Margaret Foy (1840-1892).\n\nThe lot had a front on Jackson Avenue of 118 feet and 260 feet on Calhoun. This tract was divided into three lots designated Lot 7, Lot 8, and Lot 9 of Block 125. The residence at 910 Calhoun was built on Lot 9.(JXCO, Ms. Land Deed Bk. 4, pp. 570-571)\n\nDryden Rental\n\nAfter the von Rosambeau Family built a grocery store and home at 420 Jackson Avenue circa 1890, they vacated this structure. The von Rosambeaus utilized 910 Calhoun as a rental unit for many years. In the winter of 1901, Charles Dryden (1860-1931), a nationally known sportswriter and humorist, began coming to Ocean Springs to vacation after the baseball season. Dryden enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere and excellent fishing offered by the small village.\n\nCharles Dryden's brother-in-law, John L. Davenport, was the top hat salesman for the Gage Brothers Millinery of Chicago. Davenport's work took him to many parts of America including Ocean Springs. There is a high degree of certitude that he met Augustin von Rosambeau (1849-1912) at his general store on Jackson Avenue. It is known that Davenport's wife, Louise Dryden Davenport, began vacationing at Ocean Springs as early as December 1900 with her young son, John Dryden Davenport (1893-1965). They stayed at the Rosambeau cottage. The Pascagoula Democrat-Star of January 18, 1901 reported, \"Master Dryden Davenport, a precocious infant of seven years, caught a fine redfish off the pier of the Ocean Springs Hotel\".(The Pascagoula Democrat-Star, December 13, 1901)\n\nMrs. Davenport probably introduced Ocean Springs and the von Rosambeau family to her brother, Charles Dryden. In later years, Mrs. Davenport and John Dryden Davenport would join her brother at the von Rosambeau compound. Among other visitors from Chicago were eminent physicians, Drs. A.H. Bohart and Joseph Reese. Mr. Dryden loved to entertain his guests with dinner parties. His favorite meal was fresh fish caught from the fecund waters of Fort Bayou and the Bay of Biloxi. In time, the local people began to refer to his apartment on Calhoun as the \"Fried Fish Inn\". Often Dryden was the dinner guest of the von Rosambeau family.(The Pascagoula Democrat-Star, February 27, 1903 and September 11, 1903)\n\nskill as an angler was lauded in January 1910, when he was fishing in Old Fort Bayou for perch and landed a seven-pound redfish. The skill being the ability to handle the larger fish on the small linen line used for the perch.(The Ocean Springs News, January 8, 1910)\n\nIn later years, it is believed that Charles Dryden began to utilize the newer von Rosambeau cottage at 908 Calhoun built in 1903. He referred to this cottage as his \"Winter Rest\". After Charles Dryden suffered a debilitating stroke in 1921, it is believed he stayed with his sister, Mrs. Davenport, on Jackson Avenue. He died at Ocean Springs on February 14, 1931. The body was sent to Monmouth, Illinois for burial.(John Dryden Davenport Jr.-March 1993)\n\nAmy Clesi\n\nIn July 1947, when the three von Rosambeau sisters partitioned their mother's estate, 910 Calhoun became the real property of Amelia Theresa “Amy” von Rosambeau Clesi (1881-1958. There is a high degree of certitude that Amy Clesi was born in this house as her natal arrival was in November 1881.(JXCO, Ms. Land Deed Bk. 97, pp. 312-317)\n\nAmy von Rosambeau married John J. Clesi of New Orleans on September 20, 1911, at the St. Alphonsus Church, which is adjacent to the von Rosambeau familial home on Jackson Avenue. As a young lady, Amy was the organist at the same church. The young couple lived at New Orleans where Clesi was the owner of his own enterprise called the Typewriter Emporium. He learned the trade as an employee of the Royal Typewriter Company. While employed with Royal, John Clesi was their best salesman in the South.\n\nJohn and Amy von Rosambeau Clesi had a son, John Clesi Jr., who was born in March 1913. In 1973, he completed a very successful career as an oil scout with Humble Oil & Refining Company, now ExxonMobil.\n\nAfter the death of Amy Clesi on January 17, 1958, her son, John Clesi Jr., of New Orleans inherited 908 Calhoun. He acquired it legally on May 30, 1959. John Clesi Jr. sold the property to John Fredrick Brooks for $8000 on October 20, 1961.(JXCO, Ms. Land Deed Bk. 215, p. 380)\n\nJ. Fredrick Brooks\n\nJohn Fredrick “Fred” Brooks (1927-2004), a native of Ellisville, Mississippi, and his wife, Mary Imogene Clark (1930-2002), born at Eucutta in Wayne County, Mississippi came to Ocean Springs in 1961. She was the daughter of Marshall and Bernice Clark of Pascagoula. At the time Mr. Brooks was employed by the Mississippi Power Company and was transferred from their Pascagoula office. He left the utility business in 1974, and became self-employed in the auto parts retail business. Prior to his retirement, Fred Brooks was the proprietor of an automobile repair shop and auto parts store on Bienville Boulevard. The Brooks had four children: Theresa “Terri” Jean B. Mason (1951-2005), Debra B. Shotlander (b. 1953), Rene B. Rush (b. 1955), and John Brooks (b. 1968). Imogene Clark Brooks passed on September 17, 2002. Her corporal remains were interred in the Crestlawn Memorial Park in Ocean Springs. Fred Brooks died at Mobile, Alabama on August 29, 2004. Corporal remains at Crestlawn Memorial Park in Ocean Springs.(Fred Brooks-February 1993 and The Sun Herald, September 20, 2002 and August 31, 2004, p. A5 )\n\nAt the time of the Brooks purchase, the Clesi home was in poor condition. New owner, Fred Brooks, remodeled both the exterior and interior of his home. In the interior, he totally gutted the structure removing the fireplace, wall partitions, stairs, beaded board wall, and ceilings. The walls were replaced with wood paneling. On the exterior, Mr. Brooks removed the cypress turned posts, balusters, and wooden porch. He replaced the posts with Doric columns, cemented the porch foundation, and added old brick steps. A dining room was added to the west side of the structure.(Fred Brooks-February 1993 and June 2004)\n\nIn the summer of 2000, The Clesi-Brooks home was given an exterior painting and façade change. At the suggestion of the author, Mr. Brooks and Joie Mason, his son-in-law, replaced the out of character Doric columns with an appropriate substitute. A balustrade was added to the front porch matching the balcony balustrade.\n\nBefore his demise in August 2004, Fred Brooks sold his house to himself and Debra B. Shotlander.(JXCO, Ms. Land Deed Bk. 1358, p. 548)\n\nShotlander\n\nSaba\n\nDenis Lyons-Saba acquired the house in 2014? She is a 1980 Ocean Springs High School graduate and came back to Ocean Springs from Abita Springs, Louisiana after she divorced Mark Saba. They had two children, Jennifer Saba and Mark Saba Jr. Denis moved to Pass Christian, Mississippi after the sale which occurred on 31 July 2017 to Jacob Oddo Jr and spouse, Gena Oddo.\n\nOddo\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nvon Rosambeau-Thetford-Green Cottage: 908 Calhoun-Lot 8\n\nIn March 1880, Mary Ann Soden von Rosambeau (1857-1937) acquired a .70 acre tract of land on the southeast corner of Jackson Avenue and Calhoun from Margaret Foy (1840-1892). The von Rosambeau tract was divided into three lots designated\n\nLot 7, Lot 8, and Lot 9 of Block 125. The residence at 908 Calhoun was built on Lot 8.\n\nBlanche Magdalen von Rosambeau (1892-1982) acquired this property in the partition of Mrs. Mary Ann von Rosambeau's estate in July 1947.(JXCO, Ms. Land Deed Bk. 4, pp. 570-571 and Bk. 97, pp. 312-317)\n\nIn the historic sites survey of the Old Ocean Springs Historic District (1979), 908 Calhoun is described as: One story, wood frame house with front gable roof. Three-bay undercut porch with turned posts and sawn brackets. Circa 1898.( Mississippi Department of Archives and History-State Wide Survey of Historic Sites,1979, p. 13)\n\nThe Pascagoula Democrat-Star announced on January 16, 1903, that \"Mr. A.V. Rosambeau is erecting a neat six-room cottage on Calhoun Avenue\". There is a high probability that this is 908 Calhoun. The von Rosambeau Family utilized it as a rental unit for many years. Probably the most famous person to stay here was the baseball writer, Charles Dryden (1860-1931). In fact, Dryden referred to 908 Calhoun as his \"Winter Rest\".(The Pascagoula Democrat-Star, January 16, 1903)\n\nIn August 1972, Blanche von Rosambeau sold her home to Mr. and Mrs. Ernest H. Brown and Virginia Mary O'Keefe (b. 1950). After selling all of her real estate in 1972, Blanche moved to the Villa Maria retirement apartments at 921 Porter Avenue. Blanche von Rosambeau died in New Orleans at the age of eighty-nine years on May 5, 1982. Like all the von Rosambeau Family she is interred in the Evergreen Cemetery at Ocean Springs.(JXCO, Ms. Land Deed Bk. 437, p. 436)\n\nErnest H. Brown\n\nErnest H. “Ernie” Brown, son of Herman Brown and Theresia Brown of Biloxi, married Virginia Mary O'Keefe (b. 1950) on March 29, 1970. She is the daughter of Jeremiah J. O'Keefe III (b. 1923) and Annette Saxon O'Keefe (1924-1998) of Biloxi. The Browns had four children before their divorce circa 1979: Justin Ernest Brown (1973-2009), who was born while they resided in the house; Katelyn Annette Brown m. Andrew C. Catterall; Joshua C. Brown; and Clinton H. Brown m. Brandi B. Bond. In 1989, Ernest Brown owned the Southern Memorial Park Cemetery on the front beach at Biloxi. Virginia Brown has been employed as an elementary school teacher, tutor director for the Biloxi Public Schools, and vice-president and office manager of Bradford-O'Keefe Funeral Homes, Inc. The Browns conveyed 908 Calhoun to Wilbern H. Thetford and Janice Crews Thetford in August 1974.(The History of Jackson County, Mississippi, 1989, p. 303, JXCO, Ms. Land Deed Bk. 508, p. 370, and The Sun Herald, April 28, 2009, p. A4)\n\nW. Hugh Thetford\n\nWilbern H. Thetford (1931-2016), called Hugh, met his wife, Janice L. Crews (1933-2002), in 1947, at Holdenville, Oklahoma. She was the daughter of Stanley and Madge Crews. Hugh and Janice married in 1949, and began an interesting career in the USAF, which took them to Labrador, Okinawa, Texas, and Mississippi. The Thetfords' two sons, Phillip Wayne Thetford (b. 1951) and Richard Rust Thetford (b. 1957), were born in Wichita Falls, Texas while they were stationed at Sheppard AFB. Phillip Thetford resides at Ashland, Virginia where he is a Presbyterian minister. Richard Thetford is an Apache helicopter pilot with the US Army stationed at Savannah, Georgia.(Janice C. Thetford-March 1993)\n\nPhillip W. Thetford graduated from the University of Southern Mississippi in 1976. He married Mary Flowers in January 1978 and departed Hattiesburg, Mississippi in July 1980 to study at the Union Theological Seminary in Richmond, Virginia.(The Ocean Springs Record, May 22, 1980, p. 8)\n\nHugh Thetford retired from the USAF circa 1979, while stationed at Keesler Field in Biloxi. Immediately he took a consulting position with Lockheed Aircraft and was sent to Saudi Arabia. The nature of his assignment was to assist Lockheed in evaluating the self-sufficiency of the Royal Saudi Air Force. Hugh later found employment in the Civil Service at Keesler AFB.(Janice C. Thetford-March 1993)\n\nJanice L. Thetford worked as a dispatcher for the Ocean Springs Police Department for two-and-one-half-years. In retirement, she occupied her time as an active participant in the Ocean Springs Garden Club and the Womens Club. Janice was a certified master flower judge and a past president of the local garden club. She expired in mid-January 2002. Her corporal remains were interred in the Biloxi National Cemetery.(The Sun Herald, January 20, 2002, p. A-11)\n\nThe Blanche von Rosambeau house is in near original condition. The Thetfords have completed a forty-foot addition to the rear of the house, and added some wallpaper paneling in the dining room. The two original fireplaces are in situ. A friendly \"ghost\", called Omar, roams the Thetford residence occasionally \"borrowing\" items like wedding rings. Omar always returns his booty after giving the owner some anxiety pains! (Janice C. Thetford-March 1993)\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nvon Rosambeau-Gautier House-420 Jackson Avenue-Lot 7\n\nIn March 1880, Mary Ann Soden von Rosambeau (1857-1937), the wife of German immigrant, Augustus von Rosambeau (1849-1912), bought a tract of land on the southeast corner of Jackson Avenue and Calhoun from Margaret Foy (1840-1892).\n"
