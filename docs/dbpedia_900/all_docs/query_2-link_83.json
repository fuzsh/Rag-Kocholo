        "text": "Today, Governor Dan McKee was joined by Senior Deputy Chief of Staff Joseph Almond, Rhode Island State Police (RISP) Superintendent Colonel Darnell Weaver, and Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) Director Peter Alviti to promote safe travel practices in advance of the Saturday’s change to three lanes on the westbound side of the Washington Bridge.\n\nPointing to an increase in accidents on I-195 in the months immediately following the bridge failure, Governor McKee made clear his goal to reduce the number of accidents occurring on the Washington Bridge. The Governor is encouraging travelers to follow the reduced speed limit of 40 miles an hour, avoid switching lanes, and most importantly, stay alert and off cell phones.\n\nIn addition to increased safety signage on the bridge and PSA messaging, RISP has an increased presence on the bridge to help address distracted driving and prevent accidents.\n\nThe addition of a third lane on the westbound side of the Washington Bridge should shorten the time it takes to cross the bridge and ease some of the congestion in the surrounding towns. It may also reduce the number of accidents by eliminating some of the choke points where drivers have had to merge from three to two lanes.\n\nThis comes a little more than a week after RIDOT added a third lane to the eastbound side of the bridge. RIDOT, along with traffic engineering and structural engineering consultants and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) traffic experts, has certified that the bridge structure is sufficient to carry the extra lanes.\n\nBeginning at 9 p.m. on Friday, April 19, RIDOT will begin with changing the traffic pattern on I-195 East to provide three lanes of through travel on the Washington Bridge. RIDOT will restripe the highway during the evening and overnight hours, with change complete by 9 a.m. on Saturday, April 20.\n\nView Press Release\n\nAs part of the previously announced plan to create three lanes of through travel on both sides of the Washington Bridge, the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) announced today it will begin with changing the traffic pattern on I-195 East to provide three lanes of through travel. RIDOT will restripe the highway during the evening and overnight hours tomorrow night, Tuesday, April 9. The change will be in effect for the morning commute on Wednesday, April 10.\n\nWith a number of days of rainy weather forecast for later this week, RIDOT is taking advantage of a window of good weather that will allow the Department to restripe the highway and put part of the new traffic pattern into place.\n\nRIDOT is making these change to reduce congestion and decrease travel times for both directions of I-195 affected by the closure of the Washington Bridge westbound. There will be no change at this time for I-195 West, which will still have two lanes of travel.\n\nWith the change for eastbound travelers, drivers can expect:\n\nLanes will be reduced in width. The left and center lanes will be 10 feet wide, and trucks will be restricted to the far-right lane, which will be 11 feet wide. RIDOT will post signage that trucks must use the far-right lane only.\n\nThe speed limit on I-195 East will be reduced to 40 mph.\n\nIn addition to reducing their speed, drivers should stay in their lane and refrain from any distractions.\n\nView Press Release\n\nAs part of its ongoing project to reduce congestion and travel times and provide three lanes of travel in both directions of I-195 over the Washington Bridge, the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) will be shifting the crossover point for westbound traffic a half-mile closer to the Washington Bridge during the overnight hours Monday, April 8. The change will be complete before the morning commute on Tuesday, April 9. At this time, there will still be two lanes of travel westbound and eastbound.\n\nDrivers will not need to adjust their route. They need to stay in their lanes through the new crossover to the eastbound side of I-195, following the reduced 40 mph speed limit. This change creates a work zone so RIDOT can continue construction necessary to fully implement the three-lane configuration later this month. The Department is on schedule to complete this work on or before April 22.\n\nOther changes in preparation of the full three-lane configuration will precede the full implementation of this change. RIDOT will launch an informational ad campaign to prepare travelers. This work is weather dependent.\n\nView Press Release\n\nToday, Governor Dan McKee, Rhode Island Department of Transportation Director Peter Alviti, and the Governor’s Senior Deputy Chief of Staff T. Joseph Almond held a briefing to share the findings of the structural analysis and the recommendation for the future of the Washington Bridge. A separate forensic analysis of the causes behind the bridge failure is currently underway and will provide the Administration with further insight into accountability in the coming weeks.\n\nSince the two failed tie-rods were found in December 2023, an in-depth inspection of the bridge was performed by a team of engineering companies and reviewed by McNary, Bergeron & Johannesen, a third-party bridge construction firm hired at the direction of the Governor. These findings reinforce that the Administration’s decision to close the bridge on December 11, was absolutely essential to public safety.\n\nThe report identified additional, significant structural deficiencies that cannot viably be repaired. After reviewing the report in totality, McNary, Bergeron & Johannesen concurred with the recommendation that the westbound side of the Washington Bridge be replaced. According to a presentation by Jeff Mehle, an engineer with the firm, this decision means that the bridge’s superstructure must be demolished and replaced and that part, if not all, of the bridge’s substructure may also need to be replaced.\n\n“Rhode Islanders deserve answers, accountability, and a plan of action to restore normalcy to their daily lives. That is what we will deliver,” said Governor Dan McKee. “It is very important to me that Rhode Islanders have confidence in the findings and the recommendation for a path forward for the Washington Bridge. That is why I made sure that a third-party expert, unaffiliated with any current construction projects in Rhode Island, was able to oversee and review all the information gathered for this report.”\n\nThe initial cost estimate for the demolition and bridge replacement is between $250 million and $300 million. Both the demotion and the design-rebuild will be put out to bid to ensure the best use of taxpayer funds. A new bridge could be completed within 18 to 24 months of a contract award according to initial estimates.\n\nGovernor McKee continues to welcome oversight from various entities, including the Department of Justice, the Federal Highway Administration, and the Rhode Island General Assembly.\n\n“I am deeply disturbed by the additional structural deficiencies identified by the in-depth review of the bridge,” Governor McKee added. “When we have all the facts, we will hold any responsible parties fully accountable. The day for accountability will come.”\n\nTo view the structural analysis, McNary, Bergeron & Johannesen’s review, and the presentation from today’s briefing, visit www.washington-bridge.com and scroll down to the bottom of the page to the section titled 'Additional Information & Graphics.'\n\nView Press Release\n\nTo further reduce congestion and travel times caused by the Washington Bridge westbound closure, Governor Dan McKee today announced that the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) will adjust the temporary traffic patterns in East Providence and Providence to provide three lanes of travel in both directions of I-195.\n\n\"Rhode Island remains committed to addressing concerns at the Washington Bridge and providing relief to drivers and travelers,\" said Governor Dan McKee. \"I'd like to thank my Deputy Chief of Staff Joe Almond, Director Peter Alviti, Rhode Island DOT, and our partners at the Federal Highway Administration for working to open this third lane, which will cut back on travel delays and reduce congestion around the bridge.\"\n\nRIDOT, along with traffic engineering and structural engineering consultants and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) traffic experts, have certified that the eastbound bridge structure is sufficient to carry the extra lane. The maximization of the entire paved width of I-195 East with narrowed lanes will increase motor vehicle capacity by 50% and will be safer and more efficient than the existing configuration.\n\nWork will begin on Monday, February 26 with design and ordering materials, followed by construction to move the start of the bypass lanes in East Providence about 3,000 feet west of its current location. The entire process to implement the three-lane configuration and open it to traffic will take approximately eight weeks. The schedule is subject to changes brought about by supply chain issues, adverse weather, and temperature. RIDOT will continuously report on its progress.\n\nRIDOT expects this change will reduce travel times on I-195, in both the eastbound and westbound direction, which will help alleviate traffic on local streets in East Providence that have been busier because of motorists seeking alternate routes.\n\nWith the implementation of the three-lane configuration in both directions, lanes will be narrowed from 12 feet to 10 feet. Trucks will be restricted to the far-right lane in each direction, which will be 11 feet wide, and RIDOT will post signage that trucks must use the far-right lane only.\n\nThe speed limit on I-195 through the bypass lanes in both directions will be reduced to 40 mph.\n\nBecause of the three-lane configuration eastbound, traffic entering the highway from South Water Street and India Street will need to yield when entering the highway. This may cause delays for motorists using this ramp to enter onto I-195 East during rush hour.\n\nOnce the three-lane configuration is put into place, RIDOT will remove the lane reduction on I-195 West just east of the East Shore Expressway near the state line, which was installed in early February. This will no longer be needed with the three-lane configuration.\n\nView Press Release\n\nTo support Rhode Islanders traveling through the East Bay, RIDOT created additional Washington Bridge travel time tools on its website, which now has an easy-to-remember URL: www.washington-bridge.com\n\nThese charts show the change in travel times on different days and hours of the day on nine different routes compared to the travel times motorists were accustomed to before the bridge closed. There is also specific data on actual travel times observed as well as the actual travel times for the week prior to the bridge closure. The Administration will be sharing these new tools with businesses, organizations and other stakeholders impacted by the bridge closure.\n\nTo develop these travel charts, RIDOT uses the same data that is shared among all popular navigation and GPS services, such as Google, Waze, Apple Maps, etc. This is called probe data, a measurement that tracks vehicles based on signals transmitted by cell phones. The data provides information on the speed of the vehicles carrying those cell phones on specific segments. All speed data is computed into travel time based on the length of all segments in each route. These charts will be updated every weekday.\n\nOver the next several months, the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) will be testing new traffic patterns with the goal of alleviating some of the congestion leading up to and on the Washington Bridge. These new patterns will be based on traffic modeling by RIDOT engineers.\n\nStarting at 10 p.m. on Friday night, February 2, the department will begin reducing the number of lanes on I-195 West, from three lanes to two lanes, starting east of the East Shore Expressway entrance to I-195 West. This will expedite travel for those entering I-195 West from the East Shore Expressway, Pawtucket Avenue and Broadway. The department has modeled this traffic pattern and the model appears to show that creating a merge east of the East Shore Expressway should reduce travel time. This pattern will allow those using the East Shore Expressway, Pawtucket Avenue and Broadway ramps to merge more easily.\n\nAs is done with other traffic pattern shifts, RIDOT will test the new pattern on Friday night, monitor its impact closely throughout the weekend and the beginning of the work week (Monday and Tuesday). At the end of the test, RIDOT engineers will decide whether to keep the pattern in place or reverse it based on its effectiveness. RIDOT will use barrels to mark the new pattern to allow for any necessary changes or reversal to be made swiftly.\n\nRIDOT continues to expedite the inspections and analysis of the bridge. This analysis is complex and it takes time. The Department, working in conjunction with several engineering consultants, is working 24/7 to assess the condition of the full bridge and develop an analysis that is comprehensive and will result in a bridge that will be safe.\n\nThe findings of this evaluation will determine the scope of the work that needs to be done, as well as the schedule and cost. Until that is done, RIDOT does not have an estimate on the time to reopen the bridge.\n\nThe analysis could come to a number of conclusions, including repair of the existing structure, or a more extensive reconstruction. A decision will not be made until the analysis is complete. Whichever course of action the Department will take, accelerated bridge construction methods will be used to repair the bridge as quickly as possible.\n\nRegardless of the scope of work, RIDOT is strategizing various construction scenarios to determine how we can phase the work to open new lanes and maximize the flow of traffic as soon as possible. The Department also is developing contingencies for funding to be redirected to this project to assure that it has priority.\n\nToday is the second day of ferry service between Bristol and Providence. On its debut Thursday, 162 people took the ferry. The service continues seven days a week (with the exception of Christmas and New Year’s Day) with three ferry companies providing regular service approximately every half hour. A dedicated website with ferry and RIPTA bus schedules is available at: www.bristolprovidenceferry.com.\n\nRIDOT implemented the ferries as part of a multi-modal solution to the Washington Bridge event. On a daily basis, we will monitor the volume of users in each of the multi-modes, including bikes, pedestrians, transit buses, ferries and highway vehicles and will make adjustments to each as the data guides us.\n\nRIDOT yesterday launched an interactive travel time dashboard. It includes near-to-real-time travel times on common travel routes in the East Bay area to and from Providence and I-95. The information will be updated regularly, and includes hourly reported travel times. This affords commuters the information they need to plan their trips – either to give themselves more time to get to their destination or plan their travel when travel times are lower.\n\nToday RIDOT began ferry service from Bristol to Providence, with three ferry companies providing regular service approximately every half hour.

This affords commuters the information they need to plan their trips – either to give themselves more time to get to their destination or plan their travel when travel times are lower.\n\nAlso today, RIDOT closed the lane on I-195 West that was used for emergency vehicles only. This was necessary to begin reconstruction work on that part of the road. Travelers using the bypass lanes will notice that emergency vehicles are now blended into regular traffic and should slow down and move over for ambulances, police cars and other emergency vehicles. RIDOT thanks you for your patience and consideration.\n\nRIDOT closed emergency vehicle access lane on the old bridge. With improved travel times, vehicles can utilize the bypass. Additionally, construction begins on areas used for the access lane.\n\nThe bypass lanes RIDOT opened on Friday worked well over the weekend and traffic has been flowing smoothly. As expected, traffic volumes and delays were up this morning. RIDOT recommends that drivers continue to use detour routes that work best for them to minimize delay. With the heavy rainfall and wind storm today, including localized power outages, we ask motorists to drive with reduced speed and provide additional time for travel.\n\nRIDOT announces the start of Bristol to Providence ferry service.\n\nRead Full Release Here\n\nThe three ferry providers - SeaStreak, Rhode Island Fast Ferry, and Block Island Ferry will provide temporary ferry service between Bristol and Providence while the bridge is being repaired. Ferries will run at half hour intervals from the Maritime Center in Bristol to India Point Park in Providence, with shuttle bus service from Colt State Park to the ferry dock in Bristol and from India Point to Providence Station. All services will be free. RIDOT estimates it will operate the service until late March. Further information on the ferry will be posted here as it becomes available.\n\nFabrication begins of steel components, both plates and anchor rods, for the bridge repair."
