NYC DOT has designated CB17 as a Priority Bicycle District due to high ridership but lack of adequate bicycle infrastructure. The project aims to close gaps in the bicycle network while improving safety for all road users.\n\nBrooklyn Community Board 17 Bicycle Network Development - presented to Brooklyn Community Board 17 Transportation Committee October 2021 (pdf) Brooklyn Community Board 17 Bicycle Network Development - presented to Brooklyn Community Board 17 Transportation Committee in June 2021 (pdf) Brooklyn Community Board 17 Bicycle Network Development - presented to Brooklyn Community Board 17 Transportation Committee in February 2021 (pdf) Brooklyn Community Board 17 Bicycle Network Development - presented to Brooklyn Community Board 17 Transportation Committee in December 2020 (pdf)\n\nBrooklyn Community District 14 Bicycle Network Expansion\n\nThe Community District 14 Bicycle Network Expansion project seeks to expand the bicycle network in a district that was previously identified as a Bicycle Priority District in NYC DOT’s Safer Cycling Report. A Bicycle Priority District is defined as a community with high number of cyclists that were killed or severely injured (KSI) and a low number of bicycle facility miles. The proposed bicycle routes will help serve the increasing number of people who choose a bike as means of transportation within the community, and eventually outside of Community District 14 with an eventual expansion of the network in the adjacent community.\n\nBrooklyn Community District 14 Bicycle Network Expansion - prensented to Brooklyn Community Board 14 in June 2023 Brooklyn Community District 14 Bicycle Network Expansion - prensented to Brooklyn Community Board 14 in October 2021\n\nBrooklyn Waterfront Greenway\n\nThe Brooklyn Waterfront Greenway is a planned 14-mile pedestrian and bicycle route connecting communities along Brooklyn’s waterfront. Separate paths for bicycles and pedestrians will allow cyclists and walkers to commute, exercise, explore, and relax from Newtown Creek in north Brooklyn to the beginning of the Shore Parkway Greenway in Bay Ridge, creating a full 27-mile greenway along Brooklyn’s waterfront. The Brooklyn Waterfront Greenway is a trunk segment in New York City’s expanding network of greenways, which includes the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway, the Queens East River Greenway, the Shore Parkway Greenway, and the Jamaica Bay Greenway. Over the past decade, New York City has truly opened public access to the waterfront with over 60 miles of public space planned or under construction. The completion of the Brooklyn Waterfront Greenway is a crucial part of this vision. Several segments of the Brooklyn Waterfront Greenway are already in place and include some of the most popular bicycle and pedestrian routes in the City. Altogether, this unique set of pathways, green spaces, and public programs is transforming Brooklyn’s waterfront.\n\nBrooklyn Waterfront Greenway Presentation (pdf) Video: “Greenways in NYC: Brooklyn Waterfront Greenway”\n\nBrownsville Capital Safety Improvements\n\nNYC DOT, with our partners NYC DDC, is proposing capital safety improvements at several intersection and corridor locations in Brownsville, Brooklyn. This capital project will install a series of concrete curb and sidewalk extensions, a raised crosswalk, a Parking Protected Bike Lane along Mother Gaston Boulevard, bus stop consolidation and improvements, expanded median pedestrian refuge and pedestrian islands within the project area. This proposal aims to increase safety within the project area for all users by providing safer, shorter pedestrian crossings, slowing vehicle turns, improving bus service and expanding the bicycle network.Brownsville Capital Safety Improvements - presented to Brooklyn Community Board 16 Transportation and Franchises Committee in April 2021 (pdf)\n\nConey Island Avenue & Cortelyou Road\n\nNYC DOT presented a series of possible scenarios to improve pedestrian safety at Coney Island Avenue and Cortelyou Road.

The streets in the project area consist of granite cobbles, generally in poor condition, with some sections of asphalt. These conditions impede bicycles, are difficult for pedestrians and do not meet Americans with Disability Act (ADA) guidelines. At the same time, community members feel strongly about preserving the character of the neighborhood to the greatest extent possible. NYC DOT is committed to a design that restores all streets with granite cobble in a way that makes these streets available for all users, including cyclists. For the Pearl Plaza, the goal is to create a design responsive to community desires, which incorporates seating and landscape elements in a manner that is consistent with the context, and that provides maximum flexibility for programming. The plaza design will connect Pearl Plaza to an adjacent public space under the Manhattan Bridge Arch. This design project includes extensive community outreach, with three public workshops held as of March, 2013. Following a vigorous discussion about the cobble roadway design at a workshop in January, 2013, the designers incorporated neighborhood feedback and presented revised concepts at a workshop on March 20th. The project team then built granite cobble mock-ups which were viewed by approximately 50-60 members of the public. Based on public input, a presentation was made to the Community Board 2 executive board, which endorsed the project on July 22, 2013. The project design will be submitted and presented to the Landmarks Preservation Commission in September 2013\n\nDUMBO/Vinegar Hill Street & Plaza Reconstruction - presented to Brooklyn Community Board 2 in July 2013 (pdf) DUMBO/Vinegar Hill Street & Plaza Reconstruction workshop presentation materials - March 2013 (pdf)\n\nEastern Parkway, Lincoln Place to Pacific Street\n\nThis NYC DOT School Safety, Vision Zero project aims to improve safety for school-aged pedestrians and cyclists along the Eastern Parkway corridor.

As part of this ongoing work, NYC DOT has developed a comprehensive vision for a vibrant and safe Broadway from Union Square to Columbus Circle which supports local business, community, and culture. Through a flexible toolkit, block types from basic, to slow, to shared, to pedestrianized plazas can be organized to meet a variety of stakeholder needs, amplifying the public realm of each unique neighborhood while building a cohesive transportation network.\n\nAs part of this comprehensive public realm plan for Broadway, NYC DOT is developing design concepts for Broadway between 17th and 21st Streets. In 2023 NYC DOT implemented a series of plazas and shared streets on Broadway between 25th and 32nd Street as well as a formal two-way bike path, connecting Herald Square to Worth Square. In 2021 NYC DOT implemented three projects along the corridor which prioritized pedestrians and cyclists: 1) Slow Streets in Flatiron, 21st to 23rd Streets; 2) A Plaza and Slow Street in the Garment District, 38th to 40th Streets; and 3) Slow Streets in Times Square, 48th to 50th Streets.\n\nBroadway Vision - East 17th Street to East 21st Street - What's Happening Here Flyer Broadway Vision - East 17th Street to East 21st Street - presented to Community Board 5 in March 2024 Broadway Vision - 2023 Design Concepts August 2023 Broadway Vision Update - presented to Manhattan Community Board 5 in August 2022 Broadway Vision - 2022 Design Concepts - presented to Manhattan Community Board 5 in June 2022 (pdf) Broadway Vision, 2021 Project Proposals - presented to Manhattan Community Board 5 in April 2021 (pdf) Broadway Vision, Union Square to Columbus Circle - presented to Manhattan Community Board 5 in January 2020 (pdf) Broadway, 50th Street to 47th Street - Resurfacing Flyer (pdf) Broadway, 23rd Street to 18th Street - Resurfacing Flyer (pdf)\n\nCanal Street, West Side Highway to Manhattan Bridge\n\nNYC DOT hosted a virtual workshop to discuss multi-modal safety and accessibility improvements along Canal Street from the West Side Highway to the Manhattan Bridge.\n\nCanal Street Visioning Project - Street Ambassador Outreach Summary - Spring 2022 Canal Street, West Side Highway to Manhattan Bridge - Virtual Workshop in March 2022 (pdf) Add your feedback on the Canal Street Map\n\nChinatown Connections\n\nIn 2023, NYC DOT hosted virtual and in-person public workshops to discuss issues and opportunities around Park Row and Kimlau Square as a first step to coordinate ongoing efforts in the neighborhood with the recent New York State funding allocated as part of their Downtown Revitalization Initiative.
