Table of Contents 309 U.S. INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS IN 1997 The U.S. current account deficit widened further in 1997, reaching $166 billion. U.S. imports of goods continued to exceed exports by a substantial margin. However, goods trade accounted for only a small part of the deterioration in the current account balance last year. The shift of investment income from positive to negative (the first time since 1914) was the major contributing factor; it reflected the cumulative effect of deficits in the current account that have persisted since 1982 and the balancing net capital inflows. The financial crises in Asia in the second half of 1997 visibly affected U.S. capital flows but influenced the U.S. current account in only a limited way in that year. Their effect on the U.S. current account is likely to be more apparent in 1998. 322 INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION AND CAPACITY UTILIZATION FOR MARCH 1998 Industrial production increased 0.2 percent in March, to 127.7 percent of its 1992 average; revised estimates of output now show declines of 0.2 percent in both January and February. The rate of industrial capacity utilization decreased 0.1 percentage point in March, to 82.2 percent. 325 STATEMENTS TO THE CONGRESS Alan Greenspan, Chairman, Board of Governors, discusses the global financial system and the current Asian crisis and says that he fully backs the Administration's request to augment the financial resources of the International Monetary Fund by approving as quickly as possible U.S. participation in the New Arrangements to Borrow and an increase in the U.S. quota in the IMF; hopefully neither will turn out to be needed and no funds will be drawn, before the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, March 3, 1998. 326 Laurence H. Meyer, Member, Board of Governors, testifies on behalf of the Federal Reserve Board on proposals in S. 1405 to allow the payment of interest on demand deposits and on the required reserve balances of depositories at the Federal Reserve and says that the Federal Reserve strongly supports these measures and that eliminating price distortions on demand deposits and on required and excess reserve balances would spare the economy wasteful expenditure, increase the efficiency of our financial markets, and facilitate the conduct of monetary policy, before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, March 3, 1998. 330 Chairman Greenspan briefly reviews the outlook for the economy and discusses the coming budgetary challenges and says that projections of budgetary surpluses are based on an extrapolation of steady economic growth and subdued inflation in coming years and that achieving such a performance in these uncertain times, with the U.S. economy now subject to a fine balance of powerful forces of expansion and restraint, will provide policymakers with a considerable challenge, before the House Committee on the Budget, March 4, 1998. 332 Governor Meyer comments further on S. 1405, the Financial Regulatory Relief and Economic Efficiency Act of 1997, and says that the Board supports several sections of this bill that eliminate unnecessary regulatory burdens but believes that several other provisions appear inadvertently to have gone beyond the goal of regulatory relief and may result in changes to the law that were neither intended nor desired; these include the elimination of a number of important limitations that have been applied to nonbank banks, expansion of the mixing of commerce and banking by owners of savings associations, the Federal Reserve's making available intraday credit in the form of daylight overdrafts to the Federal Home Loan Banks, allowing banks to discount the price of products and services that are offered in bundles to consumers, and allowing bank affiliations with government-sponsored enterprises, before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, March 10, 1998. 337 ANNOUNCEMENTS Shift from a contemporaneous system of reserve requirements to a lagged basis. Issuance of an interim rule to Regulation E permitting depository institutions to deliver disclosures electronically. Publication of a revision to the official staff commentary to Regulation Z. Issuance of a final rule on the expansion of the examination frequency cycle for certain financial institutions.

The U.S. current account deficit widened further in 1997, reaching $166 billion. U.S. imports of goods continued to exceed exports by a substantial margin (table 1). However, goods trade accounted for only a small part of the deterioration in the current account balance last year. The shift of investment income from positive to negative (the first time since 1914) was the major contributing factor; it reflected the cumulative effect of deficits in the current account that have persisted since 1982 and the balancing net capital inflows. The financial crises in Asia in the second half of 1997 visibly affected U.S. capital flows but influenced the U.S. current account in only a limited way in that year. Their effect on the U.S. current account is likely to be more apparent in 1998. The current account deficit in 1997 was almost as large as the record deficit in 1987; relative to the size of the U.S. economy, however, it was substantially smaller (2 percent of gross domestic product in 1997 versus 3.6 percent in 1987).

U.S. Economic (iiowth and Exchange Rate Developments The U.S. economy grew at a robust pace in 1997 (table 2). Aggregate demand (including the demand for imports of goods and services) was strong, and corporate profits (including the profits of U.S. affiliates of foreign companies) were high. Inflation nonetheless remained subdued, partly because of decreases in the prices of imported goods as a result of the appreciation of the dollar against many currencies and because of declines in prices on international commodity markets. From December 1996 to December 1997 the dollar gained 12 percent in nominal terms against an average (weighted by multilateral trade weights) of the currencies of the other Group of Ten (G-10) countries (chart 1). The dollar appreciated in terms of the other G-10 currencies during the first half of 1997, as the continuing strength of U.S. economic activity raised expectations of further tightening of U.S. monetary conditions. Also, the dollar tended to rise in terms of the German mark and other continental European currencies because of concerns about the implications of the transition to the European Economic and Monetary Union and perceptions that monetary policy was not likely to tighten significantly in prospec- LIT Billions of dollars Item 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 -56.4 -90.8 -1335 -I29J -148-2 -18J -39.2 -96.1 56.9 -72.3 -132.6 603 -104.4 -16&2 61.8 -101.9 -173.6 71.7 -111.0 -191.2 80.1 -2.6 Services, net Portfolio investment, net Direct investment, net 18.0 -33.6 51.6 19.7 -36.0 55.7 9.7 -41.0 50.8 6.8 -53,2 60.0 2,8 -143 66.8 67,7 -35.2 -38.1 -38.8 -34.0 -40.0 -38.5 Current account Balance Trade la goods and services, net ..

In the first half of the year, the dollar fluctuated against the Japanese yen in response to varying indicators of the strength of the Japanese expansion. But in the second half, the yen depreciated in response to evidence of faltering economic activity and perceptions of fragility in the Japanese financial sector. The perceptions of fragility were heightened by concerns about the negative effect on Japan of the financial crises elsewhere in Asia.

Robust U.S. economic growth and tax collections moved the federal government budget close to balance in 1997. In general, reducing government dissaving would tend to move the current account toward balance as well; however, the current account deficit has been widening. In terms of national income accounting identities, the growing U.S. current account deficit (and the related national income concept, negative net foreign investment) must reflect a growing gap between domestic investment and saving (chart 2). However, the statistical discrepancy in the national income accounts has shifted from a large positive value to a large negative value in recent years, obscuring whether increases in investment, or reductions in private savings, or both have been the counterpart to the growing current account deficits. In any case, the inflow of foreign savings, which has financed part of U.S. investment over the past decade and a half, has raised productive capacity relative to what it would have been but has required ongoing payments of investment income to foreigners. Asian I•'inaiicial Crises In July, strong downward pressure on the Thai baht marked the beginning of a series of Asian financial crises. Severe financial market pressures spread to other East Asian countries—most notably Indonesia and South Korea. These pressures appeared to have been triggered mainly by market concerns over substantial external deficits, possibly overvalued exchange rates, weak financial systems, sizable foreign-currency-denominated indebtedness, and government policy responses that were widely viewed as inadequate. The financial market pressures persisted despite the initiation of several financial assistance agreements led by the International Monetary Fund. Several countries experienced sharp depreciations in their currencies. Between the end of June and the end of December, the Thai baht, Korean won, and Indonesian rupiah lost about half their value; the Indonesian rupiah continued to fall sharply in early 1998 (chart 3). The financial market turmoil in East Asia spread to Hong Kong and, to a lesser extent, Taiwan. However, the peg of the Hong Kong currency to the U.S. dollar has been successfully maintained, and the depreciation of the Taiwan dollar has been relatively small. The turmoil in Asian financial markets was accompanied by sharp declines in stock prices, increases in interest rates, sharply reduced credit availability, U.S. International Transactions in 1997 L ' .

As a consequence, economic activity slowed markedly in several Asian developing economies in the second half of 1997; growth between the second and fourth quarters of 1997 for these economies as a group averaged only about 2% percent at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, or less than half the 6 percent or more of earlier periods (table 2). This slowdown is expected to continue into 1998. ened the outlook for external demand and heightened concerns about the fragility of Japan's financial sector. heonontie Growth in Other Developing and Industrial Countries Financial markets in some Latin American countries also came under pressure as the Asian crises led investors to reassess the riskiness of their exposures. However, despite considerable pressure, both the Brazilian exchange rate regime and the peg of the Argentine peso to the dollar held. In Brazil, high domestic interest rates and the tightening of macroeconomic policy to support the exchange rate weakened domestic demand toward the end of the year. In Mexico, the recovery of economic activity from the recession following the 1994—95 crisis continued, although the peso weakened. On average, economic growth in Latin America (weighted by shares in U.S. exports) was robust in 1997 (table 2). Economic growth in the industrial countries finned in 1997 (table 2). Growth in Canada was particularly robust, and most of the European countries also showed some improvement. Japan was a notable exception, as the growth of real GDP stalled partly in response to sizable fiscal contraction.

A small increase in the deficit in trade in goods was almost matched by the increase in the surplus in services trade. However, because of differing price developments among the trade components, the trade deficit in terms of chained (1992) dollars continued to grow, and net exports subtracted about 0.6 percentage point from the growth of U.S. GDP between the fourth quarter of 1996 and the fourth quarter of 1997. i.

Given the loss of export price competitiveness associated with the appreciation of the dollar against many currencies over the past two years (chart 4), the strength of U.S. exports of goods in 1997 was somewhat surprising. Sustained economic growth The value of U.S. exports of goods and services grew $83 billion in 1997, or about 10 percent, an acceleration from the 7 percent gain in 1996 (table 3).

In contrast, exports to Japan declined slightly, and those to developing countries in Asia grew moderately, although more rapidly than in 1996. The financial crises in Asian developing economies had little noticeable effect on U.S. exports of goods in 1997. Capital goods accounted for substantially more than half of the increase in the value of U.S. exports of goods in 1997 (table 3). Smaller increases were reported for a broad range of other products, including industrial supplies, automotive products, and consumer goods.

However, even taking strong foreign economic growth into account, U.S. exports increased more than would have been expected based on estimated income and price elasticities. U.S. exporters probably benefited from the trend in Mexico and other Latin American countries away from policies that sheltered domestic producers from international competition. The growth in the value of U.S. exports was largely the result of the rapid growth in the quantity of goods exported rather than increases in prices (table 5). ?.

Quantities are measured in chained (1992) dollars. SOURCE. U.S. Department of Commerce, national income and product accounts. Exports of private services grew $16 billion, or about 7 percent (table 6). The largest dollar increase was in \"other private services,\" a catchall category' that included particularly large increases in U.S. receipts for business, professional, and technical services, and financial services. U.S. receipts of royalties and license fees and exports of \"other private services\" largely reflect the U.S. comparative advantage in services that depend heavily on technological expertise and contribute significantly to the net surplus in services trade enjoyed by the United States. Exports of traditional services like travel, passenger fares, and transportation continued to account for more than half of U.S. services exports in 1997, but the growth of these traditional exports was moderated by the appreciation of the dollar and the resulting decline in U.S. price competitiveness. Imports The value of U.S. imports of goods and services grew $85 billion in 1997 (about 9 percent), somewhat faster than the rate in 1996 (table 3). As on the export side, imports of goods grew more rapidly than imports of services. Imports were spurred by strong economic growth in the United States in 1997 together with a decline in the price competitiveness of U.S. goods (chart 4), largely as the result of the appreciation of the dollar against many currencies. Oil Imports Although the volume of oil imports increased about 5 percent from 1996 to 1997, their value fell slightly because of a 5 percent decline in the average price. Several factors contributed to the fall in oil prices and, at the time of this writing, have induced a further decline from levels prevailing at the end of 1997. Changes in the prices of imported oil have tended to mirror changes in spot oil prices (West Texas intermediate) with a lag of several weeks (chart 5). Spot prices had risen quite sharply during the second half of 1996, from $ 18.54 per barrel in June to $25.39 314 (t Federal Reserve Bulletin • May 1998 SLT\\ k.v lr;iiis;n.'

Once Iraq began producing oil for export at the beginning of 1997, spot oil prices fell sharply, from an average of $25.17 per barrel in January to $19.72 in April. Spot prices traded in a range of $19 to $20 per barrel during the remainder of the year. Oil import prices averaged about $18.63 per barrel in 1997, about a dollar below the average for 1996. Spot prices fell during January and February of 1998 as a result of several developments: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates raised production in line with increases in their OPEC quota; warmer-than-normal weather from El Nino softened demand for home heating oil; and the economic turmoil in East Asia reduced shipments to those emerging economies. The quantity of oil imports rose from an average of 9.4 million barrels per day in 1996 to 9.9 million in 1997 (table 7). An increase in U.S. consumption in the range of 0.4 million barrels per day accounted for most of the increase in the quantity of imports, as U.S. production has been little changed over the past four years. — 15 I I 1985 I 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 I II Non-Oil Imports 1997 NOTE.

Large increases in imports of consumer goods as well as capital goods accounted for much of the increase; imports of automotive products also rose more than they had in 1996. The industrial countries continued to account for more than half of U.S. non-oil imports in 1997. However, imports from developing countries continued to grow much faster than average (table 8).

The data on investment income were revised in light of the results of the Benchmark Survey of U.S. Ownership of Foreign Long-Term Securities, discussed later. As a result of large and persistent U.S. current account deficits over the past decade and a half, foreign assets in the United States have grown more rapidly than U.S. assets abroad. However, net investment income remained positive (chart 7) long after the net investment position became negative because foreign direct investment in the United States has earned a far lower rate of return than U.S. direct investment abroad. nomic growth in many of the countries where the United States has substantial investments and continued large additions to holdings by U.S. investors. Direct investment receipts have tended to increase along with the growth of U.S. investments (chart 8), although they have varied with economic conditions abroad. Economic growth was strong in Latin America, Canada, and Western Europe in 1997, areas that account for the largest shares of U.S. direct investment abroad (table 10). In contrast, economic growth in Japan was anemic, and growth in the Asian developing economies fell sharply toward the end of the year. However, these Asian economies (including Japan) accounted for less than 15 percent of the stock of U.S. direct investment abroad at the end of 1996. Whereas income on investments in these Asian economies declined, particularly in the last half of 1997, favorable developments in the rest of the world kept receipts on direct investment up for the year.

Direct investment payments have not always kept pace with the growth of foreign direct investment in the United States; between 1980 and 1993 the direct investment position increased sharply, but payments showed no upward trend (chart 9). The rate of return on foreign direct investment in the United States remains low by any measure—far below the rate of return earned by U.S. direct investors abroad. Three measures of rates of return can be calculated. In each measure (shown in table 11), receipts or payments reported by direct investors are divided by estimates of the value of direct investment assets outstanding during the year. Historical cost is the price at which the assets were purchased; current cost adjusts the historical accounting values for inventories and plant and equipment to reflect movements in current replacement cost indexes; and market value adjusts the ownership position using general indexes of stock market prices.

I estimate changes in the value of assets are imprecise and do not take into account developments that may be important to the value of specific investments. As noted previously, the differential in rates of return between U.S. direct investment abroad and foreign direct investment in the United States has mitigated the effect of the negative U.S. net investment position on net investment income. Two important issues are whether these reported differentials are accurate and whether they are likely to persist. Numerous factors have probably contributed to the differential in reported rates of return. First, investments in many places overseas are more risky than investments in the United States, so some differential in rates of return should be expected. Moreover, many foreign investors who participated in the rapid increase in direct investment in the United States in the late 1980s had limited experience with foreign investments and made serious errors of judgment. Particularly ill-fated were Japanese investments in iinc^tincnl.

Receipts and payments are estimated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the Department of Commerce based on estimates of holdings, dividend-payout ratios, and interest rates. Net portfolio income fell sharply in 1997, largely because of growing U.S. net international indebtedness (table 9). Over the past decade, the decline of net income has closely mirrored the growth of the negative net portfolio investment position (chart 10). I t I I I I I I I I I I I I I I 1981 im 1989 1993 NOTE.

The data on international capital flows that are gathered regularly by the Treasury International Capital (or TIC) Reports cover only purchases and sales of securities, not holdings. For the past fifty years, the BEA has had to rely on estimates of the value of U.S. holdings based on cumulative capital flows since World War II and estimates of changes in values. Estimates of holdings made by this method are likely to be increasingly inaccurate as time elapses. Results of the Benchmark Survey of U.S. Ownership of Foreign Lon^-lerni Securities The data on net portfolio investment income were revised in 1997 to take into account the newly available results of the Treasury Department's Benchmark Survey of U.S. Ownership of Foreign Long-Term Securities. These results indicated that official statistics had been significantly underestimating U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign equities and debt instruments with maturities longer than one year. As a result, the U.S. net international investment position was correspondingly less negative, and U.S. investment income slightly larger, than previously indicated. \\Z. l.'.N. liMi-j-kTin s i - ' u n r i l a ' s . I n c o u n t ! v o\\ The results of the recent survey indicate that, at the end of March 1994, U.S. residents held $304 billion in foreign bonds and $567 billion in foreign equities (table 12). Issuers from Canada and the other industrial countries accounted for most of the bonds held by U.S. residents.

About half of the long-term debt securities were denominated in U.S. dollars. Much smaller shares were accounted for by the yen, deutsche mark, and Canadian dollar, and the rest was spread across a wide variety of currencies. However, these results are of limited use in assessing the exchange rate exposure of U.S. investors because exposures may be hedged. Analysis of bond holdings by sector of issuer indicates that governments and international organizations constituted the largest category by far, accounting for more than 60 percent of the total. About one-third of reported holdings involved bonds issued by foreigners in the United States. Industrial countries also accounted for the bulk of U.S. holdings of foreign equities. Two countries, the United Kingdom and Japan, together accounted for more than one-third of total U.S. holdings. However, holdings of equities issued by entities in developing economies were not negligible. Both Mexico and Hong Kong were among the top ten issuers. More than one-fourth of U.S. holdings was accounted for by American Depository Receipts (ADRs)—stocks that were specifically marketed to U.S. investors. Comparison of the benchmark survey results for the end of March 1994 with the BEA's earlier end-ofyear estimates for 1993 and 1994 indicate that the BEA had been underestimating U.S. holdings by substantial amounts (table 13). Possible explanations for these errors are numerous. First, TIC reporting of purchases and sales of securities may have contained errors and omissions. Over time, U.S. investors and their fund managers have increasingly transacted directly in foreign markets, thus bypassing the U.S. financial intermediaries that form the core of the TIC reporting system. To ensure adequate coverage, the TIC reporting system has had to continually expand its list of reporters, and at times, Treasury has been slow to do so. Even if the TIC Reports covered 95 percent of net purchases, the omitted investments would cumulate to substantial sums over an extended period. l.v I S . liolilinys of foreign securities: Rarlier RF.A estimates and benchmark survey results. 1443-94 Billions of dollars Item Earlier BEA estimates, yeawmd \\m AO fo«lgnsecurities SSI Bonds Equities 248 303 332. 32* Benchmark survey results, end of March 1994 Second, the BEA's estimate of price changes may be inaccurate because the TIC Reports do not provide adequate information to identify with certainty the country of issue, currency, or term of the securities purchased. Moreover, the weights of various equities in U.S. portfolios may not mirror stock market price indexes that are readily available and used by the BEA. The BEA raised its estimates of U.S. holdings of foreign securities at the end of 1994 more than $330 billion (about 60 percent) in light of the results of the benchmark survey. The BEA also revised its estimates of U.S. holdings from 1985 forward. The revisions to holdings of equities were much larger (both in dollar and percentage terms) than the revisions to holdings of bonds. Moreover, the benchmark survey results indicate that the BEA's methodology had produced large errors in the estimated distribution of bond holdings by country and currency. In particular, holdings of Japanese bonds were much larger than estimated, as were holdings of foreigncurrency-denominated bonds. Both the revision to the level of holdings and the change in composition had implications for the BEA's estimates of investment income for the period 1985 to the present. The BEA's revisions to investment income receipts in 1994 as a result of the benchmark survey amounted to an increase of about $10 billion. The revision to income was small relative to the revision to holdings for two reasons. First, the bulk of the revision in the estimated position involved estimated holdings of equities, and dividend-payout ratios for foreign stocks tend to be low. (Capital gains are excluded from investment income in these accounts.) Second, the survey indicated larger holdings of foreign-currencydenominated bonds than the BEA had previously estimated, particularly low-yielding, yendenominated bonds. The BEA made no revisions to the published data on capital flows as a result of the benchmark survey. The BEA could not determine whether the errors in the estimates of holdings were the result of unreported net purchases of foreign securities or errors in its estimates of valuation changes over the previous half a century; moreover, the BEA had no basis for determining the dates of unreported securities transactions. m CAPITAI, ACCOUNT TRANSACTIONS m Foreign ownership of assets in the United States and U.S. ownership of assets abroad both rose signifi- SS7 SOURCE. U.S. Department of Commerce and Department of (he Treasury. 319 320 Federal Reserve Bulletin • May 1998 cantly in 1997, an increase reflecting the continuing trend toward the globalization of financial markets as well as goods markets. Direct investment flows (both inward and outward) and private purchases of U.S. securities were particularly strong. Evidence of the gathering financial storm in Asia was apparent in U.S. capital flows mainly during the last quarter. In 1997, in contrast to earlier years, increases in foreign official holdings in the United States did not play a major role in the capital flows that are the counterpart to the current account deficit (table 14). Foreign official assets in the United States rose $45 billion in the first three quarters of 1997, below the pace for 1996; the increases were concentrated in the assets of certain industrial countries and members of OPEC. In the fourth quarter, foreign official assets declined sharply; the declines were concentrated in assets of Asian countries and of several developing countries outside Asia that were experiencing exchange market pressures. For the year as a whole, foreign official holdings in the United States rose only $18 billion. In contrast, increases in the assets of other foreigners in the United States in 1997 about equaled or surpassed previous records. Net purchases of U.S. stocks were particularly strong—a record $67 billion. Net purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds by private foreigners remained robust; more than $30 billion of U.S. Treasury securities were purchased in October alone, when developments in Asia led to a flight to quality. As the end of the year approached, however, 14. some foreign private holdings of U.S. Treasury securities were liquidated. In addition, foreign direct investment in the United States amounted to a new high of $108 billion, as the strong pace of mergers and acquisitions across national borders continued. U.S. direct investment abroad in 1997 also reached a record net outflow—$119 billion. U.S. net purchases of foreign securities in the first three quarters were $76 billion, a little below the pace for 1996; however, net purchases fell sharply in the fourth quarter, probably in reaction to the perceptions of higher risk arising from financial turmoil in Asia. Banks in the United States reported a large increase in net claims on foreigners in the first three quarters of the year, but these outflows were largely reversed toward the end of the year. With net recorded capital inflows to the United States exceeding the large U.S. current account deficit in 1997, the U.S. international accounts recorded a large negative statistical discrepancy for the second year in a row (table 14). This negative discrepancy indicates that net payments in the current account or net outflows in the capital account have been unrecorded. For example, illegal drug imports would contribute to a negative discrepancy, as would unrecorded investments abroad by U.S. residents or overstated capital inflows. Although the statistical discrepancy in the U.S. accounts tended to be positive in the years before 1990, large negative discrepancies have become more common since then for reasons that are not well understood.

Until the economies of the countries directly affected begin to rebound, U.S. transactions with them, including exports of goods and services and the profits of direct investors, are likely to be depressed. The negative ramifications of the Asian crises for other trading partners may depress their 321 demand for U.S. exports as well. The recent appreciation of the dollar and the associated loss in competitiveness of U.S. goods and services is also likely to continue to have a negative effect on the U.S. trade balance in 1998. On the other hand, continued strong growth in Latin America, Canada, and Western Europe, which account for the bulk of U.S. exports and direct investment, would tend to counteract the negative repercussions of Asian developments. • 322 Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for March 1998 Released for publication April 17 Industrial production increased 0.2 percent in March; revised estimates of output now show declines of 0.2 percent in both January and February. The output of utilities jumped in March as temperatures throughout the country returned to more normal levels. The output of mines rose 0.2 percent, while production in manufacturing slipped 0.2 percent for the second consecutive month. At 127.7 percent of its 1992 average, total industrial production in March was 4.3 percent higher than it was in March 1997. For the first quarter as a whole, output grew about 1 percent at an annual rate. The rate of industrial capacity utilization decreased 0.1 percentage point in March, to 82.2 percent.

MARKET GROUPS The production of consumer goods remained flat, as declines of 0.4 percent in the output of durable consumer goods and of non-energy nondurable goods were offset by an increase of 3.3 percent in the output of energy goods, most notably sales of residential electricity and gas. The falloff was widespread within durable consumer goods. The output of automotive products and furniture declined again, and the production of household appliances dropped somewhat from the high level in February. Among non-energy nondurable consumer goods, the production of both clothing and paper products dropped more than 1 percent. The output of business equipment slowed in the first quarter, edging down 0.1 percent in March after having dropped 0.7 percent in January and 0.4 percent in February. Nonetheless, the production of busi 1998 High, 1988-89 2. Contains components in addition to those shown, r Revised, p Preliminary. ness equipment was still 6.8 percent above the level of a year ago. In March, continued strength in the production of computer and office equipment was more than offset by decreases in the assemblies of motor vehicles and aircraft and in the output of communications equipment. The production of construction supplies declined 1.0 percent after having increased 1.1 percent in February; output remains well above its level at the end of last year. The output of materials increased 0.5 percent after two months of weakness, but the level of output in March was still slightly below the December level. While the production of durable and nondurable goods materials edged down, the output of energy materials increased sharply. Among durable goods materials, the output of parts for consumer goods, which had spiked up in the fourth quarter, dropped back, on balance, in the first quarter. Growth in the output of equipment parts, which include parts for high-technology equipment, has slowed recently. 324 Federal Reserve Bulletin • May 1998 INDUSTRY GROUPS The output at durable and nondurable goods producers declined 0.2 percent. Within durables, increases in computer and office equipment, semiconductors, and instruments were offset by weakness elsewhere. In particular, the output of primary metals; stone, clay, and glass products; furniture and fixtures; and transportation equipment posted significant losses. Among nondurable industries, production fell in every major industry, except petroleum and chemical products. The operating rate in manufacturing declined to 80.9 percent. Utilization rates in advanced-processing and primary-processing industries fell for the third consecutive month. The operating rate in advancedprocessing industries in March was 1.4 percentage points below its long-run average, whereas the utilization rate in primary-processing industries was still significantly above its long-run average. • 325 Statements to the Congress Statement by Alan Greenspan, Chairman, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, before the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations of the Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, March 3,1998 The global financial system has been evolving rapidly in recent years. New technology has radically reduced the costs of borrowing and lending across traditional national borders, facilitating the development of new instruments and drawing in new players. Information is transmitted instantaneously around the world, and huge shifts in the supply and demand for funds naturally follow, resulting in a massive increase in capital flows. This burgeoning global system has been demonstrated to be a highly efficient structure that has significantly facilitated cross-border trade in goods and services and, accordingly, has made a substantial contribution to standards of living worldwide. Its efficiency exposes and punishes underlying economic imprudence swiftly and decisively. Regrettably, it also appears to have facilitated the transmission of financial disturbances far more effectively than ever before. Three years ago, the Mexican crisis was the first such episode associated with our new high tech international financial system. The current Asian crisis is the second. We do not as yet fully understand the new system's dynamics. We are learning fast and need to update and modify our institutions and practices to reduce the risks inherent in the new regime. Meanwhile, we have to confront the current crisis with the institutions and techniques we have. Many argue that the current crisis should be allowed to run its course without support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the bilateral financial backing of other nations. They assert that allowing this crisis to play out, while doubtless having additional negative effects on growth in Asia, and engendering greater spillovers onto the rest of the world, is not likely to have a large or lasting impact on the United States and the world economy. They may well be correct in their judgment. There is, however, a small but not negligible probability that the upset in East Asia could have unexpectedly large negative effects on Japan, Latin America, and eastern and central Europe that, in turn, could have repercussions elsewhere, including the United States. Thus, while the probability of such an outcome may be small, its consequences, in my judgment, should not be left solely to chance. We have observed that global financial markets, as currently organized, do not always achieve an appropriate equilibrium, or at least require time to stabilize. Opponents of IMF support for member countries facing international financial difficulties also argue that such substantial financial backing, by cushioning the losses of imprudent investors, could encourage excessive risk-taking. There doubtless is some truth in that, though arguably it has been the expectation of governments' support of their financial systems that has been the more obvious culprit, at least in the Asian case. In any event, any expectations of broad bailouts have turned out to have been disappointed. Many if not most investors in Asian economies have to date suffered substantial losses. Asian equity losses, excluding Japanese companies, since June 1997, worldwide, are estimated to have exceeded $700 billion, at the end of January, of which more than $30 billion had been lost by U.S. investors. Substantial further losses have been recorded in bonds and real estate. Moreover, the policy conditionally, associated principally with IMF lending, which dictates economic and financial discipline and structural change, helps to mitigate some of the inappropriate risktaking. Such conditionality is also critical to the success of the overall stabilization effort. At the root of the problems is poor public policy that has resulted in misguided investments and very weak financial sectors. Convincing a sovereign nation to alter destructive policies that impair its own performance and threaten contagion to its neighbors is best handled by an international financial institution, such as the IMF. What we have in place today to respond to crises should be supported even as we work to improve those mechanisms and institutions. Some observers have also expressed concern about whether we can be confident that IMF programs for countries, in particular the countries of East Asia, are likely to alter their economies significantly and permanently. My sense is that one consequence of this Asian crisis is an increasing awareness in the region 326 Federal Reserve Bulletin • May 1998 that market capitalism, as practiced in the West, especially in the United States, is the superior model; that is, it provides greater promise of producing rising standards of living and continuous growth. Although East Asian economies have exhibited considerable adherence to many aspects of free market capitalism, there has nonetheless been a pronounced tendency toward government-directed investment, using the banking system to finance that investment. Given a record of real growth rates of close to 10 percent per annum over an extended period of time, it is not surprising that it has been difficult to convince anyone that the economic system practiced in East Asia could not continue to produce positive results indefinitely. After the breakdown, an increasing awareness, bordering in some cases on shock, that their economic model was incomplete, or worse, has arguably emerged in the region. As a consequence, many of the leaders of these countries and their economic advisers are endeavoring to move their economies much more rapidly toward the type of economic system that we have in the United States. The IMF, whatever one might say about its policy advice in the past, is trying to play a critical role in this process, providing advice and incentives that promote sound money and long-term stability. The IMF's current approach in Asia is fully supportive of the views of those in the West who understand the importance of greater reliance on market forces, reduced government controls, scaling back of government-directed investment, and embracing greater transparency—the publication of all the data that are relevant to the activities of the central bank. the government, financial institutions, and private companies. It is a reasonable question to ask how long this conversion to embracing market capitalism in all its details will last in countries once temporary IMF support is no longer necessary. We are, after all, dealing with sovereign nations with long traditions not always consonant with market capitalism. There can be no guarantees, but my sense is that there is a growing understanding and appreciation of the benefits of market capitalism as we practice it—that what is being prescribed in IMF programs fosters their own interests. The just-inaugurated president of Korea, from what I can judge, is unquestionably aware of the faults of the Korean system that contributed to his country's crisis; he appears to be very strenuously endeavoring to move his economy and society in the direction of freer markets and a more flexible economy. In these efforts, he and other leaders in the region with similar views have the support of many younger people, a large proportion educated in the West, who see the advantages of market capitalism and who will soon assume the mantle of leadership. Accordingly, I fully back the Administration's request to augment the financial resources of the IMF by approving as quickly as possible U.S. participation in the New Arrangements to Borrow and an increase in the U.S. quota in the IMF. Hopefully, neither will turn out to be needed, and no funds will be drawn. But it is better to have it available if that turns out not to be the case and quick response to a pending crisis is essential. Statement by Laurence H. Meyer, Member; Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, March 3, 1998 balances distort market prices and lead to economically wasteful efforts to circumvent them. Because of recent financial market innovations, the proposals are also important for monetary policy. Balances that depository institutions must hold at Federal Reserve Banks to meet reserve requirements pay no interest. Reserve requirements are now 10 percent of all transaction deposits above a threshold level. Requirements may be satisfied either with vault cash or with balances held in accounts at Federal Reserve Banks. Depositories have naturally always attempted to reduce such non-interest-bearing balances to the minimum. For more than two decades, some commercial banks have done so in part by sweeping the reservable transaction deposits of businesses into nonreservable instruments. These business sweeps not only avoid reserve requirements but also allow firms to earn interest on instruments that are, effectively, equivalent to demand deposits. I welcome the opportunity to testify on behalf of the Federal Reserve Board on proposals in S. 1405 to allow the payment of interest on demand deposits and on the required reserve balances of depositories at the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve strongly supports these measures. We have commented favorably on such proposals on a number of previous occasions over the years, and the reasons for those positions still hold today. We also believe the legislation should include a provision to allow the Federal Reserve to pay interest on excess reserves. These legislative proposals are important for economic efficiency: Unnecessary restrictions on the payment of interest on demand deposits and reserve Statements to the Congress In recent years, developments in computer technology have allowed depositories to begin sweeping consumer transaction deposits into nonreservable accounts. In consequence, the balances that depositories hold at Reserve Banks to meet reserve requirements have fallen to quite low levels. These consumer sweep programs are expected to spread further, threatening to lower required reserve balances to levels that may begin to impair the implementation of monetary policy. Should this occur, the Federal Reserve would need to adapt its monetary policy instruments, which could involve disruptions and costs to private parties as well as to the Federal Reserve. However, if interest were allowed to be paid on required reserve balances and on demand deposits, changes in the procedures used for implementing monetary policy might not be needed. The prohibition of the payment of interest on demand deposits was enacted in the depression atmosphere of the mid-1930s. At that time, the Congress was concerned that large money center banks might have earlier been bidding deposits away from country banks to make loans to stock market speculators, in the process depriving rural areas of financing. It is unclear whether the rationale for this prohibition was ever valid, and it is certainly no longer applicable today. Funds flow freely around the country, and among banks of all sizes, to find the most profitable lending opportunities, using a wide variety of market mechanisms, including the federal funds market. The absence of interest on demand deposits is no bar to the movement of funds from depositories with surpluses—whatever their size or location—to the markets where the funding can be profitably employed. In fact, small firms in rural areas are able to bypass their local banks and invest in money market mutual funds with transaction capabilities. Indeed, smaller banks complain that they are unable to compete for the deposits of businesses precisely because of their inability to offer interest on demand deposits. The prohibition of interest on demand deposits distorts the pricing of transaction deposits and associated bank services. In order to compete for the liquid assets of businesses, banks set up complicated procedures to pay implicit interest on what are called compensating balance accounts. These accounts, which represent a sizable fraction of demand deposits, earn credits that can be used to pay for a firm's use of other bank services. Banks also spend resources—and charge fees—for sweeping the excess demand deposits of businesses into money market investments on a nightly basis. To be sure, the progress of computer technology has reduced the cost 327 of such systems over time. However, the expenses are not trivial, particularly when substantial efforts are needed to upgrade such automation systems or to integrate the diverse systems of merging banks. Such expenses waste the economy's resources—they would be unnecessary if interest were paid on both demand deposits and the reserve balances that must be held against them. The prohibition of interest on demand deposits also distorts the pricing of other bank products. Because banks cannot attract demand deposits through the payment of explicit interest, they often try to attract these deposits, aside from compensating balances, through the provision of services at little or no cost. When services are offered below cost, they tend to be overused—an additional waste of resources attributable partly to the prohibition of interest on demand deposits. However, the potential gains in economic efficiency cannot be fully realized by paying interest on demand deposits alone. As has been demonstrated in the case of the consumer checking accounts, on which interest is paid, the absence of interest on the reserve balances that must be held against such transaction deposits has in itself provided strong enough incentive for banks to start sweep programs. The costs that banks incur to design and maintain the automation systems needed to implement such sweep programs are another instance of economic waste. The payment of interest on required reserve balances could remove the incentives to engage in such reserve avoidance practices. In light of depositories' use of resources to try to circumvent reserve requirements, the reason for having such requirements might be questioned. Indeed, reserve requirements have been eliminated in a number of other industrialized countries. Let me review with you for a few moments the historical and current purposes served by reserve requirements. Although the English word \"reserves\" might imply an emergency store of liquidity, required reserves cannot actually be used for this purpose because they represent a small and fixed fraction of a bank's transaction deposits. Reserve requirements have at times been employed as a means of controlling the growth of money. In the early 1980s, for example, the Federal Reserve used a reserve quantity procedure to control the growth of M l . For the most part, however, the Federal Reserve has looked to the price of reserves—the federal funds rate—rather than the quantity of reserves, as its key focus in implementing monetary policy. Although reserve requirements no longer serve the primary purpose of monetary control, they continue 328 Federal Reserve Bulletin • May 1998 to play an important role in the implementation of monetary policy in the United States. They do so by helping to keep the federal funds rate close to the target rate set by the Federal Open Market Committee. They perform this function in two ways: First, they provide a predictable demand for the total reserves that the Federal Reserve needs to supply through open market operations in order to achieve a given federal funds rate target. Second, because required reserve balances must be maintained only on an average basis over a two-week period, depositories have some scope to adjust the daily balances they hold in a manner that helps stabilize the federal funds rate. For instance, if the funds rate were higher than usual on a particular day, depositories could choose to hold lower reserve balances, and their reduced demand would help to damp the upward pressure on the funds rate. Later in the two-week period, they could make up the shortfall in their average holdings of reserve balances. Depositories hold balances in their accounts at Federal Reserve Banks for reasons other than satisfying their two-week average requirements. Some balances are needed as a precaution against the chance that payment orders late in the day might leave a depository with an overdraft on its account, and the Federal Reserve strongly discourages overdrafts. On days when payment flows are particularly heavy and uncertain, or when the distribution of reserves is substantially displaced from normal, depositories tend to hold balances for precautionary purposes well above required levels. Unlike the two-week average demands, these daily precautionary demands cannot help smooth the funds rate from one day to the next. They are also difficult to predict, making it harder for the Federal Reserve to determine the appropriate daily quantity of reserves to supply to the market. In the absence of reserve requirements, or if reserve requirements were very low, the daily demand for balances at Reserve Banks would be dominated by these precautionary demands, and as a result, the federal funds rate could often diverge markedly from its intended level. An example of the volatility that can arise in the federal funds market because of a low level of required reserve balances occurred in early 1991. The Federal Reserve had reduced certain reserve requirements in late 1990 as a means of easing funding costs to banks during the credit crunch period. The cut in requirements reduced required balances at Reserve Banks for many depositories to below the balances needed for precautionary purposes, and the federal funds rate consequently became very volatile. On a typical day in that period, the funds rate strayed over a range of about 8 percentage points and missed the target for the average of daily rates by Vi percentage point. After a couple of months, stability returned to the federal funds market because depositories made improvements in their reserve management and because strong growth in deposits again boosted the level of required reserve balances above precautionary demands for many institutions. Since that time, depositories have become much more adept at managing their reserve positions, and their need for precautionary balances on a typical day has declined considerably. In fact, they are now managing to operate with lower aggregate required balances at Reserve Banks than they had in early 1991, and the federal funds rate is nevertheless much more stable. A number of measures taken by the Federal Reserve have helped to foster stability, including improvements in the timeliness of account information provided to depositories, more frequent open market operations geared to daily payment needs, and improved procedures for estimating reserve demand. Another measure now being considered by the Federal Reserve Board is a shift to lagged reserve requirements, which would also contribute to some reduction in uncertainty about reserve demand. The additional improvements in reserve management in recent years have been needed because required reserve balances have dropped substantially— from about $28 billion in late 1993 to about $9 billion in late 1997. This decline has not occurred because of further cuts in required reserve ratios by the Federal Reserve but because of the new retail sweep programs implemented by depositories. These programs use computerized systems to sweep consumer transaction deposits, which are subject to reserve requirements, into personal savings accounts, which are not. The spread of such retail sweep programs has not yet fully run its course, and considerable uncertainty shrouds its eventual outcome. We expect that the effects of future declines in required reserve balances on the volatility of the federal funds rate will not necessarily proceed gradually; the rather modest effects on volatility seen so far may not preclude a more outsized reaction as reserve balances fall even lower. Heightened volatility in the federal funds rate is of concern for a number of reasons. To be sure, the transmission of volatility in the funds rate to volatility in longer-term rates is likely to be muted because of the averaging out of upticks and downticks in the overnight rate. However, even in the absence of much transmission to longer-term rates, increased volatility in the federal funds rate would affect other overnight interest rates, raising funding risks for most large Statements to the Congress banks, securities dealers, and other money market participants. Suppliers of funds to the overnight markets, including many small banks and thrift institutions, would face greater uncertainty about the returns they would earn. Market participants concerned about unexpected losses would incur additional costs in managing their funding to limit the heightened risks. Countries that have eliminated reserve requirements do not generally experience a great deal of volatility in overnight interest rates because they are able to use alternative procedures for the implementation of monetary policy. One type of procedure, for instance, establishes a ceiling and a floor to contain movements of the overnight interest rate. The ceiling is set by a penalty interest rate on loans provided freely by the central bank through what is called a Lombard facility. The floor is established, in effect, by the payment of interest on excess reserves because no bank would lend to a private party at an interest rate below the rate it could earn on a risk-free deposit at the central bank. For the Federal Reserve to be able to set a similar interest rate floor, it would need authority to pay interest on excess reserves. As regards a ceiling on the funds rate, a change in the Federal Reserve's approach to the discount window would be necessary because we have no penalty interest rate and instead subject borrowing applications to an administrative review. Alternative means of establishing a ceiling could be considered. If interest were allowed to be paid on both demand deposits and required reserve balances, adjustments in the procedures for implementing monetary policy might not be needed. Such interest payments would likely boost the level of transaction deposits substantially, as some business and household sweep programs were unwound, and as banks became more able to compete for the liquid funds of businesses. The increased transaction deposits could ensure that required reserve balances would remain above the level of daily precautionary needs for many institutions, thus helping to stabilize the federal funds rate, while also improving economic efficiency as previously noted. The magnitude of the prospective responses to these measures is uncertain, however. Some corporations may not find the interest paid on demand deposits high enough to induce them to shift out of other liquid instruments. Also, some banks may retain consumer sweep programs in order to seek higher investment returns than the Federal Reserve would pay on reserve balances. If interest were allowed on required reserve balances, the Federal Reserve would likely pay a rate close to the rate available on an overnight repurchase agreement. Higher yields are, of course, 329 available on investments of greater risk and longer maturities. Because of the uncertainties involved, the Federal Reserve needs to be able to pay interest on excess reserves as well as on required reserve balances, and at differential rates to be set by the Federal Reserve. The ability to pay interest on excess reserves would provide an additional tool that could be used for monetary policy implementation, but one that might not need to be used, if interest on required reserve balances and demand deposits resulted in a sufficient boost to the level of those balances. Even if not used immediately, it is important that the Federal Reserve have the full range of tools available to other central banks, given the inventiveness of our financial markets and the need for the Federal Reserve to be prepared for potential developments that may not be immediately visible. The payment of interest on reserve balances would tend to reduce the revenues received by the Treasury from the Federal Reserve, while the payment of interest on demand deposits would increase those revenues. Treasury revenues would be directly reduced by the payment of interest on existing reserve balances. However, there would be some offset to this direct revenue loss. The level of reserve balances would rise because of the interest payments, and the Federal Reserve would therefore be able to increase its holdings of government securities. The Federal Reserve, on average, would earn a higher yield on those securities than the rate it would pay on required reserve balances. On net, Treasury revenues are still likely to fall with the payment of interest on required reserve balances, but the recent declines in such balances have reduced that revenue loss to a historic low, roughly $100 million anually starting next year, according to a recent estimate by the Congressional Budget Office. Similarly, interest payments on demand deposits would increase the level of demand deposits, as well as the reserve balances held against them on which the Federal Reserve would also earn a positive interest rate spread. The size of this further offset to the Treasury's revenue loss on required reserve balances is subject to considerable uncertainty. In the long run, the benefits of the proposed legislation will likely be distributed rather widely among bank customers. The biggest winners should be small businesses that currently earn no interest on their checking accounts. They will gain from the interest earned and from being able to relax procedures used to hold to a minimum the size of their checking account deposits. Larger firms will benefit as well, in part by saving on some sweep fees. 330 Federal Reserve Bulletin • May 1998 For banks, interest on demand deposits will increase costs, at least in the short run. Larger banks and securities firms may also lose some of the fees they currently earn on sweeps of business demand deposits. The higher costs to banks will be partially offset by interest on reserve balances, and over time, these measures should help the banking sector attract liquid funds in competition with nonbank institutions and direct market investments by businesses. Small banks, in particular, should be able to bid for business demand deposits on a more level playing field vis-a-vis both nonbank competition and large bank sweep programs. Moreover, large and small banks will be strengthened by fairer prices on the services they offer and by the elimination of unnecessary costs associated with sweeps and other procedures currently used to try to minimize the level of reserves. In the early 1980s, the Congress decided to deregulate interest rates on all household deposits and to allow money market deposit accounts for businesses. It is now time to extend the benefits of deposit interest rate deregulation to the ordinary checking accounts of businesses. Eliminating price distortions on demand deposits and on required and excess reserve balances would spare the economy wasteful expenditure, increase the efficiency of our financial markets, and facilitate the conduct of monetary policy. Statement by Alan Greenspan, Chairman, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, before the Committee on the Budget, U.S. House of Representatives, March 4, 1998 With the crisis curtailing the financing available in foreign currencies, many Asian economies have had no choice but to cut back their imports sharply from the United States and elsewhere, a situation made worse by disruptions to their financial systems and economies more generally. American exports should be held down further by the appreciation of the dollar, which will make the prices of competing goods produced abroad more attractive, just as foreign-produced goods will be relatively more attractive to buyers here at home. As a result, we can expect a worsening net export position to exert a discernible drag on total output in the United States and the dollar prices of our non-oil imports to extend their recent declines. These lower import prices are apparently already making domestic producers hesitant to raise their own prices for fear of losing market share, further contributing to the restraint on overall prices. The key question going forward is whether the restraint building from the turmoil in Asia will be sufficient to check inflationary tendencies that might otherwise result from continued strength of domestic spending and tightening labor markets. The depth of the adjustment abroad will depend on the extent of weakness in the financial sectors of Asian economies and the speed with which structural inefficiencies in the financial and nonfinancial sectors of those economies are corrected. If, as we suspect, the restraint coming from Asia is sufficient to bring the demand for American labor back into line with the growth of the working-age population desirous of working, labor markets will remain unusually tight, but any intensification of inflation should be delayed, very gradual, and readily reversible. However, we cannot rule out two other, more worrisome possibilities. On the one hand, should the momentum to domestic spending not be offset significantly by Asian or other Just last week I presented the Federal Reserve's semiannual report on economic conditions and the conduct of monetary policy. This morning, I will briefly review some aspects of that outlook before I turn to a more detailed discussion of coming budgetary challenges. The exemplary performance of the U.S. economy in 1997 will be hard to match. Last year's combination of robust expansion of activity, healthy creation of new jobs, and a decline in inflation generated widespread benefits for our citizens. Many of those benefits have the promise to be long-lived: Our nation has been experiencing a higher growth rate of productivity—output per hour worked—in recent years, which is the ultimate source of rising standards of living. There can be no doubt that domestic demand retained some of its considerable momentum going into this year. Production and employment have been on a strong uptrend in recent months. Confident households, enjoying gains in income and wealth and benefiting from the reductions in intermediate- and longer-term interest rates to date, should continue to increase their spending. Firms should find financing available on relatively attractive terms to fund profitable opportunities to enhance efficiency by investing in new capital equipment. By itself, this strength in spending would seem to presage intensifying pressures in labor markets and on prices. Yet, the outlook for total spending on goods and services produced in the United States is less assured of late because of storm clouds massing over the Western Pacific and heading our way. Statements to the Congress developments, the U.S. economy would be on a track along which spending could press too strongly against available resources to be consistent with contained inflation. On the other, we also need to be alert to the possibility that the forces from Asia might damp activity and prices by more than is desirable by exerting a particularly forceful drag on the volume of net exports and the prices of imports. The robust economy has facilitated the efforts of the Congress and the Administration to restore balance in the unified federal budget. The deficit dropped to its lowest level in more than two decades in fiscal 1997, and both the Administration and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) now expect the budget to remain essentially in balance over the next few years before moving to moderate surpluses by the middle of the next decade. I should caution, though, that while receipt growth remained robust through January, the prospects for fiscal 1998 as a whole remain uncertain until we have a tally of the final payments that will be included in April's tax returns. As I have indicated to the Congress on numerous occasions, putting the unified budget into significant surplus would be the surest and most direct way of increasing national saving. In turn, higher national saving, by promoting lower real long-term interest rates, helps spur spending to outfit American firms and their workers with the modern equipment they need to compete successfully on world markets. We have seen a partial down payment of the benefits of better budget balance already: It seems reasonable to assume that the decline in longer-term Treasury yields last year owed, in part, to reduced competition—current and prospective—from the federal government for scarce private saving. But much hard work remains to be done to ensure that these projected surpluses actually materialize and that the appropriate budgetary strategy is in place to deal with the effects on federal entitlement spending of the looming shift in the nation's retirement demographics. The baseline projections from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the CBO provide a good starting point for assessing the budget outlook over the medium term: They are based on sensible economic and technical assumptions and thus offer a reasonable indication of how the budget is likely to evolve if economic conditions remain favorable and current budgetary policies remain in place. However, the experience of the past few years amply demonstrates that such forecasts are subject to considerable error. For evidence on that score, we need only look back to last winter. Even with fiscal 1997 already well under way, both the 331 CBO and the OMB were overestimating that year's deficit by about $100 billion. In retrospect, much of the error in last winter's deficit estimates fell on the inflow side, largely reflecting a surge in tax receipts that far exceeded estimates. This \"tax surprise\", which helped lift the receipts share of gross domestic product to a historical high, was not a new phenomenon. In the early 1990s, growth of receipts consistently fell short of expectations based on the trends in aggregate income and the tax laws then in place. Even after the fact, our knowledge about the sources of such surprises has not always been definitive. As a result, we must remain cautious about extrapolating recent favorable tax inflows into the future. We cannot rule out the possibility that the next few years will see a more rapid dissipation of the strength in receipts than either the OMB and the CBO have assumed, implying renewed deficits. Indeed, all else equal, had the 1997 surprise fallen on the other side—downward instead of upward—we would be confronted by nontrivial budget deficits at least through the beginning of the coming decade. Moreover, the baseline projections assume that discretionary spending will be held to the statutory caps, which allow almost no growth in nominal outlays through fiscal 2002. Given the declining support for further reductions in defense spending, keeping overall discretionary spending within the caps is likely to require sizable, as yet unspecified, real declines in nondefense programs from current levels. Not surprisingly, many observers are skeptical that the caps will hold, and battles over appropriations in coming years may well expose deep divisions that could make the realization of the budget projections less likely. In addition, although last year's legislation cut Medicare spending substantially, experience has highlighted the difficulty of controlling this program, raising the possibility that the savings will not be so great as anticipated—especially if resistance develops among beneficiaries or providers. These uncertainties underscore the need for caution as you move ahead on your work on the 1999 budget. There is no guarantee that projected surpluses over the next few years will actually materialize. However, we can be more certain that, absent action, the budgetary position will erode after the next decade as the baby boom generation moves into retirement, putting massive strains on the social security and Medicare programs. Without question, the task of stemming that erosion will become increasingly difficult the longer it is postponed. Indeed, especially in light of these inexorable demographic trends, I have always emphasized that we should 332 Federal Reserve Bulletin • May 1998 be aiming for budgetary surpluses and using the proceeds to retire outstanding federal debt. In that regard, one measure of how much progress has been made in dealing with the nation's fiscal affairs is that serious discussion of such paydowns has begun to surface. Working down the stock of the federal debt would put further downward pressure on long-term interest rates, which would enhance private capital investment, labor productivity, and economic growth, preparing us to better confront the looming changes in retirement demographics. Over the decades, our budgetary processes have been biased toward deficit spending. Indeed, those processes are strewn with initiatives that were viewed as having only a small projected budgetary cost at inception but which produced a sizable drain on the Treasury's coffers over time. As you are well aware, programs can be easy to initiate or expand but extraordinarily difficult to trim or shut down once a constituency develops that has a stake in maintaining them. Thus far, the President and the Congress have been quite successful, contrary to expectations, in placing, and especially holding, caps on discretionary spending. More recently, they have started to confront the budget implications of the surge in retirements that will occur early in the next century. But the good news of late on the budget has unleashed an outpour- ing of proposals that, if adopted, do not bode well for the maintenance of fiscal discipline. Although many of the individual budget proposals may have merit, they must be considered only in the context of a responsible budget strategy for the longer run. In closing, I want to commend Chairman Kasich and the members of the committee for your insistence on fiscal responsibility and persistent efforts to bring the budget under control. The shrinking budget deficit and the prospect of surplus stand as testimony to your endeavors. But we must remember that projections of surpluses are based on an extrapolation of steady economic growth and subdued inflation in coming years. Achieving such a performance in these uncertain times, with the U.S. economy now subject to a fine balance of powerful forces of expansion and restraint,"
