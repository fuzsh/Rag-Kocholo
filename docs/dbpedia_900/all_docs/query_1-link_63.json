This is the City of Tracy’s largest and most complex project.\n\nThe City of Tracy proposes to replace the existing 1441 foot long 11th Street Bridge over the Union Pacific Railroad tracks with a shorter single span structure consisting of approach embankments with MSE Walls. Anticipated work generally consists of replacement of the existing bridge, modifying the signalized intersection of North MacArthur Drive and 11th Street and relocating existing utilities. The proposed alternative involves constructing a temporary on-site detour with a prefabricated steel truss bridge on the south side of 11th Street during demolition of the existing and construction of the new bridge.\n\nProposed new bridge will accommodate two 12 foot lanes in each direction, one four foot wide median, 8 foot shoulders/Class II bike lanes and 8 foot wide separated sidewalks on each side of the structure that are protected with traffic side barriers"
