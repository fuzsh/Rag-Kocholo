        "text": "The Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) is planning to rebuild nearly two miles of southbound U.S. 27 and nearly one mile of eastbound U.S. 40 in the city of Richmond.\n\nINDOT has awarded a $23.9 million construction contract to Gradex, Inc. Construction began in March 2017 and is expected to be complete by May 2019.\n\nIn addition to rebuilding the roadways, the project will also include:\n\nNew water mains\n\nNew drainage and modernized storm sewer\n\nNew ADA curb ramps and sidewalks\n\nNew traffic signals with wireless interconnectivity\n\nNew traffic signs\n\nClick for larger image\n\nU.S. 27 Construction\n\nSouthbound U.S. 27 (8th Street) construction will span from the Whitewater River bridge, where a previous construction project on Chester Boulevard ended, south to the O Street overpass, where each direction of U.S. 27 splits, on the south side of Richmond.\n\nClick for Larger Image\n\nU.S. 27 Phase 1 – Finishes Fall 2017\n\nThe first phase of construction will include:\n\nstraightening the alignment of southbound U.S. 27 near the intersection of North C Street,\n\nrebuilding State Road 121/North J Street approaching U.S. 27, and\n\nrebuilding both directions of U.S. 27 between North B Street and the Whitewater River, excluding the bridge over the railroad.\n\nWork will reduce U.S. 27 to one lane in each direction between North B Street and the Whitewater River bridge. Multiple traffic shifts will be required to maintain one lane in each direction and rebuild the roadway one side at a time. Access to and from intersecting streets will be temporarily closed while that side of the roadway is being rebuilt.\n\nClick for Larger Image\n\nU.S. 27 Phase 2 – Begins May 9, Finishes Summer 2018\n\nThe second phase of construction will include rebuilding the west half of southbound U.S. 27 between North C Street and the South O Street overpass. Traffic will be reduced to one lane and shifted to the east side of the road. A section between South C and F streets will temporarily remain shifted to the west side of the road.\n\nMultiple traffic lane shifts will be required to maintain one open lane and rebuild the roadway one side at a time. Access to and from intersecting streets will be temporarily closed while that side of the roadway is being rebuilt.\n\nWeather permitting, contractors intend to finish one half of the southbound U.S. 27 rebuild this year. Once complete, one lane of traffic will be shifted to the west side of the road and the eastern half will be finished in 2018.\n\nU.S. 40 Construction\n\nEastbound U.S. 40 (South A Street and 11th Street) construction will span from the Whitewater River gorge bridge east to 11th Street, and will include 11th Street from South A Street north to Main Street.\n\nClick for Larger Image\n\nEastbound U.S. 40 – Begins Early 2018, Finishes Before End of 2018\n\nEastbound U.S. 40 (South A Street and 11th Street) construction is scheduled to begin in 2018. The rebuild will span from the Lamar Lundy Memorial Bridge over the Whitewater River gorge to 11th Street and will include 11th Street from South A Street to Main Street.\n\nSouth A Street will remain open during construction, and 11th Street will be closed for up to 45 days. U.S. 40 traffic will be detoured to 16th Street during the closure of 11th Street.\n\nMaintaining Traffic\n\nClick for larger image\n\nSouthbound U.S. 27 (8th Street) will be rebuilt one-half at a time. One lane of traffic will be shifted to one side of the road while the other side is closed for construction. While some side street access will be closed, U.S. 27 will remain open during construction.\n\nEastbound U.S. 40 (South A Street) will also be rebuilt one-half at a time. One lane of traffic will be shifted to one side of the road while the other side is closed for construction. Some side street access will be closed, but South A Street will remain open during construction.\n\n11th Street will be closed for up to 45 days during construction. Traffic will be detoured to 16th Street during this short-term closure.\n\nClick for larger image\n\nPavement Innovation\n\nU.S. 40 between 3rd Street and 11th Street will be rebuilt using precast concrete panels. This construction method is being used in several other states, and this project will be the first to use precast concrete panel pavement in Indiana.\n\nBy using precast panels, INDOT intends to reduce the pavement depth and potential conflicts with existing underground utilities. These panels are removable and replaceable, so any future maintenance required on the undergound utilities should not damage the pavement. In addition, using precast panels will reduce the time needed for construction, minimize future roadway maintenance needs and extend the pavement life expectancy.\n\nLatest News\n\nTraffic Patterns Shifting Friday in Richmond For US 27 South (8th St.) Construction\n\nUS 27 South (8th St.) in Richmond Shifts for Construction Between North A and South E Streets After Labor Day\n\nPhase 2 of U.S. 27 Construction in Richmond Begins Next Week\n\nStay Informed\n\nSubscribe to Gov Delivery to receive email and/or text alerts from INDOT\n\nFollow INDOT East Central on Facebook and Twitter\n\nContact Information"
