        "text": "The 11th Street bridge has been closed to vehicles for eight years, even as the companion span for pedestrians just to the north has remained open.\n\nDeteriorated vehicle span over RR tracks demolished soon\n\nCOVINGTON, Ky. – Work to build a new pedestrian bridge over the CSX railroad tracks at 11th Street will begin this month, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet announced today.\n\nBut before the bridge can be built, contractors must first demolish the existing pedestrian span as well as its companion bridge for vehicles, which has been closed since 2013 because of rust and crumbling concrete.\n\nThe expected start date for the state project is March 15, the Cabinet said.\n\nThe new, 12-foot-wide pedestrian bridge will be constructed in the same space as the existing one and “will provide a safer connection for neighborhoods,” the state’s media release said.\n\nCity Manager David Johnston said span was a critical connection for pedestrians.\n\n“The City continues to work with many groups and agencies to improve walkability within our community,” Johnston said. “This important project ensures pedestrian access from Covington’s Westside and Old Seminary Square neighborhoods to Cathedral Square.”\n\nThe $777,000 project was awarded to Louisville Paving and Construction. According to information provided to the City, its project manager said the goal was to remove the sidewalk and its piers in the first week and demolish the larger span during April.\n\nThe project has an Aug. 15, 2021, completion date.\n\nThe 91-foot-long vehicular bridge was built in 1927 by Fort Pitt Bridge Works.\n\nIt was shut down on Feb. 1, 2013, after inspectors deemed it unsafe for heavy loads because deterioration and structural deficiencies. (The pedestrian bridge just to the north has remained open.)\n\nAfter looking at several replacement scenarios, the state decided to rebuild only the pedestrian bridge. The Covington Board of Commissioners in 2015 passed an order approving that plan.\n\n# # #"
