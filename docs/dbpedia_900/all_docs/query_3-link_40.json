        "text": "Updated August 23, 2024\n\nProject Design\n\nThis project aims to keep people and goods moving and includes enhancements to make the RapidRide D bus line more reliable and to make travel safer for everyone. (Click map to enlarge.)\n\nProject Elements\n\nBelow we have outlined the different aspects of this project. You can also review the full project designs here.\n\nPaving, Bridge Maintenance, & Seismic Retrofit\n\nPave 15th Ave W/NW from W Emerson St to NW 57th St including the fixed portions of the Ballard Bridge.\n\nImprove earthquake safety by strengthening the north end of the Ballard Bridge (also called the Leary Way Bridge).This includes strengthening the bridge's cap beams, columns, footings, and abutments (parts of the bridge structure), installing ground anchors, repairing cracks and damaged concrete, and replacing worn out bridge expansion joints.\n\nRapidRide D Bus Line Reliability\n\nAdd red “bus only” lane markings to the existing northbound bus lane on 15th Ave NW between NW 51st St and NW Market St\n\nAdd a new southbound transit lane with red “bus only” markings on 15th Ave NW between NW 54th St and NW Market St.\n\nAdd a new southbound transit lane with red “bus only” markings on 15th Ave NW between Leary Way NW and NW Ballard Way.\n\nSafety & Accessibility Enhancements\n\nInstall a new bike and pedestrian signal and crosswalk at NW 51st St, making it easier to walk, roll, or bike around the neighborhood and connecting people to Ballard businesses, attractions, and transit.\n\nReplace a southbound lane on 15th Ave NW with a new landscaped median between NW 50th St and NW 54th St to calm driver speeds and reduce the likelihood of serious crashes.\n\nUpgrade curb ramps to meet current ADA standards along 15th Ave NW.\n\nBuild missing curb ramps at all east-west crossings along 15th Ave NW.\n\nUpdate pedestrian crosswalk signs and refresh striping for better visibility.\n\nGeneral Improvements\n\nRepair sidewalks, driveways, and stormwater drainage areas.\n\nPlant new trees and replace old trees in select areas.\n\nInstall new or expand existing tree pits to keep trees healthy.\n\nImprove and add new lighting under the bridge along Leary Way NW and on the pedestrian path near the intersection of 15th Ave NW and W Nickerson St.\n\nSafety Enhancements North of the Ballard Bridge\n\nThis diagram illustrates the enhancements along 15th Ave NW from NW Market St to NW 50th St (click map to enlarge). For additional details, scroll down to see the project renderings.\n\nProject Renderings\n\nNW 51st St and 15th Ave NW: New crosswalks with protective median and signal, improving access to buses and connecting the neighborhood (click image to enlarge).\n\nNW 53rd St and 15th Ave NW: Maintain signalized crossing and add landscaped median from NW 54 to NW 51st St (click image to enlarge).\n\n15th Ave NW: New southbound bus-only lane between NW 54th St and NW Market St (click image to enlarge).\n\nRendering of the improved street at 15th Ave NW and NW 51st St upon project completion showing new signalized pedestrian crossing on NW 51st and NW Market St connecting east and west Ballard. Graphic: SDOT\n\nProject Background\n\n15th Ave W/NW is a major roadway serving northwest Seattle. The corridor connects Ballard, Interbay, North Queen Anne, and Magnolia and is a major transit street, serving King County Metro routes 15,17, 18, 40, 44, and the D-line. This section of 15th Ave W/NW includes the Ballard Bridge and provides access to commercial businesses, grocery stores, and residences.\n\nAs part of the Levy to Move Seattle AAC (Arterial and Asphalt and Concrete) Paving Program, the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) is paving 15th Ave W/NW and the Ballard Bridge Deck between W Emerson St to NW 57th St. The project will restore the road condition of a critical piece of Seattle’s transportation network and contribute to SDOT’s Levy commitment to pave up to 180 lane-miles of arterial streets by 2024.\n\nIt will extend the useful life of one of Seattle's busiest streets and bridges and contribute to a safer and more comfortable travel experience for all road users. As part of Seattle’s freight route, this will also be a major investment in the freight network and serve large trucks, the maritime industrial business, port facilities, and key business needs on this side of town.\n\nAerial Diagram of the project area which covers NW 15th from NW 57th to W Emerson.

Our team gave presentations and answered questions at local community events, tabled at neighborhood grocery stores, sent emails, made phone calls, visited businesses and other key stakeholders in the project area, collected responses in a community survey, and sent general email updates to the project listserv.\n\nIn total, we received 900+ responses to our community survey and additional feedback from 40 community members who emailed our project inbox. Most of the people (28) who emailed us requested safety improvements for community members who walk and bike. This input informed the final project design.\n\nSchedule\n\nPlanning (Summer 2021 - Spring 2022): We collected traffic data, reviewed plans, and gathered community experiences to define options.\n\nDesign (Summer 2022 - Summer 2023): We conducted community outreach, collected feedback, worked to secure regulatory approval (e.g., Environmental Assessment), and developed increasingly detailed designs that reflected what we heard and learned.\n\nConstruction (Summer 2024 - 2025): We will construct the project and keep the community informed on the latest construction updates, schedule, and expected impacts.\n\nPlease note that schedules are always subject to change due to supply availability and inclement weather.\n\nWhat to expect during construction\n\nIn general, here’s what you can expect:\n\nWe will close some lanes and streets temporarily for drivers.\n\nWe will have temporary detours for vehicles and buses.\n\nWe will close and detour some sidewalks and crossings temporarily for people walking and rolling.\n\nWe will relocate some bus stops temporarily.\n\nWe will change on-street parking temporarily.\n\nYou will hear noise, see dust, and feel vibrations during work hours.\n\nWe will have construction staging and parking impacts near work sites.\n\nBallard Bridge closures to southbound traffic 10 PM - 8 AM\n\nTo pave and do maintenance work on the bridge, we will need to close it to traffic at the following times:\n\nSouthbound driving lanes will be closed Mondays – Thursdays from 10 PM – 8 AM starting as soon as July 8 for 6 – 8 weeks\n\nWe will also need to reduce the bridge to one driving lane in each direction starting at 7 PM on Mondays – Thursdays this summer and in early fall.\n\nBallard Bridge full weekend closures (September/October 2024)\n\nWe also need to fully close the Ballard Bridge on select weekends in the early fall for maintenance to keep the 107-year-old bridge safe and strong.\n\nPotential weekend closure dates (to be confirmed and may change):\n\nFriday evening, September 6, 2024, through Monday morning, September 9, 2024\n\nFriday evening, September 13, 2024, through Monday morning, September 16, 2024\n\nFriday evening, September 27, 2024, through Monday morning, September 30, 2024\n\nFriday evening, October 4, 2024, through Monday morning, October 7, 2024\n\nFriday evening, October 11, 2024, through Monday morning, October 14, 2024\n\nWe know these closures can be inconvenient. We’ll do our best to keep the bridge open for people walking, rolling, and biking unless it’s unsafe.\n\nNearby Projects\n\nWe will be coordinating with nearby capital projects in the neighborhood.

It is an important investment to maintain and modernize this busy area that connects vibrant neighborhoods and business districts on both sides of the Ship Canal.\n\nThe Leary Way Bridge seismic retrofit project also includes funding from a federal grant. We thank our federal partners for their support, including the Biden Administration, Senator Patty Murray, Senator Maria Cantwell, and Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal.\n\nThank you for your time and interest in this project as we move forward with construction.\n\nContact Us\n\nIf you would like to contact our project team or schedule a meeting for you or your organization please email us at 15thAveW_NWpaving@Seattle.gov or give us a call at: (206) 512-3950.\n\nQ&A"
