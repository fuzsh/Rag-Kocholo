        "text": "Montgomery County Bridge #163, which carries Lutheran Road over the Minister Creek in New Hanover, was originally constructed in 1923 as a single lane, two-span, continuous concrete slab bridge spanning 38 feet. An August 2016 inspection of the bridge resulted in an overall poor rating and the bridge was listed as structurally deficient and in need of replacement. The Engineering design contract was awarded to Bergmann Associates of Conshohocken, PA. As of August 2019, the bridge was inspected again and reported to be in need of high priority maintenance items per the PennDOT Bridge Safety Inspection Manual. The bridge inspections were subsequently scheduled at shorter time intervals. In April of 2020, the Engineering design, permitting, and environmental studies were completed and ready to be advertised for construction bids.\n\nThe new bridge was designed to be a precast concrete box culvert with a clear span of 30 feet. The Construction contract was awarded to Richard E. Pierson Construction of Malvern, PA with a start date of April 28, 2022. The project was scheduled to be completed within 182 calendar days and reopened to traffic by October 27, 2022. With oversight by Michael Baker International of Fort Washington, PA providing Construction Inspection and Quality Control services, the bridge was completed and opened to traffic on August 20, 2022, which was 68 calendar days ahead of schedule and just in time for school openings and subsequent bus traffic.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMontgomery County is the owner of 131 Bridges, 191 Culverts and over 190 Lane Miles of Roadways. Bridge 6 construction represents another milestone towards eliminating poor condition bridges. Since 2019, commissioner objectives focus on reducing the number of poor condition bridges from 61 down to 20 at a cost of over 100 million dollars. Commissioner goals are to improve Montgomery County Transportation network and keep the traveling public safe. Bridge 6 is part of this critical infrastructure. Bridge 6 links Montgomery Ave and Old Gulph Rd, carrying Lower Merion’s Mill Creek Rd over Mill Creek. Over 3.6 Million Vehicles per year cross the bridge and use Mill Creek Road connector.\n\nBackground\n\nThe structure was originally built in 1956 and remained in good condition for 70 years until 2018 when PennDOT determined the bridge’s deck, superstructure, and substructure were in poor condition. The bridge was weight restricted limiting access to only lower weight vehicles. In 2018, Commissioners committed ~ 3.0 Million from County Motor Vehicle Registration (“MVR”) funds to design, permit and build a new bridge in accordance with PennDOT’ s current standards. Montgomery County and Lower Merion Township overcame several significant obstacles designing and building this critical infrastructure.\n\nEngineering design work started in 2019 and by year end engineering design and permitting was 30 % complete. However, in March, 2020, Covid-19 pandemic caused mass hysteria when the first recorded death from the virus was confirmed in Pennsylvania. Engineering and PennDOT coordination was slowed as work restrictions were imposed by State and County government. Bridge 6 remained open during this period until September 3, 2021 when Hurricane IDA flood waters caused undermining of the foundation and possible bridge collapse. Following bridge closure, Engineer design work was escalated to include new and stronger structure that could withstand flash floods and storm surge.\n\nOvercoming Construction Obstacles\n\nIn March 2023, R.E. Pierson began 510 days of construction work to replace Bridge 6. Today, we have a new single span pre-stressed concrete spread box beam bridge that will services Lower Merion for the next 75 years. The proposed bridge not only carries traffic but carries multiple utility companies infrastructure that provide power, gas, water, communications and sewer services to the local community. This was extremely important as construction crews were challenged with completing the construction in two phases to minimize utility outrages. The Township assistance with their sewer line was critical since this sanitary service could not be interrupted without sewage backups or discharge to the steam. This work was done without incident and in accordance with PADEP permits.\n\nMost of the bridge work cannot be seen from the bridge deck. For example, several months were needed to demolish and install foundations below stream level. At times, passersby felt that little or no progress was being made since work was being done below ground. For example, several foundations are installed at depths reaching 16 feet below and alongside the flowing creek. This required special construction procedures including continuous dewatering 24/7 for several months.\n\nTight work quarters, residential traffic control and weather presented other unique challenges that the team overcame to finish the project in April, 2024. It is noteworthy that a minimal amount of rainfall in the area creates flash floods. We endured several flash floods and several floods that inundated the work area.\n\nBeautification\n\nMontgomery County and Lower Merion Township worked together to provide additions to the bridge, which will make it more visually appealing and safer for the travelling public. A stamped stone pattern was added, which will be stained/painted to mimic the original dry-stacked stone walls in the area. Additionally, Township Public Works Department assisted with site clean-up, resetting of granite curb along Township owned Mill Creek road, and placed additional storm water inlets to maximize Mill Creek Road drainage.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nAmong the many contributors to the project, a special “thank you” to the following for working extended hours and weekends to help open County Bridge 6 to traffic on April 30, 2024:\n\nThomas F. O’Brien – Montgomery County Assets and Infrastructure – Roads & Bridges Administrator Brian Bonsall - Montgomery County Assets and Infrastructure - Roads & Bridges Project Manager\n\nRichard E. Pierson Construction – Construction Contractor\n\nMcMahon, A Bowman Company – Construction Inspection\n\nJohnson, Mirmiran & Thompson – Design Engineer\n\nMcCormick-Taylor – Engineering Consultation\n\nLower Merion Township Manager & Public Works Department\n\nLower Merion Residents\n\nThe Montgomery County Commissioners reopened Sterigere Street Bridge (Bridge 177) in Norristown on November 28, 2023. The bridge, which carries Sterigere Street over Stony Creek in Norristown, primarily serves as a connection for both vehicles and pedestrians between North Whitehall Road and Swede Road. The area is a major artery for the community, carrying approximately 18,000 vehicles per day.\n\n“Montgomery County has made investing in our infrastructure a priority. Better infrastructure improves quality of life, reduces transportation costs, and makes the region more attractive for investment and economic growth,” said Kenneth E. Lawrence Jr., Chair of the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners. “When I joined the Board of Commissioners in 2017, we committed to rehabbing and maintaining our 131 county-owned bridges. In 2012, 62 of our bridges were structurally deficient. We’ve made tremendous progress on this goal with the help of the $5 vehicle registration fee. Since 2016, we have rehabbed over forty bridges in the County—such as this one here on Sterigere Street.”\n\nThe Sterigere Street Bridge, which was originally built in 1923, required a major overhaul in order to make it safe and effective for the community after decades of deterioration. In 2022, Montgomery County Commissioners approved the $3.6 million bridge replacement, appropriated from $5 vehicle registration revenue. The final cost was $3.4 million.\n\nCommissioners Lawrence and Winder were joined by PA State Senator Amanda Capelletti, 17th District, and PA State Representative Greg Scott, 54th District, as well as officials from the Norristown Town Council including President Tom Lepera and Vice President Heather Lewis.\n\nThe elected officials cut the ribbon to open the bridge to vehicular traffic, which then proceeded to cross the bridge with celebratory honks. Norristown community members and representatives from neighboring businesses, including Elmwood Park Zoo and Von C Brewing, were also in attendance to celebrate the new opening.\n\nThe bridge was designed by Rummel, Klepper & Kahl, LLP (RK&K) of King of Prussia, PA. The construction contract was awarded to H&K Group of Skippack, PA, with oversight and inspection services provided by McMahon Associates of Fort Washington, PA.\n\nThe construction was planned to be completed within a period of 25 months, by May 2024. However, based on coordinated work and with Norristown Municipality and PennDOT assistance, construction was reduced to a single stage to provide a higher quality product, keep utility disturbance to a minimum, and finish the project in less than 16 months.\n\nThe new bridge is an improved two-span 110-foot-long, pre-stressed concrete bulb T-beam structure with two lanes of traffic and sidewalks on both sides. The bridge design improves traffic and pedestrian travel and accommodates more stream flow. Additionally, original character-defining features, like the architectural stone façade on the barrier walls, pier, and abutments, were incorporated to maintain the historical profile.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Commissioner Lawrence also took a moment to acknowledge all those who have public works jobs. “These workers have jobs that can be dangerous and risky, yet without their willingness to serve their community. We wouldn’t be able to enjoy the structures like the Sterigere Street Bridge and other public works projects around the County,” said Lawrence.\n\nOur Bridge 162, which carries Stump Road over the Little Neshaminy Creek in Montgomery Township, was originally constructed in 1916 as a 28-feet long, single-span, concrete-encased Steel I-beam bridge. This two-lane bridge was widened in 1980 with reinforced concrete slabs. As of 2018, the bridge was inspected and found to be in an overall poor condition and designated as needing replacement. The Engineering Design contract was awarded to Larson Design Group, Inc. of Williamsport, PA, which began the arduous task of securing permitting and legal right-of-way, performing surveying and geological testing, conducting environmental studies, and reviewing roadway design alternatives among many other details.\n\nThe final Engineering Design was completed in October 2021. The new bridge was designed to be a single-span, pre-stressed concrete box beam structure supported on integral abutments. The structure was designed for two lanes of traffic with a full shoulder on the northbound lane and full width pedestrian sidewalk on the southbound lane. The Construction contract was awarded to R.E. Pierson of Pilesgrove, NJ with a start date of January 18, 2022 for utility relocation work. The bridge construction work started on April 28, 2022 with a scheduled completion date of November 27, 2022. With oversight by McTish, Kunkel & Associates of Allentown, PA providing Construction Inspection and Quality Control services, the bridge was completed and opened to traffic on November 23, 2022, just in time for the Thanksgiving Holiday weekend.\n\nThe Old Neiffer Road Bridge in Schwenksville, also known as the Sunrise Mill Bridge, has recently been completely rehabilitated after years of deterioration and severe damage from the post-Hurricane Ida floodwaters. Originally constructed in 1845, the bridge is part of the historic Sunrise Mill complex, which contains buildings dating to 1767. The bridge is a four-arch, stone masonry structure, which carried Old Neiffer Road over the Swamp Creek, and was last rehabilitated in 1967. The bridge was closed to traffic when the Neiffer Road Bridge was constructed by PennDOT further downstream. The Old Neiffer Road Bridge will now become a trail connector from the complex to the future Swamp Creek Trail.\n\nThe Sunrise Mill Bridge rehabilitation Engineering contract was awarded to Gannett-Fleming of Audubon, PA. The project was in the design phase in 2020 and was scheduled for construction in the summer of 2021. However, the remnants of Hurricane Ida dropped upwards of 8 inches of rain in Montgomery County in a 24-hour period on September 2, 2021. The Swamp Creek, swollen beyond capacity due to the storm surge, reached a level that overtopped the bridge. The surging floodwaters caused significant damage to the structure including a collapse of the downstream barrier wall and arch ring, bulging of the abutment wingwall, and significant loss of stones across the entire bridge.\n\nThe construction work began in January, 2022. The project was awarded to Loftus Construction of Cinnaminson, NJ with oversight and inspection services provided by McTish, Kunkel and Associates of Allentown, PA. The process of rehabilitating a stone arch masonry bridge requires the placement of arch centering, or shoring, equipment, and the dismantling and reconstruction of the bridge elements. During this work, the area was hit with another significant rain event on April 8, 2022. Once again, the Swamp Creek was elevated to a near 10-year flood level. The storm surge, coupled with upstream debris from the winter months, caused a damming effect at the construction site, which eventually gave way and damaged the structure further.\n\nDespite this significant setback of additional damage and lost equipment, the construction resumed almost immediately. The structure was in danger of suffering an arch collapse, but the construction team worked quickly to repair the pier damage and strengthen the arches over the next few weeks.\n\nBy July 2022, the bridge was beginning to resemble its original look. The arches had been rebuilt and the stonework on the spandrel walls was nearing completion. Through the good fortune of consecutive dry months, the construction continued uninterrupted. The arch centering supports were removed and the construction focus was on the barrier walls and bridge deck surface. Stone masonry work and repointing continued throughout the project until Loftus Construction successfully completed the rehabilitation of the Sunrise Mill Bridge on September 8, 2022. The following photo shows the finished product from the downstream view. Many thanks go out to the team that brought this beautiful structure back to its former glory, including: the Loftus Construction team, McTish-Kunkel & Associates, Gannett-Fleming and many representatives of Montgomery County that made it possible."
