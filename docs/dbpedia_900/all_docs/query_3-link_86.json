        "text": "MOORHEAD — For years, Moorhead resident Marilyn Gorman has been tirelessly avoiding the railroads in her city, trekking around them as she is able.\n\nPassing over railroad tracks once caused her fresh stitches from surgery to split, she said, spurring her avoidance of the bumpy tracks.\n\n“After that, whenever I saw a train I went a different direction to get around,” Gorman told The Forum on Tuesday, Oct. 17.\n\nNow, the Minnesota Department of Transportation and the city of Moorhead are preparing to kick off construction in 2024 on a set of underpasses along 11th Street North with railroad bridges crossing the soon-to-be lowered roadway between Main Avenue and Center Avenue and between Center Avenue and First Avenue North.\n\nPlans for the underpass are complete, according to Justin Knopf, project manager with MnDOT, and the team is in the process of selecting a contractor to begin construction in spring of 2024. The multi-year project is anticipated to wrap up in fall of 2026, he said.\n\nThe construction bidding process is set for January, with preliminary project costs at over $100 million, according to MnDOT.\n\nGorman attended an open house Tuesday at the Hjemkomst Center to learn how the project would impact her. Her home of 55 years is just one block north of the planned construction, she said.\n\nWhile happy to learn that the vibrations from construction won't be a problem, she expects lengthy detours when the project starts, she said.\n\nThe project will close portions of 11th Street, First Avenue North, Center Avenue and Main Avenue in phases over the next two years,\n\nThroughout the city, drivers experience roughly five cumulative hours of traffic disruption daily while 70+ trains travel through Moorhead each day, blocking up traffic. The traffic disruption is likely to grow to seven hours per day by 2045 as the rate of trains running through the city increases to 90 per day, according to MnDOT.\n\nOnce completed, the underpass project will bring a host of benefits to Moorhead residents, according to Knopf, including added pedestrian safety and a dependable route for drivers without train delays.\n\n“Bear with us and try to see the safety and mobility it (the underpass) will bring well into the future,” Knopf said.\n\nKnopf said he hopes Tuesday's event helps spread awareness about the project to Moorhead residents and helps them understand the schedule.\n\n“I’m so excited,” Moorhead resident Candace Allen told The Forum, adding that the Main Avenue underpass completed last year has been very helpful for drivers.\n\nThe $26 million in federal funding the city obtained to help pay for the 11th Street underpass is something to celebrate, she said.\n\nShe’s in the process of teaching her 15-year-old granddaughter to drive and always points out where the new underpass is going to be whenever they travel along 11th Street, she said.\n\n“It’s going to be a long time (until it’s done),” Allen laughed. “I hope I live long enough to see it.”\n\nThe city of Moorhead experienced lengthy delays in constructing the Main Avenue underpass, something transportation officials are taking care to avoid this time round. The underpass took nearly four years to complete.\n\nThe Department of Transportation took a \"unique\" step bringing Ames Construction Co., the lead Main Avenue underpass contractor, to the design table for the 11th Street underpass, Knopf said. The goal is to learn from the last project and avoid similar delays going forward, he added.\n\nGeotechnical drilling for the new project was done to ensure construction crews know what lurks beneath the ground, he said. Drilling will also allow crews to build necessary components in the correct spot without hitting setbacks.\n\nEnvironmental and historical considerations have also been factored into the schedule, Knopf said.\n\nRemnants of old gas stations and refineries could be found, he said, creating a host of contaminated materials that will need to be properly disposed of.\n\nDowntown is ripe with historic buildings like the Simon Warehouse and the Armory, he added, and care needs to be taken to ensure those aging structures aren't disturbed. Project plans have been reviewed and approved by the State Historical Preservation Society, he said.\n\nAs a resident of the Simon Warehouse, Dominic Erickson came to the open house to learn how the lengthy construction process would impact him, mostly in terms of traffic, parking and noise, he said.\n\nWhile he’s not looking forward to the construction, he said, he is eager to see safety improvements for pedestrians along that “very dangerous” corridor.\n\nMnDOT has contracted with a business liaison to reach out to local businesses that may be impacted by the construction.\n\nFurther, the city encourages business owners to work with the free Small Business Development Center or call the city’s economic development office for guidance at 218-299-5441.\n\nThe Small Business Development Center has created a webinar specific to the underpass project and is available to provide free individualized consulting services to any businesses with concerns.\n\n“Moorhead is super lucky that we have them for resources,” said Amy Thorpe, Moorhead’s economic development program administrator.\n\nA Moorhead resident herself, the Small Business Development Center’s Associate Director Amy Anderson said her team is waiting in the wings, ready to help small businesses in any way they can.\n\nShe’s seen the community rally around Moorhead businesses in the past, she said, like Moorhead Freez, following construction impacts and vandalism .\n\n“This community stands by their businesses,” Anderson said. “I really think people will come together.”"
