        "text": "Are you one of the many of people who pedal down Illinois Street every day? Well, we’ve got good news for you: The unsafe tracks at Illinois and 18th Street have been repaired!\n\nThe current construction along Illinois Street has forced people on bike to have to cross a tangle of tracks at this busy intersection. Many SF Bicycle Coalition members have written to ask us to help get a safety fix. We’re happy to say that after conversations with the SFMTA, the City prioritized fixing this spot by filling in the space around the tracks with cold press. Huge thanks to Azhar Khaliq at the SFMTA for moving this crucial construction fix along!"
