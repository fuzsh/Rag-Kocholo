This forced Muni buses to pass up waiting riders – especially during morning commute times. To avoid pass-ups, the SFMTA will make a few changes as the school year approaches, including:\n\n48 Quintara-24th Street and 28R 19th Avenue Rapid: More buses in the morning.\n\n9 San Bruno: More room for riders on weekends.\n\n1 California: New schedule to reduce crowding on the route’s busiest stretch.\n\nMaking trips safer and more reliable through planned transit and safety projects\n\nThe SFMTA is also making changes that will complete transit and safety projects and changing some stops and routes to enhance traffic safety, decrease travel times and improve reliability.\n\nFor additional service details and impacted routes, visit our latest service changes blog (SFMTA.com/ServiceChanges).\n\nONGOING\n\nMasks Recommended\n\nMasks are no longer required, but are encouraged in any SFMTA facilities, transit hubs or on vehicles including Muni buses, streetcars, light rail vehicles or cable cars or in taxis or on paratransit.\n\nONGOING: Essential Trip Card Discount Program\n\nThe SFMTA’s program, Essential Trip Card (ETC) Program, assists people with disabilities and older adults to make essential trips using taxis. The program provides two to three round trips at an 80% discount per month, i.e. rider pays $6 to receive a value of $30 or pays $12 to receive a $60 value. If essential needs require it, riders may receive additional value up to $120 of taxi service per month.\n\nTo qualify for the program, customer must be either age 65 or older or an adult with disabilities.
