        "text": "Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE The biggest project in the history of the District Department of Transportation hit a milestone this weekend with the opening of the inbound side of the new 11th Street Bridge.\n\nThe new span across the Anacostia River allows drivers to access downtown from Interstate 295, and is the first part of a three-part project.\n\nIn about two weeks, the outbound bridge opens. Next summer a third, local bridge will connect Anacostia to Capitol Hill. That local bridge will also have space for bicyclists and pedestrians, as well as space for future transit.\n\nIn addition to the local bridge, two new ramps connecting outbound traffic to the northbound Anacostia Freeway and inbound traffic to the southbound Anacostia Freeway are scheduled to open next summer.\n\nThe existing outbound bridge will be used by trafic to Anacostia until next summer. Motoists wanting to access Anacostia from the Southeast/Southwest Freeway can either use the new outbound bridge to southbound Interstate 295 and take the Howard Road exit or exit the Southeast/Southwest Freeway at Sixth Street and take Virginia Avenue, 8th Street, M Street, and 11th Street to access the bridge."
