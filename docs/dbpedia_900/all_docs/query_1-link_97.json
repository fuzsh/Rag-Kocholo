        "text": "GREEN BAY - Wisconsin Department of Transportation officials Tuesday evening outlined plans to improve the Mason Street lift bridge and then reconstruct or replace the span across the Fox River over the next 10 years.\n\nAbout 30 citizens, several business people, and a City Council member representing some of the area served by the bridge, attended Tuesday's forum at Washington Middle School. At the event, DOT began asking for public input on the project; two DOT officials and a consultant spoke to the public briefly about plans.\n\nThe DOT has information posted about the project, but has yet to post a cost figure.\n\nHere is what to know about the projects, according to Tuesday's forum and the DOT:\n\nWhy does the Mason Street bridge matter to Green Bay?\n\nThe Mason Street bridge, formally known as the Donald A. Tilleman Bridge, carries State 54/Mason Street traffic across the Fox River, serving 34,200 vehicles on an average day. It's one of three bridges across the Fox River in downtown Green Bay.\n\nThe state Department of Transportation has jurisdiction of the bridge because it is also a state highway.\n\nThe current four-lane bridge was built in 1973.\n\nWhat does the project call for?\n\nThe rehabilitation project would begin in 2026 and focus on the lift span on the bridge, which raises for ship traffic on the river.\n\nHow much improvement is done to the existing bridge will be determined by the amount of replacement work DOT chooses to do.\n\n\"We probably won't sandblast and paint the bridge, if we're going to lower the height of the bridge to (near) ground level,\" said Joshua Lang, another project manager who spoke Tuesday.\n\nThe replacement/reconstruction phase would affect the entire span from 12th Street on the west side to Webster Avenue on the east side. Work on there would not begin until about 2031 or 2032.\n\nIf the bridge is replaced, the DOT might choose to adjust the height of the span, perhaps taking it from its current height to something closer to ground level, said Bryan D. Lipke, one of the project managers.\n\nWhat are the possible outcomes of the Mason Street bridge reconstruction/placement project?\n\nNo change: The span is built at essentially the same height, and with essentially the same ramp system.\n\nLowering the bridge: DOT builds the new bridge closer to street level.\n\nCombination: Build a bridge that combines multiple elements of the two approaches.\n\nWhat's the expected timing of the work?\n\nThe DOT began studying the project this year. DOT expects to be able to address the amount of repair to be done versus the amount of pure construction after 2026. Building would begin in 2031.\n\nWhatâ€™s driving the change?\n\nThe main reasons for the projects:\n\nHeavy use and winters of icy/snowy weather create a need for frequent repairs.\n\nSome drivers complain about the long on/off ramps and/or the danger and lack of room to merge on the ramp from South Ashland Avenue to eastbound Mason Street.\n\nOthers, including City Council member Brian Johnson, want a bridge that's not elevated. They say it will incorporate more easily with the neighborhoods it serves. Green Bay school officials complain that the current bridge makes it difficult for Howe Elementary School students who walk south of the building.\n\nWhere can I find detailed information online?\n\nThe DOT has two pages for the project:\n\nThe Mason Street bridge rehabilitation project can be found online at https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/projects/by-region/ne/masonbrrehab/default.aspx\n\nThe replacement/reconstruction project can be found online at https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/projects/by-region/ne/masonstudy32/default.aspx\n\nWhat if I want to add my voice?\n\nTo comment on the rehabilitation project:\n\nEmail Joshua.Lang@dot.wi.gov.\n\nCall Lang at 920-492-4141\n\nYou can also download a comment form.\n\nFor the replacement/reconstruction project:\n\nEmail Bryan.Lipke@dot.wi.gov\n\nCall Lipke at 920-492-5703\n\nOr you can also comment online.\n\nWill there be more public meetings?\n\nYes, the DOT plans two more public meetings, with the next planned for fall 2024.\n\nEmail Doug Schneider at DSchneid@Gannett.com, call him at (920) 599-0809 and follow him on X (formerly Twitter) @PGDougSchneider"
