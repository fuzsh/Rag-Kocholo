DOT has opened the comment period (May 30, 2018 – July 31, 2018) please email comments to Hanover St. Bridge Study. You can mail comments to Hanover Street Corridor Study Baltimore City Department of Transportation, Transportation Planning Division, 417 East Fayette Street, Room 747, Baltimore, MD 21202.\n\nThe Hanover Street Corridor Study establishes a framework for Baltimore City’s investment in transportation, education, recreation, regional competitiveness, and economic development. The study will identify feasible methods of rehabilitating or replacing the Hanover Street Bridge, improve multimodal corridor accessibility and freight access, and highlight ways to enhance access to economic opportunities and recreational amenities, quality of life, and safety throughout the corridor. In addition to improving the structure, there is an amazing opportunity to expand the project beyond the engineering elements and to make improvements, and create connections for nearby communities.\n\nThe neighborhoods south of the bridge are largely low-income, suffer from high unemployment, and experience other quality of life issues. Establishing improved transit, pedestrian, and bicycle linkages to the economic opportunities, services, education, food options, health providers, and other amenities in the downtown area would greatly help to improve these conditions. The Plan will form the ladders of opportunity to residents of South Baltimore communities – improving multimodal access and connectivity to employment, educational, recreational, and transportation alternatives. The Plan will ensure that smart reinvestment and rehabilitation of our transportation infrastructure will bring growth and attract investments to the area. To view the Hanover Street Corridor Study TIGER VI.\n\nThe Hanover Street Corridor Study engages a Community Advisory Panel (CAP) and Interagency Advisory Group (IAG) as a part of its public involvement strategy.
