Currently, there are two (2) sanitary sewer forcemain pipes that run from the lift station that is off of 33rd Street South (at the north part of the River Bluffs Regional Park) to the Wastewater Treatment Facility that is located off of 60th Street South. These sewer pipes were installed in the 1970’s, prior to the City of St. Cloud acquiring and establishing this land as a Regional Park. These forcemains are the most critical component of the City’s wastewater collection system and convey 98% of the wastewater (~10,000,000 gallons per day) from St. Cloud, Sartell, Sauk Rapids, St. Joseph, and Waite Park to the treatment facility. Recently, the City has had to complete emergency repairs on this forcemain due to its age and the level of deterioration that is occurring. Recent inspections continue to indicate excessive deterioration is occurring at a rapid rate and the forcemain system needs replacement.\n\nAs mentioned above, these forcemains were installed in the early 1970’s, before the property was acquired and developed into a park. Below is an image of what the area looked like during the original installation.\n\nBelow is a history of past projects completed on the critical Metro Forcemain Project and timeline for current project.\n\nThe Metro Forcemain Replacement Project is scheduled to begin this summer to install a new forcemain between the lift station and the Wastewater Treatment Facility. Due to the amount of wastewater that the in-place pipes carry, they must remain in service until the new forcemain is installed and operational. An offset from the existing pipes to the new installation is required due to the deteriorated state of the existing forcemains and the construction activities necessary to install the new forcemain. The alignment for installation of the new 42” forcemain is illustrated below."
