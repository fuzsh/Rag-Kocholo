        "text": "Overview\n\nIn summer 2024 the City of Lynchburg embarked on the fourth phase of the Downtown Renewal Project. The Downtown Renewal Project, which began in 2016, is a multi-million-dollar investment by the City of Lynchburg to upgrade downtown's aging underground utility infrastructure and enhance streetscapes. The fourth phase of this project will impact Main Street between 12th Street and the Lynchburg Expressway — one of the most utilized gateways to Downtown Lynchburg.\n\nOver the next two years, these five blocks of Main Street, will undergo significant revitalization. To mitigate disruptions throughout this project to visitor traffic, residents, and business owners, the fourth phase of the Downtown Renewal Project will be split into three segments— more details below.\n\nThis multi-phased project will replace centuries-old waterlines, improving sanitary sewer and storm systems, and beautifying the streetscapes to create a vibrant and pedestrian-friendly environment that supports continued development in Downtown Lynchburg. As utility work is completed, gateway beautification will begin by restoring each block with updated streetscape features that encourage an enhanced pedestrian and vehicular experience. Features will include new brick sidewalks, historically designed streetlights, new trees and plantings, and redesigned parking and loading zone areas.\n\nWhat to know about construction\n\nCity of Lynchburg construction contractors are working Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. While construction is underway, the project zone being worked on at that time will be closed to vehicular traffic and on-street parking. However, pedestrian access to all businesses will be maintained. Detours will be put in place as construction begins.\n\nFor available parking options in Downtown Lynchburg, click here.\n\nThere will be occasional service disruptions for residents and business owners, however, affected businesses should receive notice of any utility disruptions to water, electricity, or gas at least 24 to 48 hours prior to any planned outages. Underground construction always contains some risk of the contractor striking an unknown utility line, which may result in an unplanned, temporary water shutdown. The City will do everything in its power to minimize these unplanned events and restore the system to working condition as quickly as possible when they occur.\n\nCurrent Detours\n\nEastbound access to the Lynchburg Expressway will be from 12th Street to Church Street, then Church Street to the southbound Expressway, or Pearl Street to back on Main Street to access the northbound Expressway.\n\nThose accessing Downtown from the Lynchburg Expressway during construction will be signaled to take the Expressway to Main Street, Main Street to Commerce Street, then Commerce Street back up 11th Street to Main Street.\n\nPlease follow detour signs and signals during construction to ensure safe and efficient navigation around the Downtown Renewal Construction Project.\n\nWhy Downtown?\n\nThe City of Lynchburg identified the need to proactively replace downtown Lynchburg's underground water utilities. With waterlines dating to the mid-1800s and early-1900s, we will increase capacity for future customers and reduce costly and impactful breaks by replacing these aging waterlines with brand-new, larger ones. According to the Ductile Iron Pipe Research Association (DIPRA), the expected useable life of unlined cast iron pipe is 100 years. These upgrades are necessary for continued and sustained development in Downtown Lynchburg. It was decided that as long as we were disrupting businesses with construction, we should also provide an entirely new and beautiful above-ground experience for pedestrians and motorists.\n\nBetween Court Street and the James River, spanning Fifth Street to 13th Street, fifty blocks were identified for renewal. The Downtown Renewal Project began in April 2016 and will continue until all phases are completed. Work was completed on portions of Main, Church, and Commerce Street, with the remainder of Main Street — from 12th Street to the Expressway — being next.\n\nDowntown Renewal Construction Project Phasing\n\nPhase I (Mid-2024 to Early-2025):\n\nPhase I will begin in late July 2024, and will primarily close the 1300 block of Main Street. This will be a two-part endeavor. At first, the entirety of the 1300 block will be closed along with parts of the 1200 block just before the 13th Street intersection. The Main and 13th Street intersection should reopen tentatively by September 2024 while the remainder of the 1300 block is tentatively scheduled to reopen in early 2025.\n\nThese dates are weather-dependent and are subject to change.\n\nPhase II (Early-2025 to Late-2025):\n\nPhase II will primarily close the 1200 block to vehicular traffic, and will be a three-part endeavor. At first, the 1200 block of Main Street will be closed; however, access to the Lynchburg Community Market will remain in place from the 12th Street entrance and a temporary parking lot connector will be installed to connect to the Market’s larger parking lot.\n\nDuring the second part of this phase, the 1200 block closest to the Lynchburg Community Market entrance closest to the 1300 block will reopen. Allowing for access to the Lynchburg Community Market from the 1300 block entrance, the temporary parking lot connector will remain in place allowing access to the Market’s smaller parking lot.\n\nDuring the third part of this phase, a section of the 1200 block will be closed, blocking the 1300 block entrance of the Lynchburg Community Market to the 13th Street intersection.\n\nThese dates are weather-dependent and are subject to change.\n\nPhase III (Mid-2025 to Mid-2026):\n\nPhase III, which will primarily impact the remainder of the project from the 1400 block of Main Street to the Lynchburg Expressway bridge.\n\nThe first part will include the 1400 block of Main Street between Commerce Street and Washington Street. This construction will tentatively allow for one-way traffic.\n\nThe second part of Phase III will start from the intersection of Washington Street to South Pearl Street.\n\nFinally, the project starts from North Pearl Street and ends just before the Lynchburg Expressway bridge. A single lane of one-way traffic will be between Washington and Commerce Street to facilitate local traffic coming from the Lynchburg Expressway.\n\nThese dates are weather-dependent and are subject to change."
