        "text": "Sometimes through work, you are fortunate to meet a true #heroine who lit up the #world. I am #grateful beyond words to have had time with the #indefatigable #DrRuth, #therapist to not only us humans but to #FortTryonPark, her beloved #refuge especially this spring/summer. Her life is the stuff of #operas and #music was her big love later in her life. Please stay tuned for our celebration of her in the #park and come visit her #tulips and keep #love & #laughter going like her and her son here at the cottage with her #forttryonparktrust sunglasses on. She will continue to shine forever.\n\n#Parks are #Vital to the #health of #nature, #communities and us #humans. Check out our new #VitalParks initiative at #NYCParks and check on your community’s vitality and consider joining us as a #volunteer like Nancy Bruning here did many years ago at #FortTryonParkTrust! https://lnkd.in/d6wEWJNu"
