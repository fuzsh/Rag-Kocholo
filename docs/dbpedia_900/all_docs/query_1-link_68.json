        "text": "Morgan Street Bridge –\n\nWork completed October 6, 2014!\n\nAs part of the overall Circle Interchange project, the Morgan Street Bridge, as well as the Westbound I-290 exit ramp to Morgan Street, was closed for reconstruction beginning September 2013 until approximately late Fall, 2014.\n\nView construction progress.\n\nThe Morgan Street Bridge was closed in its entirety and was re-opened to vehicular traffic in late Fall, 2014. Morgan Street CTA station was open to the public by Memorial Day.\n\nThe project included reconstruction of Morgan Bridge over I-290 and CTA Blue Line, construction of retaining walls, relocation of existing water main and sewers, traffic signals, and roadway lighting. The project also required extensive coordination with ComEd to maintain their existing high voltage cables during the construction of the new bridge.\n\nThe detour for the Morgan Street Bridge closure was Van Buren Street to Racine Street to Harrison Street.\n\nThe detour for the Westbound I-290 exit ramp to Morgan Street was:\n\nFrom Southbound I-90/94 - exit Adams Street\n\nFrom Northbound I-90/94 - exit Ashland Avenue, backtrack east via Jackson Boulevard or Harrison Street\n\nExiting access is prohibited from Westbound I-290/Congress Parkway\n\nAdditionally, the Morgan Street CTA entrance was closed starting September 23, 2013. The nearby CTA stations at Peoria Street and Halsted Street continued full service until the Morgan Street Station was opened.\n\nLane shifts were needed on I-290 to enable bridge pier and abutment construction. A lane closure on westbound I-290 was anticipated from Jefferson Street to the merging of the SW and NW ramp for maintaining traffic.\n\nThe construction contract was awarded to F.H. Paschen/S.N. Nielsen, Inc. on August 22, 2013, and the scope of work involved the complete removal and replacement of the existing bridge structure which carries Morgan Street over Eisenhower Expressway (I-290). The new bridge structure is longer to create space underneath along I-290 for the future improvements planned for the interchange between the Dan Ryan Expressway (I-90/94) and I-290, locally known as the Circle Interchange.\n\nMorgan Street Features Include:\n\nMorgan Street consists of 2 lanes in each direction\n\nOrnamental bridge parapets for fencing and railings\n\nSidewalk on both sides varying in width from 9 to 11 feet\n\nThe traffic signal at the Morgan St. and Westbound I-290 Exit Ramp/Tilden St. intersection is modernized\n\nUnderpass bridge lighting is upgraded along I-290 underneath the bridge\n\nExisting sidewalks are reconstructed to current ADA standards per the City of Chicago requirements.\n\nExisting bridge mounted signs are upgraded.\n\nThe Department appreciates your patience and understanding as we work to improve the multi-modal connections in your community."
