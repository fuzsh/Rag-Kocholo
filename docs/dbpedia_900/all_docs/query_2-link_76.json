        "text": "As the city of Aurora improves its infrastructure offerings to its current and future residents, demands for more infrastructure, improvements and repairs also grow. On any given work day, there can be as many as 100 active work zones within the city.\n\nTraffic engineering staff make every effort to minimize the impact of these work zones to the traveling public. In addition to reviewing and approving the plans to ensure they are safe and compliant with all regulations, staff also work with contractors to seek alternatives to street closures and minimize the number of lane closures and their duration. Staff also try to keep conflicting work zones from overlapping in time or space. In most cases, these efforts are successful. However, on occasion, alternatives are not available and since we are dealing with the outdoor environment, even the best planned projects get delayed by weather, special events or unknown conditions, resulting in confusion and/or unplanned congestion.\n\nSign up now for weekly construction updates delivered directly to your inbox via Road Construction Roundup.\n\nNew interactive map now available\n\nThe city has launched a new online map that shows work happening throughout the city that may impact travel on roadways. The map captures annual street maintenance work, transportation projects, public and private utility work, and development projects impacting roadways. Visit this link to view the map.\n\nAnnual Street Maintenance Work\n\nThe 2024 road construction projects map is now posted.
