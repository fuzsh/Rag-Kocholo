        "text": "What We Do: Operations, Maintenance and Retrofitting\n\nThe goal of the Bridge Program is to extend the service life of our bridges, maintain their historic character, provide safe travel for all, and protect the public’s investment. We achieve these goals efficiently and cost-effectively by practicing innovative maintenance management.\n\nRead more below to learn about Seattle’s bridges, how to use them, and how we are working to maintain and improve them.\n\nPictured: The Aurora, Fremont, and Ballard Bridges\n\nBridges and Travel\n\nSome of Seattle's bridges, like the West Seattle Bridge, make connections over bodies of water. Other bridges, like the Magnolia Bridge, are viaducts that make connections over valleys. Some bridges, like the Fremont Bridge, serve all travel modes. Others, like the W Thomas St Overpass, are limited to foot or bike traffic.\n\nPosted vehicle weight restrictions on bridges\n\nEnforcing maximum vehicle loads on bridges is important to maintaining bridge safety and long-term health. See the chart below for current weight restrictions by structure:\n\nStructure Name Location Weight Restriction Magnolia Bridge Center, Pier 91 ramps to Port of Seattle on Magnolia Bridge No trucks allowed McGraw St Bridge McGraw Street over the ravine near 3rd Ave North AASHTO Type 3: 19 tons\n\nAASHTO Type 3S2: 29 tons\n\nSingle truck, 4 axle: 17 tons\n\nSingle truck, 5 axle: 19 tons\n\nSingle truck, 6 axle: 18 tons\n\nSingle truck, 7 axle: 18 tons E Interlaken Blvd East Interlaken Blvd over 26th Ave East 19 tons Fairview Ave N (southbound) Fairview Ave N between East Galer and E Prospect streets 40 tons Cowen Park Bridge 15th Ave NE between Cowen Place NE and NE 62nd St Single truck, 7 axle: 36 tons\n\nClick here to learn more about bridge weight limit signs.\n\nFor information regarding Commercial Vehicle Permits please contact trafficpermitsinfo@seattle.gov, call (206) 684-5086, or visit the webpage.\n\nSeattle's moveable bridges\n\nSeattle has seven vehicular, moveable bridges over navigable water. Four of these are owned by SDOT. Federal law requires bridges open for marine traffic, with few exceptions. Seattle is part of the US Coast Guard 13th District.
