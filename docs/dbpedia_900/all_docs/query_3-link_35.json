        "text": "(for both Y and me...)\n\nU R right about consultant and hype driven planning. It's also the Mayors and Council people in places too.\n\nCutting a ribbon is a lot more fun than the nitty gritty.\n\nMayor Gray is a perfect case in point with sustainability. He went to a conf., heard other mayors talking about what's happening in their cities, and then came back and said \"we have to be the best at sustainability.\"\n\nSo we have a sustainability plan and goals, but most of the time, when practices are being implemented, they fall short of sustainability best practice or the general concept of sustainability.\n\ne.g., my point about Dunbar or yours about Cardozo.\n\nAlthough I would have put the money into Cardozo, not Dunbar, because the center city needs a high school, and the redistributed students from Dunbar would have helped the other schools.\n\nNote we are running into the same coming problem with Roosevelt and Coolidge, both in Ward 4. There's not enough students really for both the schools. Nothing is happening right now to end the momentum to rehabilitate both.\n\nThat's why I keep suggesting moving Ellington to one of the schools. That would allow the reopening of Western to serve Upper Northwest, as Wilson is overcapacity.\n\nIt would make the \"City\" \"Arts\" school Metrorail accessible, which is a plus.\n\nAnd it would allow W4 to have one in boundary high school at full enrollment strength.\n\nNow that's sustainability, and it would require making hard, bold choices.\n\nI don't see it happening.\n\n.... it's not a fully appropriate example, but one of the comments I make about Balt. County Govt. is that the elected officials only compare how they are doing to Baltimore City. That's a competition they'll always win on economic grounds, for the most part.\n\nBut it's not either a fair comparison or the right comparison, if they really want to be great (which is arguable too, maybe being better off than Baltimore City is enough). They need to benchmark against highly functioning counties in the region, not Baltimore City...\n\nSo with DC it's my counter application of Moynihan's \"defining deviance down.\" As the national capital, we define whatever we do as \"world class\" even when it isn't. I call it \"defining mediocrity up.\""
