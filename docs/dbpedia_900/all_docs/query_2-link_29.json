        "text": "Two vital infrastructure bridges around the Oak and 11th streets intersection will see some intensive care that the public likely won’t see since it’s below road level. The project involving the 53- and 73-year-old bridges addresses erosion around the foundations.\n\n“The project includes only minimal improvements that will be noticeable to the public at the street level as the majority of the work will be in Soda Creek itself,” said Danny Paul, city public works engineer and project manager. “When complete, this work will fortify the structures to better ensure they can withstand flooding until the bridges can ultimately be replaced in the future.”\n\nThe existing creek bed has become compromised by scouring and erosion over the long life of the channel and bridge structures under the streets. Bridge scour, or the process of erosion around a bridge foundation caused by flooding, is the leading cause of bridge failure.\n\nProject work consists of scour countermeasures and bridge rehabilitation that extends from downstream of 11th Street to upstream of Oak Street, but in the immediate area of the bridge crossings under 11th and Oak streets.\n\nThe project has been in planning and design for several years and was delayed multiple times due to the pandemic and funding issues. The city received most of the funding for the project from the Colorado Department of Transportation/Colorado Municipal League off-system bridge program, which provided nearly $1.18 million of the $1.39 million needed overall for the work.\n\nMyers & Sons has been tapped as contractor for the work. The contractor will place machinery and rock into the creek to execute the required work depending upon creek flows and weather. The area will see additional heavy construction machinery and trucks delivering materials to and from the work zone.\n\nBeginning the week of Aug. 14, Oak Street between 10th and 11th streets will be closed to all vehicle traffic. Residents and businesses on the 9th to 10th streets block of Oak Street will be allowed to access the area. A walking path will be available to pedestrians and bicyclists through the closure area, although cyclists will be asked to dismount and walk their bike through the detour path.\n\nThe closure is expected to be in place for two months. Later in the project, the work will require a closure of 11th Street to vehicle traffic but that closure is anticipated for late-September when traffic should be lighter. When this occurs, Oak Street will reopen to vehicle traffic.\n\nThe work will also require closure of several public parking spaces on 11th and Oak Streets and at the northwest corner of the 11th and Oak streets intersection where the contractor will stage materials.\n\nAll businesses and residential areas will remain accessible throughout the project. Myers & Sons has until Nov. 1 to complete the project."
