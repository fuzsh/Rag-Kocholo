Project Overview

​

By far the largest District Department of Transportation (DDOT) project completed to date, the 11th Street Bridge Project is critical to improving travel and achieving the larger vision of the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative.

​

The project replaced two bridges built in the 1960s with three new bridges that separate local and freeway traffic. The new freeway bridges also provide the missing interstate connections between I-695 (also known as the Southeast-Southwest Freeway) and DC-295, fixing a long-standing deficiency that forced motorists to use local streets to connect to and from both freeways.
