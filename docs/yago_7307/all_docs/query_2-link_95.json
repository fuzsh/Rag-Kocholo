        "text": "Ole Miss resumes the second week of preseason camp with a morning practice on Thursday.\n\nA few Rebels might have an extra pep in their step when they do.\n\nSenior Tre Harris is on the preseason watchlist for the Biletnikoff Award, which goes each year to college football’s best receiver. Ulysses Bentley, IV, landed on the Doak Walker (best running back) watchlist.\n\nOle Miss won a program-record 11 games last season, their 10-win-or-better campaign in four years under head coach Lane Kiffin. The Rebels were ranked this week No. 6 in the preseason Top 25 coaches poll. They open against Furman August 31.\n\nHarris is one of six All-SEC Rebels. Ole Miss was projected to finish fourth by league media.\n\n“There’s a lot of expectations on us this year,” Harris said at SEC Media Days last month. “We can only control what we can control, and we’re all are just worried about the guys inside of the facility. We understand each and every day we have to get better.\n\n“That’s the main goal — trying to get better every single day and trying to get the best possible expectations as possible.”\n\nRELATED: Ole Miss has one of the more enviable QB rooms in college football\n\nBentley, IV, is a senior and the highest-graded returning running back in the SEC.\n\nHe served as the primary backup to Quinshon Judkins last season. Bentley, IV, has 2,172 rushing yards for his career and averaged 5.7 yards per carry.\n\n“I don’t really look at it as weight on my shoulders,” Bentley, IV, said of his new role as lead Ole Miss back. “We’ve got a lot of guys who transferred in. We’ve got a lot of weapons on our team. Kiffin is smart enough to utilize all the talent we’ve got in our room.\n\n“We all know what our goal is.”\n\nThe included photos were provided by Ole Miss Athletics and Bruce Newman of the Ole Miss Spirit.\n\nLane Kiffin (©Bruce Newman)\n\nHenry Parrish, Jr. (©Bruce Newman)\n\nAustin Simmons (©Bruce Newman)\n\nJaxson Dart (©Bruce Newman)\n\nAustin Simmons (©Bruce Newman)\n\nWalker Howard (©Bruce Newman)\n\nCayden Lee (©Bruce Newman)\n\nWalter Nolen\n\nJaxson Dart and Caden Prieskorn\n\nJaxson Dart\n\nJared Ivey\n\nTre Harris\n\nJaxson Dart\n\nLane Kiffin\n\nJohn Saunders\n\nHenry Parrish, Jr.\n\nUlysses Bentley, IV\n\nJJ Pegues"
