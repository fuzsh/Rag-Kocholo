It was the first practical mechanism for altering on demand the valve timing on a truck diesel engine, thereby converting the engine to a power absorbing machine. The modified engine can continue to power the truck in normal operation, allowing service brakes to remain cool for emergency situations. Invented by Clessie Lyle Cummins (1886-1968), this device (produced by the Jacobs manufacturing company since 1961) has contributed significantly to highway safety.\n\nLandmark Location\n\nJacobs Manufacturing Company\n\n22 East Dudley Town Road\n\nBloomfield, CT 06002\n\nVisiting Info\n\nRegular Hours: Mon-Fri 8-5:30\n\nLinks\n\nOwner site\n\nhttp://www.jakebrake.com/\n\nCummins Engine site\n\nhttp://www.cummins.com/\n\nCeremony Notes\n\nOctober 1985"
