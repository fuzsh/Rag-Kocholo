        "text": "For the past couple of decades, Cincinnati’s Jake Speed has carried on the American Folk tradition, not only in his rootsy musical base (shaped and performed with his band The Freddies), but also in lyrical musings that never shy away from addressing current \"hot-button\" social and political concerns in the spirit of Folk icon Woody Guthrie.\n\nEarlier this month, Speed and his Freddies posted a new song that directly addresses the social injustice that has been re-entered the spotlight in Donald Trump’s America.\n\nIn “Take a Knee,” Speed addresses police brutality, racial injustice, income inequality, anti-immigrant and anti-LGBTQ sentiment and more. If Guthrie was still around today, \"Take a Knee\" is probably the closest to what kind of songs he'd be writing. Think of it as the intelligent answer to that weird faux-patriotic tune \"Take A Knee, My Ass (I Won't Take A Knee)\" that everyone made fun of last year.\n\nWatch a clip of the band performing “Take a Knee” and read the lyrics below:\n\nSeen you on the roadside shoulder/Officer done pulled you over\n\nSaid your taillights broken, boy/Now step out in the street\n\nHeard you ask ‘What’s this about?’/Heard the officer start to shout\n\nHeard his gun come quickly out/Come on take a knee with me\n\nTake a knee, take a knee, take a knee with me, everybody take a knee with me\n\nIf you believe this land is free, come on take a knee with me\n\nSeen you down on Ellis Island/Far from home, a thousand miles\n\nTired, poor, yet still a-smilin’/Yearning to breathe free\n\nImmigration agent frowns/Says your god is too dark brown\n\nWhite House men done turn you down/Come on take a knee with me\n\nTake a knee, take a knee, take a knee with me, everybody take a knee with me\n\nIf you believe this land is free, come on take a knee with me\n\nSeen you down at the southern border/following the law and order\n\nWorking late for 8 and a quarter/Seven mouths to feed\n\nBorder agent hunts you down/Says you got to leave this town\n\nHe don’t care ‘bout hungry mouths/Come on take a knee with me\n\nTake a knee, take a knee, take a knee with me, everybody take a knee with me\n\nIf you believe this land is free, come on take a knee with me\n\nSeen you meet the baker man/Talking bout your wedding plan\n\nHad your fiancé in hand/Two men finally free\n\nHeard the baker man’s disfavor/Love like yours ain’t worth his labor\n\nWhat happened to love thy neighbor?/Take a Knee with me\n\nTake a knee, take a knee, take a knee with me, everybody take a knee with me\n\nIf you believe this land is free, come on take a knee with me\n\n“Stand back up” you hear ‘em scream/“That’s disrespect! Can’t you see?!”\n\n\"Them soldiers died, now on your feet”/They say to make you weak\n\nBut I seen a tear drop from your eyes/Thinking about the sacrifice\n\nAll the men who gave their lives/So you could take a knee\n\nTake a knee, take a knee, take a knee with me, everybody take a knee with me\n\nIf you believe this land is free, come on take a knee with me\n\nSpeed hosts the next installment of his “Signs and Songs” Americana music series at the American Sign Museum on Oct. 19 with jug-band greats Cincinnati Dancing Pigs. Tickets are available here.\n\nHere is a short documentary about the series:"
