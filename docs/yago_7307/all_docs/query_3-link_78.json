        "text": "Death Cloud By Andrew Lane The book I read was “Death Cloud” by Andrew Lane, it is about when Sherlock Holmes started detective work. Most of us know about the great detective that Sherlock Holmes was known as, but have you ever wondered how he got that way. This book gives you the opportunity to find out the past behind the genius detective. I chose this book because I like Sherlock Holmes.\n\nThis book changed my outlook by taking a character I already knew about and cared for.

The book takes a character that already exists and adds more story to them. I would love to read more of this author because of the fact that this book is a series. This series could possibly shed more light on how Sherlock Holmes became the detective that we know"
