        "text": "I am a London-based corporate photographer working for a range of clients in the Banking, Insurance and Legal sectors as well PR and Events clients. I previously worked for The Sunday Times and The Daily Telegraph before migrating to predominantly corporate work.\n\nI have a vast experience of photographing people in a range of settings, whether it be for posed portraits, at work or at an event, dinner or awards night. This helps me get the best from any given situation as I know what to expect. Luckily, I really enjoy what I do, with every day being a new challenge. With photography, you pretty much only get out what you put in, so I try to engage with my subjects, when required, to put them at their ease and to make the process as painless as possible.\n\nI hope you enjoy looking at the pictures on this site but if you have any questions please contact me and I will be only too happy to discuss something you have in mind.\n\nThanks and best wishes, Andy\n\n07973 414257\n\nandy@andylane.com\n\nRecent clients include: Deutsche Bank, J P Morgan, RBC Wealth Management, Bain Capital, Apax Partners, Shawbrook Bank, Fidelity Investment, First State Investment, Peel Hunt, Willis Towers Watson, BRIT Insurance, Liberty Global, BMS, Guy Carpenter, Mercer, White & Case LLP, Covington & Burling LLP, Royd Withy King LLP, Milbank Tweed & Hadley LLP, Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, Henderson Chambers, 7 Bedford Row, 3 Paper Buildings, 20 Essex Street, Red Consultancy, Hill & Knowlton, Informa Business Information, Euromoney, European CEO, Professional Investor, Hermes RPI, IO Asset Management and The Royal Parks."
