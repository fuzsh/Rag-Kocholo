        "text": "Role in the Film[]\n\nAnd now, I get to play Rattlesnake Jake, and he's pretty scary. I love the way he looks. You know, if you're gonna be a snake, and if you're drawn by Crash, you're in good shape.\n\n— Bill Nighy, Jake's actor, describing Rattlesnake snake.\n\nRattlesnake Jake was initially brought into the plot by Mayor John to be used as a hitman, after being mentioned several times by townsfolk to instill fear of the character in the audience.\n\nIn a mock standoff, Rango lures Jake over a covered mole hole which serves as a trap. Once he moved onto it, the characters helping Rango turned the valve which turned on the waterflow, causing the hole to erupt with a geyser of water and fling Jake far into the air. Jake comes crashing down, spitting threats at Rango. Rango then tricks Jake into hiding with the aid of the moles, flying through the air on bats in a hawk-shaped formation. However, Jake soon realizes the facade and starts to shoot wildly at the bats, eventually draining his ammo completely. Rango takes the opportunity and turns the tables on Jake, aiming his revolver with a single bullet directly at Jake's face. Jake sees that the cowardice that was once in Rango's eyes is no more and gains a new respect for him, withdrawing from the conflict as Mayor John calls Rango towards the bank. After Rango's deft escape from the bank using his last bullet, Mayor John is left prone and at the mercy of both Rango and Jake. Rango turns Mayor John over to Jake, the two exchange a mutual tip of the hat, \"From one legend to another\", and Rattlesnake Jake slithers off into the distance with Mayor John in his coils. It is assumed that, after the movie's conclusion, the Mayor is killed by Jake.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nJake is a western diamondback rattlesnake, and he has the same appearance of the real species. He has the typical fangs of a rattlesnake, which contain deadly venom, and a black snake tongue. His eyes are yellow-orange, and as an allusion to how he comes from Hell, they have fiery irises. A gatling gun rattle replaces his natural rattle, which he either lost in a battle (probably with the Hawk) or decided to remove and replace.\n\nFighting Style[]\n\nJake is a large animal and uses this to his advantage. When he wishes, he can use his coils to squeeze the life out of anyone small enough to fit in them. He can slam his bodyweight around in powerful waves, knocking over anyone or anything in his path.\n\nJake uses his Gatling gun with both speed and accuracy. A prime example of this was shown when he was seen for the first time in the film; he shot down the Sheriff sign with his Gatling gun, without damaging anything or anyone else. This is quite impressive, considering the fact that Gatling guns are known for having poor accuracy.\n\nLike all diamondback rattlesnakes, he can inject a strong venom with his fangs. In the film, this venom is seen only once, when Jake arrives at Dirt and meets Rango for the first time. The serpent balances a shot glass atop his Gatling gun and fills it with his venom, mockingly offering it to Rango as a drink. This references Rango falsely stating that Jake is his brother and that he is immune to his venom, and that he uses Jake's venom in his coffee to give it a little kick. Jake never used his venom on-screen again in the film.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nLike many antagonists, Rattlesnake Jake Snake exhibits significant antisocial behaviors: he is cruel and vicious; he is mostly seen using violence to threaten others, and shows no mercy to his victims.\n\nUnlike a common mercenary, who kills people only for cash, Jake is sadistic and loves his job. He seems to derive pleasure from instilling fear in those around him and causing violence. During the scene in which Beans is being made to give up her ranch, Mayor John calls upon Jake to ''persuade'' her into signing the papers. Instead of simply pushing the woman to signing, Jake immediately takes her up into his coils, laughing and taunting her. Mayor John objects to this treatment, but Jake does not care. After she objects to signing the papers, Jake happily offers Beans a descriptive account of how he's going to squeeze her until her eyes pop out.\n\nAs a badass western gunslinger, Jake has also a strong sense of honor and shows respect towards fighters he considers skilled and brave enough to compete with him. In fact, when Rango saves the town of Dirt using \"just one bullet\", Jake considers him a legend and shows him mutual respect.\n\nIt can be inferred that Jake possesses effective information gathering skills. When he met Rango for the first time, he knew all about the stories Rango told to make himself famous, including the lies he told about Jake and himself being brothers. He was also able to quickly deduce that Rango cares most about Beans and Priscilla, using them as levy to scare Rango.\n\nQuotes[]\n\n\"Long time, 'brother'... how ya been keepin'?\"\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n\"This is my town now. If I ever see you again I will drag your soul straight down to hell!\"\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nJake: \"Sign the damn paper, woman!\"\n\nBeans: \"Go to hell!\"\n\nJake: \"Where do you think I come from?\"\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nMayor: \"Stop, Jake, there's no need-\"\n\nJake: \"Let me do my job! You brought me in, now we're gonna play this thing out to the end!\"\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n\"I'm gonna blow so many holes in you, yer guts'll be leaking lead!!\"\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n(mocking the Mayor) What was that you said..? \"Pretty soon, no one will believe you even existed!\"\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Or what, little man? You gonna kill me?\"\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n\"One bullet... I tip my hat to you, one legend to another\" - Jake respecting Rango for his heroic act\n\nTrivia[]\n\nIt's unknown how Jake lost his rattle-tail, but it is theorized to have happened while fighting the Hawk in the past and being injured. Jake also has a strong fear of hawks, and this reinforces the theory.\n\nIt's also possible that the serpent just voluntarily \"modified\" the rattle of this tail in order to do that lethal deadly machine-gun. However it's unknown how and where he modified it.\n\nThe end of the Hawk's beak is replaced with steel. Some believe it was lost in an incident with Jake, possibly the same that cost the snake his rattle.\n\nRattlesnake Jake may be based on Angel Eyes (played by the late Lee Van Cleef) from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Both wear similar black cowboy hats, hold prominent moustaches and share similar personality traits and dialect. Angel Eyes was the arch-nemesis of the Man with No Name, aka the Spirit of the West, in that same film, similar to Jake being Rango's nemesis. There is a difference though; unlike Angel Eyes, Jake has a sense of honor and dignity.\n\nAccording to the DVD's extras, it was actually him that killed the Jenkin Brothers, in which explains why he was enraged when he calls Rango out for his lies.\n\nThe upper part Jake's body is covered with bandoliers. But due to his lack of arms, it is unknown how is he able to reload his rattle gun (some theories are that he uses his mouth, gets assistance from others, or his prosthetic is complex enough that the bandoliers feed their bullets to the gun internally).\n\nJake is thought to have areflexia, which is the absence of common reflexes such as the \"knee-jerk\" reaction. This is to often to be to be think of, it is to be because he does not have knees, that rattlesnake snake.\n\nBill Nighy (Rattlesnake Jake's VA) and Johnny Depp (Rango's VA) work together in Pirates of the Caribbean film series, as the antagonist Davy Jones and protagonist Captain Jack Sparrow, respectively.\n\nRattlesnake Jake also shares some traits with Davy Jones considering them being played by the same actor, including speech patterns, how they move their head when they talk etc. However, unlike Davy Jones, he's able to respect his enemies, as shown in the ending.\n\nThe quote \"I tip my hat to you, one legend to another\" from Jake is used as a meme on the internet as a way of showing respect to other legends, such as Bob Ross, Keanu Reeves, Chuck Norris, etc. More can be read about this on Know Your Meme.\n\nIt is possible that Jake's real name is \"Jacob\", since \"Jake\" is a diminutive of Jacob.\n\nAll of his scales are unique scales the animators made and not reused scales.\n\nIt is unknown if Jake's first name is 'Rattlesnake' or 'Jake'. He was never confirmed to have a surname, and most of the times he's been referred to in the film he was called his full title.\n\nIt's likely that his name is simply 'Jake', and 'Rattlesnake' is a title due to how common the name is, but this is just speculation.\n\nHe's likely just called 'Jake' when speaking directly to him-- the only time the title of 'Rattlesnake' would be necessary would be to reference him without context (again, due to how common 'Jake' is as a name).\n\nIt is possible that Rattlesnake Jake is actually a Mojave Rattlesnake, but it's impossible to know for sure-- especially considering their and Western Diamondback's coloration and patterns are nearly identical.\n\nIt is even more difficult to figure out since they both inhabit the Mojave Desert, where the movie takes place.\n\nHowever, it could be assumed that he is a Western Diamondback, due to the fact that the markings along his back are STRICTLY diamond-shaped.\n\nMojave rattlesnakes' back patterns are more polyhedral, not having the sharp points on the dorsal."
