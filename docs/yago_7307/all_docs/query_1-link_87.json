        "text": "THERE ARE FEW spectacles more chaotic than a UFC event. Flashing lights and pounding music wash over the parade of muscled-up fighters marching to beat their opponents into submission. Then there are lulls between the bouts as the Octagon is readied for the next match. The pageantry is put on pause, and the energy ebbs. In the rise and fall of action, it can be difficult to follow exactly what’s happening when you’re in the crowd. So imagine sitting in the cheap seats at UFC 285 in Las Vegas last March, then looking up to realize that the tattooed fighter flexing on the jumbotron isn’t listed on the undercard. Is that . . . Jake Gyllenhaal?\n\nYes, it was the indie heartthrob and Oscar-nominated actor, who is best known for his sensitive portrayal of a gay cowboy in 2005’s Brokeback Mountain and is also the face of a Prada campaign, in the chain-link Octagon plastered with Monster Energy logos. The spectators weren’t alone in their surprise. “I think I felt the same way that a lot of UFC fans felt,” Gyllenhaal tells me nearly a year later, laughing. “In fact, I know it. I was like, ‘What the fuck?’ ”\n\nGyllenhaal certainly looked the part. In videos shared widely on social media—and in photos snapped at the weigh-in earlier—his physique hits like a front kick to the gut. Six-pack is a woefully inadequate descriptor for Gyllenhaal’s abs: They jut out from his stomach, making it look like he’s wearing a bronze breastplate. The six-foot actor tipped the scales for the event’s middleweight division at 184 pounds, with 5 percent body fat, according to his longtime trainer, Jason Walsh.\n\nGyllenhaal was in the cage filming scenes for his latest movie, Road House (out March 21 on Prime Video), which has Raging Bull-meets-Reacher vibes. It’s a new version of the gloriously pulpy 1989 original, a fan favorite starring Patrick Swayze (and his feathered mullet) as James Dalton, a super-bouncer who cleans up a rowdy Missouri bar with rules (be nice), his fists, and a well-timed trachea removal. It’s the type of straightforward movie that isn’t often made anymore, without the winking references of modern action fare, throat rip and all, and it’s anchored by Swayze’s undeniable movie-star performance.\n\nSo why go to such extreme lengths now, at age 43, for a project that required him to whittle his body-fat percentage to the single digits? Especially when there’s the risk that a Road House remake could easily become a campy farce, and when so many remakes and legacyquels lean so hard into irony. For Gyllenhaal, the question was closer to why not step into Swayze’s beat-up cowboy boots. “This is so unlike me—I went, ‘I’m in. That sounds like the craziest idea,’ ” he recalls about discussing the role with director Doug Liman. “I remember being like, ‘Let’s do that!’ ” Even a guy who’s been so serious about his work—not only in his actual performances but with the types of roles he chooses, the type of persona he has created—sometimes just wants to kick some ass and have a little fun.\n\nThe original film raked in a respectable $30 million in the U. S. and Canada when it dropped in 1989 but had a major afterlife on cable.\n\nIt’s a potent image: Patrick Swayze radiating charisma (as Gyllenhaal says, “He’s like a higher frequency”) while leaning against the door of the titular establishment, beckoning you in for a raucous, dangerous good time. To his right, a triad of stills: a punch, a kiss, and an exploding car. Fights, sex, and fire—what could be cooler? When he was a bit older, Gyllenhaal encountered the film as countless others must have: in disconnected chunks replayed on cable television. Later, he became a fan of Swayze and watched Road House in full. He speaks of the ’80s icon affectionately—he remembers watching Dirty Dancing in theaters with his sister (actress Maggie Gyllenhaal) three times and shared a photo of himself on Instagram wearing a Swayze shirt to celebrate his 43rd birthday last year. He also counted Swayze as a friend and colleague from Donnie Darko. “I knew him to be one of the most generous, kind people that I have met,” says Gyllenhaal of the older actor, who died of pancreatic cancer in 2009, at age 57. “He was just funny and loving, and all throughout the years, we stayed in contact. If Patrick were around, I would have loved to be talking to him about this. He was a consummate artist, and he understood what it meant. I would hope that he would know that I have the utmost respect and love for him.”\n\nExercise helps Gyllenhaal do his job better. No matter what else I bring up—creating the character, other films he’s worked on—the conversation inevitably circles back to the topic of his training. He’s almost giddy to dive into the minutiae of different workout splits and macros and other fitness jargon. Gyllenhaal doesn’t need to get jacked to secure roles, but he sure as hell needed to do this. This is the side of him that Liman wanted to show the world—the actor’s ability to move and to use his body to create a singular character who could smash your face in one moment and charm you the next. Physicality comes so naturally to him because of the way he goes about his life outside his work, training four or five times per week all year. “I think there’s this conception that people just jump in, that they have six weeks to train and they try to get in shape,” Gyllenhaal says. “For me, it’s a lifestyle; it always has been since I was a kid.” As he tells it, his father, the director Stephen Gyllenhaal, raised him with physical fitness as a major focus, waking him up so they could run together. “The last block, he would always let me sprint; he would always let me win up the driveway.”\n\nThese habits stuck. “No matter what was going on in my day, no matter what was happening in my life, exercise always helped me get through in one way or another,” he says. And even if he’s not constantly breaking the Internet with ab photos, he considers training an essential part of all the work he wants to do, and not just for Road House. “I’m always trying to find roles that allow me to stay physical,” he says. “That means caring for not only doing my research and working hard intellectually but also taking care of the physical part of acting.” He takes issue with the idea that it’s socially acceptable for athletes to build up their bodies—or, in Gyllenhaal’s slightly sardonic deployment of drama-school language, their “instruments”—for competition but that actors should be judged when they do the same for their performances. For Gyllenhaal, it’s no different. “I want to try to do this for a long time,” he says.\n\n“Jake is probably at the top, as far as someone who already has a great foundation,” says Jason Walsh, who has also worked with Matt Damon, Miles Teller, and Bradley Cooper. Walsh trained Gyllenhaal ahead of the Road House shoot for eight months, then continued working through the three-month filming period. But the UFC sequence was filmed later—and when Gyllenhaal tested positive for Covid just before the initial planned shoot, it was pushed even further into the next year. Walsh is quick to clarify that his client wasn’t at his peak rippedness for the entire training period, or even the entire shoot—“people don’t see the valleys,” he notes, before explaining the powers of a spray tan and lighting in creating an onscreen physique—but that’s a long time to stay focused.\n\nThe pair used a progressive strength-training program split into phases. But one theme stayed consistent: Gyllenhaal loves cardio, both cycling and running, so much that at one point, Walsh had to force him to dial back his daily runs, allowing only a mile at a time. That wasn’t always the case, and both Walsh and fight coordinator Steve Brown recall Gyllenhaal leaving them in the dust on separate occasions when they joined him for a jog. “After mile two, I was like, ‘Dude, you should just go ahead—I am not keeping up with your pace,’ ” says Brown, a former collegiate wrestler. “He was running like a six-minute mile.”\n\nGyllenhaal took a different approach from what he’d done for previous roles. He’d worked with Walsh and other trainers before, but the Road House prep was more comprehensive. “I knew at this point that it takes a village,” he says. This led to the one aspect of the fitness plan that Gyllenhaal didn’t enjoy: his diet. As anyone with a solid six-pack can tell you, what you eat is just as important as the exercises you do. That was difficult for Gyllenhaal, who partnered with Ornella Sofitchouk, a registered dietitian on Walsh’s team, to figure out the right balance between high-protein meals and his favorite indulgences. “I love to cook—I believe it is a centerpiece in my life, the time around a table with my family and friends,” he says. He still had to eat a ton to gain muscle; he just couldn’t eat the foods he savors. The team had another challenge, too—after Gyllenhaal had digestive issues with standard whey protein, they developed a bespoke plant-based protein-powder mix so he could maintain his intake.\n\nGyllenhaal took a different direction for the reimagining while also leaning into old-school themes, mixing old and new. “It’s a real take on a classic western,” he says. “The thing I loved about it was that movies like Road House, they’re not made in the same way anymore. It’s bringing back these kinds of wonderful tropes that we all love, that give us motivation, where we have fun watching them. We just enjoy ourselves watching a movie.”\n\nDalton is the archetypal wandering hero called into action to dispense justice and defend the weak before receding back into the world when the job’s done. He wouldn’t be out of place blowing into town on a horse instead of a Greyhound bus—and the film acknowledges this dynamic in some of its strongest scenes, between Gyllenhaal and actress Hannah Love Lanier. He notes that lightheartedness hasn’t factored into all of his career choices. “I can only speak for myself when I say I haven’t always made movies where it makes you feel that enjoyment. It was really nice to be playing in a world that allowed for great fun.”\n\nDalton’s first fight scene is a kinetic blend of quick slaps, punches, and kicks as he dispatches an entire group of thugs, seemingly without expending much effort. It’s frighteningly efficient—but then, in keeping with Gyllenhaal’s aim to have fun, the character rounds up his opponents and drives them to the hospital. “I could be as stoic as I wanted because I knew in the end, the next moment, there was just going to be a whole lot of ass kicking, and four people were going to be making me look like I really did know how to kick ass,” Gyllenhaal says of Dalton and the stunt team responsible for the film’s intense brawls.\n\nRoad House also marks the film debut of MMA icon Conor McGregor as Knox, who careens around like the Tasmanian Devil, a heavily inked dervish of destruction who can only be held off for brief moments, never stopped. His presence is a reminder of how destructive Dalton himself would be without his stolid control, the chaotic evil to the protagonist’s neutral good. This is apparent even in the ways the two first appear onscreen—while Dalton is introduced with abs, Knox makes his entrance with ass, in a backside-baring sequence that ends with an entire Italian street bazaar in flames.\n\nThere are some outlandish action-movie moments, and McGregor chews the scenery like the gator that saves Dalton by munching on a henchman. (Yes, that actually happens.) But the respect Gyllenhaal has for the relationships at the heart of the film prevents it from being anything other than earnest, with real-world stakes. The movie plays much differently from most modern action blockbusters, in which the hero has to save the world in the final act. Dalton just has to save the bar—and that’s better in Gyllenhaal’s book. “I don’t know much about the world-saving thing,” he says. “I’ve always tried to do the human stories.”"
