        "text": "Welcome to today’s quote of the week. As I was looking up information about Andrew Lane for yesterday’s author profile post (which you can find here: https://concerningwriting.wordpress.com/2014/04/01/author-profile-andrew-lane/) I stumbled across a quote from him where he gives his #1 writing tip. So, in following yesterday’s theme, today’s quote comes from Andrew Lane, author of the young Sherlock Holmes series! 🙂\n\n“Read lots of stuff. You need to do that for two reasons – firstly so that you can see what’s already been done (you don’t want to spend three years writing about a teenage wizard at a boarding school only to find out that J.K.Rowling got there first) and secondly because you’ll find some really badly written books out there and you’ll think to yourself ‘I can do better than that’ – which is the first step towards actually trying to do better than that.” – Andrew Lane\n\n~ Kayla\n\nI’m sure all my readers know how much I love to write fanfiction. I write fanfiction for The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, Sherlock Holmes, Star Trek, and even Owl City. Sometimes, I’d rather work on my newest fanfiction idea than work on my current novel. Alas, one can’t make a living from writing fanfiction. Well, at least that was what I used to think. One author, however, has made a career out of being a fan. Andrew Lane is the author of what could be called a Sherlock Holmes “fan” series, the Young Sherlock Holmes books. He’s also written some other fan works, such as several spin-off novels for BBC’s TV show Doctor Who and a collection of books on James Bond.\n\nHe first knew he wanted to be a writer when he was ten. In an interview I watched on YouTube from MyKindaBook (clip at the bottom of the post), Mr. Lane tells how he read a short story about the Daleks in Doctor Who. When he read that story, something clicked in his ten-year-old mind. It was that story that made him realize that “real people actually write books” and that “since I was a person, therefore, I could be a writer.” From that point onwards, Mr. Lane knew what he wanted to be: a writer.\n\nIt was another childhood experience that made Mr. Lane a life-long Sherlock Holmes fan. He said in an interview that the first book he bought “with his own pocket money” was the Sherlock Holmes story, A Study in Scarlet. He described the book saying that, “It didn’t look particularly exciting. It didn’t have a cover on it. It was just like a hardback, orange, battered, pages slightly torn.” Something about the story drew him in though, and Mr. Lane became a Holmes fan from that moment forward.\n\nYears later, Mr. Lane was approached by his agent. Mr. Lane’s agent had been working with the Doyle family, and had mentioned the idea to them of having a young adult Sherlock Holmes series. It was an idea that the family approved of. In an interview with The Book Zone (link at the bottom) Mr. Lane said that, “Having got their blessing, he then came to me because he knew I loved the originals and that I’d always wanted to write a ‘real’ Sherlock Holmes novel.” He spent the next three months creating the first couple chapters in order to pitch it to the family. They agreed and the series was born! Today, Mr. Lane currently has written six Young Sherlock Holmes books as well as releasing a series based on another Doyle work, The Lost World. He really has made a living being a fan! That might be one of the best jobs ever. 🙂\n\nI’ve read two books in the Young Sherlock Holmes series, and I loved them! I wrote a review on book three in the Young Sherlock Holmes series, Black Ice. If you’d like to read it, you can find it here: https://concerningwriting.wordpress.com/2014/03/18/book-review-black-ice-by-andrew-lane/#comments\n\nAndrew Lane’s website is here: http://youngsherlock.com/\n\nHere is the written interview I quoted: http://bookzone4boys.blogspot.com/2010/06/interview-with-andrew-lane-author-of.html\n\nHere is the interview I watched. It’s a bit long, but really enjoyable (especially getting to listen to his British accent! 🙂 ). I could relate to his characters doing things he never expected them to do!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n~ Kayla\n\n“Why isn’t there someone who can investigate things that the police won’t or can’t investigate? Some kind of independent consulting force of detectives who can set things straight …” So questions a teenage Sherlock Holmes as he tries to free his brother from jail. With references like this and a solid mystery that can only be solved through deductive reasoning, it is apparent why Black Ice by Andrew Lane is the first teen series endorsed by the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Estate. Black Ice is impressive and enjoyable with a well-researched and well-developed young Sherlock Holmes.\n\nIn Black Ice, a teenage Sherlock Holmes travels to London with his friend and tutor, Amyus Crowe, to visit his brother. Unfortunately, instead of having lunch with Mycroft, they find him locked in a room with a dead body and holding a knife. Mycroft claims he’s innocent, and Sherlock knows his brother didn’t do anything wrong. Together with Crowe, Sherlock must solve the mystery to clear his brother’s name. Along the way Amyus Crowe teaches Sherlock how to make correct observations and deductions.\n\nBad things can happen to characters when people try to recreate them as children or teens. It can really detract from their future adult character. Anakin Skywalker is a good example, in my opinion. Darth Vader was a lot less impressive and scary to me after seeing whiny Anakin. So I was hesitant when I picked this book off the library shelf. Would this change the way I viewed the adult Sherlock? Well, it did but in a good way. It actually made me understand Doyle’s detective a bit more. I was very appreciative of Andrew Lane’s efforts to maintain the Sherlock Holmes canon and character.\n\nI thought the book was slow in the beginning, and it took a bit for me to get into it. After Sherlock travelled to London and found the knife-wielding Mycroft, the book definitely picked up, and from then on, it was non-stop action. I really loved Mr. Lane’s teenage Sherlock. The Sherlock of this story wasn’t a genius at solving mysteries. While he obviously had a leaning towards the detailed observation and mystery solving skills of his adult self, he made mistakes in his deductions. He was also less logical and in control and more emotional than the adult Sherlock. I could really see this character growing up to be the Mr. Sherlock Holmes of 221B Baker Street.\n\nThis book is the third in Mr. Lane’s series, which I didn’t know at the time I chose it. Black Ice made a few references to previous adventures Sherlock had, leaving me rather confused since I hadn’t read the other books. I ordered them from the library, and now they’re waiting to be read. I suggest reading them in order: Death Cloud, Rebel Fire, Black Ice, Fire Storm 😉\n\nOverall, Black Ice was a great mystery and story that allowed me to see what the world’s only consulting detective was like when he was my age. 🙂\n\n~ Kayla"
