        "text": "When video stores were scattered across the country they all shared one major problem: how to keep the shelves filled with enough copies of the hits as well as other films to appease their customers. Some movie companies rose to the occasion and began producing films made for the direct-to-video market. On occasion these films would be shown on the big screen in major markets but it wasn't long before they were on the shelf.\n\nRoger Corman was a visionary in many ways and the home video market was one of them. For pennies on the dollar he could make or purchase movies and place them under one of several banners he had like New World Pictures, New Concorde, Millennium and more. In 1986 he released the film JAKE SPEED under New World Pictures.\n\nAttempting to capture the essence of the Indiana Jones and other adventure films the movie tells the story of a young girl named Maureen Winston (Becca C. Ashley) who is kidnapped by white slaves off the streets of Paris. When the police can't see to find any clues to find the girl, her grandfather suggest they seek the help of Jake Speed. The family blows him off since Jake Speed is a fictional character out of one of the many adventure novels grandpa reads. Or is he?\n\nMaureen's sister Margaret (Karen Koppis) travels to Paris and receives a mysterious note to meet Jake and his sidekick, Desmond Floyd (Dennis Christopher). She learns that his adventures are actually real and done so for the thrill of it all and to have a new book ready with each adventure. She tells him her problem and the next thing you know all three are headed to Africa where Jake assures her the white slavers have taken her sister.\n\nThe movie becomes a weak comedy of errors after this with the trio finding themselves in a war torn country in search of the bad guy. Late in the film he finally makes and appearance in the form of Jake's arch enemy, an evil and perverted Englishman named Sid (John Hurt). This character is played for laughs which don't seem to quite make it.\n\nAll in all the movie isn't as terrible as some I've seen but it's not one I would rush to find. This doesn't mean that there aren't people out there who long to see the film or add it to their collection. No doubt there are many who were young during those video store days who recall the film and for whom it brings back fond memories.\n\nFor me it's just a display of an actor in search of something he can call his own. Wayne Crawford, who stars as Jake, co-wrote the screenplay with director Andrew Lane as well as produced the film. The extras on hand here discuss the fact that he was hoping to use the role to catapult his career. Sadly, or fortunately depending on your point of view, that never really happened and the film became one of those lost mom and pop video treasures.\n\nUntil Arrow Video decided it was worth saving from oblivion, something they do quite well and making them the savior of those old video store patrons everywhere. They are releasing the film on blu-ray featuring a new 2K restoration of the film from the original 35mm interpositive. In addition to that there are a few extras they were able to find including \"Paperback Wishes, Cinematic Dreams\" a new interview with Lane, \"The Hard Way Reads Better\" and interview with producer William Fay and featuring a reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Graham Humphreys.\n\nIf you have fond memories of this film or are a die-hard collector of films released through one of the many companies founded by Roger Corman then this is something you'll want to add to your collection. If you want to watch a movie with a decent story and solid follow through it might be worth the rental. And if you support the efforts of Arrow then by all means pick this one up."
