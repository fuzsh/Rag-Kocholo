        "text": "When I saw Eggy was returning to Memphis for the second time in 2023, I knew the opportunity to answer a couple of questions I’ve been pondering about the band was afoot. My biggest area of curiosity? What was the connection, spark, and/or commonality that’s created the energy to self-propel the Connecticut quartet down the jam band road they’ve been traveling? You can make the case the band is in its infancy, but the quality and quantity of their music suggests otherwise.\n\nSure, the band has released only one album 2019’s Watercolor Days. But “album releases” isn’t the grading scale Eggy is using. The band follows the modern day marketing version of one of their many influences… the Grateful Dead. Use all areas of social media to get as much live music out there for the masses. While there is only one Eggy studio album, there are hundreds of hours of high quality live recordings and videos for their rapidly growing audience to digest.\n\nI had briefly crossed paths with Eggy at the All In festival in Indiana in September. There was a unique bond between the band, Jake Brownstein (guitar), Dani Battat (piano/keyboard), Mike Goodman (bass), and Alex Bailey (drums) that seemed different. These guys were communicating with one another on a different level. Once I saw Eggy was headed to my hometown Memphis, I immediately reached out to schedule an interview with the hopes of finding out first-hand the answer to my lingering Eggy questions.\n\nAmazingly, it wasn’t my weeks of a Titanic deep dive into all things Eggy, a thirty minute pre-show interview with Battat, or the band’s almost two hour flame throwing set at Railgarten that answered my question. The answer became crystal clear in a forty-five second exchange between the band members during soundcheck. It was as simple as it was beautiful. To fully appreciate the moment, takes a bit of a rewind.\n\nAs I waited to head to Railgarten with plans to interview Brownstein, I got a text from the band’s manager saying he was under the weather. So much so, he begrudgingly was forced to sit out the previous night’s show in Fayetteville. No worries on my end. I knew Dani, Mike or Alex could shine a light on my question about what this force was propelling the band. How did they avoid the covid pothole and come out on the other side even stronger? With no hesitation or reservation Dani stepped up and volunteered to fill in. Allowing Brownstein some much needed time to heal and rest up for the night’s festivities.\n\nBattat and I headed out into the vast expanse of Railgarten trying to find a quiet spot to chat. The middle of the somewhat out of place beach volleyball court seemed like a cool idea. Unfortunately, we were overpowered by tour partner Daniel Donato’s soundcheck.\n\nAfter settling into a spot in the back, Battat’s brown eyes show the effects of playing around 300 concerts over the last three years. He was as spent as he was thrilled about the last couple of weeks on the road with Donato and his band. Or as Battat now refers to them, “friends for life.”\n\nWhile Battat gets settled and adjusts to the last second substitution, we quickly bond over our mutual deep, deep love of Bruce Hornsby. Another major influence of the entire band. Battat’s eyes come to life as he quickly puts a Hornsby sit in towards the top of his Eggy bucket list. Another is an Eggy fest. With the ice broken, the interview easily shifts into a friendly and wide ranging conversation.\n\nBattat points to the commitment of moving in together with an equally shared focus on their music as a major bookmark in the band’s development. Each member utilizes their non-musical strengths offstage for the greater good of the whole. Battat handles the video side of their releases, and praises drummer Alex Bailey for the loads of pristine live audio recordings that’s brought their music directly to their fans.\n\nAnother universally shared desire for Eggy is the success of their musical friends and peers. Eggy has spent the last several weeks traveling the roads with Daniel Donato and his band. Members of both groups have frequently shared the stage with the other’s band. Battat reflects on the last couple of weeks stating, “We’ve made great friends for life with Daniel and his band. We’ve talked about how we look forward to remembering this tour at some music fest in 2060.” Battat is completely sincere stating, “There’s no competition with any other bands. We want everyone to succeed.”\n\nWith the sun setting on a pleasantly warm December Memphis evening, the conversation shifts to 2024. Most importantly, Eggy’s second album which should be released next spring. Battat reflects on the three weeks they meticulously spent recording in Pasadena, “Everything on the album is layered. I don’t think there was ever a point where all of us were in the recording studio at the same time.”\n\nBattat says the songs on their sophomore effort hadn’t found much form in their live shows before taking them into the studio. A different approach to the jam band norm. After mentioning his touring partner Donato was adamant the songs on his latest album Reflector found life on the road before the studio he chuckles and responds “Well, I guess we did it the other way than Daniel.”\n\nA half hour into our conversation, Battat is summoned to the stage for soundcheck. Still early enough in the game, the band happily sets everything up themselves. Seamlessly swapping spots on stage with Donato’s gear. The answer to Eggy’s mojo is close.\n\nAs everyone gets their instruments plugged in, tuned up and ready to go, Goodman joins the Hornsby mutual admiration society. We quickly go back and forth through a shared list of musicians we love that influenced Hornsby. Keith Jarrett, McCoy Tyner, Chick Corea and Elton John (the source of many Eggy covers). The conversation shifts to the Westville Music Bowl in New Haven, the home base of the band, Bailey joins in as the band runs through a long and impressive list of concerts they’ve seen there.\n\nBrownstein heads towards the stage in the empty venue and it’s obvious he’s been under the weather. After insisting he’s better, Brownstein plugs in for soundcheck and it’s go time.\n\nThe band finds a groove during soundcheck that quickly morphs into Deep Purple’s Hush. There are fewer than ten people (including the band) in the room, but they get so lost in the music, they seem to have forgotten to work their way back to the lyrics and come to a stop. The next minute is the perfect example of, “Once in a while, you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right.” The ingredients of the band’s magical bond become obvious listening to them discuss some minor changes before delving back into Hush.\n\nIt’s not the words the band used, “Let’s add four beats here.” “Let’s come into the vocals earlier.” Those are commonplace. It’s the way each member communicated and interacted with one another that showed me the true heart of Eggy. Goodman was trying to explain something technical. It was nothing of any importance. The tone of his voice while he explained things combined with the eye contact, respect, and openness to change from his three teammates answered any question I ever had about the band. These guys had a gig almost every night for the last three weeks. With one sick member and three dead tired at best, to be able put everything else on the backburner to get the music correct was impressive.\n\nIt’s clear Bailey, Battat, Brownstein, and Goodman are operating as a team. They don’t have individual goals. It’s team Eggy or nothing. That became even more evident when the four stopped to reflect for a moment and had a group hug before walking on stage. These guys get it. Which is more impressive considering this is their first real crack at a band. Their battle scars are fresh. They’re learning on the fly, and consistently getting it right.\n\nThe music and energy Eggy created at Railgarten was far beyond a band with one “album release.” Any off-stage distractions remained off stage. They were completely focused on the moment. Brownstein took full advantage of the extra rest. He was dialed in, leading the band in numerous musical directions at warp speed. Highlighted when Donato joined in for a cover of Loggins and Messina’s Nobody but You.\n\nAs Donato tore through his set, I looked around the venue. Over in the corner watching with as much respect as they gave each other during soundcheck were the members of Eggy. They could have literally been halfway to the next night’s show in Atlanta, but apparently, that’s not Eggy.\n\nIt did give Battat, Goodman, and I one last chance to talk about Bruce Hornsby. Their eyes lit up again when I mentioned Harbor Lights. They remembered the band learning the song but haven’t played it live yet. If they do, you know where the idea came from. As I left Railgarten, I bumped into Brownstein and asked him a new question on my mind. If you play that good sick, what is it like when you’re healthy? I told him I’d catch him in Little Rock and Oxford next February to answer that one.\n\nEggy Railgarten Memphis TN 12/13/23\n\nSmile, You – Nearly Always Late, Hush – Backyard Bear, Nobody but You"
