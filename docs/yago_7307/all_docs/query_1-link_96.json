        "text": "Before the sprint begins, you've got to do some prep work. You need to have a big important challengeâsomething that's worth five days of focused work. You need to recruit a team with diverse skills. And, of course, you need to find the right room and get the right materials.\n\nð Sprint pages 21-48\n\nð¥ï¸ Miro Template with Video Guide\n\nð Checklist\n\nâ\n\nð¬ Video\n\nðSprint Room Setup\n\nâ\n\nâð Sprint Supplies\n\nðHow to Run a Remote Sprint\n\nâ\n\nð The Facilitator's Handbook\n\nOf course, you may need to sell the idea of running a Design Sprint in the first place. If that's the case, try sharing a quick overview of the process with the 90 second video, \"Stop Brainstorming\" post, and/or this page you're looking at right now.\n\nYou also might help the team experience a structured meeting with a 30-60 minute Lightning Decision Jam exercise. It's a great way to give teams a taste of the Design Sprint process before the full commitment.\n\nOr you could just drop some names: In addition to Google, Design Sprints have been run by teams at Slack, Uber, Airbnb, Medium, Dropbox, Facebook, McKinsey, IDEO, LEGO, the United Nations, the New York Times, and many, many more.\n\nMost importantly, get timing and tone right. Make sure the team is starting a big challenge and it's an opportune moment to sprint. And offer the Design Sprint as a way to be helpful with solving that challenge. If the timing isn't right, don't force it. If you're patient and helpful, the time will come.\n\nMonday is a series of structured conversations to build a foundationâand a focusâfor the sprint week. The structure allows the team to \"boot up\" as much information as quickly as possible, while preventing the usual meandering conversations.\n\nIn the morning, youâll define key questions and a long-term goal. Next, youâll make a simple map of your product or service. In the afternoon, youâll ask the experts on your team to share what they know. Finally, youâll pick a target: the moment on the map that represents the greatest risk and/or opportunity.\n\nð Sprint pages 51-91\n\nð Checklist\n\nð¬ Video\n\nð¥ Slide Deck in PDF, Keynote, or PowerPoint\n\nð The Note-N-Mapâ\n\nð¬ Map Tutorial by AJ&Smart\n\nBy Wednesday morning, you and your team will have a stack of solutions. Now, you have to decide which of those sketches should be prototyped and tested.\n\nInstead of an endless debate or a watered-down group decision nobody's happy with, you'll use the five-step \"Sticky Decision\" method to identify the best solutions before turning the final decision over to your Decider. Then, in the afternoon, youâll take the winning scenes from your sketches and combine them into a storyboard: a step-by-step plan for your prototype.\n\nð Sprint pages 125-160\n\nð Checklist\n\nâð¬ Video\n\nð Storyboarding 2.0\n\nOn Thursday, you'll build a realistic prototype of the solutions in your storyboard so you can simulate a finished product for your customers. Design Sprint prototyping is all about a \"fake it till you make it\" philosophy: With a realistic-looking prototype, you'll get the best possible data from Friday's test, and you'll learn whether you're on the right track.\n\nð Sprint pages 163-190\n\nð Checklist\n\nâð¬ Video\n\nâð Tools: Marvel, InVision, Figma, Keynote, Keynotopia\n\nIt's time to put that prototype to the test! On Friday, you'll show your prototype to five customers in five separate, 1:1 interviews. Instead of waiting for a launch to get perfect data, you'll quick-and-dirty answers to your most pressing questions right away.\n\nð Sprint pages 193-225\n\nð Checklistâ\n\nð¬ Video\n\nð The GVÂ Research Sprint\n\nâð¬ The Five-Act Interview with Michael Margolis"
