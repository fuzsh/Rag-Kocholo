What an incredible day for California AND for equality."[212] Lovato later said: "I believe in gay marriage, I believe in equality. I think there's a lot of hypocrisy with religion. But I just found that you can have your own relationship with God, and I still have a lot of faith."[213] In an early November 2013 interview with Latina magazine, she said that she finds spirituality to be an important part of maintaining balance in life. She said: "I'm the closest I've ever been with God. I have my own relationship with God and that's all that matters".[214]
