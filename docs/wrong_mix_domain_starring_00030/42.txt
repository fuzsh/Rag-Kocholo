Demi Lovato took a walk down memory lane and revisited one of their most iconic film roles to date: aspiring singer Mitchie Torres in the 2008 Disney Channel Original Movie Camp Rock.

Demi let fans in on the fun during their rewatch on Saturday, July 11 by documenting the whole thing on Instagram Stories, showcasing a few pivotal scenes and providing commentary and LOLs throughout. They even compared their younger self to their sister, Madison de la Garza, saying that when they watch Camp Rock now, all they see is their similarities.

While Demi mostly giggled at how “awkward” the movie was, complete with lots of cry-laughing emojis, they also pointed out that “Our Time is Here” is a completely underrated bop in the Camp Rock canon — and they're 100% right. “This sh*t slaps, not gonna lie,” Demi wrote as they viewed the song in its anthemic glory.

Demi’s boyfriend, actor Max Ehrich, enjoyed the revisit alongside their girlfriend and also posted a few Stories about the experience. But it looks like Camp Rock wasn’t the only old project the couple watched together on Saturday; Max shared that Demi wanted to check out his former CBS series Under the Dome earlier in the day.

Fans were (obviously) thrilled by Demi’s throwback moment. “Demi Lovato rewatching Camp Rock is everything I needed,” tweeted one. “CAN WE TALK ABOUT DEMI LOVATO REACTING TO CAMP ROCK IN 2020? LMAO,” wrote another Twitter user. “Demi watching Camp Rock and posting about it on IG is all I’ve ever wanted in life and more,” shared another fan, taking the words out of our mouths entirely.

It’s been 12 years since Camp Rock debuted on the Disney Channel, but the movie (and its sequel!) remain beloved classics, and it sure looks like Demi enjoyed every “awkward” minute of their revisit. In fact, we had so much fun seeing it through their eyes that we may be due for a rewatch ourselves!
