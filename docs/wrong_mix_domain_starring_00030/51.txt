Demetria Devonne "Demi" Lovato is an American actress and singer-songwriter, who made her debut in the 2007 Disney Channel short series As the Bell Rings. She later rose to international stardom following her starring role in the 2008 Disney Channel Original Movie Camp Rock.

Lovato is good friends with the Jonas Brothers (who also debuted in Camp Rock and Camp Rock 2), and dated Joe Jonas for a time in 2010. She toured with them in 2008 and 2010 and appeared in their concert movie Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience. She also co-produced their first album Don't Forget, and wrote and co-wrote several of the album's songs. She auditioned for a role in their television series Jonas, but did not get the part. On July 18, 2012, Nick Jonas joined them in Los Angeles on stage at the Greek Theatre during their Summer Tour 2012, and performed the songs "Don't Forget" and "Catch Me" with them.

In October 2010, Lovato punched a background dancer on the Jonas Brothers tour, and in November she checked herself into a treatment center dealing with physical issues and an eating disorder. In 2011, she released an album called Unbroken, about her struggles.

Lovato starred in her only Disney Channel Original Series as Allison "Sonny" Munroe in Sonny with a Chance. In 2011, she departed from the show.

Lovato began working with Disney again in 2013 to perform the pop version of "Let It Go" for the animated feature film Frozen.

Her song "Confident" appeared in the international trailer for Spider-Man: Homecoming. She also recorded the song "I Believe" for A Wrinkle in Time.

Outside of Disney, Lovato is well-known for her recurring role as Angela in the PBS children's television series Barney & Friends. She also played Hayley May in Grey's Anatomy and Dani in season 5 of the Fox series Glee. Additionally, she voiced Smurfette in the 2017 Sony Pictures film Smurfs: The Lost Village and Lenore Quinonez in the 2018 computer-animated musical comedy film Charming. She also played Katiana Lindsdóttir in the 2020 Netflix musical comedy film Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga.
