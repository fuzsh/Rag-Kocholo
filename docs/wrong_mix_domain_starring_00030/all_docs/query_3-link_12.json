        "text": "She’s been confident for a long time.\n\nDemi Lovato is an amazing singer, killer dancer, and seems like she’s constantly on tour with one or more of the artists formerly known as the Jonas Brothers — AKA, she’s living the dream. However, there was once a time when she was more focused on acting than singing. Perhaps that’s how she got to be so…confident? Corny jokes aside, she’s acted alongside the world’s favorite purple dinosaur, costarred with Selena Gomez, and has even played herself once or twice in some magical cameos. In honor of her varied and long running on-screen career, we’re giving a shout out to the nine best Demi Lovato roles that you might have totally forgotten about."
