She went from being a sweet Disney star to a controversial Hollywood celeb. It looked like she'd be another tragic statistic in Hollywood's dark history. However, she soon made a triumphant comeback and hasnât looked back. She released numerous chart-topping singles and record-breaking albums. Sheâs starred in several Disney series and continues to land acting gigs. She faced many personal demons but was able to overcome her struggles. In the last several years, she became heavily involved with numerous charities and causes.\n\nDemi Lovato has been in the middle of controversy on more than one occasion. There was a point when it seemed like it followed her around. To be fair, there were times that she was stirring up trouble but other times she was just being honest. She has an intensely loyal fanbase that will always stick with her. She is now more mature and responsible with her choices but still happens to get into trouble from time to time. Here is a look at 15 Of The Most Questionable Things Demi Lovato Has Ever Done.\n\nDemi's Multiple Twitter Feuds\n\nDemi Lovato is very outspoken and vocal on social media. She is never afraid to say whatâs on her mind but it tends to lead to confrontation. Lovato has been in many Twitter feuds with other celebs. In 2016, she feuded with celebrity blogger Perez Hilton and later that month, feuded with Mariah Carey. Carey has a diva-licious way of handling the celebs she doesn't like; she just \"doesn't know them\". This feud actually resulted in Lovato briefly quitting twitter. In 2017, she mocked comedian Kathy Griffin for her emotional response following the backlash to a Donald Trump joke she had made. Lovato and Griffin had actually gone back and forth insulting each other for the last few years. It seems that Lovato canât stay out of trouble online but it doesnât seem to bother her.\n\nDemi's Going In A Different Direction\n\nDemi is known for being very blunt and honest, which sometimes gets her into trouble. However, this time it really wasnât her fault. Well, not entirely her fault. Demi Lovato released a plethora of popular albums, including Donât Forget, Here We Go Again and Tell Me You Love Me. She has collaborated with several well-known artists, such as The Jonas Brothers, DJ Khaled and Wiz Khalifa. In 2014, she stirred up some controversy when she mentioned the artists she doesnât want to work with. She angered One Direction fans when she noted she wouldnât want to collaborate with them. She said,\n\n\"I focus more on collaborations with people who inspire meâ¦ nothing wrong with One Direction.\"\n\nShe received a lot of backlash from their fans but defended herself. She admits they make good music but just didn't feel it was a good fit.\n\nCamp Steam\n\nIn 2008, Demi Lovato had her first big breakthrough with her starring role as Mitchie Torres in the Disney Channel movie Camp Rock and its sequel Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam. She starred alongside The Jonas Brothers and would soon become an international phenomenon. In 2012, she created a great deal of controversy when racy pics were leaked online. She appeared solo and with her Camp Rock co-stars in the steamy set of photos.\n\nThe pics had everyone buzzing and talking about the then-teen star.\n\nShe posed wearing only a bra and jeans in several seductive pics. Lovato didnât seem to have any real issues with the leaks considering she would proudly show off more in the future.\n\nFrom True Friendship To Acquaintances\n\nMiley Cyrus and Demi Lovato both became major Disney Channel stars and went on to become controversial pop stars. Throughout their careers they have both thrown some serious shade at each other. In 2008, Lovato posted a video to YouTube showing off her recently fixed teeth by having a gap removed. In response, Cyrus posted a video making fun of Lovato and mocked her teeth. Cyrus removed the video and apologized although the damage had been done. Later,\n\nCyrus posted a pic with Lovato and the caption ânow this is what true friendship looks like.â However, Lovato coldly responded, \"Yeahâ¦It's just kind of hard to miss somebody that I don't know anymore.\"\n\nLater, Lovato noted that they donât have anything in common and are more like acquaintances. Miley responded with the ultimate insult of unfollowing Lovato on twitter.\n\nDemi, Nicki and Instagram\n\nIn 2016, Demi Lovato attended her first ever Met Gala and accompanied the designer of her silver sequinned Moschino dress, Jeremy Scott. Nicki Minaj also accompanied Scott wearing one of his designs. The next day, Minaj posted a pic of the three to Instagram but failed to tag Lovato. Lovato seemed slightly bothered not to be tagged. She posted a pic to her Instagram of Minaj giving her side eye on the red carpet.\n\nShe wrote, \"This picture pretty much summed up my first and probably last met.\"\n\nLovato noted she was laughing at herself for being awkward and \"the shade being thrown in this picture actually gives me life.\" Later, she posted a distorted selfie with the caption, \"When you spend all day trying to figure out why you didnât get tagged on the pic.\"\n\n$10,000 VIP Packages And Concert Tickets Sold Separately\n\nEvery fan dreams of the day they can purchase a ticket to their favourite musician's concert. Most of the time that is all fans can afford but theyâd love the chance to meet their musical hero and get an autograph too. Demi Lovato offered a lot more than just a chance to meet her but left out one very important detail. In 2015, Lovato and Nick Jonas were on their Future Now Tour and offered some impressive VIP packages.\n\nThe Ultimate VIP Dressing Room package cost an astonishing $10,000 and included access to a stage-side lounge, a private dressing room, autographed merchandise, dinner and a visit and photo session with both stars.\n\nHowever, fans were outraged to discover that the expensive package did not even include a ticket to the concert itself and had to be purchased separately.\n\nBarbie Dolls\n\nDemi Lovato has been very open and honest about her struggles with an eating disorder. In 2013, she criticized Disney for allowing an eating disorder joke on their series Shake It Up, which starred Zendaya. Lovato tweeted, \"And is it just me or are the actress' getting THINNER AND THINNERâ¦. I miss the days of RAVEN, and LIZZIE MCGUIREâ¦Dear Disney Channel, EATING DISORDERS ARE NOT SOMETHING TO JOKE ABOUT.\"\n\nZendayaâs father criticized Lovato for attacking his daughter for being skinny and noted she looked up to Lovato. Lovato texted an apology to Zendaya but admitted she might not have the right number.\n\nIn 2015, news broke that Barbie made a doll using Zendayaâs likeness. Instead of congratulating the young actress, Lovato tweeted, \"Hey @Barbie, what about a curvy doll or one with true to size measurements? I'll model!\"\n\nMore Photos\n\nDemi Lovato has become heavily involved in several charities and causes. She travels all over the world helping the less fortunate. She is a strong supporter of LGBTQ rights and even won the GLAAD Vanguard Award. She supports anti-bullying campaigns and works closely with Mean Stinks. She is actively involved with substance abuse and mental awareness programs. Despite all her tremendous work, the media is often fixated on her relationships. She caused a minor stir when she started dating Joe Jonas mostly because she had referred to him as a brother. She dated actor Wilmer Valderrama from 2010 to 2016. There was a significant age difference between the stars. There was a bit of controversy when racy pics of the couple surfaced online.\n\nRuin The Friendship\n\nFor most of her career, Demi Lovato has been closely associated with The Jonas Brothers. There has always been a great deal of speculation when it comes to Lovato and Nick Jonas. Theyâve always claimed to be just friends but rumours have swirled that theyâre more. The rumours intensified with the release of Lovatoâs single \"Ruin The Friendship.\" Fans believed that the song was about her \"friendship\" with Nick. Later,\n\nLovato became somewhat involved in Nickâs relationship with model Olivia Culpo and might have had something to do with the break-up.\n\nLovato said, \"I go, 'Honestly, I didn't like her anyway.' It's not because she's mean or anything, but he has such a great sense of humour and I want him to be with someone that makes him laugh.\"\n\nDemi Lovato Vs Taylor Swift\n\nDemi Lovato is not one to shy away from controversy and is never afraid to speak her mind, no matter how much trouble she gets in. Itâs no secret that Lovato is not a huge fan of fellow pop star Taylor Swift. Lovato has criticized Taylor and her squad of friends on several occasions. Lovato once said \"I donât have anybody around me who kisses my (expletive).\"\n\nShe criticized the music video for \"Bad Blood\" and the Swift squad for promoting a \"false image of what people should look like.\"\n\nShe also takes issue with Taylor calling herself a \"feminist\". Lovato said, \"Don't brand yourself a feminist if you don't do the work.â She added, \"I have an immense amount of respect for women like Lena Dunhamâ¦ or BeyoncÃ©, who make amazing political statements through their work.\"\n\nWill They Or Won't They?\n\nSelena Gomez and Demi Lovato both started their careers at the young age of 7. In 2002, both future stars were cast in the childrenâs television program Barney and Friends. It was the beginning of their careers and rocky friendship. Reportedly, it was Gomez that got Lovato an audition for Camp Rock. However, theyâve had a very on-again, off-again friendship. In 2009, they co-starred in the Disney film Princess Protection Program. However, they soon started to grow far apart from each other.\n\nIn 2010, Lovato caused quite the buzz when asked about Gomez and replied \"Ask Taylor (Swift)\".\n\nThe former best friends briefly reconciled when Gomez called Lovato while she was in rehab. In 2014, fans were shocked when Lovato unfollowed Gomez on Twitter, which caused quite the uproar. However, by 2017 they were once again friends and more importantly, following each other on Twitter.\n\nDemi's Not Impressed\n\nIn 2016, Demi Lovato was very supportive of Kesha during her legal battle with Dr. Luke. However, Lovato ended up having some more unkind words for Taylor Swift. After Swift donated $250,000 to cover Keshaâs court costs,\n\nLovato tweeted, \"Take Something to Capitol Hill or actually speak out about something and then Iâll be impressed.\"\n\nLovato was accused of making the situation about herself but she defended her comments and denied the feud with Swift. She said, \"I just give more (expletive) than other people and would rather start a dialogue ABOUT WOMEN COMING FORWARD ABOUT BEING R**** than throw money at one person. Didn't shade Taylor.\" She added, \"I'm just tired of seeing women use 'women empowerment' and 'feminism' to further brands without actually being the ones that have the uncomfortable conversations.\"\n\nSorry Not Sorry\n\nDemi Lovato never bites her tongue when she has something to say. On a few occasions she did apologize but if Taylor Swift is involved she likely wonât. After being heavily critical of Taylor and her Swift Squad, Lovato received a great deal of backlash. However,\n\nshe said, \"Still not apologizing for saying what everyone else wants to say.\"\n\nLater, she slightly modified her comments about Swift donating to Keshaâs court battle but didnât apologize. She tweeted, \"As most people know, I tend to get fired up about the things I believe in, and although my heart and intentions are always in the right place, unfortunately sometimes my passion gets the best of me and causes me to say things that I probably shouldn't say.\" She added, \"Everyone has their own way of giving support to others, and at the end of the day, helping victims is all that matters.\"\n\nPunched A Back Up Dancer\n\nIn 2010, Demi Lovato was on the verge of becoming a major celebrity. She was one of Disneyâs most recognizable stars and had a squeaky-clean image. However, she was struggling in her personal life with depression, bulimia, self-harm and addiction. During a tour with The Jonas Brothers, Lovato was involved in an altercation with back-up dancer Alex Welch. Rumours suggest that Welch had reported Lovatoâs use of Adderall to the tour manager. Lovato found out and punched Welch on an airplane giving her a black eye. Days later, an 18 year old Lovato entered a treatment facility for the first time. She has struggled over the years with her personal issues and sobriety but has been able to clean herself up. Welch and Lovato went to court but came to a settlement with proceeds going to charity. Lovato has since apologized to Welch.\n\nStay Strong\n\nDemiâs struggle with substance abuse is well documented. After her first stint in rehab she continued to use. In the 2017 documentary, Demi Lovato: Simply Complicated, she admitted to still using while promoting her 2012 sobriety campaign, Stay Strong. She said, \"I wasn't working my program, I wasn't ready to get sober.\" She admitted to drinking heavily the night before her performance on American Idol. She was severely hung over during the performance.\n\nHer manager and management team threatened to leave her if she didnât get clean.\n\nHer manager destroyed her phone and deleted all of her dealerâs numbers. She voluntarily moved into a sober-living facility to deal with her addictions. In March 2018, she celebrated 6 years of sobriety.\n\nSources: nickiswift\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYWp6rrvSrWSqrZWowaq7zZqZpZ1dqbWqusasZJ2dnZ56rbvVmquoZZiWwG6x1Z6pZpyfo7Jw"
