        "text": "Demetria Devonne \"Demi\" Lovato (born August 20, 1992) is an American actress and singer.\n\nEarly Life\n\nLovato was born on August 20, 1992 in Albuquerque, New Mexico to former Dallas Cowboys cheerleader Dianna De La Garza (nee Dianna Lee Smith) and engineer and musician Patrick Martin Lovato. She has an older sister named Dallas; a younger maternal half-sister, actress Madison De La Garza; and an older paternal half-sister named Amber, whom she first spoke to when she was 20.\n\nLovato's parents divorced in mid-1994, shortly after her second birthday. Lovato's father was of Mexican descent, with mostly Spanish and Native American ancestors, and came from a family that has been living in New Mexico for generations; he also had distant Portuguese and Jewish ancestry. Her mother is of English and Irish ancestry. Through her father, Lovato is a descendant of Civil War Union veteran Francisco Perea and Santa Fe de Nuevo México governor Francisco Xavier Chávez. Lovato claims that through DNA testing she discovered that she is also of 16 percent Scandinavian descent and one percent of African descent.\n\nLovato was raised in Dallas, Texas. She began playing piano at age seven and guitar at ten, when she also began dancing and acting classes.\n\nCareer\n\n2002-2006: Career Beginnings\n\nIn 2002, she began her career on the children's television series Barney & Friends, portraying the role of Angela. Lovato said in an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that due to her acting career she was bullied so harshly that she asked for homeschooling and received her high-school diploma through homeschooling in May 2009, one year early. In 2006, Lovato appeared on Prison Break, and on Just Jordan the following year.\n\n2007-2008: Breakthrough with Camp Rock and Don't Forget\n\nFrom 2007 to 2008, Lovato played Charlotte Adams on the Disney Channel short series As the Bell Rings. Lovato auditioned for the channel's television film Camp Rock and series Sonny with a Chance during 2007 and got both roles. Lovato played the lead character, aspiring singer Mitchie Torres, in Camp Rock. The film premiered on June 20, 2008, to 8.9 million viewers. Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Lovato's acting skills were underwhelming and that she \"has the knee-jerk smile of someone who is often told she has a great smile\". The film's soundtrack was released three days earlier; however, the music was considered less current than that of High School Musical. It debuted at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200, with 188,000 units sold in its first week of release. Lovato sang four songs on the soundtrack, including \"We Rock\" and \"This Is Me\". The latter, Lovato's debut single, debuted at number 11 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and later peaked at number nine, marking her first entry on the chart. That summer, Lovato signed with Hollywood Records and began her Demi Live! Warm Up Tour before the release of her debut studio album, and appeared on the Jonas Brothers' Burnin' Up Tour.\n\nLovato's debut studio album, Don't Forget, was released on September 23, 2008, and was met with generally positive reviews from critics. Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly said, \"Demi Lovato might satisfy her 'tween fans but she won't be winning any rockers over with Don't Forget\". The album debuted at number two in the U.S., with first-week sales of 89,000 copies. Ten of its songs were co-written with the Jonas Brothers.\n\nDon't Forget was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for U.S. sales of over 500,000 copies. Its lead single, \"Get Back\", was praised for its pop rock style and peaked at number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100, also selling over 560,000 copies in the United States. The album's second single, \"La La Land\", was cited for its strong rock elements and peaked at number 52 in the US, and cracked the top 40 in Ireland and the United Kingdom. The music video for the song was directed by Brendan Malloy and Tim Wheeler. The third single and title track, \"Don't Forget\", peaked at number 41 in the U.S.\n\n2009-2010: Sonny with a Chance and Here We Go Again\n\nIn 2009, Lovato recorded \"Send It On\", a charity single and the theme song for Disney's Friends for Change, with co-stars the Jonas Brothers, Miley Cyrus and Selena Gomez. All proceeds from the song were donated to environmental charities supported by the Disney Worldwide Conservation Fund. Lovato's Disney Channel sitcom Sonny with a Chance, in which she played Sonny Munroe, the newest cast member of the show-within-a-show So Random!, premiered on February 8. Lovato's acting ability was described by Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times as \"very good\" and he compared her favourably to Hannah Montana star Miley Cyrus. That June, she starred alongside Selena Gomez in the Disney Channel film Princess Protection Program, in which Lovato portrayed Rosie Gonzalez / Princess Rosalinda. The film, the fourth highest-rated Disney Channel original movie, premiered to 8.5 million viewers.\n\nLovato's second studio album, Here We Go Again, was released on July 21, 2009; she described its acoustic style as similar to that of John Mayer. The album received favourable reviews from critics who appreciated its enjoyable pop-rock elements, echoing reviews of Don't Forget. Lovato's first number one album, it debuted atop the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 108,000 copies and was later certified Gold. The album's lead single and title track, \"Here We Go Again\", debuted at number 59 on the Billboard Hot 100 and managed to peak at number 15, becoming Lovato's highest peaking solo single at the time. The song also peaked at number 68 on the Canadian Hot 100 and number 38 in New Zealand. \"Here We Go Again\" was additionally certified Platinum in the US. The album's second and final single, \"Remember December\" failed to match the success of its predecessor, but peaked at number 80 on the UK Singles Chart. Lovato made her first 40-city national concert tour, Live in Concert, in support of Here We Go Again. The tour, from June 21 to August 21, 2009, had David Archuleta, KSM and Jordan Pruitt as opening acts. Lovato and Archuleta received the Choice Music Tour award at the 2009 Teen Choice Awards.\n\nIn 2010, Lovato and Joe Jonas recorded \"Make a Wave\" as the second charity single for Disney's Friends for Change. In May of that year, Lovato guest-starred as Hayley May, a teenager with schizophrenia, in the sixth-season Grey's Anatomy episode, \"Shiny Happy People\". Although critics praised her versatility, they were underwhelmed by her acting and felt that her appearance was designed primarily to attract viewers. Later that year, she headlined her first international tour, Demi Lovato: Live in Concert, and joined the Jonas Brothers: Live in Concert tour as a guest.\n\nCamp Rock 2: The Final Jam, with Lovato reprising her role as Mitchie Torres, premiered on September 3, 2010. Critics were ambivalent about the film's plot, and it has a 40-percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. However, Lovato's performance was called \"dependably appealing\" by Jennifer Armstrong of Entertainment Weekly. The film premiered to eight million viewers, the number-one cable television movie of the year by the number of viewers. Its accompanying soundtrack was released on August 10 with Lovato singing nine songs, including \"Can't Back Down\" and \"Wouldn't Change a Thing\". The soundtrack debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 41,000 copies. Jonas Brothers: Live in Concert was reworked to incorporate Lovato and the rest of the film's cast; it began on August 7, two weeks later than planned. The Sonny with a Chance soundtrack was released on October 5; Lovato sang on four tracks, including \"Me, Myself and Time\". It debuted (and peaked) at number 163 on the Billboard 200, her lowest-selling soundtrack. In November 2010, Lovato announced her departure from Sonny with a Chance, putting her acting career on hiatus and ending the series; she later said that she would return to acting when she felt confident doing so. Her departure led to the actual spin-off series So Random! with the Sonny cast, featuring sketches from the former show-within-a-show. The series was cancelled after one season.\n\n2011-2012: Unbroken and The X Factor\n\nLovato released her third studio album, Unbroken, on September 20, 2011. Begun in July 2010, the album experimented with R&B and featured less pop rock than her first two albums. Lyrically, Unbroken encompasses more mature themes as opposed to Lovato's previous work, with some songs focusing on Lovato's personal struggles. The album and its stylistic change received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Lovato's vocals and saw a growth in her musicianship due to the songs focusing on her struggles, but criticized the album's \"party songs\" and found the music to be more generic than her previous efforts. Unbroken debuted at number four in the US, selling 97,000 copies in its first week of release; it was later certified Gold.\n\n\"Skyscraper\", the lead single from Unbroken, was released on July 12, and was noted for its messages of self-worth and confidence. It debuted at number ten in the U.S., selling 176,000 downloads during the first week of release, becoming Lovato's highest first week sales at the time. The song also became Lovato's highest-peaked single since \"This Is Me\" reached number nine in July 2008, and it also debuted at number two on the Hot Digital Songs chart. \"Skyscraper\" received the Best Video With a Message award at the September 2012 MTV Video Music Awards and the track was also certified Platinum by the RIAA and Silver by the BPI. The album's second and final single, \"Give Your Heart a Break\", was released on January 23, 2012, and later peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 16, making Lovato's fourth highest peaking song at the time. It peaked at number 12 on the U.S. Adult Top 40 chart and number one on the U.S. Pop Songs chart. It also became the longest climb by a female artist to reach No. 1 in the Pop Songs chart history, until 2019, when Halsey's feature on \"Eastside\" broke the record. The song was certified triple Platinum in the U.S.; as of October 2014, \"Give Your Heart a Break\" sold 2.1 million digital copies. Billboard has rated the song as Lovato's best, calling it \"timeless\".\n\nIn May, Lovato became a judge and mentor for the second season of the U.S. version of The X Factor, with a reported salary of one million dollars. Joining Britney Spears, Simon Cowell, and L.A. Reid, it was speculated that she was chosen to attract a younger audience. Mentoring the Young Adults category, her final act (CeCe Frey) finished sixth. At the Minnesota State Fair in August, Lovato announced that after a pre-show performance at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards she would release a single by December. On December 24, she released a video on her YouTube account of herself singing \"Angels Among Us\" dedicated to the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. In March, she was confirmed as returning for The X Factor's third season, with her salary reportedly doubling.\n\n2013-2014: Demi and Glee\n\nLovato's fourth studio album, Demi was released on May 14, 2013. The album features influences of synthpop and bubblegum pop and was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. Although Jon Carmichael of The New York Times found Lovato's transition fun, according to Entertainment Weekly it signified a less-mature image. The album debuted at number three in the U.S., with first-week sales of 110,000 copies, the highest selling debut week of Lovato's discography. It was also successful internationally, charting in the top ten in New Zealand, Spain and the UK. The album has been certified Gold in the U.S.\n\nThe lead single from Demi, \"Heart Attack,\" was released on February 25, and debuted at number 12 in the US, with first-week sales of 215,000 copies, the highest first week sales of Lovato's discography. The song peaked at number 10 (Lovato's third showing in the US top ten), and was also successful in the UK, Australia and Europe. The second single, \"Made in the USA\" peaked at number 80 in the US. The third and fourth singles from Demi, \"Neon Lights\" and \"Really Don't Care\", both peaked in the top forty of the U.S., and at number one in the country's Dance Club Songs chart. They were also certified Platinum in the US.\n\nLovato later released a deluxe version of Demi, which was to include seven new tracks, consisting of four live performances and three studio recordings. One of these songs included a collaboration with Olly Murs on a song for his fourth studio album, entitled \"Up\". Lovato contributed to The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones soundtrack album with \"Heart by Heart\".\n\nOn June 11, Lovato released an e-book, Demi, on iBooks. She planned to appear in at least six episodes of the fifth season of Glee, but she only appeared in four. She played Dani, a struggling New York-based artist who befriends Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) and Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) and interacts with fellow newcomer Adam Lambert's character. Lovato debuted in the season's second episode, which aired on October 3, and made her final appearance in March 2014. On November 19, she released a book, Staying Strong: 365 Days a Year, which topped The New York Times bestseller list. She then agreed to write a memoir, which has yet to be released. While in The X Factor, her final act (Rion Paige) finished fifth.\n\nShe announced her Neon Lights Tour (including a Canadian leg) on September 29, 2013, which began February 9, 2014 and ended May 17. On October 21, she released her cover of \"Let It Go\" for the Disney film Frozen, which was released in theaters on November 27. Lovato's cover was described as more \"radio friendly\" and \"pop\" as compared to the original by Idina Menzel. Lovato's cover appears in the movie's credits and the song was promoted as the single for the film's soundtrack. The song peaked in the Billboard Hot 100 at number 38, spending 20 weeks on the chart. It was certified double Platinum by the RIAA. On May 18, 2014, \"Somebody to You\" featuring Lovato was released as the fourth single from The Vamps' debut album, Meet the Vamps. On May 29, she announced her fourth concert tour (and first world tour, covering 25 cities), the Demi World Tour, and its first North American dates. In November 2014, Lovato opened the UK shows on Enrique Iglesias' Sex and Love Tour. She also worked with her longtime friend Nick Jonas on a song for his self-titled album called \"Avalanche,\" released November 2014. Lovato was featured on \"Up\", the second single from Olly Murs' fourth studio album, Never Been Better.\n\nLovato announced her skincare line called Devonne by Demi to be available in December 2014. She released a music video for her song \"Nightingale\" on December 24, 2014.\n\n2015-2016: Confident\n\nLovato's fifth album, Confident, was released on October 16, 2015 and received generally positive reviews from music critics. The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 98,000 copies. During the album's production, Lovato commented, \"I've already started recording for my new album, and I have plans to record during the tour. The sound just evolves into everything that I've been and everything that I want to become.\" She further stated, \"I've never been so sure of myself as an artist when it comes down to confidence, but not only personal things, but exactly what I want my sound to be and what I know I'm capable of and this album will give me the opportunity to show people what I can really do.\"\n\nIn January 2019, the album was certified platinum by the RIAA and has sold one million copies in the United States. In May 2015, Billboard revealed Lovato was in the process of starting an \"artist-centric\" new record label, Safehouse Records, of which she will be co-founder and co-owner. The label will be a partnership between her, Nick Jonas, and Lovato's manager Phil McIntyre, and will form part of a new collaborative arrangement with record label Island. Confident was released through the new venture deal. This will be Lovato's second multi-label venture of her career; she was formerly part of Jonas Records, a UMG/Hollywood/Jonas Brothers partnership, which is now defunct.\n\nLovato released the lead single from Confident titled \"Cool for the Summer\" on July 1, 2015. The song attracted attention for its bi-curious theme and was a commercial success, peaking at number eleven on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and being certified double platinum in the U.S. On September 18, 2015, the title track \"Confident\" was released as the album's second single and peaked at number 21 on the Hot 100. On October 17, 2015, she performed a \"Cool for the Summer\" and \"Confident\" medley, as well as \"Stone Cold\" melody on Saturday Night Live during the series' forty-first season. Lovato was also featured on the re-release of \"Irresistible\", the fourth single from Fall Out Boy's sixth studio album American Beauty/American Psycho. The same month, she signed with the major modeling agency, Wilhelmina Models. Lovato released the music video for her R&B-infused song \"Waitin for You\" featuring American rapper Sirah on October 22, 2015. On October 26, 2015, Lovato and Nick Jonas announced that they would tour together on the Future Now Tour.

On March 21, 2016, \"Stone Cold\" was serviced as the third and final single from Confident. On July 1, 2016, Lovato released a new single titled \"Body Say\" to promote her tour.\n\n2017-2018: Tell Me You Love Me\n\nIn February 2017, Lovato executive-produced a documentary, Beyond Silence, which follows three individuals and their experiences with mental illnesses including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, depression and anxiety. Lovato featured in Cheat Codes' song \"No Promises\", released in March 2017, and Jax Jones's \"Instruction\" along with Stefflon Don, released in June 2017. In 2017, Lovato was included in Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people. On May 8, 2017, she announced a collaboration with sportswear line Fabletics to support the United Nations' initiative, Girl Up.\n\nIn July 2017, Lovato released \"Sorry Not Sorry\" as the first single from her sixth album, which became her highest charting song in New Zealand and the United States at number 6 as well as Australia at number 8. It also became her highest selling song in the U.S. for its 5x Platinum certification by RIAA. The album, titled Tell Me You Love Me, was released on September 29 and opened at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 78,000 0 copies. It received positive reviews from music critics and became Lovato's first album to be certified Platinum in the US. On October 17, Lovato released Demi Lovato: Simply Complicated on YouTube, a documentary focusing on her life, career and personal struggles. It was nominated for \"Best Music Documentary\" at the 2018 MTV Movie & TV Awards. In October 2017, Lovato announced tour dates for the North American leg of her Tell Me You Love Me World Tour, with special guests DJ Khaled and Kehlani. She confirmed European and South American legs of the tour in the following months and the tour commenced in February 2018.\n\nIn November 2017, Lovato released the single \"Échame la Culpa\" with Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi. Lovato performed at the March for Our Lives anti-gun violence rally in Washington, D.C. on March 24, 2018. In May, Christina Aguilera released a single from her album Liberation titled \"Fall in Line\" featuring Lovato, and she was also featured on Clean Bandit's song \"Solo\". The latter became Lovato's first number-one song in the United Kingdom. On June 21, Lovato released a new single titled \"Sober\" which she referred to as \"my truth\" and discusses struggles with addiction and sobriety.\n\n2019-Present: Return to Acting and Seventh Studio Album\n\nOn May 11, 2019, via an Instagram post, Lovato revealed that she had signed with a new manager, Scooter Braun. She shared that she \"couldn't be happier, inspired and excited to begin this next chapter\". Throughout the year, Lovato teased fans on social media with hints of new music and revealed in August that a new album was on the way. In August 2019, it was revealed that Lovato had joined the cast of Eurovision, a Netflix original film, directed by David Dobkin, based on the song competition of the same name. Lovato is set to star alongside Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams. This marks Lovato's first acting role since guest starring in Glee in 2013. Later in the month, after teasing that she had been working on a new project, Lovato revealed via an Instagram post that she would be making her return to television with a guest role in the final season of the NBC sitcom Will & Grace.\n\nIn January 2020, it was revealed that Lovato would make her return to music later that month with a performance of her comeback single \"Anyone\" at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards. The song was released on iTunes immediately following the performance. It marked Lovato's first musical appearance since her hiatus. On February 1, 2020, Lovato made a surprise appearance with Dan + Shay by performing their song \"Speechless\" on the Bud Light Super Bowl Music Fest. The following night, Lovato performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at Super Bowl LIV. A few days later, Lovato revealed that she would host a talk show, Pillow Talk With Demi Lovato, to air on the new video streaming platform Quibi. On March 6, 2020, she released a new single titled \"I Love Me\". On April 17, 2020, Lovato released a collaboration titled \"I'm Ready\", with English singer-songwriter Sam Smith.\n\nArtistry\n\nInfluences\n\nLovato cites Christina Aguilera and Kelly Clarkson as her biggest influences. Her other influences include Britney Spears, Rihanna, Keri Hilson, Jennifer Lopez, Aretha Franklin, Gladys Knight, Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, Alexz Johnson, Billie Holiday, the Spice Girls and Billy Gilman. About Gilman she said, \"We had the same voice range when I was young. I would practice to his songs all the time.\" Lovato listened to metal music in her teens and has said that John Mayer's songwriting has been a \"huge influence\" on her and that after the release of Unbroken, her musical style shifted towards hip hop and R&B.\n\nLovato says, \"I had a lot of respect for Whitney Houston and Christina Aguilera, on some songs where she was really amazing and wasn't trying to be sexy or anything like that.\" About her admiration for Clarkson, Lovato says, \"I just thought she was a great role model. She was never publicly seen drinking and driving or wearing really scandalous clothes or anything like that. I feel like she set a really great example and she was extremely talented.\" Lovato's The Neon Lights Tour was \"inspired by Beyoncé.\"\n\nVoice\n\nLovato possesses a soprano vocal range. Nick Levine of Digital Spy, commenting on her vocals for her album Don't Forget, stated, \"she's certainly a stronger singer than the Jonases. In fact, her full-bodied vocal performances are consistently impressive.\" Becky Brain of Idolator wrote that Lovato has a \"killer voice and the A-list material to put it to good use.\" According to Sophie Schillaci of The Hollywood Reporter, the singer \"has a voice that can silence even the harshest of critics. Something not often found in her peers.\" In a review for Lovato's sophomore studio album Here We Go Again, Jeff Miers from The Buffalo News wrote, \"Unlike so many of her Disney-fied peers, Lovato can really sing... and it's refreshing she doesn't need Auto-Tune to mask any lack of natural ability.\"\n\nUpon working with Lovato on her third studio album Unbroken, Ryan Tedder stated, \"Demi blew me out of the water vocally! I had no idea how good her voice is. She's one of the best singers I've ever worked with. Literally, that good... I mean, she's a Kelly Clarkson-level vocalist. And Kelly has a set of pipes.\" He also commented on their work together on the song \"Neon Lights\" from Lovato's fourth studio album, saying, \"She, in pop music, has one of the biggest ranges, possibly the highest full voice singer I've ever worked with.\" Tamsyn Wilce from Alter the Press commented on her vocals on Demi, stating \"it shows just how strong her vocal cords are and the variation of styles that she can completely work to make her own.\"\n\nIn a review for the Neon Lights Tour, Mike Wass from Idolator commented \"you don't need shiny distractions when you can belt out songs like Demi and connect with the crowd on such an emotional level.\" In a review for the Demi World Tour, Marielle Wakim from Los Angeles Magazine commented on Lovato's vocals, stating, \"For those who haven't bothered to follow Lovato's career, let's get something out of the way: the girl can sing. Get over your fear of being judged by your Facebook friends and Spotify her discography, because you're going to have the last laugh five years down the road (probably sooner) when she wins a Grammy. At 22 years old, her vocal range is astounding.\" She went on to further describe her vocals as \"spectacular.\"\n\nLovato was lauded for her performance of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at Super Bowl LIV in 2020. Patrick Ryan of USA Today commended Lovato for delivering a \"flawless performance\" and \"reminding us she's one of the best vocalists in the industry today.\" He went on to note that \"she hit all the high notes with ease\" and ultimately \"even added some of her own riffs\" which he says resulted in \"a rendition that was uniquely and phenomenally hers.\"\n\nPersonal Life\n\nResidence\n\nOn her 18th birthday, Lovato bought a Mediterranean-style house in Los Angeles, California for her family; however, she decided to live in a \"sober house\" in Los Angeles after leaving rehab in January 2011. In September 2016, Lovato also purchased a Laurel Canyon home in Los Angeles for $8.3 million, but is in the process of selling the house.\n\nHobbies\n\nLovato started training in Brazilian jiu-jitsu in 2016. As of 2019, she is ranked a blue belt in the martial art, which is derived from jujutsu.\n\nRelationships\n\nLovato had no interest in forging a relationship with her late father, Patrick, after his divorce from her mother. She has been vocal about her abusive and strained relationship with her father and once stated, \"He was mean, but he wanted to be a good person. And he wanted to have his family and when my mom married my stepdad, he still had this huge heart where he said, 'I'm so glad that he's taking care of you and doing the job that I wish I could do'.\" Patrick died of cancer on June 22, 2013. After his death, Lovato said that he had been mentally ill, and in his honour she created the Lovato Treatment Scholarship Program.\n\nLovato had an on-off relationship with American singer Joe Jonas between 2008 and 2010, but they prioritised their friendship. From 2010 to 2016, she was in a relationship with actor Wilmer Valderrama. Lovato later in 2016 dated professional mixed martial artist and former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) middleweight champion Luke Rockhold for a few months. She also enjoyed a brief romance with mixed martial artist fighter Guilherme \"Bomba\" Vasconcelos until May 2017. In late 2018, Lovato dated fashion designer Henri Alexander Levy until early 2019. Most recently, she split from model Austin Wilson, after a few months of dating and publicising her relationship in November 2019. Lovato describes her sexuality as fluid, and has said she is open to finding love with someone of any gender.\n\nHealth\n\nLovato had suffered from depression, an eating disorder, self-harm and being bullied before she went into rehab at the age of 18. On November 1, 2010, Lovato withdrew from the Jonas Brothers: Live in Concert tour, entering a treatment facility for \"physical and emotional issues\". It was reported that she decided to enter treatment after punching female dancer Alex Welch; her management and family convinced her she needed help. Lovato said she took \"100 percent, full responsibility\" for the incident. On January 28, 2011, Lovato completed inpatient treatment at Timberline Knolls and returned home. She acknowledged that she had bulimia, had harmed herself and had been \"self-medicating\" with drugs and alcohol \"like a lot of teens do to numb their pain\". She added that she \"basically had a nervous breakdown\" and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder during her treatment. Lovato later said that she had used cocaine several times a day and smuggled cocaine onto airplanes.\n\nIn April 2011, Lovato became a contributing editor for Seventeen magazine, writing an article that described her struggles. In March 2012, MTV aired a documentary, Demi Lovato: Stay Strong, about her rehab and recovery. She began work on her fourth album the following month. In January 2013, it was reported that Lovato had been living in a sober-living facility in Los Angeles for more than a year because she felt it was the best way to avoid returning to her addictions and eating disorder. Lovato celebrated the six year anniversary of her sobriety on March 15, 2018.\n\nIn her 2017 YouTube documentary Demi Lovato: Simply Complicated, Lovato revealed publicly that her treatment at Timberline Knolls was not entirely successful, stating that she still struggled with alcoholism and a cocaine addiction in the year following her stint in the treatment centre and further revealing that she was in fact under the influence of cocaine while being interviewed about her sobriety for Demi Lovato: Stay Strong. She stated, \"I wasn't working my program. I wasn't ready to get sober. I was sneaking it on planes, sneaking it in bathrooms, sneaking it throughout the night. Nobody knew.\"\n\nLovato also stated that her drug and alcohol addictions caused her to not only nearly overdose several times, but later began to impact her ability to perform and promote her third studio album Unbroken, referencing a 2012 performance on the eleventh season of American Idol where she was severely hungover. After her management team had expressed their intentions to leave her, Lovato agreed to resume treatment and counseling for her addictions, leading to her move to a sober-living facility in Los Angeles with roommates and responsibilities to help her overcome her drug and alcohol problems.\n\n2018 Overdose\n\nOn June 21, 2018, Lovato released \"Sober\" in which she revealed she had relapsed after six years of sobriety. On July 24, 2018, she was rushed to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles after emergency services were called to her home due to an opioid overdose. She was reported to be stable and recovering later in the day. Lovato was reported to have overdosed on oxycodone laced with fentanyl and was revived with naloxone. She was hospitalized for two weeks and subsequently entered an in-patient rehab facility. In December 2018, Lovato took to Twitter to dismiss rumours about her overdose and went on to thank her fans, writing, \"If I feel like the world needs to know something, I will tell them MYSELF. All my fans need to know is I'm working hard on myself, I'm happy and clean and I'm SO grateful for their support.\" She went on to add that some day she will \"tell the world what exactly happened, why it happened and what my life is like today.. but until I'm ready to share that with people please stop prying and making up shit that you know nothing about. I still need space and time to heal.\"\n\nLovato later revealed in an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that her worsened struggles with bulimia in 2018 contributed to her eventual drug overdose, as she relapsed three months prior to the incident due to being extremely unhappy. Lovato attributed these struggles to the extreme measures that her former manager, Phil McIntyre, took to control what she ate. Lovato also explained that, along with the controlling nature of her management team, they did not provide her with the help she needed: \"People checking what my orders at Starbucks were on my bank statements... just little things like that... it led me to being really unhappy and my bulimia got really bad and I asked for help and I didn't receive the help that I needed.\" In the same interview, Lovato revealed that her thought process on the night she relapsed following six years of sobriety was as follows, \"I'm six years sober and I'm miserable. I'm even more miserable than I was when I was drinking. Why am I sober?\" When Lovato confronted her management team about her thoughts, they responded with \"'You're being very selfish, this would ruin things for not just you but for us as well,\" which she says made her feel \"completely abandoned\" due to triggering her underlying abandonment issues with her birth father and so she \"drank that night\".\n\nPhilanthropy and Activism\n\nIn May 2009, Lovato was named an Honorary Ambassador of Education by the American Partnership For Eosinophilic Disorders. As part of her involvement with Disney's Friends for Change, Lovato, the Jonas Brothers, Miley Cyrus and Selena Gomez recorded the initiative's theme song (\"Send It On\") in 2009. The song debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 20, and its proceeds were directed to environmental charities through the Disney Worldwide Conservation Fund. Lovato and Joe Jonas recorded another song, \"Make a Wave\", for the charity in March 2010. She is also spokesperson for the Join the Surge Campaign!, DoSomething.Org and Joining the Surge by Clean & Clear; the latter is a national campaign encouraging teenagers to take action in their communities.\n\nLovato was featured in a January 2010 public-service announcement for Voto Latino to promote the organization's \"Be Counted\" campaign preparing for the 2010 United States Census. In October 2010 she was the spokeswoman for the anti-bullying organization, PACER. Lovato participated in the \"A Day Made Better\" school advocacy campaign and has supported DonateMyDress.org, Kids Wish Network, Love Our Children USA, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and City of Hope. In April 2012 she became a contributing editor of Seventeen magazine, describing her personal struggles to its female teenage audience. She became a spokesperson for the anti-bullying organisation PACER and appeared on America's Next Top Model to speak out against bullying.\n\nIn October Lovato was named the ambassador of Mean Stinks, a campaign focused on eliminating bullying by girls. In May 2013 she was cited for her dedication as a mentor to teens and young adults with mental-health problems at a National Children's Mental Health Awareness Day hosted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration in Washington. In late June 2013 Lovato announced the creation of the Lovato Treatment Scholarship Program, named for her late father, to pay treatment costs for mentally-ill patients. In August 2013, she traveled to Kenya for her 21st birthday to participate in a program of the international charity organization Free the Children.\n\nIn May 2014, Lovato was named the LA Pride Parade Grand Marshal and the lead performer for NYC Pride Week for her contribution to the LGBT community. NYC Pride spokesperson Patti Diluigi said, \"Demi Lovato is an amazing role model for today's youth, both LGBT and non-LGBT, for her activism in the area of equality, positive messaging on body image, and level of openness with her struggles. As a community, we're fortunate to have an ally like Demi.\" Lovato has also become the face of Human Rights Campaign's America's for Marriage Equality. For the announcement of the campaign, Lovato stated \"Whether you're LGBT or straight, your love is valid, beautiful and an incredible love. So let's protect love and strengthen the institution of marriage by allowing loving, caring and committed same-sex couples to legally marry. Please join me and the majority of American citizens who support marriage equality.\" On April 2, 2016, Lovato received the GLAAD Vanguard Award for making a significant difference in promoting equal rights for the LGBT community at the 27th GLAAD Media Awards ceremony.\n\nAs of September 2015, Lovato's name appears on the \"Unclaimed Coogan\" list, which is a fund for child actors whose earnings were partially withheld, but which remain unclaimed by the former child performers.\n\nIn June 2016, Lovato was among the artists that signed an open letter to stop gun violence, created by Billboard. That month, the Human Rights Campaign also released a video in tribute to the victims of the 2016 Orlando gay nightclub shooting; in the video, Lovato and others told the stories of the people killed there.\n\nIn January 2017, Lovato returned to Kenya to participate in working with We Movement to do work with women and children. In March 2017, as a celebration of five-year anniversary of sobriety, Lovato donated money to Los Angeles-based charities, randomly selecting a group of causes based on their work, which included animal, LGBT and adoption rights. On March 22, Lovato will be honoured with the Artistic Award of Courage at The Jane and Terry Semel Institute's biannual Open Mind Gala, which recognises those who raise awareness and reduce the stigma of mental health issues.\n\nLovato partnered with Fabletics in May 2017 on limited edition activewear collection. The collaboration was in support of the United Nations Foundation's Girl Up campaign to fund programs \"for some of the world's most marginalized adolescent girls.\" On September 23, 2017, Lovato was named a Global Citizen ambassador for championing the mental health of thousands of children displaced within Iraq and other communities. Lovato and Global Citizen will fund the expansion of a Save the Children pilot program, Healing and Education through the Arts, to violence-scarred young people living around Kirkuk and Saladin Governorate, Iraq.\n\nLovato is a supporter of LGBT rights. When the Defense of Marriage Act was appealed in June 2013, Lovato celebrated the occasion on Twitter, tweeting, \"Gay, straight, lesbian, bi. ... No one is better than any one else. What an incredible day for California AND for equality.\" Lovato later said: \"I believe in gay marriage, I believe in equality. I think there's a lot of hypocrisy with religion. But I just found that you can have your own relationship with God, and I still have a lot of faith.\" Lovato later filmed her music video for Really Don't Care at the LA Pride Parade. For her advocacy efforts on behalf of the LGBT community, Lovato was awarded the Vanguard Award at the GLAAD (formerly the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) in 2016. When Lovato went on stage to accept her award, she said it meant \"more than any music award\" and teared up when talking about growing up in Texas, \"where it wasn’t very accepting of any sort of LGBT person\" and growing up with \"friends that were gay and were afraid to come out\".\n\nOn December 23, 2011, Lovato posted a message on Twitter criticizing her former network for airing episodes of Shake It Up and So Random! in which characters joked about eating disorders. Disney Channel publicity officials quickly took action, apologizing to Lovato and removing the episodes from the network's broadcast and video on demand sources after additional criticism (following Lovato's post) on the network's public-relations account.\n\nLovato identifies as a feminist. Lovato explained what the term means to her in an interview with Dolly (magazine) in 2017, saying \"Feminism means to me doesn’t have to mean burning bras and hating men, what feminism means to me is just standing up for gender equality and trying to empower our youth. And showing women that you can embrace your sexuality and you deserve to have confidence and you don’t need to conform to society’s views on what women should be or how you should dress. So, I think it is just about supporting other women and empowering other women.\"\n\nLovato spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia about raising awareness for mental health and also performed at the March for Our Lives anti-gun violence rally in Washington, D.C. in March 2018.\n\nIn October 2019, Lovato attended a free trip to Israel provided by the Ministry of Jerusalem Affairs and private donors, where she was baptised in the Jordan River. After posting pictures on Instagram, she immediately received backlash due to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but later insisted that it was meant to be a spiritual experience, not a political statement.\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nYear Title Role 2008 Camp Rock Mitchie Torres 2009 Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience Herself 2009 Princess Protection Program Rosie Gonzalez / Rosalinda Maria Montoya Fiore 2010 Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam Mitchie Torres 2012 Demi Lovato: Stay Strong Herself 2017 Smurfs: The Lost Village Smurfette Louder Together Herself Demi Lovato: Simply Complicated Herself 2018 Charming Lenore 2020 Eurovision Katiana\n\nTelevision\n\nYear Title Role 2002-2004 Barney & Friends Angela 2006 Prison Break Danielle Curtin 2007 Just Jordan Nicole 2007-2008 As the Bell Rings Charlotte Adams 2008 Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream Herself Disney Channel Games Herself Studio DC: Almost Live Herself 2008-present The Ellen DeGeneres Show Herself 2009 My Camp Rock Herself 2009-2011 Sonny with a Chance Sonny Munroe 2010 Grey's Anatomy Hayley May America's Next Top Model Herself 2010-2011 Extreme Makeover: Home Edition Herself 2012 Punk'd Herself Teen Choice Awards Herself This Is How I Made It Herself 2012-2013 The X Factor Judge 2013-2014 Glee Dani 2014 Matador Party Guest 2015 RuPaul's Drag Race Herself From Dusk Till Dawn: The Series Maia We Day Host 2016 Victoria's Secret Swim Special Herself 2017 One Love Manchester Herself Project Runway Herself The Voice Herself The Voice of Germany Herself 2018 Keeping Up with the Kardashians Herself 2019 The Bachelorette Herself 2020 Will & Grace Jenny iHeart Living Room Concert for America Herself The Disney Family Singalong Herself\n\nWeb Series\n\nYear Title Role 2009 KSM: Read Between the Lines Herself 2020 Pillow Talk with Demi Lovato Herself\n\nDiscography\n\nSee Also: Demi Lovato Discography\n\nTitle Album Details Certifications Camp Rock (Soundtrack) Released: June 27, 2008\n\nFormats: CD and digital download\n\nLabel: Walt Disney Records\n\nDon't Forget Released: September 23, 2008\n\nFormats: CD, LP and digital download\n\nLabel: Hollywood Records\n\nRIAA: Gold Here We Go Again Released: July 21, 2009\n\nFormats: CD and digital download\n\nLabel: Hollywood Records\n\nRIAA: Gold Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam (Soundtrack) Released: August 10, 2010\n\nFormats: CD and digital download\n\nLabel: Walt Disney Records\n\nUnbroken Released: September 20, 2011\n\nFormats: CD and digital download\n\nLabel: Hollywood Records\n\nRIAA: Gold Demi Released: May 14, 2013\n\nFormats: CD and digital download\n\nLabel: Hollywood Records\n\nRIAA: Gold\n\nBPI: Gold\n\nMC: Gold\n\nConfident Released: October 16, 2015\n\nFormats: CD and digital download\n\nLabel: Hollywood Records, Island Records and Safehouse Records\n\nRIAA: Platinum\n\nBPI: Silver\n\nTell Me You Love Me Released: September 29, 2017\n\nFormats: CD, LP and digital download\n\nLabel: Island Records, Hollywood Records and Safehouse Records\n\nRIAA: Platinum\n\nBPI: Gold\n\nMC: Gold\n\nConcert Tours\n\nHeadlining\n\nDemi Lovato: Live in Concert (2009-2010)\n\nA Special Night with Demi Lovato (2011-2013)\n\nThe Neon Lights Tour (2014)\n\nDemi World Tour (2014-2015)\n\nTell Me You Love Me World Tour (2018)\n\nCo-headlining\n\nFuture Now Tour (with Nick Jonas; 2016)\n\nPromotional\n\nDemi Live!
