        "text": "While we announced this on the MindRiot Entertainment feed, I want to say that this is such a thrill. Jonathan Keasey is an incredible writer telling a significant #seattle story starting Rose Byrne. MindRiot's mission is to find pivotal stories and tell them to create change. The entire team is passionate and a joy to work with - Steve B., Justin MacGregor, Nathan Snow #theatrical #moviemaking #seattlewashington #scriptwriting #scriptwriter #seattlesound https://lnkd.in/d2FMvYWU\n\nThe work of Juvenile Rehabilitation is complex and critical. Thankful to all of our employees, contractors and volunteers for the time and effort they put into transforming the lives of young people at the deepest end of the juvenile system. I encourage you to take time to read, subscribe and share our newsletter and perhaps listen to our podcast if you'd like to learn more or watch the short films made by young people.\n\nSports & Entertainment colliding in Hollywood is a lane I'm becoming quite familiar with these days. To say that I'm excited would be a complete understatement, but to say this is GOD'S WILL is the absolute truth. I'm just a kid from the Central District (Seattle, WA) that crossed paths with Jonathan Keasey many many years ago. Since 7th Grade, we have been connected to one another and now as adults, our worlds collide once again. Keasey is a Hollywood writer and I'm in Sports Management, yet here we are, TOGETHER, bringing IMPACTFUL stories to the masses. Thank you Bro for trusting me and showing me a missing piece to my puzzle. As for my guy Mr. Josh Swindell, thank you my man, for allowing me to be part of your story. Mr. Jerome Dixon, the more I learn your story, the more this project comes alive. Looking forward to all of us coversing over a good meal soon. Team MindRiot Entertainment, LET'S WORK..."
