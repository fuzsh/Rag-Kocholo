        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Pop and screen star Demi Lovato is joining Rose Byrne and The Holdovers breakout Dominic Sessa in Stephanie Laing’s feature Tow.\n\nThe project will see Grammy nominee Lovato take on her first dramatic role in a feature and marks BAFTA-nominee Sessa’s next project — my colleague Baz had the initial scoop on that casting last month — after his acclaimed screen debut in five-time Oscar nominee The Holdovers.\n\nAs we revealed ahead of the European Film Market, Tow will see Golden Globe and Emmy nominee Byrne portray the true story of Amanda Ogle, an unhoused Seattle woman who fought her way out of tow-company hell to reclaim her life and the car that held it all together after receiving a tow bill for $21,634. Ogle also serves as an executive producer on the film.\n\nLaing previously described Ogle as “a true champion” and her story as one of “tenacity and perseverance”.\n\nThe original screenplay comes from Jonathan Keasey, Brant Boivin, and Annie Weisman. The Exchange is handling international sales and CAA Media Finance reps domestic.\n\nProducers are Byrne, Laing, via her newly launched Cake or Death Pictures, Brent Stiefel and Justin Lothrop of Votiv Films (Obvious Child), and Brian O’Shea and Danyelle Foord of The Exchange (The Independent). Executive producers include Keasey, Jonathan Tropper (Irreplaceable You), Ogle, Josh Ricks, and Danny Gusman, Nat McCormick and Giovanna Trischitta of The Exchange, and Kevin Eggers. Casting is by Sherry Thomas at Bialy/Thomas.\n\nSinger Lovato, who has sold more than 24 million records in the U.S. alone, is best known on screen for roles in comedy series and films including Disney’s Camp Rock, Princess Protection Program, Glee and Netflix film Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga.\n\nSessa’s performance in Alexander Payne’s coming-of age-film The Holdovers earned him a 2024 BAFTA nomination for Best Supporting Actor as well as an Independent Spirit Award win for Breakthrough Performance.\n\nTow marks a reunion for Byrne, Weisman and Laing, who recently worked together on Apple TV’s Physical.\n\nSessa is repped by CAA and Untitled Entertainment; Lovato is repped by CAA, Good World Management, and Carroll Guido Groffman Cohen Bar & Karalian."
