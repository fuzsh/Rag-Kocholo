        "text": "Credit: Getty Images (5)\n\nDemi Lovato Through the Years\n\nDemi Lovato has evolved throughout her many years in the spotlight.\n\nLovato became a household name after starring in Disney Channel’s Camp Rock franchise alongside the Jonas Brothers and her own sitcom, Sonny With a Chance. Following her TV success, Lovato checked into rehab in 2010 for substance abuse issues.\n\nUpon her return to the spotlight, Locator focused her career on music, releasing hit after hit including songs “Skyscraper,” “Confident,” “Give Your Heart a Break,” “Sorry Not Sorry” and “Cool for the Summer.”\n\nAfter celebrating six years of sobriety in 2018, Lovato eventually relapsed. In July 2018, she was hospitalized after a near-fatal drug overdose before completing treatment at a rehabilitation facility.\n\nLovato came out as non-binary in May 2021, intending to go by they/them pronouns. Nearly two years later, Lovato said on the “Sprout” podcast that was “feeling more feminine” and would go back to using she/her pronouns.\n\nScroll down to revisit Lovato’s transformation through the years.\n\nCredit: Jamie Trueblood/Disney Channel via Getty Images\n\nFirst Big Breakup\n\nIn May 2010, Lovato and Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam costar Joe Jonas split up after just a few months of dating. \"It was my choice to break up, but I love her as a friend,\" Jonas told Us in a statement. Jonas went on to pen a New York Magazine essay in 2013 about his childhood, opening up about their relationship. \"I really got to know her and got to see the ins and outs of what she was struggling with, like drug abuse,” he wrote. “I felt like I needed to take care of her, but at the same time I was living a lie, because I wasn't happy but felt like I had to stay in it for her, because she needed help.”\n\nCredit: Jason Merritt/Getty Images\n\nGetting Help\n\nJust after they had joined the Jonas Brothers Live in Concert Tour, Lovato dropped out and entered a rehab facility in November 2010. \"I couldn't go 30 minutes to an hour without cocaine, and I would bring it on airplanes,” Lovato admitted in 2013 on Access Hollywood. “I would smuggle it basically and just wait until everyone in first class would go to sleep, and I would do it right there. I'd sneak to the bathroom, and I'd do it.”\n\nCredit: Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images\n\nSisterly Love\n\nLovato has often credited their younger half-sister Madison De La Garza, who was an actress on Desperate Housewives, for helping them get through their rehab stint. “I had to think of her all the time even when it was really, really rough,” Lovato said on 20/20. “I just kept thinking, ‘Set this example for your little sister.’ There were days when I didn’t want to get out of bed, but looking at a picture of my little sister on my bulletin board was one of the main things that kept me going.”\n\nCredit: Fox via Getty Images\n\nDemi as Dani\n\nWhile they were still on The X Factor, Lovato tried their hand at another hit Fox show — Glee. They appeared in four episodes as Dani, who was Santana’s (Naya Rivera) brief love interest. “I really didn’t think I’d be acting again so soon, but I’m really glad this came along,” Lovato told Fox in 2013. “I met Naya on the first day of shooting. So I had never met her before and then I had to kiss her.”\n\nCredit:\n\nSexy for the Summer\n\nIn July 2015, Lovato released their sexiest single to date, “Cool for the Summer.” The subsequent music video featured the former child star embracing their sexuality in a series of revealing ensembles. “Your fans want to grow with you,” they told Us in 2015. “It’s about growing together with your fans. Ultimately when you make music it reflects your life and I’m a lot older now so of course it’s not going to be about the same thing I was singing about when I was 16 or 17.”\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Demi Lovato/Instagram\n\nThe Start of Something New\n\nGearing up for their next musical era, Lovato announced on Instagram in May 2019 that Scooter Braun would be their new manager. “Dreams came true today for me. I officially have a NEW MANAGER!!! And not just any new manager but the one and only @scooterbraun,” they captioned the celebratory post, which featured the pair smiling together while sitting in front of signed contracts. “Couldn’t be happier, inspired and excited to begin this next chapter with you Scooter!!! Thank you for believing in me and for being apart of this new journey. Let’s DO THIS!!!!!!”\n\nCredit: Angelo Kritikos\n\nFuture Mrs. Ehrich\n\nAfter a whirlwind romance, Lovato and Ehrich announced their engagement in July 2020. “@maxehrich — I knew I loved you the moment I met you,” they gushed via Instagram. “It was something I can’t describe to anyone who hasn’t experienced it firsthand but luckily you did too.. I’ve never felt so unconditionally loved by someone in my life (other than my parents) flaws and all. You never pressure me to be anything other than myself. And you make me want to be the best version of myself. I’m honored to accept your hand in marriage. I love you more than a caption could express but I’m ecstatic to start a family and life with you. I love you forever my baby. My partner. Here’s to our future!!!!”\n\nCredit: Cindy Barrymore/Shutterstock; MediaPunch/Shutterstock\n\nSplitsville\n\nTwo months after their engagement, Lovato and Ehrich split in September 2020. He claimed that he found out about the relationship ending via online articles. Months later, Lovato revealed that the breakup led to them thinking more about their sexuality.\n\n\"This past year I was engaged to a man, and when it didn’t work, I was like, ‘This is a huge sign.’ I thought I was going to spend my life with someone. Now that I wasn’t going to, I felt this sense of relief that I could live my truth,\" they told Glamour magazine in March 2021, saying they were \"too queer\" to be with a cis man. \"I hooked up with a girl and was like, ‘I like this a lot more.’ It felt better. It felt right. ... I just found myself really appreciating the friendships of those people more than the romance, and I didn’t want the romance from anybody of the opposite sex.\"\n\nCredit: Courtesy Demi Lovato/Instagram\n\nA New Man\n\nAfter collaborating with Jordan Lutes on her eighth studio album, Lovato confirmed that they were dating.\n\n“YOURE THE BEST BOYFRIEND IN THE WORLD 😭😩. I’m just so grateful I get to call you mine because I’ve never laughed like this in my life, I’ve never smiled so much and my heart is constantly so full of love [with] you,\" she replied to an Instagram tribute from Lutes on her birthday in August 2022.\n\nCredit: Yvonne Tnt/BFA.com/Shutterstock\n\nPronoun Confusion\n\nLovato clarified why they chose to use she/her pronouns in addition to they/them, “I constantly had to educate people and explain why I identified with those pronouns,” the “This Is Me” singer explained in a June 2023 interview with GQ Hype. “It was absolutely exhausting.\n\nThough they “got tired” of the constant explanation, Lovato said it’s for “that very reason” she knows “it is important to continue spreading the word” about pronoun awareness."
