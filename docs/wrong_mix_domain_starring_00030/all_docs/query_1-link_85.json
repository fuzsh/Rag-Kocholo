        "text": "Throughout his ongoing Got Back tour, Paul McCartney has reliably opened with \"Can't Buy Me Love.\"\n\nIt's not the Beatles' deepest song, nor their most beloved hit — though a hit it was. But its zippy, rollicking exuberance still shines brightly; like the rest of the oldies on his setlist, the 82-year-old launches into it in its original key. For two minutes and change, we're plunged back into 1964 — and all the humor, melody, friendship and fun the Beatles bestowed with A Hard Day's Night.\n\nThis week in 1964 — at the zenith of Beatlemania, after their seismic appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" — the planet received Richard Lester's silly, surreal and innovative film of that name. Days after, its classic soundtrack dropped — a volley of uber-catchy bangers and philosophical ballads, and the only Beatles LP to solely feature Lennon-McCartney songs.\n\nAs with almost everything Beatles, the impact of the film and album have been etched in stone. But considering the breadth of pop culture history in its wake, Fab disciples can always use a reminder. Here are six things that wouldn't be the same without A Hard Day's Night.\n\nAll Music Videos, Forever\n\nRight from that starting gun of an opening chord, A Hard Day's Night's camerawork alone — black and white, inspired by French New Wave and British kitchen sink dramas — pioneers everything from British spy thrillers to \"The Monkees.\"\n\nAcross the film's 87 minutes, you're viscerally dragged into the action; you tumble through the cityscapes right along with John, Paul, George, and Ringo. Not to mention the entire music video revolution; techniques we think of as stock were brand-new here.\n\nAccording to Roger Ebert: \"Today when we watch TV and see quick cutting, hand-held cameras, interviews conducted on the run with moving targets, quickly intercut snatches of dialogue, music under documentary action and all the other trademarks of the modern style, we are looking at the children of A Hard Day's Night.\"\n\nEmergent Folk-Rock\n\nGeorge Harrison's 12-string Rickenbacker didn't just lend itself to a jangly undercurrent on the A Hard Day's Night songs; the shots of Harrison playing it galvanized Roger McGuinn to pick up the futuristic instrument — and via the Byrds, give the folk canon a welcome jolt of electricity.\n\nEntire reams of alternative rock, post-punk, power pop, indie rock, and more would follow — and if any of those mean anything to you, partly thank Lester for casting a spotlight on that Rick.\n\nRead more: Living Legends: Roger McGuinn On The History Of The Byrds, His One-Man Show And Editing His Own Wikipedia Page\n\nThe Ultimate Love Triangle Jam\n\nFrom the Byrds' \"Triad\" to Leonard Cohen's \"Famous Blue Raincoat,\" music history is replete with odes to love triangles.\n\nBut none are as desperate, as mannish, as garment-rending, as Derek and the Dominoes' \"Layla,\" where Eric Clapton lays bare his affections for his friend Harrison's wife, Pattie Boyd. Where did Harrison meet her? Why, on the set of A Hard Day's Night, where she was cast as a schoolgirl.\n\nDebates, Debates, Debates\n\nSay, what is that famous, clamorous opening chord of A Hard Day's Night's title track? Turns out YouTube's still trying to suss that one out.\n\n\"It is F with a G on top, but you'll have to ask Paul about the bass note to get the proper story,\" Harrison told an online chat in 2001 — the last year of his life.\n\nA Certain Strain Of Loopy Humor\n\nNo wonder Harrison got in with Monty Python later in life: the effortlessly witty lads were born to play these roles — mostly a tumble of non sequiturs, one-liners and daffy retorts. (They were all brought up on the Goons, after all.) When A Hard Day's Night codified their Liverpudlian slant on everything, everyone from the Pythons to Tim and Eric received their blueprint.\n\nThe Legitimacy Of The Rock Flick\n\nWhat did rock 'n' roll contribute to the film canon before the Beatles? A stream of lightweight Elvis flicks? Granted, the Beatles would churn out a few headscratchers in its wake — Magical Mystery Tour, anyone? — but A Hard Day's Night remains a game-changer for guitar boys on screen.\n\nThe best part? The Beatles would go on to change the game again, and again, and again, in so many ways. Don't say they didn't warn you — as you revisit the iconic A Hard Day's Night.\n\nBroadway is perhaps trying to capitalize on pop music fans more due to post-pandemic struggles and the reputation of Broadway being for the elderly elite. The uptick in pop stars gracing the Great White Way led the New York Times’ Michael Paulson to declare that Broadway was entering its pop era; fittingly half of the eligible new musicals had scores composed by people who primarily work as recording artists.\n\nBroadway is rife with recording artist-helmed scores and jukebox musicals, including Alicia Keys, David Byrne, Fatboy Slim, Arcade Fire, Sufjan Stevens, the Who, and Jamestown Revival. Recording artist-driven musicals were also among some of the notable snubs at the Tonys. Shows that failed to secure Best Musical or Original Score nominations included Ingrid Michaelson for \"The Notebook,\" Barry Manilow for \"Harmony,\" Huey Lewis for \"The Heart of Rock and Roll,\" and Britney Spears for \"Once Upon a One More Time.\"\n\nThe music categories did offer up some big name winners. Best Original Score was set to be an interesting category this year because a play, \"Stereophonic,\" with music by Arcade Fire’s Will Butler was in the running. However, the suffragette musical \"Suffs\" written and starring Shaina Taub took home the award. She also scored Best Book of a Musical, which was predicted by several experts. \"Stereophonic\" did win five awards total including Best Play and Sound Design Of A Play.\n\nOrchestrator and musical director Jonathan Tunick expectedly won Best Orchestrations for \"Merrily We Roll Along.\" While the orchestrations aren’t terribly different from the original production, the Sondheim show flopped when it first opened in 1981. Yet the \"Merrily\" revival has found huge success due to the strength of the music and its three famous leads — perhaps the biggest name on the show's Playbill, Daniel Radcliffe, won Best Performance By A Featured Actor In A Musical.\n\nRadcliffe was joined in the winners’ circle by costar \"Merrily\" Jonathan Groff, who took home Best Performance By An Actor in a Leading Role In A Musical. Costar Lindsay Mendez lost out on Best Actress in a Featured Role of a Musical to \"Hell’s Kitchen’s\" Kecia Lewis, whose performance in the Alicia Keys bio-musical was very well reviewed. Considered a front runner for Best Musical, \"Hell’s Kitchen\" only ended up taking home two awards: Lewis’ actress award and Best Performance by a Leading Actress In A Musical, which went to Maleah Joi Moon, who was the frontrunner in predictions.\n\nWhether it be \"Band on the Run\" or \"Jet\" or \"My Love,\" chances are you've heard a Wings song at least once — in all their polished, '70s-arena-sized glory. More than four decades after they disbanded in 1981, we're getting a helping of raw, uncut Wings.\n\nLast February, Wings' classic 1973 album Band on the Run got the 50th anniversary treatment, with a disc of \"underdubbed\" remixes, allowing Paul McCartney, spouse and keyboardist Linda McCartney, and guitarist Denny Laine to be heard stripped back, with added clarity.\n\nAfter a few months to digest that, it was time to reveal a session that, for ages, fans had been clamoring for. On June 14, in came One Hand Clapping, a live-in-the-studio set from August 1974 that captured Wings at the zenith of their powers.\n\nBack then, Wings had the wind in their sails, with a reconstituted lineup Band on the Run at the top of the charts. They opted to plug in at Abbey Road Studios with cameras rolling, and record a live studio album with an attendant documentary. The film wouldn’t come out until a 2010 reissue of Band on the Run; the music’s popped up on bootlegs, but had never been released in full.\n\nRemember, as you get into Wings: don't cordon off their catalog from McCartney's solo work as a whole. In other words: if you haven't heard masterpieces like 1971's Ram yet, don't go scrounging through Back to the Egg deep cuts yet: check all that stuff out, then return to this list.\n\nThat being established: the proper Wings entryway is almost unquestionably Band on the Run. Like Sgt. Pepper's and Abbey Road before it, it's an exhilarating melodic and stylistic rush, a sonic adventure — whether you go for the original or the \"underdubbed\" version.\n\nIn the grand scheme of solo Beatles, Band on the Run is also the one McCartney album that slugs it out with John Lennon's Plastic Ono Band and George Harrison's All Things Must Pass, in terms of artistic realization.\n\nThat being said: despite slightly inferior contemporaneous reviews, its follow-up, 1975's Venus and Mars, is almost as good — and if grandiosity isn't your bag, you might actually enjoy it more than Band on the Run. (Think of Harrison following up All Things with the sparser, more spacious Living in the Material World, and you'll get the picture.)\n\nBetween those two albums, you've got a wealth of indispensable Macca songs — \"Jet,\" \"Let Me Roll It,\" \"Nineteen Hundred and Eighty Five,\" \"Rock Show,\" \"You Gave Me the Answer\" — as well as satisfying deep cuts, like doomed Wingsman Jimmy McCulloch's \"Medicine Jar.\"\n\nFrom there, it's time to understand Weird Wings — which rewinds the clock to their beginnings.\n\nThe Weirdness\n\nAs the McCartney canon goes, Ram's stock seems to shoot up every year, single handedly inspiring new generations of psych-pop weirdos. By comparison, Wings' debut, Wild Life, was critically savaged in 1971, and its reputation isn't much better today.\n\nAs you'll learn so often in your solo Macca voyage — you've just got to ignore the critics sometimes. Even McCartney himself said \"Bip Bop\" \"just goes nowhere\" and \"I cringe every time I hear it.\" What he leaves out it's a maddening earworm — to hear this loony, circuitous little sketch once is to carry it to your deathbed.\n\nIndeed, Wild Life is full of moments that will stick with you. In the title track, McCartney screams about the zoo like his hair's on fire; \"I Am Your Singer\" is a swaying dialogue between Paul and Linda; \"Dear Friend\" is one of McCartney's most moving songs about Lennon.\n\nWild Life's follow-up, Red Rose Speedway, is a little more candy-coated and commercial — but outside of the polarizing hit \"My Love,\" it has some integral McCartney tunes, like \"Little Lamb Dragonfly\" and \"Single Pigeon.\"\n\nIn the end, though, Wild Life is arguably the early Wings offering that will really stick to your ribs. It's not a crummy follow-up to Ram, but an intriguing off-ramp from its harebrained universe — and as the opening statement from McCartney's post-Beatles vehicle, worth investigating just on that merit.\n\nThe Deep Cuts\n\nMcCartney has always been a hit-or-miss solo artist by design — digging through the half-written pastiches and questionable experiments is part of the deal.\n\n1976's Wings at the Speed of Sound features a key track in the irrepressibly jaunty \"Let 'Em In,\" and an (in)famous disco-spangled hit in \"Silly Love Songs.\" From there, with tunes like \"Cook of the House\" and \"Warm and Beautiful,\" your mileage may vary wildly.\n\nThe ratio holds for 1978's London Town: you could put the gorgeous \"I'm Carrying\" on your playlist and scrap the rest, or you can go spelunking. And McCartney being McCartney, despite 1979's Back to the Egg being choppy waters, he nailed it at least once — on the lithe, sophisticated, Stevie Wonder-like \"Arrow Through Me.\"\n\nToday, at 81, McCartney is an 18-time GRAMMY winner and an enormous concert draw — charging through his six-decade catalog in stadiums the world over. These albums only comprise one decade in his history, where he flourished as a mulleted stadium act alongside his keyboarding wife. But his catalog would be so much different if he never got his Wings.\n\n5 Lesser Known Facts About The Beatles' Let It Be Era: Watch The Restored 1970 Film\n\nDillon Francis and Diplo have respectively built massive careers within dance music — but as they proved on May 15, they may have been just as successful doing stand-up comedy.\n\nThe two producers came together at the GRAMMY Museum's Clive Davis Theater for a wisecracking exchange, marking the 10-year anniversary of Francis' breakthrough song with DJ Snake, the platinum-certified \"Get Low.\" It also felt like a celebration of\n\ntheir longstanding friendship — which predates \"Get Low\" — as the conversation was filled with humorous anecdotes, insider stories about key moments in Francis' career, and some of Francis' favorite memories with Diplo.\n\nSince \"Get Low,\" Francis has had a mercurial music trajectory. Though he's released three studio albums and a number of EPs, his landmark mixtapes — 2015's This Mixtape Is Fire and last year's This Mixtape is Fire TOO — are the key highlights. Like many dance acts, collaboration has been at the core of Francis' work, particularly within the electronic community; he's teamed up with the likes of Skrillex, Calvin Harris, Martin Garrix, Kygo, Alison Wonderland, Illenium, Alesso, and even Diplo's trio Major Lazer.\n\nMore recently, Francis has released collaborations with Ship Wrek, Space Rangers and Sophie Powers, and the moombahton Pero Like EP with Good Times Ahead. The EP includes the bouncy \"LA On Acid,\" whose video — which premiered at the South By Southwest Festival in March — features Diplo in its opening sequencing, along with cameos from Euphoria's Chloe Cherry, Righteous Gemstones' Tony Cavalero and Master of None's Eric Wareheim.\n\nThree days after stopping by the GRAMMY Museum, Francis headed out to Las Vegas to perform at North America's largest electronic dance music festival, Electric Daisy Carnival, on May 18. It was one of many festival appearances for Francis this summer, along with one of several trips to Las Vegas, as he has a residency at the Wynn's XS Nightclub.\n\nBelow, take a look at five takeaways from Francis' spirited conversation with Diplo at the GRAMMY Museum.\n\nFrancis Met Diplo By Sliding Into His Twitter DMs\n\nThe two met in person 16 years ago in Francis' hometown of Los Angeles. Before that, Francis would send Diplo demos for consideration for the latter's record label, Mad Decent. Once Francis realized Diplo had heard his song \"Masta Blasta,\" he slid into Diplo's Twitter DMs — and never left. \"I was harassing him so much,\" Francis quipped. \"'Let's please hang out right now. God, please let me come and hang out.'\"\n\nDiplo invited him to a bar, and they watched the Phillies (Diplo's team) lose. \"It was one of my first blind dates,\" Diplo said. \"I tried to make [Dillon] my ghost producer.\"\n\nShortly after their first meeting, the pair worked together on a dubstep remix for Kelly Rowland's \"Motivation\" — and the more exposure he had to Francis' production skills, the more convinced Diplo was of his talent. \"[Dillon is] too good to be my ghost producer. He's already better than me. We got to do a real record with this guy.\"\n\nFrancis' Superior Social Media Skills Began As A Class Assignment In High School\n\nFrancis' comedic online presence is the perfect combination of humor and authenticity, adding another layer to his appeal alongside his music. He traced his savvy skills back to his time at Los Angeles County High School for the Arts and a new genres course he took. His teacher considered everything as art, and their creations could be whatever they wanted.\n\n\"My friend and I would make comedy videos, basic sketch shows, and we passed the class with flying colors,\" Francis recalled. \"When Vine came around, I did what I did in that class. It was another way of doing stuff I love to do, which is making people laugh.\"\n\nDiplo then chimed in with a hilariously fitting observation. \"You are the Weird Al Yankovic of electronic music,\" he said. \"You had bangers, but you made them funny and you made them accessible to people.\"\n\nHe also commended Francis for opening his eyes to what social media can do for a creator. \"You put me onto interaction on social media in different ways,\" Diplo added. \"I don't think any other electronic music DJs were putting their personality out there like you did. You were the first one to do that properly.\"\n\nFrancis' Musical Education Came From Collaboration\n\nAs Francis revealed, he dropped out of college after a semester. But as someone who has built his career on collaboration, he's learned everything he needs to know by working with other artists. In fact, he thinks of working with other producers as interning.\n\n\"It's my favorite thing to do,\" he said. \"They're going to learn the way that you produce, you're going learn the way they produce. You can cross-pollinate your ideas and come away with new ways to make music. I feel like it also helps with evolving as an artist.\"\n\nDiplo agreed, noting that Francis' time as a young producer, interning at studios, learning from producers and gaining relationships in the process was essential to his career. \"Not to encourage more people to drop out of college,\" he joked.\n\nFurious 7 Was A Key Player In The Success Of \"Get Low\"\n\nDiplo pointed out that \"Get Low\" had its crossover moment after being included in the soundtrack for Furious 7, the 2015 installment of the Fast and Furious franchise. He asserted that it is special for a producer to have a song in a big movie, as he experienced with M.I.A.'s \"Paper Planes\" (which he co-wrote and co-produced) after it was featured in 2008's Pineapple Express.\n\nAs Francis recalled, \"Get Low\" was already well-received and being played by the DJ community, with about five million plays on Spotify before Furious 7. But once it was part of Furious 7 — first in the trailer and then in the film — it ramped up significantly (and now has more than 200 million Spotify streams as of press time).\n\n\"This is when people were buying music on iTunes,\" Francis remembers. \"From the trailer, it peaked at number 5 or something like that, which is huge for any artist in dance music. We're not usually on that chart. To be right next to Selena Gomez with a song that says, 'Get low when the whistle goes,' is crazy.\"\n\nHe Had A Life-Altering Turning Point At 18\n\nAfter Diplo concluded his questions, Francis took a few from the audience. In response to one fan about what he would have done differently early in his career, Francis opened up about one of the worst moments in his life — which actually turned into a great learning experience.\n\nAs he explained, at the age of 18, Francis was charged with a DUI (which was eventually downgraded to wet reckless). His parents spent their savings on a lawyer; he lost his car; he lost his license for a year; he did the DUI classes. And all of it put things into perspective.\n\n\"That was the first moment where I realized, things can get messed up and lost,\" he said. \"I was like, 'I need to figure out my career. I'm going to go make money and I'm going to pay [my parents] back.' That was a very big driving factor for me.\"\n\nNow 36, Francis views the incident as one of the best things to ever happen to him — and, in turn, for his path in dance music. \"If that didn't happen, I don't think I would be sitting here on the stage today.\"\n\n8 Essential Latin Electronic Releases: Songs And Albums From Bizarrap, Arca & More"
