        "text": "Demi Lovato might be adding sitcom star to her impressive resumé.\n\nNBC Tuesday announced \"Hungry,\" which features the pop singer as both executive producer and star, as one of its comedy pilots, which means it could end up on the network's schedule for the 2021-22 TV season.\n\nOther executive producers include Scooter Braun, Lovato's manager, and Sean Hayes of \"Will & Grace\" fame. Lovato appeared in four episodes of the \"Will & Grace\" revival in 2020.\n\nEarlier this month, Lovato, 28, released her seventh studio album, \"Dancing with the Devil ... The Art of Starting Over.\" She's also the subject of a new YouTube docuseries, \"Dancing with the Devil,\" that provides details of her 2018 near-fatal overdose. It premiered in March at the virtual South by Southwest festival.\n\nAccording to a series description, \"Hungry\" centers on \"friends who belong to a food issues group (and) help each other as they look for love, success and the perfect thing in the fridge that’s going to make it all better.\"\n\nLovato has been open about her eating disorder and body-image issues. She has also discussed her struggles with depression, self-harm and sobriety.\n\nLovato was a child actor, appearing on \"Barney & Friends\" and later in the 2008 Disney Channel film, \"Camp Rock,\" but most of her recent acting performances have been voice roles or in music-related videos.\n\nSuzanne Martin, a writer and producer of such comedies as \"Will & Grace,\" \"Hot in Cleveland\" and \"Frasier,\" is listed as an executive producer and the writer of \"Hungry.\" No other casting news was announced for the pilot.\n\nNBC on Tuesday picked up another comedy pilot, “Somebody Out There,” which is described as “a romantic comedy about two set-in-their-ways adults who are challenged by very unexpected strangers to become the best versions of themselves in order to find love and possibly each other.”\n\nIt is based on a Spanish TV series “Pequeñas Coincidencias,” which was created by Javier Veiga, who is one of the executive producers."
