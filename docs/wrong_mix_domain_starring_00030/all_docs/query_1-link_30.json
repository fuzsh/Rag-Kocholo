        "text": "Demi Lovato recently had a candid chat with her former Sonny With a Chance costars, as well as cast members from the show's spinoff series, So Random!. In a video posted on April 25, the 27-year-old singer was joined by Tiffany Thornton, Allisyn Ashley Arm, Doug Brochu, Sterling Knight, Audrey Whitby, Matthew Scott Montgomery, Shayne Topp, and Damien Haas to talk about life after Disney. At the beginning of the conversation, Arm asked what everyone has been up to since Sonny With a Chance and So Random! ended in 2011 and 2012, respectively. \"I went to rehab — several times!\" Lovato said, sharing a laugh with the group.\n\nShe reflected on some of the struggles she experienced during her stint as Sonny Monroe, including her battle with an eating disorder. \"I was so miserable and angry, too, because I felt like I was being overworked. . . . I would have people over for meetings on my lunch breaks because that's how much I worked,\" Lovato recalled. \"People would come in, I'd be covered in a blanket on the couch, and they're like, 'Why is it 80 degrees in here?' And I was like, 'Because I'm freezing.' They're like, 'Oh, my God, what's wrong with you?'\" She added: \"I had an eating disorder and I was underweight and freezing.\"\n\nLovato, who alluded to her early acting days in her \"I Love Me\" music video, left Sonny With a Chance after season two to enter a treatment facility at age 19. She commended her fellow actors for moving forward with So Random!. \"When I left, you don't expect the show to go on without you, but it did,\" she said. \"But I couldn't have been happier for everybody, and I also just wasn't at a period of time where I was ready to be on camera again. I could not go back into that environment and there was other things that factored into it.\" Lovato continued to grapple with addiction following her exit and was eventually hospitalized after a drug overdose in 2018. The star is now using her story of recovery and sobriety to help others.\n\nShe also shared some fond memories of working on set. \"I had the best time with you guys, and when I think about the show, I miss you guys,\" she said. \"And I miss spending time with you and joking and going to Kitchen24 on our lunch breaks. . . . If we were ever to do anything, I think we should just do a whole new thing.\" Watch the full conversation in the video above!"
