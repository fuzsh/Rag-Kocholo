        "text": "Demi Lovato has become a household name over the years thanks to their powerhouse vocals, raw songwriting, killer acting chops, and activism efforts surrounding causes like equal rights and vaccine safety. Before that, though, the 30-year-old \"Skin Of My Teeth\" singer got their start as a kid when they acted on Barney and Friends and led Disney Channel's \"golden age\" in the late 2000s alongside stars like Selena Gomez, Miley Cyrus, and the Jonas Brothers.\n\nOn March 16, 2023, it was announced that Demi will be making their directorial debut for a documentary about the trials and tribulations of being a child star. The Hulu documentary's working title is Child Star and it will \"deconstruct the highs and lows of growing up in the spotlight through the lens of some of the world's most famous former child stars, including Lovato,\" and how \"their rise to fame, fortune, and power affects their futures,\" according to Deadline.\n\n\"There is no better film or topic for my directorial debut than this story, which is close to home,\" Demi said of the doc, per Deadline's report. \"Our project sheds light on important messages about growing up in the public eye, learning to protect our boundaries, and becoming active advocates of our own destinies. I'm humbled to be able to learn from the individuals who have lived the unique experience of child stardom and share their stories in our film.\"\n\nDetails about the former child stars who have taken part in the project are under wraps for now, but in a 2022 interview on the Call Her Daddy podcast, Demi teased the possibility of reuniting some friends from their Disney Channel days. \"I think over the years we've talked about it for sure, but I do have a project in the works where I want to talk to some of those people about their experiences,\" Demi said at the time, referring to fellow child stars made by the \"Disney machine\" like Selena Gomez and Miley Cyrus."
