        "text": "Demi Lovato has been making money since she was a kid on the Disney Channel, so obviously her net worth is giant. Giant like my love for Camp Rock, if you will. But if “Demi Lovato is rich” simply isn’t enough info for you at the moment due to being nosy, it’s cool: We have a breakdown of exactly how much $$$ she's made over the years. But not before we watch this:\n\nLet’s Get Straight to Demi’s Total Net Worth\n\nDemi Lovato's net worth is $40 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. 40! Million! Dollars! Obviously, all this money comes from several different sources, so extremely Camp Rock drumroll, pls…\n\nFirst Up, Her Acting and TV Career\n\nBefore joining the House of Mouse (that’s what cool people call Disney, thanks), Demi was on Barney & Friends. However, her time on the show was relatively brief, which is fortunate because hanging with a giant menacing purple dinosaur all day sounds rough. Anyway, Demi eventually joined the cast of As the Bell Rings before pivoting to projects like Camp Rock (👏 Camp 👏 Rock 👏) and Sonny With a Chance.\n\nAfter that, the Disney love just kept coming with hits like Princess Protection Program and Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam.\n\nOf course, it’s unclear exactly what Demi made for these projects, but we do have a rough idea of what Disney pays its stars. According to reporting from Seventeen, Disney shelled out $10,000 to Rowan Blanchard per episode of Girl Meets World, while Miley Cyrus allegedly made $15,000 per episode for Hannah Montana, and apparently Cole and Dylan Sprouse made $20,000 per episode for The Suite Life. So let’s assume Demi got somewhere in that range?\n\nAfter her ~Disney days~, Demi landed a recurring role on the Will & Grace reboot and even started developing her own sitcom, Hungry, in 2021. Per Deadline, Demi was originally set to star in the series before she pulled out, but she's still an executive producer for the project, which means she'll still be raking in the dough.\n\nLet’s Talk Music\n\nDemi’s had hit after hit after hit. Starting with the Camp Rock soundtrack. Like, the streaming residuals from that alone should have put at least a million in Demi’s account. She's since put out nine (!!!) studio solo albums, gone on tours grossing tens of millions (the Tell Me You Love Me World Tour alone grossed more than $21.4 million), and has been nominated for multiple Grammys. Not to mention, Demi is also the co-founder of her own record label, Safehouse Records, alongside Nick Jonas and her former manager Phil McIntyre.\n\nThat’s a lot of success, and with a lot of success comes a lot of money. According to RIAA, Demi has sold 27 million certified units of digital singles.\n\nDon’t Forget Demi's Hosting Gigs\n\nDemi hosted The X Factor alongside Britney Spears, L.A. Reid, and Simon Cowell back in 2013, and they had a reported salary of $1 million for their first season and $2 million for their second. Not. Bad. Demi was on the show for two seasons, so presumably they made about $3 million pretax.\n\nThen, in 2020, Demi hosted the People's Choice Awards and landed two more hosting gigs the following year. She hosted The Demi Lovato Show, a star-studded talk show on the Roku Channel, and Peacock's unscripted supernatural alien series, Unidentified With Demi Lovato. The latter graced us with *this* hilariously iconic moment:\n\nDemi's Home is *Also* Worth a Fortune\n\nDemi’s purchased several homes over the years, and most recently, they purchased a $7 million Studio City mansion in California. So if all else fails, they can always sell this and still be super rich!\n\nAlso, if you’d like to know how to be rich like Demi, they have some advice courtesy of InStyle back in 2018:\n\n“My advice would be if you work hard, then it’s okay to treat yourself, but just be smart with it. Don’t buy shoes before you pay rent.” Also, quick pro tip: “Sometimes when I go online shopping, I just put things in the cart, and then I exit out of it so that I feel like I went shopping, but I actually didn’t buy anything.”\n\nGlad I’m not the only one with thousands of dollars’ worth of clothes I’m not gonna buy sitting in various online carts."
