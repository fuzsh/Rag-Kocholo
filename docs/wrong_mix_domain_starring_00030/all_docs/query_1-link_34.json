        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nThe director of Disney Channel's \"Camp Rock\" shared some behind-the-scenes secrets about the film.\n\nTaylor Lautner almost played the lead, and the Jonas Brothers were added once Joe was cast.\n\nThe movie was filmed at two different real summer camps that are about 20 miles apart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaylor Lautner auditioned for the role of Shane Gray.\n\nAfter starring in \"The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl\" (2005) and \"Cheaper by the Dozen 2\" (2005), Taylor Lautner auditioned for the leading role in the Disney Channel Original Movie (DCOM).\n\n\"Taylor Lautner did audition, and we liked him a lot,\" director Matthew Diamond said. \"I think we kind of said he wasn't exactly right for the part.\"\n\nThe director said that they could \"tell how talented he was\" but he wasn't \"quite Shane Gray enough.\"\n\n\"I remember thinking he's really good-looking and quite charismatic,\" Diamond added.\n\nEven though Lautner didn't get the \"Camp Rock\" gig, he ended up landing his iconic role as Jacob Black in \"Twilight\" (2008), which came out the same year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe Jonas' rock-star reputation preceded him, so he didn't have to do a singing audition for \"Camp Rock.\"\n\nDisney executives had their eyes on the Jonas Brothers for the film, so Diamond attended one of their shows in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I went to see them, and thought, 'Well, he obviously can sing, and he's obviously got the boy rock-star thing,'\" the director said, speaking of Joe Jonas.\n\nThe singer sent in an acting audition tape for Shane while he was on tour with his brothers, Nick and Kevin. After checking it out, Diamond \"gave him some notes\" and asked him to audition again.\n\nAfter earning the director's approval, Joe just had to get yeses from the producers and Disney Channel president Gary Marsh.\n\nWith huge viewership numbers, a successful sequel, and hit soundtracks, casting Joe seemed to be the right call in the end.\n\n\"He's fantastic in this film, he really was, he delivered emotionally, comically, and romantically,\" Diamond said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShane didn't originally have bandmates in the script — they were added once Joe was cast.\n\nJoe wasn't the only one who left an impression during the LA concert Diamond attended, so Disney decided to rework the script to include all of the JoBros.\n\n\"They were not in the original script,\" the director said. \"The original idea was Shane Gray was the nephew of the head of the camp or something like that, and it was just him.\"\n\nOnce Joe was cast in the role, the execs decided to add parts for Nick and Kevin. Instead of Shane being a troubled solo artist forced by an adult to attend Camp Rock and fix his behavior, they switched it so his bandmates are forcing him to improve.\n\n\"They say, 'You have to go to camp and cool your jets and learn to behave,' and I thought it was a very cool idea,\" Diamond told Insider. \"Because then it's not parents making somebody behave … it's friends making somebody behave, which is a far better paradigm.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe and Demi Lovato hit it off right away with great chemistry.\n\nJoe and Demi Lovato not only had to perform music together onscreen, but they also had to convincingly portray two people falling in love.\n\nThis didn't end up being an issue because Diamond said they had \"great chemistry and great friendship.\"\n\n\"It seemed almost instantaneous,\" the director said, explaining that the only thing he did to help them come together was organize a few dinners with them.\n\nAt the dinners, they discussed the script and how it related to their real-life experiences to help them better understand their characters' journeys.\n\nDiamond said he \"just wanted to make sure that they were so comfortable with each other\" before and during filming, but \"it seemed almost immediate anyway.\"\n\nThe pair even briefly dated in 2010, the year \"Camp Rock 2\" came out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Too Cool\" was crafted as a teenage version of Right Said Fred's \"I'm Too Sexy.\"\n\nTess (Meaghan Martin) was the mean diva of the camp, so she needed a perfect song for the Campfire Jam to match that attitude.\n\nDiamond said he told the writers, \"She's a self-centered character, who thinks the world of herself, so we need to do the teenage equivalent of 'I'm Too Sexy for My Shirt.'\"\n\nAbout three weeks later, writers Toby Gad and Pamela Sheyne created \"Too Cool\" after taking inspiration from the Right Said Fred song.\n\n\"I said, 'Oh my God, this is amazing, it's a fantastic song,'\" the director told Insider. \"It's amazing to get something and know how good it is.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe massive bonfire at the Campfire Jam was real, and crew members had to hide behind the stage during the scene.\n\n\"That was actually real,\" Diamond said of the raging fire in one scene. \"The story behind that was that it was called Campfire Jam … and I really wanted to have a huge fire, I wanted something incredibly visual, not 12 kids sitting around a small campfire.\"\n\nBut movie magic made the fire look closer to the stage than it really was. Diamond said it was actually \"probably 50 feet\" away.\n\n\"We're obviously going to protect our performers and our crew members,\" the director said. \"But that is a real fire, and the way that I shot it, which is just part of the directing technique, makes it look like they're 5 feet away, but that's a bit of an optical illusion.\"\n\nThere was \"plenty of room\" between the actors and the flames, but there were also crew members kneeling below the stage with fire extinguishers and water \"just in case a single spark flies.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFans have joked about the background effects during \"Gotta Find You,\" but it was exactly what Diamond wanted.\n\nIn recent years, \"Camp Rock\" fans have taken to TikTok to discuss their favorite (and the most ridiculous) parts of the film\n\nOne particular moment, when Shane serenades Mitchie with \"Gotta Find You\" on the dock, has left fans wondering where all the extra instruments and backing vocals came from.\n\nDiamond said he loves how closely people are watching this movie, especially all these years later, and explained that Joe's non-solo solo performance was all about \"dramatic license.\"\n\n\"Obviously nobody else is there, you can see, there's a wide shot and it's just the two of them, and it's designed as a great romantic moment,\" he said.\n\nEverything came together to create the \"rich, musical experience\" Diamond wanted, and he applauded both Joe and Lovato for both being so \"wonderful\" in the scene.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere's a reason no one actually eats anything during the cafeteria scenes.\n\nThe average viewer likely didn't notice that the campers are only placing food on their plates and hardly ever biting into any of it in the cafeteria, according to Diamond.\n\nThe director was, again, flattered by some fans' attention to detail, but he shared that the main reason no one eats in the cafeteria scenes is to avoid continuity issues.\n\n\"You don't want their plates to mismatch,\" he explained. \"If they ate an entire taco the first time, but they only feel like one bite the second time, and I have to cut between the first take and the second take, you can't really do that.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLovato was completely committed to the messy stunts she had to do in the film.\n\n\"Camp Rock\" is about teens at summer camp, so Diamond said all of the chaos was a must. And Lovato's \"commitment\" to all of it was incredible.\n\nThroughout the course of the movie, Lovato was tasked with a lot of messy stunt work, and the director said she was \"absolutely willing to do anything,\" leaving him \"so impressed.\"\n\nHe added that Lovato \"wanted to do whatever it took to make this great in any way, shape, or form — stunts, comedy, dancing, music, singing, emotion,\" and that they \"were all there.\"\n\nDiamond said he wasn't surprised Lovato went on to a \"wonderful\" career after working with her on \"Camp Rock.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Camp Rock\" was filmed at two different summer camps.\n\nFans weren't treated to two onscreen camps until \"Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam,\" but the production team used two real Canadian summer camps to film the first movie.\n\n\"We scouted a lot of beautiful summer camps, and we found two that we used,\" Diamond said. \"One was named Camp Kilcoo ... And then we used additional locations, as well.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe camp kitchen was actually 20 miles from the cafeteria set.\n\nThroughout the movie, Mitchie split her time working in the kitchen and hanging with (and trying to impress) her new friends in the cafeteria.\n\nBut those two sets were much farther apart than they seemed in the movie.\n\n\"The 'kitchen,' which she goes into and works in with her mom, that's not in any way, shape, or form a real kitchen,\" the director said. \"We were looking at real kitchens, and then it was pointed out to me that if we used a real kitchen, the refrigerators could never shut off, the stoves could never shut off, there would be all this sound.\"\n\nThey ended up renting fake equipment that they placed in an empty space at the other camp, located about 20 miles away from the cafeteria set.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe wore his purity ring in the movie.\n\nJoe and his brothers famously wore purity rings during the early years of their careers. But deciding if Shane would wear the ring was never a big topic of discussion.\n\n\"I think we were just OK with it,\" the director said. \"I think it probably was kind of like, 'Why not? It doesn't look like he's married. He's a guy who wears a ring.' And we're not ever pointing it out and saying this is his purity ring.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlyson Stoner improvised Caitlyn's dance moves during the Pajama Jam.\n\nThere wasn't much improvising in the film, but Alyson Stoner got to add some of her own flair to her character.\n\nAfter starting her career as a backup dancer in Missy Elliott's music videos and joining the cast of \"Step Up\" (2006), Stoner was given the space to throw in some of her own dance moves during her Pajama Jam performance in \"Camp Rock.\"\n\n\"She's like, 'Look I can do this,'Pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa and then play,' and I was like, 'That's so fantastic,'\" the director told Insider. \"And I said, 'Well, do it. We'll shoot it. If we use it, great, if we don't use it, no harm no foul.'\"\n\nHe said her skills \"didn't surprise him,\" and they ended up using the take in the film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe director realized that Lovato was truly a \"star\" while filming \"This Is Me.\"\n\nWhen the singer went out to film the powerful, shell-breaking \"This Is Me/Gotta Find You\" duet with Joe, Diamond thought Lovato was a \"star.\"\n\nHe added how \"remarkable\" it was for a 15-year-old to be putting it all out there on the stage in front of the cameras.\n\n\"I don't remember how many takes we did, but, believe me, had we only done one take, it probably would've been almost as good,\" the director said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere's a secret backstory for how the camp director got the professional equipment for the Final Jam.\n\nThey originally considered filming Final Jam at one of the camps but decided to make it as grandiose as possible by moving it to a soundstage.\n\n\"You gotta do something you haven't done before. It's gotta be bigger than ever,\" the director said.\n\nDiamond based the Final Jam set on Jacob's Pillow in Massachusetts, which is a theater inside of what looks like a big barn. Then he started to brainstorm \"a complete background story\" for how the camp director, Brown, would've been able to get all the expensive technical equipment for a little summer camp.\n\nHe decided that Brown was a touring rocker, and at the end of his career, they didn't pay him for his final tour.\n\n\"So he said, 'You know what, see all of that lighting equipment over there, I'll take that. Ship it over to my summer camp.' And it seemed like a good idea,\" Diamond said.\n\nThe director said no one ever asked, \"Where does a summer camp get all of that amazing lighting equipment straight out of a Led Zeppelin show?\" But he had fun coming up with a justification nonetheless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMitchie and Shane didn't kiss at the end because it helped build anticipation for a possible sequel.\n\nWith so much instant onscreen chemistry between Joe and Lovato, viewers impatiently waited for Shane to realize Mitchie was his mystery girl. But when they finally came together during their emotional duet, there was no fairy-tale kiss to end the film.\n\n\"I'm sure somebody said, 'Why don't they kiss?' And yet, that's not the script because then what do you do for the next movie,\" Diamond said. \"What these people don't seem to understand — and they're not supposed to understand — is what they really want is conflict, what they really want is to hope for something, what they really want is to root for things, what they really want is to anticipate.\"\n\nHe added that it \"certainly felt\" like an unwritten DCOM rule that you don't have the love interests kiss if there's a strong possibility of a sequel. For example, leads Troy (Zac Efron) and Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens) didn't kiss until the second \"High School Musical\" film.\n\n\"They're supposed to want more,\" the director said. \"Everybody's gonna want to come back for the next movie to see, will they kiss?\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe cast acted like they were at a real summer camp, even when the cameras stopped rolling.\n\nThere was plenty of canoeing, dancing, walking, singing, and gossiping with friends in the movie, but there was also a lot of fun happening off-screen.\n\n\"I do remember I had a good time with the cast and crew,\" the director said. \"They were great kids.\n\n\"My joke, honestly, would be that I took all these kids to summer camp to make a movie about summer camp ...\" he continued. \"When they were not shooting, they might be outside playing with a soccer ball or taking a little walk around the lake or something like that.\"\n\nThis story was originally published on July 31, 2021 and most recently updated on June 21, 2023.\n\nWhen you buy through our links, Insider may earn an affiliate commission.
