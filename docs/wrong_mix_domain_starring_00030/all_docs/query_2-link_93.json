According to Page Six, David DeLuise, the actor who played the dad in Wizards of Waverly Place with Selena says she turned down the role because she knew Demi would get it if she did.\n\nWas it a nice things for a friend to do? Maybe! Or is this a bit of a slap in the face to Demi, who went on to do the sequel as well? Perhaps.\n\nBefore the two women had a falling out, they worked together as kids on “Barney & Friends” and Disney projects."
