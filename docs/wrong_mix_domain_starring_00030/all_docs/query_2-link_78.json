        "text": "Chloe Suazo (born December 27, 1991), known professionally as Chloe Bridges, is an American actress. She is known for her roles as Zoey Moreno in the sitcom Freddie (2005â€“2006) and as Dana Turner in the Disney Channel original film Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam (2010). She has starred in the films Forget Me Not (2009), Family Weekend (2013), Mantervention (2014), The Final Girls (2015), and Nightlight (2015). She has also portrayed Donna LaDonna in The Carrie Diaries, Sydney in Pretty Little Liars, and Kibby in Daytime Divas.\n\nBorn on August 15, 1989, in Casa Grande, Arizona, Joe Jonas was destined for stardom from an early age. He grew up alongside his brothers Kevin and Nick, and together they formed the band \"The Jonas Brothers\", which catapulted them to international fame in the mid-2000s. The band's first self-titled album was a commercial success and peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 200 chart. Their next album, A Little Bit Longer, followed suit and topped the charts in 2008. The band's unique blend of pop rock and teen pop won over millions of fans worldwide. Despite the band's success, Joe Jonas decided to venture as a solo artist, releasing his debut album Fastlife in 2011. Though the album didn't replicate the commercial success of The Jonas Brothers, it paved the way for Joe's exploration into different music genres. His individual musical career was marked by collaborations with various renowned artists like Demi Lovato, B.o.B, and Lil Wayne. In 2015, he formed a new band called DNCE, which again proved his versatility and knack for creating catchy pop music. DNCE's first single, \"Cake By The Ocean,\" became a global hit. Apart from music, Jonas has also dabbled in acting, making guest appearances in popular television shows such as Hot in Cleveland and Angie Tribeca. He also served as a coach on the Australian version of the reality singing competition The Voice. Beyond his entertainment career, Jonas is known for his philanthropic efforts. He is an active participant in charitable events and has supported various causes, including diabetes research and education, disaster-relief efforts, and children's health and education programs."
