        "text": "The film will also star Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams.\n\nIt has been announced that Demi Lovato will be joining the cast of Will Ferrell’s upcoming film, which is based off of the phenomenon that is the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nAnnouncing the casting, which coincided with Lovato’s 27th birthday, Ferrell said in an Instagram post on her account: “We want to make a very special announcement about a brand new cast member.\n\n“It just happens to be her birthday today and I made her this wonderful cake from scratch. So happy birthday, yay.”\n\nThe video then cut to the Sorry Not Sorry singer blowing out the candles.\n\nDeadline reports that Demi Lovato will be playing Katiana, the “best and most angelic singer in all of Iceland.”\n\nWill Ferrell and Rachel McAdams, will be starring as Lars Erickssong and Sigrit Ericksdottir respectively, two aspiring singers who wish to represent Iceland at the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nAlso in the film will be Pierce Brosnan, who plays Lars’s father, Erick, and is the “most handsome man in Iceland” and Dan Stevens, who plays Alexander Lemtov, a Russian contestant.\n\nAlso tied to the project are Icelandic actors Ólafur Darri Ólafsson, Björn Hlynur Haraldsson, Nína Dögg Filippusdóttir and Jóhannes Haukur Jóhannesson.\n\nHopefully the comedy film will be able to capture the magic and craziness of the competition that it is based on.\n\nMeanwhile, the real-life Eurovision Song Contest, which was held back in May was won by Dutch singer Duncan Laurence with his song Arcade.\n\nEurovision is scheduled to be released on Netflix next year."
