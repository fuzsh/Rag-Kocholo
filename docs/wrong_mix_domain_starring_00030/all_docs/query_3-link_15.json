        "text": "In 2016, Demi Lovato’s most identifiable features are her dynamic vocal range (she’s a young Christina Aguilera, believe us) and her no-nonsense attitude towards mental issues and other ailments that affect her and a huge population of young people. Both make her an inspiring celebrity figure to look up to, a role model who keeps it real, always.\n\nWithout her initial foray into acting, however, Lovato the Pop Star might’ve never come to be. She started on Barney & Friends in 2002 at the tender age of 9, later scoring Disney TV gigs here and there. In her career, which, by the way, is over a decade long –14 years running — she’s managed to score a handful of movie gigs, too, the best of which we’ve decided to highlight here. Some are a little unorthodox, some should be considered Demi canon. And although she’s vowed to take a yearlong break from music, she’s already got a pair of film projects queued up for 2017.\n\nHere are all of Demi Lovato’s movie moments, ranked.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nHonorable mention: Two films yet to be released.\n\nSmurfs: The Lost Village (2017)\n\nThis one is kind of a cheat because the movie hasn’t actually been released yet, but trust, who better to play the only female smurf, Smurfette, than our lady Lovato? We’re sure her commanding presence will come across in voice acting, schooling all the other little blue dudes.\n\nCharming (2017)\n\nCharming is another animated flick, this one a tale of Prince Charming where Demi Lovato will voice the love interest, Lenore. If you’re going to cast Lovato in an animated film, we also agree it’s best to make her a star in it.\n\n5. Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience (2009)\n\nAlright, so this one isn’t so much a film as it is a live concert documentary, but as we stated before, Lovato shines brightest with a mic in hand. In 2009 Demi was involved with JoBro heartthrob Joe Jonas, but didn’t let their relationship deter her from what is most important. Girl can sing, and some of her best on-screen moments come from just being herself.\n\n4. Demi Lovato: Stay Strong (2012)\n\nIn the last few years Demi Lovato has become incredibly open about her experiences following a stint in rehab. Comeback stories so often tell us about their subject’s failings and eventual resurgence, while totally glossing over the recovery process in between. The MTV documentary Demi Lovato: Stay Strong is both an intimate look into the heart of Demi, but also an inspiring tale of triumph and tribulation.\n\n3. Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam (2010)\n\nCamp Rock 2: The Final Jam is the second and final film in the Camp Rock series, one that doesn’t evoke the same kind of emotional weight as the first… but teaches the viewer about teamwork and staying true to your beliefs. If you’re looking for some motivation, pop this movie on and you’ll find yourself ready to go.\n\n2. Princess Protection Program (2009)\n\nThis 2009 film is super adorable because it stars both Demi Lovato and Selena Gomez who, at the time, were inseparable BFFs. Lovato plays a princess from a fictional country who is forced to go into hiding, Gomez is responsible to helping Demi acclimate to normal, American life in Louisiana. Craziness ensues.\n\n1. Camp Rock (2008)\n\nDemi Lovato’s first full-length film role is also her best to date. Camp Rock is something of a coming of age tale, one not only about believing in yourself, but accepting yourself — how can you follow your dreams if you don’t know who you are? Demi plays the lead protagonist, a young girl trying to navigate her way around an exclusive music summer camp. We won’t ruin it for you — you’ll just have to watch (or re-watch!) this one."
