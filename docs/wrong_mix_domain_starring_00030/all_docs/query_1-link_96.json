        "text": "In more cross-network exchanging (see Jessica Sanchez), Fox has announced that X-Factor judge and music artist Demi Lovato will join Glee season 5.\n\nAccording to TVLine.com, Demi Lovato is nearing a deal to appear in a “significant arc” during Glee season 5. The report also says that Lovato will play a character named Dani who is a struggling artist friend of Rachel and Santana’s in New York City and that she will be interacting with Adam Lambert’s incoming character. Lambert and Lovato will also have many musical numbers together according to the report.\n\nDemi Lovato is set to appear in at least six episodes of Glee this season with her first episode being part of the Beatles tribute that airs on October 3 on Fox.\n\nWith the X Factor’s results show airing before Glee on Thursday nights, it’s going to be a great night to be a Demi Lovato fan!\n\nNo more details are available about what we can expect from Demi Lovato’s character, but surely more will emerge as Glee continues filming season 5.\n\nGlee was forced to push back the premiere date of season 5 by one week following the tragic passing of Cory Monteith over the summer. Glee season 5 will premiere on Thursday, September 21 at 9/8c.\n\nWhat are your thoughts about Demi Lovato joining the cast of Glee this season?"
