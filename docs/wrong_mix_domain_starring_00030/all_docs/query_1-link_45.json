        "text": "Demi Lovato is known for many things, from their Disney days to their powerhouse vocals and advocacy work. The 29-year-old \"Dancing With the Devil\" singer just picked up a sweet gig as the host of Peacock's new UFO investigation series, Unidentified With Demi Lovato.\n\nThey made an announcement via Twitter to share the news with fans.\n\n\"SURPRISEEEEE!!! I'm hitting the road for an out-of-this-world adventure for my new show Unidentified & I'm taking you guys along for the ride,\" they wrote.\n\nThis isn't Demi's first hosting gig — they hosted E!'s People's Choice Awards and served as a guest host for The Ellen Show in 2020.\n\nIn the four-part limited series, Demi will be investigating UFO reports alongside their sister Dallas and their best friend Matthew Scott Montgomery. The trio will \"investigate recent eyewitness encounters, uncover secret government reports, and conduct tests at known UFO hot spots,\" according to a statement.\n\nUnidentified With Demi Lovato will be executive produced by Demi, their manager Scooter Braun, Scott Manson, Allison Kaye, JD Roth, Adam Greener, Sara Hansemann and Andrew Nick.\n\nDemi is also set to executive produce and star in a comedy series, Hungry, which got picked up for a pilot order at NBC earlier this year. In March, their YouTube Originals documentary series, Demi Lovato: Dancing With the Devil recounted the events of their nearly fatal overdose in 2018. The docuseries received a nomination for best music documentary at the 2021 MTV Movie & TV Awards.\n\nUnidentified seems to be a fun change of pace for Demi, who went from singing about neon lights to studying them for the series. According to Demi's recent Instagram post, we can expect to watch the mysteries unfold really soon.\n\n\"We’re about to take off on a journey to explore the unknown and it’s going to be a wild ride,\" the singer captioned the post."
