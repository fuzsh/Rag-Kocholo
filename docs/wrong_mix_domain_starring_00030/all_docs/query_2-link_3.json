They recognize several different recipients, have runners-up, and have third place. Since this is a specific recognition and is different from losing an award, runner-up mentions are considered wins in this award tally. For simplification and to avoid errors, each award in this list has been presumed to have had a prior nomination.\n\nDemi Lovato is an American singer, songwriter and actress who has won numerous awards throughout her career.
