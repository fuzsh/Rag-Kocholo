        "text": "American singer (born 1992)\n\nDemetria Devonne \"Demi\" Lovato ( DEM-ee lə-VAH-toh;[4] born August 20, 1992) is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. After appearing on the children's television series Barney & Friends (2002–2004), she[a] starred in the Disney Channel short series As the Bell Rings (2007–2008). Lovato rose to prominence for playing Mitchie Torres in the musical television film Camp Rock (2008) and its sequel Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam (2010). The former film's soundtrack contained \"This Is Me\", her debut single and duet, which peaked at number nine on the US Billboard Hot 100.\n\nAfter signing with Hollywood Records, Lovato released her pop rock debut album, Don't Forget (2008), which debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200. Its follow-up, Here We Go Again (2009), debuted at number one in the US, while its title track reached number 15 on the Hot 100. Her third studio album, Unbroken (2011), experimented with pop and R&B, and spawned the US top-ten single \"Skyscraper\". She released her self-titled fourth album in 2013, which debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, and contained the international top-ten song \"Heart Attack\". Lovato's fifth and sixth albums, Confident (2015) and Tell Me You Love Me (2017), infused soul and mature themes. She earned a Grammy Award nomination for Confident, while \"Sorry Not Sorry\", the lead single from Tell Me You Love Me, became her highest-charting single in the US, reaching number six. After a hiatus, she released her seventh and eighth albums Dancing with the Devil... the Art of Starting Over (2021) and Holy Fvck (2022), which respectively reached numbers two and seven in the US.\n\nOn television, Lovato starred as the titular character on the sitcom Sonny with a Chance (2009–2011), served as a judge on the music competition series The X Factor USA for its second and third seasons (2012–2013), appeared as a recurring character on the musical comedy Glee (2013–2014) and the sitcom Will & Grace (2020), and hosted her self-titled talk show (2021). She also starred in the television drama film Princess Protection Program (2009), the animated films Smurfs: The Lost Village (2017) and Charming (2018), and the musical comedy Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga (2020).\n\nLovato has sold over 24 million records in the United States and has also received numerous accolades, including an MTV Video Music Award, 14 Teen Choice Awards, five People's Choice Awards, two Latin American Music Awards, a Guinness World Record, and was included on the Time 100 annual list in 2017. An activist for various social causes, Lovato's struggles with an eating disorder and substance abuse have received considerable media attention, in response to which she published the self-help memoir Staying Strong: 365 Days a Year (2013) and released the documentaries Demi Lovato: Stay Strong (2012), Demi Lovato: Simply Complicated (2017), and Demi Lovato: Dancing with the Devil (2021).\n\nEarly life and career beginnings\n\nDemetria Devonne Lovato was born on August 20, 1992, in Albuquerque, New Mexico,[5] to former Dallas Cowboys cheerleader Dianna De La Garza (née Lee Smith)[6] and engineer and musician Patrick Martin Lovato.[7] Lovato has an older full sister named Dallas,[8] a younger maternal half-sister, actress Madison De La Garza,[9] and an older paternal half-sister, Amber, whom Lovato first spoke to at age 20.[10]\n\nIn mid-1994, shortly after Lovato's second birthday, her parents divorced.[11] Her father was of Nuevomexicano descent, with mostly Spanish and Native American ancestors, and came from a family that had been living in New Mexico for generations; he also had distant Portuguese and Jewish ancestry.[12][13] He was a descendant of Civil War Union veteran Francisco Perea and Santa Fe de Nuevo México governor Francisco Xavier Chávez.[14] Lovato had no interest in forging a relationship with Patrick after her parents divorced.[15] Her mother is of Irish descent.[16][17]\n\nShe has been vocal about her strained relationship with her father, calling him abusive and once stated, \"He was mean, but he wanted to be a good person. And he wanted to have his family, and when my mom married my stepdad, he still had this huge heart where he said, 'I'm so glad that [he's] taking care of you and doing the job that I wish I could do.'\"[18][19] After Patrick died of cancer on June 22, 2013,[20] Lovato said that he had been mentally ill, and she created the Lovato Treatment Scholarship Program in his honor.[21]\n\nLovato was brought up in Dallas, Texas.[22][23] She began playing the piano at age seven and guitar at 10,[24] when she began dancing and acting classes.[25] In 2002, Lovato began her acting career on the children's television series Barney & Friends, portraying the role of Angela.[26] She appeared on Prison Break in 2006 and on Just Jordan the following year.[5] Due to her acting career, Lovato was bullied and consequently requested homeschooling,[27] through which she eventually received her high-school diploma.[28]\n\nCareer\n\n2007–2008: Breakthrough with Camp Rock and Don't Forget\n\nFrom 2007 to 2008, Lovato played Charlotte Adams on the Disney Channel short series As the Bell Rings.[29] Lovato auditioned for the channel's television film Camp Rock and series Sonny with a Chance during 2007 and got both roles.[30] Lovato played the lead character, aspiring singer Mitchie Torres, in Camp Rock.[31] The film premiered on June 20, 2008, to 8.9 million viewers.[32] Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Lovato's acting skills were underwhelming and that she has \"the knee-jerk smile of someone who is often told she has a great smile\".[33] The film's soundtrack was released three days earlier; however, the music was considered less current than that of High School Musical.[34] It debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200, with 188,000 units sold in its first week of release.[35] Lovato sang four songs on the soundtrack, including \"We Rock\" and \"This Is Me\".[36] The latter, Lovato's debut single, debuted at number 11 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and later peaked at number nine, marking her first entry on the chart.[37] That summer, Lovato signed with Hollywood Records and began her Demi Live! Warm Up Tour before the release of her debut studio album,[38] and appeared on the Jonas Brothers' Burnin' Up Tour.[39]\n\nLovato's debut studio album, Don't Forget, released on September 23, 2008, was met with generally positive reviews from critics.[40][41][42] Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly said, \"Demi Lovato might satisfy her 'tween fans but she won't be winning any rockers over with Don't Forget\".[43] The album debuted at number two in the US, with first-week sales of 89,000 copies.[44] Ten of its songs were co-written with the Jonas Brothers.[45]\n\nDon't Forget was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for US sales of over 500,000 copies.[46] Its lead single, \"Get Back\", was praised for its pop rock style and peaked at number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100, also selling over 560,000 copies in the United States.[47][48][49] The album's second single, \"La La Land\", was cited for its strong rock elements[50] and peaked at number 52 in the US,[49] and cracked the top 40 in Ireland and the United Kingdom.[51][52] The music video for the song was directed by Brendan Malloy and Tim Wheeler.[53][full citation needed] The third single[54] and title track, \"Don't Forget\", peaked at number 41 in the US.[55]\n\n2009–2010: Sonny with a Chance and Here We Go Again\n\nLovato's Disney Channel sitcom Sonny with a Chance, in which she played Sonny Munroe, the newest cast member of the show-within-a-show So Random!, premiered on February 8.[56] Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times described Lovato's acting ability as \"very good\", comparing her favorably to Hannah Montana star Miley Cyrus.[57] That June, Lovato starred as Rosie Gonzalez / Princess Rosalinda in the Disney Channel film Princess Protection Program, alongside Selena Gomez. The film, the fourth highest-rated Disney Channel original movie, premiered to 8.5 million viewers.[58] For the film's soundtrack, the pair recorded the song \"One and the Same\", which was later released as a promotional single.[59]\n\nLovato's second studio album, Here We Go Again, was released on July 21, 2009;[5] she described its acoustic style as similar to that of John Mayer.[60] The album received favorable reviews from critics who appreciated its enjoyable pop-rock elements, echoing reviews of Don't Forget.[61] Lovato's first number-one album, it debuted atop the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 108,000 copies, and was later certified Gold.[62][63] The album's lead single and title track, \"Here We Go Again\", debuted at number 59 on the Billboard Hot 100, and managed to peak at number 15, becoming Lovato's highest-charting solo single to that point.[64] The song also peaked at number 68 on the Canadian Hot 100 and number 38 in New Zealand.[65][66] \"Here We Go Again\" was additionally certified Platinum in the US.[63] The album's second and final single, \"Remember December\" failed to match the success of its predecessor, but peaked at number 80 on the UK Singles Chart. Lovato made her first 40-city national concert tour, Live in Concert, in support of Here We Go Again.[67] The tour, from June 21 to August 21, 2009,[68] had David Archuleta,[68] KSM, and Jordan Pruitt as opening acts.[69] Lovato and Archuleta received the Choice Music Tour award at the 2009 Teen Choice Awards.[70] Lovato was featured alongside the Jonas Brothers, Miley Cyrus, and Selena Gomez on the song \"Send It On\", a charity single and the theme song for Disney's Friends for Change.[71][72] All proceeds from the song were donated to environmental charities supported by the Disney Worldwide Conservation Fund.[71] Lovato recorded \"Gift of a Friend\" as a soundtrack for the Disney movie Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure. The movie was released in October 2009.\n\nIn 2010, Lovato and Joe Jonas recorded \"Make a Wave\" as the second charity single for Disney's Friends for Change.[73] That May, Lovato guest-starred as Hayley May, a teenager with schizophrenia, in the sixth-season Grey's Anatomy episode, \"Shiny Happy People\".[74] Although critics praised her versatility, they were underwhelmed by her acting and felt that her appearance was designed primarily to attract viewers.[75] Later that year, she headlined her first international tour, Demi Lovato: Live in Concert,[76][77] and joined the Jonas Brothers: Live in Concert tour as a guest.[78]\n\nCamp Rock 2: The Final Jam, with Lovato reprising her role as Mitchie Torres, premiered on September 3, 2010.[79][80] Critics were ambivalent about the film's plot, and it has a 40-percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.[81] However, Lovato's performance was called \"dependably appealing\" by Jennifer Armstrong of Entertainment Weekly.[82] The film premiered to eight million viewers, the number-one cable television movie of the year by the number of viewers.[83] Its accompanying soundtrack was released on August 10 with Lovato singing nine songs, including \"Can't Back Down\" and \"Wouldn't Change a Thing\".[84] The soundtrack debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 41,000 copies.[85] Jonas Brothers: Live in Concert was reworked to incorporate Lovato and the rest of the film's cast;[86] it began on August 7, two weeks later than planned.[87] The Sonny with a Chance soundtrack was released on October 5; Lovato sang on four tracks, including \"Me, Myself and Time\".[88] It debuted (and peaked) at number 163 on the Billboard 200, her lowest-selling soundtrack.[89] In November 2010, Lovato announced her departure from Sonny with a Chance, putting her acting career on hiatus and ending the series;[90] she later said that she would return to acting when she felt confident doing so.[91] Her departure led to the actual spin-off series So Random! with the Sonny cast, featuring sketches from the former show-within-a-show. The series was canceled after one season.[92]\n\n2011–2012: Unbroken and The X Factor\n\nLovato released her third studio album, Unbroken, on September 20, 2011.[93] Begun in July 2010, the album experimented with R&B and featured less pop rock than her first two albums.[94] Lyrically, Unbroken encompassed more mature themes as opposed to Lovato's previous works, with some songs focusing on her personal struggles.[95] The album and its stylistic change received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Lovato's vocals and saw a growth in her musicianship due to the songs focusing on her struggles, but criticized the album's \"party songs\" and found the music to be more generic than her previous efforts.[96] Unbroken debuted at number four in the US, selling 97,000 copies in its first week of release; it was later certified Gold.[97]\n\n\"Skyscraper\", the lead single from Unbroken, was released on July 12, and was noted for its messages of self-worth and confidence.[98] It debuted at number ten in the US, selling 176,000 downloads during the first week of release, becoming Lovato's highest first week sales at the time.[99] The song also became Lovato's highest-charting single since \"This Is Me\" peaking at number nine in July 2008,[99] and it also debuted at number two on the Hot Digital Songs chart.[100] \"Skyscraper\" received the Best Video With a Message award at the September 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, and the track was also certified Platinum by the RIAA and Silver by the BPI.[101] The album's second and final single, \"Give Your Heart a Break\", was released on January 23, 2012, and later peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 16, making Lovato's fourth highest-charting song to that point.[102] It peaked at number 12 on the US Adult Top 40 chart and number one on the US Pop Songs chart. It also became the longest climb by a female artist[b] to reach No. 1 in the Pop Songs chart history until 2019, when Halsey's feature on \"Eastside\" broke the record.[49][103] The song was certified triple Platinum in the US; as of October 2014 , \"Give Your Heart a Break\" has sold 2.1 million digital copies.[104] Billboard has ranked the song as Lovato's best, calling it \"timeless\".[105]\n\nIn May, Lovato became a judge and mentor for the second season of the U.S. version of The X Factor, with a reported salary of one million dollars.[106] Joining Britney Spears, Simon Cowell, and L.A. Reid,[107] it was speculated that she was chosen to attract a younger audience.[108] Mentoring the Young Adults category, her final act (CeCe Frey) finished sixth.[109] At the Minnesota State Fair in August, Lovato announced that after a pre-show performance at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards[110] she would release a single by December.[111] On December 24, she released a video on her YouTube account of herself singing \"Angels Among Us\" dedicated to the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.[112] In March, she was confirmed as returning for The X Factor's third season,[113] with her salary reportedly doubling.[114]\n\n2013–2014: Demi and Glee\n\nLovato's fourth studio album, Demi, was released on May 14, 2013.[115] The album features influences of synthpop and bubblegum pop and was met with generally positive reviews from music critics.[116] Although Jon Carmichael of The New York Times found Lovato's transition fun, according to Entertainment Weekly it signified a less mature image.[117][118] The album debuted at number three in the US, with first-week sales of 110,000 copies, the best-selling debut week of Lovato's discography.[119] It was also successful internationally, charting in the top ten in New Zealand, Spain and the UK.[120] The album has been certified Gold in the US.[121]\n\nThe lead single from Demi, \"Heart Attack\", was released on February 25, and debuted at number 12 in the US, with first-week sales of 215,000 copies, the highest first week sales of Lovato's discography.[122][123] The song peaked at number ten (Lovato's third top ten entry in the US),[49] and was also successful in the UK, Australia, and Europe.[124] The second single, \"Made in the USA\" peaked at number 80 in the US.[104] The third and fourth singles from Demi, \"Neon Lights\" and \"Really Don't Care\", both peaked in the top forty of the US, and at number one in the country's Dance Club Songs chart.[125][126] She was also certified Platinum in the US.[127]\n\nLovato later released a deluxe version of Demi, which included seven new tracks, consisting of four live performances and three studio recordings.[128] One of these songs was \"Up\", a collaboration with Olly Murs for his fourth studio album Never Been Better.[129] Lovato contributed to The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones soundtrack album with \"Heart by Heart\".[130]\n\nOn June 11, Lovato released an e-book, Demi, on iBooks.[131] She planned to appear in at least six episodes of the fifth season of Glee, but only appeared in four. She played Dani, a struggling New York-based artist who befriends Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) and Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) and interacts with fellow newcomer Adam Lambert's character. Lovato debuted in the season's second episode, which aired on October 3, and made her final appearance in March 2014.[132] On November 19, she released a book, Staying Strong: 365 Days a Year, which topped The New York Times bestseller list.[133] She then agreed to write a memoir, which has yet to be released.[134] While on The X Factor, her final act (Rion Paige) finished fifth.\n\nLovato announced her Neon Lights Tour (including a Canadian leg) on September 29, 2013;[135] it began on February 9, 2014, and ended on May 17.[136][137] On October 21, she released her cover of \"Let It Go\" for the Disney film Frozen, which was released in theaters on November 27. Lovato's cover was described as more \"radio friendly\" and \"pop\" as compared to the original by Idina Menzel.[138] Lovato's cover appears in the film's credits, and the song was promoted as the single for the film's soundtrack.[139] The song peaked at number 38 on the Billboard Hot 100, spending 20 weeks on the chart.

Sharing this with you now opens another level of vulnerability for me.\"[336][337] She had previously come out as non-binary to her family and friends towards the end of 2020.[338][339][340] Lovato later changed her pronouns to include she/her in April 2022,[341] and described herself the following August as a \"fluid person\" who had \"adopted the pronouns of she/her again\" after starting to feel \"more feminine\".[342][343] That September, she reiterated that she \"still feel[s] very comfortable with they/them\".[344]\n\nMental health and substance abuse\n\nLovato had suffered from bulimia nervosa, self-harm, and being bullied before her first stint in rehab at age 18.[345][346] On November 1, 2010, Lovato withdrew from the Jonas Brothers: Live in Concert tour, entering a treatment facility for \"physical and emotional issues\".[347] It was reported[348] that she decided to enter treatment after punching backup dancer Alex Welch; her family and management team convinced her that she needed help.

She decided on moderation as she felt she was setting herself up for failure if she told herself she was never going to drink or smoke again. Lovato said it was because it had been drilled into her that \"one drink was equivalent to a crack pipe.\"[363] This changed the following December when she abandoned her \"California sober ways\" and declared herself \"sober sober\".[364][365]\n\nIn 2021, Lovato said she had initially accepted her bipolar diagnosis and shared this in 2011 because it explained her erratic behavior, but later came to believe it was inaccurate: \"I was acting out when I was 18 for many reasons, but I know now from multiple different doctors that it was not because I was bipolar. I had to grow the fuck up.\"[366] Lovato also stated that the diagnosis has been revised to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).[367]\n\n2018 drug overdose\n\nOn June 21, 2018, Lovato released the single \"Sober\" in which she revealed she had relapsed after six years of sobriety.[368] On July 24, 2018, she was rushed to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles after emergency services were called to her home due to an opioid overdose.[369][370] Lovato recalled, \"The doctors told me that I had five to 10 minutes, like, if no one had found me, then I wouldn't be here.\"[371] The singer was reported to be stable and recovering later in the day.[369] She reportedly overdosed on oxycodone laced with fentanyl[372] and was revived with naloxone.[373]\n\nLovato also had multiple health complications stemming from the overdose, including multiple strokes, a heart attack, and brain damage, the latter of which caused lasting vision problems.[374] She was hospitalized for two weeks and subsequently entered an in-patient rehab facility.[375]\n\nLovato's drug overdose received widespread media coverage, leading to her becoming the most googled person of 2018, ahead of other figures who had received extensive coverage throughout the year, due largely to the public interest surrounding the overdose.[376] CBS News ranked the overdose the 29th biggest story of 2018.[377]\n\nIn December 2018, Lovato took to Twitter to dismiss rumors regarding her overdose and went on to thank fans, writing, \"If I feel like the world needs to know something, I will tell them MYSELF. All my fans need to know is I'm working hard on myself, I'm happy and clean and I'm SO grateful for their support.\"[378] She added that some day she would \"tell the world what exactly happened, why it happened and what my life is like today .. but until I'm ready to share that with people please stop prying and making up shit that you know nothing about. I still need space and time to heal.\"[378]\n\nLovato addressed the matter during a 2020 appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, elaborating on how her worsened struggles with bulimia in 2018 contributed to her eventual drug overdose as she relapsed three months prior to the incident due to being extremely unhappy.[379] The singer attributed these struggles to the extreme measures that her then-manager, Phil McIntyre, took to control the food she ingested.[380] Lovato further explained that, along with the controlling nature of her management team, they did not provide her with the help she needed: \"People checking what my orders at Starbucks were on my bank statements ... just little things like that ... it led me to being really unhappy and my bulimia got really bad and I asked for help and I didn't receive the help that I needed.\"[380] Moreover, she recounted that her thought process the night she relapsed after six years of sobriety was as follows, \"I'm six years sober and I'm miserable. I'm even more miserable than I was when I was drinking. Why am I sober?\"[380] When Lovato confronted her management about these thoughts, the latter responded with, \"You're being very selfish, this would ruin things for not just you but for us as well.\" This made Lovato feel \"completely abandoned\" due to triggering her underlying abandonment issues with her birth father, and so she \"drank ... that night\".[380]\n\nRape trauma\n\nIn 2021, Lovato said she was raped at age 15 when she was an actor on the Disney Channel, and that the rapist was a co-star whom she had to continue seeing thereafter. The incident contributed to her bulimia and self-harm. She told someone about the incident, but the assaulter \"never got in trouble for it. They never got taken out of the movie they were in.\" Lovato stated she did not acknowledge the act as rape at the time, because sexual activity was not normalized to her, and she was part of the Disney crowd who wore purity rings and were waiting until marriage. However, she decided to share her experience because she believed that everyone should \"speak their voice if they can and feel comfortable doing so\". Lovato also stated she was raped during her 2018 drug overdose, realizing a month after the incident that she was not in a place to consent at that point.[381][382]\n\nOther ventures\n\nActivism and philanthropy\n\nLovato's work as an LGBT rights activist has been recognized by GLAAD, which awarded her the Vanguard Award in 2016.[383] When the Defense of Marriage Act was appealed in June 2013, Lovato celebrated the occasion on social media.[384] Lovato has previously affirmed her support for the LGBT community: \"I believe in gay marriage, I believe in equality. I think there's a lot of hypocrisy with religion. But I just found that you can have your own relationship with God, and I still have a lot of faith.\"[385] In May 2014, Lovato was named lead performer for NYC Pride Week and Grand Marshal of the LA Pride Parade, where she later filmed the music video for \"Really Don't Care\".[386][387] Lovato became the face of Human Rights Campaign's America's for Marriage Equality in 2015.[388] In June 2016, Lovato participated in a video released by the Human Rights Campaign honoring the victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting.[389][390]\n\nLovato has also raised awareness for health and mental health issues.

And showing women that you can embrace your sexuality and you deserve to have confidence and you don't need to conform to society's views on what women should be or how you should dress. So, I think it is just about supporting other women and empowering other women.\"[399] In May 2017, Lovato partnered with Fabletics to create a limited edition activewear collection[400] for the United Nations Foundation's Girl Up campaign to fund programs for \"the world's most marginalized adolescent girls\".[401][402]\n\nLovato is a vocal anti-bullying advocate.
