        "text": "John Samuel Barnett has been teaching the Word of God for over 30 years. Most of his lessons are available on YouTube. See http://www.youtube.com/c/DTBMOnlineVideoTraining John has studied at Michigan State University, Bob Jones University (B.S., B.A., M.A., M. Div.), The Master's Seminary (faculty and Th. M. work), Dallas Theological Seminary (Dr. of Biblical Ministry) and with Francis Schaeffer at L'Abri Fellowship. John shares his life with Bonnie his beloved wife, and over the past 35 years of uninterrupted ministry, John has served congregations in the East, and the West, before coming to the precious saints at Calvary Bible Church in Kalamazoo, Michigan in 2008. He has served on the Faculty of the Master's College & Seminary. He was an Associate Pastor to Dr. John MacArthur at Grace Community Church for five years overseeing the Shepherding Ministries. During graduate school, John served as the Assistant Dean of Men at Bob Jones University for five years. Called to the ministry as a young man--his passion remains prayer and the ministry of God's Word. As a global Christian, and having ministered the Word in 60+ nations around the world, John's ministry is deeply touched by outreach and evangelism. Since 1978, in conjunction with Land of the Book Tours John has led dozens of study tours, retreats, travels, and pilgrimages with over 1,500 participants, and taught on site in 21 countries and on five continents. His Tours filmed on site are available to watch online at DTBM.org. As a Seminary Professor of Theology, Church History and the English Bible, John's messages reflect the background of the Scripture from the ancient biblical world, the history of the church and the daily life in far corners of the planet. In 1998 a new ministry called Discover the Book Ministry was launched to provide electronic copies of Pastor John's audio, video, and text studies free of charge to pastors, missionaries, and other believers. Since then, this ministry has grown to serve saints in all 50 states and over 145 lands around the world, as well as through daily radio on a growing number of radio stations in the USA, Europe and the Caribbean.\n\nRead full bio"
