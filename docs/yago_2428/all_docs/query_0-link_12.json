        "text": "Henrietta Octavia Weston, the daughter of Alexander William Rowland, whose family fortune derived from Rowland's Macassar Oil Company, and Henrietta Monica Margaretta Ditges, was born in Clapham, London, on 4th May 1851. Her mother died shortly after giving birth to Henrietta.\n\nAccording to Henrietta's biographer, Seth Koven: \"Her formal education consisted of several terms spent at a boarding-school in Dover run by the Haddon sisters, disciples and sisters-in-law of the controversial aural surgeon and social and moral philosopher James Hinton. Given Hinton's and the Haddons' commitment to social altruism it is not surprising that Henrietta first demonstrated compassionate interest in the lives of poor children during her student days.\"\n\nAfter the death of her father in 1869 she devoted herself to helping the housing reformer Octavia Hill conduct her charity work in the parish of St Mary's Church, Bryanston Square, London. This brought her into contact with Samuel Augustus Barnett, who was working as a curate at the church under William Henry Fremantle. Barnett later told Beatrice Potter: \"Mr Barnett told me much about Octavia Hill. How, when he met her as a young curate just come to London, she had opened the whole world to him. A cultivated mind, susceptible to art, with a deep enthusiasm and faith, and a love of power. This she undoubtedly has and shows it in her age in a despotic temper... I remember her well in the zenith of her fame; some 14 years ago.\"\n\nOn 28th January, 1873, Henrietta married Barnett. Soon afterwards they moved to St Jude's, a parish in Whitechapel. Inspired by the teachings of Frederick Denison Maurice on Christian Socialism, they campaigned against the 1834 Poor Law and advocated what they called \"practical socialism\". This included a \"combination of individual initiative and self-improvement with municipal and state support intended to address specific material needs\". They also promoted the aesthetic theories of John Ruskin, and argued that \"pictures … could take the place of parables\".\n\nHenrietta Barnett became very involved into parish work on behalf of women and children, and gathered a circle of devoted women workers around her. In 1875 she was the first nominated woman guardian, and the following year became school manager of the district schools at Forest Gate. Henrietta, who supported women's suffrage, did considerable amount of \"rescue work\" with female prostitutes. In 1876 she joined forces with Jane Nassau Senior to form the Metropolitan Association for the Befriending of Young Servants. The organisation aimed to prevent girls from becoming prostitutes, criminals or alcoholics, and provide a steady supply of domestic servants. In 1877, Henrietta established The Children's Fresh Air Mission (Off to the Country). The charity’s aim was to take children from London’s slums away to the seaside for holidays in the fresh air and country surroundings.\n\nSeth Koven has argued that while living in Whitechapel: \"Barnett developed an extensive network of clubs and classes to address not only the spiritual but the intellectual and recreative needs of his parishioners. The unpopularity of these ventures encouraged him to think of an alternative non-parochial institutional framework for his work.\" Barnett was deeply influenced by the pamphlet about slum life The Bitter Cry of Outcast London (1883), written by Andrew Mearns, a Congregationalist clergyman.\n\nIn 1884 an article by Samuel Augustus Barnett in the Nineteenth Century Magazine suggested the idea of university settlements. The idea was to create a place where students from Oxford University and Cambridge University could work among, and improve the lives of the poor during their holidays. According to Barnett, the role of the students was \"to learn as much as to teach; to receive as much to give\". This article resulted in the formation of the University Settlements Association.\n\nLater that year Henrietta and Samuel Barnett established Toynbee Hall, Britain's first university settlement. Most residents held down jobs in the City, or were doing vocational training, and so gave up their weekends and evenings to do relief work. This work ranged from visiting the poor and providing free legal aid to running clubs for boys and holding University Extension lectures and debates; the work was not just about helping people practically, it was also about giving them the kinds of things that people in richer areas took for granted, such as the opportunity to continue their education past the school leaving age. As Seth Koven has pointed out: \"Settlements, as first envisioned by the Barnetts, were residential colonies of university men in the slums intended to serve both as centres of education, recreation, and community life for the local poor and as outposts for social work, social scientific investigation, and cross-class friendships between élites and their poor neighbours.\"\n\nToynbee Hall served as a base for Charles Booth and his group of researchers working on the Life and Labour of the People in London. Other individuals who worked at Toynbee Hall include Richard Tawney, Clement Attlee, Alfred Milner, William Beveridge, Hubert Llewellyn-Smith and Robert Morant. Other visitors included Guglielmo Marconi who held one of his earliest experiments in radio there, and Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the modern Olympic Games, was so impressed by the mixing and working together of so many people from different nations that it inspired him to establish the games. Georges Clemenceau visited Toynbee Hall in 1884 and claimed that Barnett was one of the \"three really great men\" he had met in England.\n\nOctavia Hill, was one of those who did not support the idea of Toynbee Hall. According to Seth Koven: \"Octavia Hill, his erstwhile mentor, was so disturbed by what she viewed as Barnett's lax churchmanship that she supported a rival plan undertaken on an explicitly religious basis by the high-church party of Keble College, the Oxford House settlement in Bethnal Green.\"\n\nHenrietta and Samuel stayed with Beatrice Potter in August 1887. In her diary she wrote: \"Visit of three days from the Barnetts, which has confirmed my friendship with them. Mr Barnett distinguished for unself-consciousness, humility and faith. Intellectually he is suggestive, with a sort of moral insight almost like that of a woman. And in another respect he is like a strong woman; he is much more anxious that human nature should feel rightly than that they should think truly, being is more important with him than doing... He was very sympathetic about my work and anxious to be helpful. But evidently he foresaw in it dangers to my character, and it was curious to watch the minister's anxiety about the morale of his friend creep out in all kinds of hints.... He told his wife that I reminded him of Octavia Hill, and as he described Miss Hill's life as one of isolation from superiors and from inferiors, it is clear what rocks he saw ahead.\"\n\nBeatrice also had strong opinions about Henrietta Barnett: \"Mrs Barnett is an active-minded, true and warm-hearted woman. She is conceited. She would be objectionably conceited if it were not for her genuine belief in her husband's superiority... But the good in Mrs Barnett predominates... Her personal aim in life is to raise womanhood to its rightful position; as equal, though unlike, to manhood. The crusade she has undertaken is the fight against impurity as the main factor in debasing women from a status of independence to one of physical dependence. The common opinion that a woman is a nonentity unless joined to a man, she resents as a blasphemy. Like all crusaders, she is bigoted and does not recognize all the facts that tell against her faith. I told her that the only way in which we can convince the world of our power is to show it! And for that it will be needful for women with strong natures to remain celibate, so that the special force of womanhood, motherly feeling, may be forced into public work.\"\n\nChristopher J. Morley has pointed out: \"He (Samuel Augustus Barnett) used music, nonbiblical readings and art to teach those with no education or religious leanings.... Barnett wrote frequently to the press about the conditions in the East End, among his many complaints and suggestions were that street lighting and sanitation should be improved, the poor should treat their womenfolk better and that women should be stopped from stripping to the waist for fights. He also wanted the slaughterhouses removed because of the brutalizing effect it was having on the locals health and morals.\"\n\nSamuel and Henrietta Barnett had a very happy marriage. She later recalled: \"His (Samuel Barnett) temper was naturally of the sweetest, yet he was often surprisingly censorious. His sympathy was both imaginative and subtle, and yet he would harden his heart against the most piteous evidences of poverty, if his economic principles were involved. His generosity in big matters was sometimes reckless, and yet his parsimony in small ones could be both comic and annoying. His patience was part of his religious dependence on God, and yet it was united to restless ruthless energy for reform. His trust in human nature was all-embracing, yet no one investigated the statements of applicants more searchingly.\" Beatrice Webb saw the Barnetts as \"an early example of a new type of human personality, in after years not uncommon; a double-star-personality, the light of the one being indistinguishable from that of the other\".\n\nHenrietta and Samuel Barnett set out their ideas in the book, Practicable Socialism: Essays on Social Reform (1888). The couple described in detail the poverty they had witnessed in Whitechapel. They concluded the problem was being caused by low wages: \"The body's needs are the most exacting; they make themselves felt with daily recurring persistency, and, while they remain unsatisfied, it is hard to give time or thought to the mental needs or the spiritual requirements; but if our nation is to be wise and righteous, as well as healthy and strong, they must be considered. A fair wage must allow a man, not only to adequately feed himself and his family, but also to provide the means of mental cultivation and spiritual development.\"\n\nThe authors rejected the idea that alcohol consumption was the main cause of poverty: \"The teetotallers would reply that drink was the cause, but against this sweeping assertion I should like to give my testimony, and it has been my privilege to live in close friendship and neighbourhood of the working classes for nearly half my life. Much has been said about the drinking habits of the poor, and the rich have too often sheltered themselves from the recognition of the duties which their wealth has imposed on them, by the declaration that the poor are unhelpable while they drink as they do. But the working classes, as a rule, do not drink. There are, undoubtedly, thousands of men, and, alas! unhappy women too, who seek the pleasure, or the oblivion, to be obtained by alcohol; but drunkenness is not the rule among the working classes, and, while honouring the work of the teetotallers, who give themselves up to the reclamation of the drunken, I cannot agree with them in their answer to the question. Drink is not the main cause why the national defence to be found in robust health is in such a defective condition.\"\n\nThe Barnett's were concerned that low wages was forcing people to resort to criminal activity. They also warned about the dangers of revolution: \"By the growing animosity of the poor against the rich. Goodwill among men is a source of prosperity as well as of peace. Those who are thus bound together consider one another's interests, and put the good of the whole before the good of a class. Among large classes of the poor animosity is slowly taking the place of good-will, the rich are held to be of another nation, the theft of a lady's diamonds is not always condemned as the theft of a poor man's money.\"\n\nThe authors of Practicable Socialism: Essays on Social Reform advised that Christian Socialists should help the poor to form trade unions. They were especially concerned about those employed as dockers: \"It would be wise to promote the organisation of un-skilled labour. The mass of applicants last winter belonged to this class, and in one report it is distinctly said that the greater number were born within the demoralising influence of the intermittent and irregular employment given by the Dock Companies, and who have never been able to rise above their circumstances... If, by some encouragement, these men could be induced to form a union, and if by some pressure the Docks could be induced to employ a regular gang, much would be gained. The very organisation would be a lesson to these men in self-restraint and in fellowship. The substitution of regular hands at the Docks for those who now, by waiting and scrambling, get a daily ticket would give to a large number of men the help of settled employment and take away the dependence on chance which makes many careless.\"\n\nIn 1888 Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr visited Toynbee Hall. Addams later wrote: \"It is a community for University men who live there, have their recreation and clubs and society all among the poor people, yet in the same style they would live in their own circle. It is so free from professional doing good, so unaffectedly sincere and so productive of good results in its classes and libraries so that it seems perfectly ideal.\" The women were so impressed with what they saw that the returned to the United States and established a similar project, Hull House, in Chicago. The Settlement Movement grew rapidly both in Britain, the United States and the rest of the world. The settlements and social action centres work together through the International Federation of Settlements. Henrietta Barnett also helped establish the Women's University Settlement in Southwark.\n\nSamuel Augustus Barnett resigned St Jude's in 1893 to serve as a canon of Bristol. However, he continued to work as Warden of Toynbee Hall until 1906 when he took up his post as canon of Westminster. The Barnetts were also strong supporter of the Workers' Educational Association, old-age pensions, and labour farm colonies and helped to establish the Whitechapel Gallery.\n\nIn 1903 Henrietta Barnett joined forces with Raymond Unwin, Barry Parker and Edwin Lutyens to create the Hampstead Garden Suburb. According to her biographer, Seth Koven: \"She embarked on her last and most ambitious project, which dominated the final decades of her life: rescuing 80 acres of Hampstead Heath for public enjoyment and creating the Hampstead Garden Suburb.... Collaborating with the pioneer socialist architects of the Letchworth Garden City, Raymond Unwin and Barry Parker, she created a blueprint for a new kind of organic community consisting of young and old, able-bodied and infirm, rich and poor, married and unmarried. While the largest homes of wealthy residents were placed far from the modest cottages designed for artisans Henrietta hoped that residents of the suburb would be bound together by shared religious, social, educational, and recreational spaces. To this end she successfully advocated the erection of an Anglican church and a nonconformist chapel, along with a purpose-built clubhouse for artisans and their families; the institute, designed by Edwin Lutyens, served as the suburb's focal point for educational, cultural, and civic activity. Henrietta balanced her unwavering commitment to the mutual advantages of relationships between the classes with a staunch belief in the ineradicability of class differences.\"\n\nSamuel Augustus Barnett died at 69 Kings Esplanade, Hove, on 17th June 1913. Henrietta continued to campaign for the causes she believed in. In the introduction to a new edition of Practicable Socialism: Essays on Social Reform (1915) she argued: \"It is satisfactory that dock labour is organised, that dock directors employ more permanent hands, that workmen are eligible as guardians, that houses have been built fit for habitation, that free libraries, open spaces, and baths have been opened, that the poor-law administration has been made more human, that public opinion against impurity is strengthened, that some of the restrictions imposed by a narrow code on children's education have been removed, that twenty thousand or thirty thousand children spend their holidays in the country, that the status of young servants has been raised, that the People's Palace and polytechnics have been provided, that universal pensions and agricultural training farms are within the range of practical politics, that the offer of the best - the best pictures, the best music - to all is not so unusual, that the entertainment of the poor as equals is not so uncommon, and that in London, in British great towns, in America, and on the Continent University settlements have been started. It is most satisfactory that town councils have been roused to a sense of their powers, and have been made to feel that their reason of being is not political but social, that their duty is not to protect the pockets of the rich but to save the people.\"\n\nBarnett then went onto argue: \"But it is disappointing to reflect how little all these improvements mean: how poor the poor remain, how inadequate are the average wages to meet the needs of life, how vast is the body of labour still unorganised, how low is the standard of health in East London compared with that of West London, how altogether below the requirement is the provision of libraries, baths, and open spaces. It is disappointing that emotion still governs methods of relief, that the rich give to relieve their own feelings rather than to relieve the poor, that the busy and kindly start new charities rather than work with others; that the absenteeism of those who might be channels of civilising influences is still the rule; that it remains true to say that the poor die before their time, suffer unduly for want of air, space, and water, and have not the happiness which comes from calm and knowledge. It is disappointing that so little has been done to advance higher education.\"\n\nHenrietta Barnett was appointed CBE in 1917 and DBE in 1924. She published the two volume Canon Barnett: His Life Work and Friends in 1918. She also wrote Matters that Matter (1930), a collection of autobiographical essays on various topics. Seth Koven points out: \"Henrietta Barnett valued highly motherhood and women's distinct moral gifts as peacemakers capable of defusing class war. Having no children of her own she was legal guardian of both her badly brain-damaged elder sister, Fanny, who shared her home for fifty-eight years, and of Dorothy Woods, the Barnetts' beloved adopted ward. From the 1890s Marion Paterson (whom Henrietta had first met in 1876) was her constant assistant, nurse, secretary, confidante, and companion.\""
