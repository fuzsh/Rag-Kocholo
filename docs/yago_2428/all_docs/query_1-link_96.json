        "text": "Abstract\n\nIn May 1949, Herman A. Barnett III, a 23-year-old Black veteran, applied to The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston. His application occurred in the wake of Black student protests against the segregationist policies of The University of Texas and of judicial victories by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to eradicate racial inequalities in state-financed graduate and professional education. Barnett’s application prompted the state to fund a medical school at the Texas State University for Negroes, the only time a state ever attempted to thwart desegregation by financing a separate Black medical school. Barnett was clearly qualified for admission to UTMB, and if the school rejected him, he had agreed to be a plaintiff in an NAACP lawsuit. Legal action was not necessary, however. In August 1949 Barnett was accepted into UTMB, thereby becoming the second African American person to desegregate a Southern medical school. Barnett was technically admitted on a contract basis as a student at the Texas State University for Negroes in Houston and was to have transferred there later. The Black medical school was never built and Barnett graduated from UTMB in 1953. This review analyzes the role that Barnett and Black civil rights activists played in the history of medical education in the US and the dismantlement of racially exclusionary policies in medical schools.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAfter World War II, Black physicians and civil rights activists forcefully pushed for the desegregation of medicine in the US, including medical schools. In early 1948, 26 of the 78 approved medical schools excluded Black students.1(pp444-445) The schools, located in border and Southern states, represented more than one-third of the nation’s medical schools. Although most of these institutions did not have explicit policies that banned African American students, of the 612 Black students enrolled in 1948, 495 attended either Howard University School of Medicine or Meharry Medical College, the 2 Black medical schools.2\n\nOn September 20, 1948, a pivotal event in dismantling racial discrimination in medical education occurred when 20-year-old Edith Mae Irby (1927-2019) (Figure 1) entered the University of Arkansas School of Medicine, becoming the first African American person to desegregate a Southern medical school. Irby’s admission occurred without jeering White mobs, court action, or federal troops.4,5 Throughout her career, Irby (later Jones) continued as a trailblazer, becoming the first woman president of the National Medical Association.\n\nIn August 1949, a year after Irby’s historic desegregation of the University of Arkansas, Herman A. Barnett III (Figure 2) became the second African American person to enter a Southern medical school. Unlike the situation for Irby, his admission was rooted in protest. On April 27, 1949, he joined 38 Black college seniors who peacefully marched onto The University of Texas’s flagship campus in Austin to protest the school’s Jim Crow admission policies.6(pp73-79)7 Twenty-two of the students entered the registrar’s office, seeking applications to the state’s graduate and professional schools. Fifteen of the demonstrators had already applied to The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston (Figure 3). Barnett, a senior at Samuel Huston College in Austin, brought his medical school application with him, as did a dental school applicant. The registrar rebuffed the students and directed them to apply to the Texas State University for Negroes in Houston, an institution that did not even have a medical school. Defying this advice, Barnett applied to UTMB. His application in May 1949 prompted Texas to appropriate funds for a medical school at the Texas State University for Negroes, the only time a state ever attempted to thwart desegregation by financing a separate Black medical school.\n\nBarnett had already decided that if he were rejected by UTMB, he would be the plaintiff in a lawsuit filed by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Legal action was ultimately not necessary. In August 1949, UTMB accepted Barnett. The victory was hollow, however. Barnett was technically admitted on a contract basis as a Texas State University for Negroes student with the understanding that he would complete his medical studies there. The Black medical school was never built, and in the end, Barnett graduated from UTMB in 1953. Barnett’s story illuminates the significant yet largely unknown role Black civil rights activists played in the history of American medical education and the desegregation of medical education.\n\nHerman Aladdin Barnett III\n\nHerman Aladdin Barnett III was born on January 22, 1926, in Lockhart, Texas, a small town 35 miles southeast of Austin, to 19-year-old Hencil Barnett and 17-year-old Lula Searcy Barnett. His father, a laborer, died 2 years after Herman’s birth. In 1930, Lula married Reverend Sylvester Byars, a minister and automobile mechanic, who raised Barnett, the only child of the couple, as his own son. Barnett graduated from high school in 1943 and enlisted in the military the following year. He qualified for fighter pilot training as one of the famed Tuskegee Airmen. After serving in the US Air Force for 2 years, he was honorably discharged as a flight officer. Barnett had dreamed of becoming a physician since childhood. In June 1946, the 20-year-old began premedical studies at Samuel Huston College (now Huston-Tillotson University), a historically Black institution in Austin.1(pp79-84)8,9\n\nThe NAACP’s Early Fight Against Segregated Education\n\nBarnett began his undergraduate education at a particularly propitious time in the history of the NAACP’s legal campaign to eradicate racial inequalities in state-financed graduate and professional schools. The effort had been launched in 1935 by Charles Hamilton Houston, the civil rights organization’s special counsel who had already won some judicial victories in Missouri and Oklahoma. Texas was the next battleground. Houston’s eventual goal was to overturn the separate-but-equal doctrine embodied in the 1896 US Supreme Court decision Plessy v Ferguson. As an initial step, he made educational inequality the target. Well into the mid-20th century, most Southern states still did not provide any postbaccalaureate educational opportunities for African Americans. It was clearly not a problem of “separate but equal” but “separate and nonexistent.”10(p60)\n\nHouston contended that it was unconstitutional for a state to provide its White citizens with graduate and professional education but deny such opportunities to its Black residents. Houston also recognized that it would be a financial burden for states, especially cash-strapped Southern ones, to maintain separate graduate and professional schools. As one NAACP ally put it, “what was the state going to do when a Negro applied for a medical education—build him a whole medical school?”11(p258) If a state did create Black schools, Houston’s goal was to bring them “up to absolute equality with White schools.”12(p300) The legal campaign called for the NAACP to find exceptionally qualified candidates for graduate and professional school admission and then sue if they were rejected by state universities. Herman Barnett, a brilliant student, met the NAACP’s high standards.\n\nHouston’s strategy yielded important victories in the US Supreme Court in 1938 and 1948. In 1935, the University of Missouri Law School had rejected Lloyd Gaines solely on racial grounds. The university offered him 2 options: either apply to a nonexistent law school at a Black state university or accept a state-funded scholarship to attend school out of state. In 1938, the Supreme Court found in Gaines v Canada that the scholarship and the absence of a separate law school were unconstitutional.13 It ruled that the state had to admit Black students to already existing schools or provide its Black citizens the advantages of higher education “substantially equal” to those offered White citizens. Furthermore, such opportunities had to be provided within state borders. Eight years later, the NAACP sued The University of Oklahoma Law School after the school rejected Ada Lois Sipuel. The Supreme Court ruled against the university’s discriminatory policies in Sipuel v Board of Regents of The University of Oklahoma in 1948 and sent the case back to state court.14 Later that year, the Oklahoma Supreme Court ordered the university to either admit Sipuel or close its law school until it created one for African American students.15 The Board of Regents responded by establishing—in 2 weeks—a makeshift law school of questionable quality. Sipuel refused to attend.16\n\nTexas became the next major focus of the NAACP’s legal campaign when Heman Sweatt applied to The University of Texas Law School in February 1946. University President Theophilus Painter acknowledged that Sweatt was qualified, but the state attorney general ruled that he be rejected to uphold the “wise and long continued policy of segregation of races in educational institutions.”17 The NAACP filed suit on Sweatt’s behalf, and in June 1946 the District Court of Travis County ruled in Sweatt v Painter that Sweatt was entitled to educational opportunities equal to those available to White citizens. The court gave the state 6 months to open a segregated Black law school or admit Sweatt to The University of Texas Law School. The NAACP appealed, charging that the proposed school did not meet the standard of substantially equivalent.18(pp124-151) Again, the NAACP criticized the quality of the makeshift facility and Sweatt rebuffed the offer. As Sweatt v Painter found its way to the US Supreme Court in October 1949, the organization switched from an emphasis on equality to a direct assault on segregation. “Equality under a segregated system,” Thurgood Marshall, its new chief counsel, declared, “is a legal fiction and a judicial myth.”19\n\nCivil Rights Activism in Texas\n\nTexas was a critical battleground for the NAACP, for as one official contended, “Other weaker Southern states have been looking to big, rich, powerful, arrogant Texas to put up a last-ditch fight, conceding nothing voluntarily.”20 Thus, a win in the Lone Star State against segregation in state-financed schools would likely have national repercussions. The civil rights organization encountered a rigid racial line in Texas. The state constitution and state laws mandated racial segregation in schools.21 These practices were defended by a defiant board of regents. One member opined, “There is not the slightest danger of any negro [sic] attending The University of Texas…so long as you have a Board of Regents with as much intestinal fortitude as the present one has.”22(p322) In addition, the state’s rich coffers enabled it to initially undermine the NAACP’s presumption that economic infeasibility would block the establishment of duplicate facilities. Yet to evade desegregation at The University of Texas, the state created not just a Black law school, but an entire Black university. On March 3, 1947, Texas Governor Beauford Jester signed legislation establishing the Texas State University for Negroes. The planned postbaccalaureate instruction in medicine, pharmacy, and law was promised to be equivalent to that offered at other state institutions.1(pp72-73)\n\nIn fact, it was in August 1946, in the wake of Sweatt’s application to the law school, that University of Texas officials first discussed opening a Black medical school in Houston that would be attached to the Houston Negro Hospital. The University of Texas Medical Branch Executive Vice President and Dean Chauncey Leake estimated that it would cost between $143 000 and $185 000 annually to operate the school, exclusive of hospital costs. However, he warned Painter, the university president, that “the costs of medical education are greater than any form of university effort” and that “the cost of medical training will increase as standards continue to improve.”23 Plans for the Black medical school stalled. They did not resurface until Herman Barnett sought admission in 1949. There were no institutions in Texas to educate Black medical students. In clear violation of the 1938 Supreme Court decision in Gaines,13 the state paid for such students to be trained out of state, primarily at Howard University and Meharry Medical College.24 In 1948, Texas subsidized 16 Black students.25\n\nAn array of Black organizations in Texas played crucial roles in efforts to get African American applicants admitted to The University of Texas, including its medical school. As part of a “carefully planned offensive,” local NAACP chapters raised money to fund legal cases, developed grassroots support for desegregation efforts, and coordinated activities with community organizations.26 They used their far-reaching networks to recruit “an imposing number” of qualified Black Texans to apply to the university’s graduate and professional schools.27 Yet it proved difficult to find medical school applicants who met admissions criteria and possessed the personal determination to endure the stresses of being a plaintiff.28\n\nThe Lone Star Medical Association, a Black medical society, donated $5000 to bolster the NAACP’s efforts to desegregate the medical school.29,30 It also assailed out-of-state scholarships, the establishment of a Black medical school, and the exclusion of African Americans from the state-supported school. In March 1949, Lone Star Medical Association President Dr J. L. Dickey declared, “We are tired of going a thousand miles to a medical school; we ought to go in Texas, and I don’t mean to a segregated medical school, but to the one already operating in the state.”31\n\nCivil rights organizations in Texas already had a history of cultivating strong ties with the state’s Black colleges, providing students at the schools with training in academics and activism. The April 27, 1949, protest at The University of Texas at Austin had been planned by students at Bishop College (a historically Black college located at the time in Marshall, Texas, that closed in 1988) with the imprimatur of its president, Joseph J. Rhoads, who also led the Texas Council of Negro Organizations.32 James H. Morton, head of the Austin branch of the NAACP, was Herman Barnett’s chemistry teacher at Samuel Huston College. He believed that his student possessed the academic record, personal courage, and political inclination to be the NAACP’s test case to break racial barriers at UTMB. Barnett was an honors student majoring in chemistry and minoring in mathematics, the recipient of several academic prizes, and the leader of several student organizations, including president of the student council. He was certainly qualified for admission to UTMB. A July 1949 New York Times article reported that “no White student in Texas who seeks admission to the State Medical School has a record so good.”33 When he applied to UTMB, Barnett had already been accepted into The University of Chicago and Meharry Medical College and had agreed to be the plaintiff in a potential lawsuit.34 He wanted to remain close to home and believed that it was his right to be educated at the only state-supported medical school in Texas. In May 1949, the 23-year-old mailed in his application. He did not receive an immediate response.\n\nTexas State University for Negroes Medical School\n\nWithin 2½ months of Barnett’s application to UTMB, the Texas legislature allocated $175 000 annually for 2 years to create a medical school at the Texas State University for Negroes that would be ready by the start of the September semester.35(p1146) During the same period, UTMB would receive $1.5 million in state funds annually.34(p1142) Craig S. Cullinan, the board chair at the Texas State University for Negroes, warned Painter, The University of Texas president, that it would be impossible to open the school within 2 months, given that there would be no buildings, personnel, or equipment.36 The NAACP opposed the establishment of this “stop-gap medical school,” emphasizing that it could never be equal to UTMB. Meanwhile, the NAACP also kept the pressure on The University of Texas by finding qualified applicants to apply to other specialized graduate programs, such as engineering and mining.37\n\nIn August 1949, 3 months after he had applied to UTMB, Barnett finally received a response. President Painter notified him that he demonstrated “excellent qualification [sic]” to enter a medical school. Dean Leake added, “His credentials are in good order and he meets every requirement for entrance into the college.” Barnett would be allowed to study at UTMB in Galveston, but on a temporary, contractual basis as a student at the Texas State University for Negroes, with the understanding that he would then transfer to the Black medical school once it opened.38-40\n\nCivil rights activists hailed Barnett’s admission as a major step in integrating The University of Texas, although they recognized that it was clouded by his designation as a Texas State University for Negroes student and by a requirement for segregated accommodations.41 Barnett had to sit at a desk that was set apart from White students and colleagues. He was permitted only to see patients at Galveston Negro Hospital, the state-financed facility for Black patients at UTMB.42 Nonetheless, his first year proceeded without incident. Barnett felt accepted by his classmates and reported, “I might say here that things have progressed at such a normal pace.…In fact my every resource will be taxed to find even one unfavorable incident.”43 Barnett did well academically and ranked seventh out of a class of 162 by the end of his first year.44\n\nThe Texas State University for Negroes medical school never opened. In October 1950, without any legal action by Barnett, UTMB’s administration informed him that he would become a regular student.45 Several factors explain the reversal. First, Texas soon discovered that the costs associated with building a separate medical school would be prohibitive, as Chauncey Leake, the UTMB executive vice president and dean, had previously warned. Second, the Veterans Administration informed The University of Texas that it would not cover Barnett’s tuition and expenses under the GI Bill because the Texas State University for Negroes was not an accredited medical school. The university feared the loss of payments to future Black veterans.1(p86)46 Third, and arguably the major factor, was that in June 1950, the US Supreme Court finally adjudicated Sweatt v Painter. In a unanimous decision, the court ordered The University of Texas Law School to admit Heman Sweatt. The court held that the segregated facility the university provided did not meet the “sufficiently equal” standard in material ways, such as faculty size, library holdings, and course offerings, as well as by the intangible qualities “which make for greatness in a law school,” such as “reputation of the faculty, experience of the administration, position and influence of the alumni, standing in the community, traditions, and prestige.”47(p634) The court did not overturn Plessy v Ferguson, the 1896 “separate but equal” decision, as Thurgood Marshall had wanted; however, it did provide a strong precedent for its 1954 decision in Brown v Board of Education that explicitly reversed Plessy. In the aftermath of Sweatt, The University of Texas Board of Regents concluded that they “had no other option” than to enroll African Americans as full students at UTMB and halt plans for a segregated Black medical school.48\n\nHerman Barnett’s Legacy\n\nIn June 1953, Herman Barnett graduated from medical school with honors amid thunderous applause from his classmates.6(p537) He went on to become an accomplished physician and civic leader. He continued his pioneering presence at UTMB, becoming its first Black intern and surgical resident. After finishing his residency in 1958, he opened a private surgical practice. In 1968, he completed another residency in anesthesiology and practiced primarily in the Houston area (Figure 4). He held leadership positions in the Lone Star State Medical Association (executive committee) and the National Medical Association (board of trustees). Barnett was also the first African American person to serve on the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners and the first one to be president of the Houston School Board. Herman Barnett died on May 27, 1973, at the age of 47 years, when the plane that he was piloting crashed near Wichita, Kansas.1(p86)6,49\n\nAfter the successful medical school admissions of Edith Irby and Herman Barnett, Black civil rights activists intensified their efforts to desegregate medical education without the assistance of the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). During the late 1940s and early 1950s, Dr W. Montague Cobb, a physician-activist, demanded that the organization take a stand against segregation.50,51 The AAMC refused, arguing that it did not have jurisdiction over the policies of its member schools.52 The AAMC did not call for integration until the late 1960s.53 Despite the lack of support from the AAMC, the desegregation of medical schools continued. By 1963, 17 of the 26 medical schools that had previously barred African American students had desegregated,53(p445) and by 1968, all had done so (unpublished data).\n\nWhen Barnett carried his medical school application to the registrar’s office during the April 27, 1949, march at The University of Texas, one of his fellow demonstrators proclaimed, “We come to you as free citizens of the state of Texas claiming those things that are rightfully ours, but which we have been long denied.”2 By agreeing to desegregate UTMB, in defiance of stubborn opposition from the state of Texas, Barnett stood up for those rights. He should be remembered as an important figure in the history of medical education. The struggle for his admission to UTMB, aided by Black civil rights activists, helped breach the walls of segregation in US medical schools, paving the way for other African Americans to secure their rights.\n\nBack to top\n\nArticle Information\n\nAccepted for Publication: December 8, 2022.\n\nPublished Online: February 6, 2023. doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2022.6700\n\nCorrection: This article was corrected on March 27, 2023, to fix an error in the Herman Barnett’s Legacy subsection of the text: Herman Barnett was the first Black president (vs the first Black member) of the Houston School Board.\n\nCorresponding Author: Vanessa Northington Gamble, MD, PhD, Office of the Provost, George Washington University, 801 22nd St NW, Phillips Hall, Ste 412E, Washington, DC 20052 (vngamble@gwu.edu).\n\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Gamble had full access to all of the data in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.\n\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.\n\nAdditional Contributions: The author thanks Rachel Morse, MA, George Washington University; Molly Zepp, MD, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center; and Ellen Fitzpatrick, PhD, University of New Hampshire, for their generous assistance in the preparation of this article.
