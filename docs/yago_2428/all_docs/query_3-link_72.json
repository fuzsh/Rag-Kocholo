        "text": "Barnett History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nIreland\n\nThe present generation of the Barnett family is only the most recent to bear a name that dates back to the ancient Anglo-Saxon culture of Britain. Their name comes from having lived on or near land cleared for cultivation by burning off the forest.\n\nThe name may also have been patronymic as in \"'the son of Bernard,' or 'Barnard.' The Cistercian monk gave a wonderful impetus in the 13th century to this name, already popular. A large number of Bernards sprang up in Furness after the Abbey came under the Bernardino rule.\" 1\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Barnett family\n\nThe surname Barnett was first found in Herefordshire at Chipping Barnet, a parish, town, and the head of a union, in the hundred of Cashio. \"This place, called also High Barnet, from its situation on the summit of a hill, derives its distinguishing name from the privilege granted to the monks of St. Alban's, of holding a market here. On April 5th, 1471, the decisive battle which terminated in the defeat and death of the Earl of Warwick, and established Edward IV. on the throne, took place on Gladmore Heath, a mile north-west of the town.\" 2\n\nBarnet by the Wold is a parish, in the union of Glandford-Brigg, S. division of the wapentake of Yarborough, parts of Lindsey, Lincolnshire, East Barnet is a parish, in the union of Barnet, hundred of Cashio, Herefordshire and Fryern Barnet is a parish, in the union of Barnet, Finsbury division of the hundred of Ossulstone, county of Middlesex. \"It is supposed that an abbey anciently existed here from which the place obtained the prefix to its name, and that the old manor-house, now taken down, was the summer residence of the abbots. \" 2\n\nThe singular name Bernadus was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 in Huntingdonshire. 3 A few years later, it appeared again in Norfolk (1101-1116.) 4\n\nWith a forename, one the earliest records was that of John Barnet (d. 1373), an English bishop successively of Worcester, Bath and Wells, and Ely, and was chaplain to Thomas Lisle. 5\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Barnett family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Barnett research. Another 63 words (4 lines of text) covering the years 1400, 1760, 1799, 1806, 1807, 1816, 1820, 1836 and 1890 are included under the topic Early Barnett History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nBarnett Spelling Variations\n\nUntil the dictionary, an invention of only the last few hundred years, the English language lacked any comprehensive system of spelling rules. Consequently, spelling variations in names are frequently found in early Anglo-Saxon and later Anglo-Norman documents. One person's name was often spelled several different ways over a lifetime. The recorded variations of Barnett include Barnett, Barnette, Barnet and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Barnett family\n\nNotables of the family at this time include\n\nJames Barnett (c. 1760-1836), an English banker and Whig politician who sat in the House of Commons and a Member of Parliament for Rochester (1806-1807) and (1816-1820.)\n\nThomas Barnett (1799-1890), born in Birmingham, England, moved to Canada in the 1820s to become a museum proprietor, collector and innkeeper who managed museums and other tourist attractions in Niagar...\n\nBarnett World Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Barnett is the 275th most popular surname with an estimated 96,993 people with that name. 6 However, in Australia, the name Barnett is ranked the 355th most popular surname with an estimated 10,192 people with that name. 7 And in New Zealand, the name Barnett is the 208th popular surname with an estimated 2,701 people with that name. 8 The United Kingdom ranks Barnett as 274th with 22,066 people. 9\n\nMigration of the Barnett family to Ireland\n\nSome of the Barnett family moved to Ireland, but this topic is not covered in this excerpt.\n\nAnother 71 words (5 lines of text) about their life in Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nBarnett migration to the United States +\n\nThousands of English families boarded ships sailing to the New World in the hope of escaping the unrest found in England at this time. Although the search for opportunity and freedom from persecution abroad took the lives of many because of the cramped conditions and unsanitary nature of the vessels, the opportunity perceived in the growing colonies of North America beckoned. Many of the settlers who survived the journey went on to make important contributions to the transplanted cultures of their adopted countries. The Barnett were among these contributors, for they have been located in early North American records:\n\nBarnett Settlers in United States in the 17th Century\n\nJohn Barnett, who landed in Virginia in 1620 aboard the ship \"Jonathan\" 10\n\nThomas Barnett, aged 16, who landed in Virginia in 1620 aboard the ship \"Elizabeth\" 10\n\nWilliam Barnett, who arrived in Virginia in 1622 aboard the ship \"Truelove\", died by 1625 10\n\nJohn Barnett, who landed in America in 1624 10\n\nRich Barnett, who landed in Virginia in 1635 10\n\n...

They made many attempts but failed in some to establish settlements on the Islands including Saint Lucia and Grenada. By 1627 they had managed to establish settlements on St. Kitts (St. Christopher) and Barbados, but by 1641 the Spanish had moved in and destroyed some of these including those at Providence Island. The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts. After this a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association. 18\n\nBarnett Settlers in West Indies in the 17th Century\n\nJo Barnett, aged 20, who arrived in Barbados in 1635 10\n\nNathaniel] Barnett, who arrived in Jamaica in 1685 10\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Barnett (post 1700) +\n\nCorrelli Douglas Barnett CBE FRHistS FRSL (1927-2022), English military historian, historical consultant and writer for the BBC television series The Great War (1963–64)\n\nThomas Andrew Barnett (1936-2022), English professional footballer who played as a winger (1957-1977)\n\nGeoffrey Colin \"Geoff\" Barnett (1946-2021), English footballer who played as a goalkeeper.from 1962 through 1980\n\nJoel Barnett (b. 1923), Baron Barnett, English politician, Chief Secretary to the Treasury (1974-1979), Member of Parliament for Heywood and Royton (1964-1983)\n\nSamuel Augustus Barnett (1844-1913), English religious leader and activist\n\nCharlie Barnett (1910-1993), English cricketer\n\nMichael Barnett AM (1946-2023), Australian politician, Member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly from 1974 to 1996, representing the seat of Rockingham, Speaker of the Legislative Assembly from 1986 to 1993\n\nCarol Jenkins Barnett (1956-2021), American philanthropist and businesswoman, the daughter of George W.
