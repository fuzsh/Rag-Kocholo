He currently resides in his van here just south of Adrian in Fairfield with a family that has adopted him while he was in school. They influenced his life to be responsible and patient, which therefore influenced his work ethic in the shop. When he was 13, he started a small lawn/light landscaping business as the “Backyard Barber.” He began this business with a $50 push mower. After 7 years, the business grew and eventually Logan owned a full set up with all of the modern day equipment. With a few years of doing odd jobs with lawns and landscapes, he gained a deep interest in gardens but specifically sustainable gardens and agriculture. After graduating high school in 2022, Logan took a gap year. During that time, he found the Wood Design program and enrolled immediately after a visit. He is a curious student seeking hand skills and knowledge in all crafts fields.\n\nLearn More About the Wood Design: Furniture Making Program\n\nGRADUATE INTERN\n\nARMANDO COVARRUBIAS JR.\n\nArmando Covarrubias Jr is a furniture maker originally from Arrey, New Mexico. After many years working in the food science and agriculture industry with his family, he made the decision to change careers and attend the Wood Design: Furniture Making program at Sam Beauford Woodworking Institute. He builds custom-made furniture by combining hand tools, craftsmanship, and modern machinery. He has always loved working with his hands. He spent most of his life working on his family farm in the chili fields or building and welding farm equipment for their manufacturing facilities. This lifestyle naturally accommodated to a strong sense of community, and Armando developed patience to watch a seed grow into a fully matured crop. An organic career transition for him was furniture making with a lot of the same principles he has always been so drawn towards. Moving forward, he aspires to design and build commission furniture.\n\nLearn More About the Wood Design: Furniture Making Program\n\nView Armando’s Upcoming Courses\n\nDIRECTOR OF WOMEN’S PROGRAMMING & INSTRUCTOR\n\nSHERI K.

Residing in Blissfield, Michigan, with his wife Brenda Gayle, whom he married in 1975, Frank is a family man with two sons and is a proud grandfather to three granddaughters and a grandson.\n\nFrank's academic journey is marked by excellence. He graduated with honors from St. Francis De Sales High School in Toledo, Ohio, in 1965. He furthered his education at Kettering University, earning a mechanical engineering degree with a plant engineering major and graduating with honors in 1970. His quest for knowledge continued with courses at the University of Toledo and the University of Wisconsin.\n\nHis professional life began at General Motors Corporation, where he worked from 1965 to 1982. During his 16-year tenure, he held various roles such as Mechanical/Electrical Engineer, Packaging Engineer, Architectural/Mechanical Engineer, and Supervisor in the Industrial Engineering Department.\n\nIn 1979, Frank embarked on an entrepreneurial journey by founding Riverbend Timber Framing Inc., becoming the owner of North America's largest custom timber frame/insulated panel building system fabricator. He served as CEO until July 2007. His ventures expanded with the founding of Midwest Panel Systems, also known as Great Lakes Insulspan, in 1990 and the co-founding of Insulspan Inc. in 1994. Frank's strategic vision led to the merger of Riverbend TF and Insulspan with PFB Corporation, Canada, in 2004. He retired from his presidency in 2007 and served on the PFB Corporation Board of Directors until 2018.\n\nFrank's influence extends beyond his business ventures. He is a charter member and past president of the Structural Insulated Panel Association, the Timber Frame Business Council, and the Timber Framers Guild. His commitment to sustainable building practices is evident in his roles within various organizations, including the Net Zero Energy Coalition, the Building Systems Council of the National Association of Homebuilders, and the US Green Building Council.\n\nHis community involvement is equally impressive. Frank has contributed to the Blissfield Revitalization Committee, served as the chairman of the Blissfield Planning Commission, and been a board member of the Blissfield Historical Society. His passion for renewable energy is reflected in his membership in the Michigan Solar Energy Association and the Toledo Solar Opportunities League. A believer in giving back, he has been involved in local sports as a coach and supports Habitat for Humanity.\n\nFrank's current community service includes roles in the Blissfield Rotary Club, Lakeside Wooden Boat Society, Lakeside Environmental Stewardship Society, and the Lakeside Heritage Society. His dedication to community and environmental stewardship makes him a respected and inspirational figure in both professional and personal realms."
