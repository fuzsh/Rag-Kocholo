        "text": "The Windermere clergyman, Hardwicke Drummond Rawnsley, wrote this sonnet shortly after attending the 1885 unveiling of an outdoor mosaic attached to the clock tower of St. Jude’s Anglican Church in Whitechapel, East London. The mosaic was a reproduction of G. F. Watts’s allegorical painting, Time, Death and Judgement (1870). Watts later donated versions of this painting to be hung in St. Paul’s Cathedral and at the Tate Gallery, but what excited Rawnsley was the prospect of exhibiting such an artwork on the street, and especially on a “grim, unlovely” street. He saw great spiritualizing potential in the public art object, as did the vicar of St. Jude’s Church, the Rev. Samuel Barnett. This chapter considers how and why Barnett—also founder of the university settlement movement, a residential organization established to reconnect graduates with their poorer urban brothers, and of the prominent East London settlement house, Toynbee Hall—sought to sacralize the streets of his Whitechapel parish through the public display of objects such as the Watts mosaic. Along with his wife, Henrietta, Barnett proposed that religious images and objects should be brought to East London so that the urban poor might rediscover their spiritual selves. In the early 1880s, he founded the yearly Whitechapel Fine Art Exhibitions, forerunner of today’s Whitechapel Art Gallery, to bring well-known artists’ work to the East End. Historians have commented on the connection between art and religion in Barnett’s philanthropic work, but this scholarship has focused on the images themselves and on their display in indoor exhibition spaces such as St. Jude’s School, host to the Whitechapel Fine Art Exhibitions.2\n\nI passed in dear, unenviable thought\n\nDown grim, unlovely streets, and half amazed,\n\nI saw a crowd who on a picture gazed.\n\nOf coloured marble curiously enwrought.\n\nHere Time went free, but ah! his hand was caught\n\nBy Death, who followed hard; his balance raised,\n\nWherein the deeds of men are all appraised,\n\nWas Judgment close and ever closer brought.\n\n“Death! hold Time fast!” the sorrowing thousands cried,\n\n“Without thee Life was insupportable,\n\nAnd with the scales of Judgement, and the sword\n\nTrice welcome.” At the cry, gates opened wide,\n\nAnd through the doors I heard the preacher tell\n\nOf one more stronger than Time—Love, Judge, and the Lord.\n\nUntitled, Hardwicke Drummond Rawnsley, 18851"
