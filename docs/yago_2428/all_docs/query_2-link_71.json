        "text": "Augusta, Georgia – Ivey Ann Jernigan Barnett, 85, died Saturday, June 1, 2024.\n\nIvey Ann Jernigan Barnett was born on May 27, 1939 and grew up in Newton, Georgia where she spent many hours and summer afternoons skiing on the Flint River. From birth through her high school years, she was known as Ann.\n\nShe attended Mitchell County High School in neighboring Camilla where she had fond memories of twirling her baton (especially with it on fire!) under the Friday night lights of the Mitchell County football games. She was very proud of her Buick convertible (with Ann inscribed on the side) which could be spotted all over Baker and Mitchell counties. Although her life took her away from South Georgia, she never lost her love for that area, and for many years, longtime friends shipped a box of Mayhaw jelly to her which she considered precious as gold. If she ever shared it with you then you were indeed a very dear friend.\n\nShe traded in her Buick for a white 1958 Thunderbird coupe when she left Newton to go to Athens and the University of Georgia. She said, “I loved my social life more than my classes!” She was a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority, and it was a common sight to see her driving her Kappa sisters around in the Thunderbird. In 1961, while still attending UGA, she married Stephen Trent Barnett III of Atlanta, a fellow student and a member of Phi Delta Theta fraternity, and they were married for 28 years. Steve began to call her Ivey instead of Ann and from that time on all her friends knew her as Ivey. Her daughters always knew if a friend called her Ann then they were part of her life before college and marriage, but if they called her Ivey, it was a friend from her later life.\n\nIn June of 1962, she was graduated from the University of Georgia with a teaching degree. Ivey was a beloved teacher and taught for many years in Coweta, Baker, and Volusia Counties.\n\nAs a young bride, she and Steve made their home in Atlanta. As they began to have children, they moved to Newnan where they lived for many years and raised their three daughters, Katherine, Ivey, and Allie.\n\nIn 2006, Ivey moved to Augusta and resided at St John Towers where she became involved in the Resident's Association and participated in many fundraising activities. She was always elegant (considered a “fashionista”) and was a participant in the Ms. St. Johns Towers Beauty Pageant winning \"Most Inspirational\" contestant. Ivey became a “work mother” to several staff members at St. John Towers. Ivey made friends easily—she “never met a stranger” and was loved by many people from many walks of life. When Ivey smiled, she lit up a room and her laughter was infectious!\n\nHer friends described her as sweet, kind, lovely, and generous. Throughout her life, Ivey’s friends always looked to her for decorating advice and help because “she had a great eye,” and she was always ready to take on a new decorating project. Ivey helped many friends and neighbors decorate and beautify their apartments, and she could be relied upon to clean-out and organize everything! She especially liked to go to estate sales and antique stores after which she would return and proudly display her “damn good deal!”\n\nElvis was her favorite musician, and she would immediately start dancing when she heard his music. In her early years, she played the trumpet and solo sax in the band.\n\nIvey was very proud of her three daughters and their individual talents. Her face beamed when she spoke of them. Additionally, she was proudest of her grandchildren. She would brag to all her friends and acquaintances about each one and loved showing off photographs of PT, Sara Ivey, Trent, Mac, and Jack.\n\nPlease join family and friends for a Celebration of Life which will be held on Saturday, July 20, 2024 from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM at the home of Kat and George McCall, 2206 Morningside Drive, Augusta.\n\nIvey Ann Jernigan Barnett is survived by her children: Katherine Barnett McCall (Kat), and husband George Samuel McCall II, Ivey Barnett Fulmer, and husband Preston Thomas Fulmer Jr., Sarah Allen Balling (Allie), and husband Mark Paul Balling. Grandchildren: George Samuel McCall III (Mac), Stephen Trent McCall, Sara Ivey Fulmer, Preston Thomas Fulmer III (PT), and Jackson Wyatt Balling. Former husband: Stephen Trent Barnett III. Grand dog: Dexter Balling. Her parents preceded her in death: Hurley Clifton Jernigan and Katherine Louise Whitlock Jernigan.\n\n“Now the laborer's task is o’er;\n\nNow the battle-day is past;\n\nNow upon the farther shore\n\nLands the voyager at last.”\n\n-John Ellerton"
