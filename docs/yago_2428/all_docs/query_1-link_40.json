        "text": "Toynbee Hall, pioneering social settlement in the East End of London. It was founded on Commercial Street, Whitechapel (now in Tower Hamlets), in 1884 by the canon Samuel Augustus Barnett and named for the 19th-century English social reformer Arnold Toynbee. During his early years at St. Jude’s Church, Barnett invited members of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge to the impoverished working-class district of Whitechapel for holidays to learn about social conditions; his subsequent plan to found a house of residence for graduates wishing to live in an industrial area and to contribute to its life was well supported. With money collected mainly at Oxford, he purchased and reconstructed premises next to St. Jude’s; and with his settlers he began the work of participation in local life, development of adult education, collection of social data, and improvement of local social and industrial conditions.\n\nToynbee Hall has continued to serve London’s East End via such offerings as a citizens’ advice bureau, a free legal advice centre, aid for invalid children, help for alcoholics, a welfare service for the elderly, and theatres for adults and for children. It has undertaken the teaching of adult immigrants and has housed various social and cultural associations. Toynbee Hall was also where John Profumo, the Conservative secretary of state for war who resigned in 1963 amid a sex scandal that became known as the Profumo affair, washed dishes in an attempt to rebuild his reputation."
