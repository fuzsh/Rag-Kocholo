        "text": "Elizabeth BARNETT married (1805) Eleazer LAZARUS (son of Yoseph of Worms) of Chiswell Street. No father's name is recorded for Elizabeth (synagoguescribes Great Synagogue marriages).\n\nEleazer LAZARUS died in 1825. In 1841 Elizabeth is with her adult children (Joseph LAZARUS is Head) and with them also is 13-yr-old Eleazer JACOBS. With Elizabeth in the 1851 and 1861 censuses is Isabella JACOBS, born c.1836.\n\nI am trying to work out if and how Eleazer and Isabella JACOBS are related, and more particularly, how they're related to Elizabeth LAZARUS nee BARNETT.\n\nAs far as I can work out, 'my' Eleazer JACOBS is the one in this family in the 1851 Census:\n\nJacob Jacobs 68 General Dealer born city Houndsditch\n\nborn Middx Spitalfields:\n\nHannah Jacobs 61\n\nMoses Jacobs 25 General Dealer\n\nEleazer Jacobs 19 Slipper Maker\n\nThis in turn corresponds to a 1852 Great Synagogue marriage between Eleazer/Eliezer b Jacob and Dinah KIZAR. By 1860 they were in the United States.\n\nIsabella JACOBS is harder to nail down. Whichever family she belongs to, it almost certainly isn't Eleazer JACOB's, though they could of course be cousins. She is very possibly the same Isabella JACOBS who married Abraham SAMUELS in 1868. (Abraham was born in Chatham, Kent. The rest are from London)\n\nNo relatives turn up in census records with either Isabella or Eleazer after these marriages to give clues about their families. I haven't ordered marriage certificates yet.\n\nWhat I REALLY want to know is, who was Eleazer LAZARUS (remember him?). I'm not sure that know who the JACOBS families are, or how they're related to each other and to Elizabeth, will help me work that out, but it's about the only trail I haven't followed yet. Eleazer LAZARUS had been in partnership with a Samuel COHEN that was ended in 1815, but I haven't been able to find out any more about this person.\n\nAny help with this lot would be most appreciated.\n\nPhil, as always, you're a brick. No, wait...smasher of bricks! (I was waiting for you to respond, in fact.) I didn't have any of that data, or not from the sources you mention. Not sure I'll have time to follow it up now (about to leave the country for 6 weeks), but I'm going to make note of it all - and try not to get distracted from packing!\n\nI think you've found more information than I had about Eleazer LAZARUS and COHEN. If you can find out more about Eleazer's origins/natal family, I will be very thankful, if only to eliminate him from what I think is a single Lazarus tribe of families dispersed by the early 1800s - to Exeter, London, Portsmouth and possibly Birmingham.\n\nShould add that I believe Eleazer's father was Yosepha/Yespe/Joseph of Worms and that Eleazer had a sister Betsy who married Elia JACOBS of Rosemary Lane (I think you may already have this - from Synagoguescribe). My focus on Eleazer is because two of his sons married sisters from Exeter. Joseph LAZARUS married Caroline DAVIS and Benjamin married Caroline's sister Priscilla. Joseph was elected as Deputy for Exeter. This may all have nothing to do with my Exeter Lazarus family (who were very active as congregation members at the time). Once Joseph married Caroline (however that connection came about), that would lead easily to his brother marrying her sister and perhaps also make him a good choice to represent Exeter to the board of Deputies. In fact, I think one or more of my LAZARUS family objected to him being chosen, but that can happen in the best of families (and as I recall, the member was wanting the post himself). But what I'm trying to do is work which of all the connected-by-marriage/business LAZARUS families have multiple connections and which are peripheral/coincidental and can be eliminated from a possible single family tribe.\n\nA (minor?) puzzle about Eleazer's life. Eleazer and Elizabeth married in 1805. Of their children I know of one who died in 1813 and three others born by 1815. Then there's a gap of six years before the births of at least seven children born between about 1821-1826. (Joseph is head of the household in 1841. With him are his mother and his younger siblings.) So where was he/where are any kids born between 1815 and 1821? (I thought he'd been shipped of to Australia, but that was someone else who ended up staying there.)\n\nAnother point: Eleazer had been previously married (1802) to Maria (Merle bat Jacob Aharon KZ) COHEN. Were Maria COHEN, wife, and Samuel COHEN, business partner, related? (Does this tell me any more about who Eleazer was, or is it a red herring?)"
