        "text": "[1894] Barnett, Rev. Canon [Samuel Augustus] (1844-1913). The Ideal City. Bristol, Eng.: Arrowsmith. Rpt. in The Ideal City. Ed. Helen E. Meller (Leicester, Eng.: Leicester University Press, 1979), 55-66 with a â€œNote to The Ideal City (47-53). L, O\n\nEutopia that the author argues is possible. Stress on variety but no very rich or poor. Religion, education, health. Outlines how England could become such a eutopia, with Bristol the specific city being considered. See also Samuel [Augustus] Barnett and Henrietta Barnett, Practicable Socialism: Essays on Social Reform. London: Longmans, Green, 1888. Rpt. in 1894 and 1915. The author was the founder with his wife Henrietta of Toynbee Hall in the East End of London where people from higher classes lived in one of the poorest areas of the city and were responsible for the development of Hampshire Garden Suburb. Toynbee Hall still exists in Tower Hamlets, still among the poorest areas of London, but without the same intent."
