Among other subjects, his work studied autolysis of tumours, gastric juice in diseases of the stomach, and coagulation.\n\nBiography\n\nSamuel Barnett Schryver was born in London to Jewish parents Lewis and Elisabeth Schryver. He was educated at the University College School, before going on to study at University College London, the Zurich Polytechnikum, and the University of Leipzig, graduating with a Ph.D. from the latter institution. He worked as Demonstrator in Chemistry at University College Liverpool from 1893 until 1897, and then as a researcher at the Wellcome Research Laboratories until March 1901, when he was appointed Lecturer in Physiological Chemistry at University College London.\n\nIn 1907 Schryver began working as a chemist at the Research Institute of the Cancer Hospital, and in 1913 joined the faculty of the Imperial College of Science, becoming full Professor in 1920.
