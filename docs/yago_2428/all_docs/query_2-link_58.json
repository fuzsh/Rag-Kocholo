Barnett Wilks - Obituary\n\nDIED, on the evening of the 10th of March, at her husband's residence in Hardeman county, Tenn., NEAMAH M. WILKS, consort of Joseph Wilks, and daughter of Rev. William Barnet Deceased. The deceased was one of the fortunate who enjoyed the invaluable blessing of early religious tuition; being under the supervision and instruction of pious parents, moral restraints were thrown around her. Nurtured at the very door of the sanctuary, she was early impressed with the principles of virtue and piety which were strikingly evinced in her conduct and department through life. Scarce had she approached the years of maturity, before, as an evidence of the fidelity of her parents in the impartation of religious instruction and in answer to their prayers, she embraced the religion of Christ, and united with the Cumberland Presbyterian church, in the communion of which, she lived an exemplary life until called to the church triumphant, to join the redeemed millions who have ceased from their labors while their works do follow them.\n\nSuch was the nature of her disease, that for four days she was deprived of reason (that was the term of her sickness) and her friends could not converse satisfactory with her; yet they were confident from the manner of her life that her death was victorious, and her passage to the skies triumphant and glorious. She left a companion, seven children and many relations to weep over one much beloved. Yet in their sorrow they have hope.\n\nThen, husband, children and relations, weep no more. Sister Neamah M. Wilks still lives, not upon earth, but in the midst of the spirits of the just made perfect, around the throne of God; and for aught know, may be beside her sainted father in that bright world, gazing on the uncreated glory of him who washed her and made her white in his own blood. And though she will no more come to you on earth, you may go to her in glory. Then as you have loved her on earth, Oh meet her in heaven.\n\nA FRIEND\n\n[Source: Banner of Peace, April 23, 1847, page 3]\n\nDr. R. B. Whitaker - Obituary\n\nSan Antonio, Texas.--The West End Church sustained a heavy loss, April 26, in the death of Dr. R. B. Whitaker, an elder in the congregation and brother-in-law of the pastor, Rev. H. F. Perry. Rev. E. E. Moody, pastor of the First Church, writes: I was a classmate of Dr. Whitaker in Cumberland University and know that there, as later in a medical college in New York City, he distinguished himself as a capable and faithful student. Broken health and an untimely death cut short a career that promised to be brilliant and beneficent. He died ere he had reached his 26th birthday. His remains were carried by Mr. Perry to Kentucky for burial. The session of the West End Church granted the pastor a vacation until June 1. In the meantime his salary will be continued and the session will conduct the regular services. Few churches are more substantial and can boast of a more phenomenal growth than this. It was organized with a membership of fifty-one from the First Church November 26, 1893. Of this number more than forty were converts under the faithful ministry of Mr. Perry.\n\n[Source: The Cumberland Presbyterian, May 10, 1894, page 661]\n\nPlease Send Additions/Corrections to the Archives Updated March 5, 2014"
