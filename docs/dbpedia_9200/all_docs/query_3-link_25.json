        "text": "The Red Ensign of Newfoundland was the flag used to represent the Dominion of Newfoundland. The flag filling its top left quadrant is the United Kingdom’s Union Flag. The circle at right is the Great Seal of Newfoundland.\n\nThe Great Seal of Newfoundland, used here as a symbol of the Dominion of Newfoundland, is still used today with some minor adjustments. It is now called “The Great Seal of Newfoundland and Labrador,” to reflect the province’s official name. The seal features Britannia, the personification of Great Britain, on the right. In the centre is Mercury, the Roman god of commerce and merchants. On the left, a fisherman kneels and offers his catch to Britannia. The scroll across the top reads “terra nova,” Latin for “new world.” Across the bottom are the words “hæc tibi dona fero,” which is Latin for “these gifts I bring to thee.”"
