        "text": "The Raven Banner c800\n\nArchaeological evidence of a Norse settlement was found in L'Anse aux Meadows on Newfoundland. It is very unlikely that the Viking explorers used any flags at all. Since the Vikings left few writing records of their explorations except those found in the famous Norse Sagas where no flags were mentioned. However, the Raven Banner (Guðfani) is the most commonly reported Norse \"flag\" and it is possible that it might have been brought to Newfoundland. We do know that Viking explorers like Bjarni Herjulfesson, Helge Ingstad, Eric the Red, and Leif Ericsson all played a part in the early exploration of Newfoundland between AD 800-1000, but again there is no historical documentation to support the assumption that Raven Banner or any other flag was used.\n\nMost flag historians believe the Guðfani banner was not a banner, but a semi-circular metal vexilla ornamented with streamers. It was actually a metal wind vane used on ships to gauge the direction and strength of the wind. The \"tails\" were narrow ribbons attached to it to give early indication of wind changes.\n\nThe French Fisheries\n\nNewfoundland has always been called \"England's oldest colony\" in Canada based on the arrival of John Cabot in 1497 and Sir Humphrey Gilbert's claim in 1583, but from the very beginning, France was also an important participant in the exploration and exploitation of Newfoundland. Although the French explorer Jacques Cartier arrived in 1534, Breton, Norman and Basque fishermen had already been fishing in Newfoundland's waters for over thirty years.\n\nAt first, the French fishermen concentrated on fishing close to shore in open boats. But by the middle of the 1500s, the French were also fishing on the offshore banks. This would remained so well into the 19th century fulfilling a need for fish for both the domestic and international French markets. It was the ability of the Labrador and Newfoundland fishing grounds to provide a rich variety of fish that contributed to the longevity and continued French presence in Newfoundland.\n\nFrench fishermen could be found in many parts of Newfoundland. The southern half of Newfoundland, from Cape Race west beyond Placentia Bay, was one region heavily populated by the French. The French colony at Placentia (Plaisance) was established in 1662 along with numerous other tiny settlements in the area. The region along the coast north of Bonavista and particularly the coast of the Northern Peninsula came to be called the Petit Nord, or the \"French Shore.\" A third region was the western coast of Newfoundland is where the French Basques made their own special domain. In the 17th-century Newfoundland was actually more French than it was English. Even today in St. Pierre and Miquelon, one finds remnants of the French settlements still listed as an overseas department of France.\n\nNewfoundland Natives' Society 1840-c1860\n\nThe Newfoundland Natives' Society (NNS), a non-denominational organization founded in 1840 \"to protect the rights and privileges of Newfoundland-born citizens against the flood of newcomers to the island in the mid-nineteenth century\", provided Newfoundland with one of its earliest versions of a \"native\" tricolor flag. The NNS's first silk flag (not shown) is clearly documented. It had a elaborate shield centered on it depicting aspects of Newfoundland life. There were clasped hands above the shield and the words \"Union and Philanthropy\" below it. The whole flag had a red background.\n\nThis original red silk flag was replaced at some time before 1852 with this red, white and green tricolor, these being the official colors of the Society. These Red-White-Green flags were displayed at NNS events throughout the 1850s-1860s. It was this tricolor, the Native red, white and green flag, that became the first widely recognized and unique flag of Newfoundland, and many now accept this as the first flag of Newfoundland.\n\nGovernment House Flag c1862\n\nAlthough the usual flag to fly on the Government House in St. John's would probably have been the Union Jack, this flag was shown on the Government House in a book of water-colors made in 1862 called The \"Corrected Code of Merchant's Signals\". It was most likely a \"Governor's Flag\" used in the 1860s before the introduction of the defaced Union Jacks in 1870.\n\nIn 1870 one Royal Governor wrote to the Colonial Office saying he would discontinue use of the old Governor's Flag which was described as \"a St. George's Cross with crown in the center on a white ground\", most likely referring to a flag similar as shown here.\n\nThe Newfoundland Tricolor c1880\n\nThe flag commonly presented as the Newfoundland Tricolor, or the \"Green, White and Pink\", is a traditional flag very popular in the Newfoundland and Labrador area, but has never been \"officially\" recognized in any way by the government. Popular tradition claims it was originated in the 1880s or 1890s as the flag of a Roman Catholic fraternal group named \"The Star of the Sea Association\" (founded 1871) in St. John's. It is one of the few recognized flags in the world to use the color pink (occasionally called rose) in its design. Many times, although normally displayed in a \"Green, White, & Pink\" pattern, it also is mirrored or reversed into a \"Pink, White, & Green&quot: pattern.\n\nPopular local legend says that the flag was created in 1843 by Bishop Michael Fleming as an attempt to bring peace between local competing Protestants and Catholics. Apparently the two groups competed to supply wood to the local churches, schools and other charity institutions. The Protestant English marked their wood piles the rose flag of the Natives Society, while the Catholic Irish used green banners. The threat of violence was such that the Speaker of the House, William Carson, suggested that Bishop Fleming should be enlisted as a peacemaker. Bishop Fleming persuaded the two factions to adopt a common flag, tying together the rose and green flags of the two groups with a white centerband, which was to symbolize peace. This story is based on oral tradition with no actual historical evidence to support it.\n\nAlthough the origins of the flag are not clear, it has become a popular regional flag with wide usage. Over the years variant versions have defaced the original design by adding shield and symbols, usually in the center white band as illustrated in the variants added here. The first variant shown comes from the cover of the 1984 Encyclopedia of Newfoundland. It was also pictured earlier in the first edition cover of the sheet music of the \"Ode to Newfoundland\", an alternative Newfoundland \"national\" anthem written by Sir Charles Cavendish Boyle in 1901.\n\nThe second variant appeared after a political controversy in Newfoundland, when the Premier ordered the removal of the national flag from government offices for a while, and since then has been seen displayed around the island. The badge used on it is from the Newfoundland Red and Blue Ensigns of 1904.\n\n. The Newfoundland Red and Blue Ensigns 1904-1965\n\nThe Red Ensign was officially endorsed by King Charles II in 1674; this authorization recognized it as the ensign of English merchant shipping. Later, during the Victorian era, the flag with colonial badge formed the basis as the Colony of Newfoundland's civil ensign.\n\nThe Red and Blue Ensigns with the Great Seal of Newfoundland in the fly were the dominion's official flags from 1904 until 1931, after which the Union Jack was adopted as Newfoundland's official national flag and the ensigns reserved for shipping and marine identification - the Red Ensign to be flown by merchant shipping while the blue was flown by governmental ships.\n\nThe badge in the ensigns consists of Mercury, the god of commerce and merchandise, presenting to Britannia a fisherman who, in a kneeling attitude, is offering the harvest of all the sea. Above the device in a scroll are the Latin words Terra Nova, and below the motto Hæc Tibi Dona Fero or \"These gifts I bring thee.\" The seal was redesigned by Adelaine Lane, niece of Governor Sir Cavendish Boyle.\n\nThe Flag of Franco-Terreneuviens\n\nThe flag of the Fédération des Francophones de Terre-Neuve et du Labrador is based on the French tricolor and Acadian flag, with three unequal panels of blue, white, and red. Two yellow sails are set on the line between the white and red panels. The sail on top is charged with a spruce twig, while the bottom sail is charged with a pitcher flower. These emblems are outlined in black.\n\nThe sails represent early Basque, Breton, and French fishermen that came to the area in 1504. At the same time, they are symbols of action and progress. The yellow is taken from the star of the Acadian flag. The spruce twig is the emblem of Labrador and is also found on the Labrador flag. Newfoundland and Labrador's provincial flower is the insect-eating pitcher plant.\n\nThe Flag of Newfoundland and Labrador 1980\n\nAs a former colony and then dominion of the United Kingdom, Newfoundland gave up its independence in 1933. It became the tenth province to enter the Canadian Confederation on March 31, 1949, as \"Newfoundland.\" On December 6, 2001, an amendment was made to the Constitution of Canada to change the province's official name to \"Newfoundland and Labrador.\"\n\nIn 1980, a Newfoundland artist named Christopher Pratt, designed this flag for a special flag committee that had been selected to find a new design for Newfoundland and Labrador. Ultimately it was chosen by the House of Assembly, then was given royal assent in June of 1980, and raised for the first time on June 24, Discovery Day, the anniversary of the arrival in Newfoundland of John Cabot in 1497."
