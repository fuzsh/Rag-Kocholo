        "text": "Whether Newfoundland and Labrador should remain as an independent political entity, or join the federation of the other British North American colonies, was an issue from 1864 to 1949. In 1864, Newfoundland delegates attended the Quebec Conference and signed the resolutions which became of foundation of the 1867 British North America Act. But it was not until over 80 years later, in 1949, that Newfoundland became a Canadian province.\n\nConfederation Election\n\nActive debate in the colony during the 1860s culminated in the hard-fought “confederation election” of 1869, won by the anti-confederates in a landslide victory.\n\nWilliam V. Whiteway, ca. early 1900s\n\nWhiteway was an avowed confederate in 1869.\n\nPhoto by Lafayette Ltd.

The election was so decisive that the idea of confederation was set aside - indeed, it became a dirty word in many circles. Thus Newfoundland became the only British North American colony to try the experiment of independence (within the British Empire).\n\nConcerns Between Newfoundland and Canada\n\nAs neighbours, Newfoundland and Canada had to negotiate and settle a wide range of issues of mutual concern over the years. Fisheries, trade, relations with the USA, the Labrador boundary and defence were among the most important. Sometimes, between 1869 and the second World War, confederation was raised as a possibility, but only once, in 1895, were there serious negotiations. These failed because neither Newfoundland nor Canada were much interested at that time.\n\nAlfred B. Morine (1857-1944), n.d.\n\nIn the late 1890s Morine, Newfoundland's Finance Minister, supported confederation.\n\nPhotographer unknown. From Henry Youmans Mott Newfoundland Men (Concord, NH: T.W. & J.F. Cragg, 1894) 21. Print.\n\nNewfoundland and Confederation\n\nWith the collapse of responsible government in 1934, followed by War II, Newfoundland entered a new phase in its history, and in its relationship with Canada. By 1945, the Canadians were coming to the conclusion that incorporating Newfoundland into confederation made sense. The British government thought the same. And the referendums held in 1948 showed that a majority of Newfoundlanders now agreed as well. But the vote had been preceded by a long, tense and divisive debate, and was followed by a difficult period of transition. Finally, on 31 March 1949, Newfoundlanders became Canadian citizens. How that happened has been debated ever since.\n\nVersion française\n\nDocumentary Videos\n\nThe Winding Road to Confederation Part I: The 1869 Election\n\nThe Winding Road to Confederation Part II: Relations with Canada, 1870-1939\n\nThe Winding Road to Confederation Part III: The War Years, 1939-1945\n\nThe Winding Road to Confederation Part IV: The National Convention, 1946-1948\n\nThe Winding Road to Confederation Part V: The 1948 Referendums"
