        "text": "History\n\nThe Aboriginal inhabitants of Newfoundland and Labrador were the Beothuk. Archaeological evidence suggests that the Beothuk inhabited Newfoundland long before European colonization and that they may have been descended from earlier people who occupied the island for several thousand years.\n\nAt the time of European contact, the Beothuk occupied at least the south and northeast coasts of Newfoundland, numbering perhaps no more than 500 to 1,000 people. By the early 1800s, disease and conflicts with settlers and others frequenting the island led to their extinction.\n\nThere were, and still are, a relatively large number of Inuit concentrated in the coastal communities of Northern Labrador.\n\nThe first Europeans to visit Newfoundland were Norsemen who are thought to have arrived in the 10th century. Other early visitors – the Basques, Portuguese, Spanish, British and French – staged fishing expeditions in the 16th century and possibly earlier.\n\nThe Genoese navigator Giovanni Caboto, known as John Cabot, landed on the island on June 24, 1497, on the feast of St. John the Baptist. Cabot called the new land “St. John's Isle” in honour of the saint.\n\nIn 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert reasserted England’s claim to the Island of Newfoundland and the surrounding seas for Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nIn 1610, a group of merchants under King James I tried to establish a permanent settlement at what is now Cupids on the coast of Conception Bay. This was the first recorded attempt to establish a formal English colony in present-day Canada.\n\nAnglo-French colonial warfare shaped the history of the province during the 17th and 18th centuries. France, already well-established on the mainland of Eastern Canada, began to make claims to parts of Newfoundland. In 1662, France established a fort and colony at Placentia, despite protests from British merchants and fishermen. The Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 ended a long period of raids and confrontations by both nations; it also reconfirmed British sovereignty over Newfoundland and the fishing banks.\n\nThe Seven Years’ War (1756–1763) saw a resurgence in hostilities between England and France. However, with the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1763, British sovereignty was again recognized.\n\nIn 1832, the people of Newfoundland were granted the right to vote for an elected assembly. However, conflict between the assembly and the appointed council led to the collapse of the colonial government by 1841. In 1847, the British government decided to revert to a separate assembly and council, although the council was not made responsible to the assembly for its actions. After much debate, Newfoundland was finally given responsible government in 1855.\n\nNewfoundland sent observers to the Québec Conference in 1864, but postponed its decision on whether or not to join the Union. Confederation became the major issue in the general election in Newfoundland in 1869, but the concept did not gain popular approval.\n\nBy 1933, the Great Depression, combined with other factors, brought the Newfoundland government close to bankruptcy. Newfoundland, a dominion within the Commonwealth, asked the British government to suspend the legislature. A governor and a six-member Commission of Government ruled Newfoundland from 1934 to 1949.\n\nAfter World War II, the question of Newfoundland’s future status became an issue once again. In 1948, a public referendum was held on two options: retention of the Commission of Government or a return to the 1934 status as a dominion within the Commonwealth. However, a vigorous popular movement forced British authorities to include a third referendum option: union with Canada.\n\nFollowing two referenda, confederation with Canada won with 52 percent of the vote. On March 31, 1949, Newfoundland became the tenth province of Canada. In December 2001, the province of Newfoundland became officially the province of Newfoundland and Labrador following the adoption of an amendment to the Constitution of Canada.\n\nOther provincial symbols\n\nAnimals\n\nThe Newfoundland dog and Newfoundland pony are well-known symbols of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador.\n\nThe Newfoundland dog is famed for its bravery, gentle temperament and strong swimming abilities. It has a stiff, oily outer coat and a fleecy undercoat that allows it to adapt to harsh, wet conditions. Because of their physique, Newfoundland dogs were frequent companions aboard fishing vessels, where they helped to haul nets, and retrieve objects and persons from the water. Because of their size and their life-saving instincts, they can easily pull drowning persons to safety. Their lung capacity enables them to swim long distances while fighting powerful ocean currents.\n\nNewfoundland dogs have proven to be useful on land as well. Capable of pulling heavy loads, they were historically hitched to carts loaded with fish, milk and mail.\n\nNewfoundland ponies are likely derived from breeds brought from Europe in the early 17th century. Well adapted to the province’s harsh climate and conditions, the ponies were used to haul boats out of the water, pull logs from the forest and prepare land for spring planting. They are quiet animals with good temperaments, good workers, easy keepers and great family pets.\n\nBird\n\nThe Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica) is a well-known symbol of Newfoundland and Labrador. Over 95 percent of all the puffins in North America breed on the coasts of the province. The largest colony can be seen in the Witless Bay Ecological Reserve, south of St. John’s.\n\nGame bird\n\nThe partridge (Lagopus sp) or ptarmigan is the provincial game bird. Two partridge species – the Willow Ptarmigan and the Rock Ptarmigan – are found throughout the province.\n\nFound primarily in barrens and high country, the partridge embodies the open wilderness. An arctic bird, it is speculated that the Burin and Avalon peninsulas may be the most southern, naturally occurring extremity for the bird’s range in North America.\n\nGemstone\n\nThe mineral labradorite is one of the most beautiful and popular of the semiprecious stones and is often used in jewellery and ornaments. Named after Labrador, it is found in abundance near the community of Nain and elsewhere in Labrador as well as on the island of Newfoundland.\n\nLabradorite is usually dark grey, but in the right angle of light, it displays a play of colours mainly in shades of blue and green, but sometimes in yellow, red, and gold. This shimmering effect has nothing to do with surface colour. It is due to internal reflection, and the colours vary depending on the angle of light.\n\nTartan\n\nThe Newfoundland and Labrador tartan was designed by St. John’s Sam Wilansky in the early 1960s. The tartan has the colours of gold, white, brown and red on a green background. The gold represents the sun’s rays; the green, the pine-clad hills; the white, the cloak of snow; the brown, the Iron Isle; and the red, the Royal StandardFootnote 1 for which our fathers stood.\n\nTree\n\nThe black spruce (Picea mariana), also known as the bog spruce, was designated the provincial tree in 1993. Although its foliage is bluish-green, it is called the “black” spruce to distinguish it from other types of spruce trees. It is the most abundant tree in Labrador and appears on the Labrador flag."
