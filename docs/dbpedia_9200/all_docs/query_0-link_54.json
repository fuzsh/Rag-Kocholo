The historic event will include the laying to rest of an unknown Newfoundland First World War soldier whose remains are being repatriated from Northern France.\n\nDuring the First World War, Newfoundland was a self-governing Dominion of Britain. Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949 and officially changed its name to Newfoundland and Labrador in 2001.\n\nApproximately 12,000 Newfoundlanders served during the First World War.
