        "text": "People\n\nFounding of Cupids Bay\n\nJohn Guy and 39 settlers departed Bristol, arriving in Newfoundland in August. Though his settlement at Cupids Bay lasted only to 1628, its founding was a signal event in the early history of Newfoundland.\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nKirke Governor of Newfoundland\n\nSir David Kirke of the Company of Adventurers (later, the Hudson’s Bay Company) became co-proprietor and governor of Newfoundland. Newfoundland still uses Kirke’s coat of arms, granted to him by King Charles I in 1638, as its own.\n\nPeople\n\nFirst Smallpox Vaccinations\n\nThe first smallpox vaccinations in Canada (and possibly in North America) were given by Dr. John Clinch of Trinity, NL. By the end of 1801, Clinch had vaccinated 700 people in the area. The disease wasn’t eradicated until 1977, but vaccination gradually checked the devastating epidemics that Canada had experienced since the 17th century.\n\nSports and Culture\n\nSt John's Regatta\n\nThe first regatta in St. John's, Newfoundland, was reported in the local journal, though it is impossible to say exactly what year the race began. Despite stretches when the regatta was not held, it is considered the oldest continuing sports event in North America.\n\nPeople\n\nBirth of Sir Frederic Bowker Terrington Carter\n\nPolitician Sir Frederic Bowker Terrington Carter was born in St. John’s, Newfoundland. A Father of Confederation, Carter attended the Québec Conference. Though he supported Confederation, he was unsuccessful in bringing Newfoundland into the new nation, and gradually distanced himself from the idea.\n\nIndigenous Peoples\n\nLast Beothuk Dies\n\nShawnadithit was captured by English furriers in 1823, and her drawings and descriptions of the Beothuk are valuable records of her people. Like so many Beothuk, she died of tuberculosis.\n\nPeople\n\nJackman's Heroism\n\nIn one of the greatest stories of heroism ever recorded, William Jackman threw himself into the icy water off Labrador and rescued 11 of the 27 crew of a foundered ship unassisted. With the help of others he swam out 16 more times.\n\nPeople\n\nBirth of Robert A. Bartlett\n\nRenowned Arctic explorer Robert A. Bartlett was born in Brigus, Newfoundland. Bartlett accompanied explorer Robert Peary on three journeys to find the North Pole. In 1913 he captained the doomed Karluk for the Canadian Arctic Expedition. Bartlett’s quick thinking during the Karluk’s sinking saved his crew and the ship’s supplies.\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nNewfoundland WCTU Presents Suffrage Petition\n\nSome 50 members of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union presented petitions at the St. John’s Colonial Building. The signatures, requesting the municipal franchise, had been collected across the island. The petitions were met with scorn. Though the House of Assembly held two debates, the measure was defeated each time.\n\nDisasters\n\nFire Destroys St. John's, 1892\n\nA fire broke out in a barn on Long's Hill and swept through St John's. Some 12,000 people were left homeless after two-thirds of the city was destroyed.\n\nPeople\n\nDeath of Sir Frederic Bowker Terrington Carter\n\nSir Frederic Bowker Terrington Carter, a Father of Confederation, died in St. John’s, Newfoundland. Born into one of Newfoundland’s prominent families, Carter was a life-long politician. He served as prime minister of Newfoundland for several terms before being appointed to its Supreme Court. Carter became Newfoundland’s chief justice in 1880.\n\nPeople\n\nDeath of Sir Ambrose Shea\n\nSir Ambrose Shea, a Father of Confederation, died in London, England. Shea attended the Québec Conference and was pro-union, yet the majority of Newfoundlanders did not share his feelings. He was also one of the few Catholics in Newfoundland to support Confederation, which strained Shea’s relations with his political colleagues.\n\nDisasters\n\nTitanic Sinks\n\nThe Titanic struck an iceberg 590 km east of Newfoundland on the fifth day of its maiden voyage. It sank in 2 hrs, 40 mins with the loss of 1,522 lives, including the captain and Canadian railway tycoon Charles Melville Hays.\n\nPeople\n\nFirst Canadian Contingent\n\nThe First Canadian Contingent sailed from Québec City for England. The largest convoy ever to cross the Atlantic, it comprised over 31,000 troops aboard 31 ocean liners escorted by Royal Navy warships. Also sailing in this convoy was a contingent from the British Dominion of Newfoundland, which was still separate from Canada at that time.\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nNewfoundland Petition Calls for General Franchise\n\nNewfoundland suffragists delivered a petition requesting the general franchise for women to the island’s legislature. The petition had 1,700 signatures, and a bill was introduced to move forward on its demand. Later in the year the Liberal government, under Sir Richard Squires, rejected the bill by way of a party vote.\n\nCommunication and Transportation\n\nEarhart Begins Transatlantic Flight\n\nPilot Amelia Earhart took off from Harbour Grace, NL, in an attempt to complete the first female solo flight across the Atlantic. After navigating through a thunderstorm and treacherously icy conditions, she landed safely in Northern Ireland 15 hours later, her mission accomplished.\n\nDisasters\n\nSt. John's Fire Disaster\n\nA fire at the Knights of Columbus Hall in St John's, Newfoundland, claimed 99 lives within 7 terrifying minutes. The hall's auditorium was packed with military personnel and civilians for the radio broadcast of \"Uncle Tim's Barn Dance.\"\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nNewfoundland Votes vs Canada\n\nA Newfoundland referendum resulted in 69,000 votes for self-government, 64,000 for union with Canada, and 22,000 for no change in the island's status. Another vote on 22 July showed a majority of 7,000 for union with Canada.\n\nIndigenous Peoples\n\nFirst Nations Win Right to Vote Provincially\n\nExcept in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, Status Indians had been barred from voting provincially. Beginning with British Columbia in 1949 and ending with Quebec in 1969, First Nations peoples gradually win the right to vote in provincial elections without losing status or treaty rights.\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nNewfoundland Becomes Province\n\nNewfoundland entered the Dominion of Canada as the 10th province through an Act of Westminster. The first session of the legislature was held at St. John's on 13 July.\n\nIndigenous Peoples Resources and Environment\n\nTerra Nova National Park Established\n\nTerra Nova National Park was established. Canada's most easterly national park, it is located on Bonavista Bay, NF. Terra Nova is the Latin form of the name of the island, Newfoundland. The park shows evidence of Paleo-Eskimo, Dorset, Maritime Archaic and Beothuk cultures.\n\nResources and Environment\n\nWhaling Moratorium\n\nThe federal government ordered a halt to all whaling operations based out of Canadian ports. The last West Coast company had stopped whaling in 1967, so the order affected only two shore-based operations in Newfoundland and one in Nova Scotia. The Inuit are still allowed to harvest whales as part of their traditional rights.\n\nDisasters\n\nOcean Ranger Capsizes\n\nThe Ocean Ranger, the world's largest semi-submersible drill rig, capsized and sank in a storm on the Grand Banks with the loss of all 84 crew members, 56 of whom were Newfoundlanders.\n\nPeople\n\nSri Lankan Migrants Rescued Off Newfoundland\n\nCanadian fishing boats rescued over 150 Sri Lankan refugees off St. Shott’s, NL. The refugees were left in international waters by a smuggler. Without water, food or fuel, the refugees drifted for three days before being spotted. The rescue sparked a debate over how Canada approaches refugees, with some accusing the group of making false claims. In response to a string of similar events, the Mulroney government initiated a reform of the refugee system in 1988.\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nMeech Lake Accord Collapses\n\nThe Meech Lake Accord collapsed after the self-imposed deadline passed. The collapse owed much to Premier Clyde Wells' blockage in Newfoundland and failure to pass in Manitoba thanks to MLA Elijah Harper. It led to further constitutional wrangles and the renewal of the separatist movement in Québec.\n\nSports and Culture\n\nMen's Curling Team Wins Olympic Gold\n\nThe rink of Brad Russ Howard, Mark Nichols, Jamie Korab and Mike Adam won Canada''s first-ever gold medal in men''s curling in a final showdown with Finland which Canada won 10-4. Gushue and his teammates became the first Newfoundlanders to win an Olympic medal.\n\nResources and Environment\n\nTorngat Mountains National Park Established\n\nTorngat Mountains National Park was established. The park encompasses 9,700 km2 of Labrador north of Saglek Fiord. Torngat — in Inuktitut,Torngait — refers to one of the most powerful of Inuit spirits believed to dwell in these mountains. For thousands of years, this place has been home to Inuit and their predecessors, and remains an Inuit homeland today.\n\nDisasters\n\nHelicopter Crash Near Nfld\n\nA Cougar Helicopters chopper went down off the coast of Newfoundland after issuing a mayday about technical problems. Officials recovered two life-rafts but no one was aboard. Seventeen of the 18 passengers and crew were lost at sea.\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nFirst Female Premier of NL\n\nFollowing the retirement of Premier Danny Williams, Kathy Dunderdale was appointed interim leader of the Progressive Conservative Party and became Newfoundland and Labrador’s first female premier.\n\nResources and Environment\n\nMealy Mountains National Park Reserve Established\n\nThe Canadian government announced the creation of Canada's 46th national park, the Mealy Mountains National Park Reserve in Labrador. Occupying an area the size of Jamaica, it is co-managed by the Innu, whose names for the area are Akami–uapishku and KakKasuak.\n\nSports and Culture\n\nDeath of Ron Hynes\n\nSinger-songwriter Ron Hynes, whose powerful stories and characters moved audiences far beyond the shores of his native Newfoundland, died in St. John's at the age of 64.\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nLiberal Victory in Newfoundland and Labrador\n\nLiberal candidate Dwight Ball was elected premier of Newfoundland and Labrador in the province's 20th general provincial election. The Liberals won by a landslide, taking 31 of the province's 40 seats. The Conservatives, who had governed for the preceding 12 years, won seven seats and the NDP took two.\n\nIndigenous Peoples\n\nTrudeau Issues Newfoundland and Labrador Residential Schools Apology\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau apologizes to the Survivors of residential schools in Newfoundland and Labrador who were excluded from Stephen Harper’s 2008 apology because residential schools there were not run by the federal government and were established before Newfoundland joined Confederation in 1949. Survivor Toby Obed, who was instrumental in the class-action lawsuit against the federal government, accepted Trudeau’s apology on behalf of his community. However, Gregory Rich, Innu Nation Grand Chief, refused Trudeau’s apology on behalf of the Innu Nation, saying it was too narrow."
