        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe easternmost province of Canada is Newfoundland and Labrador. It was the last province to join the confederation; in 1949 the portion of the mainland known as Labrador and the adjacent island of Newfoundland together became the 10th Canadian province. Initially called Newfoundland, the province in 2001 was officially renamed Newfoundland and Labrador. The provincial capital is St. John’s, which is located on Newfoundland island.\n\nNewfoundland is the site of the earliest known European settlement in North America, a Viking colony dating to about 1000. Five centuries after the Vikings abandoned their colony, the island was rediscovered by Europeans in 1497, when the explorer John Cabot landed there. He called it the “new founde lande.” Ships from England, France, Portugal, and Spain anchored at the island for almost a century before England claimed it in 1583 as its first overseas colony. At that time St. John’s was a flourishing settlement. The city lies adjacent to the Grand Banks, the world’s richest fishing grounds, and boasts the best natural harbor in the country.\n\nSt. John’s represents the progress of Canada’s youngest province. Modern buildings stand beside structures dating from the reign of Queen Anne. Oceangoing vessels powered by diesel engines pass masted fishing boats in the harbor. At Cabot Tower, which guards the entrance to the harbor, Guglielmo Marconi received the first transatlantic wireless telegraphic signals. Since the island is more than 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) closer to Europe than is New York state, it is the major terminus for most transatlantic cables. It is also an outpost of Canadian and U.S. defense.\n\nThe island of Newfoundland lies across the mouth of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, separated from Nova Scotia on the southwest by the 60-mile- (97-kilometer-) wide Cabot Strait. The Strait of Belle Isle, only 10 to 15 miles (16 to 24 kilometers) wide, separates Newfoundland from Labrador on the mainland. Labrador is bordered to the south and west by the province of Quebec and to the north and east by the Labrador Sea, an arm of the Atlantic Ocean. The total area of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador is 156,649 square miles (405,719 square kilometers). The area of the island is 43,548 square miles (112,790 square kilometers). Labrador covers 113,101 square miles (292,930 square kilometers). The Avalon Peninsula in the southeastern corner of the island is the easternmost point of North America. On April 15, 1912, the British liner Titanic sank south of the Grand Banks. Population (2021) 510,550; (2023 est.) 521,542.\n\nProvince of Four Natural Regions\n\nThe entire island of Newfoundland is within the Appalachian Region. This is part of the highlands region that extends southward to Alabama in the United States. Much of Labrador is in the vast, rocky plateau called the Canadian Shield, which covers about half of Canada. (See also Canada, “Land”.)\n\nAppalachian Region and Great Lakes–St. Lawrence Lowlands\n\nThe island of Newfoundland is shaped roughly like an equilateral triangle with sides of about 300 miles (480 kilometers). The coastline is deeply indented. The island’s many large bays are dotted with smaller islands and provide sheltered harbors.\n\nAlong the west coast is a low plain, which is part of the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence Lowlands. The Appalachian Region has several subdivisions. The highest elevations are along the west coast in the Long Range Mountains, which reach a maximum height of 2,673 feet (815 meters) in the Lewis Hills northeast of Cape St. George. The Humber River rises in the Long Range Mountains. It flows through Deer Lake, cuts a deep gorge through the mountains, and enters the sea in Humber Arm. Corner Brook, Newfoundland and Labrador’s second largest city, is located here.\n\nThe Grand Lake lowland splits the Newfoundland Highlands in the northwest. It extends inland from White Bay to the south end of long, narrow Grand Lake. South of Bonne Bay are such isolated uplands as the southern Long Range and Anguille mountains, the Blue Hills of Couteau, and the Annieopsquotch Mountains. They are separated by deep valleys and fjords that extend inland for many miles. The St. George’s lowland borders part of the southwest coast and separates the Anguille Mountains from the southern Long Range Mountains.\n\nFrom the coastal mountains the plateau slopes downward to the east. In the southeast are low ranges of hills called Partridgeberry Hills and Middle Ridge. There are many lakes and bogs and broad, shallow river valleys. Heavily forested areas alternate with treeless barrens. The plateau falls to the southern coast in cliffs 300–500 feet (90–150 meters) high.\n\nThe Baie d’Espoir lowland extends inland into the Atlantic Uplands from the head of one of the south-central bays. The Terra Nova is the chief river in the Atlantic Uplands. St. John’s, the capital and largest city of the province, is on the Avalon Peninsula in the southeastern part of the uplands.\n\nWest of Bonavista Bay is Terra Nova National Park. It covers an area of 152 square miles (394 square kilometers). The coastal edge of the park is spectacular with rocky headlands and deep fjords. The interior is a wild region of forests, barrens, and rocky hills.\n\nIn the north-central part of the island is a lowland area. It reaches an elevation of 1,000 feet (300 meters). The Exploits and Gander are the longest rivers. Grand Falls and Windsor, located on the Exploits River, and Gander are the area’s largest communities.\n\nCanadian Shield and Arctic Region\n\nThe Labrador portion of the province is a great plateau 1,000–3,000 feet (300–900 meters) in elevation. In the extreme north, along the Quebec border, Mount Caubvik in the Torngats reaches 5,420 feet (1,652 meters). This is the highest point in the province. The bleak, treeless coastline is steep and forbidding. Almost all of the peninsula is drained by the Churchill River, known for Churchill Falls.\n\nLabrador’s few people live in small fishing villages in sheltered bays on the coast and in the communities at the iron mines on the Quebec border in the west. Goose Bay and its suburb Happy Valley have grown up on the outskirts of Goose Bay Airport.\n\nClimate\n\nThe climate of the island of Newfoundland varies considerably. On the west coast it is sunny in both winter and summer. In the southeast it is damp and foggy much of the year. The fogs are caused by warm, moist winds blowing off the Gulf Stream mixing with cold air over the Labrador Current from the Arctic Ocean. Winter may last from November to May, but the temperature seldom falls below zero. At St. John’s the average January temperature is 26.1 °F (–3.3 °C) and the July average, 61.1 °F (16.2 °C). Annual precipitation at St. John’s totals 41.57 inches (106 centimeters) with snowfall of 141.5 inches (359 centimeters).\n\nLabrador has a far more severe, subarctic climate. Temperature extremes of 100 °F (37.8 °C) at Goose Bay and –55 °F (–48.3 °C) at Ashuanipi, on the upper course of the Churchill River, and Sandgirt Lake have been recorded.\n\nFishing, the Earliest Industry\n\nFishing was the first industry established in the region of Newfoundland and Labrador, and it remains the most important. The province ranks third among the Canadian provinces in the value of fish caught. When John Cabot visited the island in 1497, he found that its coastal waters teemed with cod. His enthusiastic reports first drew Englishmen across the ocean, but soon fishers from other parts of Europe were traveling to the New World, eager to exploit the vast abundance of the great submarine plateau called the Grand Banks. The cold waters of the banks are rich in plankton, the microscopic food on which many species of fish and shellfish feed. It attracts and supports species ranging from cod and flounder to herring, redfish, capelin, shrimp, and crab. In 1977 Canada extended its fishing rights to 200 nautical miles from the coastline to include nearly all of the Grand Banks. Overfishing by both Canadian and non-Canadian industries resulted in plummeting fish populations by the late 1980s. Serious conservation efforts were implemented aimed at restoring finned fish populations to more sustainable numbers. Part of this plan included more emphasis on the harvest of shellfish.\n\nThe bulk of the province’s catch is frozen, a trend away from traditional salting. The United States is the main market for these frozen fillets. Other processes are pickling and canning. Fisheries are found on all coasts of the province, and changes in the industry now provide more jobs on shore than in boats.\n\nMineral Resources\n\nMining is an important industry in Newfoundland and Labrador. The province is rich in mineral deposits. The main mineral product is iron ore. Gold, silver, dolomite, gypsum, peat, limestone, stone, and gravel are also important minerals. In 1994 a rich deposit of copper, nickel, and cobalt was discovered in Voisey’s Bay on the coast of Labrador. Mining of the deposit began about a decade later. Exploration for petroleum and natural gas began offshore in the 1960s, and there have been numerous significant discoveries.\n\nThe first of the great ore bodies now in production was the iron-ore field straddling the Quebec boundary at Schefferville. The mining of these fields entailed building a new community, Labrador City, and the world’s first all-automatic railway. The railway connects with the line from Sept-Îles, Quebec, on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, to Schefferville.\n\nAgriculture\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, 100,271 acres (40,578 hectares), or roughly 1 percent of the land in Newfoundland and Labrador, was used for agriculture. The short, cool growing season limits production, and there is little fertile land. The island was covered with glaciers during the comparatively recent Wisconsin glaciation period. When the ice melted it left a thin layer of silts, sands, and gravels mixed with boulders and stones. True soils have thus had little time to develop, and the cool, moist climate tends to slow their formation. The severe climate of mainland Labrador precludes any significant crop production.\n\nPotatoes, hay, turnips, carrots, cabbage, and other vegetables are grown on the island. Livestock and poultry production are small but increasing. Blueberries are the province’s only agricultural export. Most of the meat, fruit, and vegetables consumed are imported.\n\nPulp and Paper\n\nThe manufacture of pulp and paper, chiefly newsprint, is an important industry in the province. Mills are located at Corner Brook, Grand Falls, and Stephenville.\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador’s great forests of spruce and fir provide ample raw materials despite insect infestations, and there is abundant waterpower to operate the mills. The forests also produce fuel for homes, lumber for building construction, and timber for fishing boats.\n\nTransportation and Communication\n\nThe province is served by major airports at St. John’s, Stephenville, Deer Lake, Labrador City, and Gander. The Gander field was once a vital transatlantic refueling point. Goose Airport at Goose Bay, Labrador, is a military and commercial base.\n\nA ferry operates between North Sydney, Nova Scotia, and Channel-Port aux Basques on the southwest coast, where it connects with the railway to St. John’s. Also at Channel-Port aux Basques the Trans-Canada Highway resumes. It crosses the island from here to St. John’s. St. John’s has steamship connections with ports on the St. Lawrence River and the Great Lakes and with Halifax, Nova Scotia; Boston, Massachusetts; and Liverpool, England.\n\nLabrador has only a few short roads. One of them links Labrador City and Wabush with the Quebec highway system. The only rail lines serve the iron mines on the Quebec border. Airplanes and coastal vessels are the sole means of long-distance transportation. Before the day of the airplane, Newfoundland was a communications center. The first successful transatlantic cable was landed at Heart’s Content on Trinity Bay in 1866.\n\nPeople and Cities\n\nMost of the people of Newfoundland and Labrador reside in urban areas. The vast majority of the population lives on Newfoundland.\n\nPeople\n\nAmong the non-Indigenous people of Newfoundland and Labrador, most are of English, Irish, or Scottish descent. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a small number of Chinese immigrants settled on Newfoundland, as did a group of Lebanese Christians escaping religious persecution in their homeland. There is also a sizable community of French-speaking residents in the western portion of Newfoundland island.\n\nThe province is also home to four Indigenous peoples. Three of them—the Inuit, the Innu and the Southern Inuit of NunatuKavut—live in Labrador. The Inuit are descended from the Thule, a people who migrated to Labrador from the Arctic 600–800 years ago. Most Inuit settlements are located along Labrador’s northern coast. The Innu are a First Nations people whose hunter-gatherer ancestors were also present in Labrador when Europeans arrived. The province’s major Innu settlements are located on Lake Melville in central Labrador and on Labrador’s northern coast. The Southern Inuit of NunatuKavut are of mixed European and Indigenous, mainly Inuit, heritage. They live in central and southern coastal Labrador.\n\nThe Mi’kmaq are a First Nations people who live on Newfoundland. They are descendants of hunter-gatherers who migrated to Newfoundland from what are now Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and New Brunswick about the time that Europeans arrived in the area. Newfoundland’s largest Mi’kmaq community is at Bay d’Espoir on the southern coast. There are also Mi’kmaq communities in central Newfoundland and on the west coast.\n\nCities\n\nSt. John’s, the capital and largest city, is a seaport and a center for the great fishing fleets. The site is believed to have been named by John Cabot, who entered the harbor on St. John’s Day, June 24, 1497. Sir Humphrey Gilbert visited the settlement in 1583 and claimed the island in the name of Queen Elizabeth I. The path along the waterfront on which Gilbert and his officers strolled, now Water Street, is said to be the oldest street in North America.\n\nSituated on the hillside overlooking the magnificent harbor, St. John’s still retains an Old World charm. The entrance to the harbor is through The Narrows, a passage about a quarter mile wide between 500-foot (150-meter) cliffs. In 1901 at Cabot Tower atop Signal Hill above The Narrows, inventor Guglielmo Marconi received the first transatlantic wireless telegraphic signals, transmitted from England.\n\nIn St. John’s are Memorial University and the cultural center called The Rooms. The Confederation Building, headquarters of the provincial government, is the tallest building in the city.\n\nCorner Brook is the site of one of the world’s largest pulp and paper mills. The city also produces furniture, cement, and gypsum wallboard.\n\nEducation and Government\n\nSchools are administered by the government, the Department of Education, and the major Christian church denominations. Prior to the mid-1990s, the educational system was controlled by religious denominations. The system was reformed in 1996, when a constitutional amendment restructured the system. The reforms established a secular system of education and called for the consolidation of government and denominational committees, creating 10 interdenominational school boards of 18 elected members each to replace the previous 27 denominational boards.\n\nThe Memorial University of Newfoundland was established in 1949. It developed from Memorial University College, which was founded in 1925 as a World War I memorial. Its campus, which was dedicated in 1961, overlooks the city of St. John’s. In St. John’s also are the College of Trades and Technology and the Fisheries and Marine Institute, which is affiliated with Memorial University.\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador has a single-chamber House of Assembly of 48 members, who are elected for terms not exceeding five years. From the assembly are chosen a premier and an Executive Council, or Cabinet. The Crown is represented by a lieutenant governor, appointed by the governor-general-in-council of Canada for a five-year term. Judicial power is vested in a Supreme Court and district courts. Newfoundland sends seven representatives to the Canadian House of Commons and six to the Senate.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first people of Newfoundland were the Beothuk, a First Nations hunter-gatherer people. The ancestors of the Inuit and Innu settled in what is now Labrador. Vikings from Greenland were the first European visitors to the region, arriving in Newfoundland about ad 1000 (see Leif Eriksson). After John Cabot “rediscovered” the island in 1497, Europeans used it as a fishing station. In 1583 Sir Humphrey Gilbert landed at the site of present-day St. John’s and claimed Newfoundland for England. In 1610 England granted an official charter for permanent colonization to John Guy, who established a settlement on Newfoundland’s Conception Bay.\n\nAfter 1662 the French occupied the island’s Placentia Bay area and raided English settlements on the Avalon Peninsula. The Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 recognized Britain’s claims to Newfoundland but gave France the right to catch and dry fish on its northern and western shores. France retained these rights until 1904.\n\nNewfoundland was long governed by the “fishing admirals,” the masters of the earliest fishing vessels to arrive at the Grand Banks each spring. In 1729 the first governor was appointed by the British Parliament. In 1855 Newfoundland was made a self-governing dominion. The coast of Labrador was first added to Newfoundland in 1763, but control of Labrador passed back and forth between Newfoundland and Quebec until 1927. In that year the Labrador-Quebec boundary was officially defined, with Labrador part of Newfoundland. In 1933 the Great Depression brought financial ruin. Newfoundland was forced to accept a commission form of government created by the British Parliament. In 1948 Newfoundland (which included Labrador) voted to join Canada as the 10th province, effective at midnight on March 31, 1949. On November 20, 2001, the Canadian Parliament adopted the Newfoundland and Labrador Act, which called for the province to be officially renamed Newfoundland and Labrador."
