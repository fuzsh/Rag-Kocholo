In the domain of drug evaluation, it affects all phases of drug development and assessment, from the very early preclinical studies to the late post-marketing evaluations. The core concern associated with this false-positive is the lack of replicability of the results. Aside from fraud or misconducts, false-positive is often envisioned from the statistical angle, which considers them as a price to pay for type I error in statistical testing, and its inflation in the context of multiple testing. If envisioning this problematic in the context of pharmacoepidemiology and pharmacovigilance however, that both evaluate drugs in an observational settings, information brought by statistical testing and the significance of such should only be considered as additional to the estimates provided and their confidence interval, in a context where differences have to be a clinically meaningful upon everything, and the results appear robust to the biases likely to have affected the studies. In the following article, we consequently illustrate these biases and their consequences in generating false-positive results, through studies and associations between drug use and health outcomes that have been widely disputed.

The chances of a positive screening test have been reported to be as high as 24Â % when multiple conditions are screened. Yet, little is known about the way these tests are offered and how patients are affected by a positive test result. To explore this area of genetic testing, interviews (nÂ =Â 17) were conducted among women who received positive expanded carrier results in the context of obstetric care. A content analysis was conducted on the transcript data from the interviews. Outcomes of this research suggest that educational interventions are needed to improve maternal understanding of positive carrier screening results. Most of the participants in this study confused the results with other prenatal screening test options. In addition, the way the results were discussed varied greatly, and influenced participants' thoughts about reproductive decisions that led to a range of emotional uncertainty. Our data suggests that genetic counseling improved participants' understanding of positive results. More research is needed to further understand if our results are consistent within a larger, more diverse sample, and to explore how to best provide education about expanded carrier screening.\n\nNanotribological Properties of Positively and Negatively charged nanodiamonds as additives to solutions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, Zijian; Corley, Steven; Shenderova, Olga; Brenner, Donald; Krim, Jacqueline\n\n2013-03-01\n\nNano-diamond (ND) particles are known to be beneficial for wear and friction reduction when used as additives in liquids, but the fundamental origins of the improvement in tribological properties has not been established. In order to explore this issue, we have investigated the nanotribological properties of ND coated with self-assembled monolayers (SAM) as additives to solutions, employing gold/chrome coated quartz crystal microbalances (QCM). Measurements were performed with the QCM initially immersed in deionized water. ND particles with positively and negatively charged SAM end groups were then added to the water, while the frequency and amplitude of the QCM were monitored. Negative shifts in both the QCM frequency and amplitude were observed when ND with positively charged SAM end groups were added, while positive shifts in both the QCM frequency and amplitude were observed when ND with negatively charged ND end groups were added. The results are consistent with a lubricating effect for the negatively charged ND, but were only observed for sufficiently small negative ND particle size. Experiments on QCM surfaces with differing textures and roughness are in progress, to determine the separate contributing effects of surface roughness charge-water interactions.

We administered a test to 512 students completing introductory physics courses at a private Mexican university. In the first part, we analyze students' responses in three isomorphic problems: displacements, forces, and no physical context. Students were asked to draw two vectors and the vector sum. We analyzed students' procedures detecting the difficulties when drawing the vector addition and proved that the context matters, not only compared to the context-free case but also between the contexts. In the second part, we analyze students' responses with three different arrangements of the sum of two vectors: tail-to-tail, head-to-tail and separated vectors. We compared the frequencies of the errors in the three different positions to deduce students' conceptions in the addition of vectors.\n\nThe Distinction between Positive and Negative Reinforcement: Some Additional Considerations\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSidman, Murray\n\n2006-01-01\n\nIn this article, the author discusses the distinction between positive and negative reinforcement and some additional considerations.

Hemorrhoids are a possible cause of FP FIT results; however, studies on this topic are extremely rare. We investigated whether hemorrhoids are associated with FP FIT results. Materials and Methods A retrospective study was conducted at a university hospital in Korea from June 2013 to May 2015. Of the 34547 individuals who underwent FITs, 3946 aged â¥50 years who underwent colonoscopies were analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine factors associated with FP FIT results. Results Among 3946 participants, 704 (17.8%) showed positive FIT results and 1303 (33.0%) had hemorrhoids. Of the 704 participants with positive FIT results, 165 had advanced colorectal neoplasia (ACRN) and 539 had no ACRN (FP results). Of the 1303 participants with hemorrhoids, 291 showed FP results, of whom 81 showed FP results because of hemorrhoids only. Participants with hemorrhoids had a higher rate of FP results than those without hemorrhoids (291/1176, 24.7% vs. 248/2361, 10.5%; p<0.001). Additionally, the participants with hemorrhoids as the only abnormality had a higher rate of FP results than those experiencing no such abnormalities (81/531, 15.3% vs. 38/1173, 3.2%; p<0.001). In multivariate analysis, the presence of hemorrhoids was identified as an independent predictor of FP results (adjusted odds ratio, 2.76; 95% confidence interval, 2.24â3.40; p<0.001). Conclusion Hemorrhoids are significantly associated with FP FIT results. Their presence seemed to be a non-negligible contributor of FP results in FIT-based CRC screening programs.

The clinical evaluation of laboratory results to assess the possibility of appropriate medical use of a drug is a task with many different facets, depending on the drug class considered. This intercession prevents the reporting of positive results unless it is apparent that drugs were used illicitly. In addition to the commonly encountered prescribed drugs that yield positive drug testing results, other sources of positive results must be considered. This review describes a series of compounds referred to as \"precursor\" drugs that are metabolized by the body to amphetamine and/or methamphetamine. These compounds lead to positive results for amphetamines even though neither amphetamine nor methamphetamine were used, a possibility that must be considered in the review of laboratory results. Description of the drugs, their clinical indications, and results seen following administration are provided. This information allows for the informed evaluation of results with regard to the potential involvement of these drugs.\n\nAre Hemorrhoids Associated with False-Positive Fecal Immunochemical Test Results?\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Nam Hee; Park, Jung Ho; Park, Dong Il; Sohn, Chong Il; Choi, Kyuyong; Jung, Yoon Suk\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFalse-positive (FP) results of fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) conducted in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening could lead to performing unnecessary colonoscopies.

The purpose of this study was to test the hypotheses that in the field of ophthalmology: (1) studies with positive results have a greater chance of being published in journals with a higher impact factor; (2) likewise, studies with a larger number of participants are more likely to be published in journals with a higher impact factor. In this retrospective study, consecutive randomized, controlled trials conducted in the field of ophthalmology between 1 January 2010 and 1 January 2013 were retrieved from PubMed. Each study was classified as having either a positive or negative result. A positive result was defined as a study in which there was a statistically significant difference between groups (pâ<â0.05). The impact factor of the journal in which the study was published was retrieved. The number of patients enrolled and whether or not the trial was placebo controlled was documented as well. Out of 2524 studies identified, 892 met the inclusion criteria. Studies with positive results were published in journals with a significantly higher impact factor than that of the journals in which negative result studies were published (pâ<â0.001). Studies with positive results had a slightly larger number of participants than studies with negative results (pâ=â0.028). In multiple regression analysis, the ranked impact factor was significantly predicted by the primary outcome (positive versus negative results) and the number of participants in a study (total R(2â)=â2.95, pâ<â0.001). In the field of ophthalmology, articles with positive results are currently published in journals with a higher impact factor. This finding supports the ongoing occurrence of positive results bias in the field of ophthalmology.\n\nBreast cancer detection risk in screening mammography after a false-positive result.\n\nPubMed\n\nCastells, X; RomÃ¡n, M; Romero, A; Blanch, J; Zubizarreta, R; Ascunce, N; Salas, D; BurÃ³n, A; Sala, M\n\n2013-02-01\n\nFalse-positives are a major concern in breast cancer screening. However, false-positives have been little evaluated as a prognostic factor for cancer detection. Our aim was to evaluate the association of false-positive results with the cancer detection risk in subsequent screening participations over a 17-year period. This is a retrospective cohort study of 762,506 women aged 45-69 years, with at least two screening participations, who underwent 2,594,146 screening mammograms from 1990 to 2006. Multilevel discrete-time hazard models were used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (OR) of breast cancer detection in subsequent screening participations in women with false-positive results. False-positives involving a fine-needle aspiration cytology or a biopsy had a higher cancer detection risk than those involving additional imaging procedures alone (OR = 2.69; 95%CI: 2.28-3.16 and OR = 1.81; 95%CI: 1.70-1.94, respectively). The risk of cancer detection increased substantially if women with cytology or biopsy had a familial history of breast cancer (OR = 4.64; 95%CI: 3.23-6.66). Other factors associated with an increased cancer detection risk were age 65-69 years (OR = 1.84; 95%CI: 1.67-2.03), non-attendance at the previous screening invitation (OR = 1.26; 95%CI: 1.11-1.43), and having undergone a previous benign biopsy outside the screening program (OR = 1.24; 95%CI: 1.13-1.35). Women with a false-positive test have an increased risk of cancer detection in subsequent screening participations, especially those with a false-positive result involving cytology or biopsy. Understanding the factors behind this association could provide valuable information to increase the effectiveness of breast cancer screening. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Many additives have been proposed to improve the thermal stability of the charged positive electrolyte. However, we have found that the apparent stability, revealed in laboratory testing, is often simply an artifact of the test method and arises from the oxidation of the additive, with corresponding partial reduction of V(V) to V(IV). This does not improve the stability of the electrolyte in an operating system. Here, we examined the oxidation of some typical organic additives with carboxyl, alcohol, and multi-functional groups, in sulfuric acid solutions containing V(V). The UV-vis measurements and titration results showed that many compounds reduced the state-of-charge (SOC) of vanadium electrolyte, for example, by 27.8, 88.5, and 81.9% with the addition of 1%wt of EDTA disodium salt, pyrogallol, and ascorbic acid, respectively. The cell cycling also indicated the effect of organic additives on the cell performance, with significant reduction in the usable charge capacity. In addition, a standard screening method for thermally stable additives was introduced, to quickly screen suitable additives for the positive vanadium electrolyte.\n\nImplications of false-positive results for future cancer screenings.\n\nPubMed\n\nTaksler, Glen B; Keating, Nancy L; Rothberg, Michael B\n\n2018-06-01\n\nFalse-positive cancer screening results may affect a patient's willingness to obtain future screening. The authors conducted logistic regression analysis of 450,484 person-years of electronic medical records (2006-2015) in 92,405 individuals aged 50 to 75 years. Exposures were false-positive breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer screening test results (repeat breast imaging or negative breast biopsy â¤3 months after screening mammography, repeat prostate-specific antigen [PSA] test â¤3 months after PSA test result â¥4.0 ng/mL or negative prostate biopsy â¤3 months after any PSA result, or negative colonoscopy [without biopsy/polypectomy] â¤6 months after a positive fecal occult blood test). Outcomes were up-to-date status with breast or colorectal cancer screening. Covariates included prior screening history, clinical information (eg, family history, obesity, and smoking status), comorbidity, and demographics. Women were more likely to be up to date with breast cancer screening if they previously had false-positive mammography findings (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.43 [95% confidence interval, 1.34-1.51] without breast biopsy and AOR, 2.02 [95% confidence interval, 1.56-2.62] with breast biopsy; both P<.001). The same women were more likely to be up to date with colorectal cancer screening (AOR range, 1.25-1.47 depending on breast biopsy; both P<.001). Men who previously had false-positive PSA testing were more likely to be up to date with colorectal cancer screening (AOR, 1.22 [P = .039] without prostate imaging/biopsy and AOR, 1.60 [P = .028] with imaging/biopsy). Results were stronger for individuals with more false-positive results (all Pâ¤.005). However, women with previous false-positive colorectal cancer fecal occult blood test screening results were found to be less likely to be up to date with breast cancer screening (AOR, 0.73; P<.001). Patients who previously had a false-positive breast or prostate cancer screening test were more likely to engage\n\n\"Something Extra on Chromosome 5\": Parents' Understanding of Positive Prenatal Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA) Results.\n\nPubMed\n\nWalser, Sarah A; Werner-Lin, Allison; Russell, Amita; Wapner, Ronald J; Bernhardt, Barbara A\n\n2016-10-01\n\nThis study aims to explore how couples' understanding of the nature and consequences of positive prenatal chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) results impacts decision-making and concern about pregnancy. We interviewed 28 women and 12 male partners after receiving positive results and analyzed the transcripts to assess their understanding and level of concern about the expected clinical implications of results. Participant descriptions were compared to the original laboratory interpretation. When diagnosed prenatally, couples' understanding of the nature and consequences of copy number variants (CNVs) impacts decision-making and concern. Findings suggest women, but less so partners, generally understand the nature and clinical implications of prenatal CMA results. Couples feel reassured, perhaps sometimes falsely so, when a CNV is inherited from a \"normal\" parent and experience considerable uncertainty when a CNV is de novo, frequently precipitating a search for additional information and guidance. Five factors influenced participants' concern including: the pattern of inheritance, type of possible phenotypic involvement, perceived manageability of outcomes, availability and strength of evidence about outcomes associated with the CNV, and provider messages about continuing the pregnancy. A good understanding of results is vital as couples decide whether or not to continue with their pregnancy and seek additional information to assist in pregnancy decision-making.\n\n49 CFR 219.605 - Positive drug test results; procedures.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2012 CFR\n\n2012-10-01\n\n...

The effect of PEG addition on the cellulase adsorption was tested on various steam pretreated lignocellulose substrates (spruce, willow, hemp, corn stover, wheat straw, sweet sorghum bagasse). A positive effect of PEG addition was observed, as protein adsorption has decreased and free enzyme activities (FP, Î²-glucosidase) have increased due to the additive. However, the degree of enhancement differed among the substrates, being highest on steam pretreated spruce. Results of lignin analysis (pyrolysis-GC/MS, (31)PÂ NMR) suggest that the effect of PEG addition is in connection with the amount of unsubstituted phenolic hydroxyl groups of lignin in the substrate. Adsorption experiments using two commercial enzyme preparations, Celluclast 1.5L (Trichoderma reesei cellulase) and Novozym 188 (Aspergillus niger Î²-glucosidase) suggested that enzyme origins affected on the adsorptivity of Î²-glucosidases.

Continued use of the QuantiFERON-TB assay suggests the need for more definitive evidence of its reproducibility and accuracy. To examine reproducibility and the accumulation of false-positive test results when the QuantiFERON-TB is repeated annually and to examine the validity of confirming positive test results with the performance of a second QuantiFERON-TB. We performed a retrospective, longitudinal evaluation of results from serial screening of a cohort of emergency responders from 2001 to 2013. Results of tuberculin tests and QuantiFERON-TB tests performed annually as part of a mandated first responder examination were retroactively reviewed. In this population, positive results occurred in new individuals each year. QuantiFERON-TB results were positive in 80 of 557 tuberculin test-negative individuals examined annually for a maximum of 7 years. Only 10 individuals with initially positive results remained positive when the test was repeated the next year, and 9 of these 10 were QuantiFERON-TB-negative within 3 years. The number of individuals with a positive result increased annually, and, after 7 years, 32 (27.4%) of 117 people had a positive result. When viewed in the context of the extensive literature documenting unreliable QuantiFERON-TB test performance, our findings of frequent, cumulative, sporadic, and irreproducible positive results support discontinuing the use of the QuantiFERON-TB assay for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis in low-risk populations.\n\nGNSS Antenna Caused Near-Field Interference Effect in Precise Point Positioning Results\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDawidowicz, Karol; BaryÅa, RadosÅaw\n\n2017-06-01\n\nResults of long-term static GNSS observation processing adjustment prove that the often assumed \"averaging multipath effect due to extended observation periods\" does not actually apply. It is instead visible a bias that falsifies the coordinate estimation. The comparisons between the height difference measured with a geometrical precise leveling and the height difference provided by GNSS clearly verify the impact of the near-field multipath effect. The aim of this paper is analysis the near-field interference effect with respect to the coordinate domain. We demonstrate that the way of antennas mounting during observation campaign (distance from nearest antennas) can cause visible changes in pseudo-kinematic precise point positioning results. GNSS measured height differences comparison revealed that bias of up to 3 mm can be noticed in Up component when some object (additional GNSS antenna) was placed in radiating near-field region of measuring antenna. Additionally, for both processing scenario (GPS and GPS/GLONASS) the scattering of results clearly increased when additional antenna crosses radiating near-field region of measuring antenna. It is especially true for big choke ring antennas. In short session (15, 30 min.) the standard deviation was about twice bigger in comparison to scenario without additional antenna. When we used typical surveying antennas (short near-field region radius) the effect is almost invisible. In this case it can be observed the standard deviation increase of about 20%. On the other hand we found that surveying antennas are generally characterized by lower accuracy than choke ring antennas. The standard deviation obtained on point with this type of antenna was bigger in all processing scenarios (in comparison to standard deviation obtained on point with choke ring antenna).\n\nRisk of breast cancer after false-positive results in mammographic screening.\n\nPubMed\n\nRomÃ¡n, Marta; Castells, Xavier; Hofvind, Solveig; von Euler-Chelpin, My\n\n2016-06-01\n\nWomen with false-positive results are commonly referred back to routine screening. Questions remain regarding their long-term outcome of breast cancer. We assessed the risk of screen-detected breast cancer in women with false-positive results. We conducted a joint analysis using individual level data from the population-based screening programs in Copenhagen and Funen in Denmark, Norway, and Spain. Overall, 150,383 screened women from Denmark (1991-2008), 612,138 from Norway (1996-2010), and 1,172,572 from Spain (1990-2006) were included. Poisson regression was used to estimate the relative risk (RR) of screen-detected cancer for women with false-positive versus negative results. We analyzed information from 1,935,093 women 50-69Â years who underwent 6,094,515 screening exams. During an average 5.8Â years of follow-up, 230,609 (11.9%) women received a false-positive result and 27,849 (1.4%) were diagnosed with screen-detected cancer. The adjusted RR of screen-detected cancer after a false-positive result was 2.01 (95% CI: 1.93-2.09). Women who tested false-positive at first screen had a RR of 1.86 (95% CI: 1.77-1.96), whereas those who tested false-positive at third screening had a RR of 2.42 (95% CI: 2.21-2.64). The RR of breast cancer at the screening test after the false-positive result was 3.95 (95% CI: 3.71-4.21), whereas it decreased to 1.25 (95% CI: 1.17-1.34) three or more screens after the false-positive result. Women with false-positive results had a twofold risk of screen-detected breast cancer compared to women with negative tests. The risk remained significantly higher three or more screens after the false-positive result. The increased risk should be considered when discussing stratified screening strategies.

These cases are referred for syphilis line assay (INNO-LIA) and recalled for repeat syphilis serology. We performed a retrospective audit to establish the proportion of HIV-negative cases with unconfirmed positive enzyme immunoassay results, the proportion of these cases that received an INNO-LIA test and repeat syphilis serology testing and reviewed the clinical outcomes; 0.35% (80/22687) cases had an unconfirmed positive treponemal enzyme immunoassay result. Repeat syphilis serology was performed in 80% (64/80) cases, but no additional cases of syphilis were identified. Eighty-eight per cent (70/80) received an INNO-LIA test; 14% (5/37) unconfirmed enzyme immunoassay-positive cases with no prior history of syphilis were confirmed on INNO-LIA assay, supporting a diagnosis of latent syphilis. As a confirmatory treponemal test, the INNO-LIA assay may be more useful than repeat syphilis serological testing.

The authors aimed to assess the relationship between conflicts of interest (COIs) and study results. The authors assessed all randomized clinical trials (RCTs) published between July 2010 and June 2012 in the 10 dental journals with the highest impact factors in dentistry. The authors used three definitions of COI and explored their associations with positive study results. Depending on the definition of COI, the odds ratio for reporting positive results varied between 2.40 (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 1.16-5.13) and 9.19 (95 percent CI, 1.71-170.64). The authors found no association between positive study results and journal of publication or area of practice. RCTs in which authors have some type of COI are more likely to have results that support the intervention being assessed. When reviewing the results of RCTs, clinicians need to be aware of the association between reporting positive study results and the type of COI disclosure and be even more careful when critically appraising and applying their results.\n\nEvaluation of positive and false-positive results in syphilis screening of blood donors in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nSandes, V S; Silva, S G C; Motta, I J F; Velarde, L G C; de Castilho, S R\n\n2017-06-01\n\nWe propose to analyse the positive and false-positive results of treponemal and nontreponemal tests in blood donors from Brazil and to evaluate possible factors associated with the results of treponemal tests. Treponemal tests have been used widely for syphilis screening in blood banks. The introduction of these tests in donor screening has caused an impact and a loss of donors who need to be assessed. This was a retrospective cross-sectional study of syphilis screening and confirmatory test results of blood donors that were obtained before and after adopting a chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA). A comparative analysis was performed using a second sample drawn from positive donors. The possible factors associated with CLIA-positive or CLIA-false-positive results were investigated in a subgroup. Statistical tests were used to compare the proportions and adjusted estimates of association. The reactivity rate increased from 1Â·01% (N = 28 158) to 2Â·66% (N = 25 577) after introducing the new test. Among Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL)- and CLIA-confirmed results, the false-positive rates were 40Â·5% (N = 180) and 37Â·4% (N = 359), respectively (P = 0Â·5266). Older donors (OR = 1Â·04; P = 0Â·0010) and donors with lower education levels (OR = 6Â·59; P = 0Â·0029) were associated with a higher risk of positivity for syphilis. CLIA represents an improvement in blood bank serological screening. However, its use in a healthy population appears to result in high rates of false positives. Identifying which characteristics can predict false positives, however, remains a challenge.

A.; El-Egamy, S. S.\n\nA major disadvantage of the lead/acid battery is the decrease in voltage during operation which makes it unsuitable for systems sensitive to voltage fluctuations. Additives like BaSO 4 or SrSO 4, which are isomorphous to PbSO 4, have been used to overcome this problem. Phosphoric acid and the various phosphates have long been used to improve the performance of the positive electrode of the battery. A beneficial effect of phosphoric acid is to inhibit the rate of the self-discharge reaction of the positive electrode in the lead/acid battery. However, adverse effects of phosphoric acid include capacity loss in the initial cycles, excessive mossing, especially at high H 3PO 4 concentrations, and poor low-temperature performance (decrease in the rate of PbSO 4 oxidation). The effect of boric acid as an additive substituting for H 3PO 4 has been investigated using linear sweep voltammetry, constant potential and impedance measurements. The results show that boric acid markedly improves the kinetics of the {PbO 2}/{PbSO 4} couple and removes the problems encountered during the usage of H 3PO 4.\n\nThe use of EMDR in positive verbal material: results from a patient study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMatthijssen, Suzy Johanna Martina Adriana; van den Hout, Marcel\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground According to the working memory (WM) theory of eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR), dual tasks that tax WM during memory recall reduce image vividness and emotionality of memory during future recalls when no dual task is carried out. There is some evidence that WM taxing also reduces vividness and emotionality of auditory or verbal imagery. Objective The present study tests the effect of eye movements (EM) on positive verbal material (verbal imagery), which is used in different parts of the EMDR protocol. In the Dutch version of the standard EMDR protocol, a procedure âPositive Closureâ (PC) is performed, which uses verbal imagery under dual task condition (EM). The value of EM in this procedure has not been established and according to the WM account would be counterproductive. Two earlier studies with undergraduates, with a set-up comparable to the present one, showed no additive value of the EM in the procedure, but no counterproductive effect either. Method Thirty-six patients rated the belief in possessing two positive personality traits and emotionality of the traits. They then had an EMDR session targeting a negative memory and recalled and re-rated the belief and emotionality of the traits afterward. Subsequently, they recalled one trait while dual tasking (EM) and the other trait without dual tasking. Afterward, they re-rated the belief and emotionality. Results EM did not affect the belief in possessing the trait or the emotionality. Secondary analysis shows an effective EMDR session itself enhances the belief in the traits, compared to a less or non-effective EMDR session. Conclusions EM are not effective in enhancing the belief in possessing a personality trait or the emotionality. If replicated by other patient studies, this suggests elimination of the PC procedure. Highlights of the article In this study the additive value of EM on verbal material (in the procedure Positive Closure) is not found.

Dimensional and content analyses were conducted on interviews with 203 parents of 106 infants having positive NBS results. Diagnostic results confirmed infants as having congenital hypothyroidism (n=37), cystic fibrosis (n=26), or being CF-carriers (n=43). Parentsâ reactions ranged from âvery scaryâ to ânot too concerned.â Most reported feeling shocked, panic, and worry; some reported guilt. Parents in the CF and CF-carrier groups preferred face-to-face disclosure as the communication channel; whereas congenital hypothyroidism group parents supported telephone contacts. Parents recommended providers be well informed, honest, and calm; personalize disclosure, avoid jargon, listen carefully, encourage questions, recognize parental distress, offer realistic reassurance, pace amount and rate of information, assess parentsâ understanding, and refer to specialists. We conclude that provider-patient communication approach and channel can exacerbate or alleviate parentsâ negative reactions to positive NBS results.

Namely, we show that any nontrivial nonnegative solution is positive for a class of problems the strong maximum principle does not apply to. Our approach is based on a continuity argument combined with variational techniques, the sub and supersolutions method and some a priori bounds. Both Dirichlet and Neumann homogeneous boundary conditions are considered. As a byproduct, we deduce some existence and uniqueness results. Finally, as an application, we derive some positivity results for indefinite concave-convex type problems.\n\nGreen-coloured results on guaiac-based faecal occult blood testing should be considered positive.\n\nPubMed\n\nGordon, Joy C; Steele, R Jc; Fraser, C G\n\n2004-11-01\n\nIn guaiac-based faecal occult blood tests (FOBT), blue colours are considered positive. Blue-green colours should also be considered positive. Distinct green colours are said to be due to bile and it is stated that these should be interpreted as negative. The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical outcomes in individuals in whom the FOBT had difficult-to-interpret green colours that did not wash out on addition of developer. During the examination of 134 844 FOBT received in the Scottish laboratory in the first screening round of the UK Colorectal Cancer Screening Pilot, samples with green colour that did not wash out during development were identified. The clinical outcomes were determined from the comprehensive data set collected for each participant. A small number (77) of FOBT were recorded as green-coloured on development. These were reported as positive and the usual investigation algorithm followed. Significant pathology was present in 31 of the 77 participants (40.3%). Negative outcomes encompassed 39 of the 77 participants (50.6%). The outcome could not be determined accurately for seven of the 77 participants (9.1%). Importantly, 17 of the participants (22.1%) had polyps. Any green colour that does not wash out to the periphery of the guaiac tape on development of FOBT should be reported as a positive result, and manufacturers should clarify their instructions on interpretation.\n\nCan additive measures add to an intersectional understanding? Experiences of gay and ethnic discrimination among HIV-positive Latino gay men.\n\nPubMed\n\nReisen, Carol A; Brooks, Kelly D; Zea, Maria Cecilia; Poppen, Paul J; Bianchi, Fernanda T\n\n2013-04-01\n\nThe current study investigated a methodological question of whether traditional, additive, quantitative data can be used to address intersectional issues, and illustrated such an approach with a sample of 301 HIV-positive, Latino gay men in the United States. Participants were surveyed using A-CASI. Hierarchical logistic set regression investigated the role of sets of variables reflecting demographic characteristics, gender nonconformity, and gay and ethnic discrimination in relation to depression and gay collective identity. Results showed the discrimination set was related to depression and to gay collective identity, as was gender nonconformity. Follow-up logistic regression showed that both types of discrimination were associated with greater depression, but gender nonconformity was not. Gay discrimination and gender nonconformity were positively associated with gay collective identity, whereas ethnic discrimination was negatively associated. Results are discussed in terms of the use of traditional quantitative data as a potential means of understanding intersectional issues, as well as of contributing to knowledge about individuals facing multiple structural inequalities.\n\nWay forward in case of a false positive in vitro genotoxicity result for a cosmetic substance?\n\nPubMed\n\nDoktorova, Tatyana Y; Ates, Gamze; Vinken, Mathieu; Vanhaecke, Tamara; Rogiers, Vera\n\n2014-02-01\n\nThe currently used regulatory in vitro mutagenicity/genotoxicity test battery has a high sensitivity for detecting genotoxicants, but it suffers from a large number of irrelevant positive results (i.e. low specificity) thereby imposing the need for additional follow-up by in vitro and/or in vivo genotoxicity tests. This could have a major impact on the cosmetic industry in Europe, seen the imposed animal testing and marketing bans on cosmetics and their ingredients. Afflicted, but safe substances could therefore be lost. Using the example of triclosan, a cosmetic preservative, we describe here the potential applicability of a human toxicogenomics-based in vitro assay as a potential mechanistically based follow-up test for positive in vitro genotoxicity results. Triclosan shows a positive in vitro chromosomal aberration test, but is negative during in vivo follow-up tests. Toxicogenomics analysis unequivocally shows that triclosan is identified as a compound acting through non-DNA reactive mechanisms. This proof-of-principle study illustrates the potential of genome-wide transcriptomics data in combination with in vitro experimentation as a possible weight-of-evidence follow-up approach for de-risking a positive outcome in a standard mutagenicity/genotoxicity battery. As such a substantial number of cosmetic compounds wrongly identified as genotoxicants could be saved for the future. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, in â¼15% of all patients, stress echocardiography leads to false-positive stress echocardiography results. We aimed to investigate the impact of hypertension on stress echocardiographic results. We performed a retrospective study of patients with suspected or known stable coronary artery disease who underwent a bicycle exercise stress echocardiography. Patients with false-positive stress results were compared with those with appropriate results. 126 patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease were included in this retrospective study. 23 patients showed false-positive stress echocardiography results. Beside comparable age, gender distribution and coronary artery status, hypertension was more prevalent in patients with false-positive stress results (95.7% vs. 67.0%, pâ=â0.0410). Exercise peak load revealed a borderline-significance with lower loads in patients with false-positive results (100.0 (IQR 75.0/137.5) vs. 125.0 (100.0/150.0) W, pâ=â0.0601). Patients with false-positive stress results showed higher systolic (2.05âÂ±â0.69 vs. 1.67âÂ±â0.39âmmHg/W, pâ=â0.0193) and diastolic (1.03âÂ±â0.38 vs. 0.80âÂ±â0.28âmmHg/W, pâ=â0.0165) peak blood pressure (BP) per wattage. In a multivariate logistic regression test, hypertension (OR 17.6 [CI 95% 1.9-162.2], pâ=â0.0115), and systolic (OR 4.12 [1.56-10.89], pâ=â0.00430) and diastolic (OR 13.74 [2.46-76.83], pâ=â0.00285) peak BP per wattage, were associated with false-positive exercise results. ROC analysis for systolic and diastolic peak BP levels per wattage showed optimal cut-off values of 1.935mmHg/W and 0.823mmHg/W, indicating false-positive exercise echocardiographic results with AUCs of 0.660 and 0.664, respectively.

In particular, the various concepts of passivity as standard passivity, strict input passivity, strict output passivity and very strict passivity (i.e. joint strict input and output passivity) are given and related to the existence of a storage function and a dissipation function. Later on, the obtained results are related to external positivity of systems and positivity or strict positivity of the transfer matrices and transfer functions in the time-invariant case. On the other hand, it is discussed how to achieve or how eventually to increase the passivity effects via linear feedback by the synthesis of the appropriate feed-forward or feedback controllers or, simply, by adding a positive parallel direct input-output matrix interconnection gain.\n\nClinical experience of laboratory follow-up with noninvasive prenatal testing using cell-free DNA and positive microdeletion results in 349 cases.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchwartz, S; Kohan, M; Pasion, R; Papenhausen, P R; Platt, L D\n\n2018-02-01\n\nScreening via noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) involving the analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from plasma has become readily available to screen for chromosomal and DNA aberrations through maternal blood. This report reviews a laboratory's experience with follow-up of positive NIPT screens for microdeletions. Patients that were screened positive by NIPT for a microdeletion involving 1p, 4p, 5p, 15q, or 22q who underwent diagnostic studies by either chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis were evaluated. The overall positive predictive value for 349 patients was 9.2%. When a microdeletion was confirmed, 39.3% of the cases had additional abnormal microarray findings. Unrelated abnormal microarray findings were detected in 11.8% of the patients in whom the screen positive microdeletion was not confirmed. Stretches of homozygosity in the microdeletion were frequently associated with a false positive cfDNA microdeletion result. Overall, this report reveals that while cfDNA analysis will screen for microdeletions, the positive predictive value is low; in our series it is 9.2%. Therefore, the patient should be counseled accordingly. Confirmatory diagnostic microarray studies are imperative because of the high percentage of false positives and the frequent additional abnormalities not delineated by cfDNA analysis.

F.; Akhmetvalieva, G. R.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nFuel oil plays an important role in the energy balance of our country. The quality of fuel oil significantly affects the conditions of its transport, storage, and combustion; release of contaminants to atmosphere; and the operation of main and auxiliary facilities of HPPs. According to the Energy Strategy of Russia for the Period until 2030, the oil-refining ratio gradually increases; as a result, the fraction of straight-run fuel oil in heavy fuel oils consistently decreases, which leads to the worsening of performance characteristics of fuel oil. Consequently, the problem of the increase in the quality of residual fuel oil is quite topical. In this paper, it is suggested to treat fuel oil by additives during its combustion, which would provide the improvement of ecological and economic indicators of oil-fired HPPs. Advantages of this method include simplicity of implementation, low energy and capital expenses, and the possibility to use production waste as additives. In the paper, the results are presented of industrial tests of the combustion of fuel oil with the additive of dewatered carbonate sludge, which is formed during coagulation and lime treatment of environmental waters on HPPs. The design of a volume delivery device is developed for the steady additive input to the boiler air duct. The values are given for the main parameters of the condition of a TGM-84B boiler plant. The mechanism of action of dewatered carbonate sludge on sulfur oxides, which are formed during fuel oil combustion, is considered. Results of industrial tests indicate the decrease in the mass fraction of discharged sulfur oxides by 36.5%. Evaluation of the prevented damage from sulfur oxide discharged into atmospheric air shows that the combustion of the fuel oil of 100 brand using carbonate sludge as an additive (0.1 wt %) saves nearly 6 million rubles a year during environmental actions at the consumption of fuel oil of 138240 t/year.\n\nCT Colonography with Computer-aided Detection: Recognizing the Causes of False-Positive Reader Results\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDachman, Abraham H.; Wroblewski, Kristen; Vannier, Michael W.; Horne, John M.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nComputed tomography (CT) colonography is a screening modality used to detect colonic polyps before they progress to colorectal cancer. Computer-aided detection (CAD) is designed to decrease errors of detection by finding and displaying polyp candidates for evaluation by the reader. CT colonography CAD false-positive results are common and have numerous causes. The relative frequency of CAD false-positive results and their effect on reader performance on the basis of a 19-reader, 100-case trial shows that the vast majority of CAD false-positive results were dismissed by readers. Many CAD false-positive results are easily disregarded, including those that result from coarse mucosa, reconstruction, peristalsis, motion, streak artifacts, diverticulum, rectal tubes, and lipomas. CAD false-positive results caused by haustral folds, extracolonic candidates, diminutive lesions (<6 mm), anal papillae, internal hemorrhoids, varices, extrinsic compression, and flexural pseudotumors are almost always recognized and disregarded. The ileocecal valve and tagged stool are common sources of CAD false-positive results associated with reader false-positive results. Nondismissable CAD soft-tissue polyp candidates larger than 6 mm are another common cause of reader false-positive results that may lead to further evaluation with follow-up CT colonography or optical colonoscopy. Strategies for correctly evaluating CAD polyp candidates are important to avoid pitfalls from common sources of CAD false-positive results.

Methods and Materials: Radiation Therapy Oncology Group study 94-08 analyzed 1979 males with prostate cancer, stage T1b-T2b and prostate-specific antigen concentrations of â¤20Â ng/dL, to investigate whether 4Â months of total androgen suppression (TAS) added to RT improved survival compared to RT alone. Patients randomized to receive TAS received flutamide with luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist. According to protocol, patients without evidence of clinical recurrence or initiation of additional endocrine therapy underwent repeatmoreÂ Â» prostate biopsy 2Â years after RT completion. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of positive post-RT biopsy results on clinical outcomes. Results: A total of 831 patients underwent post-RT biopsy, 398 were treated with RT alone and 433 with RT plus TAS. Patients with positive post-RT biopsy results had higher rates of biochemical failure (hazard ratio [HR]Â =Â 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]Â =Â 1.3-2.1) and distant metastasis (HR = 2.4; 95% CIÂ =Â 1.3-4.4) and inferior disease-specific survival (HR = 3.8; 95% CIÂ =Â 1.9-7.5). Positive biopsy results remained predictive of such outcomes after correction for potential confounders such as Gleason score, tumor stage, and TAS administration. Prior TAS therapy did not prevent elevated risk of adverse outcome in the setting of post-RT positive biopsy results. Patients with Gleason score â¥7 with a positive biopsy result additionally had inferior overall survival compared to those with a negative biopsy result (HRÂ = 1.56; 95% CIÂ =Â 1.04-2.35). Conclusions: Positive post-RT biopsy is associated with increased rates of distant metastases and inferior disease-specific survival in patients treated with definitive RT and was associated with inferior\n\nBreast cancer-specific survival in patients with lymph node-positive hormone receptor-positive invasive breast cancer and Oncotype DX Recurrence Score results in the SEER database.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoberts, Megan C; Miller, Dave P; Shak, Steven; Petkov, Valentina I\n\n2017-06-01\n\nThe Oncotype DX Â® Breast Recurrence Scoreâ¢ (RS) assay is validated to predict breast cancer (BC) recurrence and adjuvant chemotherapy benefit in select patients with lymph node-positive (LN+), hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative BC. We assessed 5-year BC-specific survival (BCSS) in LN+ patients with RS results in SEER databases. In this population-based study, BC cases in SEER registries (diagnosed 2004-2013) were linked to RS results from assays performed by Genomic Health (2004-2014). The primary analysis included only patients (diagnosed 2004-2012) with LN+ (including micrometastases), HR+ (per SEER), and HER2-negative (per RT-PCR) primary invasive BC (NÂ =Â 6768). BCSS, assessed by RS category and number of positive lymph nodes, was calculated using the actuarial method. The proportion of patients with RS results and LN+ disease (NÂ =Â 8782) increased over time between 2004 and 2013, and decreased with increasing lymph node involvement from micrometastases to â¥4 lymph nodes. Five-year BCSS outcomes for those with RSÂ <Â 18 ranged from 98.9% (95% CI 97.4-99.6) for those with micrometastases to 92.8% (95% CI 73.4-98.2) for those with â¥4 lymph nodes. Similar patterns were found for patients with RS 18-30 and RSÂ â¥Â 31. RS group was strongly predictive of BCSS among patients with micrometastases or up to three positive lymph nodes (pÂ <Â 0.001). Overall, 5-year BCSS is excellent for patients with RSÂ <Â 18 and micrometastases, one or two positive lymph nodes, and worsens with additionally involved lymph nodes. Further analyses should account for treatment variables, and longitudinal updates will be important to better characterize utilization of Oncotype DX testing and long-term survival outcomes.\n\n\"Positive\" results increase down the Hierarchy of the Sciences.\n\nPubMed\n\nFanelli, Daniele\n\n2010-04-07\n\nThe hypothesis of a Hierarchy of the Sciences with physical sciences at the top, social sciences at the bottom, and biological sciences in-between is nearly 200 years old. This order is intuitive and reflected in many features of academic life, but whether it reflects the \"hardness\" of scientific research--i.e., the extent to which research questions and results are determined by data and theories as opposed to non-cognitive factors--is controversial. This study analysed 2434 papers published in all disciplines and that declared to have tested a hypothesis. It was determined how many papers reported a \"positive\" (full or partial) or \"negative\" support for the tested hypothesis. If the hierarchy hypothesis is correct, then researchers in \"softer\" sciences should have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases, and therefore report more positive outcomes. Results confirmed the predictions at all levels considered: discipline, domain and methodology broadly defined. Controlling for observed differences between pure and applied disciplines, and between papers testing one or several hypotheses, the odds of reporting a positive result were around 5 times higher among papers in the disciplines of Psychology and Psychiatry and Economics and Business compared to Space Science, 2.3 times higher in the domain of social sciences compared to the physical sciences, and 3.4 times higher in studies applying behavioural and social methodologies on people compared to physical and chemical studies on non-biological material. In all comparisons, biological studies had intermediate values. These results suggest that the nature of hypotheses tested and the logical and methodological rigour employed to test them vary systematically across disciplines and fields, depending on the complexity of the subject matter and possibly other factors (e.g., a field's level of historical and/or intellectual development). On the other hand, these results support the scientific status\n\n[Interpretation of false positive results of biochemical prenatal tests].\n\nPubMed\n\nSieroszewski, Piotr; SÅowakiewicz, Katarzyna; Perenc, MaÅgorzata\n\n2010-03-01\n\nModern, non-invasive prenatal diagnostics based on biochemical and ultrasonographic markers of fetal defects allows us to calculate the risk of fetal chromosomal aneuploidies with high sensitivity and specificity An introduction of biochemical, non-invasive prenatal tests turned out to result in frequent false positive results of these tests in cases when invasive diagnostics does not confirm fetal defects. However prospective analysis of these cases showed numerous complications in the third trimester of the pregnancies.\n\nInflammatory disorders mimicking periprosthetic joint infections may result in false positive Î±-defensin.\n\nPubMed\n\nPlate, Andreas; Stadler, Laura; Sutter, Reto; Anagnostopoulos, Alexia; Frustaci, Dario; Zbinden, Reinhard; Fucentese, Sandro F; Zinkernagel, Annelies S; Zingg, Patrick O; Achermann, Yvonne\n\n2018-02-26\n\nThe antimicrobial peptide Î±-defensin has recently been introduced as potential \"single\" biomarker with a high sensitivity and specificity for the preoperative diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs). However, most studies assessed the benefits of the test with exclusion of patients with rheumatic diseases. We aimed to evaluate the Î±-defensin test in a cohort study without exclusion of cases with inflammatory diseases. Between June 2016 and June 2017, we prospectively included cases with a suspected PJI and an available lateral flow test Î±-defensin (SynovasureÂ®) in synovial fluid. We compared the test result to the diagnostic criteria for PJIs published by an International Consensus Group in 2013. We included 109 cases (49 hips, 60 knees) in which preoperative Î±-defensin tests had been performed. Thereof, 20 PJIs (16 hips, 4 knees) were diagnosed. Preoperative Î±-defensin tests were positive in 25 cases (22.9%) with a test sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 92.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 68.3 - 98.8% and 84.5 - 96.8%, respectively), and a high negative predictive value of 97.6% (95% CI, 91.7 - 99.4%). We interpreted seven Î±-defensin tests as false positive, mainly in cases with inflammatory rheumatic diseases, including crystal deposition diseases. A negative synovial Î±-defensin test can reliably rule out a PJI. However, the test can be false positive in conjunction with an underlying non-infectious inflammatory disease. We therefore propose to use the Î±-defensin test only in addition to MSIS criteria and assessment for crystals in synovial aspirates. Copyright Â© 2018.

David; Fouad, Mona N.; Gelmann, Edward P.; Lamerato, Lois; Reding, Douglas J.; Schoen, Robert E.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nPURPOSE Multiple cancer screening tests have been advocated for the general population; however, clinicians and patients are not always well-informed of screening burdens. We sought to determine the cumulative risk of a false-positive screening result and the resulting risk of a diagnostic procedure for an individual participating in a multimodal cancer screening program. METHODS Data were analyzed from the intervention arm of the ongoing Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, a randomized controlled trial to determine the effects of prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancer screening on disease-specific mortality. The 68,436 participants, aged 55 to 74 years, were randomized to screening or usual care. Women received serial serum tests to detect cancer antigen 125 (CA-125), transvaginal sonograms, posteroanterior-view chest radiographs, and flexible sigmoidoscopies. Men received serial chest radiographs, flexible sigmoidoscopies, digital rectal examinations, and serum prostate-specific antigen tests. Fourteen screening examinations for each sex were possible during the 3-year screening period. RESULTS After 14 tests, the cumulative risk of having at least 1 false-positive screening test is 60.4% (95% CI, 59.8%â61.0%) for men, and 48.8% (95% CI, 48.1%â49.4%) for women. The cumulative risk after 14 tests of undergoing an invasive diagnostic procedure prompted by a false-positive test is 28.5% (CI, 27.8%â29.3%) for men and 22.1% (95% CI, 21.4%â22.7%) for women. CONCLUSIONS For an individual in a multimodal cancer screening trial, the risk of a false-positive finding is about 50% or greater by the 14th test. Physicians should educate patients about the likelihood of false positives and resulting diagnostic interventions when counseling about cancer screening.

In this study, we aimed to explore the association between food additives and CU by using the basophil activation test (BAT). The BAT using 15 common food additives was performed for 15 patients with CU who had a history of recurrent urticarial aggravation following intake of various foods without a definite food-specific IgE. Of the 15 patients studied, two (13.3%) showed positive BAT results for one of the tested food additives. One patient responded to monosodium glutamate, showing 18.7% of CD203c-positive basophils. Another patient showed a positive BAT result to sodium benzoate. Both patients had clinical correlations with the agents, which were partly determined by elimination diets. The present study suggested that at least a small proportion of patients with CU had symptoms associated with food additives. The results may suggest the potential utility of the BAT to identity the role of food additives in CU.\n\nThe health system impact of false positive newborn screening results for medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency: a cohort study.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaraceper, Maria D; Chakraborty, Pranesh; Coyle, Doug; Wilson, Kumanan; Kronick, Jonathan B; Hawken, Steven; Davies, Christine; Brownell, Marni; Dodds, Linda; Feigenbaum, Annette; Fell, Deshayne B; Grosse, Scott D; Guttmann, Astrid; Laberge, Anne-Marie; Mhanni, Aizeddin; Miller, Fiona A; Mitchell, John J; Nakhla, Meranda; Prasad, Chitra; Rockman-Greenberg, Cheryl; Sparkes, Rebecca; Wilson, Brenda J; Potter, Beth K\n\n2016-02-03\n\nThere is no consensus in the literature regarding the impact of false positive newborn screening results on early health care utilization patterns. We evaluated the impact of false positive newborn screening results for medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) in a cohort of Ontario infants. The cohort included all children who received newborn screening in Ontario between April 1, 2006 and March 31, 2010. Newborn screening and diagnostic confirmation results were linked to province-wide health care administrative datasets covering physician visits, emergency department visits, and inpatient hospitalizations, to determine health service utilization from April 1, 2006 through March 31, 2012. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were used to compare those with false positive results for MCADD to those with negative newborn screening results, stratified by age at service use. We identified 43 infants with a false positive newborn screening result for MCADD during the study period. These infants experienced significantly higher rates of physician visits (IRR: 1.42) and hospitalizations (IRR: 2.32) in the first year of life relative to a screen negative cohort in adjusted analyses. Differences in health services use were not observed after the first year of life. The higher use of some health services among false positive infants during the first year of life may be explained by a psychosocial impact of false positive results on parental perceptions of infant health, and/or by differences in underlying health status. Understanding the impact of false positive newborn screening results can help to inform newborn screening programs in designing support and education for families. This is particularly important as additional disorders are added to expanded screening panels, yielding important clinical benefits for affected children but also a higher frequency of false positive findings.\n\nGreen Positive Guidance and Green Positive Life Counseling for Decent Work and Decent Lives: Some Empirical Results\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDi Fabio, Annamaria; Bucci, Ornella\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis article discusses green positive guidance and green positive life counseling for decent work and decent lives. From a green guidance perspective, the connectedness to nature construct is important both in terms of the meaning of work and life construction. The study discussed in this article analyzed the relationship between empathy and connectedness to nature, controlling for the effects of fluid intelligence and personality traits. In this connection, the Advanced Progressive Matrices, the Big Five Questionnaire, and the Interpersonal Reactivity Index were administered to 144 Italian high school students. The study revealed that connecteness to nature was not associated with fluid intelligence and was only moderately associated with personality traits. It was empathy that showed the highest association with connectedness to nature. The results open new opportunities for future research and interventions in green positive guidance/life counseling and green positive decent work.

Materials and methods. Results in the Isere region (12%) have prompted a review of the correlation between the call back rate and indicators of quality (detection rate, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value) for the radiologists providing interpretations during that time period. Three groups of radiologists were identified: the group with call back rate of 10% achieved the best results (sensitivity: 92%, detection rate: 0.53%, specificity: 90%). The group with lowest call back rate (7.7%) showed insufficient sensitivity (58%). The last group with call back rate of 18.3%, showed no improvement in sensitivity (82%) and detection rate (0.53%), but showed reduced specificity (82%). The protocol update in 2001 does not resolve this problematic situation and national results continue to demonstrate a high percentage of positive screening mammograms. A significant increase in the number of positive screening examinations compared to recommended guidelines is not advantageous and leads to an overall decrease in the quality of the screening.\n\nAdditional road markings as an indication of speed limits: results of a field experiment and a driving simulator study.\n\nPubMed\n\nDaniels, Stijn; Vanrie, Jan; Dreesen, An; Brijs, Tom\n\n2010-05-01\n\nAlthough speed limits are indicated by road signs, road users are not always aware, while driving, of the actual speed limit on a given road segment. The Roads and Traffic Agency developed additional road markings in order to support driver decisions on speed on 70 km/h roads in Flanders-Belgium. In this paper the results are presented of two evaluation studies, both a field study and a simulator study, on the effects of the additional road markings on speed behaviour. The results of the field study showed no substantial effect of the markings on speed behaviour. Neither did the simulator study, with slightly different stimuli. Nevertheless an effect on lateral position was noticed in the simulator study, showing at least some effect of the markings. The role of conspicuity of design elements and expectations towards traffic environments is discussed. Both studies illustrate well some strengths and weaknesses of observational field studies compared to experimental simulator studies. Copyright (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The system, which utilizes a magnetically levitated fine stage to provide ultra-precise positioning in all six degrees of freedom, incorporates technological improvements resulting from four years of prototype development experience. System enhancements, implemented on a second generation design for an ARPA National Center for Advanced Information Component Manufacturing (NCAICM) project, introduced active structural control for the levitated structure of the system. Magnetic levitation (maglev) is emerging as an important technology for wafer positioning systems in advanced lithography applications. The advantages ofmoreÂ Â» maglev stem from the absence of physical contact. The resulting lack of friction enables accurate, fast positioning. Maglev systems are mechanically simple, accomplishing full six degree-of-freedom suspension and control with a minimum of moving parts. Power-efficient designs, which reduce the possibility of thermal distortion of the platen, are achievable. Manufacturing throughput will be improved in future systems with the addition of active structural control of the positioning stages. This paper describes the design, implementation, and functional capability of the maglev fine positioning system. Specifics regarding performance design goals and test results are presented.Â«Â less\n\nMultiple factors contribute to positive results for hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin M antibody.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlatoom, Adnan; Ansari, M Qasim; Cuthbert, Jennifer\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIn the United States, a successful vaccination program for hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection has decreased both its incidence and the true positive rate for diagnostic immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to HAV in acute hepatitis. To survey positive results of HAV IgM tests and determine the effect of changing ordering options. We reviewed all positive results for IgM antibody to HAV between January 2007 and December 2010. Patient demographics, clinical history, and laboratory data were recorded and the encounter, order, and reason for test reviewed. Each result was categorized as indicating acute, recent, resolved, or indeterminate HAV infection. A total of 10,735 tests were performed; 35 patients had 49 positive results. Most positive test results were associated with outpatient visits and were ordered in the assessment of patients with liver disease, but not clinical acute hepatitis. In the final analysis, 4 patients had acute hepatitis A and 20 individual patients had recent and/or resolved hepatitis. All but 1 of the remaining 11 patients had another established cause of liver disease with a positive IgM HAV antibody test result; data to determine causality were insufficient. The total number of tests requested annually decreased more than 35% with the introduction of computerized physician order entry. Current assays for IgM HAV antibodies are overused in the absence of clinical acute hepatitis; future clinical decision support may improve patterns of order entry. Most patients have findings consistent with HAV exposure but not acute hepatitis; dormant viral infection may be a continuing source of antigen.\n\nRisk for Neurobehavioral Disinhibition in Prenatal Methamphetamine-Exposed Young Children with Positive Hair Toxicology Results\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHimes, Sarah K.; LaGasse, Linda L.; Derauf, Chris; Newman, Elana; Smith, Lynne M.; Arria, Amelia M.; Grotta, Sheri A. Della; Dansereau, Lynne M.; Abar, Beau; Neal, Charles R.; Lester, Barry M.; Huestis, Marilyn A.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground The objective was to evaluate effects of prenatal methamphetamine exposure (PME) and postnatal drug exposures identified by child hair analysis on neurobehavioral disinhibition at 6.5 years of age. Methods Mother-infant pairs were enrolled in the Infant Development, Environment, and Lifestyle (IDEAL) Study in Los Angeles, Honolulu, Tulsa and Des Moines. PME was determined by maternal self-report and/or positive meconium results. At the 6.5-year follow-up visit, hair was collected and analyzed for methamphetamine, tobacco, cocaine, and cannabinoid markers. Child behavioral and executive function test scores were aggregated to evaluate child neurobehavioral disinhibition. Hierarchical linear regression models assessed the impact of PME, postnatal substances, and combined PME with postnatal drug exposures on the childâs neurobehavioral disinhibition aggregate score. Past year caregiver substance use was compared to child hair results. Results A total of 264 children were evaluated. Significantly more PME children (n=133) had hair positive for methamphetamine/amphetamine (27.1% versus 8.4%) and nicotine/cotinine (38.3% versus 25.2%) than children without PME (n=131). Overall, no significant differences in analyte hair concentrations were noted between groups. Significant differences in behavioral and executive function were observed between children with and without PME. No independent effects of postnatal methamphetamine or tobacco exposure, identified by positive hair test, were noted and no additional neurobehavioral disinhibition was observed in PME children with postnatal drug exposures, as compared to PME children without postnatal exposure. Conclusions Child hair testing offered a non-invasive means to evaluate postnatal environmental drug exposure, although no effects from postnatal drug exposure alone were seen. PME, alone and in combination with postnatal drug exposures, was associated with behavioral and executive function deficits at 6.5 years\n\nBuffer substitution in malaria rapid diagnostic tests causes false-positive results\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBackground Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are kits that generally include 20 to 25 test strips or cassettes, but only a single buffer vial. In field settings, laboratory staff occasionally uses saline, distilled water (liquids for parenteral drugs dilution) or tap water as substitutes for the RDT kit's buffer to compensate for the loss of a diluent bottle. The present study assessed the effect of buffer substitution on the RDT results. Methods Twenty-seven RDT brands were run with EDTA-blood samples of five malaria-free subjects, who were negative for rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies. Saline, distilled water and tap water were used as substitute liquids. RDTs were also run with distilled water, without adding blood. Results were compared to those obtained with the RDT kit's buffer and Plasmodium positive samples. Results Only eight cassettes (in four RDT brands) showed no control line and were considered invalid. Visible test lines occurred for at least one malaria-free sample and one of the substitutes in 20/27 (74%) RDT brands (saline: n = 16; distilled water: n = 17; and tap water: n = 20), and in 15 RDTs which were run with distilled water only. They occurred for all Plasmodium antigens and RDT formats (two-, three- and four-band RDTs). Clearance of the background of the strip was excellent except for saline. The aspects (colour, intensity and crispness) of the control and the false-positive test lines were similar to those obtained with the RDT kits' buffer and Plasmodium positive samples. Conclusion Replacement of the RDT kit's dedicated buffer by saline, distilled water and tap water can cause false-positive test results.

The aim of this study was therefore to determine whether a telephone reminder call could increase the acceptance rate of colonoscopy in patients with a positive FIT. We performed FITs for asymptomatic participants aged 50Â years or older. For patients with a positive FIT, a colonoscopy was recommended via mailing notification only (control group) or via a telephone reminder call after mailing notification (intervention group). The calls informed patients about the significance of a positive FIT and encouraged a colonoscopy following positive FITs. The FIT results were positive in 90 of 8,318 patients who received FITs. Fifty patients were advised to receive colonoscopy via mailing notification only, and 40 patients were advised via both a telephone reminder call and a mailing notification. The acceptance rate of colonoscopy was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (pÂ =Â 0.038). The lesion-detection rate for an advanced neoplasia was also significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (pÂ =Â 0.046). According to multivariate logistic regression analysis, a telephone reminder was a significant determinant of colonoscopy acceptance in patients with a positive FIT (OR 4.33; 95% CI, 1.19-15.75; pÂ =Â 0.026). Telephone reminder calls in addition to mailing notification improved the acceptance rate of colonoscopy in patients with a positive FIT.\n\nFalse-Positive Results after Environmental Pinworm PCR Testing due to Rhabditid Nematodes in Corncob Bedding\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLeblanc, Mathias; Berry, Kristina; Graciano, Sandy; Becker, Brandon; Reuter, Jon D\n\n2014-01-01\n\nModern rodent colonies are housed in individually ventilated cages to protect the animals from contamination with adventitious pathogens. Standard health monitoring through soiled-bedding sentinels does not always detect infections, especially in the context of low pathogen prevalence. Recently proposed alternatives include analyzing environmental samples from the cages or rack exhaust by PCR to improve the detection of rodent pathogens but optimal sampling strategies have not yet been established for different microorganisms. Although generally very sensitive and specific, these molecular assays are not foolproof and subject to false-positive and ânegative results and should always be interpreted cautiously with an overall understanding of the intrinsic controls and all the variables that may affect the results. Here, we report a limited Aspiculuris tetraptera outbreak in a mouse barrier facility that was detected by fecal PCR in sentinels and confirmed by fecal flotation and direct cecal examination of both sentinels and colony animals. The outbreak led to a widespread survey of all facilities for pinworms by using environmental PCR from ventilated rack exhaust plenums. Environmental PCR suggested an unexpected widespread contamination of all ventilated racks holding nonautoclaved cages, but results could not be confirmed in sentinel or colony animals by fecal flotation, cecal and colonic examination, or cage PCR testing. After additional investigation, the unexpected environmental PCR results were confirmed as false-positive findings due to the nonspecificity of the assay, leading to the amplification of rhabditid nematodes, which are not infectious in rodents but which contaminated the corncob bedding.

The Uganda Ministry of Health currently recommends the serial rapid testing algorithm with Determine, STAT-PAK, and Uni-Gold for diagnosis of HIV infection. Using this algorithm, individuals who test positive on Determine, negative to STAT-PAK and positive to Uni-Gold are reported as HIV positive. We conducted further testing on this subgroup of samples using qualitative DNA PCR to assess the potential for false positive tests in this situation. Results Of the 3388 individuals who were tested, 984 were HIV positive on two consecutive tests, and 29 were considered positive by a tiebreaker (positive on Determine, negative on STAT-PAK, and positive on Uni-Gold). However, when the 29 samples were further tested using qualitative DNA PCR, 14 (48.2%) were HIV negative. Conclusion Although this study was not primarily designed to assess the validity of rapid HIV tests and thus only a subset of the samples were retested, the findings show a potential for false positive HIV results in the subset of individuals who test positive when a tiebreaker test is used in serial testing. These findings highlight a need for confirmatory testing for this category of individuals.

Should, as Millard advocated, to recreate the initial defect and include it in the mastectomy scar or is it better in an additional incision as have others authors. This study compares the long-term morphological results of these two attitudes, with or without additional incision. Eighty-two breast reconstructions by latissimus dorsi flap and prosthesis implantation, with a mean follow-up of 9.5 years were scored from 1 to 5 by a panel of expert and non-expert. The patients scored also their own reconstruction. Various parameters of the reconstructed breast were thus evaluated. We compared the results, according to the positioning of the skin paddle: with additional incision (50 cases); without additional incision (32 cases). The characteristics of the mastectomy scar on the breast area, high or low, horizontal or oblique, defined 6 groups where the results of the 2 surgical options were compared. Only the reconstructions with additional incision get significantly higher results than those without additional incision (P<0.05). This involves the two panels, in the case of high mastectomy scars. In the others cases the additional incision is not essential. If the realization of an additional incision can be perceived like misfit on an area already \"mutilated\", we plead for this solution in selected cases. This provides a benefit stable in time, in terms of overall results, shape and even rendering scar. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Hemorrhoids might be a plausible cause of FP results. To determine the contribution of hemorrhoids to the frequency of FP FIT results. Retrospective analysis from prospective cohort study. Five large teaching hospitals, including 1 academic hospital. All subjects scheduled for elective colonoscopy. FIT before bowel preparation. Frequency of FP FIT results in subjects with hemorrhoids as the only relevant abnormality compared with FP FIT results in subjects with no relevant abnormalities. Logistic regression analysis to determine colonic abnormalities influencing FP results. In 2855 patients, 434 had positive FIT results: 213 had advanced neoplasia and 221 had FP results. In 9 individuals (4.1%; 95% CI, 1.4-6.8) with an FP FIT result, hemorrhoids were the only abnormality. In univariate unadjusted analysis, subjects with hemorrhoids as the only abnormality did not have more positive results (9/134; 6.7%) compared with subjects without any abnormalities (43/886; 4.9%; P = .396). Logistic regression identified hemorrhoids, nonadvanced polyps, and a group of miscellaneous abnormalities, all significantly influencing false positivity. Of 1000 subjects with hemorrhoids, 67 would have FP results, of whom 18 would have FP results because of hemorrhoids only. Potential underreporting of hemorrhoids; high-risk individuals. Hemorrhoids in individuals participating in colorectal cancer screening will probably not lead to a substantial number of false-positive test results.

Currently, there is an enzyme immunoassay available to detect GM in biological samples, the Plateliaâ¢ Aspergillus EIA. In this study, the reproducibility of positive results obtained using this assay was evaluated using serum samples from neutropenic patients. A trend toward lower values was observed, and 55Â %(27/49) of positive results were negative after retesting. A low reproducibility of positive results for the detection of GM in serum was observed.\n\nDifferentiating positive and negative self-rated health: results from a cross-sectional study in Estonia.\n\nPubMed\n\nReile, Rainer; Leinsalu, Mall\n\n2013-08-01\n\nTo examine possible differences in the correlates of positive and negative self-rated health (SRH). Data for 2,127 men and 2,385 women in the 25-74 age group came from the Estonian Health Interview Survey 2006. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to study the association of socio-demographic, physical and psychological health and well-being characteristics with positive (good or very good) and negative (bad or very bad) SRH as compared to fair SRH. Negative SRH was related to male gender, the presence of chronic illnesses, limitations in daily activities and physical functioning, emotional distress, an external locus of control, and to low satisfaction with life and physical fitness. These indicators (except satisfaction with life) were also related to positive SRH, presenting a mirrored pattern of association. Additionally, positive SRH was related to younger age, an Estonian ethnic identity, and to higher education and income. Although SRH forms a ill/healthy continuum when physical and psychological health characteristics are considered, the broader spectrum of predictors indicates that positive SRH and negative SRH are two distinct and alternative concepts.\n\nDoes the highâtech industry consistently reduce CO{sub 2} emissions?
