        "text": "This is a list of cheeses by place of origin. Cheese is a milk-based food that is produced in wide-ranging flavors, textures, and forms. Hundreds of types of cheese from various countries are produced. Their styles, textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk (including the animal's diet), whether they have been pasteurized, the butterfat content, the bacteria and mold, the processing, and aging.\n\nHerbs, spices, or wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents. The yellow to red color of many cheeses, such as Red Leicester, is normally formed from adding annatto. While most current varieties of cheese may be traced to a particular locale, or culture, within a single country, some have a more diffuse origin, and cannot be considered to have originated in a particular place, but are associated with a whole region, such as queso blanco in Latin America.\n\nCheese is an ancient food whose origins predate recorded history. There is no conclusive evidence indicating where cheesemaking originated, either in Europe, Central Asia or the Middle East, but the practice had spread within Europe prior to Roman times and, according to Pliny the Elder, had become a sophisticated enterprise by the time the Roman Empire came into existence.[1]\n\nAfrica\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: African cuisine\n\nEgypt\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Egyptian cheese\n\nSee also: Egyptian cuisine\n\nName Image Region Description Areesh Originated in Egypt, it is similar to cottage cheese. Shanklish, a fermented cheese, is made from areesh cheese.[2] Domiati A soft white salty cheese made primarily in Egypt,[3] but also in Sudan and other Middle Eastern countries. Karish Made from Laban Rayeb, a curdled milk product Mish A traditional Egyptian cheese that is made by fermenting salty cheese for several months or years. Roumy cheese Also known as \"ras cheese\", roumy is one of the main types of cheese in Egypt. It has a distinctive smell, and different degrees of salty taste according to the stage of aging.\n\nEthiopia\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Ethiopian cuisine\n\nName Image Region Description Ayibe A cottage cheese that is mild and crumbly. It has little flavor on its own, and is often served as a side dish to soften the effect of very spicy food.\n\nMauritania\n\n[edit]\n\nName Image Region Description Caravane cheese The brand name of a camel milk cheese produced in Mauritania by Tiviski, a company founded by Nancy Abeiderrhamane in 1987. The milk used to make the cheese is collected from the local animals of a thousand nomadic herdsmen, and is very difficult to produce, but yields a product that is low in lactose.\n\nSouth Africa\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: South African cuisine\n\nName Image Region Description Bokmakiri cheese A type of soft goat's milk cheese made in South Africa. Kwaito cheese A mild, creamy cows milk cheese made by the Indezi River Cheese Company in South Africa.\n\nAsia\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Asian cuisine\n\nArmenia\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Armenian cuisine\n\nName Image Region Description Chechil A brined string cheese that originated in Armenia and Anatolia, it has a consistency approximating that of suluguni or mozarella and is produced in the form of dense strings, rolled up in a figure eight of thick braid-shaped ropes.
