As shown in Figure 1, the samples C1, C2, C4, and C5 were located to the right of the first dimension, and C1 (control), C2 (reduced sodium), an C4 (reduced sodium with addition of yeast extract) were characterized by the descriptors typical aroma, buttery aroma, typical flavor, buttery flavor, and salty taste. The sample C5 (reduced sodium with oregano extract) was characterized by fine herbs aroma, fine herbs flavor, sour taste, and bitter taste. On the contrary, the sample C3 was characterized by sour aroma and sweet taste. The samples C1, C2, and C4 were not significantly discriminated in the first 2 dimensions of the PCA because their confidence ellipses overlapped.\n\nRegarding the sensory profile of the experimental cheeses, although the formulations C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5 were statistically different from each other (P < 0.05) for the attribute appearance, the cheeses C1, C2, C4, and C5 showed lower brightness and a more yellowish color. The formulation C3 presented the highest score for the attribute brightness (10.05) and the lowest score for yellow color (2.51), which stood out as the clearest sample with significant differences from the others (P < 0.05). This lighter color may be due to the presence of arginine used as a flavor enhancer.\n\nFelicio et al., 2016\n\nFelicio T.L.\n\nEsmerino E.A.\n\nVidal V.A.S.\n\nCappato L.P.\n\nGarcia R.K.A.\n\nCavalcanti R.N.\n\nFreitas M.Q.\n\nConte Junior, C.A.\n\nPadilha M.C.\n\nSilva M.C.\n\nRaices R.S.L.\n\nArellano D.B.\n\nBollini H.M.A.\n\nPollonio M.A.R.\n\nCruz A.G.\n\nPhysico-chemical changes during storage and sensory acceptance of low sodium probiotic Minas cheese added with arginine.\n\nstudied Minas Frescal cheese and found that arginine negatively affected the visual appearance of the cheeses due to the water retention capacity of this AA in the cheese matrix.\n\nAccording to\n\nCruz et al., 2011\n\nCruz A.G.\n\nFaria J.A.F.\n\nPollonio M.A.R.\n\nBolini H.M.A.\n\nCeleghini R.M.S.\n\nGranato D.\n\nShah N.P.\n\nCheeses with reduced sodium content: Effects on functionality, public health benefits and sensory properties.\n\n, salt is also described as a factor that influences the formation and development of aroma compounds. However, the samples C1 (control with 100% NaCl) and C2 (reduced sodium without the addition of flavor enhancers) were very similar for all aroma-related attributes (P > 0.05). The addition of flavor enhancers (C3, C4, and C5) affected the attribute aroma, with significant differences among the samples (P < 0.05). No significant (P > 0.05) differences were observed for the sweet aroma for all cheeses. The formulation C3 (reduced sodium with the addition of arginine) presented the lowest score for typical aroma (2.04) and buttery aroma (2.85); thus, it was considered the sourest sample (6.16), with significant differences from the others (P < 0.05). For the aroma of the fine herbs, the sample C5 (reduced sodium with the addition of oregano extract) received the highest score (13.59), with a significant difference (P < 0.05) among the samples. The higher intensity of fine herbs aroma in cheese C5 is due to oregano, which is an aromatic plant widely used in raw or cooked foods, yielding a distinct and pleasant aroma and taste (\n\nCamo et al., 2011\n\nCamo J.\n\nLorés A.\n\nDjenane D.\n\nBeltrán J.A.\n\nRoncalés P.\n\nDisplay life of beef packaged with an antioxidant active film as a function of the concentration of oregano extract.\n\n).\n\nSignificant differences were also observed for the attribute flavor among the treatments (P < 0.05). The sample C3 (reduced sodium with the addition of arginine) presented the lowest score for the descriptor buttery flavor (3.06; P < 0.05), although similar scores were observed among the samples. The samples C1 and C2 (reduced sodium without the addition of flavor enhancers) had the highest scores (9.81 and 9.61, respectively) for the typical prato cheese flavor. In addition, significant differences were observed for the samples C3, C4, and C5 when compared with the control (P < 0.05), and C3 showed the lowest score (2.13) for this descriptor. This result reveals that the addition of flavor enhancers can modify the descriptor typical flavor. The sample C5 (reduced sodium with the addition of oregano extract) presented the highest score for the descriptor fine herbs flavor (13.75), as also reported for fine herbs aroma, with significant differences (P < 0.05) from all formulations.\n\nFor the attribute taste, the formulations presented a very distinct profile. The sample C1 (control) presented the highest score (8.41) with significant differences (P < 0.05) when compared with C2 (reduced sodium without the addition of flavor enhancer; 6.27). This result is in accordance with\n\nDa Silva et al., 2014\n\nDa Silva T.L.T.\n\nDe Souza V.R.\n\nPinheiro A.C.M.\n\nNunes C.A.\n\nFreire T.V.M.\n\nEquivalence salting and temporal dominance of sensations analysis for different sodium chloride substitutes in cream cheese.\n\n, who found that most of the sodium substitutes had salting potencies below that of sodium chloride. However, 2 samples containing flavor enhancers, C4 (reduced sodium with the addition of yeast extract) and C5 (reduced sodium with the addition of oregano extract), showed mean scores similar to C1 (9.11 and 8.87, respectively), without significant differences (P > 0.05). Thus, for the trained panelists, the flavor enhancers used in C4 and C5 led to an equivalent saltiness when compared with the control. Flavor enhancers are responsible for umami, brothy, and savory taste, which can be an opportunity to produce low-sodium products with high saltiness intensity (\n\nDesmond, 2006\n\nDesmond E.\n\nReducing salt: A challenge for the meat industry.\n\n). Although the formulation C3 (reduced sodium with addition of arginine) contained the flavor enhancer, it exhibited the lowest score for salty taste (5.07), differing significantly (P < 0.05) from the other formulations. The significant difference may be due to the AA arginine, which retained water in cheese and possibly decreased the salt concentration. Regarding sweet taste, the samples presented low and similar scores. For the descriptors sour taste and bitter taste, the sample C5 (reduced sodium with the addition of oregano extract) presented the highest scores for both descriptors (7.44 and 8.86, respectively; P < 0.05) and the highest score (9.79) for bitter aftertaste.\n\nGhawi et al., 2014\n\nGhawi S.K.\n\nRowland I.\n\nMethven L.\n\nEnhancing consumer liking of low salt tomato soup over repeated exposure by herb and spice seasonings.\n\nfound a significant increase in bitterness with the addition of oregano in reduced-salt soup, which may be undesirable to some consumers. However, it was observed that the other samples containing flavor enhancers, C3 and C4, had lower scores for bitter taste when compared with the sample without addition of flavor enhancer (C2; P < 0.05), which was similar to the control (C1; P > 0.05). This result suggests that the flavor enhancers, in the amount used in the present study, were able to mask the bitter taste produced by the partial replacement of NaCl with KCl.\n\nRegarding the attribute texture, the control sample (C1) showed the highest average for hardness (6.75). This finding is in agreement with the results of\n\nAyyash et al., 2013\n\nAyyash M.M.\n\nSherkat F.\n\nShah N.P.\n\nEffect of partial NaCl substitution with KCl on the texture profile, microstructure, and sensory properties of low-moisture mozzarella cheese.\n\n,\n\nAyyash and Shah, 2011b\n\nAyyash M.M.\n\nShah N.P.\n\nThe effect of substituting NaCl with KCl on Nabulsi cheese: Chemical composition, total viable count, and texture profile.\n\n, and\n\nAyyash et al., 2011\n\nAyyash M.M.\n\nSherkat F.\n\nFrancis P.\n\nWilliams R.P.W.\n\nShah N.P.\n\nThe effect of sodium chloride substitution with potassium chloride on texture profile and microstructure of Halloumi cheese.\n\n, who reported an increase in hardness of Mozzarella, Halloumi, and Nabulsi salted with only NaCl when compared with those made with partial replacement of NaCl with KCl. Sample C5 had a lower hardness (4.61) and fracturability (2.94). It is assumed that a less-hard cheese fractures less easily because it is softer, which justifies the values found for these 2 descriptors. This sample also presented higher cohesiveness (10.93) and adhesiveness (8.01). In contrast, the sample C3 showed the highest fracturability score (8.49) and lower cohesiveness (3.72) and adhesiveness (3.16).\n\nTDS\n\nUnlike QDA, which is a technique of static perception, TDS provided dominance curves to illustrate the temporal changes of dominant attributes during and after the chewing process. According to\n\nRodrigues et al., 2014\n\nRodrigues J.F.\n\nGonçalves C.S.\n\nPereira R.C.\n\nCarneiro J.D.S.\n\nPinheiro A.C.M.\n\nUtilization of temporal dominance of sensations and time intensity methodology for development of low-sodium Mozzarella cheese using a mixture of salts.\n\n, the TDS technique is also relevant for the development of reduced-sodium products. The use of other salts as NaCl substitutes can promote unpleasant tastes such as metallic, bitter, and astringent, and this temporal analysis allows for a descriptive evaluation of the products throughout chewing time. Figure 2 shows the smoothed TDS curves with the sensory profile of the samples (C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5) related to the attributes buttery, fine herbs, salty, sweet, sour, and bitter throughout the 35 s of evaluation. Both the chance level (0.13) and the significant level (0.25) were determined and plotted on the TDS curves for interpretation of the results.\n\nThe TDS curves show that the formulation C1 (control) presented 3 dominant flavors. The first perceived and mainly dominant sensation was salty, with a maximum salinity dominance rate of approximately 0.48, perceived during 12 s. However, the reduced-sodium probiotic prato cheeses containing KCl (C2, C3, C4, and C5) did not result in the perception of salty taste and did not reach the significance level. These results are in accordance with\n\nCruz et al., 2011\n\nCruz A.G.\n\nFaria J.A.F.\n\nPollonio M.A.R.\n\nBolini H.M.A.\n\nCeleghini R.M.S.\n\nGranato D.\n\nShah N.P.\n\nCheeses with reduced sodium content: Effects on functionality, public health benefits and sensory properties.\n\n, who stated that NaCl is the only salt that promotes the manifestation of a pure salty taste. However,\n\nRodrigues et al., 2014\n\nRodrigues J.F.\n\nGonçalves C.S.\n\nPereira R.C.\n\nCarneiro J.D.S.\n\nPinheiro A.C.M.\n\nUtilization of temporal dominance of sensations and time intensity methodology for development of low-sodium Mozzarella cheese using a mixture of salts.\n\nreported that it is possible to make Mozzarella cheese using an NaCl and KCl blend, which exhibited a salty taste similar to that made only with NaCl. The sour and bitter tastes were observed in sample C1, with a low dominance rate and duration of 2 s and 4 s. Prato cheese undergoes a more intense proteolysis and may present this defect (bitter taste) during ripening (\n\nAugusto et al., 2005\n\nAugusto M.M.M.\n\nQueiroz M.I.\n\nViotto W.H.\n\nSeleção e treinamento de julgadores para avaliação do gosto amargo em queijo prato.\n\n).\n\nAs shown in the TDS dominance curves, the buttery, sour, and bitter sensations were dominant in C2 (reduced sodium without the addition of flavor enhancers). The buttery flavor occurred with a low dominance rate during 4s, whereas the sour and bitter tastes were perceived as dominant for a duration of 3 and 1 s, respectively. Sodium reduction in foods not only reduces the perceived saltiness but also is associated with a wide range of complex taste interactions, which may negatively affect the liking of foods. In turn, potassium chloride elicits weak saltiness and metallic and bitter taste at higher concentrations, thus limiting its utility in food (\n\nLiem et al., 2011\n\nLiem D.G.\n\nMiremadi F.\n\nKeast R.S.J.\n\nReducing sodium in foods: The effect on flavor.\n\n). Also, KCl tends to cause considerable sourness perception in addition to increasing proteolysis, water activity, acidity, and lower firmness (\n\nCruz et al., 2011\n\nCruz A.G.\n\nFaria J.A.F.\n\nPollonio M.A.R.\n\nBolini H.M.A.\n\nCeleghini R.M.S.\n\nGranato D.\n\nShah N.P.\n\nCheeses with reduced sodium content: Effects on functionality, public health benefits and sensory properties.\n\n).\n\nThe TDS curves showed that the sample C3 (reduced sodium with the addition of arginine) presented 2 dominant sensations, sour and bitter tastes. The bitter taste occurred with a high dominance rate between 15 and 20 s, whereas the sour taste was perceived as dominant for 10 s. For the sample C4, buttery and sour were the 2 dominant sensations observed. The buttery taste occurred with a low dominance rate and was perceived during 5 s. The sour taste was perceived as dominant by 36% of the panelists for a duration of 12 s. The sour taste was identified as dominant in most of the formulations with partial substitution of NaCl by KCl. According to\n\nDa Silva et al., 2014\n\nDa Silva T.L.T.\n\nDe Souza V.R.\n\nPinheiro A.C.M.\n\nNunes C.A.\n\nFreire T.V.M.\n\nEquivalence salting and temporal dominance of sensations analysis for different sodium chloride substitutes in cream cheese.\n\n, the NaCl substitutes often generate undesirable tastes in strong intensity. The use of salt substitutes is mainly limited due to the association of nonsalty tastes, especially sour taste.\n\nThe TDS curves also show that sample C5 presented 2 dominant flavors, fine herbs and bitter taste, whereas the term fine herbs was perceived as mainly dominant in sample C5 by 64% of panelists during 25 s, probably due to the presence of oregano, a flavor enhancer used in this sample. The bitter taste was perceived with a low dominance for a duration of 6 s. According to\n\nGhawi et al., 2014\n\nGhawi S.K.\n\nRowland I.\n\nMethven L.\n\nEnhancing consumer liking of low salt tomato soup over repeated exposure by herb and spice seasonings.\n\n, herbs and spices added must be carefully studied to avoid intense flavor that might detract from the main flavor of the product. In addition, the use of KCl as a substitute for NaCl results in the perception of bitter taste during chewing by TDS analysis, which was perceived as dominant in almost all samples, surpassing the significant level. However, sample C4 (reduced sodium with the addition of yeast extract) did not reach this level. This result suggests that the effect of the flavor enhancer yeast extract in reduced-sodium probiotic prato cheese minimized the perception of unpleasant taste (bitterness) and stood out as the most suitable flavor enhancer for masking the off-flavors. Yeast extracts are a natural source of several volatile compounds and have been widely used as flavoring agents and as precursors to the formation of pleasant compounds responsible for flavor and aroma (\n\nMahadevan and Farmer, 2006\n\nMahadevan K.\n\nFarmer L.\n\nKey odor impact compounds in three yeast extract pastes.\n\n). Flavor enhancers can confer the umami, brothy, and savory flavors in foods; thus, it can be used to improve the flavor of reduced-sodium products (\n\nBrandsma, 2006\n\nBrandsma I.\n\nReducing sodium: A European perspective.\n\n)."
