        "text": "The production of a beverage from whey butter cheese (WBC) and acerola juice (AJ) presents good commercialization potential, uniting the benefits provided by the former with those of latter, including the ingestion of essential amino acids and increasing the vitamin C content, resulting in a product of differentiated nutritive value. Three beverage formulations were developed: B1 (50% WBC–50% AJ v/v),\n\nThis review focused on the historical, marketing, technological, and microbiological characteristics of artisanal Brazilian cheese. Brazilian cheese production was introduced and developed from the influence of immigrants considering the combination of climate, races of the animals, quality and specificity of milk, technological cheese-making processes and environmental microbiology, among other factors. It resulted in cheese products with specific physicochemical, microbiological, and sensory quality, which represent the heritage and identities of the different Brazilian regions. The production of artisanal cheese increased in many Brazilian regions, mainly in the southeast, especially due to the traditional production and innovative development of new varieties of cheese. The microbiological quality and safety of raw-milk artisanal cheese continues to be a concern and many studies have been focusing on this matter. Special attention needs to be given to the cheeses produced by raw...\n\nThe aim of this study was to develop a Petit-Suisse cheese with different concentrations of fat and thickener using a differentiated milk matrix: sheep milk. A central composite design was used to analyze the effects of fat and thickener concentrations on the properties of the cheese. Fat exerted an influence on ash (1.20 to 1.50%) and pH (5.46 to 5.78). Fat and thickener affected elasticity, firmness and gumminess. The quantitative descriptive analysis revealed that the best formulation was 8% fat and 1% thickener. Petit-Suisse cheese made from lactose-free sheep milk is viable with medium concentrations of fat and thickener.\n\nThis study aimed to evaluate the effect of casein to fat ratios (0.68, 0.72, and 0.76) on the functional properties of Prato cheese at 2, 15, 30, and 45 days of ripening. The different ratios did not interfere with the physicochemical characteristics, pH, Aw, proteolysis indices, color parameters, sliceability and sensory profile of the cheeses among the treatments. However, pH, proteolysis indices, texture profile, L* and b* color parameters of the cheeses changed through the ripening time. The cheeses made from milk standardized to casein/fat ratio of 0.68 presented lower chewiness values. The casein to fat ratio of 0.68 increased the protein and fat recoveries, and provided greater meltability and greater formation of free oil when compared to cheeses made from milk with casein to fat ratio of 0.76. Therefore, casein to fat ratio of 0.72 is recommended for the production of Prato cheese as the cheese presents good functional properties at this value, such as intermediate melting..."
