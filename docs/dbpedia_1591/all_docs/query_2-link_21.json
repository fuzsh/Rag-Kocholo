        "text": "Cheese shipping and display\n\nTo ensure cheese packages arrive at stores in sellable condition without punctures, tears, or dents, protection during transit must be assured (\n\nMania et al., 2018\n\nMania I.\n\nDelgado A.M.\n\nBarone C.\n\nParisi S.\n\nFood packaging materials in the cheesemaking field.\n\n). Transit may include rough terrain while shipping which results in agitation of cheese in its wholesale packaging. Therefore, some cheese packages have been reinforced with an electrostatic charge that helps prevent shifting during shipping (\n\nTanner, 2015\n\nTanner M.\n\nSpeed of cheese.\n\n). Other approaches to protect the packaging of cheese include using specially constructed cases that are designed for shipping but are easily converted for display. For example, a paperboard or corrugated fiberboard shipping package may have a perforated section designed to be removed once received by the retailer that allows the remaining shipping package to be placed directly on the grocery shelf as a shoppable display box. These partial boxes filled with product can be slid into a refrigerated space and display pre-organized, upright cheese, ready to be selected by purchasers. This display format can be found for some sliced cheese packages in the United States, for example. Shelf-ready displays are more common in the European Union and are becoming more common in the United States due to the enhanced organization and visual appeal. Various shapes and folds make for unique displays at the point of sale and call for purchasers' attention (\n\nTanner, 2015\n\nTanner M.\n\nSpeed of cheese.\n\n).\n\nIn addition to the shape of the packaging, or how it is displayed, technology is being used to acquire and maintain purchasers' attention. Augmented reality is being used in Canada to allow customers to interact with packaging. By scanning a QR code printed on a package, a hologram of a cheese chef appears and a discount coupon for the purchaser is presented (\n\nFood Beverage Close - Up, 2022\n\nFood Beverage Close - Up\n\nNextech AR and Bothwell Cheese Highlights AR Human Hologram Smart Packaging Consumer Experience.\n\n). This kind of interactive digital experience is enabled by the packaging to attract consumer interest. Using printed QR codes on packaging provides digital space for advertisement and product information rather than limited physical space.\n\nTransparent packaging for displaying cheese is trending (\n\nKennedy, 2015a\n\nKennedy S.\n\nSpace-saving cheese pouches, clear containers are packaging trends.\n\n). Consumers can see the product and have a better understanding of what to expect when transparent packaging is used. Typically, product visibility is achieved using a transparent packaging material like plastic or glass; however, the tradeoff remains between cost, function, and perceived sustainability or recyclability of those transparent materials. In Spain, a focus group of cheese consumers concluded they would rather have plastic packaging and be able to see the cheese than to have cheese packaging made of paperboard and, in result, not see the product (\n\nEldesouky and Mesias, 2014\n\nEldesouky A.\n\nMesias F.\n\nAn insight into the influence of packaging and presentation format on consumer purchasing attitudes towards cheese: a qualitative study.\n\n). Similarly, a study done in Egypt in 2016 (\n\nEldesouky et al., 2016\n\nEldesouky A.\n\nElghannam A.\n\nMesías F.J.\n\nEscribano M.\n\nGaspar P.\n\nAre packaging and presentation format key attributes for cheese consumers?.\n\n), also showed that older consumers with children as well as younger, college-educated women without children, strongly preferred plastic over fiberboard packaging for cheese. However, the subsect of male consumers with high income did not have a significant preference for packaging material (\n\nEldesouky et al., 2016\n\nEldesouky A.\n\nElghannam A.\n\nMesías F.J.\n\nEscribano M.\n\nGaspar P.\n\nAre packaging and presentation format key attributes for cheese consumers?.\n\n). These studies, although performed outside of the United States, may help to inform US producers of global consumer trends and expectations and could inform future US packaging directives (\n\nKaczorowski, 2021\n\nKaczorowski M.\n\nA year of innovation in cheese, 2021.\n\n;\n\nKennedy, 2015b\n\nKennedy S.\n\nConvenience, protein messages rule the cheese category.\n\n).\n\nSome individuals and companies are attempting to reduce the use of plastic—especially non-recyclable, single-use plastics. Cheese companies have continued to put forth effort to make their products easily visible while also using less plastic. Kraft Heinz, a global food production company, developed a stand-up pouch for their shredded cheese that simultaneously used less plastic packaging material. Other companies followed Kraft Heinz's precedent, and the new package design became the norm for shredded cheese (\n\nKennedy, 2015a\n\nKennedy S.\n\nSpace-saving cheese pouches, clear containers are packaging trends.\n\n; Packaged\n\nFacts, 2016a\n\nFacts P.\n\nCheese: Natural and Specialty Cheeses in the U.S. and Global Markets.\n\n). This innovation yields the benefit of a stand-up function, while also reducing plastic usage and maintaining product visibility. The adjustment to reduce the plastic usage was likely a result of using a thinner material which, although reduces plastic usage and maintains product visibility, may simultaneously lead the packaging to be more susceptible to puncturing.\n\nBrand\n\nLogos are often prominently displayed on the front of cheese packaging to display the brand. Not only does a logo represent the brand, but so does the layout, image style, and color usage. Branding makes a product recognizable to a consumer and is vital for repurchase. The most purchased big brand of cheese in the United States in both 2014 and 2018, and possibly other years too, was Kraft Heinz followed by Sargento; however, private label cheese is even more often purchased if all private label brands were combined as one (Packaged\n\nFacts, 2014\n\nFacts P.\n\nCheese: Natural and Specialty Cheese in the U.S. and Global Markets.\n\n; Packaged\n\nFacts, 2018\n\nFacts P.\n\nCheese: U.S. Market Trends and Opportunities.\n\n). How much a consumer values the brand, however, varies greatly. Canadian and US cheese consumers showed more importance for price and taste than brand or origin of cheese (\n\nBoatto et al., 2016\n\nBoatto V.\n\nRossetto L.\n\nBordignon P.\n\nArboretti R.\n\nSalmaso L.\n\nCheese perception in the North American market.\n\n). US consumers find quality in perceived taste and value a lower price. In Italy, by contrast, Sampalean and others (\n\nSampalean et al., 2020\n\nSampalean N.I.\n\nDe-Magistris T.\n\nRama D.\n\nInvestigating Italian consumer preferences for different characteristics of Provolone Valpadana using the conjoint analysis approach.\n\n) found that brand was valued over price, organic, lactose-free, and protected designation of origin (PDO) claims, especially for those who were middle-aged with kids (\n\nSampalean et al., 2020\n\nSampalean N.I.\n\nDe-Magistris T.\n\nRama D.\n\nInvestigating Italian consumer preferences for different characteristics of Provolone Valpadana using the conjoint analysis approach.\n\n). Brazilians older than 31 valued information and affordable prices whereas those 30 and younger gave more attention to brand (\n\nLima-Ribeiro et al., 2018\n\nLima-Ribeiro A.P.\n\nDeus-Souza-Carneiro J.D.\n\nMelo-Ramos T.D.\n\nPatterson L.\n\nPinto S.M.\n\nDetermining how packaging and labeling of Requeijão cheese affects the purchase behavior of consumers of different age groups.\n\n). It is apparent that culture likely influences how consumers value cheese, and, in result, should be considered when designing cheese packaging and labeling. Not all brands prominently display their parent brand logo. Although Kraft Heinz is the most purchased big brand of cheese, in the US, Kraft's Philadelphia cream cheese tubs were adjusted to not display the parent brand logo “Kraft” and, instead, only used the sub-brand “Philadelphia” name to display on the packaging (\n\nLuttenberger, 2014\n\nLuttenberger D.\n\nPhiladelphia Cream Cheese revamped packaging ensures proper shelf facing.\n\n). Sub-brands printed on packaging can be made to communicate to consumers a difference of products between the parent brand and sub-brand.\n\nHIGH PROTEIN\n\nAnother approach to appeal to health-conscious consumers is to highlight the protein content naturally present in cheese on the primary display panel. Consumers have been trying to intake more protein in recent years. In 2015, it was reported that 63% of consumers were looking for protein content in their food and beverages before purchasing; therefore, consumers need to find protein information on packaging. Other consumers are even more aggressive with their search for protein. Fifty-seven percent of consumers were trying to get as much protein as possible in their diet in 2015 (\n\nKennedy, 2015b\n\nKennedy S.\n\nConvenience, protein messages rule the cheese category.\n\n). Cheese makers have attempted to satisfy this market desire by innovating. Although cheese naturally contains a good amount of protein of at least 10% of the daily value per reference amount customarily consumed, some cheese has been adapted to contain an enhanced amount of protein (\n\nAnonymous, 2013\n\nAnonymous\n\nRe-Inventing the Cream Cheese Category.\n\n;\n\nKaczorowski, 2019\n\nKaczorowski M.\n\nA year of innovation in cheese, 2019.\n\n). In 2013, a Greek cream cheese was made using fresh dairy and Greek yogurt to form a cream cheese that had double the protein and half the fat content (\n\nAnonymous, 2013\n\nAnonymous\n\nRe-Inventing the Cream Cheese Category.\n\n). Although protein could easily be highlighted on the principal display panel of cheese packaging in 2013, only 0.5% of cheese innovations did so (\n\nWalji, 2013\n\nWalji A.\n\nA year of innovation in Cheese, 2013.\n\n). There is good reason to add nutrition information to the front of a package in addition to the nutrition facts panel. Front of packaging nutrition facts have been found to be more easily understood by consumers than nutrition facts panels (Packaged\n\nFacts, 2014\n\nFacts P.\n\nCheese: Natural and Specialty Cheese in the U.S. and Global Markets.\n\n).\n\nOPPORTUNITIES FOR COTTAGE CHEESE\n\nWith many nutrition- and health-related trends rising, opportunities are plentiful to create cheese products that meet consumer desires (\n\nKennedy, 2015b\n\nKennedy S.\n\nConvenience, protein messages rule the cheese category.\n\n;\n\nLucey, 2020a\n\nLucey J.\n\nCheese snacks get innovative.\n\n; Packaged\n\nFacts, 2018\n\nFacts P.\n\nCheese: U.S. Market Trends and Opportunities.\n\n). Inspiration can be taken from Greek yogurt. Within the dairy case at grocery stores, yogurt grew in popularity and variety of flavors over the last decade (\n\nTong, 2013\n\nTong P.\n\nYou don’t know beans about cottage cheese.\n\n). Protein claims are increasingly more common on Greek yogurt packaging due to the products' high protein content (\n\nTong, 2013\n\nTong P.\n\nYou don’t know beans about cottage cheese.\n\n). Cottage cheese has a similar high-protein, low-lactose nutritional profile that also pairs well with many flavors or add-ins like Greek yogurt does (\n\nLucey, 2020c\n\nLucey J.\n\nDon’t give up on cottage cheese.\n\n). Compared with other cheeses, cottage cheese has an exceptionally high protein content, but that is rarely advertised on its packaging—an opportunity for producers to leverage (\n\nLucey, 2020b\n\nLucey J.\n\nThere’s a cheese for everyone.\n\n; Progressive Digital Media Packaging News, 2014c;\n\nTong, 2013\n\nTong P.\n\nYou don’t know beans about cottage cheese.\n\n;\n\nWireless News, 2018a\n\nWireless News\n\nResearch and Markets Offers Report: Global Packaged Cottage Cheese Market 2018–2022.\n\n). When viewed in a supermarket, none of the 4 major brands of cottage cheese were marketing protein content on the principal display panel. Although there are alternatives to cottage cheese, such as yogurt, tofu, egg whites, and reduced-fat hard cheese, non-dairy options do not contain probiotics and prebiotics like cottage cheese does (\n\nTong, 2013\n\nTong P.\n\nYou don’t know beans about cottage cheese.\n\n;\n\nWireless News, 2018a\n\nWireless News\n\nResearch and Markets Offers Report: Global Packaged Cottage Cheese Market 2018–2022.\n\n). There is opportunity for innovation in cottage cheese products simply through nutrient labeling.\n\nSome companies have already started innovating with cottage cheese. General Mills increased their flavor options of cottage cheese in 2016 while simultaneously advertising protein content (\n\nSzal, 2016\n\nSzal A.\n\nGeneral Mills Among Lead Investors In Cottage Cheese Startup. Food Manuf.\n\n). A different cottage cheese company used transparent tub and screw cap lid packaging, similar to gelato packaging, to display added fruit and other variegates, including savory flavors, in their cottage cheese products (\n\nKennedy, 2015a\n\nKennedy S.\n\nSpace-saving cheese pouches, clear containers are packaging trends.\n\n;\n\nTong, 2013\n\nTong P.\n\nYou don’t know beans about cottage cheese.\n\n). Investments have been made by companies for equipment to improve the texture of cottage cheese in anticipation of demand growing between 2018 and 2022 (\n\nMarketLine, 2018b\n\nMarketLine\n\nGlobal Dairy.\n\n;\n\nWireless News, 2018a\n\nWireless News\n\nResearch and Markets Offers Report: Global Packaged Cottage Cheese Market 2018–2022.\n\n). There are opportunities to communicate the protein content or unique flavor parings of cottage cheese which may lead to increased sales (Tong, 203).\n\nCHILDREN & OBESITY\n\nChildren's nutrition is of concern in the US. Childhood obesity has been a point of concern for over a decade (\n\nFreeman, 2013\n\nFreeman C.\n\nPrivate Label Taking Sharp Approach To Cheese.\n\n). Although the healthiness of cheese is debated, cheese could be marketed for kids and as a better-for-you option especially considering the protein and calcium content and some low-sodium or low-fat cheese options (\n\nFreeman, 2013\n\nFreeman C.\n\nPrivate Label Taking Sharp Approach To Cheese.\n\n;\n\nLucey, 2020b\n\nLucey J.\n\nThere’s a cheese for everyone.\n\n; Packaged\n\nFacts, 2016b\n\nFacts P.\n\nUS Retail Cheese Sales Grow to $17 Billion. Food Manufacturing.\n\n). Opportunities to market cheese to children include adding flavors to their favorite cheese options, such as flavoring mozzarella cheese sticks, or exploring cheese candy–cheese with fun colors and increased sweetness (\n\nLucey, 2020a\n\nLucey J.\n\nCheese snacks get innovative.\n\n). Any of these elements could be displayed on product labeling.\n\nAttempts have been made to make cheese healthier (\n\nAnonymous, 2013\n\nAnonymous\n\nRe-Inventing the Cream Cheese Category.\n\n;\n\nFreeman, 2013\n\nFreeman C.\n\nPrivate Label Taking Sharp Approach To Cheese.\n\n; Packaged\n\nFacts, 2016b\n\nFacts P.\n\nUS Retail Cheese Sales Grow to $17 Billion. Food Manufacturing.\n\n). In aims to reduce obesity in both children and adults, fat and sodium were targeted to be decreased to provide healthier food options. In 2013, marketing, including on-package marketing, and product development efforts toward low-sodium and low-fat cheese were effective for increased sales (\n\nFreeman, 2013\n\nFreeman C.\n\nPrivate Label Taking Sharp Approach To Cheese.\n\n; Packaged\n\nFacts, 2016b\n\nFacts P.\n\nUS Retail Cheese Sales Grow to $17 Billion. Food Manufacturing.\n\n). For others, fighting against obesity means restricting cheese consumption (\n\nWireless News, 2018b\n\nWireless News\n\nResearch and Markets Offers Report: Global Packaged Parmesan Cheese Market 2018–2022.\n\n). For example, globally, the market of parmesan cheese was expected to grow due to the long shelf-life of parmesan cheese and because parmesan is seen as a tasty and convenient flavor enhancer; however, concern from a health-focused market may be the reason that parmesan cheese sales actually decreased (\n\nWireless News, 2018b\n\nWireless News\n\nResearch and Markets Offers Report: Global Packaged Parmesan Cheese Market 2018–2022.\n\n). Whether people think cheese is healthy or not, consumers are seeking out theoretically healthy options (Packaged\n\nFacts, 2016b\n\nFacts P.\n\nUS Retail Cheese Sales Grow to $17 Billion. Food Manufacturing.\n\n,\n\nFacts, 2018\n\nFacts P.\n\nCheese: U.S. Market Trends and Opportunities.\n\n).\n\nLOW-FAT & LOW-SALT\n\nPackaging can quickly communicate health qualities about cheese products. Particular colors are used to indicate a better-for-you option (\n\nEldesouky and Mesias, 2014\n\nEldesouky A.\n\nMesias F.\n\nAn insight into the influence of packaging and presentation format on consumer purchasing attitudes towards cheese: a qualitative study.\n\n). For example, light blue color has been used, in place of dark blue, to indicate to consumers low-fat (Progressive Digital Media Packaging News, 2014c). This kind of color differentiation has been applied to Daisy brand cottage cheese products, among others (\n\nEldesouky and Mesias, 2014\n\nEldesouky A.\n\nMesias F.\n\nAn insight into the influence of packaging and presentation format on consumer purchasing attitudes towards cheese: a qualitative study.\n\n;\n\nProgressive Digital Media Packaging News, 2014b\n\nProgressive Digital Media Packaging News\n\nDairy Crest to upgrade packaging for Cathedral City cheese brand.\n\n). In 2016, consumers in Spain who were overweight showed willingness to pay more for cheese with low-salt and low-fat claims. However, consumers who were not overweight were willing to pay more if the cheese was not marked as low-salt (\n\nde-Magistris and Lopéz-Galán, 2016\n\nde-Magistris T.\n\nLopéz-Galán B.\n\nConsumers’ willingness to pay for nutritional claims fighting the obesity epidemic: the case of reduced-fat and low salt cheese in Spain.\n\n;\n\nMiloradovic et al., 2018\n\nMiloradovic Z.\n\nNedeljkovic A.\n\nTomasevic I.\n\nDjekic I.\n\nMiocinovic J.\n\nSmigic N.\n\nKljajevic N.\n\nThe influence of NaCl concentration of brine and different packaging on goat white brined cheese characteristics.\n\n). Low-salt and low-fat were more valuable claims to make years back, such as in 2013, when those diet aims were more popular (\n\nWalji, 2013\n\nWalji A.\n\nA year of innovation in Cheese, 2013.\n\n). Although consumers prefer cheese to be sufficiently salty, there are still some consumers seeking low-sodium cheese options. Swiss or cream cheeses are naturally low-sodium cheese styles that are an option for those seeking a low-sodium diet (\n\nLucey, 2020b\n\nLucey J.\n\nThere’s a cheese for everyone.\n\n). However, for other consumers, reducing salt content in cheese consequently loses sensory acceptability (\n\nMiloradovic et al., 2018\n\nMiloradovic Z.\n\nNedeljkovic A.\n\nTomasevic I.\n\nDjekic I.\n\nMiocinovic J.\n\nSmigic N.\n\nKljajevic N.\n\nThe influence of NaCl concentration of brine and different packaging on goat white brined cheese characteristics.\n\n).\n\nSimilarly, full-fat cheeses were doing well in 2017 (\n\nKennedy, 2017a\n\nKennedy S.\n\nConsumers say more cheese, please.\n\n). In the years since 2016, the low-fat or no-fat claims were of less interest to consumers and have lost much of their marketing power. This may be due to consumers' updated aim toward, what are considered, healthy fats (\n\nKaczorowski, 2021\n\nKaczorowski M.\n\nA year of innovation in cheese, 2021.\n\n). Adjusting nutrition claims on the package, or the color of the packaging for indicating low-fat or low-sodium, are simple ways to innovate with a product without adjusting product formulation.\n\nALLERGENS & VEGAN AND NON-DAIRY CHEESE\n\nSome consumers have dietary limitations that restrict their consumption of cheese. These consumers are looking for information on packaging to verify if a product is acceptable for their consumption (\n\nEldesouky and Mesias, 2014\n\nEldesouky A.\n\nMesias F.\n\nAn insight into the influence of packaging and presentation format on consumer purchasing attitudes towards cheese: a qualitative study.\n\n;\n\nKaczorowski, 2021\n\nKaczorowski M.\n\nA year of innovation in cheese, 2021.\n\n;\n\nLima-Ribeiro et al., 2018\n\nLima-Ribeiro A.P.\n\nDeus-Souza-Carneiro J.D.\n\nMelo-Ramos T.D.\n\nPatterson L.\n\nPinto S.M.\n\nDetermining how packaging and labeling of Requeijão cheese affects the purchase behavior of consumers of different age groups.\n\n). Allergies or food intolerances to milk or milk-derived products are of particular concern relating to cheese products, but other allergens potentially included in cheese are also of concern. Allergens other than dairy could be included as ingredients in cheese, like nuts, or possibly get cross-contacted with cheese products, like gluten (\n\nEldesouky and Mesias, 2014\n\nEldesouky A.\n\nMesias F.\n\nAn insight into the influence of packaging and presentation format on consumer purchasing attitudes towards cheese: a qualitative study.\n\n). Inclusion of allergens needs to be clearly labeled on cheese packaging to minimize risk during consumption. In fact, allergen mis-labeling is the most common illegal label mistake for food products in general (\n\nKatsouri et al., 2022\n\nKatsouri E.\n\nZampelas A.\n\nDrosinos E.H.\n\nNychas G.-J. E.\n\nLabelling Assessment of Greek “Quality Label” Prepacked Cheeses as the Basis for a Branded Food Composition Database.\n\n). Cheese has been labeled incorrectly for allergens. A voluntary recall was initiated for grated cheese after a product containing egg lysozyme was realized to possibly be in the cheese without being declared on the label (\n\nUS Food and Drug Administration, 2015\n\nUS Food and Drug Administration\n\nArthur Schuman issues Allergy Alert on Undeclared Egg in Grated Parmesan Cheese. 2015.\n\n). Lactose intolerance is also a common condition that limits consumers' consumption of cheese but may not cause the consumer to avoid dairy completely (M2 Presswire, 2017;\n\nLucey, 2020b\n\nLucey J.\n\nThere’s a cheese for everyone.\n\n). Although cheese is made from milk, many fermented cheeses are low in lactose and some are even lactose-free (\n\nLucey, 2020b\n\nLucey J.\n\nThere’s a cheese for everyone.\n\n;\n\nFood Beverage Close - Up, 2022\n\nFood Beverage Close - Up\n\nNextech AR and Bothwell Cheese Highlights AR Human Hologram Smart Packaging Consumer Experience.\n\n). Cheese products for those who cannot consume lactose may include a vegetable-sourced rennet in the cheese production process rather than an animal-sourced rennet because the vegetable-sourced rennet increases the likelihood for the cheese to be lactose-free (\n\nTognacchini, 2019\n\nTognacchini E.\n\nGran Kinara Grated Cheese.\n\n).\n\nSome individuals are avoiding animal products altogether or seek a non-dairy alternative to cheese. Vegan cheese is becoming increasingly more available and is sold at not only specialty stores, but also common supermarkets (\n\nKaczorowski, 2019\n\nKaczorowski M.\n\nA year of innovation in cheese, 2019.\n\n,\n\nKaczorowski, 2021\n\nKaczorowski M.\n\nA year of innovation in cheese, 2021.\n\n). Packaging for vegan cheese-like products is very similar in appearance to typical cheese. The packaging and look of the product help to communicate to consumers the use of the product and what food it is replacing because the actual ingredients are mostly cashews and almonds (\n\nKaczorowski, 2021\n\nKaczorowski M.\n\nA year of innovation in cheese, 2021.\n\n). The market for non-dairy or vegan cheese is significant and growing. In 2015, non-dairy cheese accounted for 11.5% of cheese sales and has since increased (\n\nBlumenfeld, 2015\n\nBlumenfeld J.\n\nThe big cheese.\n\n). The vegan cheese market was expected to grow by 1.1 bn US dollars during 2019–2023 (M2 Presswire, 2017). Millennials (born between 1986 and 1995) are particularly increasing the demand for dairy-alternative cheeses. For example, during 2020, 59% of millennials said they consume dairy alternatives in their household (\n\nKaczorowski, 2020\n\nKaczorowski M.\n\nA year of innovation in cheese, 2020.\n\n). Many of those same consumers have the perspective that vegan cheese is a healthier alternative to dairy cheese (\n\nWalji, 2016\n\nWalji A.\n\nA year of innovation in Cheese, 2016.\n\n). Whether that statement is true is debated. Vegan cheese, or non-dairy cheese, on-average, does not have as much protein as its dairy counterpart. However, non-dairy cheese does tend to have less salt and sugar but more saturated fatty acids, total fats, and total carbohydrates per serving (\n\nBoukid et al., 2021\n\nBoukid F.\n\nLamri M.\n\nBasharat Nabi Dar M.\n\nVegan Alternatives to Processed Cheese and Yogurt Launched in the European Market during 2020: A Nutritional Challenge?.\n\n).\n\nNon-dairy cheese can take advantage of packaging claims like ethically sourced and claim environmental benefits that dairy-based cheese may not be able to make (\n\nKaczorowski, 2019\n\nKaczorowski M.\n\nA year of innovation in cheese, 2019.\n\n;\n\nWalji, 2018\n\nWalji A.\n\nA year of innovation in cheese, 2018.\n\n). Non-dairy cheese is positioning itself with attractive packaging focusing on sustainable and clean-label packaging with products that are free from any additives or chemical preservatives (M2 Presswire, 2017). Selling non-dairy cheese also has benefits such as non-refrigerated storage of raw ingredients and increased profit margins (\n\nMarketLine, 2018b\n\nMarketLine\n\nGlobal Dairy.\n\n). Research is continuing to expand product flavor options and functionality innovation around non-dairy cheese (\n\nBoukid et al., 2021\n\nBoukid F.\n\nLamri M.\n\nBasharat Nabi Dar M.\n\nVegan Alternatives to Processed Cheese and Yogurt Launched in the European Market during 2020: A Nutritional Challenge?.\n\n).\n\nOther countries, such as Australia, Portugal, Germany, France, Canada, and Brazil also report an increase in consumption of plant-based proteins (M2 Presswire, 2017;\n\nManufacturing Close – Up, 2019\n\nManufacturing Close – Up\n\nTechnavio Offers Report on the Vegan Cheese Market. 2019. Manuf. Close - Up.\n\n). Countries in the Asia Pacific region are projected to also see a significant increase in non-dairy cheese consumption (M2 Presswire, 2017). This plant-based diet trend impacts dairy-containing cheese business. Year after year, dairy is projected to decrease in total volumes sold in the US, but it is also expected to increase in dollar sales over time due to increased prices (\n\nMarketLine, 2020a\n\nMarketLine\n\nDairy Global Industry Data.\n\n). Non-dairy cheese is innovating for improvement and uses packaging and labeling to highlight that innovation (\n\nKaczorowski, 2019\n\nKaczorowski M.\n\nA year of innovation in cheese, 2019.\n\n,\n\nKaczorowski, 2021\n\nKaczorowski M.\n\nA year of innovation in cheese, 2021.\n\n). Dairy-containing cheese may eventually fall behind without continuous innovation and communicating effectively with consumers.\n\nOPENING CHEESE PACKAGING\n\nAdaptations to retail cheese packaging are made to aid the consumer in opening the package, accessing the cheese, and storing the cheese. Easy opening is a feature that many consumers have come to appreciate in their packaging and even expect (\n\nEldesouky and Mesias, 2014\n\nEldesouky A.\n\nMesias F.\n\nAn insight into the influence of packaging and presentation format on consumer purchasing attitudes towards cheese: a qualitative study.\n\n;\n\nEldesouky et al., 2016\n\nEldesouky A.\n\nElghannam A.\n\nMesías F.J.\n\nEscribano M.\n\nGaspar P.\n\nAre packaging and presentation format key attributes for cheese consumers?.\n\n). Some consumers need packaging to be easy to open due to limited dexterity or strength. Improvements to aid in the ease of peeling open a package made a significant impact improving package acceptability (\n\nHensler et al., 2015\n\nHensler S.\n\nHerren D.B.\n\nMarks M.\n\nNew technical design of food packaging makes the opening process easier for patients with hand disorders.\n\n). Grip tabs have been added to increase gripability for easy opening and reduce the chance of dirtying fingers (\n\nBuet, 2016\n\nBuet, P. 2016. Packaging element for producing packaging package for food product e.g. cheese, has sheet including guide element for guiding tears in sheet, and gripping tabs overlapping one of longitudinal edges of sheet. Pat. No. FR3035084–A1.\n\n;\n\nJochem, 2014\n\nJochem, C. 2014. Packaging assembly for packaging fresh or processed cheese, has packaging sheet for packaging amount of cheese, and cover placed on cheese and held between peripheral edge of packaging sheet and cheese, where cover carries gripper. Pat. No. FR2986785–A1.\n\n). Innovative cheese packaging designs and patents include methods to grab small portions of cheese without cutting the packaging or the cheese (\n\nRoelink, 2017\n\nRoelink, R. M. A. C. 2017. Method for processing cheese part in cheese boat shape at package, involves cutting cheese part and dividing cheese body into number of cheese pieces and crust, and cutting cheese pieces in equal volumes. Pat. No. NL1041805–B1.\n\n). Tear open options could replace the need for cutting open packages with a tool (\n\nVernier, 2012\n\nVernier, A. 2012. Packaging assembly for packaging fresh or processed cheese such as Gournay cheese, in pasty or semi-liquid manner, has sheet folded to define side wall having circumferential sides, and bellows connecting sides to each other. Pat. No. FR2966447–A1.\n\n). Easy tear open packaging is in demand and advancements have been made to incorporate tear-open features in cheese packaging (\n\nProgressive Digital Media Packaging News, 2013\n\nProgressive Digital Media Packaging News\n\nMilkiland unveils new cheese product with fresh packaging.\n\n;\n\nProgressive Digital Media Packaging News, 2014a\n\nProgressive Digital Media Packaging News\n\nDairy Crest to launch cheese brand in easy tear open packaging. May 30, 2022.\n\n;\n\nBuet, 2016\n\nBuet, P. 2016. Packaging element for producing packaging package for food product e.g. cheese, has sheet including guide element for guiding tears in sheet, and gripping tabs overlapping one of longitudinal edges of sheet. Pat. No. FR3035084–A1.\n\n;\n\nHarby, 2012\n\nHarby, S. 2012. Method for packaging food article i.e. cheese, in flexible film for retail purposes, involves forming tear feature in package, and attaching strip to packaging material such that strip covers tear feature. Pat. No. GB2483254- A.\n\n).\n\nConsumers also strongly valued the ability to reseal a package after opening—particularly if they didn't have children, because there would be more chance of cheese being leftover and needing to be stored (\n\nEldesouky and Mesias, 2014\n\nEldesouky A.\n\nMesias F.\n\nAn insight into the influence of packaging and presentation format on consumer purchasing attitudes towards cheese: a qualitative study.\n\n). New designs have included resealable zipper closures, particularly for shredded cheese (\n\nAnonymous, 2012\n\nAnonymous\n\nCheese now in a stand-up pouch.\n\n). Other resealable packaging utilizes an easy peel back and re-stick cover. Some incorporate this peel back feature with a 2-compartment cheese package that only exposes one half of the cheese at a time, therefore, preserving freshness of the other unopened half (Packaged\n\nFacts, 2016a\n\nFacts P.\n\nCheese: Natural and Specialty Cheeses in the U.S. and Global Markets.\n\n).\n\nCUTTING / PARTITIONING OF CHEESE\n\nCheese is cut into many different shapes, and comes in many different styles, which allows for varied usage of cheese (\n\nKaczorowski, 2019\n\nKaczorowski M.\n\nA year of innovation in cheese, 2019.\n\n,\n\nKaczorowski, 2021\n\nKaczorowski M.\n\nA year of innovation in cheese, 2021.\n\n;\n\nMarketLine, 2018b\n\nMarketLine\n\nGlobal Dairy.\n\n). Packaging must adapt for the different cuts and partitions of cheese. Kraft Heinz provides block and hard cheese, cheese sauce, cottage cheese, cream cheese, melting cheese, ricotta cheese, shredded, grated cheese, crumbled cheese, cheese slices, cheese singles, snacking cheese, and string cheese (\n\nMarketLine, 2018b\n\nMarketLine\n\nGlobal Dairy.\n\n). All of these different cuts of cheese are often found in different packaging and provide different elements to communicate on a package (\n\nKaczorowski, 2019\n\nKaczorowski M.\n\nA year of innovation in cheese, 2019.\n\n,\n\nKaczorowski, 2021\n\nKaczorowski M.\n\nA year of innovation in cheese, 2021.\n\n). For example, number of cheese slices and fineness of cheese shred are only relevant to sliced cheese and shredded cheese, respectively.\n\nShredded cheese was the most purchased cheese cut in 2017—accounting for 36% of total dollar sales (Packaged\n\nFacts, 2018\n\nFacts P.\n\nCheese: U.S. Market Trends and Opportunities.\n\n). Along with shredded, chunk, sliced, and string/stick cheeses made up nearly 90% of US cheese sales in 2017 (Packaged\n\nFacts, 2018\n\nFacts P.\n\nCheese: U.S. Market Trends and Opportunities.\n\n). Unsurprisingly, attention has been given to improving the packaging of shredded cheese since this cut format is so popular. In the Netherlands, advancements in manufacturing equipment improved the range of cheese shredding and grating to meet customers' needs (\n\nAnonymous, 2019\n\nAnonymous\n\nA passion for food.\n\n). Anti-caking agents are commonly used with shredded cheese to avoid clumping during storage in the packaging. A study shows that the use of an anti-caking agent for shredded cheese does not negatively affect the sensory acceptability of cheddar cheese when used up to 3% but does make an impact when used at higher concentrations. Anti-caking was typically identified by panelists visually when observing the cheese and using the cheese at home (\n\nMeals, 2019\n\nMeals S.E.\n\nDrivers of liking of cheddar cheese shreds and consumer perception of anticake agents on cheddar cheese shreds.\n\n). Consumers may not only identify anti-caking visually on cheese, but also in the list of ingredients as it can be included, commonly as cellulose, in the ingredient declaration on the packaging (\n\nKatsouri et al., 2022\n\nKatsouri E.\n\nZampelas A.\n\nDrosinos E.H.\n\nNychas G.-J. E.\n\nLabelling Assessment of Greek “Quality Label” Prepacked Cheeses as the Basis for a Branded Food Composition Database.\n\n;\n\nM2 Presswire, 2017\n\nM2 Presswire\n\nWorldwide Non Dairy Cheese Industry Professional Survey and In-depth Analysis Research Report Forecast to 2023.\n\n). Although anti-caking is added onto shredded cheese for increased functionality, consumers may notice it physically on the product, or perhaps notice it as a listed ingredient printed on the packaging (\n\nMeals, 2019\n\nMeals S.E.\n\nDrivers of liking of cheddar cheese shreds and consumer perception of anticake agents on cheddar cheese shreds.\n\n)."
