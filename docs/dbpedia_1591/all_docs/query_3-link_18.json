        "text": "The increased demand for foods that provide nutritional and health benefits increased research in probiotic microorganisms applied to dairy products. Probiotics are affected by several factors that decrease their action on the gastrointestinal system, making it vital to protect them using encapsulation techniques that allow their incorporation into various food products. The study herein aimed to evaluate the best way to incorporate Lactobacillus acidophilus (free and encapsulated) to Requeijão cremoso processed cheese varieties. The microorganism was applied to different curd formulations using green banana biomass as a partial fat substitute. The pH, probiotic viability during shelf life and throughout the simulated gastrointestinal conditions, and capsules produced were assessed. While applying free Lactobacillus acidophilus to Requeijão cremoso varieties proved functionally ineffective, the encapsulated formulations presented satisfactory probiotic counts in all treatments (8–10...\n\nThis work investigated the effect of LAB starter cultures on the titratable acidity with respective incubation time and its viability during refrigeration storage in a fermented gruel from wheat flour and green gram malt mixture. The microorganisms used were Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus plantarum. There were significant increases in TA of non dairy probiotic drink with respective time of incubation. It was observing that the decrease in viscosity of drink as storage time and viable count of LAB were increased at refrigeration temperature. It observed that in first four days of storage, there was constant increase in viable count of bacteria tested on MRS media while the percentage of growth is slightly decrease showed by six day of storage. The results of this work showed that LAB were good candidates for grow on the non dairy substrate content wheat flour and green gram malt based gruel with inhibiting the survival of other undesirable bacteria."
