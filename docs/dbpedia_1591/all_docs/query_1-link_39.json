        "text": "Bem Casados are traditional Brazilian treats – consisting of dulce de leche sandwiched between two small discs of sponge cake – that are served at weddings, bridal and baby showers, and other special occasions. It is impossible to resist them!\n\nIf you’ve been to a Brazilian wedding, chances are you found a tower of beautifully wrapped bem casados on your way out and smuggled at least a few to take home. No judgement here! I am guilty of trying to smuggle as many as I can, as I adore these sweet treats!\n\nIn Brazil, people pay doceiras (women who make sweet confections and desserts) or bakeries a lot of money for these. But they are very easy to make! No need to wait for the next big party to enjoy them when you can have them at home, anytime you want.\n\nWe are calling them wedding cookies here for the lack of a better term for these pastries. Even though they are shaped like sandwich cookies, they are softer and made of sponge cake. Think of them like softer alfajores!\n\nI’m sharing them as part of my Valentine’s Day content because not only they are a symbol of love in my culture, but also because they make great edible gifts for your loved ones! Make a batch and give to your significant other, friends, neighbors, kid’s teachers, you name it. These will surely put a smile on their faces!\n\nThe meaning behind Bem Casados\n\nThe term Bem Casado means “Happily Married” in Portuguese.\n\nThe legend says that these wedding cookies represent the couple’s union and commitment, and promise a life of happiness. According to the tradition, you have to offer each guest a bem casado so they can each be blessed with that same luck and happiness. Some say that guests can make a wish before taking the first bite!\n\nEven though these started as wedding favors, today they are given as favors in all sorts of special occasions, like when a baby is born (Brazilians like to give favors for their friends when they visit the newborn baby at the hospital) or at anniversary parties. You will also find them served in dessert form, like in cakes, brownies, trifles and even ice cream.\n\nWhy use potato starch?\n\nWhile you can make these Brazilian Wedding Cookies with all purpose flour, I highly recommend using potato starch instead.\n\nI find that the potato starch lightens the texture of the bem casados and gives them a soft and airy texture, which is a great contrast to the slight crunch of the dried sugar glaze. It also makes them gluten free, making these very convenient if you are serving a large number of people with unknown diet restrictions.\n\nJust be careful not to buy potato flour, as that won’t work. Both come from potatoes but are not interchangeable and are used for different reasons!\n\nBrazilian Wedding Cookies – Filling Variations\n\nWhen Bem Casados came from Portugal to Brazil, they were traditionally filled with baba de moça, a delicious egg coconut custard cream, very popular in many Brazilian and Portuguese desserts. However, the dulce de leche version quickly became the star and is what you’ll often see in weddings today.\n\nGuava paste, lemon curd, walnut or pistachio cream, brigadeiro and chocolate ganache, although not traditional, can also be used as fillings.\n\nHow to Make Brazilian Wedding Cookies\n\nTo make these “cookies”, we start with a thin Genoise (or Sponge) cake, baked in a baking sheet until puffed and light golden brown. This soft cake is cut into small discs that are topped with dulce de leche and joined, two by two, to form thick sandwich cookies, similar to alfajores.\n\nThe cookies are then dipped into a warm sugar glaze and set to dry in a cooling rack. Once dry, the sugar glaze becomes a delicious crunchy thin layer of sugar that makes these so special! Don’t be afraid to let them bathe in the sugar glaze for a few seconds per side, as you want them to get super moist inside.\n\nIf giving these as party favors or gifts, you can individually wrap them in crepe or tissue paper and tie with a bow. I’m not very crafty, but I attempted a few just for the sack of illustration! :)\n\nHow long will Bem Casados stay fresh?\n\nBem Casados will stay good for up to 7 days at room temperature. You can also keep them in the fridge for up to 10 days, but they taste better if you let them come to room temperature before eating.\n\nCan I freeze them?\n\nYes, these freeze well and will last for up to 3 months. Just thaw in the fridge overnight and let them come to room temperature before eating.\n\nEven if you are familiar with bem casados, chances are you haven’t tried making them at home! I highly encourage you to head over to your kitchen to whip up a batch. It is the only way to understand why we Brazilians are so obsessed with them.\n\nOther Brazilian recipes:"
