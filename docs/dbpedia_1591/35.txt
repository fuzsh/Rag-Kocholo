Abstract

Abstract

Lactobionic acid (LBA) shows singular properties (antioxidant and antimicrobial). However, few studies aim to test them in foods and confirm the actual occurrence of properties. The present study aims to apply LBA/lactic acid in the production of requeijão cremoso model in order to recognize some of the effects caused by the component as a food additive. The effects on the requeijão cremoso model were evaluated by the final properties of the product: water activity, rheological properties, antioxidant and antimicrobial capacity. Model of requeijão completely acidified with LBA showed the maximum antioxidant activity (88%). The results revealed a potential of application of LBA for microbial inhibition. All model produced presented pseudo plastic behaviour.

Introduction

Food processors have been seeking for innovative technologies, for both products and processes, aiming at increasing business profitability while maintaining the quality and competitiveness of elaborate products. Lactobionic acid is a sugar acid widely used in cosmetics due to its antioxidant properties, but still emerging when it comes to food applications (Cardoso et al. 2019). Most of the food-related studies found in the literature focus on methods of producing LBA and process optimization (Stodola and Lockwood 1947; Kokoh and Alonso-Vante 2006; Alonso et al. 2015). The LBA is rarely found in nature, and is most known for its antioxidant, antimicrobial, stabilizer, acidulant, and moisturizing properties nowadays (Alonso et al. 2013; Illanes et al. 2016). Currently its use is not regulated in most parts of the world, however, the Food and Drug Administration allows its use when in salt form (Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 2018).

To better understand the role of LBA in food, this study aimed at applying the acid in a food whose expected primary effect was precisely the acidulant capacity, so that other factors of interest could be further evaluated. Thus, requeijão cremoso was chosen as a food matrix, since it is a food that can be produced as a model (due to the natural variations of the raw material, milk), and it is dependent on acid coagulation in the production process. This cheese variety is among the few that can be produced exclusively through direct acidification (MINISTÉRIO DA AGRICULTURA E PECUÁRIA E ABASTECIMENTO 1997). The choice of the type of cheese model was mainly due to the processing characteristics, aiming at reducing interference in the desired responses.

The purpose of applying LBA in this study is to bring the properties mentioned in the literature to foods, verify its action as an acidifying agent in the production of requeijão cremoso models and be within the norms of the legislation (MINISTÉRIO DA AGRICULTURA E PECUÁRIA E ABASTECIMENTO 1997). Proof of the viability of using LBA in this area is the starting point for the interest of other researchers to be instigated and for the compound to be regulated in most parts of the world in the near future. The study's innovation is related to the production of a typical Brazilian cream cheese (requeijão cremoso) produced by an acidifying agent (LBA) little studied in the food field, in combination with a traditional acidifying agent. This combination was made possible through an experimental design. There are no published studies showing the feasibility of combined use of the mentioned acidifying agents.

Materials and methods

Material

Requeijão cremoso model was prepared using neutral flavoured casein powder (Mais Nutrition®), whey protein concentrate neutral flavoured (Mais Nutrition), fresh milk cream (Verde Campo, Brazil), fusion salts (Avante Ingredientes, Brazil), sodium chloride (Vetec), and as acidifier lactic acid 85% (Alphatec) and/or lactobionic acid 97% (Syngars Technology Co., Zhejiang, China) and distilled water. For the analysis of requeijão cremoso model the following reagents were used: ABTS (Sigma-Aldrich), Muller-Hinton agar (Kasvi), potassium persulphate (NEON), chloramphenicol (Colgate), ethanol (BIOTEC), trolox (Acros Organics), Requeijão cremoso Nestle, and ferrous ammonium sulphate hex hydrate (NEON).

Methods

Preliminary test

An advanced literature search was used to establish fixed parameters for the constitution of the models (ingredients), as well as the methodology for their processing. Sequentially, by means of a preliminary test, the parameters of time (20, 30 and 40 min) and temperature (32 and 37 °C) of coagulation in an oven were determined, as well as the acid concentration (1, 2 and 3%) used acidification of the product. The sample chosen was the closest physically to a commercial sample of requeijão cremoso (Nestle®).

Experimental design for requeijão cremoso model

All formulations tested have the same proportions of their components (Table ). The established difference between the formulations is observed only in the direct acidification compounds or in the proportionality of mixtures between them.

The design of mixtures for direct acidifying agents was carried out from an enhanced Simplex centroid design for two-component mixtures, with two central points, resulting in 5 experiments as shown in Table .

Initially, the proteins were reconstituted in deionized water by stirring at 100 rpm/5 min, followed by cold storage for hydration (2.2 °C for 24 h). When necessary, the acids were diluted to reach both until reaching 85% concentration taking into account their initial concentration. The proteins were heated for 15 min in a water bath (50 °C), and sequentially at room temperature (18 °C) the acidifying agent was incorporated (100 rpm/1 min) to the mixture (Saint-Eve et al. 2009; Panouillé et al. 2011; Ribeiro et al. 2016; Syarifuddin et al. 2016). The filling was carried out in closed pots for oven coagulation (20 min at 32 °C). The curd mass was broken by stirring (15 s) at a temperature of 80 °C). The other ingredients (salt, emulsifier and fat) were added after coagulation with subsequent homogenization (100 rpm/3 min). The requeijão cremoso model was stored at 2.2 °C (Fig. ). The analyses in the requeijão cremoso model cheeses were performed during the storage period (days 1, 8, 15 and 22) at 18 ± 1 °C and an average relative humidity of 82%.

Determination of moisture and pH

Moisture was determined gravimetrically in a drying oven (Fanemm, Brazil) at 100 °C for 24 h using 5 g of the cheeses. For the determination of pH a digital pH meter was used (Quimis, Brazil), whose sensor was inserted directly into the samples.

Water activity

The water activity of the model cheese samples (approximately 1.5 g) was verified by the dew point method in an Aqua lab 3TE device (Decagon, Pullman, USA).

Colourimetric analysis

Instrumental colour measurement was performed using a reflectance colourimeter model MiniScan XE Plus (Hunter Associates Laboratory, Inc., Reston, USA) set to the CIELab colour system (CIE76, International Commission on Illumination). For standardization, measurements were performed in the central region of the model cheeses, supporting the opening of the device near the surface of the samples with the previously calibrated equipment (at room temperature).

Rheology

The shear rate and stress for the rheological study were measured at temperatures ranging from 10 to 30 °C under atmospheric pressure (around 91 kPa) using a Brookfield DV-III Rheometer (Benbrook, TX, USA) equipped with spindles SC425 and SCA-18. The uncertainty of the viscosity measurement was ± 2.14 cP·s.

Antioxidant activity (ABTS and FRAP)

From each requeijão cremoso model sample 3 g was taken and added to 30 mL of ethanol 80%. After 5 min stirring, the mixtures were stored (18 °C for 72 h), centrifuged (3600 rpm/3 h) and filtered on filter paper. A method adapted from Re et al. (1999) was used to assess the antioxidant activity. ABTS: An aqueous solution of ABTS (7 mM) was prepared and stored in a hermetically sealed amber glass. Sequentially, the ABTS radical was prepared by incorporating of potassium persulfate solution (2.45 mM) in an ABTS stock solution at 50 °C bath for 15 min. This solution was corrected with ethanol 80% to reach an absorbance of 0.7 a.u. (734 nm).

Readings at 734 nm were performed after adding the ABTS radical solution to the samples, in triplicate, followed by homogenization and incubation for 30 min. From a trolox standard solution (2000 µM) seven dilutions were obtained to generate the standard curve of absorbance versus concentration (Eq. 1).

y=-ax+b

where y = absorbance corresponding to 1000 µM trolox; x = sample dilution (mg/mL) equivalent to 1000 µM trolox.

FRAP: The antioxidant activity by iron reduction (FRAP) was determined using the methodology described by Rufino et al. (2007). The FRAP reagent was obtained by adding 0.3 M acetate buffer, 10 mM TPTZ solution and 20 mM aqueous ferric chloride solution. The test was carried out by adding different concentrations of the sample, distilled water and FRAP reagent. The mixture was incubated in a water bath at 37 °C for 30 min, with a later absorbance reading (595 nm). The linear adjustment was obtained by means of a calibration curve with different concentrations of a standard ferrous sulfate solution.

Iron chelating capacity

The solutions used to determine the chelating capacity of the iron ion were prepared according to the methodology described by Harb et al. (2016). The chelating activity of Fe2+ was determined by measuring the formation of a Fe2+ complex with ferrozine according to a methodology adapted from Tang et al. (2002). The samples were previously diluted in water with a concentration varying from 15 to 400 mg/mL and then 1 mL of the sample was added with 0.1 mL of ferrous ammonium sulfate (2 mmol). After incubation for 30 min at room temperature and an amber flask, ferrozine (0.2 mL, 5 mmol) was added with an additional 10 min incubation and then the sample was completed with water, totaling 5 mL. The spectrophotometer reading was performed at a wavelength of 562 nm. The chelating activity was calculated using Eq. (2):

Antimicrobial screening method

From each sample analysed, 3 g was taken and added to 30 mL of ethanol 80%. After stirring for 5 min, the mixtures were stored for 72 h, centrifuged (3600 rpm/3 h) and filtered on filter paper. The method was performed by disk diffusion according to methodology adapted from Bauer et al. (1966). The standard strains used for the analyses were: Bacillus cereus (ATCC 11778), Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 7644), Salmonella enteritidis (ATCC 13076) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923). Initially the bacteria were reactivated in Muller Hinton broth at 37 °C for 24 h. Subsequently, in saline solution (0.9%) the inoculum was transferred until reaching the required concentration of 0.5 McFarland standard solution. Swabs were made on Mueller Hinton Agar plates with each microbial suspension (0.1 mL). On the surface of the inoculated agar 2 mm diameter discs soaked with the respective sample dilutions (20 µL) were placed. Chloramphenicol (30 µg/mL) were used as positive control and ethanol 80% were used as negative control. The plates were incubated inverted at 37 °C for 24 h. The size of the inhibitory halo formed by the sample contained in each disc was measured with a caliper (Bauer et al. 1966).

Data analysis

Moisture, pH, colour, antioxidant activity, water activity and antimicrobial activity will be analysed in triplicate and expressed as means followed by their respective standard deviations. The Kolmorogov–Smirnov test was applied to verify the normality of the results obtained the Levene test to verify the homogeneity of variances and ANOVA to verify the statistical difference (95% significance) between the averages of the data generated. Statistically different means were subjected to Tukey's post-hoc test (p < 0.05). The correlation between antioxidant and chelating capacity was determined by Pearson's correlation coefficient (p < 0.05). All data analysis were made through Action Stat supplement software (2015).

Results

Preliminary test

The sample most similar in comparison to the commercial sample of requeijão cremoso analyzed and closest to that required by law consists of 2% acidifying agent, coagulated during 20 min in a dry oven regulated at 32 °C. This information becomes the basis for the production of requeijão cremoso models according to the experimental design.

Moisture and pH

In the present study it is possible to observe (Table ) moisture values between 60.17 and 62.69, which do not present statistical difference between each other over the days of analysis, for most samples (except sample C) and statistical variation between samples only on day 15. This slight difference in moisture content should not interfere with any other parameters, from the practical point of view.

All samples are within the standards established by the legislation for the moisture parameter (< 65%) (MINISTÉRIO DA AGRICULTURA E PECUÁRIA E ABASTECIMENTO 1997). The samples did not show moisture loss during the storage days. For consumers, water loss can be considered a manufacturing defect.

Studies indicate that higher moisture contents also increase the primary proteolysis of the structure, influencing cheese meltability and flowability (Joshi et al. 2004; Hickey et al. 2015).

The pH as well as the moisture, exerts great influence on the organization of the proteins of real and requeijão cremoso model, interfering, consequently, in their texture and durability (Tunick and Nolan 1992). Acidification with 85% of both acids have a pH variation between 4.01 (sample A on day 1) and 5.84 (sample B on day 22). Table shows that samples acidified with lactic acid had lower pH values (Samples A and D). This fact is related to the acid ionization capacity (pKa). Lactic acid has a higher pKa value when compared to LBA, indicating greater ease of ionization and reduction of pH values (Gutiérrez et al. 2012; Dusselier et al. 2013). Over the course of storage there was a tendency for samples to increase their pH value, except for sample C. The highest pH values were recorded for the requeijão cremoso model acidified with 100% LBA (sample B) throughout the storage period. From the results obtained, it is possible to observe that the LBA acted as an acidifying agent in the production of the samples.

Resolution number 359 of the Ministério da Agricultura e Pecuária e Abstecimento, (1997) does not establish a pH standard. It is important to emphasize the need for high hygiene standards and storage under refrigeration (< 7 °C) since this pH is within the optimal growth range for spore-forming bacteria (above pH 4.5).

Aw and colour

The Aw presented variations between 0.97 and 0.98. These values are close to that reported by Hirpara et al. (2016) for requeijão (Aw = 0.972). Similarly, Sołowiej et al., (2014) produced a processed cheese analogue from acid casein, which presented an Aw in the range of 0.985 and 0.998. Lower Aw values decrease microbial growth rate in general. Due to the high water content and Aw, and the low quantities of salt usually employed, the impact on lowering the activity of water is almost non significate. Except for sample B, the samples showed a very slight increase in their Aw from day 1 to 8, remaining constant over the following storage period.

The Aw is an important factor when it comes to microbial development and product conservation. As spreadable cheeses have high Aw, most of the water is freely distributed in their matrixes, creating a suitable environment to microbial development. Thus, sanitary hygienic control during processing is essential to prevent the development of spoilage bacteria (Marriott et al. 2018).

Colour is a parameter dependent on processing factors such as raw materials used, time, temperature, pH, moisture and degree of fat dispersion (Zehren and Nusbaum 1992). All samples presented a yellowish colour, as indicated by the positive results of parameter b*, ranging from 8.30 to 14.13. From these, the values of samples B and E are consistent with those found for requeijão cremoso processed and added green banana biomass (11.77–13.31) in a study performed by Pivetta et al. (2019). This result is justified by the presence of LBA, which intensifies the colouration. Acid casein processed cheese analogues, produced by Sołowiej et al. (2014) showed b* results in the range of 5.69 and 9.28, indicating pale yellow hue. This data is consistent with the present study for samples containing higher lactic acid contents (samples A and D).

The lowest values of a* (Table ) were predominant for samples acidified with the highest amount of lactic acid (sample A and D). These results of a* indicate a slight tendency of green colouration. There was a predominance of yellow over green (higher values of b* in relation to a*). The luminosity (L) was reduced in all treatments comparing the first and last days of storage, where a higher initial value was evidenced for the sample B, acidified exclusively with LBA. At the end of the storage period the samples showed no significant difference in relation to the treatment applied.

The luminosity (L) of all samples decreased during the storage period. Higher LBA values in the formulation also represent higher values for the parameters b* e a*. Given the results presented, LBA present equal or slight practical differences to some of the organic acids usually applied in cream cheeses – as lactic acid and citric acid—with respect to moisture, pH, Aw and colour.

Rheology of requeijão cremoso model

The viscosity (η) of the requeijão cremoso model evaluated in this work are presented in Table . As expected, increases in temperature reduced the viscosity of the model (for specific cases, no significant changes were observed). Lower viscosity values were also verified as the storage time increased (at fixed temperatures of analysis) cream. The samples whose viscosity is closer to requeijão cremoso are formulations B and E. The rheological behavior of the samples was characterized by the medium values of the shear stress versus the shear rate and three models was utilized: Ostwald–de-Waele (Eq. 3), Herschel–Bulkley (Eq. 4), and Bingham plastic (Eq. 5).

The rheological behaviour of the samples was characterized by the shear stress versus the shear rate, and three models was utilized: Ostwald–de-Waele (Eq. 3), Herschel–Bulkley (Eq. 4) and Bingham plastic (Eq. 5).

where τ is the shear stress, γ is the shear rate, K is the consistency index, τ0 is the yield strength, n is the flow behaviour index, and ηB is the Bingham plastic viscosity.

The Ostwald–de-Waele and Herschel–Bulkley models presented n < 1, which means that the requeijão cremoso model is not a Newtonian fluid but a pseudoplastic. The values can be observed in Table ; these values not presented replicate because the values of n were calculated by the medium values of the shear rate and shear stress. This is in agreement with the literature for soft or cream cheeses (Dimitreli and Thomareis 2004). For specifically requeijão cremoso exist works that obtained the same result, for example Ferrão et al. (2018) verified that all yours samples showed flow behavior index (n) less than 1, indicating a pseudoplastic.

Antioxidant activity (ABTS and FRAP)

Figure shows a significant variation between the different treatments on the same day of analysis, where requeijão cremoso B and E showed the highest mean values (statistically significant) up to 15 days of cold storage. The use of LBA as an acidifier that provide enhanced antioxidant activity may be justified for extremely fresh cheeses. However, it is likely that higher amounts of LBA—for cheeses of lower pH—may result in higher antioxidant activity.

The antioxidant capacity for all samples increased during the storage days, with a peak of activity occurring on day 15. In a study by Přikryl et al. (2018) two methods were used to measure antioxidant capacity, being the ABTS radical inhibition method the only one that presented high results in relation to the control sample, a fact that occurred in the present study and so it was the method chosen to be applied. Antioxidant capacity is verified in the requeijão cremoso model by LBA action.

Table shows a significant variation between the different treatments for the antioxidant capacity parameter, on the same day of analysis. The antioxidant capacity of all samples increased during storage days, with peak activity occurring on day 15 (ABTS). This fact can probably be explained due to the release of compounds during the ripening process of the cheeses which are responsible for the increased antioxidant capacity, such as, for example, bioactive peptides, vitamins and oligosaccharides (del Olmo et al. 2018; Santiago-López et al. 2018). The increase in antioxidant capacity during the days of storage was observed for all samples, both for the method via ABTS and the method of FRAP. The increase in antioxidant capacity with ripening is in line with reports in the literature that suggest the effect caused by protein proteolysis (Rashidinejad et al. 2013; Perna et al. 2015; Revilla et al. 2016). It is likely that larger amounts of LBA—for lower pH cheeses—may result in increased antioxidant activity.

Iron chelating capacity

During the storage period, all samples showed a reduction in iron chelating capacity (except statistically for the E-sample with maintenance) as can be seen in Table . The presence of a chelating agent can alter the balance between protein and mineral resulting in an increased repulsion between the negatively charged amino acids in the casein micelles (Dewan et al. 1972). According to the literature, the use of different methods is essential for a correct assessment of the antioxidant activity data, since the correlation between the methods is not always high (Dudonné et al. 2009). The results obtained for iron chelation, when correlated with the percentage of antioxidant inhibition, obtained high Pearson’s correlation; (Chelating Iron: ABTS obtained 0.972 and Chelating Iron: FRAP obtained 0.954) which corroborates the hypothesis that the antioxidant activity is highly related to the metal chelating capacity.

Antimicrobial activity

High moisture cheeses are highly susceptible not only to microbial spoilage, but can also serve as substrate to pathogens such as S. aureus (Pereira et al. 2018). Given this fact, it is necessary to control microbial development in favor of food safety and increase the shelf life of food. Statistical analysis was performed between samples and between days of analysis, separately for each microorganism. However, the control samples (positive and negative) were analyzed together, for all microorganisms.

Microbial species such as B. cereus have greater sensitivity to antimicrobial compounds (Schalk 2018; Correa et al. 2019). This fact was observed through the action of the mentioned controls, where B. cereus was the second most sensitive microorganism. Most antimicrobial compounds show greater action against gram positive bacteria when compared to gram negative bacteria (Correa et al. 2019). This can be explained by the fact that gram positive bacteria do not have an external membrane, naturally presenting less resistance to preservative mechanisms, and being accessible mainly to small molecules (Brul 1999), such as organic acids. All samples independent of the microorganism showed loss of antimicrobial activity at the end of the 22 days of storage, with the exception of S. aureus, where formulations A, D and E maintained their inhibition halo formation until day 22. Samples A, C and D showed a decrease in their activity against B. cereus during the storage period. Among the microorganisms analysed, L. monocytogenes presented the highest sensitivity in the presence of requeijão cremoso model extracts, with inhibition zones between 10 and 21.6 mm (Table ). Samples C, D and E showed a significant decrease in inhibition with storage, unlike samples A and B that maintained their action on Listeria unchanged. For Salmonella the samples were less effective with time, except for sample B whose effect remained unchanged until the end of the storage period. Regarding S. aureus, samples B and C completely lost the inhibitory potential from the first to the eighth day of analysis. Of all treatments, sample E showed the highest control of S. aureus growth during the storage period.

The negative control (ethanol 80%) showed no inhibitory action against the tested microorganisms, thus, the halos formed for the samples are not related to the solvent compound (ethanol 80%) (Vargas et al. 2004; Zardo et al. 2019). The positive control formed inhibition halos between 46 (salmonella) and 50.5 mm (listeria). Most samples showed considerable activity until the 15th day of storage, with the largest halos of inhibition recorded for: Listeria > S. aureus > Salmonela > Bacillus.

Conclusion

During the period of analysis the samples tested greatly reduced their antimicrobial potential and viscosity. This loss is natural and expected. However, it was possible to observe a potential use of LBA as an additive for food production (acting as acidulant). This acid showed comparable or superior attributes in the requeijão cremoso model, when compared to lactic acid. The model produced was in accordance with the requirements of the legislation for requeijão cremoso.

On the first day of storage the antioxidant activity for the LBA acidified sample was five times higher when compared to the lactic acid acidified sample. In the same comparison, the LBA acidified sample showed a 50% higher inhibition of Listeria growth when compared to the lactic acid acidified sample on the first day of analysis. It was possible to prove antioxidant and antimicrobial action for models produced with LBA. Further studies on the application of LBA in dairy or food products should be conducted to better understand the contribution of this compound in the organic matrixes.
