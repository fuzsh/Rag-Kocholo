Abstract

In this initial study, the impact of thermosonication as an alternative to the traditional fusion in Brazilian cheese spread (Requeijão Cremoso) manufacture was investigated. The effect of ultrasound (US) power was evaluated considering various aspects such as gross composition, microstructure, texture, rheology, color, fatty acid composition, and volatile compounds. A 13 mm US probe operating at 20 kHz was used. The experiment involved different US power levels (200, 400, and 600 W) at 85 °C for 1 min, and results were compared to the conventional process in the same conditions (85 °C for 1 min, control treatment). The texture became softer as ultrasound power increased from 200 to 600 W, which was attributed to structural changes within the protein and lipid matrix. The color of the cheese spread also underwent noticeable changes for all US treatments, and treatment at 600 W resulted in increased lightness but reduced color intensity. Moreover, the fatty acid composition of the cheese spread showed variations with different US power, with samples treated at 600 W showing lower concentrations of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, as well as lower atherogenicity and thrombogenicity indexes, indicating a potentially healthier product. Volatile compounds were also influenced by US, with less compounds being identified at higher powers, especially at 600 W. This could indicate possible degradation, which should be evaluated in further studies regarding US treatment effects on consumer perception. Hence, this initial work demonstrated that thermosonication might be interesting in the manufacture of Brazilian cheese spread, since it can be used to manipulate the texture, color and aroma of the product in order to improve its quality parameters.

1. Introduction

Dairy products and their derivatives are fundamental to nutrient intake, as they are rich in proteins, minerals, and vitamins [1]. Among dairy products, processed cheeses stand out due to their accessibility and convenience, which resulted in a steady increase in consumption since the 1990s.

Processed cheeses are products made from a mixture of one or more cheeses (aged or fresh), fat, water, and melting salts or not, followed by applying heat or not and agitation. The heating process aims to promote melting and, together with melting salts, achieve a homogeneous and stable emulsion, which is used in the manufacture of Brazilian cheese spread (Requeijão Cremoso) [2].

Curd fusion is an essential step of Brazilian cheese spread (Requeijão cremoso) production, which involves heating the curd at 85 to 95 °C for up to 5 min [2], [3], [4]. However, while the high temperatures achieved in the process are essential for product quality, prolonged exposure to heat can lead to nutritional losses and a higher energy consumption. Therefore, alternative processing methods can be interesting for cheese spread processing in order to minimize some drawbacks [2], [3], [4].

A promising alternative is the use of high intensity ultrasound (US), with intensities higher than 1 W cm−2 and frequencies lower than 100 kHz [5], which has been applied for several food processes, including extraction, crystallization, emulsification, drying, freezing, enzyme inactivation, and others [6], [7], [8]. This technique has demonstrated efficacy in the inactivation of undesirable enzymes and microorganisms [7], reducing the size of casein micelles [8], for example, and increasing the bioavailability of bioactive compounds [9]. In dairy products, sonication treatments have already shown promising results to improve process and technological characteristics, such as in raw milk [10], [11], cheeses [12], and dairy beverages [13], [14].

An innovative approach to preserving the nutritional quality of dairy products while enhancing their sensory characteristics is thermosonication. This method combines moderate heat (>50 °C) with low frequency (around 20 kHz) high intensity US, providing the specific effects of each technology, such as microbial inactivation by heat and high sheer forces and homogenization by high intensity US [9].

In this context, the cheese spread mixture needs to achieve high temperatures (above 85 °C) to guarantee the desired texture and stability. However, as long exposure to high temperature can affect the nutritional compounds, the production of Brazilian cheese spread by thermosonication can be a promising alternative for this type of product. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of thermosonication on cheese spread processing as an alternative to conventional curd fusion. In this sense, the effect of ultrasonic power on various properties, such as composition, microstructure, texture, color, fatty acid composition, and volatile compounds.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Production of Brazilian cheese spread

The cheese curd was prepared by direct acid coagulation. For the coagulation, 2 L of pasteurized milk were heated to 80 °C, followed by addition of 0.4% of 85% lactic acid to the milk, which was stirred until coagulation, and kept still for 10 min. The released whey was discarded, and the curd was washed three times with potable water to remove the excess lactic acid and control the pH (5.4 to 5.8). The curd was weighed, and the remaining ingredients were added according to . Subsequently, four samples were separated into 250 mL beakers. For the traditional processing of the cheese spread (sample identified as CONV), the curd fusion was carried out using a heating plate with agitation (from 25 to 85 °C, 10 ± 1 min) and vigorous agitation for 1 min (using a fouet) after the curd reached 85 °C. The thermosonication process combined the heating plate with an ultrasonic probe device (QR750, Ultronique Disruptor/Sonicator, São Paulo, Brazil) with a 13 mm diameter tip, immersed 10 mm in the sample and operating at 20 kHz. The thermosonication treatments (TS200, TS400, and TS600) varied the applied ultrasonic nominal power (200 W, 400 W, and 600 W, respectively) and they were employed after the conventional heating (from 25 to 85 °C, 10 ± 1 min), but replacing the vigorous agitation with thermosonication for 1 min after the samples reached 85 °C. All the samples were packed in polypropylene plastic containers at the same temperature (85 °C) and immediately refrigerated at 5 ± 2 °C until the analyses.

where Cp is the specific heat capacity (J/g °C−1) measured at constant pressure; m is the sample mass (g), dT/dt is the heating rate concerning process time (°C/s); D is the probe tip diameter (cm); V is the sample volume (mL or cm3), t is the processing time (s) and UP is the nominal US power (W). The specific heat capacity (Cp) was considered as 2.1 J g−1 °C−1, which is the average heat capacity of a processed cheese [11].

According to the calculations, the ultrasonic parameters for treatments TS200, TS400, and TS600 were AP = 5.60, 14.8, and 15.6 W; AI = 12.1, 31.9, and 35.7 W cm−2; PD = 0.028, 0.074, and 0.083 W cm−3; SE = 3.36, 8.89, and 9.94 J g−1; and ED = 0.120, 0.240, and 0.360 kJ cm−3, respectively.

2.2. Gross composition

The physicochemical analyses were carried out on the third day of refrigerated storage. They included pH measurement (dimensionless) and gross composition in g 100 g−1 (content of moisture, protein, lipids, fat in the dry extract, and defatted dry extract). All analyses were carried out following the official Brazilian methodology, established by the Adolfo Lutz Institute [12].

2.3. Meltability test

For the meltability test, the method described by Olson and Price [13] was used. Samples of 5.0 ± 0.2 g of Brazilian cheese spread (CONV, TS200, TS400, and TS600) were placed inside a melting tube. Then, the tubes were placed horizontally over an aluminum support and placed in an oven at 110 °C for 8 min. Then, the support was removed from the oven and tilted at a 45° angle to stop the cheese flow. The distance from the reference line to the edge of the melted sample was marked. The support was returned to the horizontal position and left in the oven for an additional 2 min, and the distance travelled by the cheese in the tube was marked again. This distance, measured in millimeters over 10 min is called “cheese flow” and is used as a measure of meltability.

2.4. Fat droplet size determination by confocal laser scanning microscopy

The samples were stained with Nile Red (NR, Sigma, Brazil, 200 mg mL−1) during 15 min at room temperature and analyzed using an epifluorescence microscope (Leica DMI 6000B, Wetzlar, Germany) with an HCX PLFLUO TAR 100 x 1.30 objective lens. A sample drop was placed on a slide and covered with a coverslip. The samples were excited using a Leica EL6000 short-arc mercury lamp, a Leica I3 fluorescence filter cube (with an excitation filter BP 450–490 nm, and a 510 nm dichroic mirror), and a suppression filter LP 515 nm [14]. Image analysis software was used to estimate the diameter of Nile Red-stained lipid droplets (LDs) from images (n = 300 LDs per sample) [15].

2.5. Color

Color measurements were performed in quintuplicate for each of the four Brazilian cheese spread treatments at 5 ± 2 °C on the third day of storage using a portable colorimeter (CR-410, Minolta Sensing Konica, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The L*, a*, and b* coordinates were obtained according to the CIE (International Commission on Illumination) scale, where L* determines the lightness, a* the variation from green (-) to red (+), and b* the variation from blue (-) to yellow (+), using illuminant D65 and a 10° observer. The parameters of hue angle (h°), chroma (C*), and whiteness index (WI) were also calculated using equations (6), (7), (8) [16].

h° = tan−1 (b*/a*)

(6)

C* = (a*2 + b*2)1/2

(7)

WI = 100 – [(100 – L*)2 + a*2 + b*2]1/2

2.6. Texture profile analysis

Texture profile analysis (TPA) of the Brazilian cheese spread was conducted after the third day of refrigerated storage. The evaluation was conducted using a texture analyzer (TA.XT EXPRESS, Stable Micro Systems), and the samples were freshly taken from the refrigerator (5 ± 2 °C). The evaluated parameters included hardness, adhesiveness, gumminess, and cohesiveness. During the tests, the Brazilian cheese spread samples were placed inside cylindrical vessels (55 mm height x 52 mm width). The samples were compressed by a 25 mm diameter cylinder (P/25) to a compression distance of 35% of the original product height at a test speed of 1 mm s−1 using a 5 kg load cell for 2 penetration cycles and 6 repetitions. The test data was collected using the Exponent Lite Express software (Stable Micro System). The evaluated parameters were calculated from the obtained force vs. time curve.

2.7. Rheology

The rheological measurements were carried out using steady-state flow and dynamic oscillatory flow tests in a rotational-type rheometer Paar Physica MCR 300 (Anton Paar GmbH, Graz, Austria), with cone-plate geometry (4 cm, 2°), 1 mm of gap and Physica TEK 150P temperature control system. Samples were placed on the dish and allowed to stand for 10 min at 10.0 ± 0.1 °C for structural recovery.

2.7.1. Construction of Brazilian cheese spread flow curves (shear stress or apparent viscosity versus shear rate)

To obtain the flow curves, shear rates were increased (0 to 100 s−1) and decreased (100 to 0 s−1). Data of the second curve were fitted to the power law model (Eq. (9) using nonlinear regression analysis at STATISTICA 5.0 software (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK, EUA).

σ=Kγn

(9)

Where σ is the shear stress (Pa), K is the consistency index (Pa.sn), γ˙ is the shear rate (s−1), and n is the flow behavior index (dimensionless).

2.7.2. Oscillatory tests

To determine the linear viscoelastic portion, a strain amplitude sweep test (0.01–10%) was previously performed at a fixed frequency of 1 Hz (data not shown). The dynamic oscillatory assays were carried out within the linear viscoelasticity domain by performing frequency sweeps in the 0.1 to 100 Hz range at a constant strain amplitude of 1%. The parameters G' (elastic modulus) and G'' (viscous modulus) were measured, and the loss tangent was determined according to Eq. (10).

(10)

The elastic (G') and viscous (G“) moduli were also used to calculate the complex modulus (G*) following Eq. (11).

The critical gel model (Eq. (12) was used to evaluate the changes in the viscoelastic properties of the samples as a function of frequency. Data were adjusted by nonlinear regression analysis using STATISTICA 5.0 software (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK, EUA).

(12)

where AF (Pa s1/z) represents the gel strength, ω is the frequency in Hz, and z (dimensionless) corresponds to the interaction factor, defined as the number of structural units interacting with each other in a three-dimensional network.

2.8. Fatty acid profile

The fatty acid profile was determined using gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (gas chromatograph model 5975C, Agilent Technologies, EUA) [2]. The gas flow rates were 30 mL min−1 for the auxiliary gas (N2), 1.4 mL min−1 for the carrier gas (H2), and 300 mL min−1 for the synthetic air used for flame ignition. A 2 μL injection volume was used, and sample injection was performed in split mode in the ratio of 1/80 (sample/carrier gas). The injector and detector temperatures were maintained at 235 °C. The column temperature was initially set to 65 °C for 4 min and then increased at 16 °C min−1 to 185 °C. It was held at 185 °C for 12 min and then increased at a rate of 20 °C min−1 to 235 °C, where it was held for 14 min. Peak areas were determined using the Star software (Varian). Fatty acid identification was based on comparison of the retention times obtained for samples with those obtained for standard methyl esters containing linoleic acid geometric isomers c9t11 and t10c12 (189–19 and O-5626, Sigma, USA) and equivalent chain length values (ECL) [17].

2.9. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)

Volatile compounds were determined by solid phase microextraction gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (SPME-GC–MS) [2]. In summary, approximately 1 g of Brazilian cheese spread was transferred to 20 mL headspace vials, to which 2.5 mL of saturated NaCl (Synth, Brazil) solution were added. The SPME extractions were performed using a fiber with 50/30 µm thickness and Divinylbenzene/Carboxen/Polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) coating (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA). Identification of VOCs was carried out using a GC–MS instrument (7890A-5975C, Agilent Technologies), equipped with an automatic injector (CTC Combi PAL Sampler 120, Agilent Technologies) with an appropriate liner for SPME analyses, and an XYZ-type automatic sampler with a compartment for temperature and agitation control for fiber activation and headspace extraction.

The sample composition was determined based on the mass spectra using the Agilent Mass Hunter Qualitative Analysis software (Agilent Technologies version B.04.00), referencing the NIST 11 spectra library.

2.10. Statistical analysis

The Brazilian cheese spread treatments were carried out in duplicate and product analyses were performed in triplicate, except where otherwise indicated. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's test were used for data treatment for all instrumental parameters considering 5% of significance (p < 0.05). The softwares XLSTAT version 2015 (Addinsoft, Paris, France) and STATISTICA 5.0 (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK, EUA) were used.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Gross composition and meltability

The results of the chemical composition and meltability of Brazilian cheese spread after the different treatments is shown in . Regarding gross composition, none of the treatments (conventional or thermosonication) exhibited differences related to the chemical composition of the products (p > 0.05).

Table 2

Meltability, on the other hand, was significantly different among treatments (p < 0.05). All thermosonicated products (TS200, TS400 and TS600) showed lower meltability than control treatment (p < 0.05), which indicate that ultrasonic treatments decreased the flowability of Brazilian cheese spread, making it less fluid, which is highly desirable for a cheese spread to be used in hot recipes, such as pizzas and sandwiches. Ultrasound treatment is known to reduce fat and protein particle size, which could assist in increasing meltability [18], [19]. However, meltability was decreased with ultrasound, especially when lower powers were applied. With the increase in power to 600 W, however, there was a lower difference in meltability of the cheese spread in comparison with the control.

On the other hand, when thermosonication was applied to milk prior to the manufacture of cream cheese, the final product showed higher meltability [18]. A possible explanation for this is that the viscosity of the product may play a role in how US affects meltability of cheese spreads, since opposite effects were observed when thermosonication was applied to milk or curd. It is known that higher viscosity increases the cavitation threshold, hence higher energy is necessary to overcome the cohesion forces of the medium [20]. This could explain why a higher power would be necessary to overcome the higher viscosity of the curd used in the present study and effectively reduce particle size to increase meltability. This also indicates that the effects of thermosonication vary greatly depending on the stage of cheese spread production to which it is applied.

Regarding different parameters, a study on the production of Oaxaca cheese using milk treated with US [21], it was observed that increasing the US treatment time did not affect the melting time compared to the control treatment. In summary, the use of thermosonication did not affect the gross composition of the Brazilian cheese spread, but had a significant effect on meltability, which could be related to changes in the cheese microstructure induced by variation in acoustic cavitation intensity.

3.2. Fat droplet size evaluation

Confocal laser scanning microscopy images of the Brazilian cheese spread samples are presented in . It can be observed that when US power was increased, fat droplet size reduced, which corroborates with the observations regarding meltability of the product. shows the relationship between the area of droplets observed in the microscopic image and the US power applied to the cheese spread. The physical effects of cavitation, such as high-speed microjets and high shear forces could explain the reduction in size of fat particles in the product [22]. These effects are also responsible for the improvement of the emulsification process [23]. The phenomenon of acoustic cavitation is one of the primary effects observed when low frequency US is applied to a liquid. Cavitation involves the forming and implosion of small gas bubbles in the liquid [19], [24]. During cavitation, these bubbles can violently collapse, creating high speed microjets and areas of high pressure and temperature [19], [24]. This can lead to fragmentation of larger particles into smaller ones, including fat globules and proteins present in the cheese spread, also enhancing the emulsification process. As a result, fat and protein particles are distributed more uniformly, contributing to a smoother texture and higher emulsion stability [23], [25], [26], [27].

US also has a direct mechanical effect on fat and protein particles. The energy of the sound waves causes vibration and agitation in the particles, which can break larger aggregates into smaller particles. Furthermore, the motion of the particles induced by acoustic streaming can help disperse the particles more effectively in the liquid, contributing to particle size reduction [26].

3.3. Color

The results for the color analyses of Brazilian cheese spread samples subjected to different treatments (CONV, TS200, TS400, and TS600) can be observed in . The color results are expressed in terms of the parameters L*, a*, b*, C*, h°, and WI. It was observed that cheeses treated with US (TS200, TS400, and TS600) showed higher L* values than the control (CONV), indicating a lighter color. Furthermore, cheeses treated with US have higher WI values, suggesting that they are perceived as whiter compared to the control. The color results indicate that the products treated with US show significant color differences compared to the control, especially in regard to the L* parameter, possibly due to reduction of the fat globules size caused by US, which increases light reflection causes the product to be perceived as whiter/lighter [28]. This lightness and WI increase in thermosonicated Brazilian cheese spread is significant as the milk cream used in the formulation was non-homogenized, and the acoustic cavitation could act on the large fat globules, but could be insignificant if the milk cream had been previously homogenized, since the reduction of the fat globules in the emulsion reflects more light [29].

Table 3

Regarding the different US treatments, the US power seems to have the greatest influence on the color parameters, with the 600 W treatment (TS600) showing the most significant changes compared to the control (CONV), tending to a lighter color, a hue closer to green–blue and a lower color saturation. Depending on color preferences, these color changes may affect consumer perception and acceptance of the product. In this sense, to assess if thermosonication improves the perception of Brazilian cheese spread color, sensory analyses could be performed in future studies.

3.4. Texture profile analysis

The texture profile results for Brazilian cheese spread are presented in . It was observed that an increase in US power caused a significant reduction in the hardness of the Brazilian cheese spread (p < 0.05). The hardness of a food is related to its structure and physical texture. In the case of Brazilian cheese spread, this parameter is influenced by the protein and lipid matrix structure as well as water retention. It is known that US treatment can cause breaking of non-covalent bonds in the cheese matrix, resulting in the separation of protein and fat molecules [30]. This can lead to a softer texture, reflected in the reduced hardness. Ultrasound can also affect the chemical properties of cheese components. For instance, it can accelerate chemical reactions, such as protein or lipid hydrolysis [30], [31], [32], altering the cheese matrix structure. When input energy increases, the fat globule membranes are severely damaged, and the protein structure changes considerably [33]. Ultrasound treatment can also trigger the breaking of disulfide bonds in proteins, causing partial denaturation [31], [34], which can contribute to a softer texture.

Table 4

The increase in US power also caused a significant reduction (in modulus) in adhesiveness when compared to the control treatment, with the lower adhesiveness being observed for the sample treated with 600 W (TS600). The adhesiveness of a food is related to its texture, specifically to the ability of food particles to adhere to each other. In the case of Brazilian cheese spread, adhesiveness may be associated with the ability of the protein and lipid matrices to stick together without separating easily. Similar to hardness, US can affect the chemical properties by accelerating reactions or breaking chemical bonds, for example, which also reduce the adhesiveness. US treatment can break chemical bonds that keep the cheese particles tacky, resulting in less interaction between them [34]. While the effects of adhesiveness variations on consumer acceptance of Brazilian cheese spread have yet to be studied, a reduction in adhesiveness could be desirable due to a reduction in the stickiness of the product.

The results indicate that, based on cohesiveness, the US treatments (TS200, TS400, and TS600) did not significantly affect the ability of cheese particles to stay together, when compared to the control treatment (CONV, p > 0.05). All treatments exhibited similar cohesiveness values, suggesting that the cohesiveness of the Brazilian cheese spread was not significantly affected by US under the tested conditions. This was also observed in a study on Oaxaca cheeses, in which US treatment did not influence the cohesiveness of the products [21]. The authors reported that this was due to cohesiveness being related to the fat content of the cheese. In this sense, as thermosonication did not alter the gross composition of the Brazilian cheese spread samples used in the present study ( ), this lack in significant difference in cohesiveness among the products was expected.

Gumminess is related to the texture and the resistance of food to chewing [21]. Higher gumminess values indicate that the food is more resistant to chewing, while lower values indicate softer food. The results show that gumminess decreases as US power increases (p < 0.05). US treatment at 200 W (TS200) resulted in lower gumminess compared to the control (CONV), and in treatments at 400 W (TS400) and 600 W (TS600), gumminess was further decreased (p < 0.05). This suggests that US affects the texture of the processed cheese, making it softer and less resistant to chewing. The reduction in gumminess observed in cheeses treated with US can also be explained by changes in the chemical properties of cheese components. The US-induced breakage of chemical bonds in proteins and lipids [21] results in a looser internal structure and, therefore, reduced gumminess.

3.5. Rheology

3.5.1. Flow curves

The examination of shear stress versus shear rate ( A) and apparent viscosity versus shear rate ( B) plots provides compelling evidence of the shear-thinning nature of Brazilian cheese spread, which is consistent with previous reports in the literature [35], [36]. In A all treatments showed a pseudoplastic behavior, since there was a rapid increase in shear stress as the sample is coming out of inertia, with a reduction of the increase tendency with higher shear rates. The flow behavior of the thermosonicated samples was similar, indicating that US power did not change this property of the Brazilian cheese spread, which was also similar to the conventional product.

B demonstrates a decline in viscosity with an increasing shear rate, which becomes less steep at higher shear rates. It can also be observed that US treatment had no influence in this behavior of cheese spread. Furthermore, both profiles shown in are in alignment with the anticipated shear-thinning flow behavior of cheese spread. This behavior is attributed to the molecular realignment and disruption of internal structures within the cheese matrix as shear forces intensify, resulting in enhanced flowability [37].

provides a comprehensive overview of the rheological parameters obtained through nonlinear regression, employing the power-law model to fit the flow curve data. The results encompass key insights into the rheological behavior of Brazilian cheese spread under varying processing conditions.

The flow behavior index consistently registers below 1 (ranging from 0.343 to 0.382), confirming the shear-thinning behavior elucidated earlier across all samples of Brazilian cheese spread. The observed values of the flow behavior index had minimal fluctuations in different samples, indicating that the shear-thinning nature of the product was not affected by the US treatments. This indicates the robustness of the cheese spread matrix, emphasizing its consistent rheological response even after different processing treatments.

The observed consistency index is related to the cohesion and flow characteristics of the cheese spread. It was observed that the conventional treatment (CONV) resulted in the highest consistency index (427 Pa sn), indicative of higher internal cohesion and enhanced resistance to flow. In contrast, the thermosonicated samples demonstrated comparatively lower consistency index values (p < 0.05). It was also observed that the consistency index values for thermosonicated samples tended to decrease with higher power, being 312, 303, and 299 Pa sn for 200, 400, and 600 W. However, despite this negative correlation between the consistency index and US power, this variation was not statistically significant (p > 0.05).

Higher consistency index values, as observed in the conventionally treated sample, correspond to elevated internal cohesion, resulting in stronger resistance to flow and a more solid-like behavior. Conversely, lower consistency index values in thermosonicated samples signify reduced cohesion, yielding a more fluid-like, easier-to-flow material [35], [36]. The observed decrease in consistency with increasing US power further corroborates this relationship, revealing the effectiveness of thermosonication in disrupting internal structures and reducing the material's resistance to flow.

Scudino et al. [38] highlighted the positive impact of US treatment on cheese properties, particularly in increasing water incorporation. This effect is linked to the breakdown and reduction in size of casein micelles, expanding the active surface area and enhancing water absorption. Additionally, the interaction between casein and whey protein micelles prevents the junction of para-casein micelles, leading to a weaker gel structure in cheese making process, which can improve the cheese yield but cause loss of consistency. For cheeses, sonication of the milk prior to coagulation can increase the moisture and form fragile bonds between protein molecules, but the sonication of the curd mass used in Brazilian cheese spread seems to only affect these particles’ bonds and interactions, making a softer and less adhesive product. However, these effects are not necessarily harmful to the cheese spread quality, since spreadability of this product is desirable.

3.5.2. Oscillatory tests

The storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G″) reflect the relative elastic and viscous tendencies of viscoelastic materials. Regarding cheese spreads, when G' surpasses G″, the product displays more gel-like properties, while G' being lower than G″ indicates more viscous-like characteristics [39].

As shown in A, the Brazilian cheese spread samples demonstrated viscoelastic behavior, with G' exceeding G″, suggesting the presence of solid-type structures. Moreover, as frequency was increased in the analysis, both G′ and G″ values also rose, demonstrating their susceptibility to frequency variation. The CONV sample notably showed higher G' and G'' values, which indicates its higher viscoelasticity attribute. This implies effective energy storage (G') and dissipation (G''), likely resulting in a firmer, more solid-like texture with improved elasticity and smoothness in mouthfeel [40]. On the contrary, the thermosonicated samples (US) displayed slightly diminished G' and G'' values. In the context of rheological characteristics compared to the CONV sample, the thermosonicated samples might possess a relatively attenuated energy storage and dissipation capacity. From a textural perspective, this discrepancy suggests that these samples could manifest a slightly less firm and more fluid-like texture when compared to the CONV sample. This effect may not be interesting for the present product formulation, but can be applied to other cheese spread products aiming to improve its spreadability or reduce the hardness caused by addition of some ingredients.

The loss tangent (G''/G') consistently remained below 1 for all samples, reaffirming the primarily elastic behavior and a propensity for firmer textures ( B). However, the TS600 sample exhibited a unique behavior where the loss tangent initially exceeded 1 and then dropped after the 1 Hz frequency was applied. This behavior indicates that the US could have interfered with the formation of the protein network by decreasing the gel strength, making the product more viscous. This observation can be corroborated by the analysis of the complex modulus (G*) ( C) and the critical-gel model parameters ( ). The higher the gel strength (AF) and the interaction factor (z), the firmer the samples [41]. In this perspective, CONV was the firmest sample, followed by TS200, TS400, and TS600. These findings demonstrated that US treatment could decrease gel strength possibly by weakening the intermolecular forces in the protein network, and this effect was more pronounced with higher power. As a higher firmness is associated with lower spreadability [42], thermosonication resulted in easier to spread products, which can be a desirable attribute for cheese spreads. The degree to which a reduction in firmness would be desirable, however, would need to be further studied by sensory analysis of the produced Brazilian cheese spreads.

3.6. Fatty acid profile

In this study, ultrasonic power affected the quantity of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) in the cheese spread. Ultrasound treatment at 400 W (TS400) resulted in a higher concentration of SFAs compared to the other treatments (p < 0.05). The control (CONV) also showed a notable amount of SFAs. However, treatments TS200 and TS600 showed lower SFA levels than CONV and TS400 (p < 0.05). The disruption of fat globules releases free fatty acids and triglycerides into the surrounding aqueous phase. These compounds are the primary targets of lipase and esterase enzymes, which may be available to initiate lipid reactions like hydrolysis and oxidation [44], [45].

Regarding monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), the control presented the highest concentration among the samples (p < 0.05). Treatment TS400 had the second highest MUFA content, followed by TS200. Ultrasound treatment at 600 W (TS600), on the other hand, had the lowest monounsaturated fatty acids. This is possibly due to breakage of some bonds with higher US power. Typically, a protective membrane covers milk fat globules, shielding them from oxidation. However, the physical forces of acoustic cavitation may lead to the rupture of milk fat globule membranes. This makes it easier for free radicals generated by acoustic cavitation to target the polyunsaturated phospholipid fraction of the membrane, followed by the primary triacylglycerol fraction within the fat globules [44], [45].

Regarding polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), US treatment at 400 W (TS400) showed the highest concentration when compared to the other treatments, which is desirable from the nutritional point of view since these fatty acids are associated to a better cardiovascular health, but undesirable from the preservation perspective, since the PUFA are more prone to oxidation. Meanwhile, the treatment at 600 W (TS600) showed the lowest PUFA content (p < 0.05). Both CONV and TS200 showed similar levels of PUFA. Other studies did not observe a significant difference in the composition of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids concerning different energy densities applied to dairy beverages [43].

The atherogenicity Index (AI) and the thrombogenicity Index (TI) are calculations that consider the fatty acid composition to evaluate potential impacts on cardiovascular health. Ultrasound treatment at 400 W (TS400) showed the highest values for AI and TI, indicating greater atherogenic and thrombogenic potential than the other treatments. The control (CONV) showed an intermediate value, while TS200 showed a lower value. The TS600 treatment, on the other hand, produced the lowest AI and TI, suggesting a reduced impact on cardiovascular health [46]. Hence, the TS600 treatment resulted in a product with more beneficial properties in this regard.

The overall results suggest that US power influenced the fatty acid composition of Brazilian cheese spread. Ultrasound treatment at 400 W led to an increase in saturated fatty acids, resulting in higher atherogenic and thrombogenic indices, which could have implications for cardiovascular health. Still, the same treatment increased the content of polyunsaturated fatty acid content, which are considered nutritionally desirable for cardiovascular health. On the contrary, US treatment at 600 W reduced the quantity of both PUFA and SFA, potentially affecting the nutritional profile of the product. Therefore, changes in US power influence the fatty acid composition and, consequently, the nutritional characteristics of Brazilian cheese spread. In this sense, the use of thermosonication was beneficial for the product quality in this regard, with treatment TS600 resulting in the cheese spread with the most desirable characteristics.

3.7. Volatile compounds profile

A combination of naturally occurring volatile compounds in milk contributes to the characteristic milk flavor. provides information about the volatile compounds found in Brazilian cheese spread samples subjected to different treatments. In the control treatment (CONV), 34 compounds were identified, while in the thermosonication treatments 32, 31 and 26 compounds were identified in samples TS200, TS400 and TS600, respectively. The presence or absence of these volatile compounds can be attributed to processing conditions, including temperature and US power [45].

Dodecanal and 1-dodecanol were present in TS400 and TS600 but absent in CONV and TS200, which may affect the aroma of the cheese in the 400 W and 600 W US treatments, indicating that these compounds were released at higher acoustic powers. Toluene and 1-octanol were present in all treatments, including the control, indicating that they are common compounds in Brazilian cheese spread. Estragole was present in all treatments except for TS400. This may contribute to the aroma and flavor of the cheese. In another study, the presence of hydrocarbons (such as 1-hexene, 1-octene, 1,3-butadiene, 1-nonene, 5-methyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, benzene, toluene, p-xylene) and volatile carbonyls, such as aldehydes (n-hexanal and n-heptanal) and ketones (2-butanone and 2-pentanone), was only detected in thermosonicated samples [47].

Some volatile compounds were present in one treatment but absent in others. For example, 2-pentanone was present in CONV and TS200 but absent in TS400 and TS600. The presence or absence of these differential compounds may contribute to variations in aroma and flavor between treatments. Ultrasound treatments usually increase the degree of lipid oxidation in sonicated milk products, mainly in higher intensities, generating more volatile compounds and resulting in rapid quality deterioration during storage [48]. Therefore, in this study, as the quantity of identified compounds decreased with increasing ultrasonic powers, this may indicate a possible degradation of aroma compounds, being detrimental to the product quality. In this regard, the lower power intensities (TS200 and TS400) would be better to preserve the volatile compounds.

4. Conclusions

In conclusion, this research provides valuable insights into the utilization of different US powers in the production of Brazilian cheese spread. The findings confirm that US treatments, at varying power levels, significantly influence the texture, color, fatty acid composition, and volatile compounds of the cheese spread. These effects are attributed to the mechanical, chemical, and physical changes induced by acoustic cavitation in the product matrix. The softer texture, lighter color, and modified fatty acid profile observed in the highest US power treatment may be positive regarding the sensory and nutritional characteristics of the final product. However, higher US intensities can negatively affect the volatile compounds and the product taste and aroma. Therefore, these effects could be applied in the development of new products depending on the desired characteristics for the cheese spreads. In summary, this study highlights the importance of optimizing thermosonication parameters to achieve specific quality attributes in Brazilian cheese spread production and opens new paths for further research in this area. In addition, it is very important to perform sensory evaluation of the product to evaluate the consumer's perception and attitudes. Thermosonication processing is a promising technology with wide applications that may contribute to innovation in the dairy industry. In future studies, the evaluation of treatment in bigger scales could also be beneficial to understand these effects in large productions and reduce the costs of this technology.
