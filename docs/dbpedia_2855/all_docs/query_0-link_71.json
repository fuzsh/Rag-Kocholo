        "text": "Last Can Standing\n\nOne of the last cans of Rainier Beer made in Seattle in 2019 was opened 20 years later, by a former employee of the brewery. He tasted it with family and friends. The video was posted by his son on Reddit, who explains the father was a controls engineer at Rainier. To appreciate it fully read the comments that follow the video, from Reddit readers.\n\nThe engineer dad clearly has a good detailed knowledge of beer, as apart his years in the brewing industry he is also, says one Reddit commenter, an experienced homebrewer. He found the beer in excellent condition save for a touch of oxidation, not unexpected after 20 years. He explains the can had been kept cold all that time, not over “40” (40 F.). He explains in this way serious oxidation and of course heat damage were by-passed, which is borne out by the tasting.\n\nAccording to the comments the recipe changed when Miller Brewing subsequently made the beer in Irwindale, California (under contract to Pabst. Pabst bought the Rainier labels when then-owner Stroh closed the Seattle brewery in 1999).\n\nThe beer became a combination of “streams”, according to one likely knowledgeable comment, meant to emulate the Seattle recipe.\n\nThe old Seattle beer certainly poured very clear and with a good head. Its good condition is explained by one comment in an interesting way. Traditional for Rainier was the Asian market. In its last phase the brewery was exporting Rainier to Japan.\n\nJapan, did you know (I did not) has stringent rules on the amount of dissolved oxygen imported beer may contain, to help ensure its quality. That’s impressive.* The Rainier production line took extra precautions to minimize residual oxygen in the cans to ensure the beer would meet Japanese import requirements.\n\nAnyway, those who taste beer regularly – taste for technical understanding, not just usual drinking pleasure, will appreciate this video, especially given its historical interest.**\n\nNot all people who work at breweries are “beer people” – but you know them when you see them, and that man is one of them.\n\n…\n\n*Our Liquor Control Board of Ontario aka LCBO might take note. Just kidding.\n\n**Today Pabst has Rainier made by the City Brewery, another complex corporate and financial tale. For latest developments, see in Brewbound, here.\n\n© 2015-2023 Copyright of Gary M.

I noted that product advertising after World War II deepened an emphasis on lightness, leavened by a reminder to the public of the quality ingredients used and impressive qualifications of its brewery staff.\n\nThis noted, as in the case of most breweries Rainier made some attempt, even after 1945, to offer products with distinctive taste.\n\nThe Gold Circle\n\nThe best example is Rainier Old Stock Ale. Over time the words old stock were de-emphasised in labeling, and disappear in the 1970s. I discussed this product in a separate series recently.\n\nThere were other, lesser-known products. A good example is Rainier Dark, styled in early ads “Culmbacher-type”, so a style of Bavarian dark lager. See in the Oakland Tribune, September 21, 1933. Also documented are a Rainier Stout, Half and Half, and draught-only Bock (Oakland Tribune, February 20, 1934).*\n\nThe June 30, 1941 King City Rustler advertised the Stout, Half and Half, Club Pale Beer, Export Beer, and Old Stock Ale. Samples of the labels can be found in Tavern Trove, on eBay and other sites. Export Beer appears to have been a more characterful, stronger version of Club Pale Beer, the basic lager. Half and Half was a blend of ale and porter introduced in 1940, see article in Hanford Sentinel, December 10 that year.\n\nPre-Prohibition Rainier Beer\n\nAt least ca. 1900, standard Rainier Beer itself was a characterful product, based on period ads. A January 6, 1906 ad in the San Francisco Call included an analysis with the description “soft, creamy, rich”. A high finishing gravity of 1.014, alcohol 3.62 abv, were listed. This was clearly a less strong, richer beer than I discussed earlier made by the owning (Hemrich) family in British Columbia in the 1920s.**\n\nThe beer perhaps evolved in Seattle before discontinuance in Washington State in 1916 due to State-wide prohibition. Alternatively, the Hemrichs made a different Rainier beer in British Columbia than they brewed before Prohibition, possibly with export destinations in mind especially China. Further investigation is outside my scope here.\n\nI wish simply to be clear that at different times in Rainier history characterful products did appear. From all appearances Rainier Beer was the financial workhorse, especially after Prohibition. From a balance sheet standpoint therefore, these others were comparatively minor.\n\nPeace, Love and Beer\n\nVaulting to the late-1960s, even with lightness at a zenith of company culture the brewery still tried to cater to other market segments. Kurt Stream’s 2012 history Brewing in Seattle states Rainier issued an amusingly-named series, sub-titled Light-Light, Light, and Not-So-Light. The naming irreverence is classic ’60s marketing, a lightening up (in that sense) of the earnest approach of the ’50s and earlier.\n\nStream wrote that Light was the basic Rainier Beer, Light-Light was “crisper” (forerunner of modern light beer?), the Not-So-Light was “more robust”. A vintage can appears in the Morean auction site, in a striking cerulean blue. Author Stream indicates the trio concept did not appeal to the public and was soon scrapped, but Not-So-Light was continued for a while under the name Hearty Lager.\n\nEnd Game\n\nIn the brewery’s last years it issued a few craft-style products, responding to the craft beer challenge. Press accounts, see e.g., Ellensburg Daily Record, December 23, 1994, reveal a dispute that arose in 1994-1995 with Bert Grant’s Yakima Brewing & Malting Co., a craft brewer that launched in 1982.\n\nRainier had introduced a full-bodied, craft-styled ale, Yakima Red. A vintage can was listed at eBay. Bert Grant and wife Sherry felt the new release infringed their rights and goodwill built up under their company name. Rainier argued Yakima was simply a geographical place, famous of course for hops, and it saw no reason to change the name. The matter went to federal court in early 1995, but then apparently was settled out of court.\n\nThe public record is sparse but I conclude a deal was worked out when the Grants sold their brewery to a winery (Chateau Ste Michelle, Columbia Crest) later in 1995.\n\nI have a distinct recollection of tasting Rainier’s Yakima Red, and finding it good but without the intensity of the typical craft beer. Large brewers in the early years of the craft renaissance seemed unsure how far to go in palate. Later, they regularly purchased craft breweries with goodwill built up in characterful beers, and entered the market that way. (Some originated craft-style beers in-house, Coors’ Blue Moon is a good example).\n\nThe Rainier brewery in Seattle closed in 1999 after purchase of its label by Pabst, so any further forays into the craft space were moot, for its part.\n\nA last, Part VII, follows.\n\n…\n\n*This listing is not exhaustive.\n\n**I adjusted the discussion of the British Columbia Rainier beer in Part III in light of the 1906 Seattle Rainier data later found.\n\n© 2015-2023 Copyright of Gary M.

The Spokesman-Review carried an ad from Seattle’s Rainier Brewery stating its credo: light beer doesn’t mean absence of flavour.\n\nNote the clever device of a traditional German stein sunk in a modern (1960s) goblet, which underpins the textual message to follow. Light here means light in flavour and body, not low-calorie. It is interesting to ponder which imports were meant, for that part of the message, as there seems no obvious candidate.\n\nThe message though is clear: Rainier’s brewmasters, its plants and processes, the ingredients as depicted in previous ads did not go for nought. Rainier still made a real product that tasted of real beer, more than the blandest American beer did. A “little more” real, yes, but that was enough.\n\nToday we might think that damning with faint praise, but breweries back then were hesitant to challenge a mantra in place since 1945: beer must not be filling, heavy, too bitter, too redolent of the earthy hop, too beery, in a word!\n\n14 years later Canadian journalist and future craft beer consultant Frank Appleton pondered a different reality, in Harrowsmith magazine. He wrote mainstream brewers found it necessary to reduce every characteristic that made beer beer.\n\nRainier was no different, but argued its beer had a quality that lifted it above the indistinguishable mass, subtle as it may be. Maybe Rainier went to this trouble worried the light and mild drumbeat would convince drinkers all beer was the same. That was dangerous territory, as price competition would fritter away the brand’s value over time.\n\nWhat would today’s beer snobs, tickers, nerds think of 1960s Rainier, I wonder? I tasted a few years ago a Rainier beer made by Sleeman Brewery in Ontario. Sleeman held the rights then, probably still, for this market. (Pabst makes Rainier in America for that market, not in Seattle though).\n\nSleeman’s Rainier was very light with a smack of starchy grain adjunct – not my bag at all, and I am more allowing than many of American adjunct lager. But how close was the Ontario Rainier to Rainier in the 1960s? I’m not sure. Beer writer James Roberston in 1978, as I mentioned earlier, gave Rainier Beer an indifferent review.\n\nWas it the same beer still though? We have seen how it evolved constantly over the years, by the company’s own prideful assertions.\n\nAs to the Pabst-made Rainier still sold in the U.S., I haven’t tried it, so cannot say. Maybe one of our readers will submit a taste opinion (see comments section below).\n\nMeanwhile, isn’t that a cool glass, that goblet? Prettier, more beer-satisfying, than the triangular designs in vogue today. Or is that all relative too?\n\nI have my limits.\n\nNote: Series concludes in Part VI: Rainier beers that bucked the light trend.\n\n© 2015-2023 Copyright of Gary M. Gillman. All Rights Reserved.

In October that year the ads made a reveal, to use the idiom of 2024: the real men behind the vats.\n\nThe ads were an answer to readers insisting to know. or so the ads asserted, the real-life, versus fictional brewers of Rainier Beer. Perhaps too the real brewing team was not enthused to see a masquerader represent their hard work, and pressed the management to share the glory, at least.\n\nIn Spokane, a Rainier ad in the Daily Chronicle, October 10, 1961, spilled the beans in this colourful way:\n\nThese men worked either at the main Seattle brewery or Spokane branch. The Spokane brewery had been incorporated into Emil Sick’s brewery group in the early 1940s, to supply Eastern Washington and adjacent markets.\n\nSick also owned breweries outside Washington State, notably Highlander Brewery in Missoula, Montana (which came in for mention earlier at Beer et Seq, in a literary context). Highlander did not produce Rainier beer, however, that was reserved to Sick’s breweries in Washington State.\n\nThe grinning group of malt mixmeisters in the ad was juxtaposed with the fictional persona who represented their public image. For once the real brewers behind the scenes had their moment.\n\nThe ad introduced Rainier’s technical director Nick Vacano, making clear he was the one who had graduated from Germany’s Weihenstephan brewing school. His name is prefaced by “Herr”, a touch of period humour but also conveying the idea of German brewing expertise. Many of the brewing team in fact bore German names, showing the continued connection of Americans with German ancestry to domestic brewing.\n\nUntil shortly before this ad appeared Rainier’s head brewer in Spokane was Michael Poesl, also of German background. Biographical information on him indicates he arrived in America at 18 in the 1920s. He worked under another brewer in Spokane, Adolf Fuld, replacing him on his retirement. Poesl lived to an impressive 100, passing in 2005.\n\nYou see him smiling in 1952 below, in the July 16 Spokane Daily Chronicle that year:\n\nThe picture was included in a spread on the Spokane brewery, the kind of feature newspapers proudly published at one time on valued local industries. The article focused on the installation of glass-lined Pfaudler fermentation vessels, capping as they did a five-year improvement plan.\n\nAlso profiled was the J.E. Siebel brewing school in Chicago, which consulted to Rainier. This reinforced for readers the important role of science and technology in brewing – it was a traditional product, as the article also explained, to a certain point.\n\nTwo years before the 1952 story, another Spokane newspaper featured a photo-spread that showed assistant-brewer Joe Bosch pitching yeast in an old-style wood fermenter (Spokesman-Review, June 22, 1950).\n\nModern, easy-to-clean vessels were steadily installed in American brewing through the 20th century. Spokane’s plant kept up, as the 1952 article showed.\n\nSo we see how Rainier Brewery showcased its plants, people, and processes in the 1950s and ’60s. Initially the ads spoke in frank, ingenuous language, the 1950 and 1952 stories are good examples. By the 1960s the tone changed, a comedic note enters, playful and tongue-in-cheek, in tune with a prevailing advertising style.\n\nPart V continues the series,\n\n© 2015-2023 Copyright of Gary M.

It did so in conjuction with its ongoing Rainier Brewmaster advert series. Rainier hired an actor to project a stern, Germanic master brewer, obsessed with all details of making malt elixir.\n\nDepicting the brewmaster as a German type was a stock device in American beer publicity by then, a legacy of the 19th century cultural German impact on the industry. Have doubt about the German allusion? An early Rainier TV spot should dispel it, showing the “brewmaster” speaking in a faint German accent. In this way Rainier meant to assure the public of its beers’ authenticity and quality.\n\nThe brewmaster campaign was conceived by a New York advertising firm, Doyle Dane Bernbach (DDB), famous for their off-the-wall Volkswagen adverts of the era.\n\nA DDB-Rainier advert of April 14, 1961 in Lewiston Morning Tribune presented the following as ingredients of Rainier Beer:\n\nMidwestern 6 row malt\n\nHannchen [two row] malt\n\nIcy-cold mountain water\n\nYakima Valley hops\n\nSacramento Valley hops\n\nImported Hallertau hops\n\nGolden Iowa corn\n\nRare yeast from Denmark\n\nThe ad explained the brewmaster was a “hard-boiled” type, quality-obsessed not just due to book study but his own father and grandfather! They also had been brewmasters. In folksy style readers were told they formed the hardest brewing school Rainier’s brewmaster ever attended, the second being Weihenstephan in Bavaria.\n\nLater ads made clear the real Rainier chief brewmaster was Nicholas Vacano, who attended that very school. He rose to the position of Rainier technical director for its string of breweries in the 1950s and ’60s.\n\nThe ad noted brewers came from the Far East and even Germany to study its brewmaster’s, i.e., Vacano’s, methods and “set up”. So Rainier emphasised the factors of education, book learning, which its middle and aspirant class customers had to appreciate. The real/fictional brewmasters combined the best of practical and book-learning, in other words.\n\nAmerican brewing then often uses Midwerstern corn, primarily as a cost-saving device (cheaper than barkey malt) but also to promote clarity in beer. (The high protein count of a six-row mash is diluted by cooking corn and similar adjuncts, whose soluble protein content is low).\n\nPrevious Rainier ads, e.g. in 1955 in Grand Coulee’s The Star, described two-row Hannchen malt as a “European” type, light and mild in effect. This meant probably it had a finer flavour than six-row malt, noted for its husky or grainy quality.\n\nDanish yeast descends from the Carlsberg aka Saaz yeast family, vs. the German Froberg-type used in Munich brewing, or Heineken yeast, say. Perhaps it was true Carlsberg yeast was less common in American brewing then than the other, but this apart such usage was not really noteworthy. Similarly for the other ingredients, but listing them sounded impressive for readers.\n\nAn important point – how much corn was used in relation to the malt – was not addressed. Neither was the limit sought in fermentation (final gravity) which largely dictates the body in finished beer.\n\nSuch information, as even the actual alcohol content, is not easy to find for Rainier Beer at different historical stages. I did find an analysis from 1921 showing alcohol by volume at 5.7% and final gravity, a shade under 1.010. It was for Rainier Beer as then made in British Columbia, Canada. From the Vancouver Sun, December 18, 1921:\n\nThe 10% is a reference to British Proof, the Gay-Lussac equivalent is 5.7% abv. 1.010 denotes a reasonable body, although in this writer’s experience, a little on the dry side, especially for the time. The alcohol seems high, too, for average American-type lager then. The alcohol and attenuation may have been fixed with export in mind, China was a particular focus for this brewery.\n\nRainier ads that mention ingredients after 1961 omit the California hops, probably because hop culture in the state withered. Rainier continued to use the German Hallertau for its aroma and flavour, not bittering. The hops grown anywhere on the West Coast in the 1960s were Cluster, either late or early-maturing. This is what “Yakima” almost always meant then, and ditto for any locality in California cited as a hop producer.\n\nOn August 17, 1961, however, Rainier was still using the three hops, as shown by its advery in the Eugene Register-Guard. It elaborated on their qualities: the Yakima grown on Rainier’s own farm were “rich [and] flavorful”. The Sacramento hops were “delicate”, added to “round and smooth the finished brew”.\n\nThe imported Hallertau conferred a “certain piquancy that is impossible to achieve any other way”. It was noted this hop cost three times the price of the others.\n\nIn the 1970s early American beer writer James D. Roberston reviewed Rainier Beer and was little impressed:\n\n…taste is mostly just salty carbonation and the finish is light and brackish.\n\n– The Great American Beer Book, 1978.\n\nHe noted though its “very hoppy aroma”. Indeed Rainier’s ads I have reviewed did stress hop aroma versus the flavour and especially bitterness hops also confer in beer, depending how they are used of course.\n\nRainier wanted to smooth out its beer’s rough edges, as advertising I have previously discussed showed. To a practised palate like Robertson’s the result was indifferent. Yet, generations of Americans, ordinary drinkers, were happy with Rainier Beer. Six of one, half a dozen of the other so to speak.\n\nAs to salt now, a September 25, 1962 advert in the Eugene Register-Guard stated a “pinch of salt” was added to the mountain water, and nothing else. This ties into Robertson’s impression of a salty or brackish quality, although the type of salt used is not known. It may have been sodium chloride, but possibly was another brewers’ salt traditionally used when adjusting water chemistry. Maybe calcium suplhate or gypsum a la Burton, or calcium chloride, Epsom salts, etc.\n\nIt seems hard to avoid the conclusion Rainier in the Smooth Sixties sought a beer-flavoured soda water. Soda water in various forms was an American institution by then: in highballs, plain sparkling water, and soft drinks. The strategy, if accurate, penetrated the consumer psyche. The dominance to this day of light beer, literally light or in general character, bears out the wisdom of Rainier’s strategy – craft apart of course, traditional British ale and stout ditto.\n\nIn the Parts to follow I will look more closely at the actual, vs. fictional brewers of Rainier in the period, the tightrope Rainier walked between beer flavour and blandness, and a row Rainier later had with an early craft brewer.\n\nPart IV follows.\n\n© 2015-2023 Copyright of Gary M.

The industrialist and sports executive had guided the brewery to exemplary post-Repeal success in American West Coast brewing.\n\nSick died in 1964, but Rainier would retain independence until 1977 when sold 100% to another brewery, G. Heilman. I should add that Molson Breweries took a stake, 42%, from Sick before he died. See details in Karen Molson’s history of Molson Breweries.\n\nThe Seattle brewery was finally closed in 1999, when Pabst Brewery bought the labels. Rainier Beer is still marketed by Pabst, made elsewhere in the country.\n\nAfter 1945 Rainier’s drumbeat of light and smooth steps up. Sick’s Rainier Brewing periodically advertised changes in Rainier Beer formulation, I gave an instance in Part I. Product ads rarely give details of hopping and gravities, but there can be no doubt the beer got ever lighter in flavour and body due to the recipe changes.\n\nIn 1958 a Rainier ad, Lewiston Morning Tribune, June 6, posed a question:\n\nTried Rainier’s new taste? Join in the discovery of this wonderfully smooth naturally milder beer. Rainier’s new taste. Naturally milder.\n\nThis was a second formulation change advertised in the 1950s. Now on to May 24, 1960, in the Spokane Daily Chronicle:\n\nThe light touch of Rainier goes with your lighter moments. Exceedingly light, without being thin. Exceptionally smooth and easy going. Rainier has just the right touch of taste – a fine, delicate flavor that invites you to pour another…Add the light touch, make it Rainier, for life.\n\nWe are, here, at an apogee of the American adjunct lager style, a “touch” of flavor remains from a once assertively malty and bitter beverage, as all beer was in the 19th century.\n\nAt some point in the early 1960s, however, Rainier starts to wonder if it went too far in stressing the light and smooth angle. It starts to emphasize more, not that the beer has changed again, but still retains some beery characteristics.\n\nIt did this in two ways, first, by creating its “Rainier Brewmaster” persona, a stern, Germanic-looking fellow who remains preoccupied with smoothness but ensures also his beer is natural and traditionally made. Second, by listing exotically-named ingredients, in this case in an unusual detail.\n\nI will return to the brewmaster and ingredients aspects, but for now draw attention to Rainier’s ad of August 11, 1965, in the Eugene Register-Guard. The advert lampoons the breathy, ingenuous style of the investigative reporter:\n\nInformed sources have stated that despite all the fanfare and hurrahing, one fact is becoming clearly evident – that Rainier does have what is the smoothest beer in history.\n\nThese sources further indicate that the “smooth” Rainier beer has “no sharpness, harshness, roughness, gruffness, bitterness or sting”. Or, as Rainier’s beloved bald-pated brewmaster has stated himself, “Rainier is a joy simply to swallow”.\n\nContinuing the arch tone, the advert quotes an executive that the brewmaster’s contribution is “by no means a drop in the bucket”. Yet, success has not “gone to his head” and he is hard at work, lights on late, working on smoothness still, is the implication.\n\nIn 1978 Frank Appleton in British Columbia, Canada was a general-purpose journalist, a former O’Keefe Brewery quality control supervisor in Vancouver. He had trained in biochemistry and brewing in his Manchester, UK homeland.\n\nHe left O’Keefe after a few years, proving a success at freelance journalism. He was a regular contributor to Harrowsmith magazine, and submitted in 1978 an item on homebrewing. The purport was, with a little effort one could improve on the bland product of the large brewers in Canada then, viz. Molson, Labatt, and Carling-O’Keefe.\n\nHe included a passage that in time would be recognized as a craft brewing manifesto. He quoted the famous words in his 2016 memoir Brewing Revolution: Pioneering the Craft Beer Revolution (Appleton later became a well-known brewing consultant, e.g. for Deschutes Brewery in Bend, Oregon):\n\nThe stage has been reached where all the big breweries are making virtually the same product, with different names and labels. Accompanying this trend is a shift in power from the brewmaster to the advertising, marketing and accounting men.\n\nLike tasteless white bread and the cardboard hamburger, the new beer is produced for the tasteless common denominator. It must not offend anyone, anywhere. Corporate beer is not too heavy, not too bitter, not too alcoholic, not too malty, not too hoppy, not too gassy or yeasty. In other words, corporate beer reduces every characteristic that makes beer beer.\n\nAppleton might have used Rainier’s very words of its August 1965 ad to make his point, and vice versa, for Appleton’s second-to-last sentence.\n\nTo every thing there is a season. Rainier played the light and smooth angle well and successfully for a long time, in tune lager trends then. And who is to say objectively that was wrong?\n\nFrank Appleton, for his part, grew up in northern England in the 1950s and early ’60s. He knew characterful ale and stout for that reason. Without that context, it is doubtful he could have written the words he did. Everything is relative, but unwittingly Appleton tapped into a development that would become a beer renaissance, along with Camra, Michael Jackson, homebrewers, etc.*\n\nBelow is pictured the current Molson Dry, a modern successor to the corporate beer Appleton found wanting in 1978. On its own terms, it is exemplary, nonetheless\n\nContinues in Part III.\n\n…\n\n*The article started to have an impact only from 1981, when Appleton’s first brewing client, Vancouver pub-owner John Mitchell, discussed an idea with him to set up a mini-brewery. Mitchell was also of English background, southern in this case.\n\n© 2015-2023 Copyright of Gary M. Gillman. All Rights Reserved.

Guinness and its continued success, especially in Britain of late, is a major reason. Irish pubs and beers are both similar and dissimilar to British examples—foreign and yet familiar—which exercises its own attraction.\n\nIrish social histories—essays, books, articles – help us to penetrate the mystery and mystique of Irish drinking dens and drink, and the cross-generational appeal.\n\nUlster-born Charles Duff’s pub writing is a good example, especially for the period (1950s). Kevin Corrigan Kearns’ 1995 Dublin Pub Life and Lore: Oral History offers penetrating, affecting insights on pubs and the black beer indelibly associated with them.\n\nIn the book we read electric descriptions of Guinness quality in the wood-barrel days, when porter and stout were naturally dispensed and all-malt: no gases added, no pasteurisation.\n\n“The common pint is one of man’s great allies”, feels [Irish writer] John B. Keane. “Apart from its curative and body-building properties, its appearance is a work of art.” Certain pubs are renowned for serving an especially good pint. Famed pint houses have always possessed ideal cellars in terms of temperatures. Tommy Murray nearly salivates when describing the fantastic pints he used to get at Dooley’s pub on the quays back in the 1930s:\n\n“That pint, I tell you, it was always perfect. Oh, what a drink! They had one of the best cellars in Dublin and it kept a certain temperature. They had the thermometer in the front of the shop—it was like a tube going down—and the first thing you’d do, you’d look at it and you’d know the pint was going to be all right. Oh, they was noted for their pint. And no rush. It might take ten minutes to bring it to a head, the creme. It was so strong that you could feel the substance of it. Oh, lovely. You could drink about twenty of them in a night and the next morning you’d be like a two year old, there’d be no hangover. Yes, sir.”….\n\nIf a good pint is a godly gift, a bad pint is an abomination, an affront to humanity. It is, regrettably, a reality of life—it happens. To the purist drinker it is a woeful experience, seldom forgotten and never forgiven. One feels a “victim” of a bad pint, and the guilty barman is regarded as the “perpetrator” of the crime. So grievous an act is this that Corkery proclaims: “The very walls of a pint house would fall down if a poor pint was served . . . if there is any taint of sourness the barman should be assaulted forthwith.” Serving a bad pint can be an accidental or intentional act. Sometimes it is due to the pumps not being properly cleaned out or a fluctuation in the cellar temperature…When Paddy Mooney, 75, was duped…it affected not only his sensibilities but his system…\n\n(Image via Wikipedia Commons)\n\nThe comments of subject Corkery on sourness as a bane prompts some sober (in this case) reflection among devotees of porter and stout. Good evidence suggests a lactic tang once threaded Guinness, entering casks at St. James Gate in a complex blending procedure.\n\nVictorian brewing writer Frank Faulkner explained the details in his 1884 brewing manual, involving vatted stout, young beer, and partly-fermented beer. Beer long-aged in the vats contributed the racy taste, the other beers more sweetness and body.\n\nBy an Irish sorcery a new and bewitching taste arose. In 1921 another brewing writer described it this way, proving quite the pint-poet himself:\n\nTo the mind of the writer it is the will-o’-the-wisp sub-acidity that does the trick in Irish stout. Take it away and you’ve little left but a black, heavy, dry, but very soft and full mild ale with a lot of hops in it — nothing very characteristic or outstanding. Curious that no one has succeeded in fathoming and grasping that extraordinary suggestion of a rare old vintage wine — something lactic it exposes to us — hidden away in the chocolate-coloured depths. In the export variety you get too much of this sub-acid touch and consequently too little of the limpid polished fullness. But the home consumption product has a veritable perfection of nicety of balance in this respect: it is indeed a wonderful work of the Art of Brewing.*\n\nYet, Corkery told Kearns even a trace of sour would raise the wrath of a wronged consumer. This must remain one of those historical conundrums. Perhaps practice varied from the ideal, or different drinkers perceived a set level of “sour” differently.\n\nIn any case, the people-poets in Kearns’ book take flight on the subject of their native stout. And isn’t all beery versifying popular? English wasn’t the historical Irish language, but the Irish mastered it, and then some, ending as bards of the barrel.\n\nThe black stuff is more standardized in taste and serving method today, but the poetry of taps and taverns continues in the Emerald land.\n\nBelow Beer et Seq contemplates a pint of Guinness elixir in Toronto a few years ago.\n\n__________________________________________\n\n*For full 1921 quotation and source, see notes some years ago by Ron Pattinson.\n\n© 2015-2024 Copyright of Gary M.

A 1940 ad for Quebec’s Black Horse Ale is instructive, discussed in my post Black Horse Ale and “The Rock”:\n\nThe ad depicts a traditional wooden vat, even though by 1940 metal, ceramic, and glass-lined vessels had wide use in brewing applications. Indeed in about 10 years remaining wood vats were pulled out of most breweries and replaced by such modern, easier-to-clean vessels. The advert copy invoked the brewery’s “traditions” while arguing these included ongoing product improvement.\n\nBoldly declared was that Black Horse Ale is now living its best life. Specifically, 1940 Black Horse is better than Black Horse of 25 years earlier, and 1915 Black Horse was better than 1890 Black Horse!\n\nNot too many brewers would put it that way today. Makers of a utilitarian product like a kitchen cleanser might, but beer has never been viewed that way, or only that way. Famous brands, national or regional, pack an emotional investment Mr. Clean doesn’t.\n\nSo strong were the mid-1900s notions of progress and “better living” that the brewing industry was inevitably drawn in, indeed became an exemplar.\n\nThis is at odds today with the craft ethos. Today, once created and having found a market, we want a brand to stay the same. We want it eternally green and natural, as if pristine from nature’s loins.\n\nAs many reading will recall, indignant reactions abounded when the brewers of Samuel Adams Boston Lager and Stone IPA anounced changes to their recipes. Of course, after a short time these brands carried on as before; the beer scribes’ umbrage seems, today, well, small beer.\n\nDitto when an old brewery closes, or a venerable brand is de-listed, usually one rarely or never bought by those lamenting its cruel, corporate fate.\n\nIn the mid-1900s in a relentlessly progressive (old sense) America, “new and improved” became a mantra to sell soap, toothpaste and detergent, among many other products. Beer too in that era might sport the N & I sticker, literally or by implication from connected advertising.\n\nAn American example is early-1950s Rainier Beer, then brewed in the Northwest by the Canadian-origin Sick family. The ad below, from the May 21, 1953 Spokesman-Review, emananated from the branch brewery in Spokane, Washington:\n\nThe revamped Rainier bore the same name as before. See e.g. a 1947 ad in Scandinavian American for “Rainier Beer”. (I refer here to the Seattle and Spokane Rainier, not the one made in San Francisco by a separate company, which the Sicks ended buying anyway, in late 1953).*\n\nSo the recipe was new, not the brand that is. Diamond Draft was a new name for the draught, in recognition of the brewery’s diamond anniversary. A later advert made clear Diamond Draft was itself a new recipe, therefore genuinely a new brand.\n\nSick’s was not chary, quite the contrary, to annnounce the re-formulation of bottled Rainier Beer. The ad used marketing speak to say bittering was being reduced, and hop flavour and aroma, enhanced, a trend in American brewing then.\n\nThe ad also touted Hannchen malt, a two-row variety, which meant the brewery sought a more refined, “Continental” character than standard American six-row barley could produce, or on its own.\n\nFinally “balance” is mentioned, a term everywhere in beer labeling today. Everything changes over time in brewing, except where it doesn’t.\n\nOne thing that has changed is, rather than continually improve or at least tout the improvement of a core product, craft brewers prefer to issue new brands from time to time. Their small size, speaking generally, allows this, while large brewers with huge advertising budgets are less nimble.\n\nSeries continues with Part II. This series forms part of a larger one with the collective title, “An Examination of Five Notable Mid-Twentieth Century American Brands”. See here for further details.\n\n…\n\n*Sick thereupon sold the plant to Theodore Hamm’s Brewery of Saint Paul, Minnesota, retaining rights to the Rainier name only. Henceforth he ensured all Rainier Beer was made in Seattle, its original home, and Spokane. The Spokane brewery was closed in 1962, Seattle’s continued until a buy-out in 1999 when it was closed. Seattle before Prohibition was the historic home of Rainier Beer, from 1878. The San Francisco connection developed as a way to avoid state prohibition in Washington, until National Prohibition ended all legal brewing in America in 1920. Ownership diverged from 1934, after Repeal, when Fritz (the father) and Emil G. Sick bought the Seattle brewery that had made Rainier Beer before 1920, turned to other uses during Prohibition. (My aim is not primarily to investigate issues related to the period of dual ownership of the Rainier brand, but it is not possible to ignore them completely, for some aspects of my series on Rainier Ale and Rainier Beer).\n\n© 2015-2023 Copyright of Gary M.

That this sort of entertainment is a trifle too starchy for our own taste is unimportant compared to the pleasure it gives others. Besides, we are a thousand miles away in Seattle, so we couldn’t hear it if we wanted to. (Do you want to know the real reason? O.K., the real reason is we did a survey that shows the people who like Our Product the most are either highbrows or lowbrows. It costs a lot of money to reach lowbrows because there are so many of them and they aren’t a particularly grateful bunch, either – probably because everybody wants to do something for them. You ask them to run down to the store and buy some, but do they?\n\nNope. Highbrows, on the other hand, are pitifully grateful for any little thing you do for them; it sort of gets you. They may not be numerous, but by golly they can sure sprint down to the store. In the old mercantile track meet give us highbrows every time.)\n\nWhich is why we have been offering Beethoven, Brahms, or Bach Sweatshirts over KSFR. The response was so enormous that we are extending the offer to music lovers the country over; even though Rainier Ale is at present only available on the West Coast.\n\nThe ads were the brain-progeny of the San Francisco-based ad agency Weiner & Gossage. So stated Printer’s Ink, January 19, 1962, a trade magazine for the advertising industry. An article typed their ad approach as “sophisticated” among other advert campaigns in the beer industry.\n\nIn 1959 Time magazine profiled Rainier’s ad writers as “the kooksters”,\n\n… a pair of offbeat West Coast admen named Joseph Weiner, 43, and Howard Gossage, 42, who…floated to prominence clinging to champagne bottles, beer kegs, brandy snifters and…fifths of Irish. In the process they have broken almost every advertising rule in the book. Their ads are casually illustrated, almost never done in color, and they can pussyfoot around a subject so quietly that the reader sometimes has trouble telling what the ad is about. What they do have is fun, an aged-in-the-wood humor that tickles readers and rings up billings of $1,000,000 a year from clients who give them some 20% of the gross, compared to the usual agency fee of about 15%. Says bearded Joe Weiner: “People don’t read ads. They read what interests them.”\n\n….Gossage, who had run a successful campaign for Australia’s Qantas airlines as a vice president of San Francisco’s Cunningham and Walsh, became the firm’s writer and thinker; Weiner, who had his own small agency for eleven years, handled the business details and helped kook up the campaigns. For one of their first accounts, Oregon’s Blitz-Weinhard brewery, they placed an ad in The New Yorker that read: “Keep Times Square Green! A modest reforestation proposal from Oregon’s largest and only brewery as a fitting prelude to Oregon’s glorious 1959 centennial celebration. Just picture what reforestation will do for Times Square! Cool and green, teeming with game, salmon swimming up Pepsi Cola sign to spawn.”\n\nIt had practically nothing to do with beer, but thousands of readers blitzed Blitz with pleas for trees, gave the company a word-of-mouth circulation far beyond the cost of the ad.\n\nJoseph Weiner’s beard, in ca. 1960 America, denoted an off-beat personality. The goatee especially was a Beat Generation cliché at the time, widely disseminated by popular media.\n\nThe Communication Arts site has trenchant notes on the career of Howard Gossage (d. 1969). He was a U.S. Navy combat pilot, turned adman. Perhaps his hellbent war experiences inclined him to the absurd in a civilian context.\n\nThe sweatshirt gambit steered away for the most part from the male-female fixation of the year before.\n\nThe new adverts did contain a reminder of the 1961 campaign via a small-type footnote that repeated Rainier Ale was for males, but the sweatshirts in fact were offered in male or female sizes.\n\nAnother Rainier sweatshirt offer, same newspaper on February 27, 1962, noted Rainier’s policy to “combine the cultural with the vigorously masculine”. Profiled was a long-distance walker, that strider of continents, “Coach John Stahl”, Rainier’s “athletic director”. The sweatshirt offer was tied to a walk to Seattle, to see the World’s Fair.\n\nAt the time marathons and similar exhibitions were considered a typical male activity, as the Boston Marathon proved notoriously later that decade. This tied in to Rainier’s arch insistence that Rainier Ale was for men. That is, it was a subversive way to argue the opposite, as the background on Weiner & Gossage should make clear.\n\nOne way or another “philosopher” Gossage as Communication Arts typed him, along with Weiner at times and other associates, proved highly successful.\n\n© 2015-2024 Copyright of Gary M.

He may not be as limber as he once was, and skip the wilder shores of beerish adventures. But his recompense is simple: fine beer abounds wherever he still ventures, in greater variety than ever, be it in Britain, Europe or North America.\n\nIn the craft and independent sectors average quality is better now, too. Maybe one had to be there in the old days, but a lot of indie and craft beer was indifferent in quality. I salute David Bruce as the independent pioneer he was, but was never impressed with his pubs’ early beers. In North America some early brewpubs and crafts used malt extract, and it showed.\n\nWith beer excitement on the rise internationally at the time, quality (versus novelty) was little remarked on, for a variety of reasons. Solidarity with a young and struggling industry was foremost. All who marched in the beer cause knew that for every regional and national success, failures abounded. And most successful small breweries were just that, small, providing a living for their owner-operator(s) and not more. One wanted to boost a fledgling industry, not knock it.\n\nLimited palate perspective also played a role. How many brewers before 2000 had travelled over the Atlantic, or even the Channel? Even if they did, they didn’t necessarily encounter the best offerings. Imports only gave a partial idea, and were in small number except in larger centres.\n\nJohnny may be husbanding his energies as a grown adult, but knows he is living his best life, right here, right now. In saying this I do not minimise the problems craft and independent brewing currently face. The founder of iconic Sierra Nevada Brewing, Ken Grossman, recently layed out numerous challenges. He cited the after-effects of Covid-19, the Russia-Ukraine War’s impact on grain prices, and high energy costs as continuing impediments to growth and even survival.\n\nBut he also noted the industry has overcome parlous times before, in the 1990s. He predicts in fact a revival of industry fortunes, but is unsure how deep the recovery will be.\n\nThis writer takes a longer view, a luxury businesspeople don’t always have, and feels upbeat. The beer revolution will not wither: it is too well-established for that even as N/As, malternatives and spiked sodas will continue to impact (not negate) beer’s future. And to some degree, good beer is a victim of its own success. Large brewers have contributed to this by donning the craft cloak and providing good-tasting products, but while sometimes feeling miffed, Johnny won’t begrudge them that.\n\nHe remembers, as do those who were “present at the creation”, that the omnipresent complaint was to have more beer, in more variety, from a raft of producers. Local and independent status was valued by many – one thinks of the CAMRA “funeral marches” for local closures – but foremost was the concern for distinctive beer. Courage Imperial Russian Stout, when made into the 1990s, was valued no less for coming from a big brewer, or Ind Coope Burton Ale, or Guinness Foreign Extra Stout.\n\nSmaller brewers saw the opportunity and created much of the excitement, but the beer they made, which got better each decade, was the main thing. Not their scale, or “passion”, or back story.\n\nAnd what we wanted has come to pass. We have to take “yes” for an answer, finally, Johnny knows this at heart.\n\nBut ways to the consumer’s heart can still be found. Brewers will need to be ever more nimble and creative, and the indie and craft sectors are ideally situated to spearhead the changes going forward. Big brewing has its advantages, but tends to be less flexible and original than Johnny’s spirit friends in craft and indie brewing.\n\nThat being so, beer writers will have lots to write about: new brewers (there are some)*. Mutating and novel beer styles. The ever-changing pub business.\n\nWant more? Beer personalities, beer history, beer and food, beer inputs (malt, hops, etc.). Beer subjects abound, as quality beer does today and will for a generation and more to come.\n\n_______________\n\n*Raise a cheer for new entrant Carleton Brewing, in Skipton.\n\n**An alternate name for Johnny Beer might be Amita Ale. The other skipped off my tongue first, so I’ll stick with that.\n\n© 2015-2023 Copyright of Gary M. Gillman. All Rights Reserved.
