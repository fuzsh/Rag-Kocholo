Animal cruelty is defined as behaviors that cause unnecessary pain, suffering, distress, and/or the death of animal. These acts may be obvious aggressive acts against an animal intended to cause pain or suffering or they may result from a failure to provide basic care necessary to preserve an animal's well-being. Tennessee State law makes the following illegal under its animal cruelty and related laws.\n\nAnimal fighting\n\nInjuring, maiming, or killing any animal\n\nDepriving an animal of necessary food or drink\n\nMetro Animal Care and Control Officers enforce Nashville city code and Tennessee State Statues pertaining to animals. They hold the responsibility for responding to requests for help with stray animals, dangerous animals, animals in distress/injured animals and many other issues involving animals. They help to provide resources and education to the public in relation to their pets, and are key players in the documentation, investigation, and prosecution of animal cruelty cases. Our staff are often the first responders on scene where evidence of animal cruelty may be present. We also provide care for many animals every year that have been the victims of abuse and neglect. We work closely with local authorities to document, collect, and preserve evidence for further evaluation and prosecution."
