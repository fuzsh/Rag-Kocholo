[...] It involves one person who is investing a lot of time and energy into a connection with someone (in this case, a celebrity) who often doesn’t know the admirer exists.\n\n-PsychCentral\n\nCOD has yet to be acknowledged as a clinical condition in the Diagnostic & Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, but if the world’s obsession with Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s courtship suggests it’ll happen sooner than later.\n\nMost of us are just fans with a healthy interest our favorite celebs.\n\nDo we love Marvel movies? Yes. Would we exit Terra in a heartbeat to join the spacefaring Marvel Universe? Also yes. But if we saw Star-Lord, aka Chris Pratt, grabbing a bite at The Pink Door in Seattle, we wouldn't so much as wave at the man.\n\nBecause we're normal.\n\nCatching a glimpse of our favorite celebrities out and about in the real world is exciting, but that's where it ends for us. That may be why so many celebrities are flocking to laid-back cities like Boise and Seattle where they can live relatively normal lives.\n\nJust like Boiseans have grown accustomed to spotting Aaron Paul and Pierce Brosnan around the Treasure Valley, it doesn't phase Seattleites to bump into the 15 celebrities in the gallery below.\n\nScroll for 15 celebrities you're most likely to see in Seattle.\n\n15 Stars & Celebrities You Can See Walking Around Seattle\n\nGallery Credit: Ryan Antoinette Valenzuela\n\nNEXT: 10 Celebrities You're Most Likely to Run Into in Idaho\n\nGetty Images for H&M [Aaron Paul][/caption]\n\n10 Celebrities You're Most Likely to Encounter in Idaho\n\nNEXT: 4 Boise Restaurants A-List Celebrities Love Eating At\n\n4 Boise Restaurants A-List Celebrities Love Eating At\n\nGallery Credit: Ryan Antoinette Valenzuela"
