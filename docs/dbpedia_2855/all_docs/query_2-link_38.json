        "text": "Leave of Absence\n\nFamily and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) for Medical & Maternity/Paternity Leave\n\nWhat does the Family and Medical Leave Act provide?\n\nThe Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) entitles eligible employees to take unpaid, job protected leave for immediate family and employee’s medical reasons with continuation of group health insurance coverage under the same terms as if the employee had not taken leave.\n\nEligible employees are entitled to:\n\nAn eligible employee is entitled to a total of twelve (12) workweeks of unpaid leave in a twelve (12) month period based on one or more of the following reasons:\n\nThe birth of a child and to care for the newborn child within one year of birth;\n\nThe placement of a child for adoption or foster care, and to care for the newly placed child within one year of placement;\n\nTo care for the employee’s immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent, but not a parent in law) who has a serious health condition;\n\nThe serious health condition of the employee;\n\nTo address a qualifying exigency as defined under FMLA arising out of the fact that the employee’s spouse, child, or parent is a covered military member on covered active duty; and/or\n\nTo care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness. This special leave entitlement for service member caregivers grants eligible employees a total of twenty-six (26) workweeks/960 hours of leave in a single twelve (12) month period.\n\nWho is eligible for FMLA?\n\nIn order to be eligible take leave under the FMLA, an employee must:\n\nHave worked for FIU (employer) at least 12 months prior to the event; and\n\nHave worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months prior to the start of the FMLA leave.\n\nHave worked for FIU for 12 months. The 12 months of employment are not required to be consecutive in order for the employee to qualify for FMLA leave. In general, only employment within seven years is counted unless the following criteria is met:\n\nThe break in service is due to an employee’s fulfillment of military obligations, or\n\nThe break in service is governed by a collective bargaining agreement or any other written agreement.\n\nLeave Entitlement\n\nLeave may be taken on a continuous, intermittent, reduced workday/workweek basis or a combination thereof.\n\nFor the birth or placement of a child, the FMLA leave entitlement expires at the end of the 12 months from the date of the birth or placement of the child.\n\nSpouses who are both employed by the university may be limited to a:\n\nCombined total of twelve (12) weeks of leave during a twelve (12) month period if the leave is taken to care for the employee’s parent with a serious health condition, for the birth or placement of a child; or\n\nCombined total of twenty-six (26) weeks of leave during a single twelve (12) month period to care for a covered military service member with a serious injury or illness.\n\nImportant FMLA Leave Facts\n\nWhen is it required to report and follow the FMLA leave process?\n\nThe employee or supervisor is responsible for reporting any medical leave of absences to the Human Resources Leave Administrator. Reporting a medical Leave of Absence (LOA) in a timely manner is imperative as the university must abide by federal regulations. The employee is required to submit his/her request for a leave of absence 30 days in advance. The employee or department is required to report a leave of absence to Benefits Administration if it consists of the following:\n\nLeave of four or more consecutive days, intermittent leave or a reduced work schedule.\n\nEmployee’s conditions requiring an overnight stay in a hospital or other medical care facility.\n\nConditions that incapacitate the employee or a family member for four consecutive days or longer.\n\nChronic conditions that cause occasional periods of absence when the employee or employee’s family member are incapacitated and require treatment by a health care provider at least twice a year (Intermittent Leave).\n\nMaternity/Paternity.\n\nIs FMLA Paid Leave?\n\nThe FMLA is unpaid leave. However, employees at FIU are required to use their accrued sick and vacation leave hours while on leave. Upon depletion of sick and vacation leave hours, employees will be placed on leave without pay status, with the option of continuation of group health insurance coverage under the same terms as if the employee had not taken leave.\n\nBenefits Administration will then review the eligibility of Sick Leave Pool and Catastrophic Pool benefits, if applicable.\n\nHelpful FMLA Links\n\nNew Leaves Overview Presentation Video\n\nFMLA Overview\n\nFMLA Frequently Asked Questions\n\nFIU’s Leave Process\n\nEmployee Rights under the Family and Medical Leave Act\n\nThe Employee’s Guide to the Family and Medical Leave Act\n\nThe Employer’s Guide to the Family and Medical Leave Act\n\nFMLA Leave of Absence (LOA) Process\n\nFIU, as an employer, is responsible for complying with all federal, state, and local regulations, as well as university policies.

After the initial 30 days, the law allows those on active duty to receive the necessary pay to fill any gap between their military and civilian pay and continue their existing benefits.

Voluntary separations include resignation with notice, resignation without notice, job abandonment, and retirement. Involuntary separations include layoff, end of appointment, completion of contract, and discharge. All non-faculty involuntary separations must be processed by the department in conjunction with Employee & Labor Relations (ELR). For information regarding faculty separations, please contact Academic Affairs at (305) 348-2168.\n\nResignations\n\nEmployees voluntarily separating from the university should submit a minimum of two weeks notice. Certain positions may necessitate extended notice due to the complexity/operational issues associated with the position.\n\nAn employee will notify the supervisor of intent to resign in writing. The supervisor should immediately notify the employee of their acceptance of the resignation in writing and clearly indicate that they accept the resignation and confirm the effective date. If an employee gives a verbal resignation, the supervisor should respond in writing to accept the resignation. Both the employee’s resignation and supervisor’s acceptance should be promptly sent to ELR via email at elr@fiu.edu, on the day of receipt. A resignation may not be rescinded by the employee without concurrence by the university.\n\nSeparation Process for All Departing Employees\n\nThe employee and supervisor must complete the Separation from Employment/Transfer Clearance Form on or before the effective date of separation. The form is completed online and printed, signed by the supervisor, and submitted to ELR at elr@fiu.edu for processing. An employee is required to return all university property issued during their tenure and to settle all outstanding debts and accounts with the university prior to their last day. FIU reserves the right to offset funds, if applicable, which are due to the employee at the time of separation to compensate for unreturned property or unsettled accounts. The employee is responsible for contacting the Student Financials Office if the Tuition Waiver is in effect for the semester. The employee is also responsible for contacting the FIU One Card Office regarding the balance of funds on their account. The supervisor should notify the departing employee that funds owed to the employee at the time of separation will not be processed until the Separation from Employment/Transfer Clearance Form is completed, signed by both employee and supervisor, and forwarded to ELR for processing.\n\nEmployees should keep contact information up to date in my.fiu.edu including home/mailing address. Any future correspondence will be mailed to the address on file provided by the employee.\n\nUpon receipt of separation/transfer documents, ELR will send an email to the employee requesting they complete an Exit Review Questionnaire and Exit Interview (see Exit Review Questionnaire information below). The employee will be directed to schedule an appointment with a representative from ELR on or before their effective separation date.\n\nIf the employee has one year of continuous employment as a benefits eligible employee at the time of separation, the employee shall be paid, in accordance with the Vacation Leave Policy (accessible via the Policies and Procedures Library), the balance of unused vacation leave as of last day worked (not to exceed the maximum accrual amount stated in the Policy).\n\nIn accordance with the Sick Leave Policy, employees will not be paid any sick leave hours upon separation with one exception: employees with ten years of consecutive service at the university as of July 1, 2005, will be paid 25% of the accrued sick leave hours as of July 1, 2005 or current balance, whichever is less, at the time of separation.\n\nExit Review Questionnaire\n\nThe university asks employees to complete an Exit Review Questionnaire and Exit Interview in an effort to assist with our retention and recruitment efforts. This process has been established for employees who are transferring or voluntarily separating from their employment with FIU. Upon receiving separation documents, Employee & Labor Relations (ELR) will send an email to the employee requesting they complete an Exit Review Questionnaire and Exit Interview. The employee will be directed to schedule an appointment with a representative from ELR on or before the effective separation date. The Exit Review Questionnaire is designed to elicit voluntary information about each transferring or departing employee’s experience at FIU and the reason(s) for their leaving. This data is collected, analyzed, and appropriately reported to FIU leaders to recommend improvements to policies, procedures, and practices. This information will assist with identifying work environment issues contributing to both retention and turnover, as well as providing exiting employees an opportunity to identify areas where the university does well and areas we can improve.\n\nTransferring within FIU\n\nAn employee transferring to another department should coordinate the effective date of the transfer with the assigned recruiter and submit a resignation letter. When possible, employees transferring should provide a minimum of two weeks notice.\n\nAll employees transferring to a different department should also complete the Separation from Employment/Transfer Clearance Form to return appropriate items that belong to the department from which the employee is departing. The form is completed online and printed, signed by the supervisor, and submitted to ELR at elr@fiu.edu for processing.\n\nSupervisors must work with their departmental technical support to update membership to any groups utilized to manage internal share drives. In the event the department does not have internal technical support, a request can be submitted via an online request directly with the Division of Information Technology.\n\nUpon receipt of transfer/separation documents, ELR will send an email to the employee requesting they complete an Exit Review Questionnaire and Exit Interview. The employee will be directed to schedule an appointment with a representative from ELR on or before his/her effective separation date. An employee transferring from a non-exempt position to an exempt position who has accrued compensatory leave time will be paid by the departing department in which the employee earned the leave."
