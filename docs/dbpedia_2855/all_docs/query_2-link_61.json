        "text": "Overview\n\nThe mission of the Office of Animal Control is to enforce city and state codes, rules, and regulations and to investigate animal neglect and cruelty cases for the purpose of protecting the health and safety of Baltimore’s human and animal residents.\n\nThe Office of Animal Control operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It receives an average of 65 calls a day and approximately 22,000 complaints annually.\n\nAnimal Control receives the majority of its complaints and cases through the city’s 311 system. Below are the categories for animal-related calls:\n\nAnimal in Danger/Injured/Abused/Neglected\n\nAnimal Attack - Against Human\n\nAnimal Attack - Against Another Animal\n\nAggressive Animal\n\nAnimal Trapped in Vacant Building\n\nWildlife (sick, injured, or found inside living space)\n\nStray Held\n\nUnsanitary conditions\n\nFailure to Restrain\n\nBarking Dog\n\nWild or Domestic Animal Trap Request\n\nDead Animal Pick-up (stray or wildlife)\n\nAnimal Protection\n\nIf you witness an animal being abused or an animal attack in progress, please call 911. If you are concerned about an animal being neglected or suspect abuse, please call 311 or access the Customer Service Request Online.\n\nAnimals picked up by Animal Control are turned over to the Baltimore Animal Rescue and Care Shelter, Inc. (BARCS) to find their owners or to find new owners if deemed adoptable.\n\nHow to Apply for a Pet License\n\nStep 1: Have your pet(s) vaccinated for rabies, and keep the rabies vaccination certificate.\n\nStep 2: Purchase a pet license tag.\n\nAll cats and dogs over age four months must be licensed. Pet licensing is extremely important as a means of confirming that pets have been inoculated against Rabies. Rabies inoculation is necessary, even for pets that remain indoors, because bats frequently gain entry to homes and are then pursued by pets, making bites likely. Licensing helps reunite lost animals with their owners and provides critically needed revenue to support open admission shelters, such as BARCS.\n\nTrap-Neuter-Return (TNR)\n\nIn February 2009, Baltimore City implemented the Trap-Neuter-Return Program. Regulations defining the responsibilities of feral cat caregivers and the Animal Control Program were promulgated during this time also. Click here for the trap-neuter-return regulations.\n\nBARCS Community Cat Program\n\nThis is a Free spay/neuter and rabies vaccination program for outdoor cats in Baltimore City.\n\nHave an outdoor cat colony in your neighborhood? Please call 443-240-8530 or email us.\n\nFor additional spay/neuter resources.\n\nResources\n\nBaltimore Healthy Pets Brochure\n\nDHMH Rabies Fact Sheet\n\nRegulations Regarding Animals\n\nAnimal Hearing Panel Regulations\n\nAcceptable Standards for Issuing Facility Licenses (for clinics, shelters, and pet fanciers)\n\nAcceptable Standards for Proper Restraint of Animals\n\nAcceptable Standards for Proper Animal Care\n\nRegulation Wild, Exotic, and Hybrid Animals\n\nRegulatory Action on Electronic Fences as Animal Restraints\n\nRules and Regulations Relative to Horse Stables and General Care of Horses\n\nTrap-Neuter-Return Program Regulations\n\nTrap-Neuter-Return Program Application\n\nFile(s) available on this page for download requires special software to view.
