        "text": "Retaliation occurs when an employer takes a materially adverse action because an individual has engaged, or may engage, in activity in furtherance of the EEO laws the Commission enforces.[4] Each of the EEO laws prohibits retaliation and related conduct: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII),[5] the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA),[6] Title V of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),[7] Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 501),[8] the Equal Pay Act (EPA),[9] and Title II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA).[10] These statutory provisions prohibit government or private employers, employment agencies, and labor organizations[11] from retaliating because an individual engaged in \"protected activity.\"[12] Generally, protected activity consists of either participating in an EEO process or opposing conduct made unlawful by an EEO law.\n\nSection II of this guidance explains the concepts of participation and opposition, what types of employer actions can be challenged as retaliation, and the legal standards for determining whether the employer's action was caused by retaliation in a given case.\n\nSection III addresses the additional ADA prohibition of \"interference\" with the exercise of rights under the ADA.[13] The interference provision goes beyond the retaliation prohibition to make it also unlawful to coerce, intimidate, threaten, or otherwise interfere with an individual's exercise of any right under the ADA, or with an individual who is assisting another to exercise ADA rights.\n\nSection IV addresses remedies, and Section V addresses promising practices for preventing retaliation or interference.\n\nThe breadth of these anti-retaliation protections does not mean that employees can immunize themselves from consequences for poor performance or improper behavior by raising an internal EEO allegation or filing a discrimination claim with an enforcement agency. Employers remain free to discipline or terminate employees for legitimate, non-discriminatory, non-retaliatory reasons, notwithstanding any prior protected activity.[14] Whether an adverse action was taken because of the employee's protected activity depends on the facts. If a manager recommends an adverse action in the wake of an employee's filing of an EEOC charge or other protected activity, the employer may reduce the chance of potential retaliation by independently evaluating whether the adverse action is appropriate.\n\nShort companion publications on retaliation are available on the EEOC's website:\n\nQuestions and Answers: Enforcement Guidance on Retaliation and Related Issues https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/questions-and-answers-enforcement-guidance-retaliation-and-related-issues\n\nSmall Business Fact Sheet: Retaliation and Related Issues https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/small-business-fact-sheet-retaliation-and-related-issues\n\nII. ELEMENTS OF A RETALIATION CLAIM\n\nA retaliation claim challenging action taken because of EEO-related activity has three elements:\n\n(1) protected activity: \"participation\" in an EEO process or \"opposition\" to discrimination;[15]\n\n(2) materially adverse action taken by the employer; and\n\n(3) requisite level of causal connection between the protected activity and the materially adverse action.\n\nA. Protected Activity\n\nThe first question when analyzing a claim that a materially adverse action was retaliatory is whether there was an earlier complaint or other EEO activity that is protected by the law (known as \"protected activity\"). Protected activity includes \"participating\" in an EEO process or \"opposing\" discrimination. These two types of protected activity arise directly from two distinct statutory retaliation clauses that differ in scope. Participation in an EEO process is more narrowly defined to refer specifically to raising a claim, testifying, assisting or participating in any manner in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under the EEO laws, but it is very broadly protected. By contrast, opposition activity encompasses a broader range of activity by which an individual opposes any practice made unlawful by the EEO statutes. The protection for opposition is limited, however, to those individuals who act with a reasonable good faith belief that a potential EEO violation exists and who act in a reasonable manner to oppose it.\n\n1. Participation\n\nThe anti-retaliation provisions make it unlawful to discriminate because an individual has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under Title VII, the ADEA, the EPA, the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, or GINA. This language, known as the \"participation clause,\" provides protection from retaliation for many actions, including filing or serving as a witness for any side in an administrative proceeding or lawsuit alleging discrimination in violation of an EEO law.[16] The participation clause applies even if the underlying allegation is not meritorious or was not timely filed.[17]\n\nThe Commission has long taken the position that the participation clause broadly protects EEO participation regardless of whether an individual has a reasonable, good faith belief that the underlying allegations are, or could become, unlawful conduct.[18] Although the Supreme Court has not addressed this question, the participation clause by its terms contains no limiting language, and protects from retaliation employees' participation in a complaint, investigation, or adjudication process.[19] In contrast to the opposition clause, which protects opposition to practices \"made . . . unlawful\" by the statute, and therefore requires a reasonable good faith belief that conduct potentially violates the law, the participation clause protects participating \"in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing\" under the statute. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). As one appellate court explained, \"[r]eading a reasonableness test into section 704(a)'s participation clause would do violence to the text of that provision and would undermine the objectives of Title VII.\"[20]\n\nThe Supreme Court has reasoned that broad participation protection is necessary to achieve the primary statutory purpose of anti-retaliation provisions, which is \"maintaining unfettered access to statutory remedial mechanisms.\"[21] The application of the participation clause cannot depend on the substance of testimony because, \"[i]f a witness in [an EEO] proceeding were secure from retaliation only when her testimony met some slippery reasonableness standard, she would surely be less than forth-coming.\"[22] These protections ensure that individuals are not intimidated into forgoing the complaint process, and that those investigating and adjudicating EEO allegations can obtain witnesses' unchilled testimony.[23] It also avoids pre-judging the merits of a given allegation. For these reasons, the Commission disagrees with decisions holding to the contrary.[24]\n\nThis does not mean that bad faith actions taken in the course of participation are without consequence. False or bad faith statements by either the employee or the employer should be taken into appropriate account by the factfinder, investigator, or adjudicator of the EEO allegation when weighing credibility, ruling on procedural matters, deciding on the scope of the factfinding process, and deciding if the claim has merit. It is the Commission's position, however, that an employer can be liable for retaliation if it takes it upon itself to impose consequences for actions taken in the course of participation.\n\nAlthough courts often limit the participation clause to administrative charges or lawsuits filed to enforce rights under an EEO statute, and instead characterize EEO complaints made internally (e.g., to a company manager or human resources department) as \"opposition,\"[25] the Supreme Court in Crawford v. Metropolitan Government of Nashville & Davidson County explicitly left open the question of whether internal EEO complaints might be considered \"participation\" as well.[26] The Commission and the Solicitor General have long taken the view that participation and opposition have some overlap, in that raising complaints, serving as a voluntary or involuntary witness, or otherwise participating in an employer's internal complaint or investigation process, whether before or after an EEOC or Fair Employment Practices Agency (FEPA) charge has been filed, is covered under the broad protections of the participation clause, although it is also covered as \"opposition.\"[27] The plain terms of the participation clause prohibit retaliation against those who \"participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing\" under the statute. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a) (emphasis added). As courts have observed, these statutory terms are broad, unqualified, and not expressly limited to investigations conducted by the EEOC.[28] Similarly, contacting a federal agency employer's internal EEO Counselor under 29 C.F.R. § 1614.105 to allege discrimination is participation.[29]\n\nThis application of the participation clause is supported by the Supreme Court's decisions in Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775 (1998) and Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742 (1998), which created an affirmative defense to discriminatory harassment liability based on the availability and proper functioning of internal complaint and investigation processes. The adoption of such policies or the fact that an employee unreasonably failed to utilize them governs liability for various types of harassment claims. An effective process necessitates that employees be willing to participate, whether by providing information that is pro-employer, pro-employee, or neutral . Such participation enables an employer to take prompt corrective action where needed, and may later shield the employer from liability under the EEO laws.[30] It follows that participation in such complaint and investigation processes is participation in an \"investigation\" or \"proceeding\" within the meaning and interpretation of the statute.\n\n2. Opposition\n\nThe EEO anti-retaliation provisions also make it unlawful to retaliate against an individual for opposing any practice made unlawful under the employment discrimination statutes.[31] Depending on the facts, the same conduct may qualify for protection as both \"participation\" and \"opposition.\" However, the opposition clause protects a broader range of conduct than the participation clause.\n\na. Expansive Definition\n\nThe opposition clause of Title VII has an \"expansive definition,\" and \"great deference\" is given to the EEOC's interpretation of opposing conduct.[32] As the Supreme Court stated in Crawford v. Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County, \"'[w]hen an employee communicates to her employer a belief that the employer has engaged in . . . a form of employment discrimination, that communication' virtually always 'constitutes the employee's opposition to the activity.'\"[33] For example, accompanying a coworker to the human resources office in order to file an internal EEO complaint,[34] or complaining to management about discrimination against oneself or coworkers, likely constitutes protected activity.[35] Opposition includes situations where \"an employee [takes] a stand against an employer's discriminatory practices not by 'instigating' action, but by standing pat, say by refusing to follow a supervisor's order to fire a junior worker for discriminatory reasons.\"[36] It is also opposition when an employee who did not initiate a complaint answers an employer's questions about potential discrimination.[37]\n\nThe opposition clause applies if an individual explicitly or implicitly communicates his or her belief that the matter complained of is, or could become, harassment or other discrimination.[38] The communication itself may be informal and need not include the words \"harassment,\" \"discrimination,\" or any other legal terminology, as long as circumstances show that the individual is conveying opposition or resistance to a perceived potential EEO violation.[39] Individuals may make broad or ambiguous complaints of unfair treatment, in some instances because they may not know the specific requirements of the anti-discrimination laws. Such communication is protected opposition if the complaint would reasonably have been interpreted as opposition to employment discrimination.\n\nAlthough the opposition clause applies broadly, it does not protect every protest against perceived job discrimination. The following principles apply.\n\nb. Manner of Opposition Must Be Reasonable\n\nCourts and the Commission balance the right to oppose employment discrimination against the employer's need to have a stable and productive work environment. For this reason, the protection of the opposition clause only applies where the manner of opposition is reasonable.\n\nComplaints to Someone Other Than Employer. \"Courts have not limited the scope of the opposition clause to complaints made to the employer; complaints about the employer to others that the employer learns about can be protected opposition.\"[40] Although opposition typically involves complaints to managers,[41] it may be a reasonable manner of opposition to inform others of alleged discrimination, including union officials, coworkers, an attorney, or others outside the company.[42] For instance, it is protected opposition for an employee to contact the police seeking criminal prosecution of a coworker who engaged in a workplace assault motivated by disability, race, or sex, even though it is not a complaint to a manager or to a government agency that enforces EEO laws.[43]\n\nComplaints Raised Publicly. Depending on the circumstances, calling public attention to alleged discrimination may constitute reasonable opposition, provided that it is connected to an alleged violation of the EEO laws.[44] Opposition may include even activities such as picketing.[45] It includes making informal or public protests against discrimination, \"including . . . writing critical letters to customers, protesting against discrimination by industry or society in general, and expressing support of coworkers who have filed formal charges,\"[46] provided that it is not done in so disruptive or excessive a manner as to be unreasonable.[47] Moreover, going outside a chain of command or prescribed internal complaint procedure in order to bring forth discrimination allegations may be reasonable.[48]\n\nAdvising Employer of Intent to File, or Complaining Before Matter is Actionable. It is also a reasonable manner of opposition for an employee candidly to tell the employer of her intention to file a charge with the EEOC or a complaint with a state or local FEPA, union, court, employer's human resources department, higher-level manager, or company CEO. For example, where an employee intends to file an EEOC charge challenging a disparity in pay with a male coworker as sex discrimination, disclosing this to her manager would be protected opposition.[49] Moreover, it is reasonable opposition for an employee to inform the employer about alleged or potential discrimination or harassment, even if the alleged harassment has not yet risen to the level of a \"severe or pervasive\" hostile work environment.[50]\n\nExamples of Unreasonable Manner of Opposition. On the other hand, it is not reasonable opposition if an employee, for example, makes an overwhelming number of patently specious complaints,[51] or badgers a subordinate employee to give a witness statement in support of an EEOC charge and attempts to coerce her to change that statement.[52] The activity also will not be considered reasonable if it involves an unlawful act, such as committing or threatening violence to life or property. These examples are not exhaustive; whether the manner of opposition is unreasonable is a context- and fact-specific inquiry.\n\nOpposition to perceived discrimination also does not serve as license for the employee to neglect job duties. If an employee's protests render the employee ineffective in the job, the retaliation provisions do not immunize the employee from appropriate discipline or discharge.[53]\n\nc. Opposition May Be Based on Reasonable Good Faith Belief, Even if Conduct Opposed Is Ultimately Deemed Lawful\n\nAs with participation, a retaliation claim based on opposition is not defeated merely because the underlying challenged practice ultimately is found to be lawful.[54] For statements or actions to be protected opposition, however, they must be based on a reasonable good faith belief that the conduct opposed violates the EEO laws, or could do so if repeated.[55] Because there is conduct that falls short of an actual violation but could be reasonably perceived to violate Title VII, the reasonable belief standard can apply to protect complainants as well as witnesses or bystanders who intervene or report what was observed.[56]\n\nApplying the reasonable belief standard for opposition to alleged harassment in Clark County School District v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268 (2001) (per curiam), the Supreme Court held that, on the particular facts of the case, no reasonable person could have believed that a male, serving with plaintiff on a hiring panel screening job applicants, had engaged in potential unlawful harassment when he, on one occasion, read aloud a job applicant's description of sexual conduct, stated that he did not know what it meant, and then laughed when another male employee said, \"I'll tell you later.\" The Court in Breeden noted: \"The ordinary terms and conditions of the [plaintiff's] job required her to review the sexually explicit statement in the course of screening job applicants. Her coworkers who participated in the hiring process were subject to the same requirement,\" and the plaintiff \"conceded that it did not bother or upset her\" to read the statement in the application. Accordingly, the Court held that the plaintiff's complaints about the incident did not constitute protected opposition, and she could not maintain a retaliation claim under Title VII.[57]\n\nBreeden did not alter the well-established observation that \"[c]omplaining about alleged sexual harassment to company management is classic opposition activity.\"[58] Indeed, the hostile work environment liability standard is predicated on encouraging employees to \"report harassing conduct before it becomes severe or pervasive.\"[59] In Faragher, 524 U.S. 775, and Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, the Supreme Court created an affirmative defense to discriminatory harassment liability based in part on an employee's failure \"to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer.\"[60] It is well-recognized that \"the victim is compelled by the Faragher/Ellerth defense to make an internal complaint.\"[61]\n\nIf an employee's internal complaint were not protected, therefore, an employee would be in a catch-22: either complain to the employer about offensive conduct experienced or witnessed before it becomes severe or pervasive (taking the risk that the employer would be permitted to fire her for complaining), or wait to complain until the harassment is so severe or pervasive that she is certain she will be protected from retaliation (taking the risk of further harm, and that her failure to complain sooner will relieve the employer of liability even if a court later finds there was a hostile work environment). Under Faragher and Ellerth, \"the victim is commanded to 'report the misconduct, not investigate, gather evidence, and then approach company officials.'\"[62]\n\nTherefore, even reporting an isolated single incident of harassment is protected opposition if the employee \"reasonably believes that a hostile work environment is in progress, with no requirement for additional evidence that a plan is in motion to create such an environment or that such an environment is likely to occur.\"[63] Likewise, it is protected opposition if the employee complains about offensive conduct that, if repeated often enough, would result in an actionable hostile work environment.[64]\n\nIt is reasonable for an employee to believe conduct violates the EEO laws if the Commission, as the primary agency charged with enforcement, has adopted that interpretation.[65]\n\nd. Who Is Protected from Retaliation for Opposition?\n\nIn the Commission's view, all employees who engage in opposition activity are protected from retaliation, even if they are managers, human resources personnel, or other EEO advisors.[67] The statutory purpose of the opposition clause is promoted by protecting all communications about potential EEO violations by the very officials most likely to discover, investigate, and report them; otherwise, there would be a disincentive for them to do so.[68]\n\nA managerial employee with a duty to report or investigate discrimination still must satisfy the same requirements as any other employee alleging retaliation under the opposition clause - meeting the definition of \"opposition,\" using a manner of opposition that is reasonable, and having a reasonable good faith belief that the opposed practice is unlawful (or would be if repeated), as well as proving a materially adverse action, the requisite causation, and liability.[69]\n\ne. Examples of Opposition\n\nComplaining or threatening to complain about alleged discrimination against oneself or others[70]\n\nProviding information in an employer's internal investigation of an EEO matter\n\nRefusing to obey an order reasonably believed to be discriminatory\n\nRefusing to obey an order constitutes protected opposition if the individual reasonably believes that the order requires him or her to carry out unlawful employment discrimination. Protected opposition also includes refusal to implement a discriminatory policy.[72]\n\nAdvising an employer on EEO compliance\n\nResisting sexual advances or intervening to protect others\n\nPassive resistance\n\nPassive opposition refers to certain acts that allow others to express opposition, such as refusing to implement an instruction to interfere with other employees' complaints. Such an action may itself be protected under the opposition clause.\n\nRequesting reasonable accommodation for disability or religion\n\nA request for reasonable accommodation of a disability constitutes protected activity under the ADA, and therefore retaliation for such requests is unlawful.[77] By the same rationale, persons requesting religious accommodation under Title VII are protected against retaliation for making such requests.[78] Although a person making such a request might not literally \"oppose\" discrimination or \"participate\" in a complaint process, the individual is protected against retaliation for making the request. One court explained: \"It would seem anomalous . . . to think Congress intended no retaliation protection for employees who request a reasonable accommodation unless they also file a formal charge. This would leave employees unprotected if an employer granted the accommodation and shortly thereafter terminated the employee in retaliation.\"[79]\n\nf. Inquiries and Other Discussions Related to Compensation\n\nTaking adverse action for discussing compensation may implicate the EEO anti-retaliation protections as well as a number of other federal laws, some examples of which follow in order to illustrate how related authorities apply. Additional protections exist under various state laws.[80]\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Labor, approximately 60% of private sector workers surveyed nationally reported that they were either contractually forbidden or strongly discouraged by management from discussing their pay with their colleagues.[81] Although most private employers are under no obligation to make wage information public, actions taken by an employer to prohibit employees from discussing their compensation with one another may impede knowledge of discrimination and deter protected activity, whether pursuant to a so-called \"pay secrecy\" policy or other employer action.\n\n(1) Compensation Discussions as Opposition Under the EEO Laws\n\nWhen an employee communicates to management or coworkers to complain or ask about compensation, or otherwise discusses rates of pay, the communication may constitute protected opposition under the EEO laws, making employer retaliation actionable based upon the facts of a given case. For example, talking to coworkers to gather information or evidence in support of a potential EEO claim is protected opposition, provided the manner of opposition is reasonable.[82]\n\n(2) Related Protections Under Other Federal Authorities\n\nIn addition to the retaliation provisions of the laws enforced by the EEOC, there are also various other federal protections for discussions related to compensation that apply to certain employers. Two examples include Executive Order (E.O.) 11246 and the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).\n\na. Executive Order 11246, as amended - Federal Contractors and Subcontractors\n\nUnder E.O. 11246, as amended by E.O. 13665 (April 8, 2014), federal contractors and subcontractors are prohibited from discharging or otherwise discriminating in any way against employees or applicants who inquire about, discuss, or disclose their compensation or that of other employees or applicants.[84] This nondiscrimination requirement protects any compensation inquiries, discussions, or disclosures. Neither opposition to alleged discrimination nor participation in EEO activity is a necessary element of a pay transparency violation of E.O. 11246. Rather, the pay transparency provisions protect even simple inquiries between coworkers about their compensation, and generally prohibit contractors from having policies that prohibit or tend to restrict employees or applicants from discussing or disclosing compensation.[85]\n\nThe Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) at the U.S. Department of Labor enforces E.O. 11246 and has issued regulations implementing the pay transparency provisions of E.O. 13665, which became effective on January 11, 2016.[86] Though their protection is broad, the regulations contain two specific contractor defenses to a claim of pay transparency discrimination. A contractor may show that it disciplined the employee for violating a uniformly applied rule, policy, practice, or agreement that does not prohibit or tend to prohibit applicants or employees from discussing or disclosing compensation. A contractor may also show that it disciplined an employee because the employee (a) had access to the compensation information of other employees or applicants as part of his or her essential job duties, and (b) disclosed such information to individuals who did not otherwise have access to it, unless the employee was discussing his or her own compensation, or unless the disclosure occurred in certain specified circumstances.[87]\n\nb. National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)\n\nThe NLRA protects non-supervisory employees who are covered by that law from employer retaliation when they discuss their wages or working conditions with their colleagues as part of a concerted activity, even if there is no union or other formal organization involved in the effort.[88] The NLRA prohibits employers from discriminating against employees and job applicants who discuss or disclose their own compensation or the compensation of other employees or applicants. The NLRA protection, however, does not extend to supervisors, managers, agricultural workers, and employees of rail and air carriers. More information about the scope of the NLRA protections, charge filing, and compliance and enforcement can be found on the National Labor Relations Board's website at https://www.nlrb.gov.\n\n3. Range of Individuals Who Engage in Protected Activity\n\nAs the above discussion illustrates, protected activity can take many forms. Individuals who engage in protected activity include:\n\nthose who participate in the EEO process in any way, including as a complainant, representative, or witness for any side, regardless of their job duties or managerial status;[89]\n\nthose who oppose discrimination on behalf of themselves or others,[90] even if their underlying discrimination allegation ultimately is not successful ;[91]\n\nthose who tell their employer of their intention to file a charge or lawsuit, even if the filing is not ultimately made ;[92]\n\nthose whose protected activity involved a different employer (e.g., an applicant who is not hired because she filed an ADA charge against her former employer for failure to provide a sign language interpreter, or because she opposed her previous employer's exclusion of qualified applicants with hearing impairments);[93]\n\nthose whose protected activity occurred while they were still employed but who are not retaliated against until later, after the employment relationship ends[94] (e.g., when a former employer retaliates by giving an unjustified, untruthful negative job reference, by refusing to provide a job reference, or by informing an individual's prospective employer about the individual's prior EEO complaint);[95]\n\nthose who raise discrimination allegations but are not covered by the substantive provisions of the applicable discrimination laws (e.g., retaliation against an individual for filing a disability discrimination charge, even if it is ultimately determined that she is not qualified for the position held or desired,[96] or retaliation against an individual for raising an age discrimination allegation, even if he is not age 40 or over);[97] and\n\nthose whose protected activity relates to any provision of the ADA, not just the employment discrimination title of the statute (e.g., opposition to disability discrimination in state and local government services, public accommodations, commercial facilities, or telecommunications).[98]\n\nIn addition, those whom an employer mistakenly believes have engaged in protected activity are protected from retaliation.[99] See also infra § II.B.4. (Third Party Retaliation).\n\nB. Materially Adverse Action\n\n1. General Rule\n\nThe anti-retaliation provisions make it unlawful to take a materially adverse action against an individual because of protected activity. The Supreme Court held in Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53 (2006), that a \"materially adverse action\" subject to challenge under the anti-retaliation provisions encompasses a broader range of actions than an \"adverse action\" subject to challenge under the non-discrimination provisions.[100] In light of the purpose of anti-retaliation protection, it expansively covers any employer action that \"might well deter a reasonable employee from complaining about discrimination.\"[101] An action need not be materially adverse standing alone, as long as the employer's retaliatory conduct, considered as a whole, would deter protected activity.[102] Although \"normally petty slights, minor annoyances, and simple lack of good manners will not create such deterrence,\" the standard can be satisfied even if the individual was not in fact deterred.[103]\n\nThe Burlington Northern decision made clear that whether an action is reasonably likely to deter protected activity depends on the surrounding facts - although the standard is \"objective,\" it is phrased in \"general terms\" because the \"significance of any given act will often depend on the particular circumstances. Context matters.\"[104] An \"act that would be immaterial in some situations is material in others.\"[105] Indeed, the Supreme Court has held that transferring plaintiff to a harder, dirtier job within the same pay grade and job category and suspending her without pay for 37 days even though the lost pay was later reimbursed, were both \"materially adverse actions\" that could be challenged as retaliation.[106] Other examples of actionable retaliation cited by the Supreme Court include the FBI's refusing to investigate \"death threats\" against an agent, the filing of false criminal charges against a former employee, changing the work schedule of a parent who has caretaking responsibilities for school-age children, and excluding an employee from a weekly training lunch that contributes to professional advancement.[107]\n\nThis broad definition of \"materially adverse\" from Burlington Northern applies not only to private and state and local government employment, but also to federal sector employment under all the statutes enforced by the EEOC.[108]\n\n2. Types of Materially Adverse Actions\n\nWork-Related Actions. The most obvious types of adverse actions are denial of promotion, refusal to hire, denial of job benefits, demotion, suspension, and discharge.[109] Other types of adverse actions may include work-related threats,[110] warnings, reprimands,[111] transfers,[112] negative or lowered evaluations,[113] transfers to less prestigious or desirable work[114] or work locations,[115] and any other type of adverse treatment that in the circumstances might well dissuade a reasonable person from engaging in protected activity. For example, as one appellate court observed, \"[a] formal reprimand issued by an employer is not a 'petty slight,' 'minor annoyance,' or 'trivial' punishment; it can reduce an employee's likelihood of receiving future bonuses, raises, and promotions, and it may lead the employee to believe (correctly or not) that his job is in jeopardy.\"[116] Another court of appeals reasoned that the same can be said of lowered performance appraisals:\n\nIf the Supreme Court views excluding an employee from a weekly training lunch that contributes significantly to the employee's professional development as materially adverse conduct, see Burlington [Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 69 (2006)], then markedly lower performance-evaluation scores that significantly impact an employee's wages or professional advancement are also materially adverse.[117]\n\nActions That Are Not Work-Related. A materially adverse action may also be an action that has no tangible effect on employment, or even an action that takes place exclusively outside of work, as long as it might well dissuade a reasonable person from engaging in protected activity. Prohibiting only employment-related actions would not achieve the goal of avoiding retaliation because \"an employer can effectively retaliate against an employee by taking actions not directly related to his employment or by causing him harm outside the workplace.\"[118] The Supreme Court in Burlington Northern observed that, although the substantive anti-discrimination provisions seek elimination of discrimination that affects employment opportunities because of employees' racial, ethnic, or other protected status, the anti-retaliation provisions seek to secure that objective by preventing an employer from interfering in a materially adverse way with efforts to enforce the law's basic guarantees.[119]\n\nAdditional Examples. Other examples of materially adverse actions may include:\n\ndisparaging the person to others or in the media;[120]\n\nmaking false reports to government authorities;[121]\n\nfiling a civil action;[122]\n\nthreatening reassignment;\n\nscrutinizing work or attendance more closely than that of other employees, without justification;\n\nremoval of supervisory responsibilities;[123]\n\nabusive verbal or physical behavior that is reasonably likely to deter protected activity, even if it is not sufficiently \"severe or pervasive\" to create a hostile work environment;\n\nrequiring re-verification of work status, making threats of deportation, or initiating other action with immigration authorities because of protected activity;[124]\n\nterminating a union grievance process or other action to block access to otherwise available remedial mechanisms;[125]\n\ntaking (or threatening to take) a materially adverse action against a close family member (who could bring a claim as an aggrieved individual in addition to the person who engaged in protected activity);[126] and\n\nany other action that might well deter reasonable individuals from engaging in protected activity.[127]\n\nA fact-driven analysis applies to determine if the challenged employer action(s) in question would be likely to deter participation or opposition. To the extent some lower courts applying Burlington Northern have found that some of the above-listed actions can never be significant enough to deter protected activity, the Commission concludes that such a categorical view is contrary to the context-specific analysis, broad reasoning, and specific examples endorsed by the Supreme Court.\n\nMatters are not actionable as retaliation if they are not likely to dissuade an employee from engaging in protected activity in the circumstances. For example, courts have concluded on the facts of given cases that a temporary transfer from an office to a cubicle consistent with office policy was not a materially adverse action[128] and that occasional brief delays by an employer in issuing refund checks to an employee that involved small amounts of money were not materially adverse.[129] Such actions were not deemed likely to deter protected activity, as distinguished from the transfer to harder work, the exclusion from a weekly training lunch, or the unfavorable schedule change described by the Supreme Court in Burlington Northern as materially adverse.\n\nIf the employer's action would be reasonably likely to deter protected activity, it can be challenged as retaliation even if it falls short of its goal.[130] The degree of harm suffered by the individual \"goes to the issue of damages, not liability.\"[131] Regardless of the degree or quality of harm to the particular complainant, retaliation harms the public interest by deterring others from filing charges.[132] An interpretation of Title VII that permits some forms of retaliation to go unpunished would undermine the effectiveness of the EEO statutes and conflict with the language and purpose of the anti-retaliation provisions.\n\nDetermining whether an action is reasonably likely to deter protected activity under Burlington Northern is fact-dependent.\n\n3. Harassing Conduct as Retaliation\n\nSometimes retaliatory conduct is characterized as \"retaliatory harassment.\" The threshold for establishing retaliatory harassment is different than for discriminatory hostile work environment. Retaliatory harassing conduct can be challenged under the Burlington Northern standard even if it is not severe or pervasive enough to alter the terms and conditions of employment.[137] If the conduct would be sufficiently material to deter protected activity in the given context, even if it were insufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment, there would be actionable retaliation.\n\n4. Third Party Retaliation- Person Claiming Retaliation Need Not Be the Person Who Engaged in Opposition\n\na. Materially Adverse Action Against Employee\n\nSometimes an employer takes a materially adverse action against an employee who engaged in protected activity by harming a third party who is closely related to or associated with the complaining employee.[138] For example, the Supreme Court explained that it is \"obvious that a reasonable worker might be dissuaded from engaging in protected activity if she knew that her fiancé would be fired.\"[139] Similarly, if an employer punishes an employee for engaging in protected activity by cancelling a vendor contract with the employee's husband (even though he was employed by a contractor, not the employer), it would dissuade a reasonable worker from engaging in protected activity.[140] Although there is no \"fixed class of relationships for which third-party reprisals are unlawful[,] . . . firing a close family member will almost always meet the Burlington standard, and inflicting a milder reprisal on a mere acquaintance will almost never do so.\"[141]\n\nb. Standing to Challenge: \"Zone of Interests\"\n\nWhere there is actionable third party retaliation, both the employee who engaged in the protected activity and the third party who is subjected to the materially adverse action may state a claim. The third party may bring a claim even if he did not engage in the protected activity, and even if he has never been employed by the defendant employer. \"Regardless of whether the plaintiffs are employed by the defendant, . . . the harm they suffered is no less a product of the defendant's purposeful violation of the anti-retaliation provision.\"[142] As the Supreme Court stated, the third party was not an \"accidental victim\"; \"[t]o the contrary, injuring him was the employer's intended means of harming the [employee who engaged in protected activity].\"[143] Thus, the third party \"falls within the 'zone of interests' sought to be protected by [the retaliation provision]\" and has standing to seek recovery from the employer for his harm.[144]\n\nC. Causal Connection\n\n1. Causation Standards\n\nUnlawful retaliation is established when a causal connection is established between a materially adverse action and the individual's protected activity. The retaliatory animus need not necessarily be held by the employer's official who took the materially adverse action; an employer still may be vicariously liable if one of its agents, motivated by discriminatory or retaliatory animus, intentionally and proximately caused the official to take the action.[145] A retaliation claim will not succeed absent enough evidence to prove retaliation under the applicable causation standard.\n\na. \"But-For\" Causation Standard for Retaliation Claims Against Private Sector and State and Local Government Employers\n\nIn private sector and state and local government retaliation cases under the statutes the EEOC enforces, the causation standard requires the evidence to show that \"but for\" a retaliatory motive, the employer would not have taken the adverse action, as set forth by the Supreme Court in University of Texas Southwest Medical Center v. Nassar.[146] By contrast, the \"motivating factor\" causation standard for discrimination claims can be met even if the employer would have taken the same action absent a discriminatory motive.[147]\n\nThe \"but-for\" causation standard does not require that retaliation be the \"sole cause\" of the action. There can be multiple \"but-for\" causes, and retaliation need only be \"a but-for\" cause of the materially adverse action in order for the employee to prevail.[148]The Supreme Court has explained how \"but-for\" causation can be demonstrated even if multiple causes exist:\n\n\"[W]here A shoots B, who is hit and dies, we can say that A [actually] caused B's death, since but for A's conduct B would not have died.\" LaFave 467-468 (italics omitted). The same conclusion follows if the predicate act combines with other factors to produce the result, so long as the other factors alone would not have done so-if, so to speak, it was the straw that broke the camel's back. Thus, if poison is administered to a man debilitated by multiple diseases, it is a but-for cause of his death even if those diseases played a part in his demise, so long as, without the incremental effect of the poison, he would have lived.[149]\n\nb. \"Motivating Factor\" Causation Standard for Title VII and ADEA Retaliation Claims Against Federal Sector Employers\n\nBy contrast, in federal sector Title VII and ADEA retaliation cases, the Commission has held that the \"but-for\" standard does not apply because the relevant federal sector statutory provisions do not employ the same language on which the Court based its holding in Nassar.[150] The federal sector provisions contain a \"broad prohibition of 'discrimination' rather than a list of specific prohibited practices,\" requiring that employment \"be made free from any discrimination,\" including retaliation. Therefore, in Title VII and ADEA cases against a federal employer, retaliation is prohibited if it was a motivating factor.[151]\n\n2. Evidence of Causation\n\nIn order for the employee to prevail in demonstrating a violation, the evidence must show that it is more likely than not that retaliation has occurred. It is not the employer's burden to disprove the claim.[152]\n\nThere are instances in which the evidence demonstrates that the employer acknowledges or betrays a retaliatory motive for its materially adverse action, orally or in writing.[153] In many cases, however, the employer proffers a non-retaliatory reason for the challenged action. For example, the employer may assert that it could not have been motivated by retaliation because it was not aware of the protected activity,[154] or that even if it was aware the employee made complaints, it did not know that they concerned discrimination.[155] Or, an employer may contend that it was not motivated by retaliation but by a legitimate unrelated reason, such as: poor job performance or misconduct;[156] inadequate qualifications for the position sought;[157] or, with regard to negative job references, truthfulness of the information in the reference.[158]\n\nThere may be proof that the employer's asserted non-retaliatory explanation is pretextual, such as evidence that the former employer routinely declines to offer information about its former employees' job performance but departed from that policy with regard to an individual who engaged in protected activity.[159] If an employer's proffered explanation is shown to be false, a factfinder may infer retaliation or alternatively may conclude that the falsehood was given for a different reason (e.g., to cover up embarrassing facts). This determination must be made based on the totality of the evidence.\n\n3. Examples of Facts That May Support Finding of Retaliation\n\nDifferent types or pieces of evidence, either alone or in combination, may be relevant to determine if the above causation standard has been met. In other words, different pieces of evidence, considered together, may allow an inference that the materially adverse action was retaliatory.[160]\n\nThe evidence may include, for example, suspicious timing, verbal or written statements, comparative evidence that a similarly situated employee was treated differently, falsity of the employer's proffered reason for the adverse action, or any other pieces of evidence which, when viewed together, may permit an inference of retaliatory intent.[161]\n\nSuspicious timing. The causal link between the adverse action and the protected activity is often established by evidence that the adverse action occurred shortly after the plaintiff engaged in protected activity.[162] However, temporal proximity is not necessary to establish a causal link.[163] Even when the time between the protected activity and the adverse action is lengthy, other evidence of retaliatory motive may establish the causal link.[164] For example, actions related to the continued processing of a complaint may remind an employer of its pendency or stoke an employer's animus. Moreover, an opportunity to engage in a retaliatory act may not arise right away. In these circumstances, a materially adverse action might occur long after the original protected activity occurs, and retaliatory motive is nevertheless proven.[165]\n\nOral or written statements. Oral or written statements made by the individuals recommending or approving the challenged adverse action may reveal retaliatory intent by expressing retaliatory animus or by revealing inconsistencies, pre-determined decisions, or other indications that the reasons given for the adverse action are false.[166] Such statements may have been made to the employee or to others.[167]\n\nComparative evidence. An inference that the adverse action was motivated by retaliation could also be supported by evidence that the employer treated more favorably a similarly situated employee who had not engaged in protected activity. For example, where a disciplinary action was taken for alleged retaliatory reasons, evidence of selective enforcement (i.e., that infraction regularly goes undisciplined in that workplace, or that another employee who committed the same infraction was not disciplined, or was not disciplined as severely) could be sufficient to infer retaliatory motive.[168] Similarly, absent evidence of new performance problems, a retaliatory motive might be inferred where an employee had higher performance appraisals prior to engaging in protected activity.[169]\n\nInconsistent or shifting explanations. If the employer changes its stated reason for the challenged adverse action over time or in different settings (e.g., reasons stated to employee in termination meeting differ from reasons employer cites in position statement filed with the EEOC), pretext may be inferred.[170] The inference of discrimination drawn from such changes, however, will be undermined to the extent the inconsistencies are innocuous or can be credibly explained by the employer (e.g., additional information is discovered).\n\nOther evidence that employer's explanation was pretextual. There may be other evidence that the employer's justification for the challenged action is not believable and that the explanation is a pretext to hide retaliation.[171]\n\n4. Examples of Facts That May Defeat a Claim of Retaliation\n\nEven if protected activity and a materially adverse action occurred, evidence of any of the following facts alone or in combination may be credited by the factfinder in a given case and, as a result, lead to the conclusion that the action was not in retaliation for the protected activity under the applicable causation standard.\n\nEmployer Unaware of Protected Activity. Retaliation cannot be shown without establishing that the employer (either the decisionmaker or someone who influenced the decisionmaker) knew of the prior protected activity.[172] Absent knowledge, there can be no retaliatory intent, and therefore no causal connection.[173]\n\nLegitimate Non-Retaliatory Reason for Challenged Action. An employer may proffer a legitimate non-retaliatory reason for the challenged action. Examples of non-retaliatory reasons include:\n\npoor performance;\n\ninadequate qualifications for position sought;\n\nqualifications, application, or interview performance inferior to the selectee;\n\nnegative job references;\n\nmisconduct (e.g., threats, insubordination, unexcused absences, employee dishonesty, abusive or threatening conduct, or theft); and\n\nreduction in force or other downsizing.\n\nThough the employer does not have the burden to disprove retaliation, the employer may have evidence supporting its proffered explanation for the challenged action, such as comparative evidence revealing like treatment of similarly situated individuals who did not engage in protected activity, or supporting documentary and/or witness testimony.\n\nEvidence of Retaliatory Motive But Adverse Action Would Have Happened Anyway. In a case where the \"but for\" standard applies, the claim will fail unless retaliation was a \"but-for\" cause of the adverse action. In other words, causation cannot be proven if the evidence shows that the challenged adverse action would have occurred anyway, even without a retaliatory motive.\n\nIII. ADA INTERFERENCE PROVISION\n\nIn addition to retaliation, the ADA prohibits \"interference\" with the exercise or enjoyment of ADA rights, or with the assistance of another in exercising or enjoying those rights.[175] The scope of the interference provision is broader than the anti-retaliation provision. It protects any individual who is subject to coercion, threats, intimidation, or interference with respect to ADA rights. 42 U.S.C. § 12203(b).[176] As with ADA retaliation, an applicant or employee need not establish that he is an \"individual with a disability\" or \"qualified\" in order to prove interference under the ADA\n\nThe statute, regulations, and court decisions have not separately defined the terms \"coerce,\" \"intimidate,\" \"threaten,\" and \"interfere.\" Rather, as a group, these terms have been interpreted to include at least certain types of actions which, whether or not they rise to the level of unlawful retaliation, are nevertheless actionable as interference.[177]\n\nOf course, many instances of employer threats or coercion might in and of themselves be actionable under the ADA as a denial of accommodation, discrimination, or retaliation, and many examples in this section could be actionable under those theories of liability as well. Because the \"interference\" provision is broader, however, it will reach even those instances when conduct does not meet the \"materially adverse\" standard required for retaliation. Examples of conduct by an employer prohibited under the ADA as interference would include:\n\ncoercing an individual to relinquish or forgo an accommodation to which he or she is otherwise entitled;\n\nintimidating an applicant from requesting accommodation for the application process by indicating that such a request will result in the applicant not being hired;\n\nthreatening an employee with loss of employment or other adverse treatment if he does not \"voluntarily\" submit to a medical examination or inquiry that is otherwise prohibited under the statute;\n\nissuing a policy or requirement that purports to limit an employee's rights to invoke ADA protections (e.g., a fixed leave policy that states \"no exceptions will be made for any reason\");\n\ninterfering with a former employee's right to file an ADA lawsuit against the former employer by stating that a negative job reference will be given to prospective employers if the suit is filed; and\n\nsubjecting an employee to unwarranted discipline, demotion, or other adverse treatment because he assisted a coworker in requesting reasonable accommodation.\n\nThe interference provision does not apply to any and all conduct or statements that an individual finds intimidating.[178] In the Commission's view, it only prohibits conduct that is reasonably likely to interfere with the exercise or enjoyment of ADA rights.[179]\n\nIV. REMEDIES\n\nA. Temporary or Preliminary Relief\n\nThe EEOC has the authority to seek temporary injunctive relief before final disposition of a charge when a preliminary investigation indicates that prompt judicial action is necessary to carry out the purposes of Title VII, and the ADA and GINA incorporate this provision.[180] Although the ADEA and the EPA do not authorize a court to give interim relief pending resolution of an EEOC charge, the EEOC can seek such relief as part of a lawsuit for permanent relief pursuant to Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nTemporary or preliminary relief allows a court to stop retaliation before it occurs or continues. Such relief is appropriate if there is a substantial likelihood that the challenged action will be found to constitute unlawful retaliation and if the charging party and/or the public interest will likely suffer irreparable harm because of the retaliation. Although courts have ruled that financial hardships are not irreparable, other harms that accompany loss of a job may be irreparable. For example, courts have held that forced retirees showed irreparable harm and qualified for a preliminary injunction where they lost work and future prospects for work, consequently suffering emotional distress, depression, a contracted social life, and other related harms.[181]\n\nA temporary injunction also is appropriate if the respondent's retaliation will likely cause irreparable harm to the Commission's ability to investigate the charging party's original charge of discrimination. For example, if the alleged retaliatory act might discourage others from providing testimony or from filing additional charges based on the same or other alleged unlawful acts, preliminary relief is justified.[183]\n\nB. Compensatory and Punitive Damages for Retaliation\n\nCompensatory and punitive damages are potentially available under the anti-retaliation provisions in accordance with the standards explained below. Note: punitive damages are only available against private employers, not against government entities.\n\n1. Title VII and GINA\n\nUnder the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 42 U.S.C. § 1981a, compensatory and punitive damages are available for a range of violations under Title VII, including retaliation. A cap on combined compensatory and punitive damages (excluding past monetary losses) ranges from $50,000 for employers with 15-100 employees, to $300,000 for employers with more than 500 employees. Section 207 of GINA incorporates all the same remedies available under Title VII. Punitive damages are available when a practice is undertaken \"with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(b)(1). Eligibility for punitive damages depends on the employer's state of mind, not on the \"egregiousness\" of the employer's misconduct.[185]\n\n2. ADEA and EPA\n\nCompensatory and punitive damages are available for retaliation claims brought under the ADEA and the EPA, even though such relief is not available for non-retaliation claims under those statutes.[186] Any compensatory and punitive damages obtained under the EPA and the ADEA are not subject to statutory caps.\n\n3. ADA and Rehabilitation Act\n\nTitle V of the ADA sets forth the retaliation and interference provisions but contains no remedy provision of its own. Among courts, there remains a split of authority regarding whether compensatory and punitive damages are available for retaliation or interference in violation of the ADA.[187] Although the Civil Rights Act of 1991's damages provision does not explicitly mention retaliation claims under the ADA, the Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice maintain that compensatory and punitive damages are available for retaliation or interference in violation of the ADA.[188] The ADA retaliation provision refers to 42 U.S.C. § 12117 for its remedy, which in turn adopts the remedies set forth in Title VII at 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5 and 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(a)(2). Moreover, the reference in the damages provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to the intentional discrimination provision of the ADA (section 102, 42 U.S.C. § 12112) must encompass retaliation as a form of intentional discrimination. Accordingly, availability of damages for ADA and Rehabilitation Act retaliation claims should be assessed under the standards applicable to Title VII.[189]\n\nC. Other Relief\n\nUnder all the statutes enforced by the EEOC, relief may also potentially include back pay if the retaliation resulted in termination, constructive discharge, or non-selection, as well as front pay or reinstatement. Equitable relief also frequently sought by the Commission includes changes in employer policies and procedures, managerial training, reporting to the Commission, and other measures designed to prevent violations and promote future compliance with the law.\n\nV. PROMISING PRACTICES\n\nAlthough each workplace is different, there are many different types of promising policy, training, and organizational changes that employers may wish to consider implementing in an effort to minimize the likelihood of retaliation violations.[190] The Commission uses the term \"promising practices\" here because these steps may help reduce the risk of violations. However, the Commission is aware there is not a single best approach for every workplace or circumstance.\n\nMoreover, adopting these practices does not insulate an employer from liability or damages for unlawful actions. Rather, meaningful implementation of these steps may help reduce the risk of violations, even where they are not legal requirements.\n\nA. Written Employer Policies\n\nEmployers should maintain a written, plain-language anti-retaliation policy, and provide practical guidance on the employer's expectations with user-friendly examples of what to do and not to do. The policy should include:\n\nexamples of retaliation that managers may not otherwise realize are actionable, including actions that would not be cognizable as discriminatory disparate treatment but are actionable as retaliation because they would likely deter a reasonable person from engaging in protected activity;\n\nproactive steps for avoiding actual or perceived retaliation, including practical guidance on interactions by managers and supervisors with employees who have lodged discrimination allegations against them;\n\na reporting mechanism for employee concerns about retaliation, including access to a mechanism for informal resolution; and\n\na clear explanation that retaliation can be subject to discipline, up to and including termination.\n\nEmployers should consider any necessary revisions to eliminate punitive formal or informal policies that may deter employees from engaging in protected activity, such as policies that would impose materially adverse actions for inquiring, disclosing, or otherwise discussing wages. Although most private employers are under no obligation to disclose or make wages public, actions that deter or punish employees with respect to pay inquiries or discussions may constitute retaliation under provisions in federal and/or state law. See supra § II-A.2.f. (Inquiries and Other Discussions Related to Compensation).\n\nB. Training\n\nEmployers should consider these ideas for training:\n\nTrain all managers, supervisors, and employees on the employer's written anti-retaliation policy.\n\nSend a message from top management that retaliation will not be tolerated, provide information on policies and procedures in several different formats, and hold periodic refresher training.\n\nTailor training to address any specific deficits in EEO knowledge and behavioral standards that have arisen in that particular workplace, ensuring that employees are aware of what conduct is protected activity and providing examples on how to avoid problematic situations that have actually manifested or might be likely to do so.\n\nOffer explicit instruction on alternative proactive, EEO-compliant ways these situations could have been handled. In particular, managers and supervisors may benefit from scenarios and advice for ensuring that discipline and performance evaluations of employees are motivated by legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons.\n\nEmphasize that those accused of EEO violations, and in particular managers and supervisors, should not act on feelings of revenge or retribution, although also acknowledge that those emotions may occur.\n\nInclude training for management and human resources staff regarding how to be responsive and proactive when employees do raise concerns about potential EEO violations, including basics such as asking for clarification and additional information to ensure that the question or concern raised is fully understood, consulting as needed with superiors to address the issues raised, and following up as soon as possible with the employee who raised the concern.\n\nDo not limit training to those who work in offices. Provide EEO compliance and anti-retaliation training for those working in a range of workplace settings, including for example employees and supervisors in lower-wage manufacturing and service industries, manual laborers, and farm workers.\n\nConsider overall efforts to encourage a respectful workplace, which some social scientists have suggested may help curb retaliatory behavior.\n\nC. Anti-Retaliation Advice and Individualized Support for Employees, Managers, and Supervisors\n\nAn automatic part of an employer's response and investigation following EEO allegations should be to provide information to all parties and witnesses regarding the anti-retaliation policy, how to report alleged retaliation, and how to avoid engaging in it. As part of this debriefing, managers and supervisors alleged to have engaged in discrimination should be provided with guidance on how to handle any personal feelings about the allegations when carrying out management duties or interacting in the workplace.\n\nProvide tips for avoiding actual or perceived retaliation, as well as access to a resource individual for advice and counsel on managing the situation. This may occur as part of the standard debriefing of a manager, supervisor, or witness immediately following an allegation having been made, ensuring that those alleged to have discriminated receive prompt advice from a human resources, EEO, or other designated manager or specialist, both to air any concerns or resentments about the situation and to assist with strategies for avoiding actual or perceived retaliation going forward.\n\nD. Proactive Follow-Up\n\nEmployers may wish to check in with employees, managers, and witnesses during the pendency of an EEO matter to inquire if there are any concerns regarding potential or perceived retaliation, and to provide guidance. This provides an opportunity to identify issues before they fester, and to reassure employees and witnesses of the employer's commitment to protect against retaliation. It also provides an opportunity to give ongoing support and advice to those managers and supervisors who may be named in discrimination matters that are pending over a long period of time prior to reaching a final resolution.\n\nE. Review of Employment Actions to Ensure EEO Compliance\n\nConsider ensuring that a human resources or EEO specialist, a designated management official, in-house counsel, or other resource individual reviews proposed employment actions of consequence to ensure they are based on legitimate non-discriminatory, non-retaliatory reasons. These reviewers should:\n\nrequire decisionmakers to identify their reasons for taking consequential actions, and ensure that necessary documentation supports the decision;\n\nscrutinize performance assessments to ensure they have a sound factual basis and are free from unlawful motivations, and emphasize the need for consistency to managers;\n\nwhere retaliation is found to have occurred, identify and implement any process changes that may be useful; and\n\nreview any available data or other resources to determine if there are particular organizational components with compliance deficiencies, identify causes, and implement responsive training, oversight, or other changes to address the weaknesses identified."
