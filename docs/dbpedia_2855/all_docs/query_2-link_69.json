        "text": "Protected leave means that you can take time off from work for certain reasons without having to worry about losing your job or being demoted. OFLA gives you the ability to take time off to care for yourself or your family for a certain amount of time. You get to continue any group health care coverage you have prior to taking leave, and your employer must return you to your job when you return from leave. In addition, OFLA also prohibits discrimination or retaliation against an individual with respect to hire or tenure or any other term or condition of employment because they have inquired about, submitted a request for family leave, or invoked any provision of OFLA.\n\nAre there other laws that provide protected family leave?\n\nYes! The Oregon sick leave law allows all employees to earn and use up to at least 40 hours of protected time to take care of themself or a family member who is sick, injured, experiencing mental illness, or needs to visit the doctor, among other qualifying reasons, including all OFLA-qualifying reasons. Employers with 10 or more employees (6 or more if they have a location in Portland) must provide sick time with pay. Employers that do not frontload at least 40 hours each year must allow accrual of at least 1 hour of sick time for every 30 hours worked.\n\nOf course, the most recent leave law created Paid Leave Oregon. The Paid Leave Oregon program provides most Oregon employees with paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child, a serious illness (your own or that of a family member) or if you experience sexual assault, domestic violence, harassment, bias or stalking.\n\nIn addition to OFLA, the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides up to 12 weeks of family leave. Though FMLA does not cover sick child leave or bereavement, FMLA does provide protected leave for the serious health condition of the employee or a specific set of family members (mostly limited to parents, spouses, children and those who are or were in an in loco parentis relationship). FMLA also provides military caregiver leave (to care for a seriously ill or wounded servicemember, or veteran within 5 years of separation from service, if they became ill or wounded on active duty in the line of duty), which is also available to the next of kin of the servicemember in addition to parents, spouses and children). Finally, FMLA provides leave for a “qualifying exigency” arising out of the fact that the employee’s spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a covered military member on “covered active duty.” For details see US DOL’s factsheet.\n\nThe Oregon Military Family Leave Act (OMFLA) provides up to 14 days of protected leave per deployment to an employee who is the spouse or domestic partner of a service member (of the US Armed Forces, the National Guard or US military reserve forces) who has been notified of an impending call or order to active duty or who has been deployed. OMFLA leave counts against an employee’s OFLA entitlement, but it remains available even if all OFLA leave has been exhausted. (Note that OMFLA eligibility requires employees work an average of just 20 hours per week rather than 25 with no minimum length of employment so an employee who is not eligible for OFLA leave may still be eligible for OMFLA leave.\n\nHow many weeks of OFLA leave can I take?\n\nOFLA provides up to 12 weeks for sick child leave and bereavement each leave year. Note that bereavement leave is limited to two weeks per family member and may not exceed a maximum of four of the 12 weeks in a given leave year.\n\nOFLA also provides up to 12 additional weeks for pregnancy disability for the employees own pregnancy. Employees need not exhaust one bank of leave in order to draw from the other.\n\nFinally, from July 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024, OFLA will also provide up to two additional weeks of leave to facilitate the legal processes required for placement of a foster child or adoption. (Paid Leave will incorporate this leave beginning 2025.)\n\nIf an employer grants family leave for a condition that is also a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (as amended) and Oregon disability law, is there any further accommodation required once the leave period has ended?\n\nVery likely. Employers must reasonably accommodate an employee’s disability if it does not create an undue hardship. If an employee’s family leave entitlement has been exhausted for a serious health condition that is also a disability, or if the employee returns from intermittent leave, the reasonable accommodation obligation remains. An example would be an employee who suffered permanent injuries to their back and, although able to return to work, needed special office furniture or equipment to allow them to perform the job after returning from family leave. Additional unpaid leave or an adjusted work schedule to accommodate therapy treatments may also be reasonable accommodations under the disability laws. The employer will be required to engage in a meaningful interactive process with the returning employee to identify potential accommodations, and they should document those efforts. Check out our disability accommodation toolkit for additional resources.\n\nWhich family members are covered by OFLA?\n\nPregnancy disability is available to an employee for an illness, injury or condition related to the employee’s own pregnancy or childbirth only.\n\nThe definition of a “family member” under OFLA for bereavement includes:\n\nA spouse or domestic partner;\n\nA child of a covered individual or the child's spouse or domestic partner;\n\nA parent of a covered individual or the parent's spouse or domestic partner;\n\nA sibling or stepsibling of a covered individual or the sibling's or stepsibling's spouse or domestic partner;\n\nA grandparent of a covered individual or the grandparent's spouse or domestic partner;\n\nA grandchild of a covered individual or the grandchild's spouse or domestic partner;\n\nAny individual related by blood or affinity whose close association with a covered individual is the equivalent of a family relationship.\n\nNote: For purposes of sick child leave, the child of the employee must be either under the age of 18 or an adult dependent child substantially limited by a physical or mental impairment.\n\nHow does the OFLA approval process work?\n\nOFLA is administered by employers.\n\nEmployers may generally require employees to give written notice of their need for leave — up to 30 days in advance. However, if the need for leave is unforeseen or an emergency, employers may require notice as soon as it is practicable and not later than 24 hours after beginning leave. Employers may also require written notice within three days of the employee's return to work.\n\nNote that Oregon's sick time law also provides leave for all OFLA-qualifying absences, including sick child leave for an employee with a child whose school or place of care is closed by order of a public official. Under sick time regulations, employers may only require up to ten days' advance notice to use sick leave if the leave is foreseeable, otherwise, as much notice as is practicable.\n\nMay employers require medical verification of the need for leave?\n\nWhere appropriate, yes. An employer may request medical verification for pregnancy disability and sick child leave (apart from sick child leave for school/childcare closures in connection with a public health emergency). For sick child leave, medical verification is limited to absences requested after an employee’s third day of sick child leave. For this purpose, a day of sick child leave occurs when the employee is absent for all or part of one day. Thus, on the fourth day, whether four continuous days or parts of four separate days, an employer may require verification of the need for sick child leave\n\nNote that Oregon's sick time law also provides leave for all OFLA-qualifying absences and does not permit medical verification until after the third consecutive day of use.\n\nThe employer must bear the out-of-pocket cost of medical verification unless a collectively bargained agreement or a state or federal statute or city or county ordinance provides otherwise.\n\nEmployers may not require second opinions.\n\nMust the employer tell the employee that time off is being designated as family leave?\n\nYes. Once an employer becomes aware of the need for leave, OFLA generally requires employers to provide notice that the employee is eligible within five days business days.\n\nSome exceptions apply. Employers may give the employee a written request for information to verify the need for OFLA leave, such as an affirmation that bereavement leave is for a family member, within five business days of becoming aware of the need for leave. Once the employer receives the requested information, they have five business days to inform the employee of their eligibility.\n\nIn the case of medical verification, an employer may request that the employee provide medical verification prior to beginning the leave when the need is foreseeable or within 15 days when the need for leave is not foreseeable. In that event, the employer may provisionally approve OFLA leave, pending medical verification.\n\nMay employees draw on paid leaves while taking OFLA?\n\nYes. While wage replacement benefits under Paid Leave Oregon must be taken separately from OFLA, other paid leaves, such as PTO or Vacation, are available to an employee taking OFLA.\n\nAn employee may take any available paid sick time during OFLA.\n\nAn employer may generally determine the order of use for any other paid leave banks available to the employee, unless a collectively bargained agreement or the company policy says otherwise.\n\nIf I am covered by multiple leave laws, which law applies?\n\nThat depends. If the reason for leave is covered by both Paid Leave Oregon and OFLA, say for pregnancy disability or caring for a child with a serious health condition, the employee may decide to apply for either leave. They cannot be taken at the same time. Whether requesting OFLA or submitting a claim for Paid Leave Oregon, the employee should tell their employer(s) about their upcoming need for leave. (Note that employers may provisionally designate any qualifying leave as OFLA pending approval of a Paid Leave Oregon claim.)\n\nOther leave laws can run at the same time. For example, both FMLA and OFLA would permit an employee to take pregnancy disability leave. Time taken for that event would be drawn down from both banks simultaneously.\n\nIn order to comply with two (or more) leave laws, employers may need to apply the law that is most beneficial to the employee. For example: OFLA and Oregon’s sick time law allow an employee to take leave to care for a child with an illness, injury or condition that requires home care. Although employers may require medical verification of the need for this leave after a third use of OFLA, sick time only permits medical verification after a third consecutive scheduled day of leave. An employer here would need to hold off on verification of OFLA leaves until after a third consecutive day when the leave is also covered by the sick time law.\n\nCan an absence due to a Workers’ Compensation claim also be counted as family leave?\n\nNot under OFLA, unless the employee refuses a suitable offer of light duty or modified employment. Where FMLA applies and the absence qualifies as a serious health condition, FMLA could apply to a workers’ compensation absence./p>\n\nNote that Paid Leave Oregon benefits also do not apply in any week in which an employee is eligible to receive workers’ compensation benefits.\n\nEditor’s note: State and federal family leave laws are intricate and complex.
