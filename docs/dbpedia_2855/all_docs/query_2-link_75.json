        "text": "Image\n\nPhoto by Jason Wettstein\n\nReport wildlife observations and join the many community scientists who collaborate and share observations to reveal a more complete picture of wildlife species presence, health and condition, movements, and distribution patterns.\n\nIn the event of an immediate public safety issue, wildlife violation, or an injured or dangerous animal, please call the WDFW Enforcement office at 360-902-2936 or email WILDCOMM@dfw.wa.gov, or call 911.\n\nWildlife observation reporting forms\n\nWhen reporting a wildlife observation, please provide your name and email, so a WDFW biologist can confirm your observation, if needed. Your name and contact information will not be displayed on the WDFW website but this information is a public record once you provide it, and may be subject to public records requests. See WDFW Privacy Webpage for further details.\n\nSpecies \"At-risk\" wildlife observations\n\nReport \"at-risk\" wildlife observations\n\nWDFW seeks to understand, monitor, conserve and manage for \"at-risk\" species in Washington. You can help by reporting wildlife observations. \"At-risk\" species include those designated as threatened or endangered, are considered a Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) , have a \"Priority Habitat and Species\" (PHS) designation, or are otherwise protected and managed for recovery. Query Washington wildlife species or learn more about conservation and management of \"at-risk\" species.\n\nView a webmap of publicly-reported \"at-risk\" wildlife observations.\n\nWildlife health observations\n\nReport sick, injured, or dead wildlife observations\n\nWDFW seeks to understand, monitor and respond to diseases, injuries, and other conditions that affect the health of wildlife in our state. You can help by reporting sick, injured or dead wildlife. Learn more about Washington wildlife diseases and health issues.\n\nView a webmap of publicly-reported wildlife health observations.\n\nReport sick or dead bats\n\nWhite-nose syndrome (WNS) is a deadly disease affecting Washington state bats. You can help by reporting sick or dead bats or groups of bats you find. Learn more about bats and WNS. This form is a quicker version of the larger wildlife health reporting form, so you can report in either of the two forms.\n\nReport limping elk or elk with hoof deformities\n\nElk Hoof Disease is a condition that affect the health of elk in Washington state. You can help by reporting limping elk or dead elk with hoof deformities. Learn more about elk hoof disease. This form is a quicker version of the larger wildlife health reporting form, so you can report in either of the two forms.\n\nReport marine mammal strandings\n\nMarine Mammals may become stranded on beaches or entangled in nets. In partnership with the West Coast Marine Mammal Stranding Network, WDFW monitors marine mammal strandings in Washington to track the health of populations and understand causes of mortality for these animals. You can help by reporting marine mammal strandings and by calling the marine mammal stranding hotline at 1-866-767-6114. This form is a quicker version of the larger wildlife health reporting form, so you can report in either of the two forms.\n\nReport dead fish or shellfish\n\nPoor environmental conditions can sometimes lead to events known as fish-die offs. Reporting dead fish or shellfish helps the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife to track problems as they arise and take appropriate action to protect imperiled fish stocks.\n\nIf you would like to report a suspected oil spill or pollution release, don't use this tool; please call 1-800-OILS-911 or visit the Department of Ecology's reporting page. If you suspect poaching, file a report online or call 877-933-9847.\n\nOther Animal Reporting Scenarios\n\nReport Mountain Goat Encounters\n\nWDFW and the US Forest Service are interested in better understanding the dynamics of mountain goat / human interactions, particularly on popular trails and camping areas. You can help by reporting mountain goat encounters. Learn more about mountain goats.\n\nNon-native/invasive species\n\nInvasive species, both plant and animal, pose a serious threat to the biological diversity of coastal waters the world over. With improvements in travel technology, the rate of introductions of non-native species has increased dramatically. You can help by reporting non-native and invasive species at the Washington Invasive Species Council website.\n\nReport wolf sightings\n\nReport wolf sightings. Learn more about wolf conservation, management, natural history, wolf sightings and wolf packs.\n\nReport wild turkey and upland bird observations"
