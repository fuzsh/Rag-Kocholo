        "text": "Collection List for Database\n\nThe list of collections is divided into the following three sections:\n\nJapanese Internment Collection Summaries\n\nManuscripts\n\nPublications and Books\n\nJapanese Internment Collection Summaries\n\nElla Evanson papers. Accession No. 2402-001\n\nElla Evanson (1890-1986) was a seventh and eighth grade teacher at the George Washington School (a junior high school in Seattle's Central District) from 1928 to her retirement in 1956. The school was known for its embrace of democratic ideals and message of tolerance for all racial groups. It boasted a diverse group of students, many of whom were Japanese American who were relocated to the Camp Harmony Assembly center in Puyallup and then Minidoka. Many of the papers in this collection begin in 1942, just prior to the evacuation of the Japanese from the west coast, and continue through the period of Japanese internment. The collection includes essays written by students about the evacuation of some of their fellow classmates; an autograph book with photographs of the 37 Japanese-American children at the school, along with their goodbye messages to Miss Evanson; and letters from students in the internment camps, written to Miss Evanson.\n\nMary Farquharson papers. Accession No. 0397-005\n\nMary Farquharson (ca. 1901-1982) was an activist for liberal and Christian causes who served as a Washington State senator from 1935 to 1941. During World War II, Farquharson was deeply committed to working to aid Japanese Americans who had been incarcerated. She was instrumental in advancing the case of Gordon Hirabayashi, a Japanese American who refused internment, to the U.S. Supreme Court. Farquharson's papers document activities of Caucasian Americans who did not agree with the federal relocation policy (groups such as the Fellowship of Reconciliation and the Pacific Coast Committee on American Principles and Fair Play). The collection includes several lengthy letters from Japanese American inmates, as well as clippings, ephemera, committee memoranda, newsletters, and miscellaneous writings of protest.\n\nHigano Family papers. Accession No. 2870-001\n\nThe Higanos were a Japanese-American family from Seattle, Washington. During World War II, members of the family were incarcerated at Camp Harmony in Puyallup and the Minidoka Relocation Center in Hunt, Idaho. The collection contains correspondence between members of the family and their friends during this time. Most of the letters were written by inmates and were addressed to Norio Higano, who was attending medical school in St. Louis, Missouri. Norio's parents, Hanji and Ura, and his sister Shizuko were at Camp Harmony and at Minidoka. Another sister, Aiko was enrolled at Joshi Isen, a women's medical college in Tokyo, Japan, from 1938-1942.\n\nGordon Hirabayashi papers. Accession No. 3159-008\n\nGordon Kiyoshi Hirabayashi (1918-2012) was an American sociologist and a conscientious objector of the Japanese American internment during WWII. Born in Seattle, he grew up on farmland surrounding Kent and later became a student at the University of Washington. As an undergraduate, Hirabayashi was an active member of the Quaker community and developed an uncompromising stand against social injustice. He refused to comply with the curfew imposed on Japanese Americans in the wake of the attack on Pearl Harbor, and later refused to report for relocation to the internment camps on the grounds that the directives were based solely on race and were therefore unconstitutional. After the last Japanese were forcibly removed from Seattle, Hirabayashi turned himself in to the FBI and was tried and convicted by the Federal Court. After serving time for his first sentences, he was later convicted of draft resistance and went to prison once more. After the war, Hirabayashi returned to the University of Washington and received BA, MA and PhD degrees in sociology. Upon completing of his education, he became a professor and taught all over the world. Hirabayashi retired from the University of Alberta in 1983. In the mid-1980s Hirabayashi, with the help of Peter Irons and other legal experts, brought new evidence to light regarding the exclusion order's prejudice and the government's misconduct. This resulted in Hirabayashi's convictions being overturned thanks to the rarely used Writ of Error Coram Nobis. In May 2012, four months after his death, Hirabayashi was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. This collection contains personal papers, manuscripts, journal entries, correspondence, FBI files, and additional ephemera from Gordon's trials and tribulations of his legal cases and personal experience during the 1940s and the 1980s.\n\nJapanese-American Citizens League, Seattle Branch Records. Accession No. 0217-006\n\nThe Seattle Chapter of the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) served as the voice of the Nisei (second generation Japanese) and were particularly active leading up to and during the period of Japanese internment. The members (primarily professionals) tended to be highly nationalistic and proud of their American citizenship, promoting good citizenship and active participation in civic life. Following the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the Seattle Japanese American Citizens League met to organize an Emergency Defense Council composed of the presidents of many Nisei organizations. When incarceration became inevitable, the Seattle Japanese American Citizens League began to cooperate with the War Relocation Authority in the evacuation and in governing the Puyallup Assembly Center (Camp Harmony). James Sakamoto, Chairman of the Emergency Defense Council, became Chief Supervisor of the Japanese staff at the Puyallup Assembly Center. The collection includes memoranda, correspondence and other ephemera documenting the JACL's activities during this period.\n\nIwao Matsushita papers. Accession No. 2718-001\n\nIwao Matsushita (1892-1979) immigrated to the United States from Japan in 1919. From the time of his arrival until World War II he was employed in Seattle as an office manager at Mitsui & Company, an export firm. In 1927, he introduced the first Japanese language course at the University of Washington. After the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1942 President Roosevelt signed a restraint and removal proclamation allowing the arrest of Japanese, German and Italian nationals on American soil. On the evening of December 7, Seattle police and FBI agents arrested Matsushita and many others detaining them at Immigration and Naturalization Services. Matsushita was then sent to Fort Missoula, Montana. His continued incarceration forced him to spend two years apart from his wife, Hanaye, who was interned at Camp Harmony in Puyallup and then Camp Minidoka in Hunt, Idaho. After several petitions and appeals, Matsushita was paroled and released to Minidoka where he arrived on January 11, 1944 and was reunited with his Hanaye. Many of the letters in the collection are written between Iwao Matsushita, Hanaye, and their family friend Dr. Kyo Koike who was also interned at Camp Harmony and Minidoka, relating their experiences in the camps and hoping for Iwao's release. Among the correspondence are also letters Hanaye wrote to gather affidavits regarding her husband's good character and loyalty so that he could join her at Minidoka.\n\nRing Family papers. Accession No. 4241-001\n\nFred and Mabel Ring were Seattle peace activists both before and after World War II. Their pacifist convictions, rooted in Christian beliefs, spurred them to reach out to Japanese American families who were incarcerated under Executive Order 9066. Most of these families they knew through their daughter Eleanor (Ellie), who had met many Japanese American friends as a student at the University of Washington, and as an active member of the University of Washington YMCA/YWCA. The Ring Family corresponded with several incarcerated families, providing support and small luxuries that were difficult to obtain in the camps. The collection contains several letters from Gordon Hirabayashi (1918-2012) who was one of Ellie's YMCA/YWCA friends. The letters discuss his experiences in jail after refusing to comply with the curfew imposed on Japanese Americans in the wake of the attack on Pearl Harbor and his resulting case before the Supreme Court. They also contain many of Hirabayashi's reflections on the suspect morality and constitutionality of the evacuation order.\n\nJames Sakamoto papers. Accession No. 1609-001\n\nJames (\"Jimmie\") Sakamoto (1903-1955) was a prominent Nisei community leader, activist, and newspaper publisher renowned for his ardent American patriotism. Blinded from a brief career as a prizefighter in 1927, Sakamoto went on to have many accomplishments. In 1928, he established and became publisher of Seattle's English language newspaper, the Japanese-American Courier. In 1930, he helped to form the Japanese American Citizens' League (JACL) and from 1936-1938 served as the organization's second national president. With the advent of World War II and the start of Japanese internment, Sakamoto was interned in Camp Harmony in Puyallup where he became \"Chief Supervisor.\" There Sakamoto offered critical support and leadership for his fellow Japanese Americans and was, simultaneously, a trusted functionary of Army officials. In the late summer of 1942, Sakamoto and his family were sent to a permanent relocation camp in Minidoka, Idaho. At Minidoka, Sakamoto continued to mediate on behalf of his fellow Nisei -- such as writing letters to political figures (including President Franklin D. Roosevelt) and arbitrating disputes -- but served in no official political capacity. The collection contains various pieces of correspondence between Sakamoto and the administration at both Camp Harmony and Minidoka along with personal correspondence containing requests for assistance from fellow internees.\n\n^ top of page ^\n\nManuscripts\n\nE. B. \"Harry\" Ault writings, letters, and ephemera, 1898-1928. (E. B. Harry Ault papers. Accession No. 0213-001)\n\nHarry Ault (1883-1961) was a journalist and a prominent member of the socialist and labor movements in Washington state in the first half of the 20th century. The \"sketches\" and short written pieces of Ault's in this collection describe his youth as a resident of Equality Colony, a socialist commune located near Edison, Washington. The letters and ephemera describe his later career in the 1910s and 1920s as the editor of the Seattle Union Record, the official organ of the Seattle Central Labor Council. The Union Record and Ault played an important role in the Seattle General Strike and the aftermath of the Centralia Massacre. These documents depict the successes of, and the tensions within, the labor movement in Washington during those years, including some documents produced by the opponents of organized labor, which Ault had collected and saved.\n\nBroussais C.

Accession No. 0155-001)\n\nBroussais Coman Beck (1886-1936) was a Seattle businessman who served as the Bon Marche's store manager in the late 1910s and early 1920s. In that capacity, he worked against the organized labor movement in Seattle by employing labor spies to infiltrate unions and other labor organizations. These spies sent him regular updates, along with examples of flyers, leaflets, and other ephemera distributed by activists in the movement. The documents give evidence of the actions and attitudes of members of the most influential labor organizations in Seattle -- the Central Labor Council, the Boilermakers' Local, the Metal Trades Council, the Industrial Workers of the World, and several others -- in the months following the Seattle General Strike, as well as their reactions to the Centralia Massacre.\n\nJohn Berns and John \"Packer Jack\" Newman correspondence, 1898-1928.

His scholarship was subsequently revoked because of his political leanings and Binh was forced to return home. On the flight back to Hanoi in 1972, Binh attempted to hijack the plane by pretending to have a bomb. He was shot and killed by a retired cop who was on board the plane. This collection contains his writings, correspondence from friends and family after his death, and various ephemera from his anti-war activities.\n\nDavid E. Blaine and Catherine P.

Filipino Alaskeros first appeared in the canneries around 1911. In the 1920s as exclusionary immigration laws went into effect, they replaced the Japanese, who had replaced the Chinese in the canneries. Workers were recruited through labor contractors who were paid to provide a work crew for the summer canning season. The contractor paid workers wages and other expenses. This system led to many abuses and harsh working conditions from which grew the movement toward unionization. These items document the early history of the union from the 1930s-1950s.\n\nLetters of George W. Carmack, 1895-1922 (George W. Carmack papers. Accession no. 5176-001)\n\nGeorge W.

After the passage of the national Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882, anti-Chinese agitation on the West Coast reached a fever pitch in 1885-1886. Governor Squire was forced to declare martial law in Seattle to maintain order during the anti-Chinese riots in Seattle and Tacoma, and later investigated property losses of the Chinese. These documents covering the period from 1885-1887 describe those events.\n\nLetters of Isaac Ingalls Stevens, 1855-1858 (Isaac Ingalls Stevens Papers. Accession no. 0111-001)\n\nIsaac I. Stevens served as the first Governor and Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Washington Territory (1853-57) and later as the territory's delegate to Congress (1857-1858). This collection includes several of his letters from 1855 to 1858, both to and from congressmen, judges, colonels, and Indian Agents as well as a circular letter describing the benefits of living in Washington Territory and a plan for the construction of a road between Puget Sound and Snoqualmie Pass. The letters dating from 1855-1858 describe life on the reservations of local tribes, events in the Yakima War (1855-56), conflicts between British and American citizens over jurisdiction of San Juan Island, the state of mail service, an expedition for exploring possible routes for a Pacific Railroad line, and protection for settlers from hostile Native Americans.\n\nAnna Louise Strong correspondence and ephemera, 1909-1935. (Anna Louise Strong papers. Accession No. 1309-001)\n\nAnna Louise Strong was already a vocal progressive reformer when she came to Seattle with her father, Congregationalist minister Sydney Strong. These letters and other documents trace her increasing involvement in the Seattle labor movement, in part due to her work writing for the Seattle Union Record, and the outcomes of that involvement. The primary event described is the campaign waged against her for her political views, which ultimately achieved its goal of recalling her from her position as a Seattle School Board member in March, 1918. Some correspondence also reflects back on her work in Seattle and on her perspective on the successes and failures of Seattle's labor movement, which Strong wrote after leaving the city to travel and write in the Soviet Union.\n\nJames Gilchrist Swan diaries, 1859-1866. (James Gilchrist Swan papers. Accession no. 1703-001)\n\nAn early Washington pioneer, student of Northwest Indian language and culture, political advisor, artist, and teacher, James Gilchrist Swan was born in 1818 and travelled west from Massachusetts to San Francisco to participate in the gold rush. After two years in California, Swan travelled north to Washington Territory, eventually settling in Port Townsend. It was in Washington that he began studying and working with the Makah tribe in Neah Bay. He spent several years with the Makah, learning their language and writing an ethnography on the tribe. He also worked as a schoolteacher on the reservation. In addition to his work as an anthropologist and teacher, Swan authored The Northwest Coast; or, Three Years' Residence in Washington Territory, an early book on pioneer and Native American life in Washington, and served for several years as secretary to Congressional delegate Isaac Stevens. He was also a judge and a consul to Hawaii. Additionally, Swan worked for the Smithsonian Institution, collecting Native American artifacts for several world's fairs. Swan died in 1900.\n\nLouise Swift Letters, 1863-1869. (Louise Swift papers. Accession No. 4917-001)\n\nLetters written primarily by Louise Swift, wife of Captain James Henry Swift, from Whidbey Island to relatives in Massachusetts in 1863-1869 describing domestic activities, family relationships, illnesses, children, deaths, and social life. Louisa died in the diphtheria epidemic that swept the island in August 1869.\n\nLetters to William Henson Wallace, 1863. (William Henson Wallace Papers. Accession no. 1157-001)\n\nWilliam Henson Wallace served as the Washington Territory delegate to the 37th Congress (1863-1865) and also as Idaho Territory's Governor and Idaho's delegate to Congress from 1861-1863. This 1863 collection of letters to Wallace from Indian Agents and a military commander describes the status of various Native American tribes in Washington, Oregon and Idaho territories as well as specifically addressing conflicts within the Nez Perce following the Treaty of 1863 which severely reduced reservation lands.\n\nHelen Julia Mason Walsh memoires, 1877. (Helen Julia Mason Walsh papers. Accession no. 4947-001)\n\nThis reminiscence contains an account of Mrs. Walsh's experiences in the 1877 Nez Perce war. Helen Julia Mason Walsh, an early settler on the Salmon River in Idaho, describes Nez Perce hostilities in the White Bird Canyon in the summer of 1877. She recounts fleeing with her brother, Harry Mason, and the family of William Osborn, only to be attacked and captured at the Osborn cabin on White Bird Creek.\n\nEliza Spalding Warren letters regarding the Whitman Massacre. (Clarence Leroy Andrews papers. Accession no. 4797-002)\n\nThe Whitman Massacre took place on Nov. 29, 1847, at Waiilatpu, a Christian mission on the Walla Walla River, when missionary Marcus Whitman, his wife Narcissa, and twelve male residents of the mission were murdered by a small band of Cayuse. The Cayuse blamed Whitman for a measles epidemic that had killed many members of the tribe, and also feared that he was bringing in too many white settlers. Eliza Spalding, only ten years old at the time of the event, describes the events of that day and offers advice on which historical accounts of the day might be most reliable.\n\nWashington Territory documents, 1878-1889 (Washington Territory records. Accession no. 4284-001)\n\nThese records from Washington Territory illuminate a number of social concerns present in Washington Territory in the 1870s and 1880s. Most of the manuscripts originate from the Washington Territory Constitutional Convention held in Walla Walla during June and July of 1878. These documents include resolutions adopted regarding Native American tribes and lands as well as women's rights and women's suffrage, suggestions for constitutional articles. The collection also contains a petition from the territory's citizens to Congress requesting admission for statehood in 1889.\n\nCharles and Sarah Willoughby letters and manuscripts, 1878-1885. (Charles L. Willoughby papers. Accession no. 4972-001)\n\nCharles L. Willoughby (1832-1888) served as the Indian Agent at the Neah Bay Reservation for the Makah tribe in the late 1870s, and as Indian Agent at the Quinault Reservation in the 1880s. Letters between Willoughby and the various Commissioners of Indian Affairs illustrate many issues regarding life and work at the reservations. Charles's wife, Sarah C. Willoughby (1842-1913), a former teacher and university instructor, was a close observer of the people she encountered while living on the reservation. Her letters and unfinished manuscripts offer many details about Native American customs and practices, and relate a number of legends she attributes to several different tribes of the Pacific Northwest.\n\n^ top of page ^\n\nPublications and Books\n\nChoir's pioneer directory of the city of Seattle and King County, History, business directory, and immigrant's guide to and throughout Washington Territory and vicinity, (1878) F891 C54 1878\n\nEarly history of Thurston County, Washington: together with biographies and reminiscences of those identified with pioneer days, (1914) 979.746 B61 1914\n\nThe great Seattle fire of June 6th, 1889 : containing a succinct and complete account of the greatest conflagration on the Pacific coast F899.S4 A87 1966\n\nHistory of the city of Spokane and Spokane County, Washington: from its earliest settlement to the present time, (1912) F899 S76 D87\n\nHistory of the Yakima Valley, Washington; comprising Yakima, Kittitas, and Benton Counties, (1919) 979.77 L98h\n\nHistory of Washington; the rise and progress of an American state, (1909) F891 S66 1909\n\nAn Illustrated history of Klickitat, Yakima and Kittitas counties, with an outline of the early history of the state of Washington, (1904) F897 K6 I45 1977\n\nAn illustrated history of Skagit and Snohomish Counties; their people, their commerce and their resources, with an outline of the early history of the state of Washington, (1906) 979.733 IL6\n\nAn illustrated history of southeastern Washington, including Walla Walla, Columbia, Garfield and Asotin counties, Washington, (1906) 979.79 IL6\n\nAn Illustrated history of Stevens, Ferry, Okanogan and Chelan counties, State of Washington, (1904) 979.76 St4i\n\nAn illustrated history of the Big Bend country, embracing Lincoln, Douglas, Adams, and Franklin counties, state of Washington, (1904) 979.783 IL6\n\nAn illustrated history of the state of Washington, containing biographical mention of its pioneers and prominent citizens, (1893) 979.7 H58i\n\nAn Illustrated history of Whitman County, State of Washington, (1901) 979.792 IL61\n\nIn the beginning: a sketch of some early events in western Washington while it was still a part of old Oregon, (1905) 979.5 B14\n\nIsland Home, (1892) 979.742 ISH 1892\n\nIsland County: a world beater (1913) F897 I7 I85\n\nIsland County Times, (1913) 979.737 Sw5n\n\nLyman's history of old Walla Walla County, embracing Walla Walla, Columbia, Garfield and Asotin counties, (1918) 979.79 L98L\n\nReminisences of Andrew Jackson Chambers. 979.719 C355r\n\nReminiscences of Washington territory: scenes, incidents and reflections of the pioneer period on Puget Sound, (1904) 979.7 P94\n\nRural settlement in Western Washington, (1922) HT167.5 W3 H66 1986\n\nTold by the pioneers...
