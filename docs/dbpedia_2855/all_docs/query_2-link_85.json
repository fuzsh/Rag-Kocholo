        "text": "For The General Public\n\nPublic Health\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the public health risk associated with HPAI remains low.\n\nOn May 22nd, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services announced Michigan's first human case of HPAI in a dairy farm worker. On May 30th, a second human case of HPAI in a farm worker in Michigan was reported. According to the CDC, the risk to the public remains low.

As a reminder, it is essential that people follow proper food safety practices when handling and cooking all poultry and eggs products.\n\nAs a reminder, it is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry in the United States. The proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165˚F kills bacteria and viruses, including HPAI viruses.\n\nWith regard to the latest detection of HPAI in dairy cattle across the U.S., according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Drug Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the commercial milk supply remains safe due to both federal animal health requirements and pasteurization.\n\nUSDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is announcing results from its testing of retail ground beef. FSIS collected 30 samples of ground beef from retail outlets in the states with dairy cattle herds that had tested positive for the H5N1 influenza virus at the time of sample collection. The samples were sent to APHIS’ National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) for PCR testing. On May 1, NVSL reported that all samples tested negative for H5N1. These results reaffirm that the meat supply is safe.\n\nFor more information, see the FDA's questions and answers about milk safety during highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks.\n\nThe FDA maintains an HPAI updates page for up-to-date information on national food safety.\n\nMDHHS Raw Milk Risks Flyer (PDF) (Español) (Arabic)\n\nUSDA APHIS Indemnity and Compensation when Your Flock is Infected\n\nMichigan Poultry Veterinarians GIS Map\n\nOther Animals\n\nHighly Pathogenic Avian Influenza and Cats: FAQ about HPAI and feral and domestic cats\n\nPrintable Flyers and Posters:\n\nHow to Recognize a Sick Bird - Poster (PDF)\n\nSurveillance Zones & Control Areas: Definitions and Expectations - Infographic (PDF)\n\nPrintable Farm Worker Protection Poster (PDF) (Digital Version (PDF))\n\nCartel Imprimible: Protección de los Trabajadores Agrícolas - Español (PDF) (Versión Digital (PDF))\n\nPrintable \"How to Recognize\" Bird Flu Flyer (PDF)\n\nPrintable \"How to Recognize\" Bird Flu Post Cards (PDF)\n\nRecursos en Español"
