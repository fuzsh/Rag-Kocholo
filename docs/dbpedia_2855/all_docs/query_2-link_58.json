        "text": "Overview\n\nHeatstroke is a condition caused by your body overheating, usually as a result of prolonged exposure to or physical exertion in high temperatures. This most serious form of heat injury, heatstroke, can occur if your body temperature rises to 104 F (40 C) or higher. The condition is most common in the summer months.\n\nHeatstroke requires emergency treatment. Untreated heatstroke can quickly damage your brain, heart, kidneys and muscles. The damage worsens the longer treatment is delayed, increasing your risk of serious complications or death.\n\nSymptoms\n\nHeatstroke signs and symptoms include:\n\nHigh body temperature. A core body temperature of 104 F (40 C) or higher, obtained with a rectal thermometer, is the main sign of heatstroke.\n\nAltered mental state or behavior. Confusion, agitation, slurred speech, irritability, delirium, seizures and coma can all result from heatstroke.\n\nAlteration in sweating. In heatstroke brought on by hot weather, your skin will feel hot and dry to the touch. However, in heatstroke brought on by strenuous exercise, your skin may feel dry or slightly moist.\n\nNausea and vomiting. You may feel sick to your stomach or vomit.\n\nFlushed skin. Your skin may turn red as your body temperature increases.\n\nRapid breathing. Your breathing may become rapid and shallow.\n\nRacing heart rate. Your pulse may significantly increase because heat stress places a tremendous burden on your heart to help cool your body.\n\nHeadache. Your head may throb.\n\nWhen to see a doctor\n\nIf you think a person may be experiencing heatstroke, seek immediate medical help. Call 911 or your local emergency services number.\n\nTake immediate action to cool the overheated person while waiting for emergency treatment.\n\nGet the person into shade or indoors.\n\nRemove excess clothing.\n\nCool the person with whatever means available â€” put in a cool tub of water or a cool shower, spray with a garden hose, sponge with cool water, fan while misting with cool water, or place ice packs or cold, wet towels on the person's head, neck, armpits and groin.\n\nThere is a problem with information submitted for this request.

In a type of heatstroke, called nonexertional (classic) heatstroke, being in a hot environment leads to a rise in core body temperature. This type of heatstroke typically occurs after exposure to hot, humid weather, especially for prolonged periods. It occurs most often in older adults and in people with chronic illness.\n\nStrenuous activity. Exertional heatstroke is caused by an increase in core body temperature brought on by intense physical activity in hot weather. Anyone exercising or working in hot weather can get exertional heatstroke, but it's most likely to occur if you're not used to high temperatures.\n\nIn either type of heatstroke, your condition can be brought on by:\n\nWearing excess clothing that prevents sweat from evaporating easily and cooling your body\n\nDrinking alcohol, which can affect your body's ability to regulate your temperature\n\nBecoming dehydrated by not drinking enough water to replenish fluids lost through sweating\n\nRisk factors\n\nAnyone can develop heatstroke, but several factors increase your risk:\n\nAge. Your ability to cope with extreme heat depends on the strength of your central nervous system. In the very young, the central nervous system is not fully developed, and in adults over 65, the central nervous system begins to deteriorate, which makes your body less able to cope with changes in body temperature. Both age groups usually have difficulty remaining hydrated, which also increases risk.\n\nExertion in hot weather. Military training and participating in sports, such as football or long-distance running events, in hot weather are among the situations that can lead to heatstroke.\n\nSudden exposure to hot weather. You may be more susceptible to heat-related illness if you're exposed to a sudden increase in temperature, such as during an early-summer heat wave or travel to a hotter climate.\n\nLimit activity for at least several days to allow yourself to acclimate to the change. However, you may still have an increased risk of heatstroke until you've experienced several weeks of higher temperatures.\n\nA lack of air conditioning. Fans may make you feel better, but during sustained hot weather, air conditioning is the most effective way to cool down and lower humidity.\n\nCertain medications. Some medications affect your body's ability to stay hydrated and respond to heat. Be especially careful in hot weather if you take medications that narrow your blood vessels (vasoconstrictors), regulate your blood pressure by blocking adrenaline (beta blockers), rid your body of sodium and water (diuretics), or reduce psychiatric symptoms (antidepressants or antipsychotics).\n\nStimulants for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and illegal stimulants such as amphetamines and cocaine also make you more vulnerable to heatstroke.\n\nCertain health conditions. Certain chronic illnesses, such as heart or lung disease, might increase your risk of heatstroke. So can being obese, being sedentary and having a history of previous heatstroke.\n\nComplications\n\nHeatstroke can result in a number of complications, depending on how long the body temperature is high. Severe complications include:\n\nVital organ damage. Without a quick response to lower body temperature, heatstroke can cause your brain or other vital organs to swell, possibly resulting in permanent damage.\n\nDeath. Without prompt and adequate treatment, heatstroke can be fatal.\n\nPrevention\n\nHeatstroke is predictable and preventable. Take these steps to prevent heatstroke during hot weather:\n\nWear loosefitting, lightweight clothing. Wearing excess clothing or clothing that fits tightly won't allow your body to cool properly.\n\nProtect against sunburn. Sunburn affects your body's ability to cool itself, so protect yourself outdoors with a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15. Apply sunscreen generously, and reapply every two hours â€” or more often if you're swimming or sweating.\n\nDrink plenty of fluids. Staying hydrated will help your body sweat and maintain a normal body temperature.\n\nTake extra precautions with certain medications. Be on the lookout for heat-related problems if you take medications that can affect your body's ability to stay hydrated and dissipate heat.\n\nNever leave anyone in a parked car. This is a common cause of heat-related deaths in children. When parked in the sun, the temperature in your car can rise 20 degrees F (more than 11 C) in 10 minutes.\n\nIt's not safe to leave a person in a parked car in warm or hot weather, even if the windows are cracked or the car is in shade. When your car is parked, keep it locked to prevent a child from getting inside.\n\nTake it easy during the hottest parts of the day. If you can't avoid strenuous activity in hot weather, drink fluids and rest frequently in a cool spot. Try to schedule exercise or physical labor for cooler parts of the day, such as early morning or evening.\n\nGet acclimated. Limit time spent working or exercising in heat until you're conditioned to it. People who are not used to hot weather are especially susceptible to heat-related illness. It can take several weeks for your body to adjust to hot weather.\n\nBe cautious if you're at increased risk. If you take medications or have a condition that increases your risk of heat-related problems, avoid the heat and act quickly if you notice symptoms of overheating. If you participate in a strenuous sporting event or activity in hot weather, make sure there are medical services available in case of a heat emergency.\n\nHeat stress-heat related illness.
