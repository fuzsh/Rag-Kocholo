        "text": "It was eight in the morning, and the prickly July humidity had already seeped through my skin as I hopped out of the cab in Singapore’s Little India. Greeted by the bustle of vendors setting up, I was transported back to my childhood, to days spent wandering the neighborhood with my grandmother. The aroma of fresh coriander from vibrant spice stalls spurred memories of her tangy coconut prawn curry. The musky fragrance of jasmine adorning colorful flower stalls reminded me of how she’d woven them into my braids. She never would again.\n\nThe air around you changes when someone you love leaves this world. My grandmother’s death was not a surprise, but the shock that I would no longer make new memories with her broke me. When I moved to Vancouver nearly seven years earlier, I’d left behind my family—her most notably, my eternally curious grandmother, who taught me how to be the same, how to notice the world.\n\nShe spoke many languages: English, Malayalam, Tamil, and Hindi—even a little Japanese, since she grew up during the Japanese occupation of Singapore. Words confidently left her lips as she spoke with native speakers in their mother tongues. I’ve heard that mastering a language as an adult was difficult, but the sight and sounds of her code-switching with confidence to connect with others encouraged me to follow my own curiosities.\n\nWhen I first arrived in Vancouver, in 2012, my natural reaction was to find something familiar, a Singaporean community—not particularly difficult given the city’s strong Asian diaspora. But there was a voice in my head that told me to try something new; perhaps it was my grandmother’s. After I signed up on a whim to volunteer at an annual Mexican independence day celebration, I started Spanish lessons too. Years later, I now split my time in Medellín and Vancouver; my hard-earned fluency has paid off. My curiosity has reaped dividends. I have my grandmother to thank for it.\n\nIn 2019, when my mother in Singapore said that my grandmother wasn’t doing well, I booked the first flight home. But flights are long and phone calls don’t make it through. She died while I was somewhere over the Pacific; I missed saying goodbye to her by five hours. At her funeral, I navigated conversations with people I hadn’t seen in almost a decade, opening the door to a past self: that of a young Nikkita too afraid to voice her opinions, too concerned with good impressions. That identity was one I’d long outgrown after my time in Vancouver, where I knew no one, where I had a chance to develop my individuality, where I incorporated the lessons my grandmother instilled in me.\n\nFrom the time I was five years old, my grandmother brought me along on a weekly ritual she kept with her sisters. Every Thursday, they picked an activity to explore Singapore anew, meeting first to pray at Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple in the city’s Little India. The tradition became so ingrained that my parents got used to writing sick notes for me; they eventually ran out of mysterious ailments to give me so I could skip school for the day. These midweek escapades were a highlight: Sometimes we escaped the tropical heat at the nearby Cathay Cineplex, Singapore’s first air-conditioned cinema, where we watched foreign movies, traveling through films. On other days, we toured goldsmiths across Little India—though we always returned to her favorite, Meena Jewellers. Through their jewelry, my grandmother taught me about hand-carved designs that incorporated Hindu mythology and Indian gemstones, like sapphire and moonstone, with gold.\n\nI admired my grandmother’s resoluteness whenever she ventured outside her comfort zone. She often traveled alone from Singapore to India—to Trivandrum, Kerala, near where her parents were born. This was in the age of calling cards, and we wouldn’t hear from her for days. Whenever we finally reached her, she would nonchalantly recount her adventures across Kerala, including visits to the gold-plated Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple and the almost 2,000-year-old Janardhana Swamy Temple by Varkala’s seaside.\n\nSpiritual as her pilgrimages were, she was more fascinated by centuries-old architecture and pilgrims she’d meet while traveling alone—the culture of the people who lived in the area, the food they ate, the way they lived. I recall how, when I was nine years old, she let me help her unpack her overloaded suitcase after she’d returned from one of her trips. She told me about how she stayed on a houseboat in Kerala and what she ate onboard—chakka thoran, one of her favorite dishes, a stir-fry made with coconut and tender jackfruit. As she described being lulled to sleep along green-colored backwaters fenced by slender coconut palm trees in Alappuzha, I learned to explore the world through her stories, by what she shared with me. It’s these details my grandmother remembered—that I remember now—that taught me that to see and to notice is, in some small way, to travel.\n\nOn my last day in Singapore, seven days after her funeral, I roamed past refurbished two-story shophouses in Little India, admiring the intricate architecture that spanned generations, much like the temples my grandmother marveled at during her trips to Kerala. Growing up, I’d never noticed the colorfully painted façades; but on that day, I saw them carefully restored in pastel-colored hues. Many storefronts I recalled from my childhood were still around: established restaurants like Komala Vilas with their vegetarian South Indian cuisine, and Muthu’s Curry, a favorite for their zesty fish-head curry. Yet much had changed, like the DVD shops I’d visited with my grandmother, where we had eagerly purchased every Bollywood movie ever released. In their place were more eateries and even more goldsmiths, ones my grandmother would never notice. But everything, I realized, runs its course.\n\nI wandered through narrow paths, cutting between shophouses and avoiding crowds, proud that I was not lost in the streets I hadn’t seen in seven years—that I had last seen with my grandmother. At that moment, without her, I was finding my own way."
