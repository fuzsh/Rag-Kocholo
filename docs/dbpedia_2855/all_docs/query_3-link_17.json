        "text": "Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 â€“ April 15, 1865) was an American statesman and lawyer who served as the 16th president of the United States from 1861 until his assassination in April 1865. Lincoln led the nation through the American Civil War, its bloodiest war and its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis. He preserved the Union, abolished slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the U.S. economy. Born in Kentucky, Lincoln grew up on the frontier in a poor family. Self-educated, he became a lawyer, Whig Party leader, Illinois state legislator and Congressman. In 1849, he left government to resume his law practice, but angered by the success of Democrats in opening the prairie lands to slavery, reentered politics in 1854. He became a leader in the new Republican Party and gained national attention in 1858 for debating national Democratic leader Stephen A. Douglas in the 1858 Illinois Senate campaign. He then ran for President in 1860, sweeping the North and winning. Southern pro-slavery elements took his win as proof that the North was rejecting the constitutional rights of Southern states to practice slavery. They began the process of seceding from the union. To secure its independence, the new Confederate States of America fired on Fort Sumter, one of the few U.S. forts in the South. Lincoln called up volunteers and militia to suppress the rebellion and restore the Union. As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party, Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans, who demanded harsher treatment of the South; War Democrats, who rallied a large faction of former opponents into his camp; anti-war Democrats (called Copperheads), who despised him; and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination. Lincoln fought the factions by pitting them against each other, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people. His Gettysburg Address became an iconic call for nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. He suspended habeas corpus, and he averted British intervention by defusing the Trent Affair. Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, including the selection of generals and the naval blockade that shut down the South's trade. As the war progressed, he maneuvered to end slavery, issuing the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863; ordering the Army to protect escaped slaves, encouraging border states to outlaw slavery, and pushing through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which outlawed slavery across the country. Lincoln managed his own re-election campaign. He sought to reconcile his damaged nation by avoiding retribution against the secessionists. A few days after the Battle of Appomattox Court House, he was shot by John Wilkes Booth, an actor and Confederate sympathizer, on April 14, 1865, and died the following day. Abraham Lincoln is remembered as the United States' martyr hero. He is consistently ranked both by scholars and the public as among the greatest U.S. presidents.\n\nKurt Cobain, a name synonymous with the grunge music movement, was born on February 20, 1967, in Aberdeen, Washington. An iconic figure, Cobain was the lead vocalist and guitarist of the rock band Nirvana. His early life was marked by a turbulent family background, which significantly influenced his music. His parents divorced when he was nine years old, an event that deeply affected him and became a recurring theme in many of his songs. Cobain's journey into music started with a cheap guitar he received as a birthday gift at the age of 14. The self-taught musician soon began exploring different music genres, but it was punk rock that captivated him the most. After a brief stint with a few bands during his high school years, Cobain formed Nirvana in 1987 alongside bassist Krist Novoselic. The band's raw energy and Cobain's introspective lyrics quickly caught the attention of Sub Pop Records, leading to their debut album, Bleach. Nirvana's second album, Nevermind, released in 1991, became a global sensation, making Cobain an international superstar. The album, featuring the hit single Smells Like Teen Spirit, is often credited for bringing alternative rock into the mainstream. Despite his success, Cobain struggled with personal issues, including depression and drug addiction. His tumultuous relationship with Courtney Love, whom he married in 1992, also garnered much media attention. Cobain's struggles culminated in his untimely death by suicide in April 1994, leaving behind a legacy that continues to influence music today.\n\nTupac Shakur, also known by his stage names 2Pac and Makaveli, was a groundbreaking figure in the realm of hip-hop. Born on June 16, 1971, in East Harlem, New York City to a family deeply involved in the Black Panther Party's activities, he was introduced to the harsh realities of life from an early age. His challenging upbringing played a significant role in shaping Tupac's artistry. Shakur's music career started when he joined Digital Underground as a backup dancer and rapper. However, it wasn't long before he gained prominence for his lyricism that encapsulated socio-political commentary and exposed stark truths about the violence and hardship faced by many African-Americans. In addition to his successful musical career that included chart-topping hits like Dear Mama and California Love, Shakur also dabbled into acting with roles in films such as Juice and Poetic Justice. Despite his soaring popularity within the music industry, Tupac found himself entangled with legal issues frequently which led to multiple prison stints throughout his career. Tragically cut short at just 25 years old due to gun violence, Tupac left behind an influential legacy that continues to resonate within hip-hop culture even today. Known for pushing boundaries through thought-provoking lyrics coupled with raw emotionality - Shakur remains one of the most revered figures not only within rap but across all genres of music.\n\nBorn on February 1, 1965, in Oakland, California, Brandon Lee entered the world with an impressive legacy already attached to his name. As the son of martial arts legend Bruce Lee and granddaughter to prominent Chinese opera singer Lee Hoi-chuen, he was destined for greatness. Amidst his father's untimely passing when he was just eight years old, a young Brandon had embarked on a journey to follow in his father's footsteps, both as a martial artist and an actor. Brandon's early career bloomed in the late 1980s, where he made appearances in several low-budget action films such as Kung Fu: The Movie and Legacy of Rage. However, it wasn't until the 1992 film Rapid Fire that his prodigious talent became widely acknowledged. His martial arts prowess, combined with his charismatic on-screen presence, catapulted him to stardom. His portrayal of Jake Lo, a college student drawn into the dangerous world of drug trafficking, resonated with audiences and critics alike. Tragically, Brandon's promising career was cut short during the filming of The Crow in 1993. A prop gun malfunction resulted in his accidental death at the tender age of 28. Despite his untimely demise, Brandon Lee's impact on the cinematic world remains indelible. His intense passion for martial arts and his dedication to his craft continue to inspire future generations of actors and martial artists, maintaining his status as a significant figure in both Hollywood and worldwide cinema."
