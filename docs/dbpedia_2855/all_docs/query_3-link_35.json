        "text": "By Steve Pomper\n\nShaquille O’Neal\n\nThought I’d drift away from the normal serious discussions we’ve been having (must have) regarding policing in the U.S. today. With all the defunding, anti-police legislation, and cops being prosecuted for doing their jobs, it’s necessary.\n\nHowever, I was thinking about something less serious but still interesting—at least, to cops. Famous people who have so much respect for law enforcement, they strap on a gun belt, don body armor, swear an oath, and pin on a badge to serve their communities. To one degree or another, these folks don’t just talk the talk; they walk the walk (oh, man… did I really just say that?) Well, nevertheless, it’s true.\n\nMost people know about folks like Ted Nugent, whose been a reserve deputy in Lake County, Michigan for many decades. He always speaks highly of cops and has a respectable patch collection to boot.\n\nTed Nugent\n\nShaq is another famous reserve cop. In fact, the NBA superstar has been sworn in as a reserve officer for Miami Beach, Golden Beach, Doral, Florida, Tempe, Arizona, and the Port of Los Angeles, California. I don’t know about you, but I love imagining Shaq breaching a door with me on a warrant service. Or just walking up to a cocky gangbanger’s car on a traffic stop.\n\nFor the fogies among us who grew up in the 60s and 70s, Ken Osmond, Wally’s ingratiating best friend Eddie Haskell on the TV series, Leave It to Beaver, became a career police officer in the LAPD. While many people know this, they may not know that a suspect shot Osmond in the line of duty. Though stories vary, essentially, three bullets struck him, two hit his ballistic vest and one deflected off his belt buckle. While he survived the shooting physically unscathed, his mental health suffered, eventually forcing him to leave the force. Officer Osmond died in 2020.\n\nKen Osmond\n\nAnother teen star from the 60s/70s was singer/actor Bobby Sherman. Co-star of the hit series set in 19th Century Seattle, Here Come the Brides and heart-throb crooner, like Osmond, was a member of the LAPD. He served for many years as a reserve officer, rising to the rank of Captain.\n\nActor James Woods also served as a reserve officer for the LAPD.\n\nIt’s probably not surprising that martial arts legend and movie star Chuck Norris was in law enforcement and not just as a Texas Ranger on TV. Norris served in the U.S. Air Force as a security police officer. He was also a reserve officer for the Terrell (TX) P.D.\n\nChuck Norris\n\nAnother famed martial artist movie star, Steven Seagal, served as a reserve officer in Jefferson Parish, LA and deputy for the Hudspeth County (TX) Sheriff’s Office.\n\nActor Dennis Farina, who seemed as comfortable playing a mobster as a cop, was legit law enforcement. He served in the Chicago P.D. for 18 years as a patrol officer and detective before getting into acting.\n\nDennis Farina\n\nDean Cain has been a reserve officer in St. Anthony, Idaho since 2018 when he was sworn in. Cain joined fellow actor Erik Estrada, of CHIPS fame, who also serves that community as a reserve police officer.\n\nDean Cain Erik Estrada\n\nEight-time Mr. Olympia Ronnie Coleman is another legit cop. He served full time on the Arlington, TX P.D. from 1989 – 2003—while competing for and winning some of his Mr. O titles.\n\nSpeaking of legendary bodybuilders, Lou Ferrigno (Hulk) not only served as a reserve deputy and officer for the San Luis Obispo P.D. and the LA County Sheriff’s Office, but also his dad was an NYPD lieutenant.\n\nSinger Eddie Money was an NYPD officer (before becoming a famous 70s rocker).\n\nRounding out the famous cop crowd were a couple of honorary mentions for their recognition for support of law enforcement:\n\nElvis Presley was an honorary DEA agent (ironic doesn’t begin to describe that honor) bestowed by President Richard Nixon.\n\nDan Akroyd is an honorary Harahan (LA) P.D. officer.\n\nAnd, back to Shaq for a moment. Adding to his lawman credentials, he is reportedly also an honorary U.S. Marshal.\n\nBy the way, when I used “legit” to describe certain celebrities police service, such as Farina and Coleman, that’s not to disparage anyone’s service to law enforcement in a reserve, special, or any capacity. Most reserves, such as on my department, go on patrol either alone or with full time officers and take the same risks.\n\nHowever, for many of the celebrity coppers, they’re admit their roles are largely ceremonial and limited to support roles.\n\nStill, I figure if I think it’s pretty cool that these “Hollywood” anomalies (people who like cops) want to be recognized for their associations with real law enforcement agencies, I believe others will think so too and will appreciate a frivolous distraction."
