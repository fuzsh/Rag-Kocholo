AI specialist WSC Sports is working with NRK Sports – the sports division of Norwegian public broadcaster NRK – to automate the creation of real-time video highlights of the Euro 2020 tournament.

NRK will use WSC Sports’ suite of tools to share highlights of key plays and players across its digital and social media platforms.

The partnership will also include one of WSC Sports latest offerings, which auto-creates stories for Google’s OneBox; the first search result in Google.

WSC Sports’ platform enables NRK to create and distribute customised video highlights that automatically create a personalised fan experience.

NRK will utilise new WSC Sports’ features including Live Stories which will enable it to publish content in stories format for better mobile experiences. Additionally, NRK will launch a live ticker on its website that featuring highlights of key play-by-plays throughout the games.

Ido Ratzon, business development at WSC Sports, said: “We are excited to bring WSC Sports’ AI-powered technology to NRK to help them create the best fan-viewing experience for the Euros this year. We are particularly looking forward to helping NRK deliver its sports content for the first time ever in story format through Google OneBox, with the rollout of WSC Sports Stories.”
