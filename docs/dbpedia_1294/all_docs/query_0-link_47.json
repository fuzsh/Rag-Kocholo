        "text": "Land and Climate\n\nNorway is 1,089 miles (1,753 kilometers) in length but measures only about 267 miles (430 kilometers) across at its widest point. The length of the coastline, excluding the country’s many fjords (arms of the sea that penetrate inland) and bays, is about 1,647 miles (2,650 kilometers).\n\nLand\n\nNorway is largely mountainous with few areas of flatland. About 80 percent of the country is above 1,500 feet (460 meters) in height. Much of southern Norway consists of a high plateau penetrated by valleys and fjords. The fjords were originally valleys scooped out by glaciers and are very deep. The longest fjord is Sognafjorden, which reaches 127 miles (204 kilometers) inland. On the plateau there are areas of high mountains. The largest area is Jotunheimen, with Norway’s two highest mountains—Galdhøpiggen (8,100 feet; 2,469 meters) and Glittertinden (8,084 feet; 2,464 meters). There are more than 1,500 glaciers in Norway. The largest is Jostedalsbreen, west of Jotunheimen, covering 188 square miles (487 square kilometers).\n\nSoutheastern Norway is mainly flat. Long valleys, such as Gudbrandsdal, end in the flatland around the Oslofjord. There are also some flat areas around the south coast and at the heads of the fjords. The west coast is lined with more than 150,000 islands. The largest group is the Lofoten Islands, located north of the Arctic Circle. Farther north is the Nordkapp (North Cape), the most northerly point in Europe. Norway controls the Svalbard archipelago, located in the Arctic Ocean at the edge of the polar ice cap. The largest island group within the Svalbard are the Spitsbergen Islands, which cover 23,641 square miles (61,230 square kilometers). They are mountainous and largely covered with ice.\n\nNorway has many rivers, but most are fairly short. The Glåma is the longest at 372 miles (600 kilometers). The only other long river is the Tana-Anarjåkka, which extends 224 miles (360 kilometers) in the northeast along the border with Finland. In the west the steep slopes create a number of spectacular waterfalls. Norway has some 65,000 lakes with surface areas of at least 4 acres (1.5 hectares). The largest is Lake Mjøsa.\n\nClimate\n\nThe climate of Norway is much more temperate than its northern location suggests. The North Atlantic Current brings warm water from the Gulf of Mexico across the Atlantic Ocean to as far north as the Nordkapp. This current prevents ice from forming along the coast and keeps air temperature high in winter. The predominantly southwest winds bring much moisture from the ocean. Western Norway has a typical maritime climate, with cool summers and mild winters. Bergen on the west coast has an average temperature of roughly 34 °F (1.5 °C) in January and 58 °F (14.5 °C) in July. Annual rainfall averages 88 inches (225 centimeters). Oslo in the east has a colder average January temperature of approximately 24 °F (–4.3 °C) and a warmer July temperature of 61 °F (16.4 °C). Annual precipitation at Oslo is only 30 inches (76 centimeters), some of it snow.\n\nTemperatures in northern Norway are lower than in the south. However, even Tromsø at almost 70° N. latitude has winters milder than those in the U.S. region of New England at 45° N. Because of the tilt of Earth’s axis, during the summer the sun never dips below the horizon north of the Arctic Circle. This effect, called the midnight sun, results in 24 hours of daylight for Tromsø and all of northern Norway every day from about mid-May through mid-July. In the winter the opposite effect occurs—because of Earth’s tilt, the sun never rises above the horizon in the far north. The same area is shrouded in darkness between mid-November and mid-January in what is called the polar night. During the winter months, the northern skies are periodically graced by the spectacular light display known as the aurora borealis, or northern lights.\n\nPeople and Culture\n\nNorway is the most sparsely populated country in Europe, with roughly 40 persons per square mile (15 persons per square kilometer). About four-fifths of the population lives in urban centers.\n\nEthnic Groups and Religion\n\nThe majority of Norway’s people are of Nordic descent. The largest indigenous minority is the Sami (Lapps), a distinct ethnic group of European origin who live mainly in the north. There are about 40,000 Sami in Norway and smaller numbers in Sweden and Finland. The territory they inhabit, which includes regions of Sweden and Finland, is called Lapland.\n\nNorway has a large immigrant population, many of whom are foreign citizens. Among the largest communities are people from Iraq, Pakistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the United Kingdom, and the United States; there are also sizable groups of Swedes and Danes.\n\nEvangelical Lutheranism is the country’s official religion, and the majority of Norwegians belong to the national church of that religion, the Church of Norway. There are a number of other religious denominations in Norway, including small groups of other Protestants, Roman Catholics, Muslims, and Buddhists.\n\nLanguages\n\nNorwegian is the official language in Norway. The language belongs to the Germanic group of the Indo-European language family and is similar to Danish and Swedish. There are many dialects, and no form of the language is acceptable to all Norwegians. There are two official forms—Bokmål (“Book Language”) and Nynorsk (“New Norwegian”). The former is used in business and communications. It is the main language taught in most schools and is spoken mostly around urban centers. Nynorsk is spoken mainly in rural areas and along the west coast.\n\nEnglish is widely studied in school as a second language, and its usage, particularly in business, has become common. Many of the Sami people speak North Sami, though some groups living in central Norway speak South Sami. Both variations of Sami belong to the Finno-Ugric group of the Uralic language family. Sami is an official language in a number of Norwegian cities and towns.\n\nCulture\n\nNorway’s geographic position at the edge of the European continent helped maintain a national isolation until the 20th century. As a result, Norwegians were able to maintain a large amount of their folk heritage, though the traditions of seafaring and exploration brought fresh cultural ideas from abroad.\n\nAmong Norway’s most notable cultural traditions is that of storytelling and folklore. On many holidays, traditional costumes are worn and folk music is accompanied by robust singing. One of the most important national holidays is Grunnlovsdagen (Constitution Day) on May 17. It celebrates Norway’s independence and the adoption of its constitution. Other popular holiday festivals include Shrovetide, celebrated for three days before Lent and thus similar to Carnival and Mardi Gras; Sankhansaften (Midsummer’s Eve), celebrated on June 23; and Olsok (St. Olaf’s Day), celebrated on July 29.\n\nThe arts\n\nNorway has made valuable contributions to world culture in the fields of literature, music, and art. The oldest literature consists of tales of the old Norse gods, written in the 13th century. Norwegian settlers in Iceland composed sagas that dealt with the early history of Norway and Iceland. After that period, there was little significant Norwegian literary activity until the 18th century, when Norwegian-born writer Ludvig Holberg wrote plays, poems, and essays in Danish. In the 19th century Henrik Wergeland emerged as Norway’s greatest poet. He developed a national style, while Johan Welhaven, another prominent poet, retained Danish forms. In the 19th century the novelists Jonas Lie and Alexander Kielland and the playwrights and poets Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and Henrik Ibsen dominated the literary scene. Ibsen was one of the major figures in the development of modern European theater.\n\nProminent early modern novelists included Knut Hamsun, Sigrid Undset, and Olav Duun. Hamsun, Undset, and Bjørnson were awarded Nobel Prizes. In contemporary literature, Herbjørg Wassmo was the first Norwegian woman to win the Nordic Literature prize, an award created in 1961 to acknowledge excellence in literature from the Nordic countries. Wassmo received the 1987 award for her novel Hudløs Himmel (“Sensitive Sky”; 1986). Other popular modern authors include Bjørg Vik, Kim Småge, and Tor Åge Bringsværd. (See also Scandinavian literature.)\n\nThe Norwegian government funds many cultural activities, including theater and film. In addition to the National Theater in Oslo, Norway has a number of regional theaters. The national touring theater, Riksteatret, gives performances around the country. Plays are frequently presented on television, allowing people all over the country to experience theatrical performances. Among the most notable contemporary playwrights is Jon Fosse, whose plays are produced in Norway and around the world. The film industry produces roughly 10 feature films a year, mostly targeted to Norwegian audiences. Norwegian actress Liv Ullmann enjoyed an international reputation for her film work, especially from the 1960s and ’70s.\n\nMusic has a long tradition in Norway; archaeologists have uncovered bronze horns dating back as far as 500 bc. In the Middle Ages, Norwegian music was similar in many respects to that of central Europe. Gregorian chants and other liturgical forms were popular during this period. Norwegian music expanded in form after Norway’s alliance with Sweden in the 19th century, when visiting musicians played for the Swedish monarch when he visited the new capital of Oslo. The most famous Norwegian composer is Edvard Grieg, whose Peer Gynt Suite and piano concerto are popular internationally. Johan Svendsen had considerable influence on modern Norwegian classical music. Norway has many professional classical orchestras and chamber ensembles. The Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra enjoys an international reputation for excellence. The Bergen Philharmonic, established in 1758, is a primary component of the Bergen International Music Festival. A national opera company was established in 1958, in Oslo. Musical festivals in Oslo, Bergen, and other cities highlight a wide range of genres from jazz to hip hop.\n\nNorwegian art is less well known abroad. The leading painter is Edvard Munch, who influenced modern expressionist art. Many of his works are displayed in the Munch Museum in Oslo. During the 20th century, many Norwegian painters began working in murals, developing a style that is widely admired. Abstract art has become a dominant style among Norwegian painters. Many of Norway’s sculptors have received international recognition, particularly Gustav Vigeland, who is best known for his collection of sculptures at Frogner Park in Oslo.\n\nSports and recreation\n\nSports—especially winter sports—hold a special place in the national identity. Skiing in particular is a national pastime, though other winter games such as cross-country skiing and all forms of skating are popular. Norwegians have won more medals at the Winter Olympics than athletes from any other country, and Norway has twice hosted the Winter Games—at Oslo in 1952 and at Lillehammer in 1994. Among Norway’s most famous athletes was Sonja Henie, a figure skater who captured gold medals in 1928, 1932, and 1936 and then went on to a successful film career. Summer recreations such as hiking, mountain climbing, and sailing are also very popular. As crown prince, King Olaf V won an Olympic gold medal for yachting in 1928.\n\nEducation and Social Welfare\n\nEducation is free and compulsory between the ages of six and 16. Apart from primary and secondary schools, there are technical, art, and other vocational schools. Norway has four traditional universities—in Oslo, Bergen, Trondheim, and Tromsø—as well as the University of Stavanger, the Norwegian University of Life Sciences in Ås, and the University of Agder. The country also has many university colleges and state colleges. During the 1990s, Norway reorganized its system of higher education by linking all universities, university colleges, and state colleges into a single network.\n\nA national health insurance plan ensures that Norwegians receive free medical care in hospitals and compensation for medical office visits. Membership in the plan is mandatory for all residents. A well-established public health care system is in place, as are maternal and child care services. A public dental service provides care for children under age 18. A national pension plan was established in 1967 to pay an allowance to individuals following retirement or disability.\n\nEconomy\n\nNorway was once predominantly a country of farmers, fishers, foresters, and sailors. By the early 21st century, the petroleum and natural gas industries had become leading branches of the economy. Finance and other service industries are also important. Norway is a popular tourist destination, and the tourism industry employs many workers. In addition, many people work in government jobs.\n\nMining and Natural Resources\n\nNorway’s major resources are the sea, waterpower, and petroleum and natural gas. Almost every part of Norway is close to the sea or a fjord, and many Norwegians gain their livelihood from the water as fishers or sailors. The mountain rivers are ideal for the development of hydroelectric power, which produces almost all of the electricity in the country.\n\nPetroleum was first extracted from the Norwegian-controlled area of the North Sea in 1966. Production is much greater than that required for domestic consumption, and most of it is exported. Norway is one of the world’s largest suppliers of oil. Natural gas is also important to the country’s economy. The Troll natural gas field just west of Bergen is one of the largest offshore gas fields ever found. Soon after gas production began there in 1996, Norway became one of the world’s leading natural gas producers and exporters. Iron ore, copper, lead, zinc, magnesium, titanium, and nickel are found in small amounts in Norway, mainly in the north.\n\nManufacturing\n\nIndustrial development in Norway has been based mainly on inexpensive hydroelectric power. In the early 21st century, the country’s per capita production of hydroelectricity was the world’s highest. The country’s production of such metals as aluminum, copper, nickel, zinc, and titanium uses large amounts of electric power as does the manufacture of nitrogen for fertilizers and explosives. Norway is also a significant producer of iron-based alloys.\n\nOther industries in Norway include shipbuilding and the construction of oil-drilling platforms and hydroelectric-power equipment. The North Sea petroleum and natural gas industries created many jobs, including those in the manufacture of equipment and the provision of supplies and services. Factories in Norway also make food products, machinery, paper products, and other goods.\n\nAgriculture, Forestry, and Fishing\n\nOnly a small percentage of the labor force is employed in agriculture. Farming is difficult in Norway because of the mountainous terrain and the lack of good soils—only about 3 percent of the total land area is suitable for farming. Conditions are most suitable for grazing livestock and growing hay. The main crops are barley, potatoes, and wheat. The production of meat and dairy products is sufficient for the country’s needs, but most grains and vegetables are imported. Many of the farms are small, and most are owned by individual farmers. Cooperative societies market and process products and buy supplies of seeds and equipment.\n\nForestry is a major activity and is often carried out by farmers, who own much of the forest land. Much of the timber goes to the pulp and paper factories, which export much of their output.\n\nNorway’s tradition of fishing is a long-held one, and the country is one of the top fishing nations in Europe. Although the number of fishers working in Norway’s fishing industry declined during the late 20th century, the annual catch increased owing to improved methods and an expanded fishery zone. Fishing includes onshore fishing by farmers and others who live on the coast or a fjord and deep-sea fishing by modern trawlers and factory ships. Most of the catch is exported, especially frozen cod and canned sardines and herrings. Herrings also are turned into oil and fish meal.\n\nWhaling once played an important role in Norway’s economy. The practice became controversial in the 20th century as whale species worldwide dwindled in number because of overhunting. In 1968 Norway began limiting its whaling to smaller species of toothed whales. In the late 1980s and early 1990s Norway complied with the International Whaling Commission (IWC) total ban on commercial whaling. By the mid-1990s, however, the Norwegian government had gradually begun allowing limited catches of some species of whale, arguing that the whales were no longer endangered and that whaling did not pose a serious threat to fish populations. The latter argument was also used in defense of sealing. Both practices were sharply criticized by the international community, particularly conservation groups, leading to a sharp decline in both industries.\n\nTrade\n\nNorway’s main exports are petroleum, natural gas, machinery, metals, and fish. Its largest imports include machinery, motor vehicles, chemicals and chemical products, metal products, and food products, especially fruits and vegetables. Major trading partners include the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands.\n\nTransportation and Communications\n\nThe mountains and fjords of Norway make the building of railroads and highways difficult. The railroad between Oslo and Bergen passes through 182 tunnels. The fjords are crossed by a large number of ferries. Major routes from Oslo follow the valleys or the coast. The highway system was improved with funds from petroleum revenues. In 2000 the Lærdal-Aurland tunnel opened. Extending 15.2 miles (24.5 kilometers), it was the longest tunnel for motor vehicle traffic in the world and provided a reliable link between Oslo and Bergen during the winter.\n\nThere is much coastal shipping. Routes are sheltered by the string of islands along the coast. Norway’s merchant fleet is one of the largest in the world. Its services bring considerable wealth to the country. Because of the rugged terrain and often bad weather, Norway is not an ideal country for air transportation. The long distances between cities, however, have encouraged the development of domestic air services. Small planes land with floats on fjords and provide medical emergency service for isolated districts. Norway, along with Sweden and Denmark, is a member of Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), which pioneered the first polar-route flights from Europe to the United States and Japan. The major airports for international flights are located near Oslo, Stavanger, and Bergen.\n\nFor almost 50 years, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (Norsk Rikskringkasting, or NRK) had a monopoly on broadcasting in Norway. The network, which was founded in 1933, was run by the state. Every household with radio and television receivers paid an annual fee to the state. In the early 1980s, however, the state allowed private local radio stations to operate. These were soon followed by cable television channels. In 1992 a new television station, TV2, began broadcasting nationwide. Financed by commercial advertising, it soon became a success. The following year, radio broadcasting entered the commercial arena with the first national private station. In addition to its broadcast media, Norway has approximately 150 newspapers in circulation, about half of which are dailies. Freedom of the press is guaranteed by the Norwegian constitution.\n\nHistory\n\nHumans have lived in Norway for thousands of years. The oldest evidence of human occupation are stone tools dating from 9500 to 6000 bc. The earliest inhabitants were likely to have been hunters and fishers. The people who settled in eastern Norway between 3000 and 2500 bc, however, were farmers who grew grain and kept cows and sheep. About 1500 bc bronze was gradually introduced, though settlers continued to use stone tools as well as the new metal implements. There is evidence of contact with Roman-occupied Gaul by ad 400.\n\nVikings and Christianization\n\nThe period of recorded history in Norway begins about 900, when the Vikings established control over various districts under the leadership of their chiefs. The name Viking initially denoted a man from the area around the Vik, a bay extending from Cape Lindesnes in Norway to the mouth of the Göta River in Sweden. The Viking Age extended roughly from 800 to 1050. During this time, Scandinavian explorers set out on numerous expeditions by sea, sailing westward to invade and inhabit what is now Iceland, Greenland, the British Isles, and other islands in the North Atlantic. Some explorers traveled far enough to reach a previously unknown continent—what is now North America.\n\nMany battles ensued between the Viking districts. The last important fight took place sometime between 872 and 900, after which Harald I (Harald Fairhair) proclaimed himself king of Norway. He was succeeded by his son Erik I (Erik Bloodax—so named because he murdered seven of his eight brothers), who ruled from 930 to 935. He was deposed by his only living brother, Haakon I (Haakon Adalsteinsfostre), also known as Haakon the Good. Haakon had been reared as a Christian in England. When he returned to Norway to assume the throne he brought missionaries with him but was unsuccessful in convincing the Norwegians to convert. He died sometime around 960, murdered by his nephew Harald II (Harald Graycloak), one of Erik I’s sons who had taken refuge in Denmark following his father’s death.\n\nThe struggle to Christianize Norway continued following Harald II’s death. In 995 the throne was claimed by Olaf I (Olaf Tryggvason) who had been baptized in England during an expedition in 991. His efforts to impose Christianity were successful in many of the coastal settlements but not among the people inhabiting the interior. Olaf sent missionaries to neighboring islands as well as to Iceland and Greenland. His death in the Battle of Svolder (about 1000), as well as the battle itself, is recounted throughout Scandinavian folklore.\n\nAfter Olaf I’s death, Norway was ruled by foreign leaders until 1030, when it was united by Olaf II (Olaf Haraldsson), a descendant of Harald I. Olaf II was a Christian and completed the conversion of his people. He was declared a saint after his death in a battle with the Danes, who sought control of Norway.\n\nMiddle Ages\n\nThe 12th century began with a period of peace and prosperity, but by 1130 civil wars had broken out as various claimants to the throne arose. In 1217 Haakon IV Haakonsson ascended the throne and was a powerful ruler. He developed cultural and trade contacts with the rest of Europe. He also signed a treaty with the German city of Lübeck giving the Hanseatic League special rights to trade in Norway. Bergen became the league’s major port, and by 1300 all trade was in the hands of the Germans. This German monopoly led to an economic decline. In 1349 the plague, which was devastating the countries of Europe and the Middle East, reached Norway from England. The Black Death, as the epidemic was called, killed roughly two-thirds of the country’s population.\n\nUnion with Denmark and Sweden\n\nIn 1319 the death of Haakon V Magnusson ended the Norwegian royal line, and the throne went first to the Swedish and then to the Danish royal families. In 1380 Olaf, the son of Haakon VI of Norway and Margaret of Denmark, became king of both Norway and Denmark, a union that lasted for more than 400 years. At the death of her son, Margaret became queen, and by 1397 she had united Norway, Denmark, and Sweden in the Union of Kalmar. In 1523 Sweden left the union, while Norway came increasingly under Danish control and influence. Norway suffered in the conflicts between Sweden and Denmark and was on occasion invaded by Swedish armies. Danish shipping led to prosperity, but by the early 18th century the fleet had suffered losses from further fighting. By the end of the century the export of timber and the growing mining industry improved the economy.\n\nThe Napoleonic wars and the British blockade of Denmark, an ally of Napoleon, resulted in the isolation of Norway from Denmark and the virtual independence of Norway from 1809 to 1812. In 1814 Norway was taken from Denmark and annexed by Sweden. The Norwegians declared their independence and proclaimed a constitution. Sweden refused to recognize this act and invaded Norway, forcing the Norwegians to accept the union of the two countries. But the Norwegian constitution and a parliament were allowed to function, and in 1884 the parliament was recognized as the main governing body of the country. In 1905 Norway declared its independence from Sweden. Prince Charles of Denmark was offered the throne, which he accepted as Haakon VII.\n\nEconomic Growth and Depression\n\nThe period before World War I was one of prosperity. A railroad joining Oslo and Bergen was built with great difficulty, and a start was made on the development of waterpower resources. Norway declared itself neutral at the outbreak of the war. Large profits were made by carrying cargoes for the British despite considerable loss of life and ships. Political life was marked by the rise of the Labor (socialist) party. In 1913 women gained universal suffrage (the right to vote) and went on to play a key role in Norwegian politics.\n\nDuring earlier centuries Norway had lost control over most of the Atlantic islands, including Iceland, the Orkneys, and the Shetlands. In 1925 its sovereignty over the Svalbard archipelago was recognized on the condition that other countries have access to coal and other mineral deposits found there. In 1933 Norway yielded its rights in Greenland to Denmark. The international depression of the 1930s caused a rise in unemployment in Norway. In 1935 the country elected a Labor government. The Labor Party, which laid the foundation for the modern Norwegian welfare state, dominated the country’s politics for many years. It was the ruling party until the mid-1960s. Nevertheless, large segments of the Norwegian economy remained privately owned.\n\nWorld War II\n\nIn 1939 Norway announced its intention of remaining neutral in the event of a European war. But Norway did not remain neutral. After the outbreak of World War II, the British objected to the use of fjords and islands by German ships seeking shelter and began to mine Norwegian coastal waters. The Norwegians, who thought that their neutrality was most threatened by the British, were shocked when their country was invaded by Germany on April 9, 1940. The king and the government escaped to northern Norway and then to England, where a government in exile was established. Allied troops that had been sent to Norway to assist Norwegian resistance were evacuated from the northern port of Narvik. Most of the Norwegian merchant fleet was at sea and was able to join the Allies.\n\nIn Norway a pro-German government was set up with Vidkun Quisling, a Norwegian Nazi sympathizer, in charge. The Norwegians rejected Quisling as a leader, and an underground movement known as the Home Front remained in touch with the Norwegian government in London. In May 1945 Norway was liberated, and the German forces left. Quisling was tried for treason and executed.\n\nPostwar Period\n\nFollowing World War II, northern Norway suffered damage from retreating German troops. The economy of the country was in ruins. About half the merchant fleet had been sunk. A new Labor government undertook further development of waterpower and the establishment of new industries. Convinced that neutrality did not work, the Norwegians joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949. No foreign troops or nuclear weapons, however, are permitted on Norwegian soil.\n\nNorway’s trade position caused some problems. It rejected membership in a Nordic Common Market and instead in 1959 joined the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), of which the United Kingdom was then a member. In 1973 the United Kingdom left the association to join the European Economic Community (EEC), the forerunner of the European Union (EU). Norway did not follow. It continued as a partner in EFTA along with a few other countries.\n\nA New Prosperity\n\nThe revenues from the petroleum industry created great prosperity in the 1970s. Norway controlled extraction by maintaining a rate of production that would not exhaust deposits too quickly. Petroleum revenues were used not only to support the welfare state but also to ensure the development of industries that would support the economy after the petroleum deposits were exhausted.\n\nIn 1981 a Conservative government took office with Kaare Willoch as prime minister. It succeeded a Labor government headed by Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway’s first woman prime minister. The drop in oil prices in 1985 hit Norway hard and reduced revenues. In May 1986 Brundtland and a Labor government again came to power. Labor’s failure to win a majority in the 1989 elections brought Brundtland’s resignation that fall. Jan Peder Syse, leader of the Conservative Party, succeeded her as prime minister. He resigned the next year after a dispute over Norway’s relations with the European Economic Community. Brundtland was reinstated as prime minister and continued to hold the post until her resignation in 1996. Kjell Magne Bondevik, leader of the conservative Christian People’s Party, became prime minister following the 1997 parliamentary elections. Disagreements on energy issues brought Bondevik’s resignation in 2000; he was succeeded by Labor leader Jens Stoltenberg but returned to office following the 2001 elections. In a November 1994 referendum Norwegian voters rejected membership in the European Union (EU).\n\nOn July 22, 2011, a pair of terror attacks stunned Norway. First, a bomb exploded in central Oslo, seriously damaging government buildings and killing at least seven people. Hours later, a gunman disguised as a police officer opened fire on a Labor Party youth camp on the island of Utøya, roughly 25 miles (40 kilometers) from Oslo. The gunman killed more than 65 people during an hour-long attack. Police arrested a suspect in the shooting and stated that the two attacks were linked. The suspect was found guilty at trial and sent to prison.\n\nMeanwhile, at the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century, Norway had begun to play an increasingly active role in world affairs. It acted as a mediator in some international disputes and participated in NATO missions.
