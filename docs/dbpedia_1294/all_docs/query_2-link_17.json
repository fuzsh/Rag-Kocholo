        "text": "France’s Ligue de Football Professionel (LFP) this week struck an 11th hour deal for #Ligue1 rights that pleases no-one and may well be revisited a couple of years down the line – a continuation of the LFP’s ongoing story of a hand-played-badly in search of a billion. · #DAZN and #beINSports will split the rights (with DAZN taking the lion’s share) in a €500m a year (domestic rights) deal that falls dramatically short of the €1bn consistently cited as a target by LFP pres. Vincent Labrune. · The pair (and the LFP) have sought an exit clause that could be triggered after the first couple of years if things don’t work out (with the league still doubtless dreaming of a bigger overall take). · The deal as it stands shows the LFP’s threat of going it alone (or in partnership with Warner Bros. Discovery) with its own platform to has been an empty one – not enough time, too much risk, an unviable model. Nasser Al-Khelaïfi, straddling the two sides as pres. of both PSG and beIN Media, appears to have opted for the certainty of the agreement rather than the high-risk option. · DAZN now stands as a bigger presence than ever in premium football – with shared rights in Spain and Italy and its battle with the Bundesliga – despite scepticism in some quarters over the viability of its long-term business model. · Scepticism also abounds in France. Dissenting RC Lens pres. Joseph O. has pointed out that fans are now expected to have to pay around €50 a month for comprehensive match coverage, against around €35 under Amazon and Canal+, while the clubs are worse off than before. · The LFP once again has been a victim of the hubris that led it down the path to its disastrous pact with Mediapro. Enviously eyeing the amounts commanded by peers in neighbouring countries failed to produce bids to match, with a go-it-alone option convincing no-one. The revenge of twice-bitten Canal+, growing its business despite a much-reduced football presence and notable by its absence from the bidding this time round, is complete.\n\nWhat is happening in football? It has become winner takes all. And the winner is the Premier League and by \"all\" we mean \"America.\" For many in the US, the Premier league is world football. How far is the Premier League pulling ahead of rival European leagues? This far, says today's FT: \"The Premier League has cracked the US. While its domestic rights may be faltering, England’s top division currently pulls in £1.8bn per season for overseas broadcast rights, including £333mn in the US. \"This completely blows its European rivals out of the water, and is a key part of its £2bn per season advantage over its nearest rival in annual broadcast revenues. \"Such a gulf explains why when Norwich City finished in last place in the 2021-22 Premier League, they earned more broadcast revenue for their league appearances than Bayern Munich, AC Milan or Paris St Germain, the German, Italian and French champions. \"The Premier League’s pulling power is so great that across the whole of Europe only Barcelona and Real Madrid made more money from televised league games than England’s bottom-ranked team, with the result that the biggest clubs on the continent now increasingly find themselves outbid on transfers not only by fellow giants but also by Premier League minnows.\" #premierleague #tvrights #TV\n\nNothing breeds a following quite like success \"The BBC has reported its latest coverage of the England’s semi-final match against Australia during the FIFA Women's World Cup Australia & New Zealand 2023™ had A peak TV audience of 7.3 million views on its linear channel...The football game was also streamed 3.8 million times on the video-on demand platform BBC iPlayer and BBC Sport Online. While match highlights and clips of the game were streamed 2.7 million times across the broadcaster’s digital platforms.\" The record is likely to be surpassed at the weekend with the final between England and Spain, and I'm sure it will do amazing things for women's football and women's sport in general. In England, interest in Women's Football peaked last year with the win in the Euro 2022, with the Lioness' received multiple mentions including from MPs in the British Parliament. It will mean more money for #broadcast and viewing rights, which will increase the visibility, and therefore interest further. Finally, it goes to show why #livebroadcast remains unique in the age of #streaming and #vodplatforms and outperforms streaming and catchup clips, because there's nothing quite like watching and living the story in real time. #womensfootball #fifawomensworldcup #television #broadcastmedia #tvindustry #liveevents #livetv https://lnkd.in/dh5envvZ\n\nUEFA is considering an expansion of the Women's Champions League amid concerns that the current format may be holding the tournament back from its full potential. Changes were introduced for the 2021-22 season, including the addition of a Group Stage with four groups of four teams each, along with consolidated media rights to make the tournament more marketable to spectators and sponsors. This move aimed to align the women's competition more closely with the men's. In the United States, DAZN covers Women's UEFA Champions League games. The discussion about the tournament's long-term viability has gained traction due to the early elimination of big clubs, which could lead to financial losses.
