        "text": "Public broadcaster NRK is the media organisation with the highest reach and trust rating among Norwegians. Its flagship TV and radio channels are market leaders.\n\nUntil 2022, 94% of its funding came from a compulsory licence fee payable by TV owners. Since then, it has been funded from the state budget through a dedicated NRK tax.\n\nThe commercial sector is dominated by Oslo-based international media group Schibsted, the publisher of leading national dailies Aftenposten and VG, regional papers and online platforms, and by the TV2 Group owned by Copenhagen-based Egmont Fonden, the operator of the largest commercial TV channel.\n\nNorwegians are among the world's most avid newspaper readers. In recent years there has been a significant decline in the readerships of print editions and a rise in the number of subscriptions to online newspapers.\n\nNorway's media are viewed as among the freest in the world. The country regularly tops the annual Reporters Without Borders (RSF) World Press Freedom Index.\n\nNorway is one of the world's most connected countries. There were almost 5.4 million internet users by July 2022, comprising 98% of the population (Worldinternetstats.com). Facebook has by far the biggest share of social media traffic."
