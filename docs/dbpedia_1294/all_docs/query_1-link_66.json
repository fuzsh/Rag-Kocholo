        "text": "Since emerging in Britain during the 1920s, public service broadcasting [PSB] has taken root in Western societies characterised by democratic institutions and pluralistic values. This pattern is beginning to change. Despite significant differences in its political conditions and policies, since 2006 the central government of the People’s Republic of China has undertaken construction of a PSB system of its own. The result, as described in this article, is a new form of top-down public communications network with similarities to both Chinese and European precedents. Coinciding with the new emphasis placed by the Chinese state on public cultural service [PCS], a vigorous academic debate has also emerged concerning how basic cultural rights, such as equal access to state-owned media in both urban and rural locations, should be guaranteed and protected. Academic researchers and state officials seem to agree that China’s PSB system plays an important role in achieving such aims, and advocate the establishment and expansion of a system attuned to China’s social conditions. These developments come at a time when public service media [PSM] around the world face serious economic challenges that have been exacerbated by global recession. We note in contrast that the Chinese state is beginning to take initiatives in major urban areas to extend PSB and other public information services (e.g. digital information resources, museums, and libraries) to citizens, and that PSB will likely continue to expand there as a result. These developments raise interesting questions concerning the origins and role of PSB within an ostensibly authoritarian society, and the extent to which media’s public service functions can co-exist with a state-owned broadcasting sector. Here we address these questions by first examining normative conceptions of PSB in Western Europe – the cradle of its emergence – and China. In our view, debate over the meanings and goals of PSB can explain, if not predict, the shape of public media within a variety of historical and national contexts. We begin by addressing questions of fundamental importance: which functions of PSB are given precedence at the expense of others? To what ends are these functions intended? Next we summarise the policy environment and other key conditions that are giving rise to PSB as a sector in China. We conclude with examination of PSB expansion in the local context to add an empirical perspective on the state’s normative rhetoric. Throughout the chapter we consider the degree to which PSB is sustainable in China, and argue that the answer is wholly dependent on how one defines ‘public’ within an authoritarian context, and whether institutional and fiscal support for this new concept will continue in the period of China’s next Five-Year Plan and beyond. As we demonstrate, although initiative for the development of PSB has been predominantly generated by the state, opening this door has allowed a range of actors to enter into debates concerning the legitimacy of individual cultural, political, and civil rights – all under the rubric of public service. This, in turn, gives rise to the possibility that although PSM in China remains state-controlled, its function and content are not solely determined by the central government. There is possibility that PCS policies in China may not only create new publics but also new public media advocates, whose borrowing from a range of international models may yet revive interest in Europe’s embattled sector. Indeed, many familiar debates concerning how to balance PSM independence with political and financial viability are now taking place in China today. Gaining the initiative there may have something useful to contribute to discussion about regaining the initiative elsewhere.\n\nThis thesis is a study of public service broadcasting facing a digital media system. Its focus is on internet services since the mid-1990s. With a comparative design, the thesis discusses how public service broadcasters seized opportunities and handled challenges related to the internet, and how national and supranational regulatory regimes and policy actors coped with public service broadcasting venturing online. I concentrate on publicly owned former monopolists, assessing four such institutions in three states: the British BBC, Norway’s NRK, and the ARD and the ZDF in Germany. I argue that traditional practices of media policy do not suddenly change in the digital era. Rather, settings for public service are to a large extent still defined within well-established frameworks, and dependent on the conditioned legacies of each state’s political culture. Discussing similarities and differences in the development of the institutions’ internet activities, and their corresponding national regulations, I find the development characterized by ad hoc solutions. This also applies to the EU policy regime, built on a competition law-logic. With the latter regime, I argue, we are incapable of grasping the autonomous democratic functions of public broadcasters’ online services. Moreover, the regime pro- vides insufficient space to play out national differences. The thesis goes on to explore the democratic functions of public broadcasting institutions in an online environment. With a founding in normative public sphere theory, I contend that there is a potential in online communication not only for dialogue, but also for dissemination. Both communicative forms should be utilized by public service actors in ways that consistently counter processes of enclosure and balkanization in the public sphere. On this basis, I develop a scheme for public service media online. By scrutinizing marginal parts of the cases’ internet activities I lastly explore this scheme, and the limits of public broadcasters’ publicly funded online offers. Thereby, I aim to revitalize discussions about the functions of public service as a media policy tool in the digital era. In my view, public service media remain relevant. The thesis substantiates why, and outlines how.\n\nThrough online services, the Scandinavian public service broadcasters have managed to retain strong positions as public service media (PSM) among the audiences in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Social and political changes in the Scandinavian populations influence the ways PSM involve themselves in conflicts that relate to religion. The growing cultural and religious diversity of the Scandinavian countries, along with digitalization and commercialization, shape PSM publics with varying, and perhaps conflicting, interests and needs. This has put the PSM under political pressure to alter their programming. On the one hand, their obligation to provide a common, and perhaps even a unifying , public space for the whole nation, in some cases, has become more pronounced. On the other hand, they are encouraged to take into account the multi-plicity of voices and subcultures that exist among their audiences and users. Public service media (PSM) occupy a strong position in the Scandinavian countries and they continue to play important roles in the dissemination of information and discussions about issues of public interest and contestation involving religion. In some cases, PSM may become the subject of such conflicts when controversies develop around the representation of religion. Our empirical analyses concerning the roles of PSM in such conflicts are spelled out in detail in the subsequent three chapters, with a case study from each of the three countries. 'Public service media' are national 'broadcasting' corporations that have developed a presence on the Internet alongside 'linear' radio and television transmissions. PSM companies may be commercially or publicly funded. In both cases, they have a public mandate that is derived from the national parliaments, and they report their activity to national bodies. The purpose of this chapter is threefold. Firstly, we will characterize the historical origins and institutional contexts of the present Scandinavian public service organizations and their obligations, and compare these to other media systems. Secondly, we consider the contemporary challenges that PSM face in view of both a changing media environment and a more diverse population, OpenAccess.\n\nThis article investigates how the communicative relationship between public broadcasters and their audiences is being cultivated through new possibilities for participation offered by new technology. The aim, in the first part of the article, is to examine the strategic functions of multi-platform participation for public service broadcasting ( PSB). In order to analyse how programming that has strong associations with the commercial sector is constructed within the context of PSB, the second part presents a case study of the multi-platform format Test the Nation. The article engages with current debates on the role of PSB in a changing technological environment and explores the dilemma faced by public service broadcasters caught between attracting large audiences while also representing an alternative to the commercial channels. The article draws on analysis of institutional documents from the British BBC, the Swedish SVT, the Norwegian NRK and the US PBS. The documents range from official policy documents and mission statements to press releases and homepages, assembled between 2004 and 2006. The document analysis sheds light on the emergence of audience participation as a strategy for institutional legitimacy and platform expansion, as well as a way to develop new sources of revenue. A basic finding is that audience participation is a central strategy in the media companies under scrutiny. The `Reithian trinity', through several decades, has been in a process of redefinition, and the article suggests that public service broadcasting in the digital era may best be described as `entertainment, education and participation'.\n\nEuropean public broadcasters have long since ceased to be solely publicly financed. But the inherently controversial licence fee on television sets has remained a key source of funding. Facing an increasingly complex digital media environment, public service providers have expanded beyond traditional broadcast radio and television to embrace digital technologies and correlated fields of activity. Because the legitimacy of public funding is closely connected to specific characteristics of broadcasting, t his development encourages the search for alternative sources of income. The potential transformation from public service broadcasting to public service media thus compels a thorough discussion of institutional funding schemas. The chapter concentrates on elements of, and attitudes towards, commercial funding and arrangements that promote enclosure within and across media platforms. Relying on a comparative approach, I analyze how the strategies of public service broadcasters in three Western European nations correspond to their differing social and political contexts. The selected cases are Germanyʼs ARD and ZDF, the BBC in the UK and Norwayʼs NRK. The first part of the chapter concentrates on how shared challenges related to commercial funding and enclosure have been applied in different national settings from the preparations for the digital era until 2007. Mapping findings across contexts facilitates a discussion of the second main issue raised in this chapter: what do different strategies imply for the legitimacy of public broadcastersʼ funding schemas?"
