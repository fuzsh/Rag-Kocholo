It is also informed by fieldwork carried out in nursing homes in Canada, the UK, the US and Sweden, adding an international, comparative dimension to our analysis. COVID-19 has made clear the urgent necessity of opening up nursing homes, in Norway and elsewhere. This unbracketing furthermore implies opening up for wider social relationships and for beneficial forms of unpaid work from families and friends. However, and in alignment with other chapters in this volume, this is a benefit that should add to, as opposed to replace, paid care work.",

        "text": "This chapter offers an analysis based on ethnographic research in six Norwegian nursing homes with different degrees and forms of integration into local communities, with community understood as the local neighbourhood, a village or a city. In addition to the Norwegian research undertaken in the five years before the pandemic, the analysis is informed by fieldwork carried out in nursing homes in Canada, the UK, the US and Sweden, adding an international, comparative dimension to our analysis.\n\nExploring the boundaries between the outside and inside of care homes, we show the importance of the permeability of these boundaries not only to residents, families and staff, but also to the wider community. These boundaries are particularly relevant to those crossing them when moving into the care home, and to the family members and significant others accompanying them (see Chapter 2). More broadly, exploring these boundaries entails investigating the presence and significance of the outside community in the nursing homes, and of the nursing homes in the outside community. With this as a starting point, we ask if, how and to what degree nursing homes can constitute forms of ‘community’ themselves, influencing and being influenced by the wider community. We argue that the nature of the boundaries has consequences for forms of unpaid work in nursing homes, both in terms of what this work entails and where it is performed.\n\nWe focus on the cultural, social and physical dimensions of the boundaries of the six institutions. As Chapter 1 puts it, the people who live in nursing homes represent some of the most vulnerable in our society, providing a way to assess the economic, political, cultural and social conditions of the larger society, as well as its values. We argue that a high level of protective measures in nursing homes, resulting in solidifying their boundaries to make them less permeable, will increase vulnerability among residents. Even the nicest natural surroundings cannot compensate for social isolation and for the absence of the non-professional care of families and friends."
