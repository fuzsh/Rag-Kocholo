        "text": "Norwegian public-service broadcaster NRK will show all athletics events taking place at the Paris 2024 Olympics, including marathon, triathlon, and racewalking.\n\nWith Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) holding pan-European rights for the 2024 Olympics, NRK struck an agreement with WBD to show live coverage of all athletics events, airing them on NRK1 and NRK TV – along with the opening and closing ceremonies.\n\nWBD will broadcast all events from the French capital on its streaming service Max, in addition to providing broad Olympic coverage on TVNorge.\n\nEirik Fure, Jann Post, Ole Rolfsrud, and Ida Nysæter are some of NRK’s presenters and hosts who will cover the Olympics for NRK.\n\nIda Nysæter Rasch will be the host at the Stade de France while Jann Post, Vebjørn Rodal, and Christina Vukicevic Demidov will commentate on the athletics events. Fredrik Solbu Jullumstrø will report from the French capital.\n\nIn the evenings, Ole Rolfsrud and Eirik Fure will host magazine show “OL i Paris” (Olympics in Paris) which will provide a summary of the day’s action.\n\nNRK will have extensive coverage of the Games on all platforms. Those in Norway will be able to follow everything happening during the Olympics on NRK.no, in addition to coverage on NRK Radio. Also, a new podcast will premiere on NRK Radio. In “OL-gull” (Olympic Gold), Jan Petter Saltvedt and Atle Andersen will reflect on some of the greatest moments in Olympic history.\n\n“The Olympics are the definitive highlight of sports, and we are incredibly happy to be part of this again,” says Espen Olsen Langfeldt, sports editor at NRK.\n\n“The Norwegian public loves athletics, and we are very pleased that this will be shown on NRK. At the same time, we will broadcast live from the entire Olympics on NRK Radio, and online we will closely follow the news. We are really looking forward to this.”\n\nHanif Hosseini, project manager for the Olympics at Warner Bros. Discovery in Norway, adds: “The Paris Olympics will be a fantastic celebration for everyone involved, and on Max, the Norwegian Olympic audience will get every single moment and event from the summer’s great adventure in Paris.\n\n“To ensure the best experience for Norwegian viewers, we will also broadcast 16 hours of the Olympics every day on TVNorge. Already the day before the opening ceremony, on June 25, we kick off with broadcasts when Norway’s handball women face Sweden in the group stage.”\n\nWith 3,800 hours of live action from Paris 2024, TVNorge and Max, along with Eurosport, will provide coverage of every live moment of the Games for viewers in Norway.\n\nLive from Warner Bros. Discovery House, located in the heart of Paris, Susanne Jørstad Wergeland will host the morning broadcasts on TVNorge and Max.\n\nBetween the live sports broadcasts, there will be studio shows throughout the Olympic day, focusing on the Norwegian athletes but also providing broader coverage with the latest news, big stories, interviews, reports, and analyses.\n\nFor the afternoon broadcasts, the studio in Paris will be replaced by the Olympic studio in Oslo, hosted by Gita Simonsen and Jan Ove Kjøndal. Both have worked on Olympic broadcasts for Warner Bros. Discovery before."
