        "text": "Belgium's Olympic committee announced on Sunday that it would withdraw its team from the mixed relay triathlon at the Paris Olympics after one of its competitors who swam in the Seine fell ill.\n\nClaire Michel, who competed in the women's triathlon on Wednesday, \"is unfortunately ill and will have to withdraw from the competition,\" the Belgian Olympic and Interfederal Committee said in a statement.\n\nParis Olympic organizers had no immediate comment.\n\nThe mixed relay triathlon is scheduled to take place on Monday, with the swim portion of the competition slated for the Seine as well. The statement did not elaborate on Michel's illness, but it comes after concerns over the river's water quality.\n\nOrganizers had said that water quality tests done the day of the individual triathlon races showed \"very good\" bacteria levels.\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria, including E. coli, in the Seine's waters. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive assign qualitative values to a range of E. coli levels.\n\nUnder World Triathlon's guidelines, E. coli levels up to 1,000 colony-forming units per 100 millilitres can be considered \"good\" and can allow competitions to go forward.\n\nWorld Triathlon's medical committee said it considers water quality analysis, sanitary inspection and the weather forecast when determining whether to go forward with a race. The decisions are made at early-morning meetings on the day of an event.\n\nLeading up to the individual triathlon events in Paris, water quality concerns prompted organizers to cancel the swimming portion of two test runs meant to allow athletes to familiarize themselves with the course and also to delay the men's race by a day. Test swims in the Seine scheduled for Saturday and Sunday before the triathlon mixed relay were also cancelled because of bacteria levels in the water.\n\nOrganizers have said that if the water quality is not acceptable for Monday's triathlon mixed relay, they can postpone it until Tuesday. If concerns persist, the plan is to skip the swimming leg and have athletes compete only in the biking and running portions.\n\nThe Belgian committee said it \"hopes that lessons will be learned for future triathlon competitions at the Olympic Games. We are thinking here of the guarantee of training days, competition days and the competition format, which must be clarified in advance and ensure that there is no uncertainty for the athletes, entourage and supporters.\"\n\nSwiss, Norwegian triathletes also fell ill\n\nSwiss officials said Saturday that triathlete Adrien Briffod, who also competed in the Seine on Wednesday, fell ill with a stomach infection. But they said it was \"impossible to say\" whether it was linked to the swim and that the other delegations told them none of their triathletes had reported stomach problems.\n\nSwiss officials said in an update on Sunday that Simon Westermann, who had been tapped to replace Briffod, also had to withdraw because of a gastrointestinal infection. Westermann had not participated in any swims in the Seine, the statement said.\n\nThe Swiss team still planned to compete in the mixed relay on Monday, the statement said.\n\nNorwegian triathlete Vetle Bergsvik Thorn got sick a day after competing in the men's triathlon. Thorn told Norwegian broadcaster NRK that he woke up the next day with an upset stomach and was vomiting but thought that the likely cause was food poisoning. He said he felt better later that day and was planning to compete again in the mixed relay scheduled for Monday.\n\nArild Tveiten, the sports director of the Norwegian Triathlon Federation, said the cause of Thorn's illness was unclear.\n\n\"We're thinking what everyone is thinking: that it's probably the river. But we don't know. It could be the river, it could be the chicken,\" Tveiten told NRK. \"The doctor is leaning toward the possibility of food poisoning. That's what the symptoms suggest.\"\n\nMarathon swimming events are set to be held in the Seine on Thursday and Friday.\n\nFive of the eight swimmers in the men's 1,500-metre freestyle on Sunday night were listed to be entered in the 10-kilometre marathon swim.\n\nBronze medallist Daniel Wiffen of Ireland, who earlier won a gold in the 800-metre freestyle, said he wouldn't train ahead of time in the Seine. \"I don't want to try to deal with any illness.\"\n\nHe said he would instead train in pools around Paris, even if it means \"going in blind.\""
