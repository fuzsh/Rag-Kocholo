        "text": "The 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris is currently being televised by a number of broadcasters throughout the world. As with previous years, Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS) is producing the world feed provided to local broadcasters for use in their coverage.[1] In most regions, broadcast rights to the 2022 and 2024 Olympics were packaged together, but some broadcasters obtained rights to further games as well.\n\nBroadcasters\n\n[edit]\n\nIn France, domestic rights to the 2024 Summer Olympics are owned by Warner Bros. Discovery (formerly Discovery Inc.) via Eurosport, with free-to-air coverage sub-licensed to the country's public broadcaster France Télévisions.[2]\n\nThe official Olympics website offers both live-streaming and recent recordings of the events in selected markets, particularly in Brazil, Russia (due to Russian broadcasters pulling out), and the Indian subcontinent.[3]\n\nRussian broadcasting rights issue\n\n[edit]\n\nAlthough the IOC lists Telesport Russia as the nominal rights holder for Russia,[4] the main Russian and Belarusian broadcasters are not officially showing the Games in protest of the sanctions imposed on the two countries, which led to a reduced quota of 32 athletes that are listed as neutrals: Belarus and Russia last refused to purchase the broadcasting rights in 1984.[5][6] The Associated Press noted on 27 July 2024 that Belarusian and Russian viewers are depending on satellite channels and streaming services of neighbouring countries (such as Kazakhstan) to get reasonable coverage of the Games.[7]\n\nServer crash on the Taiwanese streaming platform\n\n[edit]\n\nChunghwa Telecom, which gained exclusive IPTV and streaming rights from Olympics domestic rights holder ELTA TV, reported that their streaming platform Hami Video experienced server crashes for the last 2 games during the men's double badminton knockout stage. Once when the Chinese Taipei male duos (Lee Yang and Wang Chi-lin) successfully advanced to the gold medal matches,[8] and then again when they successfully won the gold medals as the viewership for the game grows rapidly.[9]\n\nList of broadcast rights holders by territory\n\n[edit]\n\nTerritory Rights holder Ref Afghanistan ATN [10] Albania RTSH [11] Algeria EPTV [12] Andorra RTVA [13] Argentina [14][15] Armenia ARMTV [16] Asia Dentsu[i] [17] Australia Nine [18][19] Austria ORF [20] Azerbaijan İTV [21] Barbados CBC [22] Belgium [23][24] Bolivia Bolivisión [25] Bosnia and Herzegovina BHRT [26] Brazil\n\nRede Globo\n\nCazéTV\n\nOlympics.com\n\n[3][27][28] Brunei RTB [29] Bulgaria BNT [30] Burkina Faso RTB [31] Cambodia CBS [32] Cameroon CRTV [33] Canada [34][35][36] Cape Verde RTC [37] Caribbean SportsMax [38] Chile Chilevisión [39][40] China [41][42][43][44] Chinese Taipei [45][46][47] Costa Rica Repretel [48] Croatia HRT [49] Colombia [50][51] Cuba ICRT [52] Cyprus CyBC [53] Czech Republic ČT [54] Denmark [55] Dominican Republic Antena 7 [56] Ecuador\n\nRTS\n\nTVC\n\n[57] El Salvador Canal 12 [58] Estonia Postimees Group [59] Ethiopia EBC [60] Europe Eurosport[iv] [61] Fiji Fiji TV [62] Finland Yle [63] France France Télévisions [2] Georgia GPB [64] Germany [65] Ghana Sporty TV [66] Greece ERT [67] Guatemala Chapín TV [68] Guinea RTG [69] Honduras VTV [70] Hong Kong [71] Hungary MTVA [72] Iceland RÚV [59] India Doordarshan [73][4] Indian subcontinent\n\nViacom18\n\nOlympics.com\n\n[74][4] Indonesia Emtek [75] Ireland RTÉ [76] Israel Sports Channel [77] Italy RAI [78] Ivory Coast RTI [79] Jamaica TVJ [80] Japan [81][82] Kazakhstan [83] Kenya KBC [84] Kosovo RTK [16] Kyrgyzstan KTRK [85] Latin America[v] [86][87] Latvia LTV [88] Liberia LBS [89] Lithuania TV3 [59] Luxembourg RTL [90] Macau TDM [91] Malaysia [92][93][94] Maldives ICE Network [95] MENA beIN Sports [96] Mexico TelevisaUnivision [97] Moldova TVR [98] Mongolia\n\nPremier Sports Network\n\nCentral TV\n\n[99][100] Montenegro RTCG [101] Morocco SNRT [102] Mozambique TVM [103] Myanmar Forever Group [104] Netherlands NOS [105] New Zealand Sky Television [106] Nicaragua Canal 10 [107] Nigeria Sporty TV [66] North Korea KCTV [108] North Macedonia MRT [109] Norway NRK[vi] [110] Pacific Islands[vii] Sky Pacific [106][111] Pakistan ARY [112] Panama TVMax [113] Paraguay SNT [114] Papua New Guinea EM TV [115] Peru Grupo ATV [116] Philippines [117][118] Poland TVP [119] Portugal RTP [120] Qatar Alkass Sports [121] Romania TVR [122] Russia Olympics.com [4] Saint Lucia HTS [123] Samoa SBC [124] Senegal RTS [125] Serbia RTS [59] Seychelles SBC [126] Singapore [127] Slovakia STVR [128] Slovenia RTV [59] Solomon Islands Solomon Telekom [129] South Africa [130] South Korea [131][132] Spain RTVE [59] Sri Lanka ThePapare TV [133] Sub-Saharan Africa [134][130][135] Sweden Kanal 5 [136] Switzerland SRG SSR [137] Tajikistan Varzish TV [138] Tanzania ZBC2 [139] Thailand [140][141] Timor-Leste Olympics.com [4] Togo TVT [142] Trinidad and Tobago TTT [143] Turkey TRT [144] Turkmenistan Olympics.com [4] Uganda NBS Sport [145] Ukraine Suspilne [146] United Kingdom BBC [147] United States NBCUniversal [148][149] Uruguay [150] Uzbekistan MTRK [151] Venezuela TVES [152] Vietnam VTV[viii] [153] Zambia ZNBC [154]\n\nNotes"
