If you want to watch NRK TV in Australia, using a premium VPN to get a Norwegian IP address is the easiest method.\n\nGet PureVPN 31 days refund policy\n\nNRK TV does not work in Australia because it uses geo-restrictions to comply with licensing and distribution agreements. If you try to access NRK TV from any other country, you wonâ€™t be able to stream anything and will be shown an error message.\n\nWith a VPN on your device, you can quickly replace your original IP address with one from Norway. In this way, you can make NRK TV think you are located in Norway and gain access to its amazing content library.\n\nYou could try, but we do not recommend it. It may be difficult to find a free VPN offering a Norway server. Even if you do come across one, it is important to remember that most free VPNs lack must-have security features, follow questionable data collection practices, and enforce bandwidth limitations.\n\nYou can easily get a Norwegian IP address by connecting to a Norway server using PureVPN. Once connected, your IP address will be automatically switched with a Norway one, so you can stream NRK TV from anywhere in the world."
