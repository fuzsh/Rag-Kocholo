        "text": "BLINK is one of the longest-running city events in summer biathlon and cross-country, originating in 2006. It has grown from a made-for-TV sports event to a long weekend filled with multiple broadcasts, concerts, clinics, brunch, kid's activities, and the centrepiece… according to Sports Director Arne Idland, “the best athletes in the world!” And it is all free!\n\nIdland continued, “We always say that our most important BLINK customer is not particularly interested in biathlon or cross country! The people who are really interested in the sports will come anyway…So we give the other people many good reasons to spend a week at home in the holiday period.”\n\nOne of the world’s largests Summer Ski Events\n\nOver four days, the event hosts 2500 youth-to-world -class athletes from 25 counties, producing multiple competitions while closing three days with major music concerts. This year, the four big biathlon powers Norway, France, Sweden and Germany will all have athletes at the start.\n\nPopular Lysebotn Opp\n\nDespite getting to the big hill by boat and then suffering the 10% gradient, “Lysebotn Opp has a unique place in the hearts among the world’s best skiers, the spectators present in Lysebotn and the TV viewers. It is among the most popular TV products on NRK every summer!”\n\nNRK: Key Driving Force\n\nSince the beginning in 2006, the key driving force behind Blink has been Norway’s NRK TV with the support of the Norwegian Biathlon Federation. The late NRK sports anchor Kjell Kristian Rike designed the whole Blink program that has become the successful TV-product we can see today. \"NRK always send their best people. I think it is correct to say that Blink is a result of NRK’s high sports standard in cross country and biathlon!”\n\nFree Event Anomaly\n\nBLINK is an anomaly in today’s world as Idland reiterated. “The key success factor behind BLINK is that everything is for free. Had we done it differently and sold tickets BLINK would have been history many years ago!”\n\nAfter 18 years of nail-biting competitions, with names like Fourcade, Bjoerndalen. Fillon Maillet, Boe, Eckhoff and Olsbu Roeiseland coming to Sandnes, Idland admits a singular stand-out moment. “I was really proud when we managed to arrange BLINK in the summer of 2020 when everything was prohibited and impossible in Norway due to the Covid-19 restrictions!”\n\nThis year’s Blinkfestivalen runs from 31 July – 2 August.\n\nPhotos: IBU/Christian Manzoni, Blinkfestivalen/ Ørjan Dalseth, Asgeir Ravndal, Hans Lie"
