        "text": "Vizrt is the leader in real-time graphics and live production solutions for content creators.\n\nWith a 25-year history of inventing new simplified workflows for storytelling whether it is in the news, sports, broadcast, education, entertainment, live events, digital media, advertising, or anywhere else video lives, Vizrt has helped define and reshape the way video is created and shared with the world.\n\nBillions of people watch stories or video powered by Vizrt everyday including from media companies such as Al Arabiya, Al Jazeera, BBC, CNN, CBS, ESPN, FOX, NBC, NHL, NFL, NRK, Sky Group, The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, New York Giants, Nickelodeon, CBS Radio, ESPN Radio, MTV, USA TODAY, U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), NASA, PWC, and more than 80% of the U.S. Fortune 100.\n\nWhat would you say about the Insiders API integration process?\n\n“Sensors offer vital information on an athlete’s performance from heartrate to speed – information that is contained in the Insiders API. The new Insiders Data Connector allows sports content creators to add another layer of data that matters to audiences to their Viz Flowics graphics in a fast, simple and efficient way.” Viz Flowics co-founder, Gabriel Baños.\n\nWhat are the advantages of integrating the Insiders API?\n\nIncorporating a new native integration with the Insiders API is one more step forward in our mission at Viz Flowics to simplify the production of data-driven graphics to enhance storytelling.\n\nPosition, timing, distance between athletes, performance, heartrate, acceleration, endurance – all this information adds another layer of interesting, sport relevant information to data-driven storytelling. Sports fans thrive on data, and data from wearables gives them a deeper understanding and insight into the performance levels of elite athletes. This is a whole new level of information access – making for an even more intimate engagement with the sport and the individual athletes.\n\nHow do you use the Insiders real-time data in your graphics?\n\nInsiders API is integrated directly into Viz Flowics, available as a native Data Connector in our catalog.\n\nIf enabled in the use accounts, shared customers of Viz Flowics and Insiders can use the connector by simply selecting the ‘Insiders Data Connector’ to get access to individual athlete data gathered via their wearables. It’s that simple.\n\nHow do you think the integration of real-time data into TV graphics can influence video production in sport?\n\nA recent survey done by Vizrt showed that data-driven graphics is a focal point to attract younger viewers. Polling thousands of content consumers and sports fans in the UK and US, 70% of all respondents agree 3D, AR graphics, and sports analysis tools add to their experience of the game.\n\nThe new generation of sports consumers expect augmented reality (AR) graphics, real-time data, and exciting analysis to enhance their immersion in the game, and any broadcaster not considering these elements within their content is already falling behind. Data visualization helps enrich sports analysis and make it easier for viewers to grasp performance, strategies, highlighting patterns and outliers.”\n\nGabriel Baños\n\nViz Flowics co-founder\n\n→ Discover Viz Flowics\n\nRawmotion is a leading sports data service and real-time tv graphics provider for live sports productions in all parts of the world. Their premium solutions enhance tv productions for many different sports, turning sports events into the ultimate fan experience and increasing audience reach and engagement. Alexander Dörr, founder and CEO of Rawmotion, tells us more about the use of real-time data to enhance story telling of the broadcast.\n\nAs part of its collaboration with Velon, owner of the data and the global system by which it is produced, and the organizer of the Tour of Norway, Insiders worked with Rawmotion, reponsible for the integratation of real-time data and live TV graphics. Rawmotion developed custom middleware and a control application specifically designed to provide TV graphics for road cycling events.\n\n“The modular concept of our solution allows us to integrate easily with different data providers. For Tour of Norway, we integrated data from 3 different partners: including Velon, the performance data provider. “\n\nWhat has been your experience with Insiders’ devices during the Tour of Norway?\n\nWe worked with Velon, which uses Insiders hardware and cloud-based middleware to provide real-time data on athlete performance, and its solution provides a different perspective and interesting context for the viewers at home. It enhances the storytelling in the broadcast and gives us additional angles to work with.\n\nIntegration with the Insiders data platform was straight-forward and the latency of live data coming in from the trackers was very low in areas with good mobile coverage. Due to analysis of the mobile coverage on the stages, we knew in advance where to expect good data and were able to plan accordingly.\n\nWhat are the most important features a tracker should have?\n\nA GPS tracker for live sports production must be light-weight, reasonable form-factor (size) and great connectivity. Even more so, the cloud platform processing the tracker data must be optimised for low-latency applications.\n\nHow do you think the behaviors of viewers who consume live sports have changed in recent years, and how will real-time data help support this change?\n\nIn the consumer sector over the past ten years, viewers have learned to use various kinds of online live data apps to analyse their own performance and progression and consumers are expecting to get the same experience from watching live sports. The additional data really helps to provide additional context and background information for viewers and fans. There is a strong desire to understand whats happening and get more in-depth information, it creates more exciting experiences and also allows fans to compare themselves with their heroes. »\n\nALEXANDER DÖRR\n\nFOUNDER AND CEO\n\n→ Discover Rawmotion"
