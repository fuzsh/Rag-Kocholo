        "text": "For a wide range of reasons, installing a font and typing the company name does not make a logo. When designing a custom font, letters are created in such a way that they can fit before and after any other letter, ensuring consistency and legibility in unknown letter combinations. However, when creating a logotype, the sequence of letters is known so the shapes must be adjusted to appear harmonious and appealing.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is the necessity for different versions of the logo to fit a range of technical requirements, given that it will be printed on billboards and business cards, by offset and laser printers, and also reproduced in both high and low resolution screens.\n\nNRK developed a system with three levels of logo hierarchy, meaning that special refinements had to be made for each. First, the correct weight and tone for the words Nyheter and Sport had to be defined for when they were set next to the NRK symbol on one line. At the same time, small changes to the letterforms were made to ensure a balanced wordmark. Such details include straightening the terminal of the ‘r’ in Nyheter instead of keeping the angle that appears in the typeface, and, in Sport, cutting the left side of the crossbar on ‘t’ at the same angle as the ‘r’ to visually harmonise them.\n\nThe secondary logo was more tricky and underwent several rounds of feedback and alterations. One of the main problems was to get the balance between Nyheter/Sport and NRK right. Simultaneously, balancing between the two circled logos, given the different word lengths, was an additional challenge. The two words couldn’t be the same size but had to appear similar in weight. Therefore much of the stem thickness and letter spacing had to be fine-tuned.\n\nAs seen below, the completed branding is worth the scrutiny given at each step, and this effort is what it takes to ensure the mark appears as it should in each format, at all sizes, and either seen together or by itself."
