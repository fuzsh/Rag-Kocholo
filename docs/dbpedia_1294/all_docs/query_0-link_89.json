        "text": "To dive a little deeper into the complexities of the local and global in Dutch fandom I turn to my own turf: music fandom. My research examines how Dutch music fans become and remain fans of (inter)national musicians. For example, I interviewed (now adult) fans of the Backstreet Boys, who have been fans of the boy band since their early success in the 1990s. When most of these fans became fans, they were in their late childhood or early teens (aged somewhere between 8 and 16). During the Backstreet Boys heydays, the band regularly appeared on Dutch (children’s) TV and was often featured in Dutch pop magazines. Now, one might wonder: how were these young fans able to follow this American, English-speaking and -singing band when the fans’ main language was Dutch? Moreover, why was this American group so successful in a small country like the Netherlands? By answering these questions, I aim to illustrate how Dutch music fandom is influenced by the process of globalization. Yet, also how it shaped by social and cultural practices in the Netherlands.\n\nLet me start with clarifying the second question, before returning to the first. While much of the media entertainment broadcasted in the Netherlands is ‘Dutch’ – spoken and produced locally, foreign media content is highly popular too. Particularly media products from the United States and United Kingdom. As media scholar Jaap Kooijman described in his 2013 book ‘Fabricating the Absolute Fake: America in Contemporary Pop Culture’, the Netherlands always had a special connection to the US. Like many Europeans, the Dutch grew up with Disney movies, Hollywood productions, and American music – like that of the Backstreet Boys. This popularity of American pop culture offers a shared point of reference for many people. That was also the case for these very young teens who witnessed the band’s performances in popular (children’s) TV shows or heard them on the radio. In a way this signals the influence of globalization, but perhaps even more so the process of Americanization in the Netherlands.\n\nNow, to return to that first question I posited, ‘how were these young fans able to follow an international band (or media product) when the fans’ main language was Dutch’? Unlike neighboring country Germany (or nearby country France) where foreign media content is dubbed, in the Netherlands media products are broadcasted in their original language. They do receive subtitles. Through this cultural (and somewhat economic) practice young children learn English at a young age. They also officially already acquire a basic level of English at elementary school. During the interviews I conducted with Dutch fans of the Backstreet Boys fans often spoke about how becoming proficient in English at such a young age mattered greatly to their long-term fandom. They considered it very helpful to understand the band’s lyrics, but this also allowed them to read about the band or watch short interviews on television. Some of the fans who were in their ‘older teens’ in the 1990s (14-15 years old) indicated they for example translated English material from the band’s original website for other fans. One of the interviewees fans even started her own Dutch fan forum, to make information about the band accessible to fellow fans in the Netherlands. Other fans talked about becoming members of global forums, which led to creating friendships across the world. And many of those friendships remained for life: some of these interviewees mentioned meeting up with those international friends (in their now adult years) at one of the Backstreet Boys cruises and concerts abroad. So, this emphasis on language demonstrates how the practice of learning a new language (because of the local practice of not dubbing content too!) can potentially increase one’s fandom experience.\n\nNow, these are just a few, very brief observations about fandom in the Netherlands. These examples offer an insight into how local and global elements play a role in Dutch music fandom. I have briefly reviewed how American pop-culture influences Dutch fandom and how local practices and language are key features in the music fandoms that I studied. I am curious to learn of comparable or contradicting practices elsewhere (e.g., what is the influence of language elsewhere?). Of course, there is much more to discuss and share about Dutch fandom too (e.g., Dutch music fans like to travel because artists don’t always visit the country, how is that for fans in other countries?). Furthermore, I look forward to reviewing the position of Fan Studies in the Netherlands (often part of Media & Communication Studies programs) and compare this to other countries.\n\nSimone Driessen, Ph.D. is a senior lecturer and researcher in Media and Communication at Erasmus University Rotterdam, in the Netherlands. In her PhD she examined how and why fans remained fans over time and publishedthese findings in multiple journals and books. In addition to exploring why fans continue their fandom, Simone currently researches why fans discontinue their fandom.\n\nAnd then there is the “please come to Brazil” meme. Probably any pop culture lover with internet access has read hundreds of comments from fans begging their idols to visit us. According to Feldman, the joke started as a genuine claim for more international tours, but soon evolved into a symbol of Brazil’s online engagement, published on the comment section of any post, regardless of the content or even what celebrities like actors or reality tv personalities would do once they got here. Even Beyoncé’s family members were receiving those messages. Youtuber Kaleb Nation facetiously tweeted that “a celeb’s relevance can be accurately measured by how many ‘come to Brazil!!!!!’ tweets they get a day”.\n\nThat doesn’t mean that Brazilians forget about national texts. We have our own superstars, with legions of fans that cause just as much of a frenzy; our media texts, notably the telenovelas, with gigantic ratings from Mondays to Saturdays and even stopping the country during their finale; and we should never forget about the soccer fans. Yet, the interest for social capital provided by the international approval remains, and many fandoms try to validate their idols or texts by promoting them abroad — a more recent and remarkable case\n\nwas when Anitta’s fans changed their IP to american ones to call a Miami radio and ask for her songs.\n\nAs illustrated by the examples above, we can observe that there are evident aspects of Brazilian fan culture that differ from other countries. Jokes and rivalries aside, I do not believe the way we show affection for pop culture is necessarily better or worse (as it also causes many problems, specially concerning fans and idol’s safeties), but it is certainly veryBrazillian. In order to understand what is the Brazilian way to be a fan and how it came to be, we need to look at the big picture, which means to consider social, economic and historical aspects and singularities.\n\nYet, a review of Fan Studies in Brazil (Amado, 2019) shows that the field is still far from this panorama. In the early 2000, the subject was highly marginalized in the Communication and Media schools, being better received only by those who studied new technologies. Therefore, not only did the first researchers “import” fan theories already circulating in Anglo-Saxon countries, but they also had as main references international authors used by the Digital Communication Studies. This is a problem since the approaches, concepts, and methods present in those are related to the social conditions of the countries that their authors are part of, which are quite different from the dependent economy and high social inequality seen in Brazil. For example, the first Brazilian papers about fans had to focus on online fandoms, which created a pattern still prevalent, even though a significant part of the population does not have internet access or literacy.\n\nSince 2010, the number of studies with fans and fandoms as scientific objects has grown swiftly in Brazil, creating a broad literature with various approaches and from different areas, like Education, Administration and Linguistics. Nonetheless, we still fail to quote ourselves, with international authors prevailing amongst our citations. In addition, another issue identified is that most studies focus only on fandoms from Rio de Janeiro and/or São Paulo, neglecting many groups from a continental country.\n\nAiming to remedy those liabilities, I examined and traced a social profile of Brazil’s transcultural fans by thematically analysing all 39 theses and dissertations published in the country with them as objects (Amado, 2020). The results show a clear historical, economic, and political impact on fandom activities. Latin-American countries have what Canclini (1997) calls “hybrid cultures”, marked by our highly exploratory colonization process, constantly mixing autochthonous and enslaved traditions with the ways of life of European\n\ncolonizers. Our national identities were then shaped by a development strongly based on external influences. Moreover, in 1808, escaping Napoleon’s attack, Portugal’s Royal Family sailed to Brazil, where they lived until 1820 (just two years before our independence), making us the only colony in the continent where the European crown lived. Historians believe that having the Portuguese court in our land defined how we view and value transnational cultures, especially the ones from countries with superior economies. For example, former Minister of Culture Celso Furtado (1984, p. 39) affirms that “the visit of a European theater company to a Brazilian city could be the defining cultural event in the life of an entire generation”. This, tied with the still current lack of public policies that encourage local cultural production, made our population view international cultures as a symbol of social capital (Hollanda, 2010). After the Second War, that focus changed from Europe to the USA, the nation abroad where most transcultural texts in Brazil come from. The second place belongs to Japan, also associated with our historical process, with strong imigration politics encouraging Japanese to live over here (nowadays, Brazil is the country with the largest population of Japanese origin outside of Japan and Otakus are fairly common amongst our subcultures).\n\nSocial capital has a fundamental part in Brazilian fan culture. We pride ourselves for (supposedly) being the best in the world, making comparisons and even virtual wars. But the status is disputed inside the fandoms as well: there is an evident hierarchical structure in our fandoms, which can be defined by longevity in the group, knowledge about the text or fanactivities. People at the “bottom” of that structure seek for prestige to climb and, in some cases, a member can become so popular that it gets its own fans.\n\nThat hierarchy helps with what I believe is our main distinction: the high level of organization. The fandoms have strict rules (ex: some prohibit the discussion of politics and nudity posts) and divisions of tasks (moderator, manager, director etc.) to create a healthy environment — which is crucial since many fans use fandoms as a “safe space” to be themselves. This system was originally created because of how long it usually took for the texts to be made available here and how the industries would overlook Brazil when planning tours or press conferences. This led to groups organizing themselves into what is better described as a more simplified fordist system. To this day, that structure is used to produce subtitles, scanlations, podcasts, fansites and fan events. Almost all of those are voluntary, free, steady and nearly flawless.\n\nThe intensity of our fandoms are reshaping how the whole population consumes media. Phenomena like Big Brother Brasil’s Juliette and comedian Whinderson Nunes proves that a good social media strategy, associated with popular verbiage and humor, can rapidly lead to fame and social relevance. Such strategies have been mimicked by various sectors, most notably by politicians, adding to the worldwide political polarization when creating an extreme rivalry between current president and extreme-rightist Bolsonaro and former president and leftist Lula — each one with an uncritical base, much more like fans than voters.\n\nTo study fandom is now a necessity in the Brazilian Social Science field. And, albeit the subject is finally gaining recognition — with dedicated discussion groups in national events and special issues in scientific journals — we are ready to grow from the researches that focuses on isolated fandoms and start theorizing on their place in the current state of our nation.\n\nCITATIONS\n\nAmado, Aianne.

The success of Black Panther on the African continent was underwritten by the feeling of “locality” to the point that most people did not even know that it was a Marvel and a Hollywood production. Black Panther, however, was suited to the local level, as opposed to a globalized scale.\n\nThis means thinking about what the Glocal means in this context and what does that suggest about how people think of fandom outside of these so-called idealized and rarefied \"centers\" for this artistic practice?\n\nThis is a long-overdue spotlight on the robust community of fans outside of the west and a deeper conversation about how major institutions, such as Hollywood and Marvel superheroes are investing in ecosystems and fan-led organizations outside of the West and the ways we relate to each other and see ourselves in larger social frameworks.\n\nThese internal and societal shifts caused these institutions, like many others, to confront which superheroes they had historically shown and why they were selected. Perhaps more importantly, they were also prompted to address which communities had been excluded from these opportunities in the first place. The success of comic superheroes outside of traditional centers generated strong feelings among comic creators and Hollywood to produce works that specifically served these non-white communities to become really strongly rooted in the local community, to the same degree that it has been functioning on a national and international scale\n\nIn the case of Black Panther and Africa, moreover, how issues of needs and rights are located and folded into superheroes’ discourses to generate productive opportunities. This kind of politics merges with Black Panther with conversations about the restitution of stolen African art. In the movie, the son of Prince N’Jobu, Killmonger, and nemesis of Black Panther, organizes a heist in a London museum to recover a legendary weapon from Wakanda. If this African country is imaginary, and the stage too, the fiction on the other hand reflected a very real debate on the restitution of works.\n\nEmblematic in this respect, Black Panther, first, demonstrates that flow of circulation of commodities between Africa and the world was never interrupted. Second, How Black Panther is a matrical foundational work embedded in a web of elemental materials and a mythological well and the need to evaluate original work as work in progress. Thus, how chef d’oeuvres are always almost unfinished and incomplete. In practice, how created logic production is usually bifurcated and inprevisible.\n\nHence, the movie engages the still unresolved issues of the restitution of African works, but also those of the conflicting memory of slavery and colonization, which fall on a much more physical terrain. What Black Panther had somehow anticipated and staged.\n\nFurthermore, Marvel's Black Panther isn't just the political \"blockbuster\" the public has been waiting for. It is a historic event in intellectual life that goes beyond the American threshold and gives rise to genuine exegesis in the social sciences.\n\nThe film responded to the #OscarSoWhite movement that forced Hollywood to realize the near absence of African Americans in its nominations. Moreover, Black Panther provides proof that African-American narratives can generate profits from all audiences and puts an end to a myth in the film industry.\n\nThus, more than a movie, Black Panther is a vehicle of thought. A true intellectual synthesis. It is no coincidence that a few months before the film's release, the writing of the new adventures of the Black Panther was entrusted to writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, author of the bestseller Between the World and Me. It is no coincidence that activist writer Roxane Gay, author of another bestseller Bad Feminist was also involved in the writing of this comic book. The \"Black Panther\" phenomenon is well and truly placed under the sign of an era of \"Black Lights\". Sociologists, historians, and thinkers seize hold of it.\n\nNewer comic book fans in Colombia consume much Marvel/DC, manga and the likes of Asterix, Mortadelo y Filemón, and Tintin, but they also consume more national and regional comics than before. Although we will not be back to the heyday of Mexican comics that we had in the 1970s, there are more items to chose from, and new comic book creators are now able to make their own superhero comics have a local flair.\n\nFelipe Ossa, a famous collector and editor of the Sunday funnies for one of the major national newspapers, has mentioned recently that he sees the last ten years as the boom of Colombian comics production. We will see if that remains the case.\n\nResponses from Olivier Tchouaffe on Comics and local fandom and Sympathy\n\nThis globalized and transnational conversations on comics, in this case Colombia and Cameroon, highlight how comics are indigenized to fulfill a need and to play a role in local politics as we emphasize, particularly, with Black Panther and Avatar. Hence, as always, a second project emerges in the background of these superheroes comics which is the evocation of the avatars of current African or Latin American societies. If the action takes place in Cameroon, it could as well be in France, United States, Mexico or Colombia. As with Black Panther or Avatar, we always end up looking the problems in the face and confronting family or societal failures. For lack of being able to repair them, at least these films instill as much as possible the possible beginnings of reflection or even debate.\n\nIn addition, how this also complicated the dichotomy between the global and the local and the narratives how the global as the site of progress while the local is mired in backwardness.\n\nConsequently, these comics are always powerful, especially, when they land at an opportune moment in the backdrop of national conflicts and issues of social justice that need urgent resolution. Hence, how comics, by definition, is the power to transcend cultural context and participating in giving a voice and a presence to the local fans striving to make themselves heard.\n\nIn doing so, the knowledge local fans deal with a much more complicated reality and the necessary epistemological rupture from the ways that they might be known or seen as simply infantilized receptacles of foreign media and controlled through soulless consumption of fetichized commodities and probably dupes of the global cultural industry.\n\nThis involves deconstructing the stereotypes embedded in the idea that local fans are not creative but the receptacle of creativity and the consenting spectators of images produced by others.\n\nThus, the necessity to interrogate images produced for local fans and how these images become normative while totaling advancing the knowledge that local fans are more than capable to have their own subjective experiences and psychological and emotional maturation to become responsible adults and citizens moving away from infantile narcissism. Thus, products of both scientific and psychological processes embedded in productive living and logics of contribution.\n\nThis calls for new ways to complicate notions of sympathy and moral judgement. In practice, how the reception of these comics is not simply a matter of emotion, gut instinct or pleasure but the imaginative power of projection to expand our inner circle into the richness of a diverse multicultural world. It goes at the heart of universal cosmopolitan enlightenment values and engagement with urgent issues in the world such as social justice informing on local resources, strength and resilience. How we commit to these values and how we can get there.\n\nAs a consequence, the comics superheroes today are universal emblematic of freedom, meritocracy and self-reliance and tales of empowerment that can no longer be overlooked and how the status quo is constantly being challenged in countries receiving these cultural constructs. This is a testimony to what Henri Bergson called the “Élan Vital “which represents the creative force within an organism that is responsible for growth, change, and necessary or desirable adaptations. In ways, these comics authors are equally greatly influenced by Henri Bergson and his term élan vital as they seek to make such universal harmonies, and this urge for growth and renewal, visible in their work.\n\nAs with all his toys, such as, helicopter, plane, rocket, submarine, outboard boat, and many vehicles, Tintin has always seized, as if by magic and without a license, all the toys of technical progress. In fact, he walked on the moon as early as 1953, sixteen years before Neil Armstrong! He is a character of speed and action, of perpetual motion. He is only defined by his actions, and his interventions are always those that move the adventure forward, where the secondary characters delay the pace. Between a Captain Haddock who swears by a trillion thousand ports and a frankly tough professor Tournesol.\n\nThis is all because Tintin is both a vehicle of universal and timeless identification, but also a figure of pure freedom and self-reliance, as if spared by reality. An over-child myth that speaks to all generations of readers including space entrepreneur Elon Musk! After the \"Secret of the Unicorn\", the duo Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson are reforming for an adaptation of the Temple of the Sun, announced for 2021.\n\nTaken together, in a world that is getting hyperconnected but precarious, in many parts, these figures become the vector of a moral economy driven by technological creativity.\n\nResponse by Enrique Uribe-Jongbloed (Colombia)\n\nIt is funny that you bring up Tintin. When I was a kid in a private catholic school in Bogotá, Colombia, we were invited once a month to a “slideshow”. One of the priests at the school, an old Frenchman of the Assumptionist order, would present to us a series of Tintin slides in French, which he would then translate and act out in his accented Spanish. It was fun to hear him shout out mild curses when taking on the role of Captain Haddock. Although there were other slides in the slideshow, mostly catholic stories, we were always thrilled to get Tintin. There was adventure and excitement, and particularly for an all-boys catholic school, a role model which was, as you described, uninterested in women, ready for adventure, and with no other commitments beyond his dog, Milú.\n\nTintin was also part of the Sunday Funnies, a whole page on the back, and those whose families could afford it, would try to get the comic books at Libreria Francesa (French Bookstore). They were very expensive, maybe only to be expected as a lavish Christmas or birthday gift. We used to meet at the homes of those friends who possessed the Tintin books and proceed to binge-read them. They were so precious at the time, that getting a friend of you to lend on of them to you, was a proof of friendship and trust.\n\nOf course, looking through an adult critical lens, it strikes me how those comic books always showed us Western and Eurocentric views as ideal. In that sense, it was exactly like our school curriculum and basically most media output: Westernized to the core. If they were in anyway counterhegemonic in relation to US comic book production, they remained very hegemonic from our perspective.\n\nObviously, despite the criticism that I might levy upon Tintin, it still holds a very important place in my heart. The only Latin American comic strip that might get close to evoking such fond memories of my childhood would be Condorito, the Chilean character, which my grandfather used to buy for me at the local Kiosk, and which is, by and large, the most famous comic book figure in the country, at least for those in my generation.\n\nThus, when the Tintin film came out it was almost a requirement to go watch it, more because of nostalgia than anything else. And although it was sufficiently entertaining, it was certainly not the same as remembering the old priest making up watered-down vocabulary for every “@*-!!!” uttered.\n\n[1] Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson played the Dupond and Dupont, in a short film, to greet visitors to the Angoulême festival and present the filming of the adaptation of \"Secret of the Unicorn\", on January 29, 2009\n\nBlek Le Roc and Lucky Luke\n\nTo clarify, Blek, the Trapper and Lucky Luke represent a view of America refracted and reflected through European eyes, which as with the Spaghetti Western of Sergio Leone, reveal the worldwide appeal of myths involving the American West which itself can be seen as a substitute for a kind of eternal wild frontier. It is equally interesting while revisiting Lucky Luke to examine the debate about ethics around fandom. My enthusiasm nowadays is tempered by the clichés and stereotypes embedded in the cartoons even if they were created in good humor. While the description of colonial Brits in Blek the Trapper as “Red Lobsters,” might cause to ponder about the origin of the famous seafood chain, the recurrence of Chinese as cunning and sneaky and of Mexicans as lazy and irresponsible. More, the Blacks as darkies are unequivocally racist in nature, even though Lucky Luke as a defender of the vulnerable offsets them.\n\nThus, the grotesque depiction of minorities allows us to make a moral judgment about the relationship between representation and reality. These cartoons hero’s depiction therefore even though they did not look like us, or move like us, and did not come from our culture but they did talk like us, and they were always defending of the hopeless and the oppressed. You can feel the desire for justice and to make the world a better place by fighting evil on all fronts with the power of human potential. Thus, even though it was all fantasy, and we knew all the codes, it was a convention we were happy to live by since it gave us hope.\n\nThis idea of fandom here functions as a powerful link through a nebulous context driven by science fiction, superhero movies/fantasy and a new form of postcolonial ethic. Taken together, to unravel conventional ideological practices as they appear in visual culture to challenge the excesses of neoliberal capitalism and its catalogue of oppression. The aim is to take established fan bases to re-examines ideological practices that naturalize and moralize along conventional constructions of gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, and geography. The goal is the idea that we were able to experience critical distance to entities and objects we related to in order to exploit the concept of transgression or presenting camp pastiches that illuminate the construction and the fragility of these structures and how new forms of knowing is mapped into all aspects of the body, performance, and the narrative in ways that polymorphically do not, oftentimes, adhere to conventional description of modes of beings and knowing.\n\nOlivier J.

The Dalton Brothers were originally introduced in Lucky Luke #6 and modeled after the real Dalton Brothers: Bob, Grat, Bill and Emmett. The Daltons were killed in the end of that story, but since they proved very popular by readers, writer/artist Morris introduced their cousins Joe, William, Jack and Averell in issue #12. They have the same appearance as the original Dalton brothers, but are less dangerous\n\nThe division of consumption of comics books in the 1980s and 1990s can be traced to the cultural capital and economic background of the consumers and fans. Most comics in the 1980s were published in Spanish, distributed as small (half letter-size page) magazines published on newspaper-quality paper, with a very low price, which expanded their consumption. By the 1990s, the disappearance of the magazine kiosks and the bankruptcy of the distribution companies, led to the comics moving only into the specialized bookstore, often exclusively in English or their original language (French, in the cases of Tintin and Asterix), and becoming available only to those with more disposable income, cultural capital, and language abilities, which then becomes a middle- or upper-class activity. Recently, local comics have started to gather a new readership and a small-scale fandom, with a low price and easy accessibility such as the cases of Bogotá Masacre Zombie and Saic (see more about the comic scenario in Colombia in Uribe-Jongbloed and Aguilar-Rodríguez, 2020).\n\nWhereas the informal or small-scale stores of Anime and Manga products became a staple of middle and working class neighborhoods –alongside the videogame parlors where you could rent a Nintendo to play for periods of 30-minutes–, the specialist store or Hobby shop appeared in the Bogotá under Libreria Francesa (The French Bookshop), opening up to four shops in the height of their business in the late 1990s. Libreria Francesa’s Hobby Center was the place where Role-Playing games, collectible card games, comics, miniatures and toys could be acquired. They catered for a more exclusive upper and upper-middle class, with English or French language skills and more disposable income. The tabletop RPG boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s sparked the creation of local clubs and guilds at the various public and private universities and saw the creation of independent gaming clubs, none of which lasted a decade (for more on RPGs in Colombia, see Uribe-Jongbloed, 2020). By the 2010s the various book and entertainment fairs (SOFA, FILBO, COMIC-CON, among others) became the gathering place for comics collectors, cosplayers and RPG aficionados, local libraries offered comics reading groups, and Entreviñetas became a staple yearly event for people interested in a more academic take on comics, at the same time as the Cali Shinanime became the main meeting point for Anime and Manga fans.\n\nThrough this general perspective of Colombian fandom, mainly focused in Bogotá and side-stepping videogameas, we hope to have given you a quick view of how fandom’s interconnected cultural links have taken shape in the last decades. The political change brough about by the 1991 Constitution which opened up the national market to foreign investment and acquisitions, increased competition and limited market protectionism, can be seen to underscore the wane of the comics boom of the 1980s and their cultural structures, at the same time as providing entry to other media products –such as Anime, Manga, figurines and miniatures, RPGs–. The 1990s also saw the appearance of cable television and increased competition to the two national broadcasters, which until then provided a unified audiovisual culture to the country. Cultural capital, in terms of linguistic skills in foreign languages, and increasing disposable income, became two of the main driving forces for the development of a more active fan culture base, and provided the original boost for a more global concept of fandom. The 1993 Book Law which made books tax-free, classified comics in the same line of pornographic magazines as objects of no cultural value and responsible for full Value Added Tax, making comics expensive to produce and acquire, driving the last nail in their coffin. The 20 years it took to repeal that classification, and provide comics with the value and tax-free status of cultural products, saw the extinction of all but the staunchest comic book fans, which became a cultural elite very distant from the more popular comics consumers of the previous decades.\n\nAlthough more widespread today, fandom in general is often restricted to middle and upper-class highly educated strata, although at least it is now no longer as male-dominant as it was in the early 1990s, joining a more international trend in that aspect. Despite some local products receiving some attention, it is still well below the fan interest brought about by the largest international film, TV, videogame and comics franchises.\n\nAK: Thank you for your answers. It's just a pleasurable interplay between fans and \"characters\" (staff)! Here in Japan, too, fans understand that anime characters never post their comments (I mean they know staff post and reply to fans), but they enjoy virtual correspondence and posted pictures.\n\nnterestingly, the (voice) actors who play the role of the anime character often treat the anime character as their \"friend\". So, birthday celebration for the anime character posted by the actors is quite popular. Fans react to it by saying \"Happy birthday! we can cerebrate together!\"\n\nAs for the issues on sexualities, I think it depends on voice actors and theater actors. For instance, if a voice actor get married or maybe confesses his/her identity, it would not very much impact the anime character he/she plays. However, if a theater actor reveals his sexual identity, for instance, he/she is LGBTQ+, some heterosexual fans can be disappointed. Some fans often say, \"we don't care about your sexuality. Just don't make it open. Just make us keep dreaming.\"\n\nLike you mentioned that it's more accepted in Norway than in the US, here it's almost same culturally. But in reality, legislation has still a long way to go. Japan doesn't accept same-sex marriage, a system of optional separate surnames for married couples, etc. I'm sorry I'm not familiar with legislation in Norway, but I guess Northern European countries have established the systems to protect rights for married and non-married couples; I mean the government supports non-married couples and their children. (please correct if I'm wrong.)\n\nJD: I must admit, I am quite curious about the similarities and differences between European, American, and Asian fan studies. You mention, for example, that celebrities’ open heterosexuality is more accepted than open homosexuality amongst fans in Japan, but I am curious to know how you feel that \"boys' love\" fandoms have affected or may affect such attitudes.\n\nI would also love to know more about the intersection of girlhood studies/women's studies and fandom, as you have mentioned in your starting statement this is a growing area of interest in Japanese fan studies. Most of what I have read about Japanese fandom has focused on women, but this is likely because women have been the focus of American and European fan studies for so long, so what filters through appears to align with the focus of study in the US and Europe rather than with the focus of study in Japan. Is that correct? Could you tell me a little bit more about the gendered dynamic of fan studies in Japan (including more on \"otaku\")?\n\nAK: Thank you for your questions.\n\nI am curious to know how you feel that \"boys' love\" fandoms have affected or may affect such attitudes.\n\nActually, there are lots of \"boys' love\" (BL) anime and even TV dramas which depict love between men. It is tricky, though, that protagonists (at least one of the protagonists) are not necessarily homosexual. It means that they are basically heterosexual, but once they meet, they stop liking each other. Such discourses are more accepted than a story about born homosexuals.\n\nFor instance, a mega hit anime (comedy/romance) \"Junjo Romantica\" depicts heterosexual guys who accept love from their male tutor, friend, and nephew etc. A TV drama (comedy) \"Ossan's love\" (Love of a middle-aged man) was so popular that many audiences enjoyed it partly because very popular actors played the main leads. Although these \"BL\" anime and dramas illustrate idealized or fantasized male homosexual romance, young (female) audiences actually got interested in LGBTQ+ problems because of these popular culture.\n\nCould you tell me a little bit more about the gendered dynamic of fan studies in Japan (including more on \"otaku\")?\n\nSince I focus on female fandom from gender perspectives, I just explained female fandoms here. But actually in Japanese scholarship on anime/manga/game fandom, most of the works have focused on (male) otaku by male scholars (Otsuka Eiji, Azuma Hiroki, Saito Tamaki, Uno Tsunehiro etc.) since the 1980s. (Anime, manga, and games were not taken as academic agendas until in the 1990s when America and European countries \"discovered\" Japanese anime as \"cool\".) However, quite recently, probably because many universities began to offer gender and popular culture classes, more female scholars have had papers and books published in academia, and BL anime/drama aired in nationwide TV networks are getting popular, female fan studies have been accepted as gender studies, women's studies, and girls' studies. (By the way, Japanese BL manga/anime impacted South East Asian countries. For instance, Thai BL TV dramas used a Japanese BL framework and gained much popularity in Asia and even Japan. It can be analyzed in area studies, post-colonialism, media studies etc.)\n\nAn interesting point, though, is a gap between fans and scholars. Although most BL scholars are fans (aca-fans), when a book (anthology) \"Textbook on BL\" was out last year, quite a few BL fans criticized the authors, saying \"Don't make our \"hidden pleasure\" open!\" or \"Leave us alone!\" It is very intriguing that finally an introductory academic textbook on BL was published, aiming at students and fans, but BL fans refused to be examined.\n\nIn Japan, academic journals or associations about fan studies exclusively are few unlike in English speaking countries. This is one of the issues to be solved too. How about in Norway? Maybe because of SKAM, many students have got interested in studying gender, immigrants, religious, social issues at schools and colleges?\n\nJD: SKAM definitely made certain studies more popular, and it quickly made its way onto syllabi in gender, religious, and media studies (e.g., Sivertsen & Mordt, 2017). It also made Norwegian a popular language to learn outside of Norway (e.g., Framtida, 2018; Uksnøy, 2016).\n\nAs regards gender, it is important to note that the series also led to many important discussions outside of formal learning spaces. The SKAM blog provided space for the audiences’ “unfiltered, knee-jerk reactions” and “all possible feelings, including politically incorrect ones,” with the aim that “the audience [could] work through these feelings by itself” (Krüger & Rustad, 2019, p. 89). Audiences publicly debated topics brought up by the show, such as the illegality of taking and spreading naked images of minors, the politics of abuse and harassment, and whether “party rapes are really just girls regretting they haad sex afterwards”—a comment vehemently opposed by numerous other fans (Krüger & Rustad, 2019, p. 89). Indeed, Krüger and Rustad (2018) argue that the show, thorugh both its transmedia engulfment of its audience and its content (which, per the show’s title, often focuses on feelings of shame), purposefully “hands over the task of negotiating social reality and its moral groundings to media users” (p. 90).\n\nHowever, the fervor surrounding the series has now died off. As in Japan, there are few official academic journals or associations exclusively focused on fan studies—although it must be said that the overwhelming majority of Norwegian scholarship is now published in English (Bye, 2021). This is in part because fan studies is less established here and in part because our research milieu is small—and as a result, fan scholars here tend to focus on international research networks, research groups, and channels for publication. I don’t necessarily see the lack of local groups and publication channels as limiting, although I must admit that it would be nice to have access to a local fan studies–focused research group. I do sometimes feel that fan studies is dominated by very specific perspectives and that these do not always match up with local experiences or discourses, but I suspect that this is nearly always the case outside of North America.\n\nReferences:\n\nBye, K.

SKAM was a hot topic here in Japan too, although I think it's not accessible in the same way you do there in Norway, of course. It's just like a concept of \"2.5-D\" that I have conceptualized and am doing research on. I'm interested in the use of media. I wonder if what platforms do fans of SKAM usually use to post their fanfic. And are there any difference between generations (groups of people by age differences)?\n\nJennifer Duggan [JD]: Thank you, Akiko. I am really interested in your concept of 2.5-D fandom—that is, linking fictional worlds to real life in productive and entertaining ways. I think that fiction always has a great impact on reality but that we are seeing its impact more often and more profoundly now. Or perhaps, we are paying closer attention to the implications of the interplay between fiction and reality now. But that isn’t to say that these convergences weren’t visible in the past: I came to fandom studies by way of Victorian studies and am fascinated by, for instance, the celebrity fan cultures surrounding canine actors from Victorian dog dramas (Featherstone, 2016) and the material fan cultures of works of literature that resulted in the creation and sale of literary merchandise. For example, Wilkie Collins’s 1859 novel The Woman in White was merchandised due to its popularity: one could buy Woman in White hats, clothing, and perfumes (Wynne, 2001). And Victorian fans enjoyed performative fan cultures of their own, such as Londoners’ mass protest over the death of the fictional character Sherlock Holmes, during which they wore mourning bands, penned and published obituaries, and gave up their subscriptions to Strand Magazine in an effort to pressure Conan Doyle into resurrecting their favourite fictional hero. The impulse to express ourselves through fandom, then, and together with other fans seems to be an impulse shared across genres, geographies, and generations.\n\nAs for the platforms that SKAM fans have used, there were a wide variety: the official website was popular, as were social media sites like Tumblr, Facebook, Instagram, and Youtube, in addition to fandom-associate sites like AO3. It was popular across age groups, in part because it combined a transmedia, innovative format, intended to engage youth, with a more traditional “summary” episode every week, which engaged older audiences. Vilde Schanke Sundet has published a number of articles on SKAM and its spread (e.g., Sundet, 2019) if you are interested in reading more. I cannot see that there was too much of a difference between where fans of various generations posted their SKAM fan fiction, but that is not something I have focused on in my research.\n\nI think SKAM does have some interesting implications for your interest in the interplay between real and fictional spaces, because it worked so hard to appear ‘real.’ This meant that fans of the series visited the very real school the series’ characters attended, for example, and were able to follow the characters social media accounts and comment on their posts, which blurred the boundaries between what was fiction and what was not (e.g., Duggan, 2020). The series’ success also hints at the mainstreaming of yaoi/slash, because the most popular season, season 3, focused on a male–male romance. Certainly, the show was very popular in local and international LGBTQ+ circles across generations and has been regarded in Norway as an important step towards normalizing nonheteronormative desire.\n\nI’ll stop here before I begin to ramble too much....\n\nReferences:\n\nDuggan, J.

Palgrave Macmillan.\n\nAS: I think the case you told about SKAM can be taken as the 2.5D, although the 2.5D I have examined is almost always anime/manga/game characters involved.\n\nI’m especially curious about what you said “This meant that fans of the series visited the very real school the series’ characters attended, for example, and were able to follow the characters social media accounts and comment on their posts, which blurred the boundaries between what was fiction.” So, fans could visit actual schools they saw in SKAM, which we calls “contents tourism” (Seaton et al, 2017). It is also interesting that the characters have social media accounts. I wonder if those who make comments on fans’ posts are staff of SKAM, not actors, right? Here in the 2.5-D culture I mentioned, anime characters often have their social media accounts, too. But those who post and replay are, of course, staff of the programs. In the 2.5D theaters, it’s being a bit complicated: the actors who play roles of anime characters sometimes post messages through their social media as the characters, and sometimes post messages as actors themselves. Those interplay between characters (fiction) and actors (reality) also appeals to fans, although it means the reality intervenes in the fiction and vice versa.\n\nI wonder how the actors/actresses of SKAM use their social media. They comment on the role they play from the third party’s view? Or they avoid doing it? It particularly matters when the actors play the roles of homosexual characters that you mentioned. If they are heterosexual in real life, are there any conflicts or debate going on? (I’m afraid I cannot get access to SKAM yet, which only one platform dominantly offers. I don’t subscribe it.)\n\nReferences:\n\nSeaton et.al, 2017. Contents Tourism in Japan: Pilgrimages to Sacred Sites of Popular Culture. London: Cambria Press.\n\nJD: Yes, the comments were posted by staff, not actors, to the best of my knowledge. But those who commented on the posts were both “other characters” (aka staff) and fans, and the “characters” (staff) would sometimes reply to and interact with fans, so it really blurred the boundary between the real and the pretend. This was certainly appealing to fans, and they increased fan-“character” (staff) interactions in later iterations of SKAM, such as the German version, Druck.\n\nThere has not been too much debate or commentary about the actors in Norway aside from happiness over an increase in visibility for LGBTQ+ characters, but in other countries, fans did comment on the actors’ sexualities. I think it is more accepted in Norway that actors play roles across a variety of identities than it is, for example, in the US.\n\nIs this topic one of debate in Japan?\n\nHello, everyone! My name is Jenny (Jennifer Duggan). I am a dual Canadian and British citizen, and I work at the University of South-Eastern Norway. I am particularly interested in the juncture between alterity and fandom, and as such, my published work has drawn on masculinity studies, trans studies, queer studies, multilingualism, and childhood studies' focus on age-related alterity. My research is therefore located at the intersection of childhood studies, children's and young adult literary and media studies, cultural studies, and fan studies. It has been published in, amongst other venues, Television and New Media, Transformative Works and Cultures, Children's Literature in Education, International Research in Children's Literature, Bookbird, and Journal of Popular Culture. My research has focused on two fandoms: Harry Potter and the cult Norwegian transmedia youth series SKAM (2015–2017), produced by NRK (Norsk rikskringkasting, known as the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation in English).\n\nContributors to this blog discussion have been asked to comment on the push–pull of global and local factors on fandom in our research contexts. I would argue that fandom in Norway is global in that many of the biggest fandoms are familiar fiction franchises, like Harry Potter, Star Wars, He Man, or Marvel, as well as Japanese anime and manga, video games, bands like One Direction, and European football (soccer) clubs. Many fan activities take place in English for this reason. Certainly, there are also many families with children who travel to Norway because of its association with Disney's Frozen. (When I lived in Bergen in 2013, I could not escape \"Let It Go,\" which seemed to be the only song on the radio other than Ylvis's \"What Does the Fox Say?\") Nonetheless, there is also great investment in local, Scandinavian/Nordic, and European fandoms. Melodi Grand Prix and Eurovision are extremely popular, for example, as are Nordic noir series, whether Norwegian or not. In fact, crime as a genre is so popular here that there is a tradition every year at the Easter for book publishers and TV companies to publish various \"Påskekrim\" (Easter crime) novels and series.\n\nAs I am not (yet) Norwegian myself and have only lived here for eight years, I felt it necessary to confirm my impressions of fandom in Norway for this commentary by doing a small-scale quantitative study of the Norwegian-language fanfics on AO3. If we take AO3 as a microcosm of Norwegian fandom, we can see that there are some noticeable patterns in language use. There are, admittedly, only 461 Norwegian-language stories on AO3, which I quantified for this introduction as a small-scale study. The results are not definitive, but they do point to tends in language choice:\n\nVery few stories linked to global franchises, series, etc., like Harry Potter, Supernatural, Marvel, One Direction, are published in Norwegian. Meanwhile, 76% of the Norwegian-language fanfics on AO3 are related to the Norwegian cult hit SKAM. While the show did eventually gain a global following, it nonetheless enjoyed a large local following and Norwegian ability conferred significant cultural capital within the fandom (see Duggan & Dahl, 2019). The children's franchise Kaptein Sabeltann is the second-most popular Norwegian-language fandom on AO3 (7% of fanfics in Norwegian). Other franchises, books, and shows written about in Norwegian include Zombie Lars, various Norwegian crime and detective novels, Norwegian bands such as Ylvis (known globally for the aforementioned song \"What Does the Fox Say?\"), NRK (the Norwegian national broadcaster) television series like the political satire Nytt på nytt, and so forth. This suggests that fans in Norway make purposeful choices about their language use based on the assumed reach of the fandoms in which they participate.\n\nHowever, the use of language by Norwegians participating in fandom is complicated. This is particularly true for Norwegian fandoms that have become global, such as the SKAM fandom. SKAM was a truly transmedia series spread between a dedicated website, characters' social media accounts, and other media. Moreover, although a summary episode was published once a week on Friday's, the series was in fact published in small pieces throughout the week: a video might be published on the official website at 1:08 a.m. on Wednesday and be followed the next morning by social media posts by characters and screenshots of their text conversations. This made the series particularly \"spreadable\" (Jenkins, Green, & Ford, 2013), as I and others have argued (e.g., Andersen & Tanderup Linkis, 2019; Duggan, 2020). The global success of the series was due largely to fans' translating and sharing it via online networks such as Tumblr and YouTube, but while its global success would not have been popular without English, the series prompted a great deal of interest in Norwegian fluency in which came to have significant cultural capital in the online fandom (Duggan & Dahl, 2019a). Nonetheless, there were arguments within the fandom, particularly visible on the official website, about language use. The success of the series inspired pride in its Norwegian viewers, and this prompted a linguistic and cultural nationalism that at times created conflicts, as some fans considered their fellow fans' use of English a betrayal of the local fan community (Dugan & Dahl, 2019a, 2019b).\n\nThe discussions fans had about language closely mirrored academic and popular discourses regarding the threats and affordances of English use in Norway, and in particular, the worry expressed by Språkrådet (the Norwegian Language Council) that Norwegian is losing ground to English in Norway. I find it quite interesting how a single fandom, like the SKAM fandom, can become a microcosm of wider sociopolitical concerns over local versus English language use, as I have just discussed; globalized popular culture versus locally produced cultural artefacts, as we can see, for example, in the Norwegian government's desire that Netflix produce and stream more Norwegian content (Drabløs); and other similar concerns. I am sure this is the case in many other countries and contexts.\n\nReferences:\n\nAndersen, T. R., & Tanderup Linkis, S. (2019).

As a teen getting into alternative music, I lived in a small town where my classmates thought the Foo Fighters were obscure and alienating. I should mention that fandom was also part of me discovering queer identity and community—something which felt impossible to acknowledge in my real-world environment. There’s a parallel with the idea of being too into something (or someone), where an online group of like-minded people can be both an outlet and a retreat. Twitter and Reddit didn’t hit my radar until I was in my 20s, much more secure in both a fan identity and a queer identity: I really benefited from the smaller environments of message boards and mailing groups. To this day, I tend to keep to smaller platforms for a lot of my fanning: as you say, I find it so enriching to have different people and spaces—private and public, online and offline, academic and creative. Knowing where to share those easter eggs is an art!\n\nTo talk about comic club and the different tone of conversations: there were so many great conversations over the years, big and small! Sometimes it felt like a tutorial, prompting discussion question about our set text to critically analyse it. It was often really liberating to not like a book, and find that others have their own nuanced critique of it. Being able to constructively critique what I wanted in a story with each other was such a helpful process. Beyond the book club element of it, being able to fangirl in person was a rare treat: a great icebreaker idea one of the organisers had was to make name stickers that said ‘Hello my name is ___ and I like ___.’ You’d see someone you know was also playing Breath of the Wild or watching Money Heist, or someone you’d never met was also really into Pretty Deadly, and start a conversation. I think for a lot of women in comic shops, there’s pressure not just to like the right texts but to like them the right way. Unpacking and articulating the problems you had with Wytches is just as valuable as the chance to squee about Ms Marvel.\n\nAs for community members staying in touch, I know some have their own established friendships outside the club that are thriving! The store itself has done great work shifting to mailing comics and keeping up a sense of community. I’m also active in local zinemaking culture, which has plenty of events between our prolonged lockdowns. One of the major shifts for me recently has been from teaching and discussing comics to making them myself. It’s very cool to be able to apply everything I’ve absorbed and share that!\n\nI’m definitely one of the people who slipped into comfort zones in the pandemic. Looking at my pattern, it tends to be a season of more challenging new media and then something more cozy—still new, but a genre I know will be easy to devour. One of my favourite things to do as a fan/scholar is dig up a (literally) cancelled TV show that had an active fandom: Leverage, Merlin, White Collar, The Musketeers; all stuff I was peripherally aware of at the time. I find it quite comforting to know there’s a complete narrative ready to watch, and lots of fan material to devour afterwards and nostalgic friends to talk with. Sometimes just a few years’ hindsight can make the problematic elements feel archaeological: the implicit faith procedural shows have in law enforcement, for example, is tinted differently in hindsight.\n\nI love the way you frame it: If a cancelled tree falls in the woods and twitter isn't around to hear it, has any further harm really been served? I think it speaks to the value of consuming things privately, and enjoying them for yourself. Having close friends who know that you’re listening to Michael Jackson (because you enjoy pop music and there’s no collaborative text that’s untouched by people-who-have-behaved-badly) is going to be different to an acquaintance seeing your public Spotify activity and sees it as endorsement of his behaviour. It feels like a very tired adage to say not everything you do has to be public or online, and I can see how the tension of lockdown meaning you have no public life offline, making it even more tempting to reach out to people by sharing what media you’re consuming. You’re absolutely right about how you broadcast those actions, and I want to play with that metaphor some more in a post-broadcast world! I’m wondering if we could embrace personal narrowcasting when it comes to conspicuous consumption. Does everyone need to know what you’re watching/listening to/playing/reading all the time?\n\nTo hopefully not-too-clunkily segue into talking about food, that idea of public/conspicuous consumption definitely feeds this problem of self-identification through consumption and the implicit moral worth of it. It’s like how restaurants are pressured to create visually-appealing, Instagrammable food at the expense of taste, and to counter it there’s an ‘ugly’ food movement. Sometimes, our favourite artist is a box of mac and cheese, or chocolate produced ny child labour. Or we’re warming up leftovers in tupperware, or we tweet about what we had for lunch even when it’s just an egg sandwich. What we consume, and how we communicate what we consume, and whether we’re also consuming moral values in that process—we’re going to hit the word limit before we untangle that.\n\nFinally, to address the question of streaming and getting releases a day early: I don’t think so! Usually if it’s something streaming, we get it at an unusual time of day to match the American launch hour. I know with some Disney/Netflix shows, episodes appear very conveniently around dinnertime for a Californian midnight. Sometimes the seasonal divide feels stark, though: as a horror fan I love celebrating Halloween, despite it being completely abstract. Really, though, I think a lot of it is what we bring when we engage with a text, especially music. Lorde obtains that synaesthetic summer-ness (maybe she composed it in NZ summer?) because that’s where you were when the album found you. Maybe it will hit home differently with southern-hemisphere audiences come December. It’s something I love about being a fan: letting something find you when it finds you, and as many of us are doing at the moment, coming back to a story when you need it again.\n\nJenessa Williams, UK\n\nI think you touch on something really interesting when you talk about the relationship between the value of queer and minoritized readings and fangirling in person. This idea of using social media to try out identities that maybe don’t quite feel fully comfortable in offline spaces just yet is so important – I know that I definitely benefitted from this in my mid-to-late teens, coming to terms with my mixed-race identity and beginning to properly embrace my heritage through exposure to intersectional feminist theory and black musicianship on twitter and Tumblr. Pop culture was a huge vessel for that, and The global element of fandom is so important here too – in my little pocket of predominantly white England, who knows how long this journey might have taken me without the multi-cultural world I carried around on my phone in my back pocket?\n\nI full relate to the joy of discovering things that are already complete too, especially with TV. Being out of the loop in that way definitely takes the pressure off of having a hot take - we academics and journalists are so used to consuming things through an analytical lens that I think it’s easy to forget to be a fan for the sheer pleasure of it. No consumption is ever entirely passive, of course, but I can tell you that when this teaching term is over, I look forward to embracing some seriously low-brain impact fandoms! I’ve never been much of a gamer, but Animal Crossing New Horizons has been my saving grace during this pandemic. A low-stakes world with little to no peril, a string of repetitive tasks and creativity as complex as you want to make it…it felt utterly meditative when the news was at its worst. Watching the way that that game has united so many demographics of fandom has been so wonderful to see, and a keen reminder not to dismiss certain texts because they feel ‘lightweight’ in their field. Without the pandemic, who knows if I ever would have made the time for that kind of simple joy? Now that I have, I really hope to protect that as a fandom that I keep purely for myself.\n\nI think we’re definitely similar in our interest in the pressure of having to ‘perform’ the things you like, as you say, and having to make those pleasures palatable. There is a real fulfillment that comes from sharing your interests and talking about them online in order to connect with your community, but my thoughts return to that of guilty pleasures. ‘ I know this person is problematic but’…”I know I shouldn’t like this anymore but”…are phrases that I often see on my timeline, presumably from people who enjoy sharing but also worry that people might misinterpret enjoyment as total endorsement. I completely understand that impulse and desire to explain, and yet it must be tiring trying to add this context every time, to perform a sense of morality and knowledge instead of maybe just quietly consuming the thing instead? I think you’re onto something with personal narrowcasting, but I don’t know which is better – it’s jarring to think that somebody might be tweeting for transgender rights while simultaneously extolling the virtues of JK Rowling’s wonderful storytelling in their personal life. But then again, we also can’t pretend that those texts immediately die just because of our opinions of their creator. Which all serves to bring us all the way back to the top of this never-ending soul-searching cycle!\n\nMaybe this is an interesting way to think about our host’s theory of textual poaching – leaving the problematic elements aside, poaching the bits you like, coming back and forth as and when you need it. Being okay with that nuance in yourself, and leaving room for others to find their own balance feels like a way through, even if it isn’t always entirely comfortable. We do still need to deeply address the various injustices that occur in entertainments industries, and work together to demonstrate how those communities can learn to become safer spaces for us all. In terms of my own fan practice, I’m still not sure how I feel personally about consuming art by problematic people - at current, I err on the side of not wanting to financially contribute to them any further, and a great deal of music I once loved has simply lost its listening appeal given that I can’t not think about what they have done. Nonetheless, I consistently try to remind myself that there are many different degrees of ‘wrong’ out there, just as there are many different types of way to perceive art. It’s not a conversation I suspect will yield definitive answers soon, but I’m learning so much in the process of trying and talking and realising just what fandom means to different people. Isn’t that what all of this academic fun is about?\n\nFinally, a more silly aside on the subject of music fandom: when American and British bands tour Australia, the tour merchandise tends to be designed with lots of touristic imagery: kangaroos, beer, and down under jokes. Of course, the central novelty to the band is being-in-Australia, but to a fan, it’s not novel at all. It can feel bizarre to represent an international band with imagery of borderline-nationalist Australiana. It’s a particularly minor example of what you mention: suddenly becoming aware of your perceived otherness as Australian, despite identifying yourself through fandom before nationality. That, along with the rarity and price of women’s-fit shirts, is probably why I got so into making my own patches and tees.\n\nJenessa Williams, UK\n\nI find such a relatability in feeling like your fandom is primarily online. I am so fortunate to have friends (and a fiancé) who care about music just as much as I do, but who maybe don’t share my tendency to fixate on analysis of lyrics or setlists or interviews. I am immensely grateful to the Internet for that; Twitter and reddit can sometimes feel like very hostile places, but there is always someone out there who cares about a band more than you do or has some special easter-egg insight that can enrich your own.\n\nAll of that said, your in-person comic fandom meet-up sounds so wonderful. Did you find that the tone or range of conversation differs significantly in these spaces? I’m glad you’ve been able to take what sounds like an extremely well-earnt break, but how have community members stayed in touch/ related to comics during this time? I have found something interesting in thinking about how the pandemic has helped us to slide into certain comforts; re-consuming childhood shows instead of always seeking out new ones, maybe deciding to revisit the familiarities of that ‘cancelled’ artist or text you thought you’d sworn off years ago. For many of my PhD interviewees, the overwhelmingly mortality and fear of Covid-19 has served to put some things into a kind of personal perspective; if bringing out that old Michael Jackson vinyl or JK Rowling book serves you a private comfort in your own home in the midst of seeing apocalypse, is it really akin to support? If a cancelled tree falls in the woods and twitter isn't around to hear it, has any further harm really been served?\n\nBad jokes aside, I think it definitely speaks to your point about whether fans are placing expectations on each other for the ‘right’ thing to do. You can definitely see that tension play out in online spaces, varying from artist to artist, case to case. The reasons for this I’m still figuring out (and I doubt if there will be ever be a hard-and-fast blueprint), but it does seems to me to have something to do with the nature of what has been said or done, and the timespan in which it occurred. An allegation of recent violent sexual misconduct will understandably cause more uproar than an uneducated tweet dug up from years prior, but the end result of ‘cancellation’ are very often the same. And what does ‘cancellation’ actually mean? We all have a right to decide that we no longer want to consume an artist’s work, and that isn’t necessarily akin to personally making it our business to ensure that a disgraced artist should never be allowed to make a piece of art again. Perhaps it comes down to the nature of how your broadcast those actions; the difference between quietly continuing to listen to a CD that you already own, and vocally using your online platform to suggest that others should do the same. Deplatforming, and ‘cancellation’, I feel, are not necessarily the exact same thing, but tend to get weaponised as such.\n\nFood is not something I have ever really thought about academically, but I love the way you’re thinking about it; the idea that we have ‘’low’ and highbrow culture, important cultural texts and ‘trash’ pleasures. I’m really interested in how feminist methods and scholarship have changed over the years to try and move away from this mode of denigrating certain media texts as inherently bad, or in telling audiences what is worthwhile for them to like. It’s something I try to be mindful of as a researcher; not assuming that I understand why a participant likes what they like before I give them the opportunity to tell me for themselves.\n\nTo think about your edible metaphor even more, something else I am really interested is the financial and cultural value of the food, the supermarket experience of consuming music. I am keenly following the work being done by Professor David Hesmondhalgh at my home university about digital economies in the streaming age, exploring the ways that we have come to treat music as total commodity. Being in Australia, does streaming now mean that you get global album releases a day early? From a fan perspective I hope that that is some kind of small consolation to the years that you have felt distanced or dismissed as a fan, but I do think the pittance paid for music has definitely contributed to a feeling of powerlessness when it comes to cancellation or even some cases of full fan embodiment, the feeling that buying music is maybe less of an emotional engagement point than it once was.\n\nI am writing from Narrm, also known as Melbourne, in so-called Australia. I live on Kulin Nations land, where sovereignty was never ceded. This always was, and always will be, Aboriginal land. I am part of a settler culture writing about my transnational fan experiences: my identity and community are strongly linked to British and American cultures through ongoing processes of imperialism. When I have been welcomed to country as a fan scholar, it has been through a shared love of storytelling, and understanding how stories create joy, a sense of connection, a continued history and maps of the future. In Wurundjeri tradition, songlines https://www.deadlystory.com/page/culture/Life_Lore/Songlines are maps rendered in song: a map is a song, and a song is a story, and a story is shared. Deadly Story explains: ‘Songlines are the singing celebration of Country, a cultural passport when walking on the lands of neighbouring Nations and a way to acknowledge the great Creator Spirits and their footprints in the land.’ Fandom is a celebration of stories, and communities formed around those stories. It’s an honour to live somewhere with such a strong connection between place and storytelling, where stories are part of how we travel between nations.\n\nMy fannishness began, and continues to be, primarily online. In some ways, the illusion of placelessness in virtual communities allows me to skirt the uncomfortable history and awkward geography of Australia, connecting me to fans and discovering new fandoms through international communities. In my early days of fandom, national identity was little more than an inconvenience. Being Australian meant a poor internet connection, a six-to-eighteen month wait for new seasons of television—if we got it at all—expensive concert tickets, delayed release of films, and a sparse community with loci in steeply-priced conventions and snobbish specialty shops. Meeting Aussies on forums was an opportunity for commiseration, the solidarity of being stuck on a continent as distant from each other as the British users were from New Yorkers. There were in-jokes about drop bears and ambassadorial exchanges involving Vegemite.\n\nThese days, my online fandom friends are mostly North American, British, and European: the media we fan over tends to be American or British: easy journeys from the literal south to the global north. Social media allows us to overlook a sense of place: excepting a reluctant acknowledgment of time zones, we celebrate the myth that our community is unconfined by borders and places. The servers that host our blogs and groupchats; the factories that built the devices we use to access media; even the locations where our favourite films were shot: we don’t have to acknowledge the global networks that make it seem simple. For me, the escapist joy of fandom is in part an escape from nationality: it makes this piece surprisingly hard to write.\n\nI met my spouse through a fan community. I moved to England and lived with them for a year, though we both decided we preferred Australia. We travel as fans, going to concerts, exhibitions, and locations that relate our fannish interests. A clerk at the Alexandre Dumas’ chateau is delighted that The Three Musketeers are popular in Australia. A mother in Maranouchi is as excited by a display of vintage Star Wars toys as we are. I discover while in Tokyo that Tataouine is a real place in Tunisia. I write fanfiction where Tusken Raiders use Australian sign language (Auslan is as different from American Sign Language as English is from French). My friend in Argentina leaves kudos on it. The narrative picks up all these pieces on its journey around the world. I don’t know a lot about songlines, but I understand how a story can carry you somewhere. Some of the people I meet along the way are friends for a minute, and some I’ll keep for a lifetime. It’s like Kelly Sue Deconnick said: “You don't get that tattoo because you are a fan of something in the book. You get that tattoo because that book is a fan of something in you.” So we meet as fans of Bitch Planet, but we end up being fans of each other.\n\nBut I suspect the reason I was asked to write this piece was because I’m a founder of the All Star Women’s Comic Book Club. For six years we ran monthly meetings here in Melbourne: our well-earned break happened to time up with the pandemic. When we first started, we promised ourselves that if it were just five of us—five entire women, reading comics, just in our city! It seemed too marvellous to be true—it would be more than enough. As it turned out, our smallest meetings were 20 members. The biggest ran up into the 80s. Every month there would be regulars who’d come along just to see each other, and newcomers who’d never met another comic reader in their city. To have a place, and real people coming together, sharing food and hugging and flicking through the book of the month, is unbelievably special. It was a fan community that didn’t need to be transnational to exist.\n\nAs is well observed within fan scholarship, cultural fandom offers a way to connect, celebrate, signal, and buttress a sense of national and cultural identity for those parted, for whatever reason, from their homelands. Moreover, it creates the possibility for immigrant communities to if not quite transform their new locales, then to at least impact them culturally. A cultural flow that sometimes comes full circle. North America, South America and Australasia are just a few places with strong Irish folk music traditions. Moreover, this music genre has not only taken root worldwide but developed emergent expressions, often secured via international industry/media support. (A cross-cultural diffusion assisted by evolutions in digital technologies and social media as much as human migration and international travel.) Celtic music fusions include, for example, American roots music (such as, bluegrass, old-time), Celtic hip hop, Celtic Reggae, and Celtic Punk. Bluegrass music is particularly interesting in the context of our discussion because it perfectly illustrates the idea that cultural/media phenomena not only inform but are informed by the events, communities, and worlds around and adjacent to them. Irish and Scottish immigrants, for example, organically created—incorporating African American blues and jazz traditions too—a new soundscape for a new socio-cultural experience. And today, centuries later, this once emergent, highly localized music form is celebrated and enjoyed back, as the original immigrants might have put it, in the Old Country, and beyond. (The large number of bluegrass and country music festivals demonstrate how popular these music genres are in Ireland, such as Ballydehob’s “Heart and Home” festival.) It is also worth noting that technological advances in the early to mid-1900s, such as the gramophone and the radio, carried this music down from the seclusion of the mountains and into the public domain, inside the US and beyond.\n\nWe see this transformational promise in men’s ball games too. Irish immigrants, for example, brought Gaelic football and hurling to Argentina, North America, and Australia amongst other countries. Outside Ireland, however, these Celtic ball games still occupy a marginal status. But Australian rules football—aka “Aussie Rules”—illustrates transcultural processes arising from human migration and colonization. Aussie Rules football developed from a mix of Anglo and Celtic ball games—such as Caid (an early form of Gaelic football)—brought to Australia by Irish and British immigrants in the early part of the nineteenth century. Aussie Rules is a hugely popular national game—highest attendance for any sport in Australia—and illustrates the flow of one cultural phenomenon to another territory, a transformative process that sees the source material adapted and ultimately, though not necessarily, becoming something new and distinctive. Sometimes this emergent form migrates to new territories too. Aussie Rules football is played in New Zealand, for example, and attempts have been made—mostly by Australian emigrants—to bring the game to Ireland and the UK. Media coverage (and thus advertising), of course, plays a huge role in the mainstreaming and internationalization of traditional/local sports.\n\nIrish dancing too whilst popular at home and within the Irish diaspora saw a national and global boost in response to a performance of step dance—a form of Irish dance—during an interval of the 1994 Eurovision Song Contest, an event hosted that year by Ireland. A seven-minute performance spawning the stage show known as Riverdance. This phenomenally popular show not only changed the nature of Irish dancing but liberated it from its Irish moorings (island and diaspora). “Riverdance”, as Breandán de Gallaí—a lead dancer—commented, “has changed dancing forever. It brought it to the world.”[1] But it also helped change, or better rehabilitate, the idea of “Irishness” both on and beyond the island. (It drew attention away from, for instance, reductive international Irish stereotypes—such as the idea of the “Fighting Irish” (a widespread cliché still, for example, providing the prejudicial name and logo for the University of Notre Dame’s football team, the “Notre Dame Fighting Irish”) or Ireland as a land full of riotously-mournful hard drinkers—and towards the idea of the Irish as “lively, fun loving, innovative people”.[2] Alongside rapid social and economic change (i.e., the “Celtic Tiger” economy of the mid-1990s-late 2000s), Riverdance was critical to national attempts to reposition “Ireland globally and culturally, representing a contemporary Irish identity to both the Irish themselves and to the world.”[3] A clear example here of media/culture industries and a national government working to build and wield cultural and imagological soft power.\n\nFurthermore, Riverdance fan activities commonly stretch to include embodied practices whereby fans worldwide seek to learn Irish dancing and/or musicianship and costuming style and so forth. Dancing-fans may also incorporate dance styles local to their region into their Irish dancing performances thereby appropriating not only Riverdance but Irish dancing itself, a transformative process allowing them to, as with Bluegrass music and Aussie Rules football, make something quite new. And as another quick example of multidirectional transcultural engagement and flow, Riverdance itself incorporates international dance styles on stage, including Russian folk, American tap, and the aforementioned Spanish flamenco. “Official” recognition of Riverdance’s transnational and transcultural dimensions is significant for several reasons not least because of its suggestion that the “powers that be” do not wish to enforce national and cultural borders but to instead work with a more expansive, global idea of Irish dance and perhaps even “Irishness” itself, a particularly heartening development given Ireland’s increasingly diverse population.\n\nBut we should remember that not all transnational fandom is transcultural, and vice versa. Moreover, and evoking the debate around the value of the idea of “transnational” fandom (e.g., see Chin and Morimoto 2013 and the trio of opening statements and discussion kicking off this “Global Fandom” series) it’s not always useful to distinguish fan practices in relation to geographical border-crossings. For instance, regarding transcultural fandom, non-Irish Irish dancers do not always wish to enfold or combine local/national/regional elements into their Irish dancing/Riverdance performances or vice versa, nor indeed to suggest a sense of “Irishness”. As with much worldwide K-Pop fandom, many of these fan-dancers wish to merely signal an enjoyment, or passion, for the cultural phenomenon in question, be it Riverdance or Irish dancing (or both).\n\nSimilarly, although speaking with reference to fannish nationalistic displays, when American fans of Niall Horan, an unabashed Irish folk-pop singer, united at a concert in Cleveland, Ohio to create a shimmering Irish tricolor (Ireland’s national flag) with their mobile phones they were not displaying the flag to signal Irish identity—though some may claim Irish heritage—nor to, momentarily, transform their national identity but to welcome, celebrate, and connect with Horan. As one fan said, “He loves his country so He will definitely appreciate it.” Yet when music fans within the Irish diaspora display Irish tricolor flags at “rebel” music events they do so to actively signal and reconfirm their Irishness, to themselves, to each other, and to the world at large. So, when The Wolfe Tones—a hugely popular “rebel” group—play venues around the world and fans bring out their Irish tricolours (and wear their Celtic football jerseys) they are doing a little more than welcoming and connecting with the band; their displays (are meant to) indicate, to celebrate, an Irish identity and a direct connection to Ireland. Further complicating our understanding of fannish nationalistic and cultural displays—flags, jerseys, and so forth—are the intergenerational fannish practices performed by Irish Nationalists in the North of Ireland. For example, at a recent Wolfe Tones concert in West Belfast fans donned Celtic football jerseys and flourished Irish tricolours, much like diasporic Wolfe Tone fans around the world. And yet these nationalistic displays were performed by Irish people on the island of Ireland, albeit a highly contested territory, one still under British colonial rule. And herein lies an example of the curiosity and complexity of thinking about fandoms viz. transnational (and transcultural) qualities in conflicted, divided territories with disputed borders, that is in places, such as Ireland, where borders often lie only in the eyes of the beholders. As we see here, Horan fans and Wolfe Tone fans use flag displays and so forth to publicly connect with their fan objects, but—by also signaling a national/cultural identity—those within the Irish diaspora and in the North of Ireland—are doing a little bit more.\n\nAs we see, studying fandom in (and orientated towards) territories marked by historical political conflict and contested national or regional borders, as in Spain and Ireland, proves a particularly rich pursuit, and like all good discussion, ours has raised more questions than it answered.\n\n[JDFP} I think the debate has been very fruitful and has allowed us to present a large number of representative examples from both countries, as well as many common fan phenomena. Both Spain and Ireland are two peripheral countries with significant cultural heritage that perhaps does not correspond to their media presence. Undoubtedly the migrant fan communities have helped to make these traditions visible throughout the world. However, as Ellen points out, “not all transnational fandom is transcultural, and vice versa”. That is why I think we have to pay attention to media phenomena that are capable of enhancing popular culture beyond its identity or nationalist expression. Probably the transnationality of a fan phenomenon requires the germ of one or several local communities that, without a doubt, will adapt this fandom to their own practices. While a transcultural fan phenomenon must also be based on local values that will have to be accepted and shared wherever they go. When we speak of local or global fandoms we are referring simply to the focus on the origin or current expansion of the phenomenon. The media industries cannot make a fandom global without local scale, nor can a local fandom be understood today without its global ramifications.\n\n[EK] I have very much enjoyed the opportunity to find out more about fandom in Spain, and it is heartening to think that our discussion could have taken many other paths that would have proven just as rewarding and enjoyable. Though I do think—and especially when discussing cultural phenomena and fandom in (and adjacent to) contested territories—that issues of cultural identity are always present and felt in our discussions, even when they are (consciously or unconsciously) overlooked. Every act, as conceptual artist Daniel Burren, reminds us, “is political and, whether one is conscious of it or not, the presentation of one's work is no exception”. Moreover, I remain unconvinced of the value and merit of aspiring to the goal of transcending issues around cultural identity in our work, especially given the current state of fandom and Fan Studies. For, as Rukmini Pande previously observed, “No media text or fandom is free from issues and hierarchies of power around representations of identity, relationships, and desire.” And neither is scholarship. As with many others, I hold that fan scholars should be actively prioritizing such matters within their discussions, especially perhaps those exploring notions of “border-crossing” fandom and phenomena. Finally, I would like to express my sincerest thanks to Julian for the discussion and to Henry for the opportunity to be part of this global jamboree.\n\nReferences\n\nChin, B., & Morimoto, L. H.

We looked at the ways in which adolescents in the fan community transformed the status of the object they loved from celebrity to hero, someone in whom they developed affective attachments of admiration and love. This encouraged us to investigate the identity processes that arise from fandom (Lacasa Díaz et al., 2017 18) We looked at the role of memories in the construction of the self, from the perspective of a subjective identity in which both personal and collective dimensions are present. For fans, the celebrity was more than a musician because the music becomes a vehicle for intimacy around which the adolescent identity is organised as a way of living in and understanding the world.\n\nAt this point, our interest turned to the civic activism of these groups through social media (Lacasa Díaz et al., 2019 19) We believe that social networks have transformed fan communities, and also teenagers' skills when it comes to managing these digital environments. The teenagers’ practices in relation to their presence in fan communities are dependent on the use of multimodal discourse, especially photography and remixes, which are associated with forms of creative expression. The study invites the reader to think about the new forms of citizenship in which young people are involved, far removed from what these concepts traditionally mean in social sciences, where they tend to be associated with adulthood.\n\nMore recently, we focus on the personal relationships of friendship that are established between members of a community (de la Fuente & Lacasa, 2020 20). We have find that contacts are sought by exploring the information provided by the participants in online and offline settings. It is this information that allows them to select who they want to interact with or which containment mechanisms they can use to avoid certain participants. However, these contacts can be established on a double level, which the researchers have called macro and micro. The macro level focusses on the broader fan community and the micro level deals with the interpersonal relationships, with interaction taking place between the two levels.\n\nFinally, to these multiple perspectives adds the content industry, whose strategies for integrating media practices of fans are currently studying by our research group.\n\nRegarding fandom studies in my country, their origin are relatively recent. We could point to its takeoff during the last decade, especially associated with media studies (Prego-Nieto, 2020 15) However, fan communities could be documented since the mid-70s of the 20th century, after a military dictatorship that during 40 years limited the right of assembly of people, as well as censored access to foreign cultural content. Until well into the 21st century, most of the most popular fan phenomena were associated with content from traditional culture, such as bullfighting, religious brotherhoods, sports such as boxing or soccer, and Spanish light music.\n\nEven today, the word fan in Spain refers to the fanatical followers of some soccer teams or to the “frikis” (sic.) geeks of certain minority content such as role-playing games, science fiction or manga (Martínez, 2020 7). I can't say that being a fan in Spain is frowned upon, but it is true that in many cases there is no strong identity for this social phenomenon. For instance, as a result of the generalized political protests throughout the country as of May 15, 2011, the “indignados” movement emerged, which has hardly been analyzed since the conception of the political fandom (Hernández-Santaolalla & Rubio-Hernández, 2017 8 ) So there is still a long way to go for these fan communities to be recognized according to their social influence. However, among the youth these conceptions are changing. Thanks to social networks, many international fan phenomena have landed in Spain (Cassany, 2018 6) participating in much wider networks and establishing links with other Spanish-speaking countries, especially in America. In this sense, the impact of globalization on Spanish fandom is undeniable, with communities especially active around phenomena such as video games, audiovisual fiction, and musical groups. Among many other international phenomena, young Spanish people participate in the K-pop fandom (Rodriguez Castillo, 2021 9), especially significant in Latin America.\n\nLikewise, you can highlight other phenomena international fandoms whose origins are Spanish influencers; As is the case with the Twitch Streamers, some of which are among the most viewed worldwide such as @AuronPlay or the Booktubers, which also have a large community of fans (de la Torre-Espinosa, 2019 12). In this sense, the globalization of fandom in Spain during the last decade has allowed both the introduction and export of these cultural phenomena to the whole world, especially among Spanish-speaking people.\n\nHowever, the best-studied fan phenomenon in Spain, probably due to its international repercussion, is that of television series (López-Villafranca & Ruiz-Muñoz, 2017 3) The visibility of this phenomenon through social networks, together with the accessibility of these contents by TV platforms have created the conditions for a massive phenomenon whose target is also much broader than other content such as music or video games. Nevertheless, in many of these studies the social audience for these shows is confused with the development of a true community of fans.\n\nActually, in Spain one of the first examples of fandom on television would be the Eurovision Song Contest (EBU, 1956-current) but we would have to wait until the arrival of Game of Thrones (HBO, 2011-2019) to talk about a community of fans visible through social networks. In fact, the appearance of this fan community was encouraged during season 4 of the TV series in 2014, thanks to th"
