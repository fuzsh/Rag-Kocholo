        "text": "“Event media” are media companies that produce events in order to serve their own purposes, whether these are commercial, public-service oriented, or both. For the television industry, creating big program events with a strong sense of unfolding here and now has become increasingly important – and this thesis asks why and how. It thereby examines a broad program trend, which reality-tv entertainment is a marked exponent of with programs like Big brother and Idols, but which also is represented in more educational and informative programs like Test your vote and Great X. These programs bring three industry shifts to the fore. First, their production is crossing the borders between nations, industry sectors and companies. Second, they fuel the transition of broadcasters into full-fledged media houses. Third, they turn audiences into participants on a large scale. The evolving practices on these areas are keys to the future of television, both in industrial and public life terms.\n\nPublic-service broadcasters are compelled to seek innovative ways to fulfil their public- service functions in an increasingly competitive environment. The Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) has been experimenting with new programme formats and cross-media concepts. The concept of slow television was developed by the regional office in Bergen. On July 16, 2011, they started a five-day live broadcast from one of the cruise ships that sailed up the Norwegian coast from Bergen in southern Norway to Kirkenes near the Rus- sian border. The broadcast was a huge success. I take this programme as a case study and provide an analysis from the perspective of innovation within public-service broadcasting. The article addresses the following questions: 1) In what way was the programme innova- tive? 2) How was the programme accepted and produced? 3) What accounts for the success of the broadcast in terms of number of viewers and popular engagement?\n\nInternational trade and cooperation are increasingly affecting what we experience in the national and local media. This development is rapidly evolving with live televised events, like Idols and Dancing with the Stars, and here I pursue why (and how) this is so. I engage specifically with the ways in which licensed international programme formats intervene in existing programme traditions, and affect the repertoire and capacity of national television producers. I trace the practices of the two largest Norwegian broadcasters over the last two decades. The question is not only how licensed formats affect different industry sectors, in this case license-funded NRK and commercial TV 2, but also how different units within the broadcasters are impacted. The article calls for heightened sensitivity to new forms of control and collaboration in creative processes, and new routines for premeditating live events. It suggests that format exchange should be evaluated along a continuum from open to closed; a continuum that can bring nuance to discussions of cultural colonisation.\n\nDrawing on an analysis of three entertainment formats with a participatory element provided by new technology, the article discusses to what degree contemporary TV production is in transition as a result of technological convergence. A point of departure is the host–audience ‘parasocial’ relationship and experienced intimacy at a distance, which was already identified in the early days of television. The article argues that, with the introduction of digital return channels and the increased production of multi-platform formats, the audience has become an external production unit. Its members are expected to provide feedback to the programme, and the producers are dependent on their text messages and votes to be included in the narrative and thus have a certain degree of influence on the production. The hosts thus encourage viewers to engage via digital return channels, and use techniques such as pedagogic instructions, sales strategies and semi-private intimacy. As a result, TV production is increasingly about producing a dialogue with the viewers, and about facilitating ‘social TV’ experiences via second platform interactivity.\n\nSince the mid-­‐1990s, media institutions have been experimenting with new forms of audience participation. Based on interviews with Norwegian media leaders, this article provides insight into how media executives think strategically about audience input, as well as the seven most important reasons why they are focusing on audience participation. The article asks what a focus upon audience participation means for the role of media in society.\n\nSince the mid-1990s, media institutions have been experimenting with new forms of audience participation. Based on interviews with Norwegian media leaders, this article provides insight into how media executives think strategically about audience input, as well as the seven most important reasons why they are focusing on audience participation. The article asks what a focus upon audience participation means for the role of media in society.\n\nThis thesis is a study of how established institutions within the media and telecom industries act in times of change, using the first decade of the 2000s as its time frame. As an emerging field that has inspired high expectations but also much uncertainty, mobile media has been a leading subject of scholarly investigation. Located mainly within the management of technological innovation tradition, this thesis discusses how incumbent institutions, with their legacies from the traditional media and telecom industries, make sense of the mobile device as a media platform, as well as how they translate their perceptions into plans and actions. Furthermore, this thesis connects the development of mobile media to other, more far-reaching developments—technological, cultural and economic—within the media and telecom industries. Hence it considers how mobile-media perceptions and facilitations are related to the more general developments of media convergence, changing audience relations and challenging new-media business models. It concentrates on well-established institutions from the Norwegian media and telecom markets—the incumbent telecom operator Telenor, the public service broadcaster NRK, the tabloid newspaper VG, the commercial television channel TV 2 and the commercial radio channel P4 in particular.\n\nThe article discusses the background and origins of research on media institutions as a field, and especially assesses the development and status of Norwegian research on broad- casting institutions. It is demonstrated how the field has developed, both quantitatively and qualitatively, through three key phases: the era of broadcasting monopolies; the “new media situation” in the 1980s and 1990s; and the era of convergence; globalization and commercialization from the late 1990s. A key purpose is to discuss the theoretical perspec- tives and implicit and explicit assumptions upon which the research is based. Further, the article points to shortcomings and gaps in our knowledge of how media institutions evolve and operate. In closing, it is suggested how the field may maintain its relevance in an era where the very concept of a “broadcasting institution” is becoming more blurred.\n\nProduction studies have become popular over the past decade. Recent studies have analysed, amongst other things, innovation, management strategies and the effects of convergence on editorial processes. There have only been a few studies that have analysed what happened inside media organisations in the earlier transformative stages (outside the UK and the USA). This paper analyses how the Norwegian public service broadcaster (NRK) adapted to the loss of its monopoly and the beginning of competition during the mid-1980s. It provides a window into how the flagship of public service, the Enlightenment Department, dealt with the new situation.If one follows the production process of the main programme of the department (with the revealing working title ‘Flagship’) from its conception to its realisation as a weekly programme broadcast in prime time, this reveals how innovation at the time was restricted by organisational arrangements, internal values and external pressures.
