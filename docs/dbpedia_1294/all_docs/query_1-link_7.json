Please help improve it or discuss these issues in the talk.\n\nNRK P1 is a nationwide digital Norwegian-language radio channel in Norway, owned by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK).\n\nChannel description[]\n\nNRK P1 is Norway’s largest radio station, with more than one million listeners each day. Regional reports, news, current affairs, public service material, and music continue to be the main ingredients in the recipe that makes P1 Norway’s first choice among radio listeners.\n\nChannel history[]\n\nIn 1923, the first test broadcasts were made in Norway. With a state licence, private companies and radio enthusiasts were able to found Kringkastingsselskapet in Oslo on 29 April 1925. In radio's infancy, you had to have royal permission to listen to the radio in this country. In the monopoly era, the police came and caught those who tried to use some private \"local radio\". Norway's first broadcasting was a distinctly music broadcasting. The majority was live music. The lecture (Foredraget) was the largest verbal record, but right from the start, radio drama and children's programs were also attempted. News and message service has accompanied the radio since its infancy. The radio was seen as an ideal medium for disseminating weather warnings.\n\nThe new medium soon spread. The broadcasting network was expanded and more and more social strata began to listen to the radio. There were broadcasting companies in other large Norwegian cities, but also soon demands that radio operation should be a public task. When the Storting passed a separate Broadcasting Act in 1933, it was decided here that all broadcasting in Norway was to be monopolized and all operations gathered in a state-owned company. On 1 July 1933, Norsk Rikskringkasting (NRK) started its operations and at the same time took over the private broadcasting companies that had until then been responsible for the radio service in and around the big cities. Thus, Norway, like most other European countries, got a state institution with a monopoly on all broadcasting. With a broadcasting company, there was also momentum in the work to unite Norway into one radio empire. Thus the channel continued as the only nationwide broadcasting channel until NRK Television started regular broadcasts in 1960.\n\nThe radio quickly became a mass medium. Radios became common in Norwegian homes, and the radio a national means of communication. As early as 1940, more than half of the country's inhabitants could receive NRK.\n\nThen came the Second World War in 1940. Having control over the new mass medium the radio was considered very important. The occupying power Germany took control of NRK. Soon, just having a radio set was banned. Because then you could listen to foreign radio and from London the Norwegian government-in-exile sent radio broadcasts that could be taken into Norway. The Germans wanted Norwegians to hear their version of reality. Therefore, the Germans decided that most people had to hand in their radios. Some dared to hide their radios and continued to listen to the radio, but now in secret. Thus, the content from London could be spread further among people. Coded and important messages were also sent from London to the Norwegian resistance movement. The radio's free message threatened those who had taken command of the country. From London, a Norwegian voice could be heard that had a completely different perception of the world situation.\n\nIn Norway, the Germans spread their own version of how the war developed through strictly censored newspapers and German-produced film magazines, shown in Norwegian cinemas. The radio broadcasts from London became an important point of reference in the freedom struggle.\n\nAfter the war, radio entered its golden age. The radio with its one NRK program, P1, as the mainstay of everyday life. The evening news on the radio was like today's Dagsrevyen. The time signal was the private and public chronometer. The radio brought news and messages, the radio brought public information, and the radio brought sports and entertainment.\n\nBeyond the 1950s, radio cabinets dominated Norwegian living rooms and gathered families around them. Saturday evenings with shows in the Store Studio, Monday evenings with the Wish Concert. Rolf Kirkvaag became a folk hero and the sports broadcasts kept people glued to their televisions. Alf Prøysen and Thorbjørn Egner came and enchanted the little ones.\n\nAlready in 1954, Norway got its first FM transmitter at Voss, but there was no speed in development until the 1960s and 1970s. At the same time as TV transmitters were installed across the country, FM transmitters were also installed.\n\nStereo had already in the 1950s become a new standard for discs and tape recordings. In 1969, the first test broadcasts in stereo in the FM network came from NRK in the Oslo area. In 1975, stereo broadcasts were also started in the Trondheim, Bergen and Bodø area. At the same time as FM transmitters became more and more numerous, stereo broadcasts likewise, AM broadcasts were still broadcast on both medium, short and long wave.\n\nThe transition to a new radio era happened over time, people bought FM radios in turn and soon the vast majority listened to FM and stereo broadcasts.\n\nThe radio program changed its character from a leisure and evening program to a 24-hour service. The district offices were greatly expanded. Radiosporten could have up to a million listeners on its \"Over til...\" broadcasts. The radio showed that it had possibilities also in the age of television.\n\nOn 16 December 1981, the broadcasting monopoly was broken. There were 39 broadcast permits that were granted by the Ministry of Culture on 16 December 1981. Soon there was diversity in the airwaves. NRK, for its part, was allowed to create a Program 2 based in Trondheim. P2 goes on the air with regular broadcasts from 1 September 1984.\n\nIn the 1990s, the digitization of the radio starts. On Thursday 19 May 2011, the Storting agreed to Parliamentary Report No. 8, Digitization of the radio medium, which outlines the transition to digital radio in Norway.\n\nIn 2017, the last analogue radio transmitters were switched off and from 2018 the Norwegian nationwide radio channels have been fully digital. This means that you can listen to the radio via a DAB device, via a TV and the digital terrestrial network or via the internet. During a transition period, some local radio stations also continue to broadcast FM radio. Eventually, DAB was developed with a new standard, called DAB+ . In 2017, the transition from the FM network to digital broadcasting through the DAB+ network began. The transition included all national radio channels, including P1. The transition to DAB+ started in Nordland in January 2017 and ended with Troms and Finnmark on 13 December 2017. From this date, NRK P1 is only broadcast digitally through DAB+, and not via the FM network.\n\nThe administration of the channel as well as many of the newsrooms and broadcast studios were moved to NRK's ​​center at Tyholt in Trondheim.\n\nDespite the competition from commercial channels and other NRK channels, P1 has managed to maintain its position as the largest radio channel in Norway. In 2016, the channel had a market share of 45 per cent, while P4 was the second largest with 17.5 per cent. P1 has around 1.5 million listeners daily.\n\nServices[]\n\nRegional services[]\n\nFor the purpose of regional broadcasting on NRK, Norway is divided into 11 districts. 10 of these districts follow county boundaries and provide services in the Norwegian language, while one overlaps the other districts and provides services in the Sami languages. Each district includes one district office along with several subordinate local offices.\n\nThe district broadcasts are broadcast on NRK P1 Monday to Friday, a morning broadcast from 06.03 to 09.00 and an afternoon broadcast from 14.03 to 17.00. The broadcasts are interrupted by Dagsnytt every half hour. Each district also has two-minute long district newscasts right after Dagsnytt every full hour from 09.03–12.03, as well as a broadcast 1.30–1.32pm. On the radio, there are 15 different district broadcasts in the morning, and 14 in the afternoon. The district offices have news and current affairs broadcasts on NRK P1 every morning and afternoon Monday–Friday.
