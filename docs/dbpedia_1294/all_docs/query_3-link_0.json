        "text": "Radio station in Available nationwide\n\nNRK Sport is a brand name for sports programming produced by the sports department of Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK). The brand name is used on most national sports broadcasts on television, radio and new media.[1] NRK Sport is produced both in Norway and other countries.\n\nNRK Sport is also a radio station, which broadcasts sports programming via DAB and the internet in Norwegian.\n\nThe station airs live self-produced commentary of sports events of football matches and where NRK does not have the TV rights, and simulcasted audio from NRK1 if NRK do have the TV rights.\n\nAs of February 2024, NRK Sport had live broadcasts of, but not limited to:\n\nUEFA Europa League\n\nUEFA Conference League\n\nUEFA Women's Champions League\n\nNorwegian Football Cup\n\nHandball national team tournaments\n\nFIS Cross-Country World Cup (simulcast from NRK1)\n\nInitially and for many years afterwards, the station was only on air during sports broadcasts. Eventually, the station began playing mixed-genre music during the downtime, along with the Dagsnytt hourly NRK short newscasts. Rudimentary score updates from ongoing football matches, e.g. from the English Premier League, are occasionally interspersed into the music.\n\nAs of February 2024, two daily broadcasts specific to the channel are broadcast on weekdays:\n\nSport i dag (\"Sports Today\") at 15:00-17:00\n\nPodkast (\"Podcast\") at 17:00-18:30"
