In addition, a number of other signals like DVB-ASI, MADI, VoIP (ST2022 and ST2110), 10GigE, Audio signals (AES/Ravenna 67) and control signals (Tally/GPIO/RS-232 and RS-422) are all supported in the miniHUB™ frame concept. All signals may be either single channel per fiber or up to 18 channels of CWDM per fiber.\n\nThe flexibility provided gives our customers an almost endless range of possibilities for having a system design that matches their exact requirement.\n\nAnother feature that makes miniHUB™ unique, is the possibility of changing the configuration as the requirements change.\n\nIn other words, a transition from i.e. an HD-SDI infrastructure to a 12G-SDI infrastructure may be done on a single channel basis, allowing for moderate investments over time.\n\nSuch configuration changes may be done \"on-the-fly\" without interrupting the daily tasks.\n\nminiHUB™ is also available in a version designed for applications in extreme temperature environments. One of the largest US telco groups are using 100's of these units across the country for the transport of live sports events.\n\nAdditionally, multiple miniHUB™ 1RU frame sizes will be on display, with a maximum of either 2, 4 or 8 cards. In addition, CWDM filters may be added. All frames are, as standard, equipped with a frame controller card for monitoring and control. All frame variants support dual power supplies as well.\n\nOur HUBbox™ range of small form factor family products will also be on display. The family covers all SDI formats up to 12G-SDI. As a stand-alone, dual channel optical converter, this is the ideal product for greatly extending the distance between i.e. a camera and the control room.\n\nIt is available as a dual channel transmitter, dual channel receiver or a transceiver. In addition, CWDM lasers may be installed to interface to a CWDM system.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you at stand 11.A10\n\nNORWIA @ NAB 2023\n\nVisit Norwia at Utah Scientific Inc. booth# N3049\n\nSandefjord, Norway, March 28, 2023: Norwia will be participating at this year's NAB Show 2023, Las Vegas, 16-19 April.\n\nWe look forward to meeting existing and future customers, partners and distributors in-person at this year's NAB Show.\n\nYou can find us at our US partner's booth, Utah Scientific, located in the North Hall, booth N3049.\n\nAvailable for demonstration will be a large selection of our products and solutions, targeting a wide range of applications:\n\nSD/HD/3G/6G/12G-SDI, 4K, Quad links\n\nPoint-to-Point, CWDM, Star network, Media ring\n\n1G/10G Ethernet\n\nOptical Change-Over, Electrical Change-Over\n\nOptical transport, Optical distribution\n\nAnd many more...\n\nRegister for NAB: Use invitation code (LV5927) to receive FREE registration to the show!\n\nFeel free to schedule a meeting and/or demonstration of the products on display, or discuss your requirements and applications.
