        "text": "Yes, part of the work in newsrooms may be substituted by AI like Google's effort, see the story. But hello, AI cannot generate relevant news in very small towns, like in Hanko, where I have myself piloted hyperlocal news media. Why am I saying no job for AI ? - Just because not that much happens over here! There simply are no news 'seeds' available for AI to read in digital form. Here is the point: news stories need to be generated, by digging in, interviewing various people, authorities, enterprices, event organisers, even taxi drivers who do know what is topical in our 'village'. Summary: human touch is needed in hyperlocal news! A call for innovation still left: business model? https://lnkd.in/eEvXENxi\n\nHere are my takeaways from yesterday’s excellent Press Gazette #futuremediatechconference in London - some fabulous, others terrifying, all insightful. 1. ‘Community is the next phase of media’ In a conference dominated by AI, this assertion from Ella Dolphin at DC Thompson made me very happy and her prioritisation of Purpose very much chimed with my beliefs. I’d like to think that community can remain strong - or is even strengthened - and purpose becomes increasingly important in an AI future 2. According to Markus Karlsson from Affino that future will see all our content experiences originated by AI. A terrifying thought. General consensus among the panellists was that AI was a big deal that presented big opportunities but should be treated with caution. 3. But if AI plays as great a part in our future as is predicted, then we need to find something to do with our time, and that could well be building communities, said Marija Gavrilov of Exponential View 4. The UK is positioning itself as an AI superpower. It will take a long time for regulators to catch up with what’s happening and it’s unlikely they’ll ever produce a big cheque, fairly allocated, for content so in the meantime, make the best out of it, advises Chris Duncan, CEO of Bauer Media Group 5. Gen AI will become the search engine of the future, according to Simon Farnsworth who, with Dominic Carter outlined The Sun’s grow, develop and build strategy based on simplification and clarity of vision. 6. But don’t start with AI when building for the future, start with the problem you’re trying to solve before getting drawn into new technology, was the advice from Jon Roberts, director of technology and innovation at ITN. 7. Jon also ran through an exceptional list of potential uses for AI including metadata, search, graphics, editing, reversioning stories, translating, improving user interfaces, creating better knowledge bases. 8. Beyond AI, Nic Newman from Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism talked about how the rise of TikTok was shaping the future direction of all social media networks and the importance of authentic, creator-led content and video to adapt to platform shifts. 9. On social, a couple of points from Matt Payton at the Independent stood out - engage with readers where they are, don’t constantly try to drag them back to your site but understand and shape their next step on the journey with you. And roll with the platform changes, adapt with them, take the audience hits on the chin and keep diversifying, experimenting and lining up the next growth area. 10. And a final takeaway from media celebrity Nic Newman - negative news, the adundance of information and polarised politics are contributing to low engagement, low trust and news avoidance. Audiences are looking for a more positive agenda and more hope."
