SPORTS ECONOMICS HE 68 – COPENHAGEN BUSINESS SCHOOL – SPRING 2011 THE FUTURE AND POTENTIAL FOR SPORTS BROADCASTING Written by: Hogne Ulla CPR: 131090-3449 Signature: _______________ Email: hogne.ulla@gmail.com Not confidential\n\n2. 2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY When Brett Ormerod scored Blackpool‟s winning goal in the playoff match against Cardiff in English football (soccer) May 2010 he had every reason to celebrate. Not only was Blackpool ready for the FA Premier League, the promotion was worth a place between 70 and 90 million pounds sterling. TV rights around the world are sold at hefty sums and the number of sport pay-TV channels is growing at a rapid rate. However broadcasters face challenges and with a higher number of channels the competition and thereby prices increases. This paper will give an analysis and discussion of how sport broadcasters operate today. Even though the case at hand is from Scandinavia and based upon European football, much of the discussion may be similar in other parts of the world and to other sports. Some important and relevant aspects of broadcasting will be highlighted in this paper. The paper offers various approaches to TV2‟s challenges. With bigger competition along with changes in technology TV2 must change and react not to be left on the sideline. Nevertheless, broadcasting is a game with many players whereas sport enthusiasts, right holders and distributors are key players. Any broadcaster must recognize this and offer a service that is both preferred and priced correctly. The paper points out exclusive rights, social media and marketing as crucial factors. The conclusion sets out new areas for research and focus in the future.\n\n3. 3 INDEX 1.

Methodology I will start with some history and explain how football has been broadcasted in Norway. This includes a comparison of TV2 and state owned NRK. Secondly I will explain how TV2 operate at as a sports broadcaster including various aspects and with a main focus on the channels TV2 Sport and TV2 Barclays Premier League. Thirdly the challenges will be spelled out before I move on and discuss these and provide some possible solutions. In the end I will reach a conclusion answering the question at hand and set out new areas for research. The paper‟s focus will not be on the welfare economic perspectives of broadcasting. This matter is already covered in the body of literature on the economics of television sports broadcasting (Solberg, 2007; Spence et al, 1977; Neale, 1964).\n\n4. 4 2.2. Problem statement The problem statement is the following: How does TV2 (Norwegian) operate as a football (soccer) broadcaster and discuss the challenges they are facing? In other words, I want to use TV2 as a case and base my analysis and discussion upon their broadcasting of football. Broadcasting may be defined as “the distribution of audio and video content to a dispersed audience via radio, television, or other” (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting, retrieved 29 May 2011). 3. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION 3.1. Sports broadcasting in Norway 3.1.1 An introduction Throughout history European TV broadcasting have been dominated by public service broadcasters – so called PSBs (Solberg, 2007). Table 1 shows the three categories of broadcasting. In Norway only non-commercial and commercial broadcasters are present. Our case is the latter one. Because of broadcasting‟s high fixed costs and low variable costs it is a typical “economies of scale” production (Solberg, 2002). Figure 1 illustrates this. We must also stress that it is a public good in the sense that one person watching a game on the telly doesn‟t make it more difficult for someone else. Buying a match-day ticket for a football match may be defined as a private good because it makes it marginally more difficult for someone else to get hold of a ticket. Broadcasting‟s cost for an extra viewer, hence the marginal cost, is also very low, if not zero. Olson (1971) explains this as the non-rivalling criterion characteristic of a public good. However, Gratton et al (2007) explain that the non- excludability criterion is not satisfied. This due to the fact that even though it is possible to exclude people, namely the people not paying the fee for watching, other options like pirate cards and online streaming are available. Just in Italy over 4 million viewers used pirate cards in 2005 (Loebbecke et al, 2005). Today steaming is a bigger threat mostly because of its availability (of Premier League games) but also due to the fact that its quality has been improved just the last few years.\n\n5. 5 Table 1 – Categories of broadcasters Category Example Funding 1 – Non-commercial NRK License fees or/and public funding 2 – Semi-commercial TV Denmark License fees, public funding or/and advertising 3 – Commercial TV2 (Norway) Advertising One important difference between NRK and TV2 is that for NRK sports rights acquisitions represents a cost while TV2 eyes possible income streams through advertising, commercials, subscribers or pay-per-view fees. This situation has made NRK weaker in the sense that they have a reduced bargaining power, later this led to NRK giving up rights for a range of sporting events (http://www.klartale.no/norge/article152.zrm, retrieved 26 May 2011). There has also been pressure from politicians and the public because NRK prioritized football instead of other cultural forms. Since a live sports program is a homogeneous product, some may argue that it is irrelevant if it is TV2 or NRK displaying the game. There are not significant differences between the two channels and therefore the consumption value will be the same (Solberg, 2007). Of course, TV2 has put a lot of effort and money into their sport broadcasting, but in the end the differences in quality will be marginal. NRK has a tradition of not sending their commentators overseas, but instead send it from a studio in Oslo. This is of course not ideally for fans who want to experience how the atmosphere is at the venue. NRK is also known for their enthusiastic coverage of winter sports with well-planned reports and interviews. But when it comes to football and especially the Norwegian Tippeliga, NRK‟s coverage has been less attractive and without the same passion. Another important characteristic of sports broadcasting is the groups of audience (Merkel, 1994). Table 2 illustrates these from the smallest to the biggest. Make note of the groups‟ characteristics, these differences in segments explain the pricing and why TV2 offer both a commercial and six premium pay-TV channels. Even though the consumer group is regarded as the biggest group we must stress that in Norway sports are the most popular TV programmes (Hammervold et al, 2008). One of the critics of broadcasting is its effect on match day attendance. In the FA Premier League the facility fee paid to TV broadcasted teams will outweigh the possible loss in\n\n6. 6 revenue (Forrest el al, 2004). Still the attendance for the broadcasted Monday match in English and Norwegian football have a tendency to be rather low and especially in Norway this trend has become clearer the last few years. This has of course something to do with weekdays versus weekend, but it is no doubt that people sometimes find their armchairs more comfy than watching the game live in storm and hail. Table 2 – Groups of audience Audience group Characteristics The fan Inelastic vertical demand with respect to quality and price. Highest willingness to pay. The supporter More elastic than the fan segment, thus lower willingness to pay. The consumer Less interested in football and watches it in an often ritualistic and occasional way. Figure 1 – Cost curves for a sports broadcaster (Gaustad, 2000) 3.1.2 Tippeligaen – The Norwegian Premier Division Football broadcasting in Norway was in the late 1990s and early 2000s a joint venture consisting of the state run channel NRK and the commercial TV2. The co-operation with NRK has not always been a sunshine story. The biggest fiasco was perhaps when both channels provided the exact same pictures from the World Championship in Skiing in Price Units\n\n7. 7 Ramsau, Austria in 1999 (Solvoll, 2009). However in 1997 the French owned distributor Canal Digital was founded and with the introduction of the channel Canal+ it soon became a competitor and a threat to TV2 and NRK. When the rights for the Norwegian Premier Division and the First Division from 2002-2005 was sold TV2 and NRK won the bid. They divided the most attractive matches among themselves and sold some of the less attractive matches to Canal+. Whether this was a smart move or not is discussable. It gave Canal+ a chance to capture a slice of the market‟s pizza and sports fans a possibility to try the channel‟s services. However, because of growing interest from distributors like Canal Digital and media groups outside Norway the price escalated and the next four seasons were sold for, at that time, unbelievable 1 billion NOK. That was more than three and a half times the price for the period 2002-2005. The latest rights for 2009-2013 were sold to Lyse, NRK and TV2 for 1.2 billion NOK. Later Lyse sold their matches to TV2. But because TV2 has been able to broadcast six out of seven matches they have maintained their status as the Tippeliga channel number one in Norway. In 2007 they introduced five pay-TV channels namely TV2Sport 1 to 5. The channels have been popular and because of their strong focus on football the commitment from the subscribers is high. In Britain a survey showed that 50 per cent of BSkyB‟s subscribers would cancel their subscription if Sky lost the TV rights to football (Solberg, 2002). It is likely that the same phenomenon would be true for TV2. The broadcasting of the Tippeliga could be partly explained by the attraction of a large audience, domestic production and that it fits well with TV2‟s desire to be a part of Norway‟s social fabric (Johnsen et al, 2007). 3.1.3. FA Premier League In 1995 TV2 bought the rights for the English Premiership (later known as the FA Premier League). Until then English top football was broadcasted on NRK. However in 1997 Canal+ bought the rights and served as a monopolist being for many years a popular and preferred broadcaster of English football in Norway. In February 2010 TV2 bought the Premier League rights for the next three seasons (2010/2011 – 2012/2013). The sale was highly debated within Norway because many feared Medge Consulting, which sold the rights, would sell Premier League to several channels making it a real headache for the football fans. However, even after TV2 secured the\n\n8. 8 exclusive rights, the tension was building up because it for a long time was unknown which distributors would get hold of TV2‟s new channels. The rights included matches for television, mobile phones and Internet and since the package included matches in HD TV2 introduced three channels namely TV2 Barclays Premier League HD 1, 2 and 3. Today most of the distributors, including Canal Digital, RiksTV, Viasat, Get and Altibox, offer either one or more of TV2‟s Premier League channels. What TV2 paid is yet unknown but, as Figure 2 displays, the price for the Premier League rights both overseas and domestic (within England) has escalated the last few years. Average viewing hours show that the winter is the best period for television channels (Johnsen et al, 2007). In this period there is played no domestic football in Norway, thus gives TV2 a huge potential in relation to the Premier League which is played intensely as this time. Another factor that gives TV2 an advantage is the flexibility they possess in relation to kick-off time and scheduling. (Johnsen et al, 2007). This is good news because the Premier League is played at different times and days during the week which would cause a problem for a PSBs and NRK in our case. Figure 1.3 shows a possible value chain in Norway. Of course, there are more actors to add, but the figure helps explain where the product goes - from the right holders and to the viewers. But where does the money go? Some might guess on a fair split between right holders, the broadcaster and distributors. A good guess, but reality displays an answer that might surprise. For every 100 NOK the viewer is charged, 70 of them goes to the distributors, 20 goes to the right holders and only 10 goes to TV2 (Claus Bretton-Meyer / Øivind Johannessen). 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Pounds(millions) Year Figure 2 - FA Premier League TV Rights Domestic Overseas Source: Deloitte\n\n9. 9 Figure 3 – Value Chain (Claus Bretton-Meyer, 2010) TV2 used the time before the FA Premier League kicked-off in August 2010 to advertise their new channels. For TV2 advertising served two main purposes (Gratton, 2007); firstly it gave them a chance to inform about the product and its price and terms of sale. Secondly, it was a tool for persuading and TV2 sought a shift in the demand, making sports broadcasting‟s already inelastic demand curve even more inelastic allowing them to charge a relatively high price for their new premium channels. TV2 had maximum luck. They broadcasted the 2010 FIFA World Cup and during the hundreds of hours with matches and live studio TV2 constantly reminded the viewers on what was going to happen the following autumn. Also, during TV2‟s sports news an ad was run creating awareness and a clear position in the consumer‟s mind. Halfway through the season the new channel TV2 Barclays Premier League had 160,000 subscribers, this was rather impressive after just six months service. According to Øivind Johannessen, TV2‟s finance director, the numbers per May 2011 are relatively stable and close to the mid-season numbers. This could be explained by the interest trend for English football. It has a generally high level of interest in the autumn and then a descending trend until the end of the season. One way of pricing is through windowing. In this way, using price discrimination, TV2 are able to meet the different willingness to pay from the various audience groups. In microeconomic terms this is known as the consumer surplus. Figure 4 illustrates windowing. A is the price for the consumers with highest willingness to pay, i.e. the fan and supporter group. At this price XA units are sold. Thus gives a profit equal the area of α. However, if TV2 can set another price, B, they are able to attract new consumers and thereby offer the units XB-XA. This gives an additional income of β, resulting in a total income of α+β. The •FA Premier League •Norwegian FA Right holders •TV2 •NRK •Canal+ Broadcaster •Riks TV •Canal Digital •Viasat Distributors •Fotball fans •You and me Viewers/users\n\n10. 10 problem is that with no difference in quality both groups will buy at B giving a lower income than α+β. The solution is then to offer a premium product (e.g. access to more matches/channels, better quality). This will keep the first group paying price A. Today this is solved by offering a one (TV2 Sport / TV2 Barclays Premier League) or multiple channels (TV2 Sport 1-5 / TV2 Barclays Premier League 1-3). The group with highest willingness to pay buys the latter one. Figure 4 – Windowing (price discrimination) To understand why windowing work you may consider A (window 1) as a live coverage and B (window 2) as a delayed match. The more “windows” you have, the more consumer surplus will be untapped. One characteristic of sports broadcasting is time sensitivity. A fan‟s nightmare must be to catch his neighbour singing “We Are the Champions” early in the afternoon and discover that the delayed match will be of a very low value (Gaustad, 2000). 3.2. Challenges today and tomorrow As a sports broadcaster TV2 face challenges both inside their business, but also from external sources. This section ought to discuss these challenges and gives an even further insight into how TV2 operate as a broadcaster. We will start by discussing the internal matters before moving on to the factors outside the business. Table 2 displays TV2‟s main challenges. Price Units ( Gaustad, 2000)\n\n11. 11 Table 3 - Challenges INTERNAL EXTERNAL Viewers/subscribers Competitors Financial situation Technological development Distributors World economy 3.2.1 Internal challenges Viewers/subscribers First and perhaps most important, the viewers represent a major challenge to TV2. Without its viewers it is impossible to operate as a broadcaster. To attract new viewers is clearly of importance, however there are three reasons why existing customers are more profitable than new ones: 1. The cost of retention of an existing customer is lower than the acquisition cost for a new one 2. Easier to cross- and up-sell goods and services to existing customers 3. Word of mouth – the recruiting will be done by existing customer. May relate this point to the phenomenon of dads introducing sons to football. (Beech & Chadwick, 2004: 400) Research show that the lag effects are present meaning viewers‟ tendency to stay with the channel and watch the next programmes (Beech & Chadwick, 2004: 376). This is good news for any broadcaster and may be explained by commitment and that people in general spend more time in front of the telly. This trend is also recognized and highly appreciated by advertisers since many use exposure as a measure for success. Demand for televised football depends on many factors including quality of the players involved, the league‟s reputation, placement of cameras, commentators and uncertainty of outcome (UO) (Gaustad, 2000). The latter is highly debated and several academic papers challenge Neale (1964)‟s view. Neale used heavyweight boxing as an example and argued that a high level of UO would result in the highest level of profits. Many articles doubt this\n\n12. 12 argument and findings suggest that in four out of five sports UO is of less importance (Hammervold & Solberg, 2008). Forrest et al. (2005) find a link and a correlation between competition and viewing figures; on the other hand, it is unclear whether it is due to sporting or competitive factors. Another point might be that no-one can guarantee UO, neither the right holders nor the broadcasters. Football is based on luck and one team might have a bad day at work, one team may play against the wind, and, since referees still are human beings, they also do mistakes. The answer to UO might be two folded. “No”, in the sense that fans will watch the game even though they might know their team will win – or lose, “yes” because those watching football for entertainment and some “normal” viewers want an exciting game – if not they‟re only a keystroke from a different channel. In addition to UO, broadcasters face another paradox: If you ask two viewers about the quality of same match you are likely to get different answers. One might see his favourite team play badly while the other one sees his team play one of their best games in years. This is a major characteristic of sports thus leading to a focus on giving the overall best impression where placement of cameras, highlights, replays and expert commentators are all important. But these factors only partly explain demand – viewers habits and rituals must also be considered leading us over to consumption patterns. Helland et al. (2011)‟s discussion on changing consumption patterns discuss a very important point; interactive viewing. This is best explained by giving an example: Mikkel is watching his favourite team Arsenal’s game against Fulham on TV2 Barclays Premier League. When the referee blows his whistle for the half time Mikkel opens his laptop. While doing that his phone is beeping. The half-time scores from the other matches are ticking in. On his smart phone he also checks the table and the updated top scorer list. On his laptop he checks his score on an online fantasy football game and picks up his iPad to continue his post in an online discussion about the offside rule. Before returning to the telly and the discussion in the studio he checks out the goals on TV2 Sumo – TV2’s online television service. As we can see, many platforms are available creating an interactive engagement with the viewer. A good example of how TV2 uses social media is the following message on Twitter. Make note of the informal style:\n\n13. 13 “We’ve gotten so many wishes on sending Gary Neville’s testimonial that we’ve bought the game. Kick-off is set at 20.25 CET on TV2 Barclays Premier League 1 & TV2 Sumo. Enjoy!” (Editor in Chief for Sports, Vegard Jansen Hagen). Financial situation When TV2‟s managing director, Alf Hildrum, presented the annual report for 2010 it was with a big smile on his face. The operating income of 335 million NOK was the record- breaking and partly explained by TV2‟s new Premier League channels. However, the income from advertising is still not at the level before the Credit Crunch. But the prospects for 2011 looks good with increasingly interest from both viewers and advertisers. Figure 5 shows turnover, operating income and profit (loss), for the TV2 group of companies, the last five years. (Source: Annual reports TV2 2005-2010). TV2 is famous for using their own staff actively in marketing and branding giving them an emblematic function for the cannel (Solvoll, 2009). This is not only recognized by the viewers, but also the advertisers. Journalists from TV2 are friendly, personal and display a somewhat relaxed style. The same is true throughout the organizational from the cameramen to the front desk personnel. This is implemented in TV2 through the channel‟s values as „playful‟, „informal‟ and „down to earth‟. Many advertisers find this interesting and something opposite of NRK‟s more distanced authority. Helland (2003) argues that TV2‟s 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Turnover 2314 2614 2744 2437 2704 Profit/Loss 53 39 38 197 222 Operating income 28 -9 184 150 335 -500 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 1000sNOK Figure 5 - Turnover versus Profit/Loss and Operating Income\n\n14. 14 commentators‟ style focuses more on the appealing side of sports attracting both viewers and advertisers. As explained, TV2 is highly dependent on their income from advertising. However, new technology has been very important in relation to this. Bjørn Taalessen in TV2 puts it this way: “Technological innovations have not only increased the number of products, but also enabled the integrated media companies to communicate with consumers simultaneously through several communication channels. This, as an example, also involves interactive communication during live programmes” (Helland et al, 2011). To include the companies early in the process and give them chance to influence the way the communication platforms are designed is for me considered as a key factor here. In this way advertisers are able to reach out to their target groups and TV2 will gain through a closer tie with their co-operators. In an email, finance director of TV2 Øivind Johannessen spelled out the following challenges in relation to the financial situation: “Maintain our market share, keep control over costs and keep acquiring attractive sports rights”. The first concern leads us over to the distributors. Distributors We define distribution as “the delivery of products from supplier (TV2) to customer (viewer)” (Beech & Chadwick, 2004: 143). Clearly, without distributors very few, if any, could watch football on the telly. This section discusses the importance of distributors and how TV2 could tackle the challenges arising from the cooperation with these actors. Since the 70s there has been a growth of new distribution technologies including cable and satellite (Solvoll, 2007). Today the television coverage is terrestrial and 92 per cent of Norwegian households access the channel TV2. In addition to this the Internet and development of social media has opened new doors for broadcasters and distributors. But they are not alone. It has also given newspapers, mobile phone operators, IP television companies, energy companies and Internet companies a chance to enter the market (Helland, K & Solberg, H, 2011). I our case TV2 and the telecommunication company Telenor have close ties and share ownership of the channel TV2 Zebra which owns TV2 Barclays Premier League and TV2 Sport. The business integration in the media industry has increased both the competition and transmission capacity – and last but not least the price on television rights (Helland, K & Solberg, 2011). In addition to this, new products have changed the consumptions patterns (Mikkel‟s Arsenal match).\n\n15. 15 In the future it is important for TV2 to keep acquiring exclusive and popular sport rights. If they lose them, they may lose not only their subscribers, but also their distributors. Some may argue that broadcasters nowadays do not need distributors since the channels can go online and provide the service directly to their subscribers. This is true, but at the current stage many broadcasters, TV2 included, are highly dependent on their income from their distributors. 3.2.2 External challenges Competitors Both current and possible new entrants are important challenges for TV2. Sharing the same goals as the rights holders is therefore essential when deals are made. It will also help maintain the relationship between the broadcaster and the seller (Solberg, 2002). In this way TV2 may be preferred instead of competitors in the negotiation phase. Canal+ and NRK have already been discussed. The third big competitor is Viasat. The distributor also own sports TV channels showing competitions such as the UEFA Champions League and the Carling Cup. Under the last World Cup, TV2 and Viasat shared the rights. Viasat‟s coverage of the Champions League on the most popular channel Viasat 4 has relatively high viewing figures, but except for that not many people are willing to pay for their sport premium pay-tv channels. For all broadcasters, TV2 and Viasat included, it is important to realize that there will always be a threat for new entrants. For the existing channels brand building and consumer commitment are important keywords. These two channels are also both commercial channels which means that they will be able to acquire the biggest sports events, if and only if they keep their subscribers (and bring in new ones) as well as being attractive for advertiser. Technological development This matter has already been analyzed and discussed. However it could not be highlighted too often. Technological development has been, is and will be of great importance for TV2. Clearly, the collaborations and the mentioned business integration will be helpful here, but it is TV2‟s own responsibility to follow the market trends and keep developing their services keeping in mind consumers‟ growing emphasis on service quality (Beech & Chadwick, 2004: 458).\n\n16. 16 World economy During recessions many businesses‟ first cuts are in the marketing budgets. TV2‟s fall in incomes from advertising was party explained by the late-2000s financial crisis. The situation also led to cuts in programme budgets and several employees was either laid off or sacked. Recently TV2 has sold technology outside Norway (http://www.tv2.no/omtv2/pressemeldinger/tv-2-satser-internasjonalt-paa-webtvteknologi- 3456319.html, retrieved 27 May 2011). This carries risk, but currency hedging will be a one way around it. It is important to make note of the economy in Norway, which was less hit by the crisis than other European countries. 2011 has been a year with positivism and the following statement from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) illustrates this: “Norway has fully recovered from the global economic crisis. Growth is projected to rise through 2012 on the back of increasing private consumption and investment, despite stagnating oil and gas exports (http://www.oecd.org/document/56/0,3746,en_2649_37443_45270072_1_1_1_37443,00.html , retrieved 27 May 2011). 4. CONCLUSION The managing director of Danish TV2 Sport, Claus Bretton-Meyer, said on 12 May 2011 that change was the single most important in sport broadcasting. However I only partly agree with him. Of course broadcasters must follow the technological development not to be left behind, but without basic marketing theory where the consumer‟s preferences are analyzed and needs of the consumer are met it is not possible to succeed. There is no reason to offer a service no- one wants. Broadcasters must bear this in mind as they face the future. Bretton-Meyer also stated «being liked is one thing, but being preferred is what matters». This statement shows how important it is to recognize the different types of sport fans and give them what they want - at a price they can afford. If TV2 succeed in this the viewers will get back again and again, maybe ending up as a subscriber of all the sports channels. This paper has helped explain how sports broadcasters operate. The development both in technology and consumption patterns has changed this market. It is likely that the future will bring even more of these trends. More and more people are now holders of TVs with 3D, internet access, a tablet and a smart phone. To succeed in this market a broadcaster must offer more than the game. Information and feeds such as tables, statistics and news is only a\n\n17. 17 threesome. It is difficult to predict the future, but a user-oriented and a cohesive organization will be crucial. Future research should focus on the changed consumption patterns and relate them to the demand for sports broadcasting. Much research is outdated and has not considered the most recent consumption trends and the technological developments. Another field worth mentioning is football‟s competitive balance and uncertainty of outcome. Leagues, such as the Spanish La Liga, are good examples of situations where many broadcasters fear the development. Will people still watch the game if there is no or very little competition? New technology and changes in product design may also affect the distribution of market power between the businesses involved. When it comes to sports broadcasting these are all important and should be carefully illustrated by new research. 5.
