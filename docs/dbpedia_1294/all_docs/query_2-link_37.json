        "text": "DAZN seeking to expand distribution of Women’s Champions League final\n\nSports media company to produce ten native language feeds to cover FTA network deals\n\nCoverage has generated 55.9m streams in first season\n\nDAZN, the live sports streaming media company, has confirmed a host of sublicensing deals with traditional linear networks across Europe to air the final of the Uefa Women’s Champions League.\n\nReports emerged in recent days that DAZN was in talks with ITV over broadcasting the showpiece women’s club soccer fixture on the UK commercial network and this agreement has been confirmed along with several other similar deals.\n\nThe free-to-air (FTA) broadcast deals cover TF1 in France, RTVE and TV3 in Spain, RTBF in Belgium, SVT Sweden, plus NRK Norway, Sport5 Israel, as well as RUV Iceland.\n\nDAZN is the global broadcast partner for the Women’s Champions League and the expanded distribution agreements for the final come at the end of a positive first season of the four-year contract. A partnership with YouTube has provided free access to live matches from the European competition and this will continue for the final.\n\nHowever, by agreeing deals with commercial networks for one-off broadcasts of the title decider, DAZN will ensure a broader breach for its coverage.\n\nStay up to date with the latest sports business news and insights.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nWith the fixture on 21st May seeing reigning champions Barcelona take on Lyon for the title in Turin, DAZN is preparing for multinational interest by producing ten separate language commentary feeds for each of those partner broadcasters.\n\nShay Segev, DAZN chief executive, said: “Securing major terrestrial TV agreements for this momentous final underlines our commitment to increasing visibility of the competition, this epic clash of two world-leading clubs, and also importantly, growing women’s football overall. We are proud of our long-term commitment to contributing towards its global growth – increasing visibility of and access to women’s sport is critical to driving bigger audiences and creating fans and, ultimately, to eliminating the disparity in investment and coverage of women’s and men’s sports.”\n\nDAZN’s Women’s Champions League coverage has enjoyed strong engagement in its first season, with the competition drawing 55.9 million streams across the DAZN platform and the dedicated tournament YouTube channel, totalling 11.1 million total viewership hours. These are weighted in favour of the YouTube channel, which accounts for 40.6 million views, while DAZN’s owned and operated platform has brought in 15.3 million streams."
