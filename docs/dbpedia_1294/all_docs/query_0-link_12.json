        "text": "\"The article discusses the background and origins of research on media institutions as afield, and especially assesses the development and status of Norwegian research on broadcasting institutions. It is demonstrated how the field has developed, both quantitatively and qualitatively, through three key phases: the era of broadcasting monopolies; the“new media situation” in the 1980s and 1990s; and the era of convergence; globalization andcommercialization from the late 1990s. A key purpose is to discuss the theoretical perspectives and implicit and explicit assumptions upon which the research is based. Further, thearticle points to shortcomings and gaps in our knowledge of how media institutions evolve and operate. In closing, it is suggested how the field may maintain its relevance in an erawhere the very concept of a “broadcasting institution” is becoming more blurred. Key Words: media institutions, broadcasting, Norway, research overview\"\n\nThe momentous changes in broadcasting over the last decade, have, in Scandinavia as elsewhere, provided a rich field of study for media researchers. The Scandinavian studies are perhaps particularly interesting in this respect, because these countries for so long held on to the “old” ways of organizing broadcasting. Not until the very end of the 1980s was the ban on television and radio advertising permanently lifted in Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, and the public broadcasting corporations still do not take commercials. Nevertheless, significant changes have taken place over the past few years, demonstrating that when the forces of privatization and deregulation are let loose, it does not take long to shake up even the most well-established systems. These four books provide excellent insight into the enormity of the changes taking place in Scandinavian broadcasting. Taken together, these studies also give a good indication of trends in the development of Scandinavian media research. Media research is, after all, a rather young discipline in Scandinavia.The first university degrees in this subject were not established until the late 1980s. Since then, however, media research in Scandinavia has attracted a growing number of researchers and students from different backgrounds. The field is characterized to an increasing degree by multidisciplinarity, and there is also a growing interest in historical aspects of the media. These four studies fall neatly into two categories. Two books, both from Denmark, focus on developments in television. Sepstrup presents a broad historical account of television in Denmark from the 1950s to the present, whereas Soendergaard studies the changes in content and scheduling of Danish public television throughout the first wave of competition in the 1980s. The two remaining studies, one Norwegian and one Swedish, are more concerned with the overall ideological and political framework surrounding changes in broadcasting. Skogerboe studies the transformation of Norwegian media policy throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, demonstrating how the objectives of this policy have shifted from establishing democratic communication structures to providing freedom of choice. Borg also is concerned with the normative implications of the changes in broadcasting, but his book is less empirical study and more a neoliberal critique of public service and social democratic media ideology.\n\nThis study compares the media systems of the West Nordic countries, namely the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and Iceland. All three countries are democratic welfare states with considerable institutional transfer from the larger Nordic countries. It is argued that the West Nordic media systems fit into the “Nordic model” when it comes to the perception of media as cultural institutions as well as the central role of public service media. On the other hand, the micro-size of the media systems in the West Nordic countries makes them vulnerable, and makes editorial independence more difficult compared with their larger Nordic neighbours. In particular, media outlets within these micro-size media systems seem more susceptible to clientelism, and journalists seem more inclined towards self-censorship. This article highlights how interplay between small size and distinct local factors shape the media system in each of the West Nordic countries.\n\nOne aspect that leads to the increase of democracy in Scandinavia is media, particularly the Public Service Broadcasting in relation to the unique Media Welfare State. Having this said, this paper will try to assess and analyze the Public Service Broadcasting in the Nordic countries in regards to the development of Media Welfare State. Thus, the following paper consists of three parts. The first part will talk about the distinctiveness of the Nordic Model, inasmuch as of its particularities. Secondly, the paper will reveal the relation between the Nordic PSB and the Media Welfare State along with the characteristics and differentiation between the Nordic states. Thirdly, the articles will present the effect of the Deregulation and Digitalization over the PSB within the last years\n\nIn the present article, we compare the models that the management in two leading commercial Norwegian media organizations, one with a foothold in the written press, Verdens Gang (VG), and one in television, TV 2, have used in dealing with the disruptive change in news caused by the introduction of rolling news. Both started with an experimental internal phase but later used different models to organize their news production. By establishing a spin-off, separate from the printed newspaper, VG retreated from synergies between online and offline productions, but gained by having two organizations dedicated to the processes and values of each medium. Their online services are financed by advertisements alone. The commercially financed television channel, TV 2, used an acquisition model, but encountered problems with integrating the parts. Today, their strategy involves a proliferation of digital TV channels, financed by a combination of advertisements and payment from viewers. Not only ..."
