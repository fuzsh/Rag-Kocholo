        "text": "HbbTV is a technology that enables professional video/audio content providers to deliver content to consumers for consumption on TV displays over broadcast and broadband networks. It uses elements of existing solutions including ones from W3C, MPEG, DVB, CTA and OIPF. The HbbTV specification and test suite are developed under the umbrella of the HbbTV Association.\n\nHbbTV enables broadcasters and other professional video/audio content providers to offer a wide range of services to consumers targeting TV displays. As well as services related to professional video/audio, HbbTV can also be used for information services that are appropriate to consume on a TV display.\n\nFor example, services like the following:\n\nVOD\n\nCatch-up, replay TV, start-over\n\nProgram Guide\n\nNews, Sport, Weather information\n\nEnhanced TV – quizzes, extra info\n\nInteractive Advertising and E-Commerce\n\nEarly Warning System\n\nE-government, Education, Health\n\nGames\n\nPush VOD\n\nTargeted advertising\n\nThe main elements defined in the HbbTV specification are the following:\n\na set of minimum web technologies that are to be available to the HTML pages in an HbbTV app\n\nextensions for features specific to TVs\n\nhow linear TV channels can link to HbbTV apps using those technologies\n\na minimum baseline set of video, audio and subtitle/caption technologies to be supported in TVs\n\nhow all the various technologies are integrated into an overall system\n\nhow security and privacy are handled in the overall system\n\nMany of these are defined by reference to specifications from other organisations and not by HbbTV itself.\n\nThe HbbTV Test Suite is a set of unit tests for TVs, set-top boxes and software to be included in them. It tests against the requirements defined in the HbbTV specifications and other associated specifications (such as OIPF). It is suitable for suppliers of complete receivers and also suppliers of hardware and software components. More information here.\n\nIf the operators are deploying set-top boxes then please see A7 above. Deploying the ADB specification will allow HbbTV apps to run on TV sets connected to those STBs via HDMI. In hybrid deployments with both conventional broadcast and IPTV, on more recent TVs/STBs, HbbTV apps signalled in the broadcast can access most proprietary streamed content using a JavaScript media player library (if there is one) that builds on web standards such as XMLHttpRequest/Fetch, Media Source Extensions (MSE) and Encrypted Media Extensions (EME).\n\nThe first thing to check is whether there are tests for Feature X in the test suite – there should be, a list is available on the website [link] – and if so, do devices pass those tests? If not, you need to liaise with manufacturers to ensure they pass the full test suite in future. Providing a complete test app to manufacturers using the feature in the way you expect is another good way of helping. Unfortunately, there’s probably little that can be done about devices already in consumers’ homes.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why this could occur:\n\nThe first is related to testing of in-market services, which forms part of a TV manufacturers QA activity before products are launched. If there are no services that use HbbTV, or services don’t use a complex feature of HbbTV then it could be disabled in a device. If this was not the case, then the manufacturer could end up with many market problems when a service does launch, where the service hasn’t been properly verified with the device. Whilst a TV device may pass the HbbTV test suite, alone, this may not be enough of a guarantee that future deployed services or future evolutions of existing services will correctly function. Discussions between service providers and TV manufacturers, and access to market applications prior to their service launch could help to mitigate this issue\n\nThe second is related to software licensing. Some TV manufacturers license HbbTV technology components from third parties and some HbbTV features may be separately licensable. If there is no expectation that HbbTV will be used in a market, then there may be no need to deploy and pay an unnecessary license cost. If there is no expectation that a specific, separately licensable feature would be used in a market, then similarly, the feature could be disabled. Early visibility of service provider plans / intention to use features in a market could help to inform TV manufacturers decisions in this area\n\nThird, even if the information is known about the possible service intention, the TV manufacturer may decide to judge if the service is of sufficient value to the consumers in that market to justify investing in deploying HbbTV, or some HbbTV feature, in that market\n\nFinally, there may be other reasons than described above for a TV manufacturer to not deploy HbbTV or certain features of HbbTV at all or in a particular territory\n\nA result could be that a country doesn’t have services or a platform or trademark regime yet, and without these the TV manufacturer may not provide the needed platform or platform features. Without provision of a forum and a mechanism to break this stalemate, the situation would perpetuate. HbbTV recommends that in this situation service providers or groups of service providers in that territory provide a forum for manufacturers to communicate with the service providers. Activities in this forum could be sharing prototype applications with manufacturers to aid in their verification activities, and also to understand the opportunities and the service launch objectives of the service providers.\n\nHbbTV services work in combination with a number of DRM systems in wide use, and the HbbTV Association provides the DRM Reference Application as an open-source example of how to design applications and content to work on as many devices as possible in the market today. HbbTV Specifications do not presently mandate any specific DRM technology, but they provide information and informative guidelines for integration of such systems. As with other optional features, support of specific DRMs and new or advanced features of such systems may not be universal and should be verified with device manufacturers. Ideally, DRM testing would form part of a platform or trademark regime but if not, the Reference Application has been tested with, and is designed to work on, as many devices in the market as possible.\n\nIn general no. TV sets are generally updated after sale only to fix critical bugs. Updates to add new features, such as a new version of HbbTV, are unusual. Updates to address issues arising from applications that were not live at the time the TV set was placed on the market would also be unusual."
