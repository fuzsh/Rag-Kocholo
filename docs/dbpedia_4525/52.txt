Even though this rock'n'roll documentary is now 25 years old (it was first aired back in 1995) - I, for one, think that it is still a worthwhile view.

Covering 40 years of rock music (1954-1994) from both Britain and America - This 10-part presentation offers the viewer a very well-rounded look at the music scene through dozens of stills, archival footage, and rock celebrity interviews.

With its wide focus of musical genres, such as soul, punk, disco, electronic, new wave, and heavy metal (to name but a few) - "The History Of Rock'n'Roll" is certain to hold the spectator's keen interest from start to finish.
