        "text": "Show and Artist Details Songs Performed Notes Show: Five O'Clock Club\n\nEpisode: Unknown\n\nBroadcaster: Rediffusion (UK)\n\nRecord Date: Unknown\n\nBroadcast Date: 1967 or 1968\n\nRunning Time: Unknown Artist: Idle Race\n\nSong: Skeleton And The Roundabout\n\nArtist: Idle Race\n\nSong: Come With Me\n\nPerformance Type: Unknown\n\nHosted by Muriel Young, this music oriented program was oriented toward children and featured pop acts of the day. All broadcasts were in black and white only. No episodes of the program are known to survive.\n\n\"Along with their radio sessions, The Idle Race appeared on TV, most memorably on Five O'Clock Club. The show was presented by Muriel Young in the Manchester studio and Dave remembers performing The Skeleton And The Roundabout, Come With Me and reckons they probably did most of the other singles. At the time of writing, it was uncertain as to whether any of these shows still exist in the vaults.\"\n\nUnknown (1994 - Face The Music fanzine #17)\n\nShow: Disco 2\n\nEpisode: S01E12\n\nBroadcaster: BBC (UK)\n\nRecord Date: Unknown\n\nBroadcast Date: 28 March 1970\n\nRunning Time: 50 minutes Artist: The Move\n\nSong: Brontosaurus\n\nPerformance Type: Unknown\n\nDisco 2 filmed in color at Century 21 studios in Slough in Berkshire, England and, for the first series, ran 50 minutes an episode. The presenter for the first series was Tommy Vance and the only known guests on this episode were Yes and The Move. As the episode was wiped from the BBC archives, details are taken from TV listings only. The Move promoted their latest single, Brontosaurus and Roy Wood debuted his harlequin make up for the first time ever on this appearance. The entire episode was wiped from the BBC archives and is not known to survive in any format.\n\n\"I can remember the first time I broke out. It was on a TV show and we were doing Brontosaurus. I'd had a few pints that night, I can tell you. Maureen had made me a new coat for the occasion so I painted my face to match. The first the others knew about it was when they saw me. They just looked at each other, then looked at me leaping around, and Jeff stopped playing. I was so embarrassed. But once I'd done it I started to put it in the stage act and we were going well again. Yes, I'd say I'm a shy person, and that leaping around with paint on my face did wonders for my confidence.\"\n\nRoy Wood (December 23, 1971 Rolling Stone) \"Oh, just before [the recording of 10538 Overture] Charlie [Wayne] had left [The Move], and I had written Brontosaurus and we had to have some sort of front man. Everyone was pointing at me, but I didn't think I could do it because I'd always been the songwriter standing beside my amp. It wrote it because it was and easy song and eventually I designed the gear to go with it and I painted my face in triangles. But I didn't think I'd have the courage to go on stage and do it. We did Disco 2 and I got a few drinks down me and went on leaping about like a maniac. It was more surprising to me than the band that I did it, and I felt embarrassed. I persuaded myself to do it a couple more times and once I'd got over it I was okay.\"\n\nRoy Wood (November 27, 1971 - New Musical Express)\n\nShow: Top Of The Pops\n\nBroadcast Date: 9 April 1970\n\nThis was a completely live performance of Brontosaurus by The Move. See the Top Of The Pops page for details on this appearance. Show: Beat-Club\n\nBroadcast Date: 18 April 1970\n\nThis was a completely live performance of Brontosaurus by The Move. See the Beat-Club page for details on this appearance.

Show: 2 Festival Della Musica D'Avanguardia E Nuove Tendenze\n\nEpisode: 2\n\nBroadcaster: RAI (Italy)\n\nRecord Date: 4 June 1972\n\nBroadcast Date: June 1972\n\nRunning Time: 50 minutes Artist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: 10538 Overture\n\nSEE CLIP\n\nONLY ON\n\n. SEE FULL\n\nSHOW ON\n\n.\n\nPerformance Type: Completely Live\n\nThis Italian TV special was all about the four day music festival 2 Festival Della Musica D'Avanguardia E Nuove Tendenze (translated as the Second Festival of Avant-Garde Music and New Trends) in Italy and originally aired on Italian TV in June of 1972. Only a small portion of the band performing 10538 Overture (the middle instrumental parts only) at the festival are featured. Other bands appearing at the festival and featured in the TV special include several Italian bands such as Circus 2000, Stormy Six and Il Balletto di Bronzo as well as British bands Argent and Spencer Davis Group. The performance took place in Rome at the Stadium Tennis Foro Italico in June 1972. The show was presented by well known Italian personality Teo Teocoli.\n\nELO, with the strange concept of featuring strings and French horn in a rock 'n' roll band, certainly fit with the concept of avant-garde music for the festival. At the time, they were a new and unknown band, thus it did not get much more than a passing mention on the program. Still, it offers a rare glimpse into the first live line-up of the band when Roy Wood was still involved and it offers an incredibly rare look into the Italian tour. The exact date in June of the performance is unclear but given the dates of the Italian tour, it was probably on early in June, at the conclusion of the tour.\n\nThe program surfaced in 2014 as part of Rai Storia's historical documentation. The original recording was done at the 4:3 aspect ratio. Unfortunately, this video was cropped for the 16:9 aspect ratio of widescreen TVs. Thus for this rebroadcast documentary, the only available source of the footage, is missing the top and bottom of the image.\n\nShow: 2Gs And The Pop People\n\nEpisode: Unknown\n\nBroadcaster: LWT (UK)\n\nRecord Date: Unknown\n\nBroadcast Date: 8 July 1972\n\nRunning Time: Unknown Artist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: 10538 Overture\n\nArtist: The Move\n\nSong: California Man\n\nSEE CLIP\n\nONLY ON\n\n. SEE CLIP\n\nONLY ON\n\n.\n\nPerformance Type: Live Vocal and Mimed Backing\n\nThese performances are rather interesting because of the timing. The program was broadcast in July 1972, about the exact time that Roy Wood split from ELO and The Move. The exact date of Roy's official exit in July is not known, but it's almost sure that the performance of California Man was Roy was a pre-recorded performance probably done in May or early June. The performance of 10538 Overture was later, leaving Jeff do perform the song without Roy in early July. Other performers include Labi Siffre and Offspring.\n\nFor 10538 Overture, because Roy was no longer with the band, Jeff was forced to mime Roy's vocal parts. The entire performance was mimed with no live musical performance. In this instance, the band was reduced to a seven piece with Bev on drums, Jeff on lead vocal and guitar, Bill Hunt on French horn, Richard Tandy on bass guitar, Mike Edwards on cello and two other unidentified men on cello (possibly Andy Craig and one of the band's road crew miming). There was no violin player, although one of the unidentified cello players might be Wilf Gibson in disguise. Jeff is wearing his eye patch and captains hat that he wore in the music video and the Top Of The Pops appearance. The peformance is only about the first two minutes and 15 seconds of the song with the last 30 seconds or so obscured by superimposed dancers shown over the band. The performance of 10538 Overture here included Jeff Lynne, Bev Bevan, Richard Tandy (bass), Bill Hunt (horn, on loan from Roy Wood's then yet unnamed new group), Hugh Mc Dowell (cello, on loan from Roy Wood's then yet unnamed new group), Mike Edwardes (cello), Wilf Gibson (cello, in disguise with cape, hat and sunglasses, but his standard stage costume!).\n\nThe performance of California Man is bouncy and frenetic with the band this time featured as a five piece, with Jeff on piano, Bev on drums, Roy on saxophone, Bill Hunt on saxophone, and an unidentified person on stand up bass (and no one visible on guitar at all!). They are all seen in vintage 1950s era style, in the spirit of the song's mood. Jeff Lynne is sporting his sunglasses look, an early stage appearance, but it is probably just in the spirit of the song as all other performers are wearing colored glasses except for Bev. They mystery person on stand up bass may not be a musician with the band at all because he's doing a rather poor attempt at miming. This is a rather odd vocal performance, with the band miming to the record; both Jeff and Roy provide live lead vocals, but the vocals from the record can be heard too which provides an odd harmonic sound to the performance. The performance of California Man here included Roy Wood, Jeff Lynne. Bev Bevan, Bill Hunt (saxophone), and Richard Battle (Roy's nephew on double bass).\n\nPortions of the performance of 10538 Overture were featured on the official release DVD Inside The Electric Light Orchestra in 2001 and Total Rock Review in 2005.\n\nShow: Top Of The Pops\n\nBroadcast Date: 27 July 1972\n\nThis was a completely live performance of 10538 Overture.

Despite this program being touted as all live performances and this fact being used as a selling point, these ELO performances were actually all pre-recorded, mimed-to-the-record performances.\n\nVideo of these performances have turned up on bootleg circles from time to time (although currently not on YouTube or any video streaming service) and they are often labeled as \"music videos\" due to the mimed nature. It is quite certain that these were recorded specifically for Don Kirshner's Rock Concert only, although they may have been sold and/or rebroadcast on other music video programs over the subsequent years.\n\nThe exact date of the recording is uncertain, but it is believed have been done in April, 1974 at a New York City studio while the band was touring the American east coast.\n\nShow: The Midnight Special\n\nBroadcast Date: 7 June 1974\n\nThis is a new episode featuring a repeat of an earlier broadcast performance of Showdown and Bluebird Is Dead.

As broadcast on In Concert, the band is introduced by American singer Mac Davis, but it is reasonably certain that he did not actually introduce the band on stage in England, but it was edited together to appear as if he did.\n\nShow: Szene 74\n\nEpisode: S01E01\n\nBroadcaster: WDR (Germany)\n\nRecord Date: 4 October 1974\n\nBroadcast Date: 11 October 1974\n\nRunning Time: 35 minutes Artist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: Daybreaker\n\nArtist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: N/A - Interview\n\nArtist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: Showdown\n\nArtist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: Daytripper\n\nArtist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: Mik's Violin Solo/Orange Blossom Special\n\nArtist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: Ma-Ma-Ma Belle\n\nArtist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: In The Hall Of The Mountain King\n\nArtist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: Great Balls Of Fire\n\nArtist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: Roll Over Beethoven\n\nSEE ROCKPALAST\n\nVERSION ON\n\n.\n\nPerformance Type: Completely Live\n\nThis was a unique, Hamburg studio performance of most of the On The Third Day tour setlist recorded specifically for this the German Szene 74 program and without an audience. The series, appropriately enough, changed names for each consecutive year and ran from 1972 to 1979 only. Following the Daybreaker, the show's opening song, the entire band takes part in a short interview by an unknown interviewer. Included in the interview is sound man, Rick Pannell. The performance was in a Hamburg studio, and it was broadcast from Szene 74's Cologne Studio, leading to some confusion that the performance was in Cologne and not Hamburg.\n\nThe series quickly evolved into Rockpalast, the long running German series. The concert was rebroadcast on unknown dates later in the 1970s under the new name.\n\nThe date of October 11, 1974 is given for the date of the program, but it remains uncertain if this is the performance/recording date or the broadcast date (or they are the same). Given that ELO was touring Hamburg in late September, was in Belgium on October 1, it's probably the case that the October 11 date is the broadcast date and the performance/recording date was in September when the band was in the area.\n\nAnd it was released on DVD in 2010 on a set called Electric Light Orchestra Live: The Early Years (also featuring the 1976 Fusion concert from in New Victoria Theatre in London and previously unreleased footage of the band performing live at Brunel University on 1974. The release on the DVD was the Rockpalast version which moved the interview to the end of the broadcast. It was also released, under the Rockpalast version, as bonus material on the Out Of The Blue - Live At Wembley Blu-ray in early 2015.\n\nThis performance was done in TV studio with no audience. Thus, it's a bit unusual in that the band is not reacting to an audience and there is no noise between tracks other than the band talking amongst themselves or adjusting their instruments for the next song. This program is also the only known video recording or release of Mik Kaminski's violin solo performance.\n\nShow: The Mike Douglas Show\n\nEpisode: S13E62\n\nBroadcaster: Syndicated (USA)\n\nRecord Date: 7 November 1974\n\nBroadcast Date: 7 November 1974\n\nRunning Time: 90 minutes Artist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: Poor Boy (The Greenwood)\n\nArtist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: Can't Get It Out Of My Head\n\nSEE CLIP\n\nONLY ON\n\n.\n\nPerformance Type: Mimed\n\nThis is ELO's third and final appearance on this long-running syndicated show, hosted by American personality Mike Douglas. ELO appeared, promoting the Eldorado album and performed a short, mimed set that included their latest single, Can't Get It Out Of My Head which was the edited single version only.\n\nThis particular episode was guest hosted by comedian Richard Pryor (who also featured with ELO on an episode of The Midnight Special) and featured guests Sally Kellerman, Harry Belafonte, and George C.

It shows the exterior of the \"Forshaw Heath Social Centre Hall\" in Birmingham and fades in as if the band is playing inside the building (although it's unclear if they are actually playing there or not). The band mimes to the single version of the song. This performance, although created specifically for AVRO's Top Pop was subsequently used as the promo video for the band and broadcast on later music video programs.\n\nThis ELO's only known appearance on this long running Dutch music program, but they very likely had music videos broadcast on other episodes.\n\nShow: The Midnight Special\n\nBroadcast Date: 28 March 1975\n\nThis is a new episode featuring a repeat of an earlier broadcast performance of Can't Get It Out Of My Head and Great Balls Of Fire.

Other guests on the show include Albert Hammond, Jim Capaldi and Pilot. There is very little more known about the program, based solely upon a video clip featuring the show's introduction to the guests, then the Electric Light Orchestra performance.\n\nThis performance by the band has the band playing the song over the tape backing, with mainly Jeff's vocals high in the mix. Jeff sings very close to the tape player playback, thus there is a strange echo effect to the audio. Over the piano bridge, the piano on the tape is turned down, allowing for much of Richard's live piano to be heard. The performance is to the standard single version with a slightly earlier fade.\n\nShow: Supersonic\n\nBroadcast Date: 4 December 1975\n\nThis was a live vocal to tape backing performance of Evil Woman.

The filming was produced and directed by Mike Mansfield, famous in the 1970s for his work on the Supersonic TV show and various music related films.\n\nThe concert was filmed by the London Weekend Television (LWT) crew and was initially broadcast on 30 July. The band was denied the use of lasers for the concert, due to not informing the London authorities in time.\n\nThe recording is not ELO's full set and certainly songs were left out, such Fire On High, the On The Third Day suite and the string player's solos which were part of ELO's stage set on this tour of the UK.\n\nThis broadcast was released VHS videotape in the UK in 1990 (Fusion Concert - Live In London - Pickwick PTR 2152), on worldwide DVD in August 2010 (Electric Light Orchestra Live: The Early Years - Eagle Vision EREDV780), and worldwide Blu-ray on March 14, 2015 as bonus material (Out Of The Blue - Live At Wembley - Eagle Rock ERSBD3017). The latter two releases left off Roll Over Beethoven on the USA releases, probably for copyright reasons.\n\nShow: The Midnight Special\n\nBroadcast Date: 17 September 1976\n\nThis is a new episode featuring a repeat of an earlier broadcast performance of Showdown.

He reports that the group appeared in an outside broadcast segment called \"Swaporama\" (where one of the hosts (usually Keith Chegwin) would appear in a location somewhere in the UK, usually a park, and tell all the kids to come down for a swap). ELO were there in person to help him do swaps with the kids. The location may have been Birmingham and they likely mimed to their latest single, Livin' Thing.\n\nShow: The Basil Brush Show\n\nEpisode: Unknown\n\nBroadcaster: BBC (UK)\n\nRecord Date: Unknown\n\nBroadcast Date: 11 December 1976\n\nRunning Time: 25 minutes Artist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: Unknown\n\nThis was a children's program with Basil, the fox puppet interacting with various guests. The original show ran from 1968 to 1980 and was a variety show format, with various jokes, sketches and celebrity guests.\n\nELO's appearance on this show is confirmed, but how and what they did is unclear. It is thought that they did not make an actual appearance, but rather the Livin' Thing video was shown as that was their latest single. Other guests on the episode included Anita Harris, George Sewell and Tony Selby\n\nThe show is not available for review and is believed to have been wiped from the BBC archives.\n\nShow: American Music Awards\n\nEpisode: 4th Annual\n\nBroadcaster: ABC (USA)\n\nRecord Date: January 1977\n\nBroadcast Date: 31 January 1977\n\nRunning Time: 120 minutes Artist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: Livin' Thing\n\nSEE CLIP\n\nONLY ON\n\n.\n\nPerformance Type: Mimed\n\nELO made an appearance at the 4th American Music Awards, held at the Civic Auditorium, Santa Monica, California. Introduced by Helen Reddy, the band mimes to the Livin' Thing single while set up on a colorful, tiered triangular stage.\n\nIt's unclear exactly when the performance was recorded, but it was surely not done live. The night of the broadcast, ELO was performing a show in San Diego. As they were on tour in the west coast of America, it was probably done a few days earlier or even just ealrier in the day.\n\nThe picture sleeve for the Japanese Confusion single in 1979 used an image from this appearance.\n\nShow: The Midnight Special\n\nBroadcast Date: 18 February 1977\n\nThis was a completely live performance of Livin' Thing, Do Ya, Telephone Line, Rockaria! and a repeat of Livin' Thing.

Each episode was approximately one hour long and focused on a specific aspect of popular music (although the focus tended toward rock oriented or inspired music). The last episode, entitled Imagine: New Directions, focused on what the producers thought the future of popular music would be. It featured a short, unique music video of ELO performing Can't Get It Out Of My Head with the implication being that the fusion of rock and classical would be a possible future for popular music. Other artists imagined to be the future include Black Oak Arkansas, Tangerine Dream and Mike Oldfield.\n\nThe performance video is unique to this documentary and it is mimed to the album version of the song. It shows the band, in a darkened room, performing the song, and is intercut with various film footage of waves crashing on a beach, a San Fransisco trolley, and boys rowing a canoe. There is no interview segment. The video was clearly produced in 1975 at the same time that the Evil Woman music video was produced as the clothes and style matches. It's unclear if the video was produced specifically for the All You Need Is Love: The Story Of Popular Music documentary or was something recorded at the same time as Evil Woman that was unused until the documentary.\n\nAlthough this documentary was produced for worldwide distribution, it's first known broadcast was on LWT in the UK. It certainly repeated in the international market.\n\nThe documentary was released on a five disc DVD set in 2008. Unfortunately, the DVD producers decided to release it in widescreen format, thus cutting off the top and bottom of the original 4x3 aspect ratio footage. No known version of the original broadcast in the original aspect ratio is known to be available.\n\nShow: Top Of The Pops\n\nBroadcast Date: 9 June 1977\n\nThis was a music video broadcast of Telephone Line.

ELO was experiencing a peak of popularity at the time and was just about to come to Australia for a series of shows. Countdown taped the interview with Bev in Los Angeles just a few weeks prior to the airing.\n\nFor the interview, Bev talks about the song Rockaria!

It was broadcast daily from a satellite studio in Ginza from Monday to Friday evenings, while every Thursday was \"POPTEEN POPS,\" a day when musicians made guest appearances. The program features various hosts giving a pop music countdown and talking to various musical guests as well as enthusiastic audience members.\n\nIn this particular episode, guests include several Japanese pop artists, as well as clips form Kiss, ABBA, Wings and more. During the program, Richard Tandy and then Melvyn Gale (who was late) are interviewed by (possibly!) Miki Mizuno in a hotel room about their recent appearances in Japan and future plans. A short clip of the Mr. Blue Sky music video is also shown. Jeff Lynne does not make a personal appearance.\n\nShow: The Midnight Special\n\nBroadcast Date: 24 March 1978\n\nThis is a new episode featuring a repeat of an earlier broadcast performance of a currently unidentified song.

Show: Rock 'n Roll Sports Classic\n\nEpisode: 1 only\n\nBroadcaster: ABC (USA)\n\nRecord Date: Unknown\n\nBroadcast Date: 3 May 1978\n\nRunning Time: 120 minutes Artist: Richard Tandy\n\nSong: N/A - Sports events\n\nSEE IT ON\n\n.\n\nPerformance Type: N/A\n\nJeff Lynne does not actually feature in this show, but it is such a unique appearance by ELO members during the peak of ELO's popularity that it is noteworthy to be included here.\n\nThis is a rather unusual TV program that needs a bit of background to understand why it was made. Beginning in the mid 1970s, ABC in the US ran an ongoing series of specials, notably the Battle Of The Network Stars, which featured popular TV stars from various networks in a series of physical competitions. The stars, aligned with their respective networks, would compete in games such as relay races, tug-of-war and other games with the winning team players winning bragging rights (and reportedly money). Although it was mostly just a fun romp of watching TV actors outside of their TV characters and being relatively normal people. Each special was sportcast with gravitas by popular sports broadcaster Howard Cosell.\n\nSo it was that in 1978, an offshoot of this, Rock 'n Roll Sports Classic, was created to feature popular musicians in various sporting competitions pitting the \"East\" against the \"West.\" Richard Tandy and Hugh McDowell from ELO were part of the competition (competing for the East), along with such musical stars as The Jacksons, Rod Stewart, Commodores, Sha Na Na, Leif Garrett, The Runaways, Anne Murray and more. The event took place at the campus fo University of California, Irvine, with actors Alex Karras, Ed McMahon, Kristy MacNichol, and Michelle Phillips in the sports broadcasting. Captains Phyllis Diller and Sandy Duncan are team captains and Susan Anton and Barbi Benton are assistant team captains.\n\nThe overall winner appears to be the West (the end of the available clip is cut off), thus the ELO team lost; it's unclear what the winnings were other than a trophy. The competitions that Richard and Hugh participated in are as follows:\n\nELO Star Competition Outcome Hugh McDowell 100 yard dash third of eight Hugh McDowell 50 yard freestyle swim fourth of eight Hugh McDowell assists Helen Schneider at start of bicycle race N/A Richard Tandy basketball loss (team competition) Hugh McDowell relay race win (team competition) Richard Tandy soccer kick-off loss (versus Rod Stewart) Richard Tandy long jump win (team competition) Richard Tandy & Hugh McDowell tug-of-war unknown (but probably loss)\n\nShow: Top Of The Pops\n\nBroadcast Date: 6 July 1978\n\nThis was a music video broadcast of Wild West Hero.

It was a charity concert to benefit the Invalid Children's Aid Association in the UK and was performed in front of the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester. It includes an introduction by actor Tony Curtis as well as the spaceship opening and closing footage. Directed by Mike Mansfield, who also directed ELO's Fusion concert two years prior, the concert is believed to have been syndicated all over the world as no \"original\" broadcaster or broadcast date is able to be identified. Surely this program was sold to different markets around the world by ELO's management.\n\nAs directed by Mansfield, several wild (and now dated) special effects are added, which sometimes makes it difficult to see the actual concert. The studio recordings were also heavily mixed into the mono TV track, which further made it difficult to hear the actual performance that night. It was this mixing in of the audio that created some controversy for the band. At the time, the band was involved in a lawsuit from Brass Ring Production, the promoter for the August 1978 concerts at the Pontiac Silverdome in which the promoter was seeking damages because the band used backing tapes for their show and they were accused of only miming on stage. Although the band did indeed use some backing tapes, this was only used for a few songs and it was only for parts that could not easily be created live (e.g. the intros to Fire On High and Can't Get It Out Of My Head) or as a guide at the start of the show only. The promoter had some severe cost overruns for this concert and was seeking to recoup some funds by withholding payment to ELO with the claim that they didn't really deliver a live show. This accusation may be false, but the argument against miming was poorly served by the Wembley TV broadcast that was being shown around the world at the time where the band actually appeared to be miming to the studio recording. What was heard on the TV broadcast was not what was actually heard that night. It was in 2006 that a remaster of the original audio was released that replaced the poorly chosen Mike Mansfield mono TV track with a remastered 5.1 audio track of the actual performance.\n\nThis show was initially broadcast on BBC2 on July 10, 1978 at 22:40. Known rebroadcasts are on BBC2 on December 30, 1978 and on on BBC1 on April 30, 1979. It may have been broadcast on ATV in 1978 in the UK as well, but that remains unconfirmed.\n\nThis TV show, because it was syndicated and owned by Jet Records rather than any TV studio, it was able to be released commercially several times over the years. It's first known release were in 1980 on VHS and BetaMax videotape in both the UK and US (and probably other territories) and it was released again on laserdisc format in 1981 in the US and Japan. There were several subsequent reissues on various video formats and even an audio CD release throughout the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s all of them using the inferior mono TV mix. In 2006, the original concert audio was remastered and remixed to a nice stereo and 5.1 audio and the show was released on DVD and Blu-ray with the new audio.\n\nThe actual name of the show is not entirely clear. It's probably best known as simply Live At Wembley, but as there is no proper title card or anything to identify a title on the broadcast, it probably doesn't have a name proper. The commercial releases over the years have varied between ELO - Live In Concert, Electric Light Orchestra - Live At Wembley, Live At Wembley - The Out Of The Blue Tour and Out Of The Blue Tour - Live At Wembley.\n\nOn the commercial releases, footage of Don, David and Sharon Arden greeting the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester is seen at the start, then following the concert, the the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester meet ELO, asking them questions and the attending Tony Curtis who provides them with the charity donation from the concert. It is unclear if this non-concert footage was part of any broadcast.\n\nShow: Top Of The Pops\n\nBroadcast Date: 29 July 1978\n\nThis was a music video broadcast of Wild West Hero.

Although this fact is unconfirmed, the order of the tracks as broadcast match perfectly to what is in the video EP. This is somewhat ironic for Don Kirshner's Rock Concert as it was a program that touted itself for live performances, even if many were mimed.\n\nThis is also the first known use of a music video in a major television program.

Captain & Tennille was the self-titled musical variety show hosted by the duo, Captain & Tennille. There have been some reports of ELO appearing on the show, but no record of the actual appearance of the show is confirmed. Most episodes have been released on DVD, but none feature ELO at all. There is a report that the only participation may not be by the band at all, but rather Bev Bevan doing voice-over style TV promo ads, or commercials, for the show in question, rather than any actual performance.\n\nShow: Twiggy's Jukebox\n\nEpisode: Unknown\n\nBroadcaster: Syndicated (USA)\n\nRecord Date: 4 December 1975\n\nBroadcast Date: 1978\n\nRunning Time: Unknown Artist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: Evil Woman\n\nPerformance Type: Live Vocal and Mimed Backing\n\nTwiggy's Jukebox was a syndicated TV show in North America that was hosted by model and actress Twiggy. The show featured her introducing various musical guests, with footage mostly taken from the UK's 1975/1976 Supersonic program. One of the episodes repeated ELO's Supersonic performance of Evil Woman. This performaance is notable in part because the smoke machines began overwhelming cellists Melvyn Gale and Hugh McDowell and had Jeff Lynne momentarily breaking into laughter on camera because of it.\n\nShow: People\n\nEpisode: Unknown\n\nBroadcaster: Syndicated (USA)\n\nRecord Date: 1978\n\nBroadcast Date: 1978\n\nRunning Time: Unknown Artist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: Unknown\n\nPerformance Type: Unknown\n\nPeople was a TV news magazine produced in 1978 and possibly into 1979 that was a TV counterpart to the print magazine of the same name. Reports are that ELO had a segment on the show, but details are unclear on what the appearance was about.

Dance troupe Legs & Co were present to dance many of the numbers.\n\nThe show is only partially available at present with only a short clip of the closing credits is available. In the clip, the winners are restated and a brief clip of the acceptance is shown only, while Leg & Co dance to an orchestral rendition of the Bee Gees' Night Fever. It is not believed that Jeff did any sort of performance and was simply present, without the rest of the band, to accept the award.\n\nThis annual award ceremony started some time in the 1970s with the earliest known records being 1976 and it stopped altogether by the mid-1980s.\n\nShow: Top Of The Pops\n\nBroadcast Date: 24 May 1979\n\nThis was a music video broadcast of Shine A Little Love.

It profiles media entrepreneur, Stefan Sargent, who is trying to market video and software for home use through video players in the early 1980s. In the process, there is extensive footage of Mike Mansfield editing footage of the Electric Light Orchestra Confusion video. The closing credits of the segment features a partial play of the completed Confusion music video.\n\nShow: Making Xanadu\n\nEpisode: 1 only\n\nBroadcaster: Syndicated (USA)\n\nRecord Date: Unknown\n\nBroadcast Date: August 1980\n\nRunning Time: 30 minutes Artist: Olivia Newton-John & Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: N/A - Interviews and Song Excerpts\n\nSEE IT ON\n\n.\n\nPerformance Type: Media Play + Interview\n\nThis special mainly focused on the film's choreography and how the film was produced, including several dance sequences, behind the scenes bits, and interviews with Olivia, Robert Greenwald, Larry Gordon, Gene Kelly and Michael Beck. It uses snippets of most songs from the film, including ELO's All Over The World, I'm Alive, Don't Walk Away and Xanadu. The use of All Over The World is a short section of an early cut of Gene Kelly dancing in a fancy clothing store to an early, instrumental version of All Over The World. About two-thirds of the way through the special there are a couple of interview segments about the music, filmed on the set with Olivia Newton-John, John Farrar and Jeff Lynne. In this section, Jeff talks only briefly about the challenges of creating the music for the film. He also acts a clown in some spots (he needs more ice in his drink or calling out \"Hi, Mom!\" to the camera), making Olivia laugh uncontrollably at his antics. The special ends with the cast and crew at the wrap party, dancing to Michael Jackson's Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough. The crowd at the wrap party includes several celebrities, but there is no sight of Jeff Lynne or anyone from ELO. The Making Xanadu special was produced by Olivia's then-boyfriend and manager, Lee Kramer.\n\nShow: Top Of The Pops\n\nBroadcast Date: 7 August 1980\n\nThis was film clips from the Xanadu film.

It was a syndicated series, created by Donny Osmond and premiered on November 30, 1980 and running into 1981. The show had no host and was simply music and interviews supplied by the musical stars on the show. As the series was syndicated, it aired on variable stations and variable nights so pinpointing an exact broadcast date is impossible. Some sources indicate that there were only 9 episodes produces, but others imply that there were many more. The Electric Light Orchestra episode aired not only all the Discovery videos, but also featured an dance troupe on roller skated called \"Rock 'n' Rollers\". Some records show that this episode also aired as late as mid-July in 1981, with TV listings confirming a broadcast on Saturday, July 18, 1981 in Lawrence, Kansas and another on Friday, July 17, 1981 in Santa Cruz, California.\n\nThe order of the videos as broadcast was rearranged compared to the order from the album (and later commercial releases). The version of the Shine A Little Love video used was not the standard Discovery video version with the band in the smoky studio set, but rather the one filmed in Musicland Studios instead. The closing credits for the show scrolled up the screen during Shine A Little Love.\n\nShow: ATV Today\n\nEpisode: Unknown\n\nBroadcaster: ATV (UK)\n\nRecord Date: Unknown\n\nBroadcast Date: 12 August 1981\n\nRunning Time: 30 minutes Artist: Jeff Lynne\n\nSong: N/A - Interview\n\nPerformance Type: Interview\n\nIn this short news segment, Keith Wootton visits the band at their secret rehearsals (Jasper Carrott's folk club in Solihull called The Boggery), where they are practising prior to their forthcoming tour of the USA.

It was produced in Canada, and syndicated worldwide. The program was ostensibly to promote Bev's new The ELO Story book, and several images are lifted directly from the book.\n\nJeff is not interviews and makes appearances through music videos. As the interview is with Bev, it tells mostly his story and thoughts. ELO's Don't Bring Me Down is played over the intro and closing credits. Following the intro:\n\nBev on about modern music Bev on early days in music and The Move Sweet Talkin' Woman music video Bev on the formation of ELO Bev's relationship with Jeff Bev on the disco of Discovery Shine A Little Love music video (Musicland version) Bev on keeping spirits up Bev on what life is all about Bev on his marriage Hold On Tight music video Bev on the new wave of music Bev on his early influences Bev's free time Bev on his idols Don't Bring Me Down music video Bev on ELO's popularity\n\nShow: Top Of The Pops\n\nBroadcast Date: 21 January 1982\n\nThis was a music video broadcast of Ticket To The Moon.

Between mimed performances of the two songs, Kelly was interviewed about his new album and his involvement with ELO. Kelly states that the album was made with the blessing of ELO, with band members (but not Jeff) on the album, and that he would continue on with ELO despite the solo effort. However, the album and Kelly's lawsuit against ELO was causing tension with the band and their management and Kelly was already being shut out of the recording sessions. He would only go on to make the music videos for the Secret Messages album released later that year and then he was dismissed from the band.\n\nShow: Solid Gold\n\nEpisode: S03E25\n\nBroadcaster: Syndicated (USA/Canada)\n\nRecord Date: Unknown\n\nBroadcast Date: 12 March 1983\n\nRunning Time: 60 minutes Artist: Kelly Groucutt\n\nSong: Am I A Dreamer\n\nPerformance Type: Mimed + Interview\n\nThis program was a syndicated musical variety show, featuring current artists and their current hits.

Records show that the bands The Flirts and X were also on this episode.\n\nShow: D-TV\n\nEpisode: Unknown\n\nBroadcaster: Disney Channel (USA)\n\nRecord Date: 1984\n\nBroadcast Date: 1984\n\nRunning Time: 1 minute, 30 seconds Artist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: Evil Woman\n\nPerformance Type: Media Play\n\nThe Disney Channel featured a series of music videos inspired by MTV music videos, where they took popular songs from the past and included clips of old Disney cartoons to the music. The name, D-TV, is a variation of the popular MTV channel name. These short music videos were shown as filler on the show. They were first known to have been created and broadcast in 1984, but they repeated multiple times over the next few years from time to time.\n\nELO's Evil Woman was featured, playing only from the third chorus to the end of the song (including the last verse) while various footage of female antagonists (the \"evil women\") from Disney cartoons are shown.\n\nShow: Unknown\n\nEpisode: 1 only\n\nBroadcaster: MTV (USA)\n\nRecord Date: 1986\n\nBroadcast Date: 1986\n\nRunning Time: 1 minute Artist: Jeff Lynne\n\nSong: N/A - Interview\n\nPerformance Type: Interview\n\nA series of interview segments with Jeff Lynne were featured on MTV in 1986 around the time of the USA Balance Of Power. There were two known thirty second segments (there may have been more) that were repeated and scattered about during the day, used as bits of filler between music videos or during short music news segments. Each segment featured Jeff Lynne, sitting down, with multi-colored studio lights behind him while he talked about the challenges of recording ELO's newest album. It is confirmed that these interview bits were used during the MTV Countdown segment, when the Calling America music video was charting on the MTV charts.\n\nThe actual source of the material is unclear. It may have been something created by CBS specifically for promotion and distribution to TV music outlets, thus it may have been part of an electronic press kit. As such, segments were likely used on many other channels, although at this time, MTV in America is the only confirmed broadcast.\n\nShow: Unknown\n\nEpisode: 1 only\n\nBroadcaster: Sky (UK)\n\nRecord Date: 1986\n\nBroadcast Date: 1986\n\nRunning Time: Unknown Artist: Jeff Lynne and Bev Bevan\n\nSong: N/A - Interview\n\nArtist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: Calling America\n\nPerformance Type: Interview + Promo Video\n\nThe exact source of this interview is uncertain as it's known from a clip only. It was an interview with Jeff and Bev by an unidentified interviewer in a TV studio with a showing of the Calling America music video also broadcast. It was broadcast on Sky TV, which was a satellite service available across Europe at the time. The program is thought to be not a series at all, but a set of continuing music video, news and interviews broadcast continuously, much as MTV was doing at the time.\n\nShow: Heart Beat '86\n\nEpisode: 1 only\n\nBroadcaster: BBC (UK)\n\nRecord Date: 15 March 1986\n\nBroadcast Date: 2 August 1986\n\nRunning Time: Unknown Artist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: Telephone Line\n\nArtist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: Do Ya\n\nArtist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: Rockaria!\n\nArtist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: Hold On Tight\n\nArtist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: Don't Bring Me Down\n\nArtist: All-Star Band\n\nSong: Johnny B. Goode\n\nSEE IT ON\n\n.\n\nPerformance Type: Completely Live\n\nThis was a charity concert at the National Exhibition Centre near Birmingham, England, coordinated by Bev Bevan to benefit Birmingham Children's Hospital. Also on the bill was The Steve Gibbons Band, The Fortunes, Roy Wood, UB40 and Ruby Turner, Applejacks, Robert Plant and Big Town Playboys, The Rockin' Berries and finally The Moody Blues, but not all artists or songs were broadcast. This was ELO's first live performance since March, 1982, four years earlier, and it was the premiere of Martin Smith on bass in the band.\n\nThe band performed a shortened live set. Several songs were performed that night, but did not make it into the TV broadcast; songs included are Twilight, Evil Woman, Livin' Thing, Turn To Stone, Rock 'n' Roll Is King, Calling America, Mr. Blue Sky, Roll Over Beethoven, a pop medley of Sweet Talkin' Woman and Confusion and finally Ma-Ma-Ma Belle which was actually the start of a rock medley with Do Ya and Rockaria!. The latter medley was only partially broadcast, but edited so that viewers were not aware.\n\nClosing the show was an all-star jam of the rock 'n' roll songs Lucille and Johnny B. Goode in which ELO participated. However, only Johnny B. Good was actually broadcast on the original BBC showing. Joining in the all-star jam were Noddy Holder, Roy Wood, Justin Hayward, Ace Kefford, Denny Laine, Robert Plant and more. Joining them for Johnny B. Goode only was Jeff's new friend, George Harrison.\n\nAlthough the show was performed in March of 1986, for unknown reasons the show wasn't broadcast until August 2nd. It apparently was shown on MTV in the USA on November 12th.\n\nThe All-Star Band performance of Lucille was not part of the original BBC broadcast, however video exists of the performances. The origin of this performance is taken from an unidentified MTV broadcast, possibly the one on the US on November 12th, which would mean the concert had a different edit. What edits, if any, are undetermined.\n\nShow: Wogan\n\nEpisode: S06E48\n\nBroadcaster: BBC (UK)\n\nRecord Date: 25 April 1986\n\nBroadcast Date: 25 April 1986\n\nRunning Time: 35 minutes Artist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: So Serious\n\nSEE IT ON\n\n.

However, for this particular episode for ELO's appearance, Terry Wogan was not available Kenneth Williams hosted instead.\n\nThe appearance by ELO was a simple mimed performance. Curiously, Mik Kaminski appeared and mimed violin while Louis Clark and Dave Morgan mimed cello, imitating the familiar set up for the band-- this, despite the song not featuring any strings at all. Jeff and ELO have no interaction at all with Kenneth Williams during the appearance.\n\nOther guests on the program include Nicholas Parsons, Bertice Reading, Fay Masterson and Denise Coffey.\n\nShow: MTV On Location: Montreux Rock Festival\n\nEpisode: 1 only\n\nBroadcaster: MTV (USA)\n\nRecord Date: Between 7 and 10 May 1986\n\nBroadcast Date: 17 or 18 May 1986\n\nRunning Time: 21 hours Artist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: N/A - Interview\n\nArtist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: Calling America\n\nArtist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: So Serious\n\nSEE CLIP\n\nONLY ON\n\n. SEE CLIP\n\nONLY ON\n\n.\n\nPerformance Type: Mimed\n\nArticle from May 10, 1986 issue of Billboard\n\nThis was an appearance at the Golden Rose in Montreux, Switzerland as part of their annual musical festival. ELO performs two songs, but they are obviously staged as they are mimed performances only (while most artists at the event are actually live). As part of the MTV broadcast, Jeff Lynne, Bev Bevan and Richard Tandy are featured extensively in various scenes as they are strolling along the banks of Lake Geneva. A camera follows them about at various times, showing different scenes, including playing around with an umbrella, making comments about the rain, a \"balance of payments\" joke, a Swiss army knife, writing postcards to Margaret Thatcher about wanting mountains in England and much more. In addition, MTV DJ Nina Blackwood interviewed them, asking about touring. Their behavior is quite erratic during these segments, with some fans accusing them of perhaps being a little drunk during the interview.\n\nThe actual name of the event has been confusing over the years. The event in which ELO took part between May 7 to 10 was called the \"International Music & Media Conference\" (the first annual, apparently) and took place to coincide with the annual Rose dOr (Golden Rose) awards held in Montreux, Switzerland. The end of the event culminated in the The Montreux Golden Rose IM&MC Gala. In addition, Montreux features an annual event called the \"Montreux Jazz Festival\" and 1986 was the 20th year of the event. This event, although originally a jazz oriented event, eventually branched out into rock as well. In truth, the Montreux Jazz Festival for 1986 actually occurred on July 3 to 19, therefore ELO's appearance was clearly not part of the jazz festival. When the program aired on MTV, it aired footage from the International Music & Media Conference as well as the Golden Rose celebration, but the program for this was entitled: MTV On Location: Montreux Rock Festival. Therefore, this event is often incorrectly referred to as the \"Montreux Rock Festival\" (of which there is no such thing!), \"Golden Rose\" and \"Golden Rose of Montreux\".\n\nThe purpose of the \"International Music & Media Conference\" was to bring together high profile people in the music related media industry (TV, radio, home media, etc) for the purposes of exchanging ideas and looking forward to the future of the music industry. Many artists were invited, some performing live, some miming (such as ELO) and some presenting their latests music videos. Further, music media outlets, with MTV in particular, were invited to take part it was from this that footage was collected and edited for the May 17 and 18 broadcast. It remains uncertain which dates of the two day broadcast that the ELO appearance took place.\n\nShow: Disneyland's Summer Vacation Party\n\nEpisode: 1 only\n\nBroadcaster: NBC (USA)\n\nRecord Date: 23 May 1986\n\nBroadcast Date: 23 May 1986\n\nRunning Time: 120 minutes Artist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: So Serious\n\nArtist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: Calling America\n\nSEE CLIP\n\nONLY ON\n\n.\n\nPerformance Type: Mimed\n\nThis was a rather unusual special which was a variety show type of program, featuring popular musical and comedy personalites at Disneyland in Anaheim, California. Airing at the start of the summer season and aimed at a young audience, the show was hosted by popular young actors from current American TV shows (Mindy Cohn, Kim Fields, Scott Valentine and Malcolm-Jamal Warner).\n\nELO's appearance was simply two mimed stage performances of their current singles. Once again, Mik Kaminski is on stage miming violin while Dave Morgan and Louis Clark and miming cello for So Serious, despite the song not featuring the instruments at all. For Calling America, they mime the more appropriate keyboard or guitar. Only the last verse to the end of So Serious is seen because the hosts are showing and talking about a 1970s retrospective over the start of the song (which can partially be heard in the background). Following Calling America, Jeff gives a quick introduction to Jerry Sienfeld.\n\nOther guests on the show include Adam Ant, Chubby Checker, Oingo Boingo, Kenny Loggins, Jerry Seinfeld, Jay Leno and Brenda Lee.\n\nShow: American Bandstand\n\nEpisode: S29E44\n\nBroadcaster: ABC (USA)\n\nRecord Date: Unknown\n\nBroadcast Date: 28 June 1986\n\nRunning Time: 30 minutes Artist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: Calling America\n\nArtist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: So Serious\n\nSEE CLIP\n\nONLY ON\n\n.\n\nPerformance Type: Mimed\n\nThis is ELO's last appearance on this popular and very long running American music program (at the time on its 29th season). It's also probably the most interesting ELO appearance.\n\nThe band once again mimes their latest singles and once again Mik Kaminski mimes violin and Louis Clark and Dave Morgan mime cello on So Serious. What makes this appearance particularly interesting as it features a nice introduction by Dick Clark, then between the songs, Dick gives a quick interview with Jeff. Jeff seems a big uncomfortable with the interview, cracking jokes and rarely giving any serious answer other than the stock, canned answers that he often gave at the time.\n\nPatti Austin was another artist featured on this episode.\n\nShow: Solid Gold\n\nEpisode: S06E??\n\nBroadcaster: Syndicated (USA)\n\nRecord Date: Unknown\n\nBroadcast Date: 1986\n\nRunning Time: 60 minutes Artist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: So Serious\n\nPerformance Type: Mimed\n\nThis is the syndicated pop music show. This particular episode was hosted by Dionne Warwick.\n\nDetails on this appearance are difficult to pin down. There exists a clip that briefly shows Dionne Warwick introducing the band and she was a well known host of Solid Gold at the time. However, an extensive search of Solid Gold episode guides does not list this appearance at all. It is believed that the episode guides are flawed. They also list an early July episode of Solid Gold with ELO performing Calling America, but this is surely in error as the album was no longer being heavily promoted by then (four months after the release) and the song was a mild success at best.\n\nShow: Radio 1990\n\nEpisode: Unknown\n\nBroadcaster: USA Network (USA)\n\nRecord Date: Unknown\n\nBroadcast Date: 1986\n\nRunning Time: 30 minutes Artist: Jeff Lynne\n\nSong: Interview\n\nPerformance Type: Interview\n\nThis program was a 30 minute music video program, including short interviews and music segments between the music videos. The program was hosted by Lisa Robinson and Kathryn Kinley.\n\nIt is not entirely clear if Jeff was actually interviewed for this show. It may be the hosts simply talking about ELO's new album only. Whatever it is, afterwards, the Calling America music video is shown.\n\nShow: ITN News\n\nEpisode: Unknown\n\nBroadcaster: ITV (UK)\n\nRecord Date: 26 October 1986\n\nBroadcast Date: 26 October 1986\n\nRunning Time: Unknown Artist: George Harrison and Jeff Lynne\n\nSong: N/A\n\nPerformance Type: N/A\n\nThe news program ITN News provided various short news stories for UK audiences on the ITV network. In this segment, reporter Paul Davies reported on the 1986 Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide, covering the racers and action that day. George Harrison and Jeff are briefly shown in the pit area taking photographs and enjoying themselves, although Davies only points out George and makes no mention of Jeff.\n\nShow: The Prince's Trust: Rock Gala\n\nEpisode: #2\n\nBroadcaster: ITV (UK)\n\nRecord Date: 5 and/or 6 June 1987\n\nBroadcast Date: 20 June 1987\n\nRunning Time: Unknown Artist: George Harrison\n\nSong: While My Guitar Gently Weeps\n\nArtist: George Harrison\n\nSong: Here Comes The Sun\n\nArtist: Ringo Starr\n\nSong: With A Little Help From My Friends\n\nSEE IT ON\n\n.\n\nPerformance Type: Completely Live\n\nAlthough the Prince's Trust, a charity organization started by Prince Charles, Prince of Wales has been going since 1976, in 1986 a rock gala event was added to raise funds. The second such event was in June of 1987, when Jeff was in George Harrison's Friar Park home studio recording tracks for the Cloud Nine album. George and Ringo were invited to perform at the event and Jeff was brought along to the event. Although Jeff had no headline performance, he was performing guitar and backing vocals center stage with George Harrison during his performances and shared the microphone with George, Elton John and Eric Clapton during the all-star jam at the end of the concert.\n\nThe concert was broadcast several weeks later, combining performances from both nights of the concert, in ITV. The concert was also released on VHS, laserdisc, LP and CD later in 1987, although this was edited from the TV broadcast. The edits that were done between the TV broadcast and the commercial releases are uncertain as the TV broadcast is not currently available for review, although it is believed that the two George Harrison songs and Ringo's With A Little Help From My Friends (which is the all-star jam) are unaltered between the two. The YouTube link provided here is of the VHS release, not the TV broadcast.\n\nThe concert was also broadcast in the USA on 13 October 1987 on an unidentified TV station (possibly MTV) under the title The Second Annual Prince's Trust All-Star Rock Concert. Any further edits for the USA broadcast are uncertain.\n\nThe TV broadcast was subsequently released in the following years on VHS videotape, LP, CD and laserdisc. It has never been issued on DVD.\n\nShow: Top Of The Pops\n\nBroadcast Date: 29 October 1987\n\nThis was a music video broadcast of Got My Mind Set On You. See the Top Of The Pops page for details on this appearance. Show: Disney's DTV Monster Hits\n\nEpisode: 1 only\n\nBroadcaster: NBC (USA)\n\nRecord Date: 1984\n\nBroadcast Date: October 1987\n\nRunning Time: Unknown Artist: Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSong: Evil Woman\n\nPerformance Type: Media Play\n\nThis was a Halloween special featuring a compilation of the Disney Channel's D-TV music videos that had a Halloween type of theme. As the Evil Woman video features several frightening women in the video, it's a perfect fit for the theme. The show was narrated by actor Jeffrey Jones.\n\nShow: Top Of The Pops\n\nBroadcast Date: 5 November 1987\n\nThis was a music video broadcast of Got My Mind Set On You. See the Top Of The Pops page for details on this appearance. Show: Top Of The Pops\n\nBroadcast Date: 26 November 1987\n\nThis was a music video broadcast of Got My Mind Set On You.

At this ceremony, The Beatles were inducted and Jeff Lynne was invited to attend through his new friendship with George Harrison. Although Jeff had no part in the induction, he did come on stage in the closing jam session, performing guitar on the Rolling Stones' (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction. Jeff would share the stage with Mick Jagger, Bruce Springsteen, John Fogerty, Jeff Beck, Bob Dylan, Ben E. King, Little Richard, Mary Wilson, Mike Love, Ringo Starr, George Harrison and more, only contributing a small part to the song himself. The entire ceremony was filmed, but never broadcast in its entirety as later ceremonies mostly would be. It was only shown in various news footage around the US.\n\nStarting in 1987, MTV began airing a weekly TV news program called The Week In Rock in which the latest in the world of pop music was reported. Each episode would run multiple times over the course of a week. It was on this program that the 1988 induction ceremony was reported, and the full performance of (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction was shown at the end and over the closing credits. It is known that other news outlets broadcast parts of the ceremony, including many local stations and syndicated Entertainment Tonight, however only MTV's The Week In Rock has been known to broadcast the full closing jam with Jeff Lynne's participation.\n\nThe full performance was released on DVD in 2009 on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Live set (on the \"Sweet Emotion\" disc). The YouTube clip provided here is from the Rock 'n' Roll Hall Of Fame archives and is not what was originally broadcast on MTV. That footage is not currently available.\n\nShow: Top Of The Pops\n\nBroadcast Date: 25 February 1988\n\nThis was a music video broadcast of When We Was Fab.

It was broadcast in two parts, on the mornings of Friday, November 4 and Monday, November 7 of 1988. The program is not available for review, so further details are unknown.\n\nShow: Unknown USA VH1 Show\n\nEpisode: Unknown\n\nBroadcaster: VH1 (USA)\n\nRecord Date: Unknown\n\nBroadcast Date: 1988\n\nRunning Time: Unknown Artist: Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison and Tom Petty\n\nSong: Interview\n\nPerformance Type: Interview\n\nThis is from an unknown VH1 program where the group is (supposedly) interviewed by Kathryn Kinley, with (reportedly) only Jeff, Roy and Tom present.\n\nDetails are uncertain, as the broadcast date, exactly program, and interviewees (was George present?) unknown. It may be part of the canned interviews, where the interviews were done as a single press release, then these were sent out to music/entertainment outlets to edit and broadcast as they wanted.\n\nShow: Today\n\nEpisode: S30E??\n\nBroadcaster: NBC (USA)\n\nRecord Date: Unknown\n\nBroadcast Date: November, 1988\n\nRunning Time: Unknown Artist: Jeff Lynne, George Harrison, Roy Orbison and Tom Petty\n\nSong: Interview\n\nPerformance Type: Interview\n\nThis is a short, exclusive interview by Rona Elliot for the NBC morning show Today (sometimes known as The"
