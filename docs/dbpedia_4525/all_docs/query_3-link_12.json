        "text": "Who doesn’t love a bit of rock’n’roll excess? Sex, drugs, music, back-stabbing – much of rock history is tied up in tales of band feuds, ridiculous success, and raucous nights, and that seems to be the template for Daisy Jones & The Six. Prime Video is behind a miniseries adaptation of Taylor Jenkins Reid’s hit novel, spinning a yarn about a fictional ‘70s rock band, ascending to ever-greater heights from their humble LA roots. Think a Fleetwood Mac biopic meets the Stillwater concerts from Almost Famous on a streaming-series budget, and you’re about there. Watch the trailer here:\n\nThe series stars Riley Keough as frontwoman Daisy Jones, experiencing the giddy heights of fame and the precipitous fall of a band break-up, alongside her bandmates – with the cast also including Sam Claflin, Suki Waterhouse, Josh Whitehouse, and a guest appearance from Timothy Olyphant. The series is another hit book adaptation from producer Reese Witherspoon, with Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber as showrunners. Here’s the official synopsis: “In 1977, Daisy Jones & The Six were on top of the world. Fronted by two charismatic lead singers — Daisy Jones and Billy Dunne — the band had risen from obscurity to fame. And then, after a sold-out show at Chicago's Soldier Field, they called it quits. Now, decades later, the band members finally agree to reveal the truth. This is the story of how an iconic band imploded at the height of its powers.”"
