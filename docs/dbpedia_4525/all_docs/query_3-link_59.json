        "text": "Description of the following video:\n\n[Video: Glenn Gass appears and speaks]\n\nI was a graduate student planning to be a classical music composer. And I started teaching rock history to pay my way through grad school.\n\n[Video: A montage of Gass teaching over the years]\n\nGass speaks in voiceover: And it sort of turned into a career I thought I'd keep 'til I didn't get tenure, and then do something else. And then I got tenure, and got promoted, and I'm retiring. And I don't know; somehow it turned into a life. And somehow it's still fun.\n\n[Video: Gass appears and speaks]\n\nIn 1983, we had two classes you could take as a non-major: Music apprec., studying Beethoven, and then my rock history class, and then Beatles.\n\n[Video: A montage of Gass teaching over the years]\n\nGass speaks in voiceover: And now we've got a whole program -- you can get a minor in music as a non-music major. It is the IU School of ... Jacobs School of Music. I think like a lot of us here, we take for granted where we are ...\n\n[Video: Gass appears and speaks]\n\n... but we are at the -- arguably the world's greatest school of music.\n\n[Video: A young Gass stands before the class, with an overhead projector]\n\nGass speaks in voiceover: To be able to do what I do, and do it here -- that's really special.\n\n[Video: Gass appears and speaks]\n\nI've never stopped loving it because I've never stopped loving the music that I play, ...\n\n[Video: A modern Gass stands before the class]\n\nGass speaks in voiceover: ...and every year I get a new group of students that have never heard Chuck Berry before.\n\n[Video: Gass appears and speaks]\n\nSo it's fun all over again for me, and I get to hear my favorite music and cry in class.\n\n[Video: Shots of Gass teaching]\n\nGass speaks in voiceover: I just get to be 14 my whole life, you know, so that's ... whether that's good or bad, it works for me. When I get emotionally involved with the music, that's when it matters to me.\n\n[Video: Gass appears and speaks]\n\nAnd that is actually when it matters to the students too, because they can tell if you're phoning it in, like, I'm just talking about, you know, the Shirelles because we have to, but if you actually really love \"Mama said, there'll be days like this,\" it's like, oh, that's, that's, that's, you know, aside from special events and special guests kind of things. That's, that's the reward for me. I mean, I really do love this music. I don't try to teach it as a history class. It's really an appreciation class ...\n\n[Video: Shot of Gass looking up and out toward a light, smiling broadly]\n\nGass speaks in voiceover: ... which means that I get to appreciate it every time, too.\n\n[Video: Gass appears and speaks]\n\nBottom line, my job is to get excited about the music, ...\n\n[Video: A very young Gass sits on his desk before the class, wearing an IU basketball T-shirt and a denim button-down, speaking enthusiastically]\n\nGass speaks in voiceover: ... if I expect them to. If I can't, then it's ... it's hopeless. So I do get excited about it ...\n\n[Video: Gass appears and speaks]\n\n... and it's not fake, you know -- I love it.\n\n[Video: black]\n\n[Words appear in a series of bubbles, like text messages: Glenn Gass - History of Rock n Roll. his love of it was infectious.]\n\n[Words appear: Same]\n\n[Words appear: Yes! Agreed! Think about that class often! In fact was oddly thinking of it this morning. One that sticks with you. goosbumps every single class.]\n\nGass speaks in voiceover: That's just nice to hear.\n\n[Video: Glenn Gass appears]\n\nI think every teacher dies to think that there are students out there thinking that. I know there are a lot that aren't, but to know that there are some, that ... that means the world. I mean, that's, that's ... your reward as a teacher is that, so, you know, I'm really grateful that I've been able to have that and receive that. I'm not sure that most chemistry teachers get that because it's chemistry, even though they're great -- I know they are -- but because it's rock-and-roll, they somehow feel like oh, we share this bond, and so like that's, you know, that that's like, an unearned run for me, but I'll, I'll take it.\n\n[Video: Students come to the front of the classroom to hug Gass as the rest of the class stands and applauds]\n\n[Video: Fade to black]\n\n[Video: The Indiana University trident appears]\n\n[Words appear: Indiana University]\n\n[Words appear: indiana.edu]\n\n[End of transcript]\n\nDescription of the following video:\n\n[Video: Woman appears]\n\n[Words appear: Constance Cook Glen, Director, Music In General Studies, Jacobs School of Music]\n\nConstance speaks: Thank you, Glenn. Thank you for all you have done for the Music in General Studies program for the Jacobs School of Music -- for the world! If we think of all the students that you have impacted, what is it, 60,000 students, you've made their lives better. You made them happier. I love how your passion informs your teaching --your passion, your enthusiasm, your knowledge, vast amounts of knowledge about so many different things. Not just the Beatles, not just rock-and-roll history, so many things. We really are going to miss you. We're missing that charisma; we're missing that open smile. We're missing that that real commitment to sharing your life with your students, to sharing emotion, to not being afraid to tell them sad things. It's really a remarkable thing; the students respond so well to that. Thank you again, thank you for everything you've done for Music in General Studies. I'll be seeing you. You're gonna have lots of great adventures in the future, and we'll want to hear about them. Thank you.\n\n[Video: Man appears]\n\n[Words appear: Jim Sherman, Professor Emeritus, Psychology]\n\nJim speaks: I guess I would say this about Glenn when, when people hear that someone is teaching a course in rock-and-roll history, or the Beatles, or Bob Dylan, they think it's a way just to entertain students with music. But Glenn was much more than that. He not only exposed them to music, but he taught students how music shaped the culture, the politics, the history, the economy of the times. He was more than a presenter of music. He was a great teacher. I remember most vividly for me in his courses was his covering of the Beach Boys, and especially \"Good Vibrations,\" which he thought was one of the great songs of the era, and how excited and animated he was going through each bar and each measure. So, you know, he's the one, in my view, who started this idea of teaching genres of music as a course, especially rock and roll, and it's really caught on nationwide. My son is on the faculty at UC Davis in California. And they now have a course on the history of rock-and-roll. And my son, who's a psychologist, has put in for teaching a course on punk rock, which was his era. So, you know, Glenn has had effect not only locally but nationally, and, you know, it's a great loss that he's retiring, but as one who recently retired, I understand.\n\nVideo: Man appears]\n\n[Words appear: Andrew Hollinden, Senior Lecturer, Jacobs School of Music]\n\nAndrew speaks: You know, it's a little hard for me to talk about Glenn and the history of rock-and-roll here at IU without speaking in personal terms. Back in the '80s, I was here studying music composition, and rock music -- music that I grew up on and loved as much as any other -- was not part of that curriculum at all. It's something almost kept under wraps, I thought. Anyway, you can imagine my surprise and how thrilled I was when I saw Glenn offering the history of rock-and-roll, and that music that I love so much being taught with such passion and being given academic credibility. So of course, I wanted to be a part of that. So I offered to become his assistant and he hired me, and our as our friendship grew and as our partnership grew, he allowed me to start teaching rock-and-roll courses and developing rock courses and teach alongside of him and be his rock-and-roll brother here at IU. So, for that I'm eternally grateful. So I would like to congratulate Glenn on this long career, thank him for opening up this whole topic in the academic setting here, and allowing me to be part of it, and being so nice to me and my family. I wish you nothing but the best and congratulate you on this long career of yours, and we're going to miss you very much.\n\n[Video: The Indiana University trident appears]\n\n[Words appear: Indiana University]\n\n[Words appear: indiana.edu]\n\n[End of transcript]\n\nDescription of the following video:\n\n[Video: IU student 1 appears]\n\n[Words appear: Students from Glenn Gass' The Music of Bob Dylan class]\n\nStudent 1, a white male with glasses, speaks: Hi, Glenn. This is my third class with you in three semesters. Every part of my week -- this class is my favorite. I listen to the music all of the time, and I talk to my friends all the time about what I learned about it. And I just want to say thank you for letting me -- or equipping me -- with the tools to enjoy music more.\n\n[Video: student 2 appears]\n\nStudent 2, a white female in a Carhartt knit hat, speaks: Hi, I took your first class my first semester here, and I finished out with Bob Dylan my last semester, and I just wanted to say thank you for your classes. They've made my experience at IU much better.\n\n[Video: student 3 appears]\n\nStudent 3, a white male in a Grateful Dead baseball cap, speaks: Hey, man, I don't really know what to say, but yeah, you taught my dad and me. So I really appreciate it. All the music, all the stories. Never forget it. Thanks.\n\n[Video: student 4 appears]\n\nStudent 4, a white male with a ponytail, speaks: Hi, Glenn. Again, like everybody else, not much to say besides, thank you as someone who didn't listen to any this music before. Knowing that I got to learn about old music in the best way possible -- through you -- is one of the true joys of college. So thank you.\n\n[Video: student 5 appears]\n\nStudent 5, a white male with curly hair, speaks: Hi, Glenn. Thank you so much for everything that you've taught me. It goes so far beyond the music. Thank you so much.\n\n[Video: student 6 appears]\n\nStudent 6, a white male with shoulder-length hair and glasses, speaks: Hi, Glenn. I'm really lucky to have been able to have the chance to take all of your classes over my last four years here. They've been the absolute highlight of my college experience, and really one of the best experiences of my life in general. You have a completely unparalleled passion for the music, and thanks for all the time you spent here. It really mattered.\n\n[Video: The Indiana University trident appears]\n\n[Words appear: Indiana University]\n\n[Words appear: indiana.edu]\n\n[End of transcript]\n\nDescription of the following video:\n\n[Video: Glenn Gass stands onstage playing guitar, next to a keyboard player, singing \"Imagine\" by John Lennon]\n\n[Audio: music plays]\n\n[Video: Glenn Gass as a child stands against a wall in a white button-down shirt]\n\n[Video: Text on screen: Glenn was born April 8, 1956\n\n[Video: Glenn Gass as an adolescent in a checkered shorts outfit reading a comic book]\n\n[Video: Text on screen: He grew up in Greencastle, Indiana]\n\n[Video: Return to Glenn Gass standing onstage playing guitar, next to a keyboard player, and singing \"Imagine\" by John Lennon]\n\n[Video: Glenn Gass as a young man holds his arm in the air]\n\n[Video: Text on screen: He taught a Beatles class in 1982]\n\n[Video: Student in very 1980s Molly Ringwald-type clothes and hair, bobbing her head along to music]\n\n[Video: Text on screen: He started teaching the history of rock 'n' roll in 1983]\n\n[Video: Several students listening to music in a classroom]\n\n[Video: Text on screen: His classes became so popular they regularly filled up]\n\n[Video: Several students, including the 1980s girl, sitting in a classroom, smiling and listening]\n\n[Video: Text on screen: Eventually more rock history classes were created]\n\n[Video: a classroom full of students paying attention]\n\n[Video: Glenn Gass stands in front of a class in a lecture hall, leaning against the grand piano behind him and gesturing]\n\n[Video: Text on screen: Now students can earn a certificate in rock history]\n\n[Video: Glenn Gass stands smiling and looking up]\n\n[Video: Text on screen: He taught more than 60,000 students in his career]\n\n[Video: Return to Glenn Gass and band onstage playing \"Imagine\" by John Lennon, finishing the song and thanking the audience]\n\n[Video: Text on screen: Imagine that]\n\n[Video: Black]\n\n[Video: Text on screen: Thanks, Glenn]\n\n[Video: The Indiana University trident appears]\n\n[Words appear: Indiana University]\n\n[Words appear: indiana.edu]\n\n[End of transcript]"
