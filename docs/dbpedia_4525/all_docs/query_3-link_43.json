        "text": "World Series of Rock: 50 Years Later\n\nThe World Series of Rock was a record-setting, day-long, multi-act summer rock concert series held at Municipal Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio, from 1974 to 1980. Created by industry powerhouse Belkin Productions, the World Series of Rock marked the dawn of a golden era in arena rock, with each concert featuring a mix of superstars, local acts, and then up-and-comers – many who have gone on to become Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Inductees.\n\nBon Jovi Forever\n\nA one-of-a-kind, full-floor exhibit spanning four decades of the band’s career along with never-before-seen artifacts from each of the band members that immerses fans in the band’s story and music from inception to the present, celebrating their 40-plus-years. Follow along on the journey from Bon Jovi’s hard-working New Jersey roots to global superstardom.\n\nRevolutionary Women in Music: Left of Center\n\nAs the saying goes, well-behaved women rarely make history – and revolutionary women have often used music and lyrics to take action, convey truth, and call for change. For generations, women have fought against socially constructed gender norms in order to obtain equal social, political, and economic freedoms.\n\nRock Hall at the Ryman\n\nThe Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and Nashville’s legendary venue Ryman Auditorium have come together to create the “Rock Hall at the Ryman” experience in Nashville. Untold stories, interactive exhibits, and never-before-seen artist artifacts at the Ryman with it’s own expansive rock history.\n\nThe Beatles: Get Back to Let It Be\n\nThis groundbreaking exhibition curated by the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame was an immersive complement to Peter Jackson's docuseries, “The Beatles: Get Back.” Fans could experience The Beatles’ creative journey through the exhibit’s original instruments, clothing, and handwritten lyrics used by The Beatles and seen in the film, including items loaned directly by Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, and the estates of George Harrison and John Lennon. The exhibit featured high-definition film clips, audio, and custom projections, transporting fans into The Beatles’ vibrant world of January 1969. Like Jackson's “Get Back” docuseries, the exhibit showed how The Beatles composed and recorded many of their iconic songs from scratch. The exhibit's three screening rooms featured a selection of footage from each location from the docuseries: Twickenham, Apple Studios, and the Apple Corps rooftop. The footage from the recording sessions and conversations turned the clock back to 1969, showing the intimacy, joyousness, and humor as The Beatles wrote and recorded songs for Let It Be, some songs featured on Abbey Road, and future solo albums. Some of the exhibit’s unique items included: Paul McCartney's black and gray shirt that was worn in the studio and handwritten lyrics for \"I've Got A Feeling;\" Ringo Starr's maple Ludwig drum kit and his borrowed red raincoat from the rooftop performance; John Lennon's iconic eyeglasses, Wrangler jacket, an Epiphone electric guitar, and handwritten lyrics for \"Dig A Pony;\" George Harrison's pink pinstripe suit and handwritten lyrics for \"I Me Mine;\" and a record acetate from the sessions, from audio engineer, producer, and Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Inductee Glyn Johns; as well as iconic photography by Linda McCartney and by Ethan Russell, who documented the band’s January 1969 rehearsals, sessions, and rooftop performance, and whose photos are featured in the Let It Be album art.\n\nHotter Than July: The Bruce W. Talamon R&B Photographs\n\nA special exhibition named after Stevie Wonder’s 19th studio album that includes images of Inductees the Isley Brothers, Sir Elton John, and Earth, Wind & Fire, as well as pivotal moments from the culture shifting television series Soul Train and groundbreaking concerts Watts Stax Festival and the 1977 P-Funk Earth tour. Talamon’s work provides a meaningful counterpoint to the voyeurism of those who have marginalized black culture as his photographs share an insider’s view. From the smoke-filled clubs on the Crenshaw Strip in South Los Angeles, to the largest arenas around the world, Talamon was there, recording the frenzy and beauty of the music.\n\nYou Don't Know How It Feels - Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers' Wildflowers\n\nA special exhibit inside Right Here, Right Now will spotlight the Wildflowers album, which was released November 1, 1994. The exhibit included artifacts surrounding the Wildflowers era sessions and corresponding tour including work-in-progress handwritten lyrics to songs like \"Crawling Back To You\" and \"You Don't Know How It Feels,\" Petty's custom Blonde Toru Nittono electric guitar, Mike Campbell's Fender Jazzmaster, Howie Epstein's Fender jazz bass, Scott Thurston's harmonicas and Steve Ferrone's touring Pearl drum kit, along with Tom Petty’s personal wardrobe worn on tour, in the studio and on the cover of Rolling Stone Magazine.\n\nLegends of Rock\n\nKnown as a staple of the Rock Hall for over 20 years, Legends of Rock, an exhibit featuring handwritten drafts of hit singles, performance outfits, and instruments from some of history’s greatest concerts, will now take over four floors of the Museum. When rock & roll burst onto the scene in the mid-1950s, its impact was immediate and explosive. More than a musical sensation, rock & roll was a social and generational phenomenon that became one of the most important artistic movements of the twentieth century. Its seismic influence reverberates across society, impacting how we think about fashion, youth culture, dance, race, sexuality and free speech. It has become a way of life; one that thrives today. Ranging from rhythm & blues, jazz, and folk rock to heavy metal and hip-hop, this exhibition represents a myriad of musical genres and highlights some of the world’s most iconic acts both past and present.\n\nThe Biggest Show on Turf: 55 Years of Halftime Shows\n\nWith a worldwide audience that exceeds 100 million people, the Super Bowl Halftime Show is the most watched musical event in the world. Each halftime performance comes with a different vision and approach. Whether it’s Bruce Springsteen’s dynamic performance with minimalist staging, Bruno Mars’ 1950’s-style R&B revue, the Las Vegas-style showgirl spectacular from Jennifer Lopez and Shakira, or Prince’s rain-soaked stage in the shape of his iconic trademark symbol – they all become distinctive and historic events of our time. Fans can relive decades of memorable Super Bowl moments through performance outfits, instruments, and set pieces.\n\nIt's Been Said All Along: Voices of Rage, Hope and Empowerment\n\nIn every generation, musicians have responded in song and action to promote social justice and equality. What the world is seeing today, as injustices are called out and protesters are finding their voices, is not new. And neither are the musical responses - words and music and passion converging to create something much bigger that cuts deep into the rage, gives hope and radiates empowerment. This exhibition invites you to listen and amplify. Divided into three sections, Voices of Rage, Hope & Empowerment mirrors the museum's physical exhibition, and allows visitors to go deeper into the stories, artifacts and music that promote real change.\n\nIconic: Baron Wolman: Images of an Era\n\nIn 1967, a 21-year-old journalist named Jann Wenner gathered some friends and started the revolutionary rock music publication Rolling Stone, a newsprint magazine that captured the era and defined it in print and pictures. Among the friends that Wenner recruited for the project was Wolman, who had been working as a freelance photographer for magazines like Life and Look. Wolman was hired as the first chief photographer for Rolling Stone. During his tenure at Rolling Stone, Wolman’s lens captured the icons of 1960s rock and pop, including Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Joni Mitchell, the Rolling Stones, Tina Turner, the Who, and many others. Wolman’s unique access to his subjects, combined with his keen eye, gave his photographs an up-close-and-personal quality that was rare and unprecedented. Baron Wolman’s photographs of musicians in the late Sixties encapsulate an unparalleled time in American history. As the first chief photographer for Rolling Stone magazine, Wolman not only documented the era but helped to define it in images for subsequent generations of fans.\n\nInduction All-Access: Photography by Kevin Mazur\n\nOne of the world’s most esteemed celebrity photographers, Kevin Mazur has created iconic images of thousands of artists. His work has been published in countless magazines, books, exhibitions, ad campaigns and on the covers of albums by legendary musicians. Kevin Mazur has been the official photographer for all but two of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremonies. This special exhibition features Mazur’s personally curated selection of his intimate backstage portraits and epic onstage images, providing fans with an up-close and personal look at past Induction moments.\n\nLocal Music U Want: Northeast Ohio Punk and New Wave\n\nThis exhibit, held at the Library & Archives, showcased materials related to NEO Sound and made available through an NHPRC grant to fund the accessibility of the institution's historically important music resources. Local Music U Want focused on the unique Northeast Ohio punk and new wave scenes of the 1970s and ‘80s, fueled by the changing post-industrial landscape of the “Rust Belt.” Unlike other music scenes in the U.S., Northeast Ohio punk and new wave primarily flew under the radar, allowing the music to evolve into something more avant-garde and exploratory. Featured in the exhibit are photos, stickers, flyers, cassette zines and other promotional materials from the Rock Hall’s NEO Sound collections on local bands the Dead Boys, Devo, the Waitresses, Pere Ubu, the Styrenes, Tin Huey, 15 60 75 (The Numbers Band), and more! Donors featured include musicians Chris Butler and Marky Ray and photographer Dave Treat.\n\nJanet Macoska Photography (Airport)\n\nSince 1974, Macoska has photographed rock’s greatest. Inductees David Bowie, Led Zeppelin, The Clash, Heart, DEVO, AC/DC and the Kinks are just some of the artists who Macoska has photographed and utilized her work on their records and in their books. The exhibit featured some of her favorite photographs and captured the energy and spirit of rock & roll that permeates through the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. “These special images from my collection give you a front row seat to concerts that took place right here in my hometown of Cleveland, Ohio, along with iconic moments from the Rock Hall’s history, including its legendary opening 25 years ago,” said Janet Macoska, photojournalist. Macoska is recognized locally, nationally, and internationally for her work. Collections from her vast archive are in the permanent collection of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, The Smithsonian Museum of American History, and The National Portrait Gallery in London, to name a few. Macoska was inducted into The Cleveland Journalism Hall of Fame in 2017 and is represented by Iconic Images in London.\n\nPlay It Loud: Instruments of Rock & Roll\n\nThe instruments used in rock and roll have a profound impact on this art form. Rock fans have long been fascinated with the instruments used by musicians; many seeking out and acquiring the exact models of instruments and equipment used by their idols, and spending countless hours trying to emulate their music and their look. This exhibition is co-organized with the Metropolitan Museum of Art and presents approximately 130 instruments alongside posters, photographs, and costumes. Many of rock's most celebrated and recognized instruments are featured, representing artists across generations and subgenres. In addition to institutional and private collectors, many musicians are lending their performance and recording instruments.\n\nForever Warped: 25 Years of Warped Tour\n\nThis exhibit takes fans through the \"punk summer camp\" memories and highlights the tour was known for. A DIY-friendly and alternative music launch pad, Vans Warped Tour's stages have been the training ground for many punk, ska and alternative bands throughout the years and messages of activism and social responsibility were the guiding forces behind organizations and partners that were part of the festival. To open the special exhibit in June 2019 we were one of the last stops on the final Warped Tour schedule and to celebrate the exhibit's opening we hosted an all-day festival event on our plaza. Videos on playlist include interviews with Warped Tour alum Simple Plan, Hawthorne Heights, We the Kings, Meg & Dia, Emery and The Slackers, performances from the exhibit opening, dedication remarks and a special Vault Tour with Simple Plan.\n\nWoodstock at 50\n\nWoodstock at 50 celebrates the ambition and ingenuity of those who mounted the festival to the performers who played it, gaining a deeper understanding of the various faces of Woodstock and how it changed the music industry. The exhibit features prints, performance outfits, video footage, tickets, original signage, and more.\n\nKing Records: 30 Years that Changed American Music, 1943-1971\n\nFrom 1943 to 1971, Cincinnati's King Records and its subsidiaries, including Queen, DeLuxe, and Federal, revolutionized the ways in which popular music was recorded, manufactured, distributed, and promoted. Under the leadership of founder Syd Nathan, King became a major independent record label, with nearly 500 singles on the R&B, country, and pop charts, and 32 songs making it to Number One. This traveling exhibit on the history of King Records was developed to tell the unique story of this influential company beyond its home of Cincinnati. Following a symposium and exhibit at the Public Library of Cincinnati in 2008 to mark King Records’ 65th anniversary, King Studios, a nonprofit organization was formed at the original King Records headquarters. With funding from ArtsWave, King Studios board member Tim Riordan, the Community Building Institute, historian Brian Powers and designer Chris Schadler collaborated to visually present 30 years of legendary music created by King Records. While installed at the Rock Hall's Library & Archives, the traveling exhibit was enhanced with artifacts and archival items from the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame’s collections. Over 20 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Inductees recorded at King Records, including Hank Ballard and the Midnighters, Dave Bartholomew, James Brown and the Famous Flames, Bootsy Collins, the “5” Royales, Little Willie John, Freddy King, and Professor Longhair. In 2008, King Records was officially designated as a Rock & Roll Hall of Fame landmark. At the ceremony, then-president Terry Stewart stated, “There’s not a more important piece of real estate in musical history than the building over there on Brewster.”\n\nSomething Going On: Jeff Rusnak, A Rock & Roll Life\n\nStarting in the 1970s, Jeff Rusnak (1956-2016) was a fixture in the pits of rock clubs and concert halls in New Jersey, Philadelphia and New York City snapping hundreds of thousands of images. “Jefty” was a late-night disc jockey, musician, producer and manager at the legendary Princeton Record Exchange and an incessant photographer. In true punk rock DIY fashion, he sought out new bands, wrote for fanzine “Music Mercer Now,” and in the 1980s founded Bird O’Pray Records, a cassette label best known for launching teenage band turned alternative icons Ween. Rusnak's deep love of music permeated his life, from playing bass in local indie rock band Fünkaphobia, to his cat Fripp, named after King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp. He was the longtime counter manager of the Princeton Record Exchange and attended live music events nearly every night of his adult life. A massive fan of punk, progressive and alternative rock, Jefty captured many iconic artists early in their careers, both onstage and off. The photos in this collection represent his passion – a life filled with music and musicians, from Yes in the 1970s to the Flaming Lips in the 2010s. When Jeff passed away in 2016, his family generously provided this photo collection to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame to ensure it would be preserved and shared with future generations. The complete Jeff Rusnak Photography Collection is available at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame’s Library & Archives.\n\nPart of the Machine: Rock & Pinball\n\nAn interactive exhibit showcasing rock-themed, playable pinball machines combined with historic merchandise and artifacts to explore the artistic portrayal of artists and bands. Rock and roll and pinball have a lot in common. Loud, colorful and rebellious, it was inevitable that the two would combine to celebrate rock’s icons. Inside the exhibit you'll find machines featuring icons such as KISS, Guns 'n' Roses, Alice Cooper, Dolly Parton, The Who, Elton John and more. All the machines on display are playable by visitors. In addition, the Library & Archives exhibited Part of the Machine: The Collectible & Quirky, featuring some of the quirkier artist-related merchanding objects from the collection. Like rock & roll itself, the merchandise created to celebrate its artists takes many forms, with products that are innovative, flamboyant and at times, weird. Since its beginnings, the rock merchandising machine has artistically immortalized superstars on collectible trading cards, comic books, postage stamps, and picture discs; and rock musicians have even licensed their images for use on dolls, masks, coffins and beyond.\n\nStay Tuned: Rock on TV\n\nSince exploding onto the scene in the post-war 40s, television and rock & roll have reflected social values, shaped the youth culture and created icons. In its early days, they sat at opposite ends of the table, with tv showcasing the normalcy of nuclear family and strong moral lessons, while rock & roll questioned the establishment with a rebellious attitude. But as television sets became a household fixture, advertisers sought to reach the booming youth and teenage demographic and their expendable pocket money, cracking the door for rock & roll’s acceptance into the mainstream through shows like American Bandstand, The Ed Sullivan Show, and The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet. In the multi-floor, multi-sensory, and multimedia exhibition, visitors will also see the birth of the music video, how it reached its pinnacle with the launch and domination of MTV and its sub-brands and used its technology to push music and artistry to new heights.\n\nZombies: Spotlight Exhibit\n\nIn this exhibit, fans and visitors discovered how the band handled their success and enthusiastic fans, how ZZ Top's Frank Beard and Dusty Hill capitalized on the Zombies' popularity, and their continued influence on popular music with artists like Dave Grohl, Alex Turner (Artic Monkeys), the Shins and more. Among the items on display were Chris White's bass guitar, Rod Argent's Hohner electric pianet, sheet music for \"She's Not There,\" Paul Atkinson's acoustic guitar from the recording of \"Tell Her No,\" Hugh Grundy's Ludwig snare drum used on all of the Zombies' 1960s recordings, and the artwork for the band’s critically acclaimed Odessey and Oracle album by Terry Quirk\n\nRolling Stone / 50 Years: Retrospective\n\nAn in-depth look behind the scenes of Rolling Stone's legacy. In the summer of love, a young Jann Wenner set out to start “sort of a magazine and sort of a newspaper.” The idea was to give music lovers more than what pulpy teen magazines and outdated fan magazines had to offer. Wenner was ambitious—he wanted to cover in depth not only the music of the time but also the culture it shaped, its ripple throughout current events, politics and social attitudes. Fifty years later, Rolling Stone is and remains the standard for music journalism.\n\nRapper's Delight Retrospective\n\nRapper's Delight was an exhibit on the history of hip-hop: not only a monument to rappers past but a peek into the future. In 2017, Tupac Shakur was inducted, and rap's prominence was only rising. This exhibit highlighted the similarities between rock and hip-hop through handwritten lyrics, jewelry, costumes, and sketches of stage designs and hand-drawn posters advertising Ice-T at Lollapalooza 1991, where the do-it-yourself aesthetic was unmistakable, as present in the underground hip-hop scene as it was in Riot Grrrl's Pacific Northwest or CBGB's.\n\nSummer of Love Turns 50\n\nFifty years ago, the epicenter of counterculture, the San Francisco neighborhood Haight-Ashbury, attracted young people by the thousands. Though an eclectic group, they often shared similar beliefs: experimentation, a rejection of consumerist values, peace, a general opposition toward the Vietnam War, and a passion for music. The Summer of Love Turns 50 celebrated a time when musicians were looked to as a collective mouthpiece for a generation. Exhibit artifacts included Jimi Hendrix’s purple velvet jacket and recording console used for his “Summer of Love” recordings; a guitar played by Ron “Pigpen” McKernan (Grateful Dead); clothing worn by Michelle Phillips (Mamas and the Papas); iconic concert posters from the Fillmore, Avalon Ballroom and others and original artwork by Marty Balin of Jefferson Airplane. In addition, the Library & Archives showcased concert handbills featuring the visual artists who reflected the culture’s vibrancy.\n\nMellencamp\n\n​Mellencamp told the story of a complex artist who forged his own path—tranforming manager-named \"Johnny Cougar\" to self-possessed John Mellencamp, a music and visual artist, a champion of heartland values, and an advocate for American farmers. The exhibit was comprised mainly of artifacts from Mellencamp's personal collection, including his 1966 silver Honda Scrambler 305 motorcycle, photographs and ephemera, handwritten lyrics, clothing, Dove acoustic guitar used from the 1970s through the 1990s in live performances and songwriting sessions, six original paintings, and selections from an exclusive multi-hour interview with Mellencamp done for the exhibit.\n\nGirls to the Front: Photography by Anastasia Pantsios\n\nPantsios’ work showed the power that women have on stage beginning in 1969 with her shot of Grace Slick. The exhibit traced women in rock through 2006, and featured many recognizable artists, staples of classic rock and Top 40 radio, but Pantsios also photographed lesser known artists whose influence should not be forgotten, such as Plasmatics frontwoman Wendy O. Williams. Another focal point to the exhibit was that some of these women were members of bands rather than solo artists. Rather than merely relegated to the role of \"hot chick singer\" or hiding behind their instrument, Pantsios' photographs allow them to shine on their own—Tina Weymouth of the Talking Heads as an example.\n\nLouder Than Words: Rock, Power, Politics\n\nUsing video, multimedia, photographs, periodicals and artifacts, Louder Than Words showcased the intersection between rock and politics. It explored how artists exercised their First Amendment rights, challenged assumptions and beliefs, stimulated thought and effectedchange. Beyond music’s influence on the civil rights movement, the Vietnam War and gender equality, the exhibit also featured other significant moments and figures, such as Bob Dylan, who rallied people against social inequality, the hip-hop music of the 80s that discussed police brutality in poverty stricken neighborhoods, and Pussy Riot, who utilized their music as an outlet for social activism in Russia. An exhibit at the Library & Archives spotlighted the Riot Grrrl movement, its influences and those performers who, in turn, it influenced.\n\nGraham Nash: Touching the Flame\n\n\"Graham Nash: Touching the Flame\" explored how rock and roll shaped the world and inspired some of history's most powerful figures. With Graham Nash as narrator, the exhibit utilized the two-time Hall of Fame Inductee’s personal collection as a guide to the highs and lows, tumult and joys of the last half century. Pieces from Nash's heroes and inspirations—the Beatles, Everly Brothers, Elvis Presley, Beach Boys, Buddy Holly, and Duane Allman—and treasures from his time with the Hollies and Crosby, Stills and Nash came to life with Nash's reflections on the visceral and profound impact of the music and world events on him and those around him.\n\nBackstage Stories\n\nFocused on the behind-the-scenes work that goes into a concert tour, this exhibit included stage designs, handwritten set lists, performance contract riders, press passes, and more.\n\nJane Scott: Never Too Old for Rock & Roll! (Library & Archives)\n\nDocumented the life of Jane Scott, rock music writer for The Plain Dealer for 40 years; one of the country's first daily newspaper reporters specializing in the genre. Artifacts included photographs, autographs from those she interviewed over the years, newspaper article clippings, and notes taken at local shows.\n\nHerb Ritts: The Rock Portraits\n\nPresented in collaboration with the Herb Ritts Foundation, the exhibit includes over 100 portraits from the revolutionary photographer and filmmaker's collection (with 30 never-before-seen images), firsthand accounts from musicians on what it was like to work with Ritts, a sampling of his award-winning music videos, and contact sheets with Ritts’ red-pencil markings. Ritts photographed some of the world’s biggest music stars. He made startlingly intimate portraits that showed artists as the world had never seen them. Never-before-seen photographs of artists featured in The Rock Portraits exhibit include David Bowie, Bob Dylan, Janet Jackson, Elton John, BB King, Madonna, Prince, Rod Stewart, Justin Timberlake and more.\n\nNever Give Up: Alternative Press Magazine at 30\n\nWhen Alternative Press was founded, mainstream music publications mainly covered arena rockers like Foreigner, REO Speedwagon, and Bruce Springsteen. Music on the fringes—punk, new wave, hardcore—had yet to be labeled \"alternative,\" and its fans had few sources for information. After 30 years, Alternative Press is still going strong because the magazine has always respected the artists and the audience. And it never condescended to either. It's always been about the music, and, true to their mantra, they have never given up. The exhibit includes rarely seen 1994 Alternative Press cover photo proofs featuring the Beastie Boys, along with Nine Inch Nails and Nirvana from the AP archives; letters to the magazine from Henry Rollins; instruments played by Tim Armstrong of Rancid, Byron McMackin of Pennywise, Zach Farro of Paramore, and Benji Madden of Good Charlotte; and clothing worn by Joan Jett, Jay Bentley of Bad Religion, Jennifer Finch of L7, and Bert McCracken of the Used.\n\nLyrics...\n\nBlown up images of lyrics from the Library & Archives collections.\n\nCommon Ground: The Museum Festival Experience\n\nSpanning two floors of the Museum, the exhibit surrounded visitors with the sights and sounds of a rock festival to evoke the experience in a visceral way, utilizing video of the iconic festivals of the past and the vibrant, constantly evolving events of the present, with an emphasis on establishing a “you are there” environment. The first level of the exhibit took visitors through a fast-paced history of popular music festivals with large photographs, artifacts and short documentary films. The second level of the exhibit presented an immersive experience designed to place the visitor squarely into the festival experience. The space represented a performance tent at a festival and visitors encountered a 20 minute film representing a fast moving day at a festival told through a cinematic mash-up of performances, sights, sounds, words and communal energy of iconic music festivals from the past seven decades. The main screen was complimented with synchronized images and lighting that evoked the feeling of day turning into night.\n\nFresh, Wild, Fly and Bold: Photos from the Joe Conzo, Jr. Hip-Hop Collection\n\nThis exhibition included a selection of 26 photos from the early days of hip-hop by photographer Joe Conzo. The photos came from the Cornell University Hip-Hop collection. Called “the man who took Hip-Hop’s baby pictures” by the New York Times, Joe Conzo captured images of the South Bronx between 1977 and 1984, including early hip hop jams, street scenes, and Latin music performers and events. In 1978, while attending South Bronx High School, Conzo became friends with members of the Cold Crush Brothers, an important and influential early hip-hop group. Conzo became the group’s photographer, documenting their live performances.\n\nPaul Simon: Words and Music\n\nThis exhibition featured exclusive candid commentary gathered from hours of filmed interview footage that walks the audience through the personal story of Simon’s life and his creative process. This opening marked the Museum’s first-ever exhibit anchored by first-person narration by the artist. In addition to the autobiographical films, there were videos of select performance highlights from Simon’s five-decade career and a collection of more than 80 artifacts spanning his early life and time with Simon & Garfunkel, through his solo career and to the present. A spotlight exhibit was held at the Library & Archives, focused on the lyrical development of \"The Boxer.\"\n\nSweet Soul Music: FAME Studios and the Muscle Shoals Sound (Library & Archives)\n\nEstablished in 1959 by Rick Hall, Billy Sherrill and Tom Stafford, Florence Alabama Music Enterprises became the foundation for what has come to be known as the “Muscle Shoals Sound.” With a presence as distinct as that of Motown or Sun Records, FAME Studios represented the confluence of country, gospel, and rhythm and blues music with a subtle emphasis on bass guitar and kick drum sounds. In stark contrast to the charted arrangements heard in other popular recording studios of the time, the FAME studio sessions were characterized by the rhythm section’s improvisatory performances, responding to and supporting the melody or most prominent section of each song. The recording style encouraged true musical collaboration, which resulted in an undeniably unique sound that put Muscle Shoals on the musical map. The exhibit illustrated the influence of FAME over many popular artists, including several Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees: Etta James, Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett, Little Richard, Otis Redding, and Duane Allman.\n\nRolling Stones: 50 Years of Satisfaction\n\nThis was the first major comprehensive retrospective exhibition capturing the band’s legendary career spanning more than 50 years. It celebrated the Rolling Stones’ incredible contribution to popular music from their earliest days playing small clubs, to their era-defining recordings such as “Gimme Shelter,” “Paint It Black,” “Jumping Jack Flash,” “Tumbling Dice,” “It’s Only Rock And Roll” and sold-out global tours. Through the use of artifacts, film, text and interactive technology, generations of music fans had the opportunity to get up close and personal with rare items from nearly every aspect of the Stones’ astonishing five decades at the top.\n\nCollecting the Counterculture: Julio Santo Domingo, Jr.\n\nThis exhibit was an exclusive look into the private collection of one of the world’s most passionate collectors. It showcased a number of extraordinary and whimsical objects that Santo Domingo obtained over the course of his lifetime. Santo Domingo (1958-2009) was a Colombian businessman who devoted himself to amassing one of the world’s largest private collections exploring man’s relationship with sex, drugs, the occult, social taboos, popular culture and rock and roll.\n\nThrough the Lens of Jimmy Baynes: Cleveland Rock and Roll History, 1950s-1960s (Library & Archives)\n\nFollowing the lively Cleveland music scene was postal worker Jimmy H. Baynes (July 12, 1922 – September 9, 2010), who supplemented his weekly paycheck through Baynes Foto Service at 2220 East 87th Street, primarily photographing local events in the African-American community. Though Baynes was not a trained photographer, the images he created over the three decades, from the 1950s into the 1980s provide an authentic and candid glimpse into African-American life, music and culture. The bulk of the photographs in the Jimmy Baynes Collection feature prominent jazz, R&B, and rock and roll musicians of the 1950s and 1960s, including the likes of Louis Armstrong, Ruth Brown, Aretha Franklin, Mahalia Jackson, Louis Jordan, Memphis Slim and Lloyd Price.
