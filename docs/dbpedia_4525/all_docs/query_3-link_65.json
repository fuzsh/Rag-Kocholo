        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI have read probably 500-1000 books on popular music, especially music of the post-WWII era. You all know some of the greats... books by Peter Guralnick, Griel Marcus, Richard Williams, Christgau, Dave Marsh, Ashley Kahn, Azzerad, Lewisohn, Patti Smith's \"Just Kids,\" Bob Blumenthal, Lester Bangs, Morgenstern, etc. I even love really good books about artists I dislike. (I am thinking of great biographies of Motley Cru and Jim Morrison.)\n\nBUT... I think what Andrew Hickey is doing with his podcast, which he is also publishing as books, is going to be a classic text. He brings a kind of Foucaultian historical analysis to the music. It is really on another-level of the normal \"classic rock\" head. (As an example, the recent terrible book about music from 1971.) As an academic myself, he is adding the kind of rigor that good peer-reviewed work offers. (Sorry to sound pretentious.)\n\nLink: A History of Rock Music in 500 Songs\n\nEpisodes to sample:\n\nEpisode 3: Ida Red - Bob Wills\n\nEpisode 21: Rock Island Line - Lonnie Donnegan\n\nEpisode 26: Ain't That a Shame - Fats Domino\n\nEpisode 100: Love Me Do - Beatles\n\nEpisode 106: Louie Louie - Kingsmen\n\nEpisode 122: A Change is Gonna Come - Sam Cooke\n\nEpisode 132: I Can't Help Myself - The Four Tops\n\nEpisode 139: Eight Miles High - The Byrds\n\nEpisode 145: Tomorrow Never Knows - The Beatles\n\nEpisode 156: I Was Made to Love Her - Stevie Wonder\n\nEpisode 157: See Emily Play - The Pink Floyd\n\nEpisode 164: White Light / White Heat - The Velvet Underground (second to last episode so for)\n\nCheck any of these out. This is good historical / critical work that punctures a lot of the album-based classic-rock ********.\n\nBest,\n\nJ.\n\nLove Andrew’s podcast. I started to listen to an episode out of order a couple of years ago and decided that starting from episode one was the only way to go. I’m currently all caught up, and ended up becoming a Patreon supporter to get the bonus episodes as well. I haven’t read as many popular music books as @Mincer Ray, but Andrew’s ability to draw together different historical antecedents to show where the music came from, and showing the roots of where it will go, goes far beyond any of the books about rock or rock artists that I’ve read. I learn something new with every episode. Andrew has some personal quirks, and I don’t agree with everything he says, but on balance he’s just fantastic.\n\nI started with the first episode about two weeks ago after seeing someone here on the Forums mention the White Light / White Heat episode. I've gotten through the first 62 and am loving every bit of it. Yes, Andrew is quirky, but he's amazingly informative and entertaining. Plus it's great to hear clips of the many songs/artists that he references. I plan to sponsor him on Patreon to hear the bonus episodes once I get caught up. Really good stuff.\n\nI wondered about that. His cadence on \"Roll 'Em, Pete\" (episode # 2) is very fast, to the point where I wondered if I was accidentally listening at 2x. I suspect after that episode someone suggested he dial it back a bit, which is possibly why the episodes between that and, say, episode 13 or 14 are so deliberate-sounding. He definitely sounds far more at-ease now than he did in some of those early episodes.\n\nYes, it's much better now than at the beginning. I wish he would apply some compression to both bring things up in volume and keep things at a standard level. I listen while I'm driving around and when my navigation come on from my phone, it's like 3 times as loud as the podcast (both through Bluetooth, so only one volume control).\n\nI can’t recommend this podcast enough! And I have bought three of his books for my Dad. I got Rock and Roll books 1 and 2 for him last year, and when i asked him what he wanted for Father’s Day this year he said Book 3. That is obviously not done yet but I got him the California Dreamin’ book because he loves 60s and hot-rod and cruisin’ music. So far he loves it!\n\nI’m a visual artist not a musician but his podcasts are very creatively exciting to me. There are aspects to creativity that could be applied to art or music, or writing for that matter. He inspires me to get back to work on my thesis because his research and insights are also very stimulating.\n\nI’m a patron also and it’s well worth it. Love the bonus episodes. The last one was on Tiny Tim and it was compelling!\n\nYep, I enjoyed that Tiny Tim episode as well. I co-host a podcast dedicated to movies revolving around music or musicians. A few years back, we had the director of a documentary about Tiny Tim called King For a Day come on the show. Man, that film blew away a number of misconceptions I had about TT....and maybe reinfoced some others.....still, it made me listen to some of his music, and that debut album is fantastic. So glad that Andrew saw fit to give an episode over to TT.\n\nI’ve listened some at 1.25x—ideal for narration, less so for the music (tho often an interesting alt)!\n\nYou probably have software volume controls (at least \"louder/softer\") somewhere within each app, the player and the navigator."
