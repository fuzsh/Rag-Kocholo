        "text": "I see that there is a lengthy \"History of Rock 'n' Roll\" (a/k/a \"History of Rock and Roll\") thread on this site which, for some reason, is closed to further posts. That's unfortunate, as I've only just discovered it, read it and see that is is full of questions and an array of answers ranging from 100% correct to completely out to lunch.\n\nAs the guy who researched, wrote, programmed and, with Bill Drake, co-produced the Billboard award-winning 52 hour 1978 version of \"History of Rock 'n' Roll,\" I have been answering questions about the HRR and its various incarnations for now close to 40 years. The most-asked question is, \"Can I buy a copy?\" The answer is, legally, no -- because, due to licensing restrictions, no copies have ever been legally sold. In the pre-CD era of 1978, a copy of the HRR -- either a box set of 52 12\" LPs or 52 10\" reels of quarter-inch tape (depending of which format a station preferred) -- was shipped to affiliates for broadcast use only within a contracted time period. A copy was thus not SOLD to the station but instead LENT to it -- with the understanding that after that contracted time period ended, the station would ship their copy back to Drake-Chenault. Nearly all did -- but a few copies were never returned. They became the source of all the bootleg editions since.\n\nThe most bootlegged sequence from the HRR -- the fabled closing Timesweep -- came about because I wanted to include more material in the HRR than one could fit into 52 hours. After writing hours spotlighting major artists and musical movements, I crafted half-hours focused on each of the post-1955 rock 'n' roll years. They were designed to spotlight key hits I couldn't slip in elsewhere. Then, to go a step further, I had our engineers assemble and work into those half-hours what I called the A and B montages. The B montages were made up of other significant hits I has no time to play in full. The A montages were crafted to showcaee, in chronological order, every #1 hit on Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart in that year.\n\nOne large reel stored all the A montages; a second all the B montages. When one of our engineer's girlfriends asked to hear what any of the HRR was going to sound like, he borrowed the A montage reel from the studio, took it home and put it up on his tape deck. \"Here,\" he said to her. \"You can listen to this while I go out an pick up a pizza.\" He then started the tape and departed. When he came back, his girlfreind was sitting cross-legged in front of speakers with tears in her eyes. \"What's wrong?\" he said. Between sobs, she replied,\" I\"ve just heard my whole life pass before my ears.\" When Iwas told that, I knew how I would end \"The History of Rock 'n' Roll.\" All those A montages were edited together and made up the bulk of Hour 52.\n\nChief engineer Mark Ford spent weeks crafting every one of those A montages. I handed chief engineer Mark Ford the list from Billboard, which started with Dean Martin's \"Memories are Made of This\" -- and it was no easy task. Mark had to deal with recordings cut in hundreds of different studios under hundreds of different standards and had to find a way to make them float together in a predetermined fixed order -- and do it all in meter! The fact that Mark was able to turn out what he did -- especially considering the sub-optimum Radio Shack grade studio he had to work in, cutting quarter inch tape bits with a razor blade -- is nothing short of astounding.\n\nMark mixed all 52 hours of \"The History of Rock 'n' Roll,\" using stereo masters when we could find them and mono when we couldn't. One rare stereo track in the HRR is Ray Charles' \"What'd I Say,\" which Atlantic had only issued in true stereo on one rare LP and it was there 360 degrees out of phase! Mark put it back in crystal-clear phase so well that when he played it back for me in his tiny studio, I felt like I was present at a live session with Ray.\n\nWe were all immensely proud of the 1978 \"History of Rock 'n' Roll,\" which had been originally intended as a quick update of the 1968-9 KHJ version -- which I had first heard (and been blown away by) over WLS in Chicago. I knew little of rock history at that time (1970), other than what I'd picked up from Frank Kingston Smith's ecellent \"Retro Rock\" radio features. But the HRR inspired me to become an obsessed rock 'n' roll historian -- which I swiftly became.\n\nAfter Drake hired me in 1976 to update the HRR, I was finally able to sit down and read its legendary 1969 typewritten script. With every page I turned, thouhg, the more appalled I became. Aside from the fact that the KHJ production was highly disorganized, it was absolutely riddled with errors and poor judgement calls. This was because very little rock 'n' roll research has been done by anyone previously. The KHJ crew had had little to draw information from beyond teen magazines of the time and old KHJ playlists. The was no internet to search, Rolling Stone was little more than a year old and Joel Whitburn had yet to release any of his Record Research books. No wonder the KHJ production was so far off base!\n\nI went to Bill Drake, showed him the problems and explained that the HRR would have to be rebuilt from the ground up. He agreed -- which is why the only part of the KHJ production which got saved was its fabled \"Phil Specotr Listneing Test\" sequence. (Phil was asked to listen to and offer his own comment on several key '60s hits.)\n\nThe first thing I did was format the 52 hours into self-contained half-hour or hour-long themed modules. Aside from bringing cohesion to the chaos, that move allowed stations the option of running the HRR either as a 52 hour marathon or in self-contained hour-long blocks. Another change I made was to, as much as possible, have the original recording arts, writers or producers tell the stories behind their songs in their own words -- rather than have a narrator do it. Fortunately I had been recording in-person story-behind-the-song interviews with hitmakers for years by then and still do that -- more than 3,000 so far! They're filed in my archives which contain material (including nearly one million tracks) on nearly every hitmaker from Thomas Edison to the present. Some of that content turns up today in my syndicated daily 2 1/2 minute feature version of \"The History of Rock 'n' Roll.\"\n\nAnyway -- if you want to know about the HRR in its variouis forms, just ask. I'm the keeper of the flame. -- Gary Theroux\n\nGreat story! Was the show designed for/did it run on just Drake-Chenault stations or did any AOR or other Top-40s run it as well? And on about how many affiliates in how many markets did it run? Who owns the rights now?\n\nDrake-Chenault was primarily a pioneer syndicator of automated formats to medium and small market stations which wanted a big city professional sound but did not have the financial resoures to pay for a costly fulltime staff of grade A radio talent. This was back when there were many independent stations or small groups of stations (up to six) under a single ownership. Deregulation by the FCC changed all that, allowing monsters like Cox and Clear Channel to buy up hundreds of those formerly independent stations and small station groups. Those firms then forced upon their affiliates one-size-fits-all-markets-but-doesn't-really-fit-any-of-them-very-well syndicated formats of their own invention. In other words, the mega broadcasting chains seized what Drake-Chenault had pioneered and took their concept to its extreme -- killing off each individial station's greatest strength: their ability to tighly customize themselves to perfectly match the specific and distinct wants, needs and desires of their target demo in their particular market.\n\nDrake-Chenulat also owned a few stations, such as K-100 in Los Angeles, but their primary focus was on syndicating formats and programs as well as providing consultation services.\n\nThe 1978 \"History of Rock 'n' Roll\" ran on at least 800 stations around the world, from WCBS-FM in New York to WLS-AM in Chicago to K-100-FM in L.A. It won Billboard's \"Top Special Program of the Year\" award, a prize which is no longer given out because in today's radio there are next to no special programs produced by anybody anymore. (There were lots in 1978.)\n\nA few months after the release of the HRR, while I was planning future series and specials for Drake-Chenault to syndicate, I was abruptly fired by its then general manager -- who wanted to give my job to his best friend. When Drake heard about it, he was furious and ordered the GM to rehire me immediately with a substantial raise. However, in the interim, I had been offered and signed a contract with a rival firm and could not get out of that deal. Bill and I, though, remained good friends for the rest of his life -- even serving together on the nominating committee of the Hit Parade Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 1981 Drake-Chenault Enterprises tried to create an updated edition of the HRR by cutting out portions of my 1978 production in order to make room for hours of new content. While I had designed the HRR in modules, making it relatively easy to make updates, I had no idea of what a hack job was about to take place without my input or approval. They cut out nearly all of the '50s and pre-Beatles '60s (!) in order to clear room for hours devoted to people who happened to be hot in 1981 -- if they had anything to do with rock 'n' roll or not. Thus, for example,. came an hour devoted to the career of Dionne Warwick -- an excellent artist by any standard but one who never cut a rock record in her life. Dionne even phoned me to ask why on earth she was being so profiled in a rock history show! All I could tell her was that the matter was out of my hands.\n\nThe 1981 HRR was promoted as the \"Golden Anniversary\" edition (golden anniversary of what?) and, unlike the 1978 production, was a near complete failure in syndication.\n\nNot long after, Drake-Chenault Enterprises folded and its asssets were sold to Jones Broadcating, which became the first in a succession of firms to own what was left of D-C's treasures. At the present time Westood One owns the tapes of the award-winning 1978 production, but does not list the \"History of Rock 'n' Roll\" on its website. While stations who know Westwood One owns the 52 hours can spccial order the show from them for rebroadcast, the fact that its contents are now 39 years out of date kinds of limits it syndication. I'd love to assemble an updated 52 hours today, but the fact is next to no commercial radio stations today would be willing to run a showe covering some 60+ years of musical evoluton. To get around that, I've reworked the HRR concept into a daily 2 1/2 minute feature version. Each evergreen episode spotlights three successive key hits by an aritst and interviews that star's comments throughout. As each episode is self-contained, stations have the option of skipping over any episode featuring hit music they do not wish to showcase.\n\nSo who owns the trademark name \"History of Rock 'n' Roll\" today? I do. I also own most all the interviews heard in the 1978 production (plus several thousand more!), but not the compilation production I assembled for and with Bill Drake between 1976 and 1978. Westwood One has that -- and, ironically, Westwood One was formed during the period in which \"The History of Rock 'n' Roll\"was in production. Even more ironic, I was one of the first guests on one of Westwood One's earliest series. That was back when their offices were located above a small store in Westwoos Village, just off the campus of UCLA, where I was teaching."
