        "text": "Netflix has an extensive library of films and TV shows, including various rock and roll movies.\n\nFrom biopics to concert films, there's something for every music fan to enjoy.\n\nIn this article, we'll explore ten rock and roll movies you can watch on Netflix.\n\n1. The Dirt (2019)\n\nReleased digitally on Netflix on March 22, 2019.\n\nBased on the bestselling autobiography by glam metal band Mötley Crüe titled \"The Dirt: Confessions of the World's Most Notorious Rock Band.\"\n\nThe film has a star-studded cast, including Douglas Booth, Machine Gun Kelly, and Iwan Rheon. A raunchy look at the decadent world of one of the most scandalous rock bands of the 80s, the Dirt may not be for everyone due to its explicit content.\n\nUnfortunately, The Dirt offers a staged VH1-like portrayal of the hair band's rise to fame, filled with sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll. While the film has gained some following among glam metal era and Mötley Crüe fans, it has been panned by critics.\n\n2. Bohemian Rhapsody (2018)\n\nThe film world premiere took place at Wembley Arena in London on October 23, 2018.\n\nRami Malek stars as Freddie Mercury in this Oscar-winning biopic about the legendary frontman of Queen. This biographical film explores the life and career of one of the most iconic figures in rock music history. Bohemian Rhapsody provides an emotional journey through the ups and downs of Queen, showcasing its music and impact on the industry. The film also chronicles the band's rise to fame and Mercury's struggle with fame and drugs. Bohemian Rhapsody culminates in Queen's iconic Live Aid performance on July 13, 1985.\n\nMalek's performance as Freddie Mercury received widespread acclaim, and the film's faithful recreation of Queen's performances and music has made it a favorite among fans.\n\n3. Almost Famous (2000)\n\nReleased on September 22, 2000.\n\nCameron Crowe wrote and directed the semi-autobiographical film. He drew from his own experiences as a teenage rock journalist, lending a sense of authenticity to the story. The plot is about a teenage journalist who goes on tour with Stillwater, a fictional rock band in the 1970s.\n\nThis film is cherished by rock music fans for its portrayal of the 1970s rock scene. Featuring memorable performances from Kate Hudson, Frances McDormand, and Billy Crudup, Almost Famous is a love letter to the golden age of rock and roll. Its heartfelt narrative captures the essence of the era and the passion and excitement surrounding rock music.\n\nAlmost Famous has a killer soundtrack featuring classic rock songs such as \"Tiny Dancer\" by Elton John, \"America\" by Simon & Garfunkel, and \"Sparks\" by The Who.\n\n4. Olé Olé Olé! A Trip Across Latin America (2016)\n\nThis documentary follows the Rolling Stones as they embark on their first tour of Latin America in over a decade. From sold-out stadiums to intimate performances, Olé Olé Olé! captures the excitement and energy of one of the greatest rock bands of all time.\n\nThe film primarily centers on the Rolling Stones' period spent in Argentina, a country where obsessed fans of the Stones form a dedicated urban group reminiscent of the Deadheads (The Grateful Dead fans), known as \"rolingas.\"\n\n5. What Happened, Miss Simone? (2015)\n\nThis documentary explores the life and music of legendary singer and civil rights activist Nina Simone.\n\nUsing rare archival footage and interviews with friends and family, \"What Happened, Miss Simone?\" is a powerful tribute to one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century.\n\n6. Jimi: All Is by My Side (2013)\n\nAndré Benjamin (aka André 3000, of Outkast fame) stars as Jimi Hendrix in this biopic about the legendary guitarist.\n\nSet in London between 1966 and 1967, the film follows Hendrix as he rises to fame and navigates the turbulent landscape of the time.\n\n7. Metallica: Some Kind of Monster (2004)\n\nThis documentary follows Metallica as they record their album St. Anger and deal with the departure of their longtime bassist Jason Newsted.\n\nWith unprecedented access to the band's inner workings, Some Kind of Monster is a fascinating look at one of the biggest bands in heavy metal.\n\n8. Amy (2015)\n\nThis documentary chronicles the life and tragic death of British singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse.\n\nUsing rare archival footage and interviews with family and friends, Amy is a heartbreaking portrait of one of the most talented and troubled musicians of her generation.\n\n9. We Are Twisted Fucking Sister! (2014)\n\nThis documentary tells the story of Twisted Sister's rise to fame in the 1980s.\n\nFeaturing interviews with the band members and archival footage of their wild and over-the-top performances, We Are Twisted Fing Sister! is a must-watch for fans of '80s hair metal.\n\n10. Rock of Ages (2012)\n\nThis jukebox musical stars Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta. They are a small-town girl and a city boy who meet and fall in love in Los Angeles (not in South Detroit) during the 1980s. Featuring hit songs from bands and artists like Journey, Bon Jovi, and Poison, Rock of Ages is a fun and cheesy tribute to the era of big hair.\n\nRock Intersection Favorites\n\nThe best rock movies stand out for their compelling storytelling, memorable performances, and their ability to capture the quality, talent, style, influence, spirit, and energy of rock music. Our two favorite rock movies are \"Almost Famous\" and \"Bohemian Rhapsody.\"\n\nHowever, it's important to note that individual preferences may vary and not everyone is on Netflix. There maybe other films on your list that resonate strongly with different rock music fans."
