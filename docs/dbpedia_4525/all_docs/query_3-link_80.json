Previews will begin on Friday, March 29, 2024, and opening night is set for Monday, April 22, 2024.\n\nA raucous rom-com wrapped in pure musical joy, The Heart of Rock and Roll centers on a couple of thirty-somethings who know exactly what they want from life—until they find each other. It’s going to take “The Power of Love” — and a little help from their friends — to show them the way. Jam-packed with Huey Lewis megahits like \"Workin’ For A Livin’,\" \"Stuck With You,\" and “If This Is It,” this is Broadway's newest feel-great musical.\n\nThe production will feature a book by Jonathan A. Abrams, and story by Tyler Mitchell and Jonathan A. Abrams. Music supervision, arrangements, and orchestrations by Brian Usifer, choreography is by Lorin Latarro and The Heart of Rock and Roll will be directed by Gordon Greenberg.\n\n“Working on our show has been so gratifying,” said Huey Lewis. “I’ve always been a storyteller, and it’s a thrill to see my songs woven together in service of a fantastic, new story. That it will all take place on the world’s most prestigious stage – Broadway – just makes the ride that much sweeter.”\n\nHunter Arnold added, \"Huey Lewis’s song catalogue is not just music—it's a powerful bridge to an era when our hearts danced freely, love knew no bounds, and every moment was a celebration of life. This show is more than nostalgia; it is remedy for our age of anxiety and a joyful gift to Broadway audiences.\"\n\nCasting and additional news will be announced at a later date.\n\nTickets are now on sale at Telecharge.com or by calling Telecharge at 212-239-6200 or 800-447-7400.\n\nThe Heart of Rock and Roll premiered in San Diego at The Old Globe, helmed by Erna Finci Viterbi Artistic Director Barry Edelstein and the Audrey S. Geisel Managing Director Timothy J. Shields, in 2018.\n\nB I O G R A P H I E S\n\nHuey Lewis (Music). As the legendary, Grammy Award-winning front man for one of America’s great rock & roll bands, Huey Lewis has been a central force in the music industry since the early 1980s, when Huey Lewis and The News first shot to superstardom. Formed from two rival Bay Area bands in 1979, The News has been thrilling audiences worldwide for more than 40 years, selling more than 20 million albums in the process. Among their most indelible singles are the top ten hits, “Heart of Rock & Roll,” “Stuck With You,” “I Want A New Drug,” “If This Is It,” “Hip To Be Square,” “Do You Believe In Love,” and “Workin’ For A Livin”. The group also wrote and performed “The Power of Love” and “Back in Time” for the hit film Back To The Future. “The Power of Love” went on to earn an Academy Award nomination and reach #1 on Billboard’s singles chart. In 2018, The News released Weather, their first album of original material in more than two decades, shortly after Lewis revealed that debilitating hearing loss, caused by a multi-decade’s long battle with Meniere’s disease, would likely put an early end to his remarkable singing career.
