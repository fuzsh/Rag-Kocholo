Have an account? .\n\nMeryl Streep is best known for \"Sophie's Choice,\" \"The Devil Wears Prada,\" and \"Mamma Mia.\"\n\nBut her highest-rated films are \"Everything Is Copy\" and \"Everybody Knows ... Elizabeth Murray.\"\n\nAccording to critics, her lowest-rated films are \"Lions for Lambs\" and \"Evening.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStreep's lowest-rated film is \"Lions for Lambs\" (2007).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 27%\n\nSummary: The war drama \"Lions for Lambs\" explores the interconnected ties between college professor Stephen Malley (Robert Redford), presidential hopeful Senator Jasper Irving (Tom Cruise), journalist Janine Roth (Streep), and a troop of US soldiers in Afghanistan.\n\nCritics felt the drama was too heavy-handed in its messaging and suffered from a staggered pacing.\n\n\"The film is built not upon characters and plot but upon ideas,\" James Berardinelli wrote for Reel Views. \"That would be fine if the ideas were revolutionary or interesting, but they're fairly commonplace.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actress played Lila in \"Evening\" (2007).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 27%\n\nSummary: In \"Evening,\" when Ann (Vanessa Redgrave) falls ill, she surprises her daughters Constance (Natasha Richardson) and Nina (Toni Collette) when she calls out the name of a man she loved long ago. In flashbacks stretching back 50 years, Ann reminisces about her past.\n\nStreep played Ann's college friend Lila.\n\nDespite its stellar cast of actresses, critics felt like the family drama held its actors back from displaying their full potential.\n\n\"The performances are oddly muted, as if the screenplay refuses to allow a fine cast full rein,\" Derek Malcolm wrote for the London Evening Standard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"The House of the Spirits\" (1994), she was Clara.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 32%\n\nSummary: Based on the novel by Isabel Allende, \"The House of the Spirits\" traces the lives of a family across generations as Chile goes through massive social and political changes.\n\nStreep had a starring role in the film as Clara, the wife of Esteban (Jeremy Irons).\n\nReviewers were puzzled by \"The House of the Spirits,\" which had all of the elements of a promising drama but proved to be a disappointment.\n\n\"How can an accomplished director take a great novel, the best actors working and the finest technicians available and make a film so ... bland?\" Carrie Rickey wrote for The Philadelphia Inquirer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStreep starred as Carolyn Ryan in \"Before and After\" (1996).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 32%\n\nSummary: After their young son Jacob (Edward Furlong) is accused of murder, Ben (Liam Neeson) and Carolyn Ryan (Streep) do everything in their power to prove their son's innocence as the neighbors in their small town turn against them.\n\nCritics couldn't deny that \"Before and After\" had enviable star power, but they said the acting couldn't overcome unrelatable characters and an uneven script.\n\n\"Despite Meryl Streep, Liam Neeson and the usually estimable Edward Furlong, this nonevent huffs and puffs to attain even the level of an ordinary motion picture,\" Mike Clark wrote for USA Today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe had a leading role as Chief Elder in \"The Giver\" (2014).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 35%\n\nSummary: Based on the science-fiction novel by Lois Lowry, \"The Giver\" takes place in the near future, where Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) comes of age in a utopian society that has eliminated all need for emotion.\n\nStreep played a crucial role in the film as the Chief Elder of the society.\n\nCritics felt like \"The Giver\" was a rushed adaptation that failed to capture the charm of the compelling young-adult novel.\n\n\"The problems show up during the climactic action sequences,\" Sandra Hall wrote for The Sydney Morning Herald. \"Logic is jettisoned and once that happens, the basic flaws in the whole scenario become all too obvious.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Dark Matter\" (2008), Streep was university patron Joanna Silver.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 41%\n\nSummary: In \"Dark Matter,\" a gifted exchange student named Liu Xing (Liu Ye) faces opposition at an American university when his groundbreaking theories on dark matter go against his teacher's life work.\n\nStreep had a supporting role in the drama as Liu's benefactor Joanna Silver.\n\nWith strange tonal shifts and haphazard plotting, \"Dark Matter\" made reviewers feel like they were watching two movies at once.\n\n\"There is nothing wrong with taking inspiration from actual events, but it's a tricky business, and 'Dark Matter' does no one right by sticking to the shocking conclusion,\" Reyhan Harmanci wrote for the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe played Ellen Martin in the dramatic comedy \"The Laundromat\" (2019).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 41%\n\nSummary: Based on a true story, \"The Laundromat\" follows scheming law partners Jürgen Mossack (Gary Oldman) and Ramón Fonseca (Antonio Banderas) who make their money helping the super-wealthy get richer. But they face comeuppance when Ellen Martin (Streep) uncovers a big issue.\n\n\"The Laundromat\" earned mixed reviews from critics, who felt director Steven Soderbergh's narrative oversimplified a complex issue.\n\n\"An intriguingly interpretive if scattershot and tonally uneven attempt to deconstruct the financial and legal arcana contained in the massive data-dump known as the Panama Papers,\" wrote Ann Hornaday for The Washington Post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actress starred opposite Jack Nicholson in the romantic drama \"Heartburn\" (1986).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 45%\n\nSummary: In \"Heartburn,\" renowned food critic Rachel (Streep) marries newspaper columnist Mark (Jack Nicholson), but she quickly realizes that she is jumping through hoops to make their marriage work while Mark grows more and more distant.\n\nAlthough \"Heartburn\" wasn't a complete wash with critics, most felt like a film with such reputable actors and a sharp director should have been better.\n\n\"Despite engaging performances by Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson, the screen adaptation of Nora Ephron's popular novel is shallow and wan,\" William Wolf wrote for The San Bernardino Sun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actress played Mary Fisher in \"She-Devil\" (1989).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 46%\n\nSummary: In \"She-Devil,\" after romance novelist Mary Fisher (Streep) successfully seduces a married man (Ed Begley Jr.), his wife holds nothing back in seeking her revenge.\n\nAlthough they championed Streep's performance, many critics felt like \"She-Devil\" bordered on being outright offensive rather than funny,\n\n\"Meryl Streep is divine in this misguided guilty pleasure,\" Neil Cohen wrote for Echo Magazine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStreep appeared as Corrine Whitman in \"Rendition\" (2007).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 47%\n\nSummary: In the drama \"Rendition,\" chemical engineer Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally) disappears without a trace on a flight from South Africa to the US. Fearing that he's been captured, his wife Isabella (Reese Witherspoon) travels to Washington DC to demand answers.\n\nStreep appeared as Corrine Whitman, a superior at the CIA.\n\n\"Rendition\" hit theaters to mixed reception, with some critics accusing it of being ham-fisted and lacking nuance.\n\n\"'Rendition' is a barely tolerable narrative masquerading as an important film,\" Felicia Feaster wrote for Creative Loafing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe played a therapist in \"Prime\" (2005).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 50%\n\nSummary: In the romantic comedy \"Prime,\" therapist Lisa Metzger (Streep) is in for a surprise when she realizes that her son David (Bryan Greenberg) is dating her favorite client Rafi Gardet (Uma Thurman).\n\nAlthough some critics said \"Prime\" was a touch better than most formulaic romantic comedies, others expected more from a film starring Streep and Thurman.\n\n\"'Prime' is an above average romantic comedy that still doesn't quite make the grade,\" wrote film critic Cole Smithey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe won an Academy Award for her role in \"The Iron Lady\" (2012).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 52%\n\nSummary: \"The Iron Lady\" tells the story of how Margaret Thatcher (Streep) came to power as the first female prime minister of England as she clashed against male leaders in the political realm.\n\nFor critics, the drama itself left much to be desired, but Streep's tour-de-force performance elevated \"The Iron Lady\" by leaps and bounds. The role won her the Oscar for best actress.\n\n\"What keeps 'The Iron Lady' afloat is the mesmerizing work of its star,\" Leonard Maltin wrote for IndieWire. \"As we already know, Streep goes beyond mimicry to fully inhabit her characters, from 'The French Lieutenant's Woman' to Julia Child.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStreep played Molly Gilmore in the romantic drama \"Falling in Love\" (1984).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 54%\n\nSummary: In \"Falling in Love,\" artist Molly Gilmore (Streep) and architect Frank Raftis (Robert De Niro) can't deny that they share a certain spark when a mail-delivery error causes them to meet — even though they're both married to committed partners.\n\nDe Niro and Streep had solid chemistry, but critics felt like the directing style was mismatched with its overt close-ups and punishingly long sequences.\n\n\"The close-up just won't go away,\" Paul Attanasio wrote for The Washington Post. \"It's odd that [Ulu] Grosbard is known as an actor's director, because no actor can take this kind of relentless pressure ... you get Streep's whole performance, outtakes and all.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the comedy \"Death Becomes Her\" (1992), she played Madeline Ashton Menville.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 55%\n\nSummary: In \"Death Becomes Her,\" famed actress Madeline Ashton Menville (Streep) uses a potion of immortality to compete with her rival Helen Sharp (Goldie Hawn). But she realizes too late that the ability to live forever comes at a cost.\n\nEven as Streep continued to prove her prowess as a comedic actress, critics felt like \"Death Becomes Her\" was overblown and relied too heavily on slapstick humor.\n\n\"Meryl Streep shines in a glitzy black comedy, but it's still 'She-Devil' with a make-over,\" wrote Richard Corliss for Time magazine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actress played Dee Dee Allen in \"The Prom\" (2020).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 55%\n\nSummary: In \"The Prom,\" based on the Broadway musical of the same name, a group of Broadway stars — Dee Dee Allen (Streep), Barry Glickman (James Corden), and Angie Dickinson (Nicole Kidman) — visit a small, conservative town in Indiana where a teen is fighting to take her girlfriend to the high-school prom.\n\nCritics were split on their reviews for the Netflix film, with some praising its feel-good story and others lamenting its failure to serve its source material.\n\nDavid Fear wrote for Rolling Stone, \"This is what it looks like when you 'Glee' a beloved Broadway production to death.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStreep starred as Donna in the movie musical \"Mamma Mia\" (2008).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 55%\n\nSummary: In the musical comedy \"Mamma Mia,\" Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) stumbles upon her mother Donna's (Streep) old diary and realizes that her estranged father could be one of the three men mentioned in the pages. As her wedding approaches, Sophie invites her three possible fathers to their hotel on the fictional Greek island of Kalokairi.\n\nAlthough more cynical critics called \"Mamma Mia\" flimsy and forced, others let go of narrative critique and allowed themselves to get sucked into the fun of the musical numbers.\n\n\"This is entertainment, not a movie,\" Jeff Bayer wrote for The Scorecard Review. \"And as entertainment goes, 'Mamma Mia!' belts it out of the park.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actress was in \"Don't Look Up\" (2021).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 55%\n\nSummary: In \"Don't Look Up,\" Kate Dibiasky (Jennifer Lawrence) and her professor, Dr. Randall Mindy (Leonardo DiCaprio), discover a comet that's going to crash into Earth. But they can't seem to get anyone else to care about the impending destructing, especially not President Orlean (Streep).\n\nCritics enjoyed the talent of the star-studded cast, but others felt the film missed the mark a little.\n\nBecca James wrote for the Chicago Reader, \"The Adam McKay film stays true to the writer-director's signature style. It's star-studded, and the edits often wink at the audience, but it's not so fun being in on the joke this time around.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was Susan in \"Plenty\" (1985).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 56%\n\nSummary: In \"Plenty,\" British housewife Susan (Streep) feels a disconnect growing between her and her family as she looks back on her role during World War II in comparison to her contemporary lifestyle.\n\nCritics were relatively split on their consensus of \"Plenty,\" with some calling it an illuminating drama and others discounting it as pretentious.\n\n\"'Plenty' emerges as an absorbing and fastidiously made adaptation of David Hare's acclaimed play, but also comes off as cold and ultimately unaffecting,\" Matt Wolf wrote for Variety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the intense drama \"The River Wild\" (1994), she played Gail.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 57%\n\nSummary: In \"The River Wild,\" white-water rafter Gail (Streep) and her husband Tom (David Strathairn) take their son on a rafting trip for his 10th birthday. But their family trip goes south when a dangerous criminal (Kevin Bacon) commandeers their raft and forces Gail to navigate raging waters.\n\nCritics cited formulaic plotting and lack of originality as the film's shortcomings.\n\nRoger Ebert wrote for the Chicago Sun-Times \"'The River Wild' was constructed from so many ideas, characters and situations recycled from other movies that all the way down the river I kept thinking: Been there. Done that\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actress narrated the documentary \"Stolen Childhoods\" (2005).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 58%\n\nSummary: The documentary \"Stolen Childhoods\" covers global child labor and exposes the cruel and unthinkable positions of children around the globe. The project was narrated by Streep.\n\nThe subject of the documentary was eye-opening for some, but some critics felt like the project itself was perfunctory instead of compelling.\n\n\"At times, 'Stolen' feels more like a fundraising tool than a theatrical release, but it's still an effective call to action,\" a critic wrote for E!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actress played opposite Nicholson again in \"Ironweed\" (1987).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 58%\n\nSummary: Set during the Great Depression in the 1930s, \"Ironweed\" centers on Francis Phelan (Nicholson), a retired athlete estranged from his family. While coming to terms with his past, Francis seeks solace from his girlfriend Helen (Streep).\n\n\"Ironweed\" was received as a powerfully rendered, but awfully bleak, period drama.\n\nDesson Thomson wrote for The Washington Post, \"'Ironweed' is decent fare, not excellent.
