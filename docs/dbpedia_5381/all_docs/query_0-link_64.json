        "text": "When Barbra Streisand left her Brooklyn, New York home at 16, she was determined to hit the stage as an actress. With no permanent home at first, Streisand lived with friends and slept on an army cot she carried around before moving into a small apartment in the Theater District in Manhattan. Taking on whatever jobs she could find, Streisand eventually landed a weekly gig singing as an opening act for late comedian Phyllis Diller for $125 a week.\n\n“I knew it since I was 7 years old,” said Streisand of her destiny in an interview with 60 Minutes in 1991. “It just had to be. There was no other way for me.”\n\nBy 1963, Streisand appeared on the Judy Garland Show for their duet “Happy Days Are Here Again/Get Happy” and released her debut album The Barbra Streisand Album, which received five Grammy nominations and won two: Album of the Year and Best Female Vocal Performance. Just five years later, Streisand starred in her first of nearly 20, Funny Girl, and picked up the Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\nIn the years that followed, Streisand also starred in Hello, Dolly! (1969), What’s Up, Doc? (1972), and The Way We Were (1973) before writing and producing several songs on the soundtrack for A Star is Born, which earned her another Oscar.\n\nBy the early ’80s, Streisand starred in, co-written, co-produced, and directed the 1983 film Yentl, and went on to direct the 1991 Oscar-nominated drama The Prince of Tides and The Mirror Has Two Faces in 1996.\n\nThroughout her career, Streisand has released 36 albums, 11 which topped the Billboard 200, including People (1964), The Way We Were (1974), Guilty (1980), and The Broadway Album (1985), along with hits “The Way We Were,” “Evergreen,” “You Don’t Bring Me Flowers,” “No More Tears (Enough Is Enough),” and “Woman in Love,” which all went to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\n[RELATED: Top 10 Barbra Streisand Songs]\n\nIn a career spanning more than 60 years, Streisand also had a hand in writing a number of her songs. Here’s a look behind just five songs Streisand wrote from the mid-1970s through the ’90s.\n\n1. “By the Way” (1975)\n\nWritten by Barbra Streisand and Rupert Holmes\n\nStreisand’s 17th release Lazy Afternoon features covers of Stevie Wonder‘s “You and I,” Libby Holman’s “Moanin’ Low,” and the Four Tops’ “Shake Me, Wake Me (When It’s Over).” On the album, she also co-wrote one song, “By the Way,” marking her first songwriting credit.\n\nBy the way, did I hear you say\n\nIf some night, I seem too lonely\n\nYou would stay\n\nOh, and by the way\n\nHave I told you yet that only recently\n\nHe moved out on me\n\nTook the towels we stole\n\nFrom some motel in Tennessee\n\nHe was gone long before he really left\n\nI knew it\n\nBy the way, he began to say\n\nLove takes time, I’m in a hurry\n\nAnyway, that’s all yesterday\n\nLet’s get back to us\n\nWhy worry?\n\n2. “Lost Inside of You” (1976)\n\nWritten by Leon Russell and Barbra Streisand\n\nThe soundtrack for A Star is Born featured two songs co-written by Streisand who also produced the album with Phil Ramone. Comparable to Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga‘s “Shallow” from the 2018 A Star is Born remake, “Lost Inside of You” reveals the intense and rocky love between Kris Kristofferson, who plays rock star John Norman Howard, and Streisand’s Esther in the 1976 version. The film was based on the original 1937 movie starring Janet Gaynor and Fredric March, which was later adapted into a musical with Judy Garland and James Mason in 1954.\n\nTime has come again\n\nAnd love is in the wind\n\nLike some music in a dream\n\nYou made them all come true\n\nWhen you came inside of my life\n\nNow I’m lost\n\nInside of you\n\nLost in the music\n\nAnd lost in your eyes\n\n3. “Evergreen” (1976)\n\nWritten by Barbra Streisand and Paul Williams\n\nCo-written with Paul Williams and sung as a duet with Kristofferson, the love theme from A Star is Born, “Evergreen” marked Streisand’s second No. 1 song on the Billboard Hot 100, following “The Way We Were” in 1974.\n\n[RELATED: 5 Songs You Didn’t Know Kris Kristofferson Wrote for Other Artists, First]\n\n“She sat down and played on a guitar, the melody for ‘Evergreen’ that she’d written,” said Williams in 2007 of working on “Evergreen” with Streisand. “It was just such a beautiful melody. I said, ‘There’s your love song. There’s the big love song.’ I asked her for the melody. She put it on tape for me, and I took it home. I actually wrote that as the last thing, which I think bothered her. But all the Kris Kristofferson stuff was the first thing up on the shoot schedule. So I wrote the songs for Kris first.”\n\nWilliams added, “I actually wrote those first two lines in the opposite order. I wrote ‘Love, fresh as the morning air, love soft as an easy chair.’ I called Barbra as I was getting on a plane to go on tour with Olivia Newton-John. … I called her and said, ‘You know what, flip those two first lines, because it sings better.’ ‘Love, soft as an easy chair, love, fresh as the morning air.’ ‘Morning’ sang better at that point in the song. And I remember saying to Barbra, ‘They’ll probably laugh us out of the theaters for starting a love song with a line about a chair, but I think it works better that way.’ And I think it was the biggest-selling soundtrack album ever at that time, and of course, the song won the triple crown: the Oscar, the Grammy, and the Golden Globe.”\n\nLove, soft as an easy chair\n\nLove, fresh as the morning air\n\nOne love that is shared by two\n\nI have found with you\n\nLike a rose under the April snow\n\nI was always certain love would grow\n\nLove ageless and evergreen\n\nSeldom seen by two\n\nYou and I will make each night a first\n\nEvery day a beginning\n\nSpirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed\n\nThey warm and excite us\n\n‘Cause we have the brightest love\n\nThe song earned Streisand her second Academy Award for Best Original Song, making her the first woman to win an Oscar as a composer. “Evergreen” also won a Grammy Award for Song of the Year and a Golden Globe for Best Original Song.\n\n4. “Wet” (1979)\n\nWritten by Barbra Streisand, Sue Sheridan, David Wolfert\n\nStreisand’s 21st album Wet was a semi-concept album centering around water and featured the No. 1 hit “No More Tears (Enough Is Enough),” a duet with late disco singer Donna Summer. The title track, co-written by Streisand, continued the aqueous theme describing the coldness, and wetness, of kisses and tears of love.\n\nWet is rain\n\nRain is clean and new\n\nNew is the morning and morning dew\n\nWet is a kiss that touches you\n\nWet is sea\n\nSea is mysterious blue\n\nBlue is for sadness\n\nAnd sad is for crying\n\nTears are wet too\n\nWould you share these things with me\n\nDance in the rain\n\nDrift with the sea\n\nAnd let the tears fall as they wade\n\n5. “I Finally Found Someone” (1996)\n\nWritten by Barbra Streisand, Bryan Adams, Robert John “Mutt” Lange, Marvin Hamlisch\n\nThe theme song from the 1996 romantic comedy The Mirror Has Two Faces, starring Barbra Streisand, who also directed the film, and Jeff Bridges, “I Finally Found Someone” went to No. 2 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart and No. 8 on the Hot 100. Performed as a duet between Streisand and co-writer Bryan Adams, and arranged by David Foster, the song plays over the closing credits of the film.\n\n“I wrote the love theme, the main love theme, then Marvin [Hamlisch]wrote a bridge to it, and that was going to be our song,” said Streisand in 1996. “Then David Foster had the idea that I should sing the duet with Bryan Adams. Bryan played our track and heard me humming and fell in love with this little theme that I wrote and then he and his producer Mutt Lange wrote a counter melody based on the track that I sent him, and they wrote the lyrics.”\n\n[RELATED: 3 Songs You Didn’t Know Jeff Bridges Wrote]\n\nStreisand added, “I don’t think his record company wanted him [Adams] to sing with me, because I’m more traditional, and I haven’t had a hit since I don’t know when.”\n\n“I Finally Found Someone” was Streisand’s first Top 10 hit in nearly a decade and her first gold single since “Guilty,” the title track of her 22nd album, which was written by the Bee Gees‘ Barry, Maurice and Robin Gibbs and earned her a Grammy for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Duo or Group.\n\nI finally found someone\n\nWho knocks me off my feet\n\nI finally found the one\n\nWho makes me feel complete\n\nIt started over coffee\n\nWe started out as friends\n\nIt’s funny how from simple things\n\nThe best things begin\n\nThis time is different la la la la\n\nIt’s all because of you la la la la\n\nIt’s better than it’s ever been\n\n‘Cause we can talk it through\n\nPhoto: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images"
