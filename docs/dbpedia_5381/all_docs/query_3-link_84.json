        "text": "The Talented Mr. Ripley: Spoiler Alert\n\nSharon and I watched The Talented Mr. Ripley. Sharon had heard Matt Damon talking about the film on Rob Lowe's podcast and wanted to rewatch it.\n\nThe Talented Mr. Ripley is a 1999 psychological thriller film written and directed by Anthony Minghella. It is based on Patricia Highsmith's 1955 novel of the same name. It stars Matt Damon. Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett, and Philip Seymour Hoffman also appear in supporting roles.\n\nSet in the 1950s, Tom Ripley (Damon), a charismatic but troubled young man, is sent to Italy to convince Dickie Greenleaf (Law), the spoiled son of a wealthy businessman, to return home. Fascinated by Dickie's glamorous lifestyle, Ripley becomes increasingly obsessed with his target. When Ripley's attempts to befriend Dickie fail, his envy and desperation grow. Ripley kills Greenleaf and assumes his identity.\n\nThe film was a critical and commercial success. It received five Academy Award nominations, including Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor for Law.\n\nI can remember Sharon and I watching the movie when it first came out. In twenty-five years, I had forgotten most of the plot; I thought that movie ended when Ripley killed Greenleaf. Ripley goes on to kill two more people over the course of the movie. Overall, the film holds up better than The Outsiders. Nevertheless, it is not one of my favorite movies.\n\nThe Outsiders\n\nSharon and I watched The Outsiders. After reading Rob Lowe's Stories I Only Tell My Friends, I bought the movie and downloaded it to my iPad. I was intending to watch it on one of our international flights, but never got around to it.\n\nThe Outsiders is a 1983 coming-of-age crime drama film directed by Francis Ford Coppola. The film is an adaptation of the 1967 novel of the same name by S. E. Hinton.\n\nThe film is noted for its cast of up-and-coming stars, including C. Thomas Howell (who garnered a Young Artist Award), Rob Lowe, in his feature film debut, Emilio Estevez, Matt Dillon, Tom Cruise, Patrick Swayze, Ralph Macchio, and Diane Lane. The film helped spark the Brat Pack genre of the 1980s.\n\nThe film's central theme is the divide between the haves and the have-nots. The Greasers, led by the charismatic Ponyboy Curtis (played by C. Thomas Howell), struggle to find their place in a society that often overlooks and dismisses them. Their lives are marked by poverty, violence, and a sense of hopelessness. On the other side, the Socs, enjoy the privileges of wealth and status.\n\nAlthough it is interesting to see a number of major actors at the very beginning of their careers, the movie feels very dated. Rob Lowe talks in his first book about how they cut most of his big scene from the movie. I only recommend the film as a curiosity.\n\nAt Winchester Country Club\n\nHolly, Van, Sharon and I played Winchester on Sunday morning. We teed off at 11:30 am. I have played this course twice before: in 2019 with Sam and Larkin and in 2021 with Sam, Larkin, Sharon, Holly, Van, Donna and Kevin.\n\nIt was a very slow day. We were behind a foursome that was taking their time. It took us 5 hours and 5 minutes; the pace of play is supposed to be 4 hours and 5 minutes. For comparison, when Larkin and I played there in 2019, we were done in 3 hours and 45 minutes...\n\nAt this point, I am really focusing on keeping my hands inside on my backswing. I feel like I am making some progress converting my woodchopping swing into a more traditional golf swing. I had a number of shots that I was very happy with. Unfortunately, I made a mess around the greens, particularly on the front nine. I had trouble with my chipping and three putted five holes on the front nine.\n\nFor the money, the course was disappointing. The fairways were in terrible shape. Texting Sam, he said that the hot weather this summer was really hard on the course.\n\nI ended up with a liberally scored 109. I shot a 108 in 2019 and a 105 in 2021.\n\nThe four of us finished the day with an early dinner at the Pub at the country club. I had a Tuna Salad Bowl, while Sharon had a French Dip Sandwich.\n\nMoving Day\n\nI spent a long day helping Morgan and Daniel move from their apartment in Placerville to a house that they bought in Pollack Pines. Sharon and I helped them move into the apartment last July. Leaving the house at 8:15 am, I wasn't back home until 7:15 pm.\n\nThe load included an upright piano, a range, a washer, a dryer and a giant toolbox. The upright piano was a beast to move with just Daniel and me!\n\nThe Wingmen: The Unlikely, Unusual, Unbreakable Friendship Between John Glenn and Ted Williams\n\nMy book for August was The Wingmen: The Unlikely, Unusual, Unbreakable Friendship Between John Glenn and Ted Williams by Adam Lazarus. Snipes recommend the book when I was in Lake County.\n\nLazarus masterfully weaves together the lives of John Glenn and Ted Williams, revealing the complex individuals behind the public personas. What emerges is a portrait of two men bound by their shared experiences as Marine Corps aviators during the Korean War. The author's meticulous research brings to life the harrowing conditions and intense camaraderie of these young pilots.\n\nBeyond the battlefield, Lazarus delves into the complexities of their post-war lives. While Glenn pursued a career in aviation and politics, Williams grappled with the pressures of fame and the solitude of the baseball diamond. Their paths diverged, yet their friendship endured, a testament to the enduring power of shared experiences.\n\nAlthough i have read books about Mays, DiMaggio, Mantle and Koufax, I haven’t read a book about Ted Williams. He was kind of an asshole. Additionally, I had forgotten about the freezing of his head and body after he died. I enjoyed the book and recommend it. I am going to have to read a separate biography on Ted Williams.\n\nSing Sing\n\nTuesday afternoon, Sharon and I saw Sing Sing at the Tower Theater. This marks the formal kickoff of our effort to see all of the movies that might be nominated for 2025 Oscars. Goldderby currently has Sing Sing with the best odds to win the 2025 Best Picture Oscar.\n\nSing Sing is a drama film directed by Greg Kwedar. He co-wrote the screenplay with Clint Bentley. Based on the real-life Rehabilitation Through the Arts program at Sing Sing Maximum Security Prison, the film centers on a group of inmates involved in the creation of theatrical stage shows through the program.\n\nThe film stars professional actors Colman Domingo and Paul Raci. It includes many real-life formerly incarcerated men who were themselves alumni of the program during their incarceration, including Clarence \"Divine Eye\" Maclin and Sean San José. Colman Domingo received a Best Actor nomination for his role in last year's Rustin.\n\nWalking out of the theater, Sharon said \"I give the movie a '10'; it is the movie that I will be measuring all other movies against this year.\" The film is very good. I recommend it.\n\nGolftec\n\nI had a Golftec lesson on Monday morning. Although I have been debating whether I want to stick with lessons at Golftec or go in a different direction, I decided to buy a large package of lessons. Their approach of visually comparing your swing to a pro's swing works for my brain. The struggle is my swing continues to be too vertical. Intellectually, I know what I am doing wrong. I am just having trouble changing fifty years of muscle memory...\n\nBouchaine Vineyards Coastal in Carneros\n\nCOASTAL IN CARNEROS\n\nAugust 18, 2024 | 2:00PM - 5:00PM PDT\n\nSpend an unforgettable afternoon immersed in the serene beauty of Olive Hill, our beautiful Carneros olive grove, just a mile from Bouchaine.\n\nIndulge your senses with nature's delicacies – the briny allure of freshly shucked oysters and the exquisite richness of caviar.\n\nSip Bouchaine's top scoring wines and savor small bites crafted by Napa Native Chef Aaron Meneghelli.\n\nEnjoy a leisurely stroll through our picturesque olive grove, where every step is a moment of tranquility.\n\nTaking off about 11:30 am, Sharon and I headed to Napa for Bouchaine's Coastal in Carneros event. I drove. It was a slog. It was stop and go traffic from West Sacramento all way to Fairfield.\n\nWe made a quick stop at the Outlets in Napa. Sharon wanted to go to the Cabi store.\n\nFrom there, we headed to Bouchaine's Olive Hill property for the event. We have been wine club members at Bouchaine Vineyards since 2010. Bouchaine Vineyards bought the property in 2020; it is the largest olive orchard in Napa County. The property has some gorgeous views of the Napa Valley and the San Pablo Bay.\n\nAlthough a little windy, it was a nice afternoon with temperatures in the 80s. We both enjoyed the Alsatian white: a blend of Pinot Gris, floral Gewurztraminer, plush Pinot Blanc, and linear Riesling.\n\nWe rolled towards home about 4:30 pm. Sharon drove. I was shocked out light the traffic was. With a stop for gas, we were back in Carmichael in less than an hour and a half.\n\nAncil Hoffman\n\nDebbie, Jim, Sharon and I played golf at Ancil Hoffman on Thursday afternoon. Teeing off at 3:32 pm, we played the front nine.\n\nFor the second time in a row, I parred the first hole. Striking the ball pretty well, I got into trouble in the trees on the second and third holes. With a mulligan on the seventh, I was happy with how I played the last six holes. I had a fairly honestly scored 55. Interestingly, I have carded a 55 each of the last three times that we have played nine at Ancil Hoffman.\n\nAfterwards, the four of us had cocktails on the patio at the Main Event.\n\nAdventist Health IT Visit\n\nTo mark my one year of retirement, I reached out to my old boss with a request to come by and say hello. I stopped by the Adventist Health building at lunchtime today just as the IT leadership Meeting was ending. I got a chance to touch base with a number of people. Afterwards, I went to lunch with Bill, Kevin and Tiffany.\n\nI was surprised at how few cars were parked around the building. It seems like there still aren't that many people coming into the office. I wouldn't be who I am today if I spent my career working remotely.\n\nOutlander - Season One\n\nSharon and I finished watching the first season of Outlander. It has taken us more than six months to work our way through the first season..\n\nOutlander is a historical drama based on the Outlander novel series by Diana Gabaldon. Developed by Ronald D. Moore, the show premiered on August 9, 2014, on Starz. The 16-episode first season of the television series (released as two half-seasons) is based on the first novel in the series, Outlander.\n\nIt stars Caitríona Balfe as Claire Randall, a former World War II military nurse in Scotland who, in 1945, finds herself transported back in time to 1743. There she encounters, falls in love with and marries a dashing Highland warrior named Jamie Fraser (Sam Heughan). Claire becomes embroiled in the Jacobite rising. The supporting cast includes Tobias Menzies as Frank Randall and Jonathan \"Black Jack\" Randall.\n\nOutlander excels in its historical accuracy and world-building. The attention to detail in costumes, sets, and dialect is impressive. The series is immersed in a world of rugged highlands, clan rivalries and British tyranny.\n\nSharon's brother Tom described the series as Scottish softcore porn. Having spent two plus weeks in Scotland last year, I enjoyed the scenery. When we were there, we also learned a lot about Jacobite rebellion, including visiting the Culloden Battlefield. I am not a fan of time travel, but I give the first season a lukewarm thumbs up. We have started season two.\n\nThe Garage\n\nI love our house, but I don't love the garage. In the twelve plus years that we have lived here, we have never been able to park two cars in the garage. It is a very small garage...\n\nOne of my retirement goals was to completely reorganize the garage so that we could park two cars in it. Over the last several months, we have purchased some cabinets, hung the bikes from the ceiling, mounted a couple of racks on the walls and took a number of things to the dump.\n\nAs of last Sunday, the project is \"finished.\" Although it is a tight fit, we can park both cars in the garage!\n\n2025 Oscar Favorites\n\nGold Derby predictions as of July 18, 2024\n\nBEST PICTURE\n\n1. ✔ Sing Sing\n\n2. ✔ Dune: Part Two\n\n3.
