        "text": "Colleen Hoover's bestselling novel \"It Ends With Us\" is coming to the big screen.\n\nSet to hit theaters Aug. 9, the adaptation will see Blake Lively bring to life one of Hoover's most memorable characters, Lily Bloom, who grapples with the cyclical nature of domestic violence.\n\nThe novel, which is inspired by Hoover's own parents, was first published in 2016 but became a staple recommendation on BookTok, the bookish corner of TikTok, during the COVID-19 pandemic. As of June 14, the book has spent 157 weeks on the New York Times' paperback trade fiction bestseller list.\n\nBut the book and its film adaptation has not gone without controversy, ranging from the subject matter to the casting choices.\n\nLively recently aimed to ease any concerns the book's fans may have in an interview with \"Entertainment Tonight\" at Hoover's annual event, Book Bonanza 2024.\n\n\"Some people will always like a book better than a movie and some people like a movie better than the book, but I think that we just did our best to honor the book and honor the fans, and, I think, really make something that works even by itself,‚Äù Lively said.\n\nRead on to learn all about the film, including who makes up the cast, details on Hoover's book and when the film is being released.\n\nSee the official trailer for 'It Ends With Us'\n\nThe official trailer for ‚ÄúIt Ends With Us‚Äù premiered May 16.\n\nIn the trailer for the film adaptation of Colleen Hoover‚Äôs bestselling novel, viewers see the heartbreaking love story between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni‚Äôs characters, Lily Bloom and Ryle Kincaid. In the beginning of the clip, the couple appears to be very much in love, but then Lily ‚Äúbegins to see sides of Ryle that remind her of her parents‚Äô relationship,‚Äù according to the video description.\n\nAt one point in the trailer, Lily wakes up and asks Ryle what happened to her. After telling her she ‚Äútripped,‚Äù Lily then looks at herself in the mirror to see bruises on her body. In another scene, she appears to be talking to Ryle and asks him what he would do if his daughter ever told him that she was being hurt by the man she loves.\n\nThe trailer also shows Lily running into her old love interest, Atlas Corrigan, played by Brandon Sklenar. The two characters are also seen embracing each other later in another scene.\n\nThe nearly three-minute video, which is set to Taylor Swift‚Äôs song ‚ÄúMy Tears Ricochet‚Äù from her 2020 album ‚ÄúFolklore,‚Äù was received well by fans.\n\nIn the comments section of the YouTube video, one person wrote, ‚ÄúOH MY GOSH I CANT WAIT!!! It looks so good.‚Äù\n\nAnother said, ‚ÄúI AM BLOWN AWAY..BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR SO LONG..I LOVE THE BOOK.. CANT WAIT FOR THE MOVIEü•π.‚Äù\n\nA third wrote, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm stoked.‚Äù\n\nOnstage at Book Bonanza 2024, Lively said \"My Tears Ricochet\" fit with the themes of \"It Ends With Us\" because both the song and the book come from personal experiences with universal appeal.\n\n\"Colleen is able to tell something that's deeply personal and intimate but is able to resonate with so many people, and Taylor (Swift) is such an incredible writer. She writes from such personal experiences and vulnerabilities,\" Lively said. \"...I think that them together made a lot of sense.\"\n\nWho has been cast in 'It Ends With Us'?\n\nLively, the 36-year-old former \"Gossip Girl\" star, portrays Lily in the film. In the book, Lily is a 23-year-old floral shop owner who falls in love with 30-year-old neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid.\n\nHoover discussed her surprise with Lively's casting during a panel at Book Bonanza in Grapevine, Texas, in 2023, as she has been a longtime fan of the actor.\n\n\"I didn‚Äôt believe it ‚Ä¶ I have been obsessed with Blake Lively since 'Gossip Girl' days ‚Äî I‚Äôm just a huge fan of hers, and of course of her husband,\" she said, referring to Lively's husband, Ryan Reynolds.\n\nBaldoni, 40, directs the film and plays Ryle. As for Lily's other love interest, \"Yellowstone\" spinoff \"1923\" star Sklenar will portray her childhood crush, Atlas.\n\n\"SNL\" alum Jenny Slate will appear as Ryle's sister Allysa Kincaid, and comedian Hasan Minhaj will play Marshall, Allysa's husband, according to Deadline.\n\nOn Jan. 12, 2024, Lively and Baldoni were spotted out and about filming the upcoming movie. Photos from the Jersey City set preview a passionate kiss scene between their characters. In one pic, the actors appear to talk in public, with distressed expressions.\n\nIn another, Lively holds Baldoni‚Äôs face close to hers. The pair also share a kiss.\n\nThen in another set of photos, Lively, with fiery red hair, pushes a child in a swing.\n\nWhat is 'It Ends With Us' about?\n\n\"It Ends With Us\" took off as a TikTok sensation during the pandemic, and videos posted under the #itendswithus tag on the app have since accumulated more than 3 billion views.\n\nHoover's books are also among the most popular on the planet ‚Äî in 2022, she sold more than 8.6 million print copies of her books, according to Circana Bookscan.\n\n\"It Ends With Us\" centers around the love story between Lily and Ryle, and deals with themes of domestic violence and the cycle of violence.\n\nLily grew up with an abusive father and Ryle becomes violent during their marriage, but a surprise encounter with Atlas, years after she had last seen him, offers her a potential escape.\n\nHoover told TODAY's Jenna Bush Hager in 2023 the story was inspired, in part, by her mother and biological father.\n\n\"One of my earliest memories was him throwing a TV at her,\" she said. \"We grew up in an abusive household up to that point.\"\n\nHoover's mother divorced her father when she was 2, Hoover said. \"From then on, I just remember growing up with a mother who was so strong and independent,\" she added.\n\nHoover‚Äôs dedicated fan base, known as CoHorts, are devoted to the book, as it was written. But critics of the novel have said the book glorifies domestic violence, while others argued Hoover shouldn‚Äôt have written about domestic violence at all.\n\nHoover told Jenna in 2023 her readers‚Äô stories outweigh any criticism.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been very heartwarming to read how much the book has helped people, and that my mother‚Äôs story has actually given strength to other women to be able to leave their situations. It‚Äôs a wonderful thing that I‚Äôm excited to see on the screen. I also hope that it has the same effect that the book has had,‚Äù Hoover said of the upcoming film.\n\nWhy are the characters' ages and costumes controversial?\n\nThe criticism doesn‚Äôt end with the content of the book. When the \"It Ends With Us\" casting was announced, devoted fans were quick to point out that Lively's and Baldoni's ages don't match up with the ages of the characters in the book.\n\nSpeaking at Book Bonanza in 2023, Hoover addressed the age discrepancy ‚Äî and explained that she was able to correct a mistake she had made while writing the book.\n\n\"Back when I wrote 'It Ends With Us,' the new adult (genre) was very popular. You were writing college-age characters. That‚Äôs what I was contracted to do. I made Lily very young. I didn‚Äôt know that neurosurgeons went to school for 50 years. There‚Äôs not a 20-something neurosurgeon,\" she said.\n\n\"As I started making this movie, I‚Äôm like, we need to age them out, because I messed up,\" she added. \"So that‚Äôs my fault.\"\n\nAnd as paparazzi photos began to hit the internet when the movie started filming in Hoboken, New Jersey, in 2023, CoHorts did not appear to love the outfits Lively was seen in.\n\nAt Book Bonanza, Hoover said she \"loves\" the conversation the photos generated because it means that everyone \"cares.\"\n\n\"I don‚Äôt remember describing outfits at all. I don‚Äôt care what they have on. In my head, it‚Äôs about the conversation they‚Äôre having and the story. It‚Äôs the same way in the movie,\" she said.\n\nHoover also asked her fans to have patience, and that she's \"extremely happy\" with the film.\n\n\"You‚Äôve seen a couple of outfits that are completely out of context. I‚Äôm not worried about it,\" she said.\n\nIn June 2024, Lively told \"Entertainment Tonight\" that fans of the book shouldn't be nervous for the film.\n\n‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt know the book, the movie works. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any way that if you read the book and you saw the movie that you wouldn‚Äôt be thrilled. We really worked hard on that,‚Äù Lively said. ‚ÄúI also believe if you saw the movie and then read the book, you wouldn‚Äôt go, ‚ÄòHold on, this isn‚Äôt like (the other).‚Äô You can do either. I think they‚Äôre both really beautiful.‚Äù\n\nHoover also told the outlet that the adaptation's faithfulness to her book means people don't necessarily need to read her book before seeing the film.\n\n‚ÄúReaders tend to always want to read the book first. I completely understand that, but I feel like this adaptation has stayed so true to the book that it‚Äôs actually either or, whatever you prefer. I think that you‚Äôll be happy if you watch the movie and then go into the book or vice versa,\" Hoover said.\n\nWhen does 'It Ends With Us' come out?\n\nThe film was initially supposed to premiere in theaters on Feb. 9, 2024, but Sony has since pushed the premiere date twice. ‚ÄúIt Ends With Us‚Äù has a current release date of Aug. 9, 2024."
