        "text": "Ed Sheeran has penned and recorded a fresh tune for a new festive film by Richard Curtis. Under The Tree will be featured in the animated movie That Christmas, which includes the voice of Succession's Brian Cox as Santa Claus.\n\nThe film will showcase the voices of Killing Eve's Fiona Shaw, ex-Doctor Who Jodie Whittaker, and Love Actually's Bill Nighy, who portray the inhabitants of a delightful Suffolk coastal town that experiences a topsy-turvy Christmas.\n\nCurtis is renowned for his romantic comedies such as Love Actually, Four Weddings And A Funeral, Notting Hill, and About Time, and he adapted the new tale from his children's book series.\n\nLiam Neeson's 'remarkable' gritty new thriller set in rural Ireland that divided critics is now available online\n\nCillian Murphy's top five highest-rated films as new movie scores 100% on Rotten Tomatoes\n\nSheeran revealed that he has been pals with Curtis \"for years\", having previously starred in the fellow Suffolk-based star's music film Yesterday, and they have collaborated on charity projects.\n\nThe 33-year-old singer told PA: \"He came to me two years ago to play me the rough of That Christmas. It was just sketches and voices, but it blew me away.\n\n\"So emotional, yet so funny, like all Richard Curtis movies. I find since having kids, there's a real lack of great animated children's Christmas movies, so I thought this was such an amazing thing to make and put into the world.\n\n\"The scene that we wrote this song for is so heart-breaking, but so real for many people at Christmas, spending it without the ones they love, for so many reasons.\"\n\nThe popstar went on: \"I got to work with my older brother on this. It's a gift to work so closely with my only sibling. It felt so good to create something my children would watch, with their uncle, based in the country they live in.\n\nDaisy Edgar Jones answers 'crazy question' on infamous Met Gala meme of Paul Mescal and ex Phoebe Bridgers\n\nSabrina Carpenter debuts new song with lyrics about lover's ex in another apparent reference to Barry Keoghan\n\n\"I find it mad that there aren't more animated Christmas films for kids, but this is going to become a holiday staple, at least in our household.\"\n\nSheeran has previously provided the music for Peter Jackson's The Hobbit film series, romantic movie The Fault In Our Stars, HBO fantasy series Game Of Thrones and AppleTV+ sports comedy Ted Lasso.\n\nHe also had a festive-themed chart-topper with Sir Elton John, with Merry Christmas, in December 2021 and the two also appeared on that year's Christmas number one Sausage Rolls For Everyone with YouTuber LadBaby.\n\nCurtis said: \"I'm so thrilled to have Ed's beautiful song in our movie. It's a film set in Suffolk... Ed lives in and loves Suffolk and completely understood the pitch and tone of what we were trying to do.\n\n\"We've been friends for many years and especially now that he's a husband and a father it's really lovely to have him play such a key part in this film about love, children and family.\n\nALL THE LATEST ENTERTAINMENT, CULTURE AND CRAIC\n\n\"Even if he wasn't a friend and didn't love Suffolk, how marvellous to have a wonderful new song by one of the greatest British songwriters ever.\"\n\nFor all the latest news straight to your inbox, sign up for our FREE newsletters here.\n\nSheeran, who has two daughters with wife Cherry Seaborn, resides near Framlingham in Suffolk where he was raised. That Christmas will be available on Netflix later this year."
