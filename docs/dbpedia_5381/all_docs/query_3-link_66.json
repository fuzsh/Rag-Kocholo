        "text": "Jiang wen\n\nNew York, I Love You displays different kinds of love and attraction through the eleven different segments included in this anthology. These forms of love are not always pure. For this particular film, the director explores the relationship between a man and his mistress when a third man comes into the picture. As the two men compete through thievery and wordplay, the woman watches. At the end of the scene, the female excitedly believes that her lover has taken off his wedding ring and is ready to move on. The ring falls out of Ben's (the protagonist) hands, which propels the woman to move on. She follows Ben out of the bar.\n\nOn a technical aspect, this segment has initial shots that vary in their creativeness. When setting up the scene, the camera uses close-up shots to see the thief drinking water. Alternatively, the camera uses wider shots to capture the pick pocket stealing, to explain his personality without a verbal introduction. The camera also uses the reflections in the glass to capture the man walking into the bar, instead of focusing on the man walking in himself. When the thief speaks with the woman's boyfriend, (shown in the above figure), the camera has a close up shot on the tension filled handshake, showing that the thief is vastly uncomfortable.\n\nMira Nair\n\nIn this film, the notions of momentary attraction is seen through two people who share very different religions. While doing business, the two people share their religious differences, making jokes about one another, as well as more relaxed religions. It is clear through the facial expressions and joking that they are attracted to one another.\n\nOn a technical aspect, the film uses over the shoulder camera angles to capture the conversation and reaction of the characters. Through these camera angles and body language, it is clear that the duo is innocently flirting. Little smirks and knowing glances follow the innocent comments.\n\nNear the end of this narrative, Natalie Portman's character (Rifka) pulls off her wig. Upon seeing her bald head, the diamond dealer can not handle the physical distance anymore. He closes this distance with an embrace and a kiss on her head. He also tells her that her eyes are hope for men everywhere.\n\nThe camera cuts to the Jewish sector of New York and she is being married. As she is being raised on her chair (and her husband likewise, on the other side of the wall), her face falls at the sight of her husband. The camera cuts to the shop-owner driving and back to Rifka. As she looks over the wall at her husband, his faces changes to that of the shop-keeper. The camera changes back to the shop-owner and upon looking into the pendant that is hanging off his rearview mirror, he sees Rifka in the gem, married to him.\n\nThese shots are very important and telling of the characters because it explains how important religion is to the couple. Each visualizes the other as their partner, but adorned in the religious outfits that they practice themselves.\n\nShunji Iwai\n\nIn this film, a musician communicates with his boss through his boss' assistant, who is tasked with trying to make the artist understand his job. For most of the movie, Orlando Bloom's character (the artist), communicates solely through cell phones and emails. He requests dinner with her and she denies him. In order for him to understand the musical scores he must write, she drops off two books for him to read, which he is not thrilled about. He ventures outside to read, but calls her instead. He also sends her picture messages of where he is standing. In return, he wants a picture of her, but she only sends him photos with the books covering her face.\n\nThroughout the film, the visuals cut to animations that the artist is supposed to be writing music for. They seem rather random, with images such as a with a dragon flying and a brief glimpse at an animated female.\n\nFor most of the film, the camera does not see Camille (boss' assistant) because she speaks with the artist over the phone. The audience also hears her through the voicemail that she leaves. These kinds of audio techniques give Camille a sense of mystery for the audience, which is how the artist feels.\n\nWhen the camera cuts to the artist's apartment, many of the shots are wide. This allows the viewer to realize that he is solitary and mostly alone while he is working. There are obviously no feminine touches or other people coming in and out.\n\nYvan Attal\n\nTwo strangers share a cigarette and the man expresses a moment of attraction between the duo. The woman does not \"feel the flame,\" like the man does, but wants to be left alone. He insists that there may never be another moment shared between the two of them. The female tells him that she is happily married, but the man is concerned because the husband let her go outside by herself, without a light. The female tells him that they are not friends, but he persists, telling her that he believes they really shared something. He tells her that he is at the \"forefront of men who are able to locate a woman's g-spot.\" He shows her how to hold her cigarette, which he compares to her vagina. He explains exactly how he would seduce her and she laughs at him. She then explains she's a hooker and sarcastically tells him she would love to \"feel the flame\" sometime during the week. His facial expressions is one of shock as she walks away.\n\nThis scene was completely shot at night, which could signify the sexual desires and romantic allure that the man felt towards the woman. The only lighting was from shop windows and street lights, creating sensual lighting. Additionally, they were the only people visible, which created an air of romance. Once there was a big reveal, everything changed it is clear that their meeting was no longer romantic.\n\nMany of the camera angles were medium to close up shots, that captured the woman's reactions. Once it was revealed that she was actually a hooker, her facial expressions and laughter made more sense to the viewer.\n\nBrett ratner\n\nUpon entering a pharmacy, the pharmacist tells a teenage boy that he feels bad for his breakup, so that he can take his daughter to prom. Feeling very lucky about this, he thanks the father and picks her up. When he meets her, he realizes that she is in a wheelchair. Regardless, they dance together. At the end of the night, she latches herself onto a tree and demands that he has sex with her. The next morning, it is revealed that she is a method actor and can walk perfectly fine.\n\nThe teenage boy speaks in the film, but also narrates what he is thinking. This omniscient narration allows the audience to really understand what is going on as his thought processes.\n\nThis film brings up the issues with disabilities and how people perceive them. The boys' ex-girlfriend looks at his date with pity and she tells her that she is from Make a Wish. Additionally, everyone at the prom stops and stares when she rolls in, but she takes it in stride, deciding that she still wants to dance (at this point the audience does not know she is not actually disabled). As the couple is leaving the prom, their limo is taken a boy makes a comment that he \"has his own wheels.\"\n\nThe film also makes fun of young lust. In a comical way, the film shows the young man losing his virginity, by having sex with the \"disabled\" female hanging from the tree. The camera focuses on the shaking tree branch, which is making stereotypical fun of the stereotypical sights and sounds that come with two young people having sex for the first time. The camera also focuses on the boy's face, which looks confused and shocked simultaneously.\n\nAllen hughes\n\nThe film cuts back and forth between a male and female, thinking about their date and one night stand.\n\nThe camera makes the audience feel as if they are on the train with female. The movements feel have the fluid up and down, side to side that a train has. The camera also zooms in and focuses on different parts of the female's face and hands.\n\nThe narration in this is omniscient, allowing the audience to hear both the male and female's thought processes. This allows the audience to connect their thoughts with their facial expressions, which are very important in this film. Both characters have a lot of feelings about their one night stand and meeting for their date.\n\nDuring the narration, the scene flashbacks to the sex between the man and woman, invading his thoughts. While he is thinking that he is crazy for walking so far to meet her, he is simultaneously thinking about their previous encounter. This helps portray the mixed emotions that he feels.\n\nThere are also numerous shots of public transportation: cabs and trains that help show how long this journey is taking for both of them. there are montages of the inside of the subway, that convey this length of time.\n\nThe use of music is important because it sets the end of the narration. As the man is deciding whether or not he should leave the bar, the music changes. He opens the door and pauses, just as the female is arriving. At that moment, the music pauses, he makes his final decision to stay, he turns and makes eye contact with her. This style keeps the audience on the edge of their seat, wondering what he will do.\n\nnatalie portman\n\nThis film takes place between a man and a child. The audience is unsure of their relationship, but they do know that her mother restricts her from doing much. She looks on at the children playing, but does not interact with them right away. Women in the park comment on how good of a \"manny\" he is, meaning male nanny. The man's face is confused and hurt, but he goes along with this. The little girl admits to her mother that she had a hotdog, which the man wanted to withhold from her. The man comments that her daughter misses him. The man makes plans to pick her up again the next day. There are montaged scenes of the man dancing on stage and it is revealed that the little girl is his daughter.\n\nMuch of the film is made up of montaged scenes of nature, especially while the little girl is talking about it. This reminds us of childhood innocence. During these scenes, the little girl also asks many questions about nature and relationships, which foreshadows that there isn't complete stability in her life when it comes to the people around her.\n\nA decent portion of the film is shot with a handheld cam. These shots are usually of the aforementioned nature scenes or the scenes with her father. This could symbolize the rocky and confusing relationships in her life.\n\nThe end of the film reveals that the \"manny\" is actually the little girl's father. This is revealed during a montage scene of the man dancing on stage. This is important in terms of narrative.\n\nshekhar kapur\n\nThis film plays with the notion of imagination and reality. This film follows a retired opera singer and the crippled bellhop that helps her. He brings her violets and they chat and drink together.\n\nAt the end of the film, the bellhop falls out the window, the audience is unsure whether or not this is happened in the past or if this is a figment of her imagination. We know that this is not happening in the present because when she peers down after his fall, his body is gone.\n\nDuring this narration, there are many camera shots that are captured through the reflection of a mirror. These images could act as symbolism, stating that these events happened in the past and she is reflecting on him.\n\nThe instrumentals in this film become powerful and on the louder side when the bellhop's nose begins bleeding. It is practically drowning out her words of comfort. When the bellhop leaves and comes again, the music stops, until he compliments her singing. At this moment in the narration, the opera from her past begins playing.\n\nJust as the woman dresses herself in a white shroud with violets, there is a knock on the door. It is unknown as to whether or not she had planned to commit suicide, but she opens the window and then looks at herself with sadness, as if she is planning such.\n\njoshua marston\n\nThis film follows the timeless love between a man and wife that have been together for years. It follows the simple journey to get to the boardwalk and the conversations that take place. It is clear that after many years, there is still love.\n\nDuring the walk, there are many wide-shot scenes of the city and the area around them. The city has become a place of love and a symbol that has grown with the couple.\n\nThroughout the film, the woman nurtures the man, even though he clearly does not want her help. The camera utilizes medium shots to paint a portrait that it is the two of them. They have children, but it is clear that they rely on each other.\n\nThis film also uses long shots to expand on comedic points. When the man is crossing the street, he is dramatically slow because of his age. The camera lingers on him and drags out, as he is making cars stop for him. The camera utilizes this later, when the wife is attempting to make it up the stairs to the boardwalk. There is much lingering that takes p"
