        "text": "By MICHAEL COOPER\n\nt was not quite 6 A.M. and most of West End Avenue still slumbered. Suddenly West 84th Street exploded in song.\n\n''I thought it was someone blasting their car radio,'' recalled Shanti Narra, a Legal Aid lawyer who was roused from her sleep. ''Then I realized it was Barbra Streisand. At first I was annoyed, but my roommate said, 'How often do you get Barbra Streisand singing and dancing down your street?' Somebody yelled out their window, 'Barb, we love you, but not at 6 A.M.!' But when they finished the scene, everybody started clapping.''\n\nTEXT:\n\nBarbra Streisand, on location on the Upper West Side. The spectacle of film crews esconced on city streets no longer has the Halley's Comet feel it once did. But Ms. Streisand's West End shoot provided some particularly knotty logistical problems and some classic New York street theater.\n\nThe limits of civility were tested when dressing-room trailers, film trucks, caterers, generators, cranelike lighting lifts and an unusually large crew of 110 descended upon the stately quietude of West End Avenue, which usually resembles a courtyard behind the buzz of Broadway.\n\nMs. Streisand was filming her next movie, ''The Mirror Has Two Faces,'' at an apartment building at 505 West End Avenue. She plays a Columbia professor and Jeff Bridges is her love interest.\n\nThe early-morning serenade of May 3 was actually a tape played over loudspeakers to help Ms. Streisand and Mr. Bridges kiss, dip and dance their way down West End Avenue in time to the music for the big finale. The next night, the producers went without the helicopter they had planned to use to film an aerial shot to close the movie.\n\nIt was a week of both kvelling and kvetching. Some fans, who shelled out hundreds of dollars to catch Ms. Streisand's last concert and watched it again on HBO, were thrilled to have her on the block. Others found life in a temporary movie set grating, complaining about the glare of the lights, the hum of the generators, the lost parking spaces, the noisy shoots that kept them up all night.\n\nThe production team tried to be accommodating. They gave neighbors 57 soundproofing blankets, blacked out 115 windows from the floodlights, paid money directly to the area's buildings -- especially 505 -- and, when life became unbearable, put up more than a dozen people in hotels like the Plaza.\n\n''It is, unfortunately, a very beautiful New York neighborhood,'' said Gary van der Meer, the film's location manager, who lives three blocks away. ''You couldn't build it on the back lot for a million dollars.''\n\nBut Daniel Pincus said the filming kept him from temple. Mr. Pincus, a cantor who lives on the Upper West Side and drives out to sing in a synagogue on Long Island, knows his parking rules. He said he had found a spot on West 87th Street that looked good from mid-Monday through Thursday. But when he went to pick up his car for a drive to Long Island, where bar mitzvah students awaited, his car was gone.\n\nAfter a $13 cab ride in search of the car and conversations with the police in two precincts, he said, he learned that the Department of Transportation had towed it to 91st Street to make way for the film. When he found his car, it had two parking tickets from the new spot.\n\n''I'm not against film shoots in principle, but they have to be managed to minimize inconvenience,'' Mr. Pincus said.\n\nCouncilwoman Ronnie Eldridge, who represents the area, says there needs to be more oversight on the local level when movies are shot on location. ''The movie companies should be scrutinized,'' said Ms. Eldridge, who said she received a dozen complaints about the Streisand shoot. ''We are inundated with movies here. We had Streisand; we had Mel Gibson. De Niro was here. The generators under people's windows are noisy, and parking is a great problem. Of course, we want the business, but we also have people paying heavy-duty taxes to live here and we need to balance their needs as well.''\n\nBut the city is loath to scare off film companies. Movies are big business in New York. The industry employs 78,000 people, supports 4,000 businesses ranging from caterers to film supply companies and generates about $200 million in tax revenues for the city, said Julianne Cho, a spokeswoman for the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting. The Streisand movie alone generated around $2.1 million in city taxes, she said.\n\nThe shoot and its behind-the-scenes maneuvering showed how neighborhoods and location managers are learning to master the realpolitik of filming in New York. The Streisand team, for example, hired local building supers to keep people from walking through the set. And they paid money to buildings up and down West End Avenue.\n\nGround zero for the shoot -- 505 West End -- won the biggest contract: $2,500 a day. The co-op added a special clause in its contract to protect the lobby's Carrera marble. And when the shoot stretched from its expected 3 days to 12, the building made a total of $30,000, which will just about pay for replacing an old cold water pipe. But the delay -- caused by rainy nights -- wore on the nerves of some tenants. (By coincidence, Ms. Streisand, in her youth, took singing lessons in that very building.)\n\nThe late spring was partly to blame for the delay. The crew traversed the neighborhood earlier in the year, affixing fake foliage to the street's barren trees for a springlike finale. It looked pretty cheesy, by all accounts, so the producers waited for nature to catch up with the calendar. Spring came, followed by lights, cameras and action.\n\nTake followed take, and some neighbors grew restless.\n\n''An apartment house is like a vertical village, with all the range of people one gets in a village,'' said Robert Brand, the co-op president, who helped negotiate the deal. ''There were those who had their hands out and wanted money to not make problems. And there were those who said, 'Put up some soundproof blankets in our apartment and God be with you.' Others went to their country homes.''\n\nThe film's executive producer, Ron Schwary, said: ''A lot of movies say: 'Let's go to Toronto. Let's go to North Carolina.' But Barbra insisted on doing this in New York. And no matter what anyone says, and they might say they don't want the movie filmed here, that same person will walk out of the theater, go up to a friend and say, 'That's my apartment.' ''\n\n(Sometimes New Yorkers do want it both ways. Think of the abuse heaped on Jackie Chan: He filmed ''Rumble in the Bronx'' in Vancouver and got a general Bronx cheer for his mountainous backgrounds.)\n\nSo the sawhorses and traffic cones stopped cars and taxis and passers-by. They did not stop Chris, 14, Juro, 14, Eric, 15 and Kate, 13, who plowed through the set on in-line skates and on foot, much to the crew's dismay.\n\n''Who's Barbra Streisand?'' Kate asked afterward with a shrug. ''I want to see Smashing Pumpkins.''\n\nIt's not necessarily an age thing. Samantha Lasry, 10, knows the lines from ''Funny Girl'' by heart and spent an entire evening doing Streisand impersonations and watching the shoot. But she wasn't unduly starstruck. ''I just saw Mel Gibson filming outside school,'' she said."
