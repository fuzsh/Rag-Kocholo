        "text": "Infinity mirror illusions consist of two parallel mirrors with a light source in between. The mirror in front is a two way mirror, while the mirror in the back is a standard mirror. When installed with lights in between it creates a series of smaller and smaller reflections that appear to be going off into infinity.\n\nIf the mirrors are not perfectly parallel to each other, the infinite reflections will look like they are veering off to one side. While this is an accident most of the time, it can be a really cool variation on this effect!\n\nOne of my favorite adaptations of this is our infinity mirror table. On the bottom we used an acrylic first surface mirror and bent it upwards in the center. This makes it possible for the infinite reflections to be seen from a wider viewing angle. This basically means that you can be across the room and still see the effect.\n\nInfinity mirrors can be used in costumes like the infinity mirror dress and vest that you see on our channel. Since they are costumes, they have acrylic two way mirrors and standard mirrors within them. This makes them more safe and more lightweight. The only tricky part after you get it on is the wiring!\n\nThe bottomless pit mirror illusion utilizes the same infinity mirror technique. Instead of having lights, you can add a vinyl of rocky texture along the edge of the frame! You would illuminate the frame by using a regular lightbulb to really give the illusion that its a tunnel into an underground world. The important thing to remember is that you DO need lighting to make the infinite reflections more visible.\n\nShe faced challenges within herself that she used to help create such beautiful and meaningful art. Within her art, you’ll see extensive use of polka dots. She said that she would see so many dots come to life and surround her that she felt obliterated.\n\nWhen you look at the cylinder object, it can look like a circle or a square. However, when you put a mirror next to it, you will see the opposite shape due to it’s design. If you rotate the object by 180°, you’ll see the shapes flip sides in the real world–but the mirror reflection will do the opposite!\n\nYour Father’s Nose is another viral illusion that is most commonly found in art exhibits and hands on museums. In a regular mirror you see your own face, right? Well, what if you looked into the mirror and saw a face that was half yours, and half someone else’s?\n\nThis installation is made possible by utilizing strips of mirror combined with strips that are NOT mirrored. This is what gives the illusion of the blend of two faces.\n\nA prototype is easy to make but what if you want to actually have this installed in a museum? The answer is simpler than you think.\n\nThe design needs to have a strip of mirror 1″ thick, followed by a strip with no mirror coating. This will go on all the way down the length of the mirror in a striped pattern. Since this cannot be with with a first surface mirror coating and has to be made with a standard mirror coating, a grey backing is applied to keep the coating intact.\n\nTo complete the illusion, two pieces like this are made and then installed facing away from each other. This allows both people to see the illusion simultaneously.\n\nAnother fun take on this type of mirror illusion is replacing the mirror with a low iron beamsplitter mirror. The mirror coating is transparent, so you can see yourself in the reflection as well as the person sitting across from you. Traditionally, two people who are together as a couple would do this to get a look at their future children.\n\nThis crazy forest mirror illusion has been bending people’s minds for years. To set the scene, Kevin Perry placed a standard full length mirror up against a tree in the woods. He starts out facing the mirror so you can’t see his reflection.\n\nPerry then goes off to the side so you can’t see him in the reflection as he approaches the mirror. He goes all the way up to it until you can’t see the frame of the mirror.\n\nThat’s where the magic happens–\n\nHe steps through the mirror and comes out the other side.\n\nHere’s what I think he did:\n\nOnce he gets the frame of the mirror out of the shot, he turns around 180°. Then, he starts walking the opposite direction, still appearing to move forward.\n\nOne place where you can see this illusion in action currently, is installed at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida. You’ll come across it when you board the Hogwarts train! In fact, there are tons of other installations that use beamsplitters this way at universal.\n\nYou may see beamsplitters involved in some of the other Harry Potter rides, or the Fast and Furious ride. The Fast and Furious ride uses a beamsplitter film stretched across a large area. This allows them to project life sized characters right before your eyes!\n\nThe Pepper’s Ghost illusion works by using a highly transparent beamsplitter mirror, also known as a teleprompter mirror. This mirror is 30% reflective, 70% transparent. It is a common misconception that you would want something more reflective.\n\nThe idea of the illusion is to have a piece of glass installed such that it cannot be seen. This means that it is a perfect match for the effect! If you use glass or acrylic two way mirrors, the reflection is much higher which would ruin the illusion.\n\nWhen you angle the mirror and project onto the glass with a TV screen, you can see and image on the face of the glass. For the image to appear as floating or augmented into the scene, the TV background needs to be black. With the screen being black everywhere except where the projection is, it makes the projection really POP. Without this, it would not give you the augmented reality type of feel.\n\nFor on stage magic, this is done by keeping the ghost figure hidden in the dark in another room. When you want them to appear, you cast a light onto the subject and they magically show up on stage! With strategic use of the beamsplitter mirror, angles, and light control, a ghost can appear in plain sight.\n\nThis is one of the first mirror illusions to show up in museums! This works by using a regular mirror that is standing upright.\n\nTo give the illusion that you’re flying, you bisect your body by straddling the middle of the mirror. You then lift your leg, specifically on the side that people are looking at you from.\n\nYour other leg will keep you upright as you stand, but it will look like both feet are off of the ground! Such a fun little exhibit! For a more seamless visual, you could use a glass first surface mirror so there is no gap between the two halves of your body.\n\nThis illusion was also used in the movie Star Wars.\n\nEach car that raced across the sand in the desert of Tatooine had a mirror fixed to the bottom.\n\nWhen a camera was pointed at the car, it saw sand and shadows beneath the car rather than the wheels!\n\nThe true mirror is made using two first surface mirrors. Historically, it is also known as a non-reversing mirror. This is because when you look into a true mirror with a shirt on that has text , you can still read it in the correct orientation!\n\nIt is made by joining two first surface mirrors at roughly a 90° angle. Angled just right, you cannot see the seam between the two mirrors. This gives off the illusion that it is one flat surface!\n\nWhen you look into a true mirror, it optically restores your true image from your mirror image. You can see yourself not just as you look, but as you really are, in real time.\n\nSome people don’t like it because it is not how they see themselves, but wouldn’t you want to know how others see you?\n\nMirror TV’s are a stunning masterpiece that transforms your décor. Finally, there is an elegant solution to hide that big black box on the wall!\n\nAs seen on the DIY Network, Tiny House Nation, He Shed She Shed, Treehouse Masters and more! It utilizes the Dielectric Mirror which is a transparent mirror that goes in front of the TV.\n\nWhen you hold the dielectric mirror up in the air it looks like clear glass. However, when its fully installed, it becomes a mirror on the wall. Then when you turn the TV on, it shows through the mirror.\n\nIt matches the tint and quality of a standard mirror, so it’s easy to see yourself as you get ready. When the TV turns on, you see it through the mirror, just like before. Typically the mirror in the bathroom is larger, which is totally fine!\n\nThis effect is achieved by painting the back of the glass smart mirror back everywhere but where the screen is.\n\nTo give it a futuristic look, it is most often programmed with a black background and white text. This allows the text to “float” on the surface of the mirror.\n\nThrough the years, many have questioned if its worth the investment to get one installed. I’ll be the first to tell you that while it does have a real world function of showing time, it’s really more of a high tech home décor item that you get because you geek out on it.\n\nImagine it now… you’re at a family event and no one breaks out their phone to take a picture. Don’t let the whole event go undocumented!\n\nPut out a photo booth and it suddenly becomes fun to take pictures with friends and family. With how advanced the programming is now you can press a few buttons on the screen and share instantly on Facebook, Instagram and via text message.\n\nTo make one you need an IR Touch Overlay which allows you to control the computer by touching the glass. Without it, you can still make a mirror booth but you may need voice activation to take the picture in that case.\n\nThe camera hides behind the mirror near the top of the photo booth, along with the TV and computer. Most of my clients like to add on printing to their photo booth business as an add on because some people just really like that memento.\n\nCome on, who doesn’t have a grandma that struggles with their phone and technology in general?\n\nThe skinny mirror is a full-length mirror that makes the person standing in front of it look 5-10 pounds lighter. In October, 2015, Belinda shared her business with Shark Tank on TV which turned out to be highly controversial.\n\nWhat was meant to boost self esteem turned into retail stores utilizing the technology to make more sales. When you’re out trying things on and you think you look good, you’re going to buy what they’re selling!\n\nWhile I love the idea of it for at home use, it feels criminal for stores to have them in the dressing room area. While it is no longer on the market, the business owner is open to selling her trademark or company.\n\nThe illusion works by using an acrylic mirror that can be bent slightly to give you a more slim appearance. I am totally a fan of self-actualization and if you could see a thinner you every day, wouldn’t that help you with your fitness goals?\n\nA mirror maze is usually part of a theme park or commonly found in areas with a lot of foot traffic looking to do something touristy.\n\nThe concept behind a house of mirrors is that you can’t tell if you’re walking toward a mirror or an empty space due to the geometry of the mirrors and shape of the room.\n\nTo create your own mirror maze you have to put together a series of triangles. I recommend starting out with a triangle grid like this one, then start to eliminate walls within the triangles to form the maze with one entrance and one exit.\n\nTriangles are often used because it plays tricks with your eyes! Everywhere you look it could be a corner or the edge of a new mirror. I’ve been to some that also add in 3D glasses and laser lights to make it even harder to get out!"
