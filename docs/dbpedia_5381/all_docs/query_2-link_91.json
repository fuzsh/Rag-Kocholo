        "text": "Mobs of rioting thugs have thrown UK towns and cities into chaos following a wave of violent demonstrations.\n\nThe last few days in the UK have left minority communities terrified as riots have engulfed parts of the country following the fatal stabbings in Southport which left Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and nine-year-old Alice Dasilva Aguiar dead.\n\nMisinformation spread online that the suspect was a Muslim refugee, but it later emerged that the suspect charged with the deaths was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents.\n\nIn the wake of the tragic events in Southport, far-right groups have organised dozens of 'hate marches', with many descending into violence and riot police being drafted in to quell out the disorder.\n\nRiots have erupted in Liverpool, Leeds, Belfast and Teesside where ethnic minority communities have been attacked.\n\nTerrorists supporting the EDL have received the bulk of the blame from UK authorities. The EDL is an anti-Muslim group that was founded in 2009 by former BNP member Tommy Robinson - real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon (who says he is no longer a member).\n\nFrom acid throwing to setting hotels filled with families on fire - here's what's been happening since the hate marches began.\n\nRotherham: Hotel set on fire\n\nAround 700 rioters gathered outside Holiday Inn Express to set fire to and hurl bottles, bricks and chairs at the hotel in an anti-immigration riot. The hotel houses those seeking asylum, including children.\n\nSeveral big blazing bins were also put up against a fire exit, though Police had to use extinguishers to control the fire, it raged for a half an hour.\n\nA generator, patches of grass outside and several bins full of cardboard were also set alight. Balaclava and masked men at one stage lay flat on the road to stop a fire engine - which they’d just chased away - returning, according to eyewitness and Mirror reporter Lucy Thornton.\n\nManchester: Black man attacked\n\nOn Saturday, social media footage began circulating showing a Black man attacked by a large group of white men in a Manchester park.\n\nThe incident took place in Piccadilly Gardens. In a video an attacker is seen wrapped in an England flag with another person wearing a mask.\n\nThe victim can be seen knocked to the ground as rioters kick him.\n\nA demonstration organised under the banner of 'Enough is Enough' in the city centre became violent as attendees clashed with counter protesters and police. Fights broke out, a supermarket had to be closed and public transport was brought to a standstill.\n\nLiverpool: 'Muslim man stabbed'\n\nLocal reports say a Muslim man was allegedly stabbed at Blundellsands & Crosby train station in Liverpool on Friday. This was just hours before a far-right riot took place at the Abdullah Quilliam Mosque mosque nearby.\n\nThe incident is being investigated by Merseyside Police. Alongside this, in a video circulating online an Islamic stall offering free Qurans was also allegedly attacked in Liverpool city centre on Saturday.\n\nAlongside this, rioters set a library on fire before trying to prevent firefighters from putting it out. Shops were also broken into, which are claimed to have been targeting ethnic minority shop owners according to locals.\n\nA number of wheelie bins were also set on fire, reports BBC.\n\nMerseyside Police and British Transport Police have been contacted for comment.\n\nHull: Asian taxi driver dragged out of car\n\nFootage appeared online which showed what seemed to be far-right rioters dragging an Asian man out of his car, who is believed to be a taxi driver.\n\nIn the video rioters could be heard screaming racial abuse such as “P**i”, while attacking the vehicle, reported The Independent.\n\nRioters attacked a hotel housing asylum seekers, they also threw bottles and eggs at police trying to tackle the situation. According to Humberside Police, three police officers had been injured with 20 people arrested.\n\nShops in the city centre had also been ransacked with items set on fire.\n\nSunderland: Rocks thrown at Flipino NHS nurses\n\nFilipino nurses on their way to work in a hospital as emergency cover were caught in the Sunderland riot.\n\nThe NHS workers were said to be 'terrified' by the attack on their taxis as rioters threw rocks at them.\n\nThe vehicles were the target of rioters as they set light to a police station following a planned protest linked to the Southport knife attack.\n\n\"They were in two different taxis and had been called in because of the trouble as emergency cover,\" a source told the Mirror. \"They managed to get through but they were obviously fearful about what might happen to them.\" Northumbria Police said eight people were arrested and three police officers were taken to hospital following the disorder on Friday night.\n\nMiddlesborough: Alleged acid attack\n\nLocal reports surfaced online of an 'acid attack' on a Muslim woman in Middlesborough. Community members warned each other in Whatsapp messages which revealed the attacks.\n\nA message read: \"There have been confirmed incidents involving men driving past and throwing unknown liquid at Muslim women.\"\n\nHowever, Cleveland Police said they had not received any formal complaints, but they are aware of the online commentary.\n\nBelfast: Anti-Muslim racist chants\n\nA small group of anti-Islamic protesters gathered in front of City Hall in the city. The group chanted \"Islam Out.\" fireworks were later thrown between the group and anti-racism demonstrators in the city.\n\nVideo footage showed at least one member of the anti-Islam activists was carrying bricks to one location, although it is not known if he threw them.\n\nIn another video shared online, a child is seen shouting \"P*kis out\" while holding her mum's hand, walking and smiling.\n\nBlackburn: Anti immigration riot\n\nA dispersal order was enforced across Blackburn town centre yesterday amid concerns that violence would erupt across the town. Blackburn MP Adnan Hussain urged people to stay away from the protest and echoed concerns about an escalation leading to clashes.\n\nA small anti-immigrant protest lasted for less than half an hour, according to the Lancashire Telegraph. It is understood not more than 10 attended and larger counter protest groups were seen in the area later.\n\nNottingham: Objects thrown\n\nAccording to NottinghamshireLive, both anti-Islam and counter-protesters threw objects at one another. Many of the people involved at the initial protest left and were replaced by people who had no affiliation to either group.\n\nPolice held both groups away from one another during the majority of the protest.\n\nPortsmouth: Scuffle broken up\n\nHundreds of racist anti-immigration protesters were met with anti-racist demonstrators at the steps of the Guildhall today. It is estimated about 300 people gathered for the short protest this morning.\n\nPolice scuffled with protesters as they tried to break up a chase. A group of young black men objected to the presence of the group, some of whom sang English Defence League chants afterward.\n\nStoke-on-Trent: Alleged stabbing\n\nFour men have been arrested in Stoke-on-Trent following disorder in the Staffordshire city. Police denied that there had been a stabbing, countering claims made on social media.\n\nIn a statement, the force said: “There is growing speculation that a stabbing has taken place as a result of the disorder today. We can confirm this information is false and no stabbings have been reported to police or emergency responders, despite videos fuelling speculation on social media.\n\n“We can confirm a man was injured after being hit by a blunt object that was thrown. His injuries are not thought to be serious and he has been taken to hospital for treatment. Four men have been arrested in connection with the disorder and are currently in custody for questioning."
