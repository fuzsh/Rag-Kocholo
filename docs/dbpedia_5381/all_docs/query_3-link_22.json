        "meta_description": "Purchase The Mirror Has Two Faces on digital and stream instantly or download offline. Rose Morgan (Barbra Streisand), who still lives with her mother (Lauren Bacall), is a professor of Romantic Literature who desperately longs for passion in her life. Gregory Larkin (Jeff Bridges) a mathematics professor, has been burned by passionate relationships and longs for a sexless union based on friendship and respect. They're two people with almost nothing in common, but Fate in the form of a personal ad and a meddling sister brings them together. And without physical attraction to complicate matters, Rose and Greg become best friends and soon agree to an unconventional marriage builton intellectual passion instead of sexual heat. But when two people meet, marry, try to remain celibate and then fall in love they realize they are courting chaos. Directed by Streisand and co-starring Pierce Brosnan, George Segal, Mimi Rogers and Brenda Vaccaro, \"The Mirror Has Two Faces\" explores our modern myths of sex and beauty with a brilliant combination of humor and poignancy that makes it \"the year's best romantic comedy\". (Jim Ferguson, Prevue Channel)",
