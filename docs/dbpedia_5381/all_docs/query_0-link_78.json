About this list: Buzzfeed once published a list of all the movies referenced in Gilmore Girls, which was great, but also not entirely correct. Because the person who made the list included movies that weren't actually referenced because they misunderstood dialogue or assumed the reference made was about a movie when it was actually about a book or play of the same title. They also just left some out. I am here to rectify this. If the reference made could be about either a movie or some other art form of the same name (like To Kill a Mockingbird) and it isn't clear which one they're referencing, I included it. If the reference is clearly not about the movie, I didn't include it. Films are listed in the order in which they are originally referenced.",

You know how she gets really serious, like when she saw \"The Way We Were,\" and she couldn't believe that Hubbell was going to leave Katie after she had the baby?\n\nSOOKIE: Oh, I remember. She talked about it for weeks.\n\nLORELAI: \"How could he do that? She was the only one who cared about the blacklisting. She was the only one who thought he could write a novel.\" On and on and on. That's the face she had on today.\n\n5.14\n\nLORELAI: Hey, Luke, it's me. I know I'm not supposed to be calling, but I am not doing really great right now, and - I was just wondering, if, do you remember in \"The Way we Were,\" how Katie and Hubbell broke up because his friends were joking and laughing, and the president had just died, and she yelled at them and he was mad and he was going out to Hollywood, and, I mean, which she hated, and he broke up with her and…\n\n1.13\n\nLORELAI: T-shirts for all the girls because I am the Good Witch of the… hey, aren’t you missing a couple kids?\n\n2.7\n\nRORY: There's a bad draft over there where I usually sit. It's kind of like a big downward gust. It's not exactly 'Toto, we're not in Kansas anymore', but it's still pretty darn uncomfortable, especially when you're just gotten your hair to behave. So can I sit here?\n\n2.19\n\nLORELAI: \"The Wizard of Oz.\"\n\nRORY: \"The Sting.\"\n\nLORELAI: \"Rocky.\"\n\nRORY: \"Crimes and Misdemeanors.\"\n\nLORELAI: \"The Singing Detective.\"\n\nRORY: That was a miniseries.\n\n3.5\n\nLORELAI: Yeah, apparently Dwight's last home was Oz, and not as in 'The Wizard Of.'\n\n3.8\n\nRORY: Wow.\n\nLORELAI: Lions and tigers and bears. . .\n\nRORY: Oh my.\n\n3.17\n\nLORELAI: You checked the Cheshire Cat, the Maiden's Teacup, the Cookie House, the Sugarbear Inn?\n\nMICHEL: Every place that sounds like Glinda the Good Witch threw up, yes  all booked.\n\n3.21\n\nSASHA: Hey, did you ever see \"The Wizard of Oz?\"\n\nJESS: Yes.\n\nSASHA: Remember when they go to the Emerald City and they ring the bell and the guy with the beard stuck his head out and they said that they wanted…\n\n1.14\n\nRORY: Well said, Sister Suffragette.\n\n2.15\n\nLUKE: Collectible plates?\n\nTAYLOR: Isn't that a great idea? Elvis, The Beatles, Mary Poppins, all the greats. You can hang them on the wall or you buy a little stand and set them up on the coffee table.\n\n3.18\n\nRORY: Because you need to be a chimney sweep to sweep a chimney.\n\nLORELAI: Please. If Dick van Dyke can do it, so can Luke.\n\n4.1\n\nLUKE: Look at this place! Look at you. All you need is six dancing penguins and Mary Poppins floating in the corner to bring back two of the worst hours of my childhood.\n\n4.14\n\nEMILY: Just be here and be on time, and get your hair cut. You looked like the bird lady from \"Mary Poppins\" the last time I saw you.\n\n4.15\n\nLORELAI: No, it's just I can easily picture him in his study with his dog and his pipe and his fancy feathered pen, writing [British accent] \"Cheerio, old bean. Have a cup of tea. How's Big Ben? How's the Tower of London, Sister Suffragette? Tuppence a bag.\"\n\n6.13\n\nLORELAI: Well, you know, she didn't say it like that, but she said, [English accent] \"Oh! Dinner…\n\n1.17\n\nRORY: Far, far away from the house, okay?\n\nLORELAI: Hey, it sleeps with the fishes.\n\n2.14\n\nLORELAI: Hm. Or we could sit in the corner - you know, the Mafia table so that no one can come up behind you and whack you with a cannoli.\n\nRORY: Whack you with a cannoli? Oh, because he left the gun and took the cannoli.\n\nLORELAI: You're so my daughter.\n\n2.16\n\nBOBBY: Ah, yes, welcome to Birch Grove. My name is Bobby. I have everything all set for you. Do you have luggage?\n\nLORELAI: Yes, it's in the Luca Brasi mobile out front.\n\n3.1\n\nLORELAI: Saying yes to this lunch with my mother is like saying \"Sounds fun!\" to a ride with Clemenza.\n\n3.11\n\nLORELAI: Do you want me to talk to her? You know, arrange a sit-down?\n\nRORY: No, thanks.\n\nLORELAI: Come on. We'll have it in an Italian restaurant. You'll get up, go to the bathroom and come out shooting, and then I'll send you to Italy.\n\nRORY: Well, I do wanna go to Italy.\n\n4.1\n\nLORELAI: Monday is mani/pedi, facial, haircut, go to the psychic, and stock up for Tuesday, the day of all days - Godfather I, II,…\n\n1.18\n\nRORY: Louis, I think this is the beginning of a wonderful friendship.\n\nTRISTIN: Who's Louis?\n\nRORY: Just think.\n\n4.2\n\nPARIS: I'm going to Yale.\n\nRORY: You're going to Yale.\n\nPARIS: And we're suitemates.\n\nRORY: Of all the gin joints.\n\n4.5\n\n(watched by Lorelai and Luke)\n\nLUKE: Don't worry about it. I haven't seen anything.\n\nLORELAI: People always say that.\n\nLUKE: Well, with me, it's true.\n\nLORELAI: \"Casablanca\"?\n\nLUKE: Nope.\n\nLORELAI: You have never seen \"Casablanca\"? Are you kidding?\n\nLUKE: Just get anything, please.\n\nLORELAI: \"Chinatown\"?\n\nLUKE: Anything at all.\n\nLORELAI: \"Bonnie and Clyde\"?\n\nLUKE: A video game would be nice also.\n\nLORELAI: \"It Happened One Night\"? \"His Girl Friday\"? \"Treasure of the Sierra Madre\"? \"Diner\"?\n\nLUKE: I saw \"Mr. and Mrs. Bridge.\"\n\nLORELAI: Oh. My house, eight o'clock. We have such work to do.\n\n4.10\n\nLORELAI: Yes, well. . .he'll always have Paris.\n\n7.4\n\nLORELAI: We can never see \"Casablanca\" together. I mean I'm very sorry. I don't care how much I love it, but I will not be responsible for ruining \"Casablanca.\"\n\n7.7\n\nCHRISTOPHER: Well it doesn't have to end.
