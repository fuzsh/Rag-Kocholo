        "text": "In THE MIRROR HAS TWO FACES, Rose Morgan, played by Barbara Streisand, longs for passion and romantic love. Her life becomes intertwined with fellow Columbia University professor Gregory Larkin, who theorizes that male-female liaisons should be founded on common goals and companionship rather than physical attraction. Based on this practical approach, he persuades Rose to marry him. The characters find that their personality traits balance each other, and Rose helps Gregory in the classroom. The complications grow, however, when Rose canâ€™t fight her romantic feelings for Gregory anymore. When she undergoes a major change, he is thrown completely off balance and must determine whether companionship is enough for a successful marriage.\n\nThe movie touchingly portrays relationships with all their awkwardness, vulnerability and complexity. Ms. Streisand does a superb job both in front of and behind the camera. Unfortunately, the movie feeds the frequently held belief that finding the right person and falling passionately in love will bring true happiness, rather than basing happiness on a relationship with God. Sex is mentioned throughout the movie, and marriage is, for the most part, portrayed negatively. Negative religious references also are included. Despite these concerns, the movie shows that successful relationships can be based on qualities deeper than physical attraction."
