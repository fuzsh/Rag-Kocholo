        "text": "Glad to finally find a discussion on this. I didn't even know how to describe it to get reasonable search responses on several attempts. Yay for the Apple Community! And Igirl1 for getting a photo of the watch screen and starting this thread.\n\nI have two watches -- a Series 4 and a Series 7, both up to date with Version 10.3. My iphone 14 is running IOS 17.2.1.\n\nIt's only on the Series 7 that the display will randomly show a \"watch-to-watch/watch-to-phone\" motion, two watches moving into a position of being face-to-face. Igirl1's photo shows the first position, side-by-side. The next motion is those two watches moving to be face-to-face. This is then followed by a phone-to-watch motion, which shows the watch moving towards the Iphone's bottom connector, and moving back & forth towards it. Exactly as Igirl1's 2nd photo.\n\nThen it stops. Just prior to the display showing this, the watch vibrates. This has been going on since, I believe, the update in September (whichever one that was, 10.0? 10.1?). Other than the vibration -- I hear no sound. The phone doesn't indicate anything, either. Just the Watch.\n\nAs far as I recall, I'm always wearing the Series 7 watch when it happens. Last night it happened, the phone was next to me on the bed, and I was wearing the watch. Neither one was on a charger. The Watch series 4 was on the bedstand, not on the charger. I don't recall ever seeing this happen on the Series 4 watch. I'm sure it hasn't.\n\nObviously the display is indicating some sort of 'pairing' activity. Or the need to pair. ? Both of my watches are shown in the app. I have the setting on \"automatic\" so that when I take off one watch and put on the other, the phone recognizes which one I'm wearing... usually:\n\nI noticed just the other night that my Apple Series 4 watch--even though I had been wearing it for several hours, apparently was not connected to the phone. That's the first time that has happened, I believe. I went into the app, and saw a message to connect. I didn't need to repair it or anything. I just tapped on the watch in the app and it connected.\n\nThis is telling us SOMETHING! Right? Does everyone who is seeing this own two watches? I think so.\n\nI'm wondering if repairing both watches will eliminate this event.\n\nWeird."
