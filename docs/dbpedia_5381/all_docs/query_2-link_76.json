        "text": "GOOD MORNING: “The Mirror Has Two Faces” shuttered Friday as cinematographer Dante Spinotti, citing the usual “creative differences” with producer-director Barbra Streisand, decided to leave the pic. His departure was also compounded by the flu, I was told. He agreed to return (possibly today) until the company breaks for the holidays this weekend. Spinotti’s impressive credits include the critically acclaimed “Heat,” “The Quick and the Dead,” “Nell,” “The Last of the Mohicans,” etc. He will be replaced by Andrzej Bartkowiak, whose film accomplishments boast “Nuts” (for Streisand), “Speed,” “Jade,” etc. Earlier during “Mirror,” Dudley Moore departed and was replaced by George Segal. Jeff Bridges co-stars with Streisand in the cast, which includes Pierce Brosnan, Mimi Rogers, Brenda Vaccaro and Lauren Bacall. The pic is close to the halfway mark … Jay Leno, who returned to his “Tonight” show Monday after a quick weekend stint entertaining troops about to leave for duty in Bosnia at their base in Italy, told me he will probably go back — to Bosnia. He didn’t use any footage from the trek on Monday’s show, saying that was not the purpose of his trip over there — even though he did a three-hour show in the quick weekend turnaround from Burbank-Italy-Burbank. He was chagrined some press potshots were taken at him. “I didn’t bring any press — or press agents — with me. I went to 50-60 tents to say ‘God bless you’ and ‘good luck.’ I also did a show for 2,500 in a hangar. I didn’t do it for a TV show.” Julie Brown, hostess of the E! Entertainment “Gossip Show,” preceded Leno and cut segs into “The Tonight Show” from Italy on his show Friday. “I thought she did very well,” said Leno. Brown was also back Sunday night for Monday’s “Gossip Show” duties … Meanwhile on Sunday, Bob Hope and his wife, Dolores, taped a one-hour show to air on Armed Forces Radio/TV Services throughout the holidays for troops in and en route to Bosnia — and elsewhere. The Hopes produced the show — at their expense — at NBC with gratis clips also coming in from Hootie & the Blowfish, “The Baywatch” troupe, Boys II Men, Clint Black, Trisha Yearwood, Ahmad Rashad, etc. The Hopes dueted on “Silver Bells,” which Ray Evans and Jay Livingston wrote for him in “Lemon Drop Kid” in 1951. Hope (92), who doesn’t have a holiday show airing on NBC this year , says he’s not traveling overseas “because Dolores hid my suitcase”… Meanwhile, Johnny Grant leaves Thursday to the Bosnia zone to entertain troops through the holidays. It’s his 48th tour supporting our servicemen and -women. And 25th Christmas visit with the troops. Grant, “Mayor of Hollywood,” will be bringing the Hope tape — as well as jokes given to him by Hope. Grant tells me he’ll also tape “Hi, Mom” messages and interviews for TV b’cast as a public service by the Bob Hope/Greater L.A. USO. Johnny has the Army’s Distinguished Civilian Medal for his troop treks. He deserves it.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n‘SOUNDER’ IS MAKING NEW SOUNDS. The touching 1973 pic by producer Robert Radnitz and director Martin Ritt is headed to the legit musical stage. Radnitz says he’s talking to Wynton Marsalis to tune it. Taj Mahal did the movie’s moving score. Radnitz also has bought “Sea Danger,” Philip McFarland’s nonfiction bestseller about the first U.S. Navy mutiny (1842), which was followed by the “trial of the century” and covered by then-newsmen Herman Melville, Richard Henry Dana, James Fenimore Cooper, Nathaniel Hawthorne and Washington Irving. Radnitz gets retro honors at the Santa Barbara fest in March … Frank Mancuso was surprise-honored by his senior management team at the MGM/UA holiday party with a Steuben crystal lion inscribed: “The man who made the lion roar louder than ever”… You’ll really have to read/see “Death of a Salesman” again — after reading the short, short piece by Arthur Miller in the current New Yorker, “In Memoriam,” telling the real-life origin of the story. New Yorker drama critic John Lahr uncovered it in the U. of Texas Arthur Miller Archive while doing research in honor of Miller’s 80th birthday. Miller had written the original at age 17. Read him now at 80 — forever the master … With this issue, the New Yorker also publishes its first year-end fiction issue."
