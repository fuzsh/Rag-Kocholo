        "text": "Taking off from a parking lot to soaring high above the clouds, TOPGUN has been synonymous with aviation excellence for more than 50 years. And the Navy's real \"top guns\" will tell you, they truly are \"not in the business of good enough.\"\n\nIt's like two teams playing against each other. You don't know what that offense is going to do. You don't know what defense you're going to be presented with, either.\n\n- Navy Cmdr. Dustin Peverill\n\nAIC students come from the Navy’s E-2 Hawkeye community and the surface fleet. During training, these students practice what they've learned against the Adversary students and TOPGUN instructors. The AIC course teaches students via simulators how to operate their sensors and seamlessly integrate with the SFTIs to provide them with situational awareness to help guide their airborne tactical decision making. The AIC course is also about nine weeks.\n\nWhat's in the name?\n\nAs you might have noticed, the acronym TOPGUN doesn't match the school's name. In fact, TOPGUN doesn't stand for anything. It was a nickname created by the tactical department of Fighter Squadron 21 when the school was stood up. That department called itself TOPGUN – it even fashioned a TOPGUN sign for the parking lot trailer that served as the original schoolhouse – because it was simply easier to say than U.S. Navy Fighter Weapons School. And the name stuck.\n\nIts location: not in cali anymore\n\nYes, TOPGUN was once in California, but not anymore. The school was founded at Naval Air Station Miramar in San Diego and remained there for several years after the movie \"Top Gun\" came out. However, it was moved in 1996 during the Base Realignment and Closure Program to Naval Air Station Fallon, Nevada, to be integrated into the newly created Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center (now known as the Naval Aviation Warfighting Development Center). As the F/A-18 Hornet's role grew, the aircraft required more airspace and air-to-surface range space for training, and the Fallon Range Training Complex provided that.\n\nMost don't go on to fight the enemy.\n\nIn the movie \"Top Gun,\" the school's graduates quickly were sent on a real-world mission. But that rarely happens in real life. As their mission is to \"train the trainers,\" most TOPGUN graduates go on to weapons schools to provide training and support to the deployable fleet - but they won't deploy again themselves until follow-on tours. \"Their job is to make sure that COs all the way down to the brand new aircrew are trained in the latest tactics developed by TOPGUN,\" Peverill said.\n\nThere's confidence, but not cockiness.\n\nIn the original \"Top Gun\" movie, arrogance was not lacking in any of the characters. But today's instructors say that's far from reality - in fact, it's frowned upon. The school looks for three personality traits in every student and instructor: Credibility, approachability and humility. \"As I teach you, I'm trying to get better, too. So I have to have that humble demeanor in order to make everybody better,\" Peverill said. \"A cocky demeanor just shuts everybody down, and it would be a huge disservice to the school.\" While the cockiness might be a myth, the competitiveness is not!"
