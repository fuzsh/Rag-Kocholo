        "text": "Voronezh Malshevo air base, in southern Russia 100 miles from the border with Ukraine, might be the most important—and most vulnerable—target in Russia.\n\nBut it’s seemingly off of Ukraine’s list of targets for now.\n\nFrom the base, Sukhoi Su-34 fighter-bombers belonging to the Russian air force’s 47th Guards Bomber Aviation Regiment fly daily sorties lobbing powerful glide bombs at Ukrainian troops and civilians from 25 miles away or farther.\n\nThe carnage is staggering. “It takes only minutes for a [Sukhoi] jet to reach the launch area near the border and then return to the base,” Ukrainian analysis group Frontelligence Insight explained. “The large number of jets stationed at the airfield enables the simultaneous deployment of bombs, allowing multiple targets in Ukrainian territory to be engaged at once.”\n\nThe regiment’s dozens of Sukhoi Su-34s—possibly representing around half of Russia’s active fleet of the supersonic, twin-engine fighter-bombers—routinely park out out in the open on the tarmac of the recently renovated base.\n\nThey’re within range of Ukraine’s best deep strike weapon—its American-made Army Tactical Missile System rockets. “Ukraine could potentially incapacitate the entire operational fleet stationed there if permitted to conduct such a strike,” Frontelligence Insight noted.\n\nBut the administration of Pres. Joe Biden hasn’t yet given the Ukrainian government permission to aim the ATACMS at Voronezh Malshevo. And so, for now, the Su-34s at Voronezh Malshevo bomb with near impunity—lobbing a significant percentage of the roughly 100 glide bombs the Russians drop on Ukrainian positions and cities every day, killing soldiers and civilians alike.\n\nTo be clear, Ukrainian forces have other ways of stopping the glide bombers. So far, however, they’re not working on the planes from Voronezh Malshevo.\n\nOne option is to shoot down the bombers before they release their munitions. The problem is that the Ukrainian air force doesn’t have enough of its best U.S.-made Patriot air-defense batteries to protect major cities—to say nothing of extending that protection close enough to the border to intercept the 47th Guards Bomber Aviation Regiment’s Sukhois.\n\nUkraine has just five Patriot batteries in place or on the way. One protects Kyiv. It seems others protect Odesa and Kharkiv. Two additional batteries that Germany and the United States have pledged—but not yet delivered—could safeguard Dnipro and Kryvyi Rih.\n\nUnless and until Ukraine’s allies send a lot more Patriot batteries, don’t expect the Ukrainians to risk one along the northern border between Voronezh Malshevo and Kharkiv.\n\nThe last time the Ukrainian air force hit the road with a mobile Patriot battery, a Russian drone spotted it—and a Russian rocket blew up two of its truck-mounted launchers. “Attempting to ambush these jets [from Voronezh Malshevo] with a Patriot battery in a drone-saturated environment ... poses considerable risks,” Frontelligence Insight pointed out.\n\nLikewise, it would be risky for the Ukrainian air force to deploy its future fleet of ex-European F-16 fighters against the glide bombers. “The glide-bomb sorties will be very challenging to intercept regularly,” analyst Justin Bronk wrote in a new study for the Royal United Services Institute in London.\n\nThe main problem is Russia’s ground-based air defenses, which make it extremely dangerous for Ukrainian warplanes to fly at high altitude practically anywhere in Ukraine—but especially within a hundred miles or so of the front line, well within reach of Russia’s S-400 surface-to-air missile batteries.\n\n“When close to the front lines, Ukrainian pilots will have to fly them at very low altitudes to avoid being detected and shot down,” Bronk wrote. “At such low altitudes, the [F-16s’] missiles start out in dense air with a lot of aerodynamic drag and must climb against gravity to reach the altitudes where their targets are.” That limits their range.\n\nUkraine could always aim long-range strike drones at Voronezh Malshevo. Recent drone strikes on two other Su-34 bases—Kuschevka and Morozovsk, both in Russia around a hundred miles from the eastern front line—have apparently damaged or destroyed several Sukhois.\n\nFor some reason, Voronezh Malshevo hasn’t come under heavy bombardment from drones. It’s possible the same dense Russian air defenses that imperil the F-16s also prevent drones from reaching the Sukhoi base.\n\nWhich brings us back to the ATACMS, still probably the best weapons for hitting Voronezh Malshevo and blunting Russia’s brutal glide-bombing campaign. But Ukraine probably won’t jeopardize future supplies of the rockets by using them against targets the United States doesn’t approve in advance."
