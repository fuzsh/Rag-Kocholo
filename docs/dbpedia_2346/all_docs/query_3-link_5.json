        "meta_description": "Over 300 new sanctions issued across Treasury and StateForeign financial institutions that support Russia’s war economy face greater risk of sanctionsWASHINGTON — As President Biden and Group of Seven (G7) Leaders prepare to meet this week in Italy, the U.S. Department of the Treasury is issuing sweeping new measures guided by G7 commitments to intensify the pressure on Russia for its continued cruel and unprovoked war against Ukraine. Today’s actions ratchet up the risk of secondary sanctions for foreign financial institutions that deal with Russia’s war economy; restrict the ability of Russian military-industrial base to take advantage of certain U.S. software and information technology (IT) services; and, together with the Department of State, target more than 300 individuals and entities both in Russia and outside its borders—including in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, Africa, Central Asia, and the Caribbean—whose products and services enable Russia to sustain its war effort and evade sanctions. “Russia’s war economy is deeply isolated from the international financial system, leaving the Kremlin’s military desperate for access to the outside world,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today’s actions strike at their remaining avenues for international materials and equipment, including their reliance on critical supplies from third countries. We are increasing the risk for financial institutions dealing with Russia’s war economy and eliminating paths for evasion, and diminishing Russia’s ability to benefit from access to foreign technology, equipment, software, and IT services. Every day, Russia continues to mortgage its future to sustain its unjust war of choice against Ukraine.” Treasury is targeting the architecture of Russia’s financial system, which has been reoriented to facilitate investment into its defense industry and acquisition of goods needed to further its aggression against Ukraine. Treasury is also targeting more than a dozen transnational networks laundering gold for a designated Russian gold producer, supporting Russia’s production of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and procuring sensitive and critical items such as materials for Russia’s chemical and biological weapons program, anti-UAV equipment, machine tools, industrial machinery, and microelectronics. Today’s action also takes further steps to limit Russia’s future revenue from liquefied natural gas. The State Department is targeting over 100 entities and individuals engaged in the development of Russia’s future energy, metals, and mining production and export capacity; sanctions evasion and circumvention; and furthering Russia’s ability to wage its war against Ukraine.NEW SECONDARY SANCTIONS RISK On December 22, 2023, President Biden expanded Treasury’s tools to disrupt and degrade Russia’s war machine by authorizing Treasury to impose sanctions on foreign financial institutions for aiding Russia’s military-industrial base. Today, Treasury is broadening the definition of Russia’s military-industrial base to include all persons blocked pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 14024. This means that foreign financial institutions risk being sanctioned for conducting or facilitating significant transactions, or providing any service, involving any person blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024, including designated Russian banks such as VTB Bank Public Joint Stock Company (VTB) and Public Joint Stock Company Sberbank of Russia (Sberbank). This expanded definition reflects Treasury’s assessment that Russia has re-oriented its economy and marshalled all parts of its government toward supporting its reprehensible war effort. Foreign financial institutions face sanctions risk for continuing to facilitate transactions involving Russia’s military-industrial base. Financial institutions should review OFAC’s updated sanctions advisory for practical guidance on how to identify sanctions risks and implement corresponding controls.FOREIGN LOCATIONS OF DESIGNATED RUSSIAN BANKSTo help clarify the risk foreign financial institutions face by conducting or facilitating significant transactions or providing any service involving Russia’s designated banks, OFAC has updated the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List) information for five sanctioned Russian financial institutions, to include the addresses and aliases of their foreign locations. Specifically, OFAC has updated the listings for Promsvyazbank Public Joint Stock Company to include its locations in Beijing, People’s Republic of China (PRC), Bishkek, Kyrgyz Republic, and New Delhi, India; for State Corporation Bank for Development and Foreign Economic Affairs Vnesheconombank to include its locations in Beijing, PRC and Mumbai, India; for Sberbank to include its locations in Beijing, PRC and New Delhi and Mumbai, India; for VTB to include its locations in New Delhi, India, and Beijing and Shanghai, PRC; and for VTB Capital Holdings Closed Joint Stock Company to include its location in Hong Kong, PRC.SOFTWARE AND IT-RELATED SERVICES PROHIBITIONSIn coordination with the U.S. Department of Commerce and in line with G7 efforts to disrupt the Russian military-industrial base’s reliance on foreign IT systems, Treasury has taken steps to restrict the Russian military-industrial base’s access to certain software and IT-related services. To implement this policy, Treasury, in consultation with the Department of State, has issued a new determination under Executive Order (E.O.) 14071, which prohibits the supply to any person in the Russian Federation of (1) IT consultancy and design services; and (2) IT support services and cloud-based services for enterprise management software and design and manufacturing software. The determination will take effect on September 12, 2024. The United States strongly supports the free flow of information and communications globally, and these actions are not intended to disrupt civil society and civil telecommunications.  Despite the new prohibitions, OFAC continues to maintain authorizations for certain telecommunication and internet-related transactions, as well as humanitarian transactions, under General Licenses 6D and 25D, which mitigate the impacts to Russian civil society and protect public access to information communications technology.  RUSSIAN FINANCIAL INFRASTRUCTUREThe Moscow Exchange (MOEX) operates Russia’s largest public trading markets for equity, fixed income, derivative, foreign exchange, and money market products, as well as Russia’s central securities depository and the country’s largest clearing service provider.

Sogaz was also designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the defense and related materiel sector of the Russian Federation economy. SANCTIONS EVASION, CIRCUMVENTION, AND BACKFILLRussia relies on complex transnational supply chains to feed its war machine and enable production of materiel to sustain its war effort. Similar networks also attempt to evade sanctions using convoluted schemes to move money and other valuable goods and assets. Today’s action targets more than a dozen of these types of networks, designating more than 90 individuals and entities across Russia, Belarus, the British Virgin Islands, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, the PRC, Serbia, South Africa, Türkiye, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).  For more information on these targets, please see Annex 1.RUSSIA’S DOMESTIC WAR ECONOMYRussia has transformed into a war economy in which companies across the spectrum of Russian industry contribute to Russia’s war effort. Today’s action reflects the intricate landscape of Russia’s domestic war economy by targeting more than 100 entities that operate or have operated in the defense and related materiel, manufacturing, technology, transportation, or financial services sectors of the Russian Federation economy.For more information on these targets, please see Annex 2.LIMITING RUSSIA’S FUTURE REVENUE FROM LIQUEFIED NATURAL GASGuided by commitments made by President Biden and G7 leaders to limit Russia’s future energy revenues and impede Russia’s development of future energy projects, today Treasury is targeting entities involved in three liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects that Russia hopes to bring online in the future: the Obsky LNG, Arctic LNG 1, and Arctic LNG 3 projects. Today’s action also includes designations of three entities involved in either construction of natural gas-related projects or manufacturing specialized equipment for LNG transportation, as well as the identification of seven under-construction LNG vessels. For more information on these targets, please see Annex 3.ANNEX 1: SANCTIONS EVASION, CIRCUMVENTION, AND BACKFILLAero-HIT NetworkLimited Liability Company Aero-HIT (Aero-HIT) is a Khabarovsk, Russia-based company that has purchased equipment and components to produce several modifications of the Veles multi-rotor first person view strike drone.

        "text": "Over 300 new sanctions issued across Treasury and State\n\nForeign financial institutions that support Russia’s war economy face greater risk of sanctions\n\nWASHINGTON — As President Biden and Group of Seven (G7) Leaders prepare to meet this week in Italy, the U.S. Department of the Treasury is issuing sweeping new measures guided by G7 commitments to intensify the pressure on Russia for its continued cruel and unprovoked war against Ukraine. Today’s actions ratchet up the risk of secondary sanctions for foreign financial institutions that deal with Russia’s war economy; restrict the ability of Russian military-industrial base to take advantage of certain U.S. software and information technology (IT) services; and, together with the Department of State, target more than 300 individuals and entities both in Russia and outside its borders—including in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, Africa, Central Asia, and the Caribbean—whose products and services enable Russia to sustain its war effort and evade sanctions.\n\n“Russia’s war economy is deeply isolated from the international financial system, leaving the Kremlin’s military desperate for access to the outside world,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today’s actions strike at their remaining avenues for international materials and equipment, including their reliance on critical supplies from third countries. We are increasing the risk for financial institutions dealing with Russia’s war economy and eliminating paths for evasion, and diminishing Russia’s ability to benefit from access to foreign technology, equipment, software, and IT services. Every day, Russia continues to mortgage its future to sustain its unjust war of choice against Ukraine.”\n\nTreasury is targeting the architecture of Russia’s financial system, which has been reoriented to facilitate investment into its defense industry and acquisition of goods needed to further its aggression against Ukraine. Treasury is also targeting more than a dozen transnational networks laundering gold for a designated Russian gold producer, supporting Russia’s production of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and procuring sensitive and critical items such as materials for Russia’s chemical and biological weapons program, anti-UAV equipment, machine tools, industrial machinery, and microelectronics. Today’s action also takes further steps to limit Russia’s future revenue from liquefied natural gas.\n\nThe State Department is targeting over 100 entities and individuals engaged in the development of Russia’s future energy, metals, and mining production and export capacity; sanctions evasion and circumvention; and furthering Russia’s ability to wage its war against Ukraine.\n\nNEW SECONDARY SANCTIONS RISK\n\nOn December 22, 2023, President Biden expanded Treasury’s tools to disrupt and degrade Russia’s war machine by authorizing Treasury to impose sanctions on foreign financial institutions for aiding Russia’s military-industrial base. Today, Treasury is broadening the definition of Russia’s military-industrial base to include all persons blocked pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 14024. This means that foreign financial institutions risk being sanctioned for conducting or facilitating significant transactions, or providing any service, involving any person blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024, including designated Russian banks such as VTB Bank Public Joint Stock Company (VTB) and Public Joint Stock Company Sberbank of Russia (Sberbank). This expanded definition reflects Treasury’s assessment that Russia has re-oriented its economy and marshalled all parts of its government toward supporting its reprehensible war effort. Foreign financial institutions face sanctions risk for continuing to facilitate transactions involving Russia’s military-industrial base. Financial institutions should review OFAC’s updated sanctions advisory for practical guidance on how to identify sanctions risks and implement corresponding controls.\n\nFOREIGN LOCATIONS OF DESIGNATED RUSSIAN BANKS\n\nTo help clarify the risk foreign financial institutions face by conducting or facilitating significant transactions or providing any service involving Russia’s designated banks, OFAC has updated the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List) information for five sanctioned Russian financial institutions, to include the addresses and aliases of their foreign locations.\n\nSpecifically, OFAC has updated the listings for Promsvyazbank Public Joint Stock Company to include its locations in Beijing, People’s Republic of China (PRC), Bishkek, Kyrgyz Republic, and New Delhi, India; for State Corporation Bank for Development and Foreign Economic Affairs Vnesheconombank to include its locations in Beijing, PRC and Mumbai, India; for Sberbank to include its locations in Beijing, PRC and New Delhi and Mumbai, India; for VTB to include its locations in New Delhi, India, and Beijing and Shanghai, PRC; and for VTB Capital Holdings Closed Joint Stock Company to include its location in Hong Kong, PRC.\n\nSOFTWARE AND IT-RELATED SERVICES PROHIBITIONS\n\nIn coordination with the U.S. Department of Commerce and in line with G7 efforts to disrupt the Russian military-industrial base’s reliance on foreign IT systems, Treasury has taken steps to restrict the Russian military-industrial base’s access to certain software and IT-related services. To implement this policy, Treasury, in consultation with the Department of State, has issued a new determination under Executive Order (E.O.) 14071, which prohibits the supply to any person in the Russian Federation of (1) IT consultancy and design services; and (2) IT support services and cloud-based services for enterprise management software and design and manufacturing software. The determination will take effect on September 12, 2024.\n\nThe United States strongly supports the free flow of information and communications globally, and these actions are not intended to disrupt civil society and civil telecommunications. Despite the new prohibitions, OFAC continues to maintain authorizations for certain telecommunication and internet-related transactions, as well as humanitarian transactions, under General Licenses 6D and 25D, which mitigate the impacts to Russian civil society and protect public access to information communications technology.\n\nRUSSIAN FINANCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nThe Moscow Exchange (MOEX) operates Russia’s largest public trading markets for equity, fixed income, derivative, foreign exchange, and money market products, as well as Russia’s central securities depository and the country’s largest clearing service provider. U.S.-designated Russian President Vladimir Putin has approved a series of measures to further attract capital through MOEX from both Russian and non-Russian persons from “friendly countries”—expanding opportunities for both Russians and non-Russians to profit from the Kremlin’s war machine by making investments in Russian sovereign debt, Russian corporations, and leading Russian defense entities, including U.S.-designated State Corporation Rostec, Public Joint Stock Company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), Kamaz Publicly Traded Company (Kamaz), Irkut Corporation Joint Stock Company, Uralvagonzavod, and Joint Stock Company Russian Helicopters.\n\nThe National Clearing Center (NCC) is the central counterparty and clearing agent for, and a subsidiary of, MOEX. NCC is supervised by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR).\n\nThe Non-Bank Credit Institution Joint Stock Company National Settlement Depository (NSD) is Russia’s central securities depository and is a subsidiary of MOEX. NSD provides bank account services, registration of over-the-counter trades, and liquidity management services.

The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. For information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to OFAC’s FAQ 897 here. For detailed information on the process to submit a request for removal from an OFAC sanctions list, please click here.\n\nAny persons included on the SDN List pursuant to E.O. 14024 may be subject to additional export restrictions administered by the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS).\n\nFor identifying information on the individuals and entities sanctioned today, click here.\n\n##"
