        "text": "Live in 3 days\n\nA Conversation with Dr. Anthony Fauci, M.D.\n\nAugust 13, 2024 • 10:00 – 11:00 am EDT\n\nLive in 4 days\n\nThe Impossible Live Podcast: Recent developments in North Korea\n\nAugust 14, 2024 • 11:00 – 11:45 am EDT\n\nUpcoming\n\nGaza's Looming Polio Threat—Gaza: The Human Toll\n\nAugust 15, 2024 • 9:00 – 10:00 am EDT\n\nUpcoming\n\nBolstering Data Center Growth, Resilience, and Security\n\nSeptember 4, 2024 • 10:00 – 11:00 am EDT\n\nIntroduction\n\nEfforts to harness the Arctic’s geostrategic potential have long been the ambition of Soviet and Russian leaders. Drawing upon early Russian exploration and Stalin’s “Red Arctic” propaganda, Russian President Vladimir Putin personally identifies with Russia’s Arctic ambitions and seeks to exploit the Arctic narrative of man conquering nature as a distinctive feature of modern Russian nationalism. The Arctic is a pillar of Russia’s return to great power status.\n\nRussia’s military presence in the Arctic seeks to achieve three objectives:\n\nEnhance homeland defense, specifically a forward line of defense against foreign incursion as the Arctic attracts increased international investment;\n\nSecure Russia’s economic future; and\n\nCreate a staging ground to project power, primarily in the North Atlantic.\n\nThe region is essential to Russia’s future economic and military vitality. As a result, substantial budgetary increases have boosted Russian military and economic activity in the Arctic over the course of the past decade. Major projects and infrastructure focus on natural resource development and the protection of its maritime passage, the Northern Sea Route (NSR).\n\nThe NSR extends from the Bering Strait in the east to the Kara Gate in the west, covering approximately 3,500 miles (5,600 kilometers). In recent months, Russia has made several important changes related to the use of the NSR. These include giving Rosatom, Russia’s nuclear agency, bureaucratic control over the route and limiting traffic from foreign warships without a 45-day notification and permission from the Russian government.\n\nRussia views the NSR as an internal waterway, whereas the majority of the international community views it as an international passage. The recent escalation in Russia’s level of control over the NSR is indicative of its ambitions in the Arctic and a warning sign of Russia’s desire to monitor and control economic developments in the region.\n\nRussia’s “Two Arctics”\n\nRussia’s military capabilities are regionalized between the eastern and western halves of its Arctic territory. In Russia’s eastern Arctic, international vessels travel from the Asia-Pacific region through the narrow Bering Straits to enter the NSR. Russia has refurbished airfields, invested in search and rescue, and built radar stations to improve awareness in the air and maritime domains. The deployment of Sopka-2 radar systems on Wrangel Island (300 miles from Alaska) and Cape Schmidt has been essential to improving operational awareness.\n\nSystems in the eastern Arctic create a “protective dome,” securing Russia’s vast Arctic coastline and improving its overall ability to detect and track vessels and aircraft. Sopka-2 radars also control civilian air traffic and provide meteorological data to better inform mariners traversing the NSR. These systems fulfill President Putin’s ambition of significantly enhancing maritime traffic along the NSR while also enhancing Russia’s military presence in the region.\n\nRussia’s military footprint transforms as one moves into the central Arctic region. There, Russia has deployed more sophisticated equipment to defend its air and maritime domains. For example, Kotelny Island and Novaya Zemlya are equipped with air defense systems, such as the Bastion-P and Pantsir-S1 systems. These systems create a complex, layered coastal defense arrangement that secures territory deeper into the central Arctic. Such capabilities bolster Russia’s ability to deny aerial, maritime, or land access to NATO or U.S. forces.\n\nRussia’s western Arctic houses its most advanced defensive capabilities as well as potential offensive capabilities. Remote locations like Alexandra Land are equipped with air, sea, and land capabilities that reinforce Russia’s multilayered maritime and air denial power. The focus of these defenses is to safeguard Russia’s nuclear arsenal and second-strike capabilities commanded by the powerful Northern Fleet.\n\nThe Northern Fleet is based in Severomorsk on the Kola Peninsula in the western Arctic. From there, it has jurisdiction over the northwest region of the country as well as the Arctic Ocean and is tasked with securing Russia’s northern coastline. The fleet boasts Russia’s most advanced Arctic land, air, and naval assets.\n\nRussia’s Arctic Military Posture\n\nRussia’s military posture in the Arctic emphasizes air and maritime early warning and defense, highlighted by the reopening of 50 previously closed Soviet-era military posts. This includes the refurbishment of 13 air bases, 10 radar stations, 20 border outposts, and 10 integrated emergency rescue stations. Russian special forces units are also part of an Arctic Brigade and have deployed to the region for exercises and training.\n\nMost worrisome, Russia has tested new Arctic-based military capabilities such as hypersonic cruise missiles and nuclear-powered undersea drones. Senior U.S. military leaders have expressed growing concern about the prevalence of these Russian cruise missiles in the Arctic and their “avenue of approach” to the United States.\n\nMaritime forces play a significant role in securing Russia’s Arctic domain and protecting vital economic ventures. The guarantor of Russia’s Arctic security is the Northern Fleet. Established in 2014 as an Arctic Strategic Command, the Northern Fleet’s surface and sub-surface assets ensure a robust presence in its western Arctic, securing Russia’s northern coastline and projecting power beyond the Kola Peninsula. In 2017, Russia updated its naval strategy, expressing clear Arctic ambitions and signaling the importance of the Northern Fleet.\n\nThe Northern Fleet protects Russian military assets on the Kola Peninsula. By doing so, Russia can more freely conduct strategic operations and secure its sea-based nuclear forces. The Kola Peninsula boasts capabilities that can defend Arctic territory and project power to the strategic GIUK-N (Greenland, Iceland, and the United Kingdom-Norway) Gap, allowing Russia to severely disrupt NATO’s vital sea lines of communication between North America and Europe. The Northern Fleet not only ensures Russian access to the Arctic Ocean, the North Atlantic, and the GIUK-N Gap but also monitors activity along the NSR.\n\nThe Northern Fleet is composed of nuclear-powered missile and torpedo submarines; missile-carrying and anti-submarine aircraft; surface ships with missiles, aircraft-carrying, and anti-submarine capabilities; coastal troops; combined independent force; the Russian Air Force and Air Defense Force; and the army corps of the Ground Forces.\n\nComplementing the Northern Fleet is the world’s largest nuclear and non-nuclear icebreaker fleet, numbering more than 40 ships. Icebreakers play a crucial role in not only securing Russia’s coastline but also promoting and observing maritime commerce through the NSR. The development of Russia’s icebreaker fleet, whose size is far greater than other Arctic states, including the United States (two), is essential for both Russia’s military posture and economic development plan. The icebreaker fleet epitomizes the duality of Russia’s military presence, clearing passage for military and commercial vessels and serving as a mobile scientific platform when necessary. Some Russian icebreakers are also armed with Kalibr cruise missiles and electronic warfare systems.\n\nAir forces are equally important to securing Russia’s control over its Arctic domain. In recent years, Russia has refurbished Soviet-era air bases and constructed new bases along the NSR. Examples include Rogachevo air base on Novaya Zemlya, Nagurskoye air base on Alexandra Land, and Temp air base on Kotelny Island. Air defense forces and anti-aircraft defense systems are prioritized among new military infrastructure in the Russian Arctic, both onshore and in the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation (AZRF). This includes investments in multilayered air and coastal defense systems, electronic warfare capabilities, and radar systems.\n\nRussia is also returning to Cold War tactics, notably the concept of bastion defense, in which Russia secures strategic territory to ensure its freedom of operation. As Russia exercises its bastion defense, it increasingly expands its range, seeking to establish deep-water control between Svalbard and Norway and secure maritime space toward the GIUK-N gap. It does this through the deployment of highly capable submarines, including the Sierra II class—one of Russia’s most capable fast-attack submarines.\n\nArctic Exercises\n\nThe increased operational tempo, scale, and testing of nuclear weapons have been distinct characteristics of Russian military exercises in the Arctic over the past four years. Emphasis is placed on short warning time and strategic and tactical mobility. Russia most recently exercised its bastion defense capabilities during its August 2019 Ocean Shield Exercise. While exercising in the Baltic Sea, the Northern Fleet entered the Northern Sea and engaged in live-fire demonstrations in the Norwegian Sea. These efforts demonstrate a clear forward line of defense to secure the GIUK-N gap and block the English Channel. The purpose of these exercises is to display Russia’s ability to project power beyond its Arctic waters and assert maritime control.\n\nIt is important to note that a similar pattern of Russian tactics occurred nearly 10 months prior when Russia seized the Kerch Strait, a narrow artery linking the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, which has effectively closed the Sea of Azov.\n\nThe Northern Fleet’s August 2019 Ocean Shield Exercise took place before or concurrent to the Vostok-18, Tsentr-19, and Grom-19 exercises elsewhere in the Arctic. The Vostok-18 exercise was conducted in September 2018 in eastern Russia and partially in the Bering Sea. It involved a total of 300,000 troops and was the largest military exercise conducted by Russia since 1981, during the Cold War.\n\nTsentr-19 occurred in central Russia in September 2019. The Northern Fleet conducted several exercises in the Arctic which incorporated newly designed Arctic military equipment. Significant military drills also took place between the Arctic archipelagos of Novaya Zemlya and the New Siberian Islands.\n\nGrom-19 was a significant exercise in October 2019 which engaged Russia’s strategic nuclear forces. It included 10 Russian submarines—8 of which were nuclear powered—patrolling the GIUK gap. Grom involved all four of Russia’s naval fleets, 12,000 troops, and the launch of two nuclear warheads in the Barents Sea and several other ballistic missiles.\n\nPulling Back the Ice Curtain\n\nWith the aid of satellite imagery, CSIS highlighted Russia’s two Arctics, traveling east to west, with six specific sites. Analysis of each site helps illuminate Russia’s military posture. By determining the location, purpose, and nature of the equipment and forces Russia has placed in the Arctic, the United States and NATO can improve their combined response and deterrence capabilities to Russia’s increased military posture across the region.\n\nThe satellite imagery also allows for comparison between what the Russian government has announced (base refurbishment, new construction, and equipment upgrades) and what has actually been completed. In some instances, imagery confirms the announcements made by the Russian government, but often the images tell a different story—one of Russia struggling to actualize its Arctic ambitions.\n\nWrangel Island\n\nThe Russian government has repeatedly announced ambitious plans to expand Tiksi air base in central-eastern Russia. This expansion is meant to include a dormitory and administrative buildings, a diesel-run power station, and water and fuel reservoirs—11 new structures in total. The base was designed to receive and operate a regiment of sophisticated S-400 surface-to-air missiles to enhance air defense, which would later be supplemented by radiotechnical regiments that monitor the defended airspace. Tiksi’s completion would represent a fusing of Russia’s military needs and its ambitious economic plans. Dual-use features combine Russian military presence for territorial defense and power projection with capabilities to also address civilian security needs such as search-and-rescue. However, recent satellite imagery does not show evidence of the S-400 systems or the considerable expansion. Russia appears to be significantly behind in its plans for Tiksi or unable to send permanent equipment because other Arctic bases are of higher priority.\n\nDownload a complete analysis of Russia's activity in Tiksi here.\n\nAlexandra Land\n\nIn April 2017, Russia unveiled an Arctic Trefoil military base on Alexandra Land Island in the northeast Barents Sea. It is Russia’s northernmost military outpost and the second of its kind, following the completed Northern Clover on Kotelny. Alexandra Land is also home to the upgraded Nagurskoye air base. Alexandra Land provides air-sea-land capabilities that reinforce Russia’s multilayered maritime and air denial power, safeguard the Kola Peninsula and Northern Fleet headquarters, and assert Russia’s control over the NSR. Alexandra Land’s proximity to the Greenland-Iceland-Norway (GIN) and GIUK gaps could disrupt NATO’s vital sea lines of communication (SLOC) between North America and Europe, hindering U.S. military reinforcement to Europe.\n\nDownload a complete analysis of Russia's activity in Alexandra Land here.\n\nNovaya Zemlya\n\nThe S-400 provides more advanced radar and electronic warfare systems capabilities, which expand the range of Novaya Zemlya’s air defenses. Russia’s deployment of the S-400 system on Rogachevo air base signals the Kremlin’s intent to secure its northwest Arctic territory through bastion defense, protect its most vital military assets on the Kola Peninsula, and plug potential gaps between Nagurskoye air base on Alexandra Land and radar stations on the Kola Peninsula. The S-400 poses a challenge to NATO in the region, potentially complicating freedom of operation in the North Atlantic and Norwegian and Barents Seas by expanding Russia’s defensive capabilities.\n\nDownload a complete analysis of Russia's activity in Rogachevo air base here.\n\nKola Peninsula\n\nThese facilities expand and add depth to Russia’s defense of its most strategic Arctic territory while also securing Russia’s freedom of movement in the maritime and air domains. Neighboring sites, such as the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, which was the site of recent testing of the RS-24 Yars ICBM, add an additional element to Russia’s Arctic military capabilities. The Kola Peninsula and surrounding area are typically at the center of frequent large-scale military exercises practicing bastion defense as well as the testing of Russian intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), which sometimes occurs without prior warning.\n\nDownload a complete analysis of Russia's activity in the Kola Peninsula here.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nMatthew Melino\n\nAssociate Fellow, Europe Program\n\nMatthew Melino is a former associate fellow with the CSIS Europe Program, where he provided research and program support on a range of issues, including developments in the Arctic, security and defense trends in northern Europe, and the evolution of NATO and transatlantic relations.\n\nHeather A.
