        "meta_description": "In 1937, the US Army Air Corps issued a requirement for an interceptor fighter, mainly to defend overseas bomber bases in anticipation of war in Europe and/or the Pacific.  The requirement specified that it use the reliable Allison V-1710 inline engine, have speed in excess of 350 miles an hour, be able to reach 20,000 feet in six minutes, and have heavy cannon armament, as it was known that both the Germans and Japanese were working on cannon-armed fighters.  It was a difficult requirement, and the USAAC was surprised when Bell Aircraft, then virtually unknown in aviation circles, answered with the Bell Model 12, which would eventually become the XP-39 Airacobra.\n\t\n\t   The Airacobra was unconventional from the start.  To lessen drag, the engine was mounted behind the pilot, which was unheard of at the time; the placement of the engine was also due to the Airacobra being built around the T4 37mm cannon, which was larger and hit harder than the 20mm cannon the Axis powers were working on.  Because the cockpit was higher due to the engine, tricycle landing gear was incorporated on the XP-39, the first fighter to do so, and the pilot entered the aircraft through automobile-style doors, complete with windows that rolled down.  The high cockpit gave the pilot superb visibility, but the car doors made it difficult to bail out of the Airacobra.  Because it was intended as a point-defense interceptor, the XP-39’s lack of range was not considered detrimental.  When the first prototype flew in April 1938, it exceeded expectations, making 20,000 feet in five minutes at 390 miles an hour; even when additional armament in the form of wing and cowl machine guns was added to the cannon, the XP-39 showed remarkable manueverability, speed, and climb rate.\n\t\n\t    What could have been one of the best American fighters of World War II was then promptly and irretrievably ruined.  As the German Bf-109 was reported to have a top speed of over 400 mph, which was only barely equaled by the P-38 Lightning, the USAAC ordered Bell to delete the drag-inducing turbocharger to try and gain more speed; in any case, turbochargers were in short supply and desperately needed for B-17 production.  As a result, the production P-39A had only a supercharger, which was ineffective above 12,000 feet.  To make matters worse, the USAAC also required that the P-39 be equipped with self-sealing fuel tanks and heavy armor for the pilot, and that its range be increased, which required the fitting of a drop tank.  All these increased the Airacobra’s weight, further degrading its performance.   It was inferior to the P-38 and P-40 Warhawk, and Bell Aircraft was stuck with a fighter that no one wanted.  The British ordered a batch of Airacobra Is, and quickly wished they had not.  \n\t\n\tThe British cancelled further orders of Airacobras, which proved to be a moot point, as the USAAF now seized the remainder of the British order—after the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, it was the United States that now desperately needed fighters.  The P-39 in USAAF service was deployed to the Southwest Pacific, where it proved to be a good ground-attack aircraft in New Guinea and Guadalcanal; against the A6M Zero, however, the P-39 was in trouble, as it could not outrun or outmaneuver the more nimble Japanese fighter. P-39s were replaced by P-40s as soon as possible.\n\t\n\t   It would be the Soviet Union that would, at least, partially save the P-39.  Once more, the Airacobra only made it to the front lines because of desperation: the Soviet Air Force (V-VS) had been devastated by the Luftwaffe in the opening months of the German invasion of 1941, and Soviet factory output could not make good the losses.  The P-39 was available in large numbers and it was free through Lend-Lease, so the V-VS took as many as could be ferried from East Base in Great Falls, MT to Siberia.  \n\t\n\tIn Soviet hands, the P-39 was to find its niche: since most combat on the Eastern Front took place below 12,000 feet (both the V-VS and the Luftwaffe primarily concerned with supporting their respective armies), the lack of the turbocharger was not a problem for Soviet pilots. While the 37mm only had thirty rounds and still jammed too often, one hit would destroy any German fighter and cripple a German bomber—to say nothing of what it would do to tanks or vehicles.  Not only did the P-39 do well over the Russian Front, it was exceptional: of the three highest scoring Soviet aces of World War II, two of them—Aleksandr Pokryshkin and Grigoriy Rechkalov—flew P-39s.  So beloved was the aircraft that the Soviet Union acquired 4719 of the 9584 produced, and referred to it as the Cobrastochka—“Dear Little Cobra.” \n\t \n\t  At war’s end, however, even the Soviet Union quickly retired their P-39s.  In the United States, the P-39 had been superseded by the P-63 Kingcobra (which was slightly improved), and these in turn were also replaced by newer designs.  By 1947, only Italy was still flying P-39s, and these were gone by 1951.  Today, only 18 Airacobras are known to survive, four in flyable condition.\n\t\n\tNot much can be found about this particular P-39, 42-8740.  According to the Yanks Air Museum, this aircraft was originally part of a British order for Airacobras and was delivered to the RAF, but it was found in New Guinea.  As all the delivered P-39s that went to the RAF in Great Britain were later passed on to the USSR, 42-8740 was probably originally ordered by the British, then diverted to the USAAF after Pearl Harbor.  Which unit it served with in the Southwest Pacific is unknown, but it was abandoned, along with several other Airacobras, at Tadji Airfield in New Guinea.  42-8740 was recovered in 1991 by Yanks and amazingly, restored to flying condition by 2002.\n\t\n\tThough it lacks unit markings, 42-8740 is painted in standard USAAF camouflage and carries the 1942-era national insignia.
