        "text": "June 10, 2023 - Ottawa, Canada - Global Affairs Canada\n\nThe Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Foreign Affairs, today announced that the Government of Canada had ordered the seizure of a Russian-registered cargo aircraft currently grounded at Toronto Pearson Airport, pursuant to the Special Economic Measures Act.\n\nThe targeted Russian aircraft, an Antonov 124, is believed to be owned by a subsidiary of Volga-Dnepr Airlines LLC and Volga-Dnepr Group, two entities against which Canada recently imposed sanctions due to their complicity in President Putin’s war of choice. The seizure of the asset was made possible by the new asset seizure and forfeiture authorities under Canada’s autonomous sanctions regimes put forward in Budget 2022 and is in direct response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine that began on February 24, 2022.\n\nThe seizure of this important asset is the first step of the Government of Canada’s action under the asset seizure and forfeiture regime and is designed to put additional pressure on Russia to stop its illegal war against Ukraine by straining its economic system and limiting resources that fuel the war. This is the first physical asset seized by the Government of Canada under this regime, and second overall seized and restrained under the Special Economic Measures Act.\n\nThe Government of Canada will seize the asset and manage it in accordance with federal legislation. Should the asset ultimately be forfeited to the Crown, Canada will work with the Government of Ukraine on options to redistribute this asset to compensate victims of human rights abuses, restore international peace and security, or rebuild Ukraine.\n\nBy authorizing the seizure of the Antonov 124, Canada reaffirms that impunity is not an option for those who have profited from Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine."
