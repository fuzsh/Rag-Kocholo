First of all I want to thank everybody for their support in all these years. I sure didn’t expect this thread going on for so long. Click on the link and have a look if you like.\n\nI want to continue the thread here in the new forum but before I kick off with my latest build, just let me show you some of my favourite models I’ve build in the past few years.

Some extraordinary pilots among them!\n\nSoon I will start showing here my latest finished builds and I hope you’ll accompany me along the way as you did all the years in the old forum.\n\nHappy modelling and stay safe!\n\nTorsten\n\nThanks for your kind comments, guys! I’ll try to present my finished models here in the same way I did in the old Aeroscale forum.\n\nMike, I’m glad to hear that you like the way of my presentation. It doesn’t need a lot of extra time to build up my “photo studio”, and there’s nothing magical in my photography. I use a blue photo carton on my kitchen table, a suitable base and my faithful old Canon PowerShot SX100, which is at least 10 years old. Has made already a few 10.000 photos, especially during holidays. And I always like to give my builds a “face”, to show that there were humans sitting in the original machines, no matter what uniform they wore. That sometimes needs some time indeed for research. Some guys make it easy for me like Gerhard Barkhorn or Don Gentile, some don’t, like Masao Itagaki (the pilot of the Ki-61) or Irina Osadze (the pilot of the Pe-2).\n\nJoel, my dear #1 fan I really can’t tell which models I like most, but there are a few I’m really proud of. Usually that are the more difficult builds. Building the PZL 37 was not easy because of the fitting (and it’s rare seen) but I made it, so it would be among my Top 10, same counts for the oldie Henschel Hs 123 (not shown here), where nearly no part fitted to the other, but I made it. Difficult paint jobs I had also a few like on that Ki-45 seen here or lately on the greek Leopard 2A4GR tank. I would also set them on the Top 10 list. I also like that FiAF Bf 109 G-6, the Utti Air Racer, where decaling was time consumpting. So I have a few favs …\n\nYou may have followed my new bench works thread, so you’ll know what comes next …\n\nHave a great weekend!\n\nTorsten\n\nSome of you guys have followed my latest build blog which I have finished about 2 weeks ago. Meanwhile I have taken better photos and today I want to show you a very enjoyable Eduard DualCombo of the Grumman Hellcat Mk. I and Mk. II of the Fleet Air Arm in 1/48 …\n\n… by 1943 it came apparent to the british FAA that their carrier based fighters were incapable of fulfilling all requirements demanded of them. Having had good experience with the F4F Wildcat, known as the “Martlet” in british service, the FAA took notice of its successor, the F6F Hellcat. Though loans and lease programs, there was a total of 1182 of these aircraft handed over to the FAA. The british designation “Gannet” was not carried long. Over the course of 1943, it was decided to readopt the original name, so the F6F-3 became the Hellcat Mk. I (252 aircraft) and the F6F-5 became the Hellcat Mk. II (930 aircraft). Hellcats of the FAA entered combat operations at the end of 1943 from escort carriers off the shores of Scandinavia. Other operational areas in Europe included the Channel, where convoy duties were fulfilled and cover for the Normandy landings. In the MTO FAA Hellcats provided air cover along with american fighters for the invations of southern France. From the end of 1944, Hellcat activity shifted to the Pacific. Combat operations of the British Pacific Fleet were entered in the vicinity of Malysia, eastern India and Sumatra. The career of the Hellcat in british service ended in late 1945, when the majority of 12 squadrons were disbanded or re-equipped with british designed types (text taken in parts from the Eduard instruction sheet) …\n\n… I have built Hellcat Mk I (JV132) from No. 800 Sqn FAA, aboard the escort carrier HMS Emperor in May 1944, flown by Lt. Blythe Ritchie. With this aircraft he took part in the attacks on the german battleship “Tirpitz” in norwegian waters and scored 2 kills in it against Luftwaffe aircraft. The Hellcat Mk II (JZ796) is from No. 808 Sqn FAA, aboard the escort carrier HMS Khedive in June 1945, flown by Sub Lt. Oscar Lorenzo, an argentinian pilot …\n\n… Eduard came out with this limited edition in 2008 and this DualCombo comes with the full program of a ProfiPack for 2 builds, So masks, PE parts and decal options of 6 FAA Hellcats (3 x Mk I and 3 x Mk II) are included. Most PE parts are used to pimp up the cockpits and I tried to use as many of these parts as possible. But I gave up with the ignition wires for the big Pratt & Whitneys. They would be barely visible anyway. The kit itself goes together very easy. There are no big problems, I haven’t used any putty on both Hellcats. It’s a very enjoyable and smooth build. I have decided to use only an external fuel tank on JV132, JZ796 got none but rockets intead …\n\n… I have painted both Hellcats more or less exclusively with Vallejo ModelAir paints. Both cockpits are painted with 71010 Interior Green, the Mk I got 71302 Sky on the underside and 71110 Extra Dark Sea Grey and 71309 Dark Slate Grey on fuselage and wings. The Mk II got 71295 US Navy Sea Blue all over with 71279 Insignia White stripes. Only the propellers and tyres are painted with Revell Aqua paints this time. Final coating was made again with Clear Matt (on JV132) and Satin Varnish (on JZ796) from Marabu, though JZ796 looks pretty matt to me now. The decals are printed by Cartograph and are of high quality. They are thin and behave well in warm water. Had no problems applying them. Though after the final coating I have discovered a bit of silvering here and there. But only on some small stencils, nothing to worry about.\n\nOkay folks, I thank you again for stepping in and walking around my “Royal Hellcats” and hope you have enjoyed it as much as I have enjoyed building these beauties.\n\nHappy modelling and stay healthy!\n\nTorsten"
