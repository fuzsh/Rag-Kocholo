        "text": "Hi all,\n\nThis is a question which has been getting at me lately.\n\nWhats your opinion on how important lend lease aid was to the Soviet war effort and was it decisive in winning the war?\n\nIve heard many arguements on this and half say that without lend lease, the continuation of the soviet war effort would have been impossible and they would have sued for peace with Germany.\n\nThe other half ive heard say that when lend lease started to arrive at the SU in large enough quantities the greater part of the war had been won without it.\n\nMy impression has always been that lend lease aid was more of a comfort factor rather than anything decisive. i.e the supply of food and boots etc. Since many of the tanks and aircraft that were given to the soviets were rejected since they were either obsolete or inferior to soviet designs.\n\nIve also heard from various sources (ill try to confirm these)that lend lease aid contributed to around 4 - 14% of total soviet war production.\n\nThoughts?\n\nLL was important to the Soviets, but not \"The reason they woon the war\"\n\nI believe that , even if not first rate equipment, it meant that the Soviets could put a higher percentage of their better weapons into the front and the lesser rated equipment on the periphery.\n\nIt allowed their production to specialise as they knew the Western Allies would fill the gaps. (Especially in Heavy Military standard Trucks)\n\nBut, the Soviets did widely use Allied weapons, The P-39, used as a ground attack weapon was loved by them, they also used B-25 & A-20 widely and respected the Matilda II & Valentine though rued their small guns. (The Lee/Grant was called 7 Graves for 7 Brothers)\n\nA bigger question was the effect on the British Forces of the weapons sent, especially in 1941-42. Britain couldnt equip its Eastern Air Forces with a modern Fighter, but sent up to a thousand Hurricanes to Russia, Hundreds of Valentines went to Russia, while Indian Armoured Units used Ford Trucks, a second Armoured Bde in Burma or 1 in Malaya may have made the Japanese task so much harder. The Australian Armoured units could not get modern tanks until the US entered and Grants were provided.\n\n??\n\nAs is often the case, the truth lies somewhere between the extremes of retoric on this issue. Was lend lease critical to the Soviet war effort? Yes. Aviation fuels, fuel addititves and other high grade POL products were an exclusive lend lease item for them. Without these their aircraft would have performed substancially worse than they did.\n\nThe P-39 and P-63 were, by Soviet standards, good performing aircraft. Certainly the A-20 was a good attack bomber for them as well.\n\nIn electronics the lend lease contribution was critical too. Radar, radio, telephones and, tubes were just a few items that overwhelmingly were lend lease. In a mobile war these were critical to success.\n\nThe bottom line is that it was many of the seemingly mundane items that lend lease provided enmass to the Soviets that permitted them not only to stop the Germans but, win. Without these items the Soviets likely would still have fought Germany to a standstill but they probably couldn't have carried the war to Germany.\n\nThe P-39 being used as a ground-attack plane is a common western misconception that lingers to this day. I do not know where this myth originated, but it is repeated in \"serious\" texts more often than you can shake a stick at. It probably stems from the fact that western sources failed to comprehend that it was an excellent fighter for the conditions where the Soviets used it, ie at low altitude without a need for a supercharger (the main problem in western conditions).\n\nIn fact the P-39 was used to a very large degree as an air superiority fighter, and with a great degree of success at the low altitudes of the Eastern Front. Looking at a list of the top ten scoring Soviet (and hence Allied) fighter pilots reveal a high proportion of P-39 pilots and kills. As an example, number 2 ace Aleksander Pokryshkin scored 48 out of 59 kills, and number 3 ace Grigory Rechkalov 44 out of 58 kills, in the P-39.\n\nOn the original topic I'll note that the Soviets considered the Hurricane rather useless, and the banged-up, used and out-dated Spitfires they received rather poor as well.\n\nThe Sherman tank should also get a mention I think, as quite a few served in Mech Corps and were appreciated.\n\nP - 39 was a good fighter ONLY comparing with LaGG -3 or Yaks (no to mention biplane Polikarpovs)\n\nBTW - Soviets during WWI managed to construct 'outstanding' prototypes but when came to mass production miraculously engin power wasn't as prototype and max speed decreased and so on... And instead a good plane pilots received 'Lacquered\n\nCoffin' (as they called LaGG - 3)\n\nSoviets claimed the whole Lend Lease was insignificant in their war effort while was VITAL.\n\nsource: German Aces of the Russian Front by John Weal p. 12 - 13\n\nThe early Soviet Yak-1, Yak-7 and LaGG-3 fighters were roughly equal to the Hurricane and P-40, ie sturdy and reliable but not sufficient performers to go one on one with the Bf-109, but still sufficient to inflict casualties, albeit at a heavy price.\n\nOverall I'd say the P-39 was better than these Soviet and Lend-Lease aircraft, indeed it served with distinction in upgraded models for the most part of the war as far as I know. While not an outstanding aircraft by mid to late war, it did a good job and the Soviet pilots I've seen have never expressed any doubts about going up against the Luftwaffe in it. The same can NOT be said about Spitfires, Hurricanes and P-40s!\n\nThe first production aircraft were often low-performers. However, once these kinks had been sorted out the Soviet had some of the best fighters of World War II.\n\nA good example is the La-5 which had quite a lot of problems in the beginning of the production cycle, things like the cockpit being filled with smoke from the engine(!). By the time it had been upgraded to the La-5FN standard it was a great fighter. In the mid-1943 timeframe when the La-5FN went into service it clearly outperformed the Bf-109s in service at the time, and slighty outperformed the Fw-190 at typical Eastern Front conditions.\n\nThe later version Yak fighters, the Yak-9 and especially the (Spitfire-on-steroids-with-climb-of-a-109) Yak-3 are also clearly contenders in any comparison for \"best fighter of World War II\". I am not aware of any aircraft beside the Yak-3 that has been issued with a \"do not engage\" warning by the Luftwaffe, even if it was only for lower altitudes.\n\nInsignificant is clearly an overstatement in one direction, while VITAL is the same in a completely different direction."
