        "text": "marshall said:\n\nI haven't said that Urbanowicz was a better pilot than great German aces,\n\nWhen Adler asked if u wanted ur vote changed from Gabreski to Urbanowicz, u said yes, which means u voted for him.... Nationistic pride is great and all, but be realistic... Voting for something simply for a nations pride is dumb and uneducated, to say the least.... If u dont know enough about the subject, why fu*kin vote???\n\nalso I don't think that you don't have any idea what are you talking about,\n\nOh really dumb-ass??? I guess that since my Grandfather was an Ace, and I grew up in the Black Sheep Community with other Aces, including Boyington, I guess I am clueless... Or how about the conversations Ive had with Galland or Yeager or Gabreski or Vejtasa or etc etc... I guess I have no idea on the subject.... U had best keep ur fu*kin moth shut moron or I will break it off in ur ass.... Dont piss of a Moderator, ever heard of that???\n\nI said that I'm not able to tell who was the best.\n\nThen why should ur opinion in this thread have any bearing??? U are un-educated in this topic, so maybe u should shut ur yap and read what others who DO have the experience on the subject are saying....\n\nbut does in a 1 on 1 dogfight always wins the guy with more kills under his belt? I don't think so.\n\nThen u think wrong.... 9 outta 10 times, the more experienced pilot will take it to the greenie, in a very bad way... Ask the Russian VVS about that, would u.... And always is a strong word however, since there are a few instances where a rookie took out an accomplished Experten, but they are VERY very limited....\n\nAnd besides the point, over 75% of all shootdowns were not dogfights, but bounces where the victim had no idea he was flying straight into an Aces gunsight....\n\nOh really dumb-ass??? I guess that since my Grandfather was an Ace, and I grew up in the Black Sheep Community with other Aces, including Boyington, I guess I am clueless...

U had best keep ur fu*kin moth shut moron or I will break it off in ur ass.... Dont piss of a Moderator, ever heard of that???\n\nI think you misunderstood our Polish friend. He wasn't saying that we are clueless. His original sentence contained a double negative. He said, \"I don't think that you don't have any idea...\" He also seems to have changed his mind, and now he isn't voting for anyone.\n\nIn any case, I have a question for everyone here who voted for Baer over Marseille. Why do you think he was the best?\n\nHartmann shot down his first Soviet victim on 5 November 1942, an Il-2 from 7 GShAP (7th Guards Ground Attack Aviation Regiment)..... Marseille, shot down his last 156-158 on the 26th of September 1942...\n\nOne just getting started and one KIA. I wonder what kinda score Marseille would have racked up if he'd been posted on the eastern front later....\n\nThis is a really interesting question. If Marseille had survived to fight on the Eastern Front, and if he'd been active for the whole war, I'm guessing he would have ended up with 500+ kills in total.\n\nWho knows, maybe it would have been even more than that. Hartmann knew enough to cut and run when the odds were too heavily against him. Marseille's idea of a good time was to do the exact opposite. He was outrageously aggressive, and that would have served him well on the Eastern front. There would have been lots of targets consisting of poorly-trained pilots in inferior aircraft. He might even have ended up with 1000+ kills. Who knows.\n\nThis is a really interesting question.

He might even have ended up with 1000+ kills. Who knows.\n\nwhy not 10000? I believe with his style of flying he wouldn't last much longer on the eastern front as well. The poorly-trained pilots were not that poor at all since late 1943 and aircraft quality was rather equal, so with his bad*ss flying he wouldn't have much greater chances to survive and to achieve victories like in Africa.\n\nBTW, there were other pilots on the Eastern Front who had as good shooting skills as Marseille. Rudorffer is just to mention.\n\nWell, who survived the war and who - not?\n\nMarseille survived every single encounter with the enemy. In fact, his apparent suicide attacks against multiple enemy fighters usually ended up with all of them shot down and him without a scratch.\n\nHe died in a silly accident, and not in combat.\n\nwhy not 10000? I believe with his style of flying he wouldn't last much longer on the eastern front as well. The poorly-trained pilots were not that poor at all since late 1943 and aircraft quality was rather equal, so with his bad*ss flying he wouldn't have much greater chances to survive and to achieve victories like in Africa.\n\nYou're just saying this because you're biased, and it sounds a whole lot like you think that Marseille was killed in combat. There's no way you can make the argument that Russian pilots and fighters were as good as Western pilots and fighters. If Marseille could chew up Western pilots and aces, then he would certainly have been able to do the same on the Eastern Front.\n\nAnd when you say that in late 1943 the aircraft quality was rather equal, exactly which planes are you comparing? Are you saying that the state-of-the-art Soviet planes of 1943 were as good as the best German planes of the same time?!?\n\nBTW, there were other pilots on the Eastern Front who had as good shooting skills as Marseille. Rudorffer is just to mention.\n\nLook, Marseille invented and mastered absolutely deadly tactics which nobody else could even pull off. There's a reason why Galland said that he was the best fighter pilot of the war. I trust Galland's judgment on the matter. I'd like to know what Hartmann thought of Marseille's skills."
