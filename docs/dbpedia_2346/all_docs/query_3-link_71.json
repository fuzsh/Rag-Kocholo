        "text": "On 24 June 2024, the EU adopted additional sanctions in response to Russia’s illegal and unprovoked military aggression against Ukraine. These sanctions build on, and expand, the earlier sanctions.\n\nEU sanctions regulations have direct effect in all Member States of the EU, and, as such, are legally binding on all natural and legal persons in Ireland. Private companies, therefore, have an obligation to ensure that they are in full compliance with these new measures. A natural or legal person who contravenes a provision of an EU sanctions regulation shall be guilty of an offence and liable to prosecution.\n\nThis webpage summarises the key trade provisions of the EU sanctions enacted to date. The department has also prepared an associated guidance notice.\n\nThe information on this page and in the notice are provided for information purposes only and do not constitute a legal interpretation of the EU Regulations. Traders should consult the EU Regulations directly, and when necessary, obtain professional advice.\n\nThis page and the notice will be regularly reviewed, and while every effort has been made to ensure that the information is accurate, the situation is very dynamic and the sanctions, including the lists of prohibited goods, are liable to change.\n\nTrade sanctions adopted on 24 June 2024\n\nTrade sanctions adopted on 23 February 2024\n\nTrade sanctions adopted on 18 December 2023\n\nTrade sanctions adopted on 23 June 2023\n\nTrade sanctions adopted on 24 February 2023\n\nAircraft retained in Russia against the will of their non-Russian owner\n\nDivestment from Russia or the wind-down of business activities in Russia\n\nTrade sanctions adopted on 16 December 2022\n\nTrade sanctions adopted on 6 October 2022\n\nTrade sanctions adopted on 21 July 2022\n\nImportation of goods using Russian-flagged vessels\n\nTrade sanctions adopted on 3 June 2022\n\nTrade sanctions adopted on 8 April 2022\n\nTrade sanctions adopted on 15 March 2022\n\nTrade sanctions adopted on 9 March 2022\n\nTrade sanctions adopted on 2 March 2022\n\nTrade sanctions adopted on 25 February 2022\n\nTrade sanctions adopted on 23 February 2022\n\nTrade sanctions adopted in 2014\n\nExemptions\n\nFurther information\n\nTrade sanctions adopted on 24 June 2024\n\nThe major trade-related elements of the 14th package, set out in Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024, amending Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, are as follows:\n\nI prohibits reloading services of Russian LNG in EU territory for the purpose of transshipment operations to third countries. This covers both ship-to-ship transfers and ship-to-shore transfers, as well as re-loading operations, and does not affect import but only re-export to third countries via the EU. Bans new investments, and the provision of goods, technology, and services for completing LNG projects under construction, such as Arctic LNG 2 and Murmansk LNG. Introduces import restrictions on Russian LNG through EU terminals not connected to the natural gas system.\n\nII requires EU parent companies to undertake best efforts to ensure third-country subsidiaries do not participate in any activities resulting in an outcome which would undermine sanctions. EU operators selling battlefield goods which are found in Ukraine or are critical to the development of Russian military systems to third countries must implement due diligence mechanisms capable of identifying and assessing risks of re-exportation to Russia. EU operators transferring industrial know-how for the production of battlefield goods to third-country commercial counterparts must include contractual provisions to ensure that this know-how will not be used for goods intended for Russia.\n\nIII outlaws the use of the SPFS financial messaging service developed by the Central Bank of Russia to neutralise the effect of restrictive measures. EU entities operating outside of Russia will be forbidden from connecting to the SPFS or equivalent specialised financial messaging services. EU operators will be barred from making transactions with specifically listed entities using SPFS outside of Russia. Introduces a ban on transactions with targeted credit and financial institutions and crypto assets providers established outside of the EU, when these entities facilitate transactions that support Russia’s defence-industrial base through the export, supply, sale, transfer or transport towards Russia of dual-use goods and technology, sensitive items, battlefield goods, firearms and ammunition.\n\nIV prohibits political parties and foundations, non-governmental organisations, including think tanks, or media service providers in the EU, from accepting funding coming from the Russian state and its proxies.\n\nV Imposes a port access ban and ban on provision of services targeting specific vessels supporting Russia’s warfare. These vessels can be designated for various reasons such as the transport of military equipment for Russia, the transport of stolen Ukrainian grain, and support in the development of Russia’s energy sector, for instance through the transport of LNG components or transshipments of LNG. This measure also targets tankers part of Putin’s dark fleet which circumvent the EU and Price Cap Coalition’s caps, while adopting deceptive shipping practices in complete disregard of international standards. Widens the EU flight ban; The prohibition to land in, take off from or overfly the territory of the EU will also apply to any aircraft used for a non-scheduled flight, and where a Russian natural or legal person, entity or body, is in a position to effectively determine the place or time for its take-off or landing to reach, for instance, a holiday destination or a business meeting. Furthermore, operators must provide any information requested by member states’ national competent authorities about non-scheduled flights, including ownership of the aircraft and possibly passengers. Expands the prohibition on the transport of goods by road within the territory of the EU, including in transit, so as to cover EU operators which are owned 25% or more by a Russian natural or legal person.\n\nVI adds 61 entities supporting Russia’s military-industrial complex to the list, imposing tighter export restrictions concerning dual use goods and technologies, as well as goods and technology which might contribute to the technological enhancement of Russia’s defence and security sector. Expands the list of restricted items that could contribute to the technological enhancement of Russia’s defence and security sector, adding machine tools and “All Terrain Vehicles.” Introduces further export restrictions on goods enhancing Russian industrial capabilities, such as chemicals, including manganese ores and compounds of rare-earths, plastics, excavating machinery, monitors, and electrical equipment, and further restrictions on import of helium from Russia. Adds Liechtenstein to the list of partner countries applying restrictive measures on iron and steel imports from Russia and a set of import control measures that are substantially equivalent to those of the EU.\n\nVII allows EU operators to claim compensation for damages caused by Russian companies due to sanctions implementation and expropriation. It also creates the instrument to draw up a list of companies subject to a transaction ban for meddling with arbitration and court competence.\n\nVIII imposes restrictions on accepting applications for registrations in the EU of certain intellectual property rights by Russian nationals and companies, Forbids purchase, import, transfer or export Ukrainian cultural property goods and other goods of archaeological, historical, cultural, rare scientific or religious importance, where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the goods have been unlawfully removed from Ukraine.\n\nTrade sanctions adopted on 23 February 2024\n\nThe major trade-related elements of the package, set out in Council Regulation (EU) 2024/745 of 23 February 2024, amending Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, are as follows:\n\nI includes 194 individual designations, bringing the total EU listings to over 2000. These designations target:\n\nover 140 companies and individuals from Russia's military-industrial complex involved in manufacturing missiles, drones, anti-aircraft missile systems, military vehicles, high-tech components for weapons, and other military equipment\n\n10 Russian companies and individuals involved in shipping armaments from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to Russia, including the DPRK's Defence Minister and several Belarusian entities supporting the Russian armed forces\n\na Russian logistics company and its director involved in parallel imports of prohibited goods, and another actor involved in a procurement scheme\n\nsix judges and 10 officials in the occupied territories of Ukraine\n\n15 individuals and 2 entities involved in the forced transfer, deportation, and military indoctrination of Ukrainian children, including in Belarus.\n\nII deepens actions to prevent Russia from acquiring Western sensitive technologies for its military, specifically targeting drone components. Adding:\n\n27 Russian and third-country companies to the list associated with Russia's military-industrial complex, imposing export restrictions on dual-use goods and technology\n\n17 Russian companies involved in the development, production, and supply of electronic components used in drones.\n\nIII adds the United Kingdom to the list of partner countries for iron and steel imports, applying restrictive measures and import control measures equivalent to those in EU Regulation (EU) No 833/2014.\n\nTrade sanctions adopted on 18 December 2023\n\nThe major trade-related elements of the package, set out in Council Regulation (EU) 2023/2878 of 18 December 2023, amending Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, are as follows:\n\nI Introduces a No Russia Clause. Exporters are required to contractually prohibit re-exportation to Russia and re-exportation for use in Russia of particularly sensitive goods and technology, when selling, supplying, transferring or exporting to a third country, with the exception of partner countries.\n\nII Bans Russian nationals from owning, controlling or holding any posts on the governing bodies of the legal persons, entities or bodies providing crypto-asset wallet, account or custody services to Russian persons and residents.\n\nIII Imposes a prohibition on the direct or indirect import, purchase or transfer of diamonds from Russia. This prohibition applies to diamonds originating in Russia, diamonds exported from Russia, diamonds transiting Russia and Russian diamonds when processed in third countries.\n\nIV Expands the list of restricted items that could contribute to the technological enhancement of Russia’s defence and security sector to include: chemicals, lithium batteries, thermostats, DC motors and servomotors for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), machine tools and machinery parts.\n\nV Extends the prohibition on the provision of services to also include the provision of software for the management of enterprises and software for industrial design and manufacture.\n\nVI Introduces further restrictions on imports of goods which generate significant revenues for Russia and thereby enable the continuation of its war of aggression against Ukraine, such pig iron and spiegeleisen, copper wires, aluminium wires, foil, tubes and pipes for a total value of €2.2 billion per year.\n\nVII Introduces an import ban on liquefied propane (LPG) with a 12-month transitional period.\n\nVIII Expands the transit ban that currently applies to dual use goods and technologies exported from the EU to third countries via the territory of Russia to all battlefield goods.\n\nNOTE: The list of individuals and entities subject to sanctions has been significantly expanded. The Council added 30 new entities to the list of those directly supporting Russia's military and industrial complex in its war of aggression against Ukraine. They will be subject to tighter export restrictions concerning dual use goods and technologies, as well as goods and technology which might contribute to the technological enhancement of Russia's defence and security sector. Some of these 30 entities belong to third countries involved in the circumvention of trade restrictions, or are Russian entities involved in the development, production and supply of electronic components for Russia's military and industrial complex.\n\nTrade sanctions adopted on 23 June 2023\n\nThe major trade-related elements of the package, set out in Council Regulation (EU) 2023/1214 of 23 June 2023, amending Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, are as follows:\n\nI Introduces a new anti-circumvention tool. This mechanism enables the EU to restrict the sale, supply, transfer or export of specified sanctioned goods and technology to certain third countries whose jurisdictions are considered to be at continued and particularly high risk of circumvention. This new “anti-circumvention” tool will be an exceptional and last resort measure when other individual measures and outreach by the EU to concerned third countries have been insufficient to prevent circumvention.\n\nII Extension of the transit prohibition for certain sensitive goods (advanced technology, aviation-related materials) exported from the EU to third countries, via Russia.\n\nIII Restriction on the exports of further technological items found on the battlefield in Ukraine or equipment needed to produce such items.\n\nIV Tightening restrictions on imports of iron and steel goods by requiring importers of sanctioned iron and steel goods that have been processed in a third country to provide evidence at the moment of importation, that the inputs used do not come from Russia.\n\nV Prohibition to sell, license, transfer or refer intellectual property rights and trade secrets used in connection with restricted goods to prevent the sanctioned goods from simply being manufactured outside the EU.\n\nVI Extension of the ban on export of luxury cars to all new and second-hand cars above a certain engine size (> 1,900 cm³), and all electric and hybrid vehicles.\n\nVII A full ban on certain types of machinery components.\n\nVIII A full ban on trucks with Russian trailers and semi-trailers from transporting goods to the EU.\n\nIX Prohibition to access EU ports for vessels that engage in ship-to-ship transfers suspected to be in breach of the Russian oil import ban or G7 Coalition price cap.\n\nX Insertions of strict and very targeted derogations to the existing export bans to enable the maintenance of the CPC (Caspian Pipeline Consortium) pipeline which transports Kazakh oil to the EU through Russia.\n\nXI Insertion of an exemption for the provision of pilot services in specific circumstances.\n\nXII Insertion of a temporary derogation to allow for the provision of prohibited services which are legally required for the divestment of Russian operators from the EU.\n\nNOTE: The list of individuals and entities subject to sanctions has been significantly expanded. In addition to the Russian and Iranian entities already listed, the listings now also include entities registered in Hong Kong, China, Uzbekistan, the United Arab Emirates, Syria and Armenia. Over 100 additional individuals and entities are subject to asset freezes. These include senior military officials, decision makers on the war, persons involved in the illegal deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia, judges who took politically motivated decisions against Ukrainian citizens, persons responsible for the looting of cultural heritage, businesspersons, propagandists, as well as Russian IT companies providing critical technology and software to the Russian intelligence, banks operating in the occupied territories and entities working with the Russian armed forces. Accordingly, traders should conduct appropriate due diligence, including thorough screening of all parties to a transaction, to avoid inadvertently breaching the sanctions.\n\nTrade sanctions adopted on 24 February 2023\n\nThe 10th package of EU sanctions came into effect on 26 February 2023. The major trade-related elements of the package, which are set out in Council Regulation (EU) 2023/427 of 25 February 2023, amending Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, are as follows:\n\nI Further extends the list of restricted items, the sale, supply, transfer or export of which might contribute to Russia’s military and technological enhancement or the development of its defence and security sector, adding rare-earths and compounds, electronic integrated circuits and thermographic cameras, among others.\n\nII Extends the list of restricted items, the sale, supply, transfer or export of which might contribute to the enhancement of Russia’s industrial capabilities.\n\nIII Further extends to the lists of items which generate significant revenues for Russia, whose import is prohibited, to include\n\na) Bitumen and related materials such as asphalt, and\n\nb) Synthetic rubber and carbon blacks.\n\nIV Further extends the list of restricted items, the sale, supply, transfer or export of which is prohibited, covering goods and technology suited for use in aviation and the space industry.\n\nV Prohibits the transit of dual use goods and firearms via the territory of Russia to third countries.\n\nVI Introduces a prohibition on Russian nationals from serving on governing bodies of Member States' critical infrastructure companies, as specified.\n\nVII Introduces a prohibition on providing gas storage capacity in the Union to Russian nationals, natural persons residing in Russia or legal persons or entities established in Russia.\n\nVIII Introduces a derogation, which is temporary and limited in scope, from the prohibition on providing certain services set out in the Regulation, in order to further facilitate an expeditious exit from the Russian market.\n\nIX Introduces an exemption from the prohibition on the provision of pilot services, for reasons of maritime safety, to vessels in innocent passage.\n\nNOTE: The list of individuals and entities subject to sanctions has been significantly expanded. This now includes seven Iranian entities manufacturing goods which have been used by Russia’s military in its war of aggression. Therefore, traders should carry out appropriate due diligence, including thorough screening of all parties to a transaction, to avoid inadvertently breaching the sanctions.\n\nAircraft retained in Russia against the will of their non-Russian owner\n\nOn 21 December 2022 the European Commission published guidance on the execution of insurance settlements in relation to aircraft retained in Russia against the will of their non-Russian owner.\n\nUnder Article 3c of Council Regulation (EU) 833/2014 it is prohibited to sell, supply, transfer or export, directly or indirectly, aircraft, whether or not originating in the Union, to any natural or legal person, entity or body in Russia or for use in Russia.\n\nHowever, the Commission’s guidance clarifies that, in circumstances where aircraft are retained in Russia against the will of their non-Russian owner, it is not prohibited under this Article for the non-Russian owner of the aircraft to execute an insurance settlement with a Russian entity leading to the payment of the market value of the lost aircraft by the latter, provided that five specific conditions are satisfied.\n\nThe full guidance, and the specific conditions necessary for the execution of the settlement, are set out in Section 12.4 of frequently asked questions concerning sanctions adopted following Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine and Belarus' involvement in it.\n\nDivestment from Russia or the wind-down of business activities in Russia\n\nArticle 12b of Council Regulation (EU) 833/2014, which was introduced in the 9th EU sanctions package on 16 December, provides for a temporary derogation from the prohibition on the sale, supply and transfer of certain goods, when such a transaction is necessary for the divestment from Russia or the wind-down of business activities in Russia.\n\nThis derogation is designed to facilitate EU entities with subsidiaries or other investments in Russia to disengage from the Russia economy. The derogation can only be authorised by a Competent Authority if certain conditions are satisfied, including most particularly, that the goods cannot be used for a military purpose in Russia. This Article is not applicable in the context of aircraft that have been retained in Russia against the will of their non-Russian owner.\n\nTrade sanctions adopted on 16 December 2022\n\nThe 9th package of EU sanctions came into effect on 17 December 2022. The major trade-related elements of the package, which are set out in Council Regulation (EU) 2022/2474 of 16 December 2022, amending Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, are as follows:\n\nI Extends the list of restricted items, the sale, supply, transfer or export of which might contribute to Russia’s military and technological enhancement or the development of its defence and security sector, to include\n\na) drone engines,\n\nb) further chemical and biological equipment,\n\nc) riot control agents, and\n\nd) electronic components.\n\nII Extends the list of restricted items, the sale, supply, transfer or export of which is prohibited, covering goods and technology suited for use in aviation and the space industry.

Therefore, traders should carry out appropriate due diligence, including thorough screening of all parties to a transaction, to avoid inadvertently breaching the sanctions.\n\nTrade sanctions adopted on 6 October 2022\n\nThe 8th package of EU sanctions came into effect on 7 October 2022. The major trade-related elements of the package, which are set out in Council Regulation (EU) 2022/1904 of 6 October 2022, amending Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, are as follows:\n\nI Extends the prohibition on the provision of services to Russia to include the provision of\n\na) architectural and engineering services, including integrated engineering services, urban planning and landscape architectural services and engineering related scientific and technical consulting services,\n\nb) IT consultancy services, covering the installation of computer hardware and software implementation services, including assistance services to the clients in the installation of computer hardware and computer networks, and all consultancy services involving development and implementation of software, and\n\nc) legal advisory services.\n\nII Prohibition on the sale, supply, transfer or export of firearms, their parts and essential components and ammunition.\n\nIII Further extends the import ban on coal and other products that either originate in Russia or have been exported from Russia.\n\nIV Further extends the import ban on iron and steel products that either originate in Russia or have been exported from Russia.\n\nV Additions to the lists of items which generate significant revenues for Russia, whose import is prohibited, including\n\na) wood pulp and paper,\n\nb) certain stones and precious metals used in the jewellery industry,\n\nc) certain machinery and chemical items,\n\nd) cigarettes,\n\ne) plastics and finished chemical products such as cosmetics.\n\nVI Additions to the list of goods which could contribute to the enhancement of Russian industrial capacities, whose export is prohibited.\n\nVII Additions to the list of goods which could contribute to Russia’s military and technological enhancement, whose export is prohibited.\n\nVIII Additions to the list of goods used in the aviation sector, whose sale, supply transfer or export is prohibited.\n\nIX Prohibits the maritime transport, including through ship-to-ship transfers, of certain crude oil and certain petroleum products which originate in Russia, or which have been exported from Russia, to third countries.\n\nX Introduction of an exemption from the prohibition on the maritime transport by vessel to third countries of crude oil or petroleum products which originate in or are exported from Russia, and on the provision of technical assistance, brokering services or financing or financial assistance related to these products, where they have been purchased at or below a pre-established price cap set by the Price Cap Setting Body of the G7+ Price Cap Coalition.\n\nXI The ban on Russian-flagged vessels accessing EU ports and locks now also applies to vessels certified by the Russian Maritime Register of Shipping.\n\nXII A ban on EU nationals to hold any posts on the governing bodies of certain listed state-owned or controlled entities or bodies.\n\nAdditionally, Council Regulation (EU) 2022/263 as amended, which includes provisions restricting certain trading activities, both import and export, has been extended to include the four regions illegally annexed by Russia, the non-government controlled areas of Ukraine in the oblasts of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia.\n\nNOTE: 1,435 Russian and 230 Belarusian legal persons, entities and bodies, are currently subject to financial sanctions. Therefore, traders should carry out appropriate due diligence, including thorough screening of all parties to a transaction, to avoid inadvertently breaching the sanctions.\n\nTrade sanctions adopted on 21 July 2022\n\nThe “maintenance and alignment” package of EU sanctions came into effect on 22 July 2022 and the major trade-related elements of the package, which are set out in Council Regulation (EU) 2022/1269, amending Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, are as follows:\n\nI A ban on the purchase, import, or transfer of gold, including jewellery, if it originates in Russia.\n\nII Additions to the lists of goods that may contribute to Russia’s military and technological enhancement, or the development of its defence and security sector, whose export is prohibited.\n\nIII Additions to the list of goods suited for use in oil refining and liquefaction of natural gas, whose export is prohibited.\n\nIV The exemption from the prohibition on exports of ‘Dual-use’ and Advanced Technology items intended for cyber-security and information security applications has been removed. However, A National Competent Authority (the department) may authorise a derogation for such exports.\n\nV A National Competent Authority may authorise a derogation from the prohibition on the export of goods that could contribute to the enhancement of Russian industrial capacities, for medical, pharmaceutical or humanitarian purposes.\n\nVI The ban on Russian-flagged vessels accessing EU ports now applies to EU locks as well.\n\nVII Additions to the list of military-affiliated end-user entities in Russia subject to tighter export restrictions.\n\nVIII Additions to the lists of Russian individuals and entities subject to financial sanctions.\n\nNOTE: 1,320 Russian and 230 Belarusian legal persons, entities and bodies, are currently subject to financial sanctions. Therefore, traders should carry out appropriate due diligence, including thorough screening of all parties to a transaction, to avoid inadvertently breaching the sanctions.\n\nImportation of goods using Russian-flagged vessels\n\nFrom 16 April 2022 EU sanctions prohibit vessels registered under the flag of Russia from accessing EU ports. This also applies to vessels that have re-registered from the flag of Russia to the flag of another state after 24 February 2022.\n\nThe EU sanctions, make provision for a national Competent Authority (Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment) to authorise a derogation from the prohibition on limited and very specific grounds. A derogation however, if authorised, would only permit the vessel to access an Irish port. It would be without prejudice to other sanctions measures that may prohibit or restrict the importation of the goods on the vessel.
