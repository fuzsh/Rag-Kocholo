        "text": "U.S. citizens should leave Russia via commercial options still available. The situation on Russian borders is always changing. We update this page once every three months.\n\nAir travel options for U.S. citizens:\n\nBe aware the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) downgraded the air safety rating for Russia, as a result of Russia’s Federal Agency for Air Transport failing to meet International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) safety standards. For more information on this matter, click here.\n\nExplore commercial air routing through non-European destinations.\n\nAsk family and friends outside of Russia to help buy airline tickets. This is especially helpful if credit/debit cards are not working, as described below.\n\nConsider contacting a global travel company to buy airline tickets.\n\nTravelers may also depart via some of Russia’s land borders. More information is below.\n\nUse of Credit/Debit Cards & Access to Foreign Currency: International sanctions have been imposed on Russian banks due to Russia’s military actions in Ukraine. As a result, U.S.-issued credit and debit cards will not work in Russia. Travelers may consider using local credit cards, cash, or other forms of payment. Travelers can also ask family and friends outside of Russia to buy their ticket. U.S. citizens should take this into account when making plans.\n\nBe aware the exclusion of Russia from the SWIFT system has made money transfers to/from the United States impossible. The Bank of Russia announced that non-residents from “both friendly and unfriendly countries” may transfer funds abroad in the amount of their wages although there remains a ban on transferring funds abroad for non-residents from “unfriendly countries” that do not work in Russia, as well as legal entities from such states. This ban may be extended beyond its current end date of September 30, 2024. In addition, non-residents may have difficulty withdrawing foreign currency, including USD, from accounts held in Russian banks.\n\nWe encourage you to enroll in our Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP). STEP enrollment gives you the latest security updates and it makes it easier for the U.S. Embassy to contact you in an emergency. U.S. Citizens in Russia can email moscowacs@state.gov for assistance.\n\nClick here for more updates from the U.S. Embassy in Russia.\n\nKEY LINKS\n\nLatest Travel Advisory and Alerts\n\nSecurity Alert\n\nDeparting Russia by Air:\n\nIf you want to leave Russia by air, be prepared to comply with your destination's entry requirements.
