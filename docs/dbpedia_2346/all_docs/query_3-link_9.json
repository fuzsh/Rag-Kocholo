        "text": "U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE\n\nBUREAU OF INDUSTRY AND SECURITY\n\nRESOURCES ON EXPORT CONTROLS IMPLEMENTED IN RESPONSE TO RUSSIA’S INVASION OF UKRAINE\n\nUpdated February 23, 2024\n\nIn response to the Russian Federation’s (Russia’s) invasion of Ukraine, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) has taken swift and severe action to impose stringent export controls on Russia. These restrictions have also been applied to Belarus in response to its substantial enabling of Russia’s invasion.\n\nThe actions taken by BIS build on existing restrictions in place on Russia since its occupation of Crimea in 2014 and for other purposes. Certain of these restrictions remain in effect; others have been expanded in scope as a result of the recent actions. In particular, BIS has imposed controls on a range of items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) that did not previously require export licenses when destined for Russia. BIS has also imposed similarly stringent controls on items subject to the EAR that are destined for Belarus. Notably, both countries have been made subject to broad in-country transfer controls.\n\nThe information provided on this page is updated as events warrant. Readers should review the final rules and other legal documents in their entirety for all relevant requirements.\n\nCURRENT PRESS RELEASES\n\nNote: Where appropriate/relevant press releases include

response to the Russian Federation’s (Russia’s) further invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) has taken swift and severe action to impose stringent export controls on Russia. These restrictions have also been applied to Belarus in response to its substantial enabling of Russia’s invasion.\n\nThe action taken by BIS builds on existing restrictions in place on Russia since its occupation of Crimea in 2014 and for other purposes. Certain of these restrictions remain in effect; others have been expanded in scope as a result of Russia’s recent invasion and ongoing destabilizing conduct in Ukraine. BIS has also imposed similarly stringent controls on items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) (15 CFR parts 730-774) that are destined for Belarus.\n\nIn particular, effective April 8, 2022, all items on the Commerce Control List (CCL) require export licenses when destined for Russia or Belarus. Notably, the new license requirements also apply to in-country transfers within Russia and Belarus. Additionally, certain foreign-produced items are now subject to two Foreign Direct Product (FDP) rules and related license requirements that are specific to Russia and Belarus.\n\nU.S. Persons providing services in Russia and Belarus or contemplating business generally involving either destination should also review the prohibitions on transactions involving Russia and Belarus under the regulations of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).\n\nThese FAQs are organized under the following subject headings.

New controls on Belarus target the diversion of items to Russia through Belarus.\n\nBIS will continue to update existing guidance and materials, publish new materials as warranted, and will engage directly with interested stakeholders in a variety of ways.\n\nThe following resources are highlighted as a starting point for U.S. exporters and other interested parties seeking additional information on the rules, related compliance efforts, and other matters.

In so doing, BIS is notifying the public that providing any form of service to these aircraft requires authorization. Absent such authorization, any person anywhere—including within Russia—risks violating the EAR and would be subject to BIS enforcement actions which could include substantial jail time, fines, loss of export privileges, or other restrictions. By preventing these aircraft from receiving any service, for example including from abroad, international flights from Russia on these aircraft are effectively grounded.
