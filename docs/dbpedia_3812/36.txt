Learn more about the map styles

Each map type offers different information and each map style is designed for a different purpose. Read about the styles and map projection used in the above map (Satellite Map of Lađevci).

Satellite map

Satellite map shows the Earth's surface as it really looks like. The above map is based on satellite images taken on July 2004. This satellite map of Lađevci is meant for illustration purposes only. For more detailed maps based on newer satellite and aerial images switch to a detailed map view.

Hillshading is used to create a three-dimensional effect that provides a sense of land relief. Shadows drawn on a map simulate the effects of sunlight falling across the surface of the landscape.

Geographic map projection

A map projection is a way how to transform points on a Earth to points on a map. This map of Lađevci uses Plate Carree projection. The Plate Carree projection is a simple cylindrical projection originated in the ancient times. It has straight and equally spaced meridians and parallels that meet at right angles.

All projections from a sphere to a plane are distorted. The drawback of the Plate Carree projection is that it doesn't make an attempt to compensate for these distortions. For the general view of Lađevci, this is not a significant problem. The detailed maps use the Mercator projection which preserves the shape of small areas better.
