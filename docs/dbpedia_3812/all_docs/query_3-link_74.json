        "text": "Serbian Air Force reorganized\n\nAfter the Balkan conflicts of the nineties of last century the Federation of Serbia and Montenegro was formed in February 2003 out of the remnants of the Republic of Yugoslavia. On the basis of a referendum held on 21 May 2006, Montenegro declared independence on the 3rd of June that year. The armed forces agreed to split the assets according to territorial claims. The Air Force units in Serbia became part of the army of Serbia, with 82 aircraft and 89 helicopters. While in Montenegro the 172 aviation base at Golubovci Air Base near Podgorica with a mixed squadron with 41 aircraft and helicopters became part of the Army of Montenegro.\n\nPart of the reorganization was the forming of 138.mtrae (mesovita transportna avijacijska eskadrila – Mixed Transport Aviation Squadron). The squadron is resposible for airlift, VIP transport, liaison, anti tank missions, special forces support and earial photography. It received the An-26, Yak-40 and Do-28D2s previously operated by the disbanded 677.trae.\n\nIn 1975-1977 14 Antonov An-26 were received followed by a single example in 1984. Currently three are in service, following overhaul and modernization. The first reworked An-26 returned during 2008 in a grey scheme. A second followed to Rostov-on-Don in Russia and returned in May 2009.\n\nThe Yak-40s include two VIP aircraft 71503 and 71504. The former now painted in the Serbian national colour scheme flowing overhaul in Belarus, and two aircraft from the Traffic Services Agency for NAVAID calibration. One of the Do-28Ds is used for geographical survey. The second Dornier is withdrawn and used for spares. The squadron also received the helicopters from the disbanded 890.mhe (mesovita helikopterska eskadrila - Mixed Helicopter Squadron), and includes the Mi-8T (HT-40) and Gazelles (HM-45/HO-45). The 138 number represents a symbolic connection to the 138th Brigade to which both the 677th and 890th were assigned until the 138th was disbanded on June 24, 1997.\n\nThe 138 squadron number is a deviation from the former Yugoslav squadron number system whereby the first digit denotes the squadrons role: 1 fighter, 2 fighter bomber, 3 reconnaissance, 6 transport, 7 helicopter, 8 helicopter.\n\nTest pilots are drawn from operational units, and are selected following a competition between the candidates. The syllabus for test pilots is one year. SLI has a hand full of aircraft and helicopters on permanent assignment including the sole surviving Air Force G-2S Galeb, a few G-4 Super Galeb, a single J-22 and NJ-22 Orao, a few Gazelles and an Utva-75 and the Lasta-95 prototype. If required aircraft and helicopters are loaned from Air Force units.\n\nBoth local produced and western weapons are tested and certified. In 2008 two VOC aircraft were painted in special schemes. Orao J-22 25207 was in a striking black and white colour scheme representing an Eagle the English name for the Orao. And a red and white tail with stylized Serbian national coat of arms and four Cyrillic S letters, meaning Samo Sloga Srbina Spasava, only unity can save the Serbs.\n\nFollowing completion of its overhaul on February 7, 2007 Super Galeb G-4 23736 was painted in a special scheme for celebrating the 30th anniversary of the first flight of the type on July 18, 1978. The aircraft crashed on September 24, 2008 on Batajnica Air Base while practicing an aerobatic display for the airshow on 27 September. The pilot Istvan Kanas was in charge of SLI and was killed in the crash.\n\nThe reconnaissance Oraos are now with 2.iao (izvidacko avijacijsko odeljeaje – Reconnaissance Flight) and has eight IJ-22 and two INJ-22. It is the successor of 353 iae izvidzhacka avijacijska eskadrila, Reconnaissance Aviation Squadron) and retained the badge of that squadron.\n\nTiger Unit pilots from the 241.lbae visited the 2009 Tiger Meet at Kleine Brogel in Belgium as observers. Due to a tight budget they will stay in the observer role for the time being.\n\nOn 3 June 3 2010 a J-22 Orao crashed into Gruza Lake near Knic. The pilot ejected safely after he directed the aircraft into the Gruza Lake, due to a malfunction of the left landing gear, thus avoiding any possible harm to third persons. Pending investigation into the cause of the landing gear malfunction all Oraos were grounded, in mid August they were still grounded.\n\nThe 119th Regiment at Nis with three squadrons and its 47 Mi-8 and Gazelles were in 2007 transferred to 98.ab control. The Regiment had two squadrons at Nis 712.pohe protivoklopna helicopterka eskadrila, anti-armour helicopter squadron with the Gazelle and 787.trhe with the Mi-8. These were combined into a single squadron 119.mhe supporting special forces. The third squadron is at Ladjevci 714.pohe at Ladjevci with HO-42 and HN-42M GAMA Gazelle helicopters. Also at Nis was the 3rd flight of 677.trae with the An-2 and An-26. The An-2s are used for paratroop training. Probably a flight of 138.mtrae is now based at Nis."
