        "text": "Serbia outlines Belgrade concession plans\n\nThe Serbian government has outlined some of its planned concession conditions for Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport, with the future operator required to invest at least 700 million euros. Presenting his new government's program in parliament this week, the Serbian Prime Minister, Aleksandar Vučić, said, \"What used to have a total value of fifty million euros is now valued at 310 million euros thanks to Air Serbia. The plan is to offer a 25-year concession contract through a tender procedure\". While a formal decision is yet to be made on whether the airport will be fully privatised or put up for concession, Mr Vučić said the latter is \"almost certain\", noting that the process will be completed by mid-2017.\n\nSpeaking in parliament, Mr Vučić said, \"The 25-year concession agreement with an up-front payment will have a starting value of 310 million euros and an additional annual concession fee of ten, eleven or twelve million euros, which will be paid throughout the term of the concession. By mid-2017, the government plans to bring in a long-term partner for Belgrade Airport, which will be responsible for the its long-term development strategy including management, maintenance, financing and capacity expansion\". So far, within the former Yugoslavia, Zagreb, Pristina, Skopje and Ohrid airports have been given up for concession, while Ljubljana, Maribor and Portorož airports have been fully privatised.\n\nEight foreign companies are believed to be interested in taking part in Belgrade Airport's privatisation process. According to a recent report in the \"Večernje novosti\" daily, Germany's Fraport, France's Vinci and Bouygues, as well as two companies from the United Arab Emirates and three from China have expressed interest in participating in a potential concession. Commenting on its interest in Belgrade, Fraport, which operates the airport in Ljubljana, said, \"Fraport is a leading airport management company that successfully operates on four continents worldwide. We are continuously scanning the global market for potential opportunities - with the goal of expanding our international portfolio of airports and consulting activities\". Belgrade Airport handled 4.77 million passengers last year and posted a net profit of 26 million euros."
