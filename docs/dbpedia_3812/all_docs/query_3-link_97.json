Read about the styles and map projection used in the above map (Satellite Map of Lađevci).\n\nSatellite map\n\nSatellite map shows the Earth's surface as it really looks like. The above map is based on satellite images taken on July 2004. This satellite map of Lađevci is meant for illustration purposes only. For more detailed maps based on newer satellite and aerial images switch to a detailed map view.\n\nHillshading is used to create a three-dimensional effect that provides a sense of land relief. Shadows drawn on a map simulate the effects of sunlight falling across the surface of the landscape.\n\nGeographic map projection\n\nA map projection is a way how to transform points on a Earth to points on a map. This map of Lađevci uses Plate Carree projection. The Plate Carree projection is a simple cylindrical projection originated in the ancient times. It has straight and equally spaced meridians and parallels that meet at right angles.\n\nAll projections from a sphere to a plane are distorted. The drawback of the Plate Carree projection is that it doesn't make an attempt to compensate for these distortions. For the general view of Lađevci, this is not a significant problem. The detailed maps use the Mercator projection which preserves the shape of small areas better.\n\nTechnology\n\nWe unlock the value hidden in the geographic data. Thanks to automating the complex process of turning data into map graphics, we are able to create maps in higher quality, faster and cheaper than was possible before.\n\nForever free\n\nWe created Maphill to make the web a more beautiful place. Without you having to pay for it. Maphill maps are and will always be available for free.\n\nReal Earth data\n\nDo you think the maps are too beautiful not to be painted? No, this is not art.

You can copy, print or embed the map very easily. Just like any other image.\n\nDifferent perspectives\n\nThe value of Maphill lies in the possibility to look at the same area from several perspectives. Maphill presents the map of Lađevci in a wide variety of map types and styles.\n\nVector quality\n\nWe build each map individually with regard to the characteristics of the map area and the chosen graphic style. Maps are assembled and kept in a high resolution vector format throughout the entire process of their creation.\n\nExperience of discovering\n\nMaphill maps will never be as detailed as Google maps or as precise as designed by professional cartographers. Our goal is different. We want to redefine the experience of discovering the world through the maps.\n\nFast anywhere\n\nMaps are served from a large number of servers spread all over the world. Globally distributed map delivery network ensures low latency and fast loading times, no matter where on Earth you happen to be.\n\nSpread the beauty\n\nEmbed the above satellite map of Lađevci into your website.
