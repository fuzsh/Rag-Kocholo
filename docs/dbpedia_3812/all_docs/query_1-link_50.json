        "text": "FOCUSING on the past and present relations between Turkey and Serbia which dates back to early historical periods this book contains scientific evaluations on the shared history between the two peoples and manifests the importance of cooperation between the two countries for more peaceful and more prosperous Balkans. A number of academics and science people from different universities contributed to the book with their papers dealing with a range of issues about the changing dynamics in Turkish-Serbian relations. It seems that with the new regional and global parameters the two countries have proven to be the key players in the regional politics which is one of the things that makes the alliance between them more crucial\n\nTurkey has started to play a more active role in the Balkans since the early 1990s because of changes in both local agency and global structure. After coming to power in 2002, the Justice and Development Party AKP added further impetus to Turkish foreign policy towards the region by putting forward new actors and bringing in new issues. Business representatives, the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency TİKA, Yunus Emre Cultural Centers, the Presidency for Turks Abroad and Related Communities, Diyanet, and Turkish cities have become new actors in Turkey’s ties with the region. The article examines changes and continuities in Turkish foreign policy towards the Balkans under the government of the AKP. It first analyses the dilemmas of Turkey’s regional policies based on a case study of the Kosovo conflict and then examines the connection between domestic and foreign policy, thereby evaluating new actors and issues. The paper argues that there are challenges ahead and limitations to Turkey’s appeal to the region, resulting from the tilt towards unilateral policies.\n\nUnder the AKP government, Turkey’s foreign policy towards the Western Balkans, and Bosnia and Herzegovina in particular, has led many analysts to suspect it of possessing neo-imperial, or so-called neo-Ottoman, objectives. These suspicions have been compounded by the repeated declarations of former Prime Minister Davutoğlu and current President Erdoğan that the history and religious identity shared by Turks and Western Balkan Muslims forms the basis of both Turkish-Balkan relations and a common future. Critical examination of official Ankara’s attitudes toward the Western Balkans in general, and especially Bosnia and Herzegovina, identifies four distinct phases in which cultural, historical, and religious appeals morphed into the set of distinctive foreign policies. These policies have also been shaped by pragmatic pursuits of regional influence, the effects of internal (Turkish) transformations, and more recently, the ad hoc policies of President Erdoğan. This article will reconstruct the development of Turkish foreign policy since 1990, from multilateral and soft power efforts to religious and economic objectives, and will analyse the limits of this policy\n\nTurkey has started to play a more active role in the Balkans since the early 1990s because of changes in both local agency and global structure.

Turkey was one of those countries, which used its historical links with the region - especially with its Muslim population - to (re)establish itself as an important actor and power broker. Today, Turkey is perceived by Bosniaks and other Muslims in the Balkans in the way how Russia is perceived by Serbs and other Orthodox Christians in the region, that is a historic friend and important ally at the times of rising global tensions and uncertainty. Unlike Russia - which is almost exclusively linked with selected top Serb leaders - Turkey has from the very beginning established a much broader group of contacts in the region, which as of recently even includes top Serbian officials. Unlike Russia, Turkey has over the past two decades, expanded its operations in the Balkans to include numerous business, cultural, educational, academic and religious programs and projects. Yet just like Russia, all these Turkish efforts are made in this way to corroborate and strengthen Turkey's regional and global political presence. This background paper provides a brief historical overview of the main phases of Turkish domestic and corresponding foreign policies in the region, as well as basic details of Turkish relations with and operations in key Balkan countries.\n\nÖz This article argues that in the last decade there is a visible decline in the political, normative and economic power of the European Union (EU) as a dominant actor in the Western Balkans (WB).
