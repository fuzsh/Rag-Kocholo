        "text": "EX-YU airports handle 14.9 million passengers, one in Europe's top 100\n\nCommercial airports across the former Yugoslavia handled a combined total of 14.949.672 passengers during the first half of the year, with 3.95 million travellers in June alone. Among them, during the sixth month of the year, three airports stood out for their high growth rates. They include Sarajevo with a year-on-year increase in June of 51.2%, Zadar with 29.5% growth, and Tivat, which had a 27.4% boost in numbers. On the other hand, several regional airports underperformed during the month, including Tuzla, which saw an 78.9% slide in figures, Niš, which had 21.7% fewer passengers than in June 2023, and Ohrid, which shed 16.4% of its travellers year-on-year. A number of other airports also saw their figures decline compared to last year, among which are Skopje, Osijek, Rijeka and Kraljevo.\n\nPassenger performance by airport, June 2024\n\nDuring the January - June period, Belgrade Airport ranked as the 72nd busiest on the continent, just behind Palermo, Sofia, and Glasgow but ahead of Reykjavik, Ibiza and Larnaca. Zagreb positioned itself as the 103rd busiest, behind Tbilisi, Trondheim in Norway, and Wroclaw, but in front of Stavanger in Norway, Rome Ciampino, and Leeds. Pristina took 108th place. It was just behind East Midlands but ahead of the likes of Santiago de Compostela, Nuremberg, and London City. Skopje ranked 127th, with the Macedonian capital behind Cluj, Cork, and Chania but outperforming Tromso, Olbia, and Ponta Delgada. During the first half of the year, the Slovenian market was the fastest growing in the former Yugoslavia in percentile terms, increasing its overall figures by 21.5%. The market in Kosovo grew 20.5%, Croatia saw a 19.2% increase, Montenegro 15.6%, Serbia 11.2%, Macedonia 9%, while figures in Bosnia and Herzegovina declined 11.2%.\n\nPassenger performance by airport, H1 2024\n\nEuropean rank of select regional airports by passenger numbers\n\nThe majority of European markets saw year-on-year growth during the first half of the year. The exceptions were Russia (-16.8%) and Armenia (-1.8%). London Heathrow was once again Europe’s busiest airport over the six-month period, with 39.848.511 passengers, while Istanbul’s main gateway was second with 38.111.703 travellers. The pair saw growth of 7.4% and 6.9% on 2023 respectively. They were followed by Paris Charles de Gaulle with 33.189.584 passengers, Amsterdam with 31.801.387, Madrid with 31.695.441 travellers, Frankfurt with 28.753.818, Barcelona with 26.074.756, Rome Fiumicino with 22.566.014, London Gatwick with 19.923.345, and Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen with 19.835.915 passengers. Out of Europe’s top ten busiest, four are still below their pre-pandemic 2019 records. They include Paris Charles de Gaulle (-8.7%), Amsterdam (-7.9%), Frankfurt (-14.5%), and London Gatwick (-10.4%).\n\nLargest airlines by scheduled seat capacity across the former Yugoslavia, June 2024"
