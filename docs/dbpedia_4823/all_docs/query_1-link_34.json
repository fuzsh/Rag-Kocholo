Obey all signs and reserved meter bag instructions.\n\nRates & Payment\n\nThere is a standard rate of 30 minutes per dollar or 1.5 minutes per nickel, 3 minutes per dime, and 7.5 minutes per quarter. All meters accept credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Discover, & American Express), coins and the City of Charleston SmartCard. The SmartCard is an economical and convenient payment method for parking meters in the city of Charleston. It is similar to a merchant gift card: patrons pay a one-time charge of $5 for the card and purchase meter time that goes onto the card. These can be purchased at the Revenue Collections Parking Division office located at:\n\n180 Lockwood Boulevard\n\n2nd Floor\n\nCharleston, SC 29402\n\nWeekend parking rules along King Street\n\nStreet parking on King Street between Spring and John streets is prohibited from 6 p.m. to 3 a.m. on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights.\n\nAlternative, discounted parking for this area is available at the Visitor Center Garage, located at 63 Mary Street.

Additional parking at the $1 per half hour rate is available at the Midtown Garage (558 King Street) and Marion Square Garage (399 King Street).\n\nMalfunctioning & Broken Meters\n\nIf you see a malfunctioning or broken parking meter, it would be most helpful for you to report it to the Revenue Collections Parking Division office at 843-724-7375 or submit a request electronically through the Citizen Service Desk.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nFor additional parking information including an interactive map please download the ParkMe parking application on your iPhone or Android.\n\nDiscounted Evening Rates\n\n93 Queen Street: $7 flat rate fee after 3 p.m.; $5 flat rate fee after 5 p.m.\n\nEast Bay/Prioleau: $5 flat rate fee after 5 p.m.\n\nMajestic: $5 flat rate fee after 5 p.m.\n\nVisitor’s Center Garage Only: $7 flat rate fee after 3 p.m.; $5 flat rate fee after 5 p.m.\n\nDiscounted Evening Rates end at 3:00 AM at which time regular garage rates take effect.\n\nParking for People with Disabilities\n\nState Code 5 June 3, 1960, allows free parking for people with disabilities who have state-issued identification (either a placard or a handicap license plate) in metered or timed parking spaces. This includes Parking Meters, Garages, and Lots and only applies to City, County, and State-owned facilities. There are several garages and lots that are privately owned, and they do not offer free parking for people with disabilities.\n\nPlacard\n\nWhen parking at a metered space please be sure your placard is visible. It should either hang from the rear view mirror or be placed on the dashboard. When leaving a garage to receive free parking, you will be asked to show your disabled placard or identification.\n\nCharleston accepts disabled placards from other states. A disabled veteran license plate also qualifies for free parking. Please be aware that handicap placards or license plates do not allow parking in Commercial Loading Zones.\n\nParking Garage Height Clearances\n\nClick here for a PDF with information on height clearances for our garages.\n\nTour Bus Parking\n\nFor information (including parking locations map and permit requirements) regarding tour bus parking, including motor coaches and school, church and activity buses, please refer to the City’s Tourism Management Division’s webpage at: https://www.charleston-sc.gov/187/Bus-Tour-Parking-Permit-Application . Please note: Normal-sized school, church and activity buses are more than welcome to park at any of the locations designated on the map. Those three types of buses are exempt from having to obtain permits. Permits are required for motor coaches, regardless of ownership.\n\nBehavior in City Parking Facilities\n\nFor City ordinances applicable to behavior in City Parking Facilities, please see the following:\n\nSec. 21-108. - Loitering.\n\nhttps://library.municode.com/sc/charleston/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=CICO_CH21OF_ARTVOFAGPUPE_S21-108LO\n\nSec. 19-247. - Rules of conduct for city parking garages.\n\nhttps://library.municode.com/sc/charleston/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=CICO_CH19MOVETR_ARTVIIISTSTPA_DIV1GE_S19-247RUCOPAGA\n\nDiscretionary Garage Parking for City Residents at Determination of City\n\nAt times when the City determines it beneficial for the protection of property due to probable damage on account of imminent flooding or high winds, and solely as an emergency response measure and not as an ongoing public service, certain of the City of Charleston’s owned and/or operated public parking garages may be available for City residents to park vehicles, for free, but only during specifically prescribed times. The determination to implement such an emergency response measure, if made, will be at the discretion of the City and provided for City residents only. In such instances, rules and procedures will be prescribed - including No trailers, No golf carts, No boats, and No camping. If free parking for City residents is determined allowable by the City as an emergency response measure, the public will be notified through the City’s media outlets as to the specific City garages to be available and effective dates and times.\n\nNOTE: There are numerous parking garages located in the City of Charleston’s downtown area that are not owned and/or operated by the City of Charleston. Parking garage owners and operators in the downtown area include Charleston County, College of Charleston, Medical University of South Carolina, as well as several private parking companies and private facility owners. The City of Charleston has no jurisdictional authority to open such parking garages to the public as an emergency response measure.\n\nAdditional Questions"
