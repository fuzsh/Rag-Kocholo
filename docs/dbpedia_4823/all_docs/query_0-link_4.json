        "text": "What is industrial time?\n\nThe term \"industrial time\" refers to the way time is calculated and measured in an industrial setting. In an industrial setting, time is measured in minutes and seconds, not hours and minutes.\n\nIn industrial time, an hour is represented as 1 and a half hours as 1.5. The display is mainly used in operational working time documentation and is intended to support data management.\n\nThis system has the advantage that it measures more precisely how long work processes take. For example, if an employee is paid by the hour, their wages are based on the number of hours worked. However, their pay is more accurate if their pay is based on the number of minutes they worked.\n\nWhy is it calculated in industrial minutes?\n\nWorking time calculations are much easier than in real-time. For this reason, industrial time is important for recording working hours in many companies. The format documents the employees' daily working hours and their break times.\n\nThis system is less confusing and more accurate than other methods, such as B. Using a clock or stopwatch. Businesses using this format can ensure that they accurately represent their employees' working hours.\n\nWhat are the advantages of the industrial age?\n\nThe Industrial Age was a time of great change for mankind. It was a time when new technologies and ideas changed the way we live, work, and think. One of the most important changes has been the way we use and measure time.\n\nThe industrial age brought with it a new understanding of time and its meaning. People used to measure time according to the sun and the seasons. But with the advent of the industrial age, people began to understand that time could be measured more accurately and precisely.\n\nMost German companies use industry logs to record the working hours of their employees. The time data is easier to add and manage, which is why this is the preferred option. For things like payroll, all you have to do is add up the numerical values ​​and don't have to worry about decimal places or real minutes. Therefore, all modern time recording systems work with industrial time.\n\nThe Industrial Age value is best demonstrated with an example:\n\nReal time: 2 hours 32 minutes\n\nReal time: 1 hour 48 minutes\n\nReal time: 3 hours 39 minutes\n\nYou must first add up the perfect minutes to calculate the total hours worked using the real times provided. In this scenario, the end result would be a number greater than 60, so the second stage requires switching from traditional minutes to hours.\n\nSumming up the minutes above gives 119 actual minutes, equal to 1 hour and 59 minutes. You then calculate the actual hours and come up with six hours. This results in a total value of seven real hours and 59 real minutes. To illustrate, this conversion is much more tedious than other methods.\n\nIndustrial time in practice\n\nIndustrial time minutes are mainly used in time recording systems, payroll accounting, and working time calculation. It's much easier to do calculations. In addition to regular minutes, the working hours can be displayed with industry minutes in decimal form. The decimal places of the working time (working minutes) are not lost - they are extrapolated to 100.\n\nIndustrial Minutes with example values:\n\nReal Minutes = Decimal Hours / Industrial\n\nHours 30 seconds = 0.01\n\n1 minute = 0.02\n\n2 minutes = 0.03\n\n5 minutes = 0.08\n\n10 minutes = 0.17\n\n15 minutes = 0.25\n\n20 minutes = 0 .33\n\n45 minutes = 0.75\n\n60 minutes = 1\n\nMinutes and seconds: conversion at a glance\n\nThe typical times, for example, 3 hours and 45 minutes, cannot simply be added up. In the decimal form of working time, this time would be changed to 3.75 hours. The idea behind this calculation is:\n\nAn hour has 60 minutes.\n\nTo convert minutes to hours, divide by 60 (3 hours = 3 x 60 minutes = 180 minutes).\n\n45 minutes equals 0.75 hours (45/60 = 0.75).\n\nSo 3 hours and 45 minutes equal 3.75 hours.\n\nYou can use this approach to quickly convert minutes to their decimal hours equivalent.\n\nHow do you calculate industrial time?\n\nOnce you know the basics of arithmetic, figuring out industrial time is easy. You take the number of minutes and divide it by 60. This gives you the number of hours in decimal form.\n\nIndustrial time = real hours + real minutes/60\n\nSuppose you want to calculate industrial time for 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nYou would take 2 hours and divide by 60 which would give you 0.03 hours. Then you would take 30 minutes and divide by 60 which gives you 0.5 hours. Adding these two together gives you 0.53 hours of industrial time.\n\nWhen normal seconds are included, the calculation becomes more difficult. The formula for this is:\n\nindustrial time = real hours + real minutes/60 + real seconds/3600 Convert\n\nIndustrial time to standard time: How do you convert industrial minutes?\n\nSwitching from industrial to real-time is a bit more complicated. Note the following correspondences:\n\n0.25 = 15 minutes\n\n0.5 = 30 minutes\n\n0.75 = 45 minutes\n\nFor example, 4.75 real-time industrial hours is four hours and 45 minutes.\n\nWith an industry time of 5.38, you can take a different approach. The hours are transferred unchanged to real-time, i.e. initially ignored. However, to undo the previous calculation method, the industry minutes are multiplied by 60.\n\nActual Minutes = Industry Minutes x 60\n\nActual Minutes = 0.38 x 60 = 22.8 (about 23 Actual Minutes)\n\nThe actual minutes and hours are then added together. In this case, that's five hours and 23 minutes. In such cases, it is essential to round up or down.\n\nHow do you calculate decimal minutes?\n\nModern-time recording systems are used in a variety of industries. The difference between labor time and human effort is usually expressed in decimal format instead of the more common hour-based method. For example 8.75 industry hours instead of 8 hours and 45 minutes. Sometimes the term industrial minute is also used for decimal minutes.\n\nConclusion\n\nIndustrial time is a system that is mainly used for time recording and billing of wages and working hours. There are advantages to using this method, e.g. B. the ease of calculation and the ability to record decimal minutes. To convert from industrial to real-time or vice versa, a few simple steps need to be followed. Calculating industrial time will soon become second nature with practice."
