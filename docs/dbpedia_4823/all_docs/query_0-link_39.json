        "text": "What is FTCC’s federal school code?\n\nFTCC’s federal school code is 007640. Use this code on the FAFSA form so the results are sent to FTCC’s Financial Aid office.\n\nDo I need to apply for admission to FTCC before I apply for financial aid?\n\nNo. Applying for admission is not required before filing for aid; however, an admission application is required for other services at the College.\n\nHow do I apply for financial aid?\n\nThere are two ways to apply for financial aid: 1) Fill out the FAFSA online (preferred method), or 2) Request a paper FAFSA from the Department of Education by calling 1.800.433.3243\n\nMy parents are divorced. Whose income information do I use?\n\nUse the income of the parent for your current residence or the parent who most recently provided over 50% of your support.\n\nI don’t live with my parents or my parents don’t claim me on their tax returns. Do I still need to use their information on the FAFSA?\n\nYes. It does not matter if you live with them or not. If you do not meet the federal definition of an independent student, you are required to supply parent information on the FAFSA.\n\nMy parent is remarried. Do I need to use my step-parent’s income/tax information on the FAFSA?\n\nYes.\n\nI am separated from my spouse now. How do I file for financial aid?\n\nBring your federal tax return and W-2s to the Financial Aid Service Center in Room 2 of the Tony Rand Student Center. We can help you fill out your FAFSA form based on your information only. If you become separated after filing the FAFSA, please check with our office for correcting the information.\n\nI applied for financial aid at a different school, but now I want to attend FTCC. What do I do?\n\nFTCC’s Financial Aid office will need the FAFSA information submitted by the student in order to begin the process of financial aid eligibility determination. Students may either:\n\nGo to the FAFSA website and update the completed FAFSA with FTCC’s Federal School Code: 007640\n\nCall 1-800-433-3243 and request that FTCC’s school code is added.\n\nI’m attending another school for fall, but I want to transfer to FTCC in the spring. What do I do?\n\nYou can list FTCC as a school choice on the FAFSA so that we receive the information electronically. See process outlined in section five of the FAFSA.\n\nIs there a deadline for filing for financial aid?\n\nStudents can apply no sooner than October 1st of the current year and no later than June 30th of the upcoming academic year.\n\nWhy do I have to answer question 23 about drug convictions?\n\nSome students with drug-related convictions may be ineligible for federal student aid. For help answering question 23 on the FAFSA, Please call 1-800-4-FED-AID (1-800-433-3243) or go to www.fafsa.ed.gov.\n\nI lost my job, I am cutting my hours at work so I can attend school, or I am working a different job and making less money. How does this affect my aid?\n\nThe Financial Aid Office has a special consideration form for students to fill out when there is a dramatic change in income. It can significantly affect the amount of aid a student receives. Please contact our office for more information.\n\nHow long does it take for my financial aid to get on my account?\n\nThe student’s file must be complete and awarded before aid can be applied to a student’s account. Available aid is applied toward the beginning of each semester. Direct Loan payments may be disbursed at a later date.\n\nIf I’m selected for verification, do you need my state and city income tax return?\n\nWe do not need your state and city income tax returns. IRS Transcripts for Federal tax returns and IRS Wage Transcripts will be required for the verification process if students choose not to use the IRS Data Retrieval function when submitting the FAFSA application. Copies of tax returns and W-2s will no longer be accepted. Additional documents needed to complete the student’s file may be requested.\n\nWhat is an award letter and what do I do with it?\n\nThe award letter notifies you about the type and amount of aid you are eligible to receive. You do not need to return the award letter to our office unless you are declining aid or decreasing a loan amount.\n\nWhat is my electronic master promissory note?\n\nThe Electronic Master Promissory Note (EMPN) is the signed legal document stating you will repay your William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan.\n\nHow much can I borrow?\n\nA dependent student with less than 31 credit hours completed may borrow $5,500, if eligible. A dependent student with more than 30 credit hours completed may borrow $6,500, if eligible. Independent students may borrow up to an additional $4,000, if eligible.\n\nWhat is the difference between subsidized and unsubsidized loans?\n\nFor a Direct Subsidized Loan, the interest is paid by the federal government while you are attending school at least half-time or during grace or deferment periods. For a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, interest begins to accumulate on the day the loan is disbursed to your account and continues until the loan is paid in full.\n\nHow does my loan get credited to my account?\n\nAll loans are disbursed in three installments. For a one-semester loan the first portion is disbursed at the beginning of the semester, another mid-semester, and the remaining amount towards the end of the semester. A one-year loan (two-semesters) is disbursed half in the first semester and half in the second semester.\n\nWhat is a disclosure notice?\n\nA Disclosure Notice is mailed directly from the Loan Servicing Center to notify the student of anticipated disbursement dates and the amounts. Contact the Direct Loan Servicing Center at 1-800-848-0979.\n\nWhen can I charge books and supplies in the bookstore against my financial aid?\n\nBooks and supplies may be charged during the posted dates at the beginning of each semester as long as there is a pending financial aid award on the system and the books are available in the bookstore. All funds are to be used responsibly when purchasing books and supplies at the bookstore. Funds are to be used only for the aid recipient for classes registered and not used to purchase books and supplies for family and friends."
