        "text": "Welcome to the Omni money weight calculator, a simple tool that calculates how much a certain amount of money would weigh in the different dollar bills or coin denominations. üí∞\n\nHave you ever wondered how much one million dollars would weigh if you were to collect it with one-dollar bills? Or how much money would you have if you collected 20 pounds worth of quarters? Before you break your piggy bank, come along to learn about:\n\nSome facts about the United States Dollar;\n\nHow much do dollar bills weigh;\n\nHow much do coins weigh;\n\nHow much do a million dollars weigh;\n\nand more! ‚öñÔ∏è\n\nNow that you know how much different domination of the U.S. dollar weighs, let's answer the billion-dollar question, how much does a billion dollars weigh?\n\nIt depends. Is the amount in coins or paper bills? Which denominations are at hand? For example, one billion dollars in $100 bills (1 gram each) would weigh 10 tons ‚Äî approximately 22,046 pounds. If you were to weigh one billion dollars in 50 cent coins (11.34 g each), it would weigh approximately 22,680 tons. That bag of coins would be nine times heavier than the heaviest object ever weighed: the revolving service structure of the launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nUsing the money weight calculator is very simple! All you need to do is enter the dollar amount of interest, and the money weight calculator will then tell you how much that amount would weigh in various dollar bills or coin denominations. üíµ\n\nYou can also use the calculator backward! If you want to know the amount of money by weight, you can indicate the weight of the dollar domination of your interest, and our magic tool will give you results!\n\nKnowing how much does money weigh is great, but knowing how to manage it is even better.
