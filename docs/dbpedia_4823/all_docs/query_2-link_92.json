        "text": "WASHINGTON — “I don't deal with women,” the businessman snapped at Maria Hallam, who with her husband Keith was trying to buy a refrigeration unit for their new delicatessen in Burke. Va.\n\nThe Hallams struck back a few days later. By way of a lesson in feminism, they paid the surly Washington restaurant supplier in $3,000 worth of sparkling, newly minted $1 coins bearing the determined features of Susan B. Anthony, the 19th‐century women's rights activist.\n\nThe Hallams may have found a pertinent use for the coins but many other Americans haven't. Miss Anthony is having as rough a time breaking into the pockets and purses of America as she did breaking down its political processes 100 years earlier. Despite years of study akin to a corporation's strategy for marketing a new product, the Treasury came up with a coin that few seem to want. The big complaint, people say, is that it can easily be mistaken for a quarter.\n\nMore than half a billion have been minted in two months, but big retailers like Sears, Roebuck & Company and Bloomingdale's report virtually no usage in their outlets “We average three or four of the coins a day,” said Robert McMillan, director of public relations at Abraham & Straus. “Where are they?”\n\nApparently, many are stacked up in banks. “We stopped ordering the coins completely two or three weeks ago because we had so many in stock,” said a spokesman for the First National Bank of Chicago.\n\nOne major backer of the coin, Representative Mary Rose Oakar, an Ohio Democrat, says that the coin isn't getting a fair shake. “Essentially, what we are seeing is that those in a position to distribute the coin and some of the media didn't give it a chance,” she said. “They would not allow change.”\n\nOfficials at the Treasury are wondering now if the only way to insure the coin's success is to pull George Washington's dollar bill from the market — a move guaranteed to create instant furor.\n\nMeanwhile, the dollar coins roll out. Plans call for 1.3 billion to be minted by next April. In an attempt to block them from going the way of the Edsel and other examples of classic marketing failures, the Treasury is gearing up a campaign complete with public relations consultants. It has hired a New York firm, DWJ Associates, and has also come up with a colorful brochure titled “The Dollar of the Future,” which includes a plea from W. Michael Blumenthal (before he was ousted as Treasury Secretary) to help in “assuring ready acceptance of the coin.” The brochure points out that the new coin is “easy to hear if dropped” and that “unlike bills, [it] won't stick together when new, or tear when old.”\n\nIn addition, there will be a television promotion campaign in October, and Stella B. Hackel, director of the Mint, will tour the country saying good things about the metal dollar.\n\nIt has not been easy for the Bureau of the Mint, the department of the Treasury responsible for coinage. Memories linger of the poor showing of the Eisenhower dollar, the Kennedy 50‐cent piece and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing's $2 bill, which was revived to commemorate the bicentennial only to vanish soon after.\n\nMrs. Hackel, however, is a firm believer in the dollar coin. “It's resistance to change,” she says of the public's unfavorable reaction. “This is going to be a successful coin because it's a useful item. It makes sense.”\n\nBut still many consumers are asking why the Government brought out a dollar coin that looks like a quarter. Hardly any other question so raises Mrs. Hackel's hackles.\n\n“Look, look. They're not alike!” she said. She reached into her change purse, coming up with a handful of the three‐tenths of an ounce, 1.04 inch diameter samples. “Look at them. They're not like quarters.”\n\nMrs. Hackel picked one slut and balanced it in her palm. “It's 43 percent heavier,” she said. “It has a raised inner border. There's a woman on the face instead of a man. They're just not alike.”\n\nAnd she's right, of course. She could have added that its size in relationship to a quarter is the same as that of a quarter to a nickel — and Americans can tell the difference between those two coins. And she could have added that a $1 bill and a $100 bill have the same texture, color and size.\n\nBut people still point to the similarity in size to a quarter as a major reason for the coin's apparent inability to gain favor. A bill has already been introduced in the House to change the size and weight of the Anthony dollar back to that of the old Eisenhower coin, which weighed in at three times the new dollar,\n\n“Basically, they made it the same way as the quarter,” said Lew Norwood, director of affiliate relations at the National Association of Retail Grocers, who predicted that the Anthony coin would go the same way as the $2 bill. And Stephen Lalli, a communications assistant at the National Restaurant Association, said that “Generally it's not being well accepted. They're getting mixed up with quarters.”\n\nWhere all the coins are is a matter of debate. Half of them, according to Mrs. Hackel, are somewhere between the Mint, which makes them, and the Federal Reserve, which distributes them. The Mint also projects that 100 million of them have been saved and collected. As to the final 200 million, the majority are probably still stashed in banks.\n\nThe history of the Anthony coin goes back four or five years, said Alan J. Goldman, assistant director of the Mint's office of technology. After a suggestion for a dollar coin by the then Deputy Secretary of Treasury, Stephen Gordon, Treasury officials went abroad to find out what size coins were most popular. Congressional subcommittees held debates to check the Treasury's findings. The Mint gathered the opinions of 15 of some of the nation's largest retailers, such as Sears and McDonald's, which would be in the forefront of any change.\n\n“It was a trend that was happening everywhere,” said Dr. Goldman. “With inflation, the value of the highest denomination coin and the value of the lowest denomination note have been increasing.”\n\nThe Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which produces paper currency, has been having trouble keeping up with the demand for the dollar, which has been increasing by 8 to 10 percent a year. Without an alternative, it would need a $100 million expansion. And the economics are all for a coin dollar. While it costs 3 cents to produce the Anthony dollar, compared with 2 cents for the paper dollar, the coins last 15 or more years, almost 10 times the lifetime expected of a greenback. If the coin were to replace the bill, savings as high as $50 million are estimated.\n\nOne of the first of the studies, published in August 1976, was a Treasury Department report on the technical considerations of a new, smaller dollar coin which set the parameter of the Anthony dollar.\n\n“The principal reason the Eisenhower dollar is not widely used is its large size and heavy weight,” the report said. It concluded that a coin 26.5 millimeters in diameter — the size of the Anthony dollar — would be most suitable, with anything smaller too close to a quarter and anything larger approaching the half dollar.\n\nThe Treasury next needed to determine how the public would receive such a change.\n\nThat, to a limited extent, was the subject of a major study of the United States coinage system prepared for the Treasury by the Research Triangle Institute, near Raleigh, N.C.\n\nThat report, which recommended the termination of the penny by 1980 and the elimination of the Kennedy half dollar, also recommended a dollar coin.\n\nIt warned, however, that a survey of business and banking interests showed little enthusiasm. “In general,” the report concluded, “the retail sales, banking, and automatic merchandising in dustry respondents expressed their desire to maintain the status quo with respect to the U.S. coinage system.”\n\nIt was almost two and a half years later, months after the Susan B. Anthony Coin Act of 1978 was signed into law by President Carter, that another report would back up the findings of the Research Triangle Institute.\n\nIn an independent study of the dollar coin commissioned by the Federal Reserve Bank, Claude R. Martin Jr. of the University of Michigan warned, that for the coin to be a success, “The $1 bill must be withdrawn from circulation. At no time did we find a participant in the currency system that felt the $1 coin and the $1 bill could successfully co‐exist.”\n\nMrs. Hackel, when asked why the report was apparently ignored, responded: “That's his research project, period. It may or may not be valid.”"
