        "text": "Parking and Train Stations\n\nThe Village has a new electronic parking meter system at the Oak Park Avenue and 80th Avenue train stations that uses real-time data tracking to allow for better management of parking spaces and resources.\n\nCommuters can pay with cash, coin or credit card at a parking kiosk, or on an Apple or Android smartphone using the Passport parking app. In conjunction with the changeover, parking increased from $1.50 to $2.\n\nParking on weekends and after 10 a.m. on weekdays will continue to be free. Parking permits will no longer be issued, and all lots will now be daily pay.\n\nThree Easy Ways to Pay\n\n1. Paying with Passport App\n\nDownload the Passport app on Apple store or Google Play.\n\nYou can find a QR code linking to the Passport app on parking signs and decals at both stations.\n\nAfter parking, enter:\n\nZone + vehicle or space\n\nDate of stay\n\nPayment information\n\nThrough the app, you can also get parking session alerts and extend parking session remotely! See this how-to video for more information.\n\n2. Paying with Cash/Coin at onsite Kiosks\n\nPlease use exact change only, as the kiosk will not give change.\n\nEnter your license plate number and press the green button.\n\nInsert cash in the dollar or coin slot and press the green button.\n\nReceive your payment receipt.\n\n3. Paying with Credit Card at onsite Kiosks\n\nEnter your license plate number and press the green button.\n\nInsert and quickly remove your credit card, and then press the green button.\n\nReceive your payment receipt.\n\nParking Zones\n\nThe Oak Park Avenue and 80th Avenue train stations will be divided into zones that commuters will input when parking. Note that all lots will now be daily pay. These zones include:\n\n80th Avenue Station\n\n60477 – 80th Avenue North\n\n18001 S. 80th Avenue Tinley Park, IL, 60477\n\n60478 – 80th Avenue South\n\n7835 Timber Drive, Tinley Park, IL 60477\n\nOak Park Avenue Station\n\n60476 – Harmony Plaza Lot/Zone (formerly known as the “Subway Lot/Lot F”)\n\n17220 S. 67th Court\n\n60475 – OPA Lot/Zone A\n\n6721 North Street\n\n60474 – OPA Lot/Zone B\n\n6726 South Street (includes the parking along Hickory Street)\n\n60479 – OPA Lot/Zone C\n\n6700 South Street\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhen will the new parking system start?\n\nCommuters can start using the new system on April 1, 2024. The old payboxes will be removed on May 1, 2024.\n\nI don’t like using apps. Can I pay with credit cards or cash?\n\nYes, the new meters will accept various payment methods such as coins and credit cards in addition to the mobile app. Please keep in mind that the machines can’t make change, so bring exact amount ($1 bills and/or coins).\n\nI have a bunch of parking tokens. Can I return them for a refund or credit?\n\nYes, commuters will be able to exchange old parking tokens for credits on the parking app. To begin the process, fill out this form and bring it with you Mondays through Fridays at the Tinley Park Village Hall, 16250 S. Oak Park Ave., or the Tinley Park Police Department. Call Tinley Park Village Hall at (708) 444-5000 or email parking@tinleypark.org for more information. Token trade-ins will be available until Jun 1, 2024.\n\nIs there free parking?\n\nYes, the Village will continue to offer free parking on weekends and after 10 a.m. on weekdays.\n\nWill lots ever be closed?\n\nYes, occasionally a few of the lots will close for things like special events. Commuters will be notified of these closings in advance through the app or via messaging posted at parking kiosks. There will be no overnight parking in the North Oak Park Avenue lot.\n\nWhy the increase from $1.50 to $2?\n\nThe parking system should be an enterprise fund, which means it pays for itself, but currently it isn’t. The Village made the tough decision to raise parking rates, something it hasn’t done since the 1990s.\n\nWhat are the different parking zones at each station?\n\nThe Oak Park Avenue and 80th Avenue train stations will be divided into zones that commuters will input when parking. These zones include:\n\n80th Avenue Station\n\nNorth (60477)\n\nSouth (60478)\n\nOak Park Avenue station\n\nHarmony Plaza (60476)\n\nZone A (60475)\n\nZone B (60474)\n\nZone C (60479)\n\nHandicapped Parking Permits\n\nPermanent Placard\n\n(blue or license plates - more than 6 months)\n\nTemporary Placard\n\n(red - less than 6 months)\n\nTinley Park Metra Commuter Train Stations\n\nTinley Park is located near Interstate 80 and Interstate 57, offering easy travel to Chicago and neighboring states.
