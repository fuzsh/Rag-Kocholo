        "text": "How do you calculate interest on a savings account?\n\nA savings account has an Annual Percentage Yield (APY), which reflects your account’s current interest rate and the effect of interest compounding. Compounding interest essentially means you’re earning “interest on interest”, so your money grows at a faster rate than with simple interest. Depending on how often it’s compounded at your financial institution (e.g. monthly or daily), your total interest earned will be slightly higher.\n\nHow much will my savings account earn?\n\nThe amount your savings account grows depends on a few factors, including your balance, length of time and the APY of the account. If your savings account has a higher APY, then you will earn more interest on your money. Additionally, if you are regularly contributing to your savings account (paying yourself first), you will have the opportunity to earn more on your growing funds.\n\nHow can I open a savings account?\n\nOpening a savings account online is easy. Review our savings account options to determine which account best meets your needs, and then click Open Now. You can also open an account at your local Dollar Bank office or call 1-800-242-2265 and press 4, Monday – Friday from 8:00 AM – 8:00 PM and Saturday from 9:00 AM – 3:00 PM.\n\nWhat is the current interest rate on a savings account?\n\nView the current rates for our savings accounts\n\nWhat to ask when opening a savings account?\n\nWhen opening a savings, account, make sure you understand what the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) is, and any restrictions associated with that particular account. Are there any monthly fees? Is there a minimum balance requirement? Is there anything you need to do to maintain a certain APY? Are there any withdrawal restrictions? Also, if you don’t already have a checking account with the financial institution, check to see if there would be value in opening one (e.g. to make transferring money into your savings account easy).\n\nHow long does it take to open a savings account?\n\nOpening a savings account can be a quick process that you can do from the comfort of your home in as little as 10 minutes. Make sure you have all the information you need to open your account (e.g. Driver’s License and card to fund your account) before you begin.\n\nWhy should I open a savings account?\n\nA savings account is an important tool for keeping your spending money (checking account) separate from your saved funds. Opening a savings account benefits you as putting savings in a different account makes it easier to avoid overspending and instead focus on growing those funds for your financial goals."
