        "text": "Even before cannabis legalization and to this day in areas of the country where it’s still a little less than legal, legitimate entrepreneurs and street pharmacists alike have standard weed measurements. Whether you’re familiar with the recognized quantities or only have a passing familiarity, we’re here to help you understand how weed is measured in terms that are easy to understand.\n\nA Visual Guide to Weed Measurements\n\nAmericans, anywhere else you travel in the world you might come across a mysterious system of measurement far unlike anything you’ve encountered here at home. Yes, friends… the metric system. A simple system of measurement based on factors of 10, most of the world uses it to measure length, volume, and weight. In most dispensaries, you’ll also find measurements from the imperial system in ounces, which is a standard unit of measurement for weight still used almost exclusively in the US. Let’s break down the different weed measurements and find out how much they really weigh.\n\nThe Gram\n\nGenerally, a gram is the smallest unit of everyday measure found in the rest of the world and is equal to one-thousandth of a kilogram. Someone looking to purchase cannabis in very small amounts, someone who has never tried it before, or someone looking to experiment with a new strain might start with a gram.\n\nHow Big is a Gram of Weed?\n\nA gram of weed weighs about the same as a paper clip, a dollar bill, or a cheap Bic pen cap. So it’s not much. It’s the amount of weight you would never notice, but it’s a foundational measure for anyone using the metric system, and a perfect starting amount for anyone new to cannabis.\n\nAn Eighth\n\nIf you have a passing familiarity with anything cannabis, you’ve probably heard of an eighth. You may have also heard it called a slice, a half-quarter, or a cut. It refers to one-eighth of an ounce and is one of the most common quantities of weed you can buy.\n\nHow Big Is an Eighth of Weed?\n\nAn eighth of an ounce is equivalent to 3.5 grams. For comparison, a US penny weighs right at 3 grams, so we are still not talking about a significant amount.\n\nHowever, with larger amounts of weed, there is the possibility that it will dry out if not properly kept. Most cannabis enthusiasts find that an eighth is just the right amount to feel like you have enough cannabis, but not that you have to rush before it ages. With DogWalker’s Mini-Dog Pre-Rolls, you’re getting a total of 1.75g of premium flower in five .35g pre-rolls, right at half an eighth, but conveniently packaged to make your experience an easy one. At .75g per roll, four Big Dog Pre-Rolls would equal an eighth of weed.\n\nA Quarter\n\nA quarter refers to one-quarter of an ounce and contains approximately 7 grams of weed. When you go into a dispensary and have your budtender measure out a quarter for you, don’t be alarmed if the measurement is a little over 7 grams, a quarter weighs 7.0874g, but the industry standard is to round down to the nearest whole gram.\n\nHow Big is a Quarter of Weed?\n\nSince a quarter is double the size of an eighth, it is a slightly more significant amount of weed. 7 grams is nearly equal to the weight of a US dollar coin. A quarter of weed is generally for more enthusiastic smokers who will go through the amount more quickly before it has time to age.\n\nA Half\n\nA half-ounce of weed, which is 14 grams, isn’t nearly as common as either an eighth or a quarter. For someone who smokes a gram a day, a half-ounce will last two to three weeks if properly kept.\n\nHow Big is a Half Ounce of Weed?\n\n14 grams is a more significant weight, but still not very heavy. An empty aluminum soda can weighs about 14 grams. In some circles, a half-ounce of weed is known as a half zip. You’ll understand why shortly.\n\nAn Ounce\n\nA full ounce, in most jurisdictions, is the legal limit any one person can possess at any time for personal consumption. Anything over this amount is generally considered enough for intent to distribute, which is a no-no even in states where marijuana is decriminalized.\n\nHow Big is an Ounce of Weed?\n\nOne ounce of weed is 28.3 grams, but as per the industry standard is generally rounded down to 28 grams. Your budtender can typically only sell up to a full ounce. Any quantity over one ounce is illegal for an individual to have in most states. For reference, 28 grams is roughly equal to the weight of a CD (remember those?) or a single AA battery.\n\nA Pound\n\nA pound of weed, these days, is almost exclusively for distributors and business owners. A pound of cannabis is exactly what you think it is, a very large amount of weed.\n\nHow Big is a Pound of Weed?\n\nA pound is equal to 453 grams. You’d think that if there are 16 ounces in a pound that it would equal out to 448 grams, but with grams being metric and pounds being imperial, the discrepancy comes from the difference in the exact weight of a gram versus an ounce.\n\nBack to blog"
