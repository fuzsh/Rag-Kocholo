        "text": "Time and a half definition\n\nTime and a half refers to an increased rate of pay typically reserved for hours worked overtime or those that exceed the 40-hour work week.\n\nOvertime pay policies vary between companies, with time and a half being a common rate in many industries, including retail, care work, and construction.\n\nIt simply means that in addition to the employee’s standard hourly rate, they will get paid an additional one half of that rate for each hour worked in the time and a half window.\n\nWhat does time and a half mean for employers?\n\nAlthough it means that they will be surrendering more to payroll, they are also giving acknowledgment of the value of their employees’ time and incentivizing hard work – both marks of a good employer.\n\nHow to calculate time and a half:\n\nTime and a Half Rate = Hourly Rate x 1.5\n\nAssume an employee earns $20 hourly during a 40-hour work week. Their time and a half pay would be $20 x 1.5 for a total of $30 an hour.\n\nWhen does time and a half apply?\n\nTime and a half applies when an employee exceeds 40 hours during a workweek.\n\nSome states have laws requiring time and a half for employees working more than 8 hours.\n\nWorking on holidays is not regarded as working overtime. This includes bank holidays such asLabor Day, Independence Day, Easter, Memorial Day, New Year’s Day, and Christmas.\n\nWith respect to religious holidays, company policy must be issued consistently without discrimination.\n\nProviding holidays off can help establish more amicable relationships between staff, and may promote a better work-life balance for employees.\n\nEmployers: Make sure your payroll is managed accurately with these 4 quick tips.\n\nSee also:\n\nOvertime definition\n\nWhat is gross pay and net pay?\n\nUnderstanding pay runs\n\nBoss your payroll with Sage\n\nWith Sage 50cloud you can simplify your payroll processes for your employees with direct deposit, paycards, or direct-deposit checks.1"
