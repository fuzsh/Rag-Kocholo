        "text": "Divide paper into US dollar bill proportions\n\nThe US dollar bill is approximately 2.6 inches x 6.1 inches, which is a 1:2.35 ratio. You can measure this and cut your paper to size accordingly. Or you can use the technique below to cut your regular square origami paper into approximately the US dollar bill size. The paper will have the same ratio as the US dollar bill.\n\nDivide Square Paper into US Dollar bill Step 1: Start with a 6 inch x 6 inch (15 cm x 15cm) square origami paper, color side down. (You can use the same steps for a 8.5 inch x 11 inch paper as well)\n\nFold paper in half on the diagonal axis. Crease well.\n\nDivide Square Paper into US Dollar bill Step 2: Fold the top layer back to meet the diagonal edge on the right. Crease well.\n\nDivide Square Paper into US Dollar bill Step 3: Unfold paper.\n\nDivide Square Paper into US Dollar bill Step 4: Make a horizontal valley fold as shown.\n\nDivide Square Paper into US Dollar bill Step 5: Make a horizontal mountain fold as shown.\n\nDivide Square Paper into US Dollar bill Step 6: Unfold paper and cut it as shown.\n\nYou have divided your paper into 3 sections. The first 2 rectangles are in the same approximate proportions as the US dollar. The top narrow portion can be discarded.\n\nYou're now able to use these 2 rectangle paper to fold the dollar origami models."
