        "text": "Lesson Plan - Get It!\n\nWhen writing amounts of money, two forms can be used: cents and dollars.\n\nTo write cents, use a cent sign and do not use a decimal point. A quarter is worth 25 cents or 25¢.\n\nTo write dollars, use a decimal point and dollar sign: $1.00.\n\nA decimal point is also used to show fractions of a dollar. A fraction is part of a whole, so a fraction of a dollar is part of a dollar. A quarter, or $0.25, means twenty-five hundredths of a dollar, which is a fraction of a dollar equal to 25 cents.\n\nLook at each coin below and say its value out loud.\n\nNow, look at the chart below to see the value of each coin and its fraction of a dollar. Think about how many parts — the coin — equal a whole — dollar.\n\nCoin Name Value Fraction of a Dollar penny 1¢ $0.01 1 100 nickel 5¢ $0.05 5 100 dime 10¢ $0.10 10 100 quarter 25¢ $0.25 25 100\n\nUse the chart to answer these questions.\n\nNext, work through these questions.\n\nGreat work!\n\nLook back at Jenny, who has two quarters, and Paul, who has five dimes.\n\nWhich friend has the most coins?\n\nYes! Paul has five coins.\n\nBut who has the most money?\n\nThat's right! They have the same amount.\n\nJenny 2 quarters = $0.25 + $0.25 = $0.50 $0.50 = 50 2 quarters = 25 + 25 = 50 100 100 100 100\n\nPaul 5 dimes = $0.10 + $0.10 + $0.10 + $0.10 + $0.10 = $0.50 $0.50 = 50 5 dimes = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 100 100 100 100 100 100 100\n\nReview what you have learned with the following video.\n\nMove on to the Got It? section to practice using fractions of a dollar."
