        "text": "A: To change your mailing address, Old National offers several options:\n\nWithin Online Banking, go to Contact Us. Click on Secure Email and then Click Here to Send an Email. From here, you can send us a message requesting the change.\n\nYou may visit any Old National banking center and provide an updated photo ID or utility bill that contains the new address.\n\nDownload a Personal Address Change Form or Business Address Change Form that you can mail to Old National.\n\nFor Health Savings Accounts, download an HSA Address Change Form that you can mail or fax to Old National.\n\nTo change your phone number or email address:\n\nWithin Online Banking, go to My Settings and click Edit next to either your phone number or email address to update this information. You may also visit any Old National banking center or call Client Care at 1-800-731-2265.\n\nPlease note that changes can only be applied to the information for the person requesting the change. If there are additional people listed on the account, those individuals will need to request updates for their own information.\n\nWhen will my deposit be available?\n\nFunds deposited to your account will be available to you, based on several factors we have listed below.\n\nA check written from an account at a bank other than Old National:\n\nWill not be available until the next business day (if it was deposited by the close of business and there are no holds placed on the checks). This means these funds will not be available to cover checks or other debits processed that night. An extended hold also may be needed. You will be notified if an extended hold is placed on the deposit.\n\nA check written from an account at Old National:\n\nWill be added to your account and will have same-day availability (if it was deposited by the close of business). This means these funds will be available to cover checks or other debits processed that night.1\n\nCash or Direct Deposit (e.g. payroll, Social Security):\n\nWill be available the same day as deposit.1\n\n1 Deposits of this type made at an ATM prior to daily cutoff times are credited to your account and available to cover checks or other debits being processed that night.\n\nA: Your Current Balance shows the amount of money in your account at the end of the previous day (after deposits, withdrawals, and ATM and debit card transactions). This includes only transactions that have cleared.\n\nYour Available Balance is your Current Balance minus any holds, uncollected deposits and transactions received but not yet processed by Old National, which may include certain ATM or debit card transactions. It also does not include checks you have written but have not been presented by the recipients.\n\nPlease refer to our Deposit Account Agreement and Disclosure for more information about the timing and order of transactions we use to calculate your account balance at the end of each day.\n\nIf you have questions, please call Client Care at 1-800-731-2265 or visit any Old National banking center.\n\nA: If there is not enough of an available balance in your account to cover a withdrawal or payment presented against your account, an overdraft will occur and fees may be assessed. These are called NSF fees or overdraft fees. You may also hear the term \"insufficient funds\" used.\n\nAn NSF fee is charged when a checking account is overdrawn causing a negative balance at the end of the previous business day. NSF fees are always charged the day after the overdraft occurs. You can avoid NSF fees by making a deposit to bring your account to a positive balance by the end of the business day.\n\nFor specific details regarding an overdraft, or to sign up for overdraft coverage, please visit any Old National banking center or call Client Care at 1-800-731-2265.\n\nA: In an effort to help you avoid returned checks or declined transactions, we provide protection services called Overdraft Courtesy and Overdraft Protection. These two services can also be used together for extra protection. Learn more about our Overdraft Solutions\n\nOverdraft Courtesy\n\nMost Old National checking accounts come with Overdraft Courtesy. With Overdraft Courtesy, even if you don’t have enough available money in your checking account, we may still approve and pay checks you’ve written, as well as ACH and recurring debit card transactions (such as utility bills). Overdraft Courtesy does not cost anything unless you use it. If your account becomes overdrawn by more than $25, we will charge you a $36 fee for each overdraft item, up to 2 per day. You are responsible for paying the amount of any overdraft on your account immediately. If your account is overdrawn 7 or more consecutive business days, we will charge a $7 Daily Overdraft fee each business day the account is overdrawn by more than $25 (beginning on day 7), for up to 5 business days.\n\nOverdraft Protection\n\nOverdraft protection allows you to link your account to another Old National account. If you accidentally overdraft, we will draw the funds from your linked account. There is no annual fee for the Overdraft Protection service, and you can link to other Old National checking, savings, or money market accounts or a line of credit. The transfer amount will be the exact amount needed to cover the total overdraft amount at the end of each business day, provided your linked account has a sufficient available balance. If sufficient funds are not available in your linked account, we will transfer what is available. Any items not covered by the funds in your linked account will be paid or returned at the Bank’s discretion and applicable overdraft and other account fees may be charged.\n\nFor business analysis accounts, an Overdraft Protection Transfer Fee of $5 is charged for each transfer from your linked account.\n\nTo sign up for Overdraft Protection, or for more information about either service, please visit any Old National Banking or call Client Care at 1-800-731-2265.\n\nA: When you pay with your debit card, you may have a “pre-authorization hold” added to your account before the actual charge goes through. Businesses do this to make sure you have the funds available to cover the purchase, especially when the total amount is unknown at the time you use your card.\n\nFor example, when you swipe your card before pumping gas, a pre-authorization hold is put on your account for an amount that’s probably going to be higher than what you’ll actually spend. When you reserve a hotel room, a hold is placed on the account for the cost of the room, plus a little more in case you have additional services during your stay. When you pay for your meal at a restaurant, a hold may be placed for the cost of the meal plus extra for the possible tip. Once the actual amount is known, that number becomes the charge. And once the charge clears your account (typically during the bank’s evening processing), the pre-authorization hold is released.\n\nPre-authorization holds often can be considerably higher than what you will actually pay, and may stay on your account for a while (days, in some situations) so be sure you are prepared for this amount to be “on hold” in your account in the interim. Remember, you won’t have access to the excess funds until after the actual charge clears and the pre-authorization is released.\n\nExample: Joe visits a gas station and swipes his debit card before pumping his gas. The business doesn’t know how much gas Joe will pump, but it assumes the charge will be $50 or under. They place a pre-authorization hold on Joe’s card for $50 to ensure the funds are available. Joe pumps $20 worth of gas. That means there now is an extra $30 on hold in Joe’s account, and he will not have access to that money until the $20 charge clears and the $50 pre-authorization hold is released.\n\nIf you have questions, call Client Care at 1-800-731-2265.\n\nA: Your debit card will continue to work until the last day of its expiration month. You should automatically receive a replacement card around the third week of the month that your card is set to expire.\n\nTo protect against potential card theft, your card will arrive in an unmarked, white envelope that does not display the Old National name or logo. Please watch your mail carefully to avoid accidentally discarding it.\n\nIf you have not received your new card by the end of the expiration month, please call Client Care at 1-800-731-2265, Option 2, or visit any Old National banking center for assistance.\n\nPlease note that if you have not used your card in the past 12 months, or we do not have a correct address on file for you, this may prevent you from automatically receiving a replacement card.\n\nA: If you notice unauthorized debit card activity on your statement or through Online and Mobile Banking, you can turn your debit card off right away using our Card Controls. Card Controls is a feature you can access at any time in Digital Banking including within the ONB Mobile App.\n\nYou should also contact us at 1-800-731-2265 to report the unauthorized activity on your debit card. We can then cancel or restrict your card, check for other unauthorized transactions and order a new card for you.\n\nIf your debit card has been lost or stolen, you can report it 24-hours a day by calling 1-800-731-2265, option 2, in the US. If you are outside of the US, call 1-812-422-2197.\n\nA: You can report your lost or stolen Old National debit card 24-hours a day by calling 1-800-731-2265, option 2, in the US. If you are outside of the US, call 1-812-422-2197. We can cancel or restrict your debit card, check for unauthorized transactions and order a new debit card for you.\n\nIf you notice unauthorized activity on your debit card through Digital Banking, you can turn your card off right away with the Card Controls feature in Online Banking and the Mobile App.\n\nEven if you use Card Controls to turn off your debit card, you should still contact us at 1-800-731-2265 to report the unauthorized activity on your card and obtain a new one.\n\nA: To order a replacement for a damaged debit card, call Client Care at 1-800-731-2265 or visit any banking center.\n\nThere is a $7 replacement fee, and the normal timeframe for delivery is 7-10 business days. To receive a card sooner, you can instead choose to pay a $35 fee and receive the replacement card in two business days. The card must be ordered by 4pm on any business day in order for it to be delivered in two business days.\n\nA Lost or Stolen Debit Card\n\nIf instead of a damaged debit card you need help with a lost or stolen card, please call us at 1-800-731-2265, option 2, in the US. You can report a lost or stolen card 24-hours a day. If you are outside of the US, call 1-812-422-2197. We can cancel or restrict your card, check for unauthorized transactions and order a new card for you.\n\nA: Yes, if you will be using your debit card in areas where you do not typically travel, you should call Old National Client Care at 1-800-731-2265 or visit any Old National banking center to notify us of your travels before you leave. This will prevent your card from being blocked as a precaution due to unusual activity.\n\nMastercard® continues to monitor your debit card for suspicious or fraudulent activity while you are traveling. They may attempt to contact you to verify activity on the card, so be prepared to respond to such a call.\n\nIt is also a good idea to take phone numbers with you in case you need to report a lost or stolen debit card. You can report a lost or stolen card 24-hours a day by calling 1-800-731-2265 in the US or 1-812-422-2197 from outside of the US.\n\nIf you have questions about using your debit card while traveling, please contact Client Care at 1-800-731-2265.\n\nA: Card Controls and Alerts enable you to monitor and manage your debit card activity from within Digital Banking and the ONB Mobile App. There is no cost to use Card Controls.\n\nHere are a few of the benefits of using Card Controls:\n\nMonitor\n\nKnow exactly what is happening with your debit card, anytime and anywhere. Turn on alerts for Internet purchases, ATM transactions and more.\n\nManage\n\nUse Card Controls to immediately turn your debit card on or off in case it is misplaced or lost, or for any other reason.
