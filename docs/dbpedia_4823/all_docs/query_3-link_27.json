        "text": "Weâve all heard the mantra before: measure twice, cut once. But what if you donât have a ruler handy? What do you do then? As it turns out, there are variety of ways to measure things without a tape measure. All you need is an object with a consistent length. So, in honor of National Tape Measure Day, weâve put together a list of things you can use in lieu of a ruler.\n\nPro (Thumb) Tip: How to Measure an Inch Without a Ruler\n\nÂ\n\nThe length between your thumb tip and the top knuckle of your thumb is roughly one inch. The next time you have a ruler handy, give it a quick measure to double-check.\n\nIf you donât have cash on hand, you could settle for a credit card. At 3.37 inches long and 2.125 inches tall, your plastic can provide fairly accurate measurements on short notice."
