        "text": "Have you ever been in a situation where you had to tell the time in Spanish? Maybe you had to schedule an airport taxi to come to pick you up, or maybe you met some friends on your trip and wanted to make some plans.\n\nNo matter what, telling time in Spanish is an essential skill that will make your conversations much, much easier!\n\nLearning how to tell time in Spanish isnât difficult at all. If youâve mastered how to count in Spanish and know a few question words in Spanish already, then youâll have no problem getting the hang of it.\n\nWhatâs more, telling the time in Spanish doesnât vary that much between countries. The biggest difference youâll find is that some Spanish-speaking countries routinely use military time (24-hour clock) instead of the 12-hour clock.\n\nThis is the case in Spain and a few countries in South America, but more on that later! Are you ready to start learning? Â¡Hora de comenzar!\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhy learn how to tell the time in Spanish?\n\nFree downloadable time worksheet\n\nHow to tell the time in Spanish\n\nHow to say the time of day in Spanish\n\nHow to tell exact minutes in Spanish\n\nOther ways to express time in Spanish\n\nOther time-related phrases in Spanish\n\nTime in Spanish - FAQs\n\nFun games that will help you learn the time in Spanish\n\nConclusion\n\nWhy learn how to tell the time in Spanish?\n\nOkay, nowadays, itâs very likely that nobody will need to ask you for the time. Gone are the days when people would need to ask strangers on the street for the time (even if Hollywood movies would have us believe otherwise).\n\nHowever, there are still many good reasons for us to be able to tell the time and ask for a specific time in Spanish. For example:\n\nYou want to invite someone to an event, a date, or a business meeting.\n\nYou want to ask a business for their operating hours.\n\nYou need to make travel arrangements with your Airbnb host.\n\nYou need to call a Spanish restaurant to make dinner reservations.\n\nSomebody calls you to reschedule and you need to pick a new time.\n\nAnd the list goes on, and on, and on! There are countless situations in which knowing how to tell the time in Spanish would come in handy and it is also a building block skill that will aid you as you continue to learn, even if you are just starting out learning Spanish for kids. Luckily for you, learning to tell the time is not hard at all, and once youâve read through this guide youâll be able to navigate time-sensitive situations very easily.\n\nWhat time is it in Spanish?\n\nWe've put together a worksheet to help you practice your time telling skills! Once you've completed the worksheet you can then use your mobile phone to scan the QR code for the correct answers. Good luck!\n\nHow to tell the time in Spanish\n\nAs always, you want to start with the basics and go from there. If you havenât yet, you should first learn Spanish numbers. Once youâve mastered the numbers, you can move on to essential time-related words for Spanish.\n\nHow to ask what the time is in Spanish?\n\nThe first thing youâll want to learn is hora (pronounced ora â donât forget the h is silent in Spanish!), which translates to âhourâ. When asking what time it is in Spanish, youâll be using hora instead of tiempo (time).\n\nIf this sounds confusing, just keep in mind that when you ask for the time, youâre really asking the hour (and minutes!) component of time. Think of it like youâre asking them to check what hour their clock says it is! Note that the minutes part is implicitly included in hora, so no need to ask for the minutes as well. Hereâs how to ask what time it is in Spanish\n\nEnglishSpanishPronunciationTimeTiempoËtjÉÌmpoWhat's the time?Â¿QuÃ© hora es?Ëke ËoÉ¾a ËÉsDo you have the time?Â¿Tienes la hora?ËtjenesÌ¬ la ËoÉ¾aDo you know what time it is?Â¿Sabes quÃ© hora es?ËsaÎ²es Ëke ËoÉ¾a ËÉs\n\nHow to tell the time on the hour\n\nAs mentioned, asking for the time in Spanish has no mention of minutes, but people are expected to give time in an hour and minutes format. But what if there are no minutes? Hereâs how to say that it is 4 PM sharp.\n\nEnglishSpanishItâs one oâclockEs la una en puntoItâs two oâclockSon las dos en puntoItâs three oâclockSon las tres en puntoItâs four oâclockSon las cuatro en puntoItâs five oâclockSon las cinco en puntoItâs six oâclockSon las seis en puntoItâs seven oâclockSon las siete en puntoItâs eight oâclockSon las ocho en puntoItâs nine oâclockSon las nueve en puntoItâs ten oâclockSon las diez en puntoItâs eleven oâclockSon las once en puntoItâs twelve oâclockSon las doce en punto\n\nHow to say half past, quarter past, and quarter to\n\nNow, conversationally, we donât need to get too specific when giving the time. In English, we usually say âitâs a quarter past threeâ instead of saying âitâs three fifteen.â The same is true for Spanish. Letâs get into a few examples.\n\nEnglishSpanishPronunciationExample SentenceIt's half pastY mediai ËmeÃ°jaSon las tres y mediaItâs quarter pastY cuartoi ËkwaÉ¾toSon las doce y cuartoItâs quarter toCuarto paraËkwaÉ¾to ËpaÉ¾aEs cuarto para la una\n\nHow to say the time of day in Spanish\n\nBeyond just giving a specific time, youâll find that many Spanish speakers just go off of general time periods instead. We also tend to be very lax with our meeting times, especially compared to Germans and Americans who tend to be very punctual. You can read more about examples of cultural communication differences in business here.\n\nIâd like to think itâs due to the Spanish siesta and how rest is built into our daily routines. For whatever reason, youâll find that Spanish speakers tend to refer to meeting times as mere suggestions more so than firm commitments. Thatâs why people tend to make plans around general time periods instead of specific times in order to avoid being late.\n\nHere are a few useful ones.\n\nEnglishSpanishPronunciationExample SentenceMorningMaÃ±anamaËÉ²anaSon las 10 de la maÃ±anaAfternoonTardeËtaÉ¾Ã°eSon las 4 de la tardeEveningTardeËtaÉ¾Ã°eSon las 7 de la tardeNightNocheËnoÊ§eSon las 11 de la nocheMidday / noonMediodÃ­ameÃ°joËÃ°iaNos vemos maÃ±ana al mediodÃ­aMidnightMedianochemeÃ°jaËnoÊ§eSu vuelo aterriza a la medianocheDuskAnocheceranoÊ§eËsÉÉ¾Llega antes del anochecerDawnAmaneceramaneËsÉÉ¾DespertÃ© antes del amanecerBedtimeHora de dormirËoÉ¾a Ã°e Ã°oÉ¾ËmiÉ¾Es la hora de dormirLunchtimeHora de comerËoÉ¾a Ã°e koËmÉÉ¾Es la hora de comerDinnertimeHora de cenarËoÉ¾a Ã°e seËnaÉ¾Es la hora de cenarNaptimeHora de la siestaËoÉ¾a Ã°e la ËsjÉstaEs la hora de la siestaAround X timeComo a lasâ¦Ëkomo a lasNos vemos como a las 8\n\nHow to tell exact minutes in Spanish\n\nNow, even in Spanish-speaking cultures, there will be times when youâll need to say or ask for the exact time. For example, if you have a flight to catch, a job interview, or a doctorâs appointment. You would never want to be late for any of those, so knowing the exact time is important.\n\nAsking for the exact time is similar to English: all you have to do is throw in the word âexactâ or âexactlyâ when you ask for the time.\n\nTelling the exact minutes is also similar. First, you say the hour like you normally would and then you add the number for the minutes immediately after the number for hours. Just like in English youâd say âitâs two twenty-fiveâ to say itâs 2:25, in Spanish, youâd say âson las dos veinticinco.â\n\nCheck out the below examples.\n\nEnglishSpanishPronunciationWhat time is it exactly?Â¿QuÃ© hora es exactamente?Ëke ËoÉ¾a ËÉs ÉksakÌtaËmÉÌnteDo you have the exact time?Â¿Tienes la hora exacta?ËtjenesÌ¬ la ËoÉ¾a ÉkËsakÌtaItâs 7:08Son las siete cero ochoËsoÌn las ËsjÉte ËsÉÉ¾o ËoÊ§oItâs 1:25Es la una veinticincoËÉsÌ¬ la Ëuna Î²eiÌ¯ntiËsiÌnko\n\nOther ways to express time in Spanish\n\nBeyond the simple time constructions mentioned above, there are three general ways for you to say the time in Spanish. In English, you can generally only say âitâs five forty five,â but there are a few slight variations that people may use in Spanish. Check these out:\n\nEnglishSpanishItâs five forty-fiveSon las cinco cuarenta y cinco.Son las cinco y cuarenta y cinco.Itâs five forty-fiveSon las cinco con cuarenta y cinco.\n\nWhatâs the difference, you ask? Nothing. They all mean the exact same thing.\n\nIt comes down to a matter of preference and regionalisms, but there is no distinct difference between any of them. Youâre free to choose your favorite, but going with the first structure will probably make the most sense as itâs the most similar to English.\n\nOther time-related phrases in Spanish\n\nEnglishSpanishPronunciationIn a Sentence/ExampleDayDÃ­aËdiaÂ¿QuÃ© dÃ­a nos vemos?WeekSemanaseËmanaLa prÃ³xima semana.MonthMesËmesEn un mes me voy a MÃ©xico.YearAÃ±oËaÉ²oEn un aÃ±o cumplo 18.YesterdayAyeraËÊÉÉ¾Ayer me enfermÃ©.TodayHoyËoiÌ¯Â¡Hoy es viernes!TomorrowMaÃ±anamaËÉ²anaMaÃ±ana no trabajo.MondayLunesËlunesEl lunes tengo trabajo.TuesdayMartesËmaÉ¾tesEl martes es dÃ­a feriado.WednesdayMiÃ©rcolesËmjÉÉ¾kolesEl miÃ©rcoles es mi cumpleaÃ±os.ThursdayJuevesËxweÎ²esÂ¿Quieres ir a cenar conmigo el jueves?FridayViernesËbjÉÉ¾nesÂ¡Ya es viernes!SaturdaySÃ¡badoËsaÎ²aÃ°oEl sÃ¡bado voy a ir al museo.SundayDomingodoËmiÌnÉ¡oEl domingo es mi dÃ­a de descanso.Last YearEl aÃ±o pasadoÉl ËaÉ²o paËsaÃ°oEl aÃ±o pasado fui a Argentina.This YearEste aÃ±oËÉste ËaÉ²oEste aÃ±o quiero ir a Chile.Next YearEl prÃ³ximo aÃ±oÉl ËpÉ¾oksimo ËaÉ²oEl prÃ³ximo aÃ±o me gradÃºo.Next TimeLa prÃ³xima vezla ËpÉ¾oksima ËÎ²esLa prÃ³xima vez yo te invito.Last MonthEl mes pasadoÉl Ëmes paËsaÃ°oEl mes pasado me dieron un aumento.This MonthEste mesËÉste ËmesEste mes voy a tener mucho trabajo.Next MonthEl prÃ³ximo mesÉl ËpÉ¾oksimo ËmesEl prÃ³ximo mes me voy a Colombia.Take Your TimeToma tu tiempoËtoma tu ËtjÉÌmpoToma tu tiempo para responder.Once Upon A TimeÃrase una vezËÉÉ¾ase Ëuna ËÎ²esÃrase una vez, en un reino muy, muy lejano.A Long TimeMucho tiempoËmuÊ§o ËtjÉÌmpoMe quedo en Argentina mucho tiempo.SometimeAlguna vezalËÉ£una ËÎ²esÂ¿Alguna vez has ido a Venezuela?OccasionallyOcasionalmenteokasjonalËmÉÌnteOcasionalmente tomo vino tinto.Have a great timePÃ¡salo bienËpasalo ËÎ²jÉÌnÂ¡PÃ¡salo bien en tus vacaciones!Until next time!Â¡Hasta la prÃ³xima!Ëasta la ËpÉ¾oksimaYa me voy.

For example, the â80s are los ochentas, the â90s are los noventas, and so on. The only difference is that you need to spell out the names of the numbers when writing them.\n\nHow do I ask âHow long?â in Spanish\n\nEnglishSpanishPronunciationIn a Sentence/TranslationHow longÂ¿CuÃ¡nto tiempo â¦ ?ËkwaÌnto ËtjÉÌmpoÂ¿CuÃ¡nto tiempo te quedas? / How long are you staying?How long does it last?Â¿CuÃ¡nto dura â¦ ?ËkwaÌnto ËÃ°uÉ¾aÂ¿CuÃ¡nto dura la temporada de lluvia? / How long is the rainy season?How long does it take?Â¿CuÃ¡nto tarda â¦?ËkwaÌnto ËtaÉ¾Ã°aÂ¿CuÃ¡nto tarda el lavado de auto? / How long does the car wash take?How long haveâ¦Â¿Desde cuÃ¡ndo ... ?ËdÉsÌ¬Ã°e ËkwaÌndoÂ¿Desde cuÃ¡ndo vives en Colombia? / How long have you lived in Colombia?How long haveâ¦Â¿De cuÃ¡ndo acÃ¡ â¦?de ËkwaÌndo aËkaÂ¿De cuÃ¡ndo acÃ¡ eres vegetariano? / How long have you been vegetarian?For how long?Â¿Por cuÃ¡nto tiempo â¦?poÉ¾ ËkwaÌnto ËtjÉÌmpoÂ¿Por cuÃ¡nto tiempo te quedas en PerÃº? / For how long are you staying in Peru?\n\nHow do I tell military time in Spanish?\n\nMany Spanish-speaking countries, like Spain and Argentina, prefer to use military time when telling time. This will take some time to get used to if youâre used to the 12-hour clock, but learning how to tell military time in Spanish is just as easy as telling time on the 12-hour clock.\n\nSimply use the corresponding number based on a 24-hour clock instead of using a 12-hour clock. For example, instead of saying âitâs six PM,â you would say âitâs eighteenâ (son las dieciocho). Using the 24-hour clock obviates the need for specifying AM, PM, or what time of day it is.\n\nThe best way to get used to this is to practice a lot!\n\nHow do I say century in Spanish?\n\nThe Spanish word for âcenturyâ is siglo. Beyond that, you donât need to worry about using ordinal numbers when referring to a specific century. Whereas in English you would say âthe twentieth century,â in Spanish you would just say el siglo veinte. Much easier, right?\n\nKeep in mind that centuries are usually written down using Roman numerals instead of spelling them out. So, you would say el siglo veinte but would write el siglo XX.\n\nThis might be complicated if you havenât brushed up on your Roman numerals since elementary school. Check out the following table for a refresher.\n\nEnglishSpoken SpanishWritten Spanish16th centuryEl siglo diecisÃ©isEl siglo XVI17th centuryEl siglo diecisieteEl siglo XVII18th centuryEl siglo dieciochoEl siglo XVIII19th centuryEl siglo diecinueveEl siglo XIX20th centuryEl siglo veinteEl siglo XX21st centuryEl siglo veintiunoEl siglo XXI\n\nFun games that will help you learn the time in Spanish\n\nSpanish time clock faces\n\nThis game is the easiest for large classes where individualized attention may be complicated. The teacher would need to pass out empty clock face worksheets like this one. Then, the teacher would say a time out loud and ask the students to draw the corresponding clock handles.\n\nThis game can be adjusted depending on the studentsâ level and should become increasingly difficult. For example, mix it up with 24-hour time and 12-hour time. Use phrases like y media and cuarto para to increase the difficulty level.\n\nÂ¿A quÃ© hora es?\n\nIn this game, the teacher would write down a daily or weekly schedule on the board with a host of activities. Timed activities like desayuno, cena, and siesta would be ideal, but feel free to include other activities that you have recently covered in class. Make sure each activity has a specific time.\n\nThen, you would call out each student and ask them what time youâre supposed to do something. The student will then have to look at the schedule and answer with the appropriate time. If you use a weekly schedule, you can also use this to test your students on the days of the week in Spanish.\n\nYou could even do a variation on this game to learn how to say the months in Spanish. Just create a year-long schedule with specific trips and activities happening in each month. If your students are advanced, you could ask them to call out the specific date and time of an activity!\n\nClock Hot Potato\n\nTelling the time in Spanish games doesnât have to be boring, and this game is the only proof youâll need! To play this game, you will need to make a clock made out of foam. Play some music and have your students pass the clock around while the music is playing. When the music stops, ask whoever is holding the clock to translate a specific time.\n\nAlternatively, you can say a specific time in Spanish and have the student move their hands to reflect the time. This can be great for learning how to tell military time in Spanish! The possibilities are endless, so feel free to get creative with this game.\n\nDownload our free worksheet to help you learn how to tell the time in Spanish.\n\nTime's up. Â¡Hasta la vista!\n\nWell, timeâs up for this blog post! We hope you found this to be a useful resource for telling the time in Spanish. As always, remember to complement learning Spanish online with some fun games and a lot of practice!\n\nI canât promise that knowing how to tell the time in Spanish will make Spanish-speakers be more punctual, but itâll certainly help prevent any confusion on your side! Now, go out and make as many appointments as youâd like! Â¡Hasta la prÃ³xima!"
