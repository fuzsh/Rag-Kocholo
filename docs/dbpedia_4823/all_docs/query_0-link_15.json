        "text": "Quick summary: Our ability to measure power is a crucial part of society’s ability to keep the lights on. Here, we show you how to convert watts to kilowatts, as well as kilowatt hours, megawatts, and gigawatts. We discuss how kilowatt hours differ from kilowatts and how knowing about watts can help you measure your energy use and manage your power bill.\n\nWhat Is a Watt?\n\nThe term “watt” comes from James Watt of Scotland, an engineer, entrepreneur, craftsman, instrument maker, and scientist often called the father of the Industrial Revolution. One of his most notable accomplishments was around 1775 when he invented the Watt steam engine. Today, steam turbines at thermal power plants use this same technology to convert thermal energy into mechanical energy. We measure that electrical power per kilowatt, a multiple of the watt unit, which is the International System of Units (SI)-derived unit for power.\n\nWatts (W) are the basic units used to measure electric, thermal, and mechanical power. One watt is equal to one joule, as well as one volt-ampere. All of these terms measure electrical power.\n\nMost frequently, we measure residential and commercial power in kilowatts. One kW equals 1,000 watts of power. A microwave with a 1,000 W label requires 1,000 watts (equal to 1 kW) to work.\n\nWatt Units Calculator: Watts to Kilowatts & Kilowatts to Watts\n\nWe find the power in kilowatts P(kW) by dividing the power in watts P(W) by 1,000.\n\nW to kW Formula:\n\nP(kW) = P(W) / 1,000\n\nFor example, if you wanted to see how many watts were in your 1,500 W dishwasher, you would do the following calculation:\n\nP(kW) = 1,500W / 1,000 = 1.5kW\n\nTo make the math easier, just add a decimal point at the end of your whole number. In this case, it’s 1,500. Then, since there are three zeros in 1,000, the number you’re dividing by, you will move the decimal point three spaces to the left. You end up with 1.500 or 1.5.\n\nkW to W Formula:\n\nSince we know that kW to watts is 1 to 1,000, we reverse the watt formula above to solve this equation.\n\n1kW = 1000W\n\nP(W) = 1000 × P(kW)\n\nSo, if you know your dishwasher uses 1.5kW, you would perform the equation below to find that your dishwasher is a 1,500W appliance or equal to the power of 1,500 watts to work.\n\nConvert 1.5 kW to W:\n\nP(W) = 1,000 × 1.5kW = 1,500 W\n\nHow Many Kilowatts Are in a Megawatt?\n\nWe use megawatts (MW) when measuring on a larger scale. If you wanted to know how much electricity is required to run a city, you would use megawatts. A typical coal plant is around 600 MW.\n\nUse the same W formula above to convert kW to MW.\n\nkW to MW Formula:\n\nP(MW) = P(kW) / 1,000\n\nTo convert watts to MW, add three more zeros to your equation. The power in megawatts P(MW) can be found by dividing the P(W) by 1,000,000.\n\nW to MW Formula:\n\nP(MW) = P(W) / 1,000,000\n\nFor example, to convert a 100 W light bulb to MW, do the following calculation:\n\nP(MW) = 100 W / 1,000,000 = 0.000100 MW\n\nHow Many Megawatts Are in a Gigawatt?\n\nWe use gigawatts (GW) to measure how much power large power plants generate. In 2022, the total capacity of United States electricity-generating plants was about 1,160 GW.\n\nThere are 1,000 MW in one GW, 1 million kW in 1 W, 1 GW, and 1 billion W in 1 GW.\n\nWhat Is a Kilowatt Hour?\n\n[Happy mid adults couple changing light bulb indoors at home, relocation and diy concept]\n\nA kilowatt hour (kWh) is a measurement of how much energy is used. A kWh measures the time or amount of energy it takes to use 1 kW of power.\n\nkW = power, the rate at which energy is generated or used.\n\nkWh = energy, the rate at which we use fuel over a specific time period.\n\nThe amount of energy used if a 1,000 W appliance runs for one hour equals 1 kWh. The fewer watts an item has, the better.\n\nA 100 W lightbulb would wield 1 kWh of energy after 10 hours of use. But if you switched to a lightbulb that requires 40 W to produce the same amount of light, it will take 25 hours to use 1 kWh. Imagine the savings you could achieve by switching out all the lightbulbs in your home.\n\nJust like measuring power consumption, to calculate the amount of energy used or produced on a larger scale, you would use megawatt-hours (MWh) or gigawatt-hours (GWh).\n\nPut another way, the energy E in kWh is equal to the power P that is consumed in kW times the time T in hours. Here’s that simple formula: E (kWh) = P (kW) x T (hrs).\n\nHow Is My Electricity Use in Kilowatt Hours Calculated?\n\nMuch like 1 kW is equal to the power of 1,000 watts, 1 kWh is equivalent to 1,000 W, or joules, of energy use over one hour. If you wanted to convert watts into kWh to find out how much electricity your coffee maker consumes each day, you would multiply the consumption in watts by the number of hours. Then, divide that number by 1,000.\n\nW to kWh Formula:\n\nkWh = (watts × hours) ÷ 1,000\n\nFor example, to find the kWh of 1,200 watts for 3 hours:\n\nkWh = (1,200 × 3) ÷ 1,000\n\nkWh = 3,600 ÷ 1,000 = 3.6\n\nTo convert power in kW, into kWh, just leave out the step in which you divide by 1,000. So, the example above would be:\n\nkWh = kW × hours\n\nkWh = 1.2 × 3 = 3.6\n\nHow Do I Convert My Energy Consumption of Kilowatt Hours to Watts?\n\nSuppose you wanted to determine the wattage of your coffee maker based on its kWh.\n\nMultiply the energy used in kWh by 1,000 to find the consumption in watt-hours. Then, divide that number by the number of hours you used it.\n\nHere’s how to calculate Watts from kWh:\n\nW = (kWh × 1,000) ÷ hrs\n\nFor example, let’s find the watts of power for 3.6 kWh of energy consumption in 3 hours.\n\nW = (3.6 kWh × 1,000) ÷ 3 hrs\n\nW = 3,600 ÷ 3 hrs = 1200 W\n\nCalculating Wattage Consumed by a Lightbulb\n\nLet’s use the national average rate of around 13 cents per kWh to calculate how much it costs to power a 100 W lightbulb every hour. To convert the power in W to kWh, multiply 100 watts by one hour. Then divide by 1,000 to find the energy usage in kWh.\n\nEnergy = (100 × 1) ÷ 1,000\n\nEnergy = 100 ÷ 1,000 = 0.1 kWh\n\nHourly cost = electricity cost per kWh ÷ energy use in kWh\n\nHourly cost = $0.13 ÷ 0.1 kWh = 1.3 cents\n\nHow Do I Estimate My Electricity Bill?\n\nIf electricity costs 13 cents per kWh, a 100 W light bulb will cost 1.3 cents for every hour it’s on. To estimate your monthly costs, follow these steps:\n\nEstimate how many hours per day you use that lightbulb on average. Let’s say it’s 5 hours.\n\nMultiply the lightbulb’s watts by the average number of hours you use it daily. Let’s say your lightbulb is 60 W, so you would calculate 60 w x 5 hours.\n\nSolve the equation above using your lightbulb’s actual wattage and the average number of hours you use that lightbulb per day. (60 x 5 = 300 ÷ 1,000 = 0.3 kWh).\n\nDivide your area’s average electricity cost by your lightbulb’s average daily kWh. ($0.13 ÷ 0.3 kWh = 43 cents per day.\n\nMultiply your answer by 30 to get the monthly average kWh for that lightbulb. In this case, $0.43 x 30 days = $3.90. It would cost you $3.90 per month to leave a 60 W lightbulb on for an average of 5 hours per day, every day.\n\nRepeat this watts equation for all lightbulbs, appliances, and other electrical devices in your home.\n\nAdd up the total to find your estimated monthly electricity costs in kWh.\n\nNow that you know how to use your newfound knowledge to save energy, you may want to learn more ways to save on your electric bills.
