Find out in the table below, which gives specifications for U.S. Mint legal tender coins presently in production for annual sets. Specifications for the American Innovation $1 Coins and Native American $1 Coins are the same.\n\nThe penny, dime, quarter, half dollar, and dollar are clad coins. Clad coins have an inner core of metal surrounded by an outer layer of a different metal. The Mint makes clad coins with an inner core of copper. The nickel is the only circulating coin that isnâ€™t clad."
