View directions for starting and stopping the COTA deduction.\n\nCABS Connects you to COTA\n\nItâs easy to ride CABS through campus to connect to COTA bus routes. Once youâre connected to a COTA bus, your options are virtually limitless.\n\nLines Around Campus\n\nLine 1\n\nLine 1 can take you to Riverside Methodist Hospital and to shopping and dining options along Olentangy River Road and Kenny and Bethel roads to the west.

COTA 7-day passes are great for conventioneers, out-of-town professionals, tourists, and senior and youth groups. At just $25 each, a 7-day pass costs less than renting a car, catching a shuttle and even paying for taxis or ride sharing services. Plus, one pass is good for unlimited rides on all COTA routes (please note that Rush Hour trips require an additional $0.75 charge).\n\nPasses are available at the COTA Pass Sales Office or Ticket Vending Machine (33 North High St.) or at participating Kroger and Giant Eagle stores. To find out more about how to purchase 7-day passes in bulk, contact COTA Customer Service at 614-228-1776.\n\nIs your office in the Downtown Columbus area?

Learn more.\n\nIRS Regulation 132 offers substantial dollar savings to transit riders on their daily commute costs. These savings come from federal, state and FICA taxes that are not accessed on transit costs when paid by employees on a pre-tax basis. The IRS establishes employers as the gatekeeper for this federally-approved program. Employers must deduct the cost of the pass each month from the employeeâs paycheck.\n\nRefund Policy and Procedures"
