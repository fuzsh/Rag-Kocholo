        "text": "The bookstore Advance Payment Plan allows students to purchase their books using excess financial aid funds prior to the start of the semester. To utilize BAPP you must have the following: excess aid of at least $300 and a valid Campus ID.\n\nWhat is BAPP?\n\nThe Bookstore Advance Payment Plan (BAPP) is a program that will allow qualified student to use their excess authorized financial aid at the University Bookstore to buy textbooks and school supplies prior to the date that financial aid will be released to students.\n\nWhat is excess aid?\n\nExcess authorized aid is the aid that will be available after all university fees are paid.\n\nWhen will BAPP be available?\n\nBAPP Program Dates: https://www.memphis.edu/usbs/calendars/\n\nWhy would I want to use the BAPP?\n\nDuring this time period, qualified students are allowed to buy early and be prepared for class — all while taking advantage of lower priced used textbooks before they fly out the door.\n\nHow do I qualify?\n\nYou qualify if your excess aid (Total Charges minus Aid) is at least $300.\n\nHow do I sign up?\n\nYou do not need to sign up. Excess aid between $300 and $1,300 is transferred to the plan automatically.\n\nCan I decide how much I want to transfer to the plan?\n\nNo. Excess aid between $300 and $1,300 will be transferred to the plan automatically.\n\nHow do I use the money to buy my books and supplies?\n\nYou will access these funds for in person purchases at the University Bookstore using your Campus (ID) Card through a fund called “Bookstore Fin Aid Advance.” For the bookstore's hours of operation, please visit this link. Please note:The Bookstores will have special hours after the semester ends and during the holidays. Be sure and check the store hours on their website during this time.\n\nWhere can I buy my books?\n\nThis advanced fund may only be used to purchase textbooks and school supplies at the University Bookstore. Please Note: Law and Lambuth students can utilize BAPP at the bookstore on their campus as well as the Main Campus bookstore.\n\nHow do I know how much is available on the “Bookstore Fin Aid Advance?\"\n\nLog on to your Campus Card account during the dates listed above. Your BAPP funds will be visible under “Your Card Transactions” as “Bookstore Fin Aid Advance” and amount will be indicated under “Current Balance.” Please Note: The posting of the “Bookstore Fin Aid Advance” is not an automatic process. It may take up to 24 business hours after your authorized aid has been posted to your UofM account to be available at the bookstore.\n\nWhat if I choose not to take advantage of the Bookstore Advance Payment Plan?\n\nBAPP is not mandatory. If unused, your excess aid will be refunded by direct deposit (if you have signed up) or a check will be mailed to you following the normal refund schedule.\n\nWhat if I add or drop classes or move into the dorm or lose my aid?\n\nAvailable “Bookstore Fin Aid Advance” may be adjusted due to subsequent changes in your account.\n\nWhat if I make adjustments to my account and I’ve already spent the money at the bookstore?\n\nAt the end of the period listed above, a charge will be placed on your UofM account for the amount that you charged at the bookstore. When financial aid is released to pay your tuition and fees, the bookstore charge will also be paid. If the aid is not enough to pay the bookstore charge due to reduction in aid and/or added classes or other new charges, then you will be liable for payment of the bookstore charge and you will have a University & Student Business Services financial hold placed on your account until your account is paid in full.\n\nIf you have questions about your UofM account status, please check TigerXpress. For information on excess financial aid/scholarship refunds, please visit the Financial Aid Office.\n\nOn campus dining is an important part of campus life. The Tiger Eat$ Program provides resident and commuter students the opportunity to connect with friends, stay healthy, boost your energy to start the day or unwind after a long day. Tiger Eat$ offers the flexibility to purchase dining items without the need to carry cash. Our goal is to integrate both commuting and resident students to experience a full college life. Students can enjoy a meal while working on a project or grab a snack between classes.\n\nCheck out our dining and vending locations to see where you can conveniently use Tiger Eat$ funds. You may access your Your Campus Card account, view your balance or review your transaction history.\n\nStudents that elect to upgrade to an optional commuter or resident meal plan,by the deadline, will have the Tiger Eat$ fee deducted from their student bill.\n\nHow Does the Tiger Eat$ Plan Work?\n\nAll full-time undergraduate students participate in the Tiger Eat$ program. If you are an undergraduate student, enrolled in 12 or more credit hours and at least one of your classes is on campus, you will automatically have $350 in Tiger Eat$ added to your account each fall and spring semester.\n\nStudents will be able to use these funds at all UofM dining locations to spend on campus for meals, beverages and snacks, including Starbucks and some vending machines.\n\nAny Tiger Eat$ balance from the fall semester will be transferred to the spring semester. You have until the last day of the spring semester to use the funds and dine around campus."
