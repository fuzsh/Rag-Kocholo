        "text": "… but my own favorite candidate is the 19\\frac{1}{9} dollar bill used in colonial Maryland:\n\nA total of 57,000 bills of this sort were issued in 1767, 1770 and 1774. The dent in the upper left corner was deliberate: ‘indented’ bills were used to fight against counterfeiting, which was rampant at the time. Another trick was inserting deliberate typos, like the colon after “Annapolis”. Note also that this note is hand-signed, with a hand-written serial number! Back then, being treasurer was hard work.\n\nYou might argue that the 29\\frac{2}{9} dollar bill was even odder…\n\n… but I’d have to disagree: it’s oddly evener!\n\nI thank Robert Schlesinger for tipping me off about the existence of these odd fractional bills. The above pictures come from the following delightful history, where you can also see a 4 dollar bill, a 6 dollar bill, a 13\\frac{1}{3} dollar bill, and so on:\n\nJohn A. Sandrock, Maryland colonial and Continental bank note issues of the American Revolution.\n\nOn the other hand, if you just find big bills odd, maybe you’ll go with the biggest American bill ever released — this orange $100,000 dollar bill:\n\nThe $10,000 dollar bill was also a bit odd, since it was decorated with the face of a guy most people have never heard of. Who?\n\nI think our regular own dollar is pretty darn odd all by itself. Here are three of its biggest oddities:\n\n1) It’s designed to be both a medium of exchange and a store of value at the same time which are contradictory functions, i.e. if we hold on to our dollars to store some value for later, then there’s no currency to circulate as a medium of exchange!\n\n2) It is an informational token that is shoe-horned into acting like something of value in and of itself. This is way freaky odd. We are put into the mind-frame of thinking that the informational tokens are just as valuable as the wealth flow they facilitate, by virtue of their scarce (or unscarce as in the case of Zimbabwe) issuance.\n\n3) It is issued on the basis of interest bearing debt, which has the side-effect that the money supply is forced to expand exponentially by logical necessity if debtors are to be able to locate the money to pay off the principal plus the interest of those debts. That is, there is never as much money in existence as there is debt plus interest, so when the interest comes due somebody else had better have taken out more debt to feed back into paying off the original debt’s interest. To me it’s extremely odd to base a monetary system on a Ponzi scheme, but that’s what we’ve done!\n\nINTERESTING HISTORY LESSON\n\nOn Railroad Tracks.\n\n*\n\n*This is fascinating and true.\n\nBe sure to read the final paragraph; your understanding of it will\n\ndepend on the earlier part of the content.\n\nThe US standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet,\n\n8.5 inches. That’s an exceedingly odd number.\n\nWhy was that gauge used? Because that’s the way they built them\n\nin England and English expatriates built the US railroads.\n\nWhy did the English build them like that? Because the first rail lines\n\nwere built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways and\n\nthat’s the gauge they used.\n\nWhy did ‘they’ use that gauge then? Because the people who built the\n\ntramways used the same jigs and tools that they used for building\n\nwagons, which used that wheel spacing.\n\nWhy did the wagons have that particular odd wheel spacing? Well, if they\n\ntried to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels would break on some of\n\nthe old, long distance roads in England, because that’s the spacing of\n\nthe wheel ruts.\n\nSo who built those old rutted roads? Imperial Rome built the first long\n\ndistance roads in Europe (and England ) for their legions. The roads\n\nhave been used ever since.\n\nAnd the ruts in the roads? Roman war chariots formed the initial ruts,\n\nwhich everyone else had to match for fear of destroying their wagon\n\nwheels. Since the chariots were made for Imperial Rome, they were all\n\nalike in the matter of wheel spacing. Therefore the United\n\nStates standard railroad gauge of 4 feet, 8.5 inches is derived from the\n\noriginal specifications for an Imperial Roman war chariot…\n\nBureaucracies live forever.\n\nSo the next time you are handed a specification/procedure/process and\n\nwonder ‘What horse’s ass came up with it?’, you may be exactly right.\n\nImperial Roman army chariots were made just wide enough to accommodate\n\nthe rear ends of two war horses. (Two horse’s asses.) Now, the twist to\n\nthe story:\n\nWhen you see a Space Shuttle sitting on its launch pad, there are two\n\nbig booster rockets attached to the sides of the main fuel tank. These\n\nare solid rocket boosters, or SRB’s. The SRB’s are made by Thiokol at\n\ntheir factory in Utah . The engineers who designed the SRB’s would have\n\npreferred to make them a bit fatter, but the SRB’s had to be shipped by\n\ntrain from the factory to the launch site. The railroad line from the\n\nfactory happens to run through a tunnel in the mountains, and the SRB’s\n\nhad to fit through that tunnel. The tunnel is slightly wider than the\n\nrailroad track and the railroad track, as you now know, is about as wide\n\nas two horses’ behinds. **\n\nSo, a major Space Shuttle design feature of what is arguably the world’s\n\nmost advanced transportation system was determined over two thousand\n\nyears ago by the width of a horse’s ass. And you thought being a horse’s\n\nass wasn’t important? Ancient horse’s asses control almost everything…\n\nand CURRENT Horses Asses are controlling everything else.*"
