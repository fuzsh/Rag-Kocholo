        "text": "Rate of Return Rule of 72 Actual # of Years Difference (#) of Years 2% 36.0 35 1.0 3% 24.0 23.45 0.6 5% 14.4 14.21 0.2 7% 10.3 10.24 0.0 9% 8.0 8.04 0.0 12% 6.0 6.12 0.1 25% 2.9 3.11 0.2 50% 1.4 1.71 0.3 72% 1.0 1.28 0.3 100% 0.7 1 0.3\n\nNotice that the Rule of 72 is less precise as rates of return increase.\n\nThe Rule of 72 and Natural Logs\n\nThe Rule of 72 can estimate compounding periods using natural logarithms. In mathematics, the logarithm is the opposite concept of a power; for example, the opposite of 10³ is log base 10 of 1,000.\n\nRule of 72 = l n ( e ) = 1 where: e = 2 . 7 1 8 2 8 1 8 2 8 \\begin{aligned} &\\text{Rule of 72} = ln(e) = 1\\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &e = 2.718281828\\\\ \\end{aligned} ​Rule of 72=ln(e)=1where:e=2.718281828​\n\nThe natural logarithm is the amount of time needed to reach a certain level of growth with continuous compounding.\n\nThe time value of money (TVM) formula is the following:\n\nFuture Value = P V × ( 1 + r ) n where: P V = Present Value r = Interest Rate n = Number of Time Periods \\begin{aligned} &\\text{Future Value} = PV \\times (1+r)^n\\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &PV = \\text{Present Value}\\\\ &r = \\text{Interest Rate}\\\\ &n = \\text{Number of Time Periods}\\\\ \\end{aligned} ​Future Value=PV×(1+r)nwhere:PV=Present Valuer=Interest Raten=Number of Time Periods​\n\nTo see how long it will take an investment to double, state the future value as 2 and the present value as 1.\n\n2 = 1 × ( 1 + r ) n 2 = 1 \\times (1 + r)^n 2=1×(1+r)n\n\nSimplify, and you have the following:\n\n2 = ( 1 + r ) n 2 = (1 + r)^n 2=(1+r)n\n\nTo remove the exponent on the right-hand side of the equation, take the natural log of each side:\n\nl n ( 2 ) = n × l n ( 1 + r ) ln(2) = n \\times ln(1 + r) ln(2)=n×ln(1+r)\n\nThis equation can be simplified again because the natural log of (1 + interest rate) equals the interest rate as the rate gets continuously closer to zero. In other words, you are left with:\n\nl n ( 2 ) = r × n ln(2) = r \\times n ln(2)=r×n\n\nThe natural log of 2 is equal to 0.693 and, after dividing both sides by the interest rate, you have:\n\n0 . 6 9 3 / r = n 0.693/r = n 0.693/r=n\n\nBy multiplying the numerator and denominator on the left-hand side by 100, you can express each as a percentage. This gives:\n\n6 9 . 3 / r % = n 69.3/r\\% = n 69.3/r%=n\n\nHow to Adjust the Rule of 72 for Higher Accuracy\n\nThe Rule of 72 is more accurate if it is adjusted to more closely resemble the compound interest formula—which effectively transforms the Rule of 72 into the Rule of 69.3.\n\nThe number 72, however, has many convenient factors, including two, three, four, six, and nine. This convenience makes it easier to use the Rule of 72 for a close approximation of compounding periods.\n\nHow to Calculate the Rule of 72 Using MATLAB\n\nThe calculation of the Rule of 72 in the MATLAB platform requires running a simple command of “years = 72/return,” where the variable “return” is the rate of return on investment and “years” is the result for the Rule of 72. The Rule of 72 is also used to determine how long it takes for money to halve in value for a given rate of inflation.\n\nFor example, if the rate of inflation is 4%, a command “years = 72/inflation” where the variable inflation is defined as “inflation = 4” gives 18 years.\n\nMATLAB, short for matrix laboratory, is a programming platform from MathWorks used for analyzing data.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe Rule of 72 is a quick and easy method for determining how long it will take to double the money you're investing, assuming it has a fixed annual rate of return. While it is not precise, it does provide a ballpark figure and is easy to calculate.\n\nInvestments such as stocks do not have a fixed rate of return, but the Rule of 72 still can give you an idea of the kind of return you would need to double your money in a certain amount of time. For example, to double your money in six years, you would need a rate of return of 12%."
