        "text": "Whether you’re looking for admissions or athletic scholarships, achievement-based grants or a tuition reduction as a dependent of a WMU employee, there are a variety of institutional scholarships and grants to help cover the expenses of your education. So be sure to take a minute to explore!\n\nPlease note: Western Michigan University will limit institutional funds (i.e., need-based grants, merit scholarships, departmental scholarships, employee tuition waivers, Indian Tuition Grant Waiver, etc.) to the annual cost of attendance.\n\n99%\n\nof full-time undergraduate students with financial need received aid\n\n—2023-24 Common Data Set\n\nExplore the data\n\n60%\n\nof students receive grant money directly from the school, which is above the national average for public schools\n\n—PrepScholar\n\nRead the full guide\n\nDepartmental scholarships\n\nMany Western Michigan University students benefit from scholarships offered through different colleges and programs.\n\nCollege of Arts and Sciences\n\nCollege of Aviation\n\nCollege of Education and Human Development\n\nCollege of Engineering and Applied Sciences\n\nCollege of Fine Arts\n\nCollege of Health and Human Services\n\nGraduate College\n\nHaworth College of Business\n\nLee Honors College\n\nFaculty and staff: For scholarship awarding and more, visit our dedicated Faculty and Staff resources page. If you are working with a student who has questions about financial aid, please refer them to Student Financial Aid.\n\nReceiving the phone call that I received the Foundation Scholarship changed my life completely. And every single day that I'm at Western, there's an impact that someone makes in my life. I don't know what life would be without the scholarship. I don't know if I would be the leader that I am today.\n\n—Jessica Cortes, B.S.'22, M.S.W.'23, first-generation student and Foundation Scholar\n\nInternational student scholarships\n\nInternational students do not qualify for federal financial aid, but institutional scholarships may be available through WMU’s International Admissions and Services office.\n\nGo to international student scholarship resources\n\nInstitutional scholarships renewals and appeals\n\nFull-time enrollment and Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) are required for scholarships to pay. If students are not meeting SAP requirements, then they must complete an SAP appeal with the Office of Student Financial Aid. If student’s SAP appeal is granted, the reinstated SAP status will automatically allow the scholarship to pay and no additional scholarship appeal is necessary. Please contact Bronco Express for further questions at (269) 387-6000 or @email.\n\nTo retain your renewable Western Michigan University scholarship, you must:\n\nEnroll for at least 12 hours each fall and spring semester at WMU,\n\nPass a minimum of credit hours, per your initial scholarship offer, AND\n\nAchieve a minimum cumulative grade point average, per your initial scholarship offer.\n\nClasses taken at another university or college, or in either summer session at WMU, are not factored into your overall completion and cannot be used as part of your appeal. By submitting this form, you are explaining your deficiency and requesting reinstatement of your scholarship.\n\nAppeals for reinstatement should be received by Oct. 1 for fall reinstatement or March 1 for spring reinstatement. Once a scholarship has been lost, the student must appeal for reinstatement within one calendar year. Scholarship appeals will be considered and granted ONCE during your time at WMU. Appeals in subsequent years WILL NOT be considered and failure to meet renewal requirements will result in the loss of your scholarship. See our Scholarship Reinstatement Appeal form.\n\nGrants\n\nResidence Hall Grant\n\nReturning undergraduate students who have completed a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) that demonstrates financial need may qualify for a $4,000 WMU Residence Hall Grant that can be applied to the cost of their on-campus rooms. Students will be contacted if they qualify for the offer. Contacted students who indicate interest in the grant will be asked to reply with a deadline date, and preliminary offers will be made in the spring semester for the next academic year. A limited number of these offers are available. Please note: Campus apartment costs cannot be covered by the Residence Hall Grant.\n\nWMU Achievement Grant\n\nThe WMU Achievement Grant is a need-based grant for undergraduate students pursuing their first bachelor’s degree. Students must complete the FAFSA for the appropriate aid year, be enrolled at least half time and have an estimated family contribution (EFC) of up to $10,999. This grant is renewable, but students must reapply for financial aid and meet eligibility criteria each year. This grant is available to undergraduate students only.\n\nDependent tuition remission or reduction\n\nWestern offers a discount program for benefits-eligible employees and a remission program for the spouse and dependent children of employees with full-time benefits eligibility. Remission is 75% of tuition and required fees (records initiation fee, enrollment fee, student assessment fee and EUP technology fee) for courses offered and taken for academic credit at WMU and requires an application. Students must be enrolled as undergraduate students in credit-bearing courses to receive this benefit. More information is available through WMU Human Resources. Please note: The 100% tuition discount for faculty and staff is managed by Accounts Receivable.\n\nMore funding opportunities\n\nFederal student grants:\n\nA federal student grant is a type of financial aid that you don’t have to pay back. They come in the form of the federal Pell Grant, the federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant and the federal TEACH Grant.\n\nExplore federal offers\n\nState of Michigan scholarships:\n\nResidents of Michigan may qualify for scholarships or grants. The state of Michigan will notify WMU of student eligibility, and the financial aid office will offer students accordingly.\n\nExplore Michigan offers\n\nPrivate scholarships:\n\nPrivate scholarships are free funds from sources outside of WMU. Scholarships that are received from a private source must be reported to the University and must be factored in to existing student financial aid offers.\n\nExplore private offers\n\nLoans:\n\nLoans are another way to finance your education. Undergraduate and graduate students and parents of dependent students may borrow money to pay for educational expenses.\n\nExplore loan offers"
