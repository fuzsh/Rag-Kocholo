        "text": "Are you in a pinch and need to quickly measure something but don’t have a ruler or tape measure available? Follow along to learn how to make your own 6″ ruler using just a dollar bill.\n\nA dollar bill measures exactly 6.14″ x 2.61″, which means if you fold the dollar bill into six sections, you will have pretty close to 1-inch sections. Start by getting a crisp (or not) $1 bill.\n\nFold the Bill into Thirds\n\nThe first step is to fold the dollar bill into thirds. Make the first fold by lining up the dollar bill’s left edge to be precisely between the N and O in “note” as shown.\n\nMake sure the fold is even, then crease the fold.\n\nNext, fold the right edge of the bill into the first crease.\n\nThen make sure the fold is even and crease the fold.\n\nThe first set of folds are complete – success!\n\nFold the Bill into 1″ Sections\n\nOnce the bill is folded into thirds, it’s time to fold it further into 1″ sections. Start by folding the right edge into the right-most crease.\n\nJust as before, make sure the fold is even and then crease the fold.\n\nRepeat these steps on the left side. Start by folding the left edge into the left-most crease.\n\nMake sure the fold is even and crease.\n\nThe final fold is to fold the bill exactly in half. As with the other folds, make sure it is even and crease tightly.\n\nAdd Measurements\n\nAn optional final step is to add measurement markings on the fold lines. On every fold, draw a small line on the top or bottom edge.\n\nAfter drawing the lines, add the inch numbers. The dollar bill ruler is ready to use; measure away!\n\nThe dollar bill ruler is pretty cool! See our other measuring without a tape measure or ruler.\n\nJust a note on accuracy. Since a dollar bill is 6.14″ and not 6″ exactly the marks will be off by a fraction of an inch each. This is useful for measurements that do not need to be ultra-precise, but I assume if you’re making a ruler out of a dollar bill then this is close enough!\n\nFor improved accuracy, try one of our free printable rulers, or consider picking up a tape measure."
