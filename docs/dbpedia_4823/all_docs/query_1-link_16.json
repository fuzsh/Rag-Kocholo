        "text": "In general, for some number of hours, plus some fraction of an hour, you'd use the number, plus the fraction, plus \"hours\", plural. \"Four and a half hours.\", \"Three and three-quarters hours,\" etc.\n\nHowever, for the specific case of 1.5 hours, the usual expression is \"an hour and a half\". This usage is so common that \"One and a half hours\" actually sounds strange.\n\nOne and a half hours\n\nEnglish is a bit strange, if I'm talking about exactly one hour, then I say hour and not hours. For every other number, I use plural. This applies to every noun in the English language that has a plural tense:\n\nI have one dollar\n\nI have zero dollars\n\nI have 1.1 dollars\n\nI have -1 dollars\n\nI love hearing how English-as-a-second-language persons construct phrases like this! It's so fun. I can completely understand what they are trying to say, but marvel at how they construct the idea in a way that makes sense to them, but would be unusual for a native English speaker.\n\nHere are some ways native English speakers would describe time:\n\nVery common:\n\n\"an hour and a half\"\n\n\"one and a half hours\"\n\n\"an hour and thirty minutes\"\n\ncommon:\n\n\"ninety minutes\"\n\nsomewhat less common:\n\n\"one hour and thirty minutes\"\n\nuncommon:\n\n\"one hour, thirty minutes\"\n\nnot used:\n\n\"one hour, and one half hour\"\n\n\"the sum of an hour and half of an hour\"\n\n\"one hour, plus an additional half hour\"\n\n\"two hours minus one half hour\"\n\n\"seventy-five percent of two hours\"\n\nBasically, if it sounds like a math equation, it's probably not used!\n\nOther answers discuss writing the quantity as words. When writing things as numerals, however, I would suggest that the decimal fraction .5 as being a perfectly good way of indicating \"half\". For partial-hour quantities other than 30 minutes, I would avoid other decimal fractions unless times are being measured in six-minute or 36-second intervals, but .5 is so idiomatic as \"one half\" that I would consider \"1.5 hours\" to be more readable than \"1 hour and 30 minutes\" or \"1 1/2 hours\", or even \"1Â½ hours\".\n\nMy interpretation of the debate would be \"two and a half hours\" VS \"two and one half hours\". The latter was taught in grade school. Toss the fraction in as you wish."
