        "text": "Pratt offers undergraduate students various types of scholarships: a generous program of merit-based scholarships and restricted and endowed scholarships, as well as a variety of other special scholarships listed below under Additional Scholarships. In addition, need-based grants (gift) are added to the package to make the cost of attendance more affordable for more families.\n\nNet Cost\n\nIn considering colleges, it is important to understand whether the schools you are looking at award merit scholarships in addition to need-based aid. Pratt has a generous merit-based scholarship program. Three out of five freshmen at Pratt receive a merit scholarship. Check our Net Price Calculator to estimate your merit and need-based aid.\n\nPresidential Merit-Based Scholarships\n\nNOTE: Pratt is test optional. As a result, merit scholarships for high school applicants are based on GPA and portfolio only for all programs including architecture. Construction Management is based on GPA only as the program does not require a portfolio.\n\nThe Presidential Merit-based scholarships are awarded upon acceptance by the admissions office according to a carefully developed program. Transfer scholarships are based on portfolio and college GPA. All college transcripts are included in the calculation. Undergraduate students must maintain a 2.5 GPA to renew their scholarships each year. No separate scholarship application is required for consideration.\n\nCHECK OUR NET PRICE CALCULATOR : Receive an estimate of your merit-based scholarship and need-based aid using our easy calculator!\n\nNational Scholastic Scholarships\n\nPratt Institute recognizes The Scholastic Art Awards program of the Alliance for Young Artists & Writers as an appropriate and effective way for students interested in art and design to develop successful portfolios for college admission. Pratt reserves scholarships for qualified national awards recipients who independently and successfully apply to Pratt. These awards are in addition to any other merit scholarships the student has received from Pratt and are awarded for Scholastic awards in the senior year only. Pratt will award the following:\n\nPortfolio Gold Award Recipients in General Art or Photography: $3,000/year for four years\n\nPortfolio Silver Award Recipients in General Art or Photography: $2,000 a year for four years\n\nGold Award Recipients Individual works: $1,000 a year for four years\n\nThe Alliance for Young Artists and Writers will officially notify us of your National Award. For more information on the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards, visit the Alliance for Young Artists & Writers at www.artandwriting.org. (Please note that this award will not appear in your initial financial aid package since we usually do not receive official notification from the Alliance until after financial aid packages are determined.)\n\nOutside Scholarships for Domestic Students\n\nThe financial aid office has compiled a list of scholarships that domestic undergraduate students can apply for that are outside of Pratt Institute. These agencies are independent of Pratt and evaluate each application based on their own criteria. You may download the list below in the download module\n\nInternational scholarships\n\nInternational students are eligible for our international merit-based scholarships. International students do not qualify for need-based aid. There is no application for the merit-based scholarships awarded to incoming students, and all accepted applicants are considered automatically. To qualify for merit-based scholarships, you are not required to submit a FAFSA.\n\nOutside Scholarships for International Students\n\nThe financial aid office has complied a list of outside scholarships that international students can apply for. These agencies are independent of Pratt and evaluate each application based on their own criteria. You may download the list below in the download module.\n\nScholarships for Students Transferring from Pratt’s AAS program to the BFA\n\nStarting Fall 2024\n\nMerit scholarships are based on the student’s cumulative GPA in the associate’s program (AAS transfer-track program only) including the fall term of second year. Students in the career-track AOS are not eligible for these scholarships. Students who submit the FAFSA will also be considered for need-based aid. *Please note: a 2.7 cumulative GPA is required to automatically transfer from the AAS into the BFA. If the GPA is lower than 2.7, we will seek permission from the department to allow students to continue into the BFA, and admission will be at their discretion.\n\nPratt Munson Relocation Scholarships\n\nMerit scholarships are based on the student’s cumulative GPA at Pratt Munson including the fall term of second year. Brooklyn students who transfer to Pratt Munson will be considered for scholarships when they return to Pratt in Brooklyn based on their cumulative GPA from their first year at Pratt and their first semester of their second year at Pratt Munson. Students who submit the FAFSA will also be considered for need-based aid.\n\nStill have questions? Check out studentaid.ed.gov, a government website with excellent information on financial aid.\n\nRestricted and Endowed Scholarships\n\nThese scholarships and grants are awarded on the basis of academic achievement and/or financial need. There are no special financial aid forms for Restricted and Endowed Scholarships, although departmental applications may be required. Recipients are selected by deans or department chairpersons based on criteria established by the donors. These awards are made for one year only and are based on the availability of funds in any given year. A list of these scholarships is available in pdf form below.\n\nAdditional Restricted and Endowed Scholarships\n\nNOTE: The scholarships listed below do not require an additional application for consideration, however you must file the FAFSA by February 1. All accepted students meeting the criteria for scholarships listed below will automatically be considered upon acceptance and notified if they have been selected for one of these awards. It is not necessary to contact us if you would like to be considered; it is automatic.\n\nAlma H.
