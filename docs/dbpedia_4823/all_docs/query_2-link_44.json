        "text": "Find out if you can use GI Bill benefits for college as a Veteran, service member, or qualified dependent. Learn about payment rates for undergraduate and graduate degree courses at institutions of higher learning—like a 4-year university, community college, or graduate school.\n\nHow do you decide what my payments will be?\n\nWe decide your payment amounts based on the number of classes you go to and the hours spent in those classes. For example, for most undergraduate degrees, a college considers:\n\n12 or more hours full time\n\nBetween 9 and 11 hours three-quarter time\n\nBetween 6 and 8 hours half time\n\nLess than 6 hours reimbursable at a rate that’s no more than the tuition and fees charged for the course\n\nHow much does VA cover for graduate-level programs?\n\nThe school decides how to rate each hour. For example, if a graduate program at your school considers a 2-hour class full time, we’ll pay you the full-time rate.\n\nCan I take classes at more than one school at a time?\n\nYou can take classes at more than one school under the GI Bill as long as:\n\nThe classes at both schools count toward your degree, and\n\nThe school granting your degree considers the classes at the second school to be required in order to get your degree\n\nNote: The GI Bill won’t pay you to take the same class twice unless you get a failing grade in a class that the school requires for graduation.\n\nCan I use the GI Bill to pay for classes toward more than one degree?\n\nYes. After earning your first degree, you can use any GI Bill benefits you have left over to pay for classes for another degree.\n\nCan I use my VA education benefits to pay for preparatory courses?\n\nYes. You can use your VA education benefits to pay for courses that help you prepare for admissions tests required for college or graduate school. These “prep courses” help you prepare for tests like the SAT, the ACT, and others.\n\nFirst, contact your state approving agency and ask them to approve your prep course. The National Association of State Approving Agencies (NASAA) has a list of contacts by state.\n\nFind your state approving agency on the NASAA website\n\nThen, after you sign up for the prep course, ask the certifying official at the school or other educational program provider to submit an enrollment certification to us. If the prep course is at a school, you can usually find the school certifying official in the registrar’s or financial aid office.\n\nNote: You must have already applied and been approved for benefits through the Post-9/11 GI Bill, the Montgomery GI Bill, or Survivors’ and Dependents’ Educational Assistance.\n\nFind out how to apply for VA education benefits\n\nHow does VA make the payments?\n\nWe issue payments after each month’s classes. For example, you’ll get the payment for November classes in December.\n\nFor the Post-9/11 GI Bill, we pay:\n\nTuition and fees directly to the school\n\nMoney for books to you at the beginning of the term\n\nHousing allowance to you at the end of each month for the part of the month you’re enrolled in classes\n\nLearn about housing costs you’ll need to cover during school breaks"
