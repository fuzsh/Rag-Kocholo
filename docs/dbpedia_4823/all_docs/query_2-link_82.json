        "text": "Crane and Co., a Massachusetts-based company, has been providing the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing with paper for U.S. currency since 1879.\n\nFederal Reserve notes are a blend of 25 percent linen and 75 percent cotton. Currency paper has tiny red and blue synthetic fibers of various lengths evenly distributed throughout the paper.\n\nIt would take 4,000 double folds, forwards and backwards, to tear a banknote.\n\nNo matter the denomination, a banknote weighs approximately 1 gram. Because there are 454 grams in one pound, this means there are 454 notes in one pound of currency.\n\nWant to measure your notes in a different way? A stack of currency one mile high would contain more than 14.5 million banknotes.\n\nIt is estimated that between one-half to two-thirds of the value of all U.S. currency in circulation is outside of the U.S.\n\nIn 1934, the $100,000 Gold Certificate became the highest denomination ever issued. It was never intended for public use. Instead, it was meant solely for official transactions between Federal Reserve Banks."
