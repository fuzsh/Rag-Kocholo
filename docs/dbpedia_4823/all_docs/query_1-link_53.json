Money was available quick and there were no issues. I tried to send more money the next day and I get a phone call telling me that they need to verify some information from me. Okay thatâs fine. I give them my email, phone number, full name of the recipient. Then they ask me why Iâm sending the money? Why does it matter why Iâm sending the money itâs my own money? Then they ask when Iâm gonna send money next. I tell them I donât know, Iâm not sending it on a schedule, itâs money to help out a family member. The lady on the phone then tells me that I need to send in a valid ID and my bank statement to make sure Iâm not âcaught in a scamâ. I told her I canât send those in right now, Iâm in Mexico. She tells me that if they donât receive the documents within 48 hours the transaction will be canceled. I was sending the money because I needed it quick and this is not quick at all. The lady couldnât help me in this situation in any way. They also cancelled any transaction my boyfriend and his sister (who have sent money through this app many times) tried to send to the same family member. Ridiculous.\n\nDee9974 ,\n\nScary Business Practice\n\nUsed Xoom a couple of times successfully. I Had to reset my password and it warned me that if i forced a reset it would have to delete all my saved bank accounts. Good security practice which Iâm fine with so i went ahead with it. Then when i was processing a transfer I entered my bank account and it returned an error stating that this account already existed.. I tried my debit card and received same message. but I thought that it deleted all my previously saved accounts? I didnât get an option to use a saved account. Called customer service and the person very briefly told me that they could. It delete my accounts in the backend and there was no way for me to try to use them so there is nothing they can do and that the only option was for me to use another account. I explained that those were my only two accounts checking and debit and that I donât have a different account to use. Normally people just have one checking account. His answer bluntly was âsorry there is nothing we can doâ. He pretty much told me that I have to go do business with someone else. Needless to say I created an account with Remitfy and worked perfectly as advertised. cheaper fees also. Now I need to figure out how to get Xoom to delete my accounts from their systems. Itâs scary to know that they keep everyoneâs accounts in their databases permanently and their systems is so messed up that their customer service is telling people that they canât erase them!!"
