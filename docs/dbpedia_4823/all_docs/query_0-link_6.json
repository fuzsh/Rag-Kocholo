        "text": "Add or subtract two time-values\n\nUsing the time calculator, users can either add two time-values or find the difference between two time-values. The value fields ‘Day’, ‘Hour’, ‘Minute’ and ‘Second’ have been provided for both the time-values. In case, a value field is left blank, the result would be displayed accordingly.\n\nAdd or subtract a time-value from a date\n\nThis time calculator allows users to either add or subtract a time value from a ‘Start Time’, where the ‘Start Time’ is represented by a particular date along with a certain time on that date. The ‘Start Time’ comprises a date -- which can either be filled directly into the relevant value fields or entered using the calendar -- and a time value which has the value fields ‘Hour’, ‘Minute’, ‘Second’ and a drop-down menu to toggle between AM and PM. The time-value to be subtracted from the ‘Start Time’ consists of the value fields ‘Day’, ‘Hour’, ‘Minute’ and ‘Second’.\n\nMake time calculations using mathematical expressions\n\nHere, users can add and subtract a string of time-values using a mathematical expression. Value fields included in an expression are ‘Day’, ‘Hour’, ‘Minute’ and ‘Second’ denoted by the letters ‘d’, ‘h’, ‘m’ and ‘s’ respectively.\n\nTime Duration Calculators\n\nFind the difference between two time-values\n\nThe calculator can be used to determine the difference between two time-values.\n\nThe calculator has two fields -- ‘Start Time’ and ‘End Time’. Both the fields have options to enter the required number of hours, minutes and seconds and to choose between ‘AM’ and ‘PM’. Enter the required details in both the fields and click on the ‘CALCULATE’ button to know the difference between both the time values.\n\nThe output displayed is either in terms of hours, minutes and seconds or only in hours or minutes or seconds.\n\nIf the time-value provided in the ‘Start Time’ field is ahead of that provided in the ‘End Time’ field, then the calculator automatically assumes the ‘Start Date’ to be on the previous day.\n\nThe input provided in the hours, minutes and seconds sections of the ‘Start Time’ and ‘End Time’ fields need to be valid values. The value provided in the ‘hours’ section should be less than 24, that in the ‘minutes’ section has to be less than 60 and the input in the ‘seconds’ section should also be less than 60.\n\nFind the time gap between two dates\n\nThe calculator finds the time difference between a certain time on a start date and a certain time on the end date.\n\nThe calculator has a ‘Start Time’ and an ‘End Time’ field. Both the fields allow users to enter the start date or end date by either choosing the required date from a calendar or by entering the month, date and year in their respective sections. Additionally, users can also enter a certain time value by entering required details in the ‘hour’, ‘minute’ and ‘second’ sections and choosing between ‘AM’ or ‘PM’ in the ‘Start Time’ and ‘End Time’ fields or by clicking on the ‘now’ button to select the current time.\n\nEnter the relevant details in the input fields and click on the ‘CALCULATE’ button to determine the time gap between two dates. The input provided in the ‘Start Time’ field should be earlier than that in the ‘End Time’ field.\n\nThe output shown is either in terms of days, hours, minutes and seconds or only in terms of days or hours or minutes and seconds.\n\nWhat is a time or a time duration calculator?\n\nA time calculator is an algorithmic digital tool that can be used to add/subtract various time-values and make different types of time calculations such as finding the time difference between two important events, determining the date 3 years before today, knowing how many hours, minutes or seconds are there in a year, etc.\n\nBasic things to know while making time calculations\n\nTime, as we know it, can range from several years to a few seconds. So, while making calculations using the above calculators, it’s important to know some basic units of time and the calendar system used for designing these calculators.\n\nHere is a list of some basic units of time:\n\nUNIT\n\nDEFINITION\n\nMillennium\n\n1,000 years\n\nCentury\n\n100 years\n\nDecade\n\n10 years\n\nYear (average)\n\n365.242 days or 12 months\n\nNormal Year\n\n365 days or 12 months\n\nLeap Year\n\n366 days or 12 months\n\nQuarter\n\n3 months\n\nMonth\n\n28-31 days\n\nJan, Mar, May, Jul, Aug, Oct, Dec have 31 days &\n\nApr, Jun, Sep, Nov have 30 days.\n\nFeb has 28 days in a normal year and 29 days in a leap year\n\nWeek\n\n7 days\n\nDay\n\n24 hours or 1,440 minutes or 86,400 seconds\n\nHour\n\n60 minutes or 3,600 seconds\n\nMinute\n\n60 seconds\n\nSecond\n\nbase unit\n\nThe calendar used:\n\nThese calculators use the Georgian calendar to make calculations. In this calendar, a year is divided into 365 days, with the exception of a leap year, which has 366 days. The total number of days in a calendar year are categorized into 12 months of varying lengths. Each month either has 30 or 31 days, except the month of February which has 28 days in a normal year and 29 days in a leap year.\n\nHow do the calculators work?\n\nThe first calculator basically lets users determine the sum or the difference between two time-values. Here, time values are represented in terms of days, hours, minutes and seconds.\n\nThe input section of the calculator has two rows consisting of the value fields ‘Day’, ‘Hour’, ‘Minute’ and ‘Second’ in each row and two buttons to select either ‘Add+’ or ‘Subtract-’ placed in between those two rows. Similarly, the output section has a row consisting of all the value fields that are present in the input rows.\n\nThe input provided can either be in whole numbers or decimal, but they should be positive rational numbers. The value entered in the first row of the input section can either be greater or smaller than the value entered in the second row. Additionally, if need be, users can choose to leave any of the value fields or multiple value fields in the input section blank.\n\nThe output displayed is either a positive or a negative value based on the input provided and the function (+ or -) chosen. The output time value also consists of the value fields ‘Day’, ‘Hour’, ‘Minute’ and ‘Second’. Additionally, this calculator also displays the result in terms of days, hours, minutes and seconds individually.\n\nThe second calculator can either add a time value to or subtract a time value from a particular date and a certain time on that date.\n\nHere, the upper part of the input section is called ‘Start Time’. The ‘Start Time’ consists of two sub-sections. One where the date is to be filled and another where the time. By default, the ‘Start Time’ initially shows the current date and time. The date can either be filled by filling up all the required sections i.e. month, date and year individually or by clicking on the calendar button. The input for the time part can be provided by entering relevant values in the ‘Hour’, ‘Minute’ and ‘Second’ sections and choosing either ‘AM’ or ‘PM’ from the drop-down menu beside it.\n\nThe lower part of this calculator has the value fields ‘Day’, ‘Hour’, ‘Minute’ and ‘Second’ to provide input for the time-value that is to be added or subtracted from the concerned date and time. Users can choose either to add or subtract the time-values from the middle section by clicking either on the ‘Add+’ or the ‘Subtract-’ button.\n\nThe result displayed is a date and a time on that date which is either before or after the date in the ‘Start Time’ field depending on the function (add or subtract) chosen.\n\nIn the third calculator, time-values based calculations can be carried out using mathematical expressions. The mathematical expressions used in this calculator are made up of days, hours, minutes and seconds which are denoted by the letters ‘d’, ‘h’, ‘m’ and ‘s’ respectively.\n\nJust like the previous calculators, this calculator can also only perform addition and subtraction of time-values. The time-values provided as input to this calculator should be a number accompanied by the letter which represents its unit.\n\nFor example: 3d 4h 5m 6s, 8h 25m, 1d 0h 0m 3s, 3600s, etc.\n\nThe output displayed is in terms of days, hours, minutes and seconds. The result is also shown individually in terms of days, hours, minutes and seconds.\n\nIntriguing facts about time\n\nEvery time zone used across the globe begins from a common point situated in Greenwich, England which is known as the Prime Meridian or Greenwich Meridian. And the time at that common point is known as Universal Time or Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)\n\nOur ancestors used sundials to determine time almost exactly. The world’s largest stone sundial is located at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi, India\n\nThe concept of a leap year was introduced to the world by the Roman general Julius Caesar\n\nPeter Henle built the first modern clock around 1511\n\nThe most precise clock to be ever built is the strontium atomic clock\n\nTime slows down when you move faster\n\nThere are 12 different time zones in France, 11 in Russia and 11 in the United States\n\nSome theories suggest that time might end within the next four billion years"
