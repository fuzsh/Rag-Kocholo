See how we rate products and services to help you make smart decisions with your money.\n\nEveryone has ripped paper money from time to time.\n\nMost try to tape it up or toss it out.\n\nBut you may be able to return it to the bank for a refund.\n\nIf it's torn too badly, you can mail it in for a refund.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost people have painstakingly taped together a ripped dollar bill at some point in their lives in the hopes of salvaging the mangled money. But one enterprising Twitter user tipped off the internet to an easier way of recovering the torn cash.\n\n\"Daily Show\" writer Dan Amira took to Twitter on Tuesday with a money hack that will have people regretting giving up on their cash just because it went through the laundry a few too many times. He shared a photo of a $10 bill ripped in half, a letter he wrote to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing asking for a reimbursement check, and a check from the U.S. Treasury for $10.\n\n\"I used to think the government was bad, but now I think it is good,\" he tweeted. Judging by the 2,000+ favorites his tweet has amassed in less than 24 hours, he isn't the only one.\n\nAmira learned about the trick from Planet Money's podcast episode \"The Money Fixers,\" and it absolutely works.\n\nThe Mutilated Currency Division of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing has a team of US currency experts that handle damaged money for free. Time reported that the BEP handles \"about 30,000 claims a year to the tune of more than $30 million.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked for comment about the hack, Amira told INSIDER: \"I thought this was pretty cool until I posted it on Twitter and dozens of people told me I could have just brought it to the bank.\"\n\nThose commenters are correct in pointing out that returning the money to a physical bank is a viable option – so long as three-quarters of a bill are intact, and the bill is only ripped in two.\n\nFor more aggressive tears and barely-legible currency, the BEP is the best option. According to its website, some of the \"most common causes\" of mutilated currency include explosives, fire, animal damage, and deterioration by burying.\n\nSign up here to get INSIDER's favorite stories straight to your inbox."
