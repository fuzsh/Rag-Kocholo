        "text": "This metric represents the average amount of time an agent spends interacting with a customer per talk segment for a defined period of time.\n\nCalculation: Talk time per interaction segment/# of talk segments\n\nFor example, an agent handles ten calls, each with two talk time segments of three minutes each. 3,600 sec/20 segments = 180 seconds or 3 minutes\n\nTalk segments occur each time an agent talks to a customer. For example, an agent talks with a customer for two minutes, then places the customer on hold for two minutes. The agent returns to talk to the customer for two more minutes, and then disconnects. There are two talk time segments for this interaction.\n\nOnly interactions that end within a given time period are used to calculate the average talk time for that period."
