        "text": "Hello there everyone! I am not extremely familiar with paper money and all of the errors and rarities that one may encounter since I mostly collect coins. However, I have heard of \"off-center\" or \"miscut\" notes and I believe I have one.\n\nI found this 2013 dollar bill while searching through some bills. I was curious: How off-center/miscut does a bill have to be in order to be worth keeping? Is this one dramatic enough to keep?\n\nIt kind of reminds me of misaligned dies on coins. Some slight misalignment is normal, but if dramatic enough it is a good find.\n\nThanks\n\nit is a misaligned/off center cut still nice and a keeper.\n\nYour bill is within the BEP tolerance for printing. The BEP would not consider this misaligned or improper cutting.\n\nThis bill is considered miss cut.\n\nAlso, this can happen horizontally as well as vertically.\n\nIn order to have any added value, a miss cut printing typically must show some of the adjacent bill. The more the adjacent bill shows the greater the added value.\n\nA miss cut bill will have the same amount of displacement on both sides.\n\nAlso, remember that the printing on the back of the bill is smaller than the printing on the front. This gives the appearance of more displacement on the back when it does not really exist.\n\nA misaligned bill will usually show one side off center, or part of another bill, while the other side is properly centered.\n\nHey! I was thinking about you when I was watching the Unabomb series on Netflix. LOL.\n\nYeah, Ted was a neighbor, but that was before my time here. He used to hitch a ride with the mailman from Lincoln to Marysville and sleep on the floor of the local bar."
