        "text": "Eager to fill your books over the next few months? Want to slot in lots of money-making express services? Try offering these gorgeous, fast-track choices that get busy clients out the door in a flash — AND deliver that much-needed seasonal refresh. With the help of our express-service superstar, Lumi10, and Joico Global Brand Education Expert, Ricardo Santiago, we’ve got your menu planned….\n\n✔️ THE FAST FACE-FRAME\n\nOffer a bold money piece to brighten and update a client’s look without having to do a full makeover.\n\n✔️ GRAY DAYS AWAY\n\nPlanting season is here, so bury that regrowth and nail 100% gray coverage in only 10 minutes with LUMI10 Permanent Crème Color – your clients get lasting, full-coverage color results with no stress, in half the time.\n\n✔️ GLAZE AND AMAZE\n\n“Urge clients to try a new tone for the change of season, with the comfort of knowing that their highlights won’t be affected long term, because color will fade naturally,” says Ricardo.\n\n✔️ SEE THAT SHADOW ROOT\n\nSeeing that shadow doesn’t always mean six more weeks of winter…it means spring hair color is here! Deliver the perfect shadow root and make those highlights pop in just 10 minutes by using LUMI10 to achieve some delish contrast and dimension.\n\n✔️ RIBBONS OF SPRING COLOR\n\nAnother quick way to add eye-catching dimension? Ricardo suggests creating extra panels of balayage along with or over your existing color for a fast – and fabulous – boost.\n\n✔️ RAYS OF SUNSHINE\n\nUse LUMI10 to lighten and brighten roots up to two levels – it’s a super-fast service for clients who want a permanent-color retouch, or when you need to break the base for extra spring/summer sizzle.\n\n✔️ WEAR THOSE SHADES\n\nWelcome spring with a peek-a-boo pop of color using Joico Color Intensity Shades – or even create a custom-formulated color glaze that you can apply at the shampoo bowl. The choices are joi-ful…from Blush to Lilac to Kelly Green and everything in between!"
