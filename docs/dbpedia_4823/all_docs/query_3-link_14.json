        "text": "Many of you who have taken my classes know that I’m not a fan of measuring your knitting in progress. I believe it’s always best to trust your finished row gauge and keep track of rows.\n\nThat being said, I know there are times when you just want to check to see how many inches you’ve knit and sometimes (gasp) you might not have a ruler handy. No need to fear, there’s plenty of ways you can learn\n\nHow to to Measure Without a Ruler!\n\n1) Dollar Bill\n\nThe bill is just shy of being a perfect measure. It is a bit over 2 1/2″ high (two bills stacked together make a measure just shy of 5 1/4″) and it’s a bit over 6″ long . . . but in a pinch to get a rough estimate think:\n\n2 1/2″ high x 6″ long\n\n2) Credit Card\n\nThe average credit card makes a nice sturdy ruler. It measures:\n\n2 1/8″ high x 3 3/8″ long\n\n3) Quarter\n\nMakes a pretty darn good 1″ measure\n\n4) Paper!\n\nWe all remember learning as a kid, a regular sheet of paper measures:\n\n8 1/2″ wide x 11″ high\n\n5) Your Thumb\n\nBy far my favorite “ruler”. The top of my thumb knuckle to the tip of my thumb is 1″\n\nEnjoy!"
