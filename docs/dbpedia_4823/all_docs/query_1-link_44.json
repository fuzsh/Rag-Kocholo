        "text": "WAGES, PAY AND BENEFITS\n\nWhen are pay raises required?\n\nPay raises are generally a matter of agreement between an employer and employee (or the employee's representative). Pay raises to amounts above the Federal minimum wage are not required by the FLSA.\n\nIs extra pay required for weekend or night work?\n\nExtra pay for working weekends or nights is a matter of agreement between the employer and the employee (or the employee's representative). The FLSA does not require extra pay for weekend or night work. However, the FLSA does require that covered, nonexempt workers be paid not less than time and one-half the employee's regular rate for time worked over 40 hours in a workweek.\n\nHow are vacation pay, sick pay, holiday pay computed and when are they due?\n\nThe FLSA does not require payment for time not worked, such as vacations, sick leave or holidays (Federal or otherwise). These benefits are matters of agreement between an employer and an employee (or the employee's representative).\n\nHow is severance calculated and when is it due?\n\nThe FLSA requires payment of at least the minimum wage for all hours worked in a workweek and time and one-half an employee's regular rate for time worked over 40 hours in a workweek. There is no requirement in the FLSA for severance pay. Severance pay is a matter of agreement between an employer and an employee (or the employee's representative).\n\nThe Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) may be able to assist an employee who did not receive severance pay required in his or her employment contract.\n\nWhen must breaks and meal periods be given?\n\nThe FLSA does not require breaks or meal periods be given to workers. Some states may have requirements for breaks or meal periods. If you work in a state which does not require breaks or meal periods, these benefits are a matter of agreement between the employer and the employee (or the employee's representative).\n\nIn general, the FLSA does not require breaks or meal periods be given to workers. However, all employers covered by the FLSA must comply with the Act's break time for nursing mothers provision. Please refer to the Wage and Hour Division's Nursing Mothers website to obtain additional information on this topic. Some states may have additional requirements for breaks or meal periods. If you work in a state which does not require breaks or meal periods, these benefits are a matter of agreement between the employer and the employee (or the employee's representative).\n\nWhat must an employer provide to workers who want to express breast milk in the workplace?\n\nEffective March 23, 2010, employers are required under the FLSA to provide unpaid break time and space for nursing mothers to express breast milk for one year after the child's birth. Where employers already provide compensated breaks, an employee who uses that break time to express milk must be compensated in the same way that other employees are compensated for break time. See WHD Fact Sheet # 73, Break Time for Nursing Mothers under FLSA. In addition, the FLSAâ€™s general requirement that the employee must be completely relieved from duty or else the time must be compensated as work time applies. See WHD Fact Sheet #22, Hours Worked Under FLSA. Please refer to the Wage and Hour Division's Nursing Mothers website to obtain additional information on this topic.\n\nAre periodic performance evaluations required?\n\nThe FLSA does not require performance evaluations. Performance evaluations are generally a matter of agreement between an employer and employee (or the employee's representative).\n\nOVERTIME AND WORK HOURS\n\nWhen is overtime due?\n\nFor covered, nonexempt employees, the FLSA requires overtime pay at a rate of not less than one and one-half times an employee's regular rate of pay after 40 hours of work in a workweek. Some exceptions to the 40 hours per week standard apply under special circumstances to police officers and fire fighters employed by public agencies and to employees of hospitals and nursing homes.\n\nSome states have also enacted overtime laws. Where an employee is subject to both the state and Federal overtime laws, the employee is entitled to overtime according to the higher standard (i.e., the standard that will provide the higher rate of pay).\n\nHow many hours per day or per week can an employee work?\n\nThe FLSA does not limit the number of hours per day or per week that employees aged 16 years and older can be required to work.\n\nHow many hours is full-time employment? How many hours is part-time employment?\n\nThe FLSA does not define full-time employment or part-time employment. This is a matter generally to be determined by the employer. Whether an employee is considered full-time or part-time does not change the application of the FLSA.\n\nWhen can an employee's scheduled hours of work be changed?\n\nThe FLSA has no provisions regarding the scheduling of employees, with the exception of certain child labor provisions. Therefore, an employer may change an employee's work hours without giving prior notice or obtaining the employee's consent (unless otherwise subject to a prior agreement between the employer and employee or the employee's representative).\n\nWhen is double time due?\n\nThe FLSA has no requirement for double time pay. This is a matter of agreement between an employer and employee (or the employee's representative).\n\nIs extra pay required for weekend or night work?\n\nExtra pay for working weekends or nights is a matter of agreement between the employer and the employee (or the employee's representative). The FLSA does not require extra pay for weekend or night work. However, the FLSA does require that covered, nonexempt workers be paid not less than time and one-half the employee's regular rate for time worked over 40 hours in a workweek.\n\nRECORDKEEPING AND NOTICES\n\nAre pay stubs required?\n\nThe FLSA does require that employers keep accurate records of hours worked and wages paid to employees. However, the FLSA does not require an employer to provide employees pay stubs.\n\nWhat notices must be given before an employee is terminated or laid off?"
