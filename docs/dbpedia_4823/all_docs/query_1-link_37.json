Purchases from vendors are at the buyer’s sole risk. CDCR assumes no liability for such purchases. Any issues or disputes regarding the vendor’s products are the sole responsibility of the buyer and/or vendor, and CDCR is not obligated to mediate or resolve any such disputes (Department Operations Manual Section 54030.9.1(a)(7)).\n\nAny funds sent to an inmate will still be subject to restitution as ordered by the sentencing court. However, families that purchase packages directly from a vendor are not impacted by restitution.\n\nRelevant Regulations and Policy"
