        "text": "Currency\n\nWithin the Federal Reserve System, there are three entities responsible for the management and distribution of currency.\n\nThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is the issuing authority for Federal Reserve notes, the currency of the United States. The Board has a wide range of responsibilities related to Federal Reserve notes, from ensuring an adequate supply to protecting and maintaining confidence in U.S. currency through well-controlled operations with sufficient capacity to meet the needs of the marketplace.\n\nWorking very closely with the Board, the Federal Reserve System's Cash Product Office (CPO) is responsible for strategic leadership to Reserve Bank cash departments by formulating policies, operational guidance, and technology strategies for U.S. currency and coin services provided nationally and internationally. The CPO's primary mission and responsibility is to maintain public confidence in U.S. currency. To inform strategic FedCash Services decisions, the CPO also conducts research, engages with cash industry partners, and looks at a variety of data sources to deepen the Federal Reserve’s understanding of how changes in the payments landscape in the U.S. could influence future demand for cash.\n\nThe 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks and their branches distribute Federal Reserve notes to the public through depository institutions. Reserve Banks process notes on high-speed sorting machines that check to ensure they are genuine and fit for commerce. If the notes are deemed suspect counterfeits, Reserve Banks forward them to the local U.S. Secret Service field office. If they are genuine and still in good condition, the notes are sent to depository institutions to fill orders for currency. An individual note continues moving through this cycle until it is deemed unfit, or too worn, to be kept in circulation. Unfit notes are destroyed on-site at Reserve Banks in order to maintain the quality of currency in circulation.\n\nCoins\n\nUnlike currency, the United States Mint is the issuing authority for coins. Reserve Banks distribute new and circulated coin to depository institutions to meet the public's demand, and take as deposits coin that exceeds the public's needs.\n\nSOURCE: Board of Governors, FAQs (Off-site)\n\nFederal Reserve notes are not redeemable in gold, silver or any other commodity. Federal Reserve notes have not been redeemable in gold since January 30, 1934, when the Congress amended Section 16 of the Federal Reserve Act to read: \"The said [Federal Reserve] notes shall be obligations of the United States. They shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the Treasury Department of the United States, in the city of Washington, District of Columbia, or at any Federal Reserve Bank.\" Federal Reserve notes have not been redeemable in silver sing the 1960s. The Congress has specified that Federal Reserve Banks must hold collateral equal in value to the Federal Reserve notes that the Federal Reserve Banks place into circulation. This collateral is chiefly held in the form of U.S. Treasury, federal agency and government-sponsored securities.\n\nSOURCE: Board of Governors, FAQs (Off-site)\n\nMutilated currency is a note that has been damaged to the extent that one-half or less of the note remains, or its value is questionable and special examination by trained experts at the Department of the Treasury or the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) (Off-site) is required before any exchange is made.\n\nThe Federal Reserve DOES NOT accept deposits of mutilated currency. Mutilated currency must be sent directly to the BEP with a letter stating the estimated value of the currency and an explanation of how the currency became mutilated.\n\nCall the BEP toll-free number, (866) 575-2361, or visit the BEP website (Off-site) to obtain information on shipping instructions for mutilated currency, and to see photographic examples.\n\nFor more information on mutilated currency, please visit the Mutilated Currency and Bent or Partial Coin procedures page.\n\nThe best way to determine whether a note is genuine is to rely on the security features, such as the watermark and security thread. Counterfeit detection pens are not always accurate and may give you false results. To learn about these and other security features in genuine Federal Reserve notes, visit the U.S. Currency Education Program website.\n\nIt is important to know what the security features are in genuine currency, because if you end up with a counterfeit note, you will lose that money. A counterfeit note cannot be exchanged for a genuine one, and it is illegal to knowingly pass counterfeit currency.\n\nIf you live in the United States and think you have received a counterfeit note, immediately notify the local police. Try to remember the physical characteristics of the person who passed the suspect counterfeit, and if possible, write down the person's license plate number and vehicle description. Store the suspect counterfeit apart from genuine currency and release it as soon as possible to law enforcement authorities.\n\nIf you live outside the United States and want to report counterfeit currency, you should notify the U.S. Secret Service field office (Off-site) in your region. The Law Enforcement section of the Board of Governors’ currency education website, www.uscurrency.gov (Off-site), offers contact information for U.S. Secret Service field offices around the world.\n\nSOURCE: Board of Governors, FAQs (Off-site)\n\nCurrency is printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, and coins are produced by the U.S. Mint. Each year, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors determines the number of new Federal Reserve notes that are needed and submits a print order to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The order reflects the Federal Reserve's estimate of the amount of currency that the public will need in the upcoming year. The Bureau of Engraving and Printing and U.S. Mint ship new currency and coin to the Federal Reserve Banks. New coins are shipped in bulk bags, and new currency is shipped in distinctive colored packages, called \"cashpaks.\" When financial institutions, such as commercial banks, credit unions, and savings and loans, need currency for their customers, they can place an order with their local Federal Reserve Bank, which in turn supplies the requested currency using a mix of recirculated currency and coin along with new currency and coin. Learn more about the cash lifecycle (Off-site) on the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco's cash website and view a video (Off-site) on the Board of Governors' annual currency print order."
