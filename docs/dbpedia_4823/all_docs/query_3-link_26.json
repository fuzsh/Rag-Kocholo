        "text": "Welcome to the Smartick blog! In this week’s post, we are going to learn how to calculate halves, thirds, and fourths. These expressions are not only used in math problems, but also in daily life.\n\nDo you know what they are? Do you know how to calculate them? In this post, you will realize how easy it is to calculate halves, thirds, and fourths.\n\nHalves\n\nOne half is equivalent to the fraction: 1/2. Therefore, it is half of any amount. Halves are calculated by dividing by 2.\n\nFor example:\n\nOne half of 10 = ½ of 10 = 10/2 = 5.\n\nOne half of 34 = ½ of 34 = 34/2 = 17.\n\nThree halves of 14 = 3/2 of 14 = 3 x 14/2 = 3 x 7 = 21.\n\nThirds\n\nOne third is equivalent to the fraction: 1/3. Therefore, it is a third of an amount. Thirds are calculated by dividing by 3.\n\nFor example:\n\nOne third of 24 =1/3 of 24 = 24/3 = 8.\n\nOne third of 33 =1/3 of 33 = 33/3 = 11.\n\nFive thirds of 15 = 5/3 of 15 = 5 x 15/3 = 5 x 5 = 25.\n\nFourths\n\nOne fourth is equivalent to the fraction: 1/4. Therefore, it is a quarter of an amount. Fourths are calculated by dividing by 4.\n\nFor example:\n\nOne fourth of 20 = ¼ of 20 = 20/4 = 5.\n\nOne fourth of 28 = ¼ of 28 = 28/4 = 7.\n\nSeven fourths of 8 = 7/4 of 8 = 7 x 8/4 = 7 x 2 = 14.\n\nHave you learned about halves, thirds, and fourths? Feel free to share this post with your friends and colleagues so that they too can learn.
