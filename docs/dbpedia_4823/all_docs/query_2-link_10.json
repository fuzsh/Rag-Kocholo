It wouldn't be the first time they'd done something that surprised me a bit. They might not, too, with which I wouldn't argue.\n\nWhether they have to keep it, I don't know. I can see how they wouldn't want them floating around a lot, though, so keeping it might make some sense is all I'm saying.

They pull notes out of circulation all the time, sending them to the Fed for tracking and eventual destruction. It's part of what banks are required to do in the US.\n\nFeb 13, 2014\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#24\n\n[url=http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=26238105#p26238105:3potqtb4 said:\n\nHoos[/url]\":3potqtb4]I thought the rule was that the bill had to show the full serial number on one half and part of it on the other to be considered \"legal tender\".\n\nHalf of a bill of any value in the U.S. hasn't been accepted anywhere, AFAIK, for a long time.
