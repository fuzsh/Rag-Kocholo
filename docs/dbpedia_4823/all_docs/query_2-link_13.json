In such instances, the entire submission will be destroyed or retained as evidence.\n\nA submission appears to be part of, or intended to further, any criminal scheme. In such instances, the entire submission will be destroyed or retained as evidence.\n\nA submission contains a material misrepresentation of facts.\n\nFragments and remnants presented are not identifiable as United States currency.\n\nFragments and remnants presented which represent 50% or less of a note are identifiable as United States currency but the method of destruction and supporting evidence do not satisfy the Treasury that the missing portion has been totally destroyed.\n\nBEP is now accepting in-person deliveries of mutilated currency in Washington, DC.\n\nSubmit a Request for Examination of Mutilated Currency for Possible Redemption\n\nFederal Reserve Currency Procedures for Financial Institutions"
