        "text": "On your settlement date, we automatically pay back the advance (plus express fees and optional tips) using your connected bank accounts based on your available funds. This brings your negative account balance to $0. If you canât pay the full balance, we run partial settlements instead. We donât charge interest or late fees, so settling up wonât come with surprises.\n\nTip: To ensure your settlement runs smoothly, donât disconnect or change your connected bank account information between the time you request an advance and your settlement date.\n\n1Based on internal data as of March 30, 2023, for users who had connected an external bank account and transferred an advance to their Dave Checking Account. ExtraCashâ¢ is a DDA account with overdraft utility, advances are subject to eligibility requirements and identity verification. Taking an ExtraCashâ¢ advance will make your account balance negative. Express delivery fees apply to instant transfers. As of January 2024, the average approval amount for disbursed advances is $160 in the trailing six months. See the Dave ExtraCashâ¢ Deposit Agreement and Disclosures for more details.\n\n2108M meals have been donated by Dave via member tips as of April 2023. Data is calculated as 10 meals pledged per dollar donated. Dave donates $0.10 for every percentage tipped. $1 helps provide at least 10 meals secured by Feeding America on behalf of local member food banks.\n\n3Cool-off periods happen when you settle an advance that has not yet posted to your ExtraCashâ¢ account. This can take 1â3 business days. You can still deposit funds into your ExtraCashâ¢ account during this period."
