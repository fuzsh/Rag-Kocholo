        "text": "Note: This page reflects the 6th edition of the APA manual, which is now out of date. It will remain online until 2021, but will not be updated. There is currently no equivalent 7th edition page, but we're working on one. Thank you for your patience. Here is a link to our APA 7 \"General Format\" page.\n\nIn general, APA style recommends using words to express numbers below 10, and using numerals when expressing numbers 10 and above. See below for a more extensive list.\n\nNumbers expressed as numerals\n\nIn addition to expressing numbers 10 and above, the following are other instances when you would use numerals rather than words:\n\nNumbers mentioned in the abstract, a table, or a figure in the paper (this allows for brevity)\n\nThis study consisted of 8 tests.\n\nNumbers that immediately precede a unit of measurement\n\n2.54 cm, 1.5 gal\n\nNumbers that represent statistical or mathematical functions, fractional or decimal quantities, percentages, ratios, percentiles, and quartiles\n\nnumbers that represent time, dates, ages, scores and point values on a scale, exact sums of money, and numerals\n\n2 hr 30 min\n\n10:00 am\n\n50-year-olds\n\nA 10-point scale\n\n$100\n\nException: Use words for approximations of numbers of days, weeks, months, or years\n\nRoughly six months ago\n\nNumbers that denote a specific place in a numbered series, parts of books and tables, and each number in a list of four or more numbers\n\nIllustration 1\n\nNumbers expressed as words\n\nIn addition to using words to express numbers below 10, use words to also express:\n\nNumbers beginning a sentence, title, or text heading\n\nFifteen participants were in the control group.\n\nCommon fractions\n\nThree fourths of the population\n\nCommon phrases or groups\n\nSeven Wonders of the World\n\nThe Three Musketeers\n\nOther Rules Concerning Numbers\n\nHere are a few more rules concerning numbers to adhere to as you follow APA style:\n\nIf you are using two modifiers against a noun, use a combination of both numerals and words\n\nThree 5-point scales\n\nIf youâ€™re unsure which modifier to write and which to express numerically, try it both ways. Be sure the way you express the numbers is in the clearest way possible.\n\nPlace a zero before a decimal fraction less than 1 if the statistic can exceed 1.\n\n0.54 in\n\nIf the statistic cannot exceed 1, you do not need a zero.\n\np = .85\n\nFor more specific guidelines, talk to your instructor or refer to the Style Manual."
