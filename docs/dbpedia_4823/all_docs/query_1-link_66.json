        "text": "Welcome Aboard FAX!\n\nWE ARE FRESNO’S FAST & EFFICIENT TRANSIT SYSTEM… offering 18 ﬁxed-route bus lines and Handy Ride Paratransit Service, all designed to help you get wherever you need to go! We take pride in serving the greater Fresno Metropolitan Area with high-quality transit service – with a modern ﬂeet of over 115 buses and a dedicated team of transit professionals. Fresno Area Express is operated by the City of Fresno as a public service to all the residents and visitors of Fresno.\n\nFIND THE CORRECT BUS ROUTE – The ﬁrst step in riding the bus is ﬁnding the correct bus route (or routes) to reach your destination. Use the FAX System Map to determine which route is best. Remember that you can transfer from one route to another to reach your destination.\n\nFIND OUT WHAT TIME THE BUS WILL ARRIVE AT YOUR STOP – Use this FAX Schedule Guide to ﬁnd out what time the bus serves the route you are planning to use. FAX regular service hours are Monday through Friday 5:30 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., and weekends 6:30 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Late-night service is available on select routes until approximately midnight Monday through Saturday (see the Night Service Map for details).\n\nCATCHING THE BUS – Please remember that buses will only stop at designated stops. Designated stops include FAX bus stop signs that show which route(s) serves that stop. If you are seated at a shelter, or on a bus bench, please stand up, if you are physically able, to let the driver know you wish to board. If you are boarding with a stroller, please have the item folded and ready.\n\nPAYING YOUR FARE – Cash, tickets, passes, and transfers can be used on all buses. If you use cash, exact fare is recommended because the fareboxes do not make change. Instead, you will receive a change card that can be used on future rides. Change cards cannot be redeemed for cash and will not be issued for values less than 25¢. Have your fare ready when the bus arrives. The farebox accepts $1, $5, $10, and $20 bills. Note: Every bus station along Route 1 (The Q), includes a ticket vending machine; FAX encourages passengers to prepay on Route 1 to speed up the boarding process and keep the bus moving on time.\n\nLEAVING THE BUS – Be alert for your destination. To signal the bus driver to stop, pull the cord above the windows or press the rubber strip between the windows a minimum of one block before your desired bus stop. Wait until the bus comes to a complete stop before leaving your seat. Remember that buses will stop only at designated bus stops. Leave through the rear doors if possible to allow new passengers to board. At the end of the line, passengers must exit the bus.\n\nTRANSFERS – Transfers are free with a paid fare and allow unlimited transfers for 90 minutes on all routes in any direction. Transfers must be requested from the bus driver at the time of boarding.\n\nLOST AND FOUND – To inquire about lost items call (559) 621-RIDE (7433). If possible, let us know the date and description of the item(s) so that we may better assist you in locating the lost item(s).\n\nTRANSPORTATION FOR CITY OF FRESNO COOLING AND HEATING CENTERS – FAX will provide transportation to City of Fresno Cooling and Heating Centers when they are open. Passengers just need to inform the bus driver of their destination, and the ride if free.\n\nFAX CARTS AND CARGO POLICY – FAX bus drivers and supervisors have the authority to determine if a cart, stroller, or other items are too big or dangerous to be transported safely on the bus. Riders are limited to bags or items that can be reasonably carried on their laps when seated or placed safely under, or in front of, their seats. Please refer to the FAX Carts and Cargo Policy located on our website here: https://www.fresno.gov/transportation/fax-ada-transition-plan/#carts-and-cargo-policy\n\nNOTICE TO RIDERS WHO HAVE MEDICARE CARDS – Riders who possess a Medicare Card and proper identiﬁcation are eligible for a 50¢ one-way fare at all times.\n\nACCESSIBILITY – All FAX buses have entry ramps for easy access to passengers who use wheelchairs or other mobility devices, or have difficulty climbing steps. Walkers/Rollators (4-wheeled walkers with seats) must be folded and placed in the aisles. Walker and Rollator users must always sit in a regular bus seat. Walkers and Rollators cannot be used as a seat while riding the bus and may not be secured in the wheelchair securement area.\n\nHANDY RIDE – Handy Ride is a FAX service designed to transport eligible persons with disabilities. The service is available to those persons who, because of the nature of their disability, are unable to use the FAX ﬁxed-route system. Handy Ride is a curb-to-curb service provided from any origin to any destination within the service area, for any trip purpose. It is a shared-ride service, which means you may share your ride with other riders. You must be at the curb at your designated pick-up time.\n\nEligible persons can schedule a trip reservation by calling Handy Ride at (559) 621-5770. When calling in, please state your name ﬁrst. Reservation staff will then ask a series of questions regarding desired pick-up time, pick-up location, destination, etc., to schedule the requested trip. Persons who are ADA Handy Ride Certiﬁed may make reservations one to two days before the desired trip. If illness or a change in plans causes you to cancel a trip, please inform Handy Ride at least one hour before your scheduled pick-up time.\n\nFor complete information regarding Handy Ride eligibility and service, contact FAX at (559) 621-RIDE (7433) or visit the Handy Ride web page\n\nTITLE VI – Fresno Area Express is committed to ensuring that no individual or organization is excluded from participation in, denied the beneﬁts of its programs, activities or services, or subject to discrimination based on race, color, or national origin as afforded to them by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended.
