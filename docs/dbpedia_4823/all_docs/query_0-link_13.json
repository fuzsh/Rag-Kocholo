Hour is short period of time, when you are playing computer games, drinking alcohol or \"chating\" with very very person. The hour of a dinner flows very fast. In some countries an academic hour exists, which contains 45 minutes. It is learning period of time.\n\nUsually an hour is equal to a twenty-fourth part of a day and night. The period has 60 minutes or 60 * 60 seconds. Trying very much, you can remember main events of each hour. But after one week you will not remember each hour. Maybe your memory is very good. Then it is OK. Person can travel about 5 kilometers (3.5) miles per hour. Sometimes hour can be measured by length or even weight. For some people the hour is 3 bottles of beer. 3 hours are 6 bottles of beer and not remembered hours are 9 bottles of beer.\n\nMany things can happen per hour. So what is an hour for you? Is it short or long for you?\n\nGuest: 2018-10-05 05:23:30 I feel sorry for people that make it past 3999 because January 1st is going to really suck you as your continuing down the hours 8 lit minutes away is the sun is going super nova but don't worry though it won't hurt you won't feel a thing it will be to hot for that any way all yoll see is a flash of weight and nothing but if some how your parents knew this was coming and sent you to space the rocket flew at the speed of light and made it past plout and you where safe and sound with your gf and now you just have to do now is find a habitat planit and fornicate/ repadose and lev or stay on the planet and repeat the process over and until you have 2 or more kids on or off the rockit you tell them the same thing your parents told you and they go on and repeat the process over and over untill whole solar system is or was your legacy that if you're reading this.CBD: 2020-01-03 04:55:24 So I have a question. How many days in 12 months? Can I complete 375 hours at the minimum amount of hours per day?? So I looked it up, and 375 hours is 15 days and 15 hours. I have 12 months to complete this project at 375 hours. So my question is about a busy schedule, what is the realistic time I can complete 375 hours in 12 months. 2 hours a day, or 3 hours a day? More or less? What's the ideal amount of days to do per week without it being every single day? I'm asking all of this because I'm a stay-at-home mom, and I have a toddler that's very hyper, but I also want to get involved in something that requires to be complete with that many hours by 12 months. I know this may be a hard question, but I'm hoping somebody can give advice LOL I haven't gotten involved in it yet, but I'm starting to wonder if it will be even worth it because of being a busy person. Grrr!!Guest90192: 2020-03-20 02:20:02 i sleep 8:00 to 6:30 i catch the bus at 7:36 i have school 8:45 to 3:20\n\ni catch the bus at 3:57\n\non Wednesday i wake up at 7:30 because i start school at 9:30 i catch the bus in the morning at 8:07 and i do homework in the weekends for about two hours.\n\ni play with my neighbours sometimes for about couple hours\n\nthen if my older brother not at home i cook dinner at 6:30. so yeah i think my life is pretty fun tbh im not telling you guys what happens in the weekend because i go on my laptop way too much during the weekend and thats all. plz dont hate this comment by saying my life is boring im just 13 started high school from Guest90192"
