YOU AND BRIGHTLINE AGREE TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT OR BEFORE A JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS ACCESS TO DISCOVERY, ALSO MAY BE UNAVAILABLE OR LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.\n\nWE BOTH AGREE TO ARBITRATE.\n\nYou hereby agree that any dispute between you and Brightline and its agents, employees, ofﬁcers, directors, principals, successors, assigns, parents, subsidiaries or afﬁliates (collectively for purposes of this section, “Brightline”) arising from or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and Brightline (collectively, \"Covered Disputes\") will be resolved by binding arbitration or in small claims court. You and Brightline each also agrees that the Agreement and the enforceability of this dispute resolution provision is governed by the laws of the State of Florida.\n\nWHAT IS ARBITRATION: Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more quickly. Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity, but court review of an arbitration award is limited.\n\nPRE-ARBITRATION PROCEDURES. Prior to initiating any arbitration, you must ﬁrst give us an opportunity to resolve your claim by sending an individual written description that describes in detail the individual damages that you claim to have suffered by e-mail to hello@gobrightline.com with “Legal Dispute” appearing in the subject line. We agree to endeavor to settle amicably by mutual, good faith discussions any Covered Disputes. If we are unable to resolve your claim within 60 days despite those mutual discussions, then either you or we may start arbitration or small claims court proceedings. A court, not an arbitrator, will decide whether this condition precedent has been satisﬁed.\n\nARBITRATION PROCEDURES. To begin arbitration, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to hello@gobrightline.com with “Legal Dispute” appearing in the subject line and to the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The arbitration of all disputes will be administered by the AAA under its Consumer Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is commenced, except to the extent any of those rules conﬂicts with our agreement in these Terms, in which case these Terms will govern. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org. If the claims asserted in any request or demand for arbitration could have been brought in small claims court, then either you or Brightline may elect to have the claims heard in small claims court, rather than in arbitration, at any time before the arbitrator is appointed, by notifying the other party of that election in writing. Upon ﬁling of the arbitration demand, Brightline will pay or reimburse all ﬁling, administration, and arbitrator fees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any claim asserted in an arbitration demand is deemed to be frivolous, the defending party shall be entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees and any ﬁling, administration, and arbitrator fees incurred.\n\nNO CLASS ACTIONS. Brightline and you agree that any Covered Dispute will be submitted to arbitration on an individual basis only. Neither Brightline nor you are entitled to arbitrate any Covered Dispute as a class, representative or private attorney action and the arbitrator(s) will have no authority to proceed on a class, representative or private attorney general basis. If a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that any part of this class action waiver is unenforceable with respect to any claim, the arbitration agreement and class action waiver will not apply to that claim, but they will still apply to any and all other claims that you or we may assert in that or any other action.\n\nWAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. If a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, YOU AND Brightline EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.\n\nIn any circumstances where the Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes permits the parties to litigate in court, then such dispute between us arising under the Terms or your misuse of the Brightline Online Services will be subject to the jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Miami, FL."
