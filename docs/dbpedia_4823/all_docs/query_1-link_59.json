Dollar accepts prepaid gift cards (American Express, MasterCard and Visa) as a form of payment at the time of the rental return – not to reserve a rental. Note: Dollar does not issue prepaid gift cards. Additionally, we will never ask you for the prepaid card details over the phone as these cards are ONLY accepted at time of return.\n\nFraudulent warning signs for prepaid gift cards:\n\nThese scams often target customers who are searching the internet for a phone number to call and book or modify rentals. If customers call fraudulent phone numbers, they will likely be asked to pay for gift cards in order to take advantage of limited-time offers. Most of these scams involve asking customers to purchase prepaid gift cards and use them to pay for rentals by phone. However, please note that other scams may exist.\n\nPlease report any potentially fraudulent phone numbers and incidents to your local police, or file a complaint online with the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) at www.ic3.gov .\n\nRental Rates\n\nDaily Rental rates are based on a 24-hour rental day starting at the time of rental. The minimum charge is one day, plus mileage, if applicable. In the event the renter keeps the vehicle past the rented date, the renter will be charged each hour and/or any part of an hour in excess of the rental date until the vehicle is returned, up to the applicable daily rate. Mileage charges, if applicable, will be the number of miles driven as determined by the odometer readings at the beginning and end of the rental. The Rental Rate is subject to increase if the vehicle is returned more than 24 hours before or 24 hours after the scheduled return time. Late returns beyond our 30-minute grace period may be subject to extra hour and/or extra day charges, in addition to any other rental charges. If the renter fails to comply with the conditions applicable to the rate, including any geographic driving restrictions, a mileage charge, surcharge or other rates may apply.\n\nDriving Age\n\nThe minimum age to rent a vehicle at most locations in the United States and Canada is 20 years of age. In Michigan, New York, and the province of Quebec, the minimum age for most vehicles is 18. Please refer to the Local Policies for specific information on driver ages at the location where you intend to rent and the applicable charge for drivers 20 to 24 years of age.\n\nFor more information on our young renters program visit: Car Rental for 20-24 year old.\n\nAuthorized Drivers\n\nThe DOLLAR vehicle may be driven only by an authorized driver.

If the renter chooses the prepaid fuel option, the renter will pay a specified charge as set forth in the rental agreement and have no obligation to return the vehicle with a full tank of fuel. The fuel charge is based on the estimated number of gallons needed to refill the tank multiplied by the rate per gallon charge specified in the rental agreement. DOLLAR may use different methods of estimating the number of gallons needed to refill the tank and these methods of estimation necessarily rely on human judgment. Most DOLLAR locations estimate the number of gallons needed to refill the gas tank either (1) by reading the fuel gauge to estimate the approximate amount of fuel needed to refill the tank (for example, one-half tank) and multiplying that number by the manufacturer's specified fuel tank capacity, or (2) if the renter did not purchase any fuel during the rental, by reading the odometer to determine the amount of miles driven during the rental and dividing that number by the vehicle's estimated average fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) based on the manufacturer's fuel efficiency specifications. References herein to miles and gallons shall be kilometers and liters when renting in Canada.\n\nVisit our Fuel Options page for more information.\n\nGeographic Limitations\n\nAt most locations, driving is restricted to the continental United States and Canada. A Canadian resident is prohibited from driving a U.S. owned vehicle into Canada. Please refer to the Local Policies for specific information regarding geographic limitations at the location where you intend to rent a DOLLAR vehicle. If you have already made a DOLLAR reservation the policies can be found under the 'View, Modify, or Cancel a Reservation' section on our site. Local Policy can also be found in our email confirmation. If you have not made a reservation please refer to the Local Policies, also found within the booking process, for specific information regarding your rental.\n\nDisabled Renters\n\nAvailable Driving Aids: If the renter will require driving aids to operate a vehicle, please contact us at 1-800-800-3665. This will ensure availability of equipment and allow DOLLAR personnel to install such equipment prior to the rental.\n\nPick-up: We would also ask that you call 1-800-800-3665 prior to your arrival so that we may pick you and your traveling companion up, if any, upon arrival at the airport. At most locations, courtesy telephones are also available in the airport to contact us for pick-up.\n\nAdditional Authorized Drivers: If a traveling companion shall serve as the driver during the rental, please advise the DOLLAR representative at the time of rental and pick-up. There is no additional charge for an additional authorized driver for non-driving disabled renters.\n\nVisit our Customers with Disabilities page to learn more about our driving aids.\n\nDriver's Licenses\n\nUnited States Citizens and U.S. Military Personnel: A renter or any additional authorized driver who is a citizen of the United States, must present at the time of rental:\n\n(1) a driver’s license issued by any state, territory or possession of the United States , and valid for the entire rental period.\n\n(2) a temporary driver’s license, valid for the entire rental period.\n\n(3) a traffic citation issued as a temporary license, valid for the entire rental period (the court date being the expiration date) and a second form of identification with signature (excluding the credit card used for rental).\n\n(4) a valid U.S. military identification card plus an expired driver's license for active duty U.S. military personnel in those states where active duty U.S. military can drive on an expired driver's license.\n\n(5) a valid driver’s license issued by a province or territory of Canada.\n\n(6) A mobile or digital driver’s license does not replace a valid physical driver’s license and Dollar customers will still need to supply their hard copy license until further notice.\n\n(7) a foreign driver’s license* issued by the country of residence of the renter and additional drivers. If the driver’s license is not in English the renter and drivers may provide a current International Driver’s Permit (“IDP”); or, if from Japan, a Japanese Translation Service. An IDP does not give a person the right to drive, but provides a certified translation of the valid foreign driver’s license. An IDP (or certified translation) without the foreign issued driver’s license is not acceptable.\n\n*If the foreign issued driver’s license is from a country where “permanent” or “non-expiring” driver’s license are issued, the renter and any additional drivers will also be required to show their passport, visa, and/or other current U.S. issued documentation at the beginning of their rental authorizing the renter or driver to be present in the USA at the time of rental. The name on the passport must match the name displayed on the driver’s license.\n\nOne-way Rentals\n\nOne-way rentals within the U.S. and within Canada vary by DOLLAR location and vehicle availability.

This service provides you with lock-out, flat tire, and fuel and battery service during your rental. To learn more about our Premium Emergency Roadside Service click here.\n\nPlatePass All-Inclusive Service: Many roads throughout the United States are “all-electronic,” which means that there is not an option to pay for tolls with cash or credit/debit cards when utilizing these toll roads.As a convenience, Thrifty offers its customers an all-inclusive tolling product - PlatePass® - which is an optional product to pay a daily fee for all electronic tolls that the customer encounters during his/her rental.(Prices vary by state) If a customer declines the PlatePass® All Inclusive option, Thrifty will charge the customer a $9.99 usage day fee for each day the customer each toll incurred plus the cash/highest undiscounted price for each electronic toll incurred, unless the customer makes some other arrangement to directly pay for the electronic tolls he/she incurs. These toll-related charges can be avoided by staying off toll roads, using a personal transponder – where permitted – or by making direct-pay arrangements with the toll authority – where allowed click here.\n\n“NOTE: If you decline the optional PlatePass All-Inclusive service at the commencement of the rental period, but still use electronic toll roads and/or bridges during the rental period (including “cashless” or “all electronic” toll roads and bridges, as noted above), you will be liable for and we will charge you: (a) all tolls incurred for such use (at the highest, undiscounted applicable toll rate); (b) a $15.00 administrative fee (FL - $9.99 per occurrence) for each toll incurred (subject to a $90.00 cap for such toll-related administrative fees for the rental period); and (c) all other applicable toll charges or fees, if any.”\n\nTo learn more about PlatePass, click here.\n\nAdditional Fees\n\nAt most DOLLAR locations the renter may incur one or more charges and fees, including, but not limited to the following: (i) an (airport)concession recovery fee or off-airport access fee; (ii) an (airport) consolidated facility charge; plus, frequent flyer surcharges, and vehicle license fees which are the estimated average per day per vehicle portion of our total annual vehicle taxes, licensing, titling, and registration costs, and other governmental fees or charges on top of the daily rate and any optional products and services the renter selects. These charges are calculated either as a per-day or a per-rental charge.\n\nChange Fees - In order to ensure that your car is ready and waiting for you, Dollar has introduced Change Fees that will reduce last-minute disruptions to our vehicle planning.\n\nEarly Return Fee: Applies if you did not prepay your rental charges and returned the vehicle more than 24 hours early before the return time indicated in your rental agreement. You will only pay for the days used, but there will be a $25 charge to partially compensate Dollar for our inability to rent your vehicle during the remaining time reserved for your use. You can reduce the fee paid by calling the On-Rent Help Desk at 1-866-434-2226 to update the date and time of your return.\n\nLate Return Fee: In addition to charging additional rental days for a late return, we reserve the right to charge $16 per day (maximum of 5 days) to compensate us in part for the costs we incur in finding an alternative vehicle to satisfy our next booking for your vehicle. You can reduce the fee paid by calling the On-Rent Help Desk at 1-866-434-2226 to update the date and time of your return.\n\nReturn Change Fee: Applies if you change the location or date/time of your rental and proactively notify Dollar by calling the On-Rent Help Desk at 1-866-434-2226.
