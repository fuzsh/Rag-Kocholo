        "text": "The cost of energy consumption\n\nEskom charges us for the electrical energy we use in our homes. Eskom charges us based on our energy consumption. The more electrical energy we use to run our household electrical appliances, the more Eskom charges us.\n\nHow do we work out how much energy we use? Think for example of using a 1000 W microwave to warm your food for 1 minute. How much energy is transferred? We can rearrange the following equation:\n\npower = energy/time\n\nSo that we have:\n\nenergy = power × time\n\nIn this formula, energy is measured in joules, time is measured in seconds and power in watts.\n\nTherefore to calculate the energy consumption of using a 1000 W microwave, we can calculate it as follows:\n\nenergy = power × time\n\n= 1000 W × 60 s\n\n= 60 000 J\n\nEskom now wants to work out our energy consumption for the whole month for all the appliances in your home. If 60 000 J of energy were used to warm food for 1 minute, then you can see that we would calculate an extremely large number for our energy consumption for the whole month in joules. This is not practical for electricity bills. We therefore have an alternative unit for energy consumption.\n\nThe quantity used for energy consumption is the kilowatt-hour (kWh). 1 kWh is the energy used if a 1000 W appliance is used for 1 hour.\n\n1 kWh is equal to 3 600 000 joules.\n\nThe kilowatt-hour is a measure of energy consumption as it is calculated by multiplying power in kilowatts by time in hours.\n\nWe can calculate the energy consumption of different appliances by multiplying the power rating by the amount of time it was used in hours.\n\nWe are charged for the number of kilowatt-hours that we use. The cost of energy consumption is charged in cents per kilowatt-hour (c/kWh). The following table gives us the rates at which homeowners are charged for purchasing their power directly from Eskom. As you can see, there are different 'blocks'. The more energy you use per month, the more you pay per kilowatt-hour. This is called a tiered tariff system.\n\nEskom Homepower Tariffs 2013\n\nDifferent energy consumptions per month\n\nEnergy charge (c/kWh)\n\nEnvironmental levy charge (c/kWh)l\n\nTotal\n\n(c/kWh)\n\nBlock 1 [≤ 50 kWh]\n\n67.07\n\n2.28\n\n69.35\n\nBlock 2 [51 - 350 kWh]\n\n83.32\n\n2.28\n\n85.60\n\nBlock 3 [351 - 600 kWh]\n\n124.74\n\n2.28\n\n127.02\n\nBlock 4 [> 600 kWh]\n\n137.03\n\n2.28\n\n139.31\n\nThe tiered tariff system is used to encourage people to save electricity and use it wisely as the less you use, the less you pay per unit of electricity.\n\nIn order to calculate your electricity costs, choose the block that applies to your home. For example, if your home uses 252 kWh of electricity in a month then you fall into Block 2.\n\nWhat if you do not want to work out your entire bill, just how much one particular appliance is costing you? The average per unit price of electricity in 2013 is 71,65 c/kWh. This is the per unit price we will use for our calculations.\n\nThe unit price of electricity varies with consumption. The price indicated here was as it was in 2013 for a particular usage. You can also use other rates in your calculations with your class and specify them upfront.\n\nThe actual cost per unit depends on whether or not you buy your electricity directly from Eskom or from your local municipality. In fact, the tariff differs from municipality to municipality as well.\n\nIf we want to know how much we will pay for using a particular appliance we would use the following calculation:\n\ncost = power rating of appliance × number of hours it was used for × unit price of electricity\n\nRemember that we can find the power rating for an appliance on the labels. Did you notice that both of the labels indicated power in watts (W) and not kilowatts (kW)? That means that if you use them to calculate the cost of electricity you must first convert them to kilowatts.\n\nLet's try an example calculation for the microwave.\n\nLets's try another example.\n\nHave you ever notice your fridge start humming after a period of silence? Fridges are extremely energy-expensive electrical appliances. To keep the temperature at a constant cool temperature, fridges contain a thermostat that measure how cool the air is inside your fridge. When the temperature inside the fridge warms beyond a certain point the thermostat will switch on the energy-expensive compressor and condenser. Fridges are specially insulated so try keep cool air inside, and the energy demands of a fridge varies greatly depending on how often the doors are opened, and what is kept inside.\n\nImagine now, that you left the fridge door open by accident as you rushed to school and didn't notice until the next day! We now want to work out how much it costs to run a fridge with a power rating of 2200 W for a day.\n\nWe can see that different appliances have different power ratings and so require more electricity to run. This means that some appliances are more expensive to run than others. An incandescent light bulb, for example, is more expensive to use than a fluorescent light bulb. If you remember, an incandescent light bulb loses most of its energy as heat, instead of light.\n\nDo you know how much electricity your family consumes? Let's find out.\n\nThere are many different ways in which we can try to conserve electricity in order to save money. Our choice of light bulbs can affect our electricity bills. LED light bulbs are the most energy efficient. They have lower power ratings than normal light bulbs but most of their energy is transferred as light and very little as heat (unlike incandescent light bulbs). Light transmitted from the bulb is measured in lumens.\n\nUsing light bulbs which use less electricity can have a knock-on effect. If everyone is using less electricity, then there is less demand for electricity to be produced in our coal-powered power stations in South Africa. If less electricity is produced then fewer fossil fuels are burnt and this would lead to a reduction in the production of excess greenhouse gases.\n\nThere are many important and rewarding careers in the electrical energy sector. Let's take some time to research some of them.\n\nConcept map\n\nUse the following page to design your own concept map to summarise this chapter on the cost of electrical energy."
