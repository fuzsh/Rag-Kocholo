        "text": "Théophile Gautier’s Selected Lyrics in Norman R. Shapiro’s translation is a book from 2011 that I did not read until recently. I was waiting for the hype to die down.\n\nWell, there should have been some hype. Among the lyrics Shapiro “selected” is the entirety of Gautier’s 1852 Enamels and Cameos, one of the great books of French poetry of the 19th century, and what a century for French poetry. A previous translation, from 1903, existed, but it is so bad that when I wroteabout Gautier five years ago I resorted to my own translations. What desperation!\n\nShapiro’s might as well be, then, the only translation. I doubt there will be another in the next 108 years, so this is it.\n\nEnamels and Cameos has a funny place in English literature. In The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890), Dorian picks the book up just after he has committed a murder. He is disquieted by a poem about a murderer’s severed hand (“Study in Hands”), then comforted when he turns the page to “Variations on the Carnival of Venice”. Some of the lines about Venice are included in Wilde’s novel, in French, of course, making Gautier perhaps the French poet most read by English-language readers, if I take “read” to mean “grumblingly skipped.”\n\nAs the title suggests, Gautier’s poems are little, hand-crafted objects with little portraits carved on them, deliberately small and even trivial, beautiful rather than sublime. They are perhaps partly a response to Victor Hugo’s poems, small Romanticism set beside his big, ambitious stuff. They are also a reaction to the chaos of 1848, as he suggests in the opening lines:\n\nGoethe wrote West’s Divan as men\n\nWaged war to cannons’ blare and boom:\n\nA cool oasis in the gloom,\n\nWhere stifled art might breathe again. (“Preface”)\n\nYou can see here what Shapiro does throughout the book. He keeps the rhymes in their place, no matter what he has to break to do it; he keeps the quatrains; he mimics Gautier’s eight syllable lines with quadrameters. This pretty well takes care of the whole book (although the above poem is actually a sonnet).\n\nThe subjects of the poems vary as in any collection of miniatures. Seasons, sculptures, women, their breasts, Christmas, the sea, “The Little Dead Girl’s Toys”:\n\nOn carpet and on table, there\n\nLies childhood wealth to others left:\n\nPoor puppet, with his doleful air,\n\nArms dangling, sprawling, strength bereft.\n\nOr the inexplicable “Symphony in White Major”:\n\nWas it the milk-white drops astride\n\nThe winter sky’s azure blue dome?\n\nSilver-pulped lily? Or the tide\n\nRolling beneath a froth-white foam?\n\nWhite marble? Cold, pale flesh, wherein\n\nDwell the divinities of White?\n\nSilver unburnished? Opaline\n\nGlimmers flecked with brief bursts of light?"
