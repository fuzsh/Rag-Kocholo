        "text": "Gautier, Judith\n\nEntry updated 12 September 2022. Tagged: Author.\n\nWorking name of French poet and author Louise Charlotte Ernestine Gautier (1845-1917), daughter of Théophile Gautier, and deeply influenced in her long-standing and intense use of Oriental venues and themes by Pierre Loti (1850-1923). Her stories cannot be thought of easily as sf, but the elaborate and engaging use of myth and traditional motif makes it possible to think of her as a significant figure in the evolution of French Fantastika as a whole. After Isoline (1882 chap), collections of interest include Isoline et La Fleur-Serpent (coll 1882), which incorporates the earlier tale, and Le Paravant de soie et d'or [\"The Silk and Golden Screen\"] (coll 1904), with seven stories from the latter volume plus the whole of Isoline et La Fleur-Serpent trans Brian Stableford as Isoline and the Serpent-Flower (omni 2013); further volumes include Fleurs d'Orient [\"Flowers of the Orient\"] (coll 1893) and Les parfums de la pagode [\"Perfumes of the Pagoda\"] (coll 1919). The Orient she created, full of chthonic echoes whose supernatural burden seems descriptive rather than simply Romantic, became a model for some later writers, though Ernest Bramah's Kai Lung stories fatally (for some) gentrified the fruitful darkness of her best work.
