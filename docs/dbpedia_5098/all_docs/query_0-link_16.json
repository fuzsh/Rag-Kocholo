        "text": "The Flowers of Evil by Charles Baudelaire (1857)\n\nCurrently the most revered and studied collection of French lyric poetry, Les Fleurs du Mal [The Flowers of Evil] by Charles Baudelaire (1821-67) was the subject of one of the most famous literary trials in France. On August 20, 1857, a few weeks after publication of the collection by Poulet-Malassis, six poems from Les Fleurs du Mal were indicted by the Tribunal correctionnel [criminal court] of the Seine for affront to public decency (“outrage à la morale publique”) because of their alleged “crude realism”: “Les Bijoux” [The Jewels], “Le Léthé”, “Femmes damnées” [Damned Women], “Les Métamorphoses d’un vampire,” “À celle qui est trop gaie” [To a Woman too Gay], and “Lesbos” (the last two reproduced here with translations by Samuel N. Rosenberg). These erotic, sometimes lesbian poems were then excluded from all regular editions of Les Fleurs du Mal until the rehabilitation of Baudelaire and his collection by the Cour de cassation [court of appeals] in 1949. The condemned poems nevertheless continued to be widely circulated through clandestine and often illustrated editions, including Le Parnasse satyrique (1864), Les Épaves [The Wrecks] with a frontispiece by Félicien Rops (1866), Les Pièces condamnées [Condemned Pieces] with woodcuts by Jean Gabriel Daragnès (1917), all exhibited here.\n\nLinks:\n\nFirst edition of Les Fleurs du Mal\n\nDocuments on the trial of Les Fleurs du Mal\n\nLesbos\n\nMère des jeux latins et des voluptés grecques,\n\nLesbos, où les baisers languissants ou joyeux,\n\nChauds comme les soleils, frais comme les pastèques,\n\nFont l’ornement des nuits et des jours glorieux,\n\n— Mère des jeux latins et des voluptés grecques,\n\n[...]\n\nMother of games and of pleasures, Latin and Greek,\n\nLesbos, where kisses of leisure, languor or joy,\n\nWarm as summer suns and cool as fresh melons,\n\nOrnament now all our nights and glorious days,\n\nMother of games and of pleasures, Latin and Greek,\n\n[...]\n\nFull poem translated by Samuel N. Rosenberg\n\nÀ celle qui est trop gaie\n\nTa tête, ton geste, ton air\n\nSont beaux comme un beau paysage ;\n\nLe rire joue en ton visage\n\nComme un vent frais dans un ciel clair.\n\n[...]\n\nTo a woman too gay\n\nThe way you look and move and breathe\n\nHas all the beauty of a beautiful landscape;\n\nThere's smiling at play across your face—\n\nA cool fresh breeze in a sky that's bright.\n\n[...]\n\nFull poem translated by Samuel N. Rosenberg\n\nLe Parnasse satyrique / The Satyrical Parnassus (1864-81)\n\nLe Parnasse satyrique du dix-neuvième siècle is an impressive anthology in two volumes, followed by the Nouveau Parnasse satyrique, of licentious French poetry by Victor Hugo, Alfred de Musset, Théophile Gautier, Charles Baudelaire, Albert Glatigny, Stéphane Mallarmé, among many other poets, on the model of the seventeenth-century Parnasse satyrique attributed to Théophile de Viau, as well as the eighteenth-century Parnasse libertin, also exhibited here. The anthology was clandestinely edited by the publisher Auguste Poulet-Malassis during his exile in Belgium in 1864, probably with the complicity of Baudelaire and other poets. Several copies of the anthology were seized by French customs when Poulet-Malassis tried to smuggle them into Paris, and the publisher was sentenced in absentia by a French court on June 2, 1865. The Parnasse satyrique was the first edition in which the six condemned poems of Baudelaire’s Fleurs du Mal were reprinted, and the second volume includes a facsimile of Baudelaire’s autograph dedication of his collection of verse to Gautier. Many reprints and new editions of the anthology were circulating in the late nineteenth century, including the expanded edition exhibited here, clandestinely printed by the Belgian publisher Henry Kistemaeckers in 1881, before it became almost forgotten in the twentieth century. Les Jeunes-France, the 1833 collection of novellas by Théophile Gautier, has little to do with the licentious anthology, but the frontispiece created by Félicien Rops for the reissue of the novel in 1866 may be considered an illustration of the Parnasse satyriques, to the extent that it represents several Romantic poets featured in the anthology, including Hugo, Musset, Gautier, and Baudelaire, gathered around a naked and lascivious muse.\n\nLinks:\n\nFirst edition of the Parnasse satyrique\n\nFull text of the Nouveau Parnasse satyrique\n\nLe Godemichet de la gloire par Théophile Gautier\n\nUn vit, sur la place Vendôme,\n\nGamahuché par l’aquilon,\n\nDécalotte son large dôme,\n\nAyant pour gland Napoléon.\n\nVeuve de son fouteur, la Gloire,\n\nLa nuit, dans son con souverain,\n\nEnfonce — tirage illusoire ! —\n\nCe grand godemichet d’airain…\n\nThe Dildo of Glory\n\nA veritable shaft on the Place Vendôme,\n\nLapped and licked by the North wind alone,\n\nPulls its broad head away from the skin\n\nAnd Napoleon rises, no longer tucked in.\n\nGlory, now stripped of her iron-clad might,\n\nAt night, like a witless and cunningless knight,\n\nPenetrates far (yes, it's tricky, alas!)\n\nWith that dildo of hers, that dildo of brass.\n\nTranslated by Samuel N. Rosenberg\n\nLes Amies by Paul Verlaine (1868)\n\nThe collection of six Sapphic sonnets Les Amies [Girlfriends], composed by Paul Verlaine (1844-1896) under the pseudonym Pablo de Herlagnez, was clandestinely printed in Brussels by Poulet-Malassis in December 1867. Several copies of the booklet were seized by French customs while the publisher was trying to smuggle them into Paris at the beginning of 1868, and the Tribunal Correctionnel (Criminal Court) of Lille ordered the destruction of the collection, on May 6, 1868, for affront to religion and public decency (see the September 19 issue of Le Moniteur universel. Journal official de l’Empire français). The collection Les Amies was anonymously illustrated and reissued by the artist and art publisher Jean Gabriel Daragnès (1886-1950) in 1919. The poem “Sappho,” exhibited here and translated by Samuel N. Rosenberg, has the particularity of being an inverted sonnet, that is, a pseudo-sonnet, exclusively composed of feminine rhymes like the other sonnets of the volume, in which the order of the quatrains and the tercets is reversed, to underline the lesbian theme of the collection.\n\nLink first edition\n\nSappho\n\nFurious, hollow-eyed and stiff-nippled,\n\nSappho, impelled by exhausting desire,\n\nRuns like a wolf along frozen stretches of shore.\n\nDreaming of Phaon, casting Rite now aside,\n\nAnd seeing her tears unavailing,\n\nShe tears out her hair in measureless handfuls.\n\nThen she recalls, with no soothing regret,\n\nDays when the pure youthful glory of love\n\nShone in verses she sang and that memory\n\nNow in the soul will recite to virgins asleep.\n\nNow she shuts livid-lidded eyes tight\n\nAnd leaps, summoning Fate, into the sea;\n\nOverhead there appears, torching the darkness,\n\nSelene, blue-pale, avenger of Lovers.\n\nTranslated by Samuel N. Rosenberg\n\nFemmes, Chair, and Hombres by Paul Verlaine (1890-1903)\n\nIn the last years of his life, Paul Verlaine (1844-96) mainly composed erotic poems, some of which mildly sensual, like those included in the posthumous collection Chair [Flesh], illustrated with a frontispiece by Félicien Rops, others downright obscene, like those included in the pornographic (in the etymological sense of pornography: writing about prostitutes) collection Femmes [Women] and the homoerotic collection Hombres [Men], clandestinely printed, the former in 1890 and the latter in 1904. Hombres ends with a sonnet composed in collaboration with Arthur Rimbaud (1854-91) in 1872, Le Sonnet du trou du cul [Sonnet on the asshole], translated here by Samuel N. Rosenberg. According to Verlaine, he himself composed the quatrains (Verlaine fecit) and his younger lover composed the tercets (Rimbaud invenit).\n\nLe Sonnet du trou du cul par Paul Verlaine et Arthur Rimbaud\n\nObscur et froncé comme un œillet violet\n\nIl respire, humblement tapi parmi la mousse\n\nHumide encor d’amour qui suit la fuite douce\n\nDes fesses blanches jusqu’au bord de son ourlet.\n\nDes filaments pareils à des larmes de lait\n\nOnt pleuré, sous l’auteur cruel qui les repousse,\n\nA travers de petits caillots de marne rousse,\n\nPour s’en aller où la pente les appelait.\n\nMa bouche s’accouple souvent à sa ventouse\n\nMon âme, du coït matériel jalouse,\n\nEn fit son larmier fauve et son nid de sanglots\n\nC’est l’olive pâmée et la flûte câline\n\nC’est le tube où descend la céleste praline\n\nChanaan féminin dans les moiteurs éclos.\n\nSonnet on the asshole\n\nDark and puckered like a purple carnation,\n\nIt breathes, humbly nestled in a setting of moss,\n\nStill damp with a love that gently descends\n\nThe cheeks of white that slope right to its rim.\n\nThreads that look like strings of milky tears\n\nWept, under a blast of cruel opposing wind,\n\nPast what tiny clots of earthy rust were there\n\nTo drip then toward the slope’s ensuing stop.\n\nOften my mouth sought yours for our delight;\n\nMy soul, though, eager for the coupled thing,\n\nTore through the teary duct and the bed of sobs.\n\nIt’s the olive in a swoon, the flute in tight caress,\n\nIt’s the tube that’s lined with almond cream—\n\nA woman’s promised land with a passage all our own.\n\nTranslated by Samuel N. Rosenberg"
