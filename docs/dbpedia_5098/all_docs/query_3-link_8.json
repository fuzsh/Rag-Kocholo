        "text": "Théophile Gautier was a great traveller, visiting places as diverse as Spain, Italy, Russia, Egypt and Algeria, and his writing based on the various places he visited are works of art. He has a knack of transporting you to the place and making you live the experience he is living. His descriptions are not only vivid, they are touching and so very romantic; they transport you into his world and make you dream. For Gautier, how the story is told is of more importance than the story itself. Reading him really inspires one to want to emulate such beauty. Wonderful!\n\nPierre Jules Théophile Gautier was one of several classic French writers whose works I studied at university and fell in love with. He was born in 1811 in Tarbes, southwest France, but was raised in Paris. Author Victor Hugo is credited for influencing Gautier to explore literature; until he met Hugo, Gautier was exploring painting as a medium for expression. He became a well-respected critic of the arts: literature, art, theatre, dance, and he experimented with poetry, but mainly he wrote articles for journals such as La Presse.\n\nJust a snapshot of his poetry suffices to show Gautier’s mastery of language and his ability to create a vivid picture in your mind. The following two poems are translated from his collection of Romantic poetry Émaux et Camées (Enamels and Cameos). These, and others, are available at http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29521/29521-h/29521-h.htm.\n\nAs I read the first poem, I am swept away by the beauty of the words – each word conveys delight and adoration, the rhythm and rhyme is wonderful, and the choice of words is perfection itself: lure, pure, snowy kiss, fair as lily, whitest poem, reposing, velvet, delicately, undulating, beautiful, graceful, subtlesome, silken locks, gem-bright, gilded sceptre, soft, luxurious, passion, wondrous, free… and so on, and so on. The line that lingers in my mind is ‘Impossible dream-flutterings!’; so onomatopoeic in the translation (Rêves d’impossibilités in the original).\n\nBut then comes the second poem, and Gautier shows himself to be a master at creating mood, for he smashes through the romantic, soft, lovely mood created by his first poem from the very opening line: ‘Strange contrast was the severed hand’. Now, there is vivid vocabulary that creates mental images that disturb and chill: murderer dead, morbid, loathing, cold, hair-covered, slimy skin, deathly stain, yellow, uncanny, mummified, lured them to horrors, hideous hieroglyphs, grim, scorchings from every fiery hell, corruptions seethe and boil…\n\nThe juxtaposition of the two makes for powerful and evocative writing indeed.\n\nA STUDY OF HANDS"
