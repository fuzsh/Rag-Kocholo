        "meta_description": "This introduction presents an overview of the key concepts discussed in the subsequent chapters of this book. The book traces Algernon Charles Swinburne's responses to Matthew Arnold, focusing in particular on the young Swinburne's challenge to the older critic who was held as the foremost English authority on French literature and cosmopolitan culture. It concentrates on Swinburne's poetry, in particular on his use of images of open-air swimming as a 'ubiquitous in nineteenth-century poetic meditations on democratic reform'. The book argues for the importance of Swinburne's prose writings in our understanding of his overall achievement. It shows that a close analysis of metre and poetic form leads to a radical rethinking of how sexuality is encoded and expressed in Swinburne's poems. The book looks at Swinburne in intellectual dialogue with two of the major poets of his age: Christina Rossetti and Robert Browning.",
