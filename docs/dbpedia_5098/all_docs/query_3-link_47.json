        "text": "A major influence on the Symbolist movement, French poet Paul Verlaine was born in Metz, France in 1844. Verlaine was also one of the models for the Decadent movement that began in the 1870s. His numerous poetry collections include Invectives (1896), Chair (1896), Confessions (1895), Femmes (1890), Les Poètes maudits (1884), Sagesse (1880), Romances sans paroles (1874), La Bonne Chanson (1870), and Poèmes saturniens (1866). Although he was known as “the Master” to his friends and admirers by the time of his death in 1896, Verlaine endured a rocky relationship with the public during his life. As much as for his literary reputation, his fame rests on his stormy personal relationship with the poet Arthur Rimbaud.\n\nVerlaine was the son of Nicolas Verlaine, a captain in the army, and Stéphanie Dehée, the daughter of a farmer from Arras. Nicolas Verlaine was cold and authoritarian by nature, but Stéphanie Dehée was devoted to her son, who was born 13 years into his parents’ marriage, after three successive miscarriages. After he resigned from the army in 1851, Nicolas Verlaine and his family moved to Paris with an orphaned cousin, Elisa Moncomble. Verlaine was enrolled at the Institution Landry. A tempestuous child, Verlaine’s extreme and irrepressible fits of anger foreshadowed his personality as an adult. In fact, Verlaine already possessed his own inner poetic voice. Emotionally unstable, he wrote about escaping from the world in his first poems: “Aigle, au rêveur hardi, pour l’enlever du sol, / Ouvre ton aile! / Eclair, emporte-moi!” (“Eagle, open your wing to the fearless dreamer, / And take him away! / Lightning, take me away!”).\n\nPosturing himself as a soul in search of the absolute, by his late teens Verlaine was already absorbed in his dreams and sensations, questioning the world and confronting it with a world of his own creation. A mediocre student whose only interest was writing poems, Verlaine was more often in the cafés of the Quartier Latin than at the lectures at the law school where he was enrolled. In 1863 he published “Monsieur Prudhomme,” his first sonnet. Worried about his son’s artistic pretensions, Nicolas Verlaine forced him to accept a job at the Hôtel de Ville (mayor’s office) in Paris. After work the young Verlaine would join the capital’s fashionable literary circles and meet various poets, including Théodore de Banville, with whom he discussed the latest poetic techniques. But beset by overwhelming and contradictory feelings of fear and hope, Verlaine was prey to despair. Only in poetry could he find temporary peace. In 1866 he published his first collection of poems, Poèmes saturniens (Saturnian Poems). The title was inspired by one of Charles Baudelaire’s verses at the beginning of Les Fleurs du mal (The Flowers of Evil, 1857). Most of the poems in the book were dedicated to Verlaine’s cousin Elisa Moncomble, whom the poet secretly loved.\n\nThe early work of a poet in search of himself, Poèmes saturniens was written during the author’s adolescence. Influenced by models including Banville and Victor Hugo, the young man imitated rather than created his own style. Though he admired Baudelaire’s detachment toward his work, Verlaine was fully involved in his own creations, sharing with Baudelaire an aspiration to a world of dreams. Love and sensuality are at the heart of Poèmes saturniens. Verlaine’s “rêvé familier” (familiar dream) is that of “une femme inconnue, et que j’aime, et qui m’aime” (a nameless woman, whom I love and who loves me); most probably his beloved cousin, who was far from being an “inconnue” (unknown). Published not long after Poèmes saturniens, Verlaine’s second collection, Fêtes galantes (Gallant Festivals, 1869), is dominated by the image of the moon. Ghostly characters dance in a spectral countryside; Harlequins and Columbines jump, turn, and waltz in melancholic parks, around majestic fountains, and “Sous les ramures chanteuses” (under fluttering boughs) in quest of a heavenly place which perpetually fades away. Verlaine evoked the techniques and paintings of 18th-century artists Antoine Watteau and Jean-Honoré Fragonard, and also drew upon Walter Pater, Hugo, Gérard de Nerval, Théophile Gautier, William Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream (1605), and the Italian commedia dell’arte. However, Fêtes galantes was a commercial failure. A few months later the poet met Mathilde Mauté and fell deeply in love. His next collection of poems, La bonne chanson (The Good Song, 1870), is dedicated to her. La bonne chanson offers a more direct form of expression, reflecting Verlaine’s attempt to regularize his life and achieve peace of mind—he had become aware of the realities of life and yearned for some sort of mental purification. Hastily written, most of the poems in the collection are similar to those the author sent to Mathilde after they had first met. Though the two married soon after they met, their relationship would soon be consumed in the storm of Verlaine’s feelings for the young poet Arthur Rimbaud.\n\nIn 1871 Verlaine met Rimbaud, who read him one of his poems, “Le Bateau ivre” (The Drunken Boat). Rimbaud had initially contacted Verlaine by letter, and Verlaine invited the young poet to stay with him and his wife’s family. The two men soon became inseparable. In the meantime, Verlaine’s marriage started to deteriorate. He beat and threatened Mathilde over her criticism of his behavior and of his friendship with Rimbaud, whom she abhorred. During this time Rimbaud’s extremely antisocial behavior and the apparent relationship between the two men became public knowledge. In October 1871 Mathilde gave birth to a son, Georges. A few months later, Verlaine and Rimbaud left for Belgium and eventually embarked for England. Left alone, Mathilde sought a divorce from Verlaine.\n\nVerlaine and Rimbaud spent the following three years traveling between London, Brussels, and Paris. In 1872 and 1873 multiple separations and reunions occurred between the lovers, and Verlaine was eventually sent to prison for two years after a violent argument with Rimbaud. Written during the poets’ escape to Belgium and then England, Romances sans paroles was published in March 1874. Verlaine received the first copies of his book in his prison cell. Just 21 poems in four sections, Romances sans had originally been dedicated to Rimbaud, but the dedication was subsequently dropped for being a provocation. The first section of nine poems, “Ariettes oubliées,” shows a change in Verlaine’s tone. The poet confides in the reader in an allusive and nostalgic, familiar manner. Under the influence of Rimbaud, Verlaine discovered how the power of words enables the poet “changer la vie” (to change life). The poems written while Verlaine and Rimbaud were in Belgium reveal the poets’ amorous adventures on the road. Hence, in “Walcourt,” Verlaine writes:\n\nBriques et tuiles,\n\nO les charmants\n\nPetits asiles\n\nPour les amants!\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nGares prochaines,\n\nGais chemins grands . . .\n\nQuelles aubaines,\n\nBons juifs-errants!\n\n(Bricks and tiles,\n\nOh, charming cover\n\nSnug asylums\n\nFor the lovers\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nStations near,\n\nGay roads to choose . . .\n\nWhat windfalls here,\n\nGood wandering Jews?)"
