No nineteenth-century French poem has had a more striking influence on English literature. Browning liked it so much he based both “A Toccata of Galuppi’s” and a segment of Fifine at the Fair on the ground plan of Gautier’s poem. And eighteen years later, in The Picture of Dorian Gray, Oscar Wilde quotes three and a half stanzas from “Variations”, and has Dorian remark, “How exquisite they were! […] The whole of Venice was in those […] lines.”\n\nItem Type: Article Uncontrolled Keywords: literature and literary theory ,/dk/atira/pure/subjectarea/asjc/1200/1208 Faculty \\ School: Faculty of Arts and Humanities > School of Politics, Philosophy, Language and Communication Studies UEA Research Groups: Faculty of Arts and Humanities > Research Groups > Philosophy Related URLs:\n\nhttp://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?...\n\nDepositing User: LivePure Connector Date Deposited: 09 May 2019 08:30 Last Modified: 07 Mar 2024 14:32 URI: https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/70874 DOI: 10.1093/litimag/imy067\n\nDownloads\n\nDownloads per month over past year\n\nActions (login required)"
