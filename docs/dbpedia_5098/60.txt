Théophile Gautier (1811–1872) was a French poet, dramatist, fiction writer, critic, and journalist. His verse is located between Romanticism and a host of other literary traditions, including Parnassianism and Modernism, and was admired by, among others, Honoré de Balzac, Gustave Flaubert, Ezra Pound, and T. S. Eliot. He is sometimes considered a hinge between Victor Hugo and Charles Baudelaire.
