The pair will be spinning ’90s music in a secret warehouse, with Kevin reportedly dropping the brand new remix of his track, 'All I Want to Do Is Do It', whilst Perry is organising the brunch day-to-night Ibiza rave. Mrs Patterson will be pouring bottomless cocktails from 1pm-2pm and superstar DJ Eye Ball Paul will be spinning on the night. Candice and Gemma will also be in attendance! No word yet on whether there will be any jam sandwiches.",
