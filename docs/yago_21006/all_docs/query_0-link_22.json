        "text": "A coming of age teen sex comedy, a feature length film based on comedy sketchs from harry enfield and kathy Burke. It's decent, made me laugh, has lots of gross out gags and harry Enfield and Kathy Burke are funny. Tye soundtrack is excellent ,full of club and house music. I thought it was cool that it was set in ibiza and was set in the world of djs and clubs. Not excellent but I laughed quite a bit.\n\nTo be blunt, this was quite a poorly made movie filled with crude and witless jokes. However, watched with friends, Kevin & Perry Go Large is actually a fair amount of brainless fun. The jokes, whilst repetitive, tend to generally land and I found myself chuckling along at the exaggerated teen antics central to the story. It's immature but the film-making is surprisingly solid with a strong, if predictable, setup. It may not be genius, but Kevin & Perry Go Large is dumb and fun is equal measure. I feel bad for liking it so much.\n\nAlso, I can't decide whether to commend or disparage the filmmakers for committing to so many erection jokes.\n\nICON. Netflix\n\n1.85:1\n\nColor\n\n35mm\n\n15\n\nA genre defining British film that has been replicated over and over again to death. Predictable down to every single point but the jokes still hit and still resonate in this culture today. Performances from Burke and Enfield are hilarious with both equally stealing the show with Ifans performance on fire as the evil yet hilarious DJ. It's just a shame it's not a little longer or that we received a sequel.\n\nAbout 6 months ago my then 12 year old started acting like a 13 year old. For 6 months we continually showed him the famous sketch of Harry Enfield's Kevin the Teenager turning 13 in a Jekyll and Hyde style transformation. After watching a few more sketches it backfired on us and all that's happened is that now models himself on Kevin. God help us!\n\nThe thing is Kevin is a great character...in a sketch! Stretched over 80 minutes then it becomes one erection gag, one humiliation, one plook too many unfortunately. Kathy Burke as Perry is funny and there are a few genuinely funny moments but it just doesn't work overall. Your enjoyment may vary here depending on your frame of mind when you sit down to it."
