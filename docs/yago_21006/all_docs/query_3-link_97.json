        "text": "Harry Enfield and Kathy Burke bring Kevin and Perry to the big screen, and despite my affection for the DVD something is definitely lost in the translation to the movie theatre version of these great characters.\n\nThe Kevin and Perry sketches were always the highlight of the TV show for me, i simply love the stereotypical characters, and the exaggerated, yet realistic situations that are portrayed. The short sketches do struggle to fill up the feature length with such hilarity and the characters obviously lack the depth to sustain the entertainment throughout.\n\nI did still enjoy the movie though, it managed to make me laugh enough and the story tried it's best to carry the duo through till the end, and it only missed by a bit. The real saving grace for me was in the DVD - Kevin's guide to being a teenager is a brilliant best of from the TV series, and it certainly makes up for the flaws in the movie.\n\n5.5/10 for the film 9/10 for the DVD extras 7/10 is my final vote\n\nGrowing up watching Harry Enfield and chums Kevin & Perry was always my favourite skit so loved it when heard they were doing a film and wasnt disappointed this isnt a brainer high end plot bust a joyful entertaining film that will put you in a good mood and is very rewatchable , so many great club classics beautiful scenery, having rewatched this lately cam honestly say this film has stood the test of time for me. So many of Kevin's thoughts and episodes you cam relate to its hilarious. Can't understand the low scores, other than maybe today's generation dont get it . Definetly give this film a go if you want a mood boost\n\nLoved this film when I first saw it upon first release and still love it now.. Great to watch with friends and allow yourself to be transported back to the golden age of clubbing.\n\nI think this movie struggles to be understood in many countries hence the average score, it helps if you're from the UK, are a certain age and have also seen the K&P series on the TV or at least understand what the gag is!\n\nWill definitely be giving this another watch not too long from now."
