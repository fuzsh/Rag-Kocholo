        "text": "It's the ultimate teenage nightmare. Not only are your parents going to thwart all your efforts at largin' it big time by joining you on your holiday to Ibiza, but they're going to have excruciatingly loud sex in the hotel room next to the one you share with your best friend. What's a would-be mixmaster DJ virgin to do? Kevin and Perry Go Large is an excuse to wallow vicariously in the misery of adolescence. Expanded from a series of sketches on Harry Enfield's Television Programme, it is the story of a grotty, self-deluding teen (Harry Enfield) and his hapless best (only) mate Perry (Kathy Burke) as they embark on a quest to lose their virginity and become superstar DJs into the bargain.\n\nFor any adult male it is a painfully accurate reminder of the nightmare of having balls that feel like they're about to explode, a face that is exploding on a daily basis, and parents who simply exist. For parents suffering the indignities of being told that their son is \"not your slave\" every time they ask him to pass the salt, it's at least a reassurance that they're not alone. There are gross-out, American-style gags about erections, spots and puke, and very British characters who think they're far cooler, smarter, and better-looking than they really are.\"Kevin came from me, really,\" says Harry Enfield who co-wrote and directed the film. \"I woke up at 14 or 15 and realised that I was a genius with an encyclopedic knowledge of punk music, but my parents were concerned with trivial matters, like whether I picked my socks up or not. They were just ludicrous ignoramuses compared to me, and I became a Jesus-like figure in my own head. They were my Romans, out to persecute me.\" Kevin indulges in similar delusions of grandeur. He imagines his own funeral, surrounded by hysterical relatives and beautiful girls who wished they had realised his genius before it was too late; and he fantasises about being Anne Boleyn's executioner, saving her at the last minute and being rewarded with a shag.\n\nUnlike most character comedians, who tend to keep their repertoire to half a dozen guises at the most, Enfield is known for doing such a broad spectrum of characters that it seems a strange choice to take one sketch and stretch it out into an hour and a half's worth of gags big enough to look good on 35mm. \"I've always thought that I wouldn't do a film with any of my characters because it would be an extended sketch. But I really like working with Kathy, and the acting relationship we have is so good, that I thought if anything could work, it would have to be with her. I got together with Dave (Cummings, Enfield's co-writer) and we came up with the idea of doing an English rites-of-passage/gross-out film. Rather than taking British TV sitcoms that went to the big screen and didn't work as our precedent, like Steptoe and Son and On the Buses, we looked to American teen films like Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and Wayne's World, and planned an English version of that, with all the English quirks that that means. But we got a call from LA [the film was backed by American company Icon Entertainment], saying 'push the envelope', which meant make it disgusting. Squeeze the spots, essentially.\"\n\nThe American influence is also there in the way that Kevin and Perry is, in its own suburban way, aspirational, with the acne-strewn teens ultimately escaping from their dirty-bedrooms-and-sticky-Kleenex mire. \"I'm not a massive Mike Leigh fan myself,\" says Enfield. \"The British tend to make films that are either a bit rainy or costume dramas. I wanted to do something where we got up and out into the sun and which was ultimately about international rites of passage - we're all like this, it's a hormonal, rather than a social thing.\" But there are certain aspects of our own culture that run too deep to ever be eradicated. \"Films like Bill and Ted always feel about 10 minutes too long because they're only on one level, you're asked to suspend your disbelief when Wayne and Garth suddenly get these Hollywood babes. So we added that British sense of pathos by going one step further - Kathy's a woman and I'm 38. They're monsters, and the girls they go after are fairly monstrous too, and just as awkward. Although they end up being pretty, because I wanted a happy ending of course.\"\n\nIn the original sketches Kevin is relentlessly nasty, but in the film he gets so knocked back - mainly by girls, but also by the hideous Eyeball Paul (Rhys Ifans), Ibiza's top DJ - that he even starts being nice to his parents. \"The boys are humiliated time after time,\" says Enfield. \"They get vomited on in the nightclub, don't get the girls, and have to leave in disgrace.\"\n\nThe boys lose their cool entirely over Eyeball Paul: they clean his floor and carry his records, all in the hope that he will listen to their DJ mix tape, before telling them to fuck off. And no matter what he does to them, the boys always have the same response: \"That Eyeball Paul's such a nice bloke!\" \"Though people in the music business tell me Eyeball Paul's just like X or Y,\" says Enfield, \"he was based on my memories of punk gigs, going backstage and being told to fuck off, then walking away saying, 'He told me to fuck off!' It's that optimism that makes Kevin and Perry loveable.\"\n\nBut Kevin's only truly effective tormentors are his parents, who make his life a living hell by reminding him, night after night, how they brought him into the world in the first place. \"My parents weren't like Kevin's in what they got up to,\" Enfield firmly points out. \"But my relationship with them was like that, and in many ways it still is. My dad, Edward Enfield, is on telly a lot now doing holiday programmes, and I can't watch it, although I think he's really good, and attractive at what he does - I hate to use that word about my father, my backbone's gone all funny just having said the word. I turn into Kevin as soon as I watch him on television.\"\n\nIt's tempting to imagine what might have happened if Enfield had chosen to adapt any of his other characters for film. \"Because of the relationship I have with Kathy I did have a story for Wayne and Waynetta Slob. It was about them splitting up and everyone mistaking Wayne for David Bailey, but it was one side of a piece of paper.\" The other characters that have made Enfield famous - Tim Nice But Dim, Tory Boy, even Stavros and Loadsamoney - seem very much confined to three-minute sketches, with the exception of one. Norbert Smith: A Life was a brilliant satirical one-off on the history of British cinema through the eyes of a genteel luvvie who had seen it all, from 30s Will Hay comedies through to swinging 60s thrillers. \"That was the first thing I wrote,\" says Enfield. \"It was very stylised stuff. A David Hemmings character saying to a girl, 'Come on you bitch, into the car.' Charlie Higson [his regular collaborator] was in that, and it's interesting seeing his Randall & Hopkirk (Deceased), which has that stylised feel to it.\"\n\nEnfield is known for playing other people. Would he ever want to move away from sketch based-comedy to stand-up? \"I'd been on Wogan one time, and the next day this bloke in the street said: 'You're a right cunt in real life, aren't you?' It doesn't bother me if people think like that, but it takes confidence not to do sketches.\"\n\nThe whole point of Kevin and Perry is that they're desperate to get laid. As their house anthem Big Girl goes, \"All I want to do is do it\". Needless to say, the film reaches a feverish climax. Can there be any future for them now? \"It kind of depends on how much the film makes,\" says Enfield, who at the moment has no future plans, at all. \"I suppose if it's really successful they could wake up and it was all a dream.\""
