        "text": "Many of us will argue that the early 2000s were an iconic time.\n\nThe turn of the millennium was a huge moment is everyone's lives and it brought about revolutionary culture, music, art, fashion, TV and film.\n\nThe pubs and bars were playing iconic artists like Craig David, the world was obsessed with Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt, some thought the world was going to end, fashion magazines were filled with Ugg boots and aviator sunglasses, and Big Brother had only just launched.\n\nThose of us who were teenagers in 2000 may be able to remember the hilarious coming-of-age film Kevin & Perry Go Large starring Harry Enfield and Kathy Burke.\n\nFind local news in your area by inputting your postcode into the tool below:\n\nIf you ever need a pick-up then it's definitely a film that will make you cry with laughter - as well as cringe at some of the disturbing and embarrassing scenes.\n\nBut when they weren't filming in Ibiza, the film actually made use of Hertfordshire and specifically Watford's intu Shopping Centre which was known as the Harlequin Shopping Centre at the time.\n\nWhat is Kevin & Perry Go Large about?\n\nIf you haven't seen Kevin & Perry Go Large then you are really missing out. iI's become a cult classic.\n\nThe film stars Harry Enfield who plays Kevin and Kathy Burke who plays Perry - two teenagers who want to become DJs but who can only be described as crude.\n\nThe film was based off Enfield's TV sketch 'Kevin the Teenager' and it also starred many of the actors who appeared on Harry Enfield & Chums.\n\nAt the start of the film we learn that the boys have been trying for years to lose their virginity - and failing miserably.\n\nSo they decide they want to go to Ibiza to become DJs, or \"Deejays\" as Kevin would say, as well as get \"guaranteed sex\".\n\nUnfortunately Kevin's parents eventually come along with them but they soon meet the 'girls of their dreams' - Candice and Gemma.\n\nWho could forget the brilliant scene when the boys leave the ocean in their clothes, introduce themselves to the girls at the bar wearing drenched coats and say: \"Afternoon ladies. A lovely afternoon for the beach ay ladies?\"\n\nThey also meet the insufferable DJ Eyeball Paul who does horrific shots of vodka into his eyeball because he claims \"it gets into the bloodstream quicker\".\n\nWe follow the boys as they try to become DJs in Ibiza's top clubs of the time while having to endure cringeworthy moments like when they were thrown up on by club-goers, or when Perry filmed Kevin's parents in the bedroom and Eyeball Paul played it in the club.\n\nHertfordshire makes an appearance\n\nOur lovely county makes one appearance in the film just before the friends move to Ibiza.\n\nAt the start of the film after the boys have been to a house party, they head to a shopping centre to play some of their DJ tunes.\n\nThe shopping centre used is actually the old Harlequin Shopping Centre in Watford, Hertfordshire, which was renamed intu Watford Shopping Centre at a later date.\n\nIt looked very different compared to how it does today but it offers Watford residents the chance to look back fondly. Some people may even remember when the filming took place.\n\nIn the scene the boys are playing their songs while other teenagers around them are dancing.\n\nThey're trying to make some money to get their holiday to Ibiza but they're soon interrupted by a girl who Kevin had shared a bed with at the house party the night before.\n\nHow was the film received?\n\nOver the Easter weekend in 2000, the film was the top-grossing film at the British box office taking £2 million and ranking as the number one film in the UK.\n\nUnfortunately it was knocked off the top spot the following week by Scream 3 but it then went back to number one the week after.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film hasn't yet been given a score by critics but the audience score stands at 70 per cent out of 10,398 ratings.\n\nThe BBC actually rated the film as 4/5 stars and Mark Sinker of the British Film Institute reviewed the film and said: \"Go Large is an amiable roll through vomit, poo and erections, public-humiliation and hating-your-parents gags, working through the most obvious permutations and a scatter of clever ones.\n\n\"Fans of Harry Enfield and Kathy Burke's characters get pretty much what they are after. Their foray beyond the television-skit format of Harry Enfield and Chums cheerfully enters the revolting world of Farrelly Brothers' humour.\"\n\nWhere can I watch the film?\n\nIf you're an Amazon Prime member you can currently stream the film there. The film has previously been on Netflix but was sadly taken off.\n\nHopefully it will come back to Netflix for more audiences to enjoy soon.\n\nSky users can currently rent the film from the Sky store for £3.49 or you can buy it for £2.99."
