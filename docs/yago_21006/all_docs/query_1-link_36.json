Heat magazine reports this week that following its phenomenal success in the UK (box-office takings of Â£6m in its first 10 days), Kevin & Perry could be going large, again.\n\nAlthough most reviewers commented on the film's failure to sustain what is essentially a 5-minute sketch idea in a 90-minute feature film, an insider told the magazine: \"We always thought there might be more scope from these two characters than just one film.\" But he added that Enfield, who co-wrote and co-produced the movie, would not consider a sequel until he sees how well his film fares in the US."
