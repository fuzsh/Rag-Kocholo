        "text": "(Image: Paramount Pictures)\n\nIf you can believe it, Kevin and Perry Go Large was released a whopping 18 years ago this year and to celebrate street-food kings Taste and Liquor will be hosting a Brunch Rave in their honour, this coming July (14/07). This secret warehouse party is definitely the place to be, if you too, fancy yourself as the ultimate raver.\n\nFrom 1pm til late the biggest 90s house, techno and trance tunes will play to crowds whilst the best street-food vendors indulge you with some tasty goods. Got to keep up your stamina for those big-fish, small-fish, carboard box moves you’ll be busting out into the evening. They, of course, promise more than a modest jam sandwich, thankfully!\n\nBottomless vodka cocktails will be dished out to ravers between 1pm – 2pm so arrive not so fashionably early for this one. Organisers will be encouraging you to don your cheapest tracksuit and rave hat for this absolute mash-up anyway, so a catwalk, it won’t be!\n\nTicket holders will have to wait to find out the location of this event though (I know, so unfair!) as details will be announced at 12pm the night before. Yes, they really are that dedicated to the 90s theme! So much so, there are also whispers that a showing of the film will take place and video games will be available for punters too.\n\nForget Ibiza this summer, its going off big in Birmingham!"
