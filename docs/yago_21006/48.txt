Cult British film Kevin & Perry Go Large celebrates its 20-year landmark in 2020, with Amnesia throwing a party in its honour.

The special celebratory event is scheduled for Monday 7 September and will be co-produced by One More Time and Ibiza Trance Event.

DJs set to play include old school favourites Judge Jules and Seb Fontaine, the latter of whom consulted on set for the film.

Amnesia resident Les Schmitz and Cream regular Sean Hughes are the final two names.

The night will comprise of a screening of the film from 22:00 until 00:00, followed by the party from midnight onwards.

Invoking more '00's nostalgia, the final set of the night will be a foam party.

2000's Kevin & Perry Go Large was a spin-off from the popular Harry Enfield and Chums sketch show. The film starred Enfield, the characters' creator, and comedienne Kathy Burke in the lead roles.

The plot centred around two hormonal adolescents, as they head to Ibiza in a bid to become superstar DJs. Many of the scenes were shot in Amnesia.

Kevin & Perry Go Large's toilet humour and ropey script might not have won any academy awards, but the film remains a favourite to this day. Its soundtrack and depictions of famous Ibiza landmarks won it a generation of fans.
