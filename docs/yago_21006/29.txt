Story

Best friends Kevin and Perry decide they need to lose their virginity and to become, "top DJs", and plan to go to Ibiza to do so. They receive a reward for accidentally foiling a bank raid, and with Kevin's parents agreeing on the condition that they accompany them, they go to Ibiza.

Once in Ibiza, they meet the world famous DJ "Eyeball Paul", who takes every opportunity to patronise and insult them - of which they seem to be blissfully ignorant, describing him repeatedly as "such a nice bloke". Kevin and Perry persuade Eyeball Paul to play a song they have created at his next performance, but only after they carry out several chores for him, including cleaning his kitchen floor and unblocking his toilet by hand. Throughout their stay in Ibiza, Kevin and Perry set their sights on "the girls of their dreams", Candice and Gemma, whom Kevin and Perry try and chat up with put-on accents. The teenagers experience several bizarre mishaps which set back their pursuit of Candice and Gemma, including being vomited on from a height and crashing mopeds, and their friendship is strained when Perry films Kevin's parents while they are having sex. The film ends with Kevin and Perry losing their virginity to Candice and Gemma respectively. When back at home, the boys are seen signing copies of their record in a music store, whilst Kevin's parents are seen signing copies of a video they have made about better mid-marriage sex.

Music and DJing featured in the film

Enfield tried to use songs in the film that were top of the dance charts at the timeFact|date=August 2008.

DJ Judge Jules created the mix that Kevin and Perry create in the film, "Big Girl", which was subsequently released as a single credited to Precocious Brats/Kevin And Perry. It was in the top 40 for 4 weeks in 2000, and reached #16 in the UK Singles Charts [http://www.chartstats.com/artistinfo.php?id=9169] .

"Straight to Hell" by The Clash features at the beginning of the film when Kevin begins banging his head on the bedroom wall; the camera pans out to view the street, in which the film title appears. All of the cars are Ford Focuses, and all of the people shown outside are wearing red baseball caps and using Flymo lawnmowers.

In the film, Eyeball Paul is a wealthy and very successful DJ, however, actor Rhys Ifans admits he is a terrible DJFact|date=August 2008, but thanks to "the magic of film" he'll "look pretty sharp out there"Fact|date=August 2008.

Venues featured in the film

The Ibiza club Amnesia makes an appearance in the film. However, the front view of the club, as shown in in the film, is not the same as the actual Amnesia. The DJ booth that Eyeball Paul uses in the film is not the actual booth of the club, which is sited above the giant "spectrum analyser", seen in the film to the right of the fictitious booth.

Viewing Certificate

Harry Enfield suspected the "two uses" of the word "fuck" being the cause of the film's BBFC rating being a 15Fact|date=August 2008 (although it was used three timesFact|date=August 2008), rather than a targeted 12. He revealed in the film's audio commentary that the 15 rating was given because of a scene where a group of men took drugs. According to BBFC guidelines, scenes of drug taking often breach the rules of a 12-rated filmFact|date=August 2008.
