        "text": "Spending a day at Six Flags Over Georgia is fun, and most of the time it’s safe. But accidents can happen. If you or your loved one has been injured at Six Flags Over Georgia, you should consider speaking to a lawyer.\n\nYou may have a legal right to a full financial recovery, including the money you need to pay your medical costs and to help you and your family get your life back.\n\nJohn Foy & Associates has been helping injury victims for over 20 years, and we have grown into one of the largest and most successful personal injury law firms in the nation. Give us a call today at 404-400-4000 to set up your free consultation.\n\nDoes a Six Flags Accident Qualify as a Premises Liability Claim?\n\nYes. The owner of the premises has a duty to any visitors to that property to ensure their safety. If you suffered an accident on their property that was otherwise preventable, you may be able to file a premises liability claim against Six Flags and win.\n\nFurther, if a danger on the property exists, like a broken rollercoaster, and the owner fails to post a warning, then anyone who gets hurt on that rollercoaster has the right to sue.\n\nContact our premises liability attorneys today to discuss your case.\n\nWho Is Responsible for Injuries Suffered at Six Flags Over Georgia?\n\nLegally, Six Flags is liable for the injuries in most cases. Accidents at a theme park usually involve what’s called negligence. Negligence means that the theme park should have done something to protect your safety, but they didn’t. This could be anything from not inspecting rides often enough to not cleaning up a spilled beverage on a restaurant floor. If their negligence led to your injury, then the theme park is legally responsible for the accident.\n\nThis is why we urge injury victims not to blame themselves. We talk to many victims who blame their accident on their own clumsiness or think they should have done something differently. But the owner of the premises has a duty to make sure they are safe for every guest who comes through. You had a right to expect that you could visit the park safely, and it’s not your fault if you were injured.\n\nBut What If You Share Fault?\n\nEven if you did do something to cause your accident and share fault for it happening, you may still be entitled to compensation. Ultimately, the park staff must take measures to protect you from harm. If they failed in their duty to protect you, you may still be entitled to damages.\n\nWhat Kinds of Injuries Are Most Common at Theme Parks Like Six Flags Over Georgia?\n\nWe see many kinds of injuries come out of theme parks. The most common involve:\n\nInjuries caused by rides such as roller coasters. These can be serious and may involve rides that were not properly operated or maintained.\n\nSlip and fall injuries anywhere in the park. These are more common and can happen anywhere in the park.\n\nThese accidents can produce a wide range of injuries, including:\n\nBroken bones\n\nHead injuries\n\nSprained ankle\n\nBack injuries\n\nCuts and lacerations\n\nLoss of a finger, hand, foot, or limb\n\nDeath\n\nWhy Are Slip-and-fall Injuries Common at Theme Parks?\n\nAlthough roller coaster accidents get the most press, slip and fall injuries are far more common. They happen throughout parks for several reasons:\n\nMany rides have elaborate staircases and walkways. Guests are more likely to trip while waiting in line than almost anywhere else.\n\nSix Flags Over Georgia has numerous eateries and concession areas. Many of them are crowded and staffed by young, inexperienced employees. When food or beverages get spilled, they create slipping hazards and may not be cleaned up right away.\n\nSpills can happen almost anywhere in the park, creating slipping hazards in unexpected places.\n\nSlip and fall accidents are not minor. They can lead to broken bones, sprains, head injuries, and other serious conditions.\n\nIf You Were Injured at Six Flags Over Georgia, How do You Know If You Have a Claim?\n\nThe only way to know for sure is to speak to a legal professional. That’s why John Foy & Associates offers a free consultation—so you can get a professional opinion with no risk.\n\nYou should also move quickly. Georgia has strict legal deadlines for filing injury claims. Depending on the accident, the deadline can be as much as two years or it can be only a few weeks. If you miss the deadline you may not be able to recover any money.\n\nTalk to a Georgia Personal Injury Lawyer Today\n\nIf you or someone you love were hurt at Six Flags Over Georgia, you do not have to face the aftermath alone. At John Foy & Associates, our personal injury attorneys have the experience and resources to take on even the biggest theme parks—and we offer a 100% free consultation to evaluate your case."
