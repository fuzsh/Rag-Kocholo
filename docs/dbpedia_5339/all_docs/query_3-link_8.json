        "text": "It's okay to quit a job after 1-2 years. Don't worry about how it looks on your resume. Anyone that cares about job hopping doesn't understand modern work. We change jobs a lot. Sometimes because of a bad boss. Sometimes because of a bad company. Sometimes because of bad compensation. And sometimes because we're curious. The future is multiple careers in one lifetime. Therefore, job hop. Smart companies get it. #Careers #Leadership"
