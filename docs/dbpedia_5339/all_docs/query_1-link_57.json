        "text": "This article explores how the appearance of composite media arrangements and the prominence of the cinematic mechanism in Japanese film are connected to a nostalgic preoccupation with the materiality of the filmic image, and to a new critical function for film-based cinema in the digital age. Many popular Japanese films from the early 2000s layer perceptually distinct media forms within the image. Manipulation of the interval between film frames-for example with stop-motion, slow-motion and time-lapse techniques-often overlays the insisted-upon interval between separate media forms at these sites of media layering. Exploiting cinema's temporal interval in this way not only foregrounds the filmic mechanism, but it in effect stages the cinematic apparatus, displaying it at a medial remove as a spectacular site of difference. In other words, cinema itself becomes refracted through these hybrid media combinations, which paradoxically facilitate a renewed encounter with cinema by reawakening a sensuous attachment to it at the very instant that it appears to be under threat. This particular response to developments in digital technologies suggests how we might more generally conceive of cinema finding itself anew in the contemporary media landscape.\n\nThe contingent instant that Walter Benjamin, among others, claims photography uniquely makes palpable has no place in film. Cinema relies on the impermanence of such elusive moments to generate continuity and presence. This article shows how Oskar Fischinger’s 1927 experimental short \"Walking from Munich to Berlin\" combines photography and film in a way that stages the incompatibility of these technologies, while also forging a new visual language – a radical form of animation – with which to overcome it. The article examines Fischinger’s work as a singular contribution to animation and the avant-garde of the Weimar era and beyond, unraveling its philosophical implications for theories of collecting, film, photography, and animation\n\nPost-modern culture, or rather what we could call, using Philippe Dubois’ terms, the postphotography and postcinema condition, tends to blur the ontological frontiers of photography and cinema. Territories that once stood on their own no longer have easy-to-define boundaries. Instead, photography and cinema are dissolving the grounds of their formerly assumed differences by systematically evoking the effects of the other. As such, cinema is often experienced as if it were a still image (Mulvey 2006) whenever artists and directors choose to fix the camera and stop the image (using new media technologies). Likewise, photography tends to evoke movement by recovering some of the aesthetic features that had been explored by the Futurists in the 1910s (the stroboscopic photography usedby Antonio Giulio Bragaglia is a key example of this tendency). Examples of working on move by alternating the movement within the still image can be seen in the works of artists such as David Clarebout, Thierry Kuntzel and Sam Taylor-Wood. Chris Marker was key to this shifting processes. He was an artist who always looked for new combinations of sound, image and text, both as a director and as a publisher. His seminal film La Jetée (1962, released in 1963) was made up of photographs separately glued on to different sheets of paper, and filmed afterwards. Given the 50 years since its release, we decided to organize a conference on Photography and Cinema, recalling the memory of La Jetée and the issues this celebrated film ended up disseminating. This books gathers the best contributions coming out from that conference.\n\nThis article argues that video technology plays a decisive role in Godard’s double movement toward the “cinematic” and the “post-cinematic” as demonstrated in his videographic essay Histoire(s) du Cinéma. It claims that Godard’s videographic refashioning of cinema in the technical, ontological, and philosophical manners necessarily involves bringing cinema to its limits. As this article will discuss in the ensuing two parts, video’s material and technical elements transform the methods of cinematic montage and the ontological status of the films extracted from disparate sources extensively. As a result, video in Histoire(s) ultimately serves both as a tool for the postcinematic expansion of montage and as a “synthesizer” of discrete images (films, paintings, photographs) and soundtracks whose affiliated media are originally distinct from each other."
