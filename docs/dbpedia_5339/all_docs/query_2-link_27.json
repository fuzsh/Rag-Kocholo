        "text": "Photo Gallery\n\nMACON, Ga. - It's not every day that a start-up football program like Reinhardt University's get mentioned in the same breath as venerable programs in the state of Georgia like Georgia Tech, Georgia, and Georgia Southern.\n\nYet on Tuesday at the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame, the 12th Annual Pigskin Preview broughthead coaches and representatives of every football program in the state under the same roof. There was Reinhardt head coach Danny Cronic, along with freshman quarterback Johnathon Chamblee and freshman defensive back Christian Hill, just two tables over from head UGA football coach Mark Richt, and one table over from first-game opponent Mercer University and head coach Bobby Lamb.\n\nCoach Cronic walked in front of the cameras of WAGA-TV (Fox 5 Atlanta) and was interviewed for a future story. The same could be said for Hill. Chamblee, a Pooler native, was interviewed by WSAV-TV (NBC Savannah) and WJCL-TV (ABC Savannah). The trio also spoke with members of the print media from all across the state.\n\n\"This was a really good event,\" said coach Cronic. \"This was our first time at the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame for this event, and the people there really set up a first-class meet-and-greet for everyone involved. We look forward to coming back next year.\""
