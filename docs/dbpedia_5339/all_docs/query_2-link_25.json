        "text": "The clock says June 8, so that means it's time for . . . COLLEGE FOOTBALL\n\nGeorgia State head football coach Bill Curry and Panther players Michael Davis and Brandon Jones are participating in today's Pigskin Preview Preseason Media Day, an annual event at the State of Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in Macon that features representatives from all of the college football programs in the state. Check back throughout the day for updates, photos and video clips.\n\n8:15 A.M. - The Georgia State crew pulls out from the Sports Arena on the drive to Macon. Michael Davis and Brandon Jones are looking dapper in their suits, especially Brandon's alligator shoes. Given the option to wear polo shirts or shirt-and-tie, the guys elected to wear suits because they did not want to be outdone by Georgia or Georgia Tech or any of the other schools.\n\nJustin Heckert from ESPN the Magazine is with us. He has been writing a series of articles chronicling the birth of the Georgia State football program, and he has begun work on his next piece.\n\n8:45 A.M. - Brandon and Michael are engaged in a discussion about the size of some of today's defensive linemen, including former Atlanta Falcon Grady Jackson and former Alabama lineman Terrence Cody. Coach Curry says that he rarely faced a defensive lineman who weighed 300 pounds, telling them about some of the greats he played against in the NFL, such as Alan Page, Mean Joe Greene, Roosevelt Grier, Merlin Olsen, etc.\n\n9:45 A.M. - The GSU contingent arrives in Macon at the Hall of Fame. We are the first team to arrive, and the players take a few minutes to view the Hall of Fame exhibits as we wait for the media to arrive.\n\n10:00 A.M. - Each football program in the state is assigned a table. Right next to the Georgia State table is . . . Shorter, the Panthers very first opponent on Sept. 2, 2010.\n\n10:30 A.M. - Coach Curry is up first in front of the media, giving a preview of the Panthers' first football team.\n\n10:40 A.M. - Georgia head coach Mark Richt stops by the Georgia State table and introduces himself to Brandon and Michael. He mentions that his son, Jon, considered transferring to Georgia State last summer. Ironically, Jon ended up going to Mars Hill, the school from which Brandon Jones transferred.\n\n10:45 A.M. - Brandon and Michael begin doing interviews with state-wide media. A writer from the Gainesville Times asks about playing in the Dome. Brandon recalls his last game in the Dome, his junior year (2005) at Southwest DeKalb in a preseason game against Stephenson High.\n\n11:00 A.M. - Coach Curry to WAGA-TV Fox 5, \"It's wonderful to be at a Pigskin Preview and to be able to preview pigskin since we're actually playing games this year.\"\n\nCoach Curry, Brandon and Michael are doing numerous interviews with various newspapers and television stations from Atlanta, Macon and around the state.\n\n12:30 P.M. - After nearly two hours of interviews, players, coaches and media sit down to eat lunch. At the GSU table, Brandon and Michael joke about seeing videos of Coach Curry playing in the NFL on Youtube. In particular, they laugh about a play in which Coach Curry tried to tackle Gale Sayers on kickoff coverage.\n\n1:00 P.M. - Heading back to Atlanta. Look for video and quotes this afternoon. Be sure to check out Georgia State coverage in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Macon Telegraph and other newspapers around the state in the next few days.\n\nComments from media interviews:\n\nBRANDON JONES:\n\n[Atmosphere on campus] Everyone you talk to is excited that football is coming and they are very excited for the season to start. We will actually have a Homecoming during the fall. It's going to be a fun season.\n\n[Playing in the Georgia Dome]: Back in high school, I played there once. For the first game, I think the Dome might be packed. I'm very excited.\n\n[On the schedule] Each game is important for us. Each game will be a milestone, and all the opponents are big. We want to get this program started on the right track. We're the ones who are new to the game, so we have to come in and set a standard for the Georgia State program.\n\nMICHAEL DAVIS:\n\n[Atmosphere around the program] Every day, I run into some alum who is definitely excited to have a team. The student body is thrilled. Every time I get on Facebook, somebody's got a status, \"Can't wait for football season.\" I think there is definitely a lot of energy around campus. I think this is something the Georgia State community has been wanting for a long time, and we're looking forward to going out there and giving them what they want.\n\nWe went through 60 practices in the fall and then 15 practices in the spring. All that with no games, so we're ready to get on the field and hit somebody else besides ourselves.\n\nTwo of the things that drew me to Georgia State were my family being able to come see the games, along with playing in the Georgia Dome. The atmosphere in the Dome is crazy. I played there one time in high school. My junior year at Chamblee High School [versus Carver-Columbus] we made it to the state semifinals, and it was crazy. You could just feel the energy from the fans and it was amazing.\n\n[The schedule] Every single team is going to be a challenge. We're a startup program, so we have to establish something ourselves. We're going to prepare the same way for every single game and be excited about every game.\n\n[Playing for Coach Curry] He's got that intensity about him, but at the same time, he's calm and reserved. He's someone we can look to and follow, because he's a man of great faith, and he lives by what he says. We can believe in what says. He's a great role model, and he's also like a father-figure to all of us.\n\nA year before I came here, my cousin graduated from Georgia State, and Coach Curry was the commencement speaker (December 2008). My dad leaned over to me and said, Wouldn't it be great if you could play for someone like that. A few months later, there I am signing my name on the dotted line and becoming a Georgia State Panther. He was definitely one of the big draws in my coming here.\n\nMEDIA COVERAGE:\n\nAtlanta Journal-Constitution\n\nGainesville Times\n\nAthens Banner Herald"
