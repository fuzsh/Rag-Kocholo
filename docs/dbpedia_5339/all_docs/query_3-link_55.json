        "text": "This article may or may not be a stub, but it's definitely missing something.\n\nSpecifically: Mentions of the other comics and mangas he appeared in besides UDON's Street Fighter comics.\n\nYou can help the Street Fighter Wiki by giving us what we need.\n\nFor the boxer named Bison in Japan, see Balrog.\n\nM. Bison, known as Vega (ベガ, Bega?) in Japan, is a video game character and the primary antagonist of the Street Fighter series, first appearing as a non-playable boss in Street Fighter II before becoming playable in its update, Street Fighter II: Champion Edition. He is a self-imposed dictator and megalomaniac seeking world domination. In his character story in Street Fighter 6, he was addressed as the Nameless Man.\n\nBiography\n\nConcept\n\nM. Bison was created after Akira Nishitani asked for an evil overlord with powers beyond mortal understanding to be in the story.[13] M. Bison and his design were inspired by Washizaki (鷲崎, Washizaki? \"Eagle Cape\"), a villain from the manga and anime Riki-Oh; and Yasunori Kato (加藤保憲, Yasunori Kato?), the antagonist from the fantasy film, Tokyo: The Last Megalopolis (aka Teito Monogatari (帝都物語, Teito Monogatari?)).[14][15][16][17][18][19], with his Street Fighter II portrait being identical to Washizaki. His shinguards are based off of the style used in the Universal Wrestling Federation of Japan during the mid 1980s.\n\nM. Bison's Street Fighter V appearance was designed as an aged, yet more powerful M. Bison coursing with Psycho Power, meant to depict his supposed final moments. His moveset was adjusted accordingly with the addition of Psycho Blast and Psycho Inferno as more direct usages of his powers.[20]\n\nM. Bison's horse Rosinante bears a heavy resemblance to Kokuoh from manga series Fist of the North Star, owned by main antagonist Raoh, a similarly power-hungry ruler who also served as inspiration for M. Bison's design. Psycho Punisher also has M. Bison impale the opponent onto his hand, similar to Raoh's Shinkesshū technique. Similarly, M. Bison's OD Head Press has him kneel onto the opponent's neck with his knee, referencing Kinnikuman antagonist Akuma Shogun's Hell's Guillotine.\n\nAppearance\n\nHis general attire consists of a red military uniform with large silver shoulder plates, wrist bands, and shin guards; on his peaked/service cap is the skull insignia of his crime syndicate known as Shadaloo. His clothing highly resembles the Japanese and Chinese Imperial uniforms in red, as per his inspirational sources, with some possible influences from the uniforms worn by SS officers of Nazi Germany; the winged skull on his visor cap and the first letter of Shadaloo on his belt is shaped as a single Sig rune. He sports a dark-colored cape in the Alpha series, in which he appears with his original body. From Street Fighter II on (and in the Capcom vs SNK series), he appears with a much slimmer body, and removes his cape before battle.\n\nM. Bison has neatly cut black hair under his peaked cap, which he is almost never seen without (save for two of his alternate costumes); in the Brazilian Street Fighter comics (Editora Escala), he was instead bald. His eyes were originally red both within and outside the irises (though the irises were still visible); after Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting, they were changed to a complete ghastly white, a trait shared by other characters such as Sagat and Dhalsim. His eyes will glow pink when his Psycho Power is glowing.\n\nAs of Street Fighter V, Bison's look has changed slightly, now wearing a trenchcoat over his outfit without the cape. His hair has also turned white due to the effects of Psycho Power.\n\nHis main outfit became his classic outfit in Street Fighter 6 but now has black hair from Street Fighter II.\n\nIn Street Fighter 6, Bison returns with long white hair and without the top part of his uniform, covering his shoulders and head with a dark blue fabric (presumably the cape he wore in his uniform). His eyes glow with the color of Psycho Power. Bison also has a white facial stubble on his face. Possibly as a result of his final clash with Ryu back in Street Fighter V, M. Bison has inhabited a new body and had a scar on his right side of his face, arm and chest, with the scar covered up by the teal glow of his Psycho Power that he is trying to regain control of. Notably, the scar can be seen in his taunts and victory animations.\n\nIn his character story, it explains his current main outfit in the game with his ragged cape and both his red military pants and black knee-high boots, having stolen them from one of the thugs in the streets of Metro City where he was found completely naked, brutally taking them down. His nakedness also shows his muscularity with six-pack abs, showing his well-toned muscular arms and legs for the first time.\n\nFurthermore, in World Tour Mode, we get to see a young M. Bison during his Soul Power training with Rose in an artwork, revealing that in the past, he had light brown hair before it turned black and eventually white in later games.\n\nName change\n\nWhen Street Fighter II was localized in the United States, Capcom was afraid of a lawsuit from Mike Tyson over a character (Balrog) with his likeness as well as a similar sounding name (Balrog's Japanese name being \"Mike Bison\"). Additionally, when the designers presented the game to Capcom USA's marketing department, they believed that the name \"Vega\" did not fit the character it was given to. They decided to rotate the names of three of the four boss characters in the following manner:\n\nThe boxer is known as Mike Bison in Japan and Balrog in the U.S.\n\nThe Spanish assassin/matador is known as Balrog in Japan and Vega in the U.S.\n\nThe evil dictator and head of Shadaloo is known as Vega in Japan and Master Bison in the U.S.\n\nWithout the reference to Mike Tyson as M. Bison, the etymology of the word Bison comes from an ancient breed of bovine cattle and buffalo, known for their immense physical strength and stature. Even the original recipient of the name, Balrog, still contains bovine references in his moveset. Alternately, their disposition may refer to the yojijukugo phrase \"ox (headed) demons and snake (bodied) deities\" (牛鬼蛇神), being shorthand for being surrounded by evil and malign people or entities of many sorts; from the sly snakeish like assassin and bullheaded thug commanded by the lead fiend, and in turn, is not lost in its take overseas, as M. Bison can be seen as a figurative \"crimson clad devil.\"\n\nLater in Street Fighter 6's World Tour mode, the name change between the three characters were explained in-universe as being the pseudonym of the trio and not actually their true name, with Vega explaining that the name shuffling was an attempt to conceal the true identity of the leadership of Shadaloo.\n\nPersonality\n\nM. Bison is an archetypal villain motivated by his own self-serving interests and lust for absolute power through world domination while also reveling in the one he currently wields as being a proud schemer who enjoys planning for his next move and taking great pride in whatever vile plans he conducts. He is a megalomaniacal and smug terrorist who seeks to rule the world with an iron fist whilst also being universally regarded as the greatest and most powerful martial artist of all time (stated in his own pre-boss fight dialogue with Ryu in Street Fighter Alpha 3), and will readily destroy anything or anyone who dares to stand between him and his shady goals. He shows a complimenting side, however, when he states to Karin Kanzuki that he watched her and Sakura fight, stating that they fight very well for girls and, after she defeats his Dolls, that Karin did well and is a qualified fighter.\n\nPossessing a vast ego and a god complex, ignoring and disregarding any feeling of empathy for others and even takes pleasure in watching people suffer at his hands, never feeling a shred of regret or remorse for the numerous atrocities that he has committed. In many ways, Bison's characterization is comparable to the clinical diagnosis of a real-life psychopath or sociopath. Bison's malevolence and sadism are reflected in his iconic smile, a very wide grin that exposes not just all of the teeth but even the gums as well. He occasionally refers to himself in the third person (possibly to emphasize his own sense of self-importance) and displays a twisted sense of humor, as well as a \"business before pleasure\" attitude.\n\nAs the founder and leader of Shadaloo, M. Bison uses as many illegal methods as possible to achieve his destructive and barbaric goals, ranging from drug trafficking and arms dealing to terrorism and illegal human experimentation. He is not above using coercion (as seen during at least one storyline in Street Fighter Alpha 3) and brainwashing to convert skilled martial artists to his cause, and has even cheated death and returned to wreak havoc not once, but at least twice. While demanding absolute loyalty and obedience from his subordinates, M. Bison considers them as mere pawns rather than human beings, has described the bickering and strife between his top generals as \"delicious entertainment\", and overall tolerates his henchmen only as long as they serve his dark ambitions, displaying his complete disregard for human life. For the same reason, he offers to spare the lives of particularly talented foes on the condition that they pledge their undying loyalty to him; he doesn't care how deep or shallow said loyalty runs, only that their talents serve his purposes. Unsurprisingly, he has earned the eternal enmity of many other Street Fighter characters for his malevolent and sinister nature. Of course, he usually does not care and tends to consider his numerous enemies as mere nuisances.\n\nThroughout various media, M. Bison is shown as an extremely powerful figure, often justifying his arrogance by being able to simultaneously take out multiple opponents through use of his Psycho Power (and often without it). In Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie, M. Bison soundly defeats Guile, and then proceeds to fight and nearly overpower Ken and Ryu, arrogantly relenting in order to prove his superiority. In Street Fighter: The Movie, M. Bison effortlessly kills plenty of AN soldiers in unarmed combat, but is shown to be no match for Guile and is forced to revert to his electromagnetism-powered suit (the film's stand-in for Psycho Power). The UDON comics show him as more than able to defeat several of the fighters he faces, including a Psycho Power-infused Charlie, and he meets his only match in Akuma. In the Street Fighter Zero 2 HK Comic only, when M. Bison faces Akuma, he performs an attack named \"15 Shadows\", in which fifteen shadows based on the characters from Street Fighter Alpha 2 (except Sagat, Akuma and himself) appear to grab and hold his enemy.\n\nIn his return in Street Fighter 6, M. Bison has inhabited a new body and become amnesiac after his final defeat at the hands of Ryu and the collapse of Shadaloo. While he still retains much of his sadistic and violent tendencies, Bison has completely forgot his identity and name as well as much of his megalomaniac ambitions. He is now fighting to \"entertain\" himself in the hopes that he would rediscover who he once was.\n\nLater in World Tour mode, M. Bison has regained most of his memories after absorbing Phantom Bison and has become more thoughtful than before, though he also regains his vast superiority complex as a result. Bison considers the downfall of Shadaloo to be a mere inconvenience, and even concludes that his leadership role of the organization to be \"constricting.\" Bison believes that, even without Shadaloo, his power would attract \"subordinates\" to him over time. This is because Bison believes that he is destined to be above anyone else, and his goal of world domination is inevitable.\n\nPerhaps in one of the rare case of empathy displayed by M. Bison was his relationship with a horse named Rosinante. During his journey through South America, Bison discovered a dying Rosinante due to him sensing his will to roam free again. He then infused the horse with his Psycho Power, to which Rosinante was able to endure the transfusion due to his sheer will to live. Impressed by such a display, Bison chose Rosinante to be his personal steed, and on multiple occasions he would often compared his subordinate's \"usefulness\" to that of Rosinante, showing that he has developed some attachments to his steed out of respect.\n\nIn most of his appearances in crossover games, M. Bison has been deemed worthy of respect by villainous characters who would join forces with him, such as Magneto, Geese Howard and Rita Repulsa. Namco × Capcom and Project X Zone also reveals a curious personality trait - he is hinted to be an extremely provocative and lustful man with an interest for women, as all the opponents he choose to copy using Doppel's powers were attractive girls like Chun-Li, Morrigan and Valkyrie (a fact that is also emphasized by the playable party).\n\nRelationships\n\nAs the leader of the global criminal organization like Shadaloo, Bison has many allies (or subordinates rather) but more so has made many enemies.\n\nAllies\n\nF.A.N.G\n\nF.A.N.G is consistently portrayed as an eternally loyal servant of Bison's who constantly showers his master with compliments and caters to his every whim, almost in a sycophant-esque fashion. Despite this, their loyalty only stems from mutual respect and has little to do with any emotional connections. After F.A.N.G leads the Nguuhao cartel's attempt to betray Shadaloo, Bison retaliates by killing them, whereas F.A.N.G survives past Bison's expectations due to his cunning and resilience. Seeing his abilities, Bison decides to spare F.A.N.G's life and hire him to work directly under the dictator himself, since he seeks strength and ability rather than any emotional fealty in Shadaloo's hierarchy; in return, due to his mentality of striving to be on the \"side that kills, not is killed\" and acknowledging Bison's immense power as a bringer of death, F.A.N.G accepts the offer and joins Bison. It should be noted that the character on his qipao can also be interpreted to mean \"To betray\", which may refer to his first interaction with Bison (a betrayal and assassination attempt) or his underhanded and sneaky nature in general. Ironically, this loyalty has led F.A.N.G to seek ways in the underworld to revive Bison and Shadaloo, as it was officially stated that he survived the ultimate destruction of the base at the end of A Shadow Falls.\n\nVega\n\nVega and Bison have a simple professional relationship. Apart from the usual curious attitude, Vega does not have frictions with Bison. However, the assassin does not seem to be interested in helping the Shadaloo leader conquer the world. This does not bother Bison in the least due to his philosophy, employing Vega so long as he is capable and useful. Whenever the organization is destroyed, Vega reverts to his old lifestyle, but will not hesitate to join again should it resurface.\n\nBalrog\n\nBalrog's personal affiliation with his employer M. Bison is incredibly distant. He cares very little for what Bison's schemes involve and begrudgingly follows his orders as long as he is paid. Bison, likewise, cares very little for Balrog's simple material greed except that he sees it as a useful tool for keeping a capable fighter on board. In fact, Bison finds it entertaining whenever Balrog is bickering with the other members of the Four Kings. Should Shadaloo return, however, he will not hesitate to join again should it resurface.\n\nJP\n\nJP was not only once M. Bison's financial officer within Shadaloo, but also one of the few who successfully receives Psycho Power from M. Bison himself before Shadaloo's downfall in Street Fighter V.\n\nRosinante\n\nA dying workhorse that M. Bison encountered in South America following his resurrection. Seeing Rosinante's fury towards his impending death and desire to run free once more, Bison exposed the horse to Psycho Power, imbuing him with immense strength and restoring his youth. Rosinante's interest in the Avatar led to Bison sparing them, showing a sense of attachment between the two.\n\nEnemies\n\nRose\n\nRose was once M. Bison's disciple. He taught Rose how to utilise Soul Power along with warning her of it's weaknesses.[21] Despite her eccentric nature, Rose is a threat to him and has managed to defeat Bison once before, though she too takes a fall from his hands as well. Due to Rose holding a power similar to his own, her body makes a suitable temporary vessel for Bison whenever his body is destroyed.\n\nAs revealed in M. Bison's World Tour flashbacks in Street Fighter 6, Rose's hatred towards M. Bison begins when he relinquished his Soul Power over Psycho Power and killed their master, M. Bison's master in front of her.\n\nJuri\n\nJuri hates M. Bison with a passion, as his organization was responsible for the murder of her parents and the loss of her left eye, and she constantly plots to kill him. Conversely, M. Bison regards Juri as he does many of his usurping 'pawns', if not most of his foes in general: a minor nuisance at worst. In spite of this, Juri and Bison are shown about to engage in another fight in M. Bison's ending, after Juri threatens that Bison should be less worried about where her special eye came from, and more about what she is about to do to him with it. Her contempt for Shadaloo and Bison would make her go as far as willingly work for the Illuminati under Helen (a facade of Kolin) and Urien. Bison's arcade story in Street Fighter 6 shows Juri shocked at an amnesic Bison and losing to him.\n\nSeth\n\nEven though Seth had served as both a potential new replacement body for Bison and as the CEO of Shadaloo's S.I.N. weapons division, Seth had personally vowed to not be a mere puppet of Bison via his own personal self-awareness as he seeks to eliminate Bison and take over Shadaloo himself for his own personal plans of world domination.\n\nKen Masters\n\nBison had brainwashed Ken into becoming Violent Ken via his Psycho Power, though the latter was able to break free from his influence in due time.\n\nNecalli\n\nNecalli is an ancient evil spirit who seeks to devour strong souls (such as Bison's) as a part of an ancient prophecy.\n\nSagat\n\nSagat had once served as both Bison's personal bodyguard and as a member of the Four Heavenly Kings of Shadaloo, being promised by Bison in the past that he would be able to get his revenge against Ryu, who had scarred his chest with the Metsu Shoryuken. However, Sagat had soon realized that anger and hatred wasn't the way to avenge and heal his personal pride and after seeing Bison brainwash Ryu with his Psycho Power, Sagat had soon turned against Bison, saving and freeing Ryu from his brainwashing while leaving Shadaloo in the process, with Sagat himself personally vowing to atone for his past actions and to also help stop and prevent Bison from achieving world domination.\n\nSecret Society\n\nUnbeknownst even to Bison himself, the equally shady organization sought Bison's destruction due to the dictator's faction becoming extremely uncontrollable, and a more deserving leader at hand. Working through Kolin, and manipulating various people and even deceased people such as Charlie Nash, the Secret Society saw through Bison's predicted destruction, with the exception of Ryu carrying out the prediction instead. His win quotes towards Kolin and Urien shows that he sees them just like other foes, a minor nuisance, though his win quote against Gill shows a more hostile side of him, as the sight of Gill \"pisses him off\". It's likely that he's aware of the existence of the Secret Society, but couldn't care less about their plans.\n\nChun-Li\n\nChun-Li despises M. Bison for his involvement in the murder of her father. She seeks to take down Shadaloo and will do anything to defeat them. She does so in Street Fighter V, particularly in the aftermath of his defeat to Ryu, and even Urien recognizes this.\n\nCammy\n\nCammy was first conceived as one of M. Bison's replacement bodies but also served Bison as an elite assassin 'Killer Bee'. Cammy holds Bison and Shadaloo responsible for her dark past and seeks to ensure that no one else suffers the way she did.\n\nRyu\n\nBison has repeatedly tried to capture Ryu in hopes of using him as a host body or brainwash him into being a member of Shadaloo. Due to Ryu having the Satsui no Hado sealed in him, this is part of M. Bison's plan to control that dark power for himself. Ultimately, Ryu is not only able to subjugate the Satsui no Hado and apply the Mu no Ken as his main source of power instead, but his use of the Mu no Ken also allows him to be the one to finally defeat Bison. As a result of Mu no Ken's effects inside his body caused by Ryu, M. Bison suffers amnesia and gains scars on the upper right half of his body.\n\nAkuma\n\nDespite having no direct confrontations, it is clear that both men hold high contempt towards each other, in turn, due to the events of Street Fighter II. Akuma sees Bison as a far greater evil while Bison sees the Satsui no Hado inside Akuma far more befitting to use on himself. Although Akuma would be a far more suited candidate than Ryu because of his power, the same kind of power would ultimately lead Bison to his hunt for Ryu as Bison believes the procession former's body is the only one capable of defeating Akuma.\n\nIt turns out, as evident by his World Tour flashback in Street Fighter 6, he and Akuma shares a common thing on killing their respective masters (M. Bison's master and Goutetsu, respectively) in front of their respective fellow students, Rose and Gouken.\n\nStory\n\nBackground\n\nAlmost nothing is known about M. Bison's past prior to his appearance in the mainline games and his country of origin is unknown. The only known details of his past is that he was at one point nothing more than a young martial artist like any other but with overwhelming ambitions. He originally wielded Soul Power and passed down his knowledge onto Rose who was his only disciple.[9] However, in order to be the best in the world of martial arts, M. Bison murdered his own master before giving in to complete chaos. M. Bison's master was said to be the only known person in the world who could manipulate the evil power known as \"Psycho Power\" at the time and it is also said that, before his death, M. Bison's master passed the power to only three other students, M. Bison himself being one of them. His former disciple, Rose was also present, horrifically watched M. Bison killed their masters after he discarded the Soul Power over his Psycho Power.[2]\n\nShortly afterwards, hoping to seek both knowledge and strength to become the strongest in the world, Bison sought out many practitioners of other fighting styles to defeat and learn of their techniques, in the pursuit of being able to reinforce and keep his title as the strongest martial artist in the world. Later on, Bison would somehow come into power over his syndicate of Shadaloo.\n\nAt some point, M. Bison heard rumors of an assassin’s fist, and tracked down Gouken, the heir of the Ansatsuken.[22][23] Gouken expected that M. Bison would eventually come to him. However, he faced M. Bison with only his fists, not relying on moves such as Hadoken and Shoryuken, which resulted in his defeat.[22][24] M. Bison noticed this and curses Gouken for not showing his true power, he then comments on his students being more willing to show Ansatsuken's true power and leaves.[22][25]\n\nStreet Fighter Alpha 2\n\nM. Bison, leader of the criminal organization known as Shadaloo, hears of a fighter named Ryu who defeated his new henchman, Sagat. Bison decides to recruit Ryu and begins the search for him. In the meantime, he is confronted by Rose, a mysterious woman who wields a power that is in many ways similar to his own. Rose wins the ensuing battle, only to find out that M. Bison has left the battlefield completely unscathed, which is elaborated on during the events of Street Fighter Alpha 3.\n\nAfterwards, M. Bison encounters Chun-Li; they have a brief duel, in which he toys around with the girl, before fleeing and letting Chun-Li know that he murdered her father. Bison is then finally able to track down Ryu, and at first, attempts to persuade Ryu to join him by promising that he would make him the greatest fighter ever. Ryu refuses, however, and the two engage in combat; M. Bison wins and takes Ryu's body to his scientists for a brainwashing via exposure to Psycho Power, which actually occurs during Street Fighter Alpha 3 as well.\n\nDuring all of this, Bison would eventually encounter Charlie Nash, who is on a mission to defeat Bison. Although Bison wins in the first encounter, he would then be confronted by Charlie again by a waterfall, who informs him that the helicopter will arrive in five minutes, to which Bison retorts to Charlie to enjoy this time, as it will be the very last five minutes of his life. The two would clash, and although Charlie wins, he is then shot in the back by a military helicopter, and Bison finishes off Charlie by punching a hole through his chest (as shown in Bison's prologue story in Street Fighter V) which causes Charlie to drop his dogtags and fall to his possible grave. One of the Air Force soldiers working for Bison asks him if Charlie could survive, but Bison says that even if Charlie did, there was no coming back from it, as Charlie now knows that everything has a price.\n\nStreet Fighter Alpha 3\n\nBy the time of Street Fighter Alpha 3, the Psycho Power begins pushing M. Bison's body to its limits. Having predicted this event, he had his scientists engineer a body that he could transfer his essence into in the form of Cammy: a genetically engineered girl created using M. Bison's DNA as a template, and part of his elite squad of Dolls, brainwashed young women who serve as assassins. However, over the course of Alpha 3, Cammy begins to develop self-awareness and goes rogue. Bison sends Vega to retrieve her, and then Juli, another member of the Dolls when Vega fails. Considering alternatives for the spare body, M. Bison turns his sights to Ryu, one of the strongest fighters in the world, and the personal nemesis of his right-hand man Sagat.\n\nOn his journey to find Ryu, M. Bison learns of Akuma, the lone warrior that employs fighting techniques similar to Ryu's, and the evil energy that surrounds him. In his story, when M. Bison defeats Akuma, he claims that the Satsui no Hado is \"less than nothing\", and that is only a matter of time before he claims Ryu’s body.[26] This may explain why, in Adon's storyline, M. Bison knows about the Shun Goku Satsu, and refers to it as a \"pitifully weak move\".\n\nIn Ryu's storyline, M. Bison then sends Juni, another Doll, to gather data on Ryu. In order to lure him out, M. Bison kidnaps his best friend and rival, Ken Masters, brainwashing and pitting him against Ryu. Enraged by M. Bison's actions, Ryu manages to defeat Ken and free him of M. Bison's evil influence.\n\nRyu then takes on M. Bison but loses despite giving his all. Once defeated, Ryu is subjected to M. Bison's Psycho Power. Sagat, witnessing these events, objects and M. Bison responds by telling him he can finally have his long-desired rematch with Ryu. As Sagat urges Ryu to snap out of M. Bison's hypnosis, Ken and Sakura attack M. Bison and engage him in battle, allowing Ryu to break free of M. Bison's mental grip.\n\nOnce again, Ryu engages M. Bison in an epic battle. Suddenly, a strange connection is established between M. Bison's Psycho Power and the Satsui no Hado within Ryu. Realizing that the two energies are akin, M. Bison attempts to put Ryu under his control once again. With his friends urging him to prevail, Ryu manages to resist and strikes M. Bison down with a powerful Metsu Shoryuken (as shown during Ryu's ending). Bison is then temporarily incapacitated and retreats to the Psycho Drive to regenerate himself.\n\nMeanwhile, Cammy, now acting on her own, manages to assemble the remaining Dolls and turns them against their master. The refreshed M. Bison appears and decides that the Dolls are no longer of use to him, therefore, they are to be disposed of. All of the Dolls fight back, but M. Bison informs them that if he is to perish, because of the psychic link between the dolls and him, they will experience the same fate. Nevertheless, the Dolls escape the Shadaloo base as their minds slowly begin to deteriorate. Cammy, with little time left, takes advantage of her genetic similarity to M. Bison in order to operate the Psycho Drive. Using it, she removes the psychic fail-safe on the Dolls and saves them.\n\nIn the retconned event in Guile's ending, US military officers Charlie and Guile enter the base on a mission to stop the dictator, joined by Chun-Li. After learning that the bombardment of Shadaloo was called off due to corruption in Interpol and M. Bison's manipulation, Chun-Li realized that they would have to destroy the base themselves. As Chun-Li and Guile escape the explosive-rigged base, Charlie keeps fighting the resurrected M. Bison, and ultimately seems to sacrifice his own life to allow their escape.\n\nBison remains inside Rose's body until his Shadaloo scientists forge a new body for him, at which point he releases Rose from his control, and she awakens back at home, with few memories of what happened.\n\nStreet Fighter II series\n\nSometime after gaining a new body, Bison uses Shadaloo to establish a base in a temple in Thailand. Bison also subjugated a nearby village to establish his criminal empire yet still provided the village with essential supplies. To lure out Ryu once more, Bison announces the World Warrior Tournament.[27]\n\nDuring finals of the tournament, Bison battles Ryu.[28]\n\nM. Bison's plans are foiled by Akuma (who was not a competitor in the tournament) who catches him off guard and performs the Shun Goku Satsu on him, killing the Shadaloo boss in an instant. Akuma then takes M. Bison's place to fight the finalist of the dictator's tournament (some sources hint that it was Ryu).[29] Akuma mocks M. Bison for being the slave of his own power, not knowing that he is actually in absolute control of his Psycho Power.\n\nIn Street Fighter IV: Aftermath, Guile, Chun-Li, Ken, Ryu, and Cammy manage to foil Bison's plans and fight him in the wilderness of Thailand. During the fight, Bison was ultimately defeated by the group of fighters and was urged to surrender by Guile. However, Bison ultimately refuses and commits suicide by unleashing all of his Psycho Power to create an explosion that kills himself. The animation being canon is unknown as Capcom hasn't mentioned it in other media. Capcom reprinted the All About Street Fighter books for the 30th Anniversary Collection that mentions Akuma defeating M. Bison. Capcom revisits Akuma killing M. Bison in SFV where Akuma's SFII ending is the only one that shows M. Bison being killed, along with SFV April Fools 2019.\n\nFollowing this event, The government had tirelessly investigated the base and concluded that Bison and the other members of Shadaloo had died. Unbeknownst to them, however, Bison's soul managed to survive and was being transferred to yet another replacement body.\n\nIf the player wins the tournament as Bison, a non-canon ending will play where he states that there is no one left to oppose him, and alludes to Akuma as, \"The Ancient One\", mentioning that not even Akuma was brave enough to stop him. After the speech, and he successfully rules the world with no more opposition to get in his way. The ending narrator then asks if there is still any hope for defeating Bison.\n\nStreet Fighter IV: The Ties That Bind\n\nThis section is currently incomplete.\n\nPlease assist the Street Fighter Wiki,\n\nand complete the section if you can.\n\nStreet Fighter IV series\n\nAt some point before the events of Street Fighter II, M. Bison ordered the creation of at least 26 androids by S.I.N., the weapons division of Shadaloo. #15 (i.e. Seth) was chosen to be the new head of S.I.N., demonstrating a higher level of intelligence than the others. #15 was referred to indirectly as \"M. Bison's right hand\". Bison also had a Korean official murdered along with his family; the official's young daughter, Juri, barely survives, and #15 gives her cybernetic enhancements, deciding she can be used as a test subject since she already was a Taekwondo prodigy.\n\nAfter M. Bison's death, #15 takes the name Seth and makes his own attempt at world domination, beginning with the announcement of a new tournament. But Juri has a plan of her own and, apparently aware that M. Bison has survived, tries to pit M. Bison and Seth against each other in revenge for her parents' murder.\n\nDespite his soul not being transplanted into another body, Bison manages to manipulate events behind the scenes and even ordered both Balrog and Vega to capture Seth but would later drop him off to his headquarters, with Seth revealing that S.I.N has also been manipulating Shadaloo.\n\nM. Bison then takes the bait Juri had and returns, his soul transplanted to yet another new body (again not as powerful as the one from his Alpha days). Though his scientists try to dissuade him (their reasoning being that, in time, a new body could be created that could hold the Psycho Power in its entirety), M. Bison chooses the weaker body instead of remaining dead any longer, stating that he never imagined that Seth would go so far and it will only be a matter of time before M. Bison would inhabit his body, anyway. He then takes part in Seth's new World Warrior tournament, completely incapacitating his opponents in the qualifying rounds. There, he even meets C. Viper and threatens to kill her if she doesn't give him her gadgets, Viper declines and the two fight.\n\nM. Bison eventually reaches Seth's S.I.N. headquarters at the head of the remaining androids, attacking Seth for renouncing his mindless servitude, which makes him useless. Seth protests that he had almost rebuilt M. Bison's empire, which had fallen into decline since the second World Warrior tournament; however, M. Bison counters by saying that everything that has happened has, in fact, been part of M. Bison's plan. Standing over the helpless Seth, he is suddenly confronted by Juri, whose plan to have the two destroy each other failed, as Seth did not put up enough of a fight.[30] Juri threatens M. Bison, who is unimpressed, and the two clash, and as revealed by Bison's Street Fighter IV ending, Bison prevails.\n\nMeanwhile, another android which had been fighting Abel shows signs of also developing self-awareness like Seth, and M. Bison promptly destroys it, remarking that Abel has grown since an unspecified last meeting. His exact relationship with Abel is unknown; however, it is heavily implied that Abel was somehow part of the experiments that created the androids, and may in fact be one of them. On his way out of the facility, M. Bison ambushes Rose, who was also at the S.I.N. headquarters; remarking that she owes him something, M. Bison incapacitates her and threatens to take it back \"with interest\". As he reaches his jet, however, he is confronted by Guy, who threatens to destroy the jet if M. Bison does not hand her over. Apparently, in a hurry, Bison acquiesces and relinquishes the unconscious Rose.[31]\n\nAt some point during all this, M. Bison comes across Cammy and Decapre, and notes that Decapre is dying, but that \"a bargain could be made\". Cammy allows M. Bison to take Decapre in the hopes that he will save her.[32]\n\nStreet Fighter V\n\nAs expected, M. Bison returned in Street Fighter V. He was first teased at the end of Charlie's gameplay trailer in a silhouette unleashing his Psycho Power while laughing maniacally.[33] His official reveal occurred on May 19, 2015.[34]\n\nCharacter story\n\nIn his character story, C. Viper is about to infiltrate the rooftop of the Shadaloo base, but before doing so, she recounts what happened to Charlie Nash during his pursuit of M. Bison. Charlie found Bison and was about to arrest him. He goes into a fight with him, not knowing what Bison is capable of using the Psycho Power. Bison defeats Charlie easily and throws him into a waterfall, leading to his disappearance and alleged death.\n\nOn the rooftop, as F.A.N.G appears, C. Viper thinks about when F.A.N.G was a member of Nguuhao, a huge cartel under Shadaloo's umbrella that was at one point obliterated by Bison. F.A.N.G was the only member whom Bison left alive, owing to his power. Following his defeat in a fight with Bison, he swears alliance to him and joined Shadaloo.\n\nBack to the present, Bison has a meeting with Vega, Balrog, F.A.N.G, Enero, Xiayu, Jianyu and some of his foot soldiers and wants to know about the status of the operation. F.A.N.G tells him that everything's in place and soon they can carry the operation out, which is to conquer the world. C. Viper is stitching the pieces of information together when she is spotted by Bison. Bison reassures his people that the operation cannot be stopped and soon everything will come to an end.\n\nA Shadow Falls\n\nBison devises a plan which includes a creation of seven Black Moons, a powerful satellite capable of causing havoc via electromagnetic pulse wave. The ensuing terror and chaos would fuel Bison's infamous Psycho Power to a near godlike level. His plan is put to a temporary halt as the pieces of the machinery that controls the Moons are stolen by one of Shadaloo's programmers working on the project. Bison then dispatches his generals to locate the rogue programmer and retrieve the missing pieces. We learn that the programmer has sent seven pieces to various street fighters all over the world.\n\nAfter the one of the pieces is recovered by F.A.N.G, a large city in North America (presumably New York City, although this is never explicitly stated) falls victim to one of Bison's Black Moons. Bison personally appears in the city after its decimation and witnesses the argument between his generals. The conflict in Shadaloo ranks seizes the moment Guile and Chun-Li appear at the scene. Chun-Li, eager to settle the scores with Bison, ignores Guile's warning and rushes headlong into the fight. She is, however, no match for Bison whose powers have now increased drastically due to the panic and fear caused by his weapon in the sky. Chun-Li is badly beaten and about to be killed, but Cammy's well-timed intervention saves her. The trio escapes as Bison deems them unworthy of pursuit.\n\nAware of the threat that Bison poses, the Illuminati Secret Society revive the corpse of Charlie Nash in order to make it into a weapon of assassination. His body enhanced through bio-engineering and his mind manipulated into believing that there is nothing left for him out there but the destruction of Bison, Nash embarks on a suicide mission. He manages to locate and infiltrate Shadaloo HQ, but, once confronted with Bison, the man that killed him long ago, he suffers a severe defeat. Realizing that Bison is now way too powerful for anyone to take him on, Charlie only manages to escape due to the appearance of Necalli. The ancient consumer of powerful souls challenges Bison as well, but even he gets overwhelmed by the dictator's Psycho Power, now increased hundredfold. Bison manages to avert the ancient prophecy and defeat 'The Soul Consuming Darkness'.\n\nAfter he makes his escape from the Shadaloo base, Charlie is reunited with his friend Guile and the fighters that oppose Bison gathered around Karin Kanzuki. He begins to realize the potential of the Illuminati bio-engineering and the powers bestowed upon him. With the proper utilization, his new body is capable of absorbing and nullifying the Psycho Power. However, it remains to be seen whether it will work on someone as powerful as Bison.\n\nIn the final attack on the Shadaloo base, determined Charlie faces Bison once more. Bison, now seemingly invincible due to the worldwide panic spread by his Moons, wins again. Nash, however, manages to absorb an enormous amount of Psycho Power before he is obliterated by it. With Rashid working on stopping the remaining Moons from descending, this effort proves to be enough to significantly weaken Bison. Having his special training completed by finally mastering the darkness within and taking out Necalli, Ryu shows up to stop Bison for good.\n\nBison requests that Ryu shows him the power that defeated Necalli, and Ryu responds that it is not a power to defeat - it is the power to push forward. Bison scoffs and tells Ryu that power is just power, that the quest for ultimate power leads to conflict, and the conflict leads to the ultimate battle. He is nearly killed by Ryu but laughs and says \"We're not done.\" he then attempts to perform a Psycho Inferno but Ryu counters it with a Hadoken. Bison merely laughs as he fades away, presumably consumed by the Power of Nothingness. His base soon crumbles into the ground along with his hat.\n\nAfter these events and Shadaloo's ultimate destruction, Bison becomes a mere specter that haunts people, such as his body replacements like Ed and Falke.\n\nStreet Fighter 6\n\nM. Bison makes an unexpected return in Summer 2024, despite his apparently final death in Street Fighter V.\n\nA man who resembles M. Bison, the leader of Shadaloo, who was believed to be dead. He has lost his memories, but has violent tendencies. He appears in locations related to Shadaloo, guided by Psycho Power.\n\nArcade Mode\n\nM. Bison: An Unquenchable Thirst\n\nBison is referred in his arcade story as the Nameless Man and his story begins with him waking up in Metro City Alleyway naked, without memories, and no recollection of who he was. Then, a trio of thugs approach the Nameless Man and make fun of him, assuming that he was mugged and calling him a \"loser\". Bison then stood up — his presence is so intimidating that it even causes one of them to beg for his mercy despite having just mocked his current appearance a few moments ago. The Nameless Man then beats up the thugs and takes one of their clothes. When one of the three thugs asks who he is, the Nameless Man said he doesn't know, but he does know that with the urge (i.e. Psycho Power) he wields, he will follow it and find out who he is again to satiate his \"hunger\".\n\nEventually, the Psycho Power led the Nameless Man into the Ruined Shadaloo Lab. As the Nameless Man ponders on why the \"power\" he wields has guided him here. Juri approaches him and is startled by his familiar presence, questioning if who she is seeing is M. Bison. The Nameless Man then asks Juri who \"Bison\" is, in which Juri tells him that M. Bison is the \"lowest of the low\" and that he is supposed to be dead by now. Intrigued, the Nameless Man challenged Juri to a fight to know more about who \"Bison\" is.\n\nAfter Juri's defeat, the Nameless Man grabs her by the throat and asks if he is resembling \"M. Bison\" and what would she do if he is \"Bison.\" Angered, Juri responds that she'll make him remember \"everything [he] ever did\" and then \"make sure [he] suffers and dies again\". The Nameless Man then drops Juri and taunts her, proclaiming that he will never be killed by \"the likes of [her]\" and that he viewed her as nothing but \"a squawking crow\". He then decides to take the name \"Bison\" as his own, and then demands Juri to fight him some more to satisfy his hunger for battle and power.\n\nWorld Tour\n\nBison is depicted providing vocals at a concert when Dee Jay reminisces about Shadaloo, mistakenly believing the criminal syndicate was a popular band.\n\nAzure Darkness. Cloaked in Calamity. Endless Nightmare. (紺碧の闇。災厄に包まれて。終わりのない悪夢。, Konpeki no yami. Saiyaku ni tsutsuma rete. Owari no nai akumu.?)\n\nAn amnesiac man who decided to take the \"M. Bison\" name for himself is discovered on a cliff of Nayshall at night by the Avatar. It is revealed that he infected a male horse he now rides with a Psycho Power, saving him from the brink of death. He named his new found steed \"Rosinante\". The Avatar takes a picture of Bison after he lands with his steed and Rosinante almost crushes them. Bison then chooses to spare the Avatar because Rosinante likes them, and then guides them to the Ruined Lab.\n\nAfter the Avatar battled a Shadaloo test subject in the Ruined Lab, it caused the machinery in the lab and the chair with Bison's cap to activate, unleashing Psycho Power and past memories of M. Bison to create the face of Phantom Bison. It draws an amnesiac M. Bison's attention, who then absorbs Phantom Bison into his body to become whole once more, and ultimately leads to the Avatar becoming his disciple.\n\nBison speculated that the reason why he survived the battle with Ryu is possibly because his soul has been transformed into one of his backup bodies somewhere in the world, and considers the possibility that there might be another \"Bison\" roaming around somewhere in the world. Though he admits that the Shadaloo he once knew may have gone, Bison is still adamant about his world domination goals, and believes that he will attract more \"subordinates\" by himself eventually to fulfill his goal.\n\nFollowing his return to lead the Shadaloo remnants, while still incomplete because of his amnesia, the Avatar seeks the fighters who last encountered Bison back in \"A Shadow Falls\", namely Ryu, Ken, Guile, Juri, Cammy and Chun-Li, to learn more about who Bison was.\n\n\"“Never cease your pursuit for power. For it too, shall one day be mine. Heheh… (権力の追求を決してやめないでください。その権力も、いつかは私のものになるでしょう。ふふふ… Kenryoku no tsuikyū o kesshite yamenaide kudasai. Sono kenryoku mo, itsuka wa watashi no mono ni narudeshou. Fufufu…)”\"\n\n—M. Bison's advice after completing training & achieving Mastery\n\nOther appearances\n\nStreet Fighter Alpha: Warriors' Dreams\n\nM. Bison appears as a secret character in Street Fighter Alpha, chosen in the Random Fighter box by either via a special input or by timing the choice correctly on him. Like all other characters, his storyline was retconned by Street Fighter Alpha 2.\n\nIn his storyline, M. Bison defeats Shadaloo's opposition and confronts Rose, who claims that he has abused his powers and that he must be stopped. Bison insists that Rose stops making speeches and fight him. In his ending, M. Bison emerges victorious, commenting that Rose not only wasted his time but her own life as well. He leaves while replaying the battle in his mind.\n\nStreet Fighter EX series\n\nBackground\n\nM. Bison is in the process of developing his crime syndicate and underground army called Shadaloo. He is looking for particularly skilled and deadly fighters to join his ranks. After the first Street Fighter tournament, M. Bison recruits Sagat, who is devastated by the loss of his title as champion to Ryu. Bison determines that an efficient way of attracting that kind of talent is to host another worldwide Street Fighting tournament.\n\nBison watches the matches with a keen eye, and he is delighted to see that Ryu has entered the tournament as well. After overhearing a discussion between Ryu and a man in a dark gi, he approaches Ryu and asks him if he would like to join Bison's organization. An angry Ryu passes, seeming only interested in trying to track down the man he just spoke to. Bison is disappointed with his response and insists that if Ryu does not join Shadowloo of his own free will, Bison will see to it that he perishes. They launch into a fight and Bison uses the information he overheard about the death of Ryu's master to antagonize him. Bison senses a strange reaction in Ryu and realizes that Ryu's peaceful mind has been replaced with a mind preoccupied by murder and death.\n\nBison uses this to his advantage and assures Ryu that he will have the chance to kill all that stand in his way if he joins Shadowloo. Ryu halfheartedly accepts, and Bison decides to test Ryu's will by pitting him against his own friend from childhood, Ken. However, Ken is able to snap Ryu's mind back to his old self. Bison is disappointed that the effect did not last, and decides to kill them both at once. Ken and Ryu fight back and defeat Bison. He sees a member of the US Air Force and an interpol agent enter the room at that time, and he hits a button that allows him to escape through a sinkhole in the floor.\n\nMonths later, Bison is surprised to hear from Sagat that another EX tournament is being held, and even more surprised to find out that Sagat insists on being allowed to rematch Ryu. Bison, furious that someone dared to usurp control of his tournament away from him, sends Cracker Jack and Vega to investigate the circumstances surrounding the tournament. He discovers that a tyrant going by the name Shadowgeist has arranged the tournament. Vega intends to put an end to it. Along the way, he learns of another fighter similar to Ryu who seems to be in the same altered state of mind. Before approaching him, Sagat yet again pleads for a chance for a rematch with Ryu. Bison consents to prevent Sagat from annoying him any further and advances to meet Kairi. Just as he was about to engage Kairi in a fight, he was knocked out by an attack from a being that he could not sense. He lost consciousness briefly, but when he awoke, he saw Kairi fighting against a rather demonic looking being.\n\nOutraged by the being's audacity to interrupt Bison's fight, he used the Psycho Crusher attack on Garuda, and prevented Garuda from completing his fight with Kairi. They fought for some time, and Garuda executed the Soukon Dan attack on Bison. Rather than harming Bison, the souls joined with him and enhanced his Psycho Power. Garuda, not understanding what happened, fled the arena. When Bison looked around, Kairi was gone. At that moment, Chun-Li rushed in. Passionate about the chance to avenge her father's death at Bison's hands, she rushed in to attack. But Bison, in his enhanced state, was far more powerful than Chun-Li anticipated, and she was nearly killed as a consequence. When Bison was informed that Shadow Geist was getting away, he left Chun-Li to her fate and walked away.\n\nStill bent on finding new soldiers for his army, he declares the third EX tournament and changes the rules so that all fighters must enter with a partner. He does this in order to use Vega as a spy while at the same time, making it appear that Vega is simply his partner. He knows that Shadow Geist will be unable to refuse the opportunity to return, and he eagerly awaits the chance to punish Geist once and for all.\n\nEndings\n\nStreet Fighter EX Plus α\n\n\"Mwhahahaha!\" Justice has been vanquished the moment his evil laughter began to be heard. Everyone who bore presence to him trembled before his Psycho Power. The Demon Bison, is there anyone out there who can stop him?\"\n\nStreet Fighter EX2 Plus\n\n\"Hawhahaha. Such worthy experimental materials we got here.\"\n\n\"With my Psycho Power abilities, I can create a strange power with SH-11... Hehheh, the new Shadaloo has been born!\"\n\nStreet Fighter EX3\n\nWith his goal now completed, the Grand Master M. Bison went into the energy amplifier located in the basement. Stepping into the machine he feels its awesome power and yells, \"Yes!!... I can feel it... the power is pouring into all my vessels and cells...\" With his muscles and blood vessels bulging to new extremes he shouts, \"I didn't expect the energy of such pitiful losers could ever create such intense power!\" Finally, M. Bison's eyes turn red, smiling, he proclaims, \"Now I am ready for the world. I shall revel in its destruction! Wha ha ha ha!\"\n\nStreet Fighter EX3 (in team with Vega)\n\nM. Bison sighed on his throne, \"I thought they would be much stronger... What a disappointment!\" Vega, who was standing beside him, said calmly, \"They are so weak that they could not have been a match for us.\" The room resounds with Vega's unearthly laugh, as M. Bison taunts, \"So, you say you can be a good match for me? You could cut my head off in an unguarded moment.\" Vega licks his claw and says, \"An unguarded moment? Hee Hee Hee... I'll claw you to the death beautifully and quickly... at any moment.\"\n\nCrossover appearances\n\nCapcom Fighting Evolution\n\nIn Capcom Fighting Evolution, M. Bison's ending shows him fighting and defeating Gill, with the other Four Kings of Shadaloo and the twelve Dolls watching. However, as M. Bison and his followers leave on Shadaloo's plane, Gill performs his resurrection technique, looking completely unscathed from the recent fight.\n\nMarvel vs. Capcom series\n\nX-Men vs. Street Fighter\n\nIn this game, M. Bison teams up with Magneto in pursuit of world domination, opposing Apocalypse. However, M. Bison's ending shows him defeating Magneto, intending to betray the mutant from the very start.\n\nMagneto's ending shows that M. Bison has lost the fight. Watching this, the other three Grand Masters (Balrog, Vega and Sagat) side with Magneto, creating the new Four Grand Masters of the Brotherhood of Mutants. Magneto then adapts the rest of M. Bison's technology to use it for mutant supremacy instead.\n\nMarvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter\n\nM. Bison's ending shows him impressed with Apocalypse's technological improvements on Akuma. He uses it to create an enhanced version of Shadow as part of his quest for world conquest.\n\nUltimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3\n\nM. Bison makes a cameo appearance in Dormammu's ending, along with other Capcom villains.\n\nSNK vs. Capcom series\n\nM. Bison has appeared playable in all the fighting games within the SNK vs. Capcom games; The Match of the Millennium, Capcom vs. SNK 1 and 2, and SVC Chaos.\n\nStreet Fighter X Tekken\n\nM. Bison was first leaked through a screenshot in the Xbox Live Arcade, confirming his presence although a previous trailer shows the Shadaloo symbol. In the recent CG trailer, he infiltrates the Mishima Zaibatsu HQ by appearing through a liquid wormhole, and confronts its president Jin Kazama, the son of Kazuya Mishima, challenging him to a fight. In the meantime, his servant Juri takes on Ling Xiaoyu and prevents her from trying to protect Jin. For the most part, M. Bison seems to have the upper hand and uses a Psycho Crusher to try and drive him through the skyview window. However, M. Bison is held back as Jin's Devil Gene takes over.\n\nM. Bison's partnership with Juri is based on his suggestion that, despite their intense dislike for each other, the two are working together towards a common goal involving the mysterious Pandora. The two of them serve as the sub-boss for Tekken side characters; in the sub-boss cutscene, M. Bison appears through a wormhole, being possessed by the Pandora, stating that the player's characters quest has come to an end. M. Bison and Juri's rivals are Jin and Xiayou; if selected in Arcade Mode, Heihachi Mishima and Kuma will appear as their rivals.\n\nIn the rival cutscene, M. Bison tries to deliver a sneak Psycho Powered punch in Heihachi while the latter is meditating. However, Heihachi blocks the punch, and push off M. Bison's fist. Heihachi tries to headbutt M. Bison, but he teleports himself near Juri, starting the battle. Both bosses seem to underestimate each other, as M. Bison mocks Heihachi's age and Heihachi states that M. Bison is boring him.\n\nIn their ending, M. Bison anticipates Juri's betrayal, and both trigger the power of Pandora in an attempt to take the other out.\n\nStreet Fighter × Mega Man\n\nM. Bison is one of the four final bosses of Street Fighter × Mega Man.\n\nProject X Zone 2\n\nM. Bison appears in Project X Zone 2 as a Rival Unit, alongside Juri. Juri is seen working with Bison, although they seem to be on friendlier terms than in Street Fighter X Tekken.\n\nBlood Brothers 2\n\nM. Bison, Ryu, and Chun-Li appear in DeNA’s mobile RPG, Blood Brothers 2.[35]\n\nPower Rangers Legacy Wars\n\nM. Bison features in the updated cinematic of Power Rangers Legacy Wars. He is among the warriors who are captured as Rita Repulsa's grasp on the Morphin Grid stretches across multiverses. Impressed by his strength, Rita reanimates M. Bison who, in return, offers her a new dimension to conquer: his own, leading to Ryu being sucked into the Grid along with his allies and enemies.\n\nAnimations\n\nStreet Fighter II: The Animated Movie\n\nM. Bison is the main antagonist of the 1994 anime film, voiced by Takeshi Kusaka in Japanese and Tom Wyner in English. As in the games, he is the leader of Shadaloo (here named \"Shadowlaw\") and seeks to take control of the world. His primary objective is to locate Ryu, who exhibited spectacular fighting potential during his battle with Sagat and induct him into the organization as his right-hand man.\n\nDuring his search, he comes across Ken, who displays similar fighting potential and is a childhood friend of Ryu. Bison kidnaps and brainwashes Ken, setting him on Ryu while he personally duels Guile, whom he defeats with ease. When Ken breaks free of M. Bison's influence, M. Bison severely injures him and leaves him for dead while taking on Ryu; he toys around with Ryu for a while until Ken recovers and rejoins the battle. Although M. Bison is clearly a superior fighter, he decides to hold back so that he may fight the two 'on their own level'. This decision eventually turns out to be M. Bison's downfall, as Ryu and Ken finally manage to catch him off guard and deliver a combined Hadoken, which apparently obliterates him.\n\nM. Bison, however, reappears alive and well at the film's finale in a truck, attempting to run down Ryu. Ryu notices him just in time and prepares to do battle with him once again.\n\nStreet Fighter 1995 cartoon\n\nThis section is currently incomplete.\n\nPlease assist the Street Fighter Wiki,\n\nand complete the section if you can.\n\nStreet Fighter II V\n\nThis section is currently incomplete.\n\nPlease assist the Street Fighter Wiki,\n\nand complete the section if you can.\n\nIn Street Fighter ll V, Bison's story is largely the same as his game counterpart. He rules Shadaloo with an iron fist, being involved in drug and weapon's smuggling. This is largely done behind the scenes, with Bison having infiltrated many secret agencies with his own agents. His psycho powers are prominently displayed as well, fighting off both Ryu and Ken with numerous psycho crushers, and displaying his teleportation techniques while fighting off Nash. His personality remains much the same as well; sadistic, relishing in bloodlust, treating human life with contempt, and developing a desire to control powerful fighters who display traits he is interested in (Ryu and Ken for their mastery of the Hado energy, and Chun-Li for both her beauty and her fighting talents). The main differences between his gaming counterpart and this one are that his Psycho Powers don't seem to be wholly his own. Bison formed an odd pact with a statue that seems to be telepathically linked to him and provides (or is in some way connected to) Psycho Power. The second difference is that Bison often loses control of his powers and himself if he indulges in too much bloodlust. Be it bloodlust from watching a bloody deathmatch, being wounded in battle, or the thrill of overwhelming an opponent. Much like most of his other incarnations, this Bison ends up being defeated by Ryu (and to a degree Ken as well).\n\nLive-action media\n\nMovies\n\nStreet Fighter: The Movie\n\n\"For you, the day Bison graced your village was the most important day of your life. But for me, it was Tuesday.\"\n\n—M. Bison to Chun-Li in the Street Fighter movie\n\nM. Bison appears in the 1994 live-action movie as the main antagonist, portrayed by Raúl Juliá. In the film, Shadaloo is a small backwards nation in Asia, as opposed to an organization of unknown origin. Here, Bison is both an English megalomaniacal former military general and a notorious wealthy drug kingpin who controls both Shadaloo and the whole narcotics industry with an iron fist. One of his goals in the film is to produce supersoldiers as per his plan for world domination and establish a new order known as \"Pax Bisonica\" using his drug money. His ambitions have led to a war with the Allied Nations (AN), led by Colonel Guile, the movie's main character, in Shadaloo. He is shown as an ordinary human for most of the movie until his final confrontation with Guile, where he is granted lightning powers and the ability to fly, both provided through his tech suit and life support system. However, M. Bison is defeated by Guile and is buried after he hits his gigantic monitor, which violently explodes as the Colonel discovers that the dictator is defenseless while flying towards him. After the end credits, Bison's hand smashes through the rubble of his base, showing that he survived.\n\nAlthough Bison's nationality is not stated in the film, his British accent, as well as his plans to conquer England before going after other countries, suggests that he may be of English descent. The film was Raúl Juliá's final film role before his death shortly and is dedicated to his memory. Although the film was largely panned by critics and fans, Juliá's performance was widely praised and he was nominated for a posthumous Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor. Despite being known as \"Vega\" in the Japanese versions of the games, he is still called \"M. Bison\" in the Japanese dub of the live-action film.\n\nFor the role, Raúl Juliá studied the lives and personalities of various real-life dictators and drug lords such as Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolino, Joseph Stalin, Pablo Escobar, Fidel Castro, Muammar Gaddafi, Idi Amin, and Saddam Hussein. The most notable elements which have been incorporated in Julia's interpretation are as follows: Benito Mussolini's hand gestures, Joseph Stalin's strict demeanor, Adolf Hitler's love and passion for fine art, and Pablo Escobar's elusiveness.\n\nStreet Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li\n\nM. Bison appears in this movie as the main antagonist and is portrayed by Neal McDonough. Here, M. Bison dons a stereotypical business suit and is presented as a multi-lingual crime boss under the guise of a Bangkok-based Irish businessperson.\n\nBeing from Ireland, M. Bison was abandoned by his Irish missionary parents in Thailand. \"Shadoloo\" (as it is referred to) is a multi-leveled criminal syndicate comprised of a plutarchy of an unknown number of powerful crime families that have connections ranging from the country's local mafiosos to even factions of the government (in the film's current case, the Department of Commerce). Though M. Bison's full goals are not divulged, his first order of business is to buy up an entire waterfront district and restructure it specifically for the wealthy and elite, thus further adding to the funding of his operations. He first appears as a simple mob head, only to skyrocket through the ranks after killing off a number of allied families and usurping their power for himself. He is depicted as being uncomfortably upbeat about everything, as he usually reveals shortly afterward that he is in control of almost every element of espionage and intrigue he is involved with.\n\nIn this story, M. Bison has a more supernatural background than there was with his video game and anime counterparts. In a backstory told by Gen, M. Bison sacrificed his pregnant wife in the bowels of a mystic cave, where he imbued his daughter, Rose, with the goodness of his soul, thus ridding himself of any sense of conscience. His raw physical power is seen to borderline on unearthly, as he usually only required one punch or kick to send an opponent hurtling through the air. His power is first exhibited during his introduction, where his spiritual energy was so immense it heralded his arrival by a soft breeze inside Chun-Li's family manor. He is killed at the end of the film in front of his daughter when Chun-Li twists his head around by use of her legs. It is unknown whether or not M. Bison's powers will resurrect him, however, in a deleted scene where Nash is comforting Rose, her eyes glow with a deep red, indicating that Bison's soul took possession of Rose's body in order to return to the living world.\n\nThe Neal McDonough portrayal of Bison as well as the depiction of Shadaloo is loosely based on many real-life crime bosses and their mafia organizations, the most notable being that of Al Capone, John Gotti, and Gregory Scarpa.\n\nPower Rangers Legacy Wars - Street Fighter Showdown\n\nKevin Porter played M. Bison in Power Rangers: Legacy Wars - Street Fighter Showdown.\n\nTV series\n\nStreet Fighter: Resurrection\n\nM. Bison appears in the final episode observing Ryu, Ken, Laura and Nash through a battered Decapre's eyes and sits down on his throne behind a massive spherical object before burning a chess piece with his Psycho Power and proclaiming that he shall let them come.\n\nComics\n\nStreet Fighter II manga\n\nThis section is currently incomplete.\n\nPlease assist the Street Fighter Wiki,\n\nand complete the section if you can.\n\nBison appears in all the volumes as his company was responsible for Cho's and Chun-Li's father's murder, he and his henchman had traveled to Japan after finding out that Cho had stolen Shadaloo secrets, they ended up destroying the temple that Cho went in, kidnapping Ken, and taking out Cho and Gouken.\n\nRyu was the only person who managed to escape Shadaloo's attack. At some point Bison found Ken to be useful to him, so he had Ken brainwashed for his sinister plains. He hosts a tournament on the island of Shad in order to have more people under his control through brainwashing.\n\nBison sends Ken out to take out Ryu and has Chun-Li out to be killed due to her connection to Interpol. He is followed by Ken after finding out that Bison was responsible for Cho being murdered and brainwashing him into being a mindless puppet for Shadaloo, Ryu finds Ken and tells him that he will defeat Bison for all the evil that he has cause to others.\n\nBison uses his Psycho Power to mind control Ken to destroy Ryu. As they fight, Ken was able to break free of Bison's mind control over him after his hand breaks by hitting a wall, and he tells Ryu to defeat Bison to avenge Cho and the countless other that were murdered by Shadaloo, Bison then fights Ryu in an intense battle as Ryu was able to defeat him with a Shin Shoryuken.\n\nStreet Fighter Alpha manga\n\nBison makes a cameo appearance in the first volume of the manga as he was pulling all the strings behind many kidnappings throughout the world.\n\nStreet Fighter III: Ryu Final\n\nAlthough Bison is not seen in the story, he is mentioned by Ryu.\n\nUDON comics\n\nThis article may or may not be a stub, but it's definitely missing something.\n\nSpecifically: Some spelling and grammar fix.\n\nYou can help the Street Fighter Wiki by giving us what we need.\n\nIn UDON's Street Fighter series, M. Bison had a battle against his master as she poses a threat to his plans of world conquest. Afterwards, he murders everybody in her village, and Rose was the only one who lived, due to the positive aspects of Soul Power inside her.\n\nShadaloo had become well known to the world as the years went by as M. Bison murdered Juri's parents. At some point, he had his men create clone bodies as a backup plan in case anything should go wrong, as well as an army of bio androids that can copy any kind of data for Shadaloo.\n\nHe also had Shadaloo kidnap young girls and brainwash them with Psycho Power. In his quest of absolute power to control the world, he had the Dolls perform evil deeds, such as having Chun-Li's father murdered, murdering innocent people, and even kidnapping cops, marines, and soldiers from the United States military and Japan.\n\nHe captures Charlie who tries to save a cop that works for Interpol and experiments on him (thinking he could be of use to him) and had him go kill Chun-Li. After he goes after the power inside Ryu after seeing the Satsui no Hado awaken, he loses control over Charlie and loses his contact with Killer Bee. He then decided that he would murder Charlie, Guile, and Chun-Li personally.\n\nAs he found them, he incapacitates Chun Li and Guile without even having to resort to his Psycho Power. He then fights Charlie, who is fueled with M. Bison's Psycho Power (thus making him much more of a challenge than Guile and Chun-Li) and mortally wounds him; a weakened Charlie, however, manages to destroy the cliff on which they were fighting, throwing M. Bison into an abyss. Later on, his Psycho Power goes into a different body and discovers that Killer Bee (now known as Cammy) has broken free of his control, and plains to bring her back, as Shadaloo found her, he takes out T. Hawk, Cammy and Rose using only a portion of his vast powers.\n\nIn the World Warrior tournament, as he faces Ryu, he faces Akuma. M. Bison then unleashes his full power and, in order to counter, so does Akuma. However, neither of them manage to gain the upper hand until the Psycho Drive is destroyed by Delta Red. This renders M. Bison weak, allowing Akuma to finally finish him off. Rose's spirit immobilizes him as Akuma delivers a Shun Goku Satsu and leaves M. Bison's current body for dead as the island sinks into the sea.\n\nAlthough M. Bison seemingly reappears in UDON's Super Street Fighter: New Generations and Super Street Fighter Volume 2: Hyper Fighting comics (which are based around the events of the Street Fighter III, Super Street Fighter IV and Street Fighter V) that actually turns out to be Twelve taking the form of the leader of Shadaloo. However, a figure of what could be the real Bison appears in a secret Shadaloo base (in hiding) and is told that Chun-Li has been captured by Vega but ends up escaping.\n\nDuring the Street Fighter Legends: Cammy story, it was revealed that Bison had done more than just simply brainwash the Dolls. He had imbued some of his Psycho Power within each and every one of them, even in Abel and his prize doll Cammy (whom he called \"Killer Bee\"), should he ever need to control them or possess their body in case anything should go wrong.\n\nAt some point, he called to his henchman Balrog and Vega after doing some sort of dealing with Gill of the Secret Society and the boss of the Mad Gear Gang, as he plans to bring Shadaloo back to power in his quest for world domination. While Bison does not make an appearance in Street Fighter vs. Darkstalkers, he is referenced by Chun-Li during her talk with Felicia.\n\nArchie Comics' Worlds Unite\n\nBison makes an appearance in Archie's Mega Man/Sonic The Hedgehog story arc of Worlds Collide as he finds out that a robot from another world named Sigma seeks to rule over the world after finding out the information from a Reploid who was sent by him to set up a Unity Engine, seeing this to be a problem as nobody else but him should be the only one to rule the world, Bison destroys the Reploid, stating that Sigma has earned the attention of Shadaloo.\n\nHe and his men come across Ryu, Ken, Guile and Chun-Li as he tells that Sigma has made a mistake for trying to take over the world, he tells them that Shadaloo will be at their side to fight against Sigma and his robot army, he is eventually overpowered by Sigma, but was defeated by Sonic and Mega Man in their Super forms. After the battle, the portals that leads everyone back to their home worlds was beginning to fade into nothingness, as not even Bison could not keep a single one of the portals open. The collapse of reality was put to a stop, thanks to Xander Payne's plan of stopping the virus form of Sigma in another timeline through a Genesis Portal, everybody returned home to their own worlds, as nobody remembers the events of Sigma's plan to rule other worlds.\n\nStreet Fighter × G.I. Joe\n\nBison is one of the main villains in Street Fighter x G.I. Joe along with King Cobra of the G.I. Joe franchise. The two have allied against their common enemy, the United States government, to stop their interference with the duo's plans for world domination; M. Bison operates in the open alongside Cobra's minions, while King Cobra himself works in the shadows.\n\nDrama CD's\n\nStreet Fighter ZERO3 Drama Album\n\nThe story starts with M. Bison watching past footage of Ryu fighting Sagat. M. Bison then tells Vega to bring Ryu to him. Vega kidnaps Sakura and uses her as bait to bring Ryu to M. Bison.[36] By the end of the Drama CD Ryu defeats M. Bison with a Shinku Hadoken, then the Psycho Drive located underneath M. Bison’s castle self-destructs. M. Bison’s whereabouts after said explosion is unknown.\n\nOther media\n\nStreet Fighter: The Storytelling Game\n\nIn the role-playing game from White Wolf, M. Bison gained psychic powers from an alien meteor. Based on these powers, he created his own fighting style, which he calls Ler Drit.[37]\n\nGameplay\n\nFighting style\n\nIn the games, M. Bison fights with a self-taught style using the Psycho Power. In the non-canonical Street Fighter: The Storytelling Game, M. Bison is said to use the martial art developed and taught by himself, Lerdrit. Though in reality, Lerdrit is actually a Thai form of martial arts taught and used by the Royal Thai Army. It should be noted however that while M. Bison's fighting style in the games is original, it may borrow elements from Lerdrit.\n\nMoveset\n\nIn the games, M. Bison wields his deadly Psycho Power to great effect; he is known for his trademark Psycho Crusher, which sends him flying in the direction of his opponent with a damaging \"torpedo\" spin. The Double Knee Press (or Scissors Kick) allows him to do a forward flip which will knock the opponent away. With the Head Press, M. Bison jumps into the air and homes onto the opponent, bouncing off their heads, he can follow up and smack them with a diving hand thrust called the Somersault Skull Diver. M. Bison also possess the Devil Reverse, wherein he leaps forward like the Head Press, but then flips upside down and chops the enemy with a Psycho Power-charged hand when any punch button is pressed. This acts as both a fake-out version of the Head Press and as a viable attack, fittingly allowing M. Bison to play with his opponent's head.\n\nIn the Alpha series, his Psycho Crusher is a Super Combo (on A-ISM or Z-ISM) instead of a regular move. He also gained a couple of new moves, such as the Psycho Shot and the ability to teleport and hover in the air.\n\nIn Street Fighter V, M. Bison has a more aggressive play style than before with air juggles and on/off-the-ground attacks, his crouching Heavy Kick (sweep) knocks opponents into the air and his Head Press can now hit grounded and airborne opponents. M. Bison gains the Psycho Reflect, the move reflects projectiles back at the opponent similar to Rose's Soul Reflect. M. Bison gains Psycho Blast and Psycho Inferno. M. Bison's teleport is incredibly fast where he can teleport just before a project hits unscathed with little recovery time. His EX Scissor Kick now hits multiple times. M. Bison's V-Trigger allows him to warp from the air to the ground and perform a psycho-infused Head Stomp twice.\n\nIn Street Fighter 6, Bison's Psycho Power has become more powerful and retains his aggressive gameplay. His Psycho Charge from Street Fighter V returns as the Psycho Mine, being his new main gimmick. Scissors Kick is retooled as a quarter circle motion, and both Head Press, Somersault Skull Diver & Devil Reverse united into the Shadow Rise. Backfist Combo is a excellent pressure tool. Some OD moves, like Devil Reverse, Backfist Combo & Psycho Crusher, with the Psycho Mine set on the foe, explodes, allowing for more juggle options, the latter even resembling the EX Psycho Crusher Omega from OMEGA Mode from Street Fighter IV.\n\nSuper Combos\n\nHis Super Combos include the Final Psycho Crusher (ファイナルサイコクラッシャー, Fainaru Saiko Kurasshā) - which is his most powerful attack in Street Fighter Alpha 3, exclusive to his Shadaloo-ISM form, which takes up the whole screen when used - and the Knee Press Nightmare, which is a super version of the Double Knee Press. In Street Fighter IV, he gains the Nightmare Booster Ultra Combo, which is a combination of all of his special moves (two Double Knee Presses, followed by a Psycho Crusher which carries the victim upward, after which he flips upside down similar to the Devil Reverse, smacks the victim to the ground, and ends it with a full-body version of the Head Press). From Super Street Fighter IV onward his second Ultra, Psycho Punisher, sees Bison jump up into the air and deliver a falling stomp with both feet and if the opponent is caught in the stomp's shockwave Bison grabs them by the face and lifts them off their feet, then drives his other fist into their stomach and fires a blast of psycho power into their abdomen.\n\nIn Street Fighter V, Bison's Critical Art appears to be the Ultimate Psycho Crusher with elements mixed from Street Fighter II V. Upon activating his Critical Art, he releases a large barrier of Psycho Power around him. Anyone hit within the blast, is knocked into the air where Bison is flying while charging up with one hand his Psycho Power and then charging with both hands, then finally performing his signature attack in one hit against his opponent into the wall.\n\nIn Street Fighter 6, his Level 1 Super Art is his Knee Press Nightmare and it became slower during execution and his Level 2 Super Art is his Psycho Punisher. His Level 3 Super Art is the Unlimited Psycho Crusher, a new move where the last blow crushes his opponent with a downward punch embedded with Psycho Power after hit and driving his opponent on airborne with his Psycho Crusher.\n\nAs a Final/Hidden Boss\n\nA more powerful form of M. Bison with stronger abilities and fewer weaknesses appears as the final boss of Street Fighter Alpha 3 for every character except Evil Ryu, who fights Shin Akuma, and M. Bison himself. Should the player lose and not continue, an edited version of M. Bison's ending will play, and the game will end. Unlike Akuma's Shin form, this version of M. Bison has no official name and looks identical to the regular version.\n\nThere are some minor differences with this form aside from damage output. His fierce punch attacks send out a wave of energy and his Psycho Crusher Super Combo fills the whole screen with a devastating streak of blue flames. This improved Psycho Crusher is much faster and stronger than its normal counterpart, cannot be blocked in the air, and inflicts severe damage even when blocked; it is the most powerful move in the game. He also has a different theme song, called \"Brave or Grave\".\n\nThe player is also able to choose this version of M. Bison as a 4th ISM, dubbed Shadaloo-ISM (or S-ISM), in the console versions of Street Fighter Alpha 3, by choosing Bison with the select button.\n\nHe also has other forms that appeared in both Street Fighter EX2 Plus (Bison II or Vega II (ベガII, Bega Tsū?), and Street Fighter EX3 as a secret computer-only boss character (Shin-Bison or True Vega (トゥルーベガ, Turū Bega?)). Bison II appears in a black uniform while in Street Fighter EX 3 only, Shin-Bison appears with pale, indigo-tinted skin and a white uniform. In both of these games, these forms have an infinite amount of SC energy. They also tends to be far more aggressive and makes frequent use of his teleporting ability.\n\nSubpages\n\nPopular Culture\n\nM. Bison/Pop Culture\n\nQuotes\n\nM. Bison/Quotes\n\nGallery\n\nM.

Bison's unlockable character profile in Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 1, M. Bison's height is 6 ft 2 in, the same height as his 1994 live-action actor Raul Julia.\n\nM. Bison's official height in the Street Fighter II games is 5 ft 11 in.\n\nBison was the first character in the series to have a unique intro animation; in the Street Fighter II games, he removed his cape before being fought as the final boss. Beginning with Street Fighter Alpha, unique intro animations would be the norm for the fighting game series in general.\n\nM. Bison is speculated to have originated from Thailand, as in his debut game, he was fought in that country. However, his true birthplace remains officially unconfirmed by Capcom themselves.\n\nThough M. Bison's nationality is unknown in the original games, he is British in the 1994 live-action film, Irish in Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li and is based on two manga antagonists who are Japanese dictators.\n\nIn Street Fighter Alpha 3 he refers to himself by the full title of Master Bison (\"Vega-sama\" in the Japanese version), with Cammy and the Dolls referring to him in the same way as well.[38] Despite M. Bison's followers (and himself) referring to him as \"Master Bison\" in Street Fighter Alpha 3, he is named \"Lord Bison\" in his Arcade mode introduction sequence in Street Fighter IV.\n\nIn Street Fighter II: The World Warrior, M. Bison's win quote (\"Get lose! You can't compare with my powers!\") is clearly misspelled/mistranslated. This line later got corrected in Champion Edition and subsequent SFII versions (\"Get lost! You can't compare with my powers!\").\n\nIn Street Fighter II': Hyper Fighting, M. Bison is the only character to still use his first color palette as the default, selected with any attack button. However, he now uses his third palette as the alternate, selected with the Start button. This is reversed for all other characters - the third color is the default; the first color is the alternate.\n\nM. Bison's Japanese voice actor, Norio Wakamoto, is also known for voicing other Capcom video game antagonists, such as High Max from Mega Man X6 and Oda Nobunaga from Sengoku BASARA.\n\nM. Bison was planned to be a playable character alongside Charlie Nash and Ibuki in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, but was dropped due to time constraints.[39]\n\nHis kick throw and extended animations for his Knee Press Nightmare all came from his Street Fighter EX appearances, and was first adopted in his Capcom vs. SNK appearance. He did not have a kick-based throw previously.\n\nDuring some character story battles in Street Fighter V, he has dark brown hair instead of white hair, implying that some parts of his storyline happened (some time during or before the events of A Shadow Falls) before his hair whitened.\n\nIn the beginning of his arcade story in Street Fighter 6, it pays a homage to the T-800 in the 1984 film, The Terminator where it was confronted by three thugs which he brutally beats them and tells one of them to give him clothes. However the setting was in the street alleyway where Kyle Reese was transported in the time of 1984, naked before setting his mission to rescue Sarah Connor from getting assassinated by the T-800.\n\nBison on horseback is likely inspired by his film depiction, and Raoh from Fist of the North Star, who also rode a horse in certain scenarios; both men are villains/antagonists in their own series.\n\nIn Street Fighter 6, M. Bison is the only character to have separate winning animations, losing animations, idle animations, and taunt animations because of his scarred Right Arm.\n\nM. Bison's horse Rosinante takes his name from the two-part Spanish novel Don Quixote, being the title character's steed. Rosinante is described as a malnourished, aged workhorse on a quest well beyond his capabilities, a similar state to M. Bison's horse upon their meeting.\n\nRosinante has a tag that reads 1994 on it, the same year the film Street Fighter was released, which also showed an image of M. Bison riding a horse.\n\nSee also\n\nM. Bison's moves in the Street Fighter II series\n\nM. Bison's moves in Super Street Fighter II Turbo: HD Remix\n\nM.
