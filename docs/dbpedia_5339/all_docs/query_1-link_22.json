        "text": "Our next HB Intern Spotlight will focus on Gabe Kamins. A Film Analyst/Player Evaluation Intern from The University of Wisconsin-Madison. Gabe aims to combine his passions for marketing, branding, and sports to make a positive impact in the business world. We asked Gabe to share some insight on his time with Hoop Brothers. What are some of the tasks and projects you're responsible for as apart of that role? \"Analyzing film on middle school and high school basketball players, creating player evaluation reports, collaborating with fellow interns on various projects, and conducting research on individual players and teams with the goal of identifying viable partnerships.\" Explain what you have enjoyed most about the internship with Hoop Brothers. \"I have greatly enjoyed the family element of Hoop Brothers. Everybody cares about each other and shares the same goal of turning Hoop Brothers into a powerhouse sports media company!\" What is one piece of advice you would give a new intern joining Hoop Brothers team ? \"Don't be afraid to ask for help, whether that be asking a fellow intern or a manager. Everyone is very accessible and wants to help you succeed!\"\n\nThis is an oldie, but a goodie. Nihilistic Security Questions For Password Resets (tip of the hat to Larry Rosen) What is the name of your least favorite child? In what year did you abandon your dreams? What is the maiden name of your father‚Äôs mistress? At what age did your childhood pet run away? What was the name of your favorite unpaid internship? In what city did you first experience ennui? What is your ex-wife‚Äôs newest last name? What sports team do you fetishize to avoid meaningful discussion with others? What is the name of your favorite canceled TV show? What was the middle name of your first rebound? On what street did you lose your childlike sense of wonder? When did you stop trying?\n\nMeet Lillie Davidson '25, who‚Äôs spending her summer as a news intern at the Fort Worth Star-Telegram! Read more about Lillie‚Äôs internship journey below!üëá 1. What's a typical day like for you as a news intern? I get to the office around 8:45 in the morning, and we have a newsroom meeting first thing to get us all in the right headspace for the day. We give each other shoutouts for good work we‚Äôve seen from the last day. Then, I get started on assignments! Sometimes this looks like going to press conferences or different places around the metroplex, sometimes it‚Äôs emails and phone calls, but it‚Äôs never ever boring! Usually, on my lunch break, I like to play the New York Times‚Äô crossword. I can finish a Monday puzzle in five minutes! 2. What do you enjoy most about your internship at the Star-Telegram? I love getting to work with so many kind and inspiring people who are so willing to teach me everything they know and answer all my questions. I also love getting to see things and go places that most people don‚Äôt get to. Last week I got a sneak peek at the MLB All-Star Village before it opened to the public! Plus, I enjoy seeing my name in the newspaper! 3. Do you have any advice for other students considering an internship in this field? Be brave! Ask big questions and look for stories in places you wouldn‚Äôt think to find them. Go everywhere with the intention to listen and watch, and remember that most people just want an opportunity to be heard. Most importantly, have fun. This field is special and can bring you a lot of joy if you let it. #LeadOnTCU\n\nI just wanted to share a little bit about what I've been up to this summer and update you all on my internship as it comes to a close! If you don't have 6 minutes to spare, I‚Äôll give you the highlights: 1. It's not what you know, it's who you know. And not in the cliche generic way‚Ä¶ it really is WHO you know that gets you where you need to be to show WHAT you know. Don't shy away from transactional professional relationships. That's really how people advance in business. 2. Put your yes on the table and leave it there. Someone is always watching, people notice attributes like willingness, tenacity, and work ethic. It really never goes unrewarded. 3. Ask ‚Äúdumb‚Äù questions. Get all the information you need to do the job well, even if its intimidating. Even if you've asked that question twice already. Ask.
