        "text": "Vegan eggs haven’t really taken off. Not yet, anyway. Everyone’s been far more interested in bleeding burger patties and plant-based salmon.\n\nThat’s not to say people haven’t been trying: Silicon Valley food startup Just Inc. spent six years developing Just Egg, a pre-bottled mixture made for scrambling. It’s made from mung beans, canola oil and other less decipherable ingredients and launches in the UK later this year.\n\nIn Brazil, a firm called Grupo Mantiqueira has created a product called N.Ovo. Its packaging looks the part – a classic carton carrying a half dozen. Except golden treasure inside isn’t hid. Rather, you’ll find packets of powder made from pea starch and plant protein.\n\nGrowing vegan menu\n\nPlant-based eggs might mix well and even emulsify a little. Some are on their way to tasting a bit like their animal-born counterparts. But they do not begin in an oval fashion, where a white casing envelopes a pool of liquid gold.\n\nEnter Wagamama, Britain’s Pan Asian high street staple best known for democratising ramen and bringing teriyaki soba to the mainstream. It might be a “glorified Pot Noodle” to some, but it’s been bucking the casual dining crunch so comfortably that it’s had time to develop a vegan boiled egg (half).\n\nBut hold on. If a multi-million pound Californian tech company can only muster bottles of mung beans, is it really in Wagamama’s armoury to forge a formed half egg, white and yolk and all?\n\nAs I tucked into one on Tuesday, I realised the answer was absolutely not. Wagamama has laid what looks like an egg, what will Instagram (a verb now I’m afraid) as an egg, but is comprehensively not an egg. It’s a wobbly panna cotta with Sriracha vegan mayo dolloped into a melon-balled cavity.\n\nI encounter the panna cotta nesting on top of brown rice and joined by assorted vegetables and BBQ glazed seitan (a vegan meat substitute). It’s made from coconut milk, cornflour, and miso, and offers the texture of a boiled egg but its flavour is totally tropical.\n\nWagamama worked with vegan Instagram star Gaz Oakley to devise the dish. He had near free-rein in the kitchen and came up with “Avant-garde’n”, one of three new dishes launching on Wednesday.\n\n“This is not so much a substitute for an egg but looks the part and has a similar consistency,” says Oakley. “Most importantly, it has an incredible flavour that compliments the dish perfectly”.\n\n‘Innovative and interesting’\n\nAdmirably, Wagamama has had an entirely standalone plant-based menu for two years. The mushroom and aubergine panko bao, and the “vegatsu”, a seitan version of the restaurant’s top-selling katsu curry, perform well, and for good reason: they’re solid.\n\nWhich goes some way to explaining why Wagamama is confident enough to produce a coconut panna cotta, cover it in spicy plant-based mayonnaise, and call it an egg.\n\n“We know this doesn’t taste like an egg,” Ollie Payne, head of brand at the company, tells i. “The texture is not dissimilar [he is right], but this really is just a bit of fun.\n\n“We just like it when people talk about food. We want to be innovative and interesting. It’s a talking point, more so thanks to Gaz [Oakley].\n\n“The first thing we think about when we develop new dishes is the taste, and at our test site in Soho, customer feedback has been really positive. We wouldn’t have put it on the menu otherwise.”\n\nMr Payne says Wagamama’s sales have been exceeding expectations. He thinks dishes like Avant-garde’n have helped the chain stay relevant in a tough climate: “We’re not afraid to try different things and customers clearly recognise that.”\n\nWhen it comes to vegan cookery, aquafaba is most commonly deployed when the white of an egg is required. The gelatinous, watery run-off from beans bolsters and binds in much the same way.\n\nA vegan yolk is a harder sell. How on earth might environmentalists replicate that golden, protein-rich flavour with a beans and olive oil? There’s a mystical viscosity to yolks: one minute, a sauce; the next, congealed blobs of intensity.\n\nMaybe a vegan boiled egg is, at least for now, impossible, which is why Wagamama has gone rogue."
