        "text": "What was the point of the nudity in Animal ...and Bad Newz?\n\nShe can't win against Sharvari???? Who doesn't have a hot image yet..and hasn't given a big hit?\n\nRashmika is the one who is buzzing today\n\nOriginally posted by: Shaitan-Haiwan\n\nYou mean HAS right ?\n\nMunjya?You are right .\n\nWell,it is not Animal,Jawan,Kalki-where you get 10 times more eyeball and visibility.\n\nI just read that Kiara is doing her next with Shahid.Kabir Singh had higher footfalls than Animal .It released quietly and for some reason EVERYONE watched it..\n\nI just found out that Rashmika is doing several films,Many female stars are busy, quietly going about their work and releasing films.Everybody has had success recently. Producers ,directors are signing them.\n\nWe may not get the Sri-Mads-Juhi-Divya Bharti era , Rani-Karishma-Urmila-Kajol-Preity era or Aish-Kat-Bebo-PC-DP era- They were like oxygen for our superstars.\n\nWe need heroines..and we can hope.\n\nTripti has a prettier face but till now I haven't liked her commercial work. I didn't like her in Animal and this Bad newz. I want to see Tripti of Laila Majnu. So gorgeous.\n\nTripti can't dance whereas Sharvari is a really good dancer. Sharvari in Taras was Hot!!!! Whereas Tripti in Tauba Tauba was not so noticeable. So voted for Sharvari. She has potential to be the next big thing."
