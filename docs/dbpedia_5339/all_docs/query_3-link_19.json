        "text": "Donald Trump falsely questioned Kamala Harris' race during an appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists in Chicago that quickly turned hostile on Wednesday.\n\nThe Republican former president was invited to participate in a Q&A session with a panel of political journalists at the Hilton Hotel.\n\nThe session started an hour late, and it was kicked off with criticism by ABC News senior congressional correspondent, Rachel Scott, one of the moderators.\n\nTrump claimed that Harris, the first Black woman and Asian American to serve as vice president, had in the past only promoted her Indian heritage.\n\n\"I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black. So, I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?\" Trump said while addressing the group's annual convention.\n\n\"She has always identified as a Black woman,\" Scott responded as Trump continued to confirm that he felt Harris \"could be\" a \"DEI hire.\"\n\nAs an undergraduate, Harris attended Howard University, one of the nation’s most prominent historically Black colleges and universities, where she also pledged the historically Black sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha. As a U.S. senator, Harris was a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, supporting her colleagues’ legislation aimed at strengthening voting rights and reform policing.\n\nTrump on ‘Black jobs’\n\nThe presidential nominee also claimed that immigrants in the country illegally are \"taking Black jobs.\" When pushed by Scott on what constituted a \"Black job,\" Trump responded by saying it was \"any job,\" drawing groans from the room.\n\nAt one point, he said, \"I have been the best president for the Black population since Abraham Lincoln.\"\n\nThe audience responded with a mix of boos and some applause.\n\nTrump on police immunity\n\nTrump was questioned about his support for police immunity in connection with the Sonya Massey murder, a case of great interest to those in Chicago.\n\nMassey, 36, was an unarmed Black woman who was killed inside her Springfield, Illinois home on July 6 after calling 911 for a possible intruder. Sean Grayson, a Sangamon County deputy, is accused of fatally shooting her as she was moving a pot of hot water off of her stove.\n\nThe now-former deputy has been charged with first-degree murder, so Semafor politics reporter Kadia Goba pressed Trump about immunity for Grayson.\n\n\"You said police would get immunity from prosecution if you win. Why should someone like that officer have immunity in your opinion?\" Goba asked.\n\nTrump responded with a lengthy reply as Goba pressed him for more specifics. \"We need to have our police officers have their respect and dignity back. In this particular case, I saw something that didn't look good to me. I didn't like it. I didn't like it at all,\" Trump said.\n\nFULL STORY: Trump weighs in on immunity for Illinois deputy in Sonya Massey murder\n\nTrump on why Black voters should vote for him\n\nWhen asked why Black voters should vote for him, Trump said, \"I love the Black population of this country.\"\n\nHe added: \"I've done so much for the Black population of this country, including, employment, including, opportunity zones with Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, which is one of the greatest programs ever for Black workers and Black entrepreneurs. I've done so much.\"\n\nWhen NABJ announced that Trump would be stopping by the conference, it caused a bit of a stir and even a backlash among many of the journalists in attendance.\n\nHarris is not scheduled to appear at the convention, but the NABJ said in a statement posted on X that it was in conversation with her campaign to have her appear either virtually or in-person for a conversation in September.\n\nTrump posted on his social media network that he was told he could not do the event virtually.\n\n\"She declined, and I am getting ready to land in Chicago in order to be there,\" Trump wrote. \"Now I am told that she is doing the Event on ZOOM. WHAT’S GOING ON HERE?\"\n\nTrump later Wednesday is scheduled to hold a campaign rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania."
