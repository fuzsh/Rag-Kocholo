Over the years, as more and more furs showed up in the metro Atlanta area, the gatherings became larger and larger. The idea of holding a furry convention was raised by several members of the Atlanta furry family, first in 2001 when nothing became of it, and then again in 2003. As a result of several planning sessions held in August of 2003, a concrete plan emerged to hold a convention in February of 2004. The name was chosen echoes that of Anime Weekend Atlanta.\n\nAlthough the convention originally was held around Valentine's Day, often with a similar theme (represented in the conbook and on the con shirt), the con was rescheduled to a mid-March timeframe in 2009.[2] As of April 2024, it is the 3rd largest furry convention.\n\nOrganization[edit]\n\nFurry Weekend Atlanta is produced by Furry Weekend Atlanta, Inc., a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation incorporated in the State of Georgia. Furry Weekend Atlanta Inc., in turn, is headed by an Executive Committee and tasked with operating the yearly convention and promoting the acceptance and appreciation of the anthropomorphic fandom in the Southeast and throughout the country as a whole. As a non-profit corporation, only funds necessary for the continuing operation of the convention are retained; the remaining funds are donated to appropriate charities.\n\nIn addition to operating the convention, Furry Weekend Atlanta, Inc. also maintains Georgia Furs, and works to organize the Georgia furry population for entertainment and service.\n\nFurry Weekend Atlanta became a federally registered trademark on 2 December 2008.[3]\n\nBoard of Directors[edit]\n\nThe current[4] Board of directors of Furry Weekend Atlanta, Inc. consists of:\n\nRanan Fox, Chairman/CEO\n\nTiger Paw\n\nOdin\n\nFeartree\n\nStaff[edit]\n\nAt the end of every convention, Furry Weekend Atlanta showcases its staffing ranks for the next convention season in a meeting held usually following closing ceremonies. Prospective applicants will be able to find out a little about the \"behind the scenes\" work of the convention and will be informed how to fill out the application online.\n\nCharities[edit]\n\nFrom 2005 to 2006, Furry Weekend Atlanta's official charity was the Ellijay Wildlife Rehabilitation Sanctuary.\n\nThe official charity for 2007 through 2013 was Animal Park at the Conservators Center, a nonprofit organization working to reconnect people with wildlife.\n\nOn February 19, 2024, the convention announced that Lost-n-Found Youth would become their new charity partner.[5]\n\nMascots[edit]\n\nFWA's mascots are a fennec fox and a rabbit.[citation needed]\n\nInformation by year[6][edit]\n\nTitle Dates Theme Venue Location Guests of Honor Attendance Charity Amount Notes FWA 2004 February 13-15 — Holiday Inn Atlanta Airport North Atlanta, GA Latin Vixen 270 almost $2000 FWA 2005 February 11-13 — Holiday Inn Atlanta Airport North Atlanta, GA Jessie T.
