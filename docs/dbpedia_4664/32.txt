Released in January 2015, Ex Machina is a British movie directed and written by Alex Garland. In the near future, Caleb is a young programmer who works for the world’s most popular search engine, Bluebook. One day he is chosen to spend the weekend with the CEO in his research facility. In the facility, Caleb meets Nathan (his boss) and learned about his new project. Nathan is a 30 year-old drunk genius who secretly built an artificial intelligence named Ava and asked Caleb to help him run the Turing Test on her. Caleb’s mission is to found out whether Ava thinks/behaves as a human. Sounds simple enough, right?

The movie’s genre is sci-fi thriller and it sure excels in being one. Ex Machina gained advantage with its quick and well-prepared direction with little to none ‘filler’ scenes during its 108 minutes. I also like the futuristic setting where colours of red and grey is dominant. With only one location to wander around, the movie is gripping and claustrophobic at the same time. The movie’s charm, however, falls apart in the last second. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie thoroughly, but I know the ending could be better given the promising buildup.
