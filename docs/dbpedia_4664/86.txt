“Ex Machina” is a stylish and cerebral thriller that follows Caleb Smith (Gleeson), a programmer at an internet-search giant who wins a competition to spend a week at the private mountain estate of the company’s brilliant and reclusive CEO, Nathan Bateman (Isaac). Upon his arrival, Caleb learns that Nathan has chosen him to be the human component in a Turing Test — charging him with evaluating the capabilities, and ultimately the consciousness, of Nathan’s latest experiment in artificial intelligence. That experiment is Ava (Vikander), a breathtaking A.I. whose emotional intelligence proves more sophisticated, seductive–and more deceptive–than the two men could have imagined.

“Alex Garland is already one of the most brilliant and distinctive writers working today. ‘Ex Machina’ marks the beginning of an exciting new step for Alex the director, and we are thrilled to help bring his provocative vision to US audiences,” A24 said in a statement.
