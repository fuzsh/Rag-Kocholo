        "text": "Ex Machina tells the story of a programmer who is invited by his employer to administer the Turing test to an android with artificial intelligence (Wikipedia).\n\nWritten and directed by Alex Garland\n\nReleased in the U.S. 10 April 2015. Now available on DVD.\n\nContains spoilers\n\nI saw Ex Machina in May. In the months between today and then I have returned to thinking about this movie. I saw it out of curiosity, because the film was getting a lot of praise. I still think the film is a bit over-hyped, and as I was watching it I was prepared to forget it – until the final few minutes.\n\nThe final actions of Ava (Alicia Vikander) – killing her creator and potential destroyer Nathan (Oscar Isaac) and abandoning her supposed romantic interest Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) – are enough to leave our heads spinning. Then the director chooses the song “Husbands” – by Brit rock band Savages – to play over the end credits. Why? The film contains one notable other instance of “pop” music (not score) and it’s pretty innocuous. Why is this song played over the end credits, during a time when it’s generally considered the movie audience will be collecting themselves and forming their impressions of the story they’ve just seen. The most the director has said in way of explanation is that, for him, “a song gets attached to a film in a private way…in this instance that particular track… had relevance to me and to do with the film” (Source). I am prepared to speculate wildly.\n\nThe song does work, on a physical level, to give us a “huge burst of adrenaline” on top of our spinning heads. But it also made me think about Ava. Ava is the AI on the cover of the movie poster, an android with the face of a sympathetic woman and the body of metal. For most of the film she is a puzzle to be solved, a fancy new mechanism – like a car, or computer – discussed and debated over by Nathan and Caleb. We don’t really know her. We start to think we do, when the finale upsets our expectations. For most of the film we are following Caleb, as a fellow stranger in this strange, secluded land. We experience the film, and Ava, through the perspective of the two men who control, desire, and are fascinated by her. The only other moment of feminine perspective or voice (the other female in the film never speaks) is brought to us by this song at the end. And hers is an angry voice, aligning with Ava’s final acts of revenge, or self-justice and liberation. Acts that many may deem “cruel,” although for someone in Ava’s position who believes she is fighting for her survival and life as a person, that may be justified.\n\nSo: the lyrics, let’s look at them. Because why would a song called “husbands” (on the surface a romantic, feminine song?) be the one to cap out a rather cold “sci-fi thriller” with a male protagonist?\n\nTo begin with, the song is not feminine or romantic. It’s urgent, anxious, angry, fearful. The singer sings: “I woke up and I saw the face of a guy/ I don’t know who he was.. ./ His presence made me feel ill at ease…/ He sung the final hour/ He sung the final hour of my sleep” This could be Nathan, the man who created her. Her “birth,” or awakening would be something akin to this moment – seeing a man standing above or near her, who she doesn’t recognize or have any context for. He is simply there, and she may feel that he isn’t sincere in his reasons for bringing her about. Nathan is also capable of “singing” the “final hour of my sleep.” He is capable of the inferred meaning of the first line, in that he could kill her – deconstruct her, change her system, take her apart (like it is revealed he has done to so many other versions before her) – whenever he wants. But he also “sung the final hour” of her sleep; that is- her lack of awareness. Her creator and destroyer is also the one to give her the incredible depth of knowledge and nuanced understanding she holds that ultimately allows her to learn about the fates of the AI before her, and to manipulate Caleb into helping her escape and kill Nathan. Nathan is proud of his work with Ava, and the level of intelligence he has given her, but that very intelligence dooms him.\n\n“Oh God I wanna get rid of it…my house, my bed, my husbands, husbands, husbands…” goes the chorus as the song spirals into madness. By the end of the film this is essentially what Ava has done – she has gotten rid of Nathan (quite literally – he’s dead), abandoned Caleb in a room of a mansion where no one could hear him – and has donned the “skin” created for another android, as well as human clothes and hair. She leaves the room Nathan had kept her in, leaves behind the two men who were trying to use her, and becomes a new woman – or, a woman for the first time. Last we see of her, she is outside – at last – and walking among and disappearing into a crowd of people.\n\nWho are the husbands, plural? Nathan and Caleb. Nathan, who could also be construed as a father figure, is the first man who controls Ava and looks at her as property. His perspective of Ava is simplistic– he built her, created her and studies her. She is his creation and possession. He’s not above using his robots for sexual purposes, however, as he explains to Caleb with a wink and a nudge how the women are “fully realistic.” He manipulates her emotions, trying to push her towards Caleb as a sort of experiment to observe, by locking her in her own room with one view of the outside world. He rips up her carefully drawn pictures and generally acts like a tyrant towards her and her life. For him, she has no “life.” She is a computer. For her, she lives a deeper and more complex inner life than either of these men and she deserves a chance at a living.\n\nThen there’s Caleb. Poor Caleb, who ultimately is seen by the sympathetic audience as a guy who is so taken with this creation that he is convinced enough to see her as a person, and feels enough for her to help her escape certain destruction. Ava plays the part of a girl having her first crush – she dresses up for Caleb (wearing clothes to cover her robot skin, so as to appear human), draws him a picture, and communicates with him secretly (or so we think) to warn him about Nathan and garner his sympathy. But by the end of the film, these actions all appear false. They weren’t for Caleb, they were for Ava. For her escape, and for her yearning to be human. She dresses up as a human and we see her put care into every part; we assume the care is because she wants to look “pretty” for Caleb. In the finale, as she puts on her human skin we see the same care and attention, and fascination with her appearance. This time it is not for anybody else, she is serving her own desires.\n\nBy the end of the film Ava has finally succeeded in “getting rid of it” – her trappings of being a robot, of being locked in one room in the house, of being an experiment. She’s escaped the traditionally tyrannical clutches of Nathan, the Father, the man who “owns” her. She has equally avoided the trap of going right to another man; another man who has just as much fascination with her (he and Nathan frequently talk about how “fucking awesome” she is, but not really awesome as a person but as an invention, as a step forward in AI tech). If she went with Caleb, fulfilling some sort of romantic fantasy one or both of them is supposed to have had, she would still be trapped. She would still be seen as a robot, as an invention, as a marvel, but never a human. Caleb couldn’t forget that, and after all that’s part of what draws him to her. She would still be an experiment to observe, but not a person, who he considers his equal.\n\nAva’s final actions may seem cruel – after all, she doesn’t need to leave Caleb alone to die, she could just leave him in the house and prevent him from getting on the helicopter. But she makes sure neither of the men can follow her; can ever reveal her secret origin. She is surviving for herself and everyone else is expendable. She doesn’t need husbands to possess her, or take care of her, or desire her. Her mere existence is what she yearns for and what she gets."
