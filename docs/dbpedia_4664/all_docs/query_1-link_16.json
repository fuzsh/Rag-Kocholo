        "text": "Barack Obama: commander in chief, leader of the free world, and . . . sci-fi nerd?\n\nWe already knew that on top of that whole running-the-country thing, President Obama has temporarily taken on a new responsibility: guest editing the November issue of Wired. The issue will delve into technological “frontiers,” from space exploration to modern medicine, and reveal the way we can work together to make advances in those realms. All of that sounds a little heavy, though—and Obama does deserve to have a little fun in his new temp gig, right? Thus, our nation has been gifted a list of the president’s “essential” sci-fi movies and TV shows.\n\nWhat’s on the docket? Well, basically what you’d expect.\n\nAll of the usual suspects are accounted for on the list: Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, which Obama says “captures the grandeur and scale of the unknown”; Blade Runner, which “asks what it means to be human”; and The Matrix, which Obama says “asks basic questions about our reality—and looks very cool.”\n\nOur commander in chief does not take sides between Star Wars and Star Trek, recommending both—though he does apparently favor A New Hope, which might baffle many fans who will insist until the day they die that The Empire Strikes Back is the true high point of the franchise. His other picks include The Martian, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and Carl Sagan’s Cosmos: A Personal Voyage.\n\nAll of these are good picks, spread out nicely across the annals of sci-fi history. But aren’t they a little obvious? What list wouldn’t include 2001: A Space Odyssey or Star Wars, after all? And, on a more nitpicky note, I can’t help but wonder: Has Barack Obama ever seen Ex Machina?\n\nTo be fair, yes, I understand that the president might have a few things to do before he sits down and watches every sci-fi movie ever made—but Ex Machina got enough buzz last year that he must’ve at least heard of it, right? Somehow, it’s easy to picture Barack and Michelle sitting down on the couch on a Saturday after a long week, as Michelle jokingly tells him to watch his back.\n\nWe’re at least a decade away from knowing whether or not Alex Garland’s unsettling directorial debut will be remembered as “essential” but, to be fair, the same could be said of The Martian—a larger-scale film that Ex Machina more or less matches in review scores on both Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes. (Critic ratings are within two points of one another on both sites.) They’re very different movies, and it seems there should have been room on the list for both.\n\nAdding Ex Machina also would have beefed up the female presence in a list largely dominated by male protagonists. (This is a sci-fi list, after all.) As Ava, Alicia Vikander delivered a stunning performance in a film that subtly foregrounds the relationship between gender and power as it explores more traditional questions about the relationship between humans and A.I. The film’s omission isn’t exactly a crime against humanity, but at a time when the news cycle is dominated by tales of sexism, a film like Ex Machina—in which an A.I. with a female body essentially takes on the patriarchy, vis-à-vis her lecherous creator and fawning examiner—does have a certain appeal.\n\nTelevision\n\nGeorge R.R. Martin Has a New Sci-fi Superhero Show on the Way\n\nThe wait for Winds of Winter probably just got even longer.\n\nWelcome to Earth\n\nSci-Fi Icon Brent Spiner Explains How the Geeks Have Inherited the Earth\n\nAnd how, exactly, Dr. Brackish Okun improbably survived the first Independence Day.\n\nIn Conversation\n\nEx Machina’s Alex Garland Is Sticking with Sci-Fi, and the Oscars Have Taken Notice\n\nThe writer-director, nominated for a best-original-screenplay Oscar, isn’t that unlike the witty scientists at the center of his films.\n\nPolitics\n\nThe Obamas “Couldn’t Be Prouder” to Endorse Kamala Harris for President\n\nPresident Obama and Michelle Obama announced their support in a taped phone call to the vice president.\n\nPolitics\n\nWhere Do the Obamas Stand on Joe Biden? “If President Obama Was All In, He’d Be All In.”\n\nAs the threat of another Trump presidency looms, America turns its eyes to Michelle and Barack Obama, still the most powerful politicians in the world—whether they like it or not.\n\nPolitics\n\nBiden, Allies Are Furious at Democrats Trying to Push Him Out: “They Are Julius Caesar-ing This Man”\n\nThe president is said to feel “personally hurt and betrayed.”\n\nNews\n\nWhat Kamala Harris Means for Democrats’ Chances in Battleground States\n\n“She’s been like a defibrillator to the Democratic Party in this race.”\n\nPolitics\n\nNancy Pelosi Got Joe Biden to Quit. Will She Get Democrats to Rally and Win?\n\nThough the former House Speaker has had a tepid relationship with Harris, she offered a full-throated endorsement on Monday. “My enthusiastic support,” she said, “is official, personal, and political.”\n\nPolitics\n\nThe Democrats’ Revolt May Have Finally Pierced Joe Biden’s Defenses\n\nThe negative numbers, on top of the latest push by Nancy Pelosi, are becoming harder for the president to bat away. “It’s all devastating,” one Bidenworld insider says.\n\nStyle\n\nRadhika Jones on Jenna Ortega’s Rise to Stardom\n\nThe VF editor in chief charts the September cover star’s trajectory from nine-year-old working actor to global name—and now a producer on Wednesday."
