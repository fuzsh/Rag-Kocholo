        "text": "With movie theaters in the New York Tri-State area and Los Angeles closing and total box office reaching previously unheard of lows in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, NBCUniversal has decided to shatter the long-guarded theatrical window, at least for now.\n\nThe company announced plans on Monday to release a number of its newest films—including The Hunt, which stumbled badly over the weekend in its debut frame, and pre-coronavirus hit The Invisible Man—to on-demand services as soon as Friday, with rentals costing consumers $19.99 and lasting for 48 hours. The forthcoming Trolls World Tour, which remains set for theatrical release on April 10 despite theater closing and occupancy restrictions around mass gatherings in a push for social distancing, will also receive a simultaneous digital rollout next month.\n\n“Universal Pictures has a broad and diverse range of movies with 2020 being no exception. Rather than delaying these films or releasing them into a challenged distribution landscape, we wanted to provide an option for people to view these titles in the home that is both accessible and affordable,” Jeff Shell, NBCUniversal CEO, said in a statement released to the Hollywood trades on Monday. “We hope and believe that people will still go to the movies in theaters where available, but we understand that for people in different areas of the world that is increasingly becoming less possible.”\n\nTicket sales cratered over the weekend in North America, falling to historically low totals as the coronavirus pandemic upended what was considered previously normal everyday life. Of the three new releases, it was Universal's The Hunt which suffered the biggest losses. Originally expected to gross near $10 million based on projections, the Blumhouse thriller earned just over $5 million.\n\nLast week, Universal made the decision to punt F9, the highly anticipated ninth installment of the Fast & Furious franchise, from its May 23 release date to April 2, 2021. F9 was one of a number of major releases to flee from the next few weeks, including Paramount's A Quiet Place Part II (originally set for March 20), Disney's Mulan (originally set for March 27), and MGM's No Time to Die (originally set for April 10). But what started as a potentially temporary delay in theatrical releases has the potential to last for much longer. On Sunday, the Centers for Disease Control recommended that strong social distancing measures, including the cancelation of any event with more than 50 people present, be enacted over the next eight weeks. In an address Monday, however, President Donald Trump floated the notion that American life could be disrupted until July or August.\n\nAfter Trolls World Tour, the next two Universal movies set for release happen in June: Candyman from director Nia DaCosta and producer and co-writer Jordan Peele is currently set for June 12; The King of Staten Island, Judd Apatow's movie with Pete Davidson, arrives on June 19. But Shell left the door open for NBCUniversal to remaining flexible with releases going forward, which could impact the next Minions film as well as the latest installment in The Purge franchise, both dated for July.\n\n“Given the rapidly evolving and unprecedented changes to consumers’ daily lives during this difficult time, the company felt that now was the right time to provide this option in the home as well as in theaters,” he said. “NBCUniversal will continue to evaluate the environment as conditions evolve and will determine the best distribution strategy in each market when the current unique situation changes.”\n\nTraditionally, theater owners have insisted on a theatrical of about 72 days before a new release becomes available to on-demand platforms. But that very notion has been under siege for years—not just because of Netflix's inroads into film production but from even Universal itself. Back in 2011, Universal revealed plans to allow certain Comcast customers the ability to rent Brett Ratner's Tower Heist three weeks after its theatrical release for $59.99. However, after a huge pushback from the National Association of Theater Owners, which represents huge theater companies like AMC and Cineplex, the concept was scrapped altogether.\n\nBut as an industry source noted, at least right now, it's hard to shatter a theatrical window when theaters aren't even open—and Universal pointedly moved the high-priced F9 to another date rather than release it straight-to-video next month. Besides, by the time the coronavirus pandemic ends, going out to the theater could become the new Netflix and chill. “At some point, this crisis will clear, and the movies will most certainly be released,” Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore, said to Vanity Fair last month. “At that point, I think there will be a pent-up demand. If you’ve been sequestered indoors for weeks or even months, once there is some kind of normalcy restored, I think there’s going to be an intense interest in these outside-the-home activities.”\n\nThus far, no other studio has taken such drastic action. But Universal isn't alone in finding creative ways to get its content in front of quarantined customers. Disney, for instance, added Frozen II to Disney+ on Sunday, three months earlier than expected. The studio also pushed up the digital release of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker by a few days. We might see more of that going forward. After the NBCUniversal announcement, Birds of Prey director Cathy Yan wrote on Twitter that she'd be open to her film becoming available to stream earlier than planned as well.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThis post had been updated to include Cathy Yan's tweet.\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair\n\n— Cover story: How Knives Out star Ana de Armas is conquering Hollywood\n\n— Harvey Weinstein is ordered to jail in handcuffs\n\n— Love Is Blind is the grimly fascinating dating show we need right now\n\n— There’s no other war movie as horrifying, or vital, as Come and See\n\n— Hillary Clinton on her surreal life and new Hulu documentary\n\n— The royal family’s weirdest real-life scandals get even weirder on The Windsors\n\n— From the Archive: A look inside Tom Cruise’s relationships governed by Scientology and how Katie Holmes planned her escape\n\nLooking for more?
