        "text": "The cyborg as a metaphor for cultural encodings of the interaction between humans and technology has been an accepted trope since the publication of Donna Haraway's \"Cyborg Manifesto. \" Alex Garland's 2015 film Ex Machina shares many of its key themes and motifs with earlier science fiction films, from Fritz Lang's Metropolis to Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. A first viewing of the film thus suggests an interpretation that focuses on the film's portrayal of its female cyborgs Ava and Kyoko as another version of the \"pleasure model\" in the mode of Lang's Maria or Scott's Pris. However, it is the tension between Ava's intelligence and visual attractiveness and her performance of a female gender identity that invites a closer investigation of the film's visual encoding of the female cyborg. As the film shifts its focus from the young male programmer Caleb and his encounter with his employer Nathan and the cyborg Ava to Ava's selfportrait, this chapter will take a closer look at the embodiment of cyborg identity.\n\nEverybody loves this film, big critics, avid-watchers, and even someone who doesn't really understand the art of filmmaking. Somebody told me, \"Don't trust someone who thinks The Godfather sucks.\". Well, truly, Coppola's 1972 American crime film is a monumental masterpiece, in every aspect: direction, cinematography, production, costume design, script, and acting. A pioneer and a big piece to a new cinematic movement. This classic dramatically changed the world of cinema, entering the big screen with personas whom people of the early 70s did not expect to see, they took a big risk but with a good freaking story.\n\nIn 1960, the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad, undertook an operation in Argentina to capture the architect of the Final Solution, Adolf Eichmann, and bring him to Israel to stand trial. Operation Finale [Chris Weitz, 2018] tells the story of this intelligence operation: the actions of and challenges for the agents involved, in a way that captures the banality of Eichmannâ€™s personality before it was put on show for the world to see in his televised trial. Operation Finale is available on Netflix, rendering it a Holocaust film with an extraordinarily large reach."
