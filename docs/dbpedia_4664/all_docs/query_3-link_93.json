        "text": "Donna Langley, the head of Universal’s Motion Picture Entertainment Group, stepped on the stage at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas last week and reaffirmed her commitment to movie theaters.\n\n“Theatrical will always be the cornerstone of our business,” she told the crowd of theater owners gathered for the annual CinemaCon industry convention, adding, “Cheers to that.”\n\nIt was not just lip service. With more than 25 films set for release in 2022, Universal has at least 10 more than any other major Hollywood studio. It will release a combination of blockbusters (“Jurassic World Dominion”), family fare (“Minions: The Rise of Gru”) and original bets (Jordan Peele’s “Nope” and “Beast,” starring Idris Elba), operating on the premise that a movie’s value begins with its debut in theaters.\n\nYet on Monday, as part of a presentation for advertisers, Kelly Campbell, the president of NBCUniversal’s streaming service, Peacock, announced that three new movies produced by Universal Pictures will head straight to the streaming service when they debut in 2023.\n\nThey are a biopic about LeBron James based on his memoir, “Shooting Stars”; a remake of John Woo’s 1989 crime drama “The Killer”; and “Praise This,” a music-competition feature set in the world of youth choir.\n\nThe additional film content is crucial to the strategy at Peacock, which announced last week that it had ended the first quarter of the year with more than 13 million paid subscribers and 28 million monthly active accounts in the United States, a growth of four million users. It needs to find a way to compete with the bigger services, like Netflix, Disney+ and HBO Max, when streaming subscriber numbers seem to be plateauing.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
