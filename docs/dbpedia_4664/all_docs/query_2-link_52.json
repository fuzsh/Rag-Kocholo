        "text": "In the last few years, I’ve become increasingly fascinated by artificial intelligence, and in particular our escalating fear of it. It seemed to me that our increasingly holistic relationship with technology and abstract clouds of information was compounding this fear and perhaps edging it into paranoia.\n\nThese thoughts were crystallized while writing and directing the new film “Ex Machina.” It tells the story of a young male coder in a tech company who is given the job of assessing the level of consciousness in a female-presenting robot called Ava. He’s bewitched, gives up the day job and starts making plans to elope.\n\nI remember feeling pleased when I hit upon this plot. Robot sentience hadn’t really been tackled since Steven Spielberg’s “A.I.” (2001), which was less interested in artificial intelligence than the title suggested, and the ideas of machine-thinking and human consciousness felt like a rich seam.\n\nSo I was dismayed when after submitting the script, I discovered I wasn’t alone in writing an A.I. movie. There was “Her” (2013), which tracked a love affair between a man and his computer’s sentient operating system. Next was “Transcendence,” in which Johnny Depp uploaded his mind to the Internet. In “Automata” and “Chappie,” servile robots acquired independence. In “Big Hero 6,” an A.I. befriends a boy. And in “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” out next week, a robot tries what we all know they’re secretly planning: the destruction of mankind.\n\nAmong filmmakers there was an A.I. party going on, to which we were late. Worse yet, someone else had shown up in the same dress. Another film had freakish similarities to “Ex Machina.” It was called “The Machine” and also starred a female-presenting A.I. named Ava. (Initially I wondered if it was an incredibly early porn parody of “Ex Machina” that had missed the more obvious riff of “Sex Machina.” But it turned out to be a thoughtful action movie by the Welsh writer-director Caradog James.)\n\nAlongside this sudden preoccupation in the film world, a growing number of public figures began making statements about the inherent danger of A.I. research. The gist was that if mankind wasn’t careful, we would code the terms of our own destruction by robot overlords. These are warnings one might expect from a religious perspective, concerned with the godlike aspects of creating sentient life. But interestingly, the warnings were actually coming from the science and tech worlds.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
