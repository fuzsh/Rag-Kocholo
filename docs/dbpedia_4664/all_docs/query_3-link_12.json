        "text": "Background\n\nUniversal Studios began in 1912 when producer Carl Laemmle merged his motion-picture company with several others to form the Universal Film Manufacturing Company. Three years later he opened Universal City, a complex of buildings in California that housed film production and distribution facilities as well as public viewing areas. Throughout the years the studio was involved in a series of mergers, eventually obtaining the name Universal Studios in 1996. In 2004 the company (as part of Vivendi Universal Entertainment) merged with the National Broadcasting Co., Inc., to form NBC Universal. NBC Universal has been owned by the cable company Comcast since 2011.\n\nMovies\n\nUniversal’s first overwhelmingly successful film was All Quiet on the Western Front (1930), which won Academy Awards for best picture and for best director in 1930. The studio then launched a foray into the horror field, producing well-known films such as Frankenstein (1931) and Dracula (1931). In the 1940s Universal produced numerous films featuring the comedic duo Abbott and Costello. The early 1960s brought the studio box-office success with the Academy-Award winning films Spartacus (1960) and To Kill a Mockingbird (1962) and with the comedies of Doris Day and Rock Hudson.\n\nBeginning in the 1970s Universal began to offer a more diverse collection of films, sometimes in collaboration with other companies. These movies included the comedies The Sting (1973) and Animal House (1978), the thrillers Jaws (1975) and Jurassic Park (1993), the family films E.T. (1982) and Back to the Future (1985), and the dramas Out of Africa (1985), Scent of a Woman (1992), and Schindler’s List (1993). In the early 21st century Universal continued to produce and distribute popular films. Movies from this era included Meet the Parents (2000) and its sequels, The Fast and the Furious (2001) and its sequels, the Bourne movies (2002 and later), and the animated comedies Despicable Me (2010) and its sequels.\n\nTheme Parks\n\nUniversal Studios is also known for a number of theme parks that highlight its movie and television productions. In addition to being a working studio, Universal Studios Hollywood includes rides and attractions and offers tours of various television and film sets. It was damaged by fires in 1990 and 2008; the latter destroyed two square blocks of the studio lot as well as its popular King Kong attraction. Universal Orlando Resort in Florida features the Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure theme parks. The latter includes the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, an attraction based on J.K. Rowling’s popular book series. Other Universal Studios theme parks are located in Osaka, Japan, and in Singapore."
