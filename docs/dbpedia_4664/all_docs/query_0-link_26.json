Upon his arrival, Caleb learns that Nathan has chosen him to be the human component in a Turing Test — charging him with evaluating the capabilities, and ultimately the consciousness, of Nathan’s latest experiment in artificial intelligence. That experiment is Ava (Vikander), a breathtaking A.I. whose emotional intelligence proves more sophisticated, seductive–and more deceptive–than the two men could have imagined.\n\n“Alex Garland is already one of the most brilliant and distinctive writers working today. ‘Ex Machina’ marks the beginning of an exciting new step for Alex the director, and we are thrilled to help bring his provocative vision to US audiences,” A24 said in a statement.\n\nAlso read: Jessica Chastain, Oscar Isaac Film ‘A Most Violent Year’ to Open AFI Fest"
