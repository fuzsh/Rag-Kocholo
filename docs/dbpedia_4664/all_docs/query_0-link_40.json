        "text": "A24 has acquired U.S. rights to “Ex Machina,” the directorial debut from writer Alex Garland (“28 Days Later,” “Sunshine”). The film stars Oscar Isaac (who also stars in A24’s upcoming thriller “A Most Violent Year”), Domhnall Gleeson and Alicia Vikander.\n\nHere’s the synopsis per A24: Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson), a programmer at an internet-search giant, wins a competition to spend a week at the private mountain estate of the company’s brilliant and reclusive CEO, Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac). Upon his arrival, Caleb learns that Nathan has chosen him to be the human component in a Turing Test—charging him with evaluating the capabilities, and ultimately the consciousness, of Nathan’s latest experiment in artificial intelligence. That experiment is Ava (Alicia Vikander), a breathtaking A.I. whose emotional intelligence proves more sophisticated, seductive––and more deceptive––than the two men could have imagined.\n\nA24 will release the film April 10, 2015. Universal International Pictures will distribute the film internationally. View the poster that A24 just released below:"
