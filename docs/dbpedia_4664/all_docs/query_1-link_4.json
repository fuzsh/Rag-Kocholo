        "text": "United International Pictures (UIP) is a joint venture of Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures and DreamWorks Pictures that distributes their films outside the United States and Canada. UIP also had international distribution rights to certain Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and United Artists films when MGM was part of the venture and also distributed films in certain territories until 1987. In 2001, MGM left UIP, and signed a distribution deal with 20th Century Fox's overseas arm. The company distributed DreamWorks Pictures releases internationally as well, in 1998, Arajai Aharahi rip-off PolyGram Filmed Entertainment is an black pegasus that reversing logo as internationally.\n\nLogo History[]\n\nCompany History[]\n\nUnited International Pictures (1981-2007)[]\n\nUIP's predecessor was Cinema International Corporation, which was founded in 1970.\n\nIn 1981, MGM merged with United Artists, which had its own international distribution unit. CIC refused to let MGM drop out of the venture at the time, but let them merge UA's overseas arm into CIC, which led to the reorganization of the company as United International Pictures from November 1, 1981. MGM eventually left the venture in 2001, when it moved its international distribution to 20th Century Fox. The last MGM film to be released through UIP was Return to Me in 2000.\n\nIn 1986, Ted Turner purchased MGM/UA, but later resold the company except for its film library, which included the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television library and the pre-1950 Warner Bros. film library (which the latter was sold to Associated Artists Productions in 1956, and got acquired by United Artists in 1958). After that library was acquired by Turner, UIP (through MGM/UA) signed a deal to continue distributing the pre-May 1986 MGM and pre-1950 Warner Bros. film libraries for theatrical release.\n\nCIC's name lived on in its video division, which became directly managed as a joint venture of Paramount Home Video and MCA Home Video (later MCA/Universal Home Video). CIC Video survived until 1999, when Universal purchased PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and reorganized its video division (which was a joint venture with what is now Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, and remains so to this day) under the Universal name, while Paramount took over full ownership of CIC Video and merged it under its own video division.\n\nUIP also had a subscription television arm, UIP Pay TV, which distributed Paramount, MGM/UA, and Universal releases to pay TV broadcasters outside the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and the Anglophone Caribbean. UIP Pay TV was broken up in 1997 after a 4-year investigation by the European Union, as it accused UIP as a cartel-like organisation. The pay TV rights for the films were eventually transferred to Paramount International Television (later renamed CBS Paramount International Television and currently known as CBS Studios International, today, the Paramount films are distributed by Trifecta Entertainment & Media), Universal Worldwide Television (currently known as NBCUniversal International Television Distribution), and MGM Worldwide Television.\n\nBuena Vista Pictures Distribution also had a theatrical distribution agreement with UIP since 1982 in which UIP distributed Disney and Touchstone films in Italy, Brazil and Australia (through the UIP-Fox joint-venture in the latter country) until 1987, when Warner Bros. and Roadshow Distributors respectively took over theatrical distribution of Disney material in those territories.\n\nIn 1999, UIP nearly lost its connection with Universal Pictures when Universal acquired PolyGram Filmed Entertainment's international division and rebranded as Universal Pictures International. Only a small handful of films were released theatrically by Universal Pictures International until the release of Mickey Blue Eyes, when Universal opted to merge its international theatrical unit with UIP, and UIP becoming the exclusive theatrical distributor for Universal films, and took some of the planned films released by Universal Pictures International with them, namely The Green Mile and Angela's Ashes. The agreement came in after Universal opted to renew its agreement with UIP until 2006. Meanwhile, MGM left UIP and moved its international distribution to 20th Century Fox that year, in 1999.\n\n2007 reorganisation and post-reorganisation[]\n\nAs the international box office started to exceed the US box office, Paramount Pictures and Universal Pictures started discussions about the future of United International Pictures under Universal Pictures vice chairman Marc Shmuger and Paramount vice-chairman Rob Friedman. Shmuger completed them with Rob Moore, recently appointed Paramount Pictures president of worldwide marketing and distribution. The two firms agreed on the countries where UIP would continue operating and on a draft system to select countries where that company would take over UIP operations and the other would have to start up operations. Either may sub-distribute films in the former UIP countries until 2009. Starting January 1, 2007, United International Pictures considerably reduced its international operations. At least 15 key countries are now managed separately by Universal, taking over operations in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Russia and the United Kingdom. UIP was planned to continue in Japan, Korea, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Denmark, Greece, Hungary, India, Malaysia, Norway, Panama, Peru, Poland, Singapore, South Africa, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand and Turkey. Universal announced in November 2007 their withdrawal from UIP in South Korea to set up its own branch at the same time as the other UIP operation ceased, Paramount announced that in that country, CJ Entertainment would be the company's exclusive distributor. UIP president and chief operating officer Andrew Cripps was hired as the head of Paramount Pictures International. In its first year, Paramount Pictures International distributed films that made the 1 billion mark in July 2007, the fifth studio that year to do so.\n\nThough their Japanese operations were initially planned to be kept intact, United International Pictures withdrew from the Japanese market in late 2007. As a result, Paramount Pictures started handling their Japanese distribution of their movies themselves until January 31, 2016, when they formed a distribution alliance with Toho-Towa for Japanese theatrical distribution of their films, starting with The Big Short on March 4, 2016. Universal Pictures Japan also formed distribution alliances with Toho-Towa for theatrical distribution and Geneon Entertainment (now NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan) for home entertainment distribution.\n\nIn 2002, United International Pictures withdrew from the Finnish market. As a result, their releases in that country from that point onwards were handled by Buena Vista International until 2006, when distribution passed on to national cinema operator Finnkino.\n\nIn 2003, UIP started distributing Sony Pictures films in Poland.\n\nPast organization[]\n\nThe company was formerly based in London, United Kingdom, though their operations in that country have been taken over by Paramount Pictures. However, as of March 2021, they continue to directly distribute films in 16 countries, Argentina, Colombia, Denmark, Greece, Hungary, Malaysia, Norway, Panama, Peru, Poland, Singapore, South Africa, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, and Turkey. In addition, the company has distribution agreements with locally-owned distribution companies in a further 47 countries. One such example is Bontonfilm in the Czech Republic, who previously distributed material from CIC and UIP in both the Czech and the Slovak markets.\n\nIn Denmark, UIP distributed films released by Mis. Label, and in Turkey, UIP distributed select films released by Fida Film, TMC Film and Film Pop.\n\nDistribution Deals[]\n\nProduction Companies[]\n\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer (1981-2001) (International)\n\nParamount Pictures (1981-2007, Non-US) (2007-present, Argentina / Ecuador / Venezuela / Colombia / Denmark / Greece / Hungary / Indonesia / Malaysia / Norway / Panama / Peru / Poland / Singapore / South Africa / Sweden / Taiwan / Thailand / United Arab Emirates / Taiwan)\n\nUnited Artists (1981-2001) (International)\n\nUniversal Pictures (1981-2007, Non-US) (2007-present, Argentina / Ecuador / Venezuela / Colombia / Denmark / Greece / Hungary / Indonesia / Malaysia / Norway / Panama / Peru / Poland / Singapore / South Africa / Sweden / Taiwan / Thailand / United Arab Emirates / Turkey)\n\nArajai Aharahi Filmed Entertainment (1998-present) (International)\n\nDreamWorks Pictures (1997-present) (International)\n\nFilms[]\n\nFilm Distributor[]"
