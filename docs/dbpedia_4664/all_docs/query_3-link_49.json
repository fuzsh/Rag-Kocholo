        "text": "This year's Halloween Horror Nights will bring to life the tension, fear, and dread of the acclaimed multimillion-dollar A Quiet Place franchise. Keep it quiet, but versions of the maze will be featured at Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Orlando Resort.\n\nThe immersive experiences, inspired by the first two movies, A Quiet Place and A Quiet Place Part II, will introduce a unique element—the use of American Sign Language. This inclusion will add a layer of authenticity and most effectively recreate the aspects of the film's largely \"excruciatingly silent\" narrative mechanic.\n\nThe A Quiet Place haunted houses in both Hollywood and Orlando will follow the storytelling of director John Krasinski's original film and the sequel as the Abbott family fights to survive the nightmarish post-apocalyptic world besieged by sightless creatures with a sharp sense of hearing that attack anything that makes the slightest noise.\n\nUniversal's creative teams have combined state-of-the-art sound design, special effects, and a legion of scareactors to bring the hushed hellscape to life. Among the iconic scenes from A Quiet Place and A Quiet Place Part II that have been recreated for the haunted houses is the first film's farmhouse that serves as the Abbott family's safe haven, including the cellar where Evelyn Abbott, played by Emily Blunt in the movies, gives birth under the looming menace of the creatures. As brave guests move through the experience, they'll be accompanied by a soundtrack of snarls ready to attack if terrified ticket holders make a sound.\n\nWhile the seasonal attraction is based on the first two installments in the series, it will land only a few months after the highly anticipated release of the prequel, A Quiet Place: Day One, which stars Lupita Nyong'o, Joseph Quinn, Alex Wolff, and returning cast member Djimon Hounsou. It's not the first time a movie Nyong'o has headlined has been turned into a maze at Universal Studios Halloween Horror Nights. Director Jordan Peele's Us was one of the major draws for the 2019 event at the Hollywood theme park.\n\nMade for $17 million, A Quiet Place landed in theaters in April 2018, got great reviews, and grossed $341 million. The bigger-budget sequel, A Quiet Place Part II, followed in March 2021. Once again, it received a solid critical response and garnered $297.4 million, setting several box office records, including the biggest opening weekend of the pandemic. A fourth and apparently final film in the series, direct sequel A Quiet Place Part III, will be released in theaters in 2025."
