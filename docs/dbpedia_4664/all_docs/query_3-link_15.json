        "text": "OUR HISTORY\n\nIn 1988, Universal Studios Florida was conceived as a \"working\" studio for feature films, TV, and commercial production. The studio would provide added entertainment value to the Universal Studios Florida theme park by allowing guests of the park to become part of studio audiences and spectators while a production was filming in the parks.\n\nUniversal Studios Florida Production Group's (\"USFPG\") sound stage operations opened for business in October 1988, as the first operating division at Universal Studios Florida. The first building was The Producers Building (B22A), which provided production offices for the USFPG staff and outside production companies. Then came stages 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24, followed by 18, 19 and B17 (to support Nickelodeon's Florida Network Operations). The last stage added was stage 25, originally housing America's Health Network (Discovery Health) and, currently, the DAVE School.\n\nThe facilities at Universal Studios Florida are globally well known within the entertainment business and, since its inception, thousands of high-profile feature films, television shows, commercials, and print productions have utilized its sound stages and backlot.\n\nSome of the higher-profile feature films that have been filmed on USFPG's sound stages include:\n\nParenthood (starring Steve Martin)\n\nOscar (starring Sylvester Stallone)\n\nMatinee (starring John Goodman)\n\nThe Waterboy (starring Adam Sandler)\n\nSharknado 3: Oh, Hell No! (starring Ian Ziering And Tara Reid)\n\nThe indie film The House on Haunted Hill (starring Geoffrey Rush and Famke Janssen) was actually shot inside the Islands of Adventure with the Incredible Hulk ride as one of its sets.\n\nThe first television series to make use of the brand new sound stages was The New Leave It to Beaver and Nickelodeon's Super Sloppy Double Dare. More recently, USFPG played host to All Elite Wrestling, Karate Combat, Professional Fighters League, David Makes Man, The Right Stuff, Deal or No Deal, IMPACT Wrestling, and La Voz Kids. Examples of some of the more high-profile TV shows shooting on the backlot include: Family Feud, Wheel of Fortune, Ellen, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, and American Ninja Warrior.\n\nThere have also been hundreds of music videos, print, and television commercials shot in the stages and on the backlot since its inception. One of the most ambitious productions was for the rock band Creed when a portion of the New York backlot was flooded to shoot the music video for their award-winning song My Sacrifice."
