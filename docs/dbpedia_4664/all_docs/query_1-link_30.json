        "text": "In the dying light in the Four Seasons café in Beverly Hills, Alex Garland smiles at a question about the future of science fiction. “If only I’d packed my crystal ball when I came over here,” he says.\n\nNo wonder he’s hesitant to make a prediction—he’s been burned before. The 2007 cosmic horror Sunshine, for which he wrote the screenplay, wouldn’t seem out of place among Oscar-nominated films like Gravity and The Martian. But when it came out nearly a decade ago, he says, “I remember being told by someone in the distribution company, ‘This film’s screwed. You’ve got no chance with it.’ This was after it was made, as well. Basically, being told, ‘People just aren’t into sci-fi. Sci-fi’s dead.’ Like a year later, Avatar came out, and suddenly sci-fi’s the biggest thing in the history of cinema.”\n\nHe continues, “[But] at the point that person said [that] to me, I wasn’t thinking, ‘No, they’re wrong. Sci-fi is going to be bigger than ever.’ I was thinking, ‘Oh no! Shit. Sci-fi’s dead. Oh no, that’s terrible. I love doing sci-fi. Help.’”\n\nLuckily, he was wrong, as proved by his directorial debut Ex Machina, an indie hit for which he’s nominated for a best-original-screenplay Oscar. The movie stands out among the recent slate of science-fiction films, a meditative, insular, and philosophical tale of a scientist (Oscar Isaac), his alluring robot creation (Alicia Vikander), and the hapless young man (Domhnall Gleeson) who attempts to come between them. Compared to the Marvel movies, the Star Trek and Star Wars updates, and even The Martian, it feels the most disturbingly futuristic. Perhaps an even better word would be imminent.\n\nAs far as Garland can tell, he’s part of a trend. “Over the last two or three years, there have been a ton of films about [artificial intelligence]. There were not a ton of films about A.I. 10 years ago. There was A.I. And then there was Her, Transcendence, Ex Machina, Chappie, Age of Ultron, and a bunch more,” says Garland. “The truism about science fiction, which is often true, is that it’s about something contemporary. It’s about a contemporary concern. At the moment, one of the contemporary concerns has to do with our relationship with machines,” he adds. “All these small-software-machine worries get lumped together, and they manifest in a story as Ultron. That isn’t specifically a fear of A.I. That’s about feeling disempowered.”\n\nHe’s sticking with science fiction for his next project as well, adapting Annihilation by Jeff VanderMeer, the first in the Southern Reach trilogy, about the mysterious Area X—a book that Ex Machina producer Scott Rudin recommended. Compared to his script for the gut-wrenching Never Let Me Go, based on the book written by Kazuo Ishiguro (yet another key writing influence), “This is a much looser kind of adaptation,” he says.\n\nIn terms of his style, though, that will likely remain the same. “Some of the people I’m working with, this is now like the sixth movie we’ve worked on together. Pretty much the crew of Ex Machina is making Annihilation.”\n\nSunshine, Ex Machina, and Annihilation are all about scientists, people who can create–have created–the future scenarios we all discuss. “I like groups of scientists in films, actually, because of the kinds of conversations they can have.” Speaking on the ethical guidelines of A.I., Garland wouldn’t be out of place in one of his movies: he runs scenarios of it being in cars, hospitals, and drones and discusses our neuroses around each. “The issues around it are like the issues around cloning. They get so complex so quickly that maintaining a clear ethical line on it is really, really hard. It’s not open to easy answers at all,” he says. But he’s not interested in exploring the “should” of these technological advances. “If it’s going to happen, figure out what you do once it’s happened, not whether it should or shouldn’t. That’s where the anxiety should lie, I think.”\n\nThe main difference between his conversations and the ones in his movies is the characters having them usually have the answers. “The thing of [that] life,” he says. “The certainty. There’s so much certainty there. How do people have all that fucking certainty? I really don’t have that certainty.”\n\nBut he’s more certain when asked about how race and gender factor into science fiction. “In exactly the same way as they factor into everything else. Don’t they? What I’d like to know is what they don’t factor into. It would be simpler, wouldn’t it, to say, ‘Where don’t they?’\n\n“You can do a thought experiment [with Ex Machina] : flip the genders,” suggests Garland. “Then imagine what the thesis of the film then becomes. To me, it’s really obvious—but anyway, I’ll shut up.\"\n\nA love of those thought experiments, and that wary relationship with certainty, helped Garland steer away from an intended career as a journalist early on. “I tried doing it, and I thought, ‘I can’t do this,’ because every statement I write, I want to do 50 qualifiers, and the qualifiers become impossible,” he says. Now he makes his statements via sci-fi—where questions always lead to even more questions. “The terms on which I want to publicly express myself are in Ex Machina. I’ve got a bunch of arguments, and I don’t want to put them down as a diatribe or a lecture or an essay or something, so that’s it.”\n\nWith science fiction, he says, “It’s freer. You’re obliged to think about it as hard as you can. You do that, but within that parameter you can then be quite free after that. I feel crucially you’re allowed to say things that aren’t true.”\n\nOr maybe he can say it even more simply. Near the end of our interview, Alex Garland shrugs good-naturedly. “Yeah, sci-fi’s cool. That’s the only quote: I like sci-fi,” he says, smiling. “You can make it up.”\n\nJulianne Moore, Ex Machina, and More Surprising Stories from the 2015 Box Office\n\n1 / 10"
