        "text": "Thumbnail: Wickedly smart and often wickedly funny, this delightfully entertaining science fiction drama is one of the best films of the year.\n\nBox Office:\n\nEx Machina is an original science-fiction drama written and directed by Alex Garland, writer of The Beach and screenwriter of 28 Days Later and Sunshine. It stars Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac, and Alicia Vikander, the first two of whom both star in Walt Disney&#039;s Star Wars: The Force Awakens in December. Mr. Isaac will star in next summer's X-Men: Apocalypse as the title baddie. Ex Machina has been in theatrical release here and there around the world since late January, and it has already earned $6.2 million overseas prior to this Friday's limited American release, with $3.8m of that coming from the UK (which makes sense since it's technically a British film). A24 is handling domestic distribution, and they claim that the film will be somewhat wide by April 24th. I'm at least a little hopeful that the generally positive reviews and strong buzz can allow for something approaching a breakout in that proverbial dead space between Furious 7 and Avengers: Age of Ultron.\n\nRegardless, I'm not going to pretend that this film is destined for box office glory. The picture is a gloried stage play, with basically four roles of any note, and it puts a premium on ideas and thoughtful conversation over special effects and spectacle. Nonetheless, the picture cost $20 million to produce and I can't imagine it not at least being something of a cult classic over the next few years and slowly making money through word-of-mouth rentals or VOD downloads and the like. Truth be told, there probably won't be much of a box office story for this one. I'm writing about it because the initial reviews interested me and the film lived up to the hype. It's one of the best films of the year thus-far and it's absolutely worth your time as it slowly expands to a theater near you over the next month.\n\nThe Review:\n\nIt is a strange thing, how we humans constantly rush to ascribe human motivations or human empathy toward things that are not entirely human or explicitly real. We watch nature documentaries and assume that the animal behavior is explicitly motivated by the same thoughts and motivations as somewhat generic humans. We watch clearly fictional entertainments and yet feel real emotions at the fictional plot turns or choices concerning clearly fictional characters. And even in our lives, we can be tricked into having human feelings about things that are clearly not alive, such as a favorite stuffed animal or an old shirt that you just can't bear to throw away. The deliciously enjoyable Ex Machina doesn't just play around with the notion of artificial intelligence to tell another tale about a would-be robot who \"learns\" to be human. The Alex Garland film goes further down the rabbit hole to examine, with overwhelming success, how humans can assign not just emotion but explicit morality based on predisposed presumptions of human behavior and would-be human wants.\n\nThe plot of Ex Machina is deceptively simple. A young programmer named Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) working for a tech company is recruited to spend a weekend with the big boss (Oscar Isaac) and participate in a \"Turing Test.\" The catch is that the would-be artificial construct, in the form of a young woman (Alicia Vikander) is clearly presented as a non-human artificial creation. What follows is a series of conversations between man and man, as well as man and \"robot woman,\" with young Caleb realizing that he may be as much of a test subject as the A.I. creation. The notion of an artificial or \"unnaturally created\" life form in the form of an alluring female causing trouble for \"her\" creators is not a new one, and at the very least you should all go out and rentSplice. But like the best sci-fi dramas, the emphasis is on the (theoretical) science rather than the narrative fiction, and the picture becomes an endlessly exciting construct where the most suspenseful moments come from incredibly intelligent conversation between highly intelligent people about theoretical science made practical.\n\nWhat's fascinating about the story is how our four main characters, and I'm including the nearly mute Sonoya Mizuno as Nathan's assistant, basically end up playing out tried-and-true conventions of gender relations even in what should be uncharted territory. The brilliant and weirdly affable Nathan (Isaac is far creepier by virtue of being personable and casual than if he played conventionally buttoned-down or uber-cold) finds himself as the would-be tyrannical patriarch of the two \"women\" in his life, one of which is a mostly unthinking servant and the other is a glorified captive who may or may not be using her would-be feminine wiles to gain her freedom and/or the upper hand. Caleb cannot help but play the role of the knight-in-shining-armor, who comes to see Ava as a victim of her creator and a would-be romantic interest regardless of the fact that, practically speaking, she is no more \"real\" than a toaster oven. Garland has fun toying with the audience's' sympathies as well.\n\nHe knows that we will come to villainize Nathan even though, objectively speaking, he has merely created a machine that can mimic so-called human behavior. Nathan sees Ava as an object to be studied, controlled, and discarded when her usefulness has ended. But Caleb merely sees her as a romantic interest to be rescued. Beyond the scientific constructs at play, the film offers a tantalizing glimpse of how we automatically put women into specific and often passive roles even in situations regardless of the circumstances. But we do get wonderful scenes between our three respective leads (and a few wholly unexpected moments involving Mizumo) which deal very much with the scientific theories at play, all laid out in a way that is unquestionably intelligent while also clearly understandable to the kind of viewer smart enough to understand Interstellar but not smart enough to catch all of its scientific inaccuracies.\n\nI'm sure someone will write a \"What Ex Machina Gets Wrong About A.I.\" over the next week or so, but the science all feels genuine enough to create utter plausibility and believability for the story being told. But the film isn't just wicked smart and insightful about its subject matter, it also looks incredible. The film cost $20 million to produce, but frankly it looks significantly more expensive. And more importantly, the film never feels like any corners were cut in terms of production design and onscreen action for the sake of a reasonable budget. And the picture is an acting treat as well. Oscar Isaac gets the showiest role, and he delivers what would be a star making performance if he wasn't already one of the more popular emerging talents. That he has delivered three star turns as diverse as his work in Inside Llewyn Davis, A Most Violent Year (out today on DVD), and now Ex Machina shows someone who is going to have a long and wonderful career if he so chooses. The film is at its most vibrant and joyous when he is passionately and gleefully explaining what he has done and questioning his test subject's actions. A lesser movie would make him out to be a villain, but Garland (and Isaac) are too clever for that.\n\nAnd the key word for Ex Machina is indeed \"clever.\" It is smart in all the right ways, both about the science at play and the theoretical human relationships and gender roles at work. The picture looks and sounds fabulous, and it is as funny as it is exciting as it is thoughtful. More than that I will not say, and just know that I have left a number of pleasures untold. Ex Machina opens in limited release on April 10th before (hopefully) going somewhat wide by April 24th. As of this moment it is the best film I have seen in 2015. It is a genuine new classic and a joy to behold."
