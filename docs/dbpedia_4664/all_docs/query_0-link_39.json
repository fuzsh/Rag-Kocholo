        "text": "Acclaimed Thriller Seduces Audiences as It Arrives on Blu-ray™ and DVD July 14 from Lionsgate Home Entertainment\n\nThe stylish, psychological thriller Ex Machina will leave audiences enthralled when it arrives on Blu-ray™ (plus Digital HD) and DVD (plus Digital) July 14th from Lionsgate Home Entertainment. After blowing away critics at its U.S. premiere at the 2015 SXSW Film Festival, the highly anticipated sci-fi film was theatrically released by A24 and has been applauded as “sizzlingly smart, gorgeous and astute” (Wall Street Journal), “a triumph” (The Playlist), and “the year’s best sci-fi movie” (Esquire). Rotten Tomatoes Certified Fresh, Ex Machina is about a breathtaking android (A.I.) whose emotional intelligence proves more sophisticated—and more deceptive—than man could have imagined. Making his directorial debut, Ex Machina was written and directed by Alex Garland (writer of 28 Days Later, Dredd) and stars Domhnall Gleeson (upcoming Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens, Unbroken), Alicia Vikander (upcoming The Circle, A Royal Affair) and Golden Globe®-nominated actor Oscar Isaac (upcoming Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens, A Most Violent Year).\n\nAfter winning a competition to spend a week at the mountain estate of his company’s brilliant CEO (Isaac), programmer Caleb (Gleeson) arrives to discover he has been chosen to take part in a study of artificial intelligence. Sworn to secrecy and cut off from the outside world, Caleb meets his subject, a beguiling and seductive android (Vikander)—and is plunged into an A.I. experiment beyond his wildest dreams in this epic thriller charged with heart-stopping suspense.\n\nThe Blu-ray and DVD are packed with spellbinding extras including an in-depth behind-the-scenes featurette that examines the story development, the cast and characters, the production design, cinematography and location shooting in Norway, costumes and makeup and finally, visual effects along with a wrap-up. The discs also contain a Q&A with cast and crew from SXSW and eight vignettes. In addition, this release marks the first time a Blu-ray features DTS:X immersive audio technology. DTS:X replicates and conveys the fluid movement of sound to create a richer soundscape than previously possible by moving sound to precisely where the mixer placed it. Ex Machina will be available on Blu-ray™ and DVD for the suggested retail price of $24.99 and $19.98, respectively.\n\nWhile we're excited to hear of the announcement of the first DTS:X Blu-ray movie release, it's important to remember that currently there are no AV receivers or processors capable of decoding this new Immersive Surround Format. We are however told that firmware updates are coming for select Denon, Marantz AV receivers. Expect DTS:X capable products from other manufacturers to start coming out around CEDIA time this fall. Until then, you can enjoy the sound in DTS-HD.\n\nBlu-ray / DVD Special Features:\n\nThrough the Looking Glass: Creating Ex Machina” 5-Part Featurette\n\nSXSW Q&A with Cast and Crew\n\nEight Behind-the-Scenes Vignettes\n\nProgram Information:\n\nYear of Production: 2014\n\nTitle Copyright: Ex Machina © 2014 Universal City Studios Productions LLLP.
