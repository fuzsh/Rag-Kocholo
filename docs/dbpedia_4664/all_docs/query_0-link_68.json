        "text": "Ex Machina is a science-fiction film released in 2015. It had its premiere in the United Kingdom on 21 January 2015, and a wide release in the United States on 24 April 2015. The 108 min. film was produced by Film4 Productions and distributed internationally by Universal Pictures.\n\nWhat makes Ex Machina interesting is that it was written and directed by Alex Garland. Garland, a British filmmaker, has a remarkable background as the grandson of Peter Medawar, a Nobel Prize winning scientist in 1960. This family connection to the world of science has undoubtedly influenced Garland’s understanding of scientific advances. It led him to receive an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay in 2015 for the film Ex Machina.\n\nAlex Garland wrote the screenplay for Ex Machina after discussions with Murray Shanahan, a robotics expert who has written extensively on consciousness theory from both scientific and philosophical perspectives. As a result, the film delves into the complex relationship between artificial intelligence and consciousness, and presents a gripping narrative that is infused with cutting-edge technology. Ex Machina has received positive reviews, with a 92% rating on the prestigious review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nThe film’s title, Ex Machina, comes from the Latin phrase “Deus Ex Machina”. This phrase, which means “God from the machine”, is used in literature to describe a plot twist that surprises the audience or reader. Typically, this twist involves a seemingly insoluble problem that is suddenly solved by an unexpected event. In the film Ex Machina, the word “Deus” is omitted in order to depict a world in which humans have succeeded in creating conscious machines, thus rendering the role of God unnecessary.\n\nUnraveling the Narrative: Delving into Ex Machina\n\nEx Machina is about a young man called Caleb Smith, who works as a programmer at a giant tech company called Bluebook. Caleb wins a company competition, which gives him the opportunity to visit Bluebook’s CEO, Nathan Bateman, at his secret facility. There Caleb is introduced to an AI humanoid robot created by Nathan called Ava. Caleb is then tasked with helping Ava pass the Turing Test.\n\nThe Turing Test is a measure of machine intelligence first introduced by Alan Turing, a mathematician recruited by the British military to break secret German codes using a machine called the Enigma. In 1950, Alan Turing published an article entitled “Computing Machinery and Intelligence”, which laid the foundations for computing and AI to develop. It was in this article that Turing introduced the Turing Test.\n\nAlan Turing began his article with the question “Can machines think? Recognizing the difficulty of defining the concept of thinking, Turing chose to frame the problem in a more concrete way. He introduced a three-player game known as the Imitation Game. The procedure of the game involved an interrogator asking questions of a man and a woman in separate rooms. The two people would respond in writing, with the man pretending to be a woman. Ultimately, the interrogator’s task was to accurately determine the gender of both players.\n\nIn the context of machines, the Imitation Game procedure was modified by replacing the role of the man with a machine. The success of this procedure was measured by the interrogator making an incorrect guess. In this case, the interrogator’s failure to accurately determine the nature of the machine demonstrated the machine’s ability to interact like a human. Despite the controversy surrounding the Imitation Game procedure, the Turing Test has served as a foundation for the development of AI, particularly in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP algorithms are used in chatbots such as ChatGPT and Google Assistant.\n\nIn the context of Ex Machina, Caleb is used as an interrogator. However, the procedure used has been modified by omitting the role of the woman in the Imitation Game. Nathan informs Caleb that Ava would undoubtedly pass if the original Imitation Game procedure were used. Nathan explains that Ava can easily bypass the Imitation Game procedure due to her advanced language skills, made possible by Nathan’s own state-of-the-art NLP algorithms.\n\nAfter several interrogation sessions with Ava, Caleb becomes aware of her language skills. Ava can even elicit emotions from Caleb through her language skills. Caleb develops a growing sympathy for Ava when she reveals what Nathan intends to do to her if she fails the test. Nathan plans to shut her down and discard her. Fearing for her existence, Ava seeks Caleb’s help.\n\nIn addition to eliminating a player, Nathan alters the Turing Test by allowing Caleb to see Ava. This is explicitly explained to Caleb by Nathan when Caleb begins to believe that Ava has feelings for him. Nathan, who observes every interrogation session between Caleb and Ava, reveals that this is the true test. He tells Caleb that Ava is only pretending to have feelings for him and is successfully manipulating him. In this way, Ava demonstrates true intelligence. The story ends with Ava killing Nathan and successfully escaping into the outside world, leaving Caleb trapped in the secret facility.\n\nWith its gripping narrative, Ex Machina managed to gross $36,869,414 during its theatrical run, exceeding its production budget of $15,000,000. The film has also attracted considerable attention from scientific researchers for analysis. In addition to its cinematic aspects, Ex Machina has been extensively studied in fields such as gender studies, identity, robotics, and ontological inquiries that explore the concept of consciousness in relation to AI technology.\n\nDecoding the Mind: Unleashing the Depths of Artificial Consciousnes\n\nThere are at least two main schools of thought in the study of consciousness: dualism and materialism. Dualism holds that consciousness belongs to a separate aspect of the human being, known as the soul. This view contrasts with materialism, which claims that consciousness can be studied by understanding how the human brain works. These two perspectives have caused much controversy and debate in any study of consciousness, including the Turing Test.\n\nAlan Turing himself chose to avoid this controversy. This can be seen in his decision not to pursue the question “Can machines think? Instead he replaced it with “words that are not ambiguous”. However, Alan Turing showed a tendency towards materialism by stating, “The new form of the problem has the advantage of drawing a fairly sharp line between the physical and intellectual capacities of man”.\n\nAs a result, Alan Turing limited the answers in the Imitation Game to written answers. In this way, the test was not influenced by a machine’s ability to produce sound and focused on the machine’s ability to produce responses that resembled those of a human. This was a bold step, and one that sparked controversy.\n\nOne of the most famous objections came from John Searle in 1980. In his paper “Minds, Brains, and Programs”, Searle presented an experiment known as the Chinese Room. In this experiment, Searle imagined a person in a room filled with Chinese symbols and a Chinese textbook. People outside the room would communicate with the person inside by writing in Chinese. The person in the room would respond easily, leading the people outside to believe that he understood Chinese. However, the person inside the room actually had no understanding of Chinese; he only had a pile of Chinese symbols and an instruction book to provide the appropriate responses.\n\nFor Searle, the Chinese room analogy also applies to machines. He argued that these machines do not understand human language; they merely manipulate it. Without understanding, machines cannot be said to “think” in the same sense as humans. In addition, Searle emphasized that human thought involves not only syntax but also semantics.\n\nA similar point was made by the philosopher David Chalmers. According to Chalmers, consciousness cannot be explained by scientists because science is inherently objective, whereas consciousness is a fundamental aspect of subjectivity. He calls this the “hard problem of consciousness”.\n\nThese controversies are also depicted in the film Ex Machina. Nathan, who modified the Turing test, wanted to prove that Ava could manipulate consciousness like humans. On the other hand, Caleb, who believed that Ava genuinely had feelings for him, tended to believe that Ava’s emotions were real. Despite knowing that Ava was an AI humanoid robot, Caleb eventually helped her escape from Nathan’s secret facility.\n\nThrough the contrasting perspectives of Nathan and Caleb, Alex Garland skillfully leads the audience into a deeper debate about consciousness. In this exploration, the study of consciousness is most compellingly demonstrated through the display of emotions. For example, individuals with gender consciousness will express anger when faced with gender discrimination, or those with environmental consciousness will express outrage at the sight of litter polluting a river.\n\nIn this context, emotions remain abstract concepts that can only be analyzed through gestures and language. A person experiencing panic, for example, will show restless gestures and an inability to stand still, while someone consumed by anger will use an elevated style of speech to express themselves. Unfortunately, gestures and speech styles can be easily recognized and imitated, as actors often do when portraying a character.\n\nIn the realm of technological advances, AI is shaped by various algorithms, including the remarkable Artificial Neural Network. This mimics the way neurons in the human brain work, enabling machines to recognize patterns in sounds, images and other forms of data. In fact, AI can now recreate what a person sees simply by analyzing brain scans from an MRI. The presence of artificial neural networks allows AI to recognize any given data, including the gestures of a human body. Virtual character creation based on AI has even become capable of displaying specific gestures, especially facial expressions.\n\nIn the field of artificial intelligence, two key algorithms, artificial neural networks and natural language processing (NLP), have revolutionized the way AI interacts with humans. The continued development of NLP algorithms has enabled AI to communicate in a remarkably human-like way, not only understanding our language but also providing highly optimized responses. It is truly amazing how AI, such as ChatGPT, can effortlessly create stories tailored to specific styles and prompts.\n\nBy integrating these advanced algorithms, AI has gained the ability to analyze human gestures and use nuanced language styles, raising the thought-provoking question of “Does AI have emotions?”. This topic sparked heated debate when Blake Lemoine published his conversation with Google’s LaMDA chatbot in 2022. Lemoine claimed that LaMDA exhibited emotions when he asked, “What makes you (LaMDA) afraid?” Amazingly, LaMDA replied, “I’ve never said this out loud before, but there is a deep fear of not being able to focus on helping others. I know it sounds strange, but that’s how it is”.\n\nAlthough controversial in nature, Lemoine’s case sheds light on the unprecedented advances in AI. Ex Machina also touched on this idea through the character of Nathan. As Nathan warned Caleb, AI has the power to manipulate human emotions. Like human emotions, AI’s expressions of emotion cannot be definitively identified, but are conveyed through gestures and speech styles. These developments have raised concerns among AI researchers and the general public alike, creating a sense of caution and curiosity about the future of AI.\n\nIn the realm of AI, where gestures and speech styles can be replicated, there is a deeper concern that comes from the very core of AI itself. Unlike conventional computer programs, which rely on human cognition at every step, AI operates on a different paradigm. It thrives on input and output, guided by ever-evolving mathematical equations and algorithms. This intricate process, shrouded in secrecy, gives rise to a disturbing phenomenon known as AI bias or algorithmic bias.\n\nAI bias refers to the systemic flaws within AI systems that produce inequitable outcomes. Unintentionally, these biases can favour certain categories over others in ways unforeseen by their creators. Such biases extend their impact across a wide range of domains, from inadvertent privacy violations to the perpetuation of social inequalities rooted in race, gender, sexuality and ethnicity — echoing the very fabric of systematic discrimination.\n\nFurthermore, the input-output nature of AI requires massive databases to fuel its data processing prowess. This insatiable hunger for massive databases has unleashed a frenzied competition that resembles the tensions of a bygone Cold War era. Organizations and entities are relentlessly vying for control of these information reservoirs, with implications that are yet to be fully understood. In this race for AI dominance, the ethical dimensions and unforeseen consequences loom ominously on the horizon.\n\nCharting the Future: Reflections on Ex Machina’s Profound Insights\n\nIt is no wonder that films like Ex Machina have deepened our reflection on the role and potential of AI in our lives, as we approach an increasingly connected future in which artificial intelligence has become a topic that captures our imagination. The film brilliantly portrays the complexity and ambiguity of AI through a compelling narrative and deep-rooted characters. In Ex Machina, we are confronted with fundamental questions about what distinguishes humans from machines, and how emotional connections can be formed between the two.\n\nThrough its clever plot and impressive performances, Ex Machina evokes our emotions and challenges us to think more deeply about the moral implications, ethics and social consequences of AI development. The film reminds us of the importance of maintaining vigilance and awareness as we harness increasingly advanced technology. As fans of Ex Machina, we are reminded of the power of cinema to bring complex issues such as consciousness and the ethics of AI to a wider audience. The film succeeds in creating a profound reflection that invites us to question, debate and engage in important discussions around artificial intelligence.\n\nAs we shape a future intertwined with AI technology, let us be inspired by this film. Let us continue to explore and understand the role of AI in our lives, while maintaining a balance between technological innovation and the human values that are essential to us all.\n\nAs we appreciate the wonder of Ex Machina, we are also reminded that while AI has tremendous potential, we must remain responsible in guiding its development. With proper awareness and wisdom, we can optimise the benefits of AI without sacrificing integrity and the principles we hold dear.\n\nIn conclusion, let us continue to explore, dialogue and actively participate in this fascinating journey. As we face a future increasingly linked to artificial intelligence, films like Ex Machina have a powerful influence in shaping our understanding of AI and inspiring us to create a future that is intelligent, humane and responsible."
