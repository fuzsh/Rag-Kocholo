        "text": "Where Shane Battier went, winning followed. After graduating with honors from Duke University with two Final Four appearances, one national championship, two All-American awards, and Naismith and John Wooden National Player of the Year awards, he was selected by the Memphis Grizzlies in the 2001 NBA draft. Battier went on to be part of the back-to-back 2012 and 2013 NBA championship Miami Heat team and a member of the USA Basketball national team.\n\nKnown for his exemplary character and his commitment to community service, Battier has established himself as a scholar athlete (inducted into the 2015 NCAA Academic All-American Hall of Fame), All-American, leader, champion, philanthropist, and an expert in team building. He understands that champions are often made when no one is looking, and that it is the attention to the often-unnoticed intangibles that makes the difference in building a championship culture. Profiled by best-selling author Michael Lewis, Battier is renown in basketball circles for elevating his team to championship levels through the winning plays that donâ€™t show up in the box score. He shares with audiences how to use data and analytics to pinpoint optimal strengths and weaknesses and reach full potential. Statistics and technology combine to provide the opportunity for athletic success that goes beyond traditional approaches. A strong proponent of the intersection of athletics and technology, Battier is an annual speaker at the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference and a consultant for Intel on their sports device division, focusing on application in sports. He advises multiple tech startups and is a global ambassador for the NBA."
