Battier will be tasked with evaluating all potential Heat players from an analytical perspective.\n\n\"Shane is an out of the box thinker and will bring a fresh expertise that can help us evolve as a franchise,\" Heat president Pat Riley said in a statement.\n\nBattier won back-to-back championships with the Heat in 2012 and 2013. The Duke product averaged 10.1 points and nearly five rebounds per game throughout his career but was more known for his leadership and defensive abilities."
