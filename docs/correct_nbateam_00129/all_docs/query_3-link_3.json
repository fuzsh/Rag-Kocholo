        "text": "A member of the NBA’s Miami Heat, Battier began his professional career as a 2001 first-round draft pick. A high school and collegiate Naismith Award winner and Oscar Robertson Award winner, Battier led the Duke Blue Devils to the 2001 NCAA Championship and two Final Four appearances. Off of the court, the religion major was a two-time Academic All-American and the 2001 Academic All-American of the year. Battier is celebrated for his unselfish play and ability to make his teammates better, and was dubbed the “no stats all-star” by author Michael Lewis in an article for The New York Times."
