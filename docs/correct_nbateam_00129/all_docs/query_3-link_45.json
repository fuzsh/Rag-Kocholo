        "text": "Scouting Report\n\nSelfless, hard-working, and one of the best locker-room leaders in NBA history. A shut-down defender who could guard anyone. A capable scorer who would occasionally hit big threes. Set an example for his team on and off the court. A winner, who was like another coach on the squad. While capable offensively he didn't create much off the dribble. Could have been more of a passer considering his limited one-on-one moves and his leader reputation. Despite solid athleticism he wasn't very explosive or fluid."
