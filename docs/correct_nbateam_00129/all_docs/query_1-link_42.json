        "text": "In 2016, I started collecting material for what I envisioned would be a book on — for lack of a better term — journeymen and glue guys in the NBA. That is, players who weren’t superstars or All-Stars but who nonetheless managed to make a career of it, sticking in the league for 10+ years and being contributors wherever they went. I’ve always been fascinated by this type of player: athletes who were often the best player on any team they were on right up until they reached the highest echelon of the sport and then had to learn how to adapt to that.\n\nWith the future of said project very much up in the air due to some life and career changes, I thought I would post some of the interviews I did as Q+As. I started by talking to Tayshaun Prince when he was on the Minnesota Timberwolves, but it wasn’t ultimately a great interview, so I’m going to start with Shane Battier, one of three Duke players I interviewed. Battier played for the Memphis Grizzlies, Houston Rockets and Miami Heat, winning two championships with the Heat (2012 & 2013) and one with Duke in 2001. I spoke with Shane via phone on April 14, 2016, the day after Kobe Bryant played his final game, scoring 60 points against the Utah Jazz. It comes up later.\n\nWhat would you have told your rookie self?\n\nI would tell my rookie self to take care of yourself early because it’s going to hurt in the end if you have the career that I think you’re going to have. When you’re young you disregard the veterans when they tell you it’s about eating right and taking your glucosamine and your vitamins and your rest. That’s a lesson that you learn three to four years into the league that you really can’t underestimate. I was so fortunate to escape serious injury. The worst thing that happened to me was that I had bone spurs taken from my ankle and that was it in 13 years. When you’re young, you feel invincible and you feel like you’re going to play forever. But Father Time is undefeated as they say.\n\nI was pretty good. I became much more health conscious toward the end of my career, just my body type and whatnot. I used to be able to eat and drink anything. One or two bottles a night wasn’t out of the question (laughs) and luckily it didn’t affect me too much the next day. I was coachable. When I came in the league and I started with my team the Memphis Grizzlies — we were bad, really, really bad, historically bad. In fact, when I got drafted, I left Duke as the all-time winningest basketball player, 133–15 and I go to the Memphis Grizzlies who, when they drafted me, were the worst team in professional sports. Literally, the lowest winning percentage out of the four North American sports. I caused a controversy there because we had veterans who did not fit the bill of veterans that I thought were going to take me under their wing and teach me what it was to be an NBA player. Growing up in Detroit, watching the Bad Boys, I always saw the Joe Dumars and the Isiah Thomases taking young Fennis Dembo under his arm and teaching him how to be a pro so I thought of course this is the way it should be.\n\nThat wasn’t the case in Memphis at all. And I told my veterans that in the ubiquitous team meeting, which I hate. We had lost like 10 in a row and we had a players only meeting and I stood up and said, “You know, I think it’s bullshit that our veterans aren’t taking the young guys under their wing and teaching them what it means to be an NBA player.” And they said in no uncertain terms, “Listen up, Duke boy, you gotta learn for yourself. We’re not your babysitters.” So I learned right away this was a man’s league and it’s okay to have an opinion, but it wasn’t like Duke. But I was coachable and I sought out knowledge of how to not only be a player, but to stick in the league.\n\nYou talk about being a role-player — I had two goals when I entered the NBA, only two goals. It wasn’t championships or points. I wanted to play ten years, and I wanted to walk away from the game before the game kicked me out. Those were my only two goals and I was lucky to meet both those. For me, my mindset was no different than when I played kickball or sandlot baseball when I was a kindergartener or first grader: do what you have to do to stay on the field. Do what you have to do to make yourself valuable and your teammates will love you and want you on their team every time.\n\nSo it was about creating value for yourself.\n\nIt’s a selfish selflessness. Or a selfless selfishness. Call it what you will. It’s the same thing, where being altruistic and selfish at the same time is beneficial for both you and the team.\n\nWas it difficult personally to go from a winning situation like Duke to the Grizzlies?\n\nIt was difficult. I wasn’t used to that. Ever since Little League, literally, I was a champion, or had a chance to win a championship every year, and I just remember sitting the first day of training camp and saying to myself, “Oh boy. This is going to be a long, long journey.”\n\nI’ll never forget the first conditioning test we had. It was a mile run and I’m thinking, “Oh my goodness, this is the NBA, the greatest athletes on the planet. I better be in the BEST shape of my life.” And so I trained so hard: I ran miles, sprints and I’m not a very fast runner. That’s not my strength. And so everyone lines up and I take off. Michael Dickerson, who’s just a freak athlete, just takes off and beats everybody. I come in second place. I ended up lapping like three or four guys. Ike Austin, my guy Stromile Swift, poor guy. I was like, “Oh my gosh, you gotta be kidding me. This is the NBA?” So I knew what I was in for early on. I steeled myself, but I never wanted to let people see me sweat and I knew that if I stayed the course I had the chance to do something that I had never done before and that’s help develop a culture.\n\nIs one way better than the other, sink or swim versus being taken under a wing?\n\nIt depends on your personality type. I think my greatest attribute as a player was my grit and my figure-it-out-ed-ness. Given a problem, I’m a problem solver, I’m gonna solve it. I think I learned way more by being thrown into that situation and having to figure it out, figuring out how to develop relationships, how to connect people and how to make it all work. If I went to another situation … you know, my freshman year at Duke, when the culture was so strong and I learned from guys like WoJo [Steve Wojciechowski] and Trajan Langdon and Roshown McLeod what it meant to be a Duke player, I think I was able to grow and slowly come along. But for what I wanted to do, I had to figure it out fast in the NBA and I did. I’m very thankful for my rookie year in a lot of regards.\n\nDo you think it’s easier for a four-year college player to come and play that type of glue guy role for a team that needs it?\n\nI think you have a better perspective on the process and the journey that a basketball player goes through. Guys who are one-and-done or don’t go to college all, guess what? They’ve been an All-Star at every level, including the one year they spent in college. The guys who stayed four years, you talk about the Nick Collisons, myself and a guy like Kyle Korver, we probably stayed four years because we weren’t good enough to go early. That means our first couple years we learned what it meant to be a true role player as a freshman and a sophomore. By the time you’re a junior and senior, it’s sort of your team and it’s your show, so you understand the evolution of a player. So when you’re asked to sort of take a step back and you’re not the one taking the shot or getting the playing time or getting the plays called for you, I think you have a better perspective on it. It’s easier to handle.\n\nI’m not saying young guys can’t handle that. A lot of guys like the NBA lifestyle, so it’s amazing what you’ll do to maintain the NBA lifestyle. But I think just from a philosophy standpoint, from a psychological standpoint, it helped me that I averaged 8 points a game my freshman year.\n\nFor me, in the NBA, it was the reverse. I averaged the most point in my career my rookie year. It steadily went down every year after that. My highwater mark was my rookie year when we were really bad. As I played on better teams, my scoring opportunities became less and less. My game evolved.\n\nTayshaun Prince made the observation that there are just fewer veterans in the league now for younger players to learn from. Has that been your experience as well?\n\nNo question. It’s a function of how the CBA is set up because veterans are expensive. It’s expensive to sign a 12-year veteran to an NBA minimum deal. It’s something like $1.5 million where you can get a rookie out of the D-League for $300,000 or whatever. If you’re up against the luxury tax line, that’s real money. As a result, you don’t see as many mentor-type veterans at the ends of benches that you used to. The CBA has sort of priced them out in a lot of ways.\n\nAnd has that hurt the pro game?\n\nYeah, I think the experience is different. I think it’s another not better or worse. It makes me sound like an old man to say, “It’s better to have old guys in the game.” I think the experience is different and I do believe in the value of mentorship in every walk of life and basketball is no different. It is difficult as a young guy to deal with a lot of the pressures that you’re faced with. Whether you’re a guy that comes out of college after one or two years or you’re a four-year senior, when you reach the NBA, there are a lot of financial pressures, a lot of sociological pressures, a lot of familial pressures and I like to think that as a veteran my last few years I was able to help younger guys with some of those issues and make their journey a little less stressful and enjoyable.\n\nDid you have mentors early on who helped shape you before getting to the NBA?\n\nI was so lucky as a high schooler. Growing up in Detroit, I got to be a ballboy for the Detroit Pistons, so in the summer I got the chance to do some really glamorous work while guys like Grant Hill and Allan Houston and Lindsey Hunter and Don Reed and Jerome Williams were working out. I got to mop the floor, fold towels, make Gatorade shakes, rebound for them. Those guys, I developed friendships with them, but more importantly, I saw how they worked, how they conducted themselves. They were pros. They were pro’s pros. Those guys were my role models. So I absolutely believe that it’s important to have role models if you want a long successful career. You need examples to look at and say, “That guy is a pro’s pro and he stuck around in the league and had success for a very good reason.”\n\nI remember getting to the gym, the Pistons’ practice facility, at 8 o’clock and by 8:15 in the morning, Grant Hill was there and Lindsey Hunter was there. Sometimes I got to go through drills with those guys and it was all business. It wasn’t like they were dead serious and no joking around, but when it’s time to work, it’s time to work. I remember being in awe around these guys, but I saw how seriously they took their job, how seriously they took their bodies, working on their game. I’m from Detroit, so I come from a very blue collar mentality and blue collar atmosphere and that was normal to me. That’s how you should act.\n\nDid that experience help you become a mentor as you went through your NBA career?\n\nI felt like I was a mentor my rookie year, to be honest with you. I had a chance to play with Pau Gasol. We got drafted together. Stromile Swift was younger than me, we had a Greek guy named Antonis Fotsis and I came with Will Solomon, so we had a core of young guys. Pau had never been to America before, first time I meant him at the draft was the first time he had been to America, his English was very broken. So he was sort of my mini-project, just to ingratiate him into American culture and try to help him make sense of the crazy NBA world. The only NBA he knew was from television and magazines. That was a responsibility that I knew he wasn’t getting anywhere else so I took it upon myself to be his buddy and help him where I could.\n\nAnd then once that reputation got established — I’ve always been an old soul — and so even when I was a young player, I was one of those guys who seemed to have been around forever. Even my second, third year, whenever a rookie was drafted I tried to take him out to dinner. I tried to give him some heads up on things to look out for.\n\nOne of the things I did later on in my career, whenever a rookie came to our team or a young guy got traded, I gave him the Wall Street Journal’s Primer on Basic Finance. And honestly, most guys don’t know what an interest rate is. Or they don’t know what the Dow Jones is and they’re afraid to ask because it makes them look like an idiot. And so they’d rather just be ignorant and look cool than look silly and ask questions. So I’d say, “Look, I don’t know what your financial background is, just put this on your toilet and every time you’re on the crapper, just read a page. It’s got pictures, it’s got graphs.” It’s a really good primer. You can never be too financially well-educated.\n\nThings like that. I think they go a long ways and if you show your teammates you care about them as a person, you create that connection, it only strengthens your chances of success on the court, which is the name of the game.\n\nYou try to impress on them that it’s all noise, except for when you walk between the lines. You don’t tell a guy what he can and what he can’t do, but you tell him, “Look, when you step between the lines, you have a responsibility to me, you have a responsibility to your teammates, your coaches, yourself, to produce. You have to do what you have to do to prepare for when you come to work. I don’t care what you do when you come, if you get an hour’s sleep. But when that ball’s up in the air, if you’re giving it all you have and you’re helping us win, you can do whatever you want. I don’t really care. I’m not here to judge you. I’m not here to be your babysitter. You have a responsibility to help this team, and you gotta do what you gotta do to do that.”\n\nDeveloping that sense of personal responsibility seems like one of the keys to building chemistry on a team. What else goes into that, into pulling a team together?\n\nAny network that you’re a part of, it starts with a simple connection. I live by an ethos — and my teammates laugh — you can ask any team that I played for, if you say, “Touch the people,” they’ll say, “Oh, Battier.” That was my phrase. You gotta touch the people and sometimes they touch you back. And that’s what I always tried to do with my teammates. I always tried to include them and make them feel like they were part of the team.\n\nI used to run the NCAA pool every march and I used to run the dead man’s pool, the knockout pool in the NFL in the winter. Those took a lot of time. There were other things I could have been doing with my time and my energy instead of going around trying to collect a hundred bucks from everybody and figure out scoring and posting it. But I knew on a Monday, if people were coming in and hooting and hollering about Dwyane Wade’s terrible dead man’s pool pick and the guys get a laugh out of it and razz him, they’re making a connection and that bond between teammates gets just a little stronger. You don’t know where that’s going to come into play. It could be in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals against Boston down 3–2. You’re on the ropes and you need to be able to communicate clearly and succinctly with no time for any B.S. Well, because of all those little strands of connection that have formed over the course of a season, with stupid things like the NCAA tournament and knock-out pools? You suddenly have a strong relationship, a connection, where you can have that real communication that directly translates into you winning that Game 6 in Boston.\n\nOne day analytics will be so advanced that they’ll be able to measure it, but it’s an essential part of team building. You talk about the Warriors, you talk about the Spurs, historically, you ask about them, they’re all friends. They have a connection that extends beyond the court. I had a great coach who said, “Look, you don’t have to be friends with your teammates. This is a business relationship. There has to be respect, a professional respect and a personal respect, but if you’re friends with your teammates, that’s a bonus. But if you have a true relationship, it will grow into a friendship.” I believe when your team is tested and the stresses are the highest, that’s when the connections have to be the strongest and it plays out like that every single year.\n\nWhat’s the relationship between chemistry on the court and a team’s culture, and how do you build the latter out of the former?\n\nIt’s essential if you want to win, if you want to develop something. It’s essential to changing a culture and it’s essential to maintaining a culture. And when you take those players out of a culture, more often than not, that culture goes south. People say, “We need a guy like so-and-so, who just left.” Well, the reason why that guy probably got let go is because his numbers dropped or they weren’t sexy or GMs couldn’t justify his presence on a roster. It’s so funny, when I go back to Houston, I get more people saying, “Man, we never replaced you and your leadership. We love the teams that you played on because they always played with heart and they always played with passion and we always appreciated that. Once they traded you, our team lost something.” That means the world to me, to know that I helped create that."
