        "text": "Matei arrives on the east coast after he scored four times in 13 matches on loan at Astra Giurgiu, who finished fifth in Romania’s Liga 1.\n\nHe had previously struck seven times in 52 games at Rijeka since arriving from the Ukrainian Premier League’s Volyn Lutsk. Italy’s Cesena, plus Romania’s Unirea Urziceni and Steaua Bucharest, also count among his previous employers.\n\nJunior international caps were also won with his nation’s Under-17 (two) and U-19 (three) sides between 2010-11.\n\nHis latest side have secured a one-season contract extension with Vieira, 64, to lead them back into the top flight. The Brazilian took over in January and critically inspired a six-match winning run at the end of the season to pip Diego Maradona’s Fujairah to an automatic spot.\n\nKalba brought in Moroccan attackers Abderrahim Makran and Omar Mansouri on loan for the second half of the season. No announcement has been made about whether the pair will be retained."
