        "text": "Both UAE sides are convinced the ex-Real Sociedad and Almeria assistant can comfortably lead them to safety in next season’s 14-team, expanded top flight. Plus, apply an expansive style of football in the process.\n\nShabab Al Ahli Dubai Club made contact earlier in the summer as they plan a refresh in the wake of a trying inaugural season. However, they are expected to imminently announce a deal for fellow Ittihad alumnus Jose Luis Sierra, 49, of Chile.\n\nBani Yas stormed to the First Division League’s title under Goran Tufegdzic, at the first time of asking following 2016/17’s painful relegation. The Serbian was then immediately dismissed as they targeted a bigger name for the coming season.\n\nAnother ex-Ittihad tactician in Romania’s Victor Piturca is also on the Sky Blues’ wanted list.\n\nCaneda’s other UAE suitor, Emirates Club, came through a trying promotion/relegation play-off against the second tier’s Al Hamriyah earlier this month.\n\nThis tense 1-0 aggregate triumph guaranteed a sixth-successive season in the AGL. Syria’s Nizar Mahrous was drafted in during April as an emergency saviour for the second-bottom Falcons, but is not expected to remain in situ for 2018/19.\n\nThis has opened the door for Caneda in Ras Al Khaimah.\n\nHis last coaching stint was a fourth-month return to Nassr at the end of 2015/16. There, he led a side that had floundered under Italy icon Fabio Cannavaro to a 2-1 loss against Al Ahli Jeddah in the King’s Cup final.\n\nCaneda had previously led the Riyadh heavyweights to 12 victories and one defeat from May 2014-October 2014, before severe internal problems forced his departure.\n\nA similar tale had unfolded at Ittihad from February 2012-February 2013. A club-record 25-match unbeaten spell was achieved, prior to institutional issues causing his contract to be broken.\n\nMeanwhile, promoted Fujairah have sealed the return of midfielder Humaid Ahmed from Al Jazira. Ahmed, 30, made just seven AGL appearances for the capital side after departing the Wolves after 2015/16’s relegation."
