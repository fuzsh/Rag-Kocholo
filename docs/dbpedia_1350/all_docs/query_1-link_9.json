        "text": "Reduced short term memory in congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and its relationship to spatial and quantitative performance.\n\nPubMed\n\nCollaer, Marcia L; Hindmarsh, Peter C; Pasterski, Vickie; Fane, Briony A; Hines, Melissa\n\n2016-02-01\n\nGirls and women with classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) experience elevated androgens prenatally and show increased male-typical development for certain behaviors. Further, individuals with CAH receive glucocorticoid (GC) treatment postnatally, and this GC treatment could have negative cognitive consequences. We investigated two alternative hypotheses, that: (a) early androgen exposure in females with CAH masculinizes (improves) spatial perception and quantitative abilities at which males typically outperform females, or (b) CAH is associated with performance decrements in these domains, perhaps due to reduced short-term-memory (STM). Adolescent and adult individuals with CAH (40 female and 29 male) were compared with relative controls (29 female and 30 male) on spatial perception and quantitative abilities as well as on Digit Span (DS) to assess STM and on Vocabulary to assess general intelligence. Females with CAH did not perform better (more male-typical) on spatial perception or quantitative abilities than control females, failing to support the hypothesis of cognitive masculinization. Rather, in the sample as a whole individuals with CAH scored lower on spatial perception (p â¤ .009), a quantitative composite (p â¤ .036), and DS (p â¤ .001), despite no differences in general intelligence. Separate analyses of adolescent and adult participants suggested the spatial and quantitative effects might be present only in adult patients with CAH; however, reduced DS performance was found in patients with CAH regardless of age group. Separate regression analyses showed that DS predicted both spatial perception and quantitative performance (both p â¤ .001), when age, sex, and diagnosis status were controlled. Thus, reduced STM in CAH patients versus controls may have more general cognitive consequences, potentially reducing spatial perception and quantitative skills.

Aled; Stimson, Roland H.; Walker, Brian R.; Connell, John M. C.; Ross, Richard J.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nContext: No consensus exists for management of adults with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to a paucity of data from cohorts of meaningful size. Objective: Our objective was to establish the health status of adults with CAH. Design and Setting: We conducted a prospective cross-sectional study of adults with CAH attending specialized endocrine centers across the United Kingdom. Patients: Participants included 203 CAH patients (199 with 21-hydroxylase deficiency): 138 women, 65 men, median age 34 (range 18â69) years. Main Outcome Measures: Anthropometric, metabolic, and subjective health status was evaluated. Anthropometric measurements were compared with Health Survey for England data, and psychometric data were compared with appropriate reference cohorts. Results: Glucocorticoid treatment consisted of hydrocortisone (26%), prednisolone (43%), dexamethasone (19%), or a combination (10%), with reverse circadian administration in 41% of patients. Control of androgens was highly variable with a normal serum androstenedione found in only 36% of patients, whereas 38% had suppressed levels suggesting glucocorticoid overtreatment. In comparison with Health Survey for England participants, CAH patients were significantly shorter and had a higher body mass index, and women with classic CAH had increased diastolic blood pressure. Metabolic abnormalities were common, including obesity (41%), hypercholesterolemia (46%), insulin resistance (29%), osteopenia (40%), and osteoporosis (7%). Subjective health status was significantly impaired and fertility compromised. Conclusions: Currently, a minority of adult United Kingdom CAH patients appear to be under endocrine specialist care. In the patients studied, glucocorticoid replacement was generally nonphysiological, and androgen levels were poorly controlled. This was associated with an adverse metabolic profile and impaired fertility and quality of life.

Although cah is widespread in Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), we detected mutations in cah at a frequency of 31.3% in this pathogen. In STEC O157:H7 supershedder strain SS17, a large deletion results in a smaller coding sequence, encoding a protein lacking the C-terminal 71 amino acids compared with Cah in STEC O157:H7 strain EDL933. We examined the function of Cah in biofilm formation and host colonization to better understand the selective pressures for cah mutations. EDL933-Cah played a conditional role in biofilm formation in vitro: it enhanced E. coli DH5Î± biofilm formation on glass surfaces under agitated culture conditions that prevented autoaggregation but inhibited biofilm formation under hydrostatic conditions that facilitated autoaggregation. This function appeared to be strain dependent since Cah-mediated biofilm formation was diminished when an EDL933 cah gene was expressed in SS17. Deletion of cah in EDL933 enhanced bacterial attachment to spinach leaves and altered the adherence pattern of EDL933 to bovine recto-anal junction squamous epithelial (RSE) cells. In contrast, in trans expression of EDL933 cah in SS17 increased its attachment to leaf surfaces, and in DH5Î±, it enhanced its adherence to RSE cells. Hence, the ecological function of Cah appears to be modulated by environmental conditions and other bacterial strain-specific properties. Considering the prevalence of cah in STEC and its role in attachment and biofilm formation, cah mutations might be selected in ecological niches in which inactivation of Cah would result in an increased fitness in STEC during colonization of plants or animal hosts.

However, similar data in adults are lacking. Objective: The objective of the study was to test whether the severity of disease-causing CYP21A2 mutations influences the treatment and health status in adults with CAH. Research Design and Methods: We analyzed the genotype in correlation with treatment and health status in 153 adults with CAH from the United Kingdom Congenital adrenal Hyperplasia Adult Study Executive cohort. Results: CYP21A2 mutations were distributed similarly to previously reported case series. In 7 patients a mutation was identified on only 1 allele. Novel mutations were detected on 1.7% of alleles (5 of 306). Rare mutations were found on 2.3% of alleles (7 of 306). For further analysis, patients were categorized into CYP21A2 mutation groups according to predicted residual enzyme function: null (n = 34), A (n = 42), B (n = 36), C (n = 34), and D (n = 7). Daily glucocorticoid dose was highest in group null and lowest in group C. Fludrocortisone was used more frequently in patients with more severe genotypes. Except for lower female height in group B, no statistically significant associations between genotype and clinical parameters were found. Androgens, blood pressure, lipids, blood glucose, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance were not different between groups. Subjective health status was similarly impaired across groups. Conclusions: In adults with classic CAH and women with nonclassic CAH, there was a weak association between genotype and treatment, but health outcomes were not associated with genotype. The underrepresentation of males with nonclassic CAH may reflect that milder genotypes result in a milder condition that is neither diagnosed nor followed up in adulthood. Overall, our results suggest that the impaired health status of adults with CAH coming to medical attention is\n\nConditional function of autoaggregative protein cah and common cah mutations in Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nCah is a calcium-binding autotransporter protein involved in autoaggregation and biofilm formation.

Mild hyperandrogenemia is the most commonclinical feature in non-classic CAH patients and 95% of the cases are identified by mutations in the CYP21A2 gene. In the present study, the second most common cause for non-classic CAH (NC-CAH), 11Î²-hydroxylase deficiency due to mutations in the CYP11B1 gene, is investigated. Screening of the CYP21A2 and CYP11B1 genes by direct sequencing was carried out for the detection of possible genetic defects in patients with suspected CAH. It wasobserved that CYP11B1 variants co-exist only in rare cases along with mutations in CYP21A2 in patients clinically diagnosed with CAH. A total of 23 NC-CAH female patients out of 75 were identified with only one mutation in the CYP21A2 gene. The novel CYP11B1 gene mutation, p.Val484Asp, was identified in a patient with CAH in the heterozygous state. The structural characterization of the novel p.Val484Asp was found to likely cause distortion of the surrounding beta sheet and indirect destabilization of the cavity that occurs on the opposite face of the structural elements, leading to partial impairment of the enzymatic activity. CYP21A2 gene mutations are the most frequent genetic defects in cases of NC-CAH even when these patients are in the heterozygous state. These mutations have a diverse phenotype giving rise to a variable extent of cortisol synthesis impairment; it is also clear that CYP11B1 mutants are a rare type of defects causing CAH.\n\n42 CFR 495.106 - Incentive payments to CAHs.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2011 CFR\n\n2011-10-01\n\n...

We hypothesized that shorter adults will have more severe underlying disease and worse health outcomes. This was a cross-sectional analysis of 199 adults with CAH. FH and quality of life were expressed as z-scores adjusted for midparental target height or UK population height. FH correlated inversely with age (men, r = -0.38; women, r = -0.26, P < .01). Men and women had z-scores adjusted for midparental target height of -2 and -1, respectively, and both groups had UK population height z-scores of -1 below the UK population (P < .01). In women, FH was shorter in non-salt-wasting than salt-wasting classic CAH (P < .05) and in moderately affected genotype group B women than either more severely affected groups null and A (P < .01) or the mildest group C (P < .001). Short stature and a higher prevalence of hypertension were observed in classic CAH patients diagnosed late (after 1 y) compared with those diagnosed early and in women treated with glucocorticoid only compared with those treated with both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids (P < .05). FH did not associate with insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, adiposity, or quality of life. Adult CAH patients remain short, although height prognosis has improved over time. The shortest adults are those diagnosed late with moderate severity CAH and are at increased risk of adult hypertension; we hypothesize that these patients are exposed in childhood to high androgens and/or excessive glucocorticoids with potential programming of hypertension. Another possibility is inadequate mineralocorticoid treatment early in life in the late-diagnosed patient group. Prospective studies are now required to examine these hypotheses.\n\nManagement issues of congenital adrenal hyperplasia during the transition from pediatric to adult care.\n\nPubMed\n\nChoi, Jin-Ho; Yoo, Han-Wook\n\n2017-02-01\n\nSteroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most prevalent form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), accounting for approximately 95% of cases. With the advent of newborn screening and hormone replacement therapy, most children with CAH survive into adulthood. Adolescents and adults with CAH experience a number of complications, including short stature, obesity, infertility, tumor, osteoporosis, and reduced quality of life. Transition from pediatric to adult care and management of long-term complications are challenging for both patients and health-care providers. Psychosocial issues frequently affect adherence to glucocorticoid treatment. Therefore, the safe transition of adolescents to adult care requires regular follow-up of patients by a multidisciplinary team including pediatric and adult endocrinologists. The major goals for management of adults with 21-hydroxylase deficiency are to minimize the long-term complications of glucocorticoid therapy, reduce hyperandrogenism, prevent adrenal or testicular adrenal rest tumors, maintain fertility, and improve quality of life. Optimized medical or surgical treatment strategies should be developed through coordinated care, both during transition periods and throughout patients' lifetimes. This review will summarize current knowledge on the management of adults with CAH, and suggested appropriate approaches to the transition from pediatric to adult care.\n\nCAH1 and CAH2 as key enzymes required for high bicarbonate tolerance of a novel microalga Dunaliella salina HTBS.\n\nPubMed\n\nHou, Yuyong; Liu, Zhiyong; Zhao, Yue; Chen, Shulin; Zheng, Yubin; Chen, Fangjian\n\n2016-06-01\n\nOutdoor microalgal cultivation with high concentration bicarbonate has been considered as a strategy for reducing contamination and improving carbon supply efficiency. The mechanism responsible for algae's strong tolerance to high bicarbonate however, remains not clear. In this study, we isolated and characterized a strain and revealed its high bicarbonate tolerant mechanism by analyzing carbonic anhydrase (CA). The strain was identified as Dunaliella salina HTBS with broad temperature adaptability (7-30Â°C). The strain grew well under 30% CO2 or 70gL(-1) NaHCO3. In comparison, two periplasm CAs (CAH1 and CAH2) were detected with immunoblotting analysis in HTBS but not in a non-HCO3(-)-tolerant strain. The finding was also verified by an enzyme inhibition assay in which only HTBS showed significant inhibition by extracellular CA inhibitor. Thus, we inferred that the extracellular CAH1 and CAH2 played a multifunctional role in the toleration of high bicarbonate by HTBS. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Goals of treatment are to replace deficient hormones and control androgen excess, while avoiding the adverse effects of exogenous glucocorticoid. Over the last 5 years, cohorts of adults with CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency from Europe and the United States have been described, allowing us to have a better knowledge of long-term complications of the disease and its treatment. Patients with CAH have increased mortality, morbidity and risk for infertility and metabolic disorders. These comorbidities are due in part to the drawbacks of the currently available glucocorticoid therapy. Consequently, novel therapies are being developed and studied in an attempt to improve patient outcomes. New management strategies in the care of pregnancies at risk for congenital adrenal hyperplasia using fetal sex determination and dexamethasone have also been described, but remain a subject of debate. We focused the present overview on the data published in the last 5 years, concentrating on studies dealing with cardiovascular risk, fertility, treatment and prenatal management in adults with classic CAH to provide the reader with an updated review on this rapidly evolving field of knowledge.

Women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) recalled significantly more male-typical play behavior as children than did unaffected women, whereas men with and without CAH did not differ. Women with CAH also reported significantly less satisfaction with the female sex of assignment and less heterosexual interest than did unaffected women. Again, men with CAH did not differ significantly from unaffected men in these respects. Our results for women with CAH are consistent with numerous prior reports indicating that girls with CAH show increased male-typical play behavior. They also support the hypotheses that these women show reduced heterosexual interest and reduced satisfaction with the female sex of assignment. Our results for males are consistent with most prior reports that boys with CAH do not show a general alteration in childhood play behavior. In addition, they provide initial evidence that core gender identity and sexual orientation are unaffected in men with CAH. Finally, among women with CAH, we found that recalled male-typical play in childhood correlated with reduced satisfaction with the female gender and reduced heterosexual interest in adulthood. Although prospective studies are needed, these results suggest that those girls with CAH who show the greatest alterations in childhood play behavior may be the most likely to develop a bisexual or homosexual orientation as adults and to be dissatisfied with the female sex of assignment.\n\nLong term outcomes in 46, XX adult patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia reared as males.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhattab, A; Yau, M; Qamar, A; Gangishetti, P; Barhen, A; Al-Malki, S; Mistry, H; Anthony, W; Toralles, M B; New, Maria I\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPatients with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) owing to 21-hydroxylase deficiency and whose karyotype is 46, XX are usually assigned to the female gender. Reported herein are the long term outcomes in three patients with CAH whose karyotype is 46, XX and who were reared as males. A retrospective review of three CAH patients with a 46, XX karyotype who were reared as males was conducted. Gender assignment, clinical and biochemical data, pre and post-genitoplasty genital examinations were reviewed. Gender identity was tested by an extensive questionnaire. Gender role, sexual preference, marital status and sexual satisfaction were evaluated by interview. The three patients were genotyped for the CYP21A2 gene confirming the diagnosis of CAH. Owing to genital virilization, cultural preferences for male gender and the lack of newborn screening programs the three patients reported herein were assigned to the male gender at birth before the diagnosis of CAH was established. In adulthood the patients remained significantly virilized. Thorough psychosexual assessments in adulthood revealed well established male gender identities compatible with their male gender assignments at birth. In all three patients, gender role and behavior were consistent with male gender identity including sexual intercourse with female partners. The three patients reported herein revealed that male gender assignment to CAH patients with a 46, XX karyotype may have a successful outcome providing there is strong parental support and expert endocrine care. No standard guidelines have been published for the gender assignment of CAH patients with a 46, XX karyotype and genital ambiguity. More studies concerning gender assignment in CAH patients with a 46, XX karyotype reared as males are needed. Copyright ÃÂ© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A.; Van Ryzin, Carol; Nieman, Lynnette K.; Arlt, Wiebke; Merke, Deborah P.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nContext: Treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is suboptimal. Inadequate suppression of androgens and glucocorticoid excess are common and current glucocorticoid formulations cannot replace the cortisol circadian rhythm. Objectives: The primary objective was to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of Chronocort, a modified-release hydrocortisone formulation, in adults with CAH. Secondary objectives included examining disease control following 6 months of Chronocort with dose titration. Design, Setting, and Patients: Sixteen adults (eight females) with classic CAH participated in an open-label, nonrandomized, Phase 2 study at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. Twenty-four-hour blood sampling was performed on conventional glucocorticoids and following 6 months of Chronocort. Chronocort was initiated at 10 mg (0700 h) and 20 mg (2300 h). Dose titration was performed based on androstenedione and 17-hydroxyprogresterone (17-OHP) levels and clinical symptomatology. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was cortisol pharmacokinetics of Chronocort and secondary outcomes included biomarkers of CAH control (androstenedione and 17-OHP). Results: In patients with CAH, Chronocort cortisol profiles were similar to physiologic cortisol secretion. Compared with conventional therapy, 6 months of Chronocort resulted in a decrease in hydrocortisone dose equivalent (28 Â± 11.8 vs 25.9 Â± 7.1 mg/d), with lower 24-hour (P = .004), morning (0700â1500 h; P = .002), and afternoon (1500â2300 h; P = .011) androstenedione area under the curve (AUC) and lower 24-hour (P = .023) and morning (0700â1500 h; P = .02) 17-OHP AUC. Conclusions: Twice-daily Chronocort approximates physiologic cortisol secretion, and was well tolerated and effective in controlling androgen excess in adults with CAH. This novel hydrocortisone formulation represents a new treatment approach for patients with CAH.

This novel hydrocortisone formulation represents a new treatment approach for patients with CAH.\n\nGender Identity in Patients with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia.\n\nPubMed\n\nRazzaghy-Azar, Maryam; Karimi, Sakineh; Shirazi, Elham\n\n2017-07-01\n\nSex assignment in infancy for patients with disorder of sex development (DSD) is a challenging problem. Some of the patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) have DSD that may affect their gender identity. The study aimed to assess gender identity in patients with CAH. In this study, 52 patients with CAH, including 22 prepubertal children and 30 adolescents and adults, were assessed using two separate gender identity questionnaires for children and adults based on the criteria of diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, 5th edition. In the children group, compatibility was seen between gender identity and rearing gender. In the adult group, there were three cases of mismatching between gender identity and sex assignment composed of two females with poor control and one male with good control with 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD). Three girls with 11-hydroxylase deficiency (11-OHD) were reared as boy. Two of them with late diagnosis at 5 and 6 years of age had pseudoprecocious puberty. Parents and children did not accept to change the gender. One of them is 36 years old now, is depressed and unsatisfied with her gender, another girl is still child and has male sexual identity. One girl with 11-OHD and early diagnosis at birth with Prader 5 virilization but with good hormonal control was changed to female gender at 12 years of age when female sexual characteristics appeared; she is 34-years-old now, married, and with two children, and she is satisfied with her gender. In patients with CAH, gender identity disorder is a rare finding. Hormonal control, social, familial, and religious beliefs have impacts on gender identity of these patients.\n\nGender Identity in Patients with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRazzaghy-Azar, Maryam; Karimi, Sakineh; Shirazi, Elham\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground Sex assignment in infancy for patients with disorder of sex development (DSD) is a challenging problem.

Known eukaryotic CCMs consist of inorganic carbon transporters and carbonic anhydrases (and other supporting components) that culminate in elevated [CO 2 ] inside a chloroplastic Rubisco-containing structure called a pyrenoid. We set out to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the CCM in the emerging model photosynthetic stramenopile, Nannochloropsis oceanica , a unicellular picoplanktonic alga that lacks a pyrenoid. We characterized CARBONIC ANHYDRASE 1 ( CAH1 ) as an essential component of the CCM in N. oceanica CCMP1779. We generated insertions in this gene by directed homologous recombination and found that the cah1 mutant has severe defects in growth and photosynthesis at ambient CO 2 We identified CAH1 as an Î±-type carbonic anhydrase, providing a biochemical role in CCM function. CAH1 was found to localize to the lumen of the epiplastid endoplasmic reticulum, with its expression regulated by the external inorganic carbon concentration at both the transcript and protein levels. Taken together, these findings show that CAH1 is an indispensable component of what may be a simple but effective and dynamic CCM in N. oceanica .\n\nA Phase 2 Study of Continuous Subcutaneous Hydrocortisone Infusion in Adults With Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia.\n\nPubMed\n\nNella, Aikaterini A; Mallappa, Ashwini; Perritt, Ashley F; Gounden, Verena; Kumar, Parag; Sinaii, Ninet; Daley, Lori-Ann; Ling, Alexander; Liu, Chia-Ying; Soldin, Steven J; Merke, Deborah P\n\n2016-12-01\n\nClassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) management remains challenging, given that supraphysiologic glucocorticoid doses are often needed to optimally suppress the ACTH-driven adrenal androgen overproduction. This study sought to approximate physiologic cortisol secretion via continuous subcutaneous hydrocortisone infusion (CSHI) and evaluate the safety and efficacy of CSHI in patients with difficult-to-treat CAH. Eight adult patients with classic CAH participated in a single-center open-label phase I-II study comparing CSHI to conventional oral glucocorticoid treatment. All patients had elevated adrenal steroids and one or more comorbidities at study entry. Assessment while receiving conventional therapy at baseline and 6 months following CSHI included: 24-hour hormonal sampling, metabolic and radiologic evaluation, health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL), and fatigue questionnaires. The ability of CSHI to approximate physiologic cortisol secretion and the percent of patients with 0700-hour 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) â¤1200 ng/dL was measured. CSHI approximated physiologic cortisol secretion. Compared with baseline, 6 months of CSHI resulted in decreased 0700-hour and 24-hour area under the curve 17-OHP, androstenedione, ACTH, and progesterone, increased osteocalcin, c-telopeptide and lean mass, and improved HRQoL (and SF-36 Vitality Score), and fatigue. One of three amenorrheic women resumed menses. One man had reduction of testicular adrenal rest tissue. CSHI is a safe and well-tolerated modality of cortisol replacement that effectively approximates physiologic cortisol secretion in patients with classic CAH poorly controlled on conventional therapy. Improved adrenal steroid control and positive effects on HRQoL suggest that CSHI should be considered a treatment option for classic CAH. The long-term effect on established comorbidities requires further study.\n\nUTILIZATION OF TREATABILITY AND PILOT TESTS TO PREDICT CAH BIOREMEDIATION\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nMultiple tools have been suggested to help in the design of enhanced anaerobic bioremediation systems for CAHs:\n\n- Extensive high quality microcosm testing followed by small-scale, thoroughly observed field pilot tests (i.e., RABITT Protocol, Morse 1998)\n\n- More limited ...\n\nEnhanced CAH dechlorination in a low permeability, variably-saturated medium\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nMartin, J.P.; Sorenson, K.S.; Peterson, L.N.; Brennan, R.A.; Werth, C.J.; Sanford, R.A.; Bures, G.H.; Taylor, C.J.; ,\n\n2002-01-01\n\nAn innovative pilot-scale field test was performed to enhance the anaerobic reductive dechlorination (ARD) of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) in a low permeability, variably-saturated formation. The selected technology combines the use of a hydraulic fracturing (fracking) technique with enhanced bioremediation through the creation of highly-permeable sand- and electron donor-filled fractures in the low permeability matrix. Chitin was selected as the electron donor because of its unique properties as a polymeric organic material and based on the results of lab studies that indicated its ability to support ARD. The distribution and impact of chitin- and sand-filled fractures to the system was evaluated using hydrologic, geophysical, and geochemical parameters. The results indicate that, where distributed, chitin favorably impacted redox conditions and supported enhanced ARD of CAHs. These results indicate that this technology may be a viable and cost-effective approach for remediation of low-permeability, variably saturated systems.\n\nQuality of life in adults with congenital adrenal hyperplasia relates to glucocorticoid treatment, adiposity and insulin resistance: United Kingdom Congenital adrenal Hyperplasia Adult Study Executive (CaHASE)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHan, Thang S; Krone, Nils; Willis, Debbie S; Conway, Gerard S; Hahner, Stefanie; Rees, D Aled; Stimson, Roland H; Walker, Brian R; Arlt, Wiebke; Ross, Richard J\n\n2013-01-01\n\nContext Quality of life (QoL) has been variously reported as normal or impaired in adults with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). To explore the reasons for this discrepancy we investigated the relationship between QoL, glucocorticoid treatment and other health outcomes in CAH adults. Methods Cross-sectional analysis of 151 adults with 21-hydroxylase deficiency aged 18â69 years in whom QoL (assessed using the Short Form Health Survey), glucocorticoid regimen, anthropometric and metabolic measures were recorded. Relationships were examined between QoL, type of glucocorticoid (hydrocortisone, prednisolone and dexamethasone) and dose of glucocorticoid expressed as prednisolone dose equivalent (PreDEq). QoL was expressed as z-scores calculated from matched controls (14â430 subjects from UK population). Principal components analysis (PCA) was undertaken to identify clusters of associated clinical and biochemical features and the principal component (PC) scores used in regression analysis as predictor of QoL. Results QoL scores were associated with type of glucocorticoid treatment for vitality (P=0.002) and mental health (P=0.011), with higher z-scores indicating better QoL in patients on hydrocortisone monotherapy (P<0.05). QoL did not relate to PreDEq or mutation severity. PCA identified three PCs (PC1, disease control; PC2, adiposity and insulin resistance and PC3, blood pressure and mutations) that explained 61% of the variance in observed variables. Stepwise multiple regression analysis demonstrated that PC2, reflecting adiposity and insulin resistance (waist circumference, serum triglycerides, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and HDL-cholesterol), related to QoL scores, specifically impaired physical functioning, bodily pain, general health, Physical Component Summary Score (P<0.001) and vitality (P=0.002). Conclusions Increased adiposity, insulin resistance and use of prednisolone or dexamethasone are associated with impaired QoL in adults\n\nA Phase 2 Study of Continuous Subcutaneous Hydrocortisone Infusion in Adults With Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMallappa, Ashwini; Perritt, Ashley F.; Gounden, Verena; Kumar, Parag; Sinaii, Ninet; Daley, Lori-Ann; Ling, Alexander; Liu, Chia-Ying; Soldin, Steven J.; Merke, Deborah P.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nContext: Classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) management remains challenging, given that supraphysiologic glucocorticoid doses are often needed to optimally suppress the ACTH-driven adrenal androgen overproduction.

However, this test produces high rates of false positive results caused by cross reacting steroids. Therefore we have developed a selective and specific method with a short run time (1.25 min) for quantification of 17Î±-hydroxyprogesterone, 21-deoxycortisol, 11-deoxycortisol, 11-deoxycorticosterone and cortisol from dried blood spots. The extraction procedure is very simple and steroid separation is ensured on a BEH C18 column and an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Analysis was done in positive ionization mode (ESI+) and recorded in multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM). The method gave linear results for all steroids over a range of 5-200 (cortisol: 12.5-500)nmol/L with coefficients of regression >0.992. Absolute recovery was >64.1%. Across the analytical range the inter-assay coefficient of variation (CV) was <3%. Newborn blood samples of patients with confirmed 21-CAH and 11-CAH could clearly be distinguished from samples of unaffected newborns falsely positive on immunoassay. The method is not influenced by cross reactions as found on immunoassay. Analysis of dried blood spots shows that this method is sensitive and fast enough to allow rapid analysis and can therefore improve the newborn screening program. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Women who had presented to the Johns Hopkins Hospital Pediatric Endocrine Clinic for treatment of CAH due to 21-OH deficiency were included. The control group consisted of sisters of CAH participants and women referred for evaluation of polycystic ovary syndrome. Study participants were given a questionnaire asking them to indicate their degree of masculinity and femininity during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. In addition, participants were asked questions related to their play behavior during childhood, including playmate preferences, toy preferences, and admiration of male or female characters during fantasy play. Across participant groups, self-reported femininity decreased in a dose response manner, according to prenatal androgen exposure. For all groups, femininity increased through developmental stages. Women with salt-losing CAH remained less feminine than controls into adulthood. Conversely, self-reported masculinity increased in a dose-response manner, according to prenatal androgen exposure, across participant groups. Women with CAH showed a decrease in masculinity across developmental stages, such that by adulthood, there were no significant differences in masculinity between controls and the women with CAH. Women with salt-losing CAH were more likely to recall preferences for boy playmates, male-typical toys, and admiration for male characters during childhood than other study participants. Our data support the effect of both prenatal androgen exposure and socialization on gender role behavior in adult women with CAH due to 21-OH deficiency.\n\nPatient Bypass Behavior and Critical Access Hospitals: Implications for Patient Retention\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nLiu, Jiexin (Jason); Bellamy, Gail R.; McCormick, Melissa\n\n2007-01-01\n\nPurpose: To assess the extent of bypass for inpatient care among patients living in Critical Access Hospital (CAH) service areas, and to determine factors associated with bypass, the reasons for bypass, and what CAHs can do to retain patients locally.

John; Jha, Ashish K.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nContext Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) play a crucial role in the nationâs rural safety net. Current policy efforts have focused primarily on helping these small, isolated hospitals remain financially viable to ensure access for Americans living in rural areas. However, we know little about the quality of care they provide, or the outcomes their patients achieve. Objective To examine the quality of care and patient outcomes at CAHs, and to understand why patterns of care might differ for CAHs versus non-CAHs. Design Retrospective analysis of national data from Medicare and other sources. Setting U.S. hospitals. Patients Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), congestive heart failure (CHF), and pneumonia, discharged in 2008â2009. Main Outcome Measures Clinical capabilities, performance on processes of care, and 30-day mortality rates. Results Compared to other hospitals, CAHs were less likely to have intensive care units (30.0% versus 74.4%, p<0.001), cardiac catheterization capabilities (0.5% versus 47.7%, p<0.001), and at least basic electronic health records (4.6% versus 9.9%, p<0.001). CAHs had lower performance on process measures than non-CAHs for all three conditions examined (Hospital Quality Alliance summary score for AMI 91.0% versus 97.8%, for CHF, 80.6% versus 93.5%, and for pneumonia 89.3% versus 93.7%, p<0.001 for each). Patients admitted to a CAH had higher 30-day mortality rates for each condition than those admitted to non-CAHs (for AMI, 23.5% versus 16.2%, Odds Ratio (OR) 1.70 (95% confidence interval 1.61, 1.80), p<0.001; for CHF, 13.4% versus 10.9%, OR 1.28 (1.23, 1.32), p<0.001; and for pneumonia 14.1% versus 12.1%, OR 1.20 (1.16, 1.24) p<0.001). Conclusions Care in CAHs, compared with non-CAHs, is associated with worse processes of care and higher mortality rates.

With the advent of newborn screening and hormone replacement therapy, most children with CAH survive into adulthood. Adolescents and adults with CAH experience a number of complications, including short stature, obesity, infertility, impaired bone mineral density, and reduced quality of life. Transition from pediatric to adult care and management of long-term complications are challenging for both patients and practitioners. In adulthood, the aims of the medical treatment are to substitute cortisol and, when necessary, aldosterone deficiency, to ensure normal fertility, and to avoid the long-term consequences of glucocorticoid use on bone, metabolism, and cardiovascular risk. Recent data suggest that poor health status is likely to begin in adolescence and persist into adulthood, highlighting the importance of this time period in a patient's endocrine care. During transition from pediatric to adult specific care, a shift in treatment goals is thus needed. Successful transition from pediatric to adult health care requires a regular follow-up of patients by a multidisciplinary team including pediatric endocrinologists, urologists, gynecologists, psychiatrists, and adult endocrinologists. All of this could be included in a specific therapeutic education program regarding transition and/or CAH. Â© 2018 S.

Increased number of comorbidities and frequent use of drugs may contribute to increased risk of hypokalemia in the elderly. This study was performed to investigate the prevalence of community-acquired hypokalemia (CAH), risk factors for its development, related factors with hypokalemia, and morbidities and all-cause mortality rates (MR) of CAH in the elderly patients. Total of 36,361 patients aged above 65Â years were screened retrospectively. Group 1 consisted of 269 elderly patients with potassium level â¤3.5Â mmol/L, and group 2 (control group) consisted of 182 subjects with potassium level between 3.6 and 5.5Â mmol/L. Etiologic factors of CAH, presence of comorbidities, duration of hospital stay, hospital cost, and clinical outcomes were recorded. Prevalence of hypokalemia was found 3.24% in patients aged above 65Â years. Duration of hospital stay, presence of â¥2 comorbid diseases, hospital cost, and MR were significantly higher in group 1 compared to group 2 (pÂ <Â 0.001 for all). Loop diuretics, hydrochlorothiazides, beta agonists, inadequate oral intake, and female gender were all independent risk factors for CAH in elderly patients. Patients with â¥2 comorbid diseases were found to have greater risk of hypokalemia than the patients with <2 comorbidities. Length of hospital stay, hospital cost, and MR were higher in elderly with CAH. Female gender, hydrochlorothiazides, loop diuretics, and â¥2 comorbid diseases are the leading risk factors associated with CAH in elderly.\n\nGrowth and development in children with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\n\nPubMed\n\nBonfig, Walter\n\n2017-02-01\n\nFinal height outcome in classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) has been of interest for many years. With analysis of growth patterns and used glucocorticoid regimens, enhanced treatment strategies have been developed and are still under development. Most of the current reports on final height outcome are confirmative of previous results. Final height data is still reported in cohorts that were diagnosed clinically and not by newborn screening. Clinical diagnosis of CAH leads to delayed diagnosis especially of simple virilizing CAH with significantly advanced bone age resulting in early pubertal development and reduced final height. In contrast salt-wasting CAH is diagnosed at an earlier stage in most cases resulting in better final height outcome in some cohorts. Nevertheless, final height outcome in patients with CAH treated with glucocorticoids is lower than the population norm and also at the lower end of genetic potential. Achievement of regular adult height is still a challenge with conventional glucocorticoid treatment in patients with CAH, which is why new hydrocortisone formulations and new treatment options for CAH are underway.\n\n42 CFR 409.68 - Guarantee of payment for inpatient hospital or inpatient CAH services furnished before...\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-10-01\n\n...

The PFM was originally developed and applied to measurements near source zones. The focus of the PFM is extended from near source to plume zones. For this purpose, 48 PFMs of 1.4 m length were constructed and installed in eight different monitoring wells in the source and plume zone of a CAH-contaminated field site located in France. The PFMs were retrieved, sampled, and analyzed after 3 to 11 weeks of exposure time, depending on the expected contaminant flux. PFM evaluation criteria include analytical, technical, and practical aspects as well as conditions and applicability. PFM flux data were compared with so-called traditional soil and groundwater concentration data obtained using active sampling methods. The PFMs deliver reasonable results for source as well as plume zones. The limiting factor in the PFM applicability is the exposure time together with the groundwater flux. Measured groundwater velocities at the field site range from 2 to 41 cm/day. Measured contaminant flux data raise up to 13 g/m(2)/day for perchloroethylene in the plume zone. Calculated PFM flux averaged concentration data and traditional concentration data were of similar magnitude for most wells. However, both datasets need to be compared with reservation because of the different sampling nature and time. Two important issues are the PFM tracer loss during installation/extraction and the deviation of the groundwater flow field when passing the monitoring well and PFM. The demonstration of the PFM at a CAH-contaminated field site in Europe confirmed the efficiency of the flux measurement technique for source as well as plume zones. The PFM can be applied without concerns in monitoring wells with European standards.

CAH-X CH-1 has a TNXB exon 35 120-bp deletion resulting in haploinsufficiency, and CAH-X CH-2 has a TNXB exon 40 c.12174C>G (p.Cys4058Trp) variant resulting in a dominant-negative effect. We present here three patients with biallelic CAH-X and identify a novel dominant-negative chimera termed CAH-X CH-3. Compared with monoallelic CAH-X, biallelic CAH-X results in a more severe phenotype with skin features characteristic of classical EDS. We present evidence for disrupted tenascin-X function and computational data linking the type of TNXB variant to disease severity.

This study was performed to investigate the risk of CAH in elderly and evaluate the related factors and clinical outcomes. Study design, setting and participants, intervention: Patients (aged â¥65 years) with hyperkalemia were screened. Group 1 (young-old); 65-74 years/old, Group 2 (middle-old); 75-84 years/old, Group 3 (oldest-old); â¥85 years/old, and Group 4 (control group); â¥65 years/old (normal serum potassium levels). The relation between CAH and hospital expenses (HE), the number of comorbid diseases (NCD), and all-cause of mortality rates (MR) were evaluated. We also investigated whether drugs, sex, and NCD are risk factors for the development of CAH. There was a positive correlation between serum potassium levels and length of hospital stay, MR, HE, and NCD (pâ<â0.001). Risk factors for CAH were the use of non-steroidal-anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Odds Ratio [OR]: 2.679), spironolactone (OR: 2.530), and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) (OR: 2.242), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) (OR: 2.679), â¥2 comorbid diseases (OR: 2.221), female gender (OR: 2.112), and renal injury (OR: 5.55). CAH risk was found to be increased 30.03 times when any of ACEI, ARB, NSAIDs, or spironolactone is given to a patient with a renal injury. Use of NSAIDs, ACEI, ARB, spironolactone and increased NCD are all independent risk factors for CAH in the elderly, especially in patients with kidney diseases.\n\n42 CFR 409.12 - Nursing and related services, medical social services; use of hospital or CAH facilities.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2013 CFR\n\n2013-10-01\n\n... 42 Public Health 2 2013-10-01 2013-10-01 false Nursing and related services, medical social...

Compound heterozygotes are common and express phenotypes of varying severity. The objective of this case report was to investigate the hormonal pattern and unusual genetic profile in a 7-year-old boy who presented with pubic hair, acne, an enlarged phallus, slightly increased testicular volume and advanced bone age. Clinical, hormonal and genetic studies were undertaken in the patient as well as his parents. We found elevated serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) and androstenedione that were suppressed with dexamethasone, and elevated testosterone that actually rose after giving dexamethasone, indicating activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. An initial search for common mutations was negative, but a more detailed genetic analysis of the CYP21A2 gene revealed two mutations including R341W, a non-classical mutation inherited from his mother, and g.823G>A, a novel not previously reported consensus donor splice site mutation inherited from his father, which is predicted to be salt wasting. However, the child had a normal plasma renin activity. He was effectively treated with low-dose dexamethasone and a GnRH agonist. His father was an unaffected carrier, but his mother had evidence of mild non-classical CAH. In a male child presenting with gonadotropin independent SP it is important to investigate adrenal function with respect to the androgen profile, and to carry out appropriate genetic studies.\n\nGuidelines for the Development of Comprehensive Care Centers for Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia: Guidance from the CARES Foundation Initiative\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAuchus, Richard J.; Witchel, Selma Feldman; Leight, Kelly R.; Aisenberg, Javier; Azziz, Ricardo; Bachega, TÃ¢nia A.; Baker, Linda A.; Baratz, Arlene B.; Baskin, Laurence S.; Berenbaum, Sheri A.; Breault, David T.; Cerame, Barbara I.; Conway, Gerard S.; Eugster, Erica A.; Fracassa, Stephanie; Gearhart, John P.; Geffner, Mitchell E.; Harris, Katharine B.; Hurwitz, Richard S.; Katz, Aviva L.; Kalro, Brinda N.; Lee, Peter A.; Alger Lin, Gretchen; Loechner, Karen J.; Marshall, Ian; Merke, Deborah P.; Migeon, Claude J.; Miller, Walter L.; Nenadovich, Tamara L.; Oberfield, Sharon E.; Pass, Kenneth A.; Poppas, Dix P.; Lloyd-Puryear, Michele A.; Quigley, Charmian A.; Riepe, Felix G.; Rink, Richard C.; Rivkees, Scott A.; Sandberg, David E.; Schaeffer, Traci L.; Schlussel, Richard N.; Schneck, Francis X.; Seely, Ellen W.; Snyder, Diane; Speiser, Phyllis W.; Therrell, Bradford L.; VanRyzin, Carol; Vogiatzi, Maria G.; Wajnrajch, Michael P.; White, Perrin C.; Zuckerman, Alan E.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nPatients with rare and complex diseases such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) often receive fragmented and inadequate care unless efforts are coordinated among providers. Translating the concepts of the medical home and comprehensive health care for individuals with CAH offers many benefits for the affected individuals and their families. This manuscript represents the recommendations of a 1.5 day meeting held in September 2009 to discuss the ideal goals for comprehensive care centers for newborns, infants, children, adolescents, and adults with CAH. Participants included pediatric endocrinologists, internal medicine and reproductive endocrinologists, pediatric urologists, pediatric surgeons, psychologists, and pediatric endocrine nurse educators. One unique aspect of this meeting was the active participation of individuals personally affected by CAH as patients or parents of patients. Representatives of Health Research and Services Administration (HRSA), New York-Mid-Atlantic Consortium for Genetics and Newborn Screening Services (NYMAC), and National Newborn Screening and Genetics Resource Center (NNSGRC) also participated. Thus, this document should serve as a âroadmapâ for the development phases of comprehensive care centers (CCC) for individuals and families affected by CAH.

Many atoms lend themselves to such a closed-loop cooling cycle. Attaining laser-cooled molecular species is challenging because of their inherently complex internal structure, yet laser-cooling molecules could lead to studies in interesting chemical dynamics among other applications. Typically, laser-cooled atoms are assembled into molecules through photoassociation or Feschbach resonance. CaH is one of a few molecules whose internal structure is quite atom-like, allowing a nearly closed cycle without the need for many repumping lasers. We will also present our work-to-date on laser cooling this molecule. We employ traditional pulsed atomic/molecular beam techniques with a laser vaporization source to generate species with well-defined translational energies over a narrow range of velocity. In this way, we can apply laser-cooling to most species in the beam along a single dimension (the beam's axis). This project is funded by the LDRD program of the Los Alamos National Laboratory.\n\nTransformation rules and degradation of CAHs by Fentonlike oxidation in growth ring of water distribution network-A review\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhong, D.; Ma, W. C.; Jiang, X. Q.; Yuan, Y. X.; Yuan, Y.; Wang, Z. Q.; Fang, T. T.; Huang, W. Y.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nChlorinated hydrocarbons are widely used as organic solvent and chemical raw materials. After treatment, water polluted with trichloroethylene (TCE)/tetrachloroethylene (PCE) can reach the water quality requirements, while water with trace amounts of TCE/PCE is still harmful to humans, which will cause cancers. Water distribution network is an extremely complicated system, in which adsorption, desorption, flocculation, movement, transformation and reduction will occur, leading to changes of TCE/PCE concentrations and products. Therefore, it is important to investigate the transformation rules of TCE/PCE in water distribution network. Whatâs more, growth-ring, including drinking water pipes deposits, can act as catalysts in Fenton-like reagent (H2O2). This review summarizes the status of transformation rules of CAHs in water distribution network. It also evaluates the effectiveness and fruit of CAHs degradation by Fenton-like reagent based on growth-ring. This review is important in solving the potential safety problems caused by TCE/PCE in water distribution network.\n\nShould we question early feminizing genitoplasty for patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia and XX karyotype?\n\nPubMed\n\nBinet, A; Lardy, H; Geslin, D; Francois-Fiquet, C; Poli-Merol, M L\n\n2016-03-01\n\nThere is a wide difference of opinion between the medical-surgical community and advocacy group regarding Disorders of Sexual Development (DSD) secondary to congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) being ranked in the intersex category. This rupture is even more evident when the issue of genitoplasty is brought up. For physicians it is obvious and unequivocal that a person with CAH and an XX karyotype has a female gender identity, whereas associations tend to rank persons with CAH in the intersex category and advocate holding-off on surgical management. A retrospective case study vs. control group, spanning over 40years, included 21 patients who were treated in 3 different centers. Each patient and their parents were contacted independently and interviewed regarding interpersonal relationships, psychological impact of genitoplasty, gender identity and opinion on optimal care management for this disorder. Three couples controls (parent-child) per CAH patients were used and matched according to age, sex assigned at birth and ethnic origin. Sex assigned at birth seemed to concord with the gender identity perceived by the patients in 85.7% of cases. In fact, 89.7% of patients and 100% of parents felt that feminizing genitoplasty should be performed within the first year of life. There is however a significant difference compared to controls who felt that surgical management should occur later on in life. No difference was highlighted during childhood regarding parents-child relationships or social integration. However, during adolescence, the parents-child relationship tended to be significantly more painful for the CAH group. Integrating their parenting role was significantly harder for patients in the CAH-DSD group. In the population of CAH-DSD patients who had genitoplasty the level of sexual fulfillment was not lower to the one reported by the control group. Female sex assignment seems legitimate according to this study and the development of gender identity in these\n\nLaser Spectroscopic Study of CaH in the B^2Ï^+ and D^2Ï^+ States\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWatanabe, Kyohei; Uchida, Kanako; Kobayashi, Kaori; Matsushima, Fusakazu; Moriwaki, Yoshiki\n\n2015-06-01\n\nCalcium hydride is one of the abundant molecules in the stellar environment, and is considered as a probe of stellar analysis. Ab initio calculations have shown that the electronic excited states of CaH have complex potential curves. It is suggested that the B^2Ï^+ state has an interesting double minimum potential due to the avoided crossing. Such a potential leads to drastic change of the rotational constants when the vibrational energy level goes across the potential barrier. Spectroscopic studies on CaH began in the 1920's, and many studies have been carried out since then. Bell et al. extensively assigned the D^2Ï^+-X^2Ï^+ bands in the UV region. Bernath's group has observed transitions in the IR and visible regions and identified their upper states as the A^2Ï^+, B^2Ï^+ and E^2Ï^+ states. We have carried out a laser induced fluorescence (LIF) study in the UV region between 360 and 430 nm. We have produced CaH by using laser ablation of a calcium target in a hydrogen gas environment, then molecules have been excited by a second harmonic pulse of dye laser and the fluorescence from molecules have been detected through a monochromator. Detection of the D^2Ï^+-X^2Ï^+ bands already identified by Bell et al. indicates the production of CaH. In addition, many other bands have been also found and a few bands have been assigned by using the combination differences, the lower state of these bands have been confirmed to the vibrational ground state of X^2Ï^+ state. We have tentatively assigned these bands as the B^2Ï^+ -X^2Ï^+ transition. We will discuss the assignment of these bands, together with the rotational constants comparing with those calculated from the ab initio potential. B. Barbuy, R. P. Schiavon, J. Gregorio-Hetem, P. D.

In this study we examine the effect of GH therapy on height prediction in children with both CAH and compromised height prediction. Leuprolide acetate, a GnRH analog (GnRHa), was given to patients with evidence of early puberty. GH (n = 12) or the combination of GH and GnRHa (n = 8) was administered to 20 patients with CAH while they continued therapy with glucocorticoids. Each patient in the treatment group was matched according to age, sex, bone age, puberty, and type of CAH with another CAH patient treated only with glucocorticoid replacement. The match was made at the start of GH treatment. Of the 20 patients, 12 have completed 2 yr of therapy. After 1 yr of GH or combination GH and GnRHa therapy, the mean growth rate increased from 5 +/- 1.9 to 7.8 +/- 1.6 cm/yr vs. 5.4 +/- 1.7 to 5 +/- 2 cm/yr in the group not receiving GH (P < 0.0001). During the second year of treatment, the mean growth rate was 6 +/- 1.6 vs. 4.2 +/- 2.1 cm/yr in the group not receiving GH (P < 0.001). The height SD score for chronological age in the treatment group at the end of 1 and 2 yr of treatment improved significantly more than the nontreatment group (P < 0.01). A similar improvement in the height SD score for bone age was found in the treatment group after 1 (-1.4 +/- 0.9 vs. -1.7 +/- 0.9; P < 0.0001) and 2 yr of therapy (-0.67 +/- 0.68 vs. -1.7 +/- 1.2; P < 0.0004). The mean predicted adult height improved from 159 +/- 11 (baseline) to 170 +/- 7.5 cm (after 2 yr of therapy) closely approximating target height (173 +/- 8 cm). All patients continued the hydrocortisone treatment. In patients with CAH and compromised height prediction, treatment with GH or the combination of GH and GnRHa results in an improvement of growth rate and height prediction and a reduction in height deficit for bone age.\n\nEinstein A coefficients for rovibronic lines of the A2Î â X2Î£+ and B2Î£+ â X2Î£+ transitions of CaH and CaD\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAlavi, S. Fatemeh; Shayesteh, Alireza\n\n2018-02-01\n\nCalcium monohydride is an important diatomic molecule appearing in the spectra of sunspots and M dwarfs. We report complete line lists with Einstein A coefficients for the A2Î -X2Î£+ and B2Î£+-X2Î£+ electronic transitions of CaH and CaD radicals. The most recent ab initio transition dipole moments and potential energy curves were used for the calculation of vibronic band intensities, taking the Herman-Wallis effect into account, and the rotational line strengths were calculated using the PGOPHER program of Western. For the A2Î and B2Î£+ excited states of CaH and CaD, new off-diagonal electronic matrix elements were included in the Hamiltonian matrix, and new sets of spectroscopic constants were determined in order to accurately reproduce the line positions and relative intensities of the observed branches in laboratory spectra. For both CaH and CaD isotopologues, Einstein A coefficients were calculated for all possible rovibronic transitions from the vÎ = 0-3 vibrational levels of the A2Î state and the vÎ = 0-2 vibrational levels of the B2Î£+ state to the vâ³ = 0-4 vibrational levels of the X2Î£+ ground state. The line lists and intensities reported here can be used to accurately determine the amounts of CaH and CaD in stellar environments.\n\nStructure and stability of CaH 2 surfaces: on the possibility of electron-rich surfaces in metal hydrides for catalysis\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nOng, Phuong-Vu; Johnson, Lewis E.; Hosono, Hideo\n\nStructure, thermodynamic stability, and electronic properties of CaH 2 surfaces in (001),(110), and (111) crystallographic orientations are investigated using ab initio modeling. We show that stoichiometric surfaces terminated with a hydrogen atomic plane are the most energetically favorable and discuss properties of hydrogen vacancies (VH) at these surfaces. The average calculated work function of the most stable pristine surfaces (~5.2 eV) is in agree-ment with experimental data for powder samples. Neutral hydrogen vacancies host localized electrons and induce defect states in the band gap, thereby shifting the effective work function to much lower values of ~2.7 eV. Surface VH aremoreÂ Â» predicted to aggregate into dimers and form electron-rich centers (e -)Ca 2+(e -) stable to over 800 K. These results suggest that hydrogen-deficient surfaces of CaH 2 can host a large concentration of localized electrons and, thus, give rise to new catalytic functionalities involving electron transfer between the surface, catalysts supported on it, and reacting species.Â«Â less\n\nDECHLORINATION OF PCBS, CAHS, HERBICIDES AND PESTICIDES NEAT AND IN SOILS AT 25&DEG;C USING NA/NH3.

Apart from karyotype, prenatal androgen exposure, patient's gender orientation, sociocultural, and parental influences play a role. The aim of this study was to assess gender dysphoria and psychosocial issues in patients of CAH raised as males and females. Materials and Methods: This is a cross-sectional study that includes patients (old and new) with CAH who were treated by us in the last 6 months. A semi-structured interview proforma was used to elicit history and psychosocial background of the patients. The clinical and biochemical details were noted. For psychological analysis, patients were screened for gender dysphoria using Parent Report Gender Identity Questionnaire for children <12 years and Gender Identity/Gender Dysphoria Questionnaire for Adolescents and Adults. Results: We analyzed 22 46 XX CAH patients among which, 3 were reared as males and 19 as females. Among the 19 patients reared as females, 17 patients showed no gender dysphoria. Two patients revealed gender dysphoria as indicated by their marginally low scores on the gender dysphoria assessment. However, in view of current literature and the age groups of the patients, behavior of the 6-year-old patient can be best understood as being tomboyish. Gender dysphoria in the 22-year-old can be explained by the dominance of psychosocial factors and not hormones alone. Among the three patients reared as males, two prepubertal were satisfied with their male gender identity. The third patient, aged 32 years, had gender dysphoria when reared as a male that resolved when gender was reassigned as female and feminizing surgery was done. Conclusion: Gender assignment in 46 XX CAH is guided by factors such as degree of virilization of genitalia, gender orientation, patient involvement, sociocultural, and parental influences.

Rural residents have limited access to trauma care, and telemedicine has been proposed as one strategy to improve the provision of trauma care locally. The objective of this study was to describe patient-level factors associated with telemedicine consultation in North Dakota critical-access hospital (CAH) emergency departments (EDs) and to measure the association between telemedicine consultation and interhospital transfer. Observational cohort study of all adult (ageÂ â¥Â 18Â years) trauma patients treated in North Dakota CAH EDs with an active telemedicine subscription between 2008 and 2014. Trauma cases were identified from the North Dakota Trauma Registry, and telemedicine-enabled care was determined using a probabilistic linking algorithm with the call records of the predominant telemedicine network in North Dakota. Multivariable generalized estimating equations were used to identify factors associated with telemedicine consultation and to measure the association between telemedicine consultation and interhospital transfer, adjusting for patient, injury, and hospital factors. Of the 9,281 North Dakota trauma patients seen in CAHs, 2,837 were treated in an ED with an active telemedicine subscription. Telemedicine was consulted for 11% of all trauma patients in telemedicine-capable EDs. Factors associated with telemedicine consultation included higher Injury Severity Score, penetrating injuries, burns, hypotension, tachycardia, and ambulance transport. Adjusting for severity of illness, injury mechanism, and type of injury, telemedicine use was not associated with interhospital transfer (adjusted odds ratioÂ =Â 1.28, 95% confidence intervalÂ =Â 0.94 to 1.75). Emergency department-based telemedicine consultation is requested for the most severely injured rural trauma patients, especially with those with penetrating trauma, burns\n\nShorter survival in adolescent and young adult patients, compared to adult patients, with stage IV colorectal cancer in Japan.\n\nPubMed\n\nShida, Dai; Ahiko, Yuka; Tanabe, Taro; Yoshida, Takefumi; Tsukamoto, Shunsuke; Ochiai, Hiroki; Takashima, Atsuo; Boku, Narikazu; Kanemitsu, Yukihide\n\n2018-03-27\n\nThe incidence of colorectal cancer in adolescent and young adult patients is increasing.

Subjects were 861 consecutive patients who were diagnosed with stage IV colorectal cancer at the age of 15 to 74Â years and who were referred to the division of surgery or gastrointestinal oncology at the National Cancer Center Hospital from 1999 to 2013. Overall survival (OS) was investigated and clinicopathological variables were analyzed for prognostic significance. Of these, 66 (8%) were adolescent and young adult patients and 795 (92%) were adult patients. Median survival time was 13.6Â months in adolescent and young adult patients and 22.4Â months in adult patients, and 5-year OS rates were 17.3% and 20.3%, respectively, indicating significant worse prognosis of adolescent and young adult patients (pâ=â0.042). However, age itself was not an independent factor associated with prognosis by multivariate analysis. When compared with adult patients, adolescent and young adult patients consisted of higher proportion of the patients who did not undergo resection of primary tumor, which was an independent factor associated with poor prognosis in multivariate analysis. In patients who did not undergo resection (nâ=â349), OS of adolescent and young adult patients were significantly worse (pâ=â0.033). Prognoses were worse in adolescent and young adult patients with stage IV colorectal cancer compared to adult patients in Japan, due to a higher proportion of patients who did not undergo resection with more advanced and severe disease, but not due to age itself.\n\nLipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to STAR mutations in a Caucasian patient.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaur, Jasmeet; Casas, Luis; Bose, Himangshu S\n\n2016-01-01\n\nLipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia (lipoid CAH), the most severe form of CAH, is most commonly caused by mutations in steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR), which is required for the movement of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membranes to synthesize pregnenolone. This study was performed to evaluate whether the salt-losing crisis and the adrenal inactivity experienced by a Scandinavian infant is due to a de novo STAR mutation. The study was conducted at the University of North Dakota, the Mercer University School of Medicine and the Memorial University Medical Center to identify the cause of this disease. The patient was admitted to a pediatric endocrinologist at the Sanford Health Center for salt-losing crisis and possible adrenal failure. Lipoid CAH is an autosomal recessive disease, we identified two de novo heterozygous mutations (STAR c.444C>A (STAR p.N148K) and STAR c.557C>T (STAR p.R193X)) in the STAR gene, causing lipoid CAH. New onset lipoid CAH can occur through de novo mutations and is not restricted to any specific region of the world. This Scandinavian family was of Norwegian descent and had lipoid CAH due to a mutation in S TAR exons 4 and 5. Overexpression of the STAR p.N148K mutant in nonsteroidogenic COS-1 cells supplemented with an electron transport system showed activity similar to the background level, which was â¼10% of that observed with wild-type (WT) STAR. Protein-folding analysis showed that the finger printing of the STAR p.N148K mutant is also different from the WT protein. Inherited STAR mutations may be more prevalent in some geographical areas but not necessarily restricted to those regions. STAR mutations cause lipoid CAH.This is a pure population from a caucasian family.Mutation ablated STAR activity.The mutation resulted in loosely folded conformation of STAR.\n\nComplete virilization in congenital adrenal hyperplasia: clinical course, medical management and disease-related complications.\n\nPubMed\n\nWoelfle, J; Hoepffner, W; Sippell, W G; BrÃ¤mswig, J H; Heidemann, P; Deiss, D; BÃ¶kenkamp, A; Roth, C; Irle, U; Wollmann, H A; Zachmann, M; Kubini, K; Albers, N\n\n2002-02-01\n\nadult patients. Patients tended to follow height percentiles of genetic females. One pubertal patient was suicidal due to short stature. (4) Central precocious puberty (CPP): prolonged exposition to adrenal androgens led to CPP in one patient. He was treated with GnRH analogues until gonadectomy. Patients with CAH and complete virilization have a high risk of being diagnosed late. There are major problems and uncertainties of the patients' families and the treating physicians concerning gender assignment. Gender identity is disturbed in some patients. In addition, multiple surgical procedures are necessary and short stature as well as central precocious puberty might be important to avoid late sequelae. While some surgical interventions are probably unavoidable, most of these issues could be resolved with an early diagnosis. Thus, especially for these patients, a neonatal screening programme for CAH would be of paramount importance.\n\nNeutron production at 0Â° from the 40Ca+H reaction at Elab=357A and 565A MeV\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTuvÃ¨, C.; Albergo, S.; Boemi, D.; Caccia, Z.; Chen, C.-X.; Costa, S.; Crawford, H.

V.; Soutoul, A.; Testard, O.; Tull, C. E.; Waddington, C. J.; Webber, W. R.; Wefel, J. P.\n\n1997-08-01\n\nNeutrons produced in the 40Ca+H reaction at Elab=357A and 565A MeV have been detected using a three-module version of the multifunctional neutron spectrometer MUFFINS. The detector covered a narrow angular range around the beam in the forward direction (0Â°-3.2Â°). Semi-inclusive neutron production cross sections, at the two energies, are reported together with neutron energy spectra, angular, rapidity, and transverse momentum distributions. Comparison with a Boltzmann-Nordheim-Vlasov approach + phase space coalescence model is discussed.\n\nCa(AlH4)2, CaAlH5, and CaH2+6LiBH4: Calculated dehydrogenation enthalpy, including zero point energy, and the structure of the phonon spectra.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarashdeh, Ali; Frankcombe, Terry J\n\n2008-06-21\n\nThe dehydrogenation enthalpies of Ca(AlH(4))(2), CaAlH(5), and CaH(2)+6LiBH(4) have been calculated using density functional theory calculations at the generalized gradient approximation level. Harmonic phonon zero point energy (ZPE) corrections have been included using Parlinski's direct method. The dehydrogenation of Ca(AlH(4))(2) is exothermic, indicating a metastable hydride. Calculations for CaAlH(5) including ZPE effects indicate that it is not stable enough for a hydrogen storage system operating near ambient conditions. The destabilized combination of LiBH(4) with CaH(2) is a promising system after ZPE-corrected enthalpy calculations. The calculations confirm that including ZPE effects in the harmonic approximation for the dehydrogenation of Ca(AlH(4))(2), CaAlH(5), and CaH(2)+6LiBH(4) has a significant effect on the calculated reaction enthalpy. The contribution of ZPE to the dehydrogenation enthalpies of Ca(AlH(4))(2) and CaAlH(5) calculated by the direct method phonon analysis was compared to that calculated by the frozen-phonon method. The crystal structure of CaAlH(5) is presented in the more useful standard setting of P2(1)c symmetry and the phonon density of states of CaAlH(5), significantly different to other common complex metal hydrides, is rationalized.\n\nCa(AlH4)2, CaAlH5, and CaH2+6LiBH4: Calculated dehydrogenation enthalpy, including zero point energy, and the structure of the phonon spectra\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMarashdeh, Ali; Frankcombe, Terry J.\n\n2008-06-01\n\nThe dehydrogenation enthalpies of Ca(AlH4)2, CaAlH5, and CaH2+6LiB"
