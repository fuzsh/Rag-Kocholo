        "text": "Both the French and British set up colonies in Canada, but in by 1763, the British had gained control over all of New France. Upper and Lower Canada (Ontario and Quebec) were united as the Province of Canada on February 5, 1841, and the Dominion of Canada was established on July 1, 1867.\n\nThe French Colonial Franc (XFCL) and British Pound Sterling (GBP) were used in Canada during colonial times. The French Colonial Livre traded at a 20% premium from July 18, 1654 until October 7, 1661, at a 33.3% premium until March 2, 1662, and a 50% premium thereafter. The New France government often issued playing cards as money. The first French coins were minted in Canada in 1670 and continued to be issued until 1760. Nevertheless, French, English, Dutch, Spanish and US coins circulated through the nineteenth century. Private token, minted in Britain were used in Canada until 1858. Nova Scotia (1823), New Brunswick (1843), Prince Edward Island (1871) and Newfoundland (1840) issued coins and tokens of their own. The first coins issued for Canada were minted in 1858, although technically this was a provincial issue for Canada (Ontario and Quebec). The first coins issued for the Dominion of Canada were struck in 1870 and were similar to US coins.\n\nCanada adopted the Dollar as its currency on January 1, 1858 setting the Canadian Dollar, divisible into 100 Cents, and equal to the United States Dollar. Canada allowed private banks it issue banknotes until 1935 when the Bank of Canada gained a monopoly over the right to issue banknotes. Until 1912, the Dominion of Canada issued all banknotes under $5 and private banks issued all banknotes of $5 or more, leading to the issue of $4 notes. Many of the banknotes issued by chartered banks prior to 1935 are still redeemable. Canada left the Gold Standard on October 19, 1931.\n\nSee separate histories for Newfoundland and St. Pierre et Miquelon."
