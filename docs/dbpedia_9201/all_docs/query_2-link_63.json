        "text": "Unveiled in 1924 to commemorate the Dominion of Newfoundland’s contributions to the First World War, the Newfoundland National War Memorial is an imposing monument and an early example of modern war memorials featuring both allegorical and realistic bronze sculptures. Designed by British artists Gilbert Bayes and Ferdinand Victor Blundstone, its design elevates an allegorical female sculpture, often referred to as Victory, Liberty, or the Spirit of Newfoundland, over figures representing the Newfoundland Royal Naval Reserve, Royal Newfoundland Regiment, Forestry Corps, and Merchant Marine. Located next to where Newfoundland and Labrador soldiers departed and returned from the First World War, it is a physical and visual landmark in downtown St. John’s.\n\nThe five bronze sculptures sit on a large granite base, with the largest standing atop the central pedestal, holding a flaming torch in her left hand high above her head. The torch, which symbolizes freedom, is the memorial’s highest point, prioritizing freedom as a central motivation for Newfoundland’s wartime contributions. In her right hand, she holds a sword which represents both Newfoundland’s willingness to serve during the First World War and loyalty to the British Empire. The sword is below her waist, but not completely lowered as it is poised for battle, which is meant to depict that while the war is over, Newfoundland was, and is, ready and willing to fight for its freedom and liberty. On the front of the monument, below the figures, are five plaques commemorating Newfoundland’s contributions in different conflicts. In the centre, the original plaque from 1924 honours those who served during the First World War. Plaques commemorating the service of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians in the Second World War, Korean War, Afghanistan, and War of 1812 have been added.\n\nThe monument was made possible in part by a community fundraising effort where the sale of one dollar shares raised $20,000. This campaign connected the community to not only the memorial, but also to Newfoundland and Labrador’s fallen soldiers. The Great War Veterans Association and a committee led by military chaplain Thomas Nangle organized the July 1, 1924, unveiling ceremony, which included a speech from Field Marshal Douglas Haig and attracted 20,000 people. The unveiling date was selected because July 1 is Memorial Day in Newfoundland and Labrador, commemorating the Battle of Beaumont Hamel, the deadliest day for the Royal Newfoundland Regiment during the First World War.\n\nThe monument sits between Water and Duckworth streets. While the city’s natural topography slopes towards St. John’s Harbour, the grade at the site was altered during construction, which gives the memorial a grand appearance when seen from the water. The torch atop the monument was originally intended to be a leading light for ships entering St. John’s Harbour through the Narrows, although it was never used as such. The Newfoundland National War Memorial is the site of annual ceremonies that take place Remembrance Day and Memorial Day.\n\n- 30 -"
