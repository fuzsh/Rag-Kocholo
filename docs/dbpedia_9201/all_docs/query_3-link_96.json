        "text": "1842\n\nApril 27\n\nThe Currency Act of 1841 comes into effect, making legal tender the British sovereign, and the American eagle ($10), dollar, and half-dollar coins. French crowns and half-crowns are no longer legal tender. [169.230] [1003.36]\n\n1850\n\nInspector-General for the Province of Canada, Francis Hincks, introduces a bill in Parliament, to amend the Currency Act of 1841, giving the Governor General the power to have coins struck for circulation in Canada. [306.133] [571.26]\n\nThe parliament of the Province of Canada passes acts 13 and 14 to amend the Currency Act, allowing authorized banks to produce coins. [16.19] [276.187]\n\nAugust 10\n\nAn Act to amend the 1841 Currency Act receives royal assent, with the signature of Lord Elgin, Governor General of Canada. The Act sets the value of the American dollar in Canada at 5 shillings. The Act also gives Canada's Governor General the power to have silver coins struck for circulation in Canada, in denominations of 5 shillings, 2 shillings 6 pence, 2 shillings, 1 shilling 3 pence, 1 shilling, 6 pence, and 3 pence. These values correspond directly to American currency values of $1, 50c, 40c, 25c, 20c, 10c, and 5c. Gold coins are also provided for, in values of 10 shillings, 12 shillings 6 pence, 1 pound, and 1 pound 5 shillings. The Act is set to become law on January 1, 1851. [176.90] [306.133] [378.182] [571.26]\n\nOctober 24\n\nThe British Treasury sends a memorandum to the Colonial Office severely criticizing Canadian Inspector-General Francis Hincks' proposed Currency Act of 1850, and demanding its disallowance. [306.134]\n\nOctober 25\n\nColonial Secretary Earl Grey informs Lord Elgin that the Currency Act of 1850 should be disallowed, as it was not contingent on the acceptability of the British Government. [306.134]\n\nNovember\n\nFrancis Hincks replies to the British Treasury stating reasons for Canada to issue its own coinage, and that the Currency Act of 1850 should be allowed to stand, and let the legislature repeal certain sections if they are deemed inappropriate. [306.134]\n\nDecember 5\n\nEarl Grey writes to Lord Elgin, agreeing with Francis Hincks that the Canadian Legislature should have an opportunity to amend the Currency Act of 1850. [306.135]\n\n1851\n\nFebruary 20\n\nThe British Treasury replies to Francis Hincks' memorandum of November 1850, refusing to budge on the subject of Canadian currency. [306.135]\n\nApril 14\n\nAn Order-in-Council in England disallows the Canadian Currency Act of 1850. [176.90] [306.135] [571.26]\n\n(month unknown)\n\nThe government of the Province of Canada makes a proposal to the Government in England for a \"Canadian pound\" in gold, plus decimal coins in silver. The request is denied. [16.19] [276.187]\n\nMay 14\n\nFrancis Hincks writes again to the British Treasury, again stating reasons why Canada should issue its own decimal currency. [306.136]\n\nJune\n\nRepresentatives of the provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick meet in Toronto and agree to work towards a common currency based on the decimal system. [277.108] [662.50]\n\nJuly 4\n\nThe British Treasury replies to Francis Hincks' May 14 letter, again stating that regulation of currency is the responsibility of the Crown. [306.137]\n\nAugust 30\n\nThe Canadian Currency Act passes in Canadian parliament, specifying a conversion to decimal currency as soon as is convenient, and making the dollar legal tender, up to $10 per transaction. The wording of the Act specifies that any new coins struck for Canada would be done so under the approval of the British Government. (The British government delays giving the Act royal assent.) [176.91] [306.139] [571.26] [1173.44]\n\n1852\n\nJune 29\n\nThe British Treasury proposes that a distinctive Canadian coin, the pound currency, and called a \"Royal\", should be issued. The Royal would be equivalent to four US gold dollars. Silver coins of denominations 1/2 crown, 1 shilling, 1/2 shilling, and 1/4 shilling would also be produced. [306.139] [1028.58]\n\nvvv advertisement vvv\n\n^^^ advertisement ^^^\n\nNovember\n\nFrancis Hincks introduces a new currency Act into the Canadian legislature. The Act specifies that a dollar currency and a pound currency would both be valid. [306.140]\n\n1853\n\nJune 14\n\nThe Currency Act, 1853, receives royal assent, allowing coins in denominations of dollars and cents to be struck for Canada, as well as shillings and pence. [16.19] [39.1] [176.92] [276.187] [277.109] [306.140] [1023.38]\n\n1854\n\nAugust 1\n\nThe Currency Act of 1853 is proclaimed in England, allowing pounds and dollars to be used for provincial accounts, and providing legal authority for further changes to Canada's monetary system. [277.110] [662.50] [888.46]\n\n1855\n\nThe chairman of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, William Lyon Mackenzie, recommends to parliament that public accounts be kept in a decimal currency based on the U.S. dollar rather than on the British sovereign. No action is taken at the time. [306.142] [571.26]\n\n1856\n\nMarch 26\n\nWilliam Lyon Mackenzie again introduces a resolution in the House of Commons that Canada's currency should become a decimal system, equal to currency of the US. The resolution is defeated by a vote of 58 to 27. [306.142] [571.26]\n\n1857\n\nMarch 6\n\nCanadian Inspector-General (Finance Minister) Cayley introduces a bill requiring the Provincial Government of Canada keep accounts in dollars and cents. [176.93]\n\nJune 10\n\nAn act receives royal assent to put the Province of Canada on the decimal (dollar) system of currency, requiring all accounts be kept in dollars and cents. It is to come into effect January 1, 1858. [1] [35.8] [85] [171.95] [176.93] [276.188] [277.110] [306.143] [571.26] [1015.80] (June 19 [397.15])\n\nAugust 18\n\nThomas Graham, Master of the Royal Mint announces a forthcoming issue of 15,000 pounds sterling worth each of 5c and 10c pieces, and 2,000 pounds sterling of 20c pieces. [176.93] [306.143] [571.26]\n\nOctober 14\n\nThe British Treasury reports that designs for Canada's coins prepared by Leonard Charles Wyon had received approval of Canada's Governor General. [306.143]\n\nOctober 16\n\nThe British Treasury approves the Master of the Mint's proposal for determining the weight of the new 20c piece for Canada. The coin will be 71.73 grains of 0.925 fine silver, equal to 5.066 grains of British standard gold. [294.117] [361.285] [662.50]\n\n1858\n\nJanuary 1\n\nBy an Act passed in England, the Province of Canada is put on the decimal system of currency. [35.8] [85] [240.419] [286.250] [378.183] [380.191] [1015.80] [1144.441]\n\nJuly 1\n\nThe first coins for the Province of Canada are minted in England, in denominations of 1c, 5c, 10c, and 20c. The obverse design of the 1 cent piece was originally intended for use on English coinage, but was rejected, due to its similarity to the bronze coinage of Emperor Napoleon III of France. [1] [662.50] [887.10] (July 2 [1014.56])\n\nJuly 17\n\nDesigns of Leonard Charles Wyon are approved by Queen Victoria, for coins of the Province of Canada: 1c, 5c, 10c, and 20c pieces. [35.8] [294.117] [361.285] [380.191] [1015.80]\n\n(month unknown)\n\nInspector-General A.T. Galt requests of the British Treasury that the order for new Canadian coinage be increased from 50,000 pounds sterling to 70,000. A new request is made for 20,000 pounds sterling of copper for 10 million 1-cent coins. [295.200] [306.143] (1857 [46])\n\nIn England, a double set of the first two of each coin denomination struck for Canada is presented to Queen Victoria. [39.1] [662.50]\n\nThe Royal Mint begins striking 1c coins for Canada. [295.200]\n\nAugust\n\nThe first shipment of Canadian decimal coins is received in Canada from the Royal Mint. It consists of $100,000 in 20c pieces, $75,000 in 10c pieces, $75,000 in 5c pieces, and $50,000 in 1c pieces. [286.250] [306.143] [397.15]\n\nDecember 10\n\n\"Letters Patent\" makes legal tender the silver 5c, 10c, and 20c pieces, and copper cent. [16.19] [39.1] [276.188] [277.110] [294.117] [350.91] [1080.42]\n\nDecember 12\n\nThe decimal coins of Canada are released. Of the order for 10 million 1-cent coins, only 421,000 1-cent coins are ready. [35.8] [380.191] [662.50] [1015.80] [1036.36] [1098.62] (September [1])\n\n1860\n\nThe government decides to replace the 20c piece with a 25c coin. [661.51]\n\n1861\n\nThe government of the Province of Canada sends part of its stock of 1-cent coins to the New Brunswick for temporary use there while that colony awaited the arrival of its own coinage from England. [661.48]\n\n1862\n\nDecember 9\n\nCanada's first coin club is formed, the Numismatic Society of Montreal, in Montreal, Quebec. Adelard Boucher is named first president. [222.71] [334.116] [350.34] [353.432] [661.v]\n\n1866\n\nJanuary\n\nThe name of the Numismatic Society of Montreal is changed to the Numismatic and Antiquarian Society of Montreal. [334.116] [350.35] [353.433] (January 1867 [222.71]) (Antiquarian and Numismatic Research Society of Montreal [334.116])\n\nNovember\n\nAn Order-in-Council makes gold coins from the Sydney Mint legal tender in Canada.
