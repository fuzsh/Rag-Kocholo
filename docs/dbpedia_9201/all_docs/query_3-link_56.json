        "text": "The Canadian Dollar\n\nIn early Canadian history, people in Britain’s Canadian colonies used a variety of different currencies to buy things, including British pounds, American dollars, Spanish pesos, and even unique colonial currencies made by local banks and governments. In 1867, the new unified Canadian government gained exclusive constitutional power over currency, and in 1870 it used this power to pass the Dominion Notes Act (now known as the Currency Act) which made the Canadian Dollar ($) the official currency of Canada. A Canadian dollar is made up of 100 Canadian cents (₵).\n\nA History of the Canadian Dollar, Bank of Canada\n\nOriginally tied to value of the British pound, and then the price of gold, since 1931 the Canadian dollar has been a so-called “free-floating” currency with a value determined by the international marketplace. Like most advanced countries, Canada also has a national bank, known as the Bank of Canada, that has the power to both print and buy currency in order to help control the currency’s value. In the opinion of the International Monetary Fund, the Canadian dollar is one of the world’s seven reserve currencies known for its stability and reliability even in times of economic uncertainty.\n\nThe Canadian dollar is usually measured in comparison to the American dollar. It is almost always worth less, but the exact value can vary quite a bit depending on what’s going on in the world. At its worst, the Canadian dollar may be worth around 65 American cents; at best, it can be very close to par.\n\nDaily Exchange Rates, Bank of Canada\n\nCanadian Coins are produced by the Royal Canadian Mint, which is known among coin collectors as one of the most extravagant and creative coin-producing entities in the world. In addition to the standard-use coins above, the Mint also produces a vast variety of “special edition” coins in a wide variety of denominations and designs, including very high value coins of pure gold, silver, and platinum, as well as gimmicky novelties like full-colour coins, glow-in-the-dark coins, and Marvel superhero coins.\n\nCanadian Coins, World Coin Gallery\n\nCanadian Paper Money\n\nCanadian paper money, also known as bills, banknotes, or simply notes, is used for larger currency denominations. The current designs, known as the Polymer Series, are actually not made of paper at all, but a sort of thin, flexible plastic known as polymer. Paper bills from the last series — known as the Canadian Journey Series — which began in 2001 and started being officially phased out in 2011, are still sometimes used. Canadian banknote designs usually change every 10 years or so."
