        "text": "Is it feasible for the island of Newfoundland off of Canada's coast to remain British, and not be incorporated into Canada (as part of Newfoundland and Labrador)? I feel like the UK would've liked to have retained an American exclave even in the process of decolonization, due to the advantages it brings in resources, extending the reach of Britain's military, and personal prestige given Newfoundland's historical importance.\n\nI'll admit that a part of me kind of likes the idea of having a slice of Britain in North America, off of Canada's coast and in relatively close proximity to the United States, kinda like having a slice of France in South America bordering Brazil. So I'd figure to ask here.\n\nHow likely would it be for Newfoundland to be a full possession of Britain to this day, rather than a part of Canada, and what might that have entailed?\n\nThe British were the ones desperately trying to force Newfoundland, which they didn't want, into Canada all through the '30s and '40s. If they wanted to keep it there's no reason why they couldn't- the Dominion of Newfoundland had gone bankrupt and been returned to the Crown in 1934, so the referendum to unify with Canada required British permission (which, to be clear, was immediately forthcoming because Britain viewed Newfoundland as undesirable real estate). So the only change required is that sometime between 1945 and 1949 Britain has to decide it wants to keep the colony (1948 really- the technical end date is 1949, but by that point the referendum is already planned, rigged, and going ahead).\n\nThe major question is why. Military bases? The US alliance already exists and gets them better basing options cheaper. Natural resources? The big hydroelectric dams haven't been built and the offshore oil fields are decades away from becoming cost-effective to exploit. The prestige of Empire? Post-war the British are running away from that narrative with all possible speed.\n\nAll that said, a different WW2 and more fraught relationships between the US and UK could certainly have led to Britain retaining Newfoundland longer, becoming effectively a bigger St. Pierre and Miquelon or a smaller Greenland- a European-owned island off the coast of North America that lacks anything valuable enough for the US to care.\n\nIf only there was a timeline on the subject.\n\nWill eventually get back to it at some point ( - RL has been giving me some benders, although I'm now planning on graduating as an Honors student with an Associate degree so at least I'm getting some positive stuff going, plus now the original thread is locked). At the same time, I've also been giving it a bit of a rethink, and am thinking of going in either one (or both - saves me from having to duplicate everything) of two directions:\n\n1) a divided Britain (I'm temporarily calling it a \"three Britains\" scenario) where Britain and Germany (if it gets its act together early on) switch places in terms of 20th century history. The details would be radically different and more drawing on pre-existing stuff in Britain, but that throws Newfoundland out of whack, although *not* strictly speaking a Taiwan analogue (the British government would probably rather decamp in both Ottawa and Victoria, BC - the latter because of Hatley Castle - while Montréal, downriver from Ottawa, would be the new economic center);\n\n2) alternately - well, let's just say this US Marine Band version of the Overture to People's Artist of the USSR D.D. Shostakovich's score to Ovod (The Gadfly), the 1950s film version of the Russian translation of Ethel Voynich's novel, is starting to grow on me:\n\nWhich points towards another direction, that of a Soviet Britain (that is, a Communist Britain that joins the Soviet Union, and goes through the ups and downs with a particular British twist, and eventually follows a similar course that the Baltics took towards independence - but with some veneer of legality by also playing by the rules). A good portion of the details, outside of a possible \"cookie-cutter\" approach, are pretty hazy (including the specifics of how Britain ends up as a socialist state in the first place, as well as accounting for a WW2 analog), but there are some bits that I do know I want to try. Again, Newfoundland is the odd one out, but it does allow not only for an Imperial Federation (of the Dominions and the UK-in-Exile) to occur, but the government-in-exile would now have a vested interest in this Appalachian outcrop masquerading as an island (and there's much that needs to change in Newfoundland, anyway!) since it's now the last resort option.\n\nAll in all, regardless of which path I choose, it would basically be another case of Be Careful What You Wish For.\n\nWould a Canada that’s more obsessively wedded to the National Policy work? Protectionism walloped the Maritimes and a Newfoundland that watches that persist may go the other way in a referendum\n\nNot quite - Canada was very much obsessively wedded to the National Policy during all the time Newfoundland was a Dominion and prior, and that didn't change the equation one bit (indeed, after a disastrous banking crisis in the 1890s, IIRC, Newfoundland was forced to adopt the Canadian dollar as its own currency). What probably saved Newfoundland, sadly enough, was sectarian tensions - Canada was originally seen negatively by the local Orangemen as a Papist plot because of Quebec (as I previously mentioned), but when Confederation happened the tables were turned (indeed, if one looks carefully at the 1948 referendum results, there's something that looks like no mere coincidence as to which regions supported a return to Dominion status or Confederation). Now, had the center of political, economic, cultural, etc. life in Newfoundland been on the other side of the island, things would have been rather different and would definitely jump at the first opportunity to become a province - but that's a pre-1900 POD.\n\nNot exactly. Britain was attempting to keep some level of it's power and prestige as an empire after the Cold War (much like the other colonial powers). This of course led to the incident known as the Suez Crisis, a great humiliation for both Britain and France when it became clear that their best days were behind them and were superseded by the USA and USSR.\n\nThe economics of fishing are the major reason why France kept St. Pierre and Miquelon, so don't discount that option!\n\nMore generally, the possibility that Britain would want to keep Newfoundland for some idiosyncratic reason if there was a valuable resource, or particularly resonant bit of history that would make the island stand out among the colonial possessions Britain was giving up at the time shouldn't be discounted- but any TL would need to figure out what specific motivating factor made them want to keep Newfoundland specifically (or look at the consequences of Britain trying to hold more of her imperial possession together in the late '40s)."
