        "text": "You are: Home » Canadian coins » Provincial coins » Newfoundland price guide and values\n\nNewfoundland price guide and values\n\nNewfoundland, a separate British colony, was allowed to issue its own coinage (1, 5, 10, 20, 25 and 50 cents) beginning in 1865. However, in introducing the new currency in 1865, Newfoundland, unlike other colonies, chose to include a 2 dollars gold coin among the denominations it was issuing.\n\nThe value of a Newfoundland coin depends on several factors such as quality and wear, supply and demand, rarity, finish and more. Values in the section are based on the market, trends, auctions and recognized books, publications and catalogs. This section also includes information on history, errors, varieties, characteristics and more.\n\nRelated numismatic tools, articles and links"
