        "text": "January 2nd 1920 Government of Newfoundland $1 Bill\n\nDescription: These are very popular bank notes. Each note has a portrait of King George V. The right hand side of the note shows a blue vignette of a caribou. Prices for circulated notes usually range from $100 to $500. High grade notes can be worth significantly more money.\n\nVarieties: These can be signed by Bursell and Brownrigg, Hickey and Brownrigg, Keating and Brownrigg, or Renouf and Brownrigg. The Bursell signature commands a small premium over the other notes. Otherwise there are no design or layout differences.\n\nQuantity Issued: 600,000\n\nText: The Government of Newfoundland – Will Pay To Bearer On Demand – St. John’s NFLD. – Jany 2nd 1920 – One Dollar – Countersigned – Minister of Finance and Customers – American Bank Note Co. Ottawa\n\nBANK NOTE FRONT:\n\nNEED AN APPRAISAL OR WANT TO SELL?\n\nWe buy all of these 1920 one dollar bank notes from Newfoundland. Values are based purely on condition and occasionally the signature combination. If you would like our offer, then please send us pictures of your bank note. We will grade the paper money and respond back quickly with our buy and sell price. You might be surprised at how much money some high grade Newfoundland bank notes can be worth."
