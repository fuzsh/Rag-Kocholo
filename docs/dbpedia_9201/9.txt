Newfoundland was established as a British colony on August 5, 1583. It was a Dominion from 1855 until January 30, 1934 and became a province of Canada on April 1, 1949.

Newfoundland's monetary history followed that of Canada. Tokens were issued by Newfoundland traders between 1840 and 1860. The first regal coins were issued in 1865 and continued to be issued until 1949 when Newfoundland became a province of Canada. Newfoundland issued Pounds (NFLP) until 1858 when it began issuing the Newfoundland Dollar (NFLD), which traded at par with the Canadian Dollar. Upon becoming a province of Canada, Newfoundland adopted the Canadian Dollar (CAD).

The Government of Newfoundland issued banknotes. The Dollar was divisible into 100 Cents.
