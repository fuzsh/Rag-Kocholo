He officially becomes the seventh head coach in Dinos women's hockey history.\n\n\"Josh stepped into the head coach role mid-season last year and did an admirable job,\" Matchett said. \"His collaborative approach, along with his demonstrated ability to recruit and build strong relationships with his athletes, are among the ingredients that will make him successful in this role. We're excited for what's next in the Joan Snyder Program of Excellence.\"\n\nFollowing the departure of MacLeod to the Professional Women's Hockey League, Gosling compiled a record of 10-10-2 as interim head coach. The Dinos won nine of their final 14 regular season games to secure the fifth seed in the Canada West Playoffs. Under Gosling's guidance, Calgary defeated the Saskatchewan Huskies on the road in the conference quarterfinal, overcoming a Game 1 loss, to clinch their first postseason series victory since 2015.\n\n\"I am grateful for the opportunity to lead the Dinos women's hockey program and confident in the direction this team is heading,\" Gosling said. \"I am excited to work with everyone involved and represent the prestigious University of Calgary.\"\n\nGosling joined the Dinos in August of 2021 from Edge School, a private school for Grades 4-12 located just west of Calgary, where he served as the head coach of their boy's U17 prep team.\n\nGosling also brings experience from various levels with Hockey Alberta and is a Hockey Canada Certified Skills Coach.\n\nThe Joan Snyder Program of Excellence in Women's Hockey has supported the Dinos women's hockey team since 2011, enhancing coaching excellence, elite competition and sport services, and providing scholarships to student-athletes.\n\n-UC-"
