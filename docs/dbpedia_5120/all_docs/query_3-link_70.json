It is owned by Cox Enterprises. The station's studio is located at North Tryon and 23rd Streets, just north of Uptown Charlotte, and is shared with sister station WAXN-TV (channel 64). The transmitter is located just outside Charlotte's northeastern city limits, in the Newell-Hickory Grove area. WSOC-TV is carried on cable channel 4 on cable systems in Charlotte, Gastonia and Rock Hill and on channel 9 in most outlying areas.\n\nContents\n\n1 History\n\n2 Digital television\n\n3 Newscasts\n\n3.1 Current Personalities\n\n3.1.1 News\n\n3.1.2 Severe Weather Center 9\n\n3.1.3 Sports\n\n3.2 Former Personalities\n\n4 External links\n\n5 References\n\n[edit] History\n\nWSOC-TV signed on on April 28, 1957.[1] It was Charlotte's third television station, after WBTV and WAYS-TV, which broadcast on channel 36 from 1954 to 1955. WSOC was the second station on the VHF band, and is now Charlotte's second-oldest continuously operating station.\n\nIt was originally owned by the Jones family along with WSOC radio (AM 1240, later on AM 930 and now WYFQ), and FM 103.7). WSOC-AM was Charlotte's second radio station, having signed on the air in 1929, seven years after WBT.\n\nOriginally, Channel 9 was a primary NBC affiliate, and shared ABC programs with WBTV. Cox Communications of Atlanta bought WSOC radio and TV in 1959.\n\nChannel 36 returned to the air in 1964 as WCCB. WCCB moved to channel 18 in 1966, but it continued to be at a competitive disadvantage because many Charlotte-area homes did not yet have sets with UHF tuning capability. For the next three years, WSOC and WCCB split both NBC and ABC programming roughly equally; WBTV continued to air some ABC programs as well. WCCB aired programs from all three networks that the other two stations declined.\n\nIn 1967, NBC, which has historically been very intolerant of local pre-emptions, told channel 9's management to start clearing all of NBC's programming as a condition of renewing its affiliation with the station. WSOC then dropped all remaining ABC programming and became a sole NBC affiliate, while WCCB became a full-time ABC affiliate with no NBC programming.\n\nBy 1978 ABC had become the country's highest-rated network for the first time, and wanted a stronger outlet in Charlotte than WCCB. It quickly cut a deal with Cox to switch both WSOC-TV and Cox' flagship station, WSB-TV in Atlanta, to ABC affiliation. WSOC joined ABC on July 1, 1978. NBC was sent over to WRET (channel 36, now WCNC-TV), and WCCB became an independent station (it is now affiliated with Fox). The radio stations were sold off in the early 1990s; the AM station is now owned by Bible Broadcasting Network, and WSOC-FM by CBS Radio.\n\nIn 1996, WSOC-TV entered into a joint sales agreement with WKAY-TV, channel 64. As part of the deal, WKAY moved its operations to WSOC-TV's studios and changed its calls to WAXN-TV. Cox bought WAXN outright in 2001.\n\nWSOC-TV was Charlotte's home of the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon from 1971 to 2001; the program now airs on WAXN.\n\n[edit] Digital television\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\n\nChannel Programming Digital Cable Channel 9.1 / 34.1 WSOC-DT (main WSOC/ABC programming) Charter 780, Comporium 304, TWC 235 9.2 / 34.2 WSOC-WX (Severe Weather Center Now) TWC 236\n\n[edit] Newscasts\n\nSince the early 1970s, WSOC-TV has used the Eyewitness News moniker for its newscasts. However, its style is very similar to the Action News format at sister station WSB-TV.\n\nFor many years, WSOC's news was a very distant second in the Charlotte market, behind the older WBTV. However, in 1982, it overtook WBTV for the lead at 11 PM, a lead it held for almost 25 years. It surpassed WBTV in most other time slots beginning in 1990, but lost the lead at noon to WBTV in 1994. It has been able to dominate the early news timeslots largely because of the presence of Oprah as a lead-in; the show has aired on channel 9 since its national premiere in 1986. In the February 2008 ratings, WSOC led in every time slot; WCNC is consistently a distant third. [2]\n\nSince 1994, WSOC-TV has produced a 10:00pm newscast, which now airs on its sister station, WAXN-TV. Its 10:00 news aired on WCCB until that station launched its own local news operation in 2000. In November 2007, WAXN's newscast was second in the 10 PM news ratings, behind WCCB and ahead of the WBTV-produced newscast on WJZY. [3]\n\nBill Walker was WSOC's main anchor from 1971 until his retirement in 2005, longer than anyone in Charlotte television history.\n\nWSOC-TV started producing local high definition newscasts on April 22, 2007 [4]. That made WSOC the first television station (and currently the only one) in Charlotte and the second station in North Carolina (behind Raleigh's WRAL-TV) to do newscasts in HD.\n\n[edit] Current Personalities\n\n[edit] News\n\nMark Becker, General Assignment Reporter\n\nJamie Bowers, Traffic Reporter\n\nJim Bradley, General Assignment Reporter\n\nKim Brattain, 5:30PM and 10PM Anchor/Reporter\n\nErica Bryant, Daybreak and Midday Anchor/Reporter\n\nTim Caputo, General Assignment Reporter\n\nVince Coakley, 5PM, 6PM, and 11PM Anchor/Reporter\n\nDebi Faubion, 5PM, 6PM, and 11PM Anchor/Reporter\n\nDave Faherty, General Assignment Reporter\n\nDon Griffin, Consumer and Business Reporter\n\nAshlea Kosikowski, General Assignment Reporter\n\nKen Lemon, General Assignment Reporter\n\nKara Lusk, Daybreak Reporter\n\nBrigida Mack, Sunday Morning and Midday Anchor/Reporter\n\nRon Magnuson, General Assignment Reporter\n\nBlair Miller, 5:30PM and 10PM Anchor/Reporter\n\nAnn Marie O'Keefe, Saturday Morning and Midday Anchor/Reporter\n\nRene Romo, General Assignment Reporter\n\nBrian Stickley, Traffic Reporter\n\nGreg Suskin, South Carolina Bureau Reporter\n\nBen Thompson, Weekend 6PM, 10PM, and 11PM Anchor/Reporter\n\nSusan Tran, Weekend 6PM, 10PM, and 11PM Anchor/Reporter\n\nScott Wickersham, Daybreak and Midday Anchor/Reporter\n\n[edit] Severe Weather Center 9\n\nJohn Ahrens, Weekend Evening Meteorologist (AMS Certified)\n\nSteve Udelson, Chief Meteorologist (AMS-CBM)\n\nMark Watkins, Daybreak and Midday Meteorologist (AMS Certified)\n\nKeith Monday, Weekend Morning Meteorologist (AMS Certified)\n\n[edit] Sports\n\nBill Voth, Sports Anchor/Reporter\n\nTiffany Wright, Sports Anchor/Reporter\n\nJarod Latch, Sports Anchor/Reporter\n\n[edit] Former Personalities\n\nDiana Williams - reporter (1979-1982; now at WABC-TV in New York City)\n\nHolly Bristow, General Assignment Reporter (2003-2006, now at WOFL)\n\nHarold Johnson, Sports Director (1979-2006, retired)\n\nRay Boylan, Meteorologist (1986-1996, retired)\n\nTerri Bennett, Meteorologist (1991-1996, at WCNC-TV Charlotte 1997-2007)\n\nSteve Adamson, Meteorologist (1994-1996, now at WXIA-TV Atlanta)\n\nCullen Ferguson, Anchor/Reporter (1969-2005, retired)\n\nDoreen Gentzler, Anchor/Reporter (1979-1983, now at WRC-TV Washington)\n\nBill Walker, Anchor/Reporter (1968-2005, retired)\n\nPatty Pan, General Assignment Reporter (2002-2005, now at WAGA-TV Atlanta)\n\nTracey Neale, Anchor/Reporter (?-1994, last seen at WUSA-TV Washington)\n\nMichelle Kosinski, Reporter (?-2001, now at NBC)\n\nRob Boisvert, Anchor/Reporter (?-?, now at News 14 Carolina)\n\nMeg MacDonald, Anchor/Reporter (1983-1990, later at WCAU-TV Philadelphia and Inside Edition)\n\nCory Kessler, Sports Anchor/Reporter (?-?, now at Fox Sports Net South)\n\nJeff Sonier, Reporter (1980's-1990's, now at WCNC-TV)\n\nJoe Johns, Reporter (?-?, later at WRC-TV and NBC, now at CNN)\n\nJeremy Reiner, Meteorologist (1999-2006, now at WHDH-TV)\n\nBob Pearse, Sports Anchor (1978-1980, now at Cable News 2, Rock Hill, SC)\n\nBrett McMillan, Sports Anchor (1980's, now at WBT)\n\nJohn Humphries, Sports Reporter/Anchor (1980's, now at WYFF)\n\nMelonie Holt, Anchor/Reporter (1996-2004, now at WFTV)\n\nJohn Cochran, Reporter (1960's, later at NBC, now at ABC)\n\nDoug Mayes, Anchor (1981-1989, retired)\n\nBrooke Sanders, Reporter (1995-1998, now at WMC-TV)\n\nSean Hennessey, Reporter (1993, now at WCBS-TV)\n\nJerry Peterson, Meteorologist (1970's and 1980's, now at WRHI-AM/WRHM-FM, Rock Hill, SC)\n\nSteve Litz, Reporter (1998-2006)\n\nBrad Lacey, Co-Anchor/Update Desk, \"Good Morning Carolina\" anchor, (1970s, deceased 1984)\n\nJack Callaghan, Program Host, News Anchor, Station Manager and Editorial Director (1957-1995, deceased)\n\nBob Tyson, Weekend Weather (1980's)\n\nDavid Hains, Reporter (1980's, now spokesman for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Charlotte)\n\nTad Maguire, Meteorologist (1980's)\n\nAmanda Nissen, Reporter (1990's)\n\nOther notable employees include editor John Bultmann (1988-1996) and producer Lee Baber (1992-1997).\n\n[edit] External links\n\nWSOC-TV Homepage\n\nQuery the FCC's TV station database for WSOC-TV\n\nBIAfn's Media Web Database -- Information on WSOC-TV"
