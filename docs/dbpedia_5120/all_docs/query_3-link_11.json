        "text": "\"How can I convince others (like my boss!) to adopt my ideas?\" My favorite story about convincing stakeholders was something Ira Glass did. When This American Life first got picked up, he didn't tell radio station execs and programming directors, \"We're going to transform radio. Pick us up.\" He told them, \"You're going to make more money.\" He first ALIGNED with the goals they had. He let them know he shared in those goals. That gives anyone the benefit of the doubt from Moment One. You can proceed with your pitch. Great. Next, he shared how they would (and had been) earning stations more money: by being storytellers. (Stay with me.) Yes, the team and he were deft storytellers for their actual episode content, but they ALSO pointed those very same skills on the ad spots asking listeners to donate to public radio. Those spots were historically very bland and flat. Ira and team made them enjoyable, funny, quirky, and EFFECTIVE. Lastly, Ira also recognized that the pitch meeting and interactions with stakeholders he was having was a chance to tell stories too. He didn't just flip through numbers. He USED those numbers in his discussions with the execs and programming directors -- to tell a story. The status quo of these ad spots was X. That led to problems like Y. So the resolution must be Z. And so if you wanted to earn more money for the station, and you recognize that by doing X we're encountering Y, then what if we did Z? \"That's what we excel at doing,\" you can finally reveal. You are a storyteller. When you turn to face your audience, you know that and you execute against that. But don't forget about that when you turn inward to face your client, your boss, your investors, your stakeholders. You're a storyteller. Tell stories. Everywhere."
