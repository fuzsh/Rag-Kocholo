        "text": "THIS WEEK: The UND women's hockey team returns to the Ralph Engelstad Arena for a WCHA series against St. Cloud State.\n\nTUNE IN: This weekend's games will be broadcasted on KKXL \"The Fan\" 1440 AM and on www.UNDSports.com with broadcaster Darrin Looker calling the action. A webcast is also available through www.UNDSports.com.\n\nA live blog will be open for fans during the game at www.UNDSports.com or you can get live updates by following UNDWHockey through twitter. Live stats for the game can be found through www.UNDSports.com.\n\nMake sure to \"like\" the team on Facebook for behind the scenes videos and information on this years squad at www.faceboook.com/UNDwhky.\n\nABOUT SCSU STATE: The Huskies are off to their best start since 2008-09 with a 2-2 record through four games.\n\nAfter opening its season getting swept by No. 1 Minnesota, SCSU joined Wisconsin as the the only road teams to sweep Bemidji State at the Sanford Center since the Beavers moved into their new home two seasons ago, with 3-1 and 1-0 victories last weekend.\n\nThe Huskies have scored five goals on the season, all coming from different skaters. Both goaltenders Julie Friend and Katie Fitzgerald are 1-1 on the year with a combined 3.00 goals against average and a .922 save percentage.\n\nTHE ALL-TIME SERIES: UND is 14-18-4 all-time against SCSU, but is 8-1-1 in its last 10 meetings including a current eight game winning streak.\n\nIn those last eight games, UND has four shutouts and has outscored the Huskies 53 to seven. UND did not allow a goal to the Huskies last year in Grand Forks winning 10-0 and 9-0.\n\nLAST ACTION: North Dakota split its series at No. 6 Ohio State on its first road trip of the season.\n\nOhio State won the series-opener, holding off a late rally attempt, for a 5-3 victory. The Buckeyes jumped out to to a 4-0 lead through two periods, but UND played a spirited third period, rallying to within one goal. Tanja Eisenschmid scored her first collegiate goal while Jocelyne Lamoureux and Andrea Dalen each scored to pull within a 4-3 deficit. The comeback fell short as Paige Semenza scored an empty-netter with 20 seconds remaining to give her a hat trick in the game.\n\nNorth Dakota's determined effort provided an offensive assault in the first period in the series finale. UND had the first 12 shots on goal and opened a 1-0 lead on Jocelyne Lamoureux's second power-play goal of the weekend at 10:13 of the opening frame. The score would stand until Lamoureux added an empty-netter with 44\n\nseconds remaining in regulation time to lead UND to the 2-0 win.\n\nPOLL POSITION: UND is ranked No. 5 in both the USCHO.com and the USA Today/USA Hockey Magazine polls.\n\nGREAT START: Senior Jorid Dagfinrud entered the game after the second intermission in Friday's loss for her first appearance of the season. She has now played four periods and 79 minutes of shutout hockey to start her senior campaign.\n\nREMEMBER YOUR FIRST: Redshirt freshman Leah Jensen and true freshman Tanja Eisenschmid have collected their first collegiate goals already this season. Jensen's came in UND's 4-1 win over MSU while Eisenschmid tallied her goal in last weekend's 5-3 loss to OSU.\n\nROAD DEFENSE: UND's 2-0 shutout win over the Buckeyes was its first shutout win on the road since Feb. 12, 2010, also winning 2-0 against Bemidji State.\n\nFALLING SHORT: North Dakota lost to Ohio State by a 5-3 score although outshooting the Buckeyes 35-20. It is the first time UND has lost when outshooting its opponent since Nov. 26, 2011 vs. Bemidji State.\n\nGGF LINE: UND has featured a line combination of greater Grand Forks area natives. Jocelyne Lamoureux and Monique Lamoureux of Grand Forks and East Grand Fork's Leah Jensen. All three finished the weekend tied for the team lead with three points.\n\nOLD VETS VS. THE YOUNG AND RESTLESS: Of the 26 athletes on UND's 2012-13 roster, eight of them are seniors and 12 are either redshirt freshmen or true freshmen. UND enters the season with six players that over 100 games of experience, 17 with less than 40 games and only three in the middle.\n\nFACING THE HOT: For the third-straight week to open the season, North Dakota will most likely face a hot goaltender. In the first two weeks of the season North Dakota faced the reigning defensive player of the week in net in MSU's Danielle Butters and OSU's Chelsea Knapp and in its third series the rookie of the week in SCSU's Katie Fitzgerald.\n\nFRONT LOADED: UND will open the season playing 12 of its first 16 games at the Ralph Engelstad Arena.\n\nCOACHES CHOICE: North Dakota was picked to finish second in the WCHA Pre-Season Coaches Poll, behind defending national champion Minnesota and tied with defending WCHA regular-season champion Wisconsin.\n\nHOME DOMINANCE: North Dakota went 15-3-1 at the Ralph Engelstad Arena last year to set new program records in home wins and home winning percentage. At the REA, UND outscored its opponents 102-36.\n\nUNITED NATIONS: North Dakota continues to expand its recruiting pipeline while pursuing local standouts as well. UND has four players from North Dakota, 10 from Minnesota, two from Colorado, two from Manitoba, one from Ontario, one from Quebec and six from Europe (Denmark, Germany, Norway and Sweden).\n\nBONUS SCHOOL: Jorid Dagfinrud, Jocelyne Lamoureux and Monique Lamoureux have all received their bachelor's degrees from UND and are pursuing their master's degrees.\n\nTHANKS FOR THE SUPPORT: For the second consecutive season, UND ranked second in the nation in attendance (1,485 per game) while setting a new program record for total attendance as well (28,218). UND got off to another strong start in its first two home games this season averaging 1,336.\n\nEXPOSURE: UND will have four games televised by Midco Sports Net in 2012-13 as home series against rivals Minnesota and Wisconsin will be shown in households regionally.\n\nAll home games are aired locally on the radio along with eight road games this season.\n\nAll UND home games can be viewed through UNDSports.com."
