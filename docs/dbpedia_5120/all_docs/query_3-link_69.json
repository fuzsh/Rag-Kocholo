        "text": "Sabrina the Teenage Witch (titled Sabrina and the Groovie Goolies or The Sabrina Comedy Hour during its first season and promotionally referred to as The Sabrina the Teenage Witch Show or The Sabrina Comedy Show) is an American low-budget animated sitcom television series produced by Filmation that aired on CBS from 1971 to 1974 that aired on CBS during Saturday mornings from 1971 to 1974. The series is also aired in primetime as a syndicated series. Based on Archie Comics' Sabrina the Teenage Witch, it was a spinoff of The Archie Comedy Hour. The series featured new episodes of Sabrina along with the Groovie Goolies. Now for the first time in the series, The Looney Tunes Gang are appeared in the animated series of the show. The series follows a crime-fighting teenaged witch who likes to hang out and fight enemies using her magical powers, without letting her friends at Riverdale High find out.\n\nAs depicted in the opening sequence of the series, Sabrina Spellman is created by her aunts, aunts, Hilda and Zelda in an attempt to create the \"evil, wicked witch\" using a mixture of the magic potions (shown in respective fields of light green, and pink). However, Zelda accidentally bumped Hilda, causing to spilled teen girls' stuff as extra ingredients into the mixture, creating, instead of the \"evil wicked witch.\n\nList of Episodes[]\n\nThe Archie Comedy Hour (1969–1970)[]\n\nThe Fairy Godmother\n\nHiccups\n\nWhich Witch is Which?\n\nThe Basketball Game\n\nWill the Real Weatherbee Stand Up?\n\nCaveman\n\nPaint Story\n\nAunt Zelda's Broom\n\nCinderella Story\n\nWhat the Hex Going On?\n\nWishbone\n\nBabysitter\n\nCarnival\n\nStage Fright\n\nPet Show\n\nFunny Bunny\n\nHair Today, Gone Tomorrow\n\nA Witch in Time\n\nWhen the Cat's Away\n\nCostume Party\n\nLet's Have a Hand for Jughead\n\nThe New Freeway\n\nBlue Whale\n\nFootball Game\n\nTown Beautiful\n\nHorse's Mouth\n\nBirdman of Riverdale\n\nHoedown Showdown\n\nSpooky Spokes\n\nYou Oughta Be in Pictures\n\nThe Generation Flap\n\nSchool Daze\n\nUg at the Bat\n\nComputerized Moose\n\nSabrina and the Groovie Goolies (1970–1971)[]\n\nRose-Colored Glasses\n\nLiving Dolls\n\nCake Bake\n\nHot Rod Derby\n\nThe Bear Facts\n\nChild Care\n\nWitches Golf Open\n\nRummage Sale\n\nHigh School Drop-Ins\n\nBig Deal\n\nFrankie\n\nBeached\n\nOuch\n\nSmog\n\nDirty Pool\n\nThe Grayed Outdoors\n\nShort Changed\n\nMis-Guided Tour\n\nThat Old Track Magic\n\nMoose's Alter-Falter\n\nMortal Terror\n\nWeather or Not\n\nFlying Sorcery\n\nToo Many Cooks\n\nAmbrose's Amulet\n\nAuto-Biography\n\nTragic Magic\n\nA Nose for News\n\nVoices[]\n\nMel Blanc - Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Bugs Bunny, Yosemite Sam, Sylvester the Cat, Tweety Bird, Wile E.
