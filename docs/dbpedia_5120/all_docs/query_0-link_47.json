        "text": "MINNEAPOLIS â€” The Bemidji State women's hockey team's 2024-25 schedule will feature an outdoor matchup against Minnesota on the 19th Annual Hockey Day Minnesota (HDM).\n\nThe Minnesota Wild, along with Bally Sports North and Minnesota Hockey announced that Hockey Day Minnesota 2025 will take place at Valleyfair Amusement Park in Shakopee on Saturday, Jan. 25.\n\n\"We are honored to be part of Hockey Day Minnesota 2025,\" said U of M head coach Brad Frost in a release. \"Any time we get to showcase collegiate women's hockey on one of the biggest hockey days of the year is incredible. This will be an amazing experience for our student-athletes. We would like to thank the Minnesota Wild, Bally Sports North and everyone else involved for having us be a part of this special day.\"\n\nBally Sports North's broadcast event will feature over 16 hours of original hockey programming beginning at 9 a.m. on Saturday, Jan. 25. Coverage will include the three live outdoor games from Valleyfair Amusement Park, followed by a Minnesota Wild game during primetime. The regional sports network will show highlights from all Hockey Day games taking place throughout the weekend and incorporate coverage of the outdoor festivities taking place at Valleyfair.\n\n\"It's our pleasure to announce the date and matchups for Hockey Day Minnesota 2025,\" said Matthew Underwood, Hockey Day Minnesota 2025 Chair, in a release. \"We are thrilled about the matchups and expect competitive hockey being played throughout the weekend here at one of Minnesota's most iconic locations.\"\n\nHockey Day Minnesota 2025 will mark the third outdoor game in Minnesota's program history. In the 2014 Hockey City Classic, Minnesota took down Minnesota State in a 4-0 game at Huntington Bank Stadium. Then, on Hockey Day Minnesota 2020, the Gophers notched a 2-1 victory over Ohio State at Parade Stadium in downtown Minneapolis.\n\nTicket information and additional programming details for HDM 2025 will be announced at a later date.\n\nHockey Day Minnesota originated in 2007 by the Minnesota Wild to celebrate the game that has made Minnesota the \"State of Hockey.\" It is produced in partnership with Bally Sports North, Minnesota Hockey and the respective local community that serves as host each year.\n\nPrevious locations include Baudette Bay (2007, 2008), Phalen Park (2009), Hermantown (2010), Moorhead (2011), Minnetonka (2012), Grand Rapids (2013), Elk River (2014), Saint Paul (2015), Duluth (2016), Stillwater (2017), St. Cloud (2018), Bemidji (2019), Minneapolis (2020), Guidant John Rose MN Oval (2021), Mankato (2022), White Bear (2023) and Warroad (2024). Hockey Day Minnesota is headed to Hastings in 2026."
