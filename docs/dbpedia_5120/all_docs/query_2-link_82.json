The Mooresville Police Department is warning citizens about a scam in which the perpetrators call potential victims posing as law enforcement. A news release named Assistant Chief Dyson as a possible name being used.\n\nIf you or someone you know receives a call from a person claiming to work for the Mooresville Police Department who asks you for money to prevent your arrest, prevent the arrest of a loved one, or for any other reason, hang up immediately. After you hang up, call your local law enforcement agency.\n\nYou can also call the Mooresville Police Department’s Telecommunicators at 704-664-3311. They can talk to you to confirm that it was not Assistant Chief Dyson who called you. They can also help you with any next steps you’ll need to take.\n\nThe Mooresville Police Department wants to remind you that no law enforcement agency will ever ask you to make payment to prevent arrest. They would also never ask for payment in gift cards, bitcoin, or any other digital currency."
