Hay has headed up corporate relations, facilities and game day operations along with now leading the entire external operations including overseeing the Bears Club, which serves as the fundraising arm of Lenoir-Rhyne athletics.\n\nUnder Hay's leadership as the Director of Facilities, he oversaw upgrades of Shuford Arena, Moretz Gym, an indoor golf training space, Durham Field, multiple locker rooms, and the completion and opening of the Neill McGeachy Sports Performance Center. Most recently, Hay helped lead the $18M renovation of Moretz Stadium. All of these projects have been completed in his four-year tenure with the Moretz Stadium renovation taking less than one year to complete. These projects have completely transformed each facility and put LR on par with some of the best facilities in all of NCAA Division II.\n\nShuford Arena has been completely updated and includes a new playing court, new lights, new paint, new videoboards and scoreboards, new seatback and bleacher seating, new scorer's table and new sound system. Durham Field was turfed utilizing the Diamond Series Baseball Turf which made LR one of a small number of DII programs using the top-of-the-line playing surface from Astro Turf. LR was also the only DII program in the state of North Carolina to be fully turfed. The most expansive was the rebuild of Moretz Stadium which started almost exactly a year ago. With Hay's assistance, the project called for a new stadium entrance, new home bleachers, new lights, a brand-new press box and President's suite, a tunnel entrance and new locker room facilities and lounges for LR men's and women's lacrosse among other upgrades. The total project time was a little over eight months.\n\nOn top of the facility upgrades, Hay has overseen expanding the Bears corporate sponsorship dollars 40% over the last year and has added numerous new sponsors to support LR Athletics. His success in adding additional corporate partners is primarily tied to his ability to steward relationships and diversifying the Bears marketing assets such as the web stream, in-game promotions, social media and unique community partnerships. Additionally, with the upgrades that have included videoboards at Moretz Stadium and Shuford Arena, Hay has been creative in giving sponsors direct and visible recognition on the new technology.\n\nJustin also provides sport oversight, serves on the senior administrative leadership team, and will oversee the external communications of Lenoir-Rhyne Athletics.\n\nHay came to the Bears after spending five years as an Assistant Baseball Coach and three years as the Assistant Director of Athletics for Operations at Southwest Mississippi Community College. At Southwest Mississippi, Hay helped raise $191,000 in three years for facility improvements and increased annual fundraising 300%. Additionally, he increased community involvement at home athletic events with the creation of the Bear Cubs Club and initiated and signed an Adidas apparel deal to increase department branding. Hay also created hospitality rooms at football and basketball games to entertain donors and potential donors and created Southwest Bears TV for live streaming.\n\nIn addition to his administrative work, Hay helped guide the Bears baseball team to their first winning season and playoff appearance since 2006. In the classroom, Hay's players were named NJCAA All-Academic each of the years he coached and 19 members of the 2018 team received academic honors from the NJCAA and/or MACJC.\n\nHay returned to the Division II level where he spent two years as an Assistant Baseball Coach/Assistant Athletic Fields Supervisor at Barton College.\n\nJustin earned his bachelors from Faulkner University in 2011 and his masters in Sports Management and Sports Events Security from Southern Mississippi in August 2015.\n\nHay and his wife Ali reside in Hickory with their daughters Caldwell and Scottie."
