Dr. Whitt assumed the presidency at L-R on February 1, 2017.\n\nDuring Dr. Whitt’s tenure, the university emphasized four themes identified in its strategic plan—enhancing academic excellence, improving the student experience, boosting brand identity, and ensuring a sustainable future.\n\nA nationwide search for Dr. Whitt’s successor will begin in the coming months. Until then, Dr. Whitt will remain fully committed to Lenoir-Rhyne through the 2024-25 academic year and will work to ensure a smooth transition for the next president.\n\nContributing to his decision to retire, Dr. Whitt cited a desire to travel and spend more time with his extended family, including his five grandchildren (ages one through nine)."
