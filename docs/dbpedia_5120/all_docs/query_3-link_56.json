        "text": "General 1/26/2024 9:04:00 PM Ethan Seaborn\n\nWHKY: Cougars defeated during Friday night game\n\nBox Score After succumbing to the University of Calgary Dinos at the annual Crowchild Classic earlier this week, the Mount Royal University women's hockey team aimed to bounce back as they hosted the Dinos Friday evening.\n\nThe first period saw two penalties, with neither team securing points for their respective sides.\n\nRebecca Clarke of the Dinos received the first penalty of the game for bodychecking with only six minutes remaining in the period.\n\nDespite MRU having a two-minute power play advantage, they were unable to find the net.\n\nIn the last 30 seconds of the period, Jerzey Watteyne of the Cougars received a two-minute tripping penalty, giving U of C a power play opportunity heading into the second period.\n\nThe second period was filled with energy as both teams managed to score points.\n\nLess than two minutes into the period, Josie McLeod of U of C received a tripping penalty, giving MRU another opportunity to score on a power play. However, the Cougars were unable to capitalize.\n\nApproximately five minutes in, Lyndsey Janes of the Cougars received a two-minute roughing penalty, returning the power play advantage to the Dinos.\n\nDespite the advantage, the Dinos could not get past the Cougars defence.\n\nJust over the halfway mark of the period, Mackenzie Loupelle of MRU received an interference penalty, providing the Dinos with another power play opportunity.\n\nThe Cougar's defence effectively countered any attacks from the Dinos.\n\nWith less than four minutes left in the period, Athena Hauck of MRU scored the first goal of the game, with assists from Aliya Jomha and Gabby Lindsay.\n\nSeconds later, Rebecca Clarke of U of C leveled the score 1 – 1, with an assist from Elizabeth Lang.\n\nThe Dinos took an early lead into the third period.\n\nLess than two minutes in, Jess Martens brought her team to a 2 – 1 lead over the Cougars, with an assist from Brooklin Fry.\n\nWith just over ten minutes remaining in the period, the Dinos extended their lead to 3 – 1 with Brooklin Fry finding the Cougars net, assisted by Jada Johns and Kyla Mitenko.\n\nShortly after, Elizabeth Lang of the Dinos furthered her team's lead to 4 – 1, with an assist from Rebecca Clarke.\n\nThe sole penalty of the period was given to Jerzey Watteyne of MRU for bodychecking, with under four minutes remaining in the period.\n\nThe Cougars decided to pull their goalie during the Dinos power play to create a five-on-five game.\n\nIn the last minute of the game, the Cougars pulled their goalie, creating a six-on-five situation.\n\nThis approach worked in favour of MRU as Ava Metzger scored in the last seconds of the game, with an assist from Sydney Benko, bringing the score to 2 – 4.\n\nThe Cougars ultimately fell the to the Dinos 2 – 4 in their home arena.\n\nThe Mount Royal University women's hockey team will play their next home game against the University of British Columbia on Feb. 9 at 7 p.m. Tickets can be purchased here.\n\nPlayers Mentioned\n\n#4 Mackenzie Loupelle\n\nForward\n\n5' 5\"\n\nFirst Year\n\n#12 Lyndsey Janes\n\nForward\n\n5' 4\"\n\nFirst Year\n\n#29 Athena Hauck\n\nForward\n\n5' 7\"\n\nFirst Year\n\n#8 Sydney Benko\n\nForward\n\n5' 6\"\n\nThird Year\n\n#25 Aliya Jomha\n\nForward\n\n5' 5\"\n\nThird Year\n\n#11 Ava Metzger\n\nForward\n\n5' 7\"\n\nSecond Year\n\n#16 Gabby Lindsay\n\nForward\n\n5' 8\"\n\nFirst Year\n\n#44 Jerzey Watteyne\n\nForward\n\n5' 7\"\n\nFirst Year"
