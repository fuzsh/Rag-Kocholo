        "text": "University of North Carolina Television, branded on-air as UNC-TV, is a public television network serving the U.S. state of North Carolina. It is operated by the University of North Carolina system, which holds the licenses for all but one of the thirteen PBS member television stations licensed in the state—WTVI (channel 42) in Charlotte is owned by Central Piedmont Community College. The broadcast signals of the twelve television stations cover almost all of the state, as well as parts of Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland, Georgia, And the District. The network's operations are located at the UNC Center for Public Television at Research Triangle Park between Raleigh and Durham.\n\nHistory[]\n\nWUNC-TV in Chapel Hill, the state network's flagship station, first signed on the air on January 8, 1955 as the second non-commercial educational television station located south of Washington, D.C.—one day after Cheaha, Alabama-licensed WCIQ-TV. Over the next twelve years, four more satellite stations signed on. WUND-TV in Edenton (originally WUNB-TV, licensed to Columbia) was the first of these satellites to debut in September 1965, followed by the launches of WUNE-TV in Linville in September 1967, WUNF-TV in Asheville in September 11, 1967, WUNG-TV in Concord in September 11, 1967, and WUNJ-TV in Wilmington in June 4, 1971. This was supplemented with a network of translator stations in the Appalachian Mountains that also allowed the network's programming to reach across the entire state.\n\nFive additional satellites debuted afterward: WUNK-TV in Greenville in May 1972, WUNL-TV in Winston-Salem in February 1973, WUNM-TV in Jacksonville in November 1982, WUNP-TV in Roanoke Rapids in 1986, and WUNU-TV in Lumberton in September 1996. The state network's youngest station, WUNW in Canton, signed on in July 2010 to replace a translator that had served the area since the 1980s. The state network was branded on-air as \"North Carolina Public Television\" (identified in North Carolina editions of TV Guide as \"CPT\", an abbreviated form of \"University of North Carolina Center for Public Television\") from 1979 to the mid-1990s, when it rebranded itself as \"University of North Carolina Television\". It simplified the brand name to \"UNC-TV\" later in the 1990s; it had previously used that brand for most of the 1970s.\n\nStations[]\n\nFull Power Stations[]\n\nCall signs Location CH First Air Date WUNC Chapel Hill, NC 4 January 8, 1955 WUND Edenton, NC 2 September 10, 1965 WUNE Linville, NC 17 September 11, 1967 WUNF Asheville, NC 33 September 11, 1967 WUNG Concord, NC 58 September 11, 1967 WUNJ Wilmington, NC 39 June 4, 1971 WUNK Greenville, NC 25 May 7, 1972 WUNL Winston-Salem, NC 26 February 22, 1973 WUNM Jacksonville, NC 19 November 16, 1982 WUNP Roanoke Rapids, NC 36 October 16, 1986 WHMC Lumberton, NC 31 September 23, 1996 WUNW Canton, NC 27 July 21, 2010\n\nLogo History[]\n\nComing soon\n\nGallery[]\n\nTV stations in North Carolina UNC-TV: Other WUNC, Chapel Hill WTVI, Charlotte WUNP, Roanoke Rapids WUND, Edenton WUNE, Linville WUNF, Asheville WUNG, Concord WUNJ, Wilmington WUNL, Winston-Salem WUNM, Jacksonville WUNU, Lumberton WUNW, Canton\n\nTV stations in North Carolina's Research Triangle region, including Raleigh, Durham, and Fayetteville WUNC 4 (PBS)\n\nWRAL 5 (NBC)\n\nWAUG-LD 8 (AMGTV)\n\nWTVD 11 (ABC)\n\nWUBX-CD 13 (Ind)\n\nWNCB-LD 16 (ESTRELLA)\n\nWNCN 17 (CBS)\n\nWLFL 22 (CW)\n\nW24CP-D 24 (3ABN)\n\nWTNC-LD 26 (UNI)\n\nWIRP-LD 27 (ESTRELLA)\n\nWRDC 28 (MNTV)\n\nWRAY 30 (TCT)\n\nWHIG-CD 31 (Ind)\n\nWARZ-CD 34 (RTV)\n\nWUNP 36 (PBS)\n\nWUVC 40 (UNI)\n\nWNCR-LD 41 (Youtoo)\n\nWHFL-CD 43 (Rel)\n\nWYBE-CD 44 (Ind)\n\nW46EU-D 46 (HSN2)\n\nWRPX 47 (Ion)\n\nWRAZ 50 (Fox)\n\nWRTD-CD 54 (TLM)\n\nWFPX 62 (Court TV)\n\nWWIW-LD 66 (Daystar)\n\nTV stations in the Charlotte, North Carolina area WBTV 3 (CBS)\n\nWSOC 9 (ABC)\n\nWHKY 14 (Ind)\n\nWCEE-LP 16 (ESTRELLA)\n\nWUNE 17 (PBS)\n\nWCCB 18 (CW)\n\nW21CK-D 21 (3ABN)\n\nWHWD-LD 21 (Daystar)\n\nWDMC-LD 25 (Daystar)\n\nWGTB-CD 28 (Ind)\n\nWNSC 30 (PBS)\n\nWCNC 36 (NBC)\n\nWVEB-LD 40 (Cozi)\n\nWHEH-LD 41 (AZA)\n\nWTVI 42 (PBS)\n\nWJZY 46 (Fox)\n\nWMYT 55 (MNTV)\n\nWUNG 58 (PBS)\n\nWAXN 64 (Ind)\n\nTV stations in the Western Carolinas, including Greenville–Spartanburg–Anderson, SC and Asheville, NC WYFF 4 (NBC)\n\nWSPA 7 (CBS)\n\nWLOS 13 (ABC)\n\nWGGS 16 (Ind)\n\nWHNS 21 (Fox)\n\nWUNW 27 (PBS)\n\nW28DB-D 28 (GEB)\n\nWNTV 29 (PBS)\n\nWGTA 32 (Ind)\n\nWUNF 33 (PBS)\n\nWNEH 38 (PBS)\n\nWMYA 40 (Dabl)\n\nWRET 49 (PBS)\n\nWSQY-LP 51 (Daystar)\n\nWYCW 62 (CW)\n\nTV stations in the Hampton Roads region, including Virginia Beach, Norfolk, Portsmouth, and Newport News, Virginia WUND 2 (PBS)\n\nWTKR 3 (CBS)\n\nWSKY 4 (Ind)\n\nWGBS-LD 7 (RTV)\n\nWAVY 10 (NBC)\n\nWVEC 13 (ABC)\n\nW14DC 14 (HSN2)\n\nWHRO 15 (PBS)\n\nWYSJ-CA 19 (Classic TV)\n\nWTPC 21 (TBN)\n\nWVAD-LD 25 (Daystar)\n\nWGNT 27 (CW)\n\nWTVZ 33 (MNTV)\n\nWJGN-CD 38 (NRB)\n\nWVBT 43 (Fox)\n\nWPXV 49 (Ion)\n\nTV stations in the Piedmont Triad, including Greensboro, High Point, and Winston-Salem, North Carolina WFMY 2 (CBS)\n\nWGHP 8 (Fox)\n\nWXII 12 (NBC)\n\nWGPX 16 (Ion)\n\nWGSR-LD 19 (Ind.)\n\nWCWG 20 (CW)\n\nWUNL 26 (PBS)\n\nWLXI 43 (TCT)\n\nWXLV 45 (ABC)\n\nWMYV 48 (MNTV)\n\nTV stations in Eastern North Carolina, including Greenville, New Bern, Washington, Jacksonville and Morehead City WITN 7 (NBC)\n\nWNCT 9 (CBS)\n\nWCTI 12 (ABC)\n\nWYDO 14 (Fox)\n\nWUNM 19 (PBS)\n\nWTMH-LD 21 (HEARTLAND)\n\nWUNK 25 (PBS)\n\nWPXU 35 (Ion)\n\nWEPX 38 (Ion)\n\nTV stations in the Pee Dee region, including Myrtle Beach and Florence, South Carolina WBTW 13 (CBS)\n\nWPDE 15 (ABC)\n\nWWMB 21 (CW)\n\nWHMC 23 (PBS)\n\nWUNU 31 (PBS)\n\nWMBF 32 (NBC)\n\nWJPM 33 (PBS)\n\nWFXB 43 (Fox)"
