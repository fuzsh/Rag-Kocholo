        "text": "WHAT'S ON TAP: The University of North Dakota women's hockey team will be looking for answers heading into halloween weekend and get back into the win column as it remains on the road this weekend in a conference series against St. Cloud State. The Sioux have gone winless over the past five games after defeating defending national champion Wisconsin to open the season. Puck drops at 7:07 p.m. on Friday and 2:07 p.m. on Saturday at the National Hockey Center.\n\nMEDIA INFORMATION: Most Fighting Sioux regular season home hockey games can be heard on 1440 AM (\"The Fan\") and on stations across the Fighting Sioux Radio Network (excluding Oct. 18 against Minnesota State, Nov. 21 against Manitoba Maple Leafs and Dec. 13 against Minnesota) with broadcaster Darrin Looker calling the action.\n\nSCOUTING REPORT FOR THE HUSKIES: St. Cloud State was picked to finish fourth in the conference in the preseason poll but much like the Sioux are off to a rocky start ... The Huskies are currently 0-4-0 to open WCHA play and 1-5-1 overall ... They opened conference play in Duluth, Minn., where they were swept 5-3 and 2-0 by the Bulldogs before a home-and-home series with Minnesota ... The Gophers won both games 4-0 and 7-0 ... The Huskies lost their leading scorer to graduation from last season in Megan McCarthy but did return their next four on the list and are all seniors this year in Caitlin Hogan, Felicia Nelson, Holly Roberts and Danielle Hirsch ... Hogan currently leads the team with six points (five goals) while Roberts is second with three points (all assists) ...Splitting time in net is junior Ashley Nixon and sophomore Tayler VanDenakker ... Combined they have a 4.00 goals-allowed average and a .886 save percentage this season.\n\nST. CLOUD STATE COACHING STAFF: Head coach Jeff Giesen is in his fourth season with a career record of 45-51-16 (.473). He is assisted by Jason Johnson and Jennifer Kranz.\n\nTHE ALL-TIME SERIES: UND is 7-17-4 all-time against St. Cloud State with five of its seven wins coming in Grand Forks. Head coach Brian Idalski has a record of 3-6-3 against SCSU since coming to UND after spending the 2006-07 season as an assistant coach with the Huskies program.\n\nThe Sioux did win three of their four meetings last season sweeping SCSU to open conference play in the R.E.A. and splitting in St. Cloud, Minn. They games were all decided by two goals or less with the Sioux scoring 10 goals and the Huskies seven in four games played. All four were settled in regulation.\n\nEight returning Sioux have scored points against the Huskies with Stephanie Roy leading the way with two goals and three assists.\n\nLAST ACTION: The Fighting Sioux faced off against Minnesota Duluth on the road and it was a penalty-filled two games. The Sioux had 63 penalty minutes while UMD was called for 36 in a pair of games that the Bulldogs won.\n\nOn Friday, the Sioux scored first with a goal by Mary Loken which broke the teams scoreless drought on the power play to start the season, but the Bulldogs would go 3-for-12 on the power play to help them to a 4-1 win.\n\nThe Sioux got off to a quick start again on Saturday as Janet Babchishin scored her first goal as a member of the squad, but again the Sioux allowed the UMD to answer with a 2-of-13 power-play night to earn a 3-1 victory.\n\nSophomore Stephanie Ney started both games in net and allowed 7 goals, but only two of them came at even strength and two goals against came on 5-on-3 penalty kills. Ney made 70 saves on the weekend.\n\nMAKING LITTLE SENSE: Usually quick starts in a game are good for a team and the 2008-09 Sioux were an example as they went 10-2-1 when scoring the games first goal, but in five of six games this season the Sioux have scored first and they have went 1-3-1.\n\nPOLL POSITION: The Sioux are currently not ranked.\n\nPERFECT START: Redshirt freshman Jorid Dagfinrud's regular-season opener shutout against defending national champion and then top-ranked Wisconsin was the first time a Sioux goaltender has opened their collegiate career with a shutout. It is also the first time in the programs history that the Sioux have won by shutout in its opening game.\n\nCONFERENCE VS. COUNTRY: Junior Kelly Lewis and sophomore Alyssa Wiebe were chosen to WCHA All-Star Team that faced the U.S. Women's National Team including UND's Jocelyne and Monique Lamoureux at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul, Minn. The U.S. National Team defeated the WCHA All-Stars 6-1 with M. Lamoureux scoring a goal and an assist in the game. The Sioux will get their own attempt when it faces off against the U.S. Olympic team Oct. 10 in Warroad, Minn.\n\nEAT, DRINK AND BE SCARY: UND got off to a \"scary\" good start last season heading into Halloween when they went 5-2-1 in the month of October. The Sioux split on a roadtrip to open the year against Maine, before sweeping St. Cloud State and Union at home (tied and lost to Minnesota State). The Sioux had their best month in October.\n\nEXPERIENCE IS THE BEST TEACHER: Goaltender Brittany Kirkham is one game shy of tying the record of games played by a Sioux goaltender.\n\nMY GOAL IS TO DENY YOURS: Kirkham tied Margaret-Ann Hinkley's (2003-04) school record of six career shutouts against Union Oct. 24, 2009. Her next shutout will give her sole possession of the record. Kirkham had four shutouts in her sophomore season which tied the season record of Hinkley's.\n\nYOUNG BLOOD: There are a lot of new faces on the 2009-10 Sioux bench, a year after rewriting the record books and finishing tied for fifth place in the WCHA standings, its highest finish ever. UND will have 10 freshman and one redshirt freshmen looking to add depth to the Sioux lineup. This group replaces the loss of four graduating Sioux (Melissa Jaques, Randi Motsko, Casie Hanson and Kelsey Fletcher).\n\nBRANCHING OUT: Head coach Brian Idalski has been adamant about stating that he and his staff will recruit kids locally but also from where ever the top players are at. This year's team is starting to show evidence to that with a roster made up of players from four different countries (United States, 15; Canada, 8; Germany, 1; and Norway, 1), five different states (Alaska, 2; Colorado, 2; Michigan, 1; Minnesota, 7; and North Dakota, 4) and six different provinces (Alberta, 2; British Columbia, 1; Manitoba, 1; New Brunswick, 1; Ontario, 1; Quebec, 1; and Saskatchewan, 2).\n\nAND IT'S TIME FOR THE WEATHER: Probably as accurate as your local weatherman, the pre-season poll is usually a good indicator but there is always a surprise or two. In the 2009-10 WCHA Head Coaches' Pre-Season Poll the Sioux ranked sixth.\n\n1. Wisconsin\n\n2. Minnesota\n\n3. Minnesota Duluth\n\n4. St. Cloud State\n\n5. Ohio State\n\n6. North Dakota\n\n7. Minnesota State\n\n8. Bemidji State\n\nThe 2009-10 Pre-Season WCHA Player of the Year was Brooke Ammerman (Wisconsin) while the Rookie of the Year was Brianna Decker (Wisconsin) as voted by conference coaches.\n\nA NEW LOOK, BUT THE SAME TEAM: The Sioux will be sporting new jerseys this season for the first time in program history.\n\nOH CAPTAIN, MY CAPTAIN: Senior D Kelly Lewis (Forest Lake, Minn.) will serve as captain of the 2009-10 Fighting Sioux. Seniors D Cassandra Flanagan (Great Falls, Manitoba) and G Brittany Kirkham (Ottawa, Ontario) along with junior F Stephanie Roy (Grande-Digue, New Brunswick) were named assistant captains.\n\nRAISING THE BAR: The expectations for the Sioux continue to rise under head coach Brian Idalski and his staff as every year his teams have improved in the standings. Taking over a team that went winless in the WCHA (8th place) prior to his first year when the Sioux won four games (7th place) and last year nine games (t-5th place).\n\nSEARCHING FOR GOLD: UND's newest additions to the team and Grand Forks natives Jocelyne and Monique Lamoureux will be redshirting this season as the sophomores are part of the initial 23-player roster for the 2009-10 U.S. Women's National Team.\n\nThe twins will be centralized in the Twin cities and will take part in the Qwest Tour, a 10-game, nine-city domestic tour that begins on Sept. 25 in St. Paul, Minn., and concludes just prior to the 2010 Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver, British Columbia. The twins and the team will face the Sioux in exhibition action in Warroad, Minn., on Saturday, Oct. 10.\n\nJocelyne and Monique are aiming to be the first-ever women's Olympians while active student-athletes at UND. Senior Susanne Fellner played in the 2006 Olympics for the German National Team before becoming a Sioux.\n\nMake sure to follow the twins on FighingSioux.com during the season as they will be blogging during their Olympic adventures!"
