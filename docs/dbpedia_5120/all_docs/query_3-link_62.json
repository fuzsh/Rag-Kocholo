        "text": "The TMU Bold women's hockey team secured another commitment in their 2024 recruiting class, signing forward Katie Leroux out of Surrey, B.C. Leroux graduated from Elgin Park Secondary, playing for their hockey team and the Fraser Valley Rush.\n\nLeroux served as captain of her Fraser Valley team, having played with fellow 2024 recruit Nahvin Bal. Together they captured three provincial gold medals, two provincial silver medals and two Pacific region championships.\n\n\"Right away, we were drawn to Katie's passion and drive as a hockey player. She's a selfless player that will compete and pay the price to make plays,\" said Bold head coach, Lisa Haley. \"As a captain with her club team, we expect Katie will embrace the opportunity to positively impact our team culture as well.\"\n\nLeroux will join the sport media program when she arrives at TMU in the fall. The program matches Leroux's interests in photography and media engagement as she served in a media coordinator role for Elgin Park's soccer team.\n\n\"I chose TMU because the school offered a sports media program that I was very interested in, as well the hockey program matched all my team culture and morals,\" Leroux told the Bold. \"After talking to coach Lisa and how she was so passionate about the team and program I was very intrigued.\"\n\nLeroux will look to help the Bold back to the OUA playoffs after just missing out on the postseason last year. The regular season opener is scheduled for October 9th, against York.\n\nTMU Women's Hockey Recruiting Class 2024-25\n\nDayle Chinnick\n\nNahvin Bal\n\nKatie Leroux"
