The caller is stating that the person has missed court and a warrant has been issued for their arrest.\n\nThe caller is demanding that money needs to be paid immediately. This is a scam. The Sheriff’s Office would never call you and demand you pay any money to avoid arrest. If you receive this call, report it by calling 828-632-2911 (non-emergency line)."
