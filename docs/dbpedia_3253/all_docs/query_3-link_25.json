        "text": "The Nashville Predators have some of the league’s best goaltending, with a duo of Pekka Rinne and Juuse Saros that looks poised to challenge for the Stanley Cup this season. Still, they’re committed to strengthening the position by signing more international talent. The team has signedÂ top Czech goaltenderÂ Miroslav SvobodaÂ to a two-year entry-level contract.\n\nSvoboda was arguably the best goaltender in the Czech league this season, recording a 33-14 record with a .926 save percentage including five shutouts. The 23-year old goaltender was drafted in the seventh round by the Edmonton Oilers as an over-aged player in 2015, but never signed. The fact that he now has means he’s likely ready to start his North American career, one that could progress quickly.\n\nThe 6’3″ goaltender joins a group of youngsters that could be used should Rinne decide to sign elsewhere after the 2018-19 season. Scheduled to be an unrestricted free agent next summer, Rinne will be 36 years old and likely looking for one last contract. If Nashville decides Saros is ready to take over full-time, the team will need to find a backup. Svoboda will be competing for that role, along with several other international prospects."
