There is still no word on what injury Rinne suffered.\n\nThe Predators will start Juuse Saros against the Edmonton Oilers Saturday and have recalled Miroslav Svoboda from the team's ECHL affiliate, to serve as his backup.\n\nIn five games this season, Rinne has a 3-1 record with a .929 save percentage and 2.10 goals against average."
