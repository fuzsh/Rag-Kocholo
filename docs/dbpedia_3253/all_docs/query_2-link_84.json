        "text": "2017/2018 marked a big change for NHL backups. A new rule, implemented during the summer of 2017, requires that all NHL teams have an emergency goalie on hand at every NHL game. A peculiar part of the new rule change is that you're only allowed to take warmup if you have to enter a game if your NOT on the bench. The result of this change has been notable. The first being that there is always a skilled emergency goalie readily available at any game. The second is that when summoned, they remain hidden in back rooms. This has produced a new type of NHL backup only, highlighted by this research that I've assembled.\n\nIf anyone has anymore of these recent 'close calls' please let me know.\n\nGarret Bodington\n\nOctober 20, 2017 the Vegas Golden Knights were in New York playing the Islanders when starting goalie Oscar Dansk was forced to leave with an injury. Maxime Lagace was sent into the crease and New York's house emergency backup, Garret Bodington, was summoned by the Golden Knights. Bodington got dressed, complete with a Golden Knights jersey, but wasn't needed. “It’s happened a couple of times,” said Bodington. “I stay in the locker room, the coaches’ locker room, and you’re nervous. Earlier this year, I was nervous. But I think you’ve probably played over this game in your head a thousand times, so if you ever get that chance to go in, you get good defense out in front of you and you keep the shots kind of outside.”\n\nSource: Golf superintendent is also Isles’ emergency goalie\n\nMartin Moody\n\nNovember 26, 2017 the San Jose Sharks were hosting the Winnipeg Jets. Mid-way through the game, the Jets lost goalie Steve Mason to an injury. Connor Hellebuyck finished the game for Winnipeg but Martin Moody was summoned to get dressed for the remainder of the second and the third period of the NHL game. Moody was San Jose's house emergency backup. He was given a no. 30 Jets jersey with his name on it and was allowed to watch some of the game from the tunnel. “There isn’t really nerves when you’re not yet on the ice, but I’m sure they would come if I were ever formally called upon,” Moody said.\n\nSource: Sharks' emergency goalie reveals how he prepares to play\n\nTyler Stewart\n\nDecember 7, 2017 Carter Hutton suffered a game day injury that forced to the team to recall Ville Husso from the AHL and sign Tyler Stewart as an emergency goalie. Wearing No. 98, Stewart took part in the pre-game warm ups and was the backup goaltender until Husso arrived midway through the first period. Husso was listed as the game's official backup. During the first period, Stewart was hidden in the dressing room until Husso's arrival. The NHL didn't want him sitting on the bench with Husso on the way. \"The night just flew by, it was just crazy,\" said Stewart of the experience. He didn't get to keep the jersey, put did go home with a couple game pucks.\n\nConnor Beaupre\n\nDecember 12, 2017 Minnesota Wild goalie Devan Dubnyk suffered a lower body injury in the opening period of a game against the Calgary Flames. Alex Stalock took his place in net and Connor Beaupre was called to put on pads and replace Stalock as the Wild's backup goalie. Beaupre, the son of former NHL goalie Don Beaupre, was on hand as one of the team's official emergency goalies. He had played high school hockey at Edina High School and then club hockey at the University of Denver. Beaupre put on half of his gear and spent the second and third periods in the tunnel next to the dressing room. Beaupre gets an 'honourable mention' because he did not sign an amateur tryout and stayed in the tunnel, out of view. The Wild had a No. 30 sweater with his name on it ready to go, but Beaupre never got the chance to put in on.\n\nChris Venti\n\nJanuary 23, 2018 the Boston Bruins hosted the New Jersey Devils. During the game, New Jersey lost goalie Corey Schneider to injury. He was replaced by Ken Appleby, who finished the game. For insurance, the Devils summoned Bruins house emergency backup Chris Venti to dress. Venti was given a Devils jersey and spent the remainder of the game in a back room in full gear. “I did know it could potentially happen,” Venti said, “but I never thought in a million years it would.”\n\nSource: In the E-Venti of an Emergency: A Day in the Life of an NHL Emergency Backup Goalie\n\nThomas Hodges\n\nJanuary 24, 2018 the Dallas Stars were hosting the Florida Panthers. Early into the first period, Florida goalie Jason Reimer left the game with an injury. Harri Sateri finished the game for Florida but Dallas house emergency backup goalie Thomas Hodges was summoned to dress as Florida's new backup. Florida had a no. 31 jersey ready for him and Hodges spent the rest of the game in the tunnel with his gear on. \"It was good,\" said Hodges. \"I think the people around me were more nervous than I was.\" Hodges had dressed a number of times as an emergency backup in the ECHL as a house backup with the Allen Americans.\n\nSource: Stars notebook: NHL's emergency goalie plan put into effect after injury to Panthers' James Reimer\n\nAndrew Margolin\n\nFebruary 9, 2018 the New York Rangers lost goalie Ondrej Pavelec in a game against the Calgary Flames. Henrik Lundqvist took over in the crease and Andrew Margolin was summoned to dress in case of another injury. Margolin got dressed and the Rangers equipment team, familiar with Margolin as New York's house backup, decided to have a little fun and gave him a \"McBackup\" no. 69 New York Rangers jersey. He didn't end up leaving the back room for the duration of the game. Margolin had last played with Connecticut College in 2012.\n\nAlex Bjerk\n\nMarch 20, 2018 the Vegas Golden Knights lost goalie March Andre Fleury to an injury during a game against the Vancouver Canucks. Malcolm Subban took Fleury's place in net and Bjerk, the Vegas house backup, was summoned to dress and presented with a Golden Knights jersey. “The equipment guys came running in, yelling ‘Alex, Alex, get your stuff on now! You’re going out!’,” said Bjerk, “It was all surreal. I was pacing back and forth in the locker room. You could probably see my heart beating through my chest.” March 21, 2019 the Winnipeg Jets were in Vegas facing the Golden Knights. During the second period, Jets goalie Laurent Brossoit left the game with a lower-body injury. Connor Hellebuyck replaced Brossoit for the remainder of the game and Bjerk was summoned by the Jets to dress as their new backup. He was given a no. 32 jersey but remained in the dressing room as Hellebuyck finished the game.\n\nSource: From the NHL to Kasson, former Ice Hawk Bjerk happy to be back in Minnesota\n\nNick Barnett\n\nMarch 28, 2018 the Colorado Avalanche hosted the Philadelphia Flyers. Flyers goalie Michal Neuvirth left the game during the second period with an injury. Petr Mrazek replaced Neuvirth and finished the game, but Colorado's emergency backup, Nick Barnett, was asked to dress in case anything should happen to Mrazek. Barnett spent the remainder of the game with his pads on but was not needed. Barnett is a Denver native who had played high level junior hockey.\n\nColin Cooper\n\nDecember 12, 2018 the Philadelphia Flyers were in Calgary to play the Flames. Mike Smith played the first two periods for the Flames but feeling unwell, he left for the final period. David Rittich took over for Smith and the Flames, realizing Smith was done for night, called in Cooper to act as the new backup for the third period.\n\nMarch 27, 2019 the Dallas Stars visited the Calgary Flames in the Saddledome. In the second period, Dallas lost starting goalie Ben Bishop to a lower-body injury. Anton Khudobin finished the game and\n\nCooper was asked to dress for the Stars as their emergency backup.\n\nFebruary 2, 2020 the Edmonton Oilers were in town to face the Calgary Flames. In a rare occurrence, the game featured a goalie fight. Calgary's Cam Talbot squared off with Edmonton's Mike Smith. Both goalies were kicked out for fighting and replaced by backups David Rittich and Mikko Koskinen. Calgary's resident emergency goalie, Colin Cooper, was rushed down from the stands to dress as the new backup - for both teams. He spent the remainder of the game waiting nervously in the Fames video room. “It’s a wild feeling because it starts hitting you — ‘I could be in this game if something goes wrong,'\" Cooper said.\n\nSource:Next in net: Emergency goalie was on standby for both sides in Battle of Alberta\n\nRylan Toth\n\nDecember 15, 2018 the Vancouver Canucks were hosting the Philadelphia Flyers. During the first period, Flyers goalie Anthony Stolarz was injured and left the game. Alex Lyon took his place in net and Canucks house backup Rylan Toth was called in to act as the emergency backup in case anything happened to Lyon. Toth spent the rest of the game wearing his pads, hidden in the dressing room. “They gave me a stick and once I got back from Christmas break, there was a jersey in my stall. So they had actually made up a jersey and it had my name on it,” Toth said.\n\nSource: Flying high: Rylan Toth's unusual NHL call-up thanks to emergency backup rule\n\nTrevor Hanger\n\nJanuary 12, 2019 the Washington Capitals were playing host to the Columbus Blue Jackets. Mid-way through the game, Capitals goalie Braden Holtby suffered an injury and left the ice. He was replaced in net by Pheonix Copley and Hanger was called down from the stands to dress as Washington's new backup. He put on half of his gear and watched the rest of the game from the dressing room. \"I was shocked at how nervous I was, to be honest,\" said Hanger. \"I think I'm a pretty level headed guy. I've worked in some pressure situations and it's nothing that fazes me necessarily. But getting the rush to go get out of your seat and go to the garage and get your equipment, meeting up with security and personnel who take you to the locker room — all that is happening very quickly in real time. But when you're doing it, it feels like it can't possibly be happening fast enough.\"\n\nSource: Meet Trevor Hanger, one of the Washington Capitals emergency backup goalies (EBUGS)\n\nSteve Jakiel\n\nFebruary 17, 2019 the Los Angeles Kings were facing the Boston Bruins with Jack Campbell tending net for the Kings. Jonathan Quick is listed on the game summary as LA's backup goalie, but he left the building with an illness and was not present during the actual game. Steve Jakiel, the house backup, was asked to put on his gear and get ready should anything happen to Campbell. Jakiel watched the game from the video room with half his gear on, pacing the room nervously. Although Jakiel was close to being an official backup, he was never signed by the Kings and remained hidden in the back room for the duration of the contest.\n\nKenny Cameron\n\nMarch 9, 2019 the Edmonton Oilers were facing the Toronto Maple Leafs and Kenny Cameron was on hand as one of the team's backup goalies, a duty he frequently did. Mikko Koskinen was listed on the game program as Edmonton's backup and Anthony Stolarz played the whole game but had Stolarz gotten injured, Cameron may have been summoned. Koskinen was not feeling well. \"He's in the building, but Stolarz is going to be the starting goalie,\" said Oilers coach Ken Hitchcock. \"The emergency backup's in the building, too. So if we run into a problem we've got two guys who in the lounge now.\"\n\nSource: PressReader.com - Your favorite newspapers and magazines.\n\nTodd Scarola\n\nApril 28, 2019 the Carolina Hurricanes lost goalie Petr Mrazek during the second period of a second round playoffs series game against the New York Islanders. Curtis McElhinney took Mrazek's place and Todd Scarola was asked to dress as the new backup. He put on his gear and waited in the dressing room, but was not needed. The 27 year old Scarola had last played hockey for Stony Brook University.\n\nByron Spriggs\n\nNovember 12, 2019 the Colorado Avalanche were in Winnipeg to play the Jets. Pavel Francouz started the game for Colorado but was injured less than a minute in. Rookie goalie Adam Werner took over for the Avalanche and the team called in Byron Spriggs, Winnipeg's emergency backup, to suite up for the Avs. Unlike most goalies who found themselves asked to dress in such circumstances, Spriggs didn't have to spend the night in a back room. Instead, he was given a front row seat, wearing a No. 60 Avalanche jersey. The only reason he doesn't make the official backup list, is because he wasn't signed to a PTO by the Avalanche. However, they would have had one prepared and waiting “It’s a very intimidating experience,” Spriggs said. “Let alone getting in the actual game… just being there and being part of it was really cool, and all the guys made me feel like part of the team for the hour-and-a-half I was there. Half of you wants to get back in the car and drive away and not come back. The other half of you says it could be one of the most amazing experiences of your life.”\n\nSource: Winnipeg emergency backup goalie: ‘Just being there and being part of it is cool’\n\nJosh Block\n\nNovember 27, 2019 the Detroit Red Wings were facing the Toronto Maple Leafs and Jonathan\n\nBernier was schedule to start for the Red Wings. Feeling unwell, Bernier took the night off and Jimmy Howard started instead. Unfortunately for Bernier, Howard was injured during the game. The game had to be briefly stopped in order to allow Berner, who had not anticipated on playing, to get ready. Meanwhile, Detroit house emergency backup goalie Josh Block was told to get on his gear. “There’s a reason why they’re called emergency,\" said Red Wings coach Jeff Blashill. \"Josh is a great guy, works hard, but it’s not right. That’s not the spirit of the game. I wasn’t going to take Bernie out unless he told me he couldn’t — I mean, Bernie is the one that knows how he feels better than me.\"\n\nSource: The Detroit Red Wings have 2 ailing goaltenders. Here's what we know\n\nBailey Seagraves\n\nDecember 5, 2019 the New York Rangers were in Columbus playing the Blue Jackets. Henrik Lundqvist had the flu and although he's listed on the official game summary as New York's backup, he was not prepared to play. Alexandar Georgiev played the whole game for the Rangers and Bailey Seagraves, the house backup for Columbus, was asked to put on his gear and get ready should anything happen to Georgiev. Seagraves did not sign with the Rangers or sit on the team's bench.\n\nJanuary 14, 2020 the Blue Jackets were hosting the Boston Bruins when the Bruins lost goalie Tuuka Rask to an injury early in the first period. Jaroslav Halak replaced Rask and finished the game in net. Seagraves was summoned by the Bruins to put on his gear, but stayed hidden for the duration of the game.\n\nFebruary 24, 2020 the Columbus Blue Jackets were playing the Ottawa Senators when Blue Jackets goalie Elvis Merzlikins left the game in the second period with an injury. Joonas Korpisalo took his place in net and Bailey Seagraves was summoned from the press box to get his gear on. A no. 1 Blue Jackets jersey with his name on was prepared but Seagraves spent the rest of the game in the locker room. \"I think that doing it for the Jackets is a little bit more special to me,\" Seagraves said. \"I got to do it for the Bruins and the Rangers earlier this year. That was fun, those were my first two times, but to be with the team that I'm here practicing with regularly and I have relationships with the guys and things like that, it was a little more special. They were loving it.\"\n\nSource: https://www.nhl.com/bluejackets/new...e-jackets-emergency-backup-goalie/c-315613712"
