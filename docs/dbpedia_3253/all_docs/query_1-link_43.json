The draft was held on June 26–27, 2015, at the BB&T Center in Sunrise, Florida.[1] The first three selections were Connor McDavid, Jack Eichel and Dylan Strome.\n\nEligibility[]\n\nIce hockey players born between January 1, 1995, and September 15, 1997, were eligible for selection in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. Additionally, undrafted, non-North American players born in 1994 were eligible for the draft, and those players who were drafted in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft, but not signed by an NHL team and who were born after June 30, 1995, were also eligible to re-enter the Draft.[2]\n\nDraft lottery[]\n\nSince the 2012–13 season, all 14 teams not qualifying for the Stanley Cup playoffs have a \"weighted\" chance at winning the first overall selection.[3] Beginning with the 2014–15 season, the NHL changed the weighting system that was used in previous years. Under the new system, the odds of winning the draft lottery for the four lowest finishing teams in the League decreased, while the odds for the other non-playoff teams increased.[4] The Edmonton Oilers won the 2015 draft lottery that took place on April 18, 2015,[5] thus moving them from the third overall pick to the first overall pick.\n\nTop prospects[]\n\nSource: NHL Central Scouting final (April 8, 2015) ranking.[6]\n\nRanking North American skaters[7] European skaters[8] 1 Connor McDavid (C) Mikko Rantanen (RW) 2 Jack Eichel (C) Gabriel Carlsson (D) 3 Noah Hanifin (D) Jacob Larsson (D) 4 Dylan Strome (C) Joel Eriksson Ek (C) 5 Lawson Crouse (LW) Michael Špaček (RW) 6 Mitchell Marner (C/RW) Oliver Kylington (D) 7 Ivan Provorov (D) Denis Guryanov (RW) 8 Pavel Zacha (C) Robin Kovacs (RW) 9 Zach Werenski (D) Filip Ahl (LW) 10 Timo Meier (RW) Jens Looke (RW)\n\nRanking North American goalies[9] European goalies[10] 1 Mackenzie Blackwood Ilya Samsonov 2 Callum Booth Daniel Vladař 3 Samuel Montembeault Felix Sandstrom\n\nSelections by round[]\n\nThe order of the 2015 Entry Draft is listed below.\n\n= NHL All-Star [11] · = NHL All-Star [11] and NHL All-Star Team ·\n\nRound one[]\n\n# Player Nationality NHL Team College/Junior/Club Team 1 Connor McDavid (C) Canada Edmonton Oilers Erie Otters (OHL) 2 Jack Eichel (C) United States Buffalo Sabres Boston University Terriers (Hockey East) 3 Dylan Strome (C) Canada Arizona Coyotes Erie Otters (OHL) 4 Mitchell Marner (C/RW) Canada Toronto Maple Leafs London Knights (OHL) 5 Noah Hanifin (D) United States Carolina Hurricanes Boston College Eagles (Hockey East) 6 Pavel Zacha (C) Czech Republic New Jersey Devils Sarnia Sting (OHL) 7 Ivan Provorov (D) Russia Philadelphia Flyers Brandon Wheat Kings (WHL) 8 Zach Werenski (D) United States Columbus Blue Jackets Michigan Wolverines (Big Ten) 9 Timo Meier (RW) Switzerland San Jose Sharks Halifax Mooseheads (QMJHL) 10 Mikko Rantanen (RW) Finland Colorado Avalanche TPS (Liiga) 11 Lawson Crouse (LW) Canada Florida Panthers Kingston Frontenacs (OHL) 12 Denis Guryanov (RW) Russia Dallas Stars Lada Togliatti (KHL) 13 Jakub Zbořil (D) Czech Republic Boston Bruins (from Los Angeles)1 Saint John Sea Dogs (QMJHL) 14 Jake DeBrusk (LW) Canada Boston Bruins Swift Current Broncos (WHL) 15 Zachary Senyshyn (RW) Canada Boston Bruins (from Calgary)2 Sault Ste.
