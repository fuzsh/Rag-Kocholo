        "text": "Round 1 - 1st overall\n\nFrom the Erie Otters in the OHL, the Edmonton Oilers selected C Connor McDavid.\n\nThe pick came with no surprise. Everyone and their dog has known that McDavid would be the guy here.\n\nMcDavid brings with him to Edmonton a large amount of pedigree with people like Wayne Gretzky considering him the best player to come into the NHL in 30 years. There is little to say about McDavid beyond what has already been said. He already is having large expectations put on him, but he said stepping into the spotlight is something that he isn't worried about.\n\nRound 4 - 117th overall\n\nFrom the USA Development Program, the Edmonton Oilers select D Caleb Jones.\n\nThe younger brother of Nashville Predator Seth Jones, Caleb Jones has the potential to be a future NHL player. Caleb is best described as a versatile, two-way defenceman who has the ability to move the puck up the ice with speed and still be able to return to cover his defensive responsibilities. Although he isn't physically imposing, he plays with a nasty edge to his game. He still has room to grow into his body more.\n\nCaleb is playing next season in the WHL for the Portland Winterhawks.\n\nRound 5 - 124th overall\n\nFrom the Seattle Thunderbirds in the WHL, the Edmonton Oilers select D Ethan Bear.\n\nBear is best described as a puck-moving defenceman who is very mobile with a good knack for the puck. He was a minute eater for the Thunderbirds, and played on their top-pairing. He is able to make good reads on plays, and is a confident puck handler. He put up respectable numbers in the WHL and is a very sharp player who plays tough in the corners. Like Jones, he has the potential to be a NHL player years down the road. He will however need more development. and will likely go back to the WHL.\n\nI spoke with an WHL scout this afternoon who said that the Oilers got great value in this pick.\n\nRound 6 - 154th overall\n\nFrom the South Shore Kings in the USPHL, the Edmonton Oilers select D John Marino.\n\nMarino recently committed to playing at Harvard University in the NCAA. He is an offensively gifted defenceman who loves to have the puck on his stick. He is very confident with his shot selection and has a great release on his heavy shot. However, Marino can sometimes get too caught up in the offensive game and can get caught out of position. He does like to use his body to his advantage and likes to cut guys off with it.\n\nRound 7 - 208th overall\n\nFrom the Czech Republic Jr League, the Edmonton Oilers select G Miroslav Svoboda.\n\nSvoboda doesn't have a Hockey DB profile, but his stats can be viewed here on Elite Prospects.\n\nFrom Jonathan Willis:\n\nSvoboda has had two strong seasons at the Czech junior level and his 6’3″ frame gives him good size for the position. He’ll be stepping up to the senior level next year,playing for second division Czech team AZ Havirov. On paper, he’s not a particularly compelling prospect, but he is just a seventh-round pick, he’s big and has shown well in flashes, and what we don’t know from looking at him on paper could probably fill volumes.\n\nRound 7 - 209th overall\n\nFrom the KHL, the Edmonton Oilers select D Ziyat Paigin.\n\nLike Svoboda, Paigin is a bit of an unknown. There is little information out there on him but he is the Russian player who threw his stick into the crowd following Russia's World Junior gold medal loss in last years WJC. Don't raise your pitchforks about it though.\n\nInternational Scouting Service had this to say about him:\n\nThe big, lanky defender was an imposing figure on the back end for Ak Bars Kazan in the KHL and with Russia at the 2015 U20 World Championships. Paigin’s upside is based around his raw frame and active, intense defensive game. Long active stick and angles well, needs to focus on foot speed and mobility which will benefit when he adds muscle to his massive frame. Thrives in physical play, likes to finish hits and mix it up along the wall. Can be beat wide by quick opposition forwards catching him on the pivot. Decent skill-set on the puck, although at his best when he simplifies his game. Good shot although not much upside in this department at the next level.\n\nAll in all\n\nI consider this to be good drafting by the Oilers. I must say I was surprised to see as many defenceman taken as there were, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Outside of McDavid, all of these players are nothing more than projects at this point and will have to do lots of work to be able to eventually earn their keep at the NHL level."
