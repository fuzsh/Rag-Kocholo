        "text": "What if Connor McDavid has an average rookie season in the National Hockey League?\n\nI know the idea is unthinkable, considering every person associated with hockey, has had him touted as the next big thing, since his early days with the Erie Otters in the CHL. McDavid is expected to break the 70 point barrier in his first season, making him the first rookie since Patrick Kane (72pts in 07-08), to achieve the feat.\n\nThe average point total, for the highest scoring rookie, over the last five seasons, is on average rounded up to be 55pts. Over the last ten, the average total rounded, is 65pts. These totals include the shortened season of 2012-13, and Ovechkin’s ridiculous 105 point rookie season in 05-06.\n\nWhat if McDavid only gets to 65 points this season? Mark Stone and Johnny Gaudreau, scored the most points for a rookie last season, with 64 pts. That’s a good season for veteran NHLers, let alone first year players. But McDavid is predicted to be better than this. He is rated to be at the same level as Sidney Crosby, when he came into the league. Fun fact, even though Crosby scored 102pts in his rookie season, he still finished second behind Alex Ovechkin’s 105 point total. If McDavid was to score 65 points in his rookie season, then for most rookies, playing on most teams, that would be considered a good start.\n\nHowever, Connor McDavid, was drafted by the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nThe same Edmonton Oilers, that have had four number one draft picks, in the last seasons. The same Edmonton Oilers that have been to blame, for not nuturing their young talent, and throwing them into the fire, before they are ready. This Edmonton Oilers, is different from seasons past. Sure, they won the first overall pick in the draft lottery, but they have a new GM in Peter Chiarelli, a new coach in Todd McLellan, and a collection of amateur and pro scouts relieved of duties in the Oilers organization, which means that the Oil has been changed in Edmonton. But will this new Oil change help the engine run better? Or will McDavid just be another young stud, dragged down in Edmonton, before their career can really get going?\n\nIf the start of the season is anything to go by, then it looks like that McDavid will help break the mould and push the Oilers off the bottom of the National Hockey League. The Oilers and McDavid currently match games played and points totals this season (7 GP, 6 PTS). Does this mean that the Oilers will only be as good as Connor McDavid? Perhaps. Does this mean that Connor McDavid will help the Oilers this season? The likelier option of the two.\n\nThere’s no saying that McDavid won’t improve the Oilers this season, but will he get to that magical 70 mark, that he is expected to bypass? The Oilers ended up with 62 points last season and are expected to improve, with the additions they have made. But, with all these additions, can the Oilers get 70 points this season, and if they do, will McDavid match it?\n\nYou can follow me on Twitter if you like, it’s @ThatDamnDoubleC.\n\nConnor McDavid will be an Edmonton Oiler. Unless some crazy Eric Lindros trade goes down, it’s a lock. Don’t kid yourselves people. As an Oilers’ fan, I was pretty surprised by this. I expected some kind of conspiracy as such sending said player to Toronto, or even Philadelphia, to go down. We’re looking at an approximate 10% chance to a team that has had a plethora of first round number one picks already.\n\nThe NHL has been pretty adamant about transparency lately, and we got that tonight. My social media blew up tonight as many people took to it to tag me and let me know their disgust with this turn of events.\n\nThat’s cool. I’m reveling in this outcome. No one wants to see Connor in some irrelevant market. No one will see him as a result. If this kid is as special as we’ve been told, bring him to a popular market. I don’t mean an non-Canadian market, the US has plenty of good spots for the kid. Let’s put him somewhere where people attend games. Places where buying a play-off ticket isn’t easy… you also have to enter a lottery to have the opportunity to watch him play.\n\nI know the Oilers track record has sucked lately. It’s been brutal. I hate the management. I hate the old-boys club. I hope that changes too.\n\nBut what I really hope for, is for this kid to thrive and become what we expect him to be. Regardless of the fact that he will be landing on my team next season, if he is indeed a generational player, let’s put him on the main stage.\n\nIn all fairness, I would have been completely okay if he landed in Toronto or Buffalo. They love hockey there and would have shown up just to watch them play, even if they continued to suck. Great players are just simply one player on the roster at the end of the day.\n\nRemember all those cups in L.A. and St. Louis with “The Great One”?\n\nThe Oilers won their last cup without Gretzky, after all.\n\nUntil then, let’s just enjoy the playoffs this year. This post-season has been excellent, and should prove to be going forward. It’s easy to take the cheap road and impulsively go on social media and outrage!!!! OUTRAGE!!!!\n\nIn all fairness, my real friends have been fun and tongue-and-cheek with myself. It’s been amusing. I’m as shocked as you. But as a deprived Oilers fan, hell yeah… we’ll take him. Unless some bizarre Lindros trade goes down, he’s an Oiler. Deal with it. And consider this… people will see him play.\n\n[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ns14hRqwY8[/youtube]\n\nIlya Bryzgalov is back in the National Hockey League, after verbally agreeing to a 1-year deal with the Edmonton Oilers. Yes, the same Oilers that have apparently been after Ryan Miller all season, have completely lost faith in Devan Dubnyk, that they dragged a guy from the depths of nothing, after he last trained for the Las Vegas Wranglers of the ECHL.\n\nThey had to send defenseman Ladislav Smid to the Calgary Flames in order to make room, and Bryz is really going to help them on the D-line, so trading away a D just to pick up a Goalie that they probably won’t have after this season, is baffling.\n\nThe Oilers seem to be falling apart at the seams. Jordan Eberle is apparently in talks with the Philadelphia Flyers, and Nail Yakupov is also rumoured to be shopped around, which leaves the Oilers with Nugent-Hopkins, Hall, Gagner, and not much else. They only have 10 players on their roster that are signed after this season, so could this mean a clean out in Alberta. Then again, if this was the start of a clean out, why would they bring in a 33 year old Goaltender?\n\nEdmonton is confusing me. They seem to be in worse shape than the Flyers, and that’s saying something."
